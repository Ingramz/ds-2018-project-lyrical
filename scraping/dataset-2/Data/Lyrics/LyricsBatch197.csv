"Electric Light Orchestra, Part II","We're just a stone's throw
From Burning Hellfire
Does anybody know,
Where did all the heroes go?
We've had our fill of
This gallery of scoundrels,
The leaders of the world, 
Those power hungry liars

Rise up and sound the sirens,
Send out the searching powers,
All we need is a few good men
Send the S.O.S. and red alerts
All across the universe
Calling your honest men?
S.O.S. emergency,
Sinking fast and getting worse.

Where's your honest men?
In some village, far away,
Or in a little town pub.
High on a mountain top
There must be an honest man
Calling all honest men

Throw out the tyrants,
The aged fat cats
Outlived their usefulness
They have led us to this mess
Make them answer,
Hold them to their promises,
And throw them in the street
If they won't tell the truth

S.O.S. and red alert
All across the universe,
Calling all honest men
S.O.S. emergency,
Sinking fast and getting worse,
Where's your honest men?
To your stations,
Man the ramparts,
The barricades
We need new heroes urgently

We need a few good honest men
Calling all honest men
Calling all honest men
Call to him
He lives next door,
Across the street
On the upper floor.

It's our only hope we need him now
Send the S.O.S. and red alert,
All across the universe,
Calling all honest men
S.O.S. emergency,
Sinking fast and getting worse,
Where's your honest men
Strike a blow,
Save the ship,
We need a few good honest men
Calling all honest men
Calling all honest men
Calling all honest men
S.O.S. across the universe
Where's your honest
We need your honest
Calling all honest men

Calling out all over the world,
Where's your honest men
Looking out all over the world,
We need your honest men",Honest Men,1990
"Electric Light Orchestra, Part II","I could paint your picture in the sky tonight
Your lips stick on the moon in pastel light

So kiss me red
Kiss me rouge

Kiss me smooth

"Electric Light Orchestra, Part II","Meeting you in the park and talking in the pouring rain
(oh what a time we had)
Running home in the dark and pretending it was all a game
(oh what a time)
Those were the days, those were the days

Memories of you have really left a scar
And all that i can do now is to love you from afar
'cos everything was fine
That once upon a time

Asking you if you'd stay, not believing that you might
(oh what a time we had)
Missing you through the day, dreaming of you through the night
(oh what a time)
Those were the days, those were the days

Though there's no denying that you're nowhere around
I can't help myself from looking for your face amongst the crowd
'cos everything was fine, that once upon a time

Have to leave the past behind me and get on the right track
Though there's nothing i can say that will ever bring you back
But everything was fine, that once upon a time

I wish i knew for how much longer this misery will last
Can't control these feelings, i'm still living in the past
'cos everything was fine, that once upon a time
I've got to build my life again, try to find somebody new
But i know inside my heart of hearts there'll be no replacing you
But everything was fine, that once upon a time

"Electric Light Orchestra, Part II","Chorus
The night has a thousand eyes
And they're all on you
The night has a thousand ears
Listening to your cries
Let it work its magic
Let it work its magic
The night has a thousand eyes

Verse 1
You, you had to slip away
After all that spark
You, said all that you could say
And slipped into the dark
I could not let you go
Alone into the night
I had to let you know

The magic there, in the night air

Chorus
The night has a thousand eyes
And they're all on you
The night has a thousand ears
Listening to your cries
Let it work its magic

Verse 2
You, somewhere out in the dark
Runs a wounded heart
You, stumbling in the night
In the air of after light
You take along the fears
Did you waste these years,
And did they warn you
Of the night zone all alone

Sometimes it takes a fight
To keep everything on track,
And sometimes it takes a starry night
To bring the magic back
This was the time
And this was the place
With starlight on your face
And the moon on the rise,
The night has a thousand eyes

"Electric Light Orchestra, Part II","I wait till everyone`s asleep
Then out into the night I creep
No one can see me now
Or hear me running, soundlessly

The moon`s the only light I need
To search for food, young ones to feed
But as the dawn is drawing near the earth, my way`s not clear
I`m trapped on the outside

Moonlight save me, moonlight save me
Moonlight save me, moonlight save me

Unearthly fear, it grips my skin
Unearthly sound, the hunt begins
I hear excited cries
But dare not look from where I`m hiding

The multi-coloured humans ride
Soon they will find me where I hide
The brown and white tormentors
Begin to howl and then I`m running

Moonlight save me
I cut across the trail I left five miles before
One chance to throw them off my scent but I`m not sure
An elder told me it had worked sometime before

My heart is beating like a drum
I make the ridge, but can`t go on
I turn to face my death
But nothing comes to stop me breathing

Down in the clearing now I see
They`re searching all around for me
Confusion everywhere
But I am safe up here, I`ve won, I`ve won, I`ve won, I`ve won, I`ve won",The Fox,1994

And skeletons of lives that I used to label mine

And I've lost my tongue and I've lost all my friends
And I can't remember if I give a damn

We peek from the edge of an old rusty bridge
And down in the water is the house where we were raised
And over where the trees and gardens used to be
Are remnants of pictures we still carry in our minds

And you've lost your mind and you've lost all your plans
And I can't quite tell if you even give a damn

My mind was built for lies
And your laugh sounds like glass, and it cuts right
Through me

Dreaming is not a one way process

You wanted problems? you got 'em
You got enough to break down anyone
You want to prove that you're the tough kind
But no one asks to be a martyr; it just happens to you
You say we've got it wrong, that you're different
Well, call it what you want, it's same difference
You bit off more than you can chew with this
Now we're calling in the debt
No matter if it sinks you

Daylight breaks and the world looks bent
Like I've got shotglass eyes
Pick me up, fix my tie, roll me toward the cliffside
I don't mind if I fall this time
My knees were built for scabs
And my hands meet demands just when no one's asking

Dreaming is not a one way process

We woke just before the dawn, got dressed up among
Birdsong
Then crossed that eternal lawn
Our heads were pointed skyward, and the sun, it warmed
Our backs
And we wandered, not really knowing where it all would
End
We walked 'til the sun went down, walked straight
Toward that violent sound
The waves threw their weight around
And it all felt so simple, like we knew just how to be
And we smiled, 'til the waves came and dragged us out
To sea",Nightmare No. 5 or 6,2010
Electric President,"It's hard to get a solid breath down here
My lungs are burning
The pressure is as thick as my fear
But it's worth what I'm learning
Cause down in these depths I can see
Our history unfurling
Come I'll show you what we've lost

Light's just a memory down here
Like lost change in couches
There's nothing for as far as I can see
But remnants of houses
Up and down up
Up empty streets
I count the empty cars
And the sky scrapers don't scrape the fan anymore

The earth reclaims these holes
Dug this world in as its own
Now it grows along the bones
There's light from what we'd saw

There are worlds beneath our world
And deep beneath the skin
We always peel the layers back again
We peel the layers back again

We peel the layers back again (repeat)",The Ocean Floor,2010
Electric President,"You took your hits with the bruises on the soles of
your feet
Well who's to say if they're deserved? But you're
turning reckless now
I heard you saying through your teeth, that you'll take
them down first

But I saw you flinch, when the doctors got the claws in
you
I saw your smile start to crack
It's not so funny when you're sunk and there ain't
nothing you can do
And your options are all dead ends

But there's no way out
I'll let you build your home with me till the clocks
run down
When your looks run out
Call me and I will come and fix you get your feet on
the ground
When there's no way out
Call me and I will come and bury you all safe and sound

And all this time you've been drifting out with the
tide my friend

But you can have what's mine if it helps you stay
afloat
If I close my eyes I can't watch you drown anymore my
friend
But I'll tell you lies if it helps you sleep at night
And the more we fight, the more we don't get right
And the more we fight, the more we don't get right

Heard they broke you
That you gave in
That you dropped
And the fight had left you

But don't you worry
Makes no difference
From the start
Your options were all dead ends

When there's no way out
I'll let you build your home with me till the clocks

Electric President,"The fog rolls on in from the sea
Like a curtain draped from the bolts of heaven
And out here the moon burns through the night
Like the eyes of strays caught in headlights
And I hear you hum a song I'd written
And the condensation collects on my feet
And my lungs contract as the curtain thickens
And I hear you say you'd like to see what's down beneath the violent blue
And as you say those words my legs turn leaden

And your teeth are two white smears that cut the gray
Like light behind the clouds
And my heart is flapping like a bird that's trapped inside a wire cage
I hear you laughing, saying:
""Darlin', there's no need to fear. You know how to swim.""

Well, let's see how well I do

This blue ain't blue
It's velvet black
A crooked mirror sky
And we hum like stars
And flicker off into the blank and void

I feel your limbs; they pull me down
And now we're too far gone

This is how we gon' do it
I mean I making grass grow baby, ya know
Seeds become plants
Boys become men
Want we gon' do

Wrapped around our girls like pashminas
Whats my demeanor
The grass is always greener on the other side
To think of I cant give her a ring up
I couldn't give a fuck
I could I give a finger
Let alone half baths and closets
So claustrophobic if there were close objects
Now its sort of like two door garages
Its like two broads minagin'
Your the best mama!

Is there any chance
That you remember me being any more than just a horrible man
And would you consider
Pullin' this trigger
And taking a second shot at romance
Oh Babe,
I want the days when you were my girl
And I was your man,
Know I took you for granted,
But it wasn't until now I see how much I miss you
Girl I'm sorry that I ran the streets acting like a damn fool, yeah
But for once, here goes the truth

I can't be fake I can't be phonie
Acting all hard thats the niggas thats lonely
I tried to flex but I confess that when you left you took the very best thing
The best things that ever happened to me
You took my best thing,
The best thing that I ever seen
You took the best thing that I ever seen
You took the, the best thing that I ever had
And now all I feel is stress cause when you left you took the very best

Remember Mimi or Vita, remember Isha or Eva
I ain't got em no more, hey yes
Niomi or Jenny, the same outcome is chillin'
Girl, I let em all go
No more trickin' and kissin' miscellaneous chicks
Acting like a jerk, woman I been to church
And I talked to the bishop and he wanted me to share this with ya
How much I miss you

I'm so sorry that I ran the streets acting like a damn fool

I can't be fake I can't be phonie

You took the best thing that I ever seen
You took the, the best thing that I ever had
And now all I feel is stress cause when you left you took the very best

Mama tried t o told me
Hovie Hov better slow it down
You gon' lose your best thing
If you keep gettin' round
Like PAC needed pot
When you old to hold you down
Ma forever young was forever numb
Sorry states are sorry done
Your million and all of them
All of em was funny time
It wasn't you it was him
School me once school me twice
Three times and I was dumb
Now its so plant the seed in me
I got the one

Love flew out again

You took my heart and threw my heart away

",Out of My League,1996
Electronic,"I use to think that I was lonely
When I was a young boy
Doing what they told me
(Living rather coldly)
Too many lessons in the school class
Stated my allegiance
Mixing with the wrong class
I lived at home with all my family
Even had my own key
It was given to me
(Parents listened to me)
Allowed to be alone
(Then left me alone)
There was never any friction
Starring in my own film
(A starring role in my film)
It was my addiction
(It was science fiction)
You don't have to wait
The world will carry on
It's there in your face
But it won't stay for long
Let's be a nation
And sit upon a throne
Don't ever hesitate
Just carry on
The older boys were rather surly
Living in the wrong place
Made me grow up early
But it was my home
As I complete my own existence
Staring at my own life
(I look at the old one)
Fading in the distance
Down a semitone
Smiling faces of the neighbors
Proud of their endeavors
Unemployed forever watch TV at home
You don't have to wait
The world will carry on
It's there in your face
But it won't stay for long
Let's be a nation
And sit upon a throne
Don't ever hesitate
Just carry on

Tears on your shoulder
Don't go too far
Surrender me unharmed

Remains inside
Two hearts broken
Lay (set) down by the river side

City dealers at an auction shares are falling fast
Suicide is not an option waiting for the crash

Desert states are praying for the rains to fall

Goodbye bombs we're gonna miss you

These hollow words
Make a wrong arrest
They beat upon my door
A spirit haunts forever more

But still I hope
And sometimes I pray
It won't be hard
We'll find a way

Color my dream
Show me I'm real
Turn on the light
Then let me feel

Can we meet on the street
Maybe tomorrow
See the world at our feet
Naked and hollow

Every rule that you make",For You [DVD][*],2006

And rode into the ghostly night
It was wide, wide open, wide, wide open

I left the only home I knew
I stayed alive and I found you
Now I take you where the water's deep
And make the air you breathe so sweet

But is it not enough to be complete? Please?
Let me give you everything you need, please?

We found a way, we found a street
Directions sweat under the sheets
And I let you have it, let you have it

But it can be a lonely place
Desire comes, desire fades
There's a bright one caught your fancy eye
It's okay so long as you stay mine

And I'm so number one that it's a shame, a shame
That you let other numbers in the game

Now I suffer for your hungry eye
Oh why must it see more than mine?
It's a light you're after, 'cause light moves faster

But when I ride again into the night
My torch will shoot flames strong and bright
And my absence will remind you of
How tough it is to be in love

And it's not what I think it's what you say, hey
And it works great for you to have your way, hey

But if the west can be a desperate place
You search all day for just a taste
Of the cold, cold water, cold, cold water

And if you think I've gone too long

As it burns up all the memories
That flow like water out of me",Cold Cold Water,2006

Cuando no buscaba nada te encontré

Entre amores de mentiras, entre besos de papel
Y yo que no creía en cuentos de hadas
Ni en princesas encantadas, no me pude defender

Y eres tú, solo tú, la que me lleva a la luna
La que calma mi locura, la que me quema la piel

Y eres tú, siempre tú, ángel de la madrugada
El tatuaje de mi alma, para siempre te encontré

Me colgué de tu mirada, me quedé con tu sonrisa
Si te vas no existe nada, si te vas
Y ahora sé, sólo sé, te cruzaste en mi camino
Encontré el paraíso y me quedé

Y yo que no creía en cuentos de hadas

Steals across the meadows of my heart

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust [Instrumental],2002

And it pains me so much to tell
That you don't know me that well

And though my love is rare
Though my love is true

It's not that I want to say goodbye
It's just that every time you try to tell me, me, me that you love me
Each and every single day I know
I'm going to have to eventually give you away

And though my love is rare
And though my love is true
Hey, I'm just scared
That we may fall through

My demeanor’s so smooth it should illegal.
Follow the Pirelli’s as I pop a bottle, 
Pinky blinging, wrist glinging as I floss with models
Black tux, the wind surfs the waves of my hair
Fancy free without a care causing women to stare
They love it but you hate, they hate it but you love it
A young Warren Buffet without a budget
Feel the plush leather seats of Bentley coupes
A young Black millionaire, yes, I’m living proof.

Coz I fall so deep
You'll never know how far ill go
And I know why hearts fall desperately
I fall so deep

Some people think love is foolish
While others think its a game
But I think that love is a fire
And I'm burning up in flames

I'm so lost in my emotions
Wanting you evermore.....yes...

Where I feel my heart give in
But I lose my nerve

To tell you that its true

Elena Bennett,"At last, my love has come along
my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

I found a dream that I could speak to,

I used to say
A game I thought I'd never play

Throwing caution to the wind

Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head.
Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

Mm-mm-mm-mm
Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Fools rush in where wise men never, never, never go
Eh, but wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
Ah, when we met, girl, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Elena Bennett,"In a dream the strangest and the oddest things appear
And what insane and silly things we do
Here is what I see before me, vividly and clear
As I recall it, you were in it, too

I had the craziest dream last night, yes I did
I never dreamt it could be
Yet there you were, in love with me
I found your lips close to mine so I kissed you
And you didn't mind it at all
When I'm awake such a break never happens
How long can a gal go on dreaming?

Then, please, say you do, Baby
Say it and make my craziest dream come true",I Had the Craziest Dream,1999

Oh, you crazy moon, what did you do?
And when they kissed, 
They tried to say that it was just in fun
Oh, you crazy moon, look what you've done

Once you promised me, you know, that it would never end
You should be ashamed to show your funny face, my friend

There they are, they fell in love, 
I guess you think that you're smart
Oh, you crazy moon, you broke my heart

Elena Bennett,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You,1999
Elena Coats,"You and I, we're like fireworks and symphonies exploding in the sky
With you, I'm alive

Without you, I feel broke
Like I'm half of a whole
Without you, I've got no hand to hold
Without you, I feel torn
Like a sail in a storm
Without you, I'm just a sad song
I'm just a sad song

With you, I fall
It's like I'm leaving all my past and silhouettes up on the wall
With you, I'm a beautiful mess
It's like we're standing hand and hand with all our fears up on the edge

Hypnotic,
You get your kick off
With little bit a hip hop
We rock the rooftop
The super sounds that you love
Zap, we back
And pappa's got a brand new bag
Full of tricks, beat the kicks
Rocking and shocking the hops the hips
The funky chicks
We change the riffs
Fashion, passion, misfits
Stand up proud, have no doubt,
Come on, shout it out!
I'm the real deal when I come around,
I freak you out, coming over ground

Ooh, how you make me feel
Hypnotic, hypnotic
Ooh, cast a spell on me,
Hypnotic (get ready!), hypnotic (jump on it!)

You get your kick off
With little bit a hip hop
We rock the rooftop
The super sounds that you love

I'm so blinded by the dazzling lights
I'm only guided by rhythms of the night
Hot bodies all around
Make me think I've found, the beat
And a heart synchronized (??) with mine

Ooh, how you make me feel

Ooh, cast a spell on me,

You get your kick off
With little bit a hip hop
We rock the rooftop
The super sounds that you love

Bound, to break
The boundaries, the estimate
The fool's roots
We overtake, we renegades stormin' the place
Breakin' and shakin' and chasing the bass
Bringin' it up on the front page
We're back, on time that is the sound
Come on, freak, sing it out

I freak you out, comin over ground

Ooh, how you make me feel

Ooh, cast a spell on me,
Hypnotic (get ready!), hypnotic (jump on it!)

Thrills, the chills, dominate the sex appeal,
Surreal, with the funk I feel, rebellious rockers acting ill.
Escapades and matinee's the breaks from the rat race,
The sound, the scratch, electroclash, the revelation, kickin' ya ass!!
The new phenomenon taking over town,
Feel the force, coming over ground.

I feel so electric, it really blows my mind
The kind of electric, I just take off and fly
Hot bodies all around
Make me think I've found, the beat
And a heart synchronized (??) with mine

Ooh, how you make me feel
Hypnotic (get ready!), hypnotic (jump on it!)
Ooh, cast a spell on me,
Hypnotic (get ready!), hypnotic (jump on it!)

Ooh, how you make me feel
Hypnotic, hypnotic
Ooh, cast a spell on me,
Hypnotic, hypnotic

Ay-yeah-yeah, anchors

Complicated man sits, dedicated to the rudder
Under Apollo, over feeling under as I swallow, Wadjet wallows
It's said he looks for Yetis in tomorrow
And do-gooders become regretters for giving gobble
At the Oshawa in Park Slope
Broken dancers rather flatten carbos than work at Arco
Flippers who feat feets riff contortionists hips and Greece slippers
Tweezers release slithers
From lines with deep splinters, paws for sweet skippers
Another key-figure's of East River's who eat liver and drink liquor
And root for bird due to an unconscious urge to beat niggas
Who prefer sweet, steep sleep and to pour holes 
With the ease of police triggers
Sikhs at the hair show, Arabs at the airport
Caucasians in the projects, niggas anywhere though

Pull out game strong like the Waco Kid, but also like a life-guard
Now that don't even make no sense—but since
If the swimmers ain't got no rings on
Don't be a fag, let me stab that yoo-hoo with my ding-dong
Fruits of interracials, my banana's bigger than King Kong
Both ways seem wrong like nobody in China is good at ping-pong
Seem wrong? That's evidence they shouldn't be passing their genes on
That was racist, but I'ma run with it
Like every sagging pair of pants has to have a gun in it
So I undid it, like a Singapore with gum in it
Does that mean if I let you ride it I can put my thumbs in it?
Uhn—nasty, but let the moment pass, only wave if they ask
And catch me at the scene of the crash, karma
They hate blood like Blade, so they hate 'cuz like an English teacher grades

Looks cool but it's bull as cool fusers
And the abuse is fueled of duel-losers
To make fools of the schools and pool Bueller's
The crusade to legislate oxygen
And put it in a box just like Desiree Washington
Fortune cookie, First Panda accelerated profit
And hope Santa fill my socks with highly-decorated moccasins
My, how the roles have reversed
So now we gotta eat 'em for dessert
Bop the kids just to free 'em from the curse
Dress up the thots in lingerie and feed 'em to Levert (uh-huh)

'Bout what makes a man a man
Was it brain or brawn, or the month you were born
We just couldn't understand

Our old man didn't like our appearance
He said that only women wear long hair

So me and my brother borrowed money from Mother
We knew what we had to do
We went downstairs, past the barber and gymnasium
And got our arms tattooed

Welcome to my life, tattoo
I'm a man now, thanks to you
I expect I'll regret you
But the skin graft man won't get you
You'll be there when I die

But my mother naturally liked it and beat my brother
'Cause his tattoo was of a lady in the nude
And my mother thought that was extremely rude

Always done it before
And he laughed
Always do it some more

He lied when he kicked
When he broke with a shout
Then he took me by the hand and he dragged me all about

Through the alleys and the gutters
Down the cold, hard streets

Said I, yes, I, oh, I should've known

When he stole my heart
He lied, oh, he lied to me
He lied when he switched
When he broke with his teeth
Then he brought this fruit and he laid it at my feet

When he kissed my cheek

Got engaged in the summer, getting married this fall

Got a sparkle in your eye and a big wide grin

Light behind the door

Time is wiser everybody knows
Hands will come together gloveless
When I get home hands will hold

The river runs the bridge's lights
The road rides like a drum
And I love an American boy

Oh, shallow pockets
Darkened eyes and heavy hearts and coats

I dreamed of sunny days when we'd be together
I never could have guessed that it would end

You were so careless, you were so reckless
With words of love so sweet, I never did suspect it
You'd cross the county line and it was like we never met

Woe is you, you got so scared that you nearly went crazy

I ask the heavens for explanations
I close my eyes and wish on the constellations

Not so easy when I want you more

In the blazing afternoon

You kissed me on the lips
We had lingered after dark
Were walking in the puddles
Making footprints on the sidewalk

Oh no, that was just a dream that I had
Oh no, it didn't happen like that

One man, so dark, so sad
It didn't happen at all

We had lost our space and time
Sitting on my gold couch
All our fingers intertwined

I wonder how soft are your lips
Do you still think about girls from last week?

Death-like calm comes creeping by
These are not tears falling from my eyes
Just little birds singing miss me, miss me, miss me

Sounds like angels underground
Falling fast, they gasp and drown
Windows are open, invite me to fly
So I'll jump out and try, miss me, miss me

Hungry for peace
I am for thirsty for something sweet

Sounds like morning's come to cry
Gentle night says soft goodbye
These are my ships sinking, prayers drift by
Waving their handkerchiefs, miss me, miss me, miss me

201 victims were killed
Was my twin among the dead?

I was here at home waiting for my twin to return

All these men and women gone
Rocked from the sky by a terrible storm
Was my twin among the many?
Was my twin at peace and ready?
I was here at home waiting for my twin to return

We never met but I believe my twin's out there
And he's looking for me sharp and quick
He'll compliment my slow, dull existence

Living, breathing at the same time and then
I see your reflection in the glass as you leave
Every airplane landing carries you here.
Don’t say no, darling, don’t say no.

Will you tell me what you’ve seen?
Cars and buses filled with faces from magazines.
I feel your fingers as the wind blows through
Barely reaching out, I’m touching you.
Don’t say no, baby, don’t say no.
Don’t say no, baby, don’t say no.

I’ve been wondering since the day I was born
I found the answer in the rain, in the garden, the waves on the shore.

I’ve been coming home to stay
Have you always been just light years away?

A golden badge and rolling hills living pointless station.

Eleni Mandell,"I saw your face last night,
It didn’t mean that much,
But still I have to wonder
Where did all these feelings grow.

It was so hard to part,
But then you turn around
And fell in love with someone else,
I didn’t think you’d let me go.

I’m looking to look for.

You really look the same,
And when you came to say hello
You put your arm around me
Just the way you used to do.

Bones beneath your shirt,
Your pants an inch too short.
You smile, that boy, you smile
I always loved the mug above your upper lip.

I’m looking to look for,
I’m looking to look for.

It’s so easy to forget
Sometimes it’s like we never met.

And when you turned away
You said you’d see me later,
Watch you walk into the cloud,
That was when all the lights went down.

Like a life, went through a looking glass
You opened up your mouth
To see a different man,
All these years came rushing by.

I’m looking to look for,
I’m looking to look for.

It’s strange how close we used to be
This life can be so bittersweet.

I know we’re better off,
I watched you smoke your cigarette
And there’s a girl stage left,
She’s waiting for you in the dark.

When we say goodbye
I wanna laugh the laughs we used to laugh
Instead, we make a plan for a coffee
That we’ll never have.

I'm light skin, redbone,
Peanut butter complexion
Very affectionate, very direct
When I'm expressing myself
I'm 5'5""
My astrology sign is aries
Thick in my thighs, 36Bs
Pretty brown eyes, no hair weaves
Put it down with hese lucious suckable
Lips
Making you want to reach out and touch'em
Come on and give me a kiss
Could it be those hips just pokin out of my jeans
I showed them once or twice
And some niggas have become feems 
I'm a javouci rocking, hat cockin,
Blunt smoking
No stopping, weave cocking
With constant heat dropping
Bombs on nonbelievers charming
All the people
They call it the life of leisure
I'm preaching what I'm speaking
This shit you ain't used to seeing
So please believe it you needin the be	
To the are muthafucking AT

I search to find the love within
I came back to let you know
I gotta thing for you
And I can't let it go
I'm steppin in the club now ya'll
Hey now
niggas showing me love ya'll
Hey now
I rapp for my thugs ya'll, hey now
Especially my niggas,
They got the ouoo!
I'd be sitting in my car waiting on you
To drop off my package
A big zipped locked baggy to support my habit
We'll go together like roger
And jessica rabbit
I'm spoiled rotten,
I'm rocking pink silk panties
At the moment
But I'm sport cotton
But jeanie's dreamin of
Jeanie will blink me to scottie
So he can beam me pump adrenaline
Into my blook steam
Proceed extremely with caution
I'm probably gleaming
Because my bling bling is
Worth a fortune
It seems things will never change
So I puffed often cause these dayz,
niggas is crazy
You can't pay me to roll without my AK
I guess you wonder where I've been
I search to find the love within
I came back to let you know
I gotta thing for you
And I can't let it go
I can't let go of this game
I can't let go of this fame
But for sure, before I go
You niggas gonna know my name
Cause I'm so doogie, one in a million
Cop a brazzillion for the coochie
That rides smoothly
Pass the doogie, the dutchie
Rudely interrupted, your regularly
Scheduled program

For the battle
Head to head
MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE!

To the cobra

In that tree""

Consider him who endured such opposition from sinful men,

Awake in a dream I believe it's extreme
Ruling out that all this is magic

Why do we dance on the wheel and forget
Life is a child that will never regret
Learning to be, be, be
Sometimes I feel like the distance ain't real
And the watch in my hand is tragic
Sometimes I think that eternity blinks

In the fabric of father space-time

Through clouds of storm and slowed down light

Is picking a lock as the mossy trees talk
Awakened in a pond the turtle comes forth
With promise of action as secrets unfold
Sleepers are walking with blindfold and book
A push through the fabric is all that it took

In a whirlwind of truth the center was clear
On the back of a turtle I waded through fear
Heavy is the dream as I burn in the sun

Heavy is the dream as I fall just for fun
Zooming out from an endless flight
Through oceans of doubt and left here or right
The master of illusions in a field on a stone
Is setting a trap in a bull's hip bone
Always on it's toes the turtle sees all
With mouthfuls of brilliance she gives me the ball

With a mouthful of water I can break through a stone

Reach out just to smile at my father

Eleven,"Back at home in glowing caves
He filled the walls in a Shaman's haze
The hunt was good His fellow beings
Layed down their bones for no extremes
He was cursing at the sky
With carving on his skin
The wind and thunder howling

And yet there was no sin
But soon his mind expanded to let more symbols in
Now drowning in his choices
The future makes him grin
A runaway, runaway train getting off the track
A runaway, runaway brain with too much on his back
He cast the net on nature's shore
And in excess he wanted more

He burned the land to have more room
In ugly towns he planned his doom
He was laughing at the few
Who saw what was ahead
And a corporating crew lived for today instead
Now the bridge can fall
It leads him back to reason
Ignoring this here ball
He signs a pact of treason",Runaway,1993

O mother, hear a suppliant child

The flinty couch whereon we're sleeping
Shall seem with down of eider piled,
If thou above, sweet, watch our keeping
The murky cavern's air's so heavy
Shall breathe of balm if thou hast smiled
O maiden hear a maiden's pleading
O mother, hear a suppliant child

Ave Maria Stainless styled
O fiends of air and earth the essence
From this their wonted haunt exiled
Shall flee before thy holy presence

To thy dear guidance reconciled

And for a father hear a child

A face so laced with doubt and daily pain
It used to be mine
A breath so spent on holding up the wait

All falls away, all falls away
All falls away, all falls away

It used to be mine
A head so full of memories never lived
It used to be mine
And island that the map said wasn't there

She loses her beautiful self to the world

Loses her beautiful self to the world

Her life is an easel, framing what no one has found

Eli,"I heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the lord
But you don't really care for music, do you
Well it goes like this the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah...

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
And she tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah...

Baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
But love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah...

Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do you
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah...

Well, maybe there is a God above
But all I've ever learnt from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah...
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah...",Hallelujah,2004

Was a man who passed away 
St.Peter met him at the gate
Pete said: Walk with me if you will
I'll take you to the house you built
Man said I can't wait

Passed a mansion made of stone
But with each new house he's shown
They get smaller by degrees
Stopped in front of a two room shack
Pete said: Hope you're happy with that
Man said: How can this be?
Pete sai

That's all the lumber, that's all the lumber, 
That's all the lumber you sent
Looks like the builder, man He's got your number
That's all the lumber you sent

Man didn't know what to say
Poor guy was blown away
Said: You mean this is what I deserve?
Pete said: I'm afraid it's so
It's too late but now you know
Shoulda done better work

Man said: You mean not lie and cheat
And helpin' old ladies across the street?
Pete said: Well, that's a start 
Remember that man back in that great big house?
He found out early what it's all about
Built that place with his heart - as for you

That's all the lumber, that's all the lumber, 
That's all the lumber you sent
Looks like the builder, man He's got your number
That's all the lumber you sent

What if that man was me
And I'd failed that miserably
You're showin' me things I don't wanna see

St. Peter if you can send me back to earth again
Is that somethin' you can do?
Pete said: It ain't up to me
If it was I'd like to see 
How you plan to improve

Man said: I'd love God and fellow man
Take a wife and make a stand
Be the givin'est guy I can be
And when I get back to this neighborhood
There'd be a gigantic pile of wood
And I'd say : What's this I see? 
And you'd tell me :

That's all the lumber - all that's your lumber
That's all the lumber you sent
Well the Big Boss'll help you 
Hammer it all together

In this broke down used up town
Bled my heart on these city streets
As strangers lay their money down

Now I look into that great big blue
Feel nothing I've felt before
I'm alone

So I'll shake some hands
Chase that calling star
I'm gonna drive so fast
I can only drive so far
Gonna lay my bricks
And park my car
Gonna sow my seeds somewhere
But home is where you are

See your washed out faded smiles
When I look back on this place
All that held me as a child
Is begging me to stay
But I'm gone

Eli Barsi,"Well I was born in a small town
And I live in a small town
Probably die in a small town
Oh, those small communities

All my friends are so small town
My parents live in the same small town
My job is so small town
Provides little opportunity

Educated in a small town
Taught the fear of Jesus in a small town
Used to daydream in that small town
Another boring romantic that's me

But I've seen it all in a small town
Had myself a ball in a small town
Married an L.A. doll and brought her to this small town
Now she's small town just like me

No I cannot forget where it is that I come from
I cannot forget the people who love me
Yeah, I can be myself here in this small town
And people let me be just what I want to be

Got nothing against a big town
Still hayseed enough to say
Look who's in the big town
But my bed is in a small town

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2005

All we do crumbles to the ground though we refuse to see

The shirt that's on my back, and an beat up Rangers cap
200 miles to go, who would believe that,
I would go this far, without turning back

And I know, this life I'll lead will beat on my soul
But I'll still have my pride

Hitting all the cities, neon sign to neon sign
Drowning in straight bourbon whiskey, beer and too much wine
Playing our songs for nothing but that bottom line

But on that stage each night, were captured by the sound
Singing these songs we write, to a different town
'Cause there are people who believe in what we've found
They like the song we sing and that's why we hang around

So Here I go, packing light to head down that road
And I know, this life I'll lead will beat on my soul
But I'll still have my pride
Nothing But That Bottom Line

Thirty Years from now on that marquee sign
You'll see our name lit up misspelled, and live tonight
But we don't care, cause we play music that we like
Almost for free, for nothing but that bottom line

And I know, this life I'll lead will beat on my soul
But I'll still have my pride

",So Close Now,2009
Eli Young Band,"That's The Way

I sit here in my bed, with you in my head, haunting my mind
I think of all we had, all the good and bad and all of the times
We'd sit down and talk, sometimes till three or four o'clock in the morning

I live in misery, haunted by your memory, and the love that I felt
Guess that was not enough, you fell out of love, something you couldn't help
I guess now I see; that's the way it's gotta be

Chorus:
Fates got a plan for us, even when our lives get rough
You make up, break up, you fall, you get back up
Can't you see; that's the way it's gotta be

We run around these streets, looking for company, someone to hold
At the end of the night, we give up our fights, and go home alone
We give up on love, and we say we've had enough of the game

Fates got a plan for us, even when our lives get rough
You make up, break up, you fall, you get back up
Can't you see; that's the way it's gotta be

We walk around in circles, were all just jumping hurdles, just trying to get by
We take life in stride, and swallow our pride, all to survive
Can't you see; that's the way it's gotta be

Fates got a plan for us, even when our lives get rough
You make up, break up, you fall, you get back up
Can't you see; that's the way it's gotta be

When it rains, I don't mind being lonely, I cry right along with the sky
When it rains, I don't pretend to be happy, I don't even have to try
When it rains, Some people get down, They're sporting a frown, so I fit right in
Yeah, the sun may brighten your day but if I had my way, I'd take the rain

I don't care about politics or the hypocrites on my TV
I'm not mad at the girl who left because she couldn't be with me
So make up your theories about the scandals and the lies
Start out depressed then everything comes as a pleasant surprise

When it rains, I don't mind being lonely, I cry right along with the sky

And I bought into that young man's life
Looking back now I realize
I still don't know exactly what it was
It sure felt a lot like love

And I wasted good years running 'round
Trying to be the king of this old town
Always moving onto something new
The time goes by and I'm still here
And all the new has disappeared
Finally I'm forced to face the truth

Out of all the memories, good and bad
Still find myself looking for what we had
I always thought I'd find a better one
And I bought into that young man's life
Looking back now I realize
I still don't know exactly what it was
It sure felt a lot like love

Do you every think about me?
Do you ever feel the same?
Am I just a faded picture
In a broke and dusty frame?

Out of all the memories, good and bad
Still find myself looking for what we had
I always thought I'd find a better one

Eli Young Band,"Judgement day is finally here
Time to testify my dear
Cheating ain't your only crime
You killed love, stole my time

Thank God I learned what you are
Before we went too far

Hallelujah and amen
For the lies I caught you in
Funny how your sin led to my salvation
We were this close to our due
Almost sold my soul to you
Praise the Lord for guilty hands and revelations

I might not have caught on to you
But you left a trail of clues
Working late, hung up calls
Hotel keys and paper-thin walls

And there's no good reason why
You've got no alibi

Hallelujah and amen
For the lies I caught you in
Funny how your sin led to my salvation
We were this close to our due
Almost sold my soul to you
Praise the Lord for guilty hands and revelations

I want to shout and clap my hands
'Cause you make me one happy man

Hallelujah and amen
For the lies I caught you in
Funny how your sin led to my salvation
We were this close to our due
Almost sold my soul to you

As we both sat there at the end of the line
It's not like either of us didn't fight
When the bell was ringing
When we went down swinging, you know

I never thought we'd be one more tragedy
You and me, we're supposed to beat the odds
When you stick it out or when you don't give in
Or when you give it everything you've got
When you hold on through thick and through thin
And when that kind of love doesn't win, what does?
What does?

I think the hardest part of it all
Is that you won't be there after we fall
You'll just be a memory that hangs on my wall
Of a good thing gone
Of a right gone wrong, you know

I never thought we'd be one more tragedy
You and me, we're supposed to beat the odds
When you stick it out or when you don't give in
Or when you give it everything you've got

Say goodbye to goodbye, I ain't ever gonna change my mind

Just let down your wall, I'll be your wrecking ball

Eli Young Band,"I found it outside of Birmingham headed to another place
Took me five hundred miles to get to the bottom of my suitcase
It was in between a pair of jeans and my old black winter coat
It took my breath away when I read what she wrote

May the wheels keep turning, get you where you need to go
I'll keep the porch light burning til you get back home
May angels fly beside you, down every mile you roll
May heaven hear this prayer, prayer for the road

As much as she misses me, she found the words to write
Enough to keep me warm on a cold December night
And when I'm running on empty and I'm feeling lost
I can hear her voice, whispering to God

May the wheels keep turning, get you where you need to go
I'll keep the porch light burning til you get back home
Baby, angels fly beside you, down every mile you roll
May heaven hear this prayer, prayer for the road

Must have read that note at least a thousand times
It always takes me where the highway meets the sky

Or a rocketship into outer space

To ever make it feel
Like yesterday did

Separate paths, separate ways
If we blame it on anything
Let's blame it on the rain

I knew it all along
I'd have to write this song
Too young to fall in love
Guess we knew it all along

Down from L.A.
They were shooting pool all night
Sleeping half of the day
They said I could crash
If I could find my own way
I told them you were leaving
On a bus to go away

Eliades Ochoa,"Sus ojos se cerraron y el mundo sigue andando
Su boca que era mía ya no me besa mas
Se apagaron los ecos de su reír sonoro
Y es cruel este silencio que me haré tanto mal
Fue mía la piadosa dulzura de sus manos
Que dieron a mis penas caricias de bondad
Y ahora que la evoco hundido en mi quebranto
Las lagrimas trenzadas se niegan a brotar
Y no tengo el consuelo de poder llorar

¿Porque sus alas tan cruel quemó la vida
Por que esta mueca siniestra de la suerte? 
Quise abrigarla y mas pudo la muerte
Como me duele y se ahonda mi herida
Yo se que ahora vendrán caras extrañas
Con su limosna de alivio a mi quebranto
Todo es mentira, mentira es el lamento
Hoy esta solo mi corazón
Como perros de presa las penas traicioneras

Celando mi cariño galopaban detrás
Y escondida en las aguas de su mirada buena
La muerte agazapada marcaba su compás
En vano yo alentaba febril una esperanza
Clavó en mi carne viva sus garras el dolor
y mientras en la calle en loca algarabía
El carnaval del mundo gozaba y se reía
Burlándose el destino me robo su amor

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin
Then you'll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh

Elias Barreiro,"If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me
Understand
'Cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just
Holding hands

If I give my heart
To you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you
Would love me more than her

If I trust in you
Oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too
Oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her

'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I
Would be sad

Will cry

Elias Barreiro,"There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more

Elias Haslanger,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss

The soda water fountain 
Where the lemonade springs and the bluebird sings 
In that Big Rock Candy Mountain

On a summer day in the month of May
A burly bum came a hiking 
Down a shady lane through the sugar cane
He was looking for his liking
As he strolled along he sang a song of the land of milk and honey
Where a bum can stay for many a day
And he won't need any money

Oh, the buzzin' of the bees in the cigarette trees

Where the lemonade springs and the bluebird sings 
In that Big Rock Candy Mountain

The bulldogs all have rubber teeth
And the hens lay soft-boiled eggs
The farmers' trees are full of fruit
The barns are full of hay

Where the sleet don't fall and the wind don't blow

Yo solo quiero es que tu me demuestres 
Que eres una muchacha decente

Dice la gente que soy un gangster 
Pero to's mienten 

Loca con que llegue el fin de semana 
Pa' meterle las cabras a tu hermana 
De que vas pal' cine con tu pana 
Un placer tenerte en mi cama 

Nunca madrugas para ir a la escuela 
Siempre me llamas por si el timbre no suena 
Yo dando rondas esperandote afuera 
Y tu te asomas cuando mi cancion suena 

Hay rumores de que te enamoraste 
Y a tus amigas de mi les contaste 
y aunque muchos gente dice que soy gangster 
Nadie podra con este romance

Aunque te pichee yo sigo en la lucha 

Cuentale que cantas mis canciones en la ducha 
Y que tus emociones son muchas 

Que mi unico pecado fue amarte 
Y ser dueño de todas tus partes 

Suegro, no pichee, usted lo vivio antes

Eliezer Torres,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,2002
Eligh,"[Grouch] 
Every man's blood boils
When turmoil or life foils his plans
I've soiled my hands puttin' work in
Tryna keep from hurtin', cause fools be irkin' the fuck outta me
Now what do I gotta be, the epitome of nice?
Biterally precise when I talk
And assuming when I walk I never let the chip show
Cause people try and push it and they want to test my wits
So, I'm defensive, intense with my brain waves
And that's offensive, I sense so the pain stays close
Most don't depressurize
When I've had it up to where you can see it in my eyes
Realize there's no sanity
Hella profanity and a sort fuse to light
I snort and use the mic like a weapon
Effectin' any section I step in
Got 'em checkin' for the vibe that I'm protectin'

[Asop]
Who takes the time to look around?
That which surrounds makes the sound of compromise
Damn, they try to size up to such plateau's they'll never touch
Always talkin' about nothin', when you catch 'em, they always hush
Not much to be said, not enough to be heard when the words become absurd
When a voice of a gangsta starts to emanate from the 'burbs
Now anybody, everybody can try to rock a party
With that bump in your trunk, always drunk with your motions
With no devotion, collects an ocean of funds
In the worst way, idiots they stay this way
Me hella 'noid like a homophobic stuck in the middle of a gay parade
With no way to escape the confines of one's mind
A mental prison, a prism of thought
A crystalis of anger created by the action of strangers
A dangerous way to live your life the these days
Thinkin' he hella fresh though
A male emcee acting like a lesbo
Making one's life so stressful
That's why I escape with these with the ease of a hiatus in Fresno

[PSC]
A rusty nail in the foot
A cavity in the tooth
My threshold, the pressure build up, to me I'm aloof
And no proof of a cracking point
Mood swings like primates
Gorilla in the mist type range, I see all states
I King Kong shit, rip down the house structure
Like Empire State, the power will surely crush you 
As a pun on a radio edit, or nasty soda
I'm colder in the heart when the camel back breaks
No one seen the true beast, release him and danger follows
Like sequels to horror flicks, there's no tomorrow
No sun will come out, no Annie, no Daddy Warbucks
The Hard Knock Life begins when tempers flare up
An enemy will show no mercy, take it from Percy
And stop at No Limit until the bullshit's ended

[Eligh]
Rage, trapped in a cage
Wrapped in a page, you never change
Severed off from the vain
Not enough blood to complain
Rage enters the brain
Now it's a pain you can't maintain
Leaving friendships slain, always the other one to blame
Never to be the same, rage is just a game played
To someone less it runs deep on an unseen plain
Peep the problems of the average man when he's insane
Losing personality replaced by the devil's frame
Madness, uncanny love for the fact his life is lived in sadness
Can't handle the Silence so The Lambs get reprimanded
For the underhanded, under kept raging thunderclap
You're wondering ""What's that?""
It's the wrath of rage-aholics

[BFAP]
People playing games with my mind
Playing games every time that I find 
Confined to a world, disillusion mind
I'm losing my patience, losing time
Wasting my patience, you wasting time
Not facing who you are
Enraged in cages, enslaved in graves
We lay, relay, we play 
Beating on drums till the warrior battle comes
Native son chasing the moon in smoke filled rooms
Chasing hell to it's doom, boom
Like losing a check on payday
Holding a grip, it's stressful
It's not your fault, it never is
Whatever, I watch the fake, clever moves you make
Earthquake, alcohol makes a fire go crazy
Till where nothing can faze me",Rage,1999
Eligh,"Moments like this, moments like this
Swishing out smoke from my lips and just reminisce this
Moments to the legendary sound mystifying like magic
Sits in your mind to marinate
Heaven it's just a time serenade
You off this tape late 
At night you alone getting zoned
To the S, the you, the N, SPOT
Lighting shine from Oakland caught in a world of
Imagination can't be wastin' time
Drama can't be facin' climb on your honor
Don't lock me away I'm a gona
Cut that shit like benihana 'cause I ain't no chicken
Or no shrimp, I'm a large piranha 
With my ? steak
No matter what's on the menu, lasagna
Ain't gonna be comin' out my side
Runnin' from a homicide
If you want to ride why you still talking
Caught up in your pocket shit when you should be walkin
Yo back ain't worth my life
If you caught up in the hype
Livin' life with a genocide knife
You trippin'

Moments like this I want to see your bump your fist
Put a smile on your face don't be a chump and diss
It's such a pretty picture when everybody's with ya
Hit you like you're born again
Now sound the horn again it's on
The song to make you move on
Groovin' on some free shit
Some look at me shit, I'm raw
A chance to shine is what I saw
Be a shrine on stage with everyone and all
Why'all, you got to loosen the fuck up
We boostin' the sound comin' from the town
Runnin' round, everywhere that they missed
Livin' for the moments like this

[Chorus:Repeat x2]
Oh ma ma
Never stopping when they talking 'cause
They la la
We the kings of this hill I 
Say why why
Livin' for the moment til the day I die
My essence I own it

Into the microphone I speak
At this moment and time I flow
At this moment and time I fly
Don't ask questions don't ask why
Don't inquire about my life
Say what I need I'll be greed
Been to this place many times
Can't be shy won't be discrete
I'm the guy with open eyes, open ears and a open mind
Can't stay outside open the blind
Use your retina focus in
Live for the moment open it
Hopin' folks will leave the feelin' vocally
I mostly expose foes when they're phony

So many things on my mind
Women and rhymes
Master both I'm one at a time old school
You think every word out my mouth is a lie
Cause you out too much
When a real man climb in the picture you rush
Showin' signs like you heard it before
But for sure you'll drink my wallet dry
Then roll your eyes when I'm broke
That's why nope I got a girl now
You shall never be in my world like that no more
Get in war runnin' after runnin' 'cause you stop
Poundin' your business to hit the shores of the freak show
With a tense smellin' of indole and wine
The bearded lady who rhymes
Everybody rhyme now
Throw in the towel
You rhyme like a battle movement
I growl to move them
That's how I lose them

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Kick snares and bass
Rules to the face
Race you to the finish but I'm takin' first place
Shakin' walls makin' presence known
Mackin' in the tackin'
Stackin' til its gone or on you know
Whether a navigator limo or a bucket fuck it
My whole life it's a demo
So learn where's Vern 
Who cares who stares
That's the payoff so layoff the shit talk
I can do anything
I can do anything
Pennies bring dollars my rappin' it cause hollers
Were all scholars 'cause I said so, shit
Makin' up a moment like this

After the fact moment passes
When you have no clarity
Maneuver passes carefully
One dead a time faithfully
Acin' a ho, successful
Watch where all the rest go
When its really time let go
They gotta keep it goin' strong
The water know when it's past rate
Through the darkness I'm a passer
In this moment I'm a master
Of momentum
In my cerebellum and my soul of plaster
Build universal housing for the time being
At moments like this",Moments Like This,2000

Mind's eye opened wide
Come inside
No need to hide

[Eligh]
It's just the chronic
Chronic moment
It's like the omen
Givin' birth inside your chest
Invest some time in knowing what the herb can do to a man's soul
When inhaled it takes the rest, he's impaled
It'll leave a person on top of a telephone pole with Hekyll and Jekyll
I know many men who have sold the secret medium my way
I light that bowl and lose control of tracks constructed by the conductor
Never stuck in a permanent high I float around my way
Wings and things help me to the next plateau I go
Way too intense with dense ideas I never change
I flow rivers of ancient, teleportations sent to the nation
Vis-à-vis via satellite, ear to ear from here to there
They feel the beat
 Don't be shy
I'm really a quiet guy
Just try!
Look what it does for an introvert
I flirt with Mary Jane and burn her body for the feeling in a pipe
I won't complain

Marijuana
I think I need a hit
I take a trip, a sip of bomb
Come along
It's just an herb
Mind's eye opened wide
Come inside
No need to hide

[CHORUS]

It's just a
Crowded room full of people having tripped out conversations
No one's up to getting over the edge
That last hit dropped the eggs from my basket
Now I'm asking
""Dude, let's  let's go outside real quick""
""Man, what's wrong with you, man?""
""Man let's just go outside real quick. Fuck it. I'm fucked up, dude.""
""Aight. Aight"" [Paranoid. Paranoid] [Go outside real quick. Go
outside real quick.]
""Let's go smoke.""

Paranoid, pacing outside, waiting for a cigarette to bring down my high
Beware, boy, the one drunk punk
Hey I can ??? with endurance, when he talks he doesn't give a fuck
Swing low, I crouch down below
Should have left the last hit to the homie with the tolerance
Mary Jane's the bitch they pitch when slangin' bags for back support
Barely sane I hand them twenty, that'll be plenty
Relax and sport that sack in the back
When the show's in progress my heart's pressed against my chest
And the mic's in hand I bite my bottom lip and watch them trip
I'm ripped!
[What're they sayin'?]
[Pass the blunt to the left-hand side. Pass the blunt to the
left-hand side. Pass the blunt to the left-hand side.]

Open mind, open lungs, open eyes, open hands
To hold the bowl, hold for the urn
Turn to ashes and urn
Earn your keep, or Mary won't have nowhere to sleep
There's something about Mary I can't seem to keep
Stick to the beats of the midnight hours
Smokin' a bowl before I go
In slo-mo creepin' around the bend
Not a snake in the grass so I fiend for green
Call me a fan with a hand on the pipe
Who like the smell, what the hell
Like's the felling, what you dealin'?
