Arch Enemy,"Here I am
Back to the wall
I picked a fight
Against the time
Free at last
I come my own way
I will resist them
To the day I die

I am who I am
My time has come

I am who I am
Take it or leave it
A rebel at heart
No gods, no masters
My time has come

There is no second place
No perfect world
Your head is whole
Freedom in your heart
Be strong
Take this chance
Make your way
A better future comes

I am who I am
My time has come

I am who I am
Take it or leave it
A rebel at heart
No gods, no masters
My time has come

No gods, no masters
No gods, no masters

What doesn't kill us
Makes us stronger
Locked and loaded
Ready to strike
Here we stand
Loud and proud
United as one
United as one

I am who I am
Take it or leave it
A rebel at heart
No gods, no masters
My time has come
I am who I am
Take it or leave it
A rebel at heart
No gods, no masters
My time has come","No Gods, No Masters",2011
Arch Enemy,"I've got a secret
I just can't tell
I've created my own hell
If you knew what I know
It would change your perfect world

Locked the vault 
Thrown away the key
My lips are forever sealed
Buried in a place you'll never see
This secret dies with me

Don't ask me
For I cannot tell
Words can kill
Sharp is the blade of steel
Skeletons of the past

This burden, this pain
Were all these tears in vain?
Memories of the past return
This one is going with me to the grave

It is beating me up inside
To that I must confess
Secret weighing down my soul
Until I draw my very last breath

Our spirits scarred to ice
The only witness left alive

Hear the cries

We lost our paradise

See the slaughter, your crimes
They will remember
And so shall I

When I die
Let the ravens fly
Let my body lie
Under snow and blood

The wolves of war at your throat
Leave nothing but severed bones
Scattered upon battlefields
Life is the price you pay

He who is proud is not for long
He who is brave will be destroyed

Layered with thorns of shame

Archers of Loaf,"Well you see I happened to be back on the east coast
A few years back tryin' to make me a buck
Like everybody else, well you know
Times get hard and well I got down on my luck
And I got tired of just roamin' and bummin'
Around, so I started thumbin' my way
Back to my old hometown
You know I made quite a few miles
In the first couple of days, and I
Figured I'd be home in a week if my
Luck held out this way
But you know it was the third night
I got stranded, it was out at a cold lonely
Crossroads, and as the rain came
Pouring down, I was hungry, tired
Freezin', caught myself a chill, but
It was just about that time that
The lights of an old semi topped the hill
You should of seen me smile when I
Heard them air brakes come on, and
I climbed up in that cab where I
Knew it'd be warm at the wheel
Well at the wheel sat a big man
I'd have to say he must of weighed 210
The way he stuck out a big hand and
Said with a grin Big Joe's the name
And this here rig's called Phantom 309
Well I asked him why he called his
Rig such a name, but he just turned to me
And said Why son don't you know this here
Rig'll be puttin' 'em all to shame, why
There ain't a driver on this
Or any other line for that matter
That's seen nothin' but the taillights of Big Joe
And Phantom 309
So we rode and talked the better part of the night
And I told my stories and Joe told his and
I smoked up all his Viceroys as we rolled along
He pushed her ahead with 10 forward gears
Man that dashboard was lit like the old
Madam La Rue pinball, a serious semi truck
Until almost mysteriously, well it was the
Lights of a truck stop that rolled into sight
Joe turned to me and said I'm sorry son
But I'm afraid this is just as far as you go
You see I kinda gotta be makin' a turn

Just up the road a piece, but I'll be
Damned if he didn't throw me a dime as he
Threw her in low and said Go on in there
Son, and get yourself a hot cup of coffee
On Big Joe
And when Joe and his rig pulled off into
The night, man in nothing flat they was
Clean outa sight
So I walked into the old stop and
Ordered me up a cup of mud sayin'
Big Joe's settin' this dude up but
It got so deathly quiet in that
Place, you could of heard a pin drop
As the waiter's face turned kinda
Pale, I said What's the matter did
I say somethin' wrong? I kinda
Said with 8a half way grin. He said
No son, you see It'll happen every
Now and then. You see every driver in
Here knows Big Joe, but let me
Tell you what happened just 10 years
Ago, yea it was 10 years ago
Out there at that cold lonely crossroads
Where you flagged Joe down, and
There was a whole bus load of kids
And they were just comin' from school
And they were right in the middle when
Joe topped the hill, and could
Have been slaughtered except
Joe turned his wheels, and
He jacknifed, and went
Into a skid, and folks around here
Say he gave his life to save that bunch
Of kids, and out there at that cold
Lonely crossroads, well they say it
Was the end of the line for
Big Joe and Phantom 309, but it's
Funny you know, cause every now and then
Yea every now and then, when the
Moon's holdin' water, they say old Joe
Will stop and give you a ride, and
Just like you, some hitchhiker will be
Comin' by
So here son, he said to me, get
Yourself another cup of coffee, it's on the
House, you see I want you to hang on
To that dime, yea you hang on to that
Dime as a kind of souvenir, a
Souvenir of Big Joe and Phantom 309",Big Joe and Phantom 309,1996

Archie Bell & the Drells,"I was born and raised down in Alabama
On a farm way back up in the woods
I was so ragged the kids would call me patches
Papa used to kid me about it
Of course deep down inside
He was thinkin' he had done all he could do
My papa was a great old man
I can see him with a shovel in his hand
See, education he never had
But he did wonders when the time got bad
A little money from the crops he raised
Barely paid the bills we made
Oh life had kicked him down to the plow
When he tried to get up life would kick him back down
One day papa called me to his dyin' bed
Put his hands on my shoulders And in tears he said
Patches, I'm depending on you son
To pull the family through My son, it's all left up to you

Two days later papa passed away
I became a man that day
So I told mama I was gonna quit school
But she said that was dad's strictest rule
So every morning 'fore I went to school
I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too
Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on
I wanted to leave this but I wanted a home
But I always remembered what my daddy said
With tears in his eyes on his dyin' bed
He said, ""Patches, I'm depending on you son
I tried to do my best, It's up to you to do the rest
:
But then one day a strong rain came
And washed all the crops away
And at the age of thirteen I thought I was carrying
The weight of the whole world on my shoulders
And you know, mama knew what I was going through, Cause
Everyday I had to work the fields
Cause that's the only way we got our meals
You see, I was the oldest of a family
And everybody else depended on me
Every night I heard my mama pray
Lord, give him the strength to face another day
Though years have passed and all the kids are gone
I aimed to take my mama to a brand new home
God knows people that I shed a tear
My daddy's voice helped me through the years
Sayin', ""Patches, I'm depending on you son
To pull the family through My son, it's all left up to you
I could still hear papa when he'd say
Patches, I'm depending on you son
I tried to do my best It's up to you to do the rest"".",Patches [#],1969

Archie Bleyer,"When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine
The zither's sweet refrain
Keeps swirling in your brain
Like new may wine
Strauss waltzes, candle-glow
And the laughter of long ago
Fill the magic chords and make it seem like today

You never knew that you could be
Enchanted by a melody
The years will never drive it out
You don't know why
It's something you can't live without
You hear it in the twilight hush
And in the morning traffic rush
A song that's always new
In your heart a part of you
Oh, shines so brightly when you hear the third man theme

When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain

Polo shirts and pig shit, can't even get them stains clean
Ain't too much I ain't seen in between the grains in Athens
Ups and downs, rights and lefts all around me brains are scratchin'

Archie Eversole,"Why me Lord, what have I ever done
To deserve even one
Of the pleasures I've known
Tell me Lord, what did I ever do
That was worth loving you
Or the kindness you've shown.

Lord help me Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've need you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand.

Tell me Lord, if you think there's a way
I can try to repay
All I've taken from you
Maybe Lord, I can show someone else
What I've been through myself
On my way back to you.

Lord help me Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've need you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand.",Why Me,2002
Archie Eversoul,"Yeah, I gotta admit
It really doesn't seem like it's been this long
But it turned out better than we thought
And they say us proved them wrong
'Cause we have held the promises that we made
The sun - it shines on us
Though people try to throw in shade
But with a son and two daughters later
Seven years deep like Will and Jada
Givin' our praise to the creator
Because I know he's greater than anything
That we could ever do
Ain't none of it would be possible without you

Through love and peace and pain
Yes, we held each other through the pouring rain
We laughed, and we cried; we flied together

So many said we wouldn't make it together
But still we say it's gonna last forever
But everyday we try to make it better
Flyin' over all the stormy weather
You told me you would hold me down
And though I really never show it
I know you love me, and I've always known it
There's nothin' left to prove
There's only one for me
And I'm the one for you

Through love and peace and pain
Yes, we held each other through the pouring rain
We laughed, and we cried; we flied together

Many will come into your life
But one will battle through this life
I found the love of my life, in you
In you
I see the future in your eyes
Stick with me long enough to recognize
Joy laughs and it cries

Through love and peace and pain
Yes, we held each other through the pouring rain
We laughed, we cried, we flied together
Through love and peace and pain
Yes, we held each other through the pouring rain
We laughed, and we cried; we flied together
Through love and peace and pain
Yes, we held each other through the pouring rain
We laughed, and we cried; we flied together",Turn It Up,2005
Archie Hahn,"We'll remember you forever Eddie
Through the sacrifice you made we can't believe the price you paid
For love

Little Eddie Mitty born in Jersey City
Started singin' when he was five
Never knew his father mother didn't bother
To catch his last name fast as he came

He was off and flying
Times were really trying
Eddie and his mother alone
Soon another mister soon a baby sister
Mama kept swingin' and Eddie kept singin'

Ah ya ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya for love for love

And now the tragic story
Eddie's sister, Mary Louise, needed an operation
To get the money he would have to become an overnight sensation
Eddie believed the American people
Had wonderful, lovegiving hearts
His well publicized end he considered would send
His memorial album to the top of the charts...and it did

Ah ya ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya for love for love

When a young singer dies to our shock and surprise
In a plane crash or flashy sports car
He becomes quite well known
And the kindness he's shown has made more than one post mortem star
Well you did it Eddie and though it's hard to applaud suicide
You gave all you could give so your sister could live
All America's choked up inside

We'll remember you forever Eddie
Thru' the sacrifice you made we can't believe the price you paid
For love","Goodbye, Eddie, Goodbye",1974

Who gon represent for Texas, like I represent for Texas
And who this nigga talking down on Dirty South, niggaz rapping reckless
Scared took him out of the hotel, 'cause when Ro swang Ro swell
Eyebrows and jaws, so in my presence Mr. don't tell
I'm a motherfucking murderer, you the wanksta
Popping that gangsta shit on the radio, and it's disturbing you
Big Moe nigga that's my big dog, and my love ain't never gon withdrawal
So we clicked up coming to get why'all, my nigga Ja said you's a bitch dog

And can't nobody stop it, because the reaper's coming to cancel every one of us
And it's all gravy, all of my niggaz are hard plus we all crazy
Wishing I can be a peaceful man and, hoping that the Lord save me
Fuck a nigga named 50 Cent, you nothing but change
I'm a whole dolla nigga, hanging one in your brain

Mob figgas representing, and we here to do the job
Got my step-on nigga shoes on, 'case it get dirty
'Cause man it's going down, in the Thirty
It's for war thirty, fuck President Bush
If he was close to the edge, then I'll give him a push
And do this whole world a favor, hey there howdy neighbor
Shit, I'm sorry I took so long to save you
I was getting my dick sucked, by my secretary
She asked me my sign, I told her bitch Aires
I stay on Barbary and Scott, 5000 block
I paint the white house black, and start renting it out

In this underground game, I'm rolling with S.L.A.B

Got a itching trigga finger, when I'm holding my strap

Steady riding my dick, like bitches do
You a gangsta or a hoe, nigga which is you

I heard a nigga in the game, was saying my name
But now my glock is fully loaded, and ready to aim
S-L-A-be until I'm gone, and I'm repping it strong
You don't want to see these gorillas, running up in your home
Everybody better clear the lot, when the lights off
I set it off, when I luger ride for the cause
And fuck the law, I'ma mash till I'm finished and done
And when it's all said and done, I'ma be number one
And I bet that I'm a soldier that'll fold you, I done told you

Or you'll get a 44 to your jaw, ain't no love boxing we raw
And if you really think that we playing, step in the ring so you can get scarred
Guerillas ready for havoc, on a mission to let you have it
To tell the truth I done had it, this game is really fin to get tragic
I ain't having when I'm busting on first and ten, I'ma be rushing
Till a nigga left with concussions, bring the end of discussion dog
You don't want to get me pissed off or ticked off your ass is fin to get pissed on
Not dissed on but clicked on, for stepping inside my zone

50 Cent, baby that's nothing but chump change
Shooting slugs at my partna, disrespecting the game
So feel this verbal cocaine, your whole tape was trash
Now the whole Screwed Up Click, gon beat that ass
So when you come in H-Town, don't hide behind your circle
We gon' tear the club up, leave both your eyes purple
Hurt you bitch nigga, that's from the Boss Man
I'm known for slapping boys, knocking em out with my hands

South sive for live, S.U.C. for life, nigga we get cash forever

Keep maintaining, it's a burden up on my conscience just staying
Alive

I'm a real hustler stacking funds, riding around with a loaded
Gun

Some of my niggas that's on the run, with all that weed up in
Your lungs
Get your paper, get your dough, buy it off the show room floor
Go about this process slow, and feel the pain of my nigga Z-Ro
Over money I lose sleep, sell work, fuck sheep
Spit heat on beats, to make my, ends meet
Press hard on tablet sheets, everything else is obsolete
Victim of these ghetto streets, you don't work, you don't eat
I strive to, gain fame, struggle to maintain
Stay away from no names and flip bricks of cocaine
This rap thang's been good to me, feeds my, family
Forever keep my sanity, and do this shit for P-A-T
Must keep a leather head, for all my partners let's make em
Spread
Me and my niggas we break bread, until the whole family's fed
You heard what, I said, in this, over bull
All that, I say, I speak, the truth

(Chorus - 2x)

[Z-Ro]
Looking at this little light of mine, never did glimmer, never
Did shine
Cause I resort to a life of crime, and I know I'm wrong, but I
Got to get mine
Got to feed my mouth and five more, I grind every day but I stay
Broke
Responsibility baby, taking a load off my little day
Steady be working her fingers to the bone, aching and tired when
She come home
Bout to pull a stunt, last of the month
Ain't no more work, just riding on chrome 
No rocks in my pocket the on my neck
One slip and I'm tripping one growing up thick
Give me a couple of zeros on a check
I might sweat, but never gone let up

Told us all the white man's ways

And gave us gifts to ease the pain

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Archie Shepp,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now,1989

For you I sigh, for you dear only

I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending

You know I'm yours for just the taking

A figure made of clay

One night I found these magic words
In a magic book

And keep your hand wide open
Let the sun shine through
'Cause you can never lose a thing

There's a hand to rock the cradle
And a hand to help us stand
With a gentle kind of motion
As it moves across the land

Gifts of life and love it brings
So keep your hand wide open

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

Épris comme au premier temps

Du bonheur que l'on partageait reclus ici
Chez nous c'était Capri et c'était pas fini
On était comme deux aimants
Nos cœurs vibraient de concert
J'comprends toujours pas vraiment
Qu't'es voulu prendre un peu l'air
Tu m'as dis que tu la voyais plus comme ça ta vie
Que t'étouffais et qu'il te fallait voir du pays

Pour aimer ce qu'on a brûlé

Deux mois que tu t'es envolé
Trois mois que tu t'es fais la belle
Et moi j'me fais des idées
Tu fais p't-être les 400 coups
Pour rattraper le temps
Moi du coup je fais les cent pas dans l'appartement
Combien sont ils qui m'appellent
Pour me dire de t'oublier

Au bras d'un autre et si belle
Que les miens m'en sont tombés

Arrangements of magical nature

Of your God given stupidities

Affected modesty and create
Of you an object of derision

Whom company does exclude
But in the midst of all frenzy
He is, feasting in a transitory mood

He strides before you on water

Charms the guests, rides the ball

",Know,1996
Arden-Ohman Orchestra,"Life will be a dream song
Love will be the theme song

Soon, the lonely nights will be ended
Soon, two hearts as one will be blended
When I'm with you who cares what time it is
Or what the place or the climate is

Oh! Soon, our little ship will come sailing
Home through every storm, never failing
The day you're mine this world will be in tune
Let's make that day come soon

Soon, a little cottage will find us
Safe with all our cares far behind us
The day you're mine this world will be in tune
Let's make that day come soon

Let's make that day come soon
Make it come soon",Soon [From Strike Up the Band],1998
Arden-Ohman Orchestra,"Who cares if the sky cares
To fall in the sea?
Who cares what banks fail in Yonkers,
Long as you've got a kiss that conquers?

Why should I care?

So long as I care for you
And you care for me!",Who Cares? [From Of Thee I Sing],1998

Sugar Candy when I'm with you 
Then I only see the sunny side, 
Even trouble has it's funny side.

When you're handy, It's fine and dandy, 
But when you're gone what can I do",Fine and Dandy,2002

J’étais trop hnin, j’aurais du être plus malin, plus vicieux
Maman t’avais raison, je pense à toi dans les cieux
Mesdames et messieurs
Vous avez jamais vu un rappeur se comporter comme moi
J’ai fait confiance à des tchoras
Heureusement deux-trois bonhommes peuvent tirer pour moi
Je serais né aux States j’aurais sûrement la carrière de French Montana
T’as pas mal, j’ai pas mal, H24 je fume la frappe de Ketama
Dans mes textes j’aime bien mettre de l’émotion, c’est fini les Four Motions
J’me tue la santé, j’consomme encore l’Eristoff tous les jours j’bois la potion

On avait rien, tous les jours je dépense un loyer
J’ai préféré partir que rester sur l’ter-ter et cailler
J’ai la tête dans les nuages, mon cerveau est ailleurs

Le rap c’était mon passe-temps
J’ai jamais fait de CV
Ma mère me disait tout l’temps
“Arrête Hocine tu fais TB”
Elle a pas eu la chance de m’voir à la télé
Ici c’est Marseille c’est pas L.A
Un tel ou un tel s’est fait rafaler
J’veux partir ailleurs bébé andalé
J’ai commencé le rap sans même penser en arriver là
Hier j’étais personne, j’traînais devant l’D, j’bloquais l’entrée

Quand je pense à l’avenir j’pense à nous-deux

Ardis,"Bitch wanna die 'cause she know I caught her lyin'

I met her in a bar, outside a little part of Texas
Never know she's sleepin' 'round on me
I found about it one night when we were sexin'
'Cause she accidentally called me Gee
Now you're lyin', fake cryin'
Wanna die 'cause you know you a tramp in my book
Misleadin', steady cheatin'
You run the street and you know you a bitch in my book

Now Lil' Jane, I guess that's what we'll call her
Had all the homies goin' crazy
Had to join a convent, wanted to be a baller
Now the bitch fuck every guy she see
See you a slut and in the mud and
Havin' fun and you're still a bitch in my book
Trampin', soon you die, bitch
And that's why you just a bitch in my book

Now I'm livin' lost, don't know where my next meal is
Had to try and find a way
'Cause you left the house and you took everything I deal with
Now bitch I'm wonderin' where you stay
See you a die-hoe, I'll bravo
I'll kill you, still a bitch in my book
Loaded and smokin'
Now I'm blowin' 'cause you a bitch in my book

Just a bitch in my book
This hoe is a slut in my book

Just a tramp, I'm sick and tired of meetin' whores
Every time I'm walkin' down the street
And I'm sick and tired of always seein' closed doors
Wanna slap every tramp I meet
See you started then you parted
Now you bought in, still a tramp in my book
Low-life, do Snow White
Now you crow and you're still a bitch in my book
Know that, I go there
I'll beat you, you still a bitch in my book

Ardis,"Where the love at
Momma told me there'd be days like this 
But I didn't listen 
Never question the woman's intuition 
My ambition is to give you what you miss 
Sweet love 
Take off your shoes  come and get your feet rubbed 
Us in the tub 
That'll be the shit 
Anybody that don't believe this can eat a dick 
I think we soul mates 
'Cause we got so much in common 
You make them hoes wait 
When you find the proper woman 
Then next to me 
Put your head on my chest 
Attraction stimulates me 
But it's not all about the sex 
I respect you got a mind 
And you self sufficient 
Opinonate yet know how to listen 
Now what's mine is yours 
If I'm ballin' you ballin' 
Tell that other nigga 
He can stop callin' 
Check this out

I want to be your man 

I want to be your man baby 
I'm talkin' about 
Providing you with all the lights, securities 
I mean, I think the first step is 
Going to pick out some rings 
What you like 
Baggets and pistol skirts 

Can't spend a life 
Without giving you my answer tonight 
Cause I gotta catch a early flight 
What you yellin' about 
The simple fact that I'm bailin' out 
I'm makin' moves 
My record sellin' out 
I need some affection 
Love can you teach me a lesson 
I might be sittin' fat down here in Texas 
But the thugs ain't mean 
So how deep is your love for me 
How real do you cut for me 
If the laws came and got me 
How long were you stuck with me 
If not long then don't fuck with me 
I want you down on my team 
And support 
When I'm tryin' to make my green 
It's for real 
I throws some karats in your ring 
I'll make it last forever 
'Cause you know 
I had that cash forever 
We can ball till pass together baby 
Where the love at

Yeah that nigga Lil' Troy 
Short Stop Records 
Puttin' down like a G yo 
That's how we get our groove on 

Recognize the mobb 
I bet you cold working star 
When they see the flowers that I'm sendin' to your job 
Read the cards 
Stick it in your purse 
Let's keep it rosy 
'Cause everybody so nosy 
So you can't believe what people say 
Misery, loves company tell them keep away 
It'll be okay 
If you trust in me to make it right 
Before I hit you I'll ?? 
That's on my baby's life 
Will you be my wife 
Please take this ring 
And a service to token 
To make you realize baby I ain't jokin' 
I'm coping 
But my adversaries got me ?? 
I need a god-feared woman 
Who understands my heart 
Leave your baggage from past relationships 
Out of the picture 
I put my old flames out I done changed 
All of my digits 
And that's real

I want to be your man 
Sober 
Ain't really no need to question me

But you alone 
To let you know 
You don't want to mess with me 
You need to spend time with me 

I bring the heat 
You want to play 
It ain't a thing ?? 
You say you changed 
You look the same to me 
Eat and ball too much 
On the real, cause I done stall too much 
Girl I want you all too much 
Ain't no way in the world 
Me and you an ball too much 
Imagine having cabbage 
Straight lavish 
Friends wish they can have it 
'Cause I push a rolez, sip crystal glasses 
I'm all wet 
Don't listen to your friends about me cheatin' 
They don't' know that 
Your best friend want me 
Tell that hoe that 
For show that 
You know she want the kids 
You should have knew this

Area 11,"As I looked into the burning sky,
A tear forming in my eye
Memories of fallen dreams
And all those that have died.
Demons are possessing me.
Robbed of my eternity.
A cloud of ash that pierced the night;
I feel my hate take flight.

I'm choking on my own words and
I'm scared of backing down
Because the hope within us all
Is up in flames.
Twisted by my warring conscience,
The situation's pushing onwards.
Genocide
Forever taints your name.

This can't be, was this me?
I think I've lost control.
I caused this, I forced this,
Can I continue on?
I have caused this, I have forced this.
I caused this, I forced this, I caused this.

Betrayed by trust, forever left to scream.
Oh hold me closely and die in my arms,
And then take this secret with you,

I will make this promise now 
A simple thing, a sacred vow

We will fall together 
Into unforgiving night we plunge!

We will be as one forever

Aretha Franklin,"There was a time when men were kind
When their voices were soft
And their words inviting
There was a time when love was blind
And the world was a song
And the song was exciting
There was a time
Then it all went wrong

I dreamed a dream in time gone by
When hope was high
And life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving
Then I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used and wasted
There was no ransom to be paid
No song unsung, no wine untasted

But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hope apart
And they turn your dream to shame

He slept a summer by my side
He filled my days with endless wonder
He took my childhood in his stride
But he was gone when autumn came

And still I dream he'll come to me
That we will live the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be
And there are storms we cannot weather

I had a dream my life would be
So different from this hell I'm living
So different now from what it seemed
Now life has killed the dream I dreamed.",I Dreamed a Dream [From Les Miserables],

That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind, but now I see

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home

The Lord has promised good to me
His word my hope secures
He will my shield and portion be,
As long as life endures

Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail
and mortal life shall cease
I shall possess within the veil
A life of joy and peace

Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we've first begun",Amazing Grace,1972

Those really were the days, we had a lot of fun
And I remember that very special one
See him walking in the hall when classes would change
And I don't think he ever really knew my name

Ooh boy, school boy, ooh boy, yeah yeah yeah yeah
We were stylish and young, second to none
Coming on up the right way, yes, those were the days

With my fringed suede jacket I was just about tough enough, ya'll

Remember those big hoop skirts and petticoats
That we wore in the summer, guess that's what I wore the most

And you'd have to hold them down while sitting in your chair

Then maybe we all could shine, yeah
Maybe we could get it back, oh baby, yeah baby

Oh, truth and honesty that is what we need to hold on
To the good stuff we believe in
Before we land up loose, sad and free
Before we find out all that is gone
We could pull it back together with truth and honesty, oh
Open up your hands, show me your heart

Truth and honesty, oh, that's what we need to hold on
To the good stuff we believe in
Before we land up loose and sad and free

Because rain-drops will hide my tear drops

Why I could never explain

Each page remembers you and me
Running in the rain, laughing in the sunshine

What happened to the boy next door?
Wherever you are I wonder if you'd cherish
The special joy we shared yesterday

On the day I was born, said my father, said he
""Here's an elegant legacy waiting for ye
Here the song for your lips and a rhyme for your heart
Sing it whenever the world falls apart""

Look, look, look to the rainbow
Follow it over the hills and the sea
Oh look, oh look, look to the rainbow
Oh, and then follow the fellow who follows the dream

So I bundled my heart and I roamed the world free
To the east with a lark, to the west with the sea
And I roamed over the Earth and I scanned all of the skies
And I found out, found out in my true love's eyes

Oh, look, oh look, oh yeah, look to the rainbow
Yeah, yeah, yeah, follow it over 
Follow it over the hills and the sea
Oh yeah, yeah, you have to look
Oh yeah, yeah, you have to look
Oh, yeah to the rainbow
Oh, and follow the fellow, who follows, follows the dream

Look, oh look, look to the rainbow
Follow it over the hills and the sea
Oh look, oh, you gotta look to the rainbow
And then follow the fellow who follows, follows the dream

There may be a little trouble in your home, but look
You may not be able to see it very clear
Keep on looking
And then follow it over
It looks a little cloudy 'round that forest
Over the hills and the shade
Man, ain't your day, hold you head up and
Keep on looking to the rainbow
And follow the fellow who follows, follows the dream

Well, look
Yeah, to the rainbow
Follow it over
If you don't have shoes for your children
Follow it over the hills",Look to the Rainbow,1986

How sweet a kiss could be
I would have said, impossible,
Impossible for me

And if they said, you'll find love
Beyond the rainbows end
I would have said, Impossible,
Impossible, my friend.

To dream about what might have been
Is strange enough for me
But now it seems I'm livin' in
A dream too beautiful to be

Aretha Franklin,"There was a time when men were kind
Their voices were soft
And their words inviting

There was a time when love was blind
And the world was a song
And that song was exciting

There was a time, and it all went wrong

I dreamed a dream in days gone by
When hope was high and life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving

Then I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used and wasted
There was no ransom to be paid
No song unsung no wine untasted

But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hope apart
As they turn your dream to shame

He slept a summer by my side
He filled my days with endless wonder
He took my childhood in his stride
But he was gone when autumn came

And still I dreamed he'd come to me
That we would live the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be
And there are storms we cannot weather

I had a dream my life would be
So different from this hell I'm living
So different now from what it seemed
Now life has killed the dream I dreamed",I Dreamed a Dream,1994
Aretha Franklin,"Like a warrior that fights and wins the battle
I know the taste of victory
Though I went through some nights consumed by the shadows
I was crippled emotionally

Somehow I made it through the heartache, yes, I did
Oh, I escaped (aha ha)
I found my way out of the darkness
I kept my faith (I know you did), kept my faith

When the river was deep, I didn't falter
When the mountain was high, I still believed
When the valley was low, it didn't stop me, no no
I knew you were waiting, I knew you were waiting for me
Uh huh

With an endless desire, I kept on searching
Sure in time our eyes would meet
And like a bridge that's on fire, the hurt is over
One touch and you set me free

No, I don't regret a single moment, no, I don't
(I know you don't) Looking back
When I think of all those disappointments
I just laugh (I know you do), I just laugh

When the river was deep, I didn't falter
When the mountain was high, I still believed
When the valley was low, it didn't stop me, oh
I knew you were waiting, hey, I knew you were waiting for me

So we were drawn together through destiny, ooh boy, ooh!
I know this love we share was meant to be, oh
(Knew you were waiting) Ooh, yeah
(Knew you were waiting) I knew you were waiting
(Knew you were waiting for me)

(I didn't falter) I didn't falter, no
(I still believed) When the valley was low
(It didn't stop me) Nothing can stop me, no
(Knew you were waiting) No, I

(Knew you were waiting for me)
(I didn't falter) Oh, oh yeah
(I still believed) Oh, I still believed
(It didn't stop me) Do you know it couldn't stop me now? No
(Knew you were waiting)
Someday (someway), some place (somehow)
For me

When hope was high
And life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving

And dreams were made and used and wasted

No song unsung, no wine untasted

With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hope apart
And they turn your dream to shame

He filled my days with endless wonder

With their lies and deceit

Live or die on these streets

We both know the truth 
That we will prevail

So just love me 
 
I wish they would 
Leave us alone 
And let us be together 
Boy, you can't fall victim 
To those fools 
Telling you whatever 
You hear about me on the streets 
And it'll only make you weak

Foundation sick and tired of 
Hateration but we gone make it

There's no other person, I'd rather be,
I love what I do I love what I see,
But where is the schoolgirl that used to be me

Ah, the apple trees,
Where at garden teas,
Jack-o-lanterns swung:
Fashions of the day,
Vests of applique,
Dresses of shantung,
Only yesterday.
When the world was young

While sitting around we often recall,
The laugh of the year the night of them all,
The blonds who was so attractive that year,
Some opening night that made us all cheer;
Remember that time we all got so tight,
And jacques and antoine got into a fight,
The gendarmes who came, passed out like a light,
I laugh with the rest it's all very bright.

Ah, the apple trees,
Sunlight memories,
Where the hammock swung,
On our backs we'd lie;
Looking at the shy,
'til the stars were strung,
Only last July,
When the world was young.

You'll see me in cape d'antibes, or in spain ,
I follow the sun by boat or by plane,
It's any old millionaire in a storm,
For I've got my mink to keep my heart warm:
And sometimes I drink too much with the crowd,
And, sometimes I talk a little too loud,
My head may be aching, but it's unbowed,
And sometimes I see it all through the clouds

And the hive of bees,

Rowing at bateau,
Where the willow hung,

When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you
I'll take your part
Oh when darkness comes
And pain is all, is all around

Just like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
(Like a bridge)
Just like a bridge
(Over troubled) over troubled water
I will lay me down

Sail on silver girl
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All of your dreams are on their way
(See how they shine?)
Ooh and if you ever need a friend
(Need a friend)
Look around, I'm sailing right behind

Just like a bridge
Over troubled water
I'll be there to lay me down
(Like a bridge)
Like a bridge over (troubled water) troubled water
I will lay me down
Ooh I'll be your bridge
Yes I will

(Don't trouble the water)
Said I wouldn't
(Leave it alone)
Well (why don't you, why don't you, let it be?)
(Still water run deep)
I know that
(Yes it do) yeah (oh-oh-oh yeah)
Still water (don't trouble the water)
Yeah
(Leave it alone, why don't you, why don't you, let it be)
Talking 'bout still water
(Still water run deep)
You know they run deep
(Yes it do, oh-ho-ho-yeah)
Well I'm gonna be your bridge yeah!
(Don't trouble the water)
The troubled water (leave it alone)
Oh!
(Why don't you, why don't you, let it be?)
Come on come on
Walk out on me

Aretha Franklin,"I don't want nobody
Always
Sittin' around me and my man
I don't want nobody
Always
Sittin' right there
Lookin' at me and that man
Be it my mother, my brother or my sister
Would you believe, I'll get up, put on some clothes
Go out and help you find somebody for dissolving that pain
Yes I will

Now I don't mind company
Because company's alright with me
Every once in a while,
Yes it is, ah
I tell you I don't mind company
Because company's alright with me
Every once in a while,
Yeah
But oh, when me and that man get to lovin'
I tell you girls
I dig you but I just don't have time
To sit and chit and sit and chit-chat and smile

Don't send me no doctor
Fillin' me up with all of those pills
I got me a man named Doctor Feelgood
And oh, yeah, that man takes me off all o' my pains and my ills
His name is
Doctor Feelgood in the mornin'
And taking care of business
Is really this man's gain
And after one visit to Doctor Feelgood
You'll understand why Feelgood is his name
Oh, yeah, oh good God of mine
And the man sure makes me feel real, good",Dr. Feelgood [#],2005
Aretha Franklin,"Hey have you ever tried
Really reaching out for the other side?
I may be climbing on rainbows
But, baby here goes

Dreams they're for those who sleep
Life is for us to keep
And if you're wond'ring
What this song is leading to

I want to make it with you
I really think that we can make it boy

No, you don't know me well
In ev'ry little thing only time will tell
If you believe the things that I do
And we'll see it through

Life can be short or long
Love can be right or wrong
And if I choose the one
I'd like to help me through

I'd like to make it with you
I really think that we can make it boy

Aretha Franklin,"I knew a man Bojangles
And he danced for you
In worn out shoes
With silver hair, a ragged shirt
And baggy pants, the old soft shoe
He jumped so high, he jumped so high
Then he lightly touched down

I met him in a cell in New Orleans
I was down and out
He looked at me to be the eyes of age
As he spoke right out
He talked of life, he talked of life
He laughed, slapped his leg a step

He said his name, Bojangles
And he danced a lick across the cell
He grabbed his pants
In fettered stance
Oh, he jumped up high
Then he clicked his heels
He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh
Shook back his clothes all around

Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles, dance!

He danced for those
At minstrel shows and county fairs
Throughout the south
He spoke with tears of 15 years
How his dog and him traveled about
His dog up and died, he up and died
After 20 years he still grieves

He said I dance now
At every chance in honky tonks
For drink and tips
But most of the time
I spend behind these county bars
Cause I drinks a bit

He shook his head
And as he shook his head
I heard someone ask him
Please, please

Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles, dance!",Mr. Bojangles,2005
