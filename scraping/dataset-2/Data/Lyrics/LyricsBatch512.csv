Judas Priest,"You could find a way to ease my passion
You listen to the blood flow in my veins
You hear the teaching of the wind
Tell her why I'm alive within
I can't find the words My mind is dead
It's better by you better than me

Guess you'll have to tell her how I tried
To speak up thoughts I've held so inside
Tell her now I got to go
Out in the streets and down the shore
Tell her the world's not much living for
It's better by you better than me

Everybody
Everybody knows
Everybody
Everybody knows
Better by you better than me

You can tell what I want it to be
You can say what I only can see
It's better by you better than me

Guess I'll have to change my way of living
Don't wanna really know the way I feel
Guess I'll learn to fight and kill
Tell her not to wait until
They'll find my blood upon her windowsill?
It's better by you better than me

Everybody
Everybody knows
Everybody
Everybody knows
Better by you better than me

You can say what I only can see
You can tell what I want it to be

It's better by you better than me

Better by you better than me

You can tell what I want it to be
You can say way all they can see

Better by you better than me
Better by you better than me
You can say way all they can see

You can tell what I want it to be","Better by You, Better Than Me [Live][#][*]",1978
Judas Priest,"Stand and face each other
Don't know what to say
But that look in your eyes
Give it all away

You say you've got these feelings
You can't put into words
But you don't have to say a thing
'Cause I've already heard

Give me one good reason
Why this has to be
That's all I'm asking for

Don't say that it's over
When you and I both know
You can't put out this love
The fire burns below

We've been through so much together
We've laughed and we've sometimes cried
To say our love ain't working, well we
Haven't really tried

But why let's talk things over
Love can't be bought and sold
One more night together's what the future holds
What the future holds

Well, give me one good reason
Why this has to be
I said that's all I'm asking for
Can't you see I said

You can't put out the fire down below",Fire Burns Below [#][*],1978
Judas Priest,"Wild-eyed and tight fisted, I'm fused to the bone
I stand contemplating, reacting alone
Impaled with betrayal
The tourniquet turns
Society's creation
Pole-axed out and burnt

Long ago when man was king, his heart was clean now he's stained class
Time has slashed each untouched thing, so now he's just a stained class king

Transfixed at deliverance, is this all there is
Faithless continuum, into the abyss
Fierce is my conviction, absolute my belief
I spit at you apathy, and seducer deceit

Long ago when man was king, his heart was clean now he's stained class
Time has slashed each untouched thing, so now he's just a stained class king

Lethal, deadly, hung, drawn and quartered
He slaughtered and faltered and altered the world
But by doing so smashed all his hopes and Utopian dreams
Whipping, stripping, peeling the flesh off, relentless and senseless
His lust snapped like vipers whose fangs sank in deep to infest and decay from the core

Impaled with betrayal, the tourniquet turns
Society's creation, pole-axed out and burnt

Long ago when man was king, his heart was clean now he's stained class
Time has slashed each untouched thing, so now he's just a stained class king

Stained class king",Stained Class,1978
Judas Priest,"Solar winds are blowing
Neutron star controlling
All is lost, doomed and tossed, at what cost forever

Meteors fly around me
Comets die, and then they
And then they, you want to see how they try to surround me
I can say, here today, we shall stay forever

If you want to find us in a hurry
Oh let me tell you don't you worry
I can't say, here today, we shall stay forever",Deceiver,1978
Judas Priest,"Came in this morning high on a bird's wing
Quite open minded but still quite aware
Followed the sunrise right through from dawning
Picking out landmarks that said I was there
Led to positions by stern faced leaders
Who never let one smile depart from their face

Then with an arm raise the slaughter is started
One or two crack up and start to cry
Selfishness breeds in this cesspool of sorrow
Every few moments I see I friend die
Synchronized watches flash in the sunlight
As into the battle we are all led

Killer, killer, keep your thoughts at bay
Maiming, destroying, every single day
Is this the way that you get your fun
Slaying, waylaying, in the heat of the midday sun

Get out, get out, go and do your job
Rape and pillage, squander all and rob
You make me sick, getting paid for murder
You wouldn't lay a finger on your mother, oh no
You never ever dream to hurt her

Hero, hero, you have done so well
So sit back and lick your wounds, cause you won't go to hell
Take your medal, wear it now with pride
Consolation for the pain and sin you feel inside",Dying to Meet You,1978
Judas Priest,"Beware of their coming
Take heed our time is near
Fatality relinquish not
Brutality in arms doth seek to destroy.

They smashed through the clouds into the light of the moon
Their steeds were full charging, called destruction and doom
'Twas as if all hell had broke loose on this night
And all in all it was a terrible sight

Now we are taken unto the island of domination

We gotta get, we gotta get, we gotta get out of this place
There's a man with a needle who's pleading to get at my face
Hide me and hold me control free as best as you can
It's all becoming too much, I can't cope, for one man

Now we are taken unto the island of domination

Skyrider, you supersonic flyer
Nightdriver, you demon of desire
Spinesnapper, you tried your best to break us
Throatchoker, you thought that you could take us

The fright of your life, the fright of your life
The fright of your life is here guaranteed
This is no illusion confessing confusion you're freed
Lashings of strappings with beatings competing to win
Oh what a mess I am blessed, dominations set in
Now we are taken unto the island of domination",Island of Domination,1978
Judas Priest,"Where do we go from here
There must be something near
Changing you, changing me forever

Places changes, faces change
Life is so very strange
Changing time, changing rhyme together

There's no where else to go
This could be our last show
Changing dreams, changing schemes never

We are never satisfied

Love is gone, along with fun
Now we're reaching for the gun
Changing cast, changing fast, no more tether

We are never satisfied
",Never Satisfied,1978
Judas Priest,"You're in for surprise
You're in for a shock
In London town streets
When there's darkness and fog
When you least expect me
And you turn your back
I'll attack

I smile when I'm sneaking
Through shadows by the wall
I laugh when I'm creeping
But you won't hear me at all

All hear my warning
Never turn your back
On the ripper

You'll soon shake with fear
Never knowing if I'm near
I'm sly and I'm shameless
Nocturnal and nameless
Except for ""The Ripper""
Or if you like ""Jack The Knife""

Any back alley street
Is where we'll probably meet
Underneath a gas lamp
Where the air's cold and damp
I'm a nasty surprise
I'm a devil in disguise
I'm a footstep at night
I'm a scream of the fright

All hear my warning
Never turn your back
On the ripper, the ripper, the ripper",The Ripper,1978
Judas Priest,"Man eatin momma, steam driven hammer
Sorts the men out from the boys
Takes no messin', all in wrestlin'
Is one of her pride and joys

She a classy, flashy lassy
Imitation sapphire shine
Two faced liar, full of fire
But I know the flame is mine

Rocka rolla woman for a rocka rolla man
You can take her if you want her
If you think you can
Rocka rolla woman for a rocka rolla man
You can take her if you want her you can

She's a grip and choke ya
Heavy smoker
Wrong side of the law

Midnight shady

Judas Priest,"I got home late this evening, stumbled up the stair
I couldn't believe my eyes when I looked in the bedroom there
My woman with a man was lyin' fast asleep
I felt a rage inside me, control I couldn't keep

She was a cheater

I reached the dressing table, kicked away the door
I gripped the cold black metal, a loaded .44
By this time they're awake and they don't know what to do
I scream you cheatin' bitch here's what I think of you

You are a cheater

They both pleaded for mercy, I said no way
When you do this upon me, you have no say
I treated you so real good, and this is what you do
Oh no I've finished with you, your time is through

You are a cheater

If you need a cheater there's nobody sweeter than this one
There's no neater, come on here and meet her
Cheater, cheater, cheater, come on and meet her",Cheater,1979
Judas Priest,"(instrumental)
",Deep Freeze,1979
Judas Priest,"Got no silver in my pockets
Got no pillow for my head
And the winter it gets stronger
Got to ease my aching head

In the morning when I wake up
Get this feeling deep inside
And I wonder if I'll die young
Or I'll go out of my mind

I still get this awful feeling
When the snow falls to the ground
It still sends my senses reeling
Knowing winter's come to town",Winter,1979
Judas Priest,"Now, winter wind fades from my face
My heart will no longer race
Sun smiling down from the sky
Melts away ice from my eye
Warmth, eases back to my soul
Bitterness shrugs then it goes",Winter Retreat,1979
Judas Priest,"I'll be damned, here comes your ghost again
But that's not unusual
It's just that the moon is full
And you decided to call

And here I sit, hand on the telephone
Hearing the voice I'd known
A couple of light years ago
Headed straight for a fall

But we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust
Yes we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust

Now I see you standing with brown leaves all around and snow in your hair
Now we're smiling out the window of the crummy hotel over Washington Square
Our breath comes in white clouds, mingles and hangs in the air
Speaking strictly for me we both could've died then and there

Now you're telling me you're not nostalgic
Then give me another word for it
You were so good with words
And at keeping things vague

'Cause I need some of that vagueness now
It's all come back too clearly, yes, I love you dearly
And if you're offering me diamonds and rust, I've already paid

But we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust
Yes we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust

Diamonds, diamonds and rust
Diamonds, diamonds and rust
Diamonds, diamonds and rust
Diamonds, diamonds and rust",Diamonds and Rust,1979
Judas Priest,"Mercenary battalions
Are poised to strike us down
Terminations conquest
Upon us now full grown

Save me, my heart's open wide
Help me, no question of pride
Save me, my people have died
Total genocide

Devastation hungers
She waits to leap to earth
Imminent liquidation
Before the grand rebirth

Save me, my heart's open wide
Help me, no question of pride
Save me, my people have died
Total genocide

Sin after sin I have endured
Yet the wounds I bear are the wounds of love

Frantic mindless zombies
Grab at fleeting time
Lost in cold perplexion
Waiting for the sign

Generations tremble
Clinging face to face
Helpless situation
To end the perfect race

Flashing senseless sabers
Cut us to the ground
Eager for the life blood
Of all who can be found

Save me, my heart's open wide
Help me, no question of pride
Save me, my people have died
Total genocide

Slice to the left, slice to the right
None to retaliate, none will fight
Chopping at the hearts, snuffing out the lives
This race departs, no one will survive
Heads to the feet, feet to the air
Souls in the soil, heavy in despair
End of all ends, body into dust
To greet death friends, extinction is a must",Genocide,1979
Judas Priest,"Sinner rider, rides in with the storm
The devil rides beside him
The devil is his god, God help you mourn
Do you, do you hear it, do you hear the thunder

See the mountains darken yonder
Black sun rising, time is running out

His steed of fury,
Eyes of fire and mane ablaze
Demonic vultures stalking
Drawn by the smell of war and pain

Searching for the carcasses of war

Disrupts the calm into the storm

Can't you see their blood is boiling setting them alight

Thirty years now sleeping, so sound
War raises its head, and looks slowly around
The Sinner is near, sensing the fear
And the beast will start movin' around

Can't you see their souls calling out in their brain
Can't you hear their blood is boiling setting them alight

Just get a long hard look into the mirror

Go single all the time, up to me

Judas Priest,"You say I waste my life away, but I live it to the full
And how would you know anyway, you're just mister dull
Why don't you get into the things we do today
You could lose twenty years right away, so we say

We don't need, no, no no no parental guidance here

Every day you scream at me to turn the music low
Well if you keep on screaming, you'll make me deaf you know
You always chew me out, because I stay out late
Until your three-piece suit comes back in date, get one thing straight

There's no communication
I'm tired of explanation
Is this message getting through
You went through the same thing too
Don't you remember what it's like to lose control
Put on my jacket - for you get too old

Then we race together.
We can ride forever
Wrapped in horsepower, driving into fury
Changing gear I pull you tighter to me

I'm your turbo lover
Tell me there's no other

We hold each other closer, as we shift to overdrive
And everything goes rushing by, with every nerve alive
We move so fast it seems as though we've taken to the sky
Love machines in harmony, we hear the engines cry.

Tell me there's no other

On and on we're charging to the place so many seek
In perfect synchronicity of which so many speak
We feel so close to heaven in this roaring heavy load
And then in sheer abandonment, we shatter and explode.

And I'm here all alone
When the night comes down
And there's no place to go

Call me and I'll wait till the summer
You never understood
Call me and I'll wait forever
For a love that's only good

The fear closes in
And the nightmares begin

Oh no say it isn't true

Oh can't you see my heart is broken in two

In some magnetic trance
Our beating hearts would dance
And crash down from afar

I'm offered words of strength
They do not comprehend
The passion we possessed

Tell me how I should get through
But they haven't got a clue
No one else comes close to you

I see your eyes before they closed
They looked right inside my soul
And they asked me not to grieve
I tried but still I bleed

I wake up, I break up
Try hard to shake off
The desolation as it grows
As nothing else comes close

And as I stand here by the grave
And the wind calls out your name
I know that time could never heal
The emptiness I feel

People try to give me hope
Tell me how I should let go
But they'll never really know

Rollin' down the M-Way
Took it to the smoke
Banging heads there 'til we all went broke
When we don the leather
And the whips and chains
Nothing matters more, we can't be tamed
Fighting through the din and accolades
Turn the phase around with razor blades
Watched the movement grow into one voice
Took on the whole world it had no choice

Late at night
You're in our sight
Where we can feel what we've been waiting for
Let me hear you roar
On this stage, let it rage
For a time we leave the world behind

Asking where you might have gone
From what I knew before
Some things are worth fighting for

But still I'm rollin' through
Did I see your figure in the haze

I am driven by a thirst
To quench myself of love
The sun beats on me for the price I've paid

Beckoned by the glow of kerosene and tumbleweed

A boy with a gift
A gift that would be the envy of all mankind
To see what no other could - great visions

And the diva in the priest-suit said 

Life lays me down 
Life lays me down 
Boy life lay you down, down 
But my God will still come around around around around around 

And it's a drag queen sheriff of a ghost town 
Probably since the last days of hate
When the mushroom clouds came down 
Smoke signaling too late 
And CNN broke the blow dry grip 
For a flash of the end - like it's some hot tip 

And God
If the last voice I hear on that community screen
Sounds deeper than Yours and doubly as mean
Then the Jedi knight was right 

Life lays me down 
Life lays me down 
Life lay you down 
Life can lay me down 
Life lays me down 
Life lays me down 
Life lay me right down oh now down 
Life can lay me down 
Life can lay me down 
Life can lay me down down down down 
Life can lay me down 
So hard sometimes I even sing light jazz fusion 

And it's a full house flush 
With a bass and a brush 
And a subtle soft shade 
Of the cheekbone blade 

And the world turns around 
The sun which is found 
To be casually gunning
For life overrunning 
In heels 
He squeals and reveals 
God don't cut deals 

Life lays me down 
Life lays me down 
Life can lay me down 
But my God was still coming 
Around around around around around

Jude,"Way down in soho town 
Where the lovely people love to be 
And they all write all their best lines down 
And they hope their hair turns white like Andy 
There's a man who was almost king 
He was lionized when they left the ring
And some time away was soon the end 
And the truth is there's no one you can depend on
And Love, I know you're gone for good 
I can't go back, but I know I should

Chucky's in love with a friend 
You can fall in the arms of each other 
And nothing is like that brother 
And Love, I know you're gone for good 
I can't go back, but I know I should 
Love is larger than letters 
Taking up his sword again 
It was a Mont-Blanc monogrammed pen 
And he wielded the power of his PHD 
While he sat there 
And glouded his green screen tragedy 
And Love, I know you're gone for good

And I ... I laugh at you

I had much more than I wanted
I found much more than I gave

And yet we are turds of great colossal birds

I am lover not recluse

If you, my dear, were such a flower
You would stay and only grow
And I would tend to you and water, baby
And straight up would you go

You would spread and maybe blossom
With each passing summer's day
And not the suitors from a hundred hives
Could draw your love away

Then as autumn shut the light 
Down in advance of winter's bite
According to true lover's creed
You would not die but go to seed

For so it is with paper towels
And other things about my place
The old begets the new
And the things I need keep up to pace

But you, my dear, you're gone forever
You left no silly seed behind
Save a rotten pit it lingers
Cherry tombstone in my mind

You're not a paper towel
You're like the wind goes howling

You fled as if the autumn grays
Were the heralds of final days
Uprooting with your seeds and all
Cruel harvest of love's first fall

The walk of fame,
The Japanese,
Their up against, their trying
To match the hand sizes with the household names,

And keep from bumpin into furry,
Fairy prostitutes, and make it to the corner,
Gonna lose myself inside,

You gotta put the other man down on his knees,
But that's not why I arrived, no,
That was not the reason,

Moving closer I've come to know that there's nothing in there toshow me,

And I can help you run the three minute mile,

Maybe a few

It's been a while
I would crawl back to you and say thanks I needed that
It's been a while

Smoother skinned than most she was and beautiful and just because I thought I'd 
Be a doomsday gift I placed the rift
Callous first and cavalier dropping verses she could hear the sad refrain

And the world was in her closet while she dressed for her groom.

There were angels above her and furs on the floor.

Is my two front teeth
My two front teeth
See my two front teeth

Gee, if I could only
Have my two front teeth
Then I could with you
""Merry Christmas.""

And we can sing it together, so I don't cry all alone
Seems I don't know where to go, since she went away
And the room's spinning faster, as the record plays
It's the one that reminds me of much better days
I'm in the mood for a memory, one that lives on and on
If I relive the laughter, then it won't feel like she's gone
I can't remember when I smiled, since she went away
I keep reaching behind me, today's so hard to face
And the silence reminds me of much better days
And it's too long to morning, since she's not in my sights
She's the one that could move me, but she's out of sight

One little girl and one big little man
Five years younger, she cried like the thunder
I watched her reach ten and never saw her again
From one boys home to one prison cell
Mary I've known this world's bitter hell
But come this winter I'll see my parole
And watch the heads turn, down the aisle we stroll

Are you still Crying Mary, the girl I knew before
Your mama used to come here, she don't come no more
But she left a picture of you at seventeen
And every day since then, Mary you have been my dream

For years I've waited, alone in the dark
Thinking of you through a young boy's heart
Over and over, the price that I've paid
Was watching you cry as they drove me away

Are you still Crying Mary, the girl I knew before
So many times I've wondered, behind these doors
Will we be together, the way it used to be
Now that you are older, Mary do you think of me

Are you still Crying Mary, the girl I knew before
Your mama used to come here, she don't come no more
Just this worn out picture that carries everything
But there's no way of knowing, Mary do you think of me

Jude Cole,"To watch her walk away was all that I could take
I had to stop my feet from making a fool of me
Now I make a point of staying far away
From this kind of activity

And I start to wonder why

Everyone's in love, isn't that enough
Love, stay away from me

So watch me walk away, call it a draw and say
Goodbye Shangri-La, your beauty is lost on me
I don't see the point of going through obsession
Just for some intimacy
'Cause I just want to go sit back in an easy chair
And watch the next guy try

Everyone's in love, isn't that enough
Love, stay away from me
Everyone's in love, isn't that enough (I don't get it)
Love, stay away from me

Does anybody see the same thing I see
Making history instead of making love
And I haven't a hope if I'm gonna get the girl
By giving up the world
But I've done it over and over again
I'm just gonna go kick back in an easy chair
And watch and wonder why

You give your heart then it's not enough

You swear you won't make the same mistakes
But hey baby, that's the way it goes
First your money, then your clothes

Oh no, love ain't cheap
There's a toll booth up on Lover's Leap
Sweet romance take a chance
Come and dance with me

Those were the days
One thing's for sure in this town, baby
Being pretty pays
But all the fame and riches
Gonna turn out to be Fool's gold
When you look to find shelter in
The ones you bought and sold

So sad, so alone
It cuts right to the bone
When you find out how it feels to hit the ground
When it comes around

You better look over your shoulder, honey
You're losin' your touch

Down the open road

She could take away my homesick blues
And lately I feel a little crazy too

Come on sweet thing, show me how love feels

Sail above the clouds

There are no bars across these windows,

If wisdom's hammer was in our hands,

That none of this was true

And when you doubt you make me smile
I tune out the world
And all the sadness disappeared like magic
And love was all that remained
You can't run, you can't hide from my love

Never I thought but I was wrong
Have to make sure every morning
Wasn't a dream 'cause that's what it seems
But you're real I can't stop fallin'
A deep connection, oh, your imperfection
I wouldn't change you at all
You can't run no, you can't hide from my love

People can say what they want
I really don't care at all
I know this love is for real
And I don't care about the way they feel
'Cause I know that I'd trade it all for you

Dorothy's begging for trouble
She is insisting I give her this needle
Darling one thing I want you to know
Don't blame me for where the needle goes

I push it in, she pulls it out
I push it back, she starts to shout:
""Dr. Kitch, you are terrible,
I can't stand the sight of your needle.""

She lied down in such a position
It was difficult to give this injection
She starts holding on to the needle
Making me so uncomfortable
I said 'darling, can't you be steady,
I'm going to have it in very shortly'
She said 'Dr. Kitch I am sorry,
But the sight of the needle frightens me'

I push it in, she pulls it out
I push it back, she starts to shout:
""Dr. Kitch, you are terrible,
I can't stand the sight of your needle.""

She still wouldn't lie down quietly
Constantly moving her body
So I slap her in the face with vexation
And go on giving the injection
She screams 'Doctor stop it, I can't stand the pain,
I don't think your inside the right vein'
I said 'You little fool you wouldn't be told,
The needle must be sticking in the wrong hole!'

I push it in, she pulls it out
I push it back, she starts to shout:
""Dr. Kitch, you are terrible,
I can't stand the sight of your needle.""

I pull it from the hole and start again
I have the needle now in the right vein
The needle's just in half an inch
The stupid young lady start to flinch
Suddenly she calls 'Doc it's working!
I can feel the pennicilin going in'
I said 'You silly fool, look what you do
The needle's gonna break inside of you!'

I push it in, she pulls it out
I push it back, she starts to shout:

Pulling tricks looking slick at all times when I'm flipping

Still tippin' on four fours wrapped in four fours
Pimping four hoes and I'm packing four fours

Five percent tint so you can't see up in my window
These niggas don't understand cause I'm Boss Hogg on candy
Top down at Maxi's wit a big glock nine handy
Pieced up creased up staying dressed to impress
Big boss belt buckle under my Mitchell and Ness
Oh, Gucci shades up on my braids when I Escalade
When I'm riding Sprewells sliding like a escapade

They didn't know that eventually I'd be the one to worry about
When someone would mention me, they always tried to say I would flop
But this the sound of revenge

Yea
On the path to find out who's true
The only person you can really trust is you
And if you feel like you can't even trust you
Then you can always trust you know who
And if you don't know who you know who is
Then I feel so sorry for you
Cause that's really the only person that can judge you
Critics, people that wanna see you fail will tell you what you can't do
Shouldn't do and must do
But when you got that glow
Nobody else's words can really budge you

Revenge has always been looked upon as a sin
And sometimes you feel like you had to sin to win
Sometime it sound like :gunshot: 
Is what it coulda been
When you get to the gates of Heaven they probably wouldn't let ya in
But ya change that meanin' up and success is what it is in the end
And instead of worryin' about what shoulda, coulda, woulda been
Ya turn your head toward the future and keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Well say it again
Keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Screw it then
Know what I'm sayin?

If you're waitin' for me to fail, your time is runnin' out on that clock

A gauge of the deadliest trap ever laid

You can ask me where I'll go

Judge Mental,"Now if there's a smile upon my face 
it's only there trying to fool the public
but when it comes down to fooling you 
now honey that's quite a diff'rent subject
Don't let my glad expression 
give you the wrong impression really I'm sad
Oh, sadder than sad, you're gone and I'm hurting so bad
like a clown I pretend to be glad
 
Now there's some sad things known to man 
but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown, when there's no one around
Oh yeah, baby,
 
Now if I appear to be carefree, 
it's only to camouflage my sadness
in order to shield my pride 
I try to cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But Don't let my show convince you 
that I've been happy since you decided to go,
I need you so, I'm hurt and I want you to know
but for others I put on a show
 
Now there's some sad things known to man 
but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown,
when there's no one around
 
Just like Pagliacci did
I try to keep my sadness hid
smiling in the public eye
but in my lonely room I cry 
the tears of a clown
Oh, yeah baby
 
Now, if there's a smile on my face
Don't let my glad expression
Give you a wrong impression
Don't let this smile I wear
Make you think that I don't care 
 
Now there's some sad things known to man 
but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown, when there's no one around",Tears of a Clown,
Judi Connelli,"Tell me where
Where is it written
What is it I was meant to be?
That I can't dare
It all began the day I found
That from my window I could only see
A piece of sky
I stepped outside and looked around
I never dreamed it was so wide
Or even half as high
The time had come
(Papa, can you hear me?)
To try my wings
(Papa, are you near me?)
And even thought it seemed at any moment I could fall
I felt the most
(Papa, can you see me?)
Amazing things
(Can you understand me?)
The things you can't imagine
If you've never flown at all
Though it's safer to stay on the ground
Sometimes where danger lies
There the sweetest of pleasures are found
No matter where I go
There'll be memories that tug at my sleeve
But there will also be
More to question, yet more to believe
Oh tell me where?
Where is the someone who will turn and look at me?
And want to share
My every sweet-imagined possibility?
The more I live - the more I learn
The more I learn - the more I realize
The less I know
Each step I take 
(Papa, I've a voice now!)
Each page I turn 
(Papa, I've a choice now!)
Each mile I travel only means
The more I have to go
What's wrong with wanting more?
If you can fly - then soar!
With all there is - why settle for
Just a piece of sky?
Papa, I can hear you
Papa, I can see you
Papa, I can feel you
Papa, watch me fly!",Piece of Sky [From Yentl],1997
Judi Connelli,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when",Where or When [From Babes in Arms],1997
Judi Connelli,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,2003
Judi Connelli,"Look at how she looks at me
I can never look at her that way
Full of all the feelings and the soft
Unspoken words that lovers say
In all the words, in all the books
I wish there were a way to say that
What she's taught me
Isn't written anywhere
And I'm supposed to be the one
Who's wise
One thing is certain
I can never be what she 
Expects of me
I've wanted the shadows
I don't anymore
No matter what happens
I won't anymore
I've run from the sunlight
Afraid it saw too much
The moon had the one light
I bathed in
I walked in
I held in my feelings
And closed every door
No matter what happens
I can't anymore
There's someone who must hear
The words I've never spoken
Tonight if he were here
My silence would be broken
I need him to touch me
To know the love that's in my heart
The same heart that tells me
To see myself
To free myself
To be myself at last!
For too many mornings
The curtains were drawn
It's time they were opened
To welcome the dawn
A voice deep inside
Is getting stronger
I can't keep it quiet any longer
No matter what happens
It can't be the same anymore
I promise it won't be the same
Anymore!
",No Matter What Happens,2003
Judi Connelli,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening [From South Pacific],2004
Judi Dench,"Le cinema today is in a crisis.
Directors are so existentialistes.
The movies are not worth their entrance prices
If no one sings a love song when he's kissed.
Contini! I want a musical!
Love cannot be love without 'le singing',
A string, a clarinet, a saxophone.
Take a lesson from this old Parisian
And the finest entertainment she/he has known.

Folies Bergeres
What a showing of color, costume, and dancing!
Not a moment in life could be more entrancing
Than an evening you spend aux Folies Bergeres.

Folies Bergeres,
Not a soul in the world could be in despair when he
Is glancing
At the fabulous stage des Folies Bergeres.
Think of the footlights bright and gleaming,
Le strip-tease, le can-can we all adore.
Life is too short without dreaming,
And dreams are what le cinema is for.

How could you tell me that you're goin' away? 
Don't say that we must part,

This little dream might fade?

Pour agresser, serrer les poings
Mais nos paumes sont pour aimer
Y'a pas de caresse en fermant les mains

Longues, jointes en une prière
Bien ouvertes pour acclamer

Suffit d'une ou deux secondes
À peine un geste, un autre monde
Quand on ouvre nos mains

Mécanique simple et facile
Des veines et dix métacarpiens
Des phalanges aux tendons dociles
Et tu relâches ou bien tu retiens

Et des ongles faits pour griffer
Poussent au bout du mauvais côté
Celui qui menace ou désigne

Quand on ouvre nos mains
Suffit de rien dix fois rien

Suffit d'une ou deux secondes

Un simple geste d'humain
Quand se desserrent ainsi nos poings
Quand s'écartent nos phalanges
Sans méfiance, une arme d'échange
Des champs de bataille en jardin

Le courage du signe indien
Un cadeau d'hier à demain
Rien qu'un instant d'innocence
Un geste de reconnaissance
Quand on ouvre comme un écrin

Await the coming day
One star outshines the others
So bright as if to say
This is a special morning

Long ago, far away
In a stable bare
Look and see, he sleeps so peacefully
As if the cold of night were never there
Bless all the little children
Whenever they may lay
Somewhere a child is sleeping
A child was born on christmas day.

So we might love each other
In peace and honor's way
Somewhere a child is sleeping
A child was born on christmas day
To save the world from sadness
His troubled life he gave
To offer hope and gladness
Our weary souls to save
To comfort us in trouble
To guide us ev'ryday
One hope for life eternal
A child was born on christmas day

Long ago, far away
In a stable bare
Look and see he sleeps so peacefully
As if the cold of night were never there
Bless all the little children
Where ever they may lay
Somewhere a child is sleeping
A child was born on christmas day.
So we might love each other
In peace and honor's way
Somewhere a child is sleeping
A child was born on christmas day.

You're always window shopping but never stopping to buy
So shed those dowdy feathers and fly a little bit

There's another Georgy deep inside
Bring out all the love you hide and, oh, what a change there'd be

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be.

I look back in my life through the pages of time
And the days of my life with you

When we ran in the sunlight with love on our faces
And laughed at the world through the rain
There were days of my life filled with people and places
And I wish I could live them again

And it's sad to see it end and to know I will spend
All the days of my life without you

Said he wished I was eleven years older

Judith Durham,"I came from the dream-time
From the dusty red-soil plains
I am the ancient heart
The keeper of the flame
I stood upon the rocky shores
I watched the tall ships come
For forty thousand years I've been
The first Australian

I came upon the prison ship
Bowed down by iron chains
I bought the land, endured the lash
And waited for the rains
I'm a settler, I'm a farmer's wife
On a dry and barren run
A convict, then a free man
I became Australian

I'm the daughter of a digger
Who sought the mother lode
The girl became a woman 
On the long and dusty road
I'm a child of the Depression
I saw the good times come
I'm a bushie, I'm a battler
I am Australian

We are one, but we are many
And from all the lands on earth we come
We'll share a dream and sing with one voice
""I am, you are, we are Australian""

I'm a teller of stories
I'm a singer of songs
I am Albert Namatjira
And I paint the ghostly gums
I'm Clancy on his horse
I'm Ned Kelly on the run
I'm the one who waltzed Matilda
I am Australian

I'm the hot wind from the desert
I'm the black soil of the plains
I'm the mountains and the valleys
I'm the drought and flooding rains
I am the rock, I am the sky
The rivers when they run
The spirit of this great land
I am Australian

We are one, but we are many
And from all the lands on earth we come
We'll share a dream and sing with one voice

Das mit den Fenstern wird wohl erstmal so bleiben
Man muss ja nicht sehen, was die Anderen so treiben

Sind nicht so, wie sie mal waren

Sie trinken Tee aus zerbrochenen Tassen
Man muss manchmal einfach laufen lassen
Und nur wie für die, die an den Wänden verblassen
Sagen sie: „Schaut, vor dem Haus wird wieder gefegt!“
Bevor der Staub sich noch legt

Sie bauen neue Türen in ihre wandlosen Zimmer
„Immer nur jammern würde alles verschlimmern“

Er führt die Parade derer, die noch zu retten sind
Sie tragen die Anderen in ihren Betten
Und der mit dem Megafon sagt: „Alles muss raus“
Und malt ein Kreuz an mein Haus

Und der im Radio sagt „Hey, was machst du da?

In the darkness, when I'm frightened,

Though I'm far dear, though were parted,
I know that time can change nothing.
So if you feel afraid, and if your hope is gone,
Just remember all these things I promise you. 

I will move heaven,
I will move hell and earth to be where you are.
I will move heaven,
And it might take my life,
It might take forever,
But I promise you.

As I sail through, stormy seas dear,
You come to still my heart.
As I walk through, a path of danger,
You lead me through the dark.

Though I'm far dear, and though were parted,
I know that time can change nothing.
So if you feel alone, and if your faith is gone,
Just remember all these things I promised you.

I will move hell and earth to be where you are.

On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Was pre-ordained a mighty plan
That I should walk with Him alone
The cords of trust unbroken


But fate foresaw my wandering eye
That none could yet restrain
To violate the friendship I
Would cause Him so much pain


Chorus:
And everytime I close my eyes
I see the nails, I hear the cries
He did not keep Himself away
He was no stranger to my pain
He walked a mile in my shoes
He walked a mile


Feet so dusty cracked with heat
But carried on by love's heartbeat
A man of sorrows filled with grief
Forgiveness was His anthem


No feeble blow from tongue or pen
Could ever sway my love for Him
Across the echoed hills He trod
And reached into my world.

Judy Allen,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
 
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee",Me and Bobby McGee,1998

At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,

And all the while You make me smile

You say the things that I love to hear 
Calm into my turbulence and bringing hope to my despair

Judy Barnett,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Judy Collins,"[Chorus]
I know where I'm going
I know who's going with me
I know who I love
And the devil knows who I'll marry

I have stockings of silk
Shoes of bright green leather
Combs to buckle my hair
And a ring for every finger

Feather beds are soft
Painted rooms are bonny
I would trade them all
For my handsome whim some Johnny

Some say he's bad
I say he's bonny
Fairest of them all
My handsome whim some Johnny

Judy Collins,"A fair young maid was in her garden
Strange young man came riding by
He said fair maid, will you marry me?
And this answer was her reply

Oh no kind sir I cannot marry thee
For I've a love and he sails the sea
And though he's been gone for seven years
Still he will return to me

Well, what if he's in some battle slain
Or if he's been drowned in the deep salt sea
Or if he's found another love
And he and his love both married be

If he's in some battle slain
Then I shall die when the moon doth wane
And if he's drowned in the deep salt sea
Still I'm true to his memory

And if he's found another love
And he and his love both married be
I wish them health and happiness
Where they live across the sea

He picked her up in his arms so strong
And kisses he gave her one two three
Said weep no more my own true love
I am your long lost John Riley

Said weep no more my own true love
I am your long lost John Riley",John Riley,1961

Place where I was partly raised

Your friends may say that I'm a stranger
My face they'll never see no more
There is but one promise that's given
I'll sail on God's golden shore

All through this world I'm bound to ramble
Through sun and wind and drivin' rain
I'm bound to ride the western railway
Perhaps I'll take the very next train

Like a banshee's lonely croon
And a thousand blades were flashin'

Far above their shining weapons
Hung their own immortal green

Foreign strike the marchin' tune
And hurrah me boys for Ireland

Well, they fought for poor old Ireland
And full bitter was their fate

Tell me soon to give me joy
None will I have but my sailor boy

Oh no kind lady he's not here
He drowned in the gulf and we buried him there
Upon the island as we passed by
There we left your sailor boy

Just like some lady in great despair
Called for a chair to sit her down
Penningdon for to write it down

Oh dig my grave wide and deep
Put a marble stone at the head and feet
On my grave a turtle dove
Tell the world I died for my love

Judy Collins,"Oh, woe be to the orders
That marched my love away
And woe be to the bitter tears
I shed upon this day

And woe be to the bloody wars
Of high Germany
For they've carried off my own true love
Left a broken heart to bleed

The drums beat in the morning
Before the break of day
And the wee, wee pipes played loud and shrill
While yet the morn was gray

And the bonnie flags were all unfurled
Was a gallant sight to see
But sorrow for my soldier lad
Who marched to Germany

Oh, woe be to the orders
That marched my love away
And woe be to the bitter tears
I shed upon this day

And woe be to the country
Where our men are forced to be
And woe be to the foreign wars
That stole my love from me

The cause of greatest fame am I
The cause of proudest care on high
To have for mine, the king of all

And though You are the king of all
They sent You to the manger stall
Where at Your feet they all shall fall
And glorify my child the king

There shone a star above three kings,
To guide them to the king of kings.
They held You in their humble arms
And knelt before You until dawn.

They gave You myrrh they gave You gold
Frankincense and gifts untold
They traveled far these gifts to bring,
And glorify their newborn king.

And cry for the sun

Sang the crow on the cradle 

And if it should be that this baby's a girl

With rings on her fingers 
And bells on her toes 
And a bomber above her wherever she goes

To build you a coffin and dig you a grave 
Hush-a-bye little one, never you weep 
For we've got a toy that can put you to sleep 
Sang the crow on the cradle 

Bring me my gun, and I'll shoot that bird dead

When the sun shines hot
On every stone

And I'll teach him for to swim in the foam

Like a jolly plough boy she whistles and she sings
And comes home in the evening with the dew on her wings

He goes whistlin' and singin' through yonder long shade

I buyed me a little bull he was four inches high
Everybody feared him who ever heard him cry
When he began to bellow he made such melodious sound
That all the walls in London came tumblin' to the ground

I buyed me a flock of sheep thought they were all wethers
Sometimes they yielded wool sometimes yielded feathers
I know mine are the very best sheep for yield and increase
Every full and turn of the moon they bring forth lambs and geese
Sing terry O day
Sing taddle day

I buyed me a little glass colored it was green
In it was all the wonders man has ever seen
I put in my pocket tied up with a cloth
Cried and cried the day I found that it had been lost

Judy Collins,"I am a queen's daughter
I come from Capakin
In search of Lord Gregory
Pray God I find him

The rain beats on my yellow head
The dew wets my skin
My wee babe's cold in my arms
Lord Gregory, let me in

Lord Gregory, he is not here
I swear can't be seen
He's gone to bonny Scotland
For to bring home a fair queen

So leave now these portals
And likewise this hall
For it's deep in the sea
You should find you downfall

Oh don't you remember, love
That night in Capakin
When we exchanged rings, love
And I against my will

Yours was pure silver
And mine was but tin
Yours cost a guinea
And mine but a pin

My curse on you, mother
My curse being sore
I dreamed that my true love
Come a knocking at the door

Lie down now, my foolish son
Lie down and sleep
Twas only a servant girl
Lies drowned in the deep

Go saddle my black horse
The brown or the bay
Go saddle the fastest horse
In my stable this day

I'll ride over mountains
And valleys so wide
I'll find the girl that I love
And ride by her side",Lord Gregory,1965
Judy Collins,"You've long been on the open road you've been sleepin' in the rain
From dirty words and muddy cells your clothes are soiled and stained
But the dirty words and the mud of cells will soon be judged insane
So only stop and rest yourself and you'll be off again

Oh take off your thirsty boots
And stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh
And maybe I can try
Lookin' for the evenin'
And the mornin' in your eyes

Then tell me of the ones you saw
As far as you could see
Across the plains from field to town
Marchin' to be free
And of the rusted prison gates that tumble by degree
Like laughing children one by one
They look like you and me

So take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh and maybe I can try
Just lookin' for the evenin' and the mornin' in your eyes

I know you are no stranger down the crooked rainbow trial
From dancing cliff edge shattered sills to slander shackled jails
Where the voices drift up from below as walls are bein' scaled
Yes all of this and more my friend your song shall not be failed

Oh take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary, from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh, and maybe I can try
Just lookin for the evenin' and the mornin' in your eyes

So take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh and maybe I can try
Lookin' for the evenin' and the mornin' in your eyes",Thirsty Boots,1965
Judy Collins,"Why all these bugles crying for squads of young men drilled
To kill and to be killed and waiting by this train?
Why the orders loud and hoarse, why the engine's groaning cough
As it strains to drag us off into the holocaust?
Why crowds who sing and cry, and shout and fling us flowers
And trade their right for ours to murder and to die?

The dove has torn her wings so no more songs of love
We are not here to sing, we're here to kill the dove

Why has this moment come when childhood has to die
When hope shrinks to a sigh and speech into a drum?
Why are they pale and still, young boys trained overnight
Conscripts forced to fight and dressed in gray to kill?
These rain clouds massing tight, this train load battle bound
This moving burial ground sent thundering toward the night

Why statues towering brave above the last defeat
Old word and lies repeat across the new made grave?
Why the same still birth that victory always brought
These hoards of glory bought by men with mouths of earth?
Dead ash without a spark where cities glittered bright
For guns probe every light and crush it in the dark

And why your face undone with jagged lines of tears
That gave in those first years all peace I ever won?
Your body in the gloom, the platform fading back
Your shadow on the track, a flower on a tomb
And why these days ahead when I must let you cry
And live prepared to die as if our love were dead?

",La Colombe,1966
Judy Collins,"Got up sometime in the afternoon
And you didn't feel like much
You said to yourself, ""Where are you, golden boy
Where is your famous golden touch?""

I thought you knew where
All the elephants lie down
I thought you were the crown prince
Of all the wheels in Ivory town

Look at your body now
Where there's nothing much to say
And a bitter voice in the mirror says
""Hey prince, you need a shave""

Now if you can manage to get
Your trembling fingers to behave
Why don't you try unwrapping
A stainless steel razor blade?

That's right, it's come to this
It's come to this
And wasn't it a long way down?
And wasn't it a strange way down?

There's no hot water
And the cold is running thin
Well, what do you expect
From the kind of places you've been living in?

Don't drink from that cup
It's all caked and cracked along the rim
That's not the electric light, my friend
That is your vision that is dim

Cover up your face with soap, there
Now, you're Santa Claus
And you've got an A for anyone
Who will give you his applause

I thought you were a racing man
Ah, but you couldn't take the pace
That's a funeral in the mirror
And it's stopping at your face

That's right, it's come to this
It's come to this
And wasn't it a long way down?
And wasn't it a strange way down?

Once there was a path
And a girl with chestnut hair
And you spent the summers
Picking all the berries that grew there

There were times she was a woman
There were times she was a child
As you held her in the shadows
Where the raspberries grow wild

And you climbed the highest mountains
And you sang about the view
And everywhere you went
Love went along with you

That's a hard one to remember
It makes you clench your fist
And the veins stand out like highways
All along your wrist

And yes, it's come to this
It's come to this
And wasn't it a long way down?
Wasn't it a strange way down?

You can still find a job
Go out and talk to a friend
On the back of every magazine
There are coupons you can send

Why don't you join the Rosicrucians?
They will give you back your hope
You can find your love in diagrams
In a plain, brown envelope

But you've used up all your coupons
Except the one that seems
To be tattooed on your arm
Along with several thousand dreams

Now Santa Claus comes forward
That's a razor in his mitt
And he puts on his dark glasses
And he shows you where to hit

And then the cameras pan
The stand in stuntman's
Dress rehearsal rag

",Dress Rehearsal Rag,1966
Judy Collins,"Suzanne takes you down to her place by the river
You can hear the boats go by, you can spend the night forever
And you know that she's half crazy that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges that come all the way from China
And just when you want to tell her that you have no love to give her
She gets you on her wavelength and lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you think you'll may be trust her
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind

And Jesus was a sailor when He walked upon the water
And He spent a long time watching from a lonely wooden tower
And when He knew for certain only drowning men could see Him
He said, ""All men shall be sailors then until the sea shall free them""
But He Himself was broken long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone

And you want to travel with Him
And you want to travel blind
And you think you'll maybe trust Him
For He's touched your perfect body with his mind

Suzanne takes you down to her place by the river
You can hear the boats go by you can spend the night forever
And the sun pours down like honey on our lady of the harbor
And she shows you where to look among the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed, there are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love and they will lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds the mirror

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you think maybe you trust  her
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind",Suzanne,1966
Judy Collins,"The lady comes to the gate dressed in lavender and leather
Looking North to the sea she finds the weather fine
She hears the steeple bells ringing through the orchard
All the way from town
She watches seagulls fly
Silver on the ocean stitching through the waves
The edges of the sky

Many people wander up the hills
From all around you
Making up your memories and thinking they have found you
They cover you with veils of wonder as if you were a bride
Young men holding violets are curious to know if you have cried
And tell you why
And ask you why
Any way you answer

Lace around the collars of the blouses of the ladies
Flowers from a Spanish friend of the family
The embroid'ry of your life holds you in
And keeps you out but you survive
Imprisoned in your bones
Behind the isinglass windows of your eyes

And in the night the iron wheels rolling through the rain
Down the hills through the long grass to the sea
And in the dark the hard bells ringing with pain
Come away alone

Even now by the gate with you long hair blowing
And the colors of the day that lie along your arms
You must barter your life to make sure you are living
And the crowd that has come
You give them the colors
And the bells and wind and the dream

Will there never be a prince who rides along the sea and the mountains
Scattering the sand and foam into amethyst fountains
Riding up the hills from the beach in the long summer grass
Holding the sun in his hands and shattering the isinglass?

Day and night and day again and people come and go away forever
While the shining summer sea dances in the glass of your mirror
While you search the waves for love and your visions for a sign
The knot of tears around your throat is crystallizing into your design

And in the night the iron wheels rolling through the rain
Down the hills through the long grass to the sea
And in the dark the hard bells ringing with pain
Come away alone
Come away alone with me.",Albatross,1967
Judy Collins,"Bien sûr, nous eûmes des orages
Vingt ans d'amour, c'est l'amour fol
Mille fois tu pris ton bagage
Mille fois je pris mon envol
Et chaque meuble se souvient

Dans cette chambre sans berceau
Des éclats des vieilles tempêtes
Plus rien ne ressemblait à rien
Tu avais perdu le goût de l'eau
Et moi celui de la conquête

Mais mon amour
Mon doux mon tendre mon merveilleux amour
De l'aube claire jusqu'à la fin du jour
Je t'aime encore tu sais je t'aime

Moi, je sais tous tes sortilèges
Tu sais tous mes envoûtements
Tu m'as gardé de pièges en pièges
Je t'ai perdue de temps en temps
Bien sûr tu pris quelques amants

Il fallait bien passer le temps
Il faut bien que le corps exulte
Finalement finalement
Il nous fallut bien du talent
Pour être vieux sans être adultes

Oh, mon amour
Mon doux mon tendre mon merveilleux amour
De l'aube claire jusqu'à la fin du jour
Je t'aime encore, tu sais, je t'aime

Et plus le temps nous fait cortège
Et plus le temps nous fait tourment
Mais n'est-ce pas le pire piège
Que vivre en paix pour des amants
Bien sûr tu pleures un peu moins tôt

Je me déchire un peu plus tard
Nous protégeons moins nos mystères
On laisse moins faire le hasard
On se méfie du fil de l'eau
Mais c'est toujours la tendre guerre

De l'aube claire jusqu'à la fin du jour
Je t'aime encore tu sais je t'aime

Judy Collins,"I loved you in the morning, our kisses deep and warm
Your hair upon the pillow like a sleepy golden storm
Many loved before us, I know that we are not new
In city and in forest they smiled like me and you

Now it's come to distances and both of us must try
Your eyes are soft with sorrow
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye

I'm not looking for another as I wander in my time
Walk me to the corner, our steps will always rhyme
You know my love goes with you as your love stays with me
It's just the way it changes like the shoreline and the sea

But let's not talk of love or chains and things we can't untie
Your eyes are soft with sorrow
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye

I loved you in the morning, our kisses deep and warm
Your hair upon the pillow like a sleepy golden storm

When I am Lord at last
And your body is the little highway shrine
That all my priests have passed
That all my priests have passed?

My priests, they will put flowers there
They will kneel before the glass
But they'll wear away your little window, love
They will trample on the grass
They will trample on the grass

And who will shoot the arrow
That men will follow through your grace
When I am Lord of memories
And all your armor has turned to lace
And all your armor has turned to lace?

The simple life of heroes
The twisted life of saints
They just confuse the sunny calendar
With their red and golden paint
With their red and golden paint

And all of you have seen the dance
That God has kept from me
But he has seen me watching you
When all your minds were free
When all your minds were free

And who will write love songs for you
When I am Lord at last
And your body is the little highway shrine
That all my priests have passed

I hope that you can just let it go by.
If I, if I have been untrue

When I was seventeen, I used to know you
Well, I haven't seen you, many is the short year
And the last time I seen you
You said you'd joined the Church of Jesus
Well me, I remember your long red hair falling in our faces
As you kissed me
And I want you to know, I just had to go
I want you to know, we just had to grow
And you're probably married now
House and car and all
And you turned into a grownup male stranger
And if I was lying with you now
I'd just have to fall

We parted so hard
Me, rushing round Britain with a guitar
Making love to people
That I didn't even like to see
Well, I would think of you
Yes, I mean in the sick sad morning
And in the lonely midnight
Try to hold your face before me

And I want you to know, I just had to go
And I want you to know, we just had to grow
And you're probably married now, kids and all
And you turned into a grownup male stranger
And if I was lying with you now
I wouldn't be here at all

I never slept with you
But we must have made love a thousand times
For we were just young, didn't have no place to go
Yet in the wide hills and by many a long water
You have gathered flowers, and did they not smell for me?
And I want you to know, we just had to grow
And I want you to know, I just had to go

And she's ready to sail
The crew they are anxious
To follow the whale
Where the icebergs do float
And the stormy winds blow
Where the land and the ocean
Is covered with snow

The cold coast of Greenland
Is barren and bare
No see time nor harvest
Is ever known there
And the birds here sing sweetly
In mountain and dale
But there's no bird in Greenland
To sing to the whale

There is no habitation 
For a man to live there
And the king of that country
Is the fierce Greenland bear
And there'll be no temptation
To tarry long there
With our ship under full
We will homeward repair

Farewell to Tarwathie
Adieu Mormond Hill
And the dear land of Crimmond
I bid you farewell
I'm bound off for Greenland
And ready to sail
In hopes to find riches
In hunting the whale",Farewell to Tarwathie,1970
Judy Collins,"Jacob's heart bent with fear,
Like a bow with death for its arrow,
In Vain he search for the final truth
To set his soul free of doubt.

Over the mountains he walked,
With his head bent searching for reasons,
Then he called out to God
For help and climbed to the top of a hill.

Wind swept the sunlight through the wheat fields,
In the orchard the nightingale sang,
While the plums that she broke with her brown beak,
Tomorrow would turn in to songs.

Then she flew up through the rain
With the sun silver bright on her feathers,
Jacob put back his frowns and sighed and walked 
Back down the hill.

God doesn't answer me and 
He never will.",Nightingale II,1970
Judy Collins,"Come, all of you who are not satisfied
As rulers in a lone wallpapered room
Full of mute birds and flowers that falsely bloom
And closets choked with dreams that long ago died

Come, let us sweep the old streets like a bride
Sweep out the dead leaves with a relentless broom
Prepare for spring as if he were our groom
For whose light footstep eagerly we bide

We'll sweep out the shadows, where the rats long fed
Sweep out our shame and in its place we'll make
A bower for love, a splendid marriage bed
Fragrant with flowers a quiver for the spring

And when he comes, our murdered dreams shall wake
And when he comes, all the mute birds shall sing
And when he comes, all the mute birds shall sing

",Prothalamium,1970
Judy Collins,"'Tis the gift to be simple
'Tis the gift to be free
'Tis the gift to come down where we ought to be
And when we find ourselves in the place just right
It will be in the valley of love and delight

When true simplicity is gained
To bow and to bend, we will not be ashamed
To turn, turn, will be our delight
'Til by turning, turning, we come round right

Judy Collins,"Sons of the thief, sons of the saint
Who is the child with no complaint

The cries at night, the nightmare fears

All were children like yourown

But sons of tycoons or sons of the farm
All of their children run from your arms
Through fields of gold through fields of ruin

In towering waves in walls of flesh
Among dying birds trembling with death

Judy Collins,"There are places I remember all my life
Though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some are gone and some remain
All these places have their meanings
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning

Is all my time together;
Take the rugged sunny days,
The warm and rocky weather,
Take the roads that I have walked along,
Looking for tomorrow's time,
Peace of mind.

As my life spills into yours,
Changing with the hours
Filling up the world with time,
Turning time to flowers,
I can show you all the songs
That I never sang to one man before.

We have seen a million stone lying by the water,
You have climbed the hills with me 
To the mountain shelter.
Taken off the days, one by one,
Setting them to breathe in the sun.

Take the lilies and the lace
From the days of childhood,
All the willow winding paths
Leading up and outward.
This is what I give
This is what I ask you for;
Nothing more",Since You Asked,1971
Judy Collins,"The door it opened slowly
And my father he came in
I was nine years old

And he stood so far above me
And his blue eyes they were shining
And his voice was very cold

He said, ""I've had a vision
And you know I'm strong and holy
I must do what I've been told""

So he started up the mountain
I was running, he was walking
And his axe was made of gold

You who build these altars now
To sacrifice these children
You must not do it anymore

For you never had a vision
And you never have been tempted
By the Devil or the Lord

Yes, you who stand above them now
Your hatchets blunt and bloody
You were not there before

When I lay upon a mountain
And my father's hand was trembling
With the beauty of the word

And if you call me brother now
Forgive me if I ask
""According to whose plan?""

When it all comes down to dust
I will kill you if I must
I will love you if I can

And may I never learn to scorn
The body out of chaos born
The woman and the man

And mercy on our uniform
Man of peace, man of war
The peacock spreads his fan

Judy Collins,"Across the morning sky,
All the bird are leaving,
Ah, how can they know it's time for them to go?
Before the winter fire,

Who knows where the time goes?

Sad deserted shore,
Your fickle friends are leaving,
Ah, but then you know it's time for them to go,
But I will still be here,
I have no thought of leaving.

And I'm not alone,
While my love is near me,

Judy Collins,"I woke up, it was a Chelsea morning
And the first thing that I heard
Was a song outside my window
The traffic wrote the words
It came ringing up like Christmas bells
Rapping up like pipes and drums

Oh, won't you stay we'll put on the day
And we'll wear it 'till the night comes

I woke up, it was a Chelsea morning
And the first thing that I saw
Was the sun through yellow curtains
And a rainbow on my wall
Blue, red, green and gold to welcome you
Crimson crystal beads to beckon

Oh, won't you stay we'll put on the day
There's a sun show every second

Now the curtain opens on a portrait of today
And the streets are paved with passersby
Pigeons fly, and papers lie
Waiting to blow away

I woke up, it was a Chelsea morning
And the first thing that I knew
There was milk and toast and honey
And a bowl of orange juice too
And the light poured in like butterscotch
Stuck to all my senses

Oh, won't you stay we'll put on the day
And we'll talk in present tenses

When the contain closes
And the rainbow runs away
I will bring you incense owls by night
By jewel light, by candlelight, if only you will stay
Oh my darling won't you wake up, it is a Chelsea morning

I was here and you were gone
It seems that was as long as I remember

Judy Collins,"There once was a union maid, she never was afraid
Of goons and ginks and company finks and the deputy sheriffs who made the raid.
She went to the union hall when a meeting it was called,
And when the Legion boys come 'round
She always stood her ground.

Oh, you can't scare me, I'm sticking to the union,
I'm sticking to the union, I'm sticking to the union.
Oh, you can't scare me, I'm sticking to the union,
I'm sticking to the union 'til the day I die.

This union maid was wise to the tricks of company spies,
She couldn't be fooled by a company stool, she'd always organize the guys.
She always got her way when she struck for better pay.
She'd show her card to the National Guard
And this is what she'd say

You gals who want to be free, just take a tip from me;
Get you a man who's a union man and join the ladies' auxiliary.
Married life ain't hard when you got a union card,
A union man has a happy life when he's got a union wife.

Judy Collins,"One morning in Bolivia
The leader of the partisans and two of his companions
Were forced to flee the mountains for their lives
Through green and dusty villages they sped along the little roads
The peasants smiled and shouted as they hurried by
Jesus called out to every one ""Don't think that we are leaving,
They only tried to frighten us with guns, we shall return,""
Continue with your work, continue with your talk
You have it in your hand to own your life to own your land
The people smiled and shouted and they ran along a little while
The stood and watched, their hands were restless and empty
The body of Jesus was in the jeep that they blew up 
Before it reach the plane

The priest was proud to bless him for what there was 
of him remaining in the afternoon

Continue with your work, continue with your talk
You have it in your hands to own your life to own your land
There is no one who can show you the road you should be on
They only tell you they can show you and then tomorrow they are gone

The smell of oil and incense fill the room in this adobe hut
Where on the table lies the body of a man
His face is pale and young, his beard is dark and curled
Pennies hold his eyelids from the evening light
People from the village those who knew him, those who killed him
Stand inside the door, their hands are restless and empty
They watch the priest make silent crosses in the air
And pray to God inside their hearts for their own souls

Continue with your work, continue with your talk

Judy Collins,"The fisherman are pitching pennies
In the sand beside the sea
The sunrise hits their oilskin boots
And their painted boats and me
They seem to know the ocean
Like a man knows a woman
She makes him wait around for half the morning
For the tide to turn

Pull on the ropes, Seine haul fisherman
Never catches more than he knows 
He can sell in a day,
Pull on the ropes, Seine haul fisherman
Day's for work. 
Night's the time to go dancing

They're drinking beer and laughing
And squinting at the sun
Waiting for the gulls to tell them
When the fish will come
Their faces brown and weathered
From all the nets they've run
They've learned to wait
They always know that the tide will turn

Pull on the ropes, Seine haul fisherman
Never catches more than he knows 
He can sell in a day,
Pull on the ropes, Seine haul fisherman

Night's the time to go dancing

Way out on the ocean
The big ships hunt for whales
The Japanese have caught so many
That now they hunt for snails

He seems content to live
With the sun and the sand
And a net full of fish when the tide turns

Judy Collins,"She is a weaver
Through her hands the bright thread travels
Blue green water, willows weeping, silver stars

She sings and sighs as the shuttle flies
Through the yarn like a Kerry dancer
Pink and purple velvet red for a lover's bed

Living north of San Francisco
With a man who built his house alone
Living peaceful in the country
The lights of the golden gate will lead her home

She is a spinner
In her hands the wooden wheel turns the wool around
Then around again

A gypsy from Bolinas
Sits and plays the mandolin
Faces smile in the firelight of a foggy night

Living north of San Francisco
Sometimes it's nice to be alone
She says, it's peaceful where she is living
The lights of the golden gate will lead her home

You can see the bridges of the city
Hanging in the air by steel and stone
She says, it's peaceful where she's living
The lights of the golden gate will lead her home

She is a weaver
Through her hand the bright thread travels
Blue green water, willows weeping, silver stars

She is my sister
The baby born when I was older
Her hands are light, her hair is bright as the summer sun

But it isn't the same
A plain wooden cottage
A patch of brown lawn

A tangle of summer birds 
Flying in sunlight
A forest of lillies
An orchard of apricot trees

I see you shining through the night
In the ice and snow of winter

Great grandfather's farm is still there
But it isn't the same

And the fences are gone

The topsoil away every Spring

Of the people I knew long ago
Inside the old kitchen
They bend and sigh

And the world passed them by

That's me at the graves

Who once looked so grown-up and brave

Thought the eyes of the child that was me
I see willows bending

And the silver blue sailing birds

He moved to Arizona in nineteen sixty-one
Got a job at the Indian school - he was livin' in the sun

I knew that me and Marty, we should have been good friends
I always knew the paths we walked were meant to cross again
We talked on the telephone once or twice a year
His voice was so familiar, his memory was clear

I'll never know what brought him to where he finally stood
A shotgun pointed at his head in a cabin in the woods
But somehow I could hear it, it struck my heart as well
For the unknown man who needs a hand
For the friend I'll never know

Judy Collins,"Riding on the City of New Orleans,
Illinois Central Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders,
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail.
All along the southbound odyssey
The train pulls out at Kankakee
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields.
Passin' trains that have no names,
Freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles.

Good morning America how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.

Dealin' cards with the old men in the club car.
Penny a point ain't no one keepin' score.
Won't you pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor.
And the sons of Pullman porters
And the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpets made of steam.
Mothers with their babes asleep,
Are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they dream.

Good morning America how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.

Nighttime on The City of New Orleans,
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee.
Half way home, we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness
Rolling down to the sea.
And all the towns and people seem
To fade into a bad dream
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news.
The conductor sings his song again,
The passengers will please refrain
This train's got the disappearing railroad blues.

Judy Collins,"I didn't even know the man
I didn't know the man himself
Even though his music filled my life
As it has so many others

I knew that he had died that week
After fighting death a year or more
But I had had a rule before
That funerals were a waste of flowers

But something said I had to go
To be a witness to his gift of love
A man who never once gave up on life
Until death took him in his tracks

The people stood around the church
Ten thousand people there they say, or more
Black and white, rich and poor
Together they were there to say farewell

In New York City it had rained that day
The streets were silver and the sky was gray
But in the church the music soared and sang
And seemed to fill the air with shining sun

The man was a hero
He played the music of our souls
He knew that we all have in us
A place where beauty always grows

Outside in the streets again
The people wandered through the falling rain
They waved their hands and dried their tears
And turned to go about their lives again

But none of us will be the same
If we hear the things his music says
That loving is the gift of life
And making music was his way of love

I've heard it said that time brings relief
But hey just how long will it take
And here I am I feel like a fool
For causing this fool's heart to break

Love hurts when you know that it's gone
Love hurts when when you still love someone
Love hurts when there's nothing to do
but crty all the tears left inside you

How can I see you like seeing a friend 
when each time I see you I break down again

Love hurts when there's nothing to do
but crty all the tears left inside you
Love hurts when you know that it's gone
Love hurts when when you still love someone
Love hurts when there's nothing to do
but crty all the tears left inside you

Judy Collins,"It seems I've always been in charge before
I made the rules and they were followed
The men I loved would gather at my door
To wait the word for the day

I must admit I had my moments
When I wished the world would suddenly go mad
But then I'd come back to my senses
And think how sweet was that freedom I thought I had

Out of control you send me
I never know where it will end for me
You put the lights in my head, a song in my bed

Oh, nothing I say can change you
You know your way, life is clear to you
All I can do when you call me is follow
Oh, I am a woman as sensible as can be

Out of control, you spin me
Take me again, your love is winning me
I'd follow you anywhere you say
I fell in love with you today

",Out of Control,1976
Judy Collins,"The Diamond is a ship my boys, for Greenland she is bound
And the quay it is all garnished with bonny lassies 'round
The Captain gives the order to sail the ocean wide
Where the sun it never sets my lads no darkness dims the tide

[Chorus]
So cheer up my lads let your hearts never fail
While the Bonnie Ship the Diamond goes fishin' for the whale

Along the quay at Peterhead, the lassies stand around
With their shawls about their heads and salt tears runnin' down
I'll never weep my bonny lad though I'm left behind
For there's not a rose on Greenland's ice to make you change your mind

[Chorus]

Here's a health to the Resolution likewise the Eliza Swan
A health to the Battler of Montrose and the Diamond ship of fame
They wear the trousers of the white the jackets of the blue
When they return to Peterhead they'll find that we've been true

[Chorus]

It'll be bright both day and night when the Greenland lads come home
With a ship that's full of oil my lads and money to their name
They'll make the cradles for to rock and the blankets for to tear
And every lass in Peterhead sing hush-a-bye my dear

What will your mother think but I hear the guineas clink?
And the soldiers marchin' behind you O

Judy Collins,"Travelin' down that coaltown road,
Listen to those rubber tires whine;
Goodbye to Buckeye and White Sycamore
I'm leavin' you behind.
I've been a coal man all my life 
Layin' down track in the hole,
Got a back like an ironwood bent by the wind 
Blood veins blue as the coal. 

Somebody said ""That's a strange tattoo 
You have on the side of your head.""
I said ""That's a blue print, left by the coal 
Just a little more and I'd be dead""
And I love the rumble and I love the dark 
I love the cool of the slate.
But it's on down the new road lookin' for a job 
It's the travelin' and lookin' I hate. 

I've stood for the union, walkin' the line,
Fought against the company;
Stood for the U. M. W. of A.
Now who's gonna stand for me?
I got no house and I got no pay,
Just got a worried soul;
And this blue tattoo on the side of my head 
Left by the number nine coal. 

Someday when I'm dead and gone 
To Heaven, the land of my dreams,
I won't have to worry on losin' my job 
To bad times 'n big machines.
I ain't gonna pay my money away 
For pensions and hospital plans.
I'm gonna pick coal where the blue heavens roll 
And sing with the angel bands.",Coal Tattoo,1977
Judy Collins,"I went out to the hazelwood
Because a fire was in my head
Cut and peeled a hazel wand
And hooked a berry to a thread

And when white moths were on the wing
And moth-like stars were flickering out
I dropped the berry in a stream
And caught a little silver trout

When I had laid it on the ground
And gone to blow the fire aflame
Something rustled on the floor
And someone called me by my name

It had become a glimmering girl
With apple blossom in her hair
Who called me by my name and ran
And vanished in the brightening air

Though I am old with wandering
Through hollow lands and hilly lands
I will find out where she has gone
And see her lips and take her hand

And walk through long green dappled grass
And pluck till time and times are done
The silver apples of the moon
The golden apples of the sun",Golden Apples of the Sun,1977
Judy Collins,"You have many houses, one for every season
Mountains in your windows, violets in your hands
Through your English meadows your blue-eyed horses wander
You're in Colorado for the Spring

When the Winter finds you, you fly to where it's summer
Rooms that face the ocean, moonlight on your bed
Mermaids swift as dolphins paint the air with diamonds
You are like a seagull as you said

Why do you fly bright feathered sometimes in my dreams?
The shadows of your wings fall over my face
I can feel no air, I can find no peace
Brides in black ribbons, witches in white
Fly in through windows, fly out through the night

Why do I think I'm dying sometimes in my dreams
I see myself a child running through the trees
Searching for myself, looking for my life
Looking everywhere crawling on my knees
I cannot see the leaves, I cannot see the light

Then I see you walking just beyond the forest
Walking very quickly, walking by yourself
Your shoes are silver, your coat is made of velvet
Your eyes are shining, your voice is sweet and clear
""Come on"" you say ""come with me, I'm going to the castle""

All the bells are ringing, the weddings have begun
But I can only stand here-I cannot move to follow
I'm burning in the shadows and freezing in the sun

There are people with you living in your houses
People from your childhood who remember how you were
You were always flying, nightingale of sorry
Singing bird with rainbows on your wings",Houses,1977
Judy Collins,"Down in some lone valley in a lonesome place
Where the wild birds all whistle and their notes do increase
Farewell Pretty Saro I must bid you adieu
And I'll dream of Pretty Saro wherever I go

My love she won't have me and I understand
She wants a rich merchant and I have no land
I cannot maintain her, I've no silver and gold
Can't give her the nice things that a big house will hold

But if I were a merchant and I could write a fine hand
And I'd write my love a letter that she'd understand
I'd write it by the river where the waters o'erflow
And I'll dream of Pretty Saro wherever I go",Pretty Saro,1977
Judy Collins,"Seems it was just a while ago
All of my friends and I
Went to each others weddings
And stood by each others side
And became brides

He said that he and Liz were through
And by the way that
Things have been going
You could that they were overdue

For every other married pair of us
That already split in two
Each of us turning our own lives alone
For sleeping with someone new

Nightingale, Blackbird
How is it you sing?

How can you jubilate
Sitting in cages
Never taking wing?

Outside the sky waits
Beckoning, beckoning
Just beyond the bars

How can you remain
Staring at the rain
Maddened by the stars?

How is it you sing anything?
How is it you sing?

Green Finch and Linnet bird
Nightingale, Blackbird
How is it you sing?

Whence comes this melody
Constantly floating?
Is it rejoicing or merely a loaming?

Are you discussing?
Or fussing
Or simply dreaming?

Are you crowing?
Are you screaming?
Ring dove and Robinet

Is it for wages?
Singing to be sold?
Have you decided it's safer in cages
Singing when you're told?

My cage has many rooms
Damask and dark
Nothing there sings
Not even my Lark

Larks never will, you know
When they're captive
Teach me to be more adaptive

Off Lake Michigan.
I'm going where the weather is warm and the heat off.

You burned me out and you did me in,
You beat me at the game 
I can not win.

I'm going where the pace is slower,

Waving his lights at my train.
Red fir stopping my heart from beating,
Green for driving me insane.
And the rain is pouring,
And the wheels are rolling past that Nevada line
I'm going where the weather is hot,
And you are not.

I played the fool I believed your lies,
I danced till I was nearly paralyzed
I'm gone and going.

Shining its light on my train
Drying my tears soothing my fears,
Taking away my old pain.

I wanted just a little peace of mind.

One day I just know I woke up free.

I couldn't tell you why,
First I laughed and then I learned to cry.
Somethin' in my heart was sayin' you can reach the sky,
You just gotta live until you die.

Judy Collins,"Midnight
Not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone
In the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan 

Memory
All alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days
I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again 

Every streetlamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters
And the streetlamp gutters
And soon it will be morning 

Daylight
I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in
When the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin 

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The streetlamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning 

Touch me
It's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun
If you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is 

Look
A new day has begun",Memory,1982
Judy Collins,"Every mother has to let he child go
Even though it may tear her apart
I can hear the lullabies I sang you

One word from you can melt the winter snow
Make me forget the longest mile

That life could be so fine

Right there on the T.V.

I wish I had a real gun
Then I would never be afraid

I'd never use my gun on you
You'd never have to worry
You'd be the good guy on my side
Just like on the T.V.

I think when I grow up someday 
I'm gonna join the NRA 
I saw them telling what they're for
Last night on the T.V.

We've got to play to win it
He says I'll have to learn to fight

Still at times I find myself
Wishing they were right
If everybody loves me
Where are they tonight?

Everybody loves to love

Out there on the stage tonight
The girl who's got it made

But after the applause is gone
I sometimes wish I knew
Why everybody loves me
And I love only you

Haven't I got all the things success alone can give?
Wouldn't everybody love to lead the life I live?
All I need is someone I can share it with

But how they love to love
The golden girl next door
Up there with her name in lights
Now who could ask for more?

Still I can't help wondering
Why it should be true
That everybody loves me
Everyone but you

When the world leaves you shivering
And the blizzard blows,
When the snow flies and the night falls
There's a light in the window and a place called home
At the end of the storm. 

One night on the mountain I was headed for Estes
When the roads turned to ice and it started to snow,
Put on the chains in a whirl of white powder,
Half way up to Berthoud near a diner I know

And the light burned inside, shining down through the snowfall
God it was cold and the temperature droppin',
Went in for coffee and shivered as I drank it,
Warm in my hands in the steam as it rose.

Sitting there at the counter was a dark headed stranger,
Me and the owner and him keepin warm,
Nodded hello and I said it's a cold one
Looks like there might be a blizzard tonight -

And ""yes"", said the owner,""
There's a big storm on the mountain,
Good thing we're open, we could be here for hours
There's nothing for miles and it's too late to get to Denver,
Better not try for the summit tonight"".

And the snow fell 
And the night passed
And I talked to the strangers 
While the blizzard blew.

Me and the stranger, you know I don't talk to strangers,
I'm a private sort of person but a blizzard is a blizzard,
And somehow I found myself saying you'd left me,
Tellin' him everything I wanted to say to you.

You know how it is when you can talk to a stranger,
Someone your quite sure you'll never see again -
Soon we were laughin', and talkin', and drinkin'
He said ""you must know you're too good for him"". 

And the snow fell 
And the night passed
And I talked to the stranger 
While the blizzard blew.

The stranger said ""Love it can cry you a river -
Me, I'm a loner cause I can't take the heartache
And sometimes I'm a fighter when I get too much whiskey -
Here have a little whiskey, pretend you don't give a damn -

My cabin's up here on the side of the mountain
You can go up there and sleep through the blizzard"".
I put on my parka, said goodbye to the owner
Followed the stranger through the snow up the mountainside. 

Woke in the morning to the sun on the snow,
My car was buried in six feet of snow drifts,
They dug me out, just the owner and the stranger,
Sent me on my way when the snowplow had been by 

And the roads were all clear and the sun on the mountains
Sparkled like diamonds on the peak to peak highway -
Then I knew that I would get over you, knew you could leave me 
But you'd never break me.

Judy Collins,"My child arrived just the other day,
He came to the world in the usual way.
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay.
He learned to walk while I was away. 
And he was talking 'fore I knew it, and as he grew,
He'd say, ""I'm gonna be like you, dad.
You know I'm gonna be like you.""

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,
Little boy blue and the man in the moon.
""When you coming home?""
""I don't know when,
We'll get together then, son.
You know we'll have a good time then.""

My child turned ten the other day.
He said, ""Thanks for the ball, dad come on let's play.
Can you teach me to throw?"" I said, ""Not today,
I've got a lot to do."" He said, ""That's ok.""
He turned away, but his smile never dimmed,
""I'm gonna be like him,"" he said.
Yes, I'm gonna be like him.""

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,
Little boy blue and the man in the moon. 
""When you coming home?""
""I don't know when,
We'll get together then, son.
You know we'll have a good time then.""

Well, he came from college the other day,
So much like a man I just had to say,
""I'm proud of you, son. Will you sit for a while?""
He shook his head and he said with a smile,
""What I'd really like to do is borrow the car keys.
I'll see you later. Can I have them please?""

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,
Little boy blue and the man in the moon.
""When you coming home?""
""I don't know when,
We'll get together then, son.
You know we'll have a good time then.""

Well, I've long since retired and my child moved away.
I called him up just the other day.
I said, ""I'd like to see you if you don't mind.""
He said, ""I'd love to, dad, if I could find the time.""
He said, ""My new job's a hassle, and the kids got the flu,
But it's so nice talking to you, dad.
It's so nice talking to you.""

And as I hung up the phone, 
It occurred to me,
My boy's a lot like me.
My boy's a lot like me.

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,
Little boy blue and the man in the moon.

Judy Collins,"From a distance the world looks blue and green
And the snow capped mountains white
From a distance the ocean meets the stream
And the eagle takes to flight

From a distance, there is harmony
And it echoes through the land
It's the voice of hope, it's the voice of peace
It's the voice of every man

From a distance we all have enough
And no one is in need
There are no guns, no bombs, no diseases
No hungry mouths to feed

From a distance we are instruments
Marching in a common band
Playing songs of hope, playing songs of peace
They're the songs of every man

God is watching us
God is watching us
God is watching us from a distance

From a distance you look like my friend
Even though we are at war
From a distance I can't comprehend
What all this war is for

From a distance there is harmony
And it echoes through the land
It's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves
It's the heart of every man

It's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves
It's the song of every man
It's the song of everyone

A bright star was shining down 
Upon the little town of Bethlehem 
The shepherds in their fields
Were amazed at the sound
Of angels singing in Jerusalem 

The wise men made their way 
Every traveling night and day 
With myrrh and frankincense and gifts of gold 
While Mary, meek and mild 
Labored with her first born child 
And Joseph sheltered with her from the cold 

The angels and the animals 
Were kneeling to His glory 
To praise the Son of God 
Come once upon a time 
The promised Prince of Peace 
The babe in swaddling clothes 
In his mothers arms did sleep 
Embraced within a lullaby of light 
The angels sang on high 
The song of heaven bright 
Redemption came upon that blessed night 

The trembling voice of shepherd 
The harp that played a melody 
And Joseph knew among the straw 
The glory of divinity 
The promised prince of peace 
So let us sing his praise 
The baby King of light 
And make a place within our manger stall 
His promise is renewed 
Upon this Christmas night For you, for me, for shepherd King and all 

The glory of this humble verse 
Relieves us of our poverty 
And we are rich in blessing 
For He was born for you and me 
The promised Prince of Peace",All on a Wintry Night,1994

The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head
The stars in the sky looked down where He lay

The cattle are lowing, the baby wakes
But little Lord Jesus, no crying He makes
I love Thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky
And stay by my cradle 'til morning is neigh

Be near me, Lord Jesus, I asked Thee to stay
Close by me forever and love me, I pray
And bless all the dear children in Thy tender care
And feed us for Heaven to live with Thee there

There appeared a heavenly light
To guide the wise men to the King of hope

In a stable low while the cattle moaned
And the angels stood their guard

And the Prince of pride

Rich and poor
Rejoice in gladness on

Bending his knees to the King
In the heavenly light while sweet Mary smiled

Goes to sleep on the frozen gravel
and holds an empty hand
Lift your eyes to the hopeless face
That greets you on your way
Give the tender gift of hope
Make Christmas every day.

On the feast of Stephen
When the snow lay 'round about
Deep and crisp and even

Brightly shone the moon that night
Though the frost was cruel
When a poor man came in sight
Gathering winter fuel

Hither, page and stand by me
If thou knows it telling
Yonder peasant, who is he?
Where and what his dwelling?

Sire, he lives a good league hence
Underneath the mountain
Right against the forest fence
By Saint Agnes's fountain

Bring me flesh and bring me wine
Bring me fur logs, hither
Thou and I will see him dine
Here we bear him thither

Page and monarch, forth they went
Forth they went together
Through the rude wind's wild lament
And the bitter weather

Sire, the night is darker now
And the wind blows stronger
Fails my heart, I know not how
I can go no longer

Mark my footsteps, good my page
Tread thou in them boldly
Thou shall find the winter's rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly

In his master's steps he trod
Where the snow lay dinted
Heat was in the very sod
Which the Saint had printed

Therefore, Christian men, be sure
Wealth or rank possessing
Ye, who now will bless the poor
Shall yourselves find blessing

I reach out my hand touching death itself
just another holy day in Sarajevo

Hiding from the planes and from the bombing
Fire in the sky burning down my life
There is no more love no more longing

I dream of Peace
I dream of flowers on the hill
I dream I see my mother smiling
When I close my eyes I dream of Peace

Then the fire came falling from the sky
There is no one left who can protect me

Can't we live in a peace stop the flowing blood
Make a blessed world where I can be a child.

Do you dream of Peace?
Do you dream of flowers on the hill?
Do you dream you see your mother smiling?
When you close your eyes do you dream of Peace?

Courage you have shown to the watching world
We have prayed and wept for Sarajevo

Children dance again in Sarajevo 
Now the sun can shine 
Now the birds can sing

You stole my heart away
I'm writing you to say that
You were my original hero

My fabulous prince and my lover
You had the right answer to the riddle
But the years went by
And finally I left you for another
Saying this is love

I'm sorry for the pain I caused you
I was a crazy girl in those days
But I have been burned
And, darling, I've learned
That lovin' and leavin' don't pay

You were just the first of many men
I thought you would set me free
I took what I could
Made you a promise
That you wouldn't bind me

Then I would see a new smile
See the future bright and shining
I turned and tossed
In a sea so deep no one could find me
Saying this must be love

I'm sorry for the pain I caused you
I was a crazy girl in those days
And I have been burned
And, darling, I've learned
That lovin' and leavin' don't pay

Finally a man came along
I gave him all I had
I would have gone
To the end of the Earth for him
If he'd asked me

He only turned on his heel
And walked back the way he came
All all of my tears
And the pieces of my heart
Couldn't turn him around

Maybe I've paid the price
For breaking all those hearts
Maybe my dice will come up this time
With a lover that's really mine

So can you say you forgive
The girl you used to love
I've played the stakes high
And I've paid for my crimes
In the name of love

I'm sorry for the pain I caused you
I was a crazy girl in those days
But I have been burned
And, darling, I've learned
That lovin' and leavin' don't pay

There were some things I hadn't known
Stripped to the soul I'd reached the bone
In sanity and grace

You gave me wings but took the sky
I am caught in a world that's flying by
Right on course headed to the dawn
Where my heart has gone

I had a dream that we were free
Free to sail on just you and me
Far from the force of gravity
Flung to the brightest star
There is a dream beyond my dream
Wearing a face I'd seldom seen
I caught a glimpse within your eyes
I saw the shadow rise

Through stars and stones

Already

Laugh at the night and rue the day
Born on the wings of a night that burns
Loving to be unlearned

Better than nothing half a heart
Better to go than not to start
Who can I ask? Who knows the part
Of sanity and grace

It could have been a fantasy
Was I in truth already free
Could I pretend I did not see
Say there was not a trace
Where would I hide the truth of you
What would I do that I could do
Gone are the things I thought I knew

Lily of the Valley

They called her Lily of the Valley
And she lived beside the river
The youngest of her sisters
And the prettiest of them all
She was courted by the men in town
She could have married anyone
The one she made her husband
Was the handsomest of all.

They were married in a chapel
Lily bore him seven children
And every night he put her down
And made her feel ashamed. 

He took the face she used to wear
And put a look of sorrow there
The more he made her suffer
The more she felt to blame

No more tears Lily
Don't cry anymore
Tears of yours won't fall another time.
Don't cry Lilly 
We know how you've tried
Fighting for your life was not a crime.

One night Lily turned to him
Before he raised his hand to her
One more time she said, and not again
He laughed and threw another punch
The blow knocked Lily to the floor,
Somehow she grabbed the kitchen knife
And stabbed her husband dead. 

The jury they decided it was murder in the first degree
They said she had provoked him
With her wild and wicked talk.
They hanged her by the river
Where so many times she wandered
And left her children motherless
In sorrow and in shock.

No more tears Lily
Don't cry anymore
Tears of yours won't fall another time.
Don't cry Lilly
We know how you've tried
Fighting for your life was not a crime.

A soldier in a uniform is meant to kill the enemy
But Lilly in her own defense was framed to take the fall
Her children watched their father beat their mother all too often
The battlefields of families are the saddest of them all. 

The willow weeps for Lily
As its branches touch the water
The wind is crying, ""Lily"" 
As it sighs along the shore
The river's singing ""Lily --
We all know that you are innocent""
You were promised marriage
But you had to fight a war.

No more tears Lily
Don't cry any more
Tears of yours won't fall another time.
Don't cry Lily
We know how you tried
Fighting for your life was not a crime.

Standing together by the sea

I don't remember the words
That you said to me
I don't remember the words
But the melody 
Haunts me

I found a rose that you gave to me
Pressed in a book of your poetry
Deathless prose like the love I thought that we shared
You left my life with no backward look

You can hear your name
Sand slides through the stranger's hand
As he deals the game.

No more cradles and no more snow
Bet your life on a lucky roll
Play your queen, you could win your soul,
Stakes are high you can live or die
To risk everything.

In your goblet the wine is black
As a moonless night
Wet your lips before you kiss
The blazing light
Bets are off but the game is on,
Drop the armor you counted on
All your armies are fled and gone
Win your king, you can play your pawn
Take your time, you have just begun
To risk everything.

Catch your tears in a golden sieve
Don't regret what you did to live
Don't forget that you must forgive
To risk everything.

Through the window you see the storm
That is gathering,
Painted gypsies on dappled horses are galloping
Through the trees in the howling wind
Down the hills to the river bend
Shadow ghosts that are blind as night
Shrieking curses against the night,
Daring you to come join their flight
And risk everything.

Catch your tears in a golden sieve
Don't regret what you did to live
Don't forget that you must forgive
To risk everything.

There is nothing to hold you now
To your fault or mine
Fallen idols and martyred souls
Are the only kind
Feet of clay in the emerald skies
Birds of prey when the dreamer dies
Perfect crosses perfect your lies
Burning saints in the flaming skies
Bet your life every promise dies
All that's left for you to try
Is risking everything.

Catch your tears in a golden sieve
Don't regret what you did to live
Don't forget that you must forgive
To risk everything.

Oh, Oh

Catch your tears in a golden sieve
Don't regret what you did to live
Don't forget that you must forgive.
To risk everything.

Time slips by in the hourglass
You can hear your name
Sand slides through the stranger's hand
As he deals the game.
All the candles are burning low
No more cradles and no more snow
Bet your life on a lucky roll
Play your queen, you could win your soul,
Stakes are high you can live or die
To risk everything.

Catch your tears in a golden sieve
Don't regret what you did to live
Don't forget that you must forgive
To risk everything.",Risk,1995

Judy Collins,"A dream came to me at night
When the boats were in the sea
A dream of the black death of earth
Two voices came singing to me.

Wind, water, fire, and stone.
Storms of sand, closing over the sun
Sand, fire, water, and wind
How can we begin again.

But you can't sink a rainbow
In a world that is green
You can't make the night any brighter
By even one star.

Awake, awake, awake.

Oh the rivers are poisoned
And the lakes are gone
The dolphins are dying
And the whales have lost their song.

But you can't sink a rainbow
In a world that is green
You can't make the night any brighter
By even one star.

Awake, awake, awake.

Once I saw a man 
Who said he'd seen a flock of nightengales
Once a child recalled the sound of rain
Like silver angel's wings.

Like a lost and homeless thing 
The planet spins her way through space.
Drugged and battered like a woman
Who can't recall her face.

Remembering the way she used to shine
Rivers in the sea
Shine, herons on the wing, 
And hear the crickets sing
A million forest birds 
The sea her mantle green 
Like a banner of bright hair 
Around her shoulders

But you can't sink a rainbow
In a world that is green
You can't make the world any brighter
By even one star. 

Awake, awake, awake.

Wind, water, fire, and stone.
Storms of sand, closing over the sun
Sand, fire, water, and wind
How can we begin again.

But you can't sink a rainbow
In a world that is green
You can't make the night any brighter
By even one star.

Awake, awake, awake.

When the boats were in the sea
A dream of the bright death of earth.","Wind, Water, Fire and Stone",1995
Judy Collins,"Once upon a time in another world 
On a hill that overlooked the sea
There was once a garden of beauty and of grace
Lovely as a dream could ever be.

Then the roses bled and the lilies broke
On the day that death came to the garden
Hidden in the flowers, meant to break the heart
Flames that burst like blossoms in the garden.

Can't you hear the voices from across the sea
Calling from the ruins of the garden
Calling out to you, calling out to me,
Save us from the darkness that has fallen
On our lovely garden 

Name them all by heart, name them one by one
Countries where a child has lost tomorrow
Count the deadly flowers in the fields and woods
Count them like a rosary of sorrow.

Can't you hear the voices from across the sea
Calling from the ruins of the garden
Calling out to you, calling out to me,
Save us from the darkness that has fallen
On our lovely garden. 

Where the children played in the summer light
Running through the flowers on the hill
Laughter in their voices, hope within their hearts
Knowing they would live forever more.

I have seen a child barely five or six,
Counting bombs and tears, his childhood broken,
Give him back the garden, give him back his life
Give him back a world where love is spoken.

Let us join our voices far across the sea
Singing all together of the garden,
Let the roses bloom, let the lillies grow,
Let us live together for the children,
In our lovely garden.",Voices,1995
Judy Collins,"She is a weaver
Through her hands the bright thread travels
Blue green water, willows weeping, silver stars
She sings and sighs as the shuttle flies
Through the yarn like a Kerry dancer

Living north of San Francisco
With a man who build his house alone
Living peaceful in the country
The lights of the Golden Gate will lead her home

She is a spinner
In her hands the wooden wheel turns the wool around
The around again
The gypsy from Bolinas sits and plays the mandolin
Faces smile in the firelight of a foggy night

Living north of San Francisco
Sometimes it's nice to be alone
She says it's peaceful where she is living
The lights of the Golden Gate will lead her home

You can see the bridges of the city
Hanging in the air by steel and stone
She says it's peaceful where she's living
The lights of the Golden Gate will lead her home

Judy Collins,"Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there.

The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads.
And mama in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap.

When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.

The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow
Gave the luster of mid-day to objects below.
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tinny reindeer.

With a little old driver, so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be St Nick.
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name!

""Now Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen!
On, Comet! On, Cupid! on, on Donner and Blitzen!
To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!""

As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky.
So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,
With the sleigh full of Toys, and St Nicholas too.

And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St Nicholas came with a bound.

He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.
A bundle of Toys he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a peddler, just opening his pack.

His eyes-how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.

The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.
He had a broad face and a little round belly,
That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly!

He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself!
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.

He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk.
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose!

He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
But I heard him exclaim, 'ere he drove out of sight,
""Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!""",The Night Before Christmas,1997
Judy Collins,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Can hurt you somehow

Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy
She'll beat you if she's able
You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet

Now it seems to me, some fine things
Have been laid upon your table
But you only want the ones that you can't get

Desperado, oh, you ain't gettin' no younger
Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home
And freedom, oh freedom well, that's just some people talkin'
Your prison is walking through this world all alone

Don't your feet get cold in the winter time?
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night time from the day
You're losin' all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feeling goes away?

It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you
You better let somebody love you, before it's too late",Desperado,1997

When winter draws the valley down
And stills the rivers in their storm
And freezes all the little brooks
Time when our steps slow to the song
Of falling flakes and crackling flames 
When silver stars are high and still
Deep in the velvet of the night sky

The crystal time the silence times
I'll learn to love their quietness
While deep beneath the glistening snow
The black earth dreams of violets
I'll learn to love the fallow way

I'll learn to love the fallow way
When all my colors fade to white
And flying birds fold back their wings
Upon my anxious wondering's
The sun has slanted all her rays
Across the vast and harvest plains
My memories mingle in the dawn
I dream a joyful vagabonds

The crystal times the silence times
I'll learn to love their quietness 
When deep beneath the glistening snow
The black earth dreams in of violets
I'll learn to love the fallow times

No drummer comes across the plains
To tell of triumph or of pain
No word far off battle's cry
To draw me out or draw me nigh
I'll learn to love the fallow way

I'll learn to love the fallow way
And gather in the patient fruits 
And after autumns blaze and burn
I'll know the full still, deep roots
That nothing seem to know or need

That crack the ice in frozen ponds 
And slumbering in winter's folds 
Have dreams of green and blue and gold 
I'll learn to love the fallow way 
And listening for blossoming 
Of my own heart once more in spring

As sure as moonlight, wind and stars

The sun will bring an April day
And I will yield to Summer's way",The Fallow Way,1997

Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A world war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain

You fasten all the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you set back and watch
When the death count gets higher
You hide in your mansion'
As young people's blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud


You've thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world

Unborn and unnamed
You ain't worth the blood
That runs in your veins

How much do I know
To talk out of turn
You might say that I'm young
You might say I'm unlearned
But there's one thing I know
Though I'm younger than you
That even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do

Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could
I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul

And I hope that you die
And your death'll come soon
I will follow your casket
In the pale afternoon
And I'll watch while you're lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I'll stand over your grave
'Til I'm sure that you're dead",Masters of War,1997
Judy Collins,"Nothing lasts forever, you should know that by now

Tears can't stop you
Hidden in your heart is everything you can be
You'll be fine

Nothing lasts forever

You know where you're goin' even when you are lost

Judy Collins,"You people can watch while I'm scrubbing these floors
And I'm scrubbin' the floors while you're gawking
Maybe once ya tip me and it makes ya feel swell
In this crummy southern town
In this crummy old hotel
But you'll never guess to who you're talkin'.
No. you couldn't ever guess to who you're talkin'.

Then one night there's a scream in the night
And you'll wonder who could that have been
And you see me kinda grinnin' while I'm scrubbin'
And you say, ""what's she got to grin?""
I'll tell you.

There's a ship
The black freighter
With a skull on its masthead
Will be coming in

You gentlemen can say, ""hey gal, finish them floors!
Get upstairs! what's wrong with you! earn your keep here!
You toss me your tips
And look out to the ships
But I'm counting your heads
As I'm making the beds
Cause there's nobody gonna sleep here, honey
Nobody
Nobody!

Then one night there's a scream in the night
And you say, ""who's that kicking up a row?""
And ya see me kinda starin' out the winda
And you say, ""what's she got to stare at now?""
I'll tell ya.

There's a ship
The black freighter
Turns around in the harbor
Shootin' guns from her bow

Now
You gentlemen can wipe off that smile off your face
Cause every building in town is a flat one
This whole frickin' place will be down to the ground
Only this cheap hotel standing up safe and sound
And you yell, ""why do they spare that one?""
Yes.
That's what you say.
""Why do they spare that one?""

All the night through, through the noise and to-do
You wonder who is that person that lives up there?
And you see me stepping out in the morning
Looking nice with a ribbon in my hair

And the ship
The black freighter
Runs a flag up its masthead
And a cheer rings the air

By noontime the dock
Is a-swarmin' with men
Comin' out from the ghostly freighter
They move in the shadows
Where no one can see
And they're chainin' up people
And they're bringin' em to me
Askin' me,
""Kill them now, or later?""
Askin' me!
""Kill them now, or later?""

Noon by the clock
And so still by the dock
You can hear a foghorn miles away
And in that quiet of death
I'll say, ""right now.
Right now!""

Then they'll pile up the bodies
And I'll say,
""That'll learn ya!""

And the ship

Disappears out to sea
And

Make it soft and narrow.
For my true love has died today.

I've looked at clouds from both sides now

And I'll be in Scotland afore ye.

Like the first dew fall, on the first grass
Praise for the sweetness of the wet garden
Sprung in completeness where his feet pass

Nor earth sustain
Heaven and earth shall flee away
When He comes to reign

Angels and archangels
May have gathered there
Cherubim and seraphim
Thronged the air

But only His mother
In her maiden bliss
Worshiped the beloved
With a kiss

What can I give Him
Poor as I am?
If I were a shepherd
I would bring a lamb

If I were a wise man
I would do my part
Yet, what can I give Him?
Give my heart

For earth stood hard as iron

One who can't move,
Where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns?

Finally knowing the one that I wanted was yours
Making my entrance again with my usual flair
Sure of my lines
No one is there

I thought that you'd want what I want
Sorry, my dear!
But where are the clowns

All the bird are leaving,
Ah, how can they know it's time to go?
Before the winter fire,
We'll still be dreaming.

Sad deserted shore,
Your fickle friends are leaving,
Ah, but then you know it's time for them to go,
But I will still be here,
I have no thought of leaving.

Who knows where the time goes?

And I'm not alone,
When my love is near me,
And I know,it will be so,till it's time to go,

And then the birds of spring again.

Judy Collins,"It was seven months since 9/11
And the work was almost done
It was seven months since 9/11
And the work had just begun
Ground Zero lit the evening sky
Like a beacon through the heart
The searchlights drove through Heaven's doors
And blew them far apart
A few miles north on the Hudson River
We had gathered for a sort of wake
Nobody felt like celebrating
But the Firemen needed some kind of break
They'd been to so many funerals
And seen so many God-awful sights
They'd been to Ground Zero from dawn to dusk
And round the clock some nights

To Kingdom come, to hell and gone
To somewhere far away
Where murder doesn't break the heart
On a sunny day

I was all dressed up like the rest of the crowd
At the Roxy Club that night
The men and women in Uniform
Tried hard to keep it light
Kevin Bacon played and sang
And folks began to smile
Chris Bodi played his silver horn
With rhythm and with style
I sang my song Amazing Grace
And people laughed and cried
Ronan Tynan sang Danny Boy and
Not an eye was dry
Steve Buscemi spoke of life
At Engine 55,
Of how these heroes
Stayed the course and
Saved so many lives

To Kingdom come, to hell and gone
To somewhere far away
Where murder doesn't break the heart
On a sunny day

A burly man with a handsome face
Stuck out his hand and smiled
Say, meet my wife, we like your songs
We've been with you mile for mile
Though he had a rugged face
I knew I saw the hurt
Then he pointed to a spot above the collar of his shirt.
Just look here on the back of my neck,
There's a tattoo, can you see?
Just right here, I got up close
And saw the number 343,
The number of the Firemen
Who were lost upon that day
The numbers of those heroes,
Ground Zero was their grave

To Kingdom come, to hell and gone
To somewhere far away
Where murder doesn't break the heart
On a sunny day

Those firemen loaded up with gear
Climbed to their death's that day
Along with all the other hundreds
Blasted on their way
Police and EMS and those
On whom death took its toll
And more whose dreams will never dawn,
More than three thousand souls
I left the party after that
I could not stay my tears,
For all our gifts for all our hopes
For all our nameless fears
For all our heroes, men and women
Lost on that black day
Those firemen with courage
In their hearts so strong and brave,
Who made sure in their final hours
There were 30,000 saved.

They've gone to where there are no tears
And every heart is gay,
And they won't be forgotten on a sunny day

To Kingdom come, to hell and gone
To somewhere far away
Where murder doesn't break the heart
On a sunny day

Where murder doesn't break the heart

Listen to the way that the bass part lays,
Down in the middle of the tune and the rhythm so strong.
Boom be' boom goes the big bass drum,
Piano man's going to take his turn,
Look out, baby! The Singer's going to sing his song.

He says, ""Come on, baby, won't you dance with me,

This song don't mean a thing,
But it sure is fun to sing,
It's a silly little diddle,
I was hoping it would make you smile.
Ain't got a lot to say,
But it's kinda fun to play, 
If it gets you dancing, well the diddle
It'll be worthwhile.

On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

So sweet, cool and so fair

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

I'd catch the next bus and be there in a few days
But I just can't do it, I was raised on the road
I've got no place to go to, so l guess I'll stay on

There's dreams that I've had, I wrote in songs yesterday
But the waves of the world have washed them away
Still I carry them with me wherever I go
They're my only possessions on this slow boat back home

I've kept all my memories buried deep in my heart
Where time cannot touch them and rip them apart
Still I look for the hour when I will be free
From constantly dying and living on dreams

If I could go back home to the place I was raised

They're my only possessions on this slow boat back home
",Slow Boat,2003
Judy Collins,"I went down to the place
Where I knew, she lay waiting
Under the marble and the snow

I said, ""Mother I'm frightened
The thunder and the lightning
I'll never come through this alone""

She said, “I'll be with you
My shawl wrapped around you
My hand on your head when you go”

And the night came on, it was very calm
I wanted the night to go on and on
But she said, “Go back, go back to the world”

We were fighting in Egypt
When they signed this agreement
That nobody else had to die

There was this terrible sound
And my father went down
With a terrible wound in his side

He said, “Try to go on
Take my books, take my gun
And remember, my son, how they lied”

And the night comes on and it's very calm
I'd like to pretend that my father was wrong
But you don't want to lie, not to the young

We were locked in this kitchen
I took to religion
And wondered how long she would stay

I needed so much
To have nothing to touch
I've always been greedy that way

But my son and my daughter
Climbed out of the water
Cryin' papa, you promised to play

And they lead me away to the great surprise
It's papa, don't peek, papa, cover your eyes
And they hide, they hide in the World

Now I look for her always
I'm lost in this calling
I'm tied to the threads of some prayer

Saying, “When will she summon me?
When will she come to me?
What must I do to prepare?”

Then she bends to my longing
Like a willow, like a fountain
She stands in the luminous air

And the night comes on and it's very calm
I lie in her arms and says, “When I'm gone
I'll be yours, yours for a song”

Now the crickets are singing
The vesper bells ringing
The cat's curled asleep in his chair

I'll go down to Bill's Bar
I can make it that far
And I'll see if my friends are still there

And yes, here's to the few
Who forgive what you do
And the fewer who don't even care

And the night comes on and it's very calm
I want to cross over, I want to go home
And she says, “Go back, go back to the world”

We'll be loving once again
Sometime down the road

Take my hand across, across the sea
And fly with me
To a place where hearts transcend
And time is standing still
Travel through the shining stars

Beyond out galaxy
What a thrill if we will
Keep trusting our destiny

Sometime down the road
Maybe when we're grey and old
We'll be together
Just when nobody knows
Cause at our journey's end
Where the river bends
I'll be waiting there my friend
We'll be loving once again
Sometime down the road

When our souls have crossed the ocean
We'll meet again
When the troubled water calms
And the clouds have all gone by
We will stand together
On a shore of peace my friend
You and I through the sky
We'll be carried beyond the wind 

Sometime down the road
Maybe when we're grey and old
We'll be together
Just when nobody knows

Doubts and loneliness
Lift my spirits to thoughts much higher
Of dreams we still have left

Judy Collins,"Well I met you on a midway at a fair last year
And you stood out like a ruby in a black man's ear
You were playing on the horses, you were playing on the guitar strings
You were playing like a devil wearing wings

Wearing wings you looked so grand, wearing wings
Do you tape them to your shoulders just to sing?
Can you fly? I heard you can, can you fly?
Like an eagle doin' your hunting from the sky?

I followed with the sideshows to another town
And I found you in a trailer on the camping grounds
You were betting on some lover, you were shaking up the dice
And I thought I saw you cheating once or twice

Once or twice, I heard you did, once or twice
Were you wondering, was the gamble worth the price?
Pack it in, I heard you did, pack it in
Was it hard to fold a hand you knew could win?

So lately you've been hiding, it was somewhere in the news
And I'm still at these races with my ticket stubs and my blues
And a voice calls out the numbers and it sometimes mentions mine
And I feel like I've been working overtime

Overtime, I've lost my fire, overtime
Always playin' one more hand for one more dime
Slowin' down, I'm getting tired, slowin' down
And I envy you the valley that you've found
'Cause I'm midway down the midway, slowin' down, down, down

",That Song About the Midway,2005

Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay

And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed""

In the morning and started to laugh

Here comes your ghost again
But that's not unusual
It's just that the moon is full
And you happened to call
And here I sit
Hand on the telephone

A couple of light years ago
Heading straight for a fall

As I remember your eyes
Were bluer than robin's eggs
My poetry was lousy you said
Where are you calling from?
A booth in the midwest
Ten years ago
I bought you some cufflinks
You brought me something

They bring diamonds and rust

Well you burst on the scene
Already a legend
The unwashed phenomenon
The original vagabond
You strayed into my arms
And there you stayed
Temporarily lost at sea
The Madonna was yours for free
Yes the girl on the half-shell
Would keep you unharmed

Now I see you standing
With brown leaves falling around
And snow in your hair
Now you're smiling out the window
Of that crummy hotel
Over Washington Square
Our breath comes out white clouds
Mingles and hangs in the air
Speaking strictly for me
We both could have died then and there

Now you're telling me
You're not nostalgic
Then give me another word for it
You who are so good with words
And at keeping things vague
Because I need some of that vagueness now
It's all come back too clearly

And if you're offering me diamonds and rust
I've already paid",Diamonds and Rust,2010
Judy Collins,"An old cowboy went riding out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw
A-plowing through the ragged sky and up the cloudy draw

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the Riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cry

Yippie yi Ohhhhh
Yippie yi yaaaaay
Ghost Riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's riding hard to catch that herd, but he ain't caught 'em yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snorting fire
As they ride on hear their cry

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name
If you want to save your soul from Hell a-riding on our range
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
Trying to catch the Devil's herd, across these endless skies

pressed and polished, shaking hands down at the store
Everyone had come to see the all-star hop the greyhound bus and go to war
He punched me in the arm to say goodbye
It was the first time that I saw our father cry

I kept all my brother's letters tied in ribbon in a box beneath my bed
Every night I read by flashlight with the covers in a tent above my head
His words said ""Not to worry, doing fine""
It was his way of trying to ease my mind
While I was trying not to read between the lines

So much to lose, so much to miss
It doesn't seem fair that an innocent boy
Should have to carry the weight of the world

Then it was football games and homecoming and
picking out our dresses for the prom
With my brother in some desert dodging bullets when he wasn't dodging bombs
While we went from the land of brave and free
To just being afraid to disagree
While I was being brought down to my knees by

The weight of the world, too heavy to lift
So much to lose, so much to miss
It doesn't seem fair that an innocent boy
Should have to carry the weight of the world

It was the middle of December when the Army sent my brother home at last
While the flagpole by the football field flew the colors half-way down the mast
The wind blew cold and snow was coming down
Still everybody turned out from our town
As we laid my brother in that frozen ground

Oh, and that music filled my soul

Climbing against the wind
Even a strong heart has to break
And learn to love and heal again

All that runnin' got to me
Could I stop and still be free?
Could I break and still be whole?
Would I live to rock and roll?

Got some friends who stood by me
Tellin' me that I would survive
Said, ""You're strong, you sing your song
Know you're lucky to be alive""

But it never was you
It never was anywhere you
An occasional sunset reminded me
Or a flower hanging high on a julep tree
Or one red star hung low in the west
Or a heart-break call from a Meadow Lark's nest
Made me think for a moment
Maybe its true
I found him in the star
In the call 
In the blue
But it never was you
It never was anywhere you
Anywhere, anywhere you",It Never Was You,1963
Judy Garland,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

I know you're around by the thunder I hear in advance

And yours is the only music that makes me dance

You'll sleep and you'll rise in the light of two eyes that adore you
Bore you it might, but you won't leave my sight or glance

I tried to warn you somehow.

Now you must pay;

Judy Garland,"The moment I saw him smile
I knew he was just my style
My only regret is we've never met
Though I dream of him all the while

But he doesn't know I exist
No matter how I may persist
So it's clear to see there's no hope for me
Though I live at fifty-one-thirty-five Kensington Avenue
And he lives at fifty-one-thirty-three

How can I ignore the boy next door
I love him more than I can say
Doesn't try to please me
Doesn't even tease me
And he never sees me glance his way

And though I'm heart-sore, the boy next door
Affection for me won't display
I just adore him
So I can't ignore him

Judy Garland,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1970
Judy Garland,"I cried for you
Now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning.

But I'll find two eyes just a little bit bluer,
I'll find a heart just a little bit truer.
I cried for you
Now it's your turn to cry over me.

I know I'm no glamour girl like Baby - like her. 
But maybe someday you'll realize that glamour isn't the only thing in this world. 
If your show's a flop you'll find you can't eat glamour for breakfast. 
Anyway, I might be pretty good-looking myself when I grow out of this ugly-duckling stage. 
And you're no Clark Gable yourself. 
But that's all right. 
Don't worry about me, I'll recover. 
Time is a great healer. 
But in the future if we should meet again at the opera or at a ball, and 
I'm dazzling in my diamonds and pearls and ermine wraps, 
And surrounded by lords and dukes and princes, you'll probably be sorry. 
And you'll probably realize that life is just an idiot's delight. 
And as I speed through the night into the abyss of oblivion, 
I can only say thanks - thanks for the memory.

I'll find two eyes just a little bit bluer,
I'll find a heart just a little bit truer.
I cried for you

Judy Garland,"Johnny could only sing one note
And the note he sang was this
Ahh

Poor Johnny one note sang out with gusto
And just overlorded the place
Poor Johnny one note, yelled willy nilly
Until he was blue in the face
For holding one note was his ace

Couldn't hear the brass
Couldn't hear the drum
He was in a class, by himself, by gum

Poor Johnny one note got in Aida
Indeed a great chance to be brave
He took his one note, howled like the north wind
Brought forth wind that made critics rave
While Verdi turned 'round in his grave

Couldn't hear the flute
Or the big trombone
Every one was mute, Johnny stood alone

Cats and dogs stopped yapping
Lions in the zoo all were jealous of Johnny's big trill
Thunder claps stopped clapping
Traffic ceased its roar and they tell us Niagara stood still

He stopped the train whistles, boat whistles
Steam whistles, cop whistles
All whistles bowed to his skill
Ahh

Sing Johnny one note, sing out with gusto
And just overlord all the crowd
So sing Johnny one note, out loud
Sing Johnny one note
Sing Johnny one note out loud

Judy Garland,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this: a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

When we were young last night",Last Night When We Were Young,1970
Judy Garland,"As I wash my dishes, I'll be following a plan
Till I see the brightness in every pot and pan
I am sure this point of view will ease the daily grind
So I'll keep repeating in my mind

Look for the silver lining
Whenever a cloud appears in the blue
Remember somewhere the sun is shining
And so the right thing to do is make it shine for you

A heart full of joy and gladness
Will always banish sadness and strife
So always look for the silver lining
And try to find the sunny side of life

So always look for the silver lining
And try to find the sunny side of life

Judy Garland,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
Way above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?

There's nothing I can do about it        
Loving may be all you can give        
But baby I can't live without it
Oh, how I'd cry, oh, how I'd cry
If you got tired and said ""Good-bye""

More than I'd show
More than you'd ever know",More Than You Know,1989
Judy Garland,"Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you

Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me
You and you alone
Bring out the Gypsy in me 

I love all, the many charms about you
Above all, I want my arms about you

Don't be a naughty, baby
Come to papa, come to papa, do
My sweet embraceable you

Judy Garland,"When a girl meets boy,
Life can be a joy,
But the note they end on,
Will depend on little pleasures they will share,
So let us compare.

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?

I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes,
To a degree.
I love the common folks,
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue,
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?

I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine,
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?

I'm so delighted I've ignited the spark within you.
Let me continue to make it burn.
With you I will be like a Trilby, so let's not dally.
Come on Svengali, I've lots to learn.
When you're arisin', start exercisin' daily.
For example, just a sample?
Bend and touch the floor fifty times or more.
Ha! A fine start to be a Bernhardt!

A dictionary's necessary but not for talking,
It's used for walking the Ziegfeld way.
Is this okay?
That's the trick, you're catching on quickly.
Should I take a bow?
A-ho! Let me show you how!
Just like partners on the stage.
If you can use a partner,
I'm the right age.",How About You?,1990
Judy Garland,"When Louis came home to the flat,
He hung up his coat and his hat,
He gazed all around, but no wifey he found,
So he said ""where can Flossie be at?""
A note on the table he spied,
He read it just once, then he cried
It ran, ""Louis dear, it's too slow for for me hear,
So I think I will go for a ride.""

""Meet me in St. Louis, Louis,
Meet me at the fair,
Don't tell me the lights are shining
Any place but there,
We will dance the Hoochee Koochee,
I will be your tootsie wootsie,
If you will meet in St. Louis, Louis,
Meet me at the fair.""

Judy Garland,"Love your skimmer Judy, where did you grab it?

My hat?
Oh Bing, how nice of you to ask me that.
Because there's a very interesting story 
Connected with this hat, there really is.
I was walking down the street the other day,
Ran into Mllicent Palmer, you know Millicent Palmer,
A very dear friend of mine.

How do I get involved?

Well we walked around the corner for what passes
For a millinery shop and she looked in the window and
Saw my hat and said, ""that is for you""
I went in, the saleslady put it on my head and I 
Thought it was a little matronly 

Time

Oh, now wait, no wait

Cut

When I got my arm around you and we're going for a walk
Must you ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, talk, talk, talk
When we're sitting close together in a cozy taxi cab
Must you ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, gab, gab, gab
Aristotle, mathematics, economics, antique chairs
The classics, the comics, darling, who cares?
There's a brand new moon this evening and the weather should be fine
If you  ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, same old line
I'll politely close your lips with mine

How's your golf Bing?

My golf? Ho-ho I'm really moving that ball out there, striking it a ton.
I had a sixty-nine Sunday, should have been a sixty-five.
Terrific wind blowing, couldn't drop a single putt, it was murder

Oh, I lost my head with this question

And of course the equipment, you just can't get any golf balls anymore
The actors are hoarding them all...and the caddies, huh they want an 
Annuity for eighteen holes. You've got to take an option on one to be sure
He'll show up.

Cut
Sorry
When the parlour lights are lowered and the family isn't in
Must you ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, chin, chin, chin
When there's music softly playing and I'm sitting on your lap
Must you ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, yap, yap, yap
Forward passes, second baggers, or a jockey who is hot.
Or boxing, or hockey, darling, so what?

I'll attempt some other evening.
Well you can call for me at nine

Calling?
But if you ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, same old line
What do you mean the same old line?
Same line

You asked me about my hat,
You've been standing there for an hour 
And a half talking your big fat head off

I thought
About golf

I just
You didn't even let me finish my story
I told you what I would do
Oh darling, let me finish
Steady, steady

It's so nice to close your lips with mine.","Yah-Ta-Ta, Yah-Ta-Ta (Talk, Talk, Talk)",1990
Judy Garland,"I'll remember forever
When I was but three
Mama, who was clever
Remarking to me
If son when you're grown up
You want everything nice
I've got your future sewn up
If you take this advice

Be a clown, be a clown
All the world loves a clown
Act the fool, play the calf
And you'll always have the last laugh

Wear the cap and the bells
And you'll rate with all the great swells
If you become a doctor, folks'll face you with dread
If you become a dentist, they'll be glad when you're dead
You'll get a bigger hand if you can stand on your head
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown

Be a clown, be a clown
All the world loves a clown
Show 'em tricks, tell 'em jokes
And you'll only stop with top folks

Be a crack Jackanapes
And they'll imitate you like apes
Why be a great composer with your rent in arrears
Why be a major poet and you'll owe it for years
When crowds'll pay to giggle if you wiggle your ears
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown

Be a clown, be a clown
All the world loves a clown
If you just make 'em roar
Watch your Mounte bank account soar

Wear a painted mustache
And you're sure to make a big splash
A college education I should never propose
A bachelor's degree won't even keep you in clothes
But millions you will win if you can spin on your nose
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown

Give 'em quips, give 'em fun
And they'll happy to say you're A-1
If you become a farmer you've the weather to buck
If you become a gambler you'll be stuck with your luck
But Jack you'll never lack if you can quack like a duck

In a dream of you

Was suddenly real

And pray you'd hear me

I'd unravel ev'ry riddle for my 
Individdle
In trouble or in pain
With the thoughts that you'll be thinkin'
You could be another Lincoln

Oh, I, could tell you why

I could think of things I'd never
Thunk before,
And then I'd sit down and think some more.

My head all full of stuffin',
My heart all full of pain;
And perhaps I'd deserve you and be
Even worthy even  you

Judy Garland,"It came upon a midnight clear that glorious song of old
From angels bending near the earth to touch their harps of gold
Peace on the earth goodwill to men from heaven all gracious 
King
The world in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels sing

For lo the days are hastening on by prophets seen of old
When with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold
When the new heaven and earth shall on the Prince of peace 
their king
And the whole world send back the song which now the angels 
sing

Still through the cloven skies they come with peaceful wings 
unfurled
And still their heavenly music floats o'er all the weary world
Above its sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wing
And ever o'er its Babel sounds the blessed angels sing

Yet with the woes of sin and strife the world has suffered long
Beneath the heavenly strain have rolled two thousand years of 
wrong
And man at war with man hears not the tidings which they bring
O hush the noise ye men of strife and hear the angels sing

O ye, beneath life's crushing load whose forms are bending low
Who toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slow
Look now for glad and golden hours come swiftly on the wing
O rest beside the weary road and hear the angels sing

For lo the days are hastening on by prophets seen of old
When with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold
When peace shall over all the earth its ancient splendors fling
And the whole world give back the song which now the angels sing",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,1991
Judy Garland,"Dreary days are over
Life's a four leaf clover
Sessions of depression are through
Every hope I longed for long ago, comes true

Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me

Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last!

Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's Lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me

Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for
Long ago was you",Long Ago (And Far Away),1991
Judy Garland,"I happen to like New York, I happen to love this town
I like the city air, I like to drink of it
The more I see New York, the more I think of it
I like the sight and the sound and even the stink of it

I like to go to Battery Park and watch the liners booming in
I often ask myself why should it be
That they come so far across the sea?
I suppose it's because they all agree with me
They happen to like New York

Last Sunday afternoon, I took a trip to Hackensack
But after I gave Hackensack the once over
I took the next train back
I happen to like New York

And oh, the Easter Show at the Music Hall
A perfect delight
And oh, pastrami on rye at the Carnegie Deli
There's joy in each pie

And Madison Square for a Friday night fight
Or a walk along Broadway to guest at the lights
And at Carnegie Hall where the atmosphere's right
Life at the lights, at the night

I happen to like New York, I happen to love this burg
And when I have to give the world my last farewell
And the undertaker comes to ring my funeral bell
