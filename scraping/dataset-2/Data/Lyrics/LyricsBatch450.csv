Angel Olsen,"Thought I had a clue
It was passing by
Thought I had an answer
It was just a sigh
Thought I had a dream once
Don't remember what
Your voice cut straight through me
Right down to my bones
Like a winter's wind, it
Knocked out my soul

Thought I had some time here
Left my watch at home
Thought I had ideas once
They were all on loan 
Thought I conquered something
Then it took me down
What I thought I heard clearly
It wasn't sound
Thought I felt your heartbeat
It was just my counting
Unto what thoughts will
My life be amounting

I can hear you crying
And I am crying, too
The world might be lying
But so are you

I can see you dancing
If you'd just take the step
You might still have it in you
Give yourself the benefit
And dance slow decades
Toward the sun
Even when you're the only one

Don't look around
It's not right
It's not wrong
Dance because you know the song
I dance because
I know this one",Dance Slow Decades,2014
Angel Olsen,"I need advice, it's true
But I won't hear it from you
I don't remember when
You last cared for the things I did

I wish I could believe
Apply all the sides you've seen
Or you could be the only one
Who knows the truth of me

Am I the ugly one?
It's easy to see past
All of the kindness that you've offered me
It doesn't last

It's just a thought I've had
If I could show you how
I came to think this way
Maybe you'd understand me now

Sometimes our enemies
Are closer than we think
Sometimes the ones we trust
May have to give up listening

I wish it were the same
As it is in my mind
I'd lie to learn a thing or two
Give me a reason why

Why am I not ashamed?
While I am standing still
You want to move in me like you did before
But I've had my fill

You say your time has changed
That you have faced defeat
We might be older now
But is it changing anything?

It could be in a way
We've learned to carry well
Oh, how I wish I could
Remove this doubt I feel somehow

I want the best for you
So I won't look your way
Maybe the clouds will clear
And I'll be seeing you someday

I wish it were the same
As it is in my mind
I am lighter on my feet
When I've left some things behind
Mm mm mm mm mm hmm hmm",Enemy,2014
Angel Olsen,"All is forgiven
Alright, you are forgiven
If there's one thing I fear
There's one thing I fear
It's knowing you're around
So close but not here
So close
Oh, but not with me here
So close
But not with me here

All is forgotten
All is forgotten
I've made up my mind
I've made up my mind
I've wasted my time
Making up my mind
I don't know anything
I don't know anything
I don't know anything
But I love you
Yes, I do
Yes, I do

Will you ever forgive me
A thousand times through
For loving you?
For loving you?
For loving you?",Forgiven/Forgotten,2014
Angel Olsen,"I feel so lonesome I could cry
But instead I'll pass the time
Sittin' lonely with somebody lonely too
Well, there’s nothin' in the world I’d rather do
Now tell me if you don’t feel this way
But all I want, all I ever need
Is someone out there who believes

Sometimes believe
Not always believe
Sometimes believe

Now we don’t have to take it to extreme
We'll keep our hands, our legs, even our lips apart
But I’m giving you my heart, my heart
Are you giving me your heart, your heart?

Are you lonely too?
Are you lonely too?
High five, so am I
All of your life
Stuck in time

I’m stuck, too
I’m stuck with you, you, you, you
I do, I do, I do",Hi-Five,2014
Angel Olsen,"You're gone, you're gone
You're with me but you're gone
A feeling once so strong
Is now an old and forgotten song
That you don't sing so high and wild
You don't sing so high and wild
You're here, you're here
But your spirit's disappeared
Off to some place that I don't know
Some human thing has squashed your soul
And I don't recognize you

I wish that this could turn our thing to bliss
And we could put our fears aside
And learn to laugh and be alive
And let our bodies be revived

But you can't
Say that you want me
What am I supposed to think? That's the truth?
Well, has it ever been easy for you?
To stand behind the things that I do

I wait for this to pass
For us to both say at last
On this dark and narrow path
The sun is shining and we remember what it is we're living for

I'm neither innocent or wise when you look me in the eyes
You might as well be blind
You might as well be blind
Cause you don't see me anymore

And you
You can't tell me that you love me
When I'm standing in your way
Well this would all be so much easier
If I had nothing more to say

Well this would all be so much easier
If I had nothing more to say
Oh, if only, if only
I had nothing more to say
Oh, if only, if only
I had nothing more to say",High & Wild,2014
Angel Olsen,"If only all our memories were one
We only had to blink and it was done
If all the world could see it with one eye
In perfect color to the perfect sky

If only we could turn ourselves around
And all the things we're looking for were found
If only we grew wiser with each breath
If only we could dance our way to death

If only all our dreams were coming true
Maybe there'd be some time for me and you
If only all the world could sing along
In perfect rhythm to the perfect song

If only all our hopes were to be here
We'd just close our eyes when we want to disappear
If only all the love we needed was gained
If only we could always stay the same
If only we could always stay the same

We'd close our doors and then we'd go to bed
We’d never have to do it all again
There wouldn't be one thing to fight about
And time would turn our bodies inside out
And time would turn our bodies inside out",Iota,2014
Angel Olsen,"If you don't feel good about it, then turn around
If you really mean it, baby, stand your ground
No one's gonna take it for you, darling, it's true
No one's gonna make it for you

If you feel like quitting now, then try a little harder
The things we need the most they seem to take a little longer
No one's gonna try it for you, darling, no one
No one's gonna wait there with you

Just when you thought you would turn all your lights out, it shines
Some days all you need is one good thought strong in your mind

If you don't believe me, you can go ahead and laugh
If you've got a sense of humor, you're not so bad
No one's gonna hear it the same as it's said
No one's gonna listen to it straight from your head

If you feel like running out, then stand in one place
When you're still and when you run, there's something to face
No one's gonna see your life through, there's no way
I wouldn't want to know what you see every day

If you don't feel good about it, then turn around
If you really mean it, baby, stand your ground
No one's gonna take it for you, darling, it's true
No one's gonna wait there with you

Just when you thought you would turn all your lights out, it shines
Oh, some days all you need is one good thought strong in your mind",Lights Out,2014
Angel Olsen,"I think you like to see me lose my mind
You treat me like a child, I'm angry, blind
I feel so much at once that I could scream
I wish I had the voice of everything
I wish I had the voice of everything

To scream the animals, to scream the earth
To scream the stars out of our universe
To scream it all back into nothingness
To scream the feeling 'til there's nothing left
To scream the feeling 'til there's nothing left

I'll close my eyes
I'll close my eyes and try to breathe for the world 
Well you could change my mind with just a smile
And just before I turn to leave, I think
I could use the thoughts you've given me
Oh, I could use the thoughts you've given me

To sing the animals, to sing the earth
To sing the stars into our universe
To sing it all back into something new
To sing for life, for myself, and maybe you

Wish I had the voice of everything, sometimes
Wish I had the voice of everything

I'll close my eyes
I'll close my eyes and try to breathe for the world
Ooh, for the world
Ooh, for the world
Oh oh oh oh ah
Yes, for the world",Stars,2014
Angel Olsen,"I quit my dreaming the moment that I found you
I started dancing just to be around you
Here's to thinking that it all meant so much more
I kept my mouth shut and opened up the door

I wanted nothing but for this to be the end
For this to never be a tied and empty hand
If all the trouble in my heart would only mend
I lost my dream, I lost my reason all again

It's not just me for you
I have to look out too
I have to save my life
I need some peace of mind

I am the only one now
I am the only one now
I am the only one now

You may not be around
You may not be around
You may not be around

I am the only one now
I am the only one now
I am the only one now
I am the only one now",Unfucktheworld,2014
Angel Olsen,"Everything is tragic
It all just falls apart
But when I look into your eyes
It pieces up my heart

If I only had an answer
To put it all to bed
I wish sometimes I could take back
Every word I've said

I walk back in the night alone
Got caught up in my song
Forgot where I was sleeping
None of the lights were on
I heard my mother thinking me right back into my birth
I laughed so loud inside myself it all began to hurt

So I turned on a picture show
I disappeared the lines
As memories came flooding in
The tears blew out my eyes

I see an elevator
A moment I am above
I look for you or someone
Who can still remind me of
The tight grip and the sun lick
And the calm way of all things summer
When it's all here
And it's all new
And you're not hungover

Fierce and light and young
Fierce and light and young
When you don't know that you're wrong
Or just how wrong you are

My feet are always heavy
As I inch toward the door
I thought we'd leave this for ourselves a hundred times before
But I guess we're always leaving even when we look the same
And it eases me somehow to know that even this will change

If you've still got some light in you then go before it's gone
Burn your fire for no witness, it's the only way it's done

Fierce and light and young
Fierce and light and young
Hit the ground and run
Hit the ground and run",White Fire,2014
Angel Olsen,"Won't you open a window sometime?
What's so wrong with the light?
What's so wrong with the light?
Wind in your hair, sun in your eyes

We throw our shadows down
We must throw our shadows down
We live and throw our shadows down
It's how we get around
In the sun

Why can't you see? 
Why can't you see?
Why can't you see?

Are you blind? 
Are you blind?

Angel Olsen,"Hurts to be around you
I can't stand to hear your lying
Whenever you're beside me
A part of me is dying

And every time I see you
I tell myself I'll never
Have this feeling with another
Oh, you're in my heart forever

What is it 
You think I need 
Everything
It's not true

Give it all up for you
Give it all up for you

Want to touch you
Show you how it feels
Whenever you're around
Take my time with you, my love

You're the one I'm thinking of
You're the one I'm thinking of
You're the one I really love

In my arms and fast asleep
In my arms and all my dreams

I want to be
I want to be
I want to be",Give It Up,2016
Angel Olsen,"I've seen you changing
I've seen you changing

Was it me you were thinking of?
All the time when you thought of me
Was it me you were thinking of?
All the time when you thought of me

Or was it your mother?
Or was it your shelter?
Or was it another
With a heart shaped face
Got a heart shaped face
Was it a feeling you thought I could dig up or erase?

I've seen you changing
I've seen you aging
And I learned how to turn my head
And I learned how to walk away
And the truth never really lives
In the story of words we say

You never needed anyone to expose you to yourself
And you never needed anyone to raise you hell out of your mind

I never wanted to be someone who had to leave it all behind
Even still there is no escape for what I face, I faced before
Have whatever love you wanna have
But I can't be here anymore

There is nothing new
Under the sun
There is nothing new
Under the sun

Going through the motions as you sing your song
Doesn't matter who you are or what you've done
Still got to wake up and be someone
Still got to wake up and be someone

I don't care what the papers say
It's just another intern with a resumé
I am going to fall in love with you some day
I'm gonna fall in love and run away
I'm gonna fall in love and run away

Everyone I know has got their own ideal
I just want to be alive, make something real

Heaven hits me when I see your face
I go blind, every time

Hate to have to watch you go

Angel Olsen,"My watch is blurry when I look down at my hands
I'm just another, alive with impossible plans
I turn the lights low but we both know where we are
And when it's over, what becomes of your pure heart?

A love that never seems to curse or to confine
Will be forever never lost or too defined
To lose the feeling of an endless searching through
How to have made what is never about me or you
That is the kind of love I'd always dreamed to be
However painful, let it break down all of me

'Til I am nothing else but the feeling
'Til I am nothing else but the feeling

Becoming true
Can't help feeling the way that I do
Can't help feeling the way that I do

Become a fool

I'll let the light shine in
I'll let the light shine in
May the best of you win
Who is your truest friend?
Are they there at your end?
I'll let the light be black
And let some tears be shed
Do it all over again
I'll let the light shine in

It's not gonna kill you, it's not gonna kill you
It's not gonna kill you, it's not gonna kill you
It's not gonna break you, it's just gonna shake you
Shake you alive

I ain't giving up tonight
Even if you walk around
As though you think you're right

Shut up, kiss me, hold me tight
Shut up, kiss me, hold me tight
Stop your crying, it's alright

We could rewind all of those tears

Oh, it wasn't what she said
She came together like a dream
That I didn't know I had
From the sleeping life I lead
All the colors I have seen
I can't help but recognize
The brighter one in front of me
Oh, the truth I thought I learned
And then it finally came along
Turned around and then it's there

I want to know you
I want to show you
I want to be there
I want to see her
Piece us together
Know it's forever
Show me the future
Tell me you'll be there
I want to go where
Nobody knows fear
I want to follow
My heart down that wild road

Everywhere I go
I can see your face
Alive and gone at once
Hey, that's the way I see this place
And all this blessing was a curse
Before I opened up my heart
You learn to take it as it comes
You fall together, fall apart

I want to know you
I want to show you
I want to be there
I want to see her
Live it through your eyes

Angel Olsen,"Living out my life as though I knew how it was done
I have sat upon many a hillside in the sun
Same old feelings have their way of coming back around
Makes me wonder why I ever bother leaving town

All that time I was trying to be clever
Didn’t know that I’d be loving you forever
All the years I spent chasing a meaning
How unfair to have a heart that’s still beating
When I can’t just love a moment that’s fleeting
When I can’t just love a moment that’s fleeting

How many disasters will it take to make you smile
Haven’t seen you laughing at yourself in quite a while
People that you love that never learn how to speak with
Sometimes what you don’t gain, it's another kind of gift

Angel Olsen,"It may as well have been forgotten
Or did it simply slip your mind?
Is that my heart that's splitting open?
I guess it just fell to the side

I've tried my best to keep you smiling, love
Maybe it's been all in vain
But I would try a million times, my dear
Tell me would you do the same?

One could say it's complicated, love
Like nothing they've seen before
Or simply that it is a thought we share
Forever it must be ignored

If you really love me, there's no way to tell
I'm always arriving when you say farewell
In all of my dreams we are husband and wife
I'll never forget you all of my life
I'll never forget you all of my life
I'll never forget you all of my life",May as Well [*],2017

It's not there where I left

Can't wait to see you, baby

Searching for some magic
Freeze from the thought of dying

Well, I'm feeling kinda tired

Want to be someone else, not me, but another
Right here in this moment, I wish I could reach you
I'm just a vessel, far away, I see you
Too many like us, run out of the steeple
Guess you could say I lost some faith in people

Want every thought to be golden or fire
I could be made out of truth, not some liar
Want to be tempered, sick to be tested
To see it all clearly, whenever it's rested
Want every lesson, the lessons they teach me
Someone who knows where I am, whenever they reach me

Give me a season, show me some reason
Love me whenever it's out of season

Galopando, galopando
Crin revuelta en llamaradas

Trepo las sierras con luna
Cruzó los valles nevando
Cien caminos anduvimos
Mi alazán te estoy nombrando

Qué oscuro lazo de nieve 
Te pialó junto al barranco 
Cómo fue que no lo viste 
Qué estrella andabas buscando 

En el fondo del abismo
Ni una voz para nombrarlo
Solito se fue muriendo

En una horqueta de un tala 
Hay un morral solitario
Y hay un corral sin relinchos

Que hay cielos pal' buen caballo
Por ahí andará mi flete

Llorando en el río

En la noche serrana
Llora la quena su honda nostalgia
Y el caminito sabe
Quién es la chola
Que el indio llama

La voz doliente de la baguala
Y el camino lamenta
Ser el culpable
De la distancia

When she was nine years old
She had a little trouble
Doing what she was told
Strong-willed, spirit-filled, innocent, wild
Not your typical yes ma'am, no ma'am child
It was her life and she was gonna live it
And if it took her heart and soul
She was gonna give it

She was young enough to question
Old enough to know
There's no place in this world she couldn't go
And if the road runs out
She's gonna build a bridge
To the other side
That's just how she is
That's just how she is, she is, she is, she is

The day she turned eighteen
She instinctively knew
Love is the teacher
Life is the school
And she figured it out one fateful day
That if she played it safe she would never play
And in that moment hearts dream about
A girl walked in and a woman walked out

She was young enough to question
Old enough to know
There's no place in this world she couldn't go
And if the road runs out
She's gonna build a bridge
To the other side

That's just how she is, she is, she is, she is

Burning deep inside

I'm gonna make it mine

Angel Rodríguez,"Hey girl don't you know
Money buys almost anything
But it can't buy real love.

I see you everyday but you never look at me
You're always looking good but you look unhappy
Tell me why you choose to live like this
If you were mine I'd never make you feel like this
You need a man not someone that's gonna hurt you
You need to let him go he doesn't deserve you
And when I say I'll make you happy it's true
Or you could stay with your man
And get your heart broken too
But here's my number call me up if you want
And when you feel lonely you could roll through my spot
See I ain't trippin' homies lost in my game
Nobody know's it til we say 'cause I'm ahead of the game
'Cause I'm a king what I need is a queen I could have a million dollars but it won't mean a thing
Now I ain't rich but I'll tell you one thing
I could give you more happiness then money can bring

Now I don't drive a fancy car,
No diamond in my pinkie ring
Barely make enough to get me by
Nothing left for material things
But hey girl don't you know money buys almost anything
But it can't buy real love

I want to be you're only one
And you could be mine too
'Cause baby I'm going crazy
When I think about you
I get excited when I see you come through
Nobody else made me feel the way that you do
I need a woman not a girl
Not just someone to fuck
I don't mean no disrespect
But that's wassup
I see you smile when I talk like that
It seems like it's been a while since you smiled like that
But maybe we can kick it
You spend a little time
Sit down one-on-one
And let you know what's on my mind
I know a good thing when I see it
And I see it in you
So tell me what I gotta do to make you feel the same too
Because I'm a king what I need is a queen
I could have a million dollars
But it won't mean a thing
Now I ain't rich
But I can tell you one thing
I can give you more happiness
Then money can bring
And that's real

Now I don't drive a fancy car,
No diamond in my pinkie ring
Barely make enough to get me by
Nothing left for material things
But hey girl don't you know money buys almost anything
But it can't buy real love

That's all I've got to give my heart and soul to you
Only way I wanna live sharing each moment with you
Take it fast take it slow girl you know it's real this time (so real)
Don't let true love pass you by baby

Now I don't drive a fancy car,
No diamond in my pinkie ring
Barely make enough to get me by
Nothing left for material things
But hey girl don't you know money buys almost anything
But it can't buy real love

A kind of a fellow that wouldn't even harm a flea

I'd murder that son of a gun in the first degree

That ain't that I don't smoke myself 
And I don't reckon they'll injure your health
I've smoked 'em all my life and I ain't dead yet

At a pheasant party or a poker game
Everything's gotta stop when they have that cigarette

Smoke smoke smoke that cigarette 
Puff puff puff 
And if you smoke yourself to death
Tell St Peter at the Golden Gate 
That you hate to make him wait
But you just gotta have another cigarette

Now at a game of chance the other night 
Ol' Dame Forson wasn't doin' me right
Them kings and queens just kept on comin' round
Well I got a full and I bet it high 
But my plug didn't work on a certain guy
He just kept a risin' and a layin' that money down
He's raise me and I'd raise him 
I sweated blood I had to sink or swim

But you just gotta have another cigarette

The other night I had a date with 
The cutest gal in the fifty states
A high bred uptown social little dame
She said she loved me and it seemed to me 
That things were like they ought a be
So hand in hand we strolled down Lover's Lane
She was oh so far from a chunk of ice 
And our smoochin' party was a goin' real nice
So help and I think I'd of been there yet
But I give her a hug and a little squeeze 
And she said ""Willie excuse me please
But I just gotta have another cigarette""
Smoke smoke smoke that cigarette 
Puff puff puff 
And if you smoke yourself to death
Tell St Peter at the Golden Gate 
That you hate to make him wait
But you just gotta have another cigarette
Smoke smoke smoke that cigarette 
Puff puff puff 
And if you smoke yourself to death
Tell St Peter at the Golden Gate 
That you hate to make him wait
But you just gotta have another cigarette
Just gotta have another cigarette",Smoke! Smoke! Smoke! That Cigarette,1994

But how can you defend yourself when you don't face the foe?
All you do is hang your head in shame
How can you defend yourself when you're too scared to fight?
Looking for someone else to blame
Whose to blame for the shame

We all want to be free but none of us could see
We are all prisoners and we all forged the chains
From the cradle to the grave
We all like to think we're brave
But we're all cowards too scared to take the blame

But how can you defend yourself when you don't face the foe?
All you do is hang your head in shame
How can you defend yourself when you're too scared to fight?
Looking for someone else to blame
Whose to blame for the pain

Someone's fightin' in the street
We made a hasty retreat
Saying it's got nothing to do with me
Put yourself in his place
You got blood on your face
A helping hand and the night is watching

But how can you defend yourself when you don't face the foe?
All you do is hang your head in shame
How can you defend yourself when you're too scared to fight?
Looking for someone else to blame
Oh, the shame",Whose to Blame,1986

Angel y Khriz,"Siéntate hijo mío y escúchame 
Se que eres chico y quiero que empieces a entender 
No quiero que juegues jamás con mi guitarra 
Es juego de manos que después te llega al alma 
Yo la abrace mas tiempo a ella de lo que abrace a tu madre 
Es por eso que te pido no trates de acostumbrarte 

Te dolerá el corazón
Cuando quieras desahogarte con ella en una canción 
Por la que quiso engañarte

Sentirás que es tu mejor compañera 
En un momento de tristeza 
Con ella te desahogaras
Y nunca trates de olvidar algún amor con una copa 
Porque mas la recordaras 

Siéntate hijo mío y escúchame 
(Y nunca, nunca trates de ser como yo, te aconsejo por que te quiero 
es por eso es que te digo hijo escúchame) 

Siéntate hijo mío y escúchame 
Voy enseñarte a respetar a una mujer 
Si algún día te enamoras y ella tiene un feo pasado 
Solo tienes que preocuparte como se porte a tu lado 

Trata de nunca fijarte en mujeres que no están solas 
Yo sé que eso tiene un gustito tentador, pero hay otras

Algunas buscan amar 
Otras buscan aventuras 
Y muchas miraran solamente tu postura 
Serás seguramente un buen amante 
Ninguna podrá atraparte 
De esas que quieren lastimar

Serás un hombre echo y derecho 
pero para mí siempre serás

El MVP 
Para ustedes 

Yo, que todo te lo di 
Que por quererte a ti 
Perdí mi tiempo 
Y ahora estoy perdiendo 
Hasta las ganas de vivir 
No me pagues así 
No es justo que yo 
Que todo te lo di 
Que por quererte a ti 
Perdí mi tiempo 
Y ahora estoy perdiendo 
Hasta las ganas de vivir 
No me pagues así 
No es justo que yo 

Yo fui el hombre de tu vida 
Quien te enseño a amar 
El primero que, sin duda 
Te hizo temblar 
Para mí una fantasía hecha realidad 
Pero fui solo un juguete 
Para ti, uno más 
Acabaste en un minuto 
Lo que habíamos forjado 
El futuro que una vez tú y yo dibujamos 
Todo era maravilloso en nuestra relación 
Y como si no fuera nada, destrozaste mi corazón 

Yo, que todo te lo di 
Que por quererte a ti 
Perdí mi tiempo 
Y ahora estoy perdiendo 
Hasta las ganas de vivir 
No me pagues así 
No es justo que yo 
Que todo te lo di 
Que por quererte a ti 
Perdí mi tiempo 
Y ahora estoy perdiendo 
Hasta las ganas de vivir 
No me pagues así 
No es justo que yo 

Que por amarte tanto viva yo esta agonía 
Que por cuidarte tanto se muera mi alegría 
Por ti me ahogo en llanto, me duele tu rechazo 
Y sigo pensando que no es justo que yo, mujer 
Que por amarte tanto viva yo esta agonía 
Que por cuidarte tanto se muera mi alegría 
Por ti me ahogo en llanto, me duele tu rechazo 
Y sigo pensando que no es justo que yo, mujer 
Pase por esta tormenta de color 
De tus manos en mi piel todavía siento ardor 
Para mencionar tu nombre necesito valor 
Y aunque fuiste la desgracia, no te guardo rencor 
Minuto a minuto, he aprendido a superarlo 
La vida me va bien, ya paso el tiempo amargo 
Y aunque sea difícil aceptarlo 
Todavía no comprendo porque tu engaño, si 

Yo, que todo te lo di 
Que por quererte a ti 
Perdí mi tiempo 
Y ahora estoy perdiendo 
Hasta las ganas de vivir 
No me pagues así 
No es justo que yo 
Que todo te lo di 
Que por quererte a ti 
Perdí mi tiempo 
Y ahora estoy perdiendo

Son 8 años tratando de estar donde estoy 
En un transcurso de vida hasta el sol de hoy 
Me he caído y mi ego me levanto 
Me he jodído pa' ser quien soy y no me voy 
Entre medio de tripeos y de pichaera 
Yo luchaba por un sueño y ayudar mi vieja 
Echarle pa'l de chelitos en la cartera 
Y demostrarle a la gente quien Christian Colón era 
Un chamaquito que quería superar to' los atrasos 
Sufriendo de pobresa y a la vez de rechazo 
Y dicho sea de paso nunca me arrepiento del pasado 
Por el a fin de cuenta he madurado y he aprendido 
A ser agradecido con quien me ha ayudado 
A superarme y dar por hecho mi sueño dorado 
Muchas cicatrices llevo por lo que he resbalado 
Pero en exito y progreso me han recompensado 
Ahora río por lo que he llorado 
Y to'as las noches de rodilla Dios es alabado 
En la esquinita de la cama que tanto sufrí 
Porque me lo he ganado, ahora es que me toca a mi

Como uno dice, pasando las de Cain 
Buscando plata pa' comer, y no pa' un bling bling 
Trabajando fuerte para poder subsistir 
Y mi desahogo era sentarme a escribir 
Y rimar de lo bueno que la vida era 
Del jangueo' y de to'a la jerga callejera 
Si hacia rimas de mi alacena 
Serian pocas porque no habia avena 
Y en el closet mucho menos ropa 
Inspirandome en la vida de otras personas 
Yo siendo material pa' la portada del ""Primera Hora"" 
Escribiendo lo que vi descubrí un talento 
Que aunque fuera en vano despejaba mi mente de este infierno
Pero en la calle ya la gente decía 
Que el que en la esquina vendía un gran futuro tendría 
Que si seguía como iba daban un vastagazo 
Y si volvia al callejon cogería un balaso 
Decidi cambiar y no dejar llevarme 
Buscar trabajo y en la universidad matricularme 
Gracias a Dios le doy por este tesoro

Que mis ojos son estrellas 
Que mi risa es la más bella 
Que todos mis atributos son perfectos para él 
Que si fuera un retratista 
Que si fuera un buen artista 
Yo sería su Mona Lisa y hasta un tango de Gardel 
Y a él solo lo trago yo

Que tú no eres para mí, siempre supe pero no hice caso
Que ni se te ocurra aparecer por aquí

Que no yo soy para ti, siempre supe pero no hice caso 
Que ni se me ocurra estar de nuevo junto a ti 
Estar de nuevo junto a ti

Que me promete la luna 
Que yo soy como ninguna 
Que parezco una doncella de esas que hay que proteger 
Que sus vicios ha dejado 
Que su suelo le ha aumentado 
Que me promete la vida que yo siento merecer 
Y hoy solo lo trago yo

Tanto que el me hablo de ti, y es verdad
Todo lo que me dijo es asi
Pero se le olvido decir

Que eres la mas hermosa, de todas las mujeres
Que eres casi perfecta, pero que no lo quieres
Que no sientes lo mismo y aun que herirlo no debes
Solo que del cariño de una pasion que muere

Yo se que el es mi amigo
Por eso nunca te hable
Pero hoy tengo que decirte que

Me enamoré, sin querer, sin razón, sin motivos
No se como fue, pero me enamoré
Tal vez fue todo lo que me dijo 
Tal vez no este bien

Pero me enamoré sin querer, sin razón, sin motivos
No se como fue, pero me enamoré
Tal vez fue todo lo que me dijo 
Tal vez no este bien
Pero me enamoré

Dime quien manda en el corazón 
Herirlo no es mi intencion
Pero quien va a entender que su alegría es mi perdición 
Sentire la presion y el efecto 
De fallarle a un amigo por mis defectos
Y a la vez conocer el amor perfecto para mi esto no hay pretextos

Se atento no valgo nada, no se como no darle cara
Perdóneme amigo que respetaba
Hoy tu cara soy bestia

Me enamoré, sin querer, sin razón, sin motivos
No se como fue, pero me enamoré
Tal vez fue todo lo que me dijo 
Tal vez no este bien

Pero me enamoré sin querer, sin razón, sin motivos
No se como fue, pero me enamoré
Tal vez fue todo lo que me dijo 
Tal vez no este bien
Pero me enamoré

Pa ser como por arte de magia
Me enamoré de todo lo que el decia
De tu cara, tus ojos, tu boca, tu piel
Y cada amanecer muy bella te veía
Y dime que puedo hacer
Si eres la mujer que me eriza la piel

Se que es un error quererla a usted
Pero en mi lado la quiero tener y
Fue creciendo poco a poco 
Este amor tan fuerte que siento por ti
Las noches son tan amargas por que no te tengo aqui
Fue creciendo el sentimiento 
Y sin darme cuenta diciéndote a ti
Sin ti no puedo vivir

Me enamoré, sin querer, sin razón, sin motivos
No se como fue, pero me enamoré
Tal vez fue todo lo que me dijo
Tal vez no este bien

Pero me enamoré sin querer, sin razón, sin motivos
No se como fue, pero me enamoré
Tal vez fue todo lo que me dijo
Tal vez no este bien
Pero me enamoré

Mi amor que te puedo decir
Me enamoré de ti
En el libro de los sentimientos nada esta escrito
Y en el lenguaje del amor 
No existe el jamas y el por siempre
Que el corazón decida

受け止めていてくれるから
飾らない言葉だけ
こぼれ落ちてくんだね
いつか夢のように
覚めてゆくのかな
忘れないよこの瞬間を
ずっと離さないでね

You're never there
So I go, so tell me what did I do
To keep you from holding on

I've cried the tears but that's not enough
To show you everything I'm missing
And you ask why did you leave me
Oh, why don't you believe me when I say

You never tried to stop the walls from tumbling down
You never tried to pick me up when no one was around
If I could break through, if I could be strong
If I could let go, I could stop the echo of you

So, I'm running as fast as I can, here I go
You're everything I don't want
But you have what I need, you come back
You're everywhere I go

I feel you all around me and you ask, what did I do
What to keep me from you and I say

You never tried to stop the walls from tumbling down
You never tried to pick me up when no one was around
If I could break through, if I could be strong
If I could let go, I could stop the echo

So many times I walked away, without leaving
Oh, but this time I'm going away believing, oh, oh

We should rewind and listen
To everything you've told me
So say goodbye to all your promises
While I promise you goodbye

You never tried to stop the walls from tumbling down
You never tried to pick me up when no one was around

If I could be right but I could be wrong

If I could break through, if I could be strong
If I could let go, I could stop the echo of you

Angela Ammons,"I believed in once upon a times
Happy ever after fairy tales
I believed a love I thought was mine
Never thought this heart could be so frail

All the shades you are have been shown
When somebody sees them, you will be alone

Will anybody know who I am
When I fall in love?
Will he be my best friend
Does anybody really know who you are

Or do they sometimes pretend they do?
Does love pretend too?

Silver futures that I'm searching for
Is love lucky or is it blind?
Round and round the seasons pass you by
The same thing happens time and time again, I'm asking why

Will anybody know who I am
When I fall in love?
Will he be my best friend?
Does anybody really know who you are

Or do they sometimes pretend they do?
Does love pretend too?

The tears have helped release the fears inside
They tell me I will find a love
And now I'm in a place where all the shades you are have been shown
And still here I am all alone

Does anybody really know who you are
Or do they sometimes pretend they do?
Does love pretend too?

Acércate una vez más, haz lo que quieras de mí
Y luego te puedes marchar

Necesito de alguien como tú
Que me enamore que atraviese mi cuerpo como tú
Muy dulce y suavemente tan intensamente
Necesito de alguien
Que me hable que me bese como tú

Necesito de alguien como tú para olvidarte
Que me bese los labios como tú",Alguien Como Tu,1998
Angela Carrasco,"Esa luz oscura
Ese mar, ese desierto
Ese fuego es el
Como un sol de hielo
Como infierno y cielo

Soy como su sombra
Se me escapa de las manos
Juega a ser infiel
Difícil quizá decía yo
A veces como un niño
Y yo muero por el

Mi hombre
No lo cambio por nada
Vale más nuestra guerra
Vale más su mirada
Porque

Mi hombre
No me cambia por nada
Y si hay en la tierra
Quien sepa amar a una mujer
Ese es el
Ese es mi hombre

Puede ser mentira
Puede ser una aventura
Todo puede ser
Y vuelvo a ser su amante
Amor de los de antes
No hay nadie como el

And the bells in the steeple too
And up in the nursery an absurd little bird
Is popping out to say ""cuckoo""

Cuckoo, cuckoo

Regretfully they tell us Cuckoo, cuckoo
But firmly they compel us Cuckoo, cuckoo
To say goodbye

Cuckoo!

To you

So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, good night
I hate to go and leave this pretty sight

So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, adieu
Adieu, adieu, to yieu and yieu and yieu

So long, farewell, au revoir, auf wiedersehen
I´d like to stay and taste my first champagne

So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, goodbye
I leave and heave a sigh and say goodbye

Angela Cartwright,"The hills are alive with the sound of music
With songs they have sung for a thousand years
The hills fill my heart with the sound of music
My heart wants to sing every song it hears

My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds
that rise from the lake to the trees
My heart wants to sigh like a chime that flies
from a church on a breeze
To laugh like a brook when it trips and falls over
stones on its way
To sing through the night like a lark who is learning to pray

I go to the hills when my heart is lonely
I know I will hear what I´ve heard before
My heart will be blessed with the sound of music
And I´ll sing once more",The Sound of Music,1965

A very good place to start
When you read you begin with A-be-see
When you sing you begin with do-re-mi

Do-re-mi, do-re-mi

Doe, a deer, a female deer
Ray, a drop of golden sun
Me, a name I call myself

Sew, a needle pulling thread
La, a note to follow Sew
Tea, a drink with jam and bread
That will bring us back to Do (oh-oh-oh)

Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do
So-do!

Now children, do-re-mi-fa-so and so on
are only the tools we use to build a song
Once you have these notes in your heads
you can sing a million different tunes by mixing them up
Like this

So Do La Fa Mi Do Re

Can you do that?

So Do La Fa Mi Do Re
So Do La Ti Do Re Do
So Do La Ti Do Re Do

Now, put it all together

So Do La Fa Mi Do Re, So Do La Ti Do Re Do

Good!

But it doesn´t mean anything

So we put in words
One word for every note
Like this

When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
Together!

When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Knows how to move can dance two-step

You're the one all the boys come to see

You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

With memories

There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere

I know that I'll soon go mad

I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize

So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep

To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet

With those blues on parade

I'd sacrifice anything come what might

Like a nightingale without a song to sing

When it isn't even spring?

Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

And dishes in the sink
Your side of the bed is cold
I haven't slept a wink
So I read your goodbye letter
To the face inside my drink
Lay me down and roll me out to sea

Got your picture in my wallet
And some pictures in my mind
A pocketful of memories
I never thought I'd find
And it's rainin' like a Monday
And the world seems so unkind

Angela Hunte,"See it was one of them days (yeah)
Like waking up in the stormy weather in your mind thinking
Oh, this could be so much better (I'm telling y'all)
I'll never forget her
Black leather down for whatever
My niggas sweat time
So we sitting in  this club
Where the ladies rub-a-dub
They solicitin' their love
Me and my man about as tight as you can get it
So he admitted that he wanted to hit it
I said now wait a minute, I can contest
To being bout as open-minded as it gets
When it comes to sex
Cause I believe in time and space and what a waste
If you can't really have your time and space
So what was the use?
But to swallow my pride to love and let loose of this feelin inside
Said if you want it that bad then you should have it
And then he smiled and said I want you to grab it

[Chorus]
True confessions of a broken heart
I learned my lesson now I'm torn apart
Everybody's got a story
About how they lost their one and only
True confessions of a broken heart
I learned my lesson now I'm torn apart
Everybody's got a story
About how they lost their one and only

I'm on the hunt to get my nigga what he wants
From back to front of the club
She's trying to pull a stunt
Even though they got the lights down low
I can see the whole dance floor
She must have slipped out the back door
Rather than going back empty handed
I know this ain't the way he planned it
I do as if commanded
Let's see who next be the finest
Who next be the best for sex
And messing with his Highness
So I took another look and guess who's back
I'm off the hook
It's the lady in black
Excuse me Miss, see that man sitting at the table
He wants to know
If you're ready willing and able
So she followed me and obviously
My man is gonna want a little privacy but I was wrong
He turned it up another notch
Asked if she went tongue to crotch
And said he wants to watch

[Chorus]

So now I'm thinking what have I done and gotten into?
Maybe this will be strong and maybe monumental
As I look in her eyes what is she gonna say?
Never thought I'd be in dismay when I woke up today
She said her thing ain't girls we in three different worlds
So he mentioned instead that he wanted some head
She obliged no menage then fled
We were straight for bout a month
Until pure lust were the topics we discussed
Though I didn't mind he wants it all the time
More women and all I've been in
Spreading venom and still want to be mine
So I told him one day can't do it any more
He reacts so relaxed
Said he's done with them for sure
Then I caught him one weekend
Cheating and creeping ducts leaking don't speak
I'll be leaving

The old folks their souls are cold like tenants
Tryin' to keep your weight up better eat that spinach
For four twenty-five niggas lives get diminished
The world serious, I'm tryin' to win a pennant
Cops be on patrol through the block every minute
Itchin' just to pop somethin', swearin' I'm a menace
They disturb me but it's love like tennis
Man, cap to the side and my jersey is vintage
Chicks'll make a nigga dick hard like a Guinness
Damn it's a scam but I handle my business
Tryin' to be the man if the Lord be my witness
Do my ? with the walk sign for my physical fitness

Easy now I'm seein' 'em, mind where you patrol
Fall back young'un, play your lane like a goal
When his majesty speaks, speech defy gravity
Blue tooth nigga but I don't have any cavities
Diddy got it wrapped like cocoons
Pop shit like needles through ? balloons
I urge you to tell a friend, warn a brother
About my splurges, merges with Warner Brothers
Thugs actin' funny cause chicks call me honey
See a 9 figure nigga makin' Bugs Bunny money
Eons beyond bling bling
So I chose to get engaged to these sweet 16's
Make a name, let it bang so beautiful
The theme music for crews that move pharmaceuticals
Or, suitable for, a recruit-able whore
To service the whole crew when we out on tour
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up

[Chorus]

It's like the music will literally stop time
(Hold up hold up hold up)
We roll up, 20 deep, cock D swoll up
Get inflicted by my verbal conviction
A Bad Boy but far from a Detroit Piston
You're not focused enough, you're not listenin'
You need to slow down, hold up like kickstand
Hop to it, get on your grind music
Across 110th sharp Caesar with a lime music
Fine-tuned with the proper soul seasoning
Your live shows are boring you're just not pleasin' 'em
Stop teasin' 'em you can't rock Palladium
We bring New York back like that West side stadium
Fuck the game and if the fame went away
Still be the hardest workin' man in entertainment today
Learn a lesson and that's, no questionin' that
No guesswork involved so stop stressin' the facts
Hold up

Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time

Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday

Angela Kaset,"First time he laid eyes on her he kissed his heart goodbye
He nearly drove right off the road, all she did was smile
But when she burned up their first dinner and lay cryin' on the couch
That's the moment that he fell in love from the inside out

She loved the way he always brought flowers to the door
He took her to new places that she'd never been before
When he lost his job and he lost his pride and his heart was filled with doubt
That's when she knew how much she loved that man from the inside out

From the inside love is stronger
Than the outside lookin' in
When the tears flow you learn what love's about
From the inside out

She has watched her raven hair slowly turn to gray
Since the day that he retired he just gets in the way
Well they ain't much to look at, two old faces in the crowd
But they could write the book of love from the inside out

From the inside love is stronger
Than the outside lookin' in

You gave me such a fright
I thought you was a ghost
Have a minute, can't you sit, sit you down, sit

All I meant is that I haven't seen a customer in weeks
Did you come in for a pie, sir?
Do forgive me if me head's a little vague
What was that?

But you'd think we had the plague
By the way the people keep avoiding
No you don't, heaven knows I try, sir
But there's no one even comes in to inhale
Right you was, would you like a drop of Ale?

Mind you, I can hardly blame them
These are probably the worst pies in London
I know why nobody cares to take them
I should know, I make 'em

The worst pies in London, even that's polite
The worst pies in London
If you dare to take a bite
Is that just disgusting?

You'll have to concede it
It's nothing but crusting
Her drink this, you'll need it
The worst pies in London

What it is, when you get it
Never thought I'd live to see the day
Men'd think it was a trick, finding poor animals
What are dying in the street

Mrs. Mooney has a pie shop
Does her business but I noticed something weird
Lately all her neighbors cats have disappeared
Have to hand it to her, what I calls enterprise
Poppin' pussies into pies

Wouldn't do in my shop
Just the thought of it's enough to make you sick
And I'm tellin' you them pussy cats is quick

No denying times is hard, sir
Even harder then the worst pies in London
Only lard and nothing more
Is that just revolting?

All greasy and gritty
It looks like it's molting
And tastes like
Well pity a woman alone
With limited wind and the worst pies in London

Somebody know me too well.
Somebody pull me up short,
And put me through hell,
And give me support,
For being alive.
Make me alive.

Mock me with praise.
Let me be used.

Yes, Mr. Todd!

Yes, all around!

No, y'see, the trouble with poet is

TODD: (spoken) Heavenly! 
Not as hearty as bishop, perhaps, 
But then again, not as bland as curate, either!

And good for business, too -- always leaves you wantin' more! 
Trouble is, we only get it on Sundays! 

Lawyer's rather nice.
TODD:
If it's for a price.

Well, then, if you're British and loyal, 
You might enjoy Royal Marine! 
Anyway, it's clean.
Though of course, it tastes of wherever it's been! 
TODD:
Is that squire, 
On the fire? 
LOVETT:
Mercy no, sir, look closer, 
You'll notice it's grocer!

Looks thicker, 
More like vicar! 
LOVETT:
No, it has to be grocer --
It's green!

The history of the world, my love --
LOVETT:
Save a lot of graves, 
Do a lot of relatives favors!

Here's the politician, so oily

Put it on a bun.
Well, you never know if it's going to run!

Fried, it's drier!

No, the clergy is really
Too coarse and too mealy!

Let my early retirement commence
Far from fools made of wax, I'll get down to brass tacks and relax
When I'm human again

So sweep the dust from the floor
Let's let some light in the room
I can feel, I can tell someone might break the spell any day now

Shine up the brass on the door
Alert the dust pail and broom
If it all goes as planned our time may be at hand any day now

Open the shutters and let in some air
Put these here and put those over there
Sweep up the years, the sadness and tears and throw them away

We'll be human again, only human again
When the girl finally sets us all free
Cheeks a-blooming again, we're assuming again
We'll resume our long-lost joie de vivre
We'll be playing again, holidaying again
And we're praying it's ASAP
We will push, we will shove
They will both fall in love
And we'll finally be human again

We'll be dancing again
We'll be twirling again
We'll be whirling around with such ease
When we're human again
Only human again
We'll go waltzing those old one-two-threes
We'll be floating again!
We'll be gliding again!
Stepping, striding as fine as you please
Like a real human does
I'll be all that I was
On that glorious morn
When we're finally reborn
And we're all of us human again",Human Again,2001

I have always had a bit of a knack for witchcraft 
Common spells and simple charms came naturally 
So when the war began, I conjured up a plan 
To do my bit in the national emergency

I enrolled in your Correspondence College of Witchcraft 
And I slaved at every lesson as it came.
But the spell I counted on, 
Is the lesson that is gone
It's disappeared, and you're the one to blame

Your suggestions are rash and your manner is brash 
And I've no time to waste, Mister Brown
If I am to proceed, it's that book that I need
Don’t let me down
But if you'll see me through 
I'll discuss it with you 
Though I've no taste for playing the clown 
If I meet with success, then I might acquiesce

I won't let you down

Love, love, love

Me and my friend we're walking in the cold light of mourning
Tears may blind the eyes but the soul is not deceived
In this world even winter ain't what it seems

Here come the blue skies, here comes springtime
When the rivers run high and the tears run dry
When everything that dies shall rise

Love, love, love
Is stronger than death
Love, love, love
Is stronger than death

In our lives we hunger for things we cannot touch
All the thoughts unuttered all the feelings unexpressed
Play upon our hearts like the mist upon our breath
But awoken by grief, our spirits speak

How could you believe that the life within the seed
That grew arms that reached and a heart that beat
And lips that smiled and eyes that cried could ever die?

Here come the blue skies, here comes springtime
When the rivers run high and the tears run dry
When everything that dies shall rise

Love, love, love
Is stronger than death
Love, love, love
Is stronger than death
Love, love, love
Is so much stronger than death

Eu vou te dizer
Mas vou duvidar
Querendo ou não
O meu coração
Já quer se entregar

Não falta lembrança
Aviso, cobrança
Você vai por mim
Mas feito criança
Lá vou na esperança
Eu sou mesmo assim

Quem sabe até meu destino
Amor sem espinhos
Sou mel da sua boca, calor dos abraços
E tantos beijinhos

Se o sonho acabou
Não sei meu amor
Nem quero saber
Só sei que ontem à noite
Sorrindo acordada
Sonhei com você

Às vezes até na vida é melhor
Ficar bem sozinho
Pra gente sentir qual é o valor
De um simples carinho

Te sinto no ar
Na brisa do mar
Eu quero te ver

Angela Via,"I wish we could
I wish we could
I wish we, I wish we

You know it's so unfair
This life sometimes
When it never lets me fulfill
The deepest desire I have inside

If we could disappear
And fly away to a paradise
A place where only you and I
To unleash this fantasy

Then I could love you every night
Hold you until the morning light
No one to say what's wrong or right
The way it has to be

Wish I could love you every night
Hold you until the morning light
No one to say what's wrong or right
Oh, how I wish, I wish we could be free

I'm living through this heart of mine
But I would let you come inside
'cause I was told it would be a crime
For us to share this love

But love is not a selfish need
Why if I take it must I bleed?
Or is that how it's meant to be
If only we could live inside my dreams

Then I could love you every night
Hold you until the morning light
No one to say what's wrong or right
The way it has to be

Wish I could love you every night
Hold you until the morning light
No one to say what's wrong or right
Oh, how I wish, I wish we could be free

Every night I wanna be with you
Doing all the things we wanna do
(Oh, baby)
A place for only you and me
To unleash these fantasies

Oh, how I wish I could be free with you
To do all the things I've dreamed to do, baby

Have my two front teeth

Through the city, play Monopoly with real cash
Me and Biggie and the models be, shaking they saditty ass
And Parada be, somethin' you cats got to see
And the watches be all types and shapes of stones
Bein' broke is childish and I'm quite grown
Run up in the club with the ice on, me and Paisan'
Scope the spot out, see somethin' nice and I'm gone
You cats is home, screamin' the fight's on
I'm in the fifteen hundred seats, watchin Ty-son
Same night, same fight
But one of us cats ain't playin' right, I let you tell it
People place yourselves in the shoes of two felons
And tell me you won't ball every chance you get
And any chance you hit, we live for the moment
Makes sense don't it?  Now make dollars
Cats pop bottles bone chicks that favor Idalis
And rack up frequent flier mileage

I love the dough, more than you know
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey

I'm poppin' Magnums while Jigga bag somethin'

Flights back and forth, pop corks of the best grapes
Make the best CD's and the best tapes
Don't forget the vinyl, take girls break spinals
Biggie be Richie like Lionel, shit
You seen the Jesus, dipped in H classes
Ice project off lights, chick flashes
Blind your broke asses, even got rocks in big mustaches
Rock top fashions
Ain't shit changed, except the number after the dot
On the Range, way niggas look at me now, kinda strange
I hate y'all too
Rather be in Carribean sands with Rachael
It's unreal, out the blue Frank White got sex appeal
Bitches used to go, ewww
Still tote steel, tryin' to see five mil
Off the sin-gle, for real
You ain't fazin' the amazin'
While your gun's raisin', mine is blazin'

Niggas skip the bull 'cause we matadors
Snatch the P89s that we pack in the drawers
And we clap the doors of your Acuras
Snap like cameras on amateurs

Jig and Big rock ice, no cracks or flaws
Everybody got a part to play, back to yours
Run up in your crib now, crack your doors
Watch the real players live, it's a habit to floss
Play the charts like The Beatles, y'all adapt you lost
And toast Cristal on behalf of y'all

Ain't too many as bad as yours truly
Do we, we laugh at y'all
Little bastards y'all

Roll shakers in Vegas, you can't break us

Now we buy homes in unfamiliar places

Turn my sorrow into treasured gold,
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown.

Stay in Detroit for almost five years
While the music industry melts the fuck down?
Do you know how many people lost their jobs
Because of your fuckin' vacation?
Well, that's actually why I'm here
I was gonna put out some new music
And I wanted to play it for you and get your opinion
Do I really need to hear it?
Let me guess, another album about: ""Poor me!
I'm so famous that it's ruined my rich little life
And I'm such a tortured artist, let me make music about it
And my tragic love life!"" Am I on to something here?
Come on, man, it's not like that
You know what? Just hand the fuckin' thing over!
I'm done talkin' to you!
Think you can just come and go as you please
Big selfish superstar?
Steve, I had a drug problem!
""Oh, poor me! I had a drug problem!""
Who hasn't had a drug problem in this town?
You know what? (*gun cocks*)
Hey! hey!
Just lay the shit down on my desk and get the fuck out!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Jesus Christ, man
Alright, alright, here, fine
What's this shit? Two CDs?
That's what I've been tryin' to tell you, man, there's two albums

Like a second flesh hot skin
Cling to my body

Gasping from the heat

That deranges every joint

As you give and I collect

And the word of madness and mystery

El fin estaba proximo de la humanidad
Puede esto ser sueÃ±o o realidad, no se

Sombras en la oscuridad!
Sombras en la oscuridad!

Almas endiabladas, seres sin piedad
Es la noche de satan!
Una extraÃ±a fuerza invade mi interior
Todo a cambiado en mi ser
Tengo la fuerza why tengo el poder lo se

Sombras en la oscuridad!
Sombras en la oscuridad!

Ya mi mente esta vacia
Nada puedo recordar
Estoy sediento de poder
Yo nada puedo hacer
Contra las fuerzas del mal
La profesia se cumplio!

Sombras en la oscuridad!
Sombras en la oscuridad!

And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand
For you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And the emptiness you felt
Will disappear

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

Lord knows
Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone
Tear them away
Hold on
There will be tomorrow
In time
You'll find the way

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you",I Must Have Jesus,2000
Angelics,"I am thinking of you
In my sleepless solitude tonight
If it's wrong to love you
Then my heart just won't let me be right
'Cause I've drowned in you
And I won't pull through
Without you by my side

I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight

Baby can you feel me
Imagining I'm looking in your eyes
I can see you clearly
Vividly emblazoned in my mind
And yet you're so far
Like a distant star
I'm wishing on tonight

I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on

Soon one morning
I'm gonna lay down my cross
Get me a crown
Soon one evening
Late in the evening
Late in the evening
I'm going home to live on high

Soon as my feet strike Zion
Lay down my heavy burdens
Put on my robe in Glory
Goin' home one day and tell my story
I been climbing over hills and mountains
Gonna drink from the Christian fountain
You know all of God's sons and daughters that morning
Will be drinking that old healing water
And we gonna live on forever
We gonna live on forever
We gonna live on up in Glory after while

I'm goin' out sight-seeing in Beulah
March all around God's alter
Gonna walk and never get tired
Gonna fly, Lord, and never falter
I'm gonna move up a little higher
Gonna meet old man Daniel
I'm gonna move up a little higher
Gonna meet the Hebrew children
I'm gonna move up a little higher
Gonna meet Paul and Silas
I'm gonna move on up a little higher
Gonna meet my friends and kindred
I'm gonna move on up a little higher
Gonna meet my loving mother
I'm gonna move on up a little higher
Gonna meet that Lily of the Valley
I'm gonna feast with the Rose of Sharon

It will be always howdy howdy
It will be always howdy howdy

Will you be there somewhere 'round God's alter?
Will you be there, oh, when the angels shall call God's roll?
God knows I'll be waiting, hmm
Yes, I'll be watching somewhere 'round God's alter
Well, I'll be waiting, oh, at the beautiful, yes, golden gates

Well, well, soon as my feet strike Zion
Gonna lay down my heavy burdens
Gonna put on my robe in Glory
I'm going home one day, tell my story

Angelika Milster,"Ihr werdet es nicht sofort verstehn
Dass ich mich so nach eurer Liebe sehn
Doch in diesem Moment schau ich dankbar zurück
Ich bin die selbe
Die ich einst war
Und ich sage euch gleich
Zwar trage ich Seide und Samt
Doch ich bleibe eine von euch

Mir war bestimmt vom Schicksal den Weg zu gehn
Nein, ich wollte nicht nur im Schatten stehn
Und auf andere sehn, die sich sonnten im Glück
Ich wollte frei sein

Und spielte ihr Spiel
Doch nichts hat mich jemals beirrt
Und niemals vergaß ich mein Ziel

Ich habe dich nie verlassen
In schweren Zeiten

Lass einen Platz mir

Wenn ich auch Reichtum und Ruhm erwarb
Es kam mir darauf niemals an
Mag die Welt von mir denken was immer sie will
Macht, Geld und Namen
Was leigt schon daran wenn ich all das verlier
Solange nur eines mir bleibt
Die Liebe des Volkes zu mir

Wein nicht um mich Argentinien
Ich habe dich nie verlassen
In schweren Zeiten
Trotz Leid und Schmerzen
Lass einen Platz mir

Angelina,"Ohh I want to let you know 
That I'll always love you baby

Sometime I think about 
Everything that we've been through 
And I pray that you would just open your eyes 
I love you I need you 
So please don't throw our love away 

Since the day you and I snuck away to be alone
I knew from that night something special went on
It must have been the first kiss 
You told me that no one else in the world made you feel this 

I felt the same way too but nothing stays the same
I'm sorry for the tears I'm sorry for the pain 
You were the one that always made things right 
I promise you this though you got a friend for life

Maybe one day we can try it again 
And maybe things can be a little different 
So lets just kiss and say goodbye 
'Cause I really can't stand the pain of seeing you cry

I've given everything 
I loved you endlessly 
But when it comes to me 
You don't even notice me 

I've given everything 
I loved you endlessly 
But when it comes to me 
You don't even notice me

All that's mine is yours that's what I said 
Treat you with love and respect in everyway 
You wanted I gave you need me I was there 
Now you treat like if I'm not here 

I love you and I need you don't want to let go 
If you want somebody else please let me know 
Can't take it no more I feel in dying inside 
Is this the price I pay for handing you my life? 

I know I'm not prefect but I truly cared 
So when you wake up one morning and I'm not there 
Just remember I loved you it will never be the same 
Gave you everything and you threw it all away

I've given everything 
I loved you endlessly 
But when it comes to me 
You don't even notice me 
I've given everything 
I loved you endlessly 
But when it comes to me 
You don't even notice me [Repeat: x 2]

I gave you my good and my bad 
My heart and my soul, 
My trust my money my time, 
What more can you ask from a man 

Even when times are hard 
I held out my arms and held you 
Even excepted you though whatever weather
But now I feel it we're at the end of the rope 

Whatever we had now I gotta let go 
Nights like this I wish raindrops would fall 
To cover my tears 
Wishing I could replace all those wasted years 

Of loving someone who couldn't love me back
And now again I gotta start from scratch 
But I know I've given you my everything 

I've given everything 
I loved you endlessly

You mean the world to me
Baby baby baby babe
You know I love you (uh huh Come on yea yea)
And I want to be together when you runaway (Its NB Ryders)
Just me and you (Same Klick new title)
Just you and me
Will you runaway with me

The day I wrote these words for you I cried
Could of died that day a happy and complete man
'cause in the palm of my hands
Everything that I dreamed for and more
And you know I'm down for yours
Forever and life the reason I made you my wife is because
You see me for me the real me and love me unconditionally
And even with the circumstances that I had you still gave me a chance
And that's why I live and breathe for you and the kids
And you give me more than what this thing could ever give to me
And now my life is satisfied and complete visions all coming true
Yea of me and you placing rings on each others fingers saying ""I do""
You stuck with me through my thick and my thin to go back and live life over again
Nah this is my destiny it was worth the agony to get the ecstasy.

We can runaway and spend some time
I'll always be the one right by your side
Tell the whole world you belong to me
You are my everything
I want to run away with you
do do do do do do do do

I never ever met a shorty that was quite like you
And even tho it was wrong I fell in love with you
Now we sit here not really knowing what to do
But I'm sure that you know I'll give the world for you
If I could runaway with you I wouldn't even think twice
I promise girl I'll put it all on the line
I know forever seems to be a long time
But that's what I'm seeing when I look into your eyes
And it don't matter what your friends might say
'cause I know deep inside you feel the same way
You could tell me what you want but I could read your mind
So quit lying to yourself and put hand mine
I get excited everytime you come close
And being right here with you is what I love the most
So any time your feeling lonely inside
We could runaway together and leave this world behind

We can runaway and spend some time
I'll always be the one right by your side
Tell the whole world you belong to me
You are my everything
I want to run away with you
do do do do do do do do

Waking up in the morning and your still not there
Can't we runaway and escape somewhere
Missing your soft touch your lips next to mine
Holdin up your hands as you look in my eyes
What must of happened to the love we both felt inside
Emotions were strong and the feeling was right
Now we don't speak anymore you went your own way
And that's what loves about then I was meant left
Go ahead and take your time if that's what you need
My loves for you forever my heart for you bleeds
Things happen for a reason so I ask my self should I be strong
And wait or move on to some one else
I know you still love me I could feel it inside
You always kept it real no games no lies
If your ever feelin lonely feel the need to get away
Call me up I'll be there together we'll run away girl

Angelina,"We've known each other for so long 
You're a friend I don't want to compromise 
But you reassure my insecurities 
Through all my nervousness inside 

You softly squeeze my hand and 
Say everything's okay 
And that there's no reason to be scared 

Over and over you tell me how much you care for me 
And over and over you hold me like lovers do 
Now over and over I wonder when the morning comes 
Will you still be here? 

As I lay beside you 
With a quivered look on my face 
Was this real or was I fooling myself? 
Did I make a mistake? 

As you gently sleep 
All I can do is stare 
When the sun breaks through, what will you do? 

Over and over you tell me how much you care for me 
And over and over you hold me like lovers do 
Now over and over I wonder when the morning comes 
Will you still be here? 

When you wake, will you still feel the same? 
Please don't make me feel like this was all in vain 
'Cause I've given you my precious love 
I gave you all I had

Tears are falling from my eyes, 
And I can't find the reasons why. 
Tears are falling from my eyes, 
My eyes, tears are falling. 

Tears are falling from my eyes, 
And I can't find the reasons why. 
Tears are falling from my eyes, my eyes, my eyes. 

I ask myself how could this be that you walked out on me? 
Now here I am, 
Alone again, 'cause you abandoned me. 
I'll never show it. 
I smile all day to try to hide the pain. 
Seems like I'm happy and that I wouldn't have it any other way. 

Chorus 

And what about the love we shared 
And all the memories? 
With innocence, 
I thought you'd love me for eternity. 
I should've seen it, 
I can't believe you played me with your selfish game. 

My heart is healin' so now 
You better know I won't be fooled again.

En segiendote, este dolor nunca imagine. 
Why lastimandome, recuerdos que nunca olvidare. 
Sueno en tus brazos why en despertar, 
Empiezo a llorar. 
Pero voy descubriendo que tengo fuerzo en mi why soy mejor sin ti.

I drank too much last night, got bills to pay, my head just feels in pain

waiting for ye.

To sing whenever the world falls apart.

Follow it over the hill and stream.
Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.
Follow the fellow, follow the fellow,
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.

'Twas a sumptuous gift bequeathed to a child.
Oh, the lure of that song 
Kept her feet running wild.
For you never grow old and you never stand still
With a whippoorwill singing beyond the next hill.

So, I bundled me heart and I roamed the world free.
To the east with the lark
Tow the west with the sea.

Since the day you and I snuck away to be alone
I knew from that night something special went on
It must have been the first kiss

I felt the same way too but nothing stays the same

I love you and I need you don't want to let go

Can't take it no more I feel in dying inside 
Is this the price I pay for handing you my life?

Whatever we had now I gotta let go 
Nights like this I wish raindrops would fall 
To cover my tears 
Wishing I could replace all those wasted years 

Of loving someone who couldn't love me back
And now again I gotta start from scratch 
But I know I've given you my everything 

I've given everything 
I loved you endlessly 
But when it comes to me 
You don't even notice me 

I've given everything 
I loved you endlessly 
But when it comes to me 
You don't even notice me",Notice Me,2004
Angelina,"Desde el día que te conocí
Yo sabia que eres un ángel del cielo

Cada vez que estamos juntos
Se me llena el corazon
Eres tu mi alegría
y tu sonrisa es mi sol
Cada vez que estamos juntos
Yo me siento tan feliz
Porque el sol y las estrellas me acercaron a ti

Despertando en la mañana pensando en ti
Tus brazos y besos los quiero sentir
Yo te quiero, y te amo, que haría sin ti?
Un ángel que Dios me enviado a mi
Me ensenaste amar mi razón por vivir
Prometo ser fiel y estaremos feliz
Tu ya sabes que conmigo sola nunca estarás
Mi corazon te pertenece nunca mas lloraras
Eres toda mi vida, mi mujer especial
sonrisa mas bella, días haces brillar
No hay nada en este mundo que no haría por ti
No te olvides yo te quiero, contigo quiero morir

Tu eres toda mi vida
Mi consentido
Ya no quiero estar sin ti

Tu eres toda mi vida
Mi consentido
Ya no quiero estar sin ti

Ya no quiero vivir sin ti a mi lado
Eres el amor que siempre a buscado
Por eso mismo  te mando esta canción
Para decirte que te entrego mi amor
Quiero que sepas todo lo que siento por ti
Si no estas en mis brazos, no soy feliz
Cada minuto, de cada hora, de cada día
Quiero que siempre seas mía
y cuando llegue la noche te voy a amar
Besando tu cuerpo, no quiero parar
Porque eres mi reina princesa de amor
La única, la dueña de mi corazon

Final mi reina a mi lado  te amo y te lo digo
quiero ser tu esposo, tu mejor amigo
la boda mas bella, tenderas tu Castillo
me tienes a tus pies, te entrego este anillo
dime que me amas y estarás conmigo
brindaremos nuestro amor y el futuro contigo
bailaremos en la noche brillaras como una estrella
honesto cuando digo eres tu la mas bella
me abrazas y me besas con tanto cariño
el día que te mire , halle mi destino
juntos para siempre haré todo por ti
yo se que tu me amas y confías en mi",Tu Eres,2004

Après quelques années
Les hommes ont remplacé tes poupées

Don't understand

And the only thing we know
Is things don't always go
The way we planned

When it seems all your dreams come undone

We are more than we are
We are one

If there's so much I must be
Can I still just be me
The way I am?

Can I trust in my own heart
Or am I just one part
Of some big plan?

Your journey has only begun

Is our pride, deep inside
We are one

Family, family, we are one
Family, family, we are one

One family under the sun

You will find when you see
We are one

This is not a film
This is my song
Now pick up your shovel and
Dig
I don't want to bring your Gods down babe
I don't want to bring your Gods down babe
Their flesh and blood for you too real
The wine that flows from their nostrils
Too red
Their master strokes too fundamental
Their saint soaked cathedrals too done
I don't want to bring your Gods down babe
I don't want to bring your Gods down babe
The ferocity of their cat claws too steel
And we the weak kneed weeds of their
Weaker breed never paused to feel
We're not the masters of the land we survey
But I guess you'd come to that conclusion
When you're ready in your own time anyway
I don't want to bring your Gods down babe
I don't want to bring your Gods down babe
Because their armour and their crest cuts too deep
And the cold landcliffs where they rest are far too steep
But I just wanna say to you that like your
Gods, your guilt and your beliefs I too wanna be
With you 'til the very end babe

Days pass and this emptiness fills my heart
When I want to run away
I drive off in my car
But whichever way I go
I come back to the place you are

And the grand facade, so soon will burn
Without a noise, without my pride
I reach out from the inside

In your eyes
The light the heat
In your eyes
I am complete
In your eyes
I see the doorway to a thousand churches
In your eyes
The resolution of all the fruitless searches
In your eyes
I see the light and the heat
In your eyes
Oh, I want to be that complete
I want to touch the light
The heat I see in your eyes

Love, I don't like to see so much pain
So much wasted and this moment keeps slipping away
I get so tired of working so hard for our survival
I look to the time with you to keep me awake and alive

And all my instincts, they return
And the grand facade, so soon will burn
Without a noise, without my pride
I reach out from the inside

From this dark cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here

You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here

Angelisa,"Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa men have named you
You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only cause you're lonely they have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile
Do you smile to tempt a lover Mona Lisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art.

It's Paradise
This is where the hungry come to feed
For mine is a generation that circles the globe
in search of something we haven't tried before
So never refuse an invitation
Never resist the unfamiliar
Never fail to be polite
and never outstay your welcome

Just keep your mind open and suck in the experience
And if it hurts, you know what it's probably worth it

You hope and you dream
But you never believe that
something is going to happen for you
Not like it does in the movies
And when it actually does
You expect it to feel different
More visceral
More real
I was waiting for it to hit me

I still believe in paradise
But now at least i know it's not some place you can look for

Gave me Dinah; 
I'm the proudest one 
Beneath the Dixie sun.

'Bout our weddin'; 
I hear church bells ringin', 
Here's the song my heart keeps singin': 

Dinah, 
Is there anyone finer 
In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her! 

Dinah, 
With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

Angelo Debarre,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows

You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

I sit in my chair
And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love

Angelo Debarre,"Clouds are only dewdrops that once kissed a rose
Clouds are feathers from a lady's fan
Do you remember how we watched them drifting by
Long ago when love began
 
Clouds floating thru the night 
While the silver stars above
Lend their tender light 
Clouds drifting thru the sky
While I wonder why my love ever said goodbye
The night was young
The breeze was warm and tender
A fool was I but how was I to know
I gladly gave my heart in sweet surrender
To learn that love was meant to come and go 
Like snowhite clouds floating through the night 
Speaking of a love that was heavenly 
A love that could never be mine
 
Once we were together and now we're apart
Did you find it easy to forget?
I keep on dreaming while the years go drifting by
Calling you my ""Sweet Regret""

Angelo Verploegen,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

For love that can, not live yet never dies.

You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love is,2012

Their knees in the sand

Your smile is gone, I noticed it bad
The secret's if you let in just a little more love
I promise you this, a little's enough",A Little's Enough,2006
Angels & Airwaves,"The ash set in then blew away
It's getting lost into the sea
I grew so close to all the thoughts I had, to leave forever
I left the chill and voice, the screams in kids, and ran for shelter

You know I won't say sorry
Do you know I won't say sorry? 
The pain has a bad reaction
A blend of fear and passion
Do you know what it's like to believe? 
It makes me wanna scream

I see a glow from far away
A faint reflection on the sea
I left some words quite far from here to be a sure reminder
I laid them out in stone in case they need to last forever

You know I won't say sorry
Do you know I won't say sorry? 
The pain has a bad reaction
A blend of fear and passion
Do you know what it's like to believe? 
It makes me wanna scream

I see the stars, they're in your eyes
A playful kiss kept undecided
I'm fast asleep in the nick of time
You lost your wish, I can't help you find it
I'm on my knees to sworn the start
A fresh new start to be undecided

If love's the word, that you say 
You say it, I will listen",Start the Machine,2006
Angels & Airwaves,"Anybody out there? 

Building up the pain, it's ready to go 
The rocket has launched, where will it go? 
And what will it be, and what will we do 
The match has sparked a fire anew 
And what will we do 

Valkyrie missile, packed and away 
Something is coming, but I can't say 
She knows I know, and I know it too 
Surprise, here it is, we were waiting for you 

Take a chance, 'cause I know you want to 
Let me kiss you, and let me save you 
Let me end your eternal fear 
Let me take you far away from here 

Cocked and loaded, ready to go 
No one knows what happens when it goes 
One by one, the rockets fly 
Soaring into the February sky 

Take a chance, 'cause I know you want to 
Let me kiss you, and let me save you 
Let me end your eternal fear 
Let me take you far away from here

Angels & Airwaves,"The ocean is on fire, the sky turned dark again as the boats came in
And the beaches, streched out with soldiers
With their arms and guns it has just begun

Believe
You want this
Believe
I want this too

Why won't you tell me that
It's almost over
Why must this tear my head
Inside out

And the houses laid out like targets
With the deafening sound
We watched them all go down
And the families now useless bodies
They lay still black and blue
A gift from us to you

Believe,
You want this
Believe,
I want this too

Why won't you tell me that
It's almost over
Why must this tear my head
Inside out

Believe
Believe
You want this too

Why won't you tell me that
It's almost over
Why must this tear my head
Inside out

Why won't you tell me that
It's almost over
Why must this tear my head
Inside out",The War,2006
