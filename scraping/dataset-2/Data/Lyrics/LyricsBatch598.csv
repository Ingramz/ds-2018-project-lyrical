Lil Wayne,"Ah, young Nino, fuck a bitch in a pea coat
Carlito, Scarface, Al Pacino
Bun B though, Pimp C, R.I.P though
I goes deep in that pussy, Dan Marino
She wanna be the one, fuck her to my own single
Break a bitch heart, no future Miss Cleo
Snapback, au-au-automatic reload
Flyer than a fucking beetle, you can’t beat ‘em
Vampire fuck up your evening
I pop up and eat lunch, leave you in the cement
Don’t believe it, stripe like A-fucking-didas
The gun Selena, give a nigga Bieber fever
Real fucking hot, put it in park take a shot, higher than a tube sock
You's a bop, give me top top, as I load the guap
Man these niggas say I’m fly but to her I’m God

I’m faded faded faded
My nigga I’m faded faded faded

My nigga I’m faded faded faded
My nigga I’m faded faded

And I don’t give a fuck
Fuck is up, nigga’s stomping in my Chucks
Yeah I make it reindeer, cause I’m all about my bucks
Use the butt up in the front, dick up in her cunt
And I put it in her hole, hole in one, putt putt ergh
S-Super McNasty, why you McLovin
When the bitch call me daddy
Pimp, no Caddy, she wish she never had me
Treat her like a dog, called the bitch Lassie
Young savvy, bang her like Cincinnati
Above average, f-fly like I’m Aladdin
They bend backwards, th-throw the pussy at them
I’m Ben Wallace, dunk up in your basket
Balls in the air, no games, I’m serious, double dare
There’s too many bitches, why these niggas wanna stare
Pat Ron up in here, nigga this ain’t no beer

I’m faded faded faded
My nigga I’m faded faded faded
My nigga I’m faded faded faded
My nigga I’m faded faded faded
My nigga I’m faded faded faded
My nigga I’m faded faded faded
My nigga I’m faded faded faded
My nigga I’m faded faded
And I don’t give a fuck

Mama, there go that monster
Abracadabra, Magic Johnson
My motherfucking doctor said I need a doctor
So I called House, now I am a pill popper
Faded like skinny's, Young Money we winning
I told her if I change, she won’t get a penny
Milking this shit, pregnant bitch titties
Bringing home the bacon, I’m fucking Miss Piggy
Loaded like a semi, sen' me naked pictures
She knows my dick, she call that nigga Richard
Prior to me coming, I had to stick my thumb in
Her ass one time, smell my finger make you vomit
Flyer than a hornet, the shoe fit I worn it
She tried to jack me off, can’t beat it, join it
Tunechi, coochie, that what she call it
Flag scarlet, I killed it, mournin'

I’m faded faded faded
My nigga I’m faded faded faded
My nigga I’m faded faded faded
My nigga I’m faded faded faded
My nigga I’m faded faded faded
My nigga I’m faded faded faded
My nigga I’m faded faded faded

Lil Wayne,"Hello world, my name is not important
Today is about Tyga yezzir!
Yeah, lets go
I'ma sit back and smoke, I might grab my guitar

I got these bullets in the chamber
Don't make me let off a round
If my life's in danger
I'm gonna lay ya down, lay ya down
Your life's in my chamber
Don't make me let off a round
If my life's in danger
I'm gonna lay you down

I ain't a killer but don't push me
Homie soft shit I'm in you niggas is pussy
Hard head, from a city where really you blue or all red
Like when it pop off better play dead
Same day catch me on some different shit
Front yard posted on some prison shit
Uh, even as a kid fight until you win
Life is kill or be killed, yeah

I got these bullets in the chamber
Don't make me let off a round
If my life's in danger
I'm gonna lay ya down, lay ya down
Your life's in my chamber
Don't make me let off a round
If my life's in danger
I'm gonna lay you down
Lay you down

Yeah, so like I said
Or better yet like he said

I like to floss so mama tell me be cautious
She know the cost, she tell me death ain't option
Too many lives lost, shootout on the boulevard
Guns drawn, pick a car, lucky me, I wasn't home
Damn, I hope it wasn't one of my homies dog
His family called, I ain't even hear my phone
Now I'm looking for revenge, swerving on this road
If I should die and never wake
I pray the lord take my soul
She already know

I got these bullets in the chamber
Don't make me let off a round
If my life's in danger
I'm gonna lay ya down, lay ya down
Your life's in my chamber
Don't make me let off a round
If my life's in danger
I'm gonna lay you down
Lay you down

I got these bullets in the chamber
Don't make me let off a round
If my life's in danger
I'm gonna lay ya down, lay ya down
Your life's in my chamber
Don't make me let off a round
If my life's in danger
I'm gonna lay you down
Lay you down

Yeah, so like I said
Or better yet like he said
Ya heard me better make me love ya baby, ah emm

Reporting live from the barrel
2 tear drops under that eye on the Sparrow
I'm from the small place they call uptown
Where we lay you, where we lay you down
Like concrete in the driveway shoot sideways
Like O-Dog on Menace
Leave you brains in yo' Tennis
I'm tha Renaissance man
So put me in the book and I got my pistol on the hook, sing'

I got these bullets in the chamber
Don't make me let off a round
If my life's in danger
I'm gonna lay ya down, lay ya down
Your life's in my chamber
Don't make me let off a round
If my life's in danger
I'm gonna lay you down
Lay you down

When I say ""fuck ya'll""
I really mean mammy mother-fuck all ya'll

Lil Wayne,"Young Moolah baby
Happy music, happy people
Happy people
Everything is alright
Everything is alright

[Chorus]
Pop a bottle and celebrate
We made it to a new day
Pop a bottle and celebrate
We done made it to a new day
Oh I take a hit and just elevate
'Cause today will be a good day
I got my mind right, money right, ready for war

Hey! - blow the horns on 'em
The sun is out, it's a brand new day and it just dawned on 'em
The smoke in here got 'em floating just like in salt water
And break is fast, we got it cooking just like a short order
Go feed the hands birds cover the cheetah print
A jungle out there and the jail is the zoo that keep us in
Players in gators is crazy, we feel the need to rock 'em
Furs coming in all different colors like PETA got 'em
Killing yourself for a salary
Look ya line flatter than stomachs of the women that's running, watching them calories
Hope that we linking, we smoking and drinking casually
'Cause life without living ain't nothing but a fallacy

[Chorus]

Say, who's that peekin' in my window?
Is that sunshine? Is that one time?
Let that sun shine through my living room
Hospitality is what I'm giving you
Harsh reality is what I've been through
But I'm not alone, ask her and him too
And they shall tell ya, ain't nothin' better
Than the smell of a new day
I know the ocean runs dry and the sky gets dark
And ya don't see what He's trying to show ya
And I know the wall may seem tall
But if we help each other I guarantee we get over
And once I'm over, I'll reach back for my brother
And pull him over as well
Keep our heads high and our noses wide open
Hopin' for that new day smell

[Chorus]

Yea homie, I been? since I was 16
To tell 'em what I'm 'bout to tell 'em
So I need more than a 16
See I'm the only son of Mary and Joe
So I gotta fulfill my purpose 'fore I'm buried, ya know
My momma say she having visions of me being a missionary
And the hood looking at me as a walking visionary
So I sit back and wonder will I ever have my time to shine
And die like Pac in his prime
Or will I go out like Len Bias and OD before the tryouts
No teller no reaper no buyout
I'm good, I pray for a head to protect ya
And I gotta walk the streets with the heat as my protection
Still gotta watch my back, still watch my front home
'Cause I seen a lot of n-ggas die with they gun on
So with that in mind, I just get higher
And pray to the higher Messiah, I'm no liar
And they say that puffing the fire f-cks with your memory
But I got a lot of stuff that I don't wan' remember see
Like when my homie ivin died
I like how I never seen a man cry 'til I seen Lance died
Never seen my pops cry 'til I seen my Grams died
And I'm here to tell him that I miss my Grams too
And I wish I could hug her for mothers day too
And I feel the same way that you do
But we gotta still move on so she can just smile down on us
And I don't want the Lord to ever frown down on us
I know that they really got power in a gun
But I also know that they got power in a tongue
So every time I speak, look I try to speak life
Y'all tweaking for broads, I tweak life
They said I was s'posed to die as a fetus
My momma said I bind that Devil in the name of Jesus
So now I'm here just to talk to y'all
Come and stroll with me homie, let me walk wit' y'all
Ten million ways to die so I chose
To get my life right by the end of the road
'Fore my body in a casket and I'm stiff and froze
'Fore I'm laying in a morgue with a tag on my toes
I'm here to tell you take heed to the warnings
School shootings, hurricanes, and global warming
Open ya Bibles up with no hesitation
BC was the Genesis, this is Revelations
So you better pick your destination
Tomorrow ain't promised, better pick your destination
Rest in peace B Spencer, rest in peace?
Shit could be worse so I'm feeling like Weezy
I wake up in the morning, take a piss, and wash my hands
Take a knee and thank the Man and leave my life in God's hands, yea!

Lil Wayne,"Here we are, we are the champions
We've come so far, they said it can't be done
And we right here, and we still number one
Still number one, still number one
So here we are, we are the champions

Check it, always had big hopes as a kid
Just a rotten tomato building shit out of Legos
Can't hit the ball if you ain't swingin' the bat
And like a home run, that boy is not coming back
Rise like creams, kid with a dream
Went from never seeing straight to the face on a magazine
Now my team got anthems
Y'all frozen, a cold hook from the champion

Here we are, we are the champions (YMCMB)

And we right here, and we still number one
Still number one, still number one
So here we are, we are the champions

You know you gotta be strong to survive
When everyone's trying to break you
So let ‘'em hate, just go your own way
Don't ever let ‘'em try and change you
I walk alone through the fire to the throne
I find myself in the dark, I close my eyes and there you are

Here we are, we are the champions
We've come so far, they said it can't be done
And we right here, and we still number one (yeah)

Sunny days, rainy nights on them global flights
Yeah, the like father, like son struggle
Mo' muscle, gun bussa, we flip digits
TRUK fitted, go get it
Ship it 'cause it's bigger than life

Here we are, we are the champions
We've come so far, they said it can't be done
And we right here, and we still number one
Still number one, still number one
So here we are, we are the champions (yeah)

Uh, number one in this motherfucker
Lil Weezy fuck the world with two dicks
But in the meantime I'mma have a nice time
Went from a con artist to an icon
Got the keys to success on my key ring
Used to dream about sugar, sweet dreams
But reality is a bitch and she my bitch
Sold my soul to the devil, made a profit
Tunechi

Here we are, we are the champions (yeah, ha ha)
We've come so far, they said it can't be done (pour some Gatorade on it)

Let’s hit the Roscoe’s on Pico, I’m in a hood mood
I'm sittin’ here thinkin’ ‘bout all the things I could do
So what you should do is
Play your position for Berkin bags, we poppin’ tags
Her shoe game sick, we drinkin’ Ace out of Red Bottles
True gang shit, fuck with me and you’re famous
Kanye'd my bitch, now she’s away from the nameless
Camera flashes from strangers, turn a Range to a manger
Jesus piece on the plate, yea my baby an angel
Fell straight up out of Heaven into what we into
Who knew we’d grew into, whatever we into
That’s too much for your mental so we snapback that
Game on point like the stripes on my Gucc' backpack
My ladybug, yea she cool like that
In them Trues, why you move like that

You know my lady always on
She know I need it so
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that
My lady got me going
I’m where she already knows
She knows she can get
All that, all that, all that

Uh, you my lady
And that pussy feel like a haven
We can make babies, let’s be creative
She say leave them tricks alone but I’m a skater
I love her like her daddy, told her no man would
I got a lot of bad bitches, she the only one good
I got her flowers for nothing, she smiling and blushing
If I don’t answer my phone, then we probably fucking, ya
She love my tattoos
Ain’t got no room for her name but I’mma make room
She let her hair down, we have a stare down
She said “I’m glad you ate it, where my cap & gown?”
Told her “I can be your chauffeur,” dick like a limo
Multiple orgasms, that’s my M.O

Look, my girl’s sweet like my hotel floor
From where they ran through more keys than a hotel door
Indeed, give her the D now the whole hotel know
Feel like I’m looking down from Heaven screaming “Oh, Hell no!”
When you hop on top, girl, that’s what it feel like
She always had a player back like them field lights
And every time I left it ain’t feel right
Cheated on her and she stayed, that’s just real life
Cause it’s hard when you ain’t on the same coast
Burning bread in the club so all these girls want toast
Hoes try and wave but we ain’t on the same boat
They trying to sink everything that we made float
She told me ‘bout her ex man, her old boy stories
And how she had a dildo, you know, toy stories
Don’t fuck her on her period, ain’t into horror stories
I take her to my favourite restaurant she order for me, cause she know me

You know my lady always on
She know I need it so

Best friend is a dyke, they fucked around a few times
Her and her momma alike, so all they do is fight

I tell that bitch “you crazy, fuck wrong with you?”
And excuse my French, but I’m a long kisser
And then she try to tell me I’m the only one that’s hitting
And I say “what about them niggas?” She say: “what about them niggas?”

So if I add some more stress, I just don't see how I'm a cope
I think they underestimate the grind
I do, bring this dough, and I'm only 20 years old
I wonder why I sip this devil juice
Cause it feel incredible, problems, I got several
Thank God that none of that medical
Ugh, I've been blessed with much to be expected

What am I doing here?
I wonder what am I doing here
What am I doing here
What am I doing here

I hope this feelin' lasts for fuckin' ever
I don't want to come back down, let me stay above the ground
I hope I do what I was meant to do
Cause I've been searchin' for that answer, I just hope I get it now
Please, let me find euphoria
When you up above the clouds, like, who goin' to touch me now
And do we ever get to know the truth?
Cause everyone seems to have it, but to me it seems they lack it
Now I'm rollin' and I'm sippin' lean
Sometimes I catch a buzz just to help me picture love
Drinkin' liquor and I'm smokin' weed
And you don't ever do too much if you could never do enough
Wonder why it's me instead of you
I'll be there to rescue you, problems you got several
Thank God that none of that medical
Ugh, I've been blessed with much to be expected

Phone in her back pocket made her booty call

But anyway, what you doing
I said nothing
She said I know what you should be doing
And could be doing
Open up your legs

Okay I'm straight at you, no ricochet

I fuck with real riders and they tickets paid
For them dead presidents we will start digging graves
I swear my momma trust my work, so I give these hoes that work
They say the best things in life are free
That's why it cost for you to get get murked
And my pants saggin like fuck it, I'm still on my business
Spent my birthday in jail, I was making bad decisions
Saw my enemy at the light, shot him up before it turned green
Mane my niggas got them birds, you ain't even got bird seeds
Your bitch ride me like a go kart, I play that pussy like Mozart
I Mozart these hoes hearts then after that they worthless

I'll blind him, him and whoever cosign him
I get Adam like Yolonda

Its fuck the world, no condom
If he twisted, I'll unwind him
And this pistol came with a silence

But I swear to God he heard it!
Yea, and I swear to God I ain't nervous

I milk this shit like cattle, that's my word like Scrabble
And yo main girl is a ho, I go Wayne's World in her throat

I'm so fuckin' hot I sssssss I'ma need some more S's
Man I'm on some other shit, I want another bitch
That want another bitch, and I don't cuddle bitch
I hit her with that shovel dick, I got in that pussy and dug a ditch
Some people gotta punch the clock, man I rather punch a brick
'Cause I'm that nigga, and I'm so cold I just shivered

My skin crawlin', my walls talkin', the pictures in here lookin' at me
The ground movin', I'm seeing shit, I'm blowing like I'm stuck in traffic
I'm smoking on that strong, got me coughing like I'm getting buried
I've been fucking Mary-Jane, I knew her when she was just Virgin Mary
I'm stoned, Mick Jagger, I can run around Saturn
Eyes rolling back and keep blinking like hazards
I said king me, king me with my mushroom crown on
I graduated to better drugs, my cap and gown on
Don't knock me off my high horse, what I do is my choice
I'm high as the scoreboard, bitch look up at my points
I'm trippin' out, cotton mouth, I got high and fell asleep loaded

I don't know if I'm coming or going, T, make my blunt a Samoan
And I see lights flashing, life passing, take a bitch home and fuck like rabbits
Styrofoam cups and wine glasses, shot glasses, hot flashes
My tongues numb, I can't talk, no balance, my spine hurts
My mind surf, my eye jerks, I try different drugs, I'm diverse
Goodbye Earth, farewell, high as heaven, eyes low as hell
Keep scratching, keep biting my nails Keep lighting an L, I'm a kite in the air
I like weed brownies and cookies, I'm straight but seeing crooked
I got my trippy kit, I hope I trip and fall in some pussy

All I need is Mary, let the models do the coke
Tryna' get some Becky in the backseat of the ghost
Hit the weed man, tell him that I need a bag
Wake up every morning and I take a drag

Sucked on that pussy, I feel better already

Ass so mean that I’m always on her bad side
Uh, now she don’t ever stress me ’bout my whereabouts
Never seems concerned with other birds that she may hear about
She mind hers, it’s my turn, that shit she barely care about
Look amazing on me, why I’m always tryna wear her out
She don’t ride like you, no she don’t taste like that
Not with a waist like that, do I let her go to waste like that?
She a mix between Kama Sutra, yoga and porno flicks
Funny how her breath get shorter when I give her long dick, uh
And I’m telling y’all straight up
Might think I imagined shorty even when she not made up
She kill ‘em in Levi’s, see why, it ain’t even fair

I’m Tunechi bitch and you know that, and that pussy throw back
But any given night, I’d still pop that ass like a Prozac
Girl you know you got that murder, a beast in that La Perla
And every time we cut, I used to shred her; Ninja Turtles
And I know you still love me and I know ya still for me

Can’t even walk slow through that mall, 'cause paparazzi running after

Whether them lights on or them lights off, like I’m sleeping with the clapper
Said she watching what she eat, yet that ass keep getting fatter
How I’m sexing her, making likes of hers, no longer be a factor

In order to be sacrilegious, to look like them religious jeans
Blame her mother, but don't tell her dad

Hold up, wait a minute
Let me put some Millzy in it
Ain't no hands inside her body, but I bet she feel me in it

I'm a lover not a fighter, I can't find my lighter
My house is four stories, I tell'em I don't write em'
And my living room is white, my lies are much whiter
My darkest secrets are bright I need a sun visor
I say ""187"", make your bitch run my errands
I'm at the bar with a Dracula ordering bloody Mary's
I got a house on the prairie, got a corpse in the basement
I see hell out the window, man this view is amazing
And if I go back to jail, Persian rugs in my cell
Got the world in my hands it got all under my nails
In a room full of stares, give em something to see
I be so fucking faded, who washed the colors with bleach?
Now they biting my style, hope it get stuck in yo teeth

We'll check into it like the room cheap
And all we sell is the greatest feelin' on Earth
They paint me as a villain, I just autograph the artwork
Ain't got nothing left to prove unless I got to prove it in court
Live fast die young and leave a beautiful corpse, yes Lord
My nigga order like twenty bricks, I sent five bricks with four chicks
Ridin' with these guns that's carpoolin', bought extra clips when I dove in
Miss Snow white we snowed in, nigga miss me with that whole shit

Kill everybody you close with, Just don’t stick your nose in

Got witches all in my broom closet, got little killers in Chuco
We’ll find out your business hours and pop up like new toast
Like danger taste like glucose, my shadow don’t get too close
To that new nigga with my old hoes, kudos
For my niggas on Rikers Island back there playing Uno
Getting swole like Popeye for niggas walking around like Bruno
I’m in the bed with a duo, laid up like two points
A.K to your face, knock half off like coupons
Too cool for school but I sold cool points to school boys
Tell the cops we don’t name drop that's like dropping newborns
Nigga you crazy

You so crazy, Tunechi
These hoes made me
Nigga tell me somethin' I don't know

Like where the fuck did my heart go, and show me something I haven’t seen
And give me what help Martin sleep, on the same night he had a dream
And take me to where I’ve never been, but not to where I’ll never be
And I ain’t never scared but I’m scared of me, me versus me I need a referee
Need weaponry, especially if the treasury in jeopardy
Fuck deputies big letter B, need equity, need credit cleaned
To trafficking from peddling like everything from amphetamines to medicine
These niggas sweeter than Nectarines and Grenadine

You so Krazy, Tunechi
You so Krazy, bitch
I know, I know, I know, I know

Tell me something I don’t know, like what happened to hard coke
You can call me Eddy cause I stay ready, my family call me Eduardo
I’m music to these bitches ears I hit that ass like the wrong note
My bitch bad with corn rows with boots on in farm clothes
You can find me prancing in the finest mansion with the finest dancer with a height advantage
She want cocaine pills and weed, liquor and dick she gotta micro manage
I'm just eating rappers they go nice in salads with some diced up carrots
I just like a challenge, psychopathic, so psychopathic

Wake up in the world and I'm just another nigga
Call it public housing when you next door to the killers
On them corners it gets better as you go
Grind that motherfucker 'till it's yellow brick road
Free as a bird, spoken word in my verse
On my knees praying, niggas shooting in the church
Wake up out my sleep in another cold sweat
I lived on Billboard, where the fuck to go next?
Go against the odds, youngin' go and get a job
Another country boy they want back on the farm
So far from my goals but I'm close to my kids

Get it cracking like an eggshell in this motherfucker make omelettes
Get a bad bitch and post up like comments
They don't know what I been through, don't know what I'm going through
As long as I get through that's what I look forward to
Richer than a bitch but still I can't afford to

I swear I got that silencer on that Mac 9 and I kill these niggas with silence
My head stay in the clouds, I really feel like a giant
Can't trust none of these niggas, I murk one of these niggas
Then bury one of these niggas, still got dirt under my fingers, that
Ain't a threat that's fact cause they coming at my neck

To make a long story short, I need a shoulder cause the devil on one

Money over bitch, first nigga with a Wraith
Double M, we handle business

Came from the hood, ain't nothing changed
Still lemon pepper on my motherfucking wings

Oh, yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The bad ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you

Baby and I fucked with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? I take mothers instead
You got the hickups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp boy, treat me like sirloin
I'm talkin' bout runnin' in houses with arm and guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two goons and they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' bout your son and daughter rooms
This is just crazy my nigga, I mean brazy my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it my nigga
Blood gang take the B, I'll behave ya
I'm niggas is for reals
If you mouth off, I blow your face off
I mean pop-pop-pop, then I take off
Now you see me, now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx, acting like Ray Charles
16 in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully with 17 bullets
My story is how I went from poor me
To police pour me a drink and celebrate with me

Raise your bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only",Only,2014

Do yourself a favor, save yourself cause I can't save yah

Know you see me in that Rolls Royce, glass house, that nigga, hands down
No givin' up, no layin' down, all red, ant pile
My oldest son just turned five, I said ""Lil nigga, you a man now""
Ride around with that strap out cause that Rolls Royce, glass house
I just got a text that said ""Baby I just cashed out""
Whack weed get ashed out, put Persian rugs in the crack house
All y'all that lashed out, I'll come see what that's 'bout
But you don't need to call the fireman, to put a mothafuckin' match out
I can't remember my last drought, all my niggas' smashmouth

Niggas say they kings, they lyin', boy you talkin' to a card shark
I already made my mark, please don't think I just pop corks
Got these voices in my head screamin', can't believe they're not hoarse
Bitch I've been a beast since cartoon sheets
It's real on the field, I need new cleats, outgrew these
Catch you while you sleep, turn your sheets to maroon sheets
Them choppers turn your homeboys into amputees
And that's not a good look, momma was a chef, but daddy cooked the work
Said ""I know it stank but it's good""
Look, we treat them triggers like repeat buttons
Leave it all out there, or leave nothin'

She only want alcohol and trees, fuck that, you gotta branch out
I camp out by a rat house, wait 'till he turn the lamp out
Still drownin' in the fuckin' money, y'all niggas look like y'all swam out
In this bitch, gats out in this bitch
She say she can come and help my fat wallet get fit
I told her that's not in this script, I don't see that in the script

You ain't on a jet, you ain't meet a bitch with this kind of money yet
Yeah, I got an Audemar, I ain't set the time once
And I know they say they shine, I ain't seen 'em shine once
All these rappers is my sons, and I'm always nine months
Man if this was baseball, I ain't let 'em slide once

Oh, you wanna beat me, how?
Oh, you the number one draft in the league now?

I could sell salt and equalize it, wait

Boy, I got every award but a Heisman
Do a drive by on you niggas, make a U-turn for survivors
Take a newborn from his Momma, stick a shoe horn in vaginas
Got the coupe on Yokohamas, got the super soaker chopper
We'll kidnap the kingpin, like ""Who is your supplier?""

I'mma keep poppin' this champagne
(Ain't worried about shit)
Finally famous nigga

Man I look up to God
I wonder if I fell from the sky
Will I hit the ground or will I learn how to fly
I'm pretty sure you see it in my eyes
Sometimes I wonder if I already died
That shit get deep, deep, deep
Man I swear to God that shit just get so deep, deep, deep, deep

Man I swear to God it get so deep though
That sometimes I just gotta wake my ass up out my sleep though
And wonder what if all the shit I reaped then got repoed
And the girl I gave it all up for ain't love me for me though
See I got a stack of problems that could use a fucking steamroll
Got off in the game don't need no cheat code
As long as I know the G code
Being paranoid done turned me to a creep
You ain't got that metal on your side
Police gon' work it like Magneto if they need to, it get deep
Deep, deeper than telekinesis
Deeper than your sister dying and you're telling your nieces
The deeper it gets, boy the pressure increases
But pressure make diamonds
And my name is Sean cause I shine, it's self explanatory
I architect the flow, rapping all of these stories on stories
You know the story
If my back against the ropes, then I'll finish don't call it
My opponent probably praying for postponement
You fuck with the best rapper don't even know it
It's written in the stars man the sky is the author
I pulled the sword out of the stone I'm King Arthur
Motherfuck your armor nigga, only weapon I'm scared of is Karma
You watching the son turn to father, fucking life and her daughter
Nigga that shit just get deep

Man I look up to God
I wonder if I fell from the sky
Will I hit the ground or will I learn how to fly
I'm pretty sure you see it in my eyes
Sometimes I wonder if I already died
That shit get deep, deep, deep
Man I swear to God that shit just get so deep, deep, deep, deep

Been going hard all day, wish a nigga would fuck with me
Then I blow the candles out on my cake
And niggas always thinking it's a game, 'til we ran them out the arcade
Stunting in my southern player, reach the caddy like Andre
I talk that cash money shit
YM plus CMB you can do the math for me bitch
Jail time a slap on the wrist
Cut your head off get it mailed out stamp on your lips
You can tell I'm grinding by my wrist
Anything can happen cause a broke man is an optimist
Well tell them I'll be waiting in suspense
I got some miles on me but it's cool cause I never get an inch
And I don't give two fucks about what your mouth say
'Cause shit is deep and in rap I cannot say
That shit enough times like somebody rewind me
Like shit is deeper than rap, I cannot say that shit enough times
I feel like Sean, don't get enough shine
Is it because he ain't got the tattoos, he ain't throwing up signs
Well let me throw up mine and also let me show this vision of mine
Fuck the finish line, just finish in lines
And if getting your point across crosses the line
Some of the time, then cross it with pride
That's real my nigga, remember that
And ain't nobody if they remember you they remember rap
So just spit it back and hope somebody diggin' that
'Cause this shit is deep, deep
Deep as empty pockets, nigga
We come empty pockets before we have empty pockets slime
That shit get deep

Man I look up to God
I wonder if I fell from the sky
Will I hit the ground or will I learn how to fly

Nothin' I hate worser than a broke nigga
Got a Tec-9, and an AK, and an FN
Got a white Vette, and a white Ghost, and a white Benz
I ain't wantin' with niggas, so you don't get money with niggas

Bass ackwards, synonymous with rappers
All these niggas claiming maintaining that they factors
When you push a package, would you ever clap shit
All these niggas talking ain't done nothing but this rap shit
Reason why I shook this place and had to find some space
I killed one of these rap niggas and ate they fucking face
Outta place in this rap game, biggest mistake I ever made
Hit rewind and de-line, deleting everything I layed
Far from a rap nigga, I don’t lie for fun
Fuck fame, and fuck you, and fuck him, and her too
Nina called the big dog, I had to breathe smoke
But Yo Gotti and Big Scoob and this ain’t 'bout dope?
Bass Ackwards

These niggas ass backwards
She let me hit that ass backwards
Pussy niggas act hard, get killed for bad acting
Trigger man laugh man
It's funny how this shit go
Redrum was the case that they gave me
I sipped slow and stumbled down a slipped slope
I could hide the chopper in the trench coat
Tunechi go berserk in this bitch
Spellin' stressed backwards, dessert when my shit
I'm reversing this shit
My double R & R, I park on the curb in this bitch
The money, I'm submerged in this shit
So frankly, I'm stalking Ben Franklin
I am Wayne Carter, oops, I meant Cayne Warter
Cocaine on back order
Flip you ass backwards
Bitch you are bass ackwards if you think that's awkward

I got some shit on my mind

My little nigga Frog dead, dog
They shot my little nigga in his head, dog
You heard what the fuck I just said, dog?
Walk inside my closet like fuck everything red, dog
If you seen your best friend stiff, you would cry too
Sometimes I don't even wanna be a Piru
Then I think about it like, fuck everything blue
Who killed my motherfuckin' brother?
(I wanna know)
Who killed G man too? The shit I seen men do
If I told you, I'd have me floating in cement shoes
See Compton ain't shit really
And I’ve been at the bottom of the pits, feel me?
I done had some real niggas try to kill me
Fake niggas in my crew
Crip niggas more loyal than a few of my Piru
I done been shot, had a surgery or two
Above the rim like Pac, I’m like birdie at the troops
I can’t lie, every time I see Suge my heart beat
Cause I don’t know if I should dap him or let the hawk speak
Wilmington and Brazil, nigga them my cross streets
And who gon’ take it from me?

They think they know me
But they do not know me
'Cause I do not know me
Who killed my homie?

You gonna die any way
I’m gonna die any way
We can go any day
It can be any day
But for you
Today is the day
Today is the day

I was playing Madden then I heard a knock
Everybody know I got shot but this for niggas that forgot
Sometimes I thank God that I got set up
When you shot twice in the chest, it's kinda hard to keep your head up
Suspect one: the homies never came to see me
Suspect two: Red hid my gun behind the TV
Suspect three: I was beefing with this Crip in my apartment
Shit started cause we fought and he couldn't see me
There's usually ten niggas in our dope spot
Cold ass night, I'm like a janitor at Wing Stop
I usually play Xbox with the gun cocked
I'm cool with taking mine, but I took other niggas' gunshots
Chest wide open, I'm tryna fight, but my lungs not
Hole in my chest bout the size of a Kumquat
I know who shot me cause I shot them
But who set me up? I ain't tripping but
(I wanna know)

They think they know me
But they do not know me
'Cause I do not know me
Who killed my homie?
I wanna know names

I can kill you but ain’t nothing gonna change
But I might do it anyway
You gonna die any way
I’m gonna die any way
We can go any day
It can be any day
But for you
Today is the day
Today is the day

Let me tell you how I met my nigga Wack
Shit, he ain't always have a nigga back
When I met him, he was standing behind Suge
And everything is all good when you banging for your hood
Compton
That nigga Wack got my number and came through
Now let me tell you the type of shit the Game do
He walked in the booth where I was spitting
Gave him ten thousand, couldn't even finish his fuckin' sentence
I ain't owe him shit, but real recognize real
Now we like two red-nosed Pits
Cross him, you gotta cross me
And don't forget about where my nigga AR be
He be in the cut, that niggas nuts, don't give a fuck
Love his nigga Game to death, and he mean it from the guts

I must have about a milli on me right now

I'm still the highest sellin' female rapper, for the record
Man, this a 65 million single sold
I ain't gotta compete with a single soul
I'm good with the ballpoint game, finger roll

You a stand-up or is you in your chair, right now uh?

Then I walk up in the bank, pants sagging down

Cause here come this motherfucker with this mass account
That didn't wear cap and gown
Are you mad 'cause the judge ain't give me more time?

What you do it for if it ain’t for this
I watch my step so much, I’m starting to feel like my ankles’ wrist
Cold hearted, starting to feel like I’m in Anchorage when I think of this
And rude awakenings get taken in like fragrances

Bitch I smell like money, dope and cologne
I say bitch I smell like money, that’s that dope and cologne
And if he ain’t getting money, don’t love him, leave his broke ass alone
I say if he ain’t getting money, leave his stank ass alone
‘Cause bitch I smell like money, I smell like money
When you this rich they call it wealthy
Shit they gotta call it somethin’

Prescriptions and couple pistols
Got clean molly with the crystals
Middle finger to the judicials
Fork and a pot is my utensils
Had a threesome with 2 sisters
I get head and you kiss her
I don’t never call and you miss her
I got every gun except a missile
I paid attention to the minister
My silhouette is sinister
Only child with trust issues
You couldn’t walk a mile in my hoop shoes
Me and Tune 2 loose screws
2 parts in my box cut, my pop wouldn’t even pop up
Last night I prayed to God and asked for him to make a drop truck
Polo tee and ice watch, moccasins without socks
And I smell like money, I can count a hundred thousand with the lights off

Then he see me take off my sheep clothes

Hasta la vida, adios
Beat the odds like mosquitoes
Keep in mind I'm a negro so my open mind got a screen door
Bitches wan' come play the lead role
And end up with nothin' but B-roll
Sit on the dick in a C-4
Then I come back with a cheat code
Pill bottle only half full
But fuck it my nigga, I'm past good
Sexy bitch rubbin' my tats good
But before she do, bitch, wash yo' hands good
I'm flexin' muscles that you can't pull
You can't make a fist 'cause I'm a handful
I never really knew my dad good
But still grew up to be the big bad wolf
You always see me with the white cup
Some people say that it's a bad look
But take a good look at what you are lookin' at
You never know when it's your last look
It's written all over my face
These tattoos, they can't be erased
One of a kind, I can't be replaced

I see no cracks in me, though

Daytime, start to turn black

Thank God, Wheezy back, order is restored, all is right with the world
Last times become we lost time
No free time, 'til I bought time
No tea time, no off time
No me time, on y'all time
Blessings shower from the north side
From the brightest flower out the darkest skies
Love is blind, but we caught eyes
It's a bumpy road, but a joyride
Still can't ignore my rappetite
Like a hungry shark in a koi pond
Still the mothafuckin' best rapper, a-live

Get them on the line, stay two cars behind and tell them hoes, ""don't be so obvious""
Mona Lisa
Long hair, don't care, she handle the business and don't ever tell
She bite the bullet and cough up the shells
She tell 'em, ""Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place""
And if he say, Yea', then we meet him there
She feed him lies with his silverware
She don't want love, she just want her share
I, know a bitch named Liz, this nigga think she his
'Cause she tell him that it is
So he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears
And then she tell me, and I be all ears
And then I go and tell my people, and they already know him
And then I call Liz and she say he comin' over
I say, ""Good girl, just remember what I told you""
She gave me the salute, I say, ""Girl, you're a soldier""
We're waitin' outside, watch him pull up
Walk up to the door and right before he knock, she open the door naked
She left it unlocked
They started french kissing so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch
Music up loud with his head in the cloud
Turn that shit down and I scared the piss out of him
Piss a nigga off, put a gun to his frown
Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around
I ain't here to fuck around, caught you wit' your pants down
You know what it is, put your fucking hands up
Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down
And then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her
She a good actress and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we're after
If Liz call you daddy, she about to be a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga
But think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga
I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga
She pour you a drink, that drink on me, nigga
She slip something in it, now think for me, nigga
Mona Lisa, I done painted the picture
Mo-mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas
Pussy got you out of character, nigga
You fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
Take everything that you have, 'til don't even have an opinion
We have your attention and now you're looking down a barrel though nigga
Now she looking for her pantyhose, nigga
We just looking for the casserole, nigga
But she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga
Mona

Ah, everyday she wake up with a different color makeup
And a promise he gon' take to the movie and the mall
Chilling with the Laker, on the floor
Fourth quarter, four minute on the clock Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi looking at them both popping up and take a picture, uh
Probably on a Internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admitting that he love her on his mother
Man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
Mona Lisa
Pussy good enough, it got him sinnin' in her walls
And he digging in it like he living in it
Make a new religion with it
Man a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in a pear tree, sweet tone like a hummingbird
When she asked him, did he want to make love in a yellow taxi
Never gave two fuck, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby
Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'ma a dog in the wind, I'm a pit laughing
I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend and I'm all jazzy
Britney with the twin and the girl Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy
Bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me
'Bout no motherfucking double standard, acting
Fucking on another nigga, that's negative alone
But you sucked his dick, that's just nasty
Matter of fact, bitch, gimme your phone (No)
You fucking with Wayne? (No)
Bitch, gimme your phone (No, let me take this call)
(Lick me like a lollipop)
He on your fucking ringtone?
Is that the shit that you do?
Touching yourself, looking at Kendrick videos
Jump on the Internet, watching his interviews
I don't know what the fuck, lately got into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder
Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma daycare after school
And she never did charge her
You scandalous as fuck, and I hope you blow up
You know what, I give up, let me go get my gun, I got one in the chamber
I'm plannin' on aimin', God dammit, you know the damage is done
Bitch I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress
I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion, since you like rappers that's killing that pussy I'm killing myself

She say, ooh, daddy, ooh, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Ooh, fake smile, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
She say, ooh, no emotion, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Now he get the picture, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, yeah",Mona Lisa,2018
Lil Wayne,"Ah-em

Sometimes I feel like I ain't shit
Sometimes a nigga feel like shit
Talkin’ 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, ""dear life"" shit
So if a nigga kill me, hope he mean it
I just hope I die for a reason
They probably won't miss me 'til they need me
Have problems with admittin' that they need me, Lord
I'm talkin' 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, ""dear life"" shit
Way too concerned to be conceited
I live and I learn, then die tryna teach 'em, Lord
Die tryna reach 'em
They care more about how much I leave 'em, where'd I leave it?
I hope I leave more of an impression on my kids 
To be destined to have blessings to believe in, Lord
Just got off the phone with my son
Told him, ""You're a son of a gun""
Just got off the phone with my daughter
Told her, ""I won't hesitate to fuck a young nigga up"", Lord
A few bitches left me
That only got a new bitch elected
My old bitch was too disrespectful
And only give my new bitch respect
That’s power, yes
So now we’re next
Can't lie though, I tried though
I’ll die tryin', that's a common death
We was such a team, we was chasin' our dreams
Then it stopped, now I’m outta breath
Now they try to tell me I need rest
And I'll find love again, I ain't find it yet
Oh, but I guess it is what it is
As it appears, oh shit
The object in the mirror is more near than it appears, oh shit
And sometimes I fear who in the mirror
That nigga weird
He done died so many times but still here
Why am I here?
Dear life
What is my meaning? My reason?
Naked bitches really love ones
Sometimes our loved ones don't love us
I'm fuckin' more than I'm makin' love
Sometimes I make my rubber wear a rubber
I just tell my lady, ""Nothing's easy""
Even though I make it look easy
But understand looks are deceiving
Lookin' like I'm lookin' for some grievance
'Cause I been through way too much, don't wanna think about it
Cranky 'bout it, gotta drink about it
Gotta synchronize it, tranquilize it
Doctor ain't prescribin' what he ain't realizin'
Pain inside me got me thinkin' 'bout me
Tryna hang my body, sanctifyin'
I'm a gangsta dyin' 'cause all gangsters die
I can't deny it, you can't tame a lion
I'm a angry lion hangin' by a string
I can't describe it
Feel like a anchor tied to my finger
Got me sinkin' to the bottom of my drink
I know a lotta niggas think I got a lotta niggas
There's strength in numbers but there's honor over strength
I talked to God the other day, he said he got a nigga
So, I look death up in her eye and then I wink
It's way too real
The shit I'm talkin' way way too real
I hope it gave you chills
The dirt under your feet could be the grave you fill
You don't know how dead you feel until you're dead for real
Gettin' high after I paid the bill
Lower than a Navy SEAL
Show up with them Navy guns
I hope somebody prayin' for 'em
Price tag, no mistake, somebody payin' for 'em
Ice baths, when my face numb, no expression
What's the life expectancy when you don't expect shit?
Mama told me, ""Fuck the world and be so aggressive""
Be so fluorescent, watch these hoes 'cause they so obsessive
I don't get too high to look over blessings
Never come in second, make the most of your seconds
They so precious
'Cause if we could buy time every store would sell it
If you want me to read your mind, need correct spelling
I keep it real, niggas better keep it copasetic
Where the weed? I feel like I'm getting sober headache 
Lookin' in the mirror at the one that know me better
I was too busy to talk, I wrote an open letter

Dear life
Was is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question
I ask the reader
God bless the reader
Dear life
What is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question

You know, when he told me Toya was havin' a baby

And then she want to start fights
'Bout, what about how she feel
She tell me I'm a cheap thrill
I know she don't mean that
She think I feed her lies

So my deception preforms
And then that silence is awkward
Like, am I deaf or alone?
I gotta jet in the morn'
And she upset and I'm calm
And when a woman in scorned
Is when your welcome is worn
Now her temperature's showing
And I just weathered her storm

Got a problem with Three 6, gotta blow your brains out

Got that south sowed up, got them guns loaded up

Throw some chairs, crack your jaw
If it's killing season, ain't no reason, ain't no need ta stale
I'm the one put here ta absorb all this energy and pain
Non stop pop from the top of the clip in ya glock
I still don't feel you, mane

'Cause of that, ground the coke and now I'm puffin' a pound of dro
When I'm on that level and wit' my killaz you will be found on the flo'
I must confess, I ain't 'bout shit but if you think ta cross me, bitch
You'll end up stanky, walk the planky and empty out your pockets, bitch

Break da law, break your leg, crash da club and crack your neck
Wit' these issues that I'm facing daily I should tote a tec
Get respect that's no option, all the haters filled with toxin'
Walk right through the center of the crowd and pistols get ta flossin'

Causing problem, dodging bullets, soon as I corrupt the scene
Leaving damage, making havoc reaction fuckin' with me
Chair to your bizack go through my head when you ignite the flame
Lead to your bizack of your hizead before it hit your brain

We 'bouta crash da club, throw some chairs
Break, break, break, break, break something
We 'bouta crash da club, throw some chairs
Break, break, break, break, break something

We 'bouta crash da club, throw some chairs
Break, break, break, break, break something
We 'bouta crash da club, throw some chairs
Break, break, break, break, break something

We 'bouta crash da club, throw some chairs
Break, break, break, break, break something
We 'bouta crash da club, throw some chairs
Break, break, break, break, break something

We 'bouta crash da club, throw some chairs
Break, break, break, break, break something
We 'bouta crash da club, throw some chairs

Lil Wyte,"Go on and slip me two Xanax Bars, I'm ready to git fool
5th to Crown to wash it down, I'm downtown snapping rolls
Ain't no shame up in my game, in fact I'm mentally deranged
Oxycontin in my system, man I'm feeling kinda strange
Watch me choke about this dope, Blueberry from Texas
She want to git up in rotation that's too bad 'cause I'm stressing
'Bout now it's 1:30 am, 11 Percocets just entered me
15 minutes from this second, I'll be crawling on my knees
Laughing at the crowd of all the clowns that be surrounding me
Take another Lortab to call me down and let me see
Body be relaxed, muscles be loose, and you have stopped the pain
No more bitching 'bout your day and work and driving in the rain
Put up wit' the fussing and discussion, I plant in your brain
Hypnotize ya minds, like all the rest but I come through the veins
Take a chill pill to slow me down and git back in this game
Gatta be up on ya P's and Q's to even feel it mane

Oxycontin, Xanax Bars, Percocet and Lortab
Valiums, Morphine, patches, Exctacy, and it's all up for grab
What'cha want, what'cha need, hit me up I got you mane

What'cha want, what'cha need, hit me up I got you mane
What'cha want, what'cha need, hit me up I got you mane

Scarecrow, scarecrow what's that you popping?
A powerful pill they call Oxycontin
But it'so tiny, that it catch you dragging
Haven't you heard big things come in small packages
I prefer the orange's with the black O-see
Take to where you can, I move about you see
Some people mellow down in a needle and shoot 'em up
Buy I pop 'em with Seroquel like glue, I am stuck

See I'ma pill popper, so I'ma keep poppin' em
Gimme 20 Xanax and I'ma start droppin' em
They ain't no stoppin' him, when they in my system
Mane I really miss 'em, can you help me get 'em
I heard you have Clidina, on that fucking pill shed
Gimme some fuckn Ec', gimme some Percocets
I need me some four bar, so I can break down
'Cause a nigga like me 'finna take it to funky town

[Verse 1]
I'm 5 foot 8, from the Bay, white as fuck and do not play
If you want me, come and get me, Fraiser Drive is where I stay
Won't you come on down my way, I hope that you ain't afraid
You won't even need the numbers 'cause we posted every day
On the corner or in my front yard where we smoke marijuana
Sit back, wait on the police to ride by and stash so we can dog'em
Know wha I'm sayin, they can't fade us, so what the fuck you think you gon do?
We HCP, clicked up with the rest of the world and yes we deep foo
You don't want to end up an example of what we would to to haters mayne
Victimz have said that we bring the pain and witnesses that we all insane
I don't want to stress all of tha shit that y'all been constantly questionin
Shit that I'm preachin come from people teachin
The shit that I remember so deep within
And when I get to where I'm gonna be in my successful life
I'ma look down at y'all haters in disgrace 'cause I done took my flight
And when I get in that shining stage of my life
I'ma make sure all y'all haters remember me and I'm gon allright

[Chorus]
So many haters in this world they want to see us fall
We have no love for none of you bustaz, I said none of y'all
I know you see me everyday, I'm posted on the wall
I'm gonna continue to mash and always standin ten toes tall
So many haters in this world they want to see us fall
We have no love for none of you bustaz, I said none of y'all
I know you see me everyday, I'm posted on the wall
We gonna continue to mash and always standin ten toes tall

[Verse 2]
Keep'em breathin, leave'em bleedin, boy this is not haters season
This the reason for them beefin, all the rest is just some treason
I got nina's, I got rifles, I got fully auto's too
You get one I will get five and everyone will come for you
This the truth, I got problems in my life and that'z a fact
But that don't give you one right to jump in my shit and holla back
With a different brain, simple thangs, keep me on a different plane
Bizness mayne, with pleasure to settle by an open flame
Plenty change will be accepted, but plus I want the fame
Know my name and disrespect it but it will stay the same
Down the drain, knowin for me I have to be workin thangz
Love the game, want to retire but when I'm 80 mayne
Mary Jane all in my system but yet I still maintain
I'm insane, so hard to hide it but still I can't complain
I got killaz takin good care of ya, leavin plenty stainz
With the shovel I'm gonna bary yo mangled up remainz

Talk about these hatin lil boys, carryin they toys but they small dawg
Put yo 22 under my 5-0 cal and I'ma get rawed dawg
Ain't no need to stall dawg, I'ma blow up on all y'all
Racin across the nation to yo crib, I bought my sign y'all
Now we about to stop, now the road about 2 blockz
Reachin yo house wit two glockz, got in yo house wit 2 knockz
Came to the door in Reebok's, joggin pants wit no sockz
Run up them steps actin like you won't get caught but break them door lockz
Situations gettin mixed,yo messenger boy got in some shit
Crossed the wrong one, he found out he didn't know who he was fuckin wit

In a nut shell don't fuck wit this
Fraiser,bound lil youngsta, *Hyptonized* is how I'll leave ya bitch
Blastin back wit competition, stainin on y'all fuckin hoez
Leavin incisions I'm pimpin righ up out the do'
Hate me now, hate me later, it's all good I gots to go

[Chorus]",Ten Toes Tall,2003
Lil Wyte,"Well, I've been tripping for ten hours
On three hits of liquid microdot
I'm on acid
Man, what's this suppose to do to us anyway man?

Getting chased around the car
By some midgets in the parking lot
I'm on acid
Hey, is that midget coming over here?

Eating doritos through a tree
A million spiders after me
I'm on acid
Oh come on, I bet you can't eat just one

I'm running around having a fit
On myself I'm 'bout to shit
I'm on acid
Man, I gotta get to a toilet Dogg

Could you imagine feeling all confident
All of a sudden your fingers get

Please stop freezing
What is the season?
Where are we at?
And why are we leaving?

Trees are shrinking, turning past the roots
And roots back into season
Clouds are changing coming at me
Different directions now I'm freaking

Toes are raking, body shaking
Man I thought it was some crack
Called the fire department
Told them I had a flame up on my back

This is crazy busting able
Raisons dancing on the table
There's a horse we gotta horse
Yeah, we do and I've seen the stable

Quit your flogging, I ain't flogging
Gotta be then who you talking to?
I'm talking to you talking to me listen
'Cause if you and I have to be kinda smart to even catch
That I might be tripping but the pimpin', grippin' gotta spit that

With no expecticy I made a party from a robbery
Accidently kicked and tripped the thief when he had ran by me
Fuck police we gonna send this district into LSD

Take this shot of purple microdot
You will be gone a week

20/20 vision blurred
And can't even feel the syrup
I'm on acid
Man, I can't believe this stuff is stronger then that syrup

I can smoke a pound of dro
Drink myself under the floor
I'm on acid
I can't even feel none of these beers man my eyes ain't real

Put the straw up to your nose
Take the blow straight to your dome
I'm on acid
Don't even mess with that snort Dogg, I'm trippin'

Your passing on in my front yard
Throwing up off zanex bars
I'm on acid
Look like you took about one two many of them pills

Well, I'm wishing I was sober
Feel the shit from head to shoulders
This ain't even half way over
It's the part I'm waiting to show ya

Laughing long time like Hyenas
Laugh a long time at mienas
In the can or out the can
They still look like a can of peanuts

I'm the meanest acid taker
Down south cracker on the mike
Chainsaw crankin', gotcha thinking
Good trick gone turned to a fright

Bubble popping, trails are watching
From across the fucking room
A dog came in the den and made a mess
And then asked for the broom

Now I'm 'bout to hit the sack
'Cause I can't take this shit no more
Relax my mind, take a deep breath
And let my head sink in pillow

Take a seven hour nap, wake up seven minutes later
It's the greatest drug the 70's has ever fucking gave us
Yes it's major, don't be playing when you drop it, it will hit ya
If it's gel caps or liquid microdots, yes I'm with ya

And I'm flipping cross the row
Visual contact, lighting glow
The spaceship I'm flying landed in the bay
I have to go

By now I'm weak, in some pain
And my bodies feeling drained
I'm on acid
Man, I feel like a can even walk no more

Coming down off of my trip
And my skins about to rip
I'm on acid
I can feel my hands hurting

I'll probably sleep till Thursday
And it's only Sunday
I'm on acid
I can't wait to hit my bed man

Waking up on that Thursday
To have another Saturday
I'm on acid
Man, I can't wait till I pass some more of that shit

I got some red necks wit me ready to get drunk and shot da gauge
They got 6 shots of tequila and half a bottle of bacardi
The bottle came from someones cooler when we left the bonfire party
They constantly askin fo mo and tryin to pour me up a shot
Incredible hulk mixed wit vodka and a skotch on the rocks
Crown royal wit coke a bud light my eye balls afloat
So much fuckin liquid in me i got to hit da pisser fo sho
Keepin up wit hill billys actin silly drunker then shit

If your goin to drink might as well drink until you hit the floor
Afta you hit the floor get yo ass up and pour a couple mo

Aight I'm alright listen to my words I have dranken up half the bar
And still yet a swurl I heard
I looked down at red neck he look like he was about to hurl
Brother robby actin similar but was spinnin like the world
Now real rednecks can get drunk like some shit I've neva seen
Ten shots bud lights fo chasin and ready for round eleventeen
Demolition derbys at the races rodeos and hill streets
When ever legal liqour sold white folks will meet
But we all want to get fucked up and when i say we
I'm talkin about every nationality on this g.l.o.b.e
And some do, some don't, some might like it, some won't,
I'll tell you wut i love this so much I'm fucked up right now

The outcome would of been ridiculous and we wouldn't of survived
Believe it or not i was the most sober of the five of us
Liquor in me got to piss again i feel like I'm bout to bust
Good thing we got out the exit fo me to handle my business
I jumped out to drain my lizard and god as my witness
I see a truck load of moonshine hideing behind some trees
Wit the keys in it and nobody around
No one but me this mean we can get drunker and crunker
And make us some cheese from mariana arkansas
Through the woods back to tennessee

Its easy when you rappin over the hardest motherfuckin beats
I am not braggin, and I'm not big headed, nor am I conceded
but I'm proud of myself and the way I supposedly succeeded
you want to bring it to my door
or be a bitch and catch me slippin
either way it goes this unit I'm grippin's gonna get you, pimpin

[Chorus] - 2X",I Did 'Em Wrong,2004
Lil Wyte,"Yeah
Hypnoztize Mind
The club crazy right now
Hopefully you'll do
Globally 
Finish it!!

[Chorus: x2]
Would you beat him to the flo in the club?
I sho will!
Would you jack them even if they ain't dubs?
I sho will!
If he actin like a bitch, we gon treat him like a bitch (2x)

You mothafuckas want true colors, I got white and I got black
Bay Area mothafuckas comin soon as I step up on the track
If he actin like a bitch, we gon treat him like a bitch
If his hate get stomped the floor, then go for all his shit
Frasier Bizzle, DJ Pizzle, Lil Whistle and Hypnotizzle
Run the shit for shizzle, roll up another one my nigga
I got to get made
i got to get change
I got to rip this mic from California to Maine
And take over this thing
Send it to the Dominicans
Make sure they start jammin all of my sentences
Make sure that they remember it
Like it was some Religious shit
The white gold ghetto platinum *honkey* rippin it
Take that to the bank get a deposit slip and fill it out
For a hundred thou, turn around and shove it in yo mouth
Do a review on Hypnotize and you'll see nothin but potential
People gettin beat to the flo and it started wit a pencil

[Chorus]

Check it out, I'm new to the scene
Lil Wyte lighter wit gasoline
Fire breathin get it closer to the grass that isn't green
Which means your teams expired to the back of the pack
Sixteen bars of knowledge designed on every track
Hold me down, never happen
Get my crown, keep on rappin
Even at 75, I'll still be able to work my magic
Beat a Willie Nelson of the new generation
A risin legacy shoutin across every nation
I need a passport luggage and a new Rolls Royce
50 Billion but I will settle for 2 point 4
Check the scans, I'm the man in this independent land
No video no single record companies like I be damned
This Wyte cat can rap and put on a good show
It's funny how his music get fuck be down to the flo
I gots to give it raw, I gots to give it dirty
Whatever city you reppin, beat them down if you head me

[Chorus]

I done seen some brighter days
I done seen a lotta hate
My album hit a 100,000 now shit been goin my way
i give my props to my pops
Give my props to my mom
Give my props to the Camp, give my props to the South
Now I'm drunk and I'm high but I bet you already knew it
You fuck as me, you fuck as us and we twice and fuck as you
Security started movin through the middle of the crowd
Only if he got a gun, will I agree to shut him down
Cause I ain't tryin to get shot by no mothafuckin fuck
A nerd by day done had to many drinks and all a sudden crunk
Pick me up, let me out, blow me up and fuck me loud
So many styles be comin up outta me whenever I'm in the crowd
I have a high pace game face eyeballs up in outer space
Keep up with the shit, tryin to stay away
What you think, only cracka good enough to be down the 6
Clearly understood that this some orignal gangsta shit

[Lil Wyte]
I'm slummed out right now, that ain't no surprise
Dilated pupils seein doubles out of both my eyes
I hit up a little spark, got 'em for no charge, and fuck with his boy
Zanex bars call 'em totem poles or even tonka toys
I popped half and then popped the other half and hit the crown
Then put my shot glass down and poured another round
I'm starting to fill everything I just put into my body
Liquor and the bars got me right though I might look retarded
Get up out my way little quicka with the K
Even though I'm fucked up I'ma still maintain
Got sumthin in my brain like do damn thang
Like tell the same mayne's ass soft insane
I'ma monsta when I'm high specially on some bars
Don't need to cop lyrically can catch a charge
Runnin down the street yellin fuck the police
With Reeboxs on my feet high on 4 more bars
I'ma hold my crown and I'ma rep my Memphis pop my pills, smoke all my deeros
Be fucked up fall out in public fallin out on crackers and negros
Ho you think you know Lil Wyte I'm telling you rightcha now
You hold out I'ma find out better pull 'em out and pass them sticks around

[Chorus]
Totem poles, Candy bars, even Yellow ladders
Tonka toys, White sticks it don't really matter
If you got 'em pass that shit around I want to look like you
If you got 'em pass that shit around I want to look like you
Totem poles, Candy bars, even Yellow ladders
Tonka toys, White sticks it don't really matter
If you got 'em pass that shit around I want to look like you
If you got 'em pass that shit around I want to look like you

[Lil Wyte]
One little pill you can break down into fo's
Guaranteed when mixed with liquor it gone have on the flo'
Take advantage of the power the sticks put off every hour
Try to over do it you gone find yourself off in the shower
This is not some powder the effects are completely differant
You are not a coward if you pop one and get scared of the shit
You might forget what you did the night before if you want 'em
Better get somebody to be witcha only if they ass is sober
Gotta keep my fuckin brain on chicken lane change only if the beat bang
I'll be able to do my thang no what I got to do know why I gotta rock
Fucked up or not I'ma take this shit to the top
If you see me in the streets betta believe me this cracker is off the hezzy
Memphis, Tennessee is my stopping ground and zanex bars just went down in me
This weed in me and Henessey all over my academics T
Was fucked up and doubled in for shit but fallin up out the S-you-V
They serious don't play with 'em if you can't handle 'em come my way
We'll rock 'em to the BAY and we'll deal 'em up on the slang
When I bump my female in an all night bang with a BIOTCH!

2 door cut with flippy flop on the paint
looking like a bag of skittles that will make you wan't to faint
eyes cocked ass drop when pulled up on the set
people scard to touch my car like they might fall in and get wet
I can't keep my whip in sun for so long cause it might melt like a pack
of starburst on a summer day sitting on the shelf
I got to get her out
get her high
take her out for a ride
hopefully tonight I won't commit vehicular homicide
my cutless is clean as a fuckin whistle
Paul, and Juicy both told me I better pack pistols
pistols plural for the one's of those who do not know
I gon let these bitches rip the bay and try to take my hoe

If they won't me so bad they can find me standin in my yard

It's time to talk about the muscle in this perfect creation
brand new chevy blocked and it's chromed out it will block conberation

wow hoe if you in the road

I'm a good driver but can get reckless on purple leana

A couple of sets of extra clips
And some ham sandwiches
The po-pos know me
And their used to my shananagans
I run the set, man, causing chaos everywhere
want to make a bet, man
I'll have you pulling out your hair
This is a have-to-do job
But on a need-to-know basis
Don't keep your eyeballs on the prize
Don't keep up with the faces
I roll with murderers, robbers
Drug dealers, killers, and rapists
Also an army on the porch
With plenty rockets a'waitin
Come test my patience, fool
And find out how Lil Wyte will react
I'll have these haters, fool
Flopping like some fish on their back
They got me fucked up
I'm about to load them trucks up
When I get crazy then you
Just might feel some hot stuff
This was not on my agenda
I was just only playing
But since you're testing my gangsta
It's too damn late for praying

[Chorus - 2x]

Automatic gun fire busting at you hoes
To get my point across
You got raw bullet to your dome
Is what I'm about to toss
Sold me a short sack
Now you about to feel the trauma
Sulfuric acid, so clogged
In a pine box for your momma
What am I about to do
Some says you already know
Bring your family in this? No!
I ain't as cool as you folks
This shits between me and you
But between you and me
I got a feeling it might be all up to G-O-D
And you can talk all of the trash
You want it don't even matter
As long as my album keep selling
My pockets gonna get fatter
I guess the static is because
I am the chosen one
Deadly circumstances come with job
Better have your gun
You might be found bleeding
Seeking for the perpetrator
Something tells me he real far
And you won't find him, player
Quit your crying, bitching
And your whining, hating
Faking, fronting
I'll run your ass up up off the block

Try to determin the evil and good all in my twisted mind
Hopefully, this just might be the one that reaches to the world
And make a safer place to play for all our little boys and girls
'cause I'm a soldier don't get it twisted
Get your wig split
Fifty millimeter shells aiming for the terrorist
Must have missed 'cause they still comin with some big shit
Osama fucked up real deep and there ain't no time to fix it
He better be off the planet, two light years passed the moon
Rode on a magic carpet satellites gonna find him soon
He's probably already dead fuckin with tha U.S.A
But if not he better not bring his ass up in tha bay

Let me hear tha sound of tha soldiers
I said let me hear tha sound of tha soldiers

The marines ain't no punk and you know we keep grenades and AK's in the trunk
With Iraq we be buck, we be fightin and we stomp
With our fist, with our feet, we be ready when you jump
We don't hide behind mask like a terrorist my nigg

Now ain't that some shit ya hatin' on this click
You gon' make a nigga get up with cha kid
Split yo wig oh yes, I did
I told you, you don't want it with a hard hitta kid

I done warned the glock spot to spot hit the locks
Hit a nigga for his stash spot
Took the rock nigga was got that was the plot
Dodge the cops they labeled it another closing shop

Open it up for closin' it up I don't give a fuck
On a daily basis I be postin' it up
Smokin' it up choppin' it to match it wit dub
Give us a club six mane tearin' it up

But ya'll know ya'll done heard all that befo'
Y'all done seen the fo-fos and folks kick in ya doe

You done seen the gauge pump bout to see a Chevy trunk
Lights out next to the Mississippi river plumped
Duck tape hog tied wrong place wrong time
Hypnotized minds trick knocked ya up off ya grind

All my muhfuckers you niggaz should already know
I'm the truth and out the booth never been a hoe
Get yo ass flipped sideways cut ya through the doe
You ain't know I'm a young rich gangsta nigga

Never been one of them old type wanksta niggaz
I'm a smart muhfucka ask my mama who made me
A lotta niggaz mad 'cause they know they can't fade me

Well it's ya boy grandaddy call me Mr. Man
Fuckin' ya aunties ya nieces and ya mammies
See I could give a fuck about ya tossin' all ya tough talkin'
You don't like me nigga hit me in my mouth

Man don't talk about it be about it get cha point across then
Candy ass nigga boy you softer than cotton
Fight me or squash it 'cause I ain't 'bout the spit boxin'
Hootin and hollerin' like a cheerleader squadron

You can't be like me slangin' D 'cause I'm hurtin' ya
No competition with the juice 'cause it's curtains
It ain't nothin' shakin' but some pimps in this bizitch
That's why you muggin' and yo face lookin' pizzissed

Stay flippin' cars ballin' out like to shizine
You stay askin' questions how the hell them niggaz do that
We smoke the best of dro while she down with some jack-jack
My eyes like the red carpet still on the blue side

They locked me up just like 2Pac and I went platinium
Laid it down for a calendar I'm right back at 'em
Took my game then weighed it up on a triple beam
Niggaz rob, kill, murder steal for that ghetty green

U.S. marshal at my folks house want to kill me dead
Wanna see me in a pine box bullet in my head
I'm was like, ""I ain't did shit why you hatin' this?""
Ghetto thugs know my rap songs they relate to this

I been doin' this too long to still be strugglin' livin' like this
Fuckin' off with major labels slayed me like a bitch
And these got cheese and ride on rolls it mean hoes
But still on the road doin' free shows

Tryna get a few spins in a few spots
I growed up back in the day I wouldn't use my glock
I hear a lotta corny shit on the radio
That's because they record company wouldn't spend dough

Yeah, my label got a hook up with MTV
But they just keep forgettin' to tell 'em 'bout me
They try to play like its love and it's family
But all my marketin' dollars goin' to, shh

Tear da club up was the first crunk fight song
I made that in 92 a lil' not long
That it took 10 million sold and we still ain't on
That's why three 6 is the most known unknowns

Fettuchini with Alfredo
All I wanted was the fame and every game they made on Sega
I was 5 or 6 years old when I had told myself ok you're special
But I treat you like my equal never lesser
I was 26 years old when we had dropped this one amazing record
Had the world stepping
That's what I call epic
Couple summers later I got paper
I acquired taste for salmon on a bagel
With the capers on a square plate
At the restaurant with the why you got to stare face
To know I either ball or I record over the snare and bass
Rapper face, dread headed
Golden diamond teeth wearing
They just mad 'cause I got that cheese bitch I keep dairy
Turnt up in the party getting lit to Yachty
With a Spanish Barbie word to my mami

Lil' Mo' Yin Yang,"Man, women, boy, women, girl
Women without a man is nothing
Without her, man is nothing
Women have their faults
Men only have two
Everything they say and everything they do
Men who have pierced ears are better prepared for marriage
They've experienced pain
And have bought jewelry
Women have two weapons
Cosmetics and tears
I'm a perfect house keeper
Every time I leave a man I keep his house
No women has ever hated a man
Enough to give him back his diamonds
Why don't women blink during foreplay?
They don't have time
Man, women, boy, women, girl
Men forget everything
Women remember everything
A girl can wait for the right man to come along
But it doesn't stop her from having fun
With all the wrong ones in the mean time
The real reason why it's so difficult to find men
Who are sensitive, caring and good looking?
Is because they all have boyfriends already
A successful man is one who makes more money
Than his wife can spend
A successful women is one who can find such a man
Man, women, boy, women, girl
Women driver really means
Someone who doesn't speed, tailgates
Swear, make obscene gestures
And has a better driving record than men have
It's a guy thing really means
Irrational, illogical, stupid and extremely low
Oh don't fuss I just cut myself, it's no big deal
Really means I'm about to die but before I die
I want you to remember me as a strong proud man
Who never cries
Man, women, boy, women, girl
If you want to learn more about women
Watch 'Sex in the City'
If you want to learn more about men
Take a good look at Homer Simpson
The difference between light and hard
Is that men can sleep all night with a light on",Reach,1996

To find the one in this life
The one we all dream of

So I'll be waiting for the real thing.
I'll know it by the feeling.
The moment when we're meeting
Will play out like a scene straight off the silver screen
So I'll be holdin' my own breath
Right up to the end
Until that moment when
I find the one that I'll spend forever with

'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there.
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares.
Someone to love with my life in their hands.
There's gotta be somebody for me like that.

'Cause nobody wants to do it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone.
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere.
There's gotta be somebody for me out there.

Tonight, out on the street out in the moonlight
And dammit this feels too right
It's just like Deja Vu

Having fun in the city
Doing robberies, ringing bells and touching bitches titties
Stealing bikes was the best one 
And you probably get fifty if you came with an fresh one
From the big homie, from down the block
He keeps an gain of money because he slangs them rocks 
But I'm not knocking that meth and getting paid
He straight living lauging and he has it made
And every day he chills in the shade 
He been doing that shit way back in the days

Lil' 1,"[Lil' 1/2 Dead]
I met me an girl in another land
She was fine and so thick from the southern land
She had it going on from my head to feat
With the perfect hair dew and her voice was sweat
Patique just how her body was big
In the country green grass it what we cheep
In the park in the dark and try to spark an joint
Skip the bull shit get to the point
I was bumping and grinding trying to find my space
I'm kissing my baby all over her face
Yes indeed was soft like fur, boy did I like to make love to her
Everyday and every night you see
Man that pussy was so bomb to me
And she's the only to rock my world
Man I can't wait to see my southern girl

[Lil' 1/2 Dead Chorus]
Southern Girl
I want to rub ya, kiss ya, squeeze ya, hug ya
You really got it going on and I just love my yellow bone
Southern Girl
I want to rub ya, kiss ya, squeeze ya, hug ya
I love it when your next to me and you always giving bomb sex to me

[Lil' 1/2 Dead]
Now me and my girl be getting it on
From the late, late night to the break of dawn
We be putting it down like yes indeed
Then I take some braids so I can twist my weave
You see to handle my business loc
Straight putting the stroke down and it ain't no joke
I be loving when she squeeze my back
Then she kiss me and I kiss her back
In fact she really likes when I bump
She be telling me her ex man a punk
Cause he ain't got stroke like I do
She be saying ""Baby I ain't lying to you""
Then I ask her if she love me loc
Straight putting the smash down with every stroke
Everytime I hit it make her eyes swirl
Man I can't wait to touch my southern girl
[Lil' 1/2 Dead Chorus]

[Lil' 1/2 Dead]
My southern girl she's the one
When I say do something she get's it done
With no back talk because she don't talk back
She straight listen when I kicks my fact
Like that, I be telling her my good and bad shit
Let her know that I never had shit
And I'm trying do my best to get's mine
That's why I'm on the corner grind
So me and you can't live life straight and see your face, I just can't wait
Because you got it going on and I love ya
I would never disrespect or even shove ya
Because you are my number one lady 
And you really love me because I ain't shady
And we going to be on top of the world 
Just me and you my sweat southern girl

Keep them hoes on they knees

Got a cop on my left so I'm riding non-stop
Till I die

See it's time to make ends
Thinking bout how I'ma make it so I'm sitting on rims

But bitch recognize I'm a reckless G
I'm a thief, A raw, I steal for real

Coke dealer fa sho the next connecter coming through
Gotta run the dope can't let the dope run through you
One truth from the start ill leave you stuck in the end
Believe its nothin to him to see you sucking up wind
you've been told now I kept you known go about you business
The risk is live it to your life, and live this
The dreams oversees the world is yours to for
Take what you can get and pass that on to more people
No secrets, no second chances, no paid advances
No snatches, no ranches in Texas and Kansas

And lately I been peepin I been creepin while you sleepin
Instead of seekin like I'm fiend ya for the dope to even keepin it
I'm in a Lincoln thinking throwed cause my homie gets the throwed
Up off the dope, but with a home, sixty G's and twenty fours
Stupid hoes to spit the game, give me the pussy then slang
For your weed and your change and if you bleed then we the same
So we can bust or we can spray, it ain't no trust up in this game

They ain't got me no more, you a woulda coulda shoulda ass ho
I'm so hot, so hot, you know, since I've been home they call me hot sauce
Straight goon, it ain't nothin' to get you knocked off
Foreign with the top off, runnin' since I got out
I can't get that fire head, I'ma cut your ass off
Period, you say I ain't the man then you're delirious
Boosie you just gon' cut me off? I told you I was serious
Told you take the shot, girl, so you can't have no period
But you ain't listen, it's consequences

It ain't nothin' to cut that bitch off

Your ass butt naked, that's why I cut you off

Lyin' to me like I was slow, bitch this ain't The Matrix
I got the naked pictures, yeah the ones you sent to everybody
You was hoin' so much, a nigga couldn't care about you

You thought I was playin' when I cut that bitch off
I'm just tryna get inside that hole like you're golf
Oh that girl too nasty, she gon' suck it 'til it's soft
Runnin' 'round with balls, woulda thought this was lacrosse
You can't tell me ain't the hottest in your city, that I know
I see these niggas hatin' but they love it on the low
Every city that I hit, them bitches, they're in the front row
I asked myself why he mad, but I found out that's his ho, that I know

A lot of these niggas ain't ready ta be no gangsta
So my word of advice to y'all niggas, chill out

Nobody hate me cause they love me.
They know I'm thuggin'
I ain't backin' down from nothin'

I'm from a real street whid real heat called G street,
Cross the trap we fifty deep how the thugs greet.
Bein niggas from fat, skinny,
Ta thin niggas chill out for you be up in that jail house
Mamas ain't bring us up to be no gangstas,
The hood got us all with anger hood got us all in pain.
Niggas throwed on every coner bottle after bottle,
Another kidney gettin' weak, from every swallow.
Thought he was gon' kill one when he bust that choppa.
He let it off and killed wohty, and all his patnas.
Now he locked up in a 6 man cell (gettin' fucked).
When he touch down he a straight up gal.
Wan be a husla ain't even got no street since.
You don't deserve it anyway.
Ain't from that dirty anyway

It's to late to be the dope man (chill out)
Hoes love you till you broke man (chill out)
Watch ya friends real close man (chill out)
They give you life up in court lil' nigga chill out",Chill Out,

so now I'm searchin at the club
so I can find somebody just like me a straight thug
with a heart of a winner who fix me breakfast for dinner
who won't fuss when I get home just let go up in her
that's what I'm lookin for
a girl who far from a rookie bra
but she gotta be raw so all my haters could look at her
so through the door came this click of lil cuties
and I was hopin one of them would like to get with lil boosie
so I picked the rawest one out the click
grabbed her by her shoulder uh and told her this

[Chorus: repeat]

[Verse two]
now on the first day she told me
that we could only be friends
say she was hurt once before by this lil nigga with ends
ran into me bout her problems as she lay on the pillow
told me how her momma died and how her pops was a killer
told me how she lost her virgin to this nigga who lied
broke her heart told her he loved her just to get up inside
that's when we went on a ride to New Orleans
I made her smile the whole time
I laced a bottle with wine and told her this is how it should be
and asked her can have her heart she said could be
I told her bout my lifetime that's when she started to cry
told me she coulnd't believe that I was walkin the life
I told all I want from her is her heart
don't worry bout the sex we can do that when you want start
she ain't want to go home so I let her stay with me
and whispered in her ear right before she lay to sleep

[Chorus: repeat]
[Verse three]

now three months later we majoring back and forth to Las Vegas
smokin on Garcia Vega and my hoes mad
I told them get they shit together now they see all leather

and she was taught by ?Torrance? so she was taught by the devil
wasn't no thug when I met her but I seen it up in her
but she love my thug pleasures so I got me a winner

and when we fuckin she be screamin like I'm touchin her spine
I know I'm touchin her mind cause she ain't never had a thug
who fucked in a suit over the city in a tub
and money don't change her
she stay the same through thick and thin
kept her pussy in her draws when I went off to the pen
that's why I depend she more than a friend

Not wearin a rubber got me stuck now with three kids

Wish I had a real friend to holla

The judge tryin' to send me to the pen
And give me ten
And do me in

You ain't bout that murda' murda' shit
You ain't down to lose yo cool and go and hurt a bitch
We got them hook ups on them rentals now we murkin' shit
Tinted up spinnin' spinnin' let that 30 spit
Bitch do want fuckin' family in black clothes
The bitches in black dresses the niggas in black vo's(u ain't know)
I'm cut throat Kinival Imma buy the bar survival
Sip syrup and smoke fire and I'm wilder(than an average thug)
I'm hard headed my momma told me that
And you got to be real all this drama showed me that
Lose yo mind if you want to(if you want to)
I gotta click of real niggas who gon' stomp you
And want you to be hollerin' bout that iron plate(that iron plate)
And we gon' hit yo street tonight and not the next day
The Tec spray nigga don't worry bout that
They gon' get what they deserve bout that
We gon' cut down they whole curve bout that

[Chorus: x2]
You ain't bout what you be talkin' bout(uh ah)
You ain't ready for yo momma to be walkin' out(uh ah)
That big ass church wit all yo people cryin' hollerin' 'bout (hollerin' bout)
Why you had to take my son thats what them choppas bout(is you bout that boy)

You ain't really bout that shit you be talkin' so quit that talkin' ya heard me
Quit that talkin' and walkin' if you gon serve me then serve me
Now I'm young trill entertainment so know one thang I ain't worried
Cause my family do damage business ain't handled its murda'
Niggas sweeter than skittles so they spittin' in riddles
See that little shit you be spittin' gon' have you sleep in hospitals
And if you beef wit my niggas we gonna really squad up
From choppas to a 6 bitch you can't avoid us
Rappin' bout smokin' that killa don't even smoke killa
Even if you did I wouldn't even smoke witcha
Ya bitch ya fraud ya fake ya muthafuckin' fluke
Pussy all wet ya fuckin' booty all loose
You and them other two niggas duck duck goose
Under the throwback jersey the vest bulletproof
Gangsta shit jump off boy you know you finna run out
Close yo fuckin' mouth fore I rip yo damn tongue out

[Chorus: x2]

You ain't bout layin' under a nigga house like a mouse
And you light his ass up when he come out(when its a drought)
We get sick wit it you heard about lil' Trell
Gunned downed when he was 12 ever since then its been hell
And Webbie they don't live like we live(fuck no)
They don't deal like we deal they ain't real like we real
Look I'm from that track like that bottom of that S.S.B
Whateva' you call it that shit lives in me them niggas kill for free
Like lil' Trell on the lum
Cause you niggas ain't my equal and they hatin' on this lil' thug
A lot of niggas scared of y'all but not me
This for them niggas in rap game who knock me but can't stop me
And my posse is full of thugs
Like Headbussa baby Junior and my nigga Jug
We dumpin' slugs on a enemy
I thought you was my closest friend but now on you just a friend to me
And this fuckin' penitentiary make niggas think they real
But when they get out they got a nerve to pop a pill(but look here)

[Chorus]

They ain't bout what they be talkin' bout you know what I'm sayin'
Niggas be rappin niggas be spittin' but they ain't never do none of that shit
So you don't get no cool points from Boosie (believe that)

Told her no way, look like you be-fo'play
I hit you with this dick and I'm gon' make you run like O.J.
Now they got redbones, blackbones, horses, and stallions
But if you got that fire cat {?} Boosie he ain't gone
You want your bread fire really you can get it
But we linin like we dope and all my niggaz want to hit it
I'm a fool in Mississippi, I'm lovin the hype
Everything I drop it they gon' cop it like I'm Tina & Ike
I got a clique of real niggaz and we ready to fight
And we fo' sho' to hittin somethin at the telly tonight
I'm at the suites with two freaks, I'm slappin 'em on they cheeks
I'm hittin 'em from the back off a David Banner beat
Now I'm skeetin on the sheets, headed to another city
Where we go and get some cat and we ain't gotta pay a penny nigga

Grab that clutch tightly 'cause it might be my night, 
You know we got niggas dying nightly. 
Tonight I'm wit a nice freak. She half white,

Why they hating on me?
Shh. I'm a good nigga believe that
Let's roll

[Chorus]
Tell me why they hating (why they hating)?
Hating on me (why they hating on me?)
'Cause I'm tryna get this paper ('cause I'm tryna get this paper)
Thugging in these streets (thugging in these streets)

Nigga ate at my momma table
My daughter called him uncle (she called him uncle)
I treated him like he was donkey and he told on me
The judge looking like he wanna drop a load on me
My nigga looking like he wanna break the code on me
Tell me why they let me ride for a year?
Now they want my 745 until I show for this here
Nigga tried to sneak me but that's hoe shit
You ain't gonna get no strikes off me little daddy you better try sum more shit
Now he fuck with my girl head
The hoes she be round kept putting her soul down and she can't focus now (un un un)
Ain't that a shame how they fuck up your name
Tell promoters you're gonna cut throat 'em now you're missing your change
Who's gonna take the pistol charges and everybody convicted
Been to 5 funerals in 3 months Lord knows that I miss 'em
I guess when I get old and grey and my mission is done
You pussy motherfuckers you all gonna hate on my son

[Chorus]

From the cradle to the grave I'm gonna always be a hustler
As long as you succeed they gonna always be a buster
They hated Dr.King, they hated when he marched
They hated Malcolm X and they hated Rosa Parks
Sometime your enemy on your passenger side
Riding with you getting high
But you can't believe it
But you know that he sneaky
When I was five my mama looked at her son she said boy
You're gonna break hearts 'cause you're too cute for just one
I guess it's this baby face and rap skills that God blessed me with
Got nigga nuts hanging ready to come and test me bitch but look
You know that say I was dead
2 shot up in my head
Sum say I O.D.'d off that X
What they gonna say next?

[Chorus]

Now they say me and Weebie beef we're on the same team
We drop hits you nosey bitch, we got the same dream
A lot of niggas player hate 'cause they ain't me
So when they mine they won't hesitate to spank me
Done seen a lot of shit Lord knows I try
Rumors hurt me inside but I'm still showing pride
Want diggers like jigga with a brain like dane
Can't slip like beans 'cause I dreams to be the mayne
But I never change no matter how raw it get
I'm beast mode little daddy so I'm prepared for the rawest shit
They called me out my name
They told me I was stunting
I told them one day bitch I'm gonna have some Oprah money

Life story for life story, mane I'm the truth

We started off in the backyard, I'm that boy,
Hate to lose, if I lose, yo can get bruised, 
I'm that hard, life starts from a bad memory,
Daddy loved drugs, can't take this from him, he loved girls. 
Went from neighborhood jackass to neighborhood stacks I-10 riders to I-10 traffickas. 
Imagine us in that bottom on that PCP, walkin' to school wit a tool, 
Who gon' beef wit me. 
Got addicted to sellin' drugs, marijuana and coke,
Momma, she washed her hands, and let me go, the rest you know, 
I ain't gotta explain, I been a man, 
Since I went got my own, now they look at me grown. 
Posted up behind the Cit go ?, on Wyoming 
street,Big sacks, big gats and some artillery.
All the lil niggas got big niggas, like Junior
And B all old niggas showed us ropes like 
They picturin' ? me

You don’t know my struggle, 
So you can't feel my hustle 

Hard times, me and you getting' blisted
Got a dime bag, but we couldn't buy the Philly,
Walkin' to the weed dispenser, we was short on the special.
So we got drunk, snatched purses, man it's whatever. 
Old niggas tried to shortstop, we baller blocked, fuck it. 
Got a big knot,now I'm thuggin' wit a big ugly somethin' on my waistline, 
Bouncin' through the south side
Back then, it was straight gin, Dickies, and cowhides. 
You ain't from our side, we bustin' at ya, that’s the rules
Used to be deep, now we down to just a few. 
Man, I'm talkin' bout them lonely nights, me and my homie on the flight… 
Sneakin' through hoes' window, robbin' niggas for indo 
Runnin' wit nothin' but hard Heads, like Fry thang and Kevin. 
Goin' to clubs reppin', hollin' ""Fuck goin' to Heaven"", 'cause I'm out 
Chyeah, look like my luck fucked up, and I done lost a lotta niggas, 
So my trust fucked up, man

You don’t know my struggle, 
So you can't feel my hustle

You don’t know my struggle, 
So you can't feel my hustle 

Sittin' nights, need my medicine and my needles, 
All the Bondsmen, keepin' it gutta wit my people. 
The thug life, back to back catchin' misdemeanors
The drug life, servin' junkies in front the cleaners. 
The hospitals, nurses tryin' to lift up my spirit, 
My momma preachin', but Boosie boo don’t wanna hear it (hard head). 
You know they say I was dead, two shots up in my head. 
Some say I OD'd off that X, what they gon' say next? 
Grandma died, momma House, lemme talk to ya. 
Niggas hate, but I don’t drive by, I walk to ya. 
High school, four deep in a Monte Carlo
Dusted and disgusted tryna make it til tomorrow. 
When I borrowed, I gave back
When it was beer time, I made stacks, one-ten to one-fifty I shake that. 
The baby momma drama make me wanna holla, plus I lost all my ghetto role models, 
This my struggle man",My Struggle,2006
Lil' Boosie,"Ease your mind a little bit (ease your mind)
Light up that blunt (light up that motherfuckin’ blunt)

That gangster music nigga
And you can try but you ain't Lil’ Boosie nigga no (no)
Bad bitches got you feelin’ great
Looked at my CEO like CEO let’s get this cake, baby
I hit the stage and hoes go crazy, I'm player made
All my hoes got Jordan skills, they fade away
I hit the mall and bought (shit) throwback after throwback
Everybody wanna take pictures they like, “Damn, you Mr. Kodak.”
Smoke comin’ out my sun roof a nigga shining
A nigga love gettin’ pussy love rocking diamonds
If you got kids in this world, nigga, handle your business
And you don’t need no nigga, be independent
It’s murder murder niggas beefin’ niggas slingin’ nines
And I keep that purple purple to ease my mind

Smokin’ on purple ease my mind

I got the raps you got the beats
And we're gonna lay it down real sweet
So you all can ride, head bobbin side to side
I don’t want shit from my fans but this: feel a real nigga’s vibe
When you down and out, don’t nobody trust you
But when you got bread it seem like everybody love you
It’s still fucked up mayne in certain cases (believe this nigga, look)
They still racist, I can see it on them bitches’ faces
That’s why I’m smokin’ and laughin’ I got my grind on
And they don’t feel my struggle they think my mind gone
That’s why it’s murder, murder kill, kill on the corner
These little niggas got big pistols ready to put it on your
So, when you die you might as well be high
Is it heaven or hell or is it all a lie?
That’s why I smoke purple on Monday, purple on Tuesday
Two glocks cocked so they don’t bruise me

Smokin’ on purple ease my mind
This that shit that we get high to, yeah
It's murder, murder, murder gotta keep you nine
This that shit that we ride to, yeah

It's murder, murder, murder gotta keep you nine
This that shit that we ride to, yeah

Smoking on that doja I done got a bag for cheap, nigga
Eyes barely open and I’m glued to the backseat
Boosie took another hit and then he passed it back to me
This shit must got something in it, niggas slipped some crack with weed
Ain't no crack up in the windows I can barely even breathe
Got me fumblin’ and trippin’ almost passed the blunt to Cee
Got it cloudy in the Bentley niggas squinting tryin’ to see
And they don’t know what time it is but I know it’s time to eat
Ridin’ dirty bumping, ridin’ dirty know how that shit be
One day your hear and the next day you going on repeat
With that nine up in my reach right now dyin’ ain’t for me
Mayne this pine got me sleepy but I’m too high to go to sleep
Bust a hooty when you rollin’ potent as you s’posed to be
You be rollin’ and smokin’ ‘em back to back consistently
Keep movin’ dutches to Phillies, garcias, and shisha sweets
Young savage don't really care just put that shit in the air

Smokin’ on purple ease my mind
This that shit that we get high to, yeah
It's murder, murder, murder gotta keep you nine

Round here, there's nothing but thug niggas
Down here, nothing but hard heads
Round here, nothing but straight killas down here
And if you really want to know

[Magic]
I'm from the city of the wickedest, cut throat connivers
We keeps it gutter, till the day that we die
We roam the streets at dark, all we got to survive
Is our hands and our heart, our balls and our word
Just for sitting in my hood, I be screaming until I'm horse
You ever touch one of mine, I'm coming for you and yours
If you ain't got to jack in the murder, you ain't shit
When you hear the blacka-blacka, you know somebody got hit
Hope it ain't none of mine, and if it's mine
I be coming to get you die trying, survival of the fittest
We the sickest no disrespect, but these boys got heart
It could be the dope, but these boys play the part
Murder capital, just a couple years back
In my city, itching to put us right back on the map
When you hear the click-clack, you know it's time to smash
Playa in chest-tolic, catch a bullet in the ass

[Hook - 2x]

[Magic]
I still hustled the block, I keep on cock the 17 shots
I'm a 9th Ward nigga, so I can't be stopped
Fill a X fill a boy, whatever get us high
With money on my mind, so somebody bound to die
Be careful what you say, cause if my people feel played
You bound to get sprayed, hole in your fade
I'm in between your braids, we love cracking domes
We love car jacking, and breaking in people homes
Love concealing weapons, illegal firearms
I'm a felon, ain't no papers on this pistol in my palm
Suicidal, murder mo' common than crawfish
Nigga die, we second line ain't that a (bi-ay-itch)
Nigga got your number, no need to wonder
Who put, lil' whodi under
Crooked ass police force, them the biggest dope dealers
New Orleans made us killas my nigga, you got to feel us

[Hook - 2x]

This for my thug and thugettes, niggas in the ghet's
Throw up your hood nigga, represent your set

[Hook - 2x]

(*talking*)
Look come on, come on, keep it real
No other nigga gon thug like me
Tear up a club like me, whack a nigga for free

You can find me in tha a bay bay
Buckin' full of cry-stale V.I.Ped up
Goin' hard in body tap where they throw that cheese up
I been about my paper niggas know about my stack
You don't like that dirty money send yo girl to wipe me down
Million dollars on my neck and wrist shine for a mile
She wanna see it up close then she gotta walk it out
I'm tha king of this rap shit what the fuck they talkin' bout
Niggas cant sell records so they blame it on tha South
I be all through Shreve-port Louisiana ballin'
Like who the fuck said ain't no choppers in New Orleans
My rims so clean they spinnin' like a world-wind
Pull up at the club bitches textin' they girlfriends
They know who I is they know who I am
I be flyin' through the south in that burgundy land
Pull up at the light my shit so bright
She want my number shit call me tonight
Pick up the phone like

Well its the H to tha U double R I C-A-N to tha E Get em up, Get em up, Get em up like
A bay bay thats what we say when we pull up in them trucks
Tell my label to cut the check I'ma gone spend it up
On the Bentley painted yellow like a baby school bus
26's make em stop when I pull up
And my pants sag low like I was rockin a pull-up
When I stop and I pull up I'ma be already full of Vodka
I keep that in my cup a bay bay on make me bussa
And if you try to take my chain ima snatch yo face off
I got diamonds in my ear the same size as baseballs
Where they at they lost I don't thank they on my level
Lil mama thank I'ma bite her with this alligator sweater
A bay bay was just the beginning im finna run tha game
Whoever feel different can holla at Hurricane
Wanna be talkin' but heavy artillery break up yo chest if you runnin' yo mouth
And every since I dropped that a bay bay I been runnin' the South

The candy lady out of business 'cause they take her goods
Play with me it's guaranteed, ooh, I'm a lay ya down
Gotta watch my back across my tracks god know I know these clowns

God know I know

God got my back so
Lil boosie keep his mind at ease
And god kno I kno

But god kno I'm thug so
U kno lil boosie go and get skeet

Now god know my situation, he know what I be facin'
He know I'm so impatient when it come to money makin'
From school, to the blocks, from the tool, to the rocks
For the lil n**** with that glock ridin' around in somethin' hot
Now it's bout time we hit our knees and tell god truth
Can't stop the way we livin' just help us make it through
When I die take me through, up to heaven up with you
Gotta holla at my daddy and my n**** griles to
And god kno
And god know I'm thug life, u f***in' right
So if n**** play with me of the op I gotta get him right
And god got my back so, when I act wow
I'm comin' home safely through the back do
The murder rate is sky high, n**** holla ride or die
These youngin' sling that iron it ain't no mo takin' pride
So put yo fist up in yo pockets and them bullets in the chamber
'Cause n****s slingin' iron like the lone ranger
Mayne it's murder murder kill kill on the corner 
Where the marijuana followed by the bill
Some n****s cut by delja, some n****s cut by chill 
Some n****s eat them delpids and some n****s eat them pills
Gotta get it how I live in the southside
I'm thuggin' with my cow hide
I'm fresh when I come outside
You talk s*** got hog tied
God know I know these n****s
Don't make me show these n****s
Pray for these n****s keep me away from these n****s
And I

God know I know

God kno all the killas
He done walked with all them n****s
He done talked with all them n****s
Before they went sparked them trigger
He ain't tear ya up in church
But god pretty eyes done covered up some dirt
Plus he kept a thug alert
For these b**** a** n****s, these haters these rapists
These n****s in the swamp swear to god they alligators
Me an my n****s paper chasers (s***) we ain't stuntin'
We do wat we gotta do, to get that money
And god kno my past
I'm itchin' to kill, gimme a reason I will
I'll end up grippin' a steal
And god kno my temper
My temper like a bubble
You bust it you in trouble
Only god kno, it's hard yo, I'll lay up in ya yard wow
I'll camouflage myself with my camouflage cargo
The street ain't promised to us n****s in that dirty south
Thas why I'm ridin' with that nine I'm tryin' make it out
And it's hard to live, I'm a community where ain't no f***in' unity
They always say I'm dead they try to ruin me
So boosie be on other s***
Like jewelris and poppin' chris
And mac on u a model b****
Had a hoe that swallow dick
Since 12 I saw alot of s*** god kno I kno
Witness a man get straight sprayed right in front of the store
So I get a blunt and I roll it, hit the block actin' a donkey
Killin' my own people, servin' my own uncles

And som change to keep n**** fresj kicks on his feet
And god kno he raised me
When donkey went jonsin'
Bronson kept me wide open
And that's a fact
But I kno they gon hate tho
'Cause I got blocks and raps and blocks of work so u can call me lego
It's consequences, jumpin' fences
'Cause the narcs tryin' lynch us and they missin' us by inches
The judge the one who sentence make a n**** out a menace
Commisary low so we take a n**** tennis
A black eye is just like a scratch where I was raised
N****s handle they business if they ever felt played

Not wearin' a rubber got me stuck now with three kids

But she listen to what the streets say
That got me stressin
'Cause she might be leavin' anyday
I try to pray
But when I holla he ain't holla back
That's why I'm missin' prayer daily
Tryin' to get these stacks

The judge tryin' to send me to the pen
And give me ten
And do me in

Plus I hate 2 see you cry, I hate 2 tell you lies, that's y deep inside she be like y you thug me like that.
It's just in me, been doing girls wrong since I stepped off in McKinley.
Hate 2 put my hands on ya cuz I feel bad.
I wear a rubber when I'm fucking but you don't feel that.
They got a lot of women wrong, got a lot of women strong.
But when you got a super star you gotta hold on.
Super star go try 2 fuck all dez hoes yea rite, but when they zip down them bauds everything alright.
My nigga bleek he like: GO HOME 2 YO OL' LADY, SHE CATCH YO ASS SLIPPING SHE GO BUST DAT 380.

Y you thugging like dat.
Cuz I'm boosie badass, if she don't suck it I ain't mad, I can't do nothing but laugh.
I made the girl cook 4 me n don't even cum by, hope this dirty shit don't cum back on taulaijah n I.
I make the girl pussy wet when I look in her eyes so boosie never surprised when he get in them thighs.
I got my heart broke at 14, that was way way back.
So all the girls after that, it was straight pay back.
I like 2 lay back n take trips n dress you up, but when you start mouthing off you messing up.
So shut it up. Would you forgive a real nigga answer that?
Would you still be with him answer that.
If he had another baby put you in a situation would you forgive him or leave him n hate him.

Y u thug me like dat? I swear 2 GOD I don't mean 2, sometimes I feel like I don't need you. [x4]

So if n**** play with me of the op I gotta get him right
And god got my back so, when I act wow

These youngin' sling that iron it ain't no mo takin' pride
So put yo fist up in yo pockets and them bullets in the chamber
'Cause n****s slingin' iron like the lone ranger
Mayne it's murder murder kill kill on the corner 
Where the marijuana followed by the bill
Some n****s cut by delja, some n****s cut by chill 
Some n****s eat them delpids and some n****s eat them pills
Gotta get it how I live in the southside
I'm thuggin' with my cow hide
I'm fresh when I come outside
You talk s*** got hog tied

Thas why I'm ridin' with that nine I'm tryin' make it out
And it's hard to live, I'm a community where ain't no f***in' unity

Im like an american dream 
Role to the green, with the souls and the

Millimeter bullets from the niggas that 
Tryin to do opposite. 
They dont really wanna see how phyco I can get 
I dont really see a mutha fucka stoppin this 
Tryin to come at u and the apocalypse 
.40 cal will have ya screamin, I dont wanna die 
I am becomin nauseous with the fake thugs 
So its love 
To the real G's and all the boss's 
To the niggas in the caller case 
That got into it big 
To get wut nobody gave us 
We was born into this system, so dont be mad at what u made us
Pull the pistol and cock it and bust in the sky 
One time for the U.S, for turnin my niggas to 
gangstas cuz gettin money is what they do best
Hard to fight like I ever did like Al Capone

U can go on feel like ya feel 
Nigga kno the hands I like to kill 
But if u can hit me with the bangs 
Lil cheap for shit, lets strike the deal 
Got my phycos in the city rollin wit me 
Always ready busta cap at the king like du
I can bury ya bodies like an animal 
Because I'm a cannibal, I eat a nigga like food
Rippin thru ur flesh so I can devour the heart 
Music is my playground, but if the rappin dont get yo
I hit this head with the back of the pistol until this bitch nigga lay down
And no competition I had to be fuckin a twig? 
Whoever comin for me gangsta, ima get it everytime I wanna get it

When you miss somebody, you miss somebody
That's how it is (straight up)
I'm a send this out to the few women I was in love with (wassup)

Why do I feel so lonely in a major way?
You know this shit was real and you know it baby
I didn't wanna baby, And it drive you crazy
Even though you gotta man you forever my lady
I miss sipping on your daiquiris
I miss your macaroni and cheese, yes indeed
With no care, I hit you bare, you know wassup
Knowing your body would nut, I taught you everything
Make you cry, make you smile, at the same time
Dumb shit, baby girl I miss your tongue kiss
Miss laying in the bed with you
Miss your people and the soul food they fed a nigga
Most of all I miss you, I'm having flashbacks
Of you coming across the track with your hair wrapped
Miss talking on the phone til' the early morning
Making love off Keith Sweat songs
No one can do me like (you)

I miss kissing on you
You know I miss kissing on you
I miss kissing on (you)
Miss touching on you baby
I miss touching on you
I miss touching on you baby
I can't stop thinking about (you)
I can't stop thinking about you girl
I can't stop thinking about (you)
I can't stop thinking about you girl

It's no mistake that I'm amazing
You kissin touch in lovin my body, the things you do to me
You keep it true to me, all this shit ain't new to me
I been messing with ballers kept me lace in top jewlery
A hood nigga like you yeah I like that
Your swagg on point and you keep it coming right back
When you text I right back, yeah right back
I know you like that, that's why I handle that
Bedroom lights off, we kissin slow to a track
It ain't even bout the sex, I crave the gangsta way you act
When you all up in that, you so smooth with it
That's why I never hesitate to say ""daddy come and get it""
I got my Vicky's on and my Diamond Princess perfume
I can't help but think about the thing we do up in the room
When it's just me and you
A fantasy come true
I can't describe Ooohhh
(I miss kissin on)

I miss kissing on you
You know I miss kissing on you
I miss kissing on (you)
Miss touching on you baby
I miss touching on you

I can't stop thinking about (you)
I can't stop thinking about you girl
I can't stop thinking about (you)
I can't stop thinking about you girl

I swear to god I miss it all
The way that you would call
Beating up your pussy, knocking pictures off the wall
In the studio thinking to myself, ""I got one song left, and I'm coming home to you""
Love it when I hit you from the back and you look back at me
Our sex attractive like metal to a magnet
Turn that T.I. On, that's her shit right there
Get drunk, now she hollering, ""that's her dick right there""
I send this off to the ladies who had my head grown
A pretty black girl, a couple red bones
I guess we learn from each other cause we're stepping-stones
With kids now like ""damn, that's how it is now""
Riding to New Orleans, laughing the whole time
Living life with out a care, walking down Canal
I remember how you smell, the polish on your toes
Remember the first time you went down low
Nobody did it like (you)",Miss Kissin' on You,2009

I been the truth if you don't know betta ask somebody
I am the show and the after party I'm stacking dough
Ain't gotta sell crack no more still on my grind
Got a lot of kids at home gotta get it on late nights
To the early morn 50 grand in my pocket like Ivan Smith
Give back to the hood like Nino Brown neck kinda freezy boy
Believe it you can playa hate but take it easy
We done got the streets me and jeezy learned from the game
How to stack the breezes got love from the hood
So it's all good er both goin eat me
And jeezy riding down the highway (zoom, zoom)
45 on side me (boom, boom) bad chick on side me (ooh, oh)
She roller coaster ride me in the projects
Where ya find I got the whole hood behind
Me my records selling out the stores
Now my money on 4s now you best believe it
They feeling me from Alaska to Tennessee
From the east to the west coast I smoke
What the best smoke we pushing Lambos, Phantoms,
And Bentley coupes now people hollerin' out
The window ay boosie you got the juice now

Brick on top of brick laid my foundation
And I built my house and it was mixtape after mixtapes
And next thang you know I was running the south streets
Introduced me to the trap see that wasn't enough
I wanted the world that was round time my album dropped
And the next thang you know I was running
The world it it what it was was one of the girls
Jeezy wanted one of the girls ima super nigga need a cape
For me real street niggas can relate to me it
Would be a big disappointment
I would hate to be at the wrong place at the wrong time wrong line,
Wrong name, right car but the wrong thang, can't tell me shit
I'ma grown mane 16 years ols wit a old thang didn't eat for days
And months 2 A.K's and a box of blunts if money you want
Then it's money you get hanging wit blow it's money you get ever
Believe that I'd ever believe that I'd ever achieve what I ever achieve

Stop this bitch let me tell the world some
From the bottom to the top shoulda seen that shit me
And my lil' thug gotta it from the mud every thang
I spit I really mean that shit it's crazy
Ain't it hard to explain it I done got famous
All I did was brang it savage life behind the mic now
Everybody hollerin' bout trill entertainment rest in peace
Pimp C I scream that shit every time I do shows you put me on
And I ain't forget so for my nigga
I gotta fuck 2 hoes whateva y'all mean I ain't got cream
You see me in the hood don't thank I can't leave
When I was 19 already and deal y'all other lil' niggas
Y'all jus' selling y'all dreams I ain't through yet
I done done it all got a lot of stuff I been through yet
I fucked up I ain't make it through school
Wanna see if my kids gon' make it
Through that from Miami to L.A. back to Manhattan
Where the big cake from Baton Rouge I done did it gon' ahead admit it
I'ma the shit hey and ion care what a bitch say

And I ain't puttin' no rims on it

I been the truth if you don't know betta ask somebody
I am the show and the after party I'm stacking dough
Ain't gotta sell crack no more still on my grind
Got a lot of kids at home gotta get it on late nights
To the early morn 50 grand in my pocket like Ivan Smith
Give back to the hood like Nino Brown neck kinda freezy boy
Believe it you can playa hate but take it easy
We done got the streets me and jeezy learned from the game
How to stack the breezes got love from the hood
So it's all good er both goin eat me
And jeezy riding down the highway (zoom, zoom)

Now my money on 4s now you best believe it
They feeling me from Alaska to Tennessee
From the east to the west coast I smoke
What the best smoke we pushing Lambos, Phantoms,
And Bentley coupes now people hollerin' out
The window ay boosie you got the juice now

Brick on top of brick laid my foundation
And I built my house and it was mixtape after mixtapes
And next thang you know I was running the south streets
Introduced me to the trap see that wasn't enough
I wanted the world that was round time my album dropped
And the next thang you know I was running
The world it it what it was was one of the girls
Jeezy wanted one of the girls ima super nigga need a cape
For me real street niggas can relate to me it
Would be a big disappointment
I would hate to be at the wrong place at the wrong time wrong line,
Wrong name, right car but the wrong thang, can't tell me shit
I'ma grown mane 16 years ols wit a old thang didn't eat for days
And months 2 A.K's and a box of blunts if money you want
Then it's money you get hanging wit blow it's money you get ever
Believe that I'd ever believe that I'd ever achieve what I ever achieve

Stop this bitch let me tell the world some
From the bottom to the top shoulda seen that shit me
And my lil' thug gotta it from the mud every thang

Lil' Boosie,"Dear God
I ask you to make my heart cold tonight
From all strangers, all bustas, y'know what I'm talking about?

Father God I've been betrayed ('cause I've been betrayed)
Feel like they beat me like a slave 
How many niggas been betrayed out there tonight? (Plenty of times, nigga)
Nigga don't keep it real no more (put your middle finger up!)

After all the fucking shit we done been through,
All the pussy niggas we done tend to,
But it don't mean nothing when a nigga money low,
Nigga'll shoot you in the back and cut yo fucking throat like Rich and alpoe.
Now it's hard for me to trust somebody, family need it they'll steal if they know you got it,
God forgive me I been hurt by a couple niggas 
That's why I wake up say my prayers and be like fuck a nigga,
Bitches want riches so they trying to slide the rubber off trying to get pregnant
When you stupid hoes gon' learn yo' lesson, man it seem like the mo' love you show a nigga,
When it fall off you be like damn did I know this nigga?
I'm glad I rap 'cause these days they testify, nigga ain't catch you wit nuthin' and he got 25,
Just 'cause he say he gon' ride don't mean he loyal dawg, its Cain and Abel again forgive us father God

Father God I been betrayed
Feel like they beat me like a slave
But I learn from my mistakes
We living in the last days, pray for me and make me cold hearted

I been betrayed
Feel like they beat me like a slave
But I learn from my mistakes
We living in the last days, pray for me and make me cold hearted

They criticize me huh
They talk about me bad
Ain't nobody wanna sign me
I had to show my ass
If I love you ain't no question I'd give my last
One day this heart gonna get me zipped up in a bodybag
What about ya first love? Huh she played it cold didn't it?
Made a nigga shed a tear and she changed a nigga
So we fuck 'em and dump'em, never trust'em or love'em
No need for friends, fuck friends, friends turn into bustas
Momma gonna tell ya when that nigga ain't right (momma know!)
Momma know because she pray every night

I done and wash my hands with all this pussy shit
Niggas be hating but boosie boo he hood rich
On top of that I'm a scorpio so I'm unforgivable
First time you fuck with me dog I let them killas go
I'm down and dirty 'cause a nigga heard me
Chief was supposed to be dead but I let him slide 'cause he ain't worthy

Father God I've been betrayed
Feel like they beat me like a slave
But I learn from my mistakes
We living in the last days, pray for me and make me cold hearted

I've been betrayed
Feel like they beat me like a slave
But I learn from my mistakes
We living in the last days, pray for me and make me cold hearted, cold hearted

Feel like somebody burning candles on me
That's why that choppa and my Phantom and my house got all them cameras on it
Know I'm standing under the light
So I just try to do right
Ain't been in church, but I pray every night
It's like I used to didn't give a fuck
But over the years I dun learned and I dun got out here
And earned so much to live for
My niggas tell me slow it down for real, you need to chill bruh
Stay up on your grind, take your time, bring your kids up
My grandma told me look at you look what the streets done did to ya
Alot of niggas done changed on me, I came up they switched up 
My daughter almost died, man it all seem wrong
The only thing good is my dog came home
My mind gone, my heart mad, my soul so pissed
I think my niggas tried to rob me, that's some fucked up shit
Blowing killa when I ride, in my mirror when I ride by
Can see some niggas doing a coward-ass drive-by
Some of these pussies really think that they got nine lives
You might as well don't even bust back, this bitch a hunnid shots
And we been getting it by the pound
You know we blunted out
Something fancy stunted it out, throwin' money out

Father God I been betrayed
Feel like they beat me like a slave
But I learn from my mistakes
We living in the last days, pray for me and make me cold hearted

I been betrayed
Feel like they beat me like a slave
But I learn from my mistakes
We living in the last days, pray for me and make me cold hearted, cold hearted",Betrayed,2010

She catch three, I catch two, now I'm sleepin' in
Ms. Virgina take her time when she hit that head
She pull her long hair back and sit between my legs
Blow your mind when you got a dime
Who rub your nuts when you fuck her from behind

Got me sneakin' out da house like a fuckin' mouse
And that pussy so wet for me

Freaky bitch eat the dick while I'm playin' Madden
Move my chain and give me brain, that's a chain reaction
Drop my top and let her lick, lick, lick my lollipop
Lay on your stomach girl (just like this), toot that ass up (toot it up)
Bite the pillow while a real nigga smash her
Pussy wet year round, that's that Seattle pussy
One call this all I gotta have da pussy
Misses studio time, tellin' my niggas lies

If you a press rewind if I ain't have shit, make a nigga wonder sometime fa real
(ohhh oooohh do it againnnn, do it againnn)

Now if I ain't have shit would she still love, a nigga hair all nappy underarms musty,
If I wasn't boosie bad ass would she still fuck me,
Tell the truth would me n you ever had an discussion,
Would you do it again, get away from all your friends,
Would you still be happy if I ain't have no bens sometimes I ask myself,
Would she forgive me for them other kids I had on her long night on the corner all the nights
I jumped on her, chill mama but mama just a little girl,
I'm seventeen he fifteen we having a little girl, she keep it guttah gotta give her dat,
She say she tired but if she tired tell me why she ain't leave yet,
Never had a job over a week I really spoiled her when we go eat she Beyonce and I'm Sean Carter,
If I worked at burger king and approached you smelling like onion rings would she do half the things she done to me

[Chorus]
If I couldn't give you the finer thangs,
The money and the whips and the diamond rings
Would you do it again
I wanna know, I wanna know
Would you do it again
I wanna know I wanna know
And if I didn't have my baller status
And if you didn't have the seven ?
Would you do it again
I wanna know I wanna know
Would you do it again
I wanna know I wanna know


If she brought me home to her mama,
She disagree with her decision,
Would you wild out if she threatened to put her child out,
Would she still go get them birds for me slang that syrup for me be at court extra early for me
(sometimes I ask myself) put her on her first plane,
Told her do her thang took her to emmitt five g's on a pinky ring,
If I wasn't Boosie boo would she ride for me,
Would she had laid down took that pain and have that child for me,
She kept it real from the start she ease my brain, was it the chain,
Was it the game, was it the name,
She stayed faithful that's why I love her through thick n thin,
Made visits n commissary when I hit that pin,
I had my homework she had her homework,
She went from drawers to thong work I'm a fool with it,
If I worked at mickey d's and hooked you up with a number three would you be nice and give your number to me

[Chorus]

With all the money I got and all the whips that I buy
If I ain't have nothing would you still be by my side,
If I ain't have this status no purple just reggie
If I ain't have no daddy I'd be diggin ?,
I'll still be selling off the store no fresh golds no fresh clothes no bad hoes
Sad hoes girl would you still be my hoe,
No Fendi no Prada no Gucci can't buy 
That would you still lay under me at night time in the projects,
No diamond chains from emmit a Honda no Bentley,
Would you still go low if I ain't have this image no sean john cologne no deodorant my odor strong,
Would I fuck these red bones if I ain't have my bread long,
Rewind my lifetime you prolly wouldn't have fuck me,
No showers on my grind you prolly wouldn't have suck'd me,
Just rewind my lifetime you prolly wouldn't have fuck'd me
No showers on my grind you prolly wouldn't have suck'd me

Lil' Boosie,"I lost my daddy at fourteen, I lost Trell at twelve, life in jail.
Ain't it funny how the money makes you separate the real and fake?
I started off small time victim of the game, a Monte Carlo to a Bentley and a diamond ring.
I got fame but mayne my whole world changed.
Some niggas left me in the rain, my girls changed, they changed on me!
I thought I got lucky, two hundred G's took my grandmother from me.
I hit my knees (Why lord?!) I tried syrup I tried weed I couldn't cope nigga.
Head down crying tears at the hospital.
A broken home, tried to get my hustle on nigga killed Lil Ivy my soul gone.
I bought my mama a house she cried instantly, all that shinin got my niggas in penitentiary!

[Chorus:Repeat x2]
I can clearly see the sunshine, but I'm steady walking through the rain!

[Lil Trill:]
Still got hatred in the city after all that we done 
Did all the toy give always school clothes and things.
Even for Easter givin the kids bikes 
And for that they ain't cryin up in Carroltyn now that ain't right.
We still smile though cause of the sunshine, wonder what I'll do if I could press rewind.
I done seen a lot half both sides of the field, the best of both worlds and yeah I'm for real.
Mama got seven kids with pops I stand alone.
I'm walking through the rain but still I move on, I just started so right now I'm far from done.
I keep moving on until I see the full sun.
Patiently waiting but the best is still yet to come, 
I guess things happen for a reason when its said and done.
Say Lil B keep your head up just take it serious bra 
Keep your faith in God cause he's the one who lay at us.

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Diabetes steady eating my insides fucking my vision up I swear to God I feel like giving up.
Some times I'm laughin' with my money machine, but they trying to put me on dialysis machine.
I-v's in my arms, I know I'm doing wrong no insurance back to early can't long.
Being a daddy only thing that make me happy, I'm tired of getting sick same thing for young savage.
I try to do right and help my community police still kicking at my door Dirty motherfuckers.
You probably think I got the world at my hands, but really dog I got the world on my shoulders!
When I look at your son I see your face homie 
(Lil Ivy) everybody pray for me cause they hating on me.
Wish I could take it all back sometimes, truth is I don't even like to rap sometimes.

Lil' Boosie,"OK this what I learned from the streets
Handle your beef
Your playing with keys
Sleep with your heat
Your a role model if partner gotta be me
All hoes ain't sweet, they messing
Everything happens for a reason but they all lessons
If you stressed then pick your head up, nigga,
Get your bread up, nigga,
If your scared, scared niggas get they head bust
I make you catch a heart attack, in starter hats
Just left downtown I got my forty back
A situation started, nigga I'm never smiling
Beast mode until they take me, got that from mobbing
Any nigga who watch you up and down want something you got
Why my enemies iffing me got that from pop
If I flop then it's back to selling blocks
Back to telling niggas they can't hustle in my spot, off the top
My daddy raised me to hate a cop
So all my motherfuckin' life, I hated cops
Cam rich told me niggas change when you give them blocks
Nigga told me when I ride better keep it cocked

[Chorus]
This what I learned from the streets
Keep it real lil' nigga
Keep your steel lil' nigga
Fuck these hoes lil nigga
Forgot your roles lil' nigga
This what I learned from the streets
Watch your back lil' nigga
Keep it strapped lil' nigga
You lil' axe lil' nigga
A real gutter nigga and your nuts a lil' bigga

People rose around me
Money is money so concentrate when you count it
Every nigga who bounce ain't no gangsta ass nigga
And I learned that from riches
Spoil all the dope fiends
I learned that from pitchas
Fred city show me how to roll that killa
Big Loton show me how to come with rhythm
Ever since then I've been the sickest in the system
Dunking down on Jacobs took me on my first mission
I jumped out bustin' fuck it you ain't saying nothin'
Ivy showed me how to cook it up and get it hard
Put me on this jewelry shit I miss my boy
Look, no matter how good you treat em
That dope will make em do evil learn that from that clown jeefers
These nigga turning on they own people
These niggas devils out here

[Chorus]

The streets told me boy gutter keep that thang on ya
And fuck your friends cause most niggas still change on ya
These streets cold so you gotta keep that heater close
Might be your boy that's tryin' burn u, dog you never know
Man look these hoes ain't no better they be vulchers too
I crossed one of those niggas and I ain't crossing u
Just keep it G and have some game like the bosses do
Know you the shit but homie keep em flies off of you
Keep your mouth all open shut when people talk to you
You don't know shit no matter how much time they offer you
Don't stop until you got enough to a vault or 2
And know one thing there's a slight chance you'll take a loss or 2
Keep your eyes open and you'll get all the way to the streets
It's money over everything till you rest in peace
Keep your eyes open and you'll get all the way to the streets
It's money over everything till you rest in peace

Gladiators on deck
Drug user, don’t drink sprite
And when I do, it ain't pink sprite
A lot on lean, it’s purple
Trust issues, don't trust really
No two point conversion
Won't run it after I touch down
My punter kicking, its defence

Where was you when I was slumped over
Gums hurting from a old bullet
In front the toilet while hunched over
Puking all of my insides
Stab wounds from a old friend
Well at that time we were close friends
They said I killed him in cold blood
We wrestled for the gun but the gun went off
He up’d the pistol looked him dead in his eyes
I’ve been ready to die so nigga do it
Gates ride, I really do it
I’m serious too nigga, really do it
Turned his head, closed his eyes
Aimed the tool, started shooting
I didn’t die, my life a movie

Erin really my best friend
And I was loving her best friend
Bright Brittany with the long hair
You know (?) lil sista
She stole a Jag for her to come and get me
I was buying dope
In and out the system
Brandy fucking my nigga Ray
At the same time
He fuckin' cold sweatin'
He the track coach
And a asshole
Know that didn't have shit to do with this
I was just stating the facts though
Jessica round me, talking sexually bout me
She bend over in front me
From the back while I'm pounding
Now it's over
Bitch get up and get out
I mostly likely forgot to mention
But we was in my trap house
Just brainstorming, in the game for me
These thoughts and the ideas
No regrets for the shit I did
That also mean for the niggas I killed

I'm tricken every single car I get
I'm tricken every single car I get
I'm tricken every single car I get
I'm tricken every single car I get

On top of glass, covered in black, tell 'em I'm tippin'
Losing control, I'm lane to lane, you would swear I was slippin'
Prolly cause I told Edgar to spray 'em til he drippin'
Now paint wet, your bitch wetter
Got diamonds flood my necklace
Gettin' headshots I called that murder to go ride slow like it's Texas
Got a attitude, that don't give a fuck
About 50 plus when I jet this
No test drive I let her go out nor I bet you hate that she meet this
I flex and pull these lights out
This mouthpiece I got iced out
I'm tricky bitch I'm racked up
Be damned if I get priced out
These haters ain't gon' say shit, they do they gon' get wiped out
Do my donuts in broad day, full speedin' with all my pipes out

I chopped the top off a hard top
I tricked the interior out with mink
Then I add the shoes on the feet
You can hear my car comin' up the street
I'm tricken every single car I get
I'm tricken every single car I get
I'm tricken every single car I get
I'm tricken every single car I get

Gotta have a drop top, Lousiana a hot spot
If it ain't a drop, I send it to Cali and get it chopped
50 heads stay cocked, so you can see the razorline
Former d-boy I remember I used to break them down
Paint wet, ooh kill 'em like that
Boosie ride foreign and I paid 400 flat
Four 12's in the back, gotta have a little noise
Four deep on the mollies, we some real Geto Boys
In my yard, several cars, send 'em to my esé
Spray that thang candy but might wreck the whip next day
Peanut butter inside, covered up in plastic
Stash spots everywhere, ride fly everywhere
Boosie!

I chopped the top off a hard top
I tricked the interior out with mink
Then I add the shoes on the feet
You can hear my car comin' up the street
I'm tricken every single car I get
I'm tricken every single car I get
I'm tricken every single car I get
I'm tricken every single car I get

I'm in the hood, bitches yellin' they love me
Get in this coupe you gon' be naked with body like Buffy
Why every time I hit the block niggas faces get ugly
Tell them haters I'm on my game and it ain't nothing above me
I live my money, get reckless
You seen that bitch that I just got
I Lil Wayne'd her, no ceilings
Can't cool me down bitch I'm too hot
Can't change up, I got change up
I got shit on lock and they chained up
Bout 20 goons and they aimed up
Bitch, play with me, you get banged up
I'm in this Lambo
Artillery like Rambo
Don't fuck with me, I'm prime time, don't get your whole show cancelled
Every thang gotta do get tuned in, tell 'em hoes I'm on now
This whip might do bout 200, tell 'em hoes I'm gone now

I chopped the top off a hard top
I tricked the interior out with mink
Then I add the shoes on the feet
You can hear my car comin' up the street

I'm tricken every single car I get

Since the All-Star game and I'm still tryin' to hit it 
Got a baby for this nigga that I used to sell things 
He caught a fed case and he ain't leave her no change 
She sold all his jewels she sold all his cars 
Now she dancing in the shaker club stripping for the stars 
Sliding down the pole slow drop it to a split 
Pussy popping on a handstand man she the shit 
She still looking tight though 
Still built right though 
Run my game right and after the club 
She might go back to the telly with me 
Shake her jelly with me 
Let my people bust on her face and her belly with me

[Hook :x 2]
In the ghetto, I'm living in a ghetto world
In the ghetto (in the ghetto), it's a struggle but I gotta maintain

[Trae]
Welcome to the ghetto, where forever be the same
Hard times, got my people unable to maintain
Everytime I look around, it's somebody doing bad
That'll put you in the grave, for som'ing they never had

Everyday in the hood, it be the same thang
Poverty running my people, so they love pain
And I don't know if it's wrong, but still I know it ain't right
I seen a lot of people die, in the street life

The other day it hit my heart, when I watch the news
A lil' girl got killed, while she was 'sleep in her room
And she ain't deserve to die, cause that's a kid dog
Them niggaz took the life, that she ain't get to live at all

Sometimes I want to help the ghetto, but it ain't gon do a thang
'Cause I know that they ignant, and that's a god damn shame
It's an everyday task, trying to live a good life
Inside of the ghetto, where everybody be shife

[Hook: x 2]

[Yung Redd]
Welcome to the South, niggaz ain't sleep at all
Everybody out on the block, stay ducking them laws
A couple niggaz on parole, hustling by the sto'
I'm telling that ain't the way to go, play your role

But you don't hear me though, this what I'm living fo'
Hustle till I get mine, grind cause I need mo'
Shots release, too late for you to scream peace
This how it is in the street, leaving is obsolete

And still I maintain, seeing the same thang
Sometime I scream, my brain just looking for a change
But day in and day out, I move in and move out
Keep my bidness discrete, I'm on a paper route

I wasn't broke for nothing, still I was learning some'ing
If you ain't been through nothing, then you ain't seen nothing
This how it really is, around my way
Where anybody can get it, anytime of the day

[Lil Boss]
I analyze the block, babies are running round with glocks
Dope in they socks, can't skip hot so fuck the cops
Moving from crumbs to bricks, nigga these slums are thick
I try to tell my lil' niggaz, but they think they slick

These white folks don't play, they gon hot your way
They try to give you twenty years, just for living the wrong way
And who's to say now-a-day, right from wrong
They ain't living how we live, so they can't get in my zone

We get chased home for stones, and laws want to break our bones
In places in and out a high cell, to roam
And that's prolly the reason, we going crazy
Pissed at poverty, cause the system trying to fade me

Lately, I've been trying to stay out of trouble
But it's hard to stop from copping, the sack and flipping the double
Don't catch the wrong route, when you on that Metro
There's a sign in front of the hood, that says Welcome To the Ghetto

[Hook: x 2]

[Spice 1]
I wonder, if heaven got a ghetto
But be	-burning down the be	-block, I put the petal to the medal
Running with my cousins in Texas, Lil' Cross and Big Money
My nigga Trae and Lil' Joe, nigga all action

In the ghetto, I've been riding through the hood for years
And ain't a damn thang changed, mama still shedding tears
Niggaz fresh out the Penn, some niggaz just going in
Some niggaz gon run and stutter, turning they self in

Never seen a black man, flying dope on a plane
But they lock us up for it, shackle us with chains
Welcome to the ghetto, ghetto starts and mob cars
With bullet holes in it, niggaz shot up and scarred

But still living, driven by the game itself
To stay alive in these cold streets, mashing for wealth
Up in this ghetto, O.G.'s P's and see's
Thugs, pimps, playas hit the 6-4's or 3's

It's a new day and time but shit
It ain't all good but shit it ain't all bad no mo' either doe
Why'knahmsayin'? I'm tryin' to keep it civilized
But motherfuckers keep fuckin' with me doe mayne

In case you don't know my name, I'm 'bout to tell you my name
Z-Ro the crooked, 'King of Da Ghetto' all about my change
I remember when Joseph wasn't able to have thangs
Now I'm able to flip a 300-M and grab grain
There's some niggaz mad at me 'cause I got cash mayne
I'm the future of rap-a-lot, quit livin' in the past mayne
Remember flippin' with a brick, in the dash mayne
Now every time I roll up bitch give me bomb-ass brain

Probably be somebody, baby momma, I ain't ask mayne
Baby, daddy got a problem, we can hit the grass mayne
An asshole by nature, livin' in the fast lane
Stay rilla fo' reala, fuck with me and that's yo' ass mayne

Ain't got a diploma, but got knots of cash mayne

Don't wanna hurt nobody, just get me through my day
Don't wanna hurt nobody, just leave me the fuck alone
Don't wanna hurt nobody but a nigga might fuck around

I guess they never seen a guerilla when he stompin' and pissed
But they 'bout to see a young guerilla, whoop, they ass with his fist
I tried to move around, motherfuckers roachin' and shit
My attitude, fuck, watch how you approachin' me bitch
Asshole and ain't gon' fake it 'cause I had it by nature
And that's the result of everywhere you go niggaz hate ya
And I ain't trippin', I'ma catch one of them marks on the back street
With the black heat, slugs run up like a track meet

I'm an anybody killa, but everybody can get it
Servin' suckers in neighborhoods got it crackin' like a stick
I didn't come to hurt nobody but you bumped into mine
But we gangsters I pull a fo' and told you po' out that wine
If I wanted flex, I coulda got a strap at that moment
I'd rather keep ca-cash, ca-cash, 'cause I'm already wanted
I'm an asshole by nature, my flag's on the left side
Gave him a pass before I stepped [Incomprehensible] side

Don't wanna hurt nobody, just leave me the fuck alone
Don't wanna hurt nobody, just get me through my day
Don't wanna hurt nobody, just leave me the fuck alone
Don't wanna hurt nobody but a nigga might fuck around
And bust your brain

Now I don't wanna hurt nobody, but that's a lie
Cause it's a delight for me to bust a lip or black an eye
Or smoke a nigga like a syrup covered black 'n' mild
So don't fuck with me when I'm tryin' to make money stackin' piles
Some niggaz trie to rob me before, try to jack me now
Fuck Danny Glover, I'm the lethal weapon with maxi nine
Can't a nigga lavish any mo'?
Without a gang of niggaz and they kickin in his do'?

And nine times out of ten it'll be one of my friends
That'll lead me to my grave, murder me to get my ends
Do the crime and make a cape escape from my residence
But still show up at my funeral services 'n shit
I ain't fin' to let it happen to me, you gon' respect me
Ain't gon' be no bad actin' with me, homie
And to you haters I'm a waiter waitin' to serve somebody
I kill all you motherfuckers but I

Don't wanna hurt nobody, just leave me the fuck alone

Smokin' on some shit outta 'Frisco, I just copped it
Bust a cigarillo, then lick it, seal it and lock it

I was raised on the corner with a holster rocket
You talkin' bout shows, I'm supposed to rock it
Muthafuck going to court and they fuck ass dockett
Catch me runnin' through a red light, roof all open
Ridin' candy slab with the coupe all pokin'
Arm on my hammer, I can't even much lie to ya
Niggas 'll pull up and serve yo ass your talapia
Nigga, where the weed at? I'm headed to the drank house
Catch up with a couple of homies and have a drank out
Diggin' in my pocket for my dice, pullin' my bank out

Matter of fact I think was in Chicago, you know what I'm sayin', on my bus

But they do a lot of things they try to, you know
Throw a teddy bears at me, they try to kiss me, grab me
Grab my Mickey Mouse chain
I almost lost that so many times, ah

But uh, you know, I mean that's how it is, you know

Hard not to want to touch-that's what the girl's say
They run up tryna to give me a kiss

They say, ""No you're not,"" then they start crying

You can copy but' it's only gonna be one me
I don't ride no cars till a man come with me
14 And I started up a whole epidemic
Look, ya'll know what I'm talkin about
Ever since I hooked up with the homie down south
TV shows, Magizine covers
Girls in groups sayin, ""We go with each other.""
Sold out shows pocket full of cake
What you know about selling tres mill out the gate?
I'm the hottest thing around
Neck full of bling, bling like neptune sound
I got it locked on the left, right, front and rear
When I step in the spot this all I hear

I said lil' Bow Wow You just don't
The way you move so fast across the floor
I mean you run through my mind like all the time
To the point that I just wanna take ya home
I said lil' Bow Wow You just don't
The way you move so fast across the floor
I mean you run through my mind like all the time
To the point that I just wanna take ya home

Right now, when I'm old, where I'm gonna be
How I flow, homie you can bet the house on me
I'ma forever be up under the scope
I ain't tryin' to go out like Todd Bridges off Different strokes
I was born to rock, born to rhyme
What you lookin' at is somethin' that's before their time
Like the number 2-3 in red and black
Mr. 106 and park is back HOLLA
I do it like no other
And I attract more family than Ringling Brothers I
Got'em scattered, covered, smothered like hash browns
See I'm the best just ask around
I'm here now and ain't nobody takin' mine
It's a waste of time if yu thinkin'you can
You betta off gettin'a shirt makin' a sign that reads
""Shad Moss"" I'm your number number one fan

I said lil' Bow Wow you just don't know
The way you move so fast across the floor
I mean you run through my mind like all the time
To the point that I just wanna take ya home
I said lil' Bow Wow You just don't
The way you move so fast across the floor
I mean you run through my mind like all the time
To the point that I just wanna take ya home

Represent that

I said lil' Bow Wow you just don't know
The way you move so fast across the floor
I mean you run through my mind like all the time

Lil' Bow Wow,"If you ever brought a tape
Purchased a CD
Of a piece of vinyl
DJ'd my record
Promoted my record
I want to thank y'all man
From the bottom of my heart
Secondly I want to
Dedicate this song to y'all
Cause without y'all
There is no me
(Lil' Bow Wow:)
I can never turn
My back on y'all
Cause y'all put me
Where I'm at
So when ya call
I'll be there just like that
Signing autographs 
Giving dash to all my folks
Telling little kids
""Don't follow this dopes""
See I'ma keep barking and
Cause y'all bark wit' me
You know the website
All ya gotta do is hit me now
As much as the girls like me
You would think
You'd make the fellas sick
But they'd be right wit' 'em
Singing not listen the lick
Hair braided
Rockin' somebody's jersey
From up top that out west
And down in the dirty
Can't forget about the mid-west 
That's where I was found
That's where I live
That Columbus is the town
I got the paint, you got the paper
A CD, and tape
I signin' and be able to get
A nice big plate of fish
Which is my favorite dish
But without y'all
I couldn't kick it like this

There wouldn't be no me
And that's why
I'm gonna rock for you
Forever more

I want to thank you
For the proofs that
Came before me
All of y'all and the office that
Promote me on the street 
All the mom and pops gone

The first one to sell it
All the mix show DJ's
Please keep it pumping
Thank you for your support
And yes, I'm gonna
Keep it coming
I love how you love that
So I'm giving back
Cause y'all the ones that
Kept this player on track
The reason I'm seeing is
Because of you
The reason I'm heard and
My dreams came true
Now if you ever made a poster
Or wrote a fan letter
All I'm tryin' to do is
Show you some L-O-V-E
And let you know without y'all 
There is no me
J.D., J.E., the whole S.S.D.
Now if you rock for we
Then I'ma rock for you

West coast, bark on
(Come on)
East coast, bark on
(Come on)
Dirty South, bark on
Yeah

All young girls beware
This pup's off the chains
I'm gritty little something here
Putting down pain
Since I was six
Running with the pound
It's been going down
I'm city to city, town to town
They running up screaming my name
Running up grabbing my chain
Running up tryna get in the game
I'm like ma don't get it twisted
If we kick it get your bark on
Hope to God you see me again, when I'm grown
Type of playa but it ain't
It just sounds like that
Cause I'm just too young to get down like that
(I agree)
Hit the movies, hit the mall
Then come out with big bags
Next day do lunch then head Six Flags
But it don't mean nothin we're just having some fun
Even though I may have told you on the ride you're the one
I'm sorry little shorty I gotta take that back
Cause I'm just too young to get down like that
So

Even if you're three years older than me
And caught yourself noticing me
In my mind, set don't change
I might up my game
But the story that I tell 'em
When I tell it, it remains the same
You wouldn't believe how they be coming at me
Steady, steady tryna throw something at me
Like I'mma get happy
Just because honey got her learner's permit
Can come and scoop me after school
Like I'm supposed to be on it
Naw ain't no sippin' over here
It's Big Pimpin' over here
And I hope that I make myself clear
That when it comes to honeys yo I got some minutes
And I ain't tryna get serious till I'm up in my twenties
It's just the paper that I'm after
The drop with the top I'mma cop when I'm able
And that's all that matters
So if I told you something shorty
I'm taking that back
Cause I'm just too young to get down like that

But something about you is so irresistible

Don't you try and tell me that he's not my type
To hide what I feel inside
When he makes me weak with desire
I know that I'm supposed to make him wait
Let him think I like the chase But I can't stop fanning the fire
I Know I meant to say no

But he's irresistible 
Up close and personal 
Now inescapable

More than just physical 
Deeper than spritual
His ways are powerful
And irresistible to me 
(Yeah yeah, I can hardly breathe)

Don't you think I'm trying to tell my heart what's right
That I should really say goodnight
But I can't stop myself from falling
Maybe I'll tell him that I feel the same
That I don't want to play no game
'Cause when I feel his arms wrapped around me
I know I meant to say no

But he's irresistible (irresistible)

I really find it hard to breathe

They might come close but you and I both know they can't see me
I'm a So So Def representative
Young niggas in the game they was born to live
And we do what we do, we don't talk no smack
And we always know where the party at, bling (bling bling)

Ay, where the party at? (Tell 'em)
Girls is on the way, where the Bacardi at? (J.E. y'all)
Models and models, talkin' all of that
Know I can't forget about my thugs (C'mon)
(Where the party at?)
And all my girls (Yeah)
(Where the party at?)
Up in the club (Uh, yo)
(Where the party at?) (Tigah)
If they party's where you're at, let me here you say

Man I rip flows, get dough everytime I rip shows
Rip hoes, when we mash out in Chevy's and fours
Niggas know they ain't heard it like this before
Whenever we pull up on the strip they like ""Oh!""
Chickens know me, hundred dollar mac and shorts
Tank tops and Polies
If it's 'bout cash, I'm gas chick, I'm on E
On e'rything
Me and Jagged, everytime we hit the club
This nigga's off the chain!
You can believe that
And if you don't, come on down here where you can see that
Anything you wanna be, best believe I be's that (oh)
Where the G's at?
Where the keys at?
Where the twenty-two's on them SUV's at?
Gotta have that from the do'
And gotta get me some mo'
Man you think I'm goin' on a groupie, no
Spot me with a fifth in the velvet room
Crown Royale while J.E. spit this velvet tune
It's over (over)

 If the partys where your at just let me know
 Don't be trippin when you see us in the club
 Just show a little love, represent your side like me
 'Cause 'round here if you slick you pick a hot one
 Ride shotgun, couple of 'em got one
 Belvedere in the rear of the club
 Pulled up on dubs and we 'bout to go and buy the bar up
 So So, for sure we ain't playin
 Hang with no lames, hit the park and sayin...

 If the party's where you're at just let me know
 All the girls in the club in they best outfits
 Just showin that skin, tryna' make a nigga want to spit
 Where you been girl? You and your friend
 Need to come to the back where we got it locked down
 In your white t-shirt or a three-piece suit
 Don't matter what you wear all that matters is who you with
 Some jiggy and some are straight grindin
 All up in the club just to have a good time and
 [Hook]

 Just show me where that party at dirty
 Somewhere where it's crackin right around one-thirty
 Never get done too early
 Come in as is, doo-rags and Tims
 I'm rollin past his, his little Jag and Benz
 With the Rolls, not the one with the stem (the one with the rims)
 The one that seem to make more enemies than friends
 I'm slidin in past doors, both eyes closed
 Both arms rose, both charms froze
 With the S-O-S-O, D-E dot F
 I'm buyin bottles, bottles, until it ain't none left
 I'm quick to go left, I blaze with no rep
 I jams more than def, baby show me the club
 I'm like ""hey, where that Bacardi at?""
 Come and mix it with the Cris', baby, what's wrong with that?
 We in the V.I.P. twisted, down right spliffed it
 Two way and shit, ooh they makin like they missed it

 Left side, just put your hands up, throw 'em up
 Right side, just put your hands up, throw 'em up
 Everybody, put your hands up, throw 'em up
 When the beat come back around e'rybody do it again
 Do the eastside run this mutha for ya? (Hell yeah)
 Do my southside run this mutha for ya? (Hell yeah)
 And them haters ain't hittin on, ain't talkin 'bout us
 And they look like
