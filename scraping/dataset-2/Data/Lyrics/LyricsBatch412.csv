Janie Fricke,"There's no way to know how this is all gonna end
We fell in love once we could fall again
It makes no difference how it all works out
This night with you is all I'm thinking about

Don't worry 'bout me, baby, I'll be alright
Don't worry 'bout me, baby, just love me tonight

Don't be afraid that you might make me cry
Don't worry 'bout leaving or telling me lies
How can I make you understand?
If I can't have it all, I'll take all I can

Don't worry 'bout me, baby, I'll be alright
Don't worry 'bout me, baby, just love me tonight

This can't be wrong, I know that it's right
So as long as it's good, keep holding me tight

Don't worry 'bout me, baby, I'll be alright
Don't worry 'bout me, baby, just love me tonight

Janie Fricke,"Tell me a lie
Say I look familiar
Even though I know
That you don't even know my name
Tell me a lie
Say ya just got into town
Even though I've seen you here before
Just hangin' around

Umm, tell me a lie, say you're not a married man
Cause you don't know I saw you slip off your wedding band

Tell me a lie
When you take me home
Tell me a lie
I don't really want to spend the night alone
Tell me a lie
Don't worry about my sorrow
You'll be long gone tomorrow
And you won't have to see me cry
Just tell me a lie

Ooh, tell me a lie
When our night is almost over
And make believe that it's for real
The way you want me to
Come on, tell me a lie
When you're lying close beside me
And whisper when you hold me
Sweet words, ""I love you""

Janie Fricke,"We've had a lot of conversations
We've analyzed our situation
There's only so much that words can say
After awhile they just get in the way

So lets stop talking about it
And start getting down to love
Lets stop talking about it
We've already said enough

Can't we stop talking about it
I can't take any more
I'm ready, yes I'm ready
So what are we waiting for

We covered all there is to cover
Its clear that were wanting one another
Well, lets give our feelings a chance to be heard
A moment of passions worth a thousand words

So lets stop talking about it
And start getting down to love
Lets stop talking about it
We've already said enough

Can't we stop talking about it
I can't take any more
I'm ready, yes I'm ready
So what are we waiting for

Janie Fricker,"It seems funny I remember your number 
After all this time 
And I know that it's late 
And I hope that I'm not out o' line 

But for some crazy reason 
I bin thinkin' 'bout you all day 
And every three hours now 
I bin thinkin' of somethin' to say I

love you like a fool 
Always have, always will 
But you know that it's just my point of view 
But I love you still 
Always have, always will 
Always have, always will love you 

Well now, are you sleepin' any better 
Now that I'm gone 
And I want to know who's holdin' you tight 
Or are you just holdin' on 

You're awfully quiet, I guess you're tired 
So I'll hang up the phone 
But you know that this ol' heart 
Can't leave well enough alone

I love you like a fool 
Always have, always will 
But you know, yes you know that it's just my point of view 
But I, I love you still 
Always have, always will

Janie Fricker,"Surely you can sit down a while
Maybe you can even smile
And I'll try to pretend that you love me again
But it might take me a little while

I know you'll be holding me tight
You know when the moment is right
When I was broken in two, it was all because of you
But baby, I need you tonight

And it ain't easy being easy,no
You're the one who took my heart and my soul
Walked away and left me out of control

No, it ain't easy when you're needing someone
And it ain't easy being under the gun
And I'll surrender even though I should run

I might end up lonely again
But once you were my only friend
So I'll hold you and cry with the truth in my eyes
Hoping you'll love me again

Janie Frickie,"From thirty thousand feet above the desert floor I see it there below 
A city with a legend, the West Texas city of El Paso 
Where long ago I heard a song about a Texas cowboy and a girl 
And a little place called Rosa's where he used to go and watch this beauty whirl 

I don't recall who sang the song but I recall a story that I heard 
And as I look down on this city I remember each and every word 
The singer sang about a jealous cowboy and the way he used a gun 
To kill another cowboy, then he had to leave El Paso on the run 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
The cowboy lived and rode away but love was strong he couldn't stay 
He rode back just to die in that El Paso sand 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
I try not to let you cross my mind but still I find
There's such a mystery in the song that I don't understand 

My mind is down there somewhere as I fly above the badlands of New Mexico 
I can't explain why I should know the very trail he rode back to El Paso 
Can it be that man can disappear from life and live another time 
And does the mystery deepen 'cause you think that you yourself lived in that other time 

Somewhere in my deepest thoughts familiar scenes and memories unfold 
These wild and unexplained emotions that I've had so long, but I have never told 
Like everytime I fly up through the heavens and I see you there below 
I get the feeling sometime in another world I lived in El Paso 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
Could it be that I could be the cowboy in the mystery 
That died there in that desert sand so long ago 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
A voice tells me to go and seek, another voice keeps telling me 
Maybe death awaits me in El Paso 

El Paso City",Why Me,2007
Janie Frickie,"You stayed with me through thick and thin
You watched me lose, you watched me win
You picked me up off of the ground
You never one time let me down

And you put me on a natural high
And I can fly, I can fly

I was drowning in the sea of make believe
As helpless as a falling leaf
You gave your hand to me that day
And you did it, 'cause you're made that way

And you put me on a natural high
And I can fly, I can fly

You always seem to let your feelings show
You love me and you let me know
Darling, just remember these three words
I love you, I love you

And you put me on a natural high
And I fly, I can fly

And you put me on a natural high
And I can fly, I can fly",Natural High,2008
Janie Frickie,"I'll probably never see you eye to eye again
This letter's meant to be my last farewell
But you need to under-stand I'm nearly crazy
You need to know my life has gone to hell

Write me back and tell me why it ended
Send a letter that I can show my heart
I'll be somewhere between ""I love you"" and what you're feeling now
Lookin' for a place to fall apart

Looking for a place to fall apart
Trying to find a place that I can leave my heart
I need to be somewhere hidin' when I feel the teardrops start
Lookin' for a place to fall a-part

I can't seem to justify your leavin' me
I'm be-wildered as to how it all came down
I thought everything was fine until your phone call
The call that turned my world around
Send me word and tell me why it ended
I need some final proof to show my heart
I'll be somewhere between ""I love you"" and what you're feelin' now (I love you)
Lookin' for a place to fall apart

Looking for a place to fall apart
Trying to find a place that I can leave my heart
I need to be somewhere hidin' when I feel the teardrops start
Lookin' for a place to fall a-part

Janie Frickie,"You followed me to Texas
You followed me to Utah
We didn't find it there
So we moved on

You went with me to Alabama
And things looked good in Birmingham
We didn't find it there
So, we moved on

I know you're tired of following
My elusive dreams and schemes
For they're only fleeting things
My elusive dreams

You had my child in Memphis
Then I heard of work in Nashville
But we didn't find it there
So we moved on

To a small farm in Nebraska
To a gold mine in Alaska
We didn't find it there
So we moved on

Now we've left Alaska
Cause there was no gold there
But this time
Only two of us moved on

Now all we have is each other,
And a little memory to cling to
Still you won't let me go
Go on alone

I know you're tired of following
My elusive dreams and schemes
For they're only fleeting things
My elusive dreams",On My Knees,2008
Janie McGarrigle,"Call me when you're coming to town
Just as soon as your plane puts down
Call me on the telephone
But only if you're traveling alone
Counting down the hours
Through the sunshine and the showers
Today's the day
You're finally going to come my way

Let's make a date to see a movie
Some foreign film from gay Paris
I know you like to think you've got taste
So I'll let you choose the time and place
Have some dinner for two
In some eastside rendezvous
Then we'll walk
Arm in arm around the block and talk

Tonight you're mine
Let's not waste time

I do believe the die is cast
Let's try and make the night-time last
And I don't know where it's coming from
But I want to kiss you till my mouth get numb
I want to make love to you
Till the day comes breaking through
And when the sun is high in the sky
We'll kiss and say goodbye",Kiss and Say Goodbye,2013
Janie McGarrigle,"Her hair was dyed black and she was bending down
Picking something from off the ground
She was seventeen
And he said, ""Oh my God, it's Kate""
She said ""No, I'm the daughter of Kate
My name is Martha, who are you?
Ma never told me, never told me 'bout you""
He put his big middle-aged hands upon her shoulders
And he looked her in the eyes
Just like a boy of nineteen would do
And she was not afraid
No, she was not afraid
Once upon a time two kids in love in a car were flyin' over mountains
Trying to catch a boat that'd take 'em up river to home...
And they raced the Matapedia
Sixty minutes sixty miles
Thirty minutes thirty miles
Twenty minutes twenty miles
Ten nine eight....
And I was not afraid
No, I was not afraid
Well we made the boat with minutes to spare
And we crossed on over to the other side
And back home, safe and sound
But I could not slow down
No, I could not slow down
And we raced the Matapedia
Sixty minutes sixty miles
Thirty minutes thirty miles
Twenty minutes twenty miles
Ten nine eight

No, I could not slow down

I could not slow down 'cause I was not afraid",Matapedia,2013
Janiece Jaffe,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon,2000
Janiece Jaffe,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true

If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,2000
Janiece Jaffe,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song so gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss",Prelude to a Kiss,2000
Janiece Jaffe,"Now you say you're lonely
You cried the whole night through
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Go on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river............over you

Janiece Jaffe,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Janiece Jaffe,"I can only give you love that lasts forever,
And the promise to be near each time you call,
And the only heart I own is yours and yours alone, that's all, that's all.
I can only give you country walks in springtime,
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.

Janieck,"Sometimes everything comes easy
Most times it's hard to even start
Sometimes our working move me deeply
Most times I feel nothing at all
Sometimes I live just in the moment
The next I worry for a month
Sometimes I'm dancing in the light of the sun
Most times I'm tapping in the dark

Maybe I don't know
Maybe that's okay
Maybe I'll just let the wind blow
And carry me away
Lately I believe it's
All out of my hands
Maybe in an afterlife
This will all make sense

Sometimes I stop and see life clearly
Most times it's passing in a blink
Some days I want the world to hear me
Most times can't find my voice within
Sometimes I feel like I've made it
Most times I'm scared of going up
Deep down I know that we are over
But if I'm honest I'm just stuck

Maybe I don't know
Maybe that's okay
Maybe I'll just let the wind blow
And carry me away
Lately I believe it's
All out of my hands
Maybe in an afterlife
This will all make sense

Janik,"Sans visa, tracer en classe première, le visage collé au hublot
Quitter ces paysages de merde, mettre le turbo loin de ces villes grises
Fais passer le message, t’auras beau m’endormir
Mais quand il crise, le peuple, c’est mauvais présage
Les barrières tombent, les cris, on a l’avantage du nombre
J’écris, Dieu protège mes arrières, une ombre plane sur l’instru'
Sans panne, je me livre, mon skeud, un cru 2005
C’est ça être libre, avancer, même le chargeur vide
C’est quand le cœur guide les actions, être libre, c’est résister
Brailler parce qu’on existe, pas pour exister
C’est faire ce qu’on est, être fier, jeune et con
On n’est peut-être pas frères, mais tous prisonniers
Sûrement, c’est ça être libre

Vivre libre, briser ses chaînes
Ce qui nous bloque, ce qui nous freine
Libre, Certain que ça en vaut la peine

C’est en vouloir, rouler à l’instinct, rester debout
Voir son destin au bout d’un couloir et ne pas s’arrêter
La rage dans les intestins, s’apprêter au pire
Ouvrir l’œil au jour le jour, fêter en attendant le deuil
C’est couvrir d’un linceul ses craintes, courir
Ma clique, un paquet de soldats avançant comme un seul
C’est mourir un peu dès qu’un des nôtres chute
Nourrir un feu même sous les insultes
C’est croire ou ne pas croire, on porte le foulard ou la croix
Au risque de choquer France, je revendique cicatrices et différences
Hors de la matrice, je secoue tellement la rue qu’elle en vibre
C’est ça, être libre

Vivre libre, briser ses chaînes
Ce qui nous bloque, ce qui nous freine
Libre, Certain que ça en vaut la peine

C’est ne pas aller dans le sens du vent, avoir du franc-parler
Tu vends ton âme ou t’élèves la voix?
J’fais chialer ma plume, à la fois clair et obscur, j’suis paré
Je m’assume moi, je suis le premier à qui je dois plaire
Être libre, c’est goumer même quand faut payer le tarot
Essayer de garder le moral même derrière des barreaux
Connaître le passé, et au présent renaître
C’est les bif’ qui font courir les gens
Où est l’esclave, où est le maître?
Un spliff, un bon à mettre dans le poste et j’quitte ma taule
Esquive le réel, j’vis entre l’enclume et le marteau
Innonde les ruelles, les ondes, je les cribles
Devenir l’inverse de ce qui divise le monde, c’est ça, être libre",Chant Libre,2006

Borde de la línea

Y bailar hasta el amanecer

Ya no, ya me cansé

Gané, pero todo a mi manera
Sufrí, también amé, subí, bajé
No me arrepiento de nada

De estar solo a un paso

Me brindas tiempos de alegría me

Entregas tu vida y
Tu compañía y hoy veo en
Tu mano tu puño cerrado
Que cuando lo abro
Tu entrega es tu adiós

Sé que no he creado
Un mundo incierto pues no
Vivo en un desierto
Fuiste tú quien me
Invitó a pasar el que me
Dio ansia para navegar

Y te entrego el lapso
De estar solo a un paso de mí
De ser tú huella
Me brindas tiempos de alegría

Me entregas tu vida y tu compañía
Y hoy veo en tu mano tu puño cerrado
Que cuando lo abro, tu entrega es tu adiós
Tu entrega fue mi realidad
De hallarme

Al borde de poder amar

Cuerpo responde ya tu alma tenía grabada
Otro nombre y debo cesar

Que guardé detrás de
Mi dolor hoy vuelven a pintar
De gris mi corazón

Callejón y no termina
De caer la lluvia bajo el
Sol después de tanto que jure
Como una maldición
Hoy vuelves a empañar
La luz de mi razón

Te fuiste sin explicación
Pero mi orgullo me
Salvo en medio de
La frustración no me rendí

Gracias a Dios yo tengo
Que reconocer tu espina
Nunca la saque cuando
Me fundo en otra piel tú
Rostro sólo puedo ver

Y no termina de llover
En este callejón y no
Termina de caer la lluvia
Bajo sol los recuerdos

Que guardé detrás de
Mi dolor hoy vuelven a pintar
De gris mi corazón

Clavado en mi mente

Que nadie más supo nunca

And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful,2002

Some say it's honey and the bee,
Well sit right down and let me tell you
What my love is to me.

I call my sugar ""Candy""
Because I'm sweet on ""Candy""
And ""Candy"" is sweet on me

He/She understands me,
My understanding ""Candy""
And ""Candy""'s always handy

I wish that there were four of him/her
So I could love much more of him/her

Janine Jones,"I was looking outside the window and this huge Spider web
But there was this like, the most beautiful elaborate Moth, 
That was on this, on this Spider web
And the girls were like ""Mommy, look at that, is that a butterfly?"" 
I'm like ""I think it's a Moth""
And you could tell it was like, tryna get loose, but slowly flapping its wings
But the more it tried to get away from the, the web, 
It got stuck even more as it tried to set itself loose, right?
And all of a sudden, from the corner, was this big Spider, 
Coming to like you know (devour) devour the Moth
And then, it starts like, flapping, frantically trying to get loose
And all of a sudden, in desperation I start going BANG to where literally, 
The, the Moth like, it sets the Moth free (thank you Jesus)
And the Moth flies away, and then the Spider just, goes back up to its quarter

And, I wish'd you could have seen, we were like ""Woooh!!!"", we were so happy, we were so happy'
And then, I felt like the (Jesus) Holy Spirit said ""Disa,"" (yes!) like, it was just a whisper
It is a testament to me, that He hears His kids, 
And that the prayers of a righteous person avails much
So it's just kinda like man, Lord, you hear us, you hear us",Mothdisa (Interlude),2017
Janis Ian,"Love is blind
Love is only sorrow
Love is no tomorrow
Since you went away
Love is blind
How well I remember
In the heat of summer pleasure
Winter fades
How long will it take
Before I can't remember
Memories I should forget
I've been burning
Since the day we met
Love is blind
Love is without a mercy
Love is ""now you've hurt me, now you've gone away""
Love is blind
Love is no horizon
And I'm slowly dying
Here in yesterday
In the morning
Waken to the sound of weeping
Someone else should weep for me
Now it's over
Lover, let me be
Love is blind
Love is your caress
Love is tenderness
And momentary pain
Love is blind
How well I remember
In the heat of summer pleasure

Janis Ian,"She never had too much of money 
Friendly strangers were all she knew 
Nobody ever came to call but you 
I would not say she isn't happy 
Though the eyes of a fool 
Will make her blue 
Nobody's ever seen the tears 
It's true 
I guess nobody wanted to 
We'll have a celebration 
Ice cream and candy cakes 
She's very young to go 
So far away 
And then there'll be the papers 
In black and white 
To say we're through 
Nobody every loved me 
Quite like you 
I guess nobody wanted to 
And there'll be roses 
In the springtime still 
I guess there will 
I wish her roses and song 
And she'll be older 
As years go by, 
And how they fly 
Will she be lonely 
Without me along? 
She doesn't make friends easily 
She's only known a few

Passing through 
On Sundays and holidays 
I'll take her far away

I guess nobody wanted to",Roses,1975

 I said you could come 
 You showed up at your door 
 with all your leathers on 
 I said This must be wrong 
 It can't be right 
 How can you make love to me 
 dressed up for a fight? 
 Pick me up off the floor 
 No more -- 'cause you surely 
 can't be mine 
 Religion came 
 almost overnight 
 You were the high priest 
 I was the sacrifice 
 I said This must be wrong 
 This can't be right 
 Take off your stupid robe 
 and put down your knife 
 These ropes are getting tight 
 All right--you surely 
 can't be mine 
 I come home half dead 
 Late on a Saturday night 
 You stand on the bed and you 
 tell me you're learning to fly 
 I said Take off your boots 
 Take off your cape 
 Throw away your long johns 
 I ain't no Lois Lane 
 Before I get my kryptonite 
 All right--'cause you surely 
 can't be mine 
 I was ready for love 
 Big brass bed and all 
 I was ready for love 
 You said Let's talk about the war 
 I said What war?

Janis Ian,"I remember photographs
Watercolors of the past
He turned and said - You ask much of me
Then, when we'd made our peace, 
We lay between the sheets
He turned and said, I set you free

Go on, be a hero, be a photograph
Make your own myths
Christ, I hope they last 
Longer than mine
Wider than the sky we measure time by
Go on, be a hero, I set you free
Your stagehand lovers have conquered me
They'll send you carnations, 
While smiling faces look on and applaud
Go on, go on, go 'way from me

I said, do you wish me dead?
Lip service to books you've read
Articles on how to bed a bird in flight
You called it love, I called it greed
You say, you take what you want
I say, you get what you need

Go on, be a hero, be a man
Make your own destiny if you can
Go find a fence, locate a shell
And hide yourself
Go on, go to hell, go away from me
I need no charity

He said, come unto me
I am beauty
I am the light
Come unto me
Hold the darkness and stay the night
For I am wonder, I am the heart's delight
Tomorrow we'll fight

Come on come on, come near to me
Come be my fantasy
We'll talk it over again sometime
I'll send you some flowers
To change your mind, 
But for tonight, turn out the light
Hold me  
Come on, come on and set me free

Janis Ian,"There's never much to say
Between the moments of our games and repartee
There's never much to read 
Between the lines of what we need and what we'll take
There's never much to talk about or say aloud
But say it anyway
Of holidays and yesterdays, and broken dreams
That somehow slipped away
In books and magazines on how to be and what to see
While you are being
Before and after photographs 
Teach how to pass from reaching to believing
We live beyond our means on other people's dreams
And that's succeeding
Between the lines of photographs I've seen the past
It isn't pleasing

So strike another match
We'll have another cup of wine
And dance until the evening's dead
Of too much song and time
There's never much to talk about
Or read between the lines
Of what we dream about
When we're apart
And no one's looking on
To say you're mine

It was a good year then, it was a good year then
We all remember
The time you threw the looking glass and seemed a fool
Or very clever
Don't spoil it all, I can't recall a time 
When you were struck without an answer
We'll live a quiet peaceful time between the lines
And go together

And I'm striking up the band to play our last hurrah
We'll dance until we've killed another evening off
Don't think of anyone but me
I'll have no lovers on the side
Tonight is all we've ever dreamed about
For once let's get it right
We'll go down flying in the end
Through another bottle in between the lines
I'll go down like a ship of state
Let's be gracious now

with no dreams to hide me - bright lights to guide me
How long does it take to make the grade?

Everywhere I hear a ringing in my ears
Drummer, let the music play
Small-town blues, make it loud, make it do
Listen to the music sway

Bar rails and cocktails - have you got a light?
That's all it pays to keep in sight
Overused and much abused promises of delight
Honey, would you care to spend the night?

Take a little time - some memories and wine
Loosen up the sucker by the bar
And if he wants to hold you, if he wants to know you

Fair he was, and handsome
And he brought to the table
All the fool's gold and wine

Said he was the Savior

And wash away the tears
Sunlight will fade the years
Midnight comes too fast
And I don't want the night to last

Shadows on the glass, faces in window panes
Old lace and picture frames rattle their ancient chains
Midnight will surprise moonlight at the door
The night has a thousand eyes
And I don't know why to live any more

They told me how you loved me
When I finally got the bravery
To look beyond these prison walls
And shadows hanging over me

I cannot find a way to be
A lover for your life, although
They tell me it comes easily
I somehow cannot let the seasons pass
Without demanding that they last

And though I know forever well
I also know my private hell
Silent voices in the night
They are crying sacrifice

And wash away the years
Sunlight will fade the tears

Wasn't moonshine, wasn't

Janis Ian,"She is too old to care
Why not just leave her there?
We'll see her once a week
If we have the time, we'll speak
This is the sunset of your life

The old ones like to claw and clutch
Be careful not to offer much
They understand the fist and crutch
Their skin like leather to the touch
This is the sunset of your life

The empty mile, the frozen face
The drooling child humiliates

There will be no sun",Sunset of Your Life,1977
Janis Ian,"Blue sky morning, red sky night
Sailor take warning when the eagle takes flight
If I had wings I would delight and fly away
Black cloud riding on the cotton fields back home
Every man's an island in the desert of his soul
Take to the sky, there's nowhere else to go
And fly away

I can remember all the days of my life
Cold, dark September
When the eagle took flight
I had to stay, I had to stay
I cried a river to the empty sky
Someone deliver me by and by
I'll fly away, l'll fly away

It don't take nothing to be lonely
It comes too easy to be holy
It does nothing for the soul
But tear holes in tomorrow

Somebody, somebody said I don't want to be
Nobody said I don't want to see
Nobody said I don't want to need
Nobody said nothing at all
Sitting and waiting for the axe to fall

Sun come raining, lighten up the day
I ain't complaining I got nothing to say
I'll fly away, I'll fly away
If I had the courage to be flying blind
I'd fly too high to buy my way home

Somebody wants somebody to be lonely
And nobody settling only for love
How much time can you borrow?
Making it easy to lie, faking it on the sly
Shaking and stammering
Taking it up to the sky
Hammering nails in tomorrow

Sun come raining lighten up the sky
I ain't complaining, I get no reply
I'll fly away, I'll fly away
When I get the courage to be flying blind
I'll fly to high to buy my way home",Take to the Sky,1977
Janis Ian,"Someone is waiting over by the window
Just beyond the stairwell someone's crying
Drowning in the words of the prophets
That are written for the dead and the dying
Someone's lying, no one's buying

Someone is dying, panic in the streets
Can't get no relief, someone escaping
Waiting on a line for the holy revolution
Parading illusion someone's using, most amusing

Will you dance? Will you dance?
Smell of caviar and roses
Teach your children all the poses
How familiar are we all

Will you dance? Will you dance?
Light fantastic in the morning
How romantic to be whoring
Boring though it may be
Who'll survive if you and I should fall?

Someone is bleeding crimson in the night
Strangers in the light, a sudden meeting
Greeting one by one every life runs flashing
Before those dashing eyes

Will you dance? Will you dance?
Take a chance on romance
And a big surprise

Will you dance? Will you dance?
Take a chance on romance
And a big surprise

",Will You Dance?,1977
Janis Ian,"Faithful is a lie 
Freedom's just a game 
Somebody tacked onto 
Your ball and chain 
Love is a drug 
You've been canonized 
Want to be a high priestess? 
Then you got to sacrifice 
Somebody wants you 
To put out your eyes 
And drag you lower 
On the ladder than he is 
Reel you in slowly 
Kingfish on a line 
Some people get a kick 
Out of making you suffer 
You try the patience of the gods 
In the heat of a moment's pleasure 
And your sad retreat 
Mistake the moment for the song 
The actor for the role 
The neon light for day 
Somebody wants you 
To clip your wings 
Take shelter in the dark 
And the savage heat 
Mocks you with the burning sky 
And drops you in the ring 
Somebody gets a kick 
Out of seeing you suffer 
He can't take pleasure 
He feeds on pain 
He ain't no gambler 
He just likes to play the game 
It's a measure of a man 
It's a candle in the rain 
To treasure the link 
And not the chain",Some People,1978
Janis Ian,"Day by day, my-why heart
Right from the start
Tearing us apart
Hour by hour, my-why soul
Love takes its toll
More than you can know

Loving like I never wanted to
Now we're here I don't know what to do
Loving love isn't loving you
But nothing looks the same
When you're calling out my name

Hour by restless hour
I tell the dark
It's only just a spark
Night after longing night
'Til there's no more wrong or right
And nothing's worth the fight
Of loving in the shadow of desire
Caught between the fury and the fire
Day by day until we've satisfied 
The longest night, side by si-ide
And love won't be denied

Day by day, we steal
All that is real
From everything we feel
Hour by hour, the heart
Learns how to start again
Calling you friend
Captured by the shadows of desire
Living in the fury and the fire

I've waited such a long lo-ong time
If you could see the evil days

I've fallen away from the sun
I'm calling and there's no one
Below or above
Don't leave me love

Have mercy love
I only ask a kindness
I've fallen into darkness
And I cannot find the sun...
Have mercy love
Remember for a moment
Remember me in roses
Remember me to God

I've lost the hea-eavens
I don't remember how or when
But I do not think to gaze again
Help me stand alo-one love
My God it's lonely here
I cannot feel, my heart is gone
I'm all alone, I touch no one
Help me love, I'm fa-ading

The wrinkles show

I love you still
I guess I always will

Aging hearts 
And shaking knees
Moving parts 
Still bend with ease
I loved you young 
And age improves

The lines that time withstood
You grow more beautiful

Janis Ian,"I learned the truth at seventeen
That love was meant for beauty queens
And high school girls with clear skinned smiles
Who married young and then retired
The valentines I never knew
The Friday night charades of youth
Were spent on one more beautiful
At seventeen I learned the truth

And those of us with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social graces
Desperately remained at home
Inventing lovers on the phone
Who called to say - come dance with me
And murmured vague obscenities
It isn't all it seems at seventeen

A brown eyed girl in hand me downs
Whose name I never could pronounce
Said - pity please the ones who serve
They only get what they deserve
The rich relationed hometown queen
Marries into what she needs
With a guarantee of company
And haven for the elderly

So remember those who win the game
Lose the love they sought to gain
In debentures of quality and dubious integrity
Their small-town eyes will gape at you
In dull surprise when payment due
Exceeds accounts received at seventeen

To those of us who knew the pain
Of valentines that never came
And those whose names were never called
When choosing sides for basketball
It was long ago and far away
The world was younger than today
When dreams were all they gave for free
To ugly duckling girls like me

We all play the game, and when we dare
We cheat ourselves at solitaire
Inventing lovers on the phone
Repenting other lives unknown
That call and say - come on, dance with me
And murmur vague obscenities
At ugly girls like me, at seventeen",At Seventeen,1980

We'll be right, you'll see, night is a shadow on the soul
And if you want to set me wholly free, stay by me tonight

I've been afraid of love, knowing I need you to stay
I've been ashamed to love, knowing you're leaving me day after day
I'm begging you, pleading, I like you best when night runs
A shadow on the soul, no more empty hands to hold

Don't let the evening sun go down, I haven't found a way
To trade the night, sheer delight, burning bright, candlelight
Lay me down, astound me, not a sound, surround me
Skies unbound, I'm unwound, lay me down

I've been afraid to love, this is no time to hesitate
I've been ashamed to love but lay me down, I just can't wait
I like you best when night is a pleasure you can give

Lay me down, now I know how to, lay me down, now I know how to
Lay me down, now I know how to live

I watch the TV in the afternoons

Are you there?

No I'm not scared - I wait for you

Recalling your step
And I remember, too

And shaded in grey
But I still set a place
On the table at noon
And I'm leaving a light on the stairs
No I'm not scared - I wait for you
Hey jesse, I'm lonely, come home

Is like when you left
I've kept it all for you
And all the blues and the greens
Have been recently cleaned
And they're seemingly new

We'll do up my hair
We'll sleep unaware

She tells fortunes, you know
At a dollar a throw

Every pimp and every gigolo
Has made love in the afternoon

And a home of your own
Back on Miracle Row

And yes, they're gonna break out of here

And a home of your own
Back on Miracle Row

Love interest in the afternoon
And the old man swoon
And the sun gets hotter
Someone mumbles a tune

And the young men spot her
Running up to the room
And yes, they've gotta get out of here soon

Five healthy children
And a home of your own

Oh Maria, your eyes are like
A [?] lover's child
And lips of velvet who held an invitation
Every time you smiled

You sucked me in, I must admit
That I was waiting for a sign
Won't you, leave me on the corner by the light?
Because I'm stepping out tonight

Oh Maria, I envy any man who knows your name
The ones I knew you, well, I'm not ashamed
To be the one who drags you down, your life is like a movie

Like a star it's pasted up in subway walls
Won't you leave me something sacred when you fall?
Unless there's nothing left at all

Your lips are like a faded Spanish rose
And every movement strikes a pose
On every technical enclose

And other women show their teeth
And schoolboy husbands pack and leave
And empty lovers search the streets

Maria, convince me in the night she know the way
Though every lover brings another scream into the light of day

They come fast or slow 
They go like the last light of the sun, all in a blaze 
And all you see is glory 
But it gets lonely there 
When there's no one here to share 
We can shake it away if you'll hear a story 
People lust for fame 
Like athletes in a game we break our collarbones 
And come up swinging 
Some of us are downed 
Some of us are crowned 
And some are lost and never found 
But most have seen it all 
They live their lives in sad cafes and music halls 
They always have a story 
Some make it when they're young 
Before the world has done its dirty job 
And later on, someone will say 
""You've had your day you must make way"" 
But they'll never know the pain 
Of living with a name you never owned 
Or the many years forgetting what you know too well 
The ones who gave the crown have been let down 
You try to make amends without defending 
Perhaps pretending you never saw the eyes 
Of grown men of twenty five that followed as you walked 
And asked for autographs 
Or kissed you on the cheek 
And you never could believe they really loved you 
Some make it when they're old 
(Perhaps they have a soul they're not afraid to bare 
Or perhaps there's nothing there) 
Some women have a body 
Men will want to see, 
So they put it on display 
Some people play a fine guitar 
I could listen to them play all day 
Some ladies really move across a stage 
And gee, they sure can dance 
I guess I could learn how if I have it half a chance 
But I always feel so funny when my body tries to soar 
And I seem to always worry about missing the next chord 
I guess there isn't anything to put up on display 
Except the tunes and whatever else I say 
Anyway, that isn't really what I meant to say 
I meant to tell a story 
I live from day to day 
Stars, they come and go they come fast or slow 
They go like the last light of the sun, all in a blaze 
And all you see is glory

Sweet sympathy, won't you 
Pity me tonight? 
Yes I got to hurry 
To the surry 
Get the saddle on tight

Honey just allow me 
Honey, won't you pleasure me right? 
Sweet sympathy, won't you 
Carry me tonight? 

I want to lay myself down 
And take a sweet, soft shelter 
Still my waters here forever 
I want to lay my body down 
I want to lay my body down 
Honey, lay me lightly down 
I'm ready to ride 
Can we get together 
Can we get together 
Can we get together right now? 
Well, you give me the music 
And you know how to use it 
Drive me out of my shoes 
I got the blues tonight 
I've got sweet titillation 
Honey, won't you pleasure me right? 
Sweet sympathy won't you 
Carry me tonight?

Janis Ian,"Come into my solitude
Though I weary be
Come into my tenderness
Dream along with me

Listen to the whispers sing
Listen to the singers shout
Come into my solitude
Me and my big mouth

Thoughts unspoken, thoughts unsaid
Lies of hearth and home
Children broken on the bed
And left to lie alone

Things you talk around
Scum you chock on down
Come into my solitude
Step on sacred ground

We were speaking
Of values and violence
Breaking silence

Fathers who are lovers
To the daughters that they own
Mothers who don't leave a child
In a single safety zone

People so unhinged
That death is much to kind
Come into my solitude
Step over that line
(Thought I was the only one)

Thought I was the only one
Thought I was the only
(Thought I was the only)
Thought I was the only, only one
(Thought I was the only)

We were speaking
Of values and violence
Breaking silence

Come into my solitude
Welcome to the wheel
Come into this wonderland
Of wounds that will not heal

Walls that do not speak
Steps that do not sound
Come into my solitude
Burn this building down
",Breaking Silence,1993
Janis Ian,"Some people's lives run down like clocks
One day they stop and that's all they've got
Some lives wear out like old tennis shoes
No one can use, well, it's sad but it's true

Didn't anybody tell them?
Didn't anybody see?
Didn't anybody love them
Like you love me?

Some people's lives fade like their dreams
Too tired to rise, too tired to sleep
Some people laugh when they need to cry
And they never know why

Didn't anybody tell them
That's not how it has to be?
Didn't anybody love them
Like you love me?

Some people ask if the tears have to fall
Then why take your chances? Why bother at all?
And some people's lives are as cold as their lips
They just need to be kissed

Doesn't anybody tell them?
Doesn't anybody see?
Doesn't anybody love them
Like you love me?
Cause that's all they need",Some People's Lives [Live],1993
Janis Ian,"This town isn't big enough for my dreams
This place is just about to break at the seams
Baby, baby, you and I need just a little bigger piece of the sky
Big hopes, big dreams, baby can you set me free?

Take me walking in the rain
Take me dancing in the waves, baby
Let 'em wipe away the tears, wash away the years
Take me walking in the rain

Take me right here where I stand
Let me feel your heart on mine
Life'll never be the same, we've got everything to gain
Take me walking in the rain

This life may be good enough for the rest
But this heart is just about to break through my chest
I remember every rule I've heard and I'm strangling on every word
I can't say they're wrong but baby, how can I go on?

Take me walking in the rain
Take me dancing in the waves, baby
Let 'em wipe away the tears, wash away the years
Take me walking in the rain

Take me right here where I stand
Let me feel your heart on mine
I don't want somebody new, I just want the rest of you
Take me walking in the rain

Take me right here in the sand, life ain't what we plan
",Take Me Walking in the Rain,1995
Janis Ian,"I'm leaving by night, I'm leaving alone
Leaving it lie, when you waken I'll be gone
I would not beg for me as I would not beg for you
Though I'd like to be the one to see you through

Every step you have take disappears with the tide
You're torn up and shaken with changing your mind
You haven't got the grace to say you'll finally decide
And you haven't got the strength to stay to fight

Those people who surround you
Only want to see you weak enough to crawl
They'll lie for you, decide for you
And buy up all your rights and all your wrongs
And they'll try to stop your singing
In the middle of your song
For they do not want you free
And they will not make you strong
But only drag you down in the hole they're coming from

They say you are foolish for wanting the sun
They call you selfish for learning to run
They'll tell you that the darkness is a blessing in disguise
You never have to notice if you're sighted or you're blind
And they'll do their best to keep you from the light

You're more than beginning, you're learning to fly
Feels like you're falling, but it passes in time
And I hate to see a friend go down in flames without a song
So I'm waiting by the doorway, I will not linger long

I'm leaving by night, I'm leaving alone
Leaving you lie. When you waken I'll be gone
I would not beg for me as I will not beg for you
But I'd like to be the one to see you through",From Me to You,1995

Janis Ian,"Where have you been that made you weep
And left these stains upon your cheek
What did you see while you were gone
That haunts your eyes this sunny dawn

They herded us like so much meat
Up from the sewers to the street
Where concrete canyons stretched their walls
So high it made us want to crawl
Past proverbs writ on subway cars
And in-between the window bars
We walked until the pavement bled
And not a curse was left unsaid

Into a place that knows no spring
Where only steel and silver sing
They made us dance until we dropped
And the music of the jackhammers stopped

I caught a cinder in my eye
Searching for a patch of sky
But the shadows drizzled down like in Pompeii
That's how I spent my yesterday

Searching for America
In the rivets and the rust
Searching for America
Finding only dust

What did you see that made you cry
And left these trackmarks on your eye
What did you find while you were there
That sucks the light out of the morning air

They gave us each a cropper's shack
And land so hard it broke our back
Then fed us 'til our bellies burst
On promises that died at birth
So I lay the baby out each dawn
In-between the tender corn
With sunrise for her bonnet
And flies her only blanket

We harvested until we bled
'Til every single root ran red
And when the work was finally done
They gave our names to immigration
I did not know how bad it hurt
Until I lay there eating dirt
And the cold seeped in between my bones
That's where I was when I left home

Searching for America
All her dreams and hopes
Searching for America
Finding only ghosts

Who are these people you have seen
To dream this dark and distant dream
To tell the stories you have told
To leave these bruises on your soul

They are the flesh, they are the bone
They are the very cornerstone
They leave their mansions and their shacks
To hide here in-between the cracks
Their hope is tattooed on my lips
Bleeding from my fingertips
They are crawling toward the promised land
Hand over hand

To walk until they run no more
And wash up on some distant shore
Where truth is not the enemy
And whatever does not kill us, sets us free

Somewhere out there
Are millions just like me
Homesick for Eden
Heartsick at the memory

Searching for America
In every stick and stone
Searching for America
Going home
Searching for America
Going home
",Searching for America,1997
Janis Ian,"Don't let the sun go down on me
I do not want to be alone tonight
We'll be right, you'll see
Night is a shadow on the soul
And if you want to set me wholly free
Stay by me tonight

I've been afraid of love
Knowing I need you to stay
I've been ashamed to love
Knowing you're leaving me
Day after day
I'm begging you, pleading
I like you best
When night runs a shadow on the soul
No more empty hands to hold

Don't let the evening sun go down
I haven't found a way
To trade the night
Sheer delight
Burning bright
Candlelight
Lay me down - astound me
Not a sound- surround me
Skies unbound, I'm unwound
Lay me down

I've been afraid to love
This is no time to hesitate
I've been ashamed to love
But lay me down, I just can't wait
I like you best
When night is a pleasure you can give
Lay me down - now I know how to
Lay me down - now I know how to
Lay me down
Now I know how to live

All my heroes have been silenced
All the young men marching off in two-four time
Dance to that righteous killer's cadence

One too many gone, laying wasted in the sand
Death's got no feeling for the brave
Crazed men hustling selling guns and ammunition
Bear your rifle, bear your burden, save your children

Mothers raise their sons for the sacrifice
Babies carry guns and dream of paradise

Dying for water, and no oasis in sight

promises to wave a magic wand
Advertising confidence, fourteen lesson eloquence
Will teach you how to live beside the bomb

High school fools rule, foam from the mouth
Keep you 'til you're old enough to buy
Teachers talk of temperance, allegiance to coincidence
snd documents to recompense your pride

No one calls on you to live, no one calls you to die
No one sends roses to crazy old ladies who lie
in dark dusty rooms the size of a small foreign car
Sometimes you wonder where all the good people are

Strangers walk the streets in the summer heat
Tempers shorter than a baby's dryness
Stepping on your shoes, leaving mind and body bruised
Ain't it easy now to kill someone for kindness

It'd make a man of any man who's old enough to cry
Surely make a loser feel at home
Blessings on the children of the city when they die

We lay between the sheets

Wider than the sky

I called it greed

Go find a fence
Locate a shell
And hide yourself, go on, go to hell

Come unto me
Hold the darkness and stay the night

Come on, come on
Come on, come near to me
Come be my fantasy

Just a flash in a window I was passing
Just a frame in a movie I remember

Just the sound of a wheel in the gravel
Just the click of a heel in the pavement
Just a moment like any other moment
Amsterdam

I remember your lips
I remember your eyes
And the taste of the kiss
And your graceful goodbye
You lied, goodbye

Just the scent of perfume on the linen
Just the print of a palm on the pillow
Just the hint of the moon from the window
Amsterdam

Just a ghost in the steam on the mirror
Just a shadow of motion in the water
Just a need to look over my shoulder
Amsterdam

I remember your lips
I remember your eyes
And the taste of the kiss
And your graceful goodbye
You lied, goodbye

Just two lovers asleep in the silence
As I walk from the door
Just the weight of a heart as it’s falling
Nothing more

I remember your lips
I remember your eyes
And the taste of the kiss
And your graceful goodbye
You lied, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye

Who will turn and run
Who will always follow someone else's drum?

Who will die of hope?
Who will tell it truly?
Who will leave it cloaked?

Who will call me lover?
Who will call me friend?
Who'll be my brother?

Who will I surrender?
Who will I defend?
Will I be remembered? 
Will I rise again?

Let it leave an everlasting scar

Is the beat of a soul?
And it stares out the window
As the cars come and go

And it hungers for heroes
And it dreams of open skies
And there's no expectation
That the sun will rise

You better save somebody
Save somebody
Before the moment slips away
You better save somebody
Who'll be lonely?
When you walk away

there's a crack in the heavens
And a tear in the sky
It cuts through the shadows
Living in her eyes

And the gates of the city
Are closed until dawn
When the ghosts of midnight
Have come and gone
And the hearts of the weary carry on

You better save somebody
Save somebody
Before the moment slips away
You better save somebody
Who'll be lonely?
When you walk away

And I'm thinking of your silence
How the memory lingers on
And I wonder do you miss me
Now that I am gone, now that I am gone

You better save somebody
Save somebody
Before the moment slips away

You better save somebody
Who'll be lonely?
When you walk away

Janis Ian,"Iâ??m leaving by night, Iâ??m leaving alone
Leaving it lie, when you waken Iâ??ll be gone
I would not beg for me as I would not beg for you
Though Iâ??d like to be the one to see you through

Every step you have taken disappears with the tide
Youâ??re torn up and shaken with changing your mind
You havenâ??t got the grace to say
Youâ??ll finally decide
And you havenâ??t got the strength to stay to fight

Those people who surround you
Only want to see you weak enough to crawl
Theyâ??ll lie for you, decide for you
And buy up all your rights and all your wrongs
And theyâ??ll try to stop your singing
In the middle of your song
For they do not want you free
And they will not make you strong
But only drag you down in the hole theyâ??re coming from

They say you are foolish for wanting the sun
They call you selfish for learning to run
Theyâ??ll tell you that the darkness
Is a blessing in disguise?
You never have to notice if youâ??re sighted
Or youâ??re blind
And theyâ??ll do their best to keep you from the light

Youâ??re more than beginning, youâ??re learning to fly
Feels like youâ??re falling, but it passes in time
And I hate to see a friend go down
In flames without a song
So Iâ??m waiting by the doorway â?? I will not linger long

Iâ??m leaving by night, Iâ??m leaving alone

I was playin' soft while Bobby sang the blues, yeah

There Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, through everything we done
Yeah, Bobby baby kept me from the cold

One day up near Salinas, Lord, I let him slip away
He's lookin' for that home, and I hope he finds it

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

The song that Crosby sings

Janis Mann,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?

The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now,2001
Janis Mann,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before

Janis Mann,"I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon

You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise

Except for just a dream or two
But I've got lots of plans for tomorrow
And all my tomorrows belong to you

Right now it may not seem like spring at all
We're drifting and the laughs are few
But I've got rainbows planned for tomorrow
And all my tomorrows belong to you

No one knows better than I
That luck keeps passing me by, that's fate
But with you there at my side
I'll soon be turning the tide, just wait

As long as I've got arms that cling at all
It's you that I'll be clinging to

On some bright tomorrow they'll all come true

Janis Mann,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day

One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new

Just a song at the start but it soon is a hymn to your grace
When the music swells, I'm touching your hand
It tells me you're standing near, and

Can I help but rejoice that a song such as ours came to be

I don't care about anything else but being with you, being with you.

Honey don't go, don't leave this scene,
Be out of the picture, and off of the screen.
Don't let them say we told you so,
They tell me you'll love me and then let me go.

They tell me all about your heartbreak reputation.

People can change, they always do,
Haven't they noticed the changes in you?
Or can it be that like love I am blind,
Do I want it so much 'til it's all in my mind?
One thing I know for sure is really, really real,
I never felt before the way you make me feel.

By the time you drove me home

How do you slow your blood, after the body rush?
How do you free your soul, after you've found a friend?
How do you teach your heart

It's probably ancient history

And it burns my hands, and it leaves me tired
And it makes me run, trying to find some cover
This pain that comes with being your lover

You push me back, and you lead me on
And you make me feel, like this is all wrong

You've gotta learn how to let things go
Start living without fear, be willing to fall down
There's so much love here
You've gotta learn how to let things be
Believe in what you feel, relax and know that love
Will set you free my dear

Holding you is like cupping water
Inside my hands and it's getting harder
To show you all of the love inside me
Wherever I am you're not with me

You push me back, and you pull me down
And you choke the words, inside my heart

You've gotta learn how to let things go
Start living without fear, be willing to fall down
There's so much love here

Jann Arden,"I leaned the truth at seventeen
That love was meant for beauty queens
And high school girls with clear-skinned smiles
Who married young and then retired

The valentines I never knew
The Friday night charades of youth
Were spent on one more beautiful
At seventeen I learned the truth

And those of us with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social graces
Desperately remained at home
Inventing lovers on the phone

Who called to say, ""Come dance with me""
And murmured vague obscenities
It isn't all it seems at seventeen

A brown-eyed girl in hand-me-downs
Whose name I never could pronounce
Said, ""Pity, please, the ones who serve
Cause they only get what they deserve""

And the rich relationed hometown queen
Marries into what she needs
With a guarantee of company
And haven for the elderly

So remember those who win the game
Lose the love they sought to gain
In debentures of quality and dubious integrity

Their small town eyes will gape at you
In dull surprise when payment due
Exceeds accounts received at seventeen

To those of us who knew the pain
Of valentines that never came
And those whose names were never called
When choosing sides for basketball

It was long ago and far away
The world was younger than today
When dreams were all they gave for free
To ugly duckling girls like me

We all play the game and when we dare
To cheat ourselves at solitaire
Inventing lovers on the phone
Repenting other lives unknown

They call and say, ""Come on, dance with me""
And murmur vague obscenities
At ugly girls like me at seventeen",At Seventeen,2007

Why do you hurt me so bad?

Do I stand in your way, or am I the best thing you've had?
Believe me, believe me, I can't tell you why
But I'm trapped by your love, and I'm chained to your side

And before this gets old, will it still feel the same?

But if we get much closer, I could lose control
And if your heart surrenders, you'll need me to hold

But, if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

And she said you were in town
Suddenly the memories came back to me 
In my mind

How can I be strong I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

A wounded heart you gave
My soul you took away
Good intentions you had many
I know you did

I come from a place that hurts
And God knows how I've cried
And I never want to return
never fall again

Making love to you
Oh it felt so good and
Oh so right

How can I be strong I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

So here we are alone again'
Didn't think it'd come to this
And to know it all began
With just a little kiss

I've come too close to happiness
To have it swept away
Don't think I can take the pain
No never fall again

Kinda late in the game and my heart is in
Your hands
Don't you stand there and then
Tell me you love
Me then leave again
Cause I'm falling in love with
You again

Hold me
Hold me
Don't ever let me go
Say it just one time
Say you love me
God knows I do
Love you

A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

Cats knew how I got down 'cause word got around
I was that robbery kid with no gun and no mask
Catch a nigga out the door slippin', that's yo ass

Didn't laugh much 'cause I didn't have much
Life was like a stick, half gas, half clutch
Meaning half good and half bad
It was good if I caught a good vic, if I didn't, I was bad

Took it out on my regulars, I come through
And if niggaz was broke, I took watches and sneakers
Went to jail a few times but that didn't stop me
All it taught me was, how not to be sloppy

An older cat robbed me when I was like ten
If anybody wanted to help, they should've did it then
But they didn't and all it did was release the beast
So I'ma feast on whatever I come across in the streets

Did robberies with some cats and robbed the rest

We'd clear out the whole fuckin' block 'cause we went hard

I bag some niggaz I knew and some niggaz I didn't
I ain't a fuck either way, it was no bullshittin'
I'm a cruddy nigga out to get money
And a couple of slugs is the only thing anybody took from me

Run up on a cat smooth like, put it in his left ear
Give up the money, the jewelry or get left here
Keep thinking it's a game and play, let's get popped
See how much fun you having, when your heart be stopped

Choke off haze and sell attics coke for days
Same clothes, no soap to shave
And I still got a gun on my hip for your open grave

Until my man got killed for his whip on some robbery shit
Then I switched to the weed and started sellin' crack

I can't see shit cause you always on my mind
Been like that, since I met her, had to have her so I went to get her
But I'm a dog so I didn't sweat her
And it wasn't bout the cheddar, I don't trick
I got two things for bitches, couple of jokes and some dick
Yeah the kid talk slick but that's not what I'm about
We got dog love and me and shorty ridin' it out, we out

Jarabe de Palo,"Dicen que vuela por el cielo una estrella
Que vendió su alma a un diablo poeta
Dicen que a cambio tan solo pedía
Que la luna llena brillara para ella

Alivia ese dolor o quítame la vida
Con tu boca o quítame la vida
Déjame ver el color o quítame la vida
De tus ojos o quítame la vida

Dicen que existe un amargo veneno
Con sabor a limón y que huele a centeno
Dicen los sabios que ese fue el secreto
Que perdió a la estrella detrás de algún cometa

Cuenta la historia que la luna llena
Pasó mucho tiempo brillando para ella
Y loca la estrella pasaba las noches

Mucho tiempo llevo sin hablar 
Un minuto con ellas

Salir volando, subir muy alto

Tómate un trago
Quizás haya algo que sepas y no sepa yo 
Hoy te invito
Siéntate y cuéntame qué es para 
Ti el amor
Con tus ojos
Con tus manos cuéntame un sueño 
En el que salga yo
Que sentido tiene contar cosas 
Que casi nadie entiende
Pero he abierto los ojos y 
He visto que es mejor ser lobo 
Solitario
Que sentido tiene vivir tan solo

Ya no merece la pena pasear a tu lado
Mirarte y no ver nada

Por eso vuela deja todo y lárgate muy lejos",Vuela,1997

Que va a ser como imposible

Para que pudieras volver
Volver, volver

Tengo que decirte
Que a la luz de la candela
Intento arañar la niebla
Que no deja que te vea

Deja que te espere
A la puerta de tu casa
Un minuto me hare falta
Luego me voy para siempre

La madre de mi tío
Se casó con un gitano
Que tocaba la guitarra
Con seis dedos en la mano

Y acompañaba a un payo
Que cantaba bulerías
Con un negro de Chicago
Que decía ser su hermano

En lo puro no hay futuro

Dicen que mi abuelo
Era un rubio bananero
Que a Cuba llegó de España
Pa' quedarse en La Habana

Y que yendo pa' Santiago
Conoció a una mulata
Mezcla de tabaco y caña
Que en francés a él le hablaba

Señores, en lo puro no hay futuro
Señores, la pureza está en la mezcla
Señores, en la mezcla de lo puro
Señores, que antes que puro fue mezcla

Que me ha robado el corazón
Y que cuidaré de ella

Tu mano y nos damos un beso
Y no siento tus labios
En tus ojos no brilla el azul del cielo

Te miro y lo que veo me
Parece extraño

Si en la noche te encuentro
Ya no pierdo la razón cuando
Estoy a tu lado
No se me acelera el pulso

No me quedan

Que tanto te hicieron mal

Volvió la tristeza que te oprimía el alma
La amistad y el cariño
Que tanto nos unió cayeron
En las redes de la desconfianza

Ya no tiembla tu cuerpo
Cuando hacemos el amor
Y a pesar del tiempo
Parece que nada sucedió

Sube entre los dos
Se subió a una paloma y
Se fue volando

De ese viejo amor que
Te hizo sufrir

Cambia la piel y límpiate
Todo ese rencor que no
Te hace bien

Cambia la piel y olvídate

Nunca curó

profundos silencios,
y nuestros recuerdos,
incontables secretos que no lo sé
si tu podrás entenderlo.

Hace tiempo me hicieron
la misma pregunta
en este mismo lugar.
Y ahora, y ahora,
lo siento, será más rotundo.

(Si las mujeres escriben canciones
son las canciones más bellas del mundo,
son las que más
me hacen llorar.
Porque dentro de cada mujer
hay una historia en forma de canción
tal vez la canción,
más bella del mundo.) Voz de fondo de Pau.

Si las mujeres escriben canciones (tú no las vas a escuchar) (Lucrecia)
son las que más, (ay mama),
me hacen llorar (porque sabemos amar).
Porque dentro de cada mujer (brindamos la luz a otro ser)
tal vez la canción
(como no) más bella del mundo.

(¿Quién dijo que no?)
las mujeres
(Y la música somos una)
¿Por qué?
(porque nuestro cuerpo expressa sentimiento, alegría,
ay, experiência y sabrosura)
las mujeres
(Y las letras somos una)
¿Por qué?
(oye, porqué huyen como locos, no quiren rencontar oh yeah,
nuestras histórias preciosas)
las mujeres
(maltratadas)
¿Por qué?
(no te sientas desvalida todos somos una solo voz, y no y no queremos perder otra vida)
las mujeres
(quién dijo que no)
¿Por qué?
(que no, que escribimos con nuestros corazones las canciones de la vida, mi amor, água)

Jarabe de Palo,"Qué bien que al fin dejamos de ser dos buenos amigos 
El amor nos volvió completos desconocidos 
Y descubrimos que éramos totalmente distintos

Me cansé de ser 
Tu hermano mayor 
Tu mejor amigo, 
Tu socio, tu confesor

Me cansé de ser 
Experto en el amor 
Que sentías por otros 
Otros que no eran yo

Empezar a querer como nunca había querido 
Descubrir una parte de ti que no había conocido 
Y encontrar otro mundo ahí detrás que 
Me habías escondido 
Y jugar a esos juegos que tu me tenías prohibidos

Me cansé de ser

Me cansé de hacer 
De sabio profesor 
De contarte historias 
Que no me creía ni yo

Me cansé de poner 
Cara de comprender 
De darte consejos 
Y de no decirte que yo

Me cansé de hablar de amor y de no hacerlo contigo 
Me cansé de recoger lo que sobraba de tus líos 
De no ser el que cada noche te quitaba el vestido 
Me cansé ser menos que un amor

Jarabe de Palo,"So, so, so, somos lo que somos

Mira hermano, aquí somos los que estamos
Y aunque hacemos lo que podemos
No aprendemos, no avanzamos
El mundo se hace pequeño
Y la vida nos sigue pesando

La Tierra enferma, y tú con ella, Bro
Mira, el hombre arrasa con todo lo que le dio
Digo “paz”, “verdad”, “justicia”, “libertad”,
Digo “amor”, “respeto”, “conciencia”, “dignidad”

Mira, somos lo que somos, no lo que queremos
Patrones, esclavos, humanos, imperfectos
Somos raza, cultura, humanidad
So, so, so, somos lo que somos!

Saca la mentira pa´ fuera de tu vida
El amor es el camino que cambie tu destino
Que cambie la dirección que abra tu corazón
Esta calle sí tiene salida, libérate y respira

Somos monos inteligentes
Animales racionales con carnet de identidad
Seres humanos indiferentes
Víctimas supervivientes de la propia raza humana

Somos lo que somos, no lo que queremos
Individuos vigilados con derechos controlados
We are what we are, no what we wanna be
So, so, so, somos lo que somos!

Somos monos, somos locos
Somos raros, somos cocos
Somos rotos, somos chotos
Somos nacos, somos jotos

Somos monos, somos locos
Somos raros, somos cocos
Somos rotos, somos chotos
Somos nacos, somos jotos
Somos homos, somos rotos
Somos falsos, somos bobos
So, so, so, somos lo que somos!

Calma, tú tienes la palabra
La fuerza de la vida reside en la esperanza
Reside en la energía que brota de tu alma
En tu mente positiva, no tengas miedo
Avanza, libérate y respira

Lo que sí te digo, amigo
Es que ya estoy preparado
No me gusta lo que veo
Voy a empezar a hacer algo

Voy a empezar a quererte
Sin que importe lo que haya pasado
Voy a empezar a ser libre
Estrechándote la mano

En la vida algo me he propuesto
Seguir adelante sin miedo
Vivir y avanzar compartiendo
Con la gente a la que yo quiero

A pesar de nuestros defectos
Algunas virtudes tenemos
Somos ángeles, somos buenos
So, so, so, somos lo que somos!

Saca la mentira pa´ fuera de tu vida
El amor es el camino que cambie tu destino
Que cambie la dirección que abra tu corazón
Esta calle sí tiene salida
So, so, so, somos lo que somos!

Somos Tierra, somos paz
Somos fuego, destino y verdad
Somos sangre, hermanos, amigos
Y en el tiempo andamos perdidos
So, so, so, somos lo que somos!

A pesar de nuestros defectos
Algunas virtudes tenemos
Somos ángeles, somos buenos

Cada tarde al balcón yo volví a salir 
Y ella dormida volvía a sonreír
Se parecía a una flaca que conocí 
Era la chica que en sueños me hacía feliz 
Y aquel verano pedí que no tuviera fin 
Y le escribí una carta que no le dí 
Desde entonces no es igual para mí

Hola vecina no creo que te acuerdes de mí 
Soy ese chico que ves desde tu jardín 
Solo quería algún día invitarte a salir 
Brindar por ese momento en que te conocí 
Y agradecerte el haberme hecho tan feliz

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep

Face the problems that we see,
Then maybe somehow we can work it out.

What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be.
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears,
But we must live each day like it's the last.
Go with it, go with it.

The world keeps changing, rearranging minds and thoughts,
Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out.
I told my brother, don't you ask me for no favors,
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout.
She pray to God to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song.
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?

Makin' funky tracks with my man Michael Jackson,
Smooth criminal, that's the man, Mike's so relaxed.

So that you too will understand
There's a ribbon in the sky for our love

This is not a coincidence
And far more than a lucky chance
But what is that was always meant
Is our ribbon in the sky for our love, love

We'll find strength in each tear we cry

Jared Evan,"Because she's so cold
Because she's so cold, oh
Because she's so cold
In this cold cold weather

Full length mink chinchilla collars
The game so cold cause we chasing our dollars
It's even colder, when there's diamonds on your shoulders
But Guess make is for guests, VS makers protect
All the bullshit I know I did you wrong
And I made you so cold, bitch, listen to this song
Roses used to move you, dinner use to groove you
Now you're so cold, only smile when you choose to
Ice bucket love refrigerator romance
You caught me smashing 2 hoes now I got no chance
You're so cold so frigid, answer me I'm saying you
Ain't forgiving and I'm screaming ""I'm pimpin""
Sipping hot tea, bitches thats not me
Burberry scarf tied over, the fly rover
I think I damaged her, I use to manage her
It didn't work out no it's over and my hearts colder

Cold, cold
Because she's so cold
Because she's so cold, oh
Because she's so cold

If the sun don't melt the snow
I guess you'll never know
What it takes to love
If the sun don't melt the snow
I guess you'll never know
What it takes to love, me

I'm addicted to it, shot of clear fluid
When it comes to these bitches baby I'm the truest
Get ready for it, listen to the chorus
Showing her off, her status like the average tourist
She's sophisticated tell my momma I made it
I got a bitch that's so cold when I smoke she hate it
She ain't into jewels, she into property
She's a classy bitch but ghetto when on top of me
She be wilding out, 40 ounce and hollering out
Talking in tongues told me fuck her while I load my gun
Necklace very heavy, wrist watch blue berry
Let's put our business on the table baby you scary
Nothing but square feet, mafia rules
Square niggas can't get near me without permission
Need a pass to kill a pimp and that's the code
I'm pass the blow, fast to go hard on a ho when she acting cold

Cold, cold

Because she's so cold, oh
Because she's so cold

He said girl you better try to have fun no matter what you do

They gave me a forty
And I must've been thirsty
'Cause I drank it so quickly

When I got to the bedroom
There was somebody waiting
And it isn't my fault
That the barbarian raped me

When I went to get tested
I brought along my best friend
Melissa Mahoney
Who had once been molested

And she knew how to get there
She knew all the nurses
They were all really friendly
But the test came out positive

Uh-oh

I've seen better days but I don't care
I just sent a letter in the mail

When I got my abortion
I brought along my boyfriend
We got there an hour
Before the appointment

And outside the building
There were all these annoying
Fundamentalist Christians
We tried to ignore them

Oh-oh

I've had better days but I don't care
Oasis got my letter in the mail

When vacation was over
The word was all over
That I was a crack whore
Melissa had told them

And so now were not talking
Except we have tickets
To see blur in October
And I think were still going

Oh-oh

Oh I just got a letter in the mail

Its autographed and everything

It's 2006, the consumer's still pissed 
Won't take it anymore so I'm writing a list 
Don't try to resist this paradigm shift 

The music revolution cannot be dismissed 
$18.98 Iggy pop CD 
What if I can get it from my sister for free? 
It's all about marketing Clive Davis see 

If fans buy the shirt then they get the mp3 
Music was a product now it is a service 
Major record labels why are you trying to hurt us 
Epic's up in my face like don't steal out songs Lars 

While Sony sells the burners that are burning CD-are's 
So Warner EMI hear me clearly 
Universal music, update your circuitry 
They sue little kids downloading hit songs 

They think that makes sense 
When they know that it's wrong 

Hey Mr. Record man the joke's on you 
Running your label like it was 1992 
Hey Mr. record man your system can't compete 
It's the new artist model file transfer complete 

Download this song 
Download this song 
Download this song 

I know I'm rhyming fast but the message is clear 
You don't need a million dollars to launch a career 
If your style is unique and you practice what you preach 
Minor threat and jello both have things to teach 

I've got G5 production concept videos 
Touring with a laptop rocking packed shows 
The old-school major deal it makes no sense 
Indentured servitude the costs are too immense 

Their finger's in the dam but the crack keeps on growing 
Can't sell bottled water when it's freely flowing 
Record sales slipping down 8 percent 
Increased download sales you can't prevent 

Satellite radio and video games

Did you know in ten years labels won't exist? 
Goodbye DVDs and compact disks

Still living off your catalog from 1982

Kun sä rintasi painoit
Vasten mun sydäntäin

Jari Sillanpää,"I see trees of green, red roses too
I watch them bloom for me and you

The bright blessed day and the dark sacred night
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of the people passing by
I see friends shaking hands, saying, how do you do?""

Peaufiner des bails dans l'sale, négocier l'amitié quitte à traverser le plexus
Une escalade du partage de grec au rayage de Lexus
Pendant que la foule se demande lequel suce
Rien de plus, on m'traque de peur que j'enfante

Jarod,"Face à l'amour d'une femme, on est souvent démuni
Tu peux pas compter sur la rue car ses acteurs sont désunis
J'ai souvent fait le mauvais choix en faisant passer les potes avant
Mais c'est les potes qui m'ont tiré dessus, j'me suis retrouvé à plat ventre
En me relevant j'ai vu une femme qui me tendait la main
J'm'attendais pas à ça donc je lui ai dit ""Reviens demain""
Entoure-toi des bonnes personnes, homme ou femme tant que c'est des gens biens

J'arrive qu'avec des attaques légères
Histoire de pas les brusquer, ça bute
Viens donc me chercher dans le tièk, sale pute
J'encule ces mecs, ils attendent ma chute
Ça devient dangereux quand on quitte la ZUP
Dès qu'ils sentent la patate ils se calment
Ils savent gérer mes nerfs mieux que moi
Fuck les Stups, ils tapent dans la me-ca
Y'a que notre son qui tourne dans la ve-ca
Fuck un mec qui paye mon avocat

J'fais d'la zik, j'ai lâché les grammes

Tu t'fais plumer gava, t'as le zen enfariné, gava
Tu connais l'équipe depuis que t'as fait l'con, t'essaies d'nous baratiner, gava
Passe moi la maille j'ai chaud (chaud)
T'as pas balancé, bravo!
J'veux bien que tu ramènes du gros
Tant qu'tu nous passes l'info
You-voy c'est l'7.5 tu connais l'thème, ça rer-ti d'Paname à Los Angeles
Fuck ton game on reste entre nous, même si on saute des bombes, nous, personne ne nous baise
Toutes nos armes viennent de l'Est, tu dis ""Pardon"" j'te laisse
J'vais les éliminer dans la minute, ramène le best, j'lui aif c'que j'vous aif

Sur la vie d'ma mère ils font pas l'poidva
J'te parie même mon brava
T'es mort dans le film, moi ça va
Car j'compte jamais sur mes gavas
J'viens de Paname mec, ça sent le traquenard
Mon flow dans l'game, c'est la traque-ma
Même ta vieille pute, sens la tate-pa

Tu connais les bails, on arrive en déboule en balle, on fait du sale
7-5 y a du flow mon ami, wesh, wesh!
On va dégommer les bacs, tous les allumer nous back, on est àl, on va ramasser les sesterces
Dans le calme, j'prends d'l'avance car ils stagnent
J'compte toucher des grosses dalles
Pas le sol du comico d'la rue de Parme, gava
Ça va, j'ai connu le boycott un peu comme monsieur M'Bala
J'marche dans la ville, tu guettes, tu fais l'malin
Sors le 9, tu danses la lambada
(Wesh Jarod, c'est quoi les bails? Ça-va céper ou quoi?)
Ouais, ouais, c'est ça mon pote
J'te dis qu'il m'faut mon dû, rien à foutre d'avoir la côte
Beaucoup d'meufs me courent après, j'te cache pas qu'ça m'sert à rien (bang bang)

On m'a dit de marcher comme un homme, je l'ai fait mais les autres le font pas
J'ai juré que j'allais y arriver seul ou non
J'l'ai juré que j'le ferais tout seul car j'l'ai juré que sur mon nom
Et j'viens d'en bas...
Est-ce que tu sais ce que ça veut dire?
Ça veut dire que j'ai vu mes amis se retourner contre moi et pire
J'les ai vu souiller mon honneur, entendu mentir à tort
Car ils étaient frustrés que j'avance, ils se sentaient petits car j'étais fort
Ça veut dire que j'ai eu des années difficiles, la rue dans le froid y'a rien de magique
Attendre jusqu'au matin le ient-cli et quand tu rentres, t'affrontes la miff
Tout ça pour gratter un billet que tu vas utiliser dans le mal
Notre mentalité n'est pas saine sûrement parce que nos rues sont sales
Ou peut-être l'inverse, y'a que les sirènes qui nous bercent
J'me suis mouillé pour des putes donc j'étais seul à prendre l'averse
Et j'ai eu mal, mais je l'ai jamais montré, j'essaie de vesqui les tes-traî
Se mettre en avant c'est s'exposer, c'est pour ça que je reste en retrait

J'ai été battu par les mots
Dans le désespoir j'ai trouvé la night

Il m'a fallu du temps pour reconnaitre que j'étais qu'un homme comme vous
J'viens pas d'en bas, moi, j'arrive d'en dessous
J'ai découvert mes limites dans le zoo
J'suis le genre de mec qui fait ce qu'il dit donc mes ennemis j'les finirai
Tout le monde se méfie quand j'fais du bien à cause de mon vécu de criminel
Et j'ai peur du mal, oui, j'ai peur de l'humain
J'ai que ma réput', j'ai rien construit d'autre, j'ai peur de demain
J'surveille tout le temps mon dos et scrute mes partenaires
La vie est courte, j'suis pas Tony : le monde ne peut pas m'appartenir
J'ai quitté le périmètre, pour voir de loin la merde
Mais quand tu sens la merde, partout tu vivras la même
Dis-leur Djoudj' : y'a qu'avec une arme qu'on prend du recul
Une vodka-RedBull pour que t'aies la pêche pendant qu'on t'encule
J'suis de sortie, j'claque mon bénéf, j'ai rien amorti
Pousse-moi 10 kils que j'ai l'impression d'être dans la partie

J'suis attiré par la rue, j'en sors jamais, c'est comme une drogue

Baroudé la night, j'ai compris que tu vivais tous les jours l'dernier jour de ta life

J'suis dans ma vibe, j'ai tout connu, j'me rappelle des ambiances dans le zoo

Puis j'ai perdu mes potos, j'ai dérapé trop tôt
Entre la rue, les parloirs et les visites à l'hosto
On a quitté les rails depuis longtemps pour avoir la vie d'un boss dans le zoo
Et j'ai peur de perdre toutes ces années qui s'estompent
J'en ai perdu la tête depuis qu'ils m'ont coupé le son

M'serre pas la main on a pas le même code
Ou plutôt prend moi dans les bras j'te prend comme t'es
Un bon mélange on appelle ça un cocktail
Mais les couleurs se dissipent, j'verrais la fin en noir et blanc
Tu veux des me-ar on a les plans, mais la plupart sont des mythomanes
Ils t'arracheraient le bras pour poser une teille-bou
Le genre de HK qui finissent au del-bor
à croire qu'ils sont bête ils font gol-ri ils veulent tout
J'suis loin de penser qu'ils mériteraient une belle mort
Et j'ai peur pour mon âme, peur d'm'en aller en m'étant éloigner de sa lame
J'ai sauter sans regarder, j'me suis briser les os
Plein de fois, destinée
J'voulais qu'on m'aime car j'étais frustré

Et vous m'avez menti ou peut être même vous étiez en train de mentir à vous-même
Oui je m'aime sinon qui le fera
J'suis un putain de mytho je m'aime pas
Et t'en as pas marre de faire ce qu'ils veulent
Et t'en as pas marre d'encaisser tout seul

Et sinon quoi de neuf?
Le marmot grandit
Il grandit dans un monde qui veut pas de lui
Et il y a du vice dans la partie, comment être fair-play?
T'as réussi? J'ai reçu aucun faire-part

Et je pleure tous les morts quel qu'il soit

Et tout ce temps perdu est perdu
Prend une tof et garde la en tête
J'veux pas de toi en fait
Dégage tu me déranges
Je t'ai tout donné t'as merdé, mais moi aussi qu'est ce que j'ai merdé
Et je me souviens de ceux qui m'ont bordés
M'ont ils rendus service?
Quoiqu'il arrive j'les ais remerciés
Pour conclure j'suis dans un merdier
Et papa et maman qu'en pensent-ils?
Ils pensent qu'ils on foirés leurs vies
Parce qu'ils ont foirés leur fils
Parce qu'il s'est arrété à 6
Parce qu'il a grandi dans la ville
Parce que ses parents aimaient la vie",Merdier,2014

J'ai fait les mauvais choix, toi aussi t'as fait les mêmes
On a fait des dégâts juste parce qu'on voulu qu'on nous aime
T'as toujours suivi mes pas, t'as jamais bégayé
Tu restais droit même quand la police venait nous réveiller
J'm'en souviens comme si c'était hier, j'en suis fier
On se ressemble jusqu'à nos pères
On avait beaucoup d'argent mais on voyait jamais la mer
J'ai des souvenirs de dingue, j'en fais des rêves
Et toutes ces histoires de flingues, j'en fais des cauchemars
Comme quand j'étais dehors et que tout le monde était au chtar

On est pareil, on a jamais bégayé devant un schmit

Et j'étais pas le seul à vouloir les mettre ien-b
J'vais tirer dans le cœur car on m'a volé le mien
Tu veux un bail à moi on se fight
J'ai fumé, barodé la night avec mon khei
On a mis tout le monde dans la vibe, on avait tort
Car à cause de ça, y'a des hommes qui ont vu la mort
J'ai pensé qu'on était les best, j'avais tout faux

J’vais fumer le game, j’ai 4 managers on va dégommer les bacs en mode tsunami
Mon gava, j’ai pas la tête à faire des blessés
Oui, ça vise au millimètre et compte les décès
J’ai déjoué la défaite, j’peux ap l’encaisser
Ils ont réveillé la bête, j’vais ap les laisser

Sushi Man, coupe des têtes comme un Sushi Man
Coupe des eue-que comme un Sushi Man
Précis comme un Sushi Man
J’vais parrainer ta chute, entouré de mecs solides
J’fais que de marquer des butes pendant que tu loues des bolides
Poto, va tartiner ta pute, laisse-nous faire de la money
Avant qu’on te fasse une folie, tu te prends pour Sangoku j’suis Broly

Devant moi les mecs sont tous polis mais quand ils parlent derrière, ils abusent
Ils se mettent en valeur grâce à mon blaze
Au lieu de porter tes couilles, tu m’accuses
Si j’ai le faveu c'est pour éviter le corps-à-corps
Gava, toute ton équipe me suce, ils ont peur de voir la vallée de la mort
J’ai pas besoin d’éliminer, tous mes ennemis s’éliminent tous seuls
On a grave le seum, on arrive dans le zoo
Faut qu’on pète le score, tes gars bouffent le sol
On a connu la gamelle et la branlette le soir
Fais des piges de shtar pour par reuch mon ami
Tous cagoulés dans la breuch, mon ami
Coup de crosse dans la tête, mec, passe-moi la maille
Quand les schmitts m’ont pété j’ai dit ""C'est juste un ami""

Jarod,"Toi tu voulais m'aimer à tort
J'attends la mort

Qu'est ce tu m'raconte j'suis un bonhomme
Même quand ils brisent mes colonnes
J'peux prendre une rafale pour mon pote
Qu'est ce tu m'raconte j'suis un bonhomme
J'donnerais jamais ton nom au schmit au schmet qui veulent te banane
Trop de faux amis avant j'avais peur mais mourir c'est banal
J'porte tellement d'pêché sur le dos J'compare au poids de la gâchette
Le choix est lourd la décision est ferme moi personne m'achète
Si la route m'a tué, la récompense m'a consolé dans les moments de doutes
Je n'adore que Dieu je n'écoute que lui j'en ai rien à foutre

Mon ami j'suis tenu par les mots on a qu'une parole
On a qu'un honneur quand tu pars c'est fini la money t'racole
Le pouvoir n'est rien tu le possède pas c'est lui qui
Décide, mon ami on m'a pris le meilleur enfant j'comprenais Ikki
J'ai tué ma chance comme tous les miens j'ai des remords ca m'arrive
J'ai tout détaillé dans mon message mais la bouteille dérive
Ils veulent me suivre quoi d'neuf mangers d'la pierre
Marcher à contre-courant quand t'es sur y'a qu'ca à faire
Quand le cœur hésite, la main tremble
Ton amour m'étouffe desserre la sangle
Amis, j'attends rien toi même si c'est pas grand-chose
Je me mets jamais à nu quand j'parle en prose (yeah)
Mais les vers me déshabille ma femme s'ra jalouse (jalouse, jalouse)
Et la haine m'appelle j'la connais vicieuse mais j'l'épouse
Et j'travaille peu pour une des sept catégories sous l'trône
T'a vécu par le chrome tu mourras par le chrome
Et la nuit j'rêve de voler comme un drone
L'époque est froide on vit avec des clones
T'es d'humeur peureuse les armes à feu réconforte
Si la montre est pieuse détrompe toi les années sont fortes
Les femmes trouvent nos tempéraments durs car les mamans sont mortes
Vos rythmes me dégoutent deux poids deux mesures boy les balances s'en sortent
J'suis avec ma bande mais j'sais avancer tout seul
Prêt à mourir pour le gang ça c'était avant ma chute

Qu'est ce tu m'raconte j'suis un bonhomme
Même quand ils brisent mes colonnes
J'peux prendre une rafale pour mon pote
Qu'est ce tu m'raconte j’suis un bonhomme

Si la route m'a tué, la récompense ma consolé dans les moments de doutes
Je n'adore que Dieu je n'écoute que lui j'en ai rien à foutre

Toi tu voulais m'aimer à tort
J'suis une sacré pourriture j'attends la mort
Et j'voyais par toi j'étais fou
Et mes remords sont bien enterré dans un ... trou
J'ai déraillé j'suis quelque peu instable
Mais putin j'ai posé mes lles-coui sur la table
Zoulou tu voulais que j'perde
Zoulou tu voulais m'voir étouffé dans ma merde
J'en suis pas loin et je l'mérite
J'médite quand t'agis et j'agis quand tu médites
Une symphonie l'art de la guerre
J'me suis reconnu en Leonidas genoux à terre
Rappelle-toi d'la vie gava quand on était au fond
Elle était belle elle était bien au fond
Sale pourriture vous m'aurez pas (ohooh)

Jarod,"Rêver de faire de grandes choses, assumer ses échecs
Pleurer seul dans une cellule, avancer à poil dans la neige
Tenir tête au bas monde, leur montrer que tu n'es pas comme eux
Essuyer la haine de ceux qui voient en toi leur ennemi
Il est minuit et demi, maman va s'inquiéter sérieux
La ville est belle tant pis pour maman, j'y apprends la vie j'y ai trouvé Dieu
Parle-moi des autres, parle-moi de ceux qui t'ont fait regretter
Détester le mensonge au point d'être amoureux de la vérité
L'aimeras-tu si elle se retourne contre toi mon ami?
J'ferai ce que j'ai à faire mais je voulais quand même avoir ton avis
Avant, pourrais-je survivre à l'été ou à toutes vos banalités?
J'fais la diff' dans mon domaine, c'est qu'une histoire de tonalité
J'ai voulu mourir avant de vouloir vivre
Connu la haine avant de connaître l'amour
La chaleur du glaive, la douceur d'une trêve
Si ce n'est juste un jour, ne me racole jamais
Ne me recale jamais tu sais ce que je vaux
J'vais faire de la monnaie, la monnaie ne me fera jamais, j'suis d'Panam gros
Tire despi comme John Wayne, criminel comme Hurricane Carter
Fonce-dé à la Baudelaire, j'fous la merde dans votre putain de quart d'heure
Qui ne m'aime pas qui veut un tête à à tête
J'suis has-been ne m'appelle pas, va danser avec les stars
J'ai voulu m'en aller avant de couler mais cette année la putain d'gava j'ai fini au shtar
J'suis un mélomane, boyboy, j'suis le meilleur pour les allumer les fous les couche-tards
J'illumine la ville, j'illumine la ville
J'alimente la polémique tu m'connais, ou pas
Quand j'arrive c'est no limit j'peux te sauver, ou pas
Icare voulaient mourir jeune, Eagles of Death voulaient rester danser
Foulek depuis le collège, gun calé sous la ceinture depuis le premier passé
J'ai quitté mon groupe, car il aimait pas me voir briller
J'ai quitté ma groupie, car elle aimait pas me voir prier
J'ai quitté mon épouse, car elle souffrait de me voir crier
Et je l'aime encore, car elle assumait de me voir plier
Un jour j'suis peace, un jour j'ai la haine
Mes proches en bavent, mais c'est moi le premier dans la merde
Sachez, que je ne veux pas être idolâtré
Fâché, car je les vois se sentir au-dessus des hommes
Ces artistes, ces médias, ces patrons
J'suis pas mieux, si j'ai déconné pardon
Et toi tu jactes, toi tu jactes, fais attention
Peut-être qu'un jour j'pourrai penser à toi en me réveillant
Miroir miroir dis moi qui j'suis, j'vais péter les plombs
J'suis sûr d'une chose, j'ai toujours voulu être un caméléon",Caméléon,2016
Jarod,"Yeah 75, c'est le 75, rien ne change gava

Je suis seul avec mes codes, je sais qu'ils m'ont jamais compris mais ils faisaient semblant
La monnaie m'appelle, je suis sorti pour la prendre
Et je voulais être quelqu'un ça leur a jamais plu
Des conflits d’intérêt, la guerre a duré 100 ans
Et je t'avais aimé pour de vrai, est ce que tu m'entends
J'arriverais pas à vivre en mentant
Et si je te dis que c'est nous les perdants
Est-ce que tu me suis encore
Et tu m'entends si je tire au TEC-9, un gain de temps
Aucun de nous n'a fleuri au D5
Pourtant on y a fait le printemps
Quand je t'ai connu, t'étais une belle plante et je t'ai vu faner avec l'age et les épreuves
Et je t'avais trouvé, j'avais envie d’être comme toi qu'on vive en même temps
Rappelle moi, rappelle moi que je suis un mec orgueilleux
S'te plait rappelle moi, tu m'as trop manqué ste plait rappelle moi
Rappelle moi, pourquoi tu m'appelles pas
Rappelle le moi, je suis dans un cul de sac
Mais au moins je suis seul dans mon cul de sac
J'ai plus le temps, j'ai grandi bêtement
En rentrant chez moi avec du sang sur les vêtements
En me convaincant que la vie de la rue, c'était la belle vie
Et c'est pour ça que je suis encore dans la rue aujourd'hui
Flashback, les choses ont changé, on se comprend avec un hashtag
Je perd pied, je perd pas le nord, j'ai la nausée
Et je suis obligé de sortir un peu de rosé
Je suis là où je suis parce que j'ai osé
Et je veux plus percer
Ton amitié m'a percé, en bien ou mal je sais plus
Tout ce que j'en sais, c'est que j'ai trop vécu
Je vois pas de vertu mais je veux pas prendre une balle perdue
Et je voulais partir, je suis un mec sincère
Je mens pas à ceux que j'aime, je suis réel sur scène
Mais j'ai des envies de tuer quand mon cœur se serre
Je t'ai tout donné et j'ai regretté d’être sincère
J'aurais du jouer un rôle putain comme toi
J'aurais quitté la taule plus tôt comme toi
Gava je sais pas si tu vaux mieux que moi
T'es pas un criminel comme moi

J'encaisse mais j'ai pas les mots donc je tape sur un mec
Ou sur un beat à l'arrache désolé j'ai peu de moyens
Mon frère on a vu les nôtres tomber par dizaine
Et sans plan B je les vois plus ils ont l'air d’être païens
Y'a des malheurs dans la vie, je suis au bord du canyon
Boy plus rien n'ira mieux, on a flingué nos doyens
On a fait foiré nos gamins parce qu'on était à bout
Depuis l'enfance et j'ai prié pour pas virer pareil hein
Mon corps cède, je me bats où Marc Dorcel a pris la tangente
Je vis incognito et je connais tout à part la mort
Et les aveux ne t'approche pas de ma vérité car elle est tranchante
Perds tout ton sang et meurs, je t'avais prévenu
Et me revoilà sur le banc des prévenus
L'avocat savait qu'Adam a péché pour un fruit
Donc il a menti tel un diable résultat ils m'ont pas retenu
Ils m'ont libéré à tort je suis encore un criminel mais je paie donc je sors
Ferrari et putes bien habillées, je veux aussi mais j'envie jamais votre sort
Je suis né dans un but, je l'ai trouvé, j'ai joué solo mais je connais pas le score
J'ai voulu être fair-play, pardonner mais j'ai fini par tuer je connais pas le sport
Et je voulais partir, je suis un mec sincère
Je mens pas à ceux que j'aime, je suis réel sur scène
Mais j'ai des envies de tuer quand mon cœur se serre
Je t'ai tout donné et j'ai regretté d’être sincère
J'aurais du jouer un rôle putain comme toi
J'aurais quitté la taule plus tôt comme toi
Gava je sais pas si tu vaux mieux que moi
T'es pas un criminel comme moi

Ramène moi la lune, je pourrais délaisser ma plume
Tant pis si j'ai pas de thunes, j'ai plus envie de faire la Une
J'ai avancé dans la brume, ça veut dire que j'suis pas un nul complet
Je donnerai ma vie pour un couplet
Ou même une mesure, j'oublierai mes blessures
Je sais que tu me comprends
Ramène moi un homme et je le féliciterai
L'époque est dure et s'accrocher l'est encore plus
J'ai tout chanté au moins je serai mort sans aucun secret",Criminel,2016

Je suis l'antillais en entier, fais moi des gâteries
Je fais mon billet pas le temps de crier
Je recharge mes batteries
Je rappe pour le 19 car c'est l'Afrique et c'est ma patrie
Je suis dans la partie, je fais des alley oop

Je veux pas de ton gouter, gardes tes chips c'est good
Au mieux envoies la plaquette j'la té-fri c'est cool

Aucune porte de sortie pourtant ma frappe vient des Antilles
Ma came arrive en bouteille, épuré en liquide
C'est moi qui la cuisine un peu de bicar et c'est solide
Les junkies sont affamés et plutôt dépressif

Minuit heure du crime, le crime est déjà commis
Les petits se lèvent à l'aube pas le temps de réagir

Fais attention à c’que tu vas raconter à tes gars sous whisky
Sous whisky y’a pas d’potes, petit padawan
Tu les feras plus fumer sur l’joint
Ils iront tout dire à ton ennemi
Mon gava tu m’estimes, j’te renvoie du respect
Tu m’demandes c’qu’il va s’passer
Moi j’crois qu’ils vont y rester
Bang bang j’ai allumé tout l’monde

Va l’dire à ton monument il t’dira qu’j’suis un vrai
Un motherfucking bulldozer, il va s’mettre à Mozart

JaRon Eames,"Though you've decided that our love is wrong
And think that we should part
It seems as though I have loved you so long
You'll always be in my heart

Is it a sin
Is it a crime
Loving you dear like I do
If it's a crime then I'm guilty
Guilty of loving you

Maybe I'm wrong dreaming of you
Dreaming the lonely night through
If it's a crime then I'm guilty
Guilty of dreaming of you

What can I do
What can I say
After I've taken the blame?
You say we're through
You'll go your way
But I'll always feel just the same

Maybe I'm right
Maybe I'm wrong
Loving you dear like I do
If it's a crime then I'm guilty
Guilty of loving you",Guilty,1996
JaRon Eames,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,1996
JaRon Eames,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true

I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove

Keep feeding me rappers
I'll eat 'em like cancer

But fuck it man, I'ma keep doing me cause

Some people say I'm famous, tell me that I made it
Some other people never heard of me at all

I'm staying high as Buzz Aldrin
Major Tom can hear me coughing
I'm falling out of gravity (""someone help, I think we lost him"")
Hit the stage and show these people how I do this shit so often
Got em yelling like they're Paul Revere on horseback outta Boston
You critics can't deny it, shut your mouth and keep it quiet
Now I'm out here getting bread, you'd think I'm on a Subway diet
I do this shit the livest, so yo please don't kill my vibe, bitch
Or I'm setting off a riot in this bitch, don't even try it
I've been working everyday, I think I need a vacation
And your girl been feeling me just like a TSA agent
So even if you haven't heard of me, at least she did
And even though that pisses you off, don't blame me kid!
Some people hate the fact that now I'm on my way
Some people love every fucking word that I say
Some other people still be like ""who is he?""
But fuck it man, I'ma keep doing me cause

Aaron Schwartz in(?) that pussy, hit it like Arnold
Mr. Drummond, Willis, Kimberly, looks like a porno
Skeeted in her face, I treat that bitch just like a urinal
Webby tell these hating niggas slit they wrist
Every track we on we take a shit on it
Ladies show your tits, meet a nigga back stage
Where you’ll see me pull my dick out and lick on it
Me and Webby hurting
And we murdering any motherfucker that's looking at us sideways
Cut the body five ways
We skin em and drop em off on the highway
These pussy ass niggas so irate, we got em screaming…

Yeah I got em saying
Ohh noo, ohh noo, ohh noo, ohh noo

Doing the hottest three activated
Murdering many men and make 'em say god is a rapper, wait
Better bow before Nina, don’t even try to spit at the great
Sick, then I’ma get pissed at em when they get wack and fake
Bitch, get on my dick quick, give it a lick it, acclimate
Get what you’re giving, get with the gift and go gravitate
Acting a ape, I ate up a animal I aggravate
Whole lotta people getting a whiff of the Niner
They loving a nigga cause I’m a hell of a rhymer
Women are looking finer, I never decline her
She wanna climb my timer, stick it in her slimer
I get the pudding, never gotta wine and dine her
When a busta run up with a broken heart he get a shiner
When it comes to murking on music I’m a deadly designer
I’m drinking my Hennessy mixture out of a Steiner!
If you tripping on my bucker I’ma cut a nigga up with a machete
Cause I’m running with a gang that’ll bring that flame
With a thang and it’s heavy
You don’t wanna fuck with a Tech N9ne
Or my nigga JB or Chris Webby
Havin everybody sayin “oh no”, bustin up the window of a 6 Chevy

Yeah I got em saying
Ohh noo, ohh noo, ohh noo, ohh noo

We don’t fight fair, we right here

From the second they see us coming, I got em saying…

Hold up
On your mark, ready, set, go
Look at Web flow
I be jabbing with the right and then I hit em with a left blow
Knock em back in time like they chilling with Bill and Ted, yo
To a land before time, T-Rex ho
So many bars you would think I’m living on Death Row
Webby’s just a motherfucking dog, where’s Petco?
Followed a plate of kibbles n bits with an egg roll
Genius in the laboratory cooking blue meth, yo
Call me Heisenberg, cause when I rhyme with words
These motherfuckers are behind the curve
I drive and swerve, turn and I ride the curve
And hit every pedestrian that doesn’t find the nerve…
...to get out of the way, “Jarren did you see that shit?”
Yeah maybe you should drive, cause the weed I hit
Got me feeling so loco, la vida, bitch
Why you even pass me that shit?
But fuck it man I’m an animal, but you never seen my species
Brand new breed they discovered in CT
Homegrown bitch, yelling “feed me, feed me!”
And every listener is pressing repeat
Bitch I got a sick mind, stomach bug in the brain
Insane, you gotta keep me handcuffed with a chain
But I’ll still break out like Burt Wonderstone
So anytime you see me coming, yo, I got em yelling out..

Yuck, she won't leave me alone
Every five seconds, bitch blowing up my phone
I'm paranoid hoping she don't show up at my home
What the fuck was I on? Pills and Patron

How bitch, damn, I had my cock locked up
With a latex condom, and we just fucked two days ago
Now how the fuck a baby pop up?

And now I regret it, and Jarren, you're a fucking liar
I only know you because of fucking Hopsin, okay?
And I genuinely thought you were a nice fucking guy
So I sucked your dick, and you made fun of me
You made fun of me for sucking your fucking cock

Jarren Benton,"K-K-Kato on the track, bitch

I prayed for my enemies, I told the lord to bless the both of us
Papa threw the deuces, but fuck it, I never hold grudges
My worst fear is to die broke
Life in the jungle would rip the horns off a rhino
Music always been a part of us, mama was never hard on us
I was always worried when she had to ride the MARTA bus
Started drinking young, cause them Koreans never carded us
Young and black, but they didn't give a fuck and it was obvious
Lifestyle of a dope boy is simply captivating
To niggas turning Master Splinter on the affidavit
I'm jewish with the bread, every dollar's calculated
These niggas sideways, this nine'll get them calibrated
I'm just a dreamer asking God to shine a little light
These niggas soft and they'll probably die in a pillow fight
I'm smoking hashish out of a silver pipe
I told that bitch to run the jewels, word to Killer Mike
Promethazine and Sprite on ice, when I ain't feeling right
I ain't concerned about vices, bitch, I'm just living life
These hoes gon' let us cut, just like a kitchen knife
I'm on that kryptonite, I break them when I flip the dykes
I eat beats and then I spit the bone, a pistol's chrome
Catch me in the old school, bumping Vic Damone
Mister Benton home, niggas get to falling back
Cash rules everything and nigga, I want alladat

Fuck the world, bitch, I want alladat
Cash rules, nigga, gimme alladat
I ain't playing, I want all of that
Kicking down your door, bitch, gimme alladat

Name a nigga in my city that can fuck with me
Besides the OG's, y'all pussy niggas is weak
Nightmare On Elm Street, put these niggas to sleep
Old frog ass nigga, I dare you faggots to leap
Lame ass niggas can't walk in these pair of shoes
Jump out airplanes and shoot at coupes, while I parachute
High as a paratroop, old school like a pair of Troops
Rappers wear a suit, cause this bully gon' bury you
I'll disable y'all, niggas agitated like the cable off
Southern niggas spilling hot sauce on the tablecloth
Think the god's soft, then this K about to break them all
Pussy ass niggas getting jealous cause we taking off
Imma feast, got your bitch cooking quiche
Hundred grand at my nigga's grave, may he rest in peace
Kick game like a priest, I told you, I'm sucker free
Politic with rich Jews, while spilling wine on a fleece
Toast to tomorrow I'm sipping wine on a beach
I rhyme like a beast, the nine inside the Caprice
Garbage ass nigga, your fucking lines is weak
And you can lose life if you fuck with mine, capiche?
I've been this way, show you how the switch blade, penetrate
I fuck hoes, that look like Gabourey Sidibe
I stuff bricks in a pillow case and hit your face
These narcotics got me feeling, like I sit in space
Cash rules everything around me
Money over bitches, told these lame ass hoes to get around me

A-Town's royal, you motherfuckers should crown me

Jarren Benton,"I done risked my life for this so fuck some
Lame ass fuck nigga saying he ain't feeling me
That shit just made me stronger
So keep on shooting bitch you ain't killing me
I still wake up worried like fuck it
Any minute everything could come crashing
And it's back to them bullshit 9 to 5s
And them niggas behind your back laughing
Like, where the fuck did I go wrong
Fight suicide thoughts like hold on
I don't ever wanna go back when I felt insecure
And so low y'all, I went so strong
Too much pain I need an oxicodone
Left for dead in the corner, no coat on
Brain was so gone, that was so long
Couldn't get a break no Turbo Ozone
Same old slow song we out there too
Some die young, didn't get a chance to
Live their dreams, just a bullet from a 9 millimeter
Going in your head like shampoo
Get going, still fight the same for you
Don't let this fear paralyze and keep holding you
One day you wake up today through shit
Tomorrow these unloyal fucks will get over ya
Live great for my kid's sake
Spit pain over mixtapes
And you find out who your real friend
Cause when shit gets tough and them niggas turn away then that shit's fake
Last year I had to shed a few tears
Lost a good friend, had to pour a few beers
Why when everything goes right
Niggas find a way to fuck it up, still waking up with new fears

And every time you hear me I'm trying just to wind the clock back and keep my 15 minutes of fame
Knowing every second that the clock ticks a million other people trying to take my spot and get in the game
This is all I've ever wanted and it's all I know so I gotta hold on
I gotta do it for my family, I can't let them down, I'm so afraid to fail, but they think I'm so strong
But I got Atychiphobia
I ain't come this far to fall
I got Atychophobia
No I ain't come this far to fall
I got Atychophobia
The world's all watching, the world's all waiting
And I don't know why I'm so afraid
But I got Atychophobia

Break down when the clock stops
Hot on the downhill movement
What the mother fuck have I been doin
Everybody got their own illusion
Stop watch as my life fades
Hopscotch and run tyrades
Till the lock pops and I fly straight
I'ma stock shots and run sideways
I'm made in the ice age
Don't cross blades on an off day
Cause I rock stages, not cosplay
These fake fucks are off broadway
Stock shades on my face of course
Time melts into the base [?]
To the great divorce and I pray for more
Than just a countdown faster than [?] was

Why these bitches standing in line for their new phones
I'm scheming and plotting and working my objects and learning my new wrongs
Repping the fam and cooking the ham we hotter than two songs
They know who I am but the fans that'll have me on record broke out of the group homes
With some new [?] in Miami the Cadillac's two toned
No time to be wasting, my homies are famous
We never look back, we been too [?]
The music is strange and the singers are dangerous
I'll never grow old and the clock will be painted
I'm feeling immortal and popping like Orville
We all got a phobia, gotta [?] the waistline

And everytime you hear me I'm trying just to wind the clock back and keep my 15 minutes of fame
Knowing every second that the clock ticks a million other people trying to take my spot and get in the game
This is all I've ever wanted and it's all I know so I gotta hold on
I gotta do it for my family, I can't let them down, I'm so afraid to fail, but they think I'm so strong

So everyday I would practice
And our relationship would then fall apart
Now it's over now sings the fat bitch
And you was thinking about marriage
And I was thinking about me
And my shit was so far from being together
I was out here blind on these streets
Trying to beast a rhyme over beats
And these pussy niggas so weak
And my city felt so lame then
And I was stressed not getting much sleep
And my mind was thinking so fucked up
I put hip hop before anything
A lost king though I was finna reign
But for you it's something I can not explain
And I was fighting so much disbelief
And these pills can bring much relief

And I was feeling so lost then
My head was tripping over my regrets
And you didn't even want to speak with me
And I was feeling different frequency
I started drinking more frequently
And you would then loose belief in me
And I was still chasing rap
And you began hating that
'Cause you would bear all the burden
And I wasn't there that's a fact
And my dreams seemed so close to reach
And there was I so wrong
'Cause when I realized all the hurt I caused
I put a pistol to my dome
Like fuck it I ain't want to live life
And everyday was looking so dark
So much sacrifice on this flight
I was fighting off all of my disbelief
And this liquor bringing so much relief
And I just wanted to be in them flashy lights

Wait 'til I catch the new nigga slipping
Thought I told you shit now is different
I pop a matic, get itching, look
Holding it steady, ready, let me get loose
This is something I do daily
Too many people going crazy, zany
Losing their minds, so I strap on my safety, yup
I burn this shit down
You see where I'm going, so now you start to come around
Fuck you, you had your shot
Now sit back and witness, I climb to the top, bitch
Shut the fuck up, I'm paranoid and I'm buzzing
My homies now, I can't trust them
Betrayal's now the new custom

I rip the fur off the back of a bear
The blade's precise I could chop off a patch of his hair
Bitch I am a god, riding on the fucking handle bars
Black BMX, AR15 tear you and your man apart
Going like Tony Montana, they poppin' them hammers, I fall off the banister
Gargantuan, keep your favourite rappers body parts in a canister
Fuck anybody that doubted me, ever looked down on me
Where the fuck where you? Now you're so proud of me

It's killing my hope, I don't even feel it no mo'
Sometimes I say fuck this shit but I ain't willing to go
Stealing my soul, there's reasons I can't leave it alone (fo so)

From the moment my pen hit the page
My vision was getting on stage
Dreaming about it, they told me that this was a phase
You getting to big for your britches, remember your age
Huh? What the fuck that mean?
Tell 'em doubt me they be reading 'bout me
All this passion you would have to beat it out me
And they said I would never leave my county
Kill that noise, I couldn't let them breath around me
All I could ever see is drowning
All I could ever see is drowning
All I could ever see is drowning
Now that ain't no problem but nothing but sharks
I rob 'em, I never needed no help
I should dealt with the fuck I felt
Fuck drowning, I became a shark myself
Momma said keep your head up
My nigga said keep your head up
You hating niggas went head up
I ain't get fed so I'm fed up
Get some was a proud day for every chick I got head from
I hope you follow, I'm drunk with power like it's creatine in this red cup
Lose it, now fuse it
It's useless like using a toothpick as a pool stick
Somebody hating, give two shits
Just make music till I got hot like when it's humid in Houston
Fuck, truth is I don't even know why I do this
I done came so far but I still feel lost and about to lose it

As of lately my fire's been lower
Dizzy Wright said I might
Need to put a light to some weed to get my mind to tremble
But that ain't me so I'm digging real deep to write this shit
Yo I'm at five percent
I hope my career does not die in limbo
I wake up just praying my fuse is lit
Cause I don't get hyped like I used to get
Back when I would hop in the booth and spit
I'm too immune to this
Stuck in my thoughts, am I a lunatic? (fuck)
Fuck this music shit, what is Hopsin? I don't know who it is
I do give bitches spontaneous hunger
And when I do there's a cloud of raining and thunder
That you'd hate to get under
And when that happens ain't no place to get comfort
I'm late for the monster, you may be a goner
I put listeners in the craziest slumber
A note to peasants, my vocal presence
Is so perfect that fans get so obsessive
And cry to my shit but don't confess it
When I'm in my zone you feel that power and passion
My godly words can speak louder than action
And don't forget it nigga

That's a first for me
Silence is golden
Go through the motions
Silence is golden
The same color that my throne is

Yeah
Damn can't believe that my homeboy dead
I still feel shocked like I'm shot in the head
I woke up and cried till my eyes turned red
I wish it was a nightmare that I just had
The coroner just put my nigga in a bodybag
And his momma turned away cause she cannot witness that
And I ain't know what to say
When I was standing with your dad
Only thing that I could think was ""goddamn this is sad""
Man we was just laughing on the weekend
That was your goodbye, guess it just sinked in
No words that I can jot with the ink pen
To describe the way I feel, I guess I'm still grieving
I wish that I could bring my nigga back
He ain't even know how much he meant to me
And that was wack
That I couldn't even express it
Till he laying on his back
At his fucking funeral, when I ain't know how to react
Yeah, we supposed to get rich together
God had another plan for you that was better
I said a prayer to your momma and your whole family
Rest in peace dawg, you my homeboy forever
Yeah, I know you living in the sky
I wish I had a better way to tell my nigga bye
Make sure you cherish every moment that you spend
With your people, cause you never know
Tomorrow they could die
Uh, you believed in me homie
Yeah, and for that I thank you
I know you in a better place
Prolly up in heaven cracking jokes with them angels

Damn, there we go, not speaking again?
Out the front door a nigga leaving again
I rode around the city pissed off
About some bullshit you said
Make me feel like I ain't breathing again
I get back, and we ain't talked to each other for like 2 days
Damn girl, who pissed in your Kool Aid?
I apologise a trillion times, make it a trillion-one
But this time I'm too late
Yeah, I guess you fed up with my shit
To get through that cold heart I need an ice pick
The look on your iris, so lifeless
Remember them good times we had
That was priceless?
Damn, did I fuck you up that bad?
You need space now, I guess I expect that
I'm trying to break through them walls that you put up
But I don't even know where your head at
Yeah, I guess I better let her fly away
Its hard to cope with the pain, I wanna die today
I'll find a fucking hideaway to hibernate
I sit and let this liquor wash the hurt
Like a tidal wave
And oh yeah, by the way
If I could take all the hurt back I'd find a way
I guess I'll pop another pill so I can sleep
And let my brains cook
Like I put my head inside a microwave
Yeah, now I feel like a loser
I knew all the wrong I was doing
I would lose her
Now I see the light, amen, hallelujah
But I'm stuck in my shit
Like I sit in cow manure
World went crashing when I lost my co-pilot
Ringing in my head, somebody turn off the sirens
She ain't even talk to a nigga
And it hurts so bad
Now all I do is drown in your silence

Where human effort is all in vain

[Chorus:]
Were it not for grace
I can tell you where Id be
Wandering down some pointless road to nowhere
With my salvation up to me
I know how that would go
The battles I would face
Forever running but losing this race
Were it not for grace

So here is all my praise
Expressed with all my heart
Offered to the Friend who took my place
And ran a course I could not start
And when He saw in full
Just how much His would cost
He still went the final mile between me and heaven
So I would not be lost

Forever running but losing this race

Speak of dream's descent 
Washed away by the storms 
To graves of cynical lament 
Dirty canvases to call my own 
Protest limericks carved 
By the old pay phone

And in your picture book 
I'm trying hard to see 
Turning endless pages 
Of this tragedy 
Sculpting every move 
You compose a symphony 
And you plead to everyone 
See the art in me 
See the art in me 
See the art in me 

Broken stained glass windows 
The fragments ramble on 
Tales of broken souls 
An eternity's been won 
As critics scorn the thoughts 
And works of mortal man 
My eyes have drawn to you 
In awe once again

Feel the scars and wipe the stains

Blind words will fall

You're logical, you can't find
Any reason to believe in love

Raining for days

Lift me up so high
That I cannot fall

Lift me up and keep me from drowning again

And guilt that overthrow me

Across are weak
And the frustrations fill the

And send them falling to the sea
They say that I can walk on water
If I would follow and believe
With faith like a child

Sometimes,
When I feel miles away
And my eyes can't see your face
I wonder if I've grown to lose
The recklessness I walked in
Light of you

And send them crashing to the sea
They say that I can walk on water

They say that hope can make you see
They say that faith can find a Savior

She thanks her Jesus for the daisies
And the roses  in no simple language

Or the stars in the heaven
As close as a heartbeat
Or song on her lips
Someday she'll trust Him
And learn how to see Him
Someday He'll call her

She fall in His arms
The tears will fall down
And she'll pray

I want to fall in love with you
I want to fall in love with you

Sitting silent wearing Sunday best
The sermon echoes through the walls
A great salvation through it
Calls to the people
Who stare into nowhere
And can't feel the chains on their souls

He's more than the laughter
Or the stars in the heaven
As close as a heartbeat
Or song on her lips
Someday we'll trust Him
And learn how to see Him
Someday He'll call us
And we will come running
We'll fall in His arms
The tears will fall down
And we'll pray

I want to fall in love with you
I want to fall in love with you
I want to fall in love with you
I want to fall in love with you

We want to pray

Not close enough to call You 'God'

Somehow it all ends up the same 
Soaring on the wings of selfish pride 
I flew too high and like I charus 
I collide 

With a world I try so hard 
To leave behind 
To rid myself of all but love 
To give and die 

To turn away and not become 
Another nail to pierce 
The skin of one who loves 
More deeply than the ocean 
More abundant than the tears 
Of a world embracing every heartache 

Can I be the one to sacrifice 
Or grip the spear and watch 
The blood and water flow 

To love you, take my world apart 
To need you, I am on my knees 
To love you, take my world apart 
To need you, broken on my knees 

All said and done I stand alone 
Amongst the remains of life I should not own 
It takes all I am to believe 
In the mercy that covers me 

Did you really have to die for me? 
All I am for all you are 
Because what I need 
And what I believe 
Are worlds apart 
And I pray 

On my knees 

I look beyond the empty cross 
Forgetting what my life has cost 
And wipe away the crimson stains 
And dull the nails that still remains 
More and more I need you now 
I owe you more each passing hour 
Battle between grace and pride 
I gave up not so long ago 
So steal my heart and take the pain 
Wash the feet and cleanse my pride 
Take the selfish, take the weak 
And all the things I cannot hide 
Take the beauty, take my tears 
The sin-soaked heart and make it yours 
Take my world all apart 
Take it now, take it now 
And serve the ones that I despise 
Speak the words I can't deny 
Watch the world I used to love 
Fall to dust and thrown away 
I look beyond the empty cross 
Forgetting what my life has cost 
Wipe away the crimson stains 
And dull the nails that still remain 
So steal my heart and take my pain 
Take the selfish, take the weak 
And all the things I cannot hide

A locking peace no understanding

Fly away around the sun

Life embraces bitter land

Trade in all our words for tea and sympathy 
Wonder why we tried  for things that could never be 
Play our hearts lament  like an unrehearsed symphony 

Not intend 
To leave this castle full of empty rooms 
Our love the captive in the tower never rescued 
And all the victory songs 
Seem to be playing out of tune 

But it's not the way 
That it has to be 
Don't trade our love for tea and sympathy 
'Cause it's not the way 
That it has to be 

You begin 
And all your words fall to the floor and break like china cups 
And the waitress grabs a broom and tries to sweep them up 
I reach for my tea and slowly drink in

'Cause it's not the way 
That it has to be 
Don't trade our love for tea and sympathy 
'Cause it's not the way 
That it has to be 
Don't trade our love for tea and sympathy 

So fare thee well 
Words the bag of leaves that fill my head 
I could taste the bitterness and call the waitress instead 
She holds the answer, smiles and asks one teaspoon or two

Don't trade us for tea and sympathy 
Don't trade us for tea and Sympathy

The things you should hold me to 

I stand here, wondering 
And I'm waiting

My ear is twisted in all the thoughts 
A glimpse of truce just because 
It's always almost never close 
I close my eyes  hide the distance 

Enchanted by the face of peace and when it turns 
To sunken eyes and waterfalls 
Unsatisfied with simple things entangled in the chords, 
I can't take any calls 

I stand here waiting 
I'm calling

Hoping you find me in my need

Are you still here?

Our hearts  a bubble maker's dream 
Moved on by winds of everything 
As we deny that love is still the king 
Not as weak as we make him out to be

I owe only to the Giver of all good things

And if I can't, let me fall on the grace that first brought me to You 
So if I sing let me sing for the joy that has born in me these songs 
And if I weep let it be as a man who is longing for his home 

And there's more that dances on the prairies than the wind 
And more that pulses in the ocean than the tide 
There's a love that's fiercer than the love between friends 
More gentle than a mother's when her baby's at her side

It's the ride the way that she needs it.

Whatever she wanted for whatever you need.
Speechless and silent while she takes everything.

Kryptonite underneath; you used to be her superman,
But now you're fading, now you're weak.

Never how or why it worked to play the big lie.
To dim the truth from causing wet eyes.

Whatever she wanted, for whatever you need.

Jars of Clay,"We made it to a strange town
Going down the wrong road
Like any story retold
Couldn't find a common ending

We're way gone, be gone,
Looking for our own way
We needed a distraction
You said you were redemption

We knew it as a wrong turn
We couldn't know the thing we'd gain
When we reach the other border
We look out way down past the road
We come from
We're looking at redemption

It was hidden in the landscape
Of loss and love and fire and rain
Never would have come this way
Looking for redemption

We were looking out past the road we came from
Looking at redemption
It was hidden in the landscape
Of loss and love and fire and rain

What a sordid histories they played
The drama of redemption

Jars of Clay,"The Valley Song (Sing of Your Mercy)

You have led me to the sadness
I have carried this pain
On a back bruised, nearly broken
I'm crying out to You

I will sing of Your mercy
That leads me through valleys of sorrow
To rivers of joy

when death, like a gypsy
Comes to steal what I love
I will still look to the heavens
I will still seek your face
But I fear You aren't listening
Because there are no words
Just the stillness
And the hunger
For a faith that assures

I will sing of Your mercy
That leads me through valleys of sorrow
To rivers of joy

alleluia, alleluia
Alleluia, alleluia

while we wait for rescue
With our eyes tightly shut
Face to the ground using our hands
To cover the fatal cut
Though the pain is an ocean
Tossing us around, around, around
You have calmed greater waters
Higher mountains have come down

I will sing of Your mercy
That leads me through valleys of sorrow
To rivers of joy
I will sing of Your mercy
That leads me through valleys of sorrow
To rivers of joy
Alleluia, alleluia
Alleluia, alleluia

While you're turning over tables with the rage of a jealous kind
I chose the gallows to the aisle
Thought that love would never find
Hanging ropes will never keep you
And your love of a jealous kind
Love of a jealous kind

Trying to jump away from rock that keeps on spreading
For solace in the shift of the sinking sand
I'd rather feel the pain all too familiar
Than to be broken by a lover I don't understand
'Cause I don't understand
