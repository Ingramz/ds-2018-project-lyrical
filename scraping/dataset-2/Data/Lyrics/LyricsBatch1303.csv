1967 Spurs Squad,"No one here can love or understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
Pack up all my cares and woe, here I go, winging low
Bye, bye, blackbird

Where somebody waits for me
Sugar's sweet, so is she
Bye, bye, blackbird

No one here can love or understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
Make my bed and light the light, I'll arrive late tonight

"1975 Jackson, Mississippi Crusade Choir","Why should I feel discouraged, why should the shadows come,
Why should my heart be lonely, and long for heaven and home,
When Jesus is my portion? My constant friend is He:
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.

I sing because I'm happy,
I sing because I'm free,
For His eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches me.

""Let not your heart be troubled,"" His tender word I hear,
And resting on His goodness, I lose my doubts and fears;
Though by the path He leadeth, but one step I may see;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.

I sing because I'm happy,
I sing because I'm free,
For His eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches me.

Whenever I am tempted, whenever clouds arise,
When songs give place to sighing, when hope within me dies,
I draw the closer to Him, from care He sets me free;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.

I sing because I'm happy,
I sing because I'm free,
For His eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches me.",His Eye Is on the Sparrow,2011
1979 Sydney Crusade Choir,"O Lord my God, When I in awesome wonder,
Consider all the worlds Thy Hands have made;
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,
Thy power throughout the universe displayed.

Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!

When through the woods, and forest glades I wander,
And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees.
When I look down, from lofty mountain grandeur
And see the brook, and feel the gentle breeze.

Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!

And when I think, that God, His Son not sparing;
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;
That on the Cross, my burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died to take away my sin.

Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!

When Christ shall come, with shout of acclamation,
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart.
Then I shall bow, in humble adoration,
And then proclaim: ""My God, how great Thou art!""

Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!",How Great Thou Art,2011
1987,"Jag var uppe hela natten
Lyssnade på skivor och tänkte på dig
Jag, jag har inte sovit
Jag har gått och letat efter dig

Hej, var är du nu?
Är du kvar i Amerika?
Hör mig ropa

Jag hörde våra låtar

Du, är du verkligen lycklig?
Lever du ditt drömliv utan mig?

1995,"À chaque ligne, un nouveau flow, un nouveau départ
Une nouvelle histoire, un nouveau rêve, un nouveau cauchemar
À chaque ligne, on s’disperse, ouais, laisse-les gazer
À chaque ligne, on s’dit ""j’perce"" mais ça n’reste que du papier

À chaque ligne j’essaie d’écrire un ""Life's a bitch""
Et tous mes cinglés me disent ""Flingue-les!""
Mais j’taffe au Fried Chicken, d'ailleurs, je file
Mais j'reste au grade de rimeurs, j’époustoufle
Les bougs, les pousse tous sans un gab’ de videur
À chaque ligne, je m'demande si ça va marcher
Devant leurs clashs lâches de nazes qui n’me touchent pas
Je n’me mouille pas comme un mec qui ne sait pas nager
À les entendre, tous ces escrocs veulent vivre thunés
J’ai les ches-po vides mais à chaque ligne fat ou fine
J’taffe, rime et m’active, mon égo me dit ""tue-les!""

À chaque ligne, un nouveau flow, un nouveau départ
Une nouvelle histoire, un nouveau rêve, un nouveau cauchemar
À chaque ligne, on s’disperse, ouais, laisse-les gazer
À chaque ligne, on s’dit ""j’perce"" mais ça n’reste que du papier

Parfois, j’me mens même quand j’suis sincère
C’est peut-être que j’sais pas qui j’suis, on vit dans un cercle
Et ils voudraient qu’on s’insère, mais ça c’est
Pas dans mon programme, j’reste pas sur la ligne
J’suis qu’un hologramme
Mes potos clamsent mais j’rassure la mif’
Et j’assure la diff’ pour qu’mes tires-au-flanc kiffent
Je m’active et chaque ligne est un tir offensif
J’suis qu’un minot pensif, 'vec mes textes qui tuent dans la poche
À chaque ligne, t’as mes testicules dans la gorge
Mec, si tu vends la drogue, belek à tes côtes
T’as Fennek à té-cô même si tu prends la porte
T’inquiète, c’est pour mes srabs et ça l’fera
C’est facile, à chaque ligne c’est pour Mekra et Malfra, S-Crew!
Qui taffent des phases de barges, parlent de cash et de tass
Passent le cap de l’âge en gardant leur âge et la rage
En parlant d'Rap, j’ai le talent rare à la Tribe Called Quest
Pas d’compét’, chaque ligne, y'a des bails qu’on baise
Posse trop speed, c’est 1.9.9.5. Et Zoxea aussi
J’aurais pu faire des crimes pour du ‘gent-‘gent
Ma team vous tue franchement
Mon Rap est un métro: à chaque ligne y'a du changement

À chaque ligne, un nouveau flow, un nouveau départ
Une nouvelle histoire, un nouveau rêve, un nouveau cauchemar
À chaque ligne, on s’disperse, ouais, laisse-les gazer
À chaque ligne, on s’dit ""j’perce"" mais ça n’reste que du papier

À chaque ligne j’parle de pèze, de tess' et de fesses
Des textes qui puent la défaite, j’laisse le rêve où je perce de côté
Dégoûté car j’flaire des verbes de merde
Faible quand j’parle de la zeb
Je gerbe et j’emmerde ma verve, écoutez
J’suis jamais sérieux dans mes vers
En effet, ma vérité est en-mée-fer
Demande à mes frères : Sneazzy est endetté
Han, j’prends, parfois la grosse tête mais j’fais
Semblant, j’suis comme ça juste dans mes textes
Je m’invente des biatchs, des riads
C’est uniquement pour la frime
J’consomme pillaves et cigares, c’est juste pour faire le mec street
Et parfois je chante, ouais, j’tente pour la flambe
J’suis qu’un homme donc quand j’frôle la mort, parfois, je tremble
Les types ricanent lorsque j’esquisse gimmicks
Mais ce n’est qu’un trip lyrical et les MC's m’imitent

À chaque ligne, un nouveau flow, un nouveau départ
Une nouvelle histoire, un nouveau rêve, un nouveau cauchemar
À chaque ligne, on s’disperse, ouais, laisse-les gazer
À chaque ligne, on s’dit ""j’perce"" mais ça n’reste que du papier

Ouais, à chaque rime j’ai l’intention d’faire kiffer
À chaque ligne, t’as l’impression que j’ai sniffé
Dans ma Black Team, y'a aussi des whites donc elle est tisse-mé
On t’fait l’amour comme Barry White sur un beat rythmé
Qui t’met la pression depuis 1.9.9.5.?
Zilizo, alors on dit quoi d’neuf zinc’? Nada!
À part qu’mes flows les rendent fadas
Boom Bada, rimes lance-pierre, intifada

À chaque ligne, un nouveau flow, un nouveau départ
Une nouvelle histoire, un nouveau rêve, un nouveau cauchemar
À chaque ligne, on s’disperse, ouais, laisse-les gazer

1995,"Yo, un Double Neuf Cinq pour un, retour à la source
Décollage imminent, cool-al, joint
Les gars de mon posse supportent le mouvement
J'dis ""fuck"" et fous le camp car le Rap
C'est froc baissé tout le temps puis reviens réglo
Chacun de mes flows choque les petits, les grands
Alors sort d'la dilettante, voilà l'équipe qui sort du lot
Un cinq majeur bien efficace ambiancé par l'homme DJ lo'
Ouais, les types sont carrés, frère, avec des rimes qui t'percutent
Une horde de zoulous derrière et deux-trois gadjis qui les scrutent
Mes parents s'doutent de rien
Pensent que la school me tient par les couilles
Donc j'taffe la née-jour et le soir devient l'idole des foules
Ouais, et la capitale bouge la tête, l'Hip-Hop
De nouveau prend de l'ampleur
J'lui chante mon envie de conquête
La musique, ma source, et les loux-ja s'taisent
T'hallucines car ma troupe à le groove dans les veines

On prend l'Rap à la source, rime, sample et flow
Un-neuf-neuf-cinq, l'équipe qui t'met des gifles au micro
En deux-zéro-double-un, on rentre dans l'jeu
Et les cartes changent de mains donc lève les tiennes
On kicke sec aujourd'hui comme demain

J'suis sur ma partition, y'a pas de limites
Dans la rythmique contrairement à la religion
Mais ma3lich, le Rap est la force, cette voie me rend fort
Que vois-je? Le Diable nous fait danser, dans la boîte de Pandore
Ici pour vivre du son, on te fiste le fion
Donc j'glisse, je chill car je rime pour dealer du bon
J'ai la maîtrise du don, de savoir n'faire qu'ça
Mes potes sont pas des Saint-Bernards mais ils flairent ça
Les Nikes, je sais mettre ça, les flows, je sais faire ça
Osmose 'vec le crom' doré, faut qu'tu guettes ça
Des sources j'en ai des tas, des dizaines, Nas et Big L
Jay-Z, AZ, bref, les flows qui glacent l'épiderme
Le flow est une des sources comme mon père et le village du bled
Fragile, nostalgique, ""Phaal mais quel chiard tu fais?""
J'esquive tempête, pour vivre dans l'rêve
Y'a pas de fric, mais je rime sans cesse 'vec ma team dans l'16

Le Rap était mieux demain, donc laisse nous faire
On vient barrer le passé pour tracer une ère nouvelle
Ambiance petite frappe dans la ville, je zigzague sans la tise
Tu kiffes ça, j'laisse des stigmates sur ta figure
Comme une fuite d'eau, j'avoue, j'me la coule douce
J'prends pas de cuite, kho, j'affronte tous mes coups d'blues
Les mecs sont vifs, font kiffer, poto, qu'est-ce qu'on dit?
Mate, c'est d'la rime fat et pas de la cess' qu'on deale
Un-neuf-neuf-cinq dans le game, l'impression qu'ça fait des lustres
Demande à Jaz, il te dira qu'il en a graffé des rues

Vrai, j'ai niqué des marqueurs mais j'ai dit qu'j'étais rappeur
Donc j'prends l'mic, fédérateur, et j'vais l'kicker 'vec ardeur
J'crée un disque et les crétins disent ""ce gars-là se goure""
Mais nique les vieux détours, j'veux r'ner-tour à la ce-sour
Donc j'la recherche comme la fraîche
Les mains dans les poches, tard, mais à part
Mes poings, j'ai rien que des joints dans mes pochetars
Même si l'hash est chère, j'la che-cher dans ton quartier
Pendant qu'des fonblards font de l'art
J'lâche des vers devant ton car grillé

J'ai été puiser à la source de milliers de fontaines de jouvence
Mêlées à la foudre et aux viviers de conquêtes émouvantes
Hissé par la foule pour oublier que ton père est souffrant
Opéré souvent mais suffit d'un son d'trompette et tout change
Avant qu'je naisse dans une messe au contexte éprouvant
Avant qu'ne s'lève le glaive d'une jeunesse pompette et touchante
Ouais, petit, on dirait bien qu'le ciel a trompé tes louanges
Les anges attendent les dénouements étranges
Des contrées étouffantes, c'monde est dégoûtant
Et de tout temps j'peux compter des moutons
Leur nombre est déroutant
J'essaie pourtant tout pour rester coupant
Tous sont laissés pour compte, où sont les vrais souffrances?
Nous sommes de cette douce France où le rêve est troublant
On prend l'Rap à la source dans cette course technologique
Dans cette foule métropolitaine où tout est trop logique
Goûtez toutes ces sonorités, la Source est trop torride
Comme les boules des Porto-ricaines, écoute les prototypes

Que tu sois un shlag du game ou dans ta hype de merde une seule chose :
On voudrait que ta race décède

[Couplet 1 - Nekfeu]
Bienvenue à Zombieland, le son des ambulances et des maisons qui flambent
Heureusement, mes gens ont l’endurance face aux démons qui rampent
2995, les mort-vivants se répandent, mélanges d’étranges expériences, faites dans des tombes
Maintenant c’est tendu de sortir quand c’est sombre
Un soir je croise un zombie devant une fille étendue sans vêtements
Elle est suppliante, il lui plante en riant ses immenses dents brillantes
En tant que bon vivant croque la viande de sa cuisse tendre
Je débarque en criant « Keep cool la familia »
J’attrape la fille « vite bitch coure à l’abri là »
Il me dit « Tu veux plus voir la frimousse de ta petite femme ? »
T’inquiète, je maitrise le wing chu à la IP Man
En traitre, je lui décharge mon six-coups sur le visage
Vois sa cervelle grisâtre qui coule sur le grillage
Je dis à la fille au loin « viens faut bouger ! Oh poupée »
Elle répond pas, et se tient le dos tourné
Je l’entends ricaner, se retourne (Ahhh) pleine de boutons, bouffonne
À ton tour, je t’emmène au septième sous-sol

[Refrain] (X2)
V’là les bouffons du roi-oi-oi-oi-oi
Ils veulent notre âme ou notre argent, ils n’y arrivent pas
Alors touchons du bois-ois-ois-ois-ois
Vla du rap hardcore, C’est eux les malades ils ont attrapé la mort

[Couplet 2 - Sneazzy West]
Je me fais courser par des anciens, dépassés par la puissance
Défaite cuisante, ils n’ont pas su sauter dans le train
Les types s’étouffent, je prie pour qu’ils décèdent
Et si ces fous essayent d’en mettre j’évite les coups de griffe
J’prends mes distances très vite, je me cache, des rageux, et des barges
Le rap jeu, c’est résident evil
De toute évidence, je décide d’aller sauver les autres
Un zombie sur mon gars Nekfeu, je vais lui cogner les côtes

[Couplet 3 – Alpha Wann]
Phaal, Phaal ya ! RDV ‘vec la troupe
Faut que j’aille à la Flav' cave, je suis encore à la bourre
J’arrive dans le stud’, y’a un tordu, il a du sang sur lui. Ah ! Il m’a mordu
Ain’t no hugs G, no countries, no love, just us
But the zombie’s on the concrete
Couldn’t meet the fourth/fith, draw quick
I’m not going after you and your bitch
Turning your honey bonny, into a bonny mommy
Hit her like a bitch getting slick rich, dolly dolly
Feelin’ me? Yeah that’s the XXX B
I turn out to be like the niggas in the industry

[Refrain] (X2)
V’là les bouffons du roi-oi-oi-oi-oi
Ils veulent notre âme ou notre argent, ils n’y arrivent pas
Alors touchons du bois-ois-ois-ois-ois
Vla du rap hardcore ? C’est eux les malades ils ont attrapé la mort

[Couplet 4 – Fonky Flav]
Eh merde, le Phaal Philly s’est fait péter c’est chaud
Heureusement j’ai un plan de secours, je vais pas laisser tomber le négro
Je saute par le nêtre-fe, roulé-boulé terre-par
J’joue des coudes et jure que j’vais les dégoûter d’être là
J’appelle le Joker, maintenant faut faire vite
« On peut se capter tout de suite ? » Ouais, c’est bon il est Ok
J’arrive au RDV la transaction est speed comme d’hab
Vérifie la marchandise, c’est bon le type ne mitonne ap
Retour au bercail, bien chargé
Dégaine un tard-pé, pousse la porte et les mecs voient que je suis pas là pour blaguer
Je perds pas une seconde, j’arrose à gogo
Ils se couchent tous illico presto, y’a pas le temps pour un pogo
Le Phaal est àl, toujours aussi mal
Heureusement que j’ai le sérum, pas besoin de se traîner jusqu’à l’hôpital
Mon gars sûr reprend ses esprits peu à peu
Tout est bien qui fini bien, mais y’a trop de zombies dans ce rap jeu

Regard braqué sur la ligne d'horizon
Le brouillard se dissipe enfin
Deux mille ze-on mon équipe fait ses marques et les cartes changent de main
Les disque se vendent, les salles de concert se remplissent
Alors j'me dis que finalement j'ai ptet’ ma chance même si c'est la crise
On en a fait du chemin rappelle toi
En 2009, bruler les open mics entouré par cinq six vrais gars
Un an après les te-trai s'déclarent
Ne-jeu ou ancien mon clan décide de faire les choses bien et d'changer l'scénar'
Alors dis moi t'étais où quand j'ai sorti l'oseille
Quand j'taffais la nuit sur la source deter a plus trouver l'sommeil
Personne ne nous a mis l'pied a l'étrier
Au début ça riait et comme des grands on les a fait plier
Aujourd'hui c'est l'ambition qui m'guide
J'veux faire des morceaux positifs et marquant pour les gens qui m'suivent
Tu captes frelon on avance seul et sans rien demander
Car la vie est un test et t'y restes si t'y es pas entrainé

[Nekfeu - Couplet 2]
Devant la barbarie j'me sens
Comme une carcasse vide de sens
C'est pas facile de grandir librement
Présent narratif d'humeur macabre j'ai 17 ans
Les profs me baratinent bras sur la table en dilettante
Donc j'ai pris mes jambes à mon cours
Et glisser dans les alentours
Où sévissent des plavonds fous qui partent en couilles
Même si j'voulais pas d'embrouilles j'me les suis pris les quatre cent coups
Alors comme ça toi ton sang bout ?
Ca va t'laisser des traces dans l'cou
Vampirisé par l'envie de dissiper les dirigeants sans dignité
S'initier au cran pour imiter les grands qui s'y risquaient
J'ai pris des gifles rendues puissance mille avec l'esprit d'équipe
C'est inévitable nos vies calquées sur des films défilent
Si j'défie les flics c'est qu'ils méprisent les rites des galériens
Et nous limite débile on s'disait libre et il le fallait bien
Retour sur un passé simple un HLM une cité d'Nice
Comme on a pas d'télé le soir l'été je lis des livres
Dessine des tas d'dessins, agressif depuis la maternelle
Vu que je m'appelle Ken mais j'ai jamais dis que j'me battais bien
Alors ça craque les mains ça crache ça frappe des poings en lâche
Attrape la face trace une balafre sachant qu'demain y'aura tout l'clan
Ca sort de classe une horde de kassos passe t'façon pas d'sauvetage
Des gars sauvage et face aux shlass j'aimerais agir comme un grand
Mais j'ai peur et rien a foutre des profs menteurs j'avais ma propre bande
Mes propres enjeux

Comme des grands, on fait le bail à 6
Ca restera aç-comme
Un pour les platines, deux pour le mic'phone
Les temps sont durs à Paris donc on s'accroche
Sortez les parapluies, rangez les parasols
On fait le bail à 6
Ca restera aç-comme
Un pour les platines, deux pour le mic'phone
Les temps sont durs à Paris donc on s'accroche
Sortez les parapluies, rangez les parasols

Fermez là, j'sais faire mes lacets
Compter qu'sur mes doigts
J'rêvais d'compil mais j'ai compris que c'était con d'être sur mais doit
Avancer, pas flancher, même en mission lassé
La même envie sinon là
C'est la danse des pages blanches et
Motivé faut qu’j'y vais
J'ai plus l'temps d'attendre
J'rime pour plus que des thunes et des pulls dans ma penderie
Même si j'paye mes impôts plein pot non j'vise un autre but
En vivre un bonus
Dans c'biz bien trop d'putes
Alors j'paie l'loyer, m'éloigne des adversaires
Qui picolent, rappent, rigolent aps mais n'ont aps l'air sérieux
Nique les rimes pas dures immatures
J'rap mes déceptions
Après réflexion gratte des vrais questions
Pour ceux qui dansent, ceux qui m'écoutent
J'vise l'or, j'prie fort
Et j'ignore ceux qui pensent que ce sque-di dégoute
Mes rent-pa l’savent, Jaz fait sa voie comme un grand
Mec solitaire, mais solidaire et ça m'va comme un gant

A l'heure où j'kick ma rime
Le beurre s'fait si facilement
J'bluff pas j'vis ma vie
Les meufs sales s'imaginent
Qu'elles s'isoleront et michtonneront
Un jeune cadre dynamique
Puis rigolerons d'un p'tit gol-mon
Erreur car j'ai griller l'vice
Les heures passent si rapidement
Qu'ils ont laissé bé-tom
Moi j'suis un grand garçon j'apprends ma leçon au lieu d'baiser des thons
I'm about my business
20 ans déjà CEO
T’aura pas la finesse de l'faire à plein temps comme les 6 minots
On a sorti La Source j'étais qu'un minable puceau
On vient d'sortir La Suite j'suis encore ce minable puceau
Mais rien à tre-fou j'ai raté mon bac pour ceux de la Fnac
C'est auch
J'écrase avec mon pied gauche les bouseux de l'asphalte
J'ai la main d'la Fatma
Khamsa dans ton mauvais oeil
Et quand j'rappe ça pas l'time, sappe classe comme un proviseur
Mon daron s'est nashav j'étais encore un Razmoket
Pire, j'ai du faire les choses comme un grand et dans un j'me barre aux States

[Alpha Wann - Couplet 5]
Pour Phill Phaal l'insouciance a pris le large
Depuis l'époque de Fisher Price, Peter Parker, Spider-man
J'vis ce taff à fond, rimes dans l'caleçon
A quoi sert d'être basketteur et de jouer à Villeurbanne ?
On gratte des feuilles et taff des heures, rime tard
Fabrique des hits de rap dans le but d'enjailler l'peuple
J'attends les pluies d'ovation à la fin du film
Ca marche pas l'industrie
Pourtant les bruits de nos pas sont clairement dans ton oreille
Au fait c'est auch négro mon rêve c'est que l'oseille, les lovés soient l'fruit d'notre passion
On fait les bails frère, c'est plus la galère
J'fais le Big Boy car ça n'a pas d'prix d'payer des trucs à sa mère
Elle n'aura plus d'taff, elle mangera des crustacés
Elle aura les thunes car elle aura enfanté une star
Thunes à la pelle vu que je me tue à la scène
Maman ne m'a jamais laissé sortir avec un pull crade

[Nekfeu - Couplet 6]
Dis moi pourquoi on vit
Au fond c'est les traîtres qui me dégoutent
Affronter ses faiblesses est un luxe réservé aux braves
De moins en moins envie d'rencontrer les mc's que j'écoute
La frontière est épaisse entre l'humain et l'personnage
De mois en mois grandir comme un grand
Cogner comme un con croyant que ça m'va comme un gant
Tu crois en ta hantise mais là haut ça fait si loin
Le ciel a plus d'étoiles que le drapeau américain
Médites bien",Comme un Grand,2012
1995,"Areno Jaz :
Comment te dire qu'ici c'est Rome en pire : traitrise et fratricide
Ils veulent pas viser le Graal mais peut-être viser le crâne, si si
Donc je ne roule qu’avec mon seum
Surtout quand j’ai pas de te-shi
Dans le business en finesse et sur ce coup dans les bacs je chill
Frangin, j’en deviens sectaire et con
Mais ça le fait, ça me plait, et je sais que j’ai raison
Donc, comment te dire que j’aime pas ct’époque
Que des tass’ je dégote ou que j’ai assez de potes
Nique tes contacts décontracte, tes connexions
Tes tas de biatch avec de maquillage mais je sais comme elles sont
Ouais, et je m’en tape, je mens ap, quand je rap, j’en ai pas besoin
Devant mes gars soins, comme Nekflamme je lance des tas de joints
Et mon but n’est pas le succès, mais la réussite
C’est sordide, mais je sors ce disque, et l’art ressuscite
Jihelcee comment te dire, je fais mes affaires sans reculer
Petit MC comment te dire, eh mais va te faire enculer !

[Refrain] (X2)
Parfois les mots manquent, parfois les sentiments
Comment leur dire d’aller se faire foutre gentiment ?
Je suis comme au bord d’une falaise quand je dois me confier
Dire je t’aime c’est dur, même si le compte y est

[Couplet 2 – Alpha Wann]
Je suis ce nègre, plutôt fly, qui se tape, façon Budokaï
Pour avoir la maille du plus haut gradés des bureaucrates
Faire du hip-hop, en vivre, comment dire
Être en vie, les poches remplies de biff via mon gros empire
Impossible que les chiffres m’ôtent l’envie de rester authentique
Je sais que mes potes m’envient, mais ne savent pas comment le dire
Mon père voulait que je sois toubib, avocat, pas de vida loca
Il se fiche que je kick avec 12 types à l’occase
Comment lui dire que je haie les mathématiques
Même si je me tape des barres, le rap c’est pas des blagues
Le mic c’est ma iv
Papi je m’applique , pratique la zic à fond
Comment dire à ma gadji « je suis pas libre j’ai des classiques à pondre »

[Refrain]

[Couplet 3 – Sneazzy]
Comment te dire, sans jurer sur le Coran de la Mecque
Que je n’aime pas ce milieu, ils disent que j’ai tort de l’admettre
Tout ce qui sort de ma tête, n’est que conneries immatures
Que de bonnes rimes qui m’amusent avant que la mort ne m’arrête
C’est maladif, je deviens comme ce salop, je traîne tant d’années de mytho
Du mal à dire que mon daron m’a abandonné si tôt
Je garde le sourire tant bien que mal
J’attends mon apogée, j’espère m’en approcher
Pour qu’enfin je me casse
Loin de toute cette merde de la méchanceté qui m’encercle
J’ai hâte de toucher le ciel pour aller chanter avec mes ancêtres
Nos peines, nos galères, élevant de nos cent mille souvenirs
Comment te dire sans te choquer je ressens l’envie de mourir",Comment Dire,2012

J'me sens libre dans mon indépendance avec mon esprit de renégat
Rappant des rimes dingues dès l'enfance, nique vos équipes de relégables
C'est décidé, on va faire présider des idées farfelues
Faire hésiter l'Elysée, on a hérité du rap de rue
No limit la politique, notre politique
Un tas d'rime avec une baleine derrière les platines (Moby Dick)
J'ai comme l'impression d'avoir subit un choc cérébral
J'viens d'me réveiller, ils ont délaissé l'époque des vrais bails
Merde, faible, on vient balayer les mous du genou (Fuuuuck)
On revient mettre la bonne musique au gout du jour

[Fonky Flav - Couplet 2]
Tu devrais faire comme si, poser des trucs comme ça
Merci pour tes conseils désolé mais ça ne m'intéresse pas
J'ai toujours tout fait seul sache que c'est pas demain que ça va changer
Les grandes gueules me croient dérangé mais j'emmerde les putes qui m'en veulent
Renégat car je ne respecte pas vos idées préconçues
Vous goutez à la déconvenue une chose est sure on est là
Du fond de la salle jusqu'au premier rang j'veux que ça foute le zbeul
Et puis que l'ingénieur pousse le son
Pour que les voisins écoutent le skeud
Tes neurones grillent quand j'ouvre le feu
Voilà l'équipe qui brouille le jeu
Et tape en soum soum d'la frappe pour que la jeunesse ouvre les yeux
Croire ce qu'on nous raconte tout-par c'est se laisser berner
1995 on reste les mêmes même si le périmètre est cerné

[Alpha Wann - Couplet 3]
Nique ces cons dans l'peuple avec leur dress code
On a des liaisons dangereuses comme Glenn Close
Nique la récession, les appelés sont
Sneazz, le Fennek, ve-FLa, Zeuja pour la sélection
C'est mon taff ce bail
Le Phaal se gave de rap, de graille, de style
Et ce depuis bien des saisons
Tu crois que j'veux les strass, Phill Phaal est mystérieux
Ninja des rizières, c'est ainsi que j'me déplace
 On redébarque de Paris, pas de vieux débats style
Qui est le best Phaal ou Phaal moi je ne sais pas qui
Aime les blunt lare et la weed

Areno Jaz :
Avant que leur système m'attrape si c'est ca le rap/ j’reste un renégat/
Pour tout les types trop faux devant l'micro faut pas test un de mes gars/
On est plus un crew ni un posse/ nan un gang frère/
Une main d'humain en chaire/ dans un gant de fer/
J'ai juré que j'rapperais ou que j'raterais/ la plus rien a foutre/
C'est sur c'est âpres mais âpres/ la pluie vient la foudre/
On s'en bats nous on s'vend pas/ pour rentrer dans leur jeux/
Ou ramper devant leur yeux/ on s'ment pas ou on s'en vas/
Même s'ils font easy d'lor ils ignorent/ comment faire ce que j'pense/
Sans commentaires quand j'cause en vers/ prend l'crom en fer de lance/
Guidé par ma guilde/ et par mes valeurs sure j'tire/
Sur les gueules de morts sôts/ seul ce morceau va leur suffire/

Nekfeu :
Laisse tomber les ston-ba
On va estomper les ombres
Avant de se faire plomber l'estomac
On va questionner les bons gars
Donc, qui va leader qui va rivaliser
On a la rime préparez vos idées
On est unanimes ils seront inanimés
Si les animaux ont de l'animosité (BAH !)
Je suis un renégat je lève mon cul j'me tiens DROIT !
C'tit-pe me remercie maintenant je ne réponds plus de rien (MOI !)
Ca vient du sud de Paname et revoilà encore ma bête de bande
C'est la fracture sociale j'm'attelle à faire des entorses au règlement
Fumer la weed toute la nuit plus j'bédave et plus je palis l'ami
J'suis un renégat surréaliste comme Dali",Renegats,2012
1995,"Oh, 1-9-9-5 mon gang, venu pour mailler sans faire le tapin,
Tourne ta langue 7 fois dans ta grande bouche avant de faire le malin,

Mais on va se défendre avec le rap et le respect des anciens,
Crois-moi, aussi vrai qu'6 fois 1 fait 6, je me tiens à l'écart du vice,
Et reste droit, cheval de Troie fixé sur l'industrie du disque,
Y'a quoi, on reste les mêmes obsédés par la rime,
Un beat de Lo', tu kiffes les flows développés par ma team,
Avis à ceux qui nous prenaient pour des pitres,
On revient bousiller l'jeu, bien préparé pour le titre.

J'aime bien ça
Je trouve ça entraînant

Avec ma plume d'aigle, la fumette, j'écris la Suite,
Des textes précis, des têtes s'écrient, ""Mec c'est qui là-c'ui?"",
Un dangereux dingue de sûr, pas d'tour de passe-passe,
J'taff pour le H-H quand je flingue dessus,
Avec ce qu'on appelle des classiques dans la pochette,
J'ai c'con d'label et d'la zik dans la peau, check,
1, 2, indé', ça c'est que l'début,
Ma vérité t'assaisonne mais casse les gueules des putes

J'lance un lambeau d'pensées tantôt sensé,
Tantôt tenté d'chanter quand faut danser,
En haut ils s'en branlent des conséquences,
De l'embauche, ils font semblant d'croire au 11 septembre,
J'vais m'lancer, nique le FN, nous c'est la France offensée,
En ces temps l'slogan s'étend,
Attend on en sait quelque chose des grands élans,
Des entêtants, d'étreintes et d'la testostérone,
Et quand j'pense à la suite, j'ai mon enfance à l'appui,
Une goutte de pluie polluée de Paris devenue immense stalactite,
Et faut qu'tu penses à la suite, tu veux ton nom à l'affiche,
Dis-toi qu'changer ton histoire triste en une romance ça va vite

On évite le mauvais œil, on les emmerde,
Souvent on les enchaîne de manchettes comme des volleyeurs,
On prend l'rap à la Suite, Sneaz tente des choses,
Des rimes, samples et flows qui t'envoient à l'asile

Faisant des hymnes sans lésiner quand j'dessine des vers,
Trouvé tard sous pétard après méditation,

L’air dangereuse elle cambre ses fesses étranges
Les mecs semblent être hantés par ses belles hanches
Rendez-vous sur rendez-vous elle les voyait pas tous
Elle se respecte autant qu’elle déteste ses poignées d’amour
Selena a l’art de plaire, car je sais qu’elle leur donne le mal de mer
Elle flaire les failles des mecs, cherche le parfait mari partout
Et sa meilleure amie est jalouse de sa taille de guêpe
Le genre de fille aux idées dérisoires
Genre la biatch qui ne jure que par le maquillage
L’habillage et les leggings noirs
Relation pimenté et elle s’y entraine
Chili con carne, faut être poli pour caresser ses collines Silicon Valley
Son mec, un lourd barjo au comportement d’autochtone
Lui propose de faire une sextape, elle accepte sec
Sans penser que cet excès serait la photo de trop
(Quel traitre) Le cliché a fini sur les réseaux sociaux
Bêtise, regrets, Betty déprime le soir
La pire des défaites elle n’a plus d’estime de soi
Elle réalise qu’elle s’est faite vraiment baiser par des hommes
J’avais pas précisé qu’elle est complexée par ses formes
Tout le monde au courant l’impression d’être présente au 20 Heures

Il est minuit et quart Julie est loin de s’endormir
Car elle visite chaque soir les cauchemars de son empire noir
Elle élimine le poids, renonce à l’envie de se nourrir
Parfois aimerait mourir pour effacer l’image dans le miroir
Le reflet triste d’une fleur flétrie
La jeune et jolie Julie jeûne en rêvant de se refaire fine
Agenouillée, elle vomit le déjeuner, pleure et crie
Silencieusement se remémorant les flirts, les rires
Sonia c’est la plus fraîche, elle sort pas de gros décolletés
Peau mâte, folle mèche, Jordan collector
Elle a des fossettes craquantes, de grosses lèvres épatantes
Quand il l'observe, Nathan la trouve follement charmante
De la courbe de ses hanches jusqu’à sa poitrine rebondie
Elle étouffe, se trouve grosse, envie sa voisine Julie et
Julie est la plus prisée, la plus kiffée du lycée

On redémarre, mec, à Saint-Michel y'aura des barres
On redémarre, on a ramené des teilles y'aura des tass
On redémarre, à quai d'Austerlitz y'aura des barres
On redémarre, hé, même à Commerce y'aura des barres barres

Ce soir, la ride est bonne, frangin

Minuit passé, Paris Sud Sud change de visage
Vitres teintées baissées, BAC, dangereux virage
Et les gens sur le boulevard se guettent
A cette heure-ci, les SDF ne font plus la quête
Ils veillent à leur tête, à leur teille
A propos, fiston, monte le son, fais tourner la liqueur
Histoire de rêver même si demain RDV à 8 heures
On s'met des tours de périph' dans la vue
Des boloss dans l'équipe y'en a plus
Rien que deux trois fêlés dans la rue qui tentent leur chance
Peu vont dans le bon sens, obsédés par la thune
Mais en garde à vue subissent sentence, t'as vu
Allez, viens, on roule, roule jusqu'au lever du jour
Baisse ta vitre, y'a pas d'embrouilles, on reste cool sur le parcours

Sur le qui-vive avec quelques disciples, on prémédite un attentat
J'fais l'fou, dégaine de ministre dans une 404
S'met doux, teille-bou de Grey Goose parfois du cognac
A trois sur un gros niax, j'touche à rien pourtant je paye tout
Mais où sont les mecs qui dealent?
Mes gars veulent s'mettre mal
On allume les pédales, néons sous mes Air Yeezy
On ride une avenue, on débarque sur l'boulevard
On parle de ma tenue et on élague nos moustaches
Je change de station, j'suis gêné quand j'parle à l'antenne
J'ai une bande de ratons qui ont l'élégance à la française
On roule des mécaniques, quelques meufs traversent
J'teste mon sex appeal, je m'arrête et je baisse ma vitre

1995,"J'ai vu les pyramides qui ondulaient
Le désespoir, l'édifice triangulaire
Construit à la sueur des esclaves
Si on reculait les aiguilles du temps infini
On verrait l'insignifiance de circuler 
Avec les pupilles blanches aveuglées par la thune
Dans ma tête le soleil et la lune sont équidistants
Mes idées se heurtent aux limites idiomatiques
La Terre paraît ronde en équilibre hydrostatique
Je lutterai quand ça sera l'heure 
Et le désespoir me porte
Jamais on cessera de rayonner, eh yo mec
On voit toujours la lumière ancestrale des étoiles mortes

Nique les faiseurs de fausses promesses
C'est le début de notre suprématie
Faudra pas sucer après monsieur
Je maîtrise la lumière, kaléidoscope, prisme
Eheh, voilà ce qu’apprécient nos potes!
J'compte m'évader de la trice-ma

Sachez que je donne le hip hop le plus pur
Et du taf aux archéologues du futur
DANS LEUR GEMER dit 
Qu'il pense que c'est l'heure du verdict
Ne jugez pas encore, on n'est qu'à la première brique
On commence les fondations de l'empire
S'ils n'aiment pas, tant pis
Tous les contrats sont remplis

T'auras beau chercher les portes de secours
Les issues sont identiques
Et moi je serai momifié dans des tissus Givenchy
Les générations précédentes n'ont pas su faire
C'est triste dans la pénombre d'une éclipse
Je remarque une trompe d'adultère
Je suis déçu de la manière par laquelle
L'occidental a rendu dispensable Jésus de Nazareth
Je laisserai des écrits avec ma merde
C'est décidé et j'expliquerai qu'avec des débiles sur la Terre
C'est ça que j'enseigne, faites place aux seigneurs
Aux meilleurs, on se voit pour vos obsèques
Je crois SOUCEGRAN je fais fais preuve de ruse
Autour du cou j'ai l’œil d'Horus
Ils font les fous, au fond ont peur de m'offusquer
Dans toutes les assoc' y a toujours un traître
C'est que là je m'inquiète

Encore une journée comme les autres
Les haineux ne me font plus d'effet

Tes paroles démago va les faire avaler à d'autres

Même si tu t'excuses
Je vais pas te mettre en cloque et perdre du temps

Pleins jactent, un brain de rage
Mais la plupart sont juste fans de lui
J'en connais plein qui auraient déjà jeté l'éponge
Mais je suis au dessus je bosse dur
Donc ne crois pas que je vais répondre
Parait que je suis gay, moi je pense que c'est leur fantasme
C'est triste la bêtise reste pendant que le temps passe
Parait qu'on est bourgeois
Et que sur notre chemin y avait pas d'impasses
Aucune justification la leçon c'est que ça ne m'atteint pas

Bla Bla Bla! Ils adorent parler plus que les autres
Bienvenu dans le tournoi de la jactance bienvenu dans la fosse
Là où beaucoup t'attendent pour te jeter des cailloux dans le dos
Là où si peu assument en face de te dire oh non c'est pas nous
En gros ça se passe la pommade quand c'est la mode
Puis ça se rétracte un an après quand est redescendu la cote

Hey yo, v'là un discours
Un petit truc sur les gens qui tapent pleins de vices
J'ouvre ma parenthèse sur ces gens qui ont le vagin qui coule
Laisse-les gamins qui jouent, y'a rien qui bouge
On contrôle comme les porteurs de l'insigne
Tu sais ce qu'on dit des jaloux donc ils s'amincissent tous
J'espère qu'un tapin qui tousse leur fera pleins de bisous

Donc ma mif' est mise de côté
J'ai pris plus de revers qu'à Wimbledon
Et, ouais, ça raisonne, c'est auch'
Mon ancien rêve lointain est devenu
L'nouveau cauchemar d'mes proches
Ma mif et ma petite meuf, mon père m'a dit:
T'as choisi ta voie, ne viens pas m'pleurer si j'meurs
Ton daron qui dit aç', bien sûr, c'est tendu
Tu te sens comme pendu par le cordon ombilical
Dur d'être à fond et d'être motivé si l'bonheur d'un
Fait le malheur de quinze, faut peut-être modifier l'équation
Comme toi, j'me mets à cogiter en pleine célébration
Car j'fais du profit mais je n'arrive pas à profiter
Les superstars et bien j'les plains
Être sur le toit du monde est subjectif
Objectivement, t'es juste loin des tiens
Juste un passionné, c'qui me fait vivre me tue
J'respire ce truc comme un oxygène empoisonné

On m'a dit tant d'fois: ""Les amis, ça change""
Tant d'fois: ""Les amis s'arrangent entre eux
Pour que l'argent qui rentre finisse entre leur phalanges""
Que je me suis méfié dès l'départ
Mais je n'regrette rien, parfois, j'suis froid, c'est vrai
Mais toujours préparé au coup d'te-trai qui vient de loin ou d'près
Peu importe je reste le même
Gambergeant mes thèmes en scred
Réglant mes problèmes, en fait
Je ne vais pas t'faire de dessin, on avance vite, c'est vrai
Mais pousse la réflexion, évite le vice et les crises entre frères
Réfléchis avant d'faire tes dièses, fuck la morale et la crari
Mais dis-toi que dans l'Hexagone
Tu t'plantes à seize, tu payes à vie
Casier judiciaire, mauvaise orientation scolaire
Les ardoises envers le système ne s'effacent pas au K2R
Le savoir est une arme de guerre, l'impatience un poison
La violence un mystère que n'résout même plus la raison
Bref, faudrait peut-être penser à sortir du troupeau
Au lieu d'sortir les couteaux et d'finir tête sous l'eau

Y'en a qui m'aident, ouais, j'ai la tête en l'air
Mais ça, j'me souviens et j'me sens tellement fier
En guettant les messages de soutien, on vit de vrais emmerdes
Vu qu'même ici on se dérouille entre frères
En temps de guerre mais ma mission se déroule
Et tu sais pour qui j'le fais
1995, gros, tu sais pour qui on l'fait
C'est pour les petites frelonnes qui font survivre l'honneur
Qui se méfient de l'homme, pour les petits qui fredonnent
Nos titres, qui m'redonnent l'envie d'écrire le bonheur
Malgré les litres de tise dans mon bide de triste lover
C'est comme pédaler avec la pression d'celui qui est BAC+10
Hélas, les BAC+10 ont du fric que je n'ai pas
Au début j'bédavais, j'avais l'impression de niquer la justice
Mais là c'est la justice qui me nique quand je bédave
C'est horrible de s'énerver pour une drogue
Même avec ses potes, ça peut dégénérer pour une dose
J'ai pas besoin d'ça pour avoir de l'inspiration
C'est juste une excuse pour ne pas avoir d'implication
Je m'amuse mais j'deviens dingue ensuite
La parano, j'abuse, ce sera pire à 50 piges

Y'a rien d'plus à savoir, j'aime le rap de rue vénère sur face B
Puis chiller avec des soces dans l'ombre, rigolant des boloss
Isolé des cas-sos qui polluent la sphère-atmos en nombre
Rien qu'ça jacte quand mon possee braque les ondes
La concurrence flippe, verbale gymnastique qui t'attrape en pompes
Le bitume en fond mais ouais c'qu'on sème te couche
J'traîne avec une pine-co ronde, laide et des gens louches
Puis j'donne un pas d'danse pour tous les loux-ja
Bouge ta troupe j'ouvre la soute sors le H et l'puchka
Tout à coup ça doute, moi je reste cool façon Bouddha
Puis trace ma route, à la source on se retrouvera

Tu fais pas le poids donc passe l’oseille et casse-toi ou paw paw
Tu goûtes les rafales de mes armes soviets
Flav' t'opères, on blague ap', et même tes potos sucent
Je suis Doctor Octopus, quatre patates dans ton abdomen
Deux tournées sans sortir d'album, dit moi qui fait ça?
À part 1.9.9.5., P.O.S. et le ninety-five
Je suis en train de vivre tout ce dont j'ai rêvé
Signer des paires de eins
Faire le prince
Et toucher des congés payés

Les choses se passent
Toujours insolent face aux grosses menaces
Content qu'ils pensent nous éclater
Je comprends qu'ils se sentent dépassés
Par des gosses encore de l'âge borderline
Ils sont morts de rage à cause de l'âge

Comme un chef indien Comanche qui voit des ombres funestes
Je communique avec des ronds de fumée
De multiples lois mais un unique dieu
Pointe le fusil de chasse sur la face des tuniques bleues
Put your hands up
Je veux que mes dièses bougent
Désordonné j'perds les données comme Jason Bourne
Ils font le fric go, je rigole des naïfs
L'école du flingue en or à la Goldeneye
Je contrôle mon engin comme l'inspecteur Gadget
Mauvaise réputation comme une tasse-pé de quartier
Je connais les cachettes trop tard pour les fonblars fuyez
Je suis comme une gâchette mes reufs sont là pour m'appuyer

Mille neuf cent quatre vingt quinze, voilà pourquoi je crèverai
Les bougs se bougent pour voir mes pouvoirs de très près
Les jets-pro et les proses flingues planqués dans le falzar
Je t'emmène lentement en même temps, en mettant le bazard
Dans les esprits et je pourrai tenter de t'expliquer
Mais j'ai ni le temps ni l'envie
Sans cesse j'écris des raps puis je fais voila les plans
Je mets l'accent sur le vrai et
Je appuis sur la détente avec le recul
Entre amis faya dans ma mifa, y'a pas de mecs peureux, vu
Que des ceu-mé braves, fixés sur la même cible
Qui kickent ces mesures, ficelés sur accessible

Personne ne pense que tu bibi de la dope
Je flingue comme Rick Hunter, t'es aussi viril que Dee dee McCall
Je tolère pas vos rimes nan, avec ma crime team c'est plus de rimes
Éclair de génie, tonnerre d'applaudissements
La suite c'est la suite du Carlton
Jeune, riche et frais je flingue avec ma man Jaz
Appelle moi Will Smith and Wesson
Bien sûr pleins sucent
Nous on s'insure
Flingue sur l'industrie
Pour que la fin du film soit fraîche comme Findus
Pas besoin de tour de piste, direct je shoote je vise

Même si ma voix traverse l'océan comme une jeune fille au pair
Ma vie par en lambeaux comme un jeune millionnaire
Sous le ciel gris ça grille les feux, et je me dis que ça crève les yeux 
Dehors ça crie, les jeunes commettent des sacrilèges
Je me revois étant petit, zonant, trop de fierté
Je vois mon propre père, les tempes grisonnantes 
Je perds des potes putain, pourquoi t'étais en prise au manque?
Quand t'isolant, additionnant tes vices, en t'emprisonnant t'es vif
Mais qui se demande si t'es triste et ruisselant sous la pluie
Et si seulement t'existe, qui t'appuie, qui te vend?
Qui t'a dit et qui te ment?
Qui te demande, qui vis sa vie?
Qui reste gentil vis à vis des filles qui se vantent?

Grand quoi faire de ses 10 doigts

Raconter ma vie, celle de mes potes
Ceux qui galèrent, ceux qui s'en sortent,
Les vrais amis, ceux qui t'escroquent, putain
Trop de fils de pute cachent une arme ou un puchka
Sans hésitation t'éclatent pour une dame ou un bout d'H
On vit tous sur la brèche et c'est qu'une question de temps
Pour qu'on plonge ou qu'on pèse,
C'est bien souvent qu'une question de chance
Alors, je croise les doigts et rêve d'aligner les sept nombres
Sans vraiment y croire je me vois bien propriétaire dans chaise longue
Pour l'instant je me creuse la tête sur ces quelques lignes,

Pour les réaliser, j'ai qu'mes écrits mésestimés

J'donne des thèmes comme j'les aime vec mes khos, les choses passent

Et d'emblée tes MC's en quête de flow
Rêvent tous de nous ressembler

La concurrence est borgne, j'ai peur que le Rap fonce dans l'décor
1995, voilà mes gens
Peaufinant le groove, rêvant d'entrer dans la légende
Et t'aimes ça quand mon hip-hop déboule en sportswear
Affolant les gosses, ouais, de Bruxelles jusqu'en Corse, ouais

J'aime ça! Et si y a un micro par terre, vas-y, ramasse-le!
J'aime ça! Si y a un wack MC par terre, vas-y, tabasse-le!

Un bouquin et un bocal d'skunk par semaine
Partager avec le crew l'soir sur un toit sûr ou
Smoov au miel sous l'soleil, j'pars nager avec le groupe
J'aime sortir en horde dans des bonnes ambiances
Plutôt rare, plus trop rap, nan, des bonnes ambiances

On aime nos vies d'fou!

J'évite les flics qui font des blagues nazies dans leur talkie-walkie
J'aime être libre, aucun séjour en taule qui vaut l'prix
J'aime quand les mecs anticipent
Passent en télé quand ils signent
En indé quand la fille à mon bras est élégantissime
En visite dès que t'es nue, j'aime ton corps tu gémis, ah!
J'aime quand les faux saignent du nez comme Tortue Géniale
Et j'aime ça, décortiquer le mal dans le décor, niquer dehors
J'ai vu des corps criblés de balles

Ressasser les bons souvenirs entre potos après deux trois verres
Jouer au loto en rêvant de mettre bien sa mère
Y a pas photo, pas d'arnaques, j'aime la franchise
Quand la squadra est là pour livrer la marchandise
Chiller avec ma go dans l'sud de Paname
Partir au Canada avec l'équipe pour des shows d'malade
Esquiver les stéréotypes et ramener plus de blé v'la ma
Mission, j'dois payer mon loyer et ça m'va

1995,"J’participe au mouvement général mais gamberge quand même
Ce genre de scélérat qui s’méfie du système et t’emmène
Au next level, il s’agit plus d'se laisser berner
C’est pas ton shit mais la fatigue qui maintient mes yeux cernés
Rester seul debout tous les soirs à s’demander comment faire tant de blé
Et qu'ça soit vrai entre vous et moi, je n'ai pas de plan B
J’espère juste qu'on évitera le coup d'État
Car j'avoue que leurs histoires me rendent fou des fois
Bosser, bosser, sans cesse penser à négocier
Esquiver les coups d'putes et faire prospérer mes associés
Donner du bon son, v'la mon jeu, v'la mon taff

On veut tous prouver qu'on est pas des assemblages d'atomes
Mais le plus doué des hommes est déjà semblable à d'autres
L'estomac noué si on te-mon, on est cloués au sol
Même si on voudrait quitter ce désastre en catastrophe
Et quand je cause des ients-cli sous codéine
Mon côté yang fuit le côté yin
Du haut des cimes j'dessine des signes codés inatteignables
Les ignares suivent parce qu'on est in
Je m'arrête pas, j'rappe aussi pour mon ennemi
Je veux montrer qu'on est libre à celui qui obéit
Ne te crois pas supérieur aux gens qu'tu hais
Tant qu'tu es un homme, tant qu'tu aimerais en tuer un autre
Tant qu'tu sens qu'tu erres le long du sentier
Perdu loin du sanctuaire, si quand tu rentres tu gerbes
Si tu répands du sang, du sperme c'est ça l'essence humaine
Dans ce monde où les sangsues mènent
Chope mon skeud' et participe a l’élévation

J'pense et lance mes couplets en catimini
Parce que j'ai qu'ca, j'passe le message bouclé en cabine midi
Pour qu'on s'élève ou qu'on s'énerve
Fini d'pioncer ou d'poncer des bouts d'cons et merde
J'aspire à mieux, découvrir la France en bande
Des souvenirs avant que t'entendes Jaz dire ""Adieu""
Qu'je parte d'ici, qu'je participe à mon histoire
Heureux, je groove et je ne retrouve pas mon nid l'soir
Impliqué jusqu'au cou dans mes petites affaires
Conclus 'vec un joint, une bière devant des pizzas, frère
Chez moi, c'est chacun sa part
M'souvenant qu'un sac plein de cash souvent cache un bâtard
Clash bien avare, j'parle ici d'passion
Faite qu'honnêtement, cette connaissance et d'participation
À la bonne cause de l’élévation

Il faut que je souffle, moi, la vie est un couloir, une longue route
Mais pour moi qui suis d'la ville c'est un boulevard
Si tout s'passe bien, j'suis même pas à mi-chemin encore
On m'dit d'écouter mon cœur mais j'pige rien en morse, oh
Plutôt facile, moi, j'me bute au hasch
Un peu plus au Rap et j'emmerde la bureaucratie
J'ai besoin d'ma putain de liberté de mouvement
Et dans un bureau, bah, t'es dans un fauteuil roulant
Donc nique ta cravate et ta Ford Fiesta
J'laisse les foules en liesse, depuis que j'suis réaliste j'veux faire c'taff
J'ai étudié chez oim' et en étant tout-par
J'ai jamais eu le temps de faire le gangster
Moi, j'veux être la putain d'lanterne

Certains laisseront une empreinte, d'autres essayeront de l’effacer
Comme d'autres escaladent des montagnes moi j'suis là pour les déplacer
J'espère que c'est lisible, c'est clair, les merdes j'les élimine

Je cherche les erreurs, les détours d'une vie de nul que je gratte
Avec aigreur l'été pour une minute de rap
Gravé-gravé sur un disque pendant que je marche en ville
J'entends le ce-vi de ceux qui margine, ceux qui marchandent vie
Ici il suffit juste d'une minute
Soit, sans que je compte, soixante seconde
Entre le bandit et la balance devant quelques questions
Quand l'inspecteur infect te demande Qu'est-ce que c'est que ce pilon?
Je rappe comme une discussion
Toute la nuit si tu me donnes du shit, du son
Mec les ambiances qu'on frappe dépassent toute dinguerie

Cachant les HLM assez laids pour indigner le peuple
Certains sans défaut apparent cèdent au doux vice qui les pourrissait
D'autres ont moins vu leur parents que la nourrice qui les nourrissait
C'est pour les pauvres à l'ombre de la tour Eiffel
Toujours coulé svelte en courant le long de la coulée verte
Ici faut jamais faire le mort quand un vautour veut t'affronter

Tu croyais quoi? On ne se débarrasse pas de ces traces-là
Rappelle-toi, pendant la guerre d'Algérie t'aimais t'occuper
De les torturer, ces femmes et enfants électrocutés
T'es qu'une merde atterris, que le cancer te crève jusqu'à l'os
T'es terrifié mais tu l'as mérité car t'es qu'une salope

Parce que ton style tue, parle de ce qu'on dit plus
Tard ce renoi va te proposer de bons plans (He!)
Rap sur, posé sur les gros projets de mon clan
3-4 mois plus tard t'es dans la mif' t’habite chez un frère
Un gus' bien, t'as juste besoin de ta bitch et d'un verre (t'inquiètes!)
Tu fais quelques dettes à l'amorti tu paies le ter
Mais fais belek aux têtes a la sortie du RER
Et quand ça tourne mal, sans fierté tu mendies de l'aide
T'assumes pas tes grands dires devant les bandits d' ce bled
Dans l'excès t’emprunte et pars en cavale
Sans laisser d'empreintes, même dans les sièges en train
Et maintenant (maintenant) flingue dans ton tiroir, dingue devant ton miroir
Tu pleures Salope!

Tu sais pertinemment que tu te trompes mais tu t'obstines
Cette merde est abstraite, le succès est éphémère
C'est la fin il faut que tu t'apprêtes
Mais tu préfères laisser faire
A force de trop vite s'initier au rap on rentre dans une matrice
On sent comme une machine, productivité au max

J'en ai assez de voir des femmes
Au cœur de pierre souiller le monde,
Elles confondent l'amour et le sexe
Elles veulent te faire toucher le fond
On grandit au son des innocents,
Discours grandiloquents
En ignorant que l'amour fait ressentir un manque sanguinolent
Des blessures insensibles au temps, je te l'ai déjà dit dans Suga
J'ai goûte autant de coups bat
Qu'il y a de couplets de rap sur Shook Ones
J'ai dit je t'aime à mes ex
Maintenant j'essaye de ne plus prendre le poids des mots à la légère
Hédoniste authentique, je suis foutu d'avance

Je fais le taff tant bien qui mal
En sachant que tout glisse, tant d'attente pour si peu
Bon c'est grave, j'en ai marre
De toute cette poudre aux yeux

Du vrai, du réel pour nos vœux
J'ai vu tous ces artifices donc je suis parti vite

Bien entouré non j'insiste pas
Mais frangin, si t'as rien en cours viens en tournée
Je rappe pour arroser mes potes et rouler de l'herbe
Car appliqué par amitié je fais groover le verbe
Représenter et je prétends que
Mes frères le sentent dès que je le fais chanter
Dans les textes errants en espérant que ça te fera taire pitié
Je vais faire rimer l'éternité avec la fraternité

Qu’est-ce qu’on kiffait, mes complices et toute la team
Après l’show c’était Fonky Flav' qui conduisait toute la nuit
Vrai, vrai, que des frères et l’accueil était ici
Quand l’on faisait un cut, on faisait la cueillette des spliffs
Freestyle, bouteilles de Despe' dans les locaux
Faisant des photos avec les gens blessés dans les pogos
Désolés, on s’est tape, à l’époque t’avais ton plâtre
Sautant la tête en bas dans la foule avec mon mic’
Problèmes de son donc on s’prête le crom’
Oh, merde! Sneazz' saute à 11 mètres de haut
On sait qu’il fait chaud dans la fosse, ouais, on sait qu’il fait chaud

Car on prend ça comme une vraie mini-science!

Le trajet, dans tous les coins d'la France

Peut-être que l'on évolue plus depuis les sumériens
Peut-être que l'on est trop lugubres, on a vu que l'on assumait rien
Peut-être que l'époque veut ça, je n'ai que des pensées confuses
Vu qu'on nous juge aux pes-sa, vu qu'on dépense et qu'on fume

Elle avait les hanches qui m'empêchent d'y penser
Un visage d'ange avec un penchant pour le péché
Les effets d'une drogue et le parfum d'un poison
Le goût d'une boisson aux fruits de la passion
Chaque fois, au lieu de discuter, on se disputait
Encore une te-tê, crise de plus à cause de qui tu sais
Je me souviens de nous et de toutes ses manies

Tu voulais tout le temps danser
Comment voulais-tu que je t'attende aussi?
On s'allumait des clopes et seulement
Après nos ébats comme si l'on voulait se récompenser
J'aimerais qu'on pense à ce manque
Que l'amour devrait compenser
Les hommes pleurent en cachette et ça je n'peux m'en cacher
L'amour c'est la guerre, pour ça qu'j'ai peur d'm'engager
Mais d'où me vient ce putain de besoin de vesqui?
Je me dévoile et mets les voiles sans m'investir
Que me reste-t-il?
Des relations d'amour devenues des vestiges

Rapidement, on se mettait d'accord
Entre nous deux, ça pétait la forme

Isolé des cas-sos qui polluent la sphère-atmos en nombre

De multiples lois mais un unique dieu
Pointe le fusil de chasse sur la face des tuniques bleues
Put your hands up

You fight for me but I'm hardly worth it

So dad, how's the new house?
Bet it's nice with no kids around
Mom's busy, she's been working late
Since your last check never came

That's why I feel your heart and I know
That you can be my way
And I'll say my love",Grace,2007
1997,"Hey darlin', you paint a pretty picture
The sun is clouded
(Yeah, yeah)
But we'll find our way home
Yes, we'll find our way home

Casting shadows on the pavement
Dancing toe to toe, is this all you are?
Is this all you hope to be?

Oh no, it's just all that I know
Is it enough? Are you happy?
Do you need more?

You had my heart
(Get what you want then walk away)
What more could you want?
Don't you care? Don't you care enough to let me go?
You know that it meant everything
Now everything feels far too wrong

Little girl, listen well
But you must promise that you'll never ever tell
I speak like fire, and it burns your ears
Who will wipe away your tears?

You had my heart
(Get what you want then walk away)
What more could you want?
Don't you care? Don't you care enough to let me go?
You know that it meant everything
Now everything feels far too wrong

If only you had words to make this sadness I feel go away
If only you had words to make this sadness I feel go away

",Hey Darlin',2007
1997,"Does she kiss you like I did?
Do your hearts beat in unison?
The chords are ringing out
My fingertips are like pouring rain
Upon the rooftop

Because inside this house, there's nothing left, nothing left to say
This won't break me because I'm not the drugs
I am not the pain you feel inside, when you're lying there awake
It's just the absence of blood in your veins

Drown the pain of this one
To the sound of my guitar
This song becomes our anthem
As we sing it in your car

I'm an itch beneath your skin
That alcohol that you have been drowning in
Well, it aches for a century
The one who wastes your year
The fool that you call love

Drown the pain of this one
To the sound of my guitar
This song becomes our anthem
As we sing it in your car

The radio's on tonight
So sing it if you're still alive
You're still alive
You bare it all, you bare it all

Drown the pain of this one
To the sound of my guitar
This song becomes our anthem
As we sing it in your car
As we sing it in your car

1997,"We drove through the rain
Past the evergreen trees
And we rolled just like the water
Along the veins of its leaves
And we traced our memories
Into the shape of a map
Inside the palms of our hands
Bearing the secrets unkept

and I don't think I could ever feel this way again
You should be an actress because your so good at lying
You bring my to my feet and then you leave me here crying
If the feelings are gone, then what am I left with

its true that we're young
But love is said to be ageless
The same is said of pain and desire and depression
Would it make it easier if I made you hate me
I only wanna see you happy
I only wanna see you smile

ill take these pills and shove em down my throat to keep the words ""I love you"" from escaping my lips
To keep me sleeping and keep me quiet, still
""I love you"" is the only thing I know for sure
If its time you need my love, ill give it to you

ill give you my love if you say that its time
Ill tear down the walls you've built up in our lives
As the barrier breaks between your heart and mine
You would die to forget, but I will live to remind you
",The Roads You Can Take,2007
1997,"There's a sadness in the air
On the train to Tennessee
And I know there's no angel
Watching over me

All I have to hold is this atlas and a note that reads
""If ever you are ready to come home again
I'll be waiting up but please don't be too long""

You know I never meant to make you lonesome
But I got my own plans and if you love me, understand
I've got to take this road to find out who I really am

So tonight, I'll take the long way home
And drink until I can't remember you
Or why I ever started

If I can't hold you, gonna fold you like a note
And keep you here with me

Thought about your smile
On the car ride up to Madison
Are you still letting go?
Are you still letting go?

'Cause I've been trying to move on
But I'm feeling so damn lost
Without your love, without your love

Tonight, I'll take the long way home
And drink until I can't remember you
Or why I ever started

If I can't hold you, gonna fold you like a note
And keep you here with me
I want you here with me

Tonight I'll take the long way home
Won't you drink with me until the sun comes up?
Look at what we started

If I can't hold you, I'm gonna fold you like a note
And keep you here with me

Last time and then say goodnight forever

By the choices I have made
And that's something

Spent my best years on the road
Done my share of rambling
Think I'll head back to my home

Sometimes you gotta run

For every dream I've ever chased across these great
Divided states

Song for faith

We just let it go by, by, by
And I know just who I am, when I'm out on the road

Without any fear, or your chains to safety

1998 Royal National Theatre Cast,"Subsequent to the events you have just witnessed
Similar events in cities across America
Events which bore a striking resemblance
To the ones you have just seen began occurring

Subsequent to the events you have just witnessed
Unsuspecting jerks from Maine to California
Made the acquaintance of a new breed of fly trap
And got sweet-talked into feeding it blood

Thus the plants worked their terrible will
Finding jerks who would feed them their fill
And the plants proceeded to grow and grow and grow
And begin what they came here to do

Which was essentially to
Eat Cleveland and Des Moines
And Peoria and New York
And where you live

They may offer you fortune and fame
Love and money and instant acclaim
But whatever they offer you
Don't feed the plants

They may offer you lots of cheap thrills
Fancy condos in Beverly Hills
But whatever they offer you
Don't feed the plants

Look out, here comes Audrey Two
Look out, here I come for you

Hold your hat and hang on to your soul
Something's coming to eat the world whole
If we fight it we've still got a chance
But whatever they offer you

Though they're slopping the trough for you
Please, whatever they offer you
Don't feed the plants
We'll have tomorrow

To the point where I do a joint, that night it leaks

My drop top is a supreme, king of a young team's dream
Like a diamond it bling-bling, when it's hit with sun beams
Shoot more spiders in my ring, when I glide up the block
I got a trunk full of knock, about to bust air shocks
I'm shutting down the parking lot, when you see me ride
See me sitting high with pride, sliding on the buck hide
Looking pretty, on a tour all across my city
Sipping drank by the pint, about to bust my kidney

Gotti we gone slide down swang wide

We gone ride gray or peanut butter buck eyed
Then we gone tip toe, so slow
We gone wreck the slab for the dirty third coast
Hell we gone post up, on the lot

Fifth drop screens lit, trunk pop
Stash spot, cash box, on vogue socks
Old shoes chrome laces giving haters blues
Banging what Screw, tell me what it do
Shocking and rocking club and the thug and staying true

I'ma do my thug thang, bang bang, chitty, chitty chop
With the stash unlocked, trunks staying hot
HA, green sticky la, deep in the shop
Cardiac kicking times

It's a party baby bounce, bounce sugar hit the flo'
I'm on the cool up in the fo', in the newest Gucci clothes
'Bout to drop it to the door, baguettes touching my navel
Body rocking kinda slutty, served out like label

We got, a stable full of pop
That dish the satellite and throw cable at the spot
Up on the table if it's able to get wet like a mop
And after we wreck the spot we can just ride

If you like it on your knees, you could have it for a snack
I'm a fat mack, in a handy bag with a snub with 'em
Broads like the way the fat mack do his thug thizzel
When I hit 'em with my love then I got 'em

I'ma hit it from the top, I'ma put it in a bottle
I'ma hit it from the back, the big black Casanova
I'ma put it in your head and I'ma set it on your shoulders
Syrup in the soda, talking bout the Barre

Foreigner car, feeling like a fallen star
'Bout the menage 'tois ain't that what that Pokey said
Never been scared, South side will leave you dead
And call me Big Meaty, call me Big Meaty

Don't come into my room if you ain't gone get freaky
Working on his boys, run through em like a tractor
Out the South side, Moe-Yo make the god damn adapter
I ain't even quit, I'm doing mighty fast

Sitting on glass, Moe-Yo showing my naked ass
It's the Moe-Yo freestyle I'm so throed
South side playa putting it down, cho-cho
Playas get chosen, like M O E

Put it in your middle yes the big body
Riding big tractor, I'm a money stacker
Out the South side Moe-Yo I'm kinda actor

Live and learn, sippin’ syrup with my vision blurred
Take this cup of reality, niggas finna err

I wonder when the Braves gon’ win it
I wonder when the Falcons gon’ get here
Pyrex vision, made more than I ever made with DTP this year

Ho' hold up, double M back in this bitch
Walk in the club with a MAC on my hip
Diamonds look like niggas snappin' a flick
Ballin' I blow fifty racks in the VIP

I'm shittin' on rappers, these rappers is sick
Cause my homies got whips that these rappers ain't get
Cause we crackin' them bricks and I package the zip
And I'm switchin' my flow, I spit crack in this bitch
And I been hit your ho, now she back on my dick
But I get to the dough and get back at your bitch

And all I want is money, leave the fame to you
I graduated out of gladiator school
So all I know is go like I'm trained to do (Turn up!)

I let the top down in my Phantom drop
Blowin', I'm high as an astronaut
When you see me, I'm cashin' out
Walked into Mercedes bought half the lot
You keep carrying on, you getting carried out
Cause I don’t take ass whoopins, just pass ‘em out
Is this worth getting blasted about?
No forreal, is it worth getting blasted about?

Get so high, I be scrapin'
Got my eyes like a Asian
In my ride, like I'm racin'
In the sky, like a plane

Ain't no lames up in my circle
Ain't no ho shit in my eyes
Throwin' money in the air
Poppin' bands and let it fly
Where I'm from, you come up short
Pull that thing and let it fly

Me, I’m from the East side, say she from the South side
I don't like to drive much, told her visit my side
Had to switch off my location, my house is her destination
Say she ain't have no fuckin' ride, so I picked her up from the mall station
Damn she got that Fiji pussy, I'm a dope fiend I need the pussy
Every other day I feed the pussy, never ever ever ever will I eat the pussy
Your hoe is my hoe, 
You can’t go ?

True religion, bunch of jeans
Gucci store, bunch of G's

And I do what I gotta do when I gotta do
When she with me she won’t answer phones
I do make her cum too, make her some through, with no bra and no panties on

That pussy good, that pussy moist, twenty-two, she from Detroit
I beat it up, beat it up, in the mirror you can see yourself
First I get that head game, then her girlfriend eat it up.

Wrapped around the neck of a dope boy
Gold yacht, Master Presi' diamond in those
And just paid cash for a Rolls Royce
A true trap nigga, I done sold everything
Trouble Man, Hustle Gang, all gold everything
I said Trouble Man, Hustle Gang, all gold everything

Bought a gold bottle now we on the Dom
Big faced Rollie take up half my arm

I go tape worm in that ho, let my snake squirm in that ho

You leave your home for days and days

I tickle her pussy, got that pussy tickle pink
I'm the heart of the streets, and I just skipped a beat
And if that pussy sweet, I want that candy, trick or treat
I got diamonds in my teeth, so all my words are precious
I'm so fuckin' hot I sssssss I'ma need some more S's
Man I'm on some other shit, I want another bitch
That want another bitch, and I don't cuddle bitch
I hit her with that shovel dick, I got in that pussy and dug a ditch
Some people gotta punch the clock, man I rather punch a brick
'Cause I'm that nigga, and I'm so cold I just shivered

You can tell your girl here, because a cab came

You gotta stretch it out, girl move that there
She bend it over, touch her toes when she toot that there
Like hut one, hut two, girl who back there?
Who back there? I'm back there

Trap a nigga shine like I glow in the dark
Still got my .44 in the door
I'n not finna play with you, homie get laid with you
Cement your feet, then it's off in the lake with you
Underestimate you, that mistake I couldn't make with you
I hit you with the K, myself and show you what the paper do
And can't nobody handle you the way I do
Give your boy a K or two, kill you in a day or two
And no disrespect, boy, you violate me, we gon' handle that
Blow your ass off the map

To let a nigga know it's goin' down
Fuck you clowns, yeah I put the word on you niggas
Don't A$AP Ferg on you niggas
Been all through New York with Diddy
My verse'll Schmurda you niggas
And that's not a shot at T.I.P. or a shot at Gotti
Take shots of Ciroc in a black Bugatti
Got a shotty in a backpack, napsack
Shawty got a black MAC 11, I will catch that body
Like Nasir and Hov when I'm 40 years old
I will still be the pilot that light up the stove
And be cookin' that crack 'til the Doctor come back
And tell niggas that Detox come out this October
Like Ol' Dirty Bastard, I'm finally sober
And verses like this'll get me a new Rover
Get you a new home and a casket
Your funeral boring, I'm glad that it's over

Swerving down Peachtree, yeah bitch I'm straight
Every day my birthday, yeah bitch I get cake
You better get dough, ho you know I taught you better
Take all his cash, grab on his ass, write that trick a love letter
Came up off Ball and G, growed up off Bun and C
Got me a Chevy swapped feet twice the same week
Shawty say she want me, shawty know I run things
We used to wear the mask like Friday the 1-3
Then I found out I had that pimp in my bloodstream
Got me one ho and then I got me a whole team
Had a starting five with a bench on the side
So for every bitch I got, she got a bitch on the side

Choice but to watch the neon lights with my name lit

Lames sit your ass up in the stands and eat a hot dog
This is for the big bosses boy and you are not hog
Never been a eagle man, I never seen you soar
Through the sky, looking super fly cause you paid off a whore
You're not a pimp, put that on Pimp, you a fraud
Buying pussy on the side instead of tryna break a broad
We don't do that over here, matter fact we never did

Unless she in the comfort of a monster with a mouthpiece, then I reach her on stroll
Pimp shit get rich and quick, tell a bad bitch how I feel
Never laid back, gotta make a quota, if it ain't a high roller keep that pussy sealed

You act like you did everything you could, but she was supposed to leave
At her neck like rosaries if she ain't where she supposed to be, I put her on game
She devoted to the notion of roller coasters, and that won't change
With my trunk on bang, sun on shine, break a bitch down like a Garcia y Vega
Fill her up with the gumption to hit the ground running, and go and get me some gators
Yeah suits with the tailor, that fit the frame of a nigga all about his paper

Moving my whip down the boulevard
Word round town I was selling hard
Hard and I'm talking bout the yayo

And you probably get fifty if you came with an fresh one
From the big homie, from down the block
He keeps an gain of money because he slangs them rocks 
But I'm not knocking that meth and getting paid

You see, me and my homies like to play this game
We call it Amtrak but some call it the train
We all would line up in a single-file line
And take our turns at waxing girls' behinds
But every time it came to me, I was shit out of luck
Because I'd stick my dick in, and it would get stuck
The girls would say ""Stop!""  I'd say ""I'm not!
That's enough, I quit, 'cause y'all are bustin' me out!""
I say, girls, don't hide it, just divide it
And please don't knock it until you've tried it
So to all of you bitches and all you hoes

Got a long hard dick for all of the ladies

You can work the sitck in my Mercedes

           And do whatever comes to mind
           Let me stick my dick in your behind
           You can pour me a glass of Dom Perignon
           Then suck my dick until I cum
           Soft is your body, tender is your kiss
           c'mon, baby, we can do this!
[FKI]  No need to act stuck-up, pretty and seditty
           Got a funky disposition and you think you're witty
           You're not used to people saying things like this
           It's called criticism, and not a diss
           I only give compliments when they are due
           Now I'm gonna tell you all the truth
           You claim to be a virgin, I mean the purest
           I'll be gentle, baby, 'cause we can do this!

 Verse 2
[BM]   Love is the key to end all your woes
           You'll be my bitch, not a dirty hoe
           Together as one we will be
           I'll be fucking you and you'll be sucking me
           Then lick my ass up and down
           Lick it 'till your tongue turns doo-doo brown
           Don't try to be slick and give me a kiss
           c'mon, baby, we can do this!
[FKI]  Bitch, it's time to spend the night
           Let's walk the beach in the moonlight
           Holding each other like lovers do
           When the pussy's wet, I'll know what to do
           Makin' love, holdin' you near
           Screams and moans is all I hear
           Quick is your tongue, soft is your lips
           Suck it, bitch, 'cause you can do this!

Verse 3
[BM]   Let's get it goin' on, let's act a fool
           Listen and learn while I take you to school
           You say you don't fuck on the first date?
           Then fuck you, bitch!  I ain't gonna wait
           'Cause my dick is hard and my back is strong
           I'll find another bitch to get it on
           'Cause now is the time so stop the bullshit
           c'mon, baby, we can do this!
[FKI]  As you move your body, the shit you say
           Will make any man want to stay
           'Cause being with you is all I ask
           And fucking you will be my task
           My lonely nights will be filled with fun
           No more clubs and sex on the run
           Just suck this dick, while here I lay
           You can do this, so c'mon, babe!

(Mixx cuts ""Fuck me, bitch!"")

Verse 4
[BM]   Bitch, you say you's gonna give me some
           Now you want to start acting dumb
           You want to play cat and mouse
           When I catch you, I'ma stick my dick in your mouth
           Now stop the teasin' and start the pleasin'
           Just fuck me good until I skeet
           Bitch, stop fakin', you need to quit it
           c'mon, baby, 'cause we can do this!
[FKI]  Step to me and fall to your knees
           Suck this dick, put me at ease
           Do something special you know I like
           Smokin' head and please don't bite
           Slow and easy I pull the seat back
           Up and down, as I climax
           Steady in motion, I quietly say
           We can do this, so suck it, babe!

Drivin down the streets along the bay
My girls' hair's blowin' in the breeze
Her skin's gettin' tanned 'cause it's 90 degrees
I took her home and met the homeboys
Before gettin' bored we'll avoid the noid
Went to Opa Locka, jumped in Luke's jet
To the Bahamas and Mixx said, ""Bet""
We landed in Naussau, when walkin downtown
We met four females, all of were down
Went to the beach on Paradise Isle
We played water sports and had sex for a while
Before we knew it it was time to go
'cause the very next day we had a show
We'll let the people see that 2 Live is rulin'

Rollin' two deep as I drop the top
Beams from the sun light up the city
As I roll through sidin', sittin real pretty
It's a hot summer day and I feel good
So I turned up some music and hit the neighborhood
Spoke to the brothers, sweatin' the ladies
I bumped into my homeboy Ice in the Mercedes
Went up on the ave. where they hustle real hard
Skeezers on the side cold jockin' our cars
Someone called my name, so I yoked it quick
And kicked it to the girlies who was all on the tip
As nightfall came I was still out there
Havin' fun on the one, carefree without a care
You say it, we can play it, I'm here for the choosin'
Marquis is chillin' hard, coolin'

We never had it so good, so who can blame us?
Here's a toast to our success
Break out the Dom 'cause we owe it to ourselves
So let's find a hideaway in the Caribbean
Sail the ocean like a long-shore seaman
Goin' to the Islands to have some fun
Hit the beach and take in a little sun

Feelin' the breezes of the cool winds blowin'
On a mission, not knowin' where I'm goin'
It's a free day, and I got free time
And I'm loving every minute of this life of mine

My mama called your mama a bulldagging ass bitch
I know your sister, and the bitch ain't shit
She slayed me and all the boys
And even sucked our dicks
Jack and Jill went up the hill to have a little fun
Jack got mad, kicked Jill in the ass
Cause she couldn't make him cum
Mama Bear and Papa Bear went for a walk through the forest
Mama Bear asked Papa Bear could he eat her porridge
Papa Bear said 'shit bitch, you must think I'm sick
Just get down here, on your knees
And suck this badass dick'

Got a house full of kids don't know what to do
She sucked and fucked all the niggas around

With her legs gapped open wide
Up came a spider, looked up inside her
And said 'that pussy's wide'
Little Jack Horner sat in a corner
Fucking this cutie pie
Stuck in his thumb, made the bitch cum
Said 'hell of a nigga am I'
Humpty Dumpty fell off the wall
Cause a hoe on the ave. was sucking his balls
All the king's horses and all the king's men

There's a brand new dance an' it's comin' yo' way
It was started in Miami by the Ghetto Deejays
Say, some call it nasty but that's not true
Just the only dance that you can do

'Cause you need a sexy body, make your partner come alive
If you can't do that, don't even try
So get yourself together an' learn it quick
Just get on the floor an' throw that D

Let's dance, let's dance

When I went to Miami, couldn't believe my eyes
This female was throwin', wanted me to try
If you don't know how to do it, here's what you must do
Just listen up close, I'll explain to you

Just jump in the air
An' when you land, you wind like you just don't care
It's all in the hips, so go berserk
An' let that dick do the work

So while it's workin', you better start strokin'
To show your partner that you ain't jokin'
'Cause this ain't a dance from Mother Goose
Better freak yo' body an' turn it loose

'Cause when you're on the floor you don't give a shit

And go to the laundromat before it closes

A revolution of mass confusion, brothers killin each other
Robbin their mother, father, sister and brother
They don't want to get a job, or go to school
They think it's cool, but they're playin the fool
It's now 1984, five hundred years later
We're dominating both sides of the Aequator
In sports, music, and makin love
But yet we still have trouble rising above
It's said that in the later days
People shall be movin in different ways
There'll be many false prophets, devils in disguise
Performin illusions before your very eyes
Some have eyes to see, and ears to hear
But they cannot utilize them because of fear
You have sell-out brothers who will sell their heart
For fame and fortune or to get a head start
But in the long run they will see
That they are nothin else but victims of prophecy
Time is running short, the world is in damnation
Refuse to follow the laws of creation
You can not all be Jesus Christ
But you still can make some sacrifice
If not for anyone for yourself
Cause you have nothin to prove to anyone else
We don't longer have a sheperd now, we're lost sheep
Have to open your eyes, you can't afford to sleep
And a major factor is jealousy
Which stops us from obtainin the unity
Come on

And the man throws you out on your behind

And find your wife cryin on the telephone
The police called to say that your job is ill
She tried to o.d. on a bottle of pills
Now you're mad as hell, and can't take it no more
So you grab your gun and walk out the door
You find another brother and you take their check
And deep down inside you know you're riskin your neck
How do you know they don't have a knife?
But you have your gun, so then you take their life
Now your pocket is full, but can't you see
That your soul will burn in hell for eternity?
See, I remember back in Brooklyn, when I was a child
Actin wild, cause that was the stlye
But as I grew older, I learned the deal
Because my old lady told me, ""Son, be for real
You have a chance to be an architect or scientist
So why do you choose to be like this?""
You  have to get yourself together before it's too late
It's up to you to be a bum or someone great
We all have it in us, and that is why
They tell us lies to cover our eyes
So we are not able to see the light
And differentiate wrong from right
You see, the road to vanity is filled with flowers
You better be careful of its hypnotic powers
While the road to truth is long and full if distress
But if you make it through, you're truly the best

Verse 1:  Fresh Kid Ice
Hangin' on the corner, lookin' real sporty
Coolin' with the fellas while downin' a 40
Nothing to do, just killin' time
Sittin' on my ride with my hand on my 9
Gettin' a buzz, feelin' kinda nice
Homie dropped a 20, so we shot some dice
We played for a while, 'till my luck was out
So the bitches walked by and my dick popped out
Rankin' on the bitches hanging in the street
It's feedin' time, so hoe, come eat
Nibble on this dick, make me just say please
You know how it's done, like a rat does cheese
The hoe started buggin', jumped in my face
Since the boys were stressin', I had to punch her in the face
Grabbed the weave, stuffed it in her mouth
Don't fuck with the Kid while I'm hangin' out!

Me and my nigga, rollin' hard
Hangin' out, the whole nine yards
I'm smokin' a fat one, takin' a 40 to the head
Watch out, fool, get shot dead
And bitches clownin', cryin' and all that
But yet, still, I keep my gat
Rollin' real hard in a six-tre ('63)
Motherfuckin' punk, step out my way
And all you fools in the game, you silly-ass lames
You can't fuck with me; I'm wild and not tame

She got mad 'cause Samson tried her
All the ass was for a little head

To some she's shy and to others she's wild
But to her daddy she's an innocent child
Not knowing what's happening when he's away
But like a bitch in heat, she's ready to play
She fucked five niggas 'till they all got sore
Then laughed in they face, and asked for more
She does what she wants, and no one can save her

You're a dog-ass bitch doing dirty deeds

Verse 1: Brother Marquis
Chillin' on the block, on the avenue
Shootin' a lil' dice, sippin' on some brew
She had a big ass and a phat Mercedes (Woo!)
Turned around and seen this fine young lady
I said, Fine lady, now you're lookin' real nice
Sweeter than honey, sugar and spice (Right.)
Told her my name was Brother Marquis
You know my reputation, hoe, I'm just a freak
Heard about the way you throw that thang
She said, Marquis, I know your game
I said, yo, baby girl, I'ma tell you no lies (What?)
'Cause all I wanna do is uh, get ya high,
And uh, lay ya down and do the body rock
She said come on, and we got in the car
Took a little trip to a fancy bar (What?)
Got some gin, some juice, some coke
I tell ya, my nigga, this ain't no joke
Before a nigga fuck', yo, I got some head (What?)
Took me to the crib, laid me on the bed
I knew this was a rich lil' whore
She gave me $100, but I wanted some more

Chorus
(Uh! Bring it down now!)


(One time now! Overtown! Liberty City! Carol City! Highway 5! 15th!
61st! Yeah! Down south flavor, y'all! Mr. Mixx! Marquis! Bringin' it
Back y'all! Break it down now!)



Verse 2: Brother Marquis
All alone on a Saturday night
Smokin' on a blunt, feelin' all right (What?)
My homie Mr. Mixx called me on the phone
Told me 'bout a party on 1.5
Man, that nigga's married, he can't leave home (Whoo!)
Got in the party with my pockets fat
Bitches on my dick 'cause I'm cool like that (True.)
I got my pistol, jumped into my ride
Now up in the set, who did I see?
A fuck-nigga from Atlanta named after me! (What??)
I put that red dot up against his head
And said ""Fuck-ass nigga, I should kill you dead.""
The real Marquis ain't doin' no time
A thought ran across my crazy-ass mind
I looked in his face, he looked like shit

Siss-ass nigga ain't nothin' but a bitch!
(Bring it to me!)
Chorus

Yeah, bitch.  I know you used to clown and talk shit in high school
when we was fuckin' around ... 'cause I couldn't fuck.  But now I'm
back, BITCH!  To let yo' punk ass know that I can really dick 'em
down, 'cause I'm a ...

Chorus (4x):  Mr. Mixx and Brother Marquis
Savage in the sack, baby, I'll break ya back, baby
It's like that from the front to the back, baby

Verse 1:  Fresh Kid Ice
An original dicksmith, one of the three
Fresh Kid Ice, long dick Chinese
A savage in the morning, a savage in the sack
When it's time for sex I'll break ya fuckin' back
There's no time for slack, so give me 'nuff respect,
And I'll dick ya down like a Trinnie roughneck!
Throbbin' that pussy like a Tonka toy
'Cause you're fuckin' with a man, not a little boy
{Sho' you right.  All pussy ain't good pussy.
But nuttin' don't beat that savage pussy.  You know that
pussy that breathes, the snappin' pussy, that have
ya head fucked up.  You know I'm a big muthafucka;
I might lay heavy, but I damn sho' can't go deep, baby.}
Let me ride that ass from front to back
The one-armed bandit is a savage in the sack, baby

Chorus

Verse 2:  Brother Marquis
She's the baddest bitch to ever hit the matress
Very attractive, yet orally active
Beautiful but deadly; I can't let her get me
Despite all the things she does to try and tip me
Fattest (?) turd ever stinked a pair o' draws
Hot dick in a cock, smokin' head and them blue balls
The finest thing hoein', not like I ain't knowin'
Sex game strong, leave the savage alone
She'll turn a trick and suck a nigga-dick
And don't want a nigga to nut too quick
If you slip she'll catch ya, you're caught in the rapture
Don't fall in love when the pussy's thrown at ya
You're caught in the spell {Ha ha ha ha ... oh well!}
Savage in the sack, fuck like hell
{You have to have a strong mind to fuck with a savage,
'Cause it'll have ya head fucked up every time.}

Chorus

Outro:
{Yeah.  I know y'all know who I am in here.  I'm just down here hangin'
out with m' boys ... Brother Marquis, Fresh Kid Ice, and Mr. Mixx.
We're players from way back.  We used to mutt out hoes together

Came to drink wit a gold face same as you
Drop a fifty on the bar for a fifth of Hindu
Got freaks wit me, gotta get gin too

I know hoes think the same as me
Because they came to the club lookin' like freak nasty
Pullin' niggaz on the floor, dance nasty as you wanna
Rub a dub, dub, lap dance in the corner

Same old shit, same old hits, same old click, same old dick
Bitch, don't look in my eyes, 'cuz I ain't payin'
Ya shoulda known pimpy doo, niggaz, ain't playin'

Just pull down yo' drawls, so a nigga can see
'Cuz I doubt that the pussy is fuckin' wit me
Pop a coochie to the back, pop a coochie to the front
But damn, open yo' thighs, pick up my nigga blunt

What ya really want, what ya really need?
Pop the breaks on that shit and let's get keyed
Girl, I always pictured you in neon lights

Two triple shots of hen and we'll be on deck

Nickle and dime ass nigga to a top hat balla, big rigga like E-Fourtee
Niggaz know me, smoke a lot, only smoke weed, blow trees
Whole keys, see me in a E-3 dub, rollin' sweet up every time you see yuk

Peep us, only bad bitches beep us
Turn yo' main squeeze into a cheata, smokin' reefa
Took off my DK's and she fucked us up wit the whole sneaka
And her pussy, lift yo ass cheeks up so I could see

Mix the hashes up wit the back yard boogie, woogie
Bust nuts on yo' Donna Carra hoodie if it's all goodie
And be a ride a Benz wit my knees, what?
Breakin' trees up, rollin' weed up on my way to the V up
To put the G's up, see yuk, hella high, tinky eyed like Korea

Wit my dime piece mommie, queen bee's keeper
When the bitch shake her ass, nigga, you should see her

Wit a taped on bracelet, diamond laced watches
Mossimo jeans wit her condoms in the pocket
The bitch is real bad in a drop top Jag
Sittin' on chrome shelf on paper tag

Slidin' off G-string off in a coach bag
Dolla sign eyes and a stash full of hash
Back to the side where niggaz blaze
Home of the crew and the booty shake

Straight packed club where the hoes be poppin'
Dick all hard, tryin' to shake a li'l sumthin'

Verse 1: Brother Marquis 
Only the realest can feel us, cap-peelers and killers 
Hundred-dollar billers and real niggas 
Bitches with dime figures, telekenesis in my mind 
Make my diamonds shine, then I blind niggas 
Pussy punk perpatrators and playa haters - 
They can't fade us 'cause we two of the greatest 
Back out to let 'em have it, fake fucks and faggots 
Bow down in the presence of players and kiss the karats

Verse 2: Ice-T 
It's '98, playa, check your game 
Make sure them young boys respect your name 
Keep your heed at arms, reached, cocked and ready 
'Cause the streets'll catch you slippin' and rock you steady 
Watch your back with your homies that you feel is real 
Your homeboys from your crew, yeah, they're the ones who do 
Yeah, the suckas that got the playa hater venom, 
I want to take 'em outside and lay slugs up in 'em 
But that's trippin', and that ain't my sport 
I'd rather lamp up my cirb and flip to rob a port 
I sip my v-dozen on the street, bump my beats 
When I'm twistin' my dub, can't nobody compete 
(Imagine this) Hundred-g Lex on your wrist 
(Imagine this) About 10 karats on your fist 
(Imagine this) All dime hoes on your list 
Huh, that shit would be nice, but your name ain't Ice 
(Nigga trip) And screw the style and so on, rock you softly 
How you gonna step to me, kid, you grew up off me 
TV, movies and records and tours 
So many buses in Versace I don't wear it no more 
Called my nigga in Miami, ""Marquis, wussup?"" 
He said, ""Playa, chop some game on this bubblin' cut!"" 
I said, ""Shoot me the track, or you can come too, 
Or if y'all want to ball in Cali, I'll fly in your whole Crew."" 

Chorus 

Verse 3: Brother Marquis 
I'ma stay in the field, on a quest for the mil's 
And try to keep it real till I die or get killed 
So I can sit back and kick it, write my own ticket 
And live this lavish lifestyle of trickin' and big-dickin' 
Seein' that the West and the South's connected 
Formulatin', plottin' game to perfection 
Down with the Syndicate, bossin' new tennis shit 
Crimes cold defended, get caught, do the sin 
There's politickin' in the 600, drunk and blunted 
That's how we front it, but you don't want to run up on it 
Inside the club packin', actin', 
Got my bitch at home see-sackin', got my ones stackin'

The Treach DJ Mr. Mixx

[ VERSE 1: Brother Marquis ]
We get the red carpet treatment cause we're well respected
Always accepted and never rejected
Our defense is made when we take the stage
The crowd gets excited and goes in a rage
Cause we're generating and demonstrating
All of the talents that we're accumulating
And by doing this we'll go real far
Because - 2 Live is what we are
We're highly publicized and advertised
Our music's in your ear, our face in your eyes
We're good to go and goin to be good
We've done the right thing like you knew we would
Because we are here for your dancing pleasure
With our microphones, cause that's what we treasure
Now the man you see, who has hands of magic
His name is Mr. Mixx, so come on a scratch it

[ VERSE 2: Brother Marquis ]
You can call me Brother Marquis, Marquis your brother
The t-e-s-t I pass with with flying colors
I'm capable and on the case
Gettin straight to the point with no time to waste
The point is that this party needs to be rocked
Wioth drummin thumpin beats around the clock
>From odds to outspoken to opinionated
In need of a rhyme I will create it
The best is yet to come, with much much more
You got me rockin you with my rhymes galore
Now my rhymes won't stop, my rhymes won't quit
Just give me the mic and I rock it
On to the break of dawn
I will rock y'all to the early morn
Cause I'm the demonstrating, the dominating
Annihilator, brutalor, MC-hating
So all MC's must step on off
Cause I'm lettin you know who's the boss
Now Kid Ice, you know you're twice as nice
Why don't you get up on the mic and start to recite?

[ VERSE 3: Fresh Kid Ice ]
Cause they call me Kid Ice, the ladies' fire
When I enter a room, ladies fill we desire
Anytime I'm good, yes on the mic
I said the girls keep comin back every night
Cause I dress so fresh, my voice is clean
I can rock party people, yes even the Queen
In England, Germany, France and Japan
The ladies know that I'm the man
Who keep em from the kitchen just doin their dishes
Cause I have em in bed fulfillin their wishes
I got a degree in makin love
Yes I got it from my father just up above
I could take a girl from any man
With a twitch of my lips or wave of a hand
So to all you guys out there tonight
Grab your girl, hold her tight
Say treat her with respect and treat her right

I tell you, it warms the heart to see the little ones out there

Never forget what your people wen' through to get you here
An' it's for you to tell them about us. You know that, don't you?

Yeah! Kick it!
See'mon, my brothers/sisters out in every land!
It's up to you to shake the world, so you must understand
From where our people have come and to where they must go
So now I'll kick a little history that you should know
You see, the Jews have been oppressed for thousands of years
To every corner of the world you can trace our tears
We were enslaved by the Pharoahs 'till God sent Moses
Even after he delivered us, it was no bed of roses
For forty years we wandered on the barren desert sand
'Till Joshua the leader brought us to the promised land
So when ya kick this rhyme, you want to sing it out loud
You are the nation of our fathers. Young Jews, be proud!

Now our people lived here, and they held this place
And they were ruled by the great leaders of our faith
Now, from the house of Jesse came David the King
He kept the nation strong. He wrote the songs we sing
His son Solomon the Wise had it down cold
He asked God for wisdom when He offered him gold
And there were other dark times for the Jewish race
When the innocent were persecuted for our faith
But we owe a debt to all those who have died
To forever stand tall and face the world with pride

That a star would guide you my way
To share with me this special day
Where a ribbon in the sky for our love

If allowed may I touch your hand
And if pleased may I once again
So that you too will understand
There's a ribbon in the sky for our love

This is not a coincidence
And far more than a lucky chance
But what is that was always meant
Is our ribbon in the sky for our love, love

We can't lose with God on our side
We'll find strength in each tear we cry
From now on it will be you and I 
And our ribbon in the sky

I find myself locked up in thoughts of you
Over your kiss, I reminisce by sweet sunlight
And it's your titanic touch, that takes my mind at night
Cause when I'm with you love is so real it's like sweet pain
Just the thought of you takes away the rain
There's nothing I'd rather do than keep you on my mind
Days are short enough, so I don't waste my time
Locked up in you, your love is true, what am I to do?
want to make this real, 'bout how I feel, boy what's the deal?
Your love is so real, you got me, you got me

2 Skinnee J's,"Up, up, and away. Ball Point Man's come to save the day. 
I've got sass and savvy pack flash by the paragraph 
I'm more novel than War and Peace
I fight beasts armed to the teeth on the daily 
My pen is my sword and thank Lord never fails me. 
I remember back in the days of my youth 
When I used to run around on the block with a few friends 
Nickers and Kickers and stickers on our Big Wheels, 
Mindtricks and Kung Fu grips was the big deal. 
At nighttime we'd fight crime defending civilians 
Mounting extra sensory offences against the villains by the millions 
No defiance to our allegiance cause we instilled fear, 
Jimmy quit, Joey got married, but I'm still here

I've got my head in the clouds but I'm grounded. 
This superhero steps to the pavement and I pound it. 
Hounded by the sound of unfounded speculation 
By authorities around to confound the population. 
Now most host ghosts, I propose to break the shell.
The coffee shop cop rides in to dispel 
These visions of cathedrals from a shopping mall, 
And philosophy from a bathroom wall. 
And so I strike without hesitation, the forces had to yield
To my devastation my notebook is my battlefield 
I roam tomes of zones where spirals spin around
And I can leap a metaphor in a single bound 

I'm biding my time 
I'm biding my time waiting for a sign to be sent to me 
To unleash the power of my secret identity, 
But until that day I will stay for the time being 
Incognito laying low with my rhyme scheme
Well Shazaam! I Marvel like the captain
At my inopportune impotence in the face of distraction, 
Inaction makes me a good guy also-ran
So I battle Black Mantas in the bathtub like Aquaman
Minions of evil heed this tirade
It's a parade of polemics and I love a parade 
So I ride into the sunset with the money and the girl 
But in my spare time I still save the world",Ball Point Man,1998

I've got a thumb so I can pick up and use them utensils
My credential? I'm prehensile 
And I may be standing still but my energy has potential
Boom! We explode like the Hedgehog sonically
Dooma to the goomba when we jump Marionically
It's ethereal....I'm immaterial 
Some day may face will be seen on a box of cereal
I ride with the pride of the lion on the main
But you can only know me as I exist upon this plane
All the same, what's my name? You must be joking
Upon the pain of death can my true name be spoken
In the morning I storm in and swarm without warning
Shift shape and rise like the Phoenix from the flame
I reign colossal, fueled like fossil
Doing the impossible, raising dead as we spread the gospel
Of the skinnee to the many it's a J day
Your whack tactics lack it so just pack it like a K-way 
J's intended to be splendid when we send it
Rip shit up and then we mend it 
A word to the skeptics and the cynical 
We're the ones who showed Him how to make a miracle
Before you make a scene saying we blaspheme, cut the fuss
Take a good look at the good book, that was Us
From the top of the zenith we're the pinnacle
For the squeamish any skirmish is unwinnable
As we travel like Odysseus through the universe
Alerting we be certain that we're converting Earth first

Power might, glory omnipotence 
With my hands behind my back I still control all of the elements
We're heaven sent so we rule all creation
All that's evil runs before me wailing lamentations 
Blink and you missed it, The futuristic existence
From another plane I came and it'll never be the same
Naw it's better, Hail the nappy head
Incision with precision and I'm skinnee like stiletto 
I behead a killer-stare, serpent haired medusa
Refusing to give in cause I'm living like Methuselah 
Fighting off your evil as your mental's getting feeble
Gobble all your kibble and you wobble like a weeble
Just chill, skinnee j's raise the upheaval
Missed it on the first time round, catch the sequel
Return of the new and improved and I'm smooth

We're stuck in a tractor beam 
With the R-2 Unit 
And the whole skinnee team 
From the moons of Endor 
To the Land of Lando 
We take the whole damn posse 
To wherever the van goes
 
The chase is on 
And we're close to capture 
Imperial forces don't really know what they're after 
Which way did they go? 
Which way did they go? 
Excuse me for the question but I really got to know 

My rosy glasses 
Give me passage 
Inside the minds of masses
So relax when I ask this 
Did you come to kick my ass, 
Or get your ass kicked 
I'm a mellow fellow not afraid of being yellow 
But will I run from a gun when confronted, 
Hell no. 
I'm Obi Wan 
I use the force. 
These are not the J's you're looking for 

I hold my light saber versus Vader and envision 
The invader's demolition, 
Rebels on a mission
To defeat 'em red, leader gonna be there in a flash 
Exit to the X-Wing 
Flexing with the crash
Skinnee's in control. 
Now we go for gold. 
Like Han but never Solo 'cause my crew be in the hold 
Chilling like Hoth they can't touch us 
With their blasters, we learned 
At the feet of the masters

It's an old Jedi Mind Trick [Repeat x 3]

Hold up 
I froze up 
When the speeders showed up 
The shield's are down and the ship's about to blow up 
Imperial forces want to force us to extinction 
But my force is from the source, 
So of course I trust my instincts",Mind Trick,1998
2 Skinnee J's,"We've got mounds of sounds so buy them by the pounds or ounces 
Countless are the pistons in this underweight V-8 
With a force like a tornado we go
We're greater than the sum of our parts, 
It starts 
We arise from the peat moss 
The inconceivable rapper brings the Special to the metal 
And the artist, formerly known as Curious 
Gave birth to J Guevara, the weird scientist 
Dig the recital, it had to be that our anatomy was vital
The skinnee apparatus brings the ivy to the lattice
And the bigguns are enraptured by the people with the conch 
The melodic symbiotic like the Geefel to the Gonk

Animal or mineral or something in between The organic machine 

Hold up, let me just make this comment 
We be universal like Haley's Comet 
From our birth in the cradle of the earth 
Where we spread civilization cross the nation bringing life to the dead 
Through poetry from zero gravity to subterranean
The rhyme in my mind to the brain in your cranium 
This one's for my people's who come straight from the womb 
With a box full of rocks and a bag full of boom 
Stumpy, J Guevara, Mel and Special J 
Spice, Andy Action, Eddie Eyeball, A-Mays

We got kegs of pegs over magma heat

Blessed with supernatural intelligence 
We've got hammers, spanners, springs and coils

A flying ace like that beagle
Nevertheless this alien remains illegal
'Cause their discovery don't cover me

The immigrant's been left in the cold to grow old and disintegrate
Discriminate against the distant and disclaim this
'Cause small minds can't see past Uranus
But I shun their rays, 'cause stuns just a phase

And my odyssey runs in two thousand and one ways
And I can see clearly now like Hubble,
Shoved off the shuttle, here's my rebuttal 
It's a planet 

Who you represent? I represent the smallest planet
Attorney in this tourney versus those who've tried to ban it
If you don't agree go see Interplanet Janet
'Cause sun is star, like Pluto is planet

Lend me all your ears and let me state my case
About all the types of satellites you must embrace
'Cause like my parents, great grandparents
This planet was an immigrant 

To deport it makes no sense
It's an upstanding member of the solar system
Apply the laws of earth and make it a victim
Of Proposition 187

When Pluto spawns a moon it will apply to the heavens
I will damn thee like Judas of Iscariot

Try to rise and keep your head up, head up 
Leave the kinging to Kong, we'll be singing our song 
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on 
It's a sentimental journey 
Presenting sentiments of resentment that would burn me 
Unearthing archives of sharp knives turning blunt 
My road is to unfold, so I gotta face the front 
I used to spend my days dazed and confused 
16 year underdog still donning Under-roos 
Sorry Busta, I know my flow sounds used 
Written and directed by the likes of John Hughes 
Recycled recitals of rewritten idylls 
Are scrawled in the hall like Anthony Michael 
I lack land and title, just one of the boys 
On islands and islands of misfit toys

My field of dreams was a parking lot 
With hot shots doing donuts and pissin' off the grown-ups

The kid drafted last pick at the roll call 
To ease the monotony of everybody mockin me 
I spent time to tend rhymes like botany 
Now what I want to be? What you want to be? 
Maybe famous, I claim this, try to gain this 
But sometimes it's heinous the way the shameless 
Surround me like a tide and drown me

Here's my quid pro quo 
Omens and portents have come forth in torrents
It's time to realize my rise has been foretold
From the sticks to the streets I built a path that'll last
I came to NYC by the way of the pasture
Naive and pure I stepped from the steppes 
From the pie to the apple like Ming it's merciless 
But my mastery of majesty brings tragedy

Without bounding ahead and thinking far back
I take to the sky, you're grounded on the tarmac

If there's a mic to be rocked, I will throw the first stone
I cross time zones, root like rhizomes with my rhyme tomes
I'm not alone, my friend's found 5 strong
We reciting rhymes so you can sing along. So sing along!
We got the tasty treats to fill your mouth so open wide
We serve poetic justice. Stay open all night.
While I can't understand why shit gets held high
Those fads that won't die. They just won't so
I sleepwalk the street talk like somnambulist
We rock like amethyst, we rare like ambergris
It's scandalous music planned by avarice
You're sorely misinformed like see-span panelist
I never planned on this
Big beat evangelist
Whack track antagonist,
Pass raps through dialysis
But we stand by this
So here's a code to those who know to throw up your right fist, like this
But when it pours you know it's raining
These rats in races got me pistol-whipped like stamens
I ain't complaining, though, just hopping off this fence
Cause when it's all said and done things will finally come together and make some sense",Big Beat Evangelists,2000
2 Skinnee J's,"TGIF cause the stress ends soon
Got your friends on your couch & your disc rocking tunes
As you stand with your band in a room that is strewn
With Zeus juice, froot loops and old yoo hoos
Rounds of hi 5's and cries of ""Yeah, dude!""
Smoking cigarettes and sipping witches brew
It's kid tested, mom approved
To make your Jimmy swagger like the duke
Dressed in your best threads for club lagoon
They got teeny bikinis with real pontoons
Out the door & down the avenue
The shit's getting ill like repute

Enter the strobe light exit harvest moon
Greet throngs of paragons with your own platoon
They bet you to step to this one that's cute
She stands with her man hope he's chicken like Perdue
If belligerence were affluence you'd be tycoon
Try to overthrow the prince and start the coup
But he's grown nuts like cashew so he must be introduced
To your best friend your best man and new right shoe
Brutes execute like John Wilkes Boothe
Controlled by choke holds, low blows and broken tooth
Fists bring the pain rain like monsoon
Split the scene before you get the boot

You're the kinda guy who thinks that life is simply passing you
That last gasp is grasping you. Heard that last laugh get laughed at you.
Is it coming true what your friends said in the last seats in backa you
No they're wrong. Like the way George Bush spoke Sadaam at you
Assess the damages and cast off those tags that the bullied branded you
You're just disenchanted with Nasdaq like that cat back in Atlanta was
Yet you still have the will to deal with the deck that's been handed you
You be the outcast who outlast those old fears that panicked you
And now we have you on your way back from your first crack at Pamela
She'll become the better half of you. Just hope the rest of the night pass without somebody slamming you

Now your crews acting rude stupid talk being spewed
Going off half cocked with twice the attitude
Young fools acting sick wanta kick like kung fu
Watched too much Bruce Lee, Jet Li and John Woo
Limbo how low will you stoop
The sickness of fitfulness spreads like the flu
Run with the wolf pack attack the chicken coop
Flexin on the next kid who you run into
Laughing while you turn his ass black and blue
Pounce and bounce him into icu
Hop a train or a taxi head home like pigeons do
Smile as you greet the morning dew",Brew Ha Ha!,2000
2 Skinnee J's,"Girl With The World In Her Eyes

Here I go! Geronimo! Vertigo to free fall
The girl sets my heart racing, but my engine is stalled
Now I pace myself 'cause I gotta stay in front man
Blast like an astronaut, crash like a stunt man
To worlds where witty boys get the pretty girls they merit
But she holds the saddle, the stick, the carrot
So I rise like degrees in July or fall faster
Luck is a lady, but I wouldn't put it past her
As she fills me with thrills like a roller coaster Or slams me with amps
like a bath with a toaster
Now my knees are shaking and I find my spine is gone
From holding up the pedestal that I've put her on
I should've studied science cause I tend to forget
That for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction
I guess I must've slept through that one, cause now I'm on thin ice with
no traction

CHORUS:
Is she thinking of you? No she just thought she knew me
But she's looking at you! No she's looking through me
And now I realize I've got no shape or size to the girl with the world in
her eyes
So I keep bouncing

Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Or concede to Morrissey that pretty girls make graves
I've shed the serpents skin and lost my head like Ann Boleyn
While rough winds do shake the darling buds of May
I ask you for this glance through vast expanse of thin veneers
Steered by butterfly eyes while drinking drinks of siren's tears
I fear the reaper cause it's hard like heavy metal
When the beasts that you beat off are handsome devils
Yet, the consequence of compliments
Is that I am graced with graces periodic like the elements
Her imminence influences subatomics
So I want to do her right
Like Shakespeare does a sonnet
I'm on it. Harrassed by bees in bonnets
Slave to her affection like gramps to gin and tonics
Loyal to my master like a pack of Pekinese
While I try to hold my place with weakened knees

CHORUS:
Is she thinking of you? No she just thought she knew me
But she's looking at you! No she's looking through me
And now I realize I've got no shape or size to the girl with the world in
her eyes
So I keep bouncing

Maybe I should call you up so we can spend some time together
Take a walk or have some dinner, I don't care I'll do whatever
My heart shivers every single time I get a busy signal Can I get an
operator?

So you know if she said bounce with me, I'd bounce with her
Cause every minute that I'm in it counts with her
There's only one sin I wouldn't renounce for her
And if she gave me half a glance then I would counsel her
That she should bounce with me, so I can bounce with her
Cause every minute that I'm in it really counts with her
There's only one sin I wouldn't renounce for her
But do I have a chance!

CHORUS:
Is she thinking of you? No she just thought she knew me
But she's looking at you! No she's looking through me

To the show, thought you brought your potholes, but we filled 'em

And I know that our presence is bothering you

Darken the horizon like a mushroom cloud
Starship troopers battle on in this insect Babylon 5, we drop hard like a gavel
Rhyming got us climbing to the top this profession
Some take us for granted, but still we keep 'em guessing
Yes, it's the S, oh my, the K I, double N, double E

Even if you had six mouths it wouldn't help you on that mic you're on
While you were getting off I still had my rock on
Things went from bad to worse for you like Michael Jackson
I'll push you in 8 ways like an octopawn
Then I'll recreate you in one less than 8 days like this rock we're on
Then I'll blow your shit up once again like your name was Alderaan
'Cause you're an original like Psycho starring Vince Vaughn
So go ahead, rhyme along
Go ahead, rap along, tag along
Hop along, sing along
We'll be making points while your lips flap and babble on

Heart on your sleeve, gum on your shoes
Looking this year's model, feeling yesterday's news

Crowded in like clowns in a hatchback
Into your own, out in the night
You get a tan from the spotlight

Coming down, getting clearer now
Coming round, getting nearer now
Lost and found, right before your eyes

You never say a word you would take back
You came looking for truth and they faked that
Selling out, buying in
Trading capitol gains and original sin
So you come out swinging like it's time for some payback
Too late, out of date like an eight track
Fade to black, fade to grey
Tired of it anyway

Lost and found in the mirror now
Coming down, getting clearer now
Coming round, getting nearer now
Lost and found, right before your eyes

And you say
It might me hard, but it sure looks easy to me
It might seem funny, but it don't look funny to me
'Cause they keep on talking but they still ain't talking to me
And they think they're ready but they sure ain't ready for me

Find time to shine before the last act
You came looking for faith but you're past that

When irony is your strategy
So you jump up singing on cue like a laugh track
Switch lanes or remain in the fast track

See you when you get there

Where everybody's pushin', but nobody's lookin'
So I got crushed in the rush for the subway
By the little old man tryin to shove me
Well I noticed her when I glanced sideways
And felt continents shifting inside me
I was dressed in my best polyester
And I could tell that the plastic impressed her
Cuz she smiled as she eased up beside me

She said her dad ran away with Samantha

So her mom had to turn to her savior
And here's the advice that he gave her

Oodles of skittles and red liccorice
Marshmallow mints and a chocolate kiss
And it melts in your mouth like this

After night drives with trinklets and tirades
To a town bound with old guards and dry docks
Bored I drug my ass of the bus and hit the sidewalks
I stumbled by the lane name of My Way
And got caught in the street by treading lightly
The fish passed me by led by fish hooks
I hit pop flies and caught their strange looks
But one figure struggled just to stand there
He was a one-legged man in his wheel chair
I struck out a course for his lantern
I put out a hand and then he grabbed me
He told a lifetime of boxcars and bi-ways
Of the times of stock yards and chain gangs and two legs
He offered his advice for a penny
And for that small price here's what he gave me

My rosy glasses
Give me passage
Inside the minds of masses
So relax when I ask this
Did you come to kick my ass,
Or to get your ass kicked?
I'm a mellow fellow not afraid of being yellow
But will I run from a gun when confronted,
Hell no.
I'm obi wan
I'll use the force.
These are not the j's you are looking for
I hold my light saber with precision and invision
The invader's demolition,
Rebel on a mission,
To defete a bad leader,
gonna be there in a flash
Exit to the x-wing
Flexing with the crash
Skinniee's in control.
Now we go for the gold.
Like Han but never solo caus my crew be in the hold
Chillin like Han they can't touch us
with their blasters we learned
At the feet of the masters
It's an old jedi mind trick
It's an old jedi mind trick
It's an old jedi mind trick
It's an old jedi mind trick
Hold up
I froze up
When the speeders showed up
The sheild's are down and the shit's about to blow up
Imperial forces want to force us to extinction
But my force is from the source,
So of course I trust my instincts",Mindtrick,2005
2 Skinnee J's,"Second time around doing this....I think it'll be better....here we go
It was 5:45 on a friday
I was waitin' for a train goin' my way
I stood packed on a platform in Brooklyn
Where everybody's pushin', but nobody's lookin'
So I got crushed in the rush for the subway
By the little old man tryin to shove me
Well I noticed her when I glanced sideways
And felt continents shifting inside me
I was dressed in my best polyester
And I could tell that the plastic impressed her
'cause she smiled as she eased up beside me
And then she said she had things to confide, see
She said her dad ran away with Samantha
The middle-aged exotic dancer
So her mom had to turn to her savior
And here's the advice that he gave her
He said reese's pieces, sweedish fish
Oodles of skittles and red liccorice
Marshmallow mints and a chocolate kiss
And it melts in your mouth like this
(Chorus)
Take out your contacts and look at the screen 
Take off your make-up and look at the scene
If you break your restrictions, then you'll understand me
Take your persrciption of sugar and candy, oh yeah
We arrived there by way of the highway
After night drives with trinklets and tirades
To a town bound with old guards and dry docks
Bored I drug my ass of the bus and hit the sidewalks
I stumbled by the lane name of My Way
And got caught in the street by treading lightly
The fish passed me by led by fish hooks
I hit pop flies and caught their strange looks
But one figure struggled just to stand there
He was a one-legged man in his wheel chair
I struck out a course for his lantern
I put out a hand and then he grabbed me
He told a lifetime of boxcars and bi-ways
Of the times of stock yards and chain gangs and two legs
He offered his advice for a penny
And for that small price here's what he gave me
(Chorus)
Take out your contacts and look at the screen 
Take off your make-up and look at the scene
If you break your restrictions, then you'll understand me

How long can sell?
(You see life is like football, you know what I'm saying?)
Before I have to go to jail
(You gotta hike the ball and just make something happen man)

Can I possibly get real?
(I mean you know you might get tackled, you know what I'm saying?)
Before somebody go and snitch
(Then again, you might fuck around and make a touch down)

I'm so paranoid, stressed, stressed, paranoid, paranoid
One false move, I can be destroyed
I avoid the cops, I use a decoy
See my motherfuckin' driver, he's a white boy

I'm so paranoid, stressed, stressed, paranoid, paranoid
One false move, I can be destroyed
To avoid the cops, I use a decoy
You see my motherfuckin' driver, he's a white boy

All my life I did nothin' but dealin'
Learned to rely on my gut feelin'
Yo name is what? What? I know you from where? Where?
I don't mean to seem vicious but you look suspicious

Stop talking 'bout drugs on the telephone
Stop walking with a bunch of thugs to my home
Stop fuckin' up, call me before you come
Stop telling these bitches where you got it from

How long can I sell?
The Sheriff departments right down the block
Before I have to go to jail
Pass my beer so I can swallow this rock

Can I possibly get real?
Pass the tabs the turnakit and syringes
Before somebody go snitch
Before the DEA kick the door of the hinges

I'm so paranoid, stressed, stressed, paranoid, paranoid
One false move I can be destroyed
I avoid the cops I use a decoy
You see my motherfuckin' driver, he's a white boy

I'm so paranoid, stressed, stressed, paranoid, paranoid
One false move, I can be destroyed
I avoid the cops, I use a decoy
You see my motherfuckin' driver, he's a white boy

As I bail down the street with my khakis creased
Everybody looking at me look like the police
Havin' conversations with my gang assailants
Do you think, we under police surveillance?

Asking questions giving suggestions
Pulling Smith an' Wessons on strange pedestrians
Cookin' crack up, dollar bills stacked up
Hope the cops don't backup, here they come man

How long, stop runnin', stop runnin', can I sell?
The Sheriff department's right down the block
Before I have to go to jail
Pass my beer so I can swallow this rock

Can I possibly get real?
Hurry up, pass the tabs, turnakit and syringes
Before somebody go and snitch
Before the DEA kick the door off the hinges

Maybe I oughta stop sellin' water
Spend more time with my son and my daughter
But my drug life drug me away from my wife
She couldn't deal with the stress and the strife

The cocaine rockin' and the hood rats jockin'
The late night knockin' the drive way blockin'
Late at night I fantasize 'bout rappin'
But I gotta sell dope till it happen
For how long?

Hey, who is that, who is that man?
See you all fuckin' up, I got these looks
Yo man little rich kids comin' over here
That's what I'm saying now

You know they gonna snitch, they can't even lie to their parents
What the fuck you think they gonna do when the police pressure 'em?
Get to crying and shit, Afroman sold it to me mommy
He stays over there

How long can I sell?
The Sheriff departments right down the block
Before I have to go to jail
Pass my beer so I can swallow this rock

Can I possibly get real?
Pass the tabs the turnakit and syringes
Before somebody go snitch
Before the DEA kick the door of the hinges

I'm so paranoid, now God lay me down to sleep
Before the cops rape, please give me a beat
If they accidently kill me and I don't escape
Pray some white person, gotta video tape

Twinkle twinkle little little star
That looks like a police car
Shining on my dope spot
A police raid

I hope not
Little little homie hold my gun
I'm gonna fuckin' run
Where I run, I don't care

Throw that dope, anywhere
Cops chase me, through the hood
Straight in to the woods camera
Fly like lepord's

I hear, German Shepards
Freeze, hold it right there
Drug dealers, nightmare
Busted crack, criminal court
No black support

Handcuffs very tight, Baptist jury all white
They could never be my peers, sentence me twenty years
This rap so damn real, I'm glad I gotta record deal
If I don't sell a mill, this could, could happen still

I can't cope wit' the authorities wit' this red in my eyes
So I proceed across the battlefield bustin' for glory

First Verse:

I'll begin when I started gettin' violent, sir
Screwin' in my muthafuckin' silencer
I grabbed my 'stol, and then I felt the coldness
People stood around as I told this
Ferocious confession of relentless aggression
I was taught, to shoot first and then ask questions
I sold rocks, I was raised with no pops
My four glocks, twistin' hoes like door knobs
Bitch offered me the pussy, so I took it
They call me a crook, 'cause that's short for crooked
Stayin' high as Hell, and drunk as fuck
You ain't down with the Mex, you can sick my duck
I mean duck my sick, I mean suck my dick
Don't laugh bitch, you know what the fuck I meant
And if I ever come back to the free World
I'ma take my Baby Girl out to Sea World

Chorus:

Time is money
Time obviously isn't on your side

(Lawyer)

Can you tell the jury exactly what happened on the night of December second?

Second Verse:

My word is gold, now check, how the murder's told
Bring me back thirteen and my birth is sold
Learn the code, then meet me at the service road
Now you all understand what this person know
Servin' coke, seemed like my purpose so
I was the perfect mold of gangsta you've been searchin' for
But on a further note this cat tryin' to burn my dope
But since the day that Mama gave birth to Los
I heard them hoes, forever be first to smoke
Tryin' to jack a jacker, what's the purpose Loc?
Mercy no, 'cause he smiles and ain't heard the joke
Now he's in his blood, tryin' to write a cursive note
I snatch his (???) up, he looked like he turned to chrome
That boy got a date with Dirt, in the Earth below
With the worms, that hoe left on an early note
I seen him run the red light, and I heard she broke

Chorus

(Judge)

Do you have any last words before I give you your sentence?

Third Verse:

I spent a lot of time away from family and friends
The first song I wrote, was a song named ""Revenge""
Ever since then, my weapon was a pen
But I still kept a strap for those devilish men
Sucka better duck-a from the buck, buck, bucka!
Do a fly-by and shoot your aunt and your uncle
Does anybody understand the life of the trill?
Pigs and snitches get along 'cause they squeal

South Park Mexican, what the fuck?  I just knew you'd be back",Time Is Money,2000
2-Tone,"A long long time ago
I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die

Whatever the verdict in this trial may be
The effects will undoubtedly be felt worldwide

To bury me under the cell, fingered me as the toast man
Evidence stemmin from ninety-six
They say the world ain't recovered from his fix
While they was usin cut I was on some other shit
Gave it to you raw and they just discovered it
Nowaday, the jury got they brow raised
Listenin to testimony about my foul ways
Exhibit A: ""Reasonable Doubt""
They say this was the first thing that turned the peoples out

You can feel the tension building here
As an unprecedented number of people have turned out
For what may be the ""Trial of the Century""

They call me dope man, dope man
I try to tell em I'm where hope, floats man

How come, you label your brand of dope
""Volume 1"" and spread it through the slums?
Fed it to the young with total disregard
Your honor, the State seeks the maximum charge
And how could you, turn right around
And release a lethal dosage called ""Volume 2""
And is true you operate the criminal enterprise
Known as Roc-a-Fella in charge of his meteoric rise?
And do you deny you're responsible for the demise
Of record execs, and do you object?
Your distribution's Polygram, and through your connects
Def Jam, you pushed over five million SoundScan
And not to mention, your co-horts and henchmen
Dame, Biggs, Lyor, Kev' and Russell Simmons
And we ain't gon' talk about Murder, Inc.
That just establishes a darker deeper criminal link

The State is seeking the maximum penalty
And with the overwhelming amount of evidence
The D.A.'s presented, things aren't looking good

Right hand on the Bible, left hand in the air
Before I spoke one word, made sure my throat was clear
A-hem, I'm a prisoner of circumstance
Frail nigga, I couldn't much work with my hands
But my mind was strong, I grew where you hold your blacks up
Trap us, expect us not to pick gats up
Where you drop your cracks off by the Mack trucks
Destroy our dreams of lawyers and actors
Keep us spiralin, goin backwards
At age nine, saw my first hate crime
Blindfolded, expected to walk a straight line
Mind molded, taught to love you and hate mine
Climbed over it, at a early age, Jay shined
Fuck the system at Lady Justice I blaze nine
Your Honor, I no longer kill my people, I raise mine

Outside the crowd is frozen with anticipation

Well the verdict has just been announced: Not guilty!
It is complete pandemonium out here!

Crunk the bang when I feel

Bezatines smoking dip

Keep my ride up to date
Flipping 20's when I say

I'm overseas
I got the beats to keep you blowing on trees
Keep them hoes on they knees
I'm as cold as Mr. Freeze
Making music in this game
Like flipping coke into ki's
Everyday is the same when I'm rolling on chop
Got a cop on my left so I'm riding non-stop
Till I die
I'ma win 
See it's time to make ends
Thinking bout how I'ma make it so I'm sitting on rims
20 inches on chop
Hit the scene on the lean
Burban clean
6 screens
Biscuit tucked at the seams
Make my dreams so real
Plot to make a mil
Let these haters know the way a player really fells

Bout to hit the switch
So I can dip on the strip
Pull in sideways than I cock it on 3
Everybody stop and stare cause they all want to see how we

They delight in fighting duels
But I prefer a man who lives
And gives expensive jewels

A kiss may be grand
But it won't pay the rental
On your humble flat
Or help you at the automat

But get that ice or else no dice

He's your guy 
When stocks are high
But beware when they start to descend

It's then that those louses
Go back to their spouses
Diamonds are a girl's best friend

I've heard of affairs
That are strictly platonic
But diamonds are a girl's best friend

And I think affairs 
That you must keep liaisonic
Are better bets 
If little pets get big baguettes

And youth is gone
And you can't straighten up when you bend

But stiff back 
Or stiff knees
You stand straight at Tiffany's
