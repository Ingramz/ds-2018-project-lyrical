Black Thought,"[Black Thought]
Move, if you got the nerve
Lash out for your just desserts
It's not just the worth
Some of y'all heads up in the clouds
I'ma bring y'all back to earth
It's black back to birth
Bullshit y'all talkin' 'bout
Out ya mouth, I'm not concerned
Cause y'all got the nerve
It's y'all turn like Detroit red
When he said he had an ultra perm
The long walk to burn your bare heels
So they worn your boots
The game camouflage like army suits
But I can see it more clear cause I came with the coup in here
Ring the alarm and form the troops
Send 'em out into the world, go to war in a fluke
Eye to eye with the enemy you sworn to shoot
Now comin' at ya neck sick ya hand, something wrong with me
Motherfucker somethin's wrong with you
When you cheat just way to smart to question
The enemy the brothers of a dark complexion
The governments of the world is shark infested
They heavy on weaponry like Charelton Heston
Man yeah it gets low here uh, real low
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?

[Chorus]
I ain't rockin' with you, so what what you goin do? (it's my favorite mutiny)
I ain't rockin' with you, you're logic does not compute (it's my favorite mutiny)

[Boots]
Death to the pigs is my basic statement
I spit street stories 'til I taste the pavement
Tryin' to stay out the pen while we face enslavement
Had a foolproof hustle 'til they traced the payments
I was grippin' my palm around some shitty rum
Tryin' to find psalm number 151
To forget what I'm owed, as I clutch the commode
Alright, put down the bottle and come get the guns
I get off the chain like Kunta Kinte with a MAC-10
They want us gone like a dollar in a crack den
Said at least a track then, seeds & stems
Mind cloudy through the wheeze and phlegm
I'm get my brain off of that and the Jesus hymns
If we waiting for the time to fight, these is thems
Tellin' us to relax while they ease it in. We gettin greased again
The truth I write is so cold, It'd freeze my pen
I'm Boots Riley it's a pleasure to meet you
Never let they punk ass ever defeat you
They got us on the corner wearin pleather and see through
All y'all's gold mines they wanna deplete you
I ain't just fin to rap on the track, I fin to clap on the back
And it's been stackin' to that
Been a hundred years before iceberg ever lean back in the 'lac
Before they told Rosa black in the back
Before the CIA told Ricky Ross to put crack in the sack
And Gil-Scott tradin' rappin for smack
This beat alone should get platinum plaques
I'd rather see a million of us ecstatic to scrack
'Cause if we bappin' 'em back we automatically stack

[Chorus]

[Talib Kweli]
This the guy like Truman C[e1]
Riq, Boots and me
Activate in the community
Up in the bay like Huey P
It's like a free, it remind me of the be	 Kder's love for me
But beats got it twisted, I'll untangle it
Black mind is entwined like the ropes they used to hang us with
This is my favorite shit, I came in the game with any way to spit
Ya got a questionnaire, who you bangin' with?
Take it back to M hotel
Throw a step deeper like a poor righteous teacher with holy intellect
Killer flow form a real niggaz laughin'
And forni fairly at a jigabou at a penitent (???)
Once again you can feel hip-hop
Underground, still about McGruff
Gangsta like, fuck the cops
Talib Kweli revolutionary mc, and that ain't about stuff

Hop the charter flight down to Brazil
Ran right into will, ""What up, Black?""
(What's the deal?)

A cape with a cain, you what's in a name
I got a little bit of change but I'm feelin' the same
Came here for a taste of the finer things
Because the girls look like different months in a magazine

Judging how fast the word go
The probably already know we hang with Sergio
So, let's get a few classy girls, yo

These hoes know I'm drillin' 'em
So when feminine's thrown I'm throwin' them

The billin' 'em till I'm rollin' in millions
Gotta flip billions into trillions
Businessly, I'm brilliant
Turn pennies into twenties like the chameleons

But never put a chinchilla on a chick
Karma-style [unverified] too legit to quit
Hip-hop on and on and on and break mics constant
Till the break of dawn and

If you want to compete, come compete

Hey, 2na fish back to business
I hit the track like a sheer act of vengeance
Masked avengers get smacked and injured
Strapped'll get cho' back with some black suspenders

Autographs of the Jurassic crew
Flippin' flashes so fast like a fashion shoot
Classics, spittin' acid the fastest route
Bass'll hit yo face quicker than a passion fruit

Big cheese inflict sick disease
Make hits that'll make thick chicks strip tease
Clicks freeze when the trigger click squeeze
Makin' people in the disco duck like Riq Jeeves

But I ain't going to war wit' ch'all
And got no alcoholic beverages to pour for y'all

Black Thought,"Yeah, niggas don't know about Fatback
With the different color records they had back in the days
You know what I mean, the belt-driven turntables
With Technics joints (with the slipmats!)
Put nickels on the needles so the motherfucking record won't jump
The needle won't skip and shit
Getting juice from the fucking light poles
Shout out to the Bronx, nigga!

Aye yo, this shit go way back like a Uni marker, kid
Bombing the D train and hit the Bronx up
Krylon bandits attack; Planet Rock, Bambaataa
Peace to Pylon discovering rap
And the DJ that made the first scratch
Paved the way for Flex, Mister Cee, 'nuff of them cats
See, this rap shit came at a time that was accurate
Twenty-something years later, I mastered it
Seen light poles get used for power
I was a little nigga
Couldn't stay out late I was sour
So I sat by the window, heard the DJ cut
Impeach the Pres, Apache, and just begun
Otis Redding, ""Tramp"" the music stopped
Guess the system blew out one of his amps
It'd take a little while, then it come back on
Somebody stepped on the wire and shit, that's all
Now everybody's back in the groove, echo chamber
""Check one two, one two"" that's my favorite
Strobe lights is live, Pink Champale
Little pink joints being lit up on the side
Couple niggas had two fives
Other than that, cleared a circle in the park and shoot 5
Girls wore they Lees and jellies
Jordache and Lees, (TF Lords fit the fellys?)
(Sams ?) and Kangol buckets, B.V.D's
Go to Sergio's like, fuck it
Seen the stamp on that Crazy Eddie
Niggas coming back from the Funhouse dusted
Throwing bubbles on the wall

[Chorus]
We must remind you
Where this rap come from
Yes my brother, my sister
It's our duty, we must remind you
Hip hop was set out in the park
We used to do it out in the dark

Yo, it all started at the After Midnight Philly, but walk with me
Mad niggas coming down from New York City
Prolly hit the skating rink USA
Banging Schoolly, ""Gangster Boogie"" and ""P.S.K.""
I remember shells, Gazelles, top tens, and lottos
Mega design, reefer smoke, Coqui nine bottles
(Entire wore velours, call the boys with the Lucci wore?)
84's from Atlantic City Gucci store
Linoleum break dancing, Rust-Oleum cans
I put the writing on the wall signed, ""Truly yours""
Philly smashed '87 Music Seminar
Out on the battlefield like Pat Benatar
Hit the borough with Krown Rulers out of Camden
People Patty Duke-ing in the party, all cramped in
Around the time Flav started cold lamping
""Rebel Without a Pause"" was the street anthem
Old Memorex cassette, tape collections
Bright spotlights on all the fights at the Spectrum
When the Fresh Fest come, leather bombers and sheepskins
Brothers would bust they guns to get one
MC Breeze, Disco C, Jazzy Jeff
Cash Money and Miz and Lady B
Everybody banging ""Sucker MC's"" in '83
I was South Philly like St. Charles and Crazy D
Them wild North Side Puerto Ricans would snuff you
Twenty deep in a Ford Escort, pumping the Tuff Crew
I used to follow my cousin, he was a buck too
""Y'all don't like how I'm living, well, fuck you!""
I been a G since a little kid
Sticking my head up into somebody's dollar party, getting into shit
And late nights, shoulda been in bed
Instead, I was running 'round with them downtown lemonheads
A little man, hanging where them grown women is
Under thirteen, seeing real strong images
And that's the reason for my real rap penmanship
That's where I started it, and that's where I'mma finish it

[Chorus]",In Tha Park,2010
Black Thought,"Oh American citizen, come collect your freedom
No matter what your living in
No more giving in
Oh American citizen, come collect your freedom
No matter what you're living in
It's time to win

Keep us in the four walls of our childrens will be quiet
Most of us ain't even democratic or Republic
Can, and by coincidence we love 
The elected until the detected of being human
American falls, minorities lose war
But if we unite we would have won the war
On poverty
On drugs
On medicated
On love

Freedom isn't given it is taken
Freedom isn't free it's earned
Not, no, it's learned
Been hung and burned,
Yet rest in peace, resurrected plea
This ain't black or white, it's gray
This is not about my face
Most of us don't know what to say
Right from wrong, I'm free from slaves

Let freedom reign
Do you wanna be free or do you wanna be
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be
Free,
Let freedom Reign

Let freedom reign
Do you wanna be free or do you wanna be
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be
Free,
Let freedom Reign

America the beautiful
Suspect as usual
Liberty and death give me freedom on my funeral
I walk across the planet with the steps of a giant
My rhymes bridge the gap between religion and science
Cause my evidence is spiritual
I know my sheer presence is a miracle
I wasn't supposed to be here to share with you
But here I am, standing with my chest out
I take my place in history I never get left out
You stressed out and scared so it's causing you to act hard
Freedom ain't free, gotta put it on my black card
My passport claim I'm an American citizen
The constitution said I'm three fifths
I'm not a semi and guerrilla
Make my songs stronger than the horn of Gideon
Truth is the ? gave the native people syphilis
Consider this: Christopher Columbus ain't know where he was goin'
So lets stop calling our Native brothers Indians

[Chorus]

We were carried here in shackles from the homelands
? chop, chain locked, brain washed, programmed
Time's change, freedom reigns, I'm a grown man
Holding the future in the palms of my own hands
In this World, the coonery and tomfoolery
All I'm trying to do is stay true to my community
The daily news ain't the only thing that's schooling me
Watching these haters operating with impunity
Its journey dollar signs, black and white collar crimes
Running out of time, out of sight, out of mind
It gets realer and it's real in Palestine
Troubles of the World start to seem intertwined
War criminals, conflict minerals, pillagers are coming home
And five star generals telling lies in press conferences and interviews
I'm trying to take back the power cause it's been abused

[Chorus]

I'm just black in America
I'm not Afro American
Just a passive American
Making belief I'm better than
What we've been, what we've been
I said
I'm just black in America
I'm not Afro American
Just a passive American
Making belief I'm better than
What we've been, what we've been",Let Freedom Reign,2010
Black Thought,"Cold, cold eyes upon me they stare
People all around me and they're all in fear
They don't seem to want me but they won't admit
I must be some kind of creature up here having fits

From my party house, I'm afraid to come outside
Although I'm filled with love I'm afraid they'll hurt my pride
So I play the part I feel they want of me
And I pull the shades so I won't see them seein' me

Havin' hard times in this crazy town
Havin' hard times, there's no love to be found
Havin' hard times in this crazy town
Havin' hard times, there's no love to be found

From my party house I feel like meetin' others
Familiar faces, creed and race, a brother

But to my surprise I find a man corrupt
Although he be my brother, he wants to hold me up

Havin' hard times in this crazy town
Havin' hard times, there's no love to be found
Havin' hard times in this crazy town
Havin' hard times, there's no love to be found

Black Thought,"My grandmother suits was tailor made, 
Sundays Mahalia played
Simple familiar ways, 
Like how she kneeled and prayed
Willin', master forgive us, 
Our trust pastors had us real afraid
I never listened yet I still obeyed
I got to see how Philly played at such an early age
What my father was into sent him to his early grave
Then moms started chasin' that base, like Willie Mays
My childhood was all of forty nights and forty days
Trouble was my ball and chain, shorties would call me names
Humble beginnings 
But a star is what it all became
My journey from a dirty hallway, 
To the Hall of Fame
Music my therapeutic way to cope with all this pain
Was headed for the drain, 
Soakin' before the rainwater came
And chaos, into the order came
I started doin' what I'm 'sposed to do in life
Tryin' to move out of the dark, 
And closer to the light

Will you sell caps of madness, to the neighborhood

You can make things change
Oh if you just take a stand, yeah yeah

My wallet got flowers on it, kill it cowards
From the land, the stolen land, where gold chains control a man
Three hundred holding hands, stolen grams

Leave that nigga for dead, or should I save him

Black Thought,"I met him by Snake Pond, my hand on the flamer, my bomb
I park, Rae, Ghost, then lit up the bong
It's nightfall, nothing here, nothing to fear
Just got things to touch on, then he walked up weird
Walked in frail as stale, his eyes were soft
His face was pale, I looked at him kneel
Just wanna talk, you a deer, starting chasing him
He jumped in the tree, had grass in his ear
I'm a kill you nigga, you gonna have to come down

Next stop Starbucks and Spiegels, Jags had diesel

Niggas on the scheme for you gleam, they come from your school
A bunch of snake bites, they bitch smacked Shareen
She slid in the '09 Beemer, with that sex whore Sabrina
Fortune checks, live in Medina
Thanks for the info, my kinfolk, listen, Ms. Window
With the big pimple on her temple
Any more knowledge is college, you gave enough to be bounced now
She shot up in Chipotle, don't quote me

Can't dress for nothing, she fronting
Took a piss, roll up, let's twist, pulled down my pants
Good look, and shot through her tits

I have no shame, I have made love, I am no longer sacred
Burn the incense, prays to the sun, pay is intense,and so I lie I mourn

Where is god, in this world of deceit, would we find
Would we ever defeat, the dark is in the heart of mankind

I've been here for too long
I gotta find my way out now, Lord, tell me what's going on
I've been here for too long

He had a mother but he never felt she loved-ed him (loved-ed him)
People used to speculate was it because of them
That he grew up chewing more than just bubble gum
He used to like to bite his nails, even fight the gal
I used to tell him they gon' send yo ass right to jail
Pitching it hard, I never thought he'd listen to the God
When I would tell him not to be an addition to the yard
To my surprise, this nigga went to get a job
Now I be hearing him bragging 'bout his benefits and all
And I applaud whoever can climb out the hood
I hope and pray to Allah y'all can climb out for good
The hood is where the hate is at, I make it back
Just to bring some paper back, turn around, (rrrt!) make tracks

Yo, I'm too black and too strong and been here for too long
Never did it right 'cause all I knew was how to do wrong
My people telling me to cut it out like a coupon
And act like a new man instead of like a newborn
Sometimes what I grow on, is difficult to chew on
And everything your crew on, is different than what you on
I'm through with bullshitting with my trivial pursuit on
And sitting at a stop sign, time to get a move on, 'cause
Criminal minds with minimal time
On the meter, got to be on they continual grind
Trying to find hidden treasure like subliminal signs
And escape mental prison or a chemical bind
And I'm a stone, but a stone can't do it alone
'Cause the truth can set you down like two in the dome
And make it all fall apart like the ruins of Rome
Yo, I'm a changed man headed for home

I know this crackhead who says she gotta smoke nice rock
And if it's good, she'll bring your customers a measuring pot
Her family members used to beg her to stop, couldn't explain
How to cook cocaine had her head in a lock
You hear the beat with this repetitive knock, that's the same way
They used to tell her she was at the edge of the dot
One night she woke up butt-naked in a crack house
Not knowing what happened, the bitch must've blacked out
Nobody to ask about what had taken place
Now she on the Internet with dog nut up on her face
And she caught another case trying to break in her mother place
Everything going wrong, she know it's 'cause of the base
Said it was just a pipe dream to get her life clean
Even thought it might seem like the right thing
Basically I just told her that red means stop
Yellow means slow, then you can go when the light's green
(I dropped jewels on her) That was her last night on the glass pipe
(Right) After thirteen years, that's right
She said, recommend a rehab and I'm gone
I wanna get strong, she said, I've been here for too long

We smoke big blunts, cigars, it's us
It's obvious, kids, we regulate up shit moving through brush
The beats is grim, the ambiance plush
The speaker won't bang, the sneaker won't lust
Snitches wish dead, the eagle gon' bust
Catch you in the wrong spot, you dust
Statik ill, bring the havoc, this is magic
Fake niggas flee out, fly out the mouth, I get you gatted
Sports cars, re endorsed yards
Everybody four stars, ray like forty jewelry gaudy
Your creature game corny, I eat your dame, you hop up on me
Head off the rip, grab the whip, rest maturely
Hanging around the vets in the sweats
Since '97 we was rolex-ing the extra
Fuck around a hundred texts
Flash flex, cash, drugs, money and sex
Dumb check smashing

Watching the game from a bird's eye view
They say it's hard to keep trust so my third eye grew
Chakras open, binocular scoping, sour smoking
Hoping my best buzz ain't only in it only for the tokens
Cause they say if who you joking with, chokin' potent with
Tag team the joker chicks, the ones who do some bogus should
Act cool on the strip, but want to put two on your hip
Macking jewels in your whips, booming your hits, screwing your bitch
Froze under my toes, bitches where my penis is
Kicking it since the womb, now you see what the fetus is
And what the fetus is? Would these niggas feed us shit?
Rob a nigga for his number 2's to put my feet in, shit
Flow slippery, rise to the tippity top
I'mma make hot drops, make snakes history
Dreams of living civilly in Sicily
Laughing with a fan like

It's the elephant in the room
Created by a collision of the sun and the moon
My sonogram was an image of a gun in the womb
That was soon to be doper than heroin in a spoon
I'm astonishing, honestly my future looking promising
As my skin tone and a crystal clean onyx is
Darker thoughts let the beats break like a Amish's
I'm a stroke of genius like Mickalene Thomas is
Hip-hop and body rocking and doing it dude
I am the living definition of improving the groove
I use the same tools to shoot that Kubrick used
Take your hero to the river, give them two b-rick shoes
Who lose? If you really ain't nobody till somebody love you
I say you ain't nobody til they speaking highly of you
And what I'm sure you wouldn't want is any kind of trouble
Unless you got a crash dummy or a body double
You got a couple homies down to catch a homi- for you
Well I'mma fold niggas into origami for you
The most notorious, Poet Laureate
Whole story is glorious, stoic warriors
And I got my eyes wide open on you quasi-
Haters still smirking like the gators on an Izod
Lacoste, y'all tomato head niggas are
Imposters, long drawn out process
Triple OG's got a worn out conscience
Reminiscing to when we was all out monsters, on
Our Sierra Leone reigning tyranny
I strike fear in their hearts, rappers stear clear of me

You talking shit? we don't need the chatter
Opinions are like assholes, not everybody fecal matter
So they straining to push it out, put they foot in their mouth
That's when I'm letting the Brooklyn out when they pull it out
Better let it off cause you set it off

Y'all just catching up, so slow to come around
Ice-T gave ya cliff notes, I ain't gotta dumb it down
Cause I read the book, made the movie and I edit this
All while I be living it, and set the precedence
And get the presidents, fuck all the chit chat
Might hear the click clack, and I'mma diss back
Married to the game get the rice out Riff Raff
Nice being self employed, ain't gotta kiss ass
I ain't gotta slim fast, smack a ho with a love handle

Black Thought,"It's not latin, or white, or black music
It's that cooked up coke, crack music
Black Thought and Pharoahe, the rap duet
It's that lucid rapid eye movement

My think tank's like a piranha tank think, multiple bites figure
Mega, reality, tera, giga
Grand Theft Auto, modern day Mickey and Mallory Small
But I'm sick enough to walk into an art gallery and piss on a Picasso
Crack statues, rub my balls on her face, shit on it, and throw it at you
So when the beat intensifies
I become emotionally desensitized
Like, once I slapped a rapper with mace
Then I spit acid in his face, after he rinsed his eyes, no wait
I actually grew five times my size grabbed
Ma$e by the thigh and slapped a rapper with him
Now that's practicing sacrilegious activism
Attack is for battle, and practical rap with wisdom
Actually, it's pragmatic capitalism for actors
that crack under pressure and collapse when I get 'em
Monch is medicinal man made medical marijuana
With a phase plasma rifle like I'm searchin' for Sarah Conner
And shorty's got brains, shorty not playin'
I'm 40 blocks I'm a killa with 40 watt range
With an arrangement of bullets that I've arranged
Encrypted in scriptures specific individual names
That shall remain anonymous
Me and the ammunition's in a relationship that's monogamous
It's like I'm married to the silencer
Until I file for divorce and release my ex-calibers
Do art with your arteries, place that for my adversaries
Put your snap back cap back, cap your capillaries like

It's not latin, or white, or black music
It's that cooked up coke, crack music
Black Thought and Pharoahe, the rap duet
It's that lucid rapid eye movement

Vocally twice as magnifying as ever hearing Chewbacca scream
Through a megaphone with the significance of Dr. King
Philanthropic
Cause I'm trying to see man united without referencing UK soccer teams
My philosophy prophecy, the opposite of Mephistopheles I incited isosceles
Sent to Earth to warn of environmental atrocities, and nobody can copy me
Stop, it's not possible but probable that it's only philosophical mockery, strange
Change copper to gold, switch properties, bang!
Stay on top of the globe, flip monopolies, aim
Take stock in the soul, spit properly

Take stock in the soul, spit properly
That extended clip on my hip sits awkwardly
I'm diabolical, follicle triggers that I cock and squeeze
Sending shots to ancient Greece to pop Socrates
I bear arms like button-downs without the sleeves
Manic depressive and possessive like apostrophes
My psychiatrist waive the doctor fees
When I wave the pistol and say listen quick, watchin' me so I can breathe
National Association for the Advancement
Of drugs for performance enhancement
And it's tough taking so many chances
But I've been a bad seed from the womb, they call me ovary cancer
And I got an ugly heart, although I'm totally handsome
And I take the love of your life and hold her for ransom
And my tactical cam that never stood for any national anthems
Was hood, I am the actual answer
And I'll prove it
Black attire, rapid fire, rapid eye movement
I'm from a species that is higher, I am not human
Extraterrestrial alien, a monster killer of conscience chillin'
In a barrel of lobster
Ex-Slave sadomasochist that gave the mass of my ass to kiss
A dyin' breed, I'm the last of this
Black is as miraculous as Jesus of Nazareth
When I vocalize the crowd rise like Lazarus
It's the Rhode Scholar, my cold collar piss off Peter
Your hoes holla, he's on top of the bars
Meet a Mr. Globe Trotter in my Adidas
Pure cheetah, hoppin' out of this exotic European 4 seater
Hollerin' cheeba cheeba like I'm Pharcyde
Killin' is the dark side
Villain, I'm God, I'm Godzilla
Sometimes I'm Bob Dylan put blood on these tracks, for real
So, God-willin' you'll feel what I'm spillin'
Yeah, I never quit, I'm still syndicatin' up
Me and Pharoahe Monch, still here for the benefit of us
This is straight razor behavior, I never get enough
Get the picture, my militia gettin' ignorant as fuck

Yea, it's suicide murder
Straight from the underground through the fiber optics

Happiness comes from money

Money makes us happy and, happiness is everything
And everything is now and, now is more than never and
There'll never be a moment where happiness doesn't matter so
If you can quote the prices of your happy then get at us yo
Get at us yo, learned it from right where you saw me posted at
Grew up holding on to it all unless there's hope attached
Cause me?, I don't hope for much, uh, if anything at all
They said your cue will depend on what you can bring along
So we was bringing everything that mattered to us most
It was money and it was cars and it was habits to keeping both
It was hundreds and it was scars and they just happened to be close
It was hunger getting involved so then it was back to being broke
And we just wanted a shot or 2, Melo on the follow through
Promised me it would open these doors the way that they promised you
So I just do, whatever it takes to fuck with it all
And enough to buy my way next to Jesus if I get lost, swag

And they say money makes the world go, money makes your girl go
Money turns some of its earners into something terrible
Ask yourself where did the person who was in the mirror go?
Why am I unrecognizable, so unbearable?
In the pursuit of paper, it was then I wasn't there with you
To do it over I'd have taken better care of you
It costs money for the birth, more for the burial
Purposely I'm saving up to purchase us a miracle
We want more but need less, desires and requests
I guess moving constantly at this rapid speed just
Effected my velocity, then the evil got to me
And strangely, it fucked around and changed my philosophy
I always heard it's not the quantity but it's the quality
In all honesty, past mistakes seem to follow me
Sometimes I feel like if my psychology will swallow me
So my apologies, what's my problem yo, it's gotta be the money

And we already had too much and so we was brushing it off us
In pictures in front of back drops til like 4 in the morning
In all of this Dapper Dan for all of your dapper adornment
Or its falling on the badge in the murder of pick a name
And my name fill the blank and I'm blanked and I drift away
And you kiss my cold cheeks, chicks crying like I was Cochise, would you stand up
And send me a slow speech?, because money makes us happy and, happiness is
Everything, and everything is now and, now is more than never and, there'll never
Be a moment where happiness doesn't matter so, if you can quote the prices of

When I was eighteen living beyond my means
I was afraid of my dreams, looking at the finer things
Wishing I could l flip to a microchip from a paper clip
Upgrade to a spaceship from a basic whip

I swam with crocs, fish with sharks
I never popped charge, but I know I'm popular

It's not a victimless crime if anybody suffers
In a system that was designed for them to try to cuff us
Well, what's the use for them trying when can't nobody touch us?
Unless it's fabricated, probably drug related
But love or hate it, I will not be subjugated

Angrily, I turn to find
Innocent people panic to search
For refuse in whatever works

This will all fade away

At a New York City hard core show, finds a way for her to go
She says he loves it here, she's got some new friends here
Her popularity grows and grows, she knows the guys at all the shows
She pound her roots in Doctor Marten boots
She knows this is the way
She pound compassion in her veins from a picture in a Peta magazine
And says the world is so cruel now she boycotts zoos
She's a strict vegetarian she's looking good and getting thin
And she feels brand new with her little ankle tattoo

Charge his battery got to last all night
Coffee and a cigarette starts his day off right
In Central Park a dog runs across the lawn

Work every day just trying to stay ahead
Slaving like an animal he wishes he was dead
Uptown downtown through the underground
New York subways make a certain sound
Everybody's got somewhere to go
He thinks to himself as he looks to check the time
The latent images in other peoples minds
Autumn mornings have thoughts all their own
This cannot be what life is for
He's fighting a war
Just to remain alive
On the way home he stops
At the local video store
Because he rented Annie Hall
On the night before
He's got a burrito in his bag
He's staying in tonight
Because what's the use in going out
On a Tuesday night?
This cannot be what life is for
He's fighting a war
Just to remain alive
Happiness should not be a dream
Or only a scheme
Whose foundation is based on lies

Until the day he dies

And do it now boy

It's for real
Honesty staying true till the end
That's the deal

Witty, witty, witty as you can be

Happens to the foolish all the time

Feelings camouflaged by groans and grins
Secrets have a special way about them
Moving to and fro among your friends

Somebody?s watching you
Somebody?s watching you

Live it up today if you want to
Live it down tomorrow afternoon
Sunday school don't make you cool forever
Neither does the silver of your spoon

This is what you pay for what you need
The higher the price, the nicer the nice
Jealous people like to see you bleed

No dust will ever grow on this frame,
One million years, and I will say your name.
I love you more than I can ever scream.

I said, ""I love you, "" as I left you.
Regrets still haunt my hollow head,
But I promised you I will see you again, again.

I sit here and smile dear.
I smile because I think of you and I blush.
These bleeding hollow dials... this fuss.
A fuss is made of miles and travels
When roadways are but stones and gravel.
A bleeding heart can conquer every crush.

I had to say goodbye
Lived and learned from every fable
Written by your mind
And I wonder how to move on
From all I had inside
Place my cards upon the table
In blood I draw the line
I've given all my pride

Living a life of misery
Always there, just underneath
Haunting me, quietly alone
It’s killing me, killing me
Dead and gone, what's done is done
You were all I had become
I'm letting go of what I once believed
So goodbye agony

I watch the stars and setting suns
As the years are passing by
I never knew that hope was fatal
Until I looked it in the eye
And now I'm not sure I am able
To reach the other side
Casting out the light

Living a life of misery
Always there, just underneath
Haunting me, quietly alone
It’s killing me, killing me
Dead and gone, what's done is done
You were all I had become
I'm letting go of what I once believed
So goodbye agony

Not alone in forgiving
The faithful and the blind
Innocence is forsaken
I leave 'em all behind
And then I see that even angels never die

Eleven years old real life no goals,
Sneaking little sips in the cut,
Before they even called me Kurupt, 
Ridin' down the block so Ima tell you how I grew up,
I was always in the mix, too young for sticks
Ty tell em about that Watts experience

In Watts, a nigga couldn't wait for the summer time
Back yard barbecue yea that'll free your mind, 
We stayed fallin' of them ice cream trucks,
All my niggas nickel baging it and hustling bucks,
You could catch me in the middle of the streets 
Slap boxing with my nigga Porky,
And as I take you down my memory lane

I'm on the road gettin' my money up
And I remember all the young soldiers in the hood
Tryin' to gang bang slingin' nickel bags
Screamin' money ain't a thing, for real
I know exactly how y'all feel
I'm reppin' black and brown pride
West Side til I die

I got a lot of rider in me
I was thinkin', couple years older
Fourteen smokin' and drinkin'
Thinkin' bout uncle Jame's army
The old folks love it
I'm just gettin' up in the game
And gang bang bubbly
Crinshaws crackin, durin' the day got schwinns
On Sunday's watchin' all the big homies spin
I won't dance
'Cause thats all I see
That's like the army
That's all you can be

I used to love feedin' polices and cheap coast
Watch me jump up in the push
And play hide and go get it I'm wit it
And all the hoodrats used to hold us down on the block

Truth is I ran way when I was 5 years old
Ran til my And 1's had holes in the soles
I had 3 silk shirts, 2 pairs of jebose
Spent the night at boo's house, we was sharin' his clothes
Moms left me out in the cold
Worst that that my man took 5 shots and ain't lose his soul
I was livin with a blind man's vision
And no matter how hard I tried, I could never see prison
And to all my dead homies, we don't pour rout liquor
We just poke our chests out, and say we miss ya niggas
We was scared of gang bangers, walked to school in groups
Argued who was the best MC, Ice Cube or Snoop
Damn, I miss my ghetto dayz
Whether it was Coca Cola or straight coke
We found a way
Hey and the memories of EZ and Pac

Been a while but no
I'll believe if I'm told so

The question is what do I know about love
They ask me all the time do I know about love
Naturally I say yes but I don't know shit
'cause if I did I wouldn't be in and out of relationships
Why? Do I get caught up in eye candy
A few days I pound she ain't nowhere to be found
Everyday I pull so many dimes
I need to change my middle name to one line
'cause I got so many one liners
I try to tell her I was ready to go all the way
But she couldn't be patient with me
And now look at the end result
She ain't here to get these roses I brought
But I'ma keep my self-esteem up
And keep looking for some real love
You know its true what they say
Love's as precious as a rose
Will I ever find a rose I don't know

You want me to put you over my whole career
My career was here first and its here to stay
Don't trip girl you're still a prior life and
Movie sets, rhyming, singing, and world tours
If I ain't got a rose in my life then what's it all for
You think I wanna be in private jets
Laid up in five star hotels by myself
Nope I want a rose to share with
The blessing of a backbone but I can't stay alone
I come home to a home cooked meal
A manicure pedicure without seeing a bill
Am I describing you I don't know
I don't wanna spend the rest of my life living single
Patience is a virtue that's the way that it goes
The question is will I find my rose is that you

So when I leave please believe I'ma leave man
I'm not a charity case
But you might have to donate some love tips and show me the way
'cause if I really knew it all
You think y'all would have to talk to me about how to love and all
Naw I'd be on top of the world
At twenty seven with a wife, pregnant, and white picket fences and shit
It's cool I'ma get there soon
Running around in the yard having fun with my little ones
Thinking to myself I had my share
There's gonna be women everywhere
Not like the one I got here
Independent, fine as hell and got her own career
And if I ever needed her
She'll be right there

Always catch me creeping

But your boy Black Ty's got a mean no arm
I got exposed when she went through my DMs
Now I got problems with my BM
I ain't wanna be him
Dumb shit, doin' the most when I know better
But doin' better, and knowin' better and showin' better
Dumb shit in these streets and doin' what I want
When I should be doin' what made you put me on
Your ? smart, you got your own everything
Million niggas want you but I'm the one you're drawn to
Been through it all but you still hold me down
Got pain in your smile and you refuse to frown
Baby I'm sorry I embarrassed you
Walking in a room full of bitches I didn't touch and they ain't even banished
Your voicemail full but the text said read
I pray to God our love ain't dead baby I swear

I swear I tried, I tried, no lie
Seems like I fail, I fail, every time
Can't get caught again 'cause I swore that I was gon' change
Got me working overtime in my phone changing all these names
But the city so small, they probably end up talking
And if she finds out, she'll probably end up walking
But I'mma take my chances to gamble either way
And why would I wanna start over when I got you at home?
Tryna get a million girls I'mma just end up alone

Drawing board, I floored niggaz with the skills
I'm sick and bored, of all the triggers and the steel
That you're cappin; why don't you give all that weak shit a rest
And start rappin - I'm puffin the buddha bless yes I'm packin
BOWLS, and spittin the rhymes on ?testabra?
Be like D'Wayne from _What's Happening_ talking about ""Uh-uhh!""
Ya, can't defeat me, delete me, beat me, greet me

If you a rapper grab your mic broke cancel the glock yo'
Ass is grass and I'm the lawnmower hey bonhead nigga
Put your rhyme in the towaway zone
Red's all I see like if my name was El Toro
On the land, smokin a reefer, underwater smokin a coral reef
I squash beef like a meat grinder
I'm the kind of chief rocker to seek and destroy boys
Oy, I'm all of that and a plate of chitlins
So won't you sit and listen to the way I flip the script
Like, a beat to make a flip to beat to breakin shit
Delete you makin hits complete awaken kids I eat ya

Artificial amateurs aren't at all amazing
Analytically, I assault, animate things
Broken barriers bounded by the bomb beat
Buildings are broken, basically I'm bombarding
Casually create catastrophes, casualties
Canceling cats got their canopies collapsing
Detonate a dime of dank daily doin' dough
Demonstrations, Don Dada on the down low

Eatin' other editors with each and every energetic
Epileptic episode, elevated etiquette
Furious fat fabulous fantastic
Flurries of funk felt feeding the fanatics
Gift got great global goods gone glorious
Gettin' Godly in his game with the goriest
Hit 'em high, hella height, historical
Hey holocaust hints hear 'em holler at your homeboy

Imitators idolize, I intimidate
In a instant, I'll rise in a irate state
Juiced on my jams like jheri curls jockin' joints
Justly, it's just me, writin' my journals
Kindly I'm kindling all kinds of ink on
Karate kick type brits in my kingdom
Let me live a long life, lyrically lessons is
Learned lame louses just lose to my livery

My mind makes marvelous moves, masses
Marvel and move, many mock what I've mastered
Niggas nap knowin' I'm nice naturally
Knack, never lack, make noise nationally
Operation, opposition, off, not optional
Out of sight, out of mind, wide beaming opticals
Perfected poem, powerful punchlines
Pummeling petty powder puffs in my prime

Quite quaint quotes keep quiet it's Quannum
Quarrelers ain't got a quarter of what we got uh
Really raw raps, risin' up rapidly
Riding the rushing radioactivity
Super scientifical sound search sought
Silencing super fire saps that are soft
Tales ten times talented, too tough
Take that, challengers, get a tune up

Universal, unique untouched
Unadulterated, the raw uncut
Verb vice Lord victorious valid
Violate vibes that are vain make 'em vanished

Blackalicious,"When I'm on the mic, I stand tall with gall
Style worth more than anything you goin' find in mall
The treasure of the mutiny is what keeps you all enthralled
I lively up the people with the yes, yes, y'all

Create, wait, watch and let the fake fall
Employ my strategy like checkmate
Call your bluff in that destruction, of all previous discussion
When I hit like a concussion, your heart rate stall

Recorders all stall, you jaw'll go slack
I deliver makin' quivers and shivers all down your back
Like a river flow the beat
Bounces in Cadillacs, bumpin' that vicious Blackalicious

Kick drum, that keeps punchin' through that speaker
Countinously, meticoulously, etchin out the spaces in time
For miles affecting rhymes that changing minds permanently
Like mescaline, giving your whole perception, perspective
A new design that wreck that misconception

Now, we seeing, eye to eye yet?
Can the MC speak? The suckas stay quiet
The crowd can get rowdy like the party was a riot
Try it and the ladies will, who ride your ass up out the spotlite

""You crazy, don't you know that fool Lateef'll set it on you?
He better than you"", she telling you the truth due
I give you the proof due
Step you, end up getting cut up by the cornerstone's edge

Down back, by the end I say, ?Don't get contrary?
'Cause baby, I'm very highly motivated
I'm trying to do that play and ownership thing like Isiah did
Hope your vision ain't impaired

But my prayers, you can hear what I'm saying to you
Now, if you fakin' it, may sound strange to you
Like some way under my breath, maybe I'm playing
But I only do that murder rap shit, for those whose the cap fit
As for the rest, I'm trying to you all, back to the essence

Back to the essence, when we in the house feel the almighty presence
Making MC's act humble like peasants
Smoking the mic and leaving nothing but resin
Making the spots, pop like pots full of wesson

Making it hot cooking, your goose and your pheasant
Taking your props leaving your ass, butt naked
Soul exposed, no material protection
Low and behold, we going back to the essence

I be that G I to the F, when I get def up on that mic
I swing that lefty, no discrepancy and effortlessly
And in the right frame of mind
Electricity combined with mind, soul and the way I flex the agility

Focus, ability makes some heads quite restless in this vicinty
Trying to fill me out but they just jesters in my vicinty stuck in my art
Trying to feather my energy, I bless plenty of enemies
Hittin' me with expressions that would, so would like to get rid of me

In my quest to be the epitome, it'll be cold in hell
'Fore I feel stress from any of these illiterate
Insecure about, they little insignificant contributions
Infinitely I'm mocking yes and don't, whenever the gift put out a fly quote

Yes, I'm doing my thing and leaving a cloud of cess smoke
Wherever I go, whether I'm balling, whether I'm flat, dead, broke
I'm heeding my call and leaving a ball of rappers with heads roast
And bringing that universal dopeness to the East and West Coast

And really no one the best, though is God
Allowing you to harness the energy, within whoever feels the most
At the moment, takes it the farthest
So thank Him 'cause it's through you that he manifest artistry

Like a painting with an infinite, beyond lifetime warranty
And Satan is a wack diseased, that needs to be quarantined
And caged in, I'm riding a boat of dopeness, come on aboard with me
And engage in a tale of musical invention

An MC lynchin', convention GA
Lyrical fifth dimension miracles, all up in your system

Back to the essence, when we in the house feel the almighty presence
Making MC's act humble like peasants
Smoking the mic and leaving nothing but resin
Making the spots, pop like pots full of wesson

Making it hot cooking, your goose and your pheasant
Taking your props leaving your ass, butt naked
Soul exposed, no material protection
Low and behold, we going back to the essence

Blackalicious,"""Now, I thought I would talk about today
For your consideration, as the world turns
As the world turns, you read in all these scriptures
About the world, find out that the world does turn!""

As the world keeps spinning, we live these days
Dollar bill done drove the whole world crazy
While sitting on the porch letting ganja blaze
Never hesitate a moment to enhance my phrase
Since I needed that escape I take my pull
Seen the thugs on the corner trying to act all cool
Pretty much out of character
I look right through, their transparent exterior
You in my book getting written and I'm the derriere
Thought you was peeping me but I was aware of ya
You peep my ill expressions, how I just glare about
Trying to trace my inner world and my whereabouts
Well try on, try on
I'm watching everything that's going down
And it ain't nothing that I ain't been around
The same ghetto but a different town
Weeell, I remember growing up in the P-a-see
It was a whole lot of love in my family
I had clothes on my back and shoes on my feet
Times we didn't have a lot but that was fine with me
In good times and even bad times
Whether rainy, grey sky or the sunshine
Life was so much simpler, I didn't realise it then
But time has definitely made me a wiser man

[Chorus 2x: Erinn Anova]
The world keeps turning round
And time just keeps on moving

Sunday morning in the church just singing a song
Mama gave much praise cause her soul was strong
When I was young I used to do lots of thangs was wrong
I never thought about till one day she was gone
Now my daddy passed on about a year before
Reminiscing as I glance at the fishing pole
But these things gotta happen so we all can grow
And now they spirits much freer than they was befo'
So fly on, fly on, fly on, fly on, fly on, fly on, fly on
Cause there's angels in the midst
And they're guiding and watching me every day
And even though at times I let it get to me
Just a little and I go astray
We keep marching on and on
Young militants will watch and now we're growing
With kids of their own, as it all unfolds
As the world keeps turning on, the world keeps turning on

Blastin' off, castin' off
The ties that bind like a smashed guitar
Rode a mastodon out Jurassic Park
Chased by a fan in a Tyrannosaur mask
Travel the traffic cop
Past the spot
Where the ostrich got across for the ocelot
What I couldn't of bought
'cause they wouldn't a popped y'all
Just for me to cop it one

So I had to be up
I'm going gradually up
Into the galaxy bus
Until I can't feel my lungs
I pass the family up
I see an enemy's bus
Saw the anatomy up
I catch the ballerinas

Now I was walkin' down this one block
Didn't hear a gun shot
Smellin' hell or nature
Pickin' fruit off of a kumquat
Tree another day up in this life under the sunspot
Light upon my innervision searchin' for an answer
Heredetory, man-in-glory, days of the missile fury inventory took 
And while I raise
Rain began to fall from the verbal dance I did amaze all the natives
And the ladies said ""You're crazy - would you love to have my baby?""

Enchanters, 'cause I run their goose and I be the gander
Cleanin' out the digestive tract of hip-hop like cranberries
Shinin' like amber
All of the children told me ""Damn you're an 
Answer to our ears and deadly threat that's posed by cancer""
On Prancer, on Comet, on Cupid, I'm Santa
Got more flow than Flo Jo, while I laugh Ho Ho Ho, got jo jo dancer

With the bottle of bobs ?
In a big ol' box full of the latest compilations

Only the owls can see for this is when they start their prey

Say ""sorry not today"" and turn and walk away

Blackalicious,"'Whole house freeze!'
It was a Thursday I stepped to the club, there she was
Draped in a burgundy dress, silhouetted superbly
Curved indeed, she started staring in my direction
Luring and urging seductively, body language instructing me
I offered her a drink instead she took a cup of tea
And then I lied about my luxury lifestyle
I said 'so who you be? you looking kind of tight, gal
I would love to see you in a nightgown'
She said 'they call me the dragon queen and I come from tibet
I'm calm in the face of pressure and you'll never see me sweat
I've come to your country in search of a lost scroll
That contains directions to a hidden village comprised of gold'
I looked at her confused and said 'but why have you told me this?'
She said the description that I fit
Was that of the chosen one who'd go beyond
Then slipped a concoction in my drink
Immediately set my consciousness adriftà

Now I'm in that zone dwelling, I woke in a warehouse tied to a chair
With an abundance of flair surrounding me in a circular angle
Glared up at the dragon queen's lair, wasn't imagining a thing
Her steps on the stairs had a magic gleam, glowed brightly
To prepare me for my journey a sword was hovering towards me
Plus garlic from the keepers of the gate who bore all the secrets and take
Care of trespassers, but at last it's prophesied that I would gain
Access to a cultural dynasty buried and seize and capture the scroll
Massive helicopters patrolled the rooftops, strapped in
Began traveling into the darkness, knew not of what awaited
Thought of a way to get out of it, just then the bottom gave way
I began falling and gave it ten seconds, pulled the cord on my parachute
Landed surrounded by a herd of wild barracudas, lions
The sounds of the wild kingdom piercing like a siren
Was I entering near the mere mortal life span's end?
Defiantly I stood boldly as they began closing in
And time seemed to be moving rapidly just then
 
'whole house freeze!'
Just then I pulled the sword and somehow
It affected all the creatures as they stepped back and bowed
And the same glow that I seen in the sword I seen in the eyes of the lion
Who began leading me in a specific direction as if trying to tell me something
Just over the horizon, the same creatures who had been described
Appeared in statue form but their eyes scoped
And as I approached the gate they began to break open and cried
'after years we have finally been awakened!'
The assault was on, I got knocked to the ground by one
Shocked in an unorthodox form boxing
Throwing an abnormal proportion of body blows, karate chops
And drop kicks, plunged struggling deeper into the swamp
Then I grabbed my sword, the garlic put it around my neck
Saw that it was draining all of their energy and then with a swing
Off with their heads!
The gates slowly and mysteriously opened
So curiously I moseyed in with intensity focusing on my objective
Spider webs the size of king-size beds
Fell into a secret passage not knowing to where it lead
Just then the same light beamed brightly and in the distance
At that instance, lo and behold, the hidden scroll!
And just as I thought my mission was over
I could feel the dragon queen breathing heavily over my shoulder

As she began to transform and metamorphosise
She took on an assortment of legs, arms, heads and eyes
And sprouted two horns and began to breathe fire
So once again I grabbed my trusty sword but to my astonishment
She burned it to a crisp turned and grasped the scroll
And exited much faster than secreted gas, I'm gasping
Clasp full of flames cast in my direction
I saw my whole life flash and the possibility of death
And a casket passed into the ground, pound for pound, astounding
How could I survive and last another round inside this madness?

And I come like this

(scratched)
I've got a few things I wanna say

(Gift of Gab)
I'm gunnin', ya runnin away, do not stay
'cause the wrath of the gift will be hittin' ya spliff
And a lot of the crews got sprayed and yelled RAID
Like a couple of roaches, as struggle approaches,
A brother'll blow this
Another ferocious jam, I smother the ?grossagran?
I hover above the land of lame emcees that don't blow
I'm poppin' the clip and then bo bo with the gun
And a once in a munch chest, rest in peace
And I ?bellow you to beast? I abolish emcees with sounds like these
Run over enemies and I rest in the west
Dark hemisphere, burn wit a fear is nothin but a mere setback
Hear when I'm here,
Earn wit a clear conscience in the middle of the jet black
I'm a dog, running through the jungle
Wit a hoodie and black hat choppin down ?noonsies?
Not a frog, cunning yet I'm humble
Gotta do the jewels tack wack talkin clowns
Tip me, I'ma knock 'em all around, bust a front
With a fat blunt swinging on a vine in the homeland
I'ma tack 'em in the sound little punks when the rap bump
Springin on the rhyme I bowl man
Gifted when I'm lifted off a spliff hit,
Reminisce shit, riff with dipshits
This shit is the mischievous style of the gifted,
I'm a whiz kid, get a whiff kid
Swingin' down low, breakin' down flows
With a new flow medley outgrow when you step back
To the black with a fat rap with a fat sack
With a little bit a funk in my napsack
Take it back to the brother land
And I was smotherin' stupid idiots like Tarzan
Givin' back to the brother man and get another land,
Man gimme it, its Or-land-o
How easy and tight wishin' into the depths
Up in the sound in the heart of the jungle
Gettin' wild with the art of the rumble,
Never amount to be smarter than Dumbo
Make 'em mumble, make 'em humble,
Get me round from the start, you will crumble,
And you tumble, and you stumble
And I do it like that
From the end to the other end never gonna end,
Set a trend with the maniac mic clutch
Hey ?bob by the ba?, said you keep your day job
My competitors never know the right touch
Have to bail through the backstreets, raisin' hell to a black beat
Rappers fail to attack me, like a sail with the slack g
I attack 'em like acne, exactly UGH

(spoken)
Mindless cretins grow through idiosynchrosy
Peels up, rising up, down

(Lateef)
Steppin' up through the deep, dank murkiness
No telling what is lurking
I hero it, but will I sense a jerkin
I proceed to bust a buster
'cause I trust the finer design in the mind of the rhyme
Just about impossible to find
What a disgrace to the race of wack mc's
I am because I choose to stand my ground
FIRM and blowin' the rhythm the vermin and learnin'
All I know is we've earned every entry attained
And strained the game, and what I'm tryin' to explain is that
The deeper we're creepin' the more we find sleepin'
And slippin' just shootin' dead lips on a mission
Its missin' the reason the gift we've been given the rhythm
'cause that just the way we've been livin
And thrive in the essence, survive and its easy
To recognize when analyzing ?the bo?
Surprises the lame in this line and tryin'
To get you to buy into their fantasy world
Can it be damaged the ?emina? bones
Of the fellas and men that's exploting my culture
Can't understand every breast that you touch
Was as up ?paper scun? be one hung motherfucker
Such as nowadays, its fallin' and splinterin', just timber, instead of
Gettin out of my way, and what I'm -- meaning to say is that
The canopy that covers me now is the blackest, attack this
I thought we already established the wackness
Presented in the cemented jungle
By the bumblin' brothers stumblin' tumblin' down
Surround me in a cannibalistic style, but I just smile and
Silence 'em like the lambs, they all the whole flock
We just one magic stock style
I'm gettin' 'em off like crack viles, and wicked the whole fuckin while
Not trippin over no vines, or over no swine, or over no mines
Or over no line at the plot
Thinkin' of whippin' 'em like a glock in the jungle

(spoken)
Now in the beginning of the journey
Not in time, but in the mind
Imagine the camels being loaded up
The men, loading themselves up
It's a long journey -- the oasis is all in the clamor
As we start from the top we go to the very bottom
Of a myserious place -- a very mysterious place
What's that I see? Ahhhh

(Lyrics Born)
I can't even describe you, so I ain't even gon' try...hmmmm
Making hell of mc Asia is now this I don't dispute but you knew
You knew Lyrics Born was a ripped off note sheet of a hundred
And you scrape the paint off your bumpers making sure you beat the buzzer
Making sure Lyrics Born came out his mother's stomach
Covered with the lyrics that kill
No bumper, right? 'cause mo'fucka
I know you can make colors rhyme
And have the whole goddamn planet yellin uncle at you and even
Still take the time big up little ?egg?, can you imagine?
Big up Asia Born, this little bottle
Or that you would even be lightly concerned with little, little words
That you would tug at the line, pullin' the kind
Of lyrics out my mouth that make me big bad don, takin' kids' legs home
You can't even back a sliver roach, you know
That type shit, and then watch me wreck this stage
Boy like I got your daddy's style hangin' around my waist
And then watch me forget -- the way
Good lyrics taste, thinkin' I just ain't little rabbit eyes in your heart
Man, 'cause if I thought it was just
Lyrics Born that made lyrics born, lyrics born
And then suddenly I can't do no more, I'd be like
""Do you remember me?"" No, Asia
And you used to play my record on the way to the vapor

Sittin on top of the bay, watchin the tide 
It's time to break the tension away, come take a ride 
As you enter the dimension of the crew SoleSides 
it ain't nuttin goin on but a party 
Now brothers want to flex but I'm over they heads 
I got the funky type of style to rip your vocals to shreds 
I'm never runnin from the Feds wearin red Pro Keds 
Cause -- I ain't did nuttin to no-BODY! 
I dedicate that line to Shack from South Central 
Not sayin I'm the baddest but I know I got potential 
For every black man hung lyrically I lynch you 
Your style is kinda dry hope my melody can quench you 
My soul is one with all although my ego is against you 
See rap is a raw meat, so now I got to mince you 
I'm playin rappers out like an old pair of gym shoes 
I can do anything, I can do anything 
Crusin down the street in my six-four Impala 
Is what I'd like to be doin if only I had the dollars 
A baller ain't a baller if he ain't got balls 
A scholar ain't a scholar if he ain't got scho-lastic 
education, and if not that, then learn from life 
Beyond all of the material crap 
A human ain't a human if he doesn't make mistakes 
And the name of this song is Swan Lake 
Verse Two: 
A planet ain't a planet if it don't have wars 
A battle ain't a battle if you don't catch scars 
A mind that ain't inquisitive really doesn't got 
shit to live for if you can't explore the 
realms of thought you ought not test lest 
you be chomped up, like a pop rock, stopped for a 
bead from the weed lady, thought it was the bomb 
Really wasn't nuttin but a bag of strong palms 
Lost twenty dollars, didn't get high 
Maybe next time I use my finances right 
Live another day, learn another lesson 
Ain't no need to get my mental status cold stressin 
that it's so ill that it's fo'-real that it's 
no skill displayed, de shades gone now 
So it's time to build my own umbrella 
Tell it tell her hella mellow fellows loungin 
Better bread I never fled a header of the sounds and 
all I want to do is run my own universe 
Grab the mic and let my spirit just FLOCK when I croon a verse 
Mind over matter, spirit over mind 
A doobie and a skin funky breakbeats and rhymes 
A true blue homey to the end reminiscin with your 
sister in the living room gin 
A life with a plan nine acres on a land 
Building self by yourself helpin out a fellow man 
Prepare for the essence when your inner soul's free 
Before the departure plantin of the right seed 
I think what everybody's strivin for is peace of mind 
I'm thinkin the world is full of inner places that are out there to 
find 
Manipulated minds need to make an escape 
And the name of this song is Swan Lake

Blackalicious,"A forty ounce for breakfast gets a brother through the day 
I guess I shoulda had a V8 instead; anyway 
Let me contemplate my thought something back to a time 
When my fridge was full of booze but in my pocket not one dime 
I remember back on Willis Ave, with my ace-boom homey Mark Black 
I would start the day off hearin' the sound of the fo'-oh crack 
I went to work blitzed, so eventually I got dissed 

And caught a shocker when my supervisor said ""You're dismissed"" 
Now as I stare at my last check now my mind is stressed and depressed 
I spell relief S-T-I-D-E-S yes with a little excess less the worry 
Why go job hunting today? 
When I can sit back and smoke this sack and drink 
And feel my problems shrink away 
And by now, the rent's due in two weeks 

But inside my mind that's just another problem brew can delete 
I got evicted, to the point where the court martial came to my door 
And said, ""Get this kid: get your bags and split you don't live here no more"" 
And now I'm ass out; I'm so damn hungry I feel like I'm gonna pass out 
I asked my brother for a handout and he hooked me 
Though I knew he had doubts 
And rightfully so, cause I had new shit to deal with 

I'm so confused I have no control of my life I think I'll get lit 
So as my problems compile, I steady smile, oh yes 
Sippin' on that forty ounce that's leadin' me to a path of nowhere 
So as I think about tomorrow, I hesitate and say: 
A forty ounce for breakfast, will get me through the day.. 
A forty ounce for breakfast gets a brother through the day 
I guess I shoulda rolled a joint up instead; anyway 

Seems like every time I start I don't know when it's time to say when 
Now my mental gets all blurred and inside talk the ill-behavin'
Coolin with my boys, no names need to be mentioned 
At a party with some brothers I don't know I'm chillin' in some E&J 
With a forty O-Z to wash the shit down 
And plus a lot of marijuana now I need to sit down 
I can't remember the last time I was this blew out of my cranium 

My ears and head begin to hum aloud as the room spun; anyway 
Next thing I know I blacked out woke up with vomit all over my coat 
Start talkin' out my ass I can't see straight but yet I quote 
And I don't know what came over me, I started dissin' both my homies 
That I used to freestyle with and now I'm askin' them to show me 
What they got not thinkin' straight I don't know why I posed the challenge 
Now my ego is erupting as if I was Mt. Saint Helens 

Some shit was said I know I can't erase and now shit ain't the same 
I wish I had just one more chance to live that day again 
I strain; cause this bid was to find a true friend 
And loose them to booze in my system just ain't how I'm livin' 
Nothin' I could really say to mend up how someone else feels 
And so I guess I gotta wait and see if maybe the wounds will heal 
And I really didn't mean a word I said though I can't prove that 

Now the only thing that I can really say is I went out 
And out I went and now and then I get irate and say

A forty ounce for fuck!!

Then there still be the bump knockin in your trunk 
Get ya out your slump rockin it straight off the top

With a magic sock schnapps a big ass book and some vodka 
And pass it my way cause I'm a real big talker 
And i love new experiences I'm the godfather of gettin into to trouble
On the road undercover shit - take your whole crowd if you leave em uncovered
And i believe even hammer would say my shits proper work

The whiteness is likeness a constitution of fatness blackalicious jurassic more lytyrical madness

For all I know the earth is spinning slow
Suns at half mast 'cause masses ain't aglow
On bended knee, prostrate before an altered tree
I've made the forest suit me
Tables and chairs
Papers and prayers
Matter versus spirit
A metal ladder
A wooden cross
A plastic bottle of water
A mandala encased in glass
A spirit encased in flesh
Sound from shaped hollows
The thickest of mucus released from heightened passion
A man that cries in his sleep
A truth that has gone out of fashion
A mode of expression
A paint splattered wall
A carton of cigarettes
A bouquet of corpses
A dying forest
A nurtured garden
A privatized prison
A candle with a broken wick
A puddle that reflects the sun
A piece of paper with my name on it
I'm surrounded
I surrender
All
All that I am I have been
All I have been has been a long time coming
I am becoming all that I am
The spittle that surrounds the mouth-piece of the flute
Unheard, yet felt
A gathered wetness
A quiet moisture
Sound trapped in a bubble
Released into wind
Wind fellows and land merchants
We are history's detergent
Water soluble, light particles, articles of cleansing breath
Articles amending death
These words are not tools of communication
They are shards of metal
Dropped from eight story windows
They are waterfalls and gas leaks
Aged thoughts rolled in tobacco leaf
The tools of a trade
Barbers barred, barred of barters
Catch phrases and misunderstandings
But they are not what I feel when I am alone
Surrounded by everything and nothing
And there isn't a word or phrase to be caught
A verse to be recited
A man to de-fill my being in those moments
I am blankness, the contained center of an ""O""
The pyramidic containment of an ""A""
I stand in the middle of all that I have learned
All that I have memorized
All that I've known by heart
Unable to reach any of it
There is no sadness
There is no bliss
It is a forgotten memory
A memorable escape route that only is found by not looking
There, in the spine of the dictionary the words are worthless
They are a mere weight pressing against my thoughtlessness
But then, who else can speak of thoughtlessness with such confidence
Who else has learned to sling these ancient ideas
Like dead rats held by their tails
So as not to infect this newly oiled skin
I can think of nothing heavier than an airplane
I can think of no greater conglomerate of steel and metal
I can think of nothing less likely to fly
There are no wings more weighted
I too have felt a heaviness
The stare of man guessing at my being
Yes I am homeless
A homeless man making offerings to the after-future
Sculpting rubber tree forests out of worn tires and shoe soles
A nation unified in exhale
A cloud of smoke
A native pipe ceremony
All the gathered cigarette butts piled in heaps
Snow covered mountains
Lipsticks smeared and shriveled
Offerings to an afterworld
Tattoo guns and plastic wrappers
Broken zippers and dead eyed dolls
It's all overwhelming me, oak and elming me
I have seeded a forest of myself
Little books from tall trees
It matters not what this paper be made of
Give me notebooks made of human flesh
Dried on steel hooks and nooses
Make uses of use, uses of us
It's all overwhelming me, oak and elming me
I have seeded a forest of myself
Little books from tall trees
On bended knee
Prostrate before an altered tree
I've made the forest suit me

I waited hours for you guess that all was just a lie
Figured you stepped inside soon enough you said good bye

Oh how the seconds fly left without a second try
I check and try to recollect how I just let you die
And now I wallow in these severed ties

Befriended me but now we don't speak like we're enemies

There etched inside I take a ride when driftin through the spectrum
It's just at times I dwell and dwell and then I have to catch up
To now while back in time it ceased to march it just kept on
I want you back I want you back when it was here I slept on
What I appreciate a little more now as a blessing
Now I'm complaining and regretting

So seize me, I'm here to serve you if you serve me back
It's easy, but difficult that's time alone squeeze me
From beaming your feet when your all your actions turn to banking

So treat to just a slice of heaven why you cheat me?
Deceive me and now I'm hell inside these thoughts that link me

Man I can't wait until it's here I'm sayin
Oh what, you haitin? What, you think I'm playin?
You think I ain't just go ahead and watch me
I'll use the lessons yesterday has taught me
I'm countin hours, minutes even seconds
Man I can't even sleep, I'll build my Heaven
Oh what, it here?  Oh, oh what, it's what?
Don't even trip, just give me one more day
It's really gonna be on tomorrow

Chorus (repeat to end)

Your stuck in a flurry of illusions goin nowhere fast (repeat 3X)

Sample:
There we are. All finished.  
And you don't know how much I appreciate your pardon.

Watch out blazing arrow

Do it just how you talk it
Nigga rolled in and walk it
Stick a toe in the water
Don't falter, go on and fall in
Tell me, do you know your calling?
Yo, what your mission is fella?
I caught this vision when I met a fortune teller 
In New Orleans French Quarter
on the bus bench an arbitrary corner
Sorta scary looking elder woman showed up outta nowhere
She stared into my eyes and said
""Sure as eyes green
You were conceived and walk the earth
Spit that heat, purifying I believe.
So are you ready for your cleansin?
Cause this is only the beginning.""",Nowhere Fast,2002

[Rakaa, Gift of Gab]
Passion
The will to win, the spark within
Passion
The strength within the hearts of men
Passion
The drive to press, to strive for best, to rise
You've just arrived the quest is driven through
Passion
To play through pain and love the game
Passion
To break the chain and blaze the flame
Passion
The fight for rights to love your life, to rise
You've just arrived the quest is driven through

[Rakaa]
Propaganda, positive propositions
Politician, musician and a triple optician
Still part of my missions to slaughter the opposition
Critics that don't get it, I tell 'em to stop bitchin'
I do without blacks, I've done it without cash
Strictly for the love of the art - that's passion
Flashin', rappin' or jammin' or soundblastin'
When Quannum meets Expansion, this is what happens

[Gift of Gab]
Runnin' through the jungle with a flare gun
Arrow-arms, zoning out my mind
Like I was hooked on hero-ine
Take the fire, turn it up and blaze whole forest down
Pullin from within' the inner insane warrior
California to the District of Columbia
Hella high octane, lookin' through a lazy eye
All ablaze, fire, flames, lightin' up the sky
Runnin' through the burnin' sun, yellin'
Ride, nigga ride, nigga ride..

(Chorus)

[Rakaa]
Desire, the fire that inspires
I don't state facts, I state buildings, like empires
Passion
The journey, the learnin', the time-turnin'
The searchin', the mind yearnin' to wake and find morning
Passion
The ladies they love the long-lasting
Asking for action, braced for satisfaction

Passion
The black-skinned African jazz-men of the half in Aspen
Relaxed, gettin' my back rubbed

Sent vibrations for years, I've been waiting for years

Blackalicious,"One precious love so good to me
One precious love the purest thing
One precious love so good to me
One precious love the purest thing

Was born in a small town (?), California
Where them gangstas bang ghetto life thuggin on the corner
Youngest child of six
When I came pops split with momma
Used to visit on the weekends
Till he moved to the north side of Cali
14 he died, 15 my moms died
Alcoholic diabetic forces were my life too
Moved with my older brother taught me discipline
But I wasn't ready though still shocked and holding pain in
So I skipped school got F's got the posters on my wall
takin down no TV times I felt like ya'll ain't want me around
Set up in my room developing the mind of a loner
Writin rhymes rappin out my days instead of homework
Through it all my three sisters placed the place like one time
As I was like this rap thing is gonna pay I know that I was triflin
But still set in my ways livin for better days
Until I die I'm startin if I'm broke or with that cheddar check

One precious love so good to me
One precious love the purest thing
One precious love so good to me
One precious love the purest thing

purest purest
purest purest
purest purest purest purest!

Love

The two realest cats I know? My two older brothers
The most beautiful woman in the galaxy? My mother
The strongest black women raising kids alone? My sisters
The best part of my future is my present love interest
The most important time? Right now and ever after
The greatest expression is love, happiness, and laughter
See life is a book and this song is just another chapter
I'll stay down to earth and real if you speak I'll speak back
I'm not a preacher or a scholar I'm merely just a rapper
I probably don't fit in to the current state of -
- what you consider that to be So you ask how can I rap
if I ain't thugged out, pimpin, flossin my ice, packin a gat
Man if this is what I got, I want dough I can't lie
But never sell my soul 'n front inside mainstream's eyes
The purest love is how I'm driven, sent, and reach for my goals
If nothing else I'll leave the world some songs that speak from the soul

One precious love so good to me
One precious love the purest thing
One precious love so good to me
One precious love the purest thing

One precious love so good to me
One precious love the purest thing
One precious love so good to me

It's automatic sporadic movements on the brake 
The moment's magic the last thing that I should do is think 
I burst the energy that hints that really it's no time 
At birth you start to think that after death back to no mind 
A rest that makes you new again now you embrace the planet 
And stand in all of all the thing you daily took for granted 
The trees are posin' all unique in form make this perfection 
The most important time is now tomorrow's a projection 
A co-creator if you only just believe in that

This breath's so unique we must trace where we landed 
Magnetizin' minor tracks is subliminal 
So fiend-in to the evidence is evident I'm bein' true 
True to the moment the channelin' the callin' 
True to the heartbeat the passion and the formin' 
This rollercoaster's the one I stood in line for 
Hands in the air these upside downs here are paid for 
Make this relevant and here what you gotta hear 
I'm recordin' all the secrets of my silent shed 
Don't think about it just absorb everything you taste 
If it set you free you gonna find the ways 
You're who you gonna be unless you choose otherwise 
If you let it flow the universe will empathize 
Check your programs they monitorin' your sanity 
Now close your eyes inside you find the clarity 
It's automatic!

Live at it and set it 
Move again your clarity start to assume again 
I know this one twist will feel it in 
You think you don't know the engine ?
But it's so automatic 
So so so automatic 

It's automative, beyond the common logic native 
Beyond the ball around my drama now I'm divin' waitin 
So stop and wait this, now operate it on the wavelength 
A thought of way is presented by true laws of nature 
Across the nation a lost of patience is cost inflation 
So caught in waitin', and contemplatin' obligations 
Read up inaugurations politrations violatin 
And all the haters all up it cannot invadin' 
The honest tension, two orders sacred not created 
Good thought I made it!! I'm born beyond the constellations 
So concetratin', and follow man we all are awakin'

[Intro - message continued from interlude] 
""I'm just gonna read you a little bit of ?: 
'I like to start off by saying that prison is truly a living hell 
It is a place where love and compassion are looked upon as weaknesses 
And violence and brutality are worn like a medal of honor 
Prison is a tedious task of survival that could shatter your dreams and ambition 
The California Department of Corrections ISN'T designed 
to help you rehabilitate yourself or even help you 
to become a productive law-abiding citizen'""

[Gift of Gab - Verse One] 
Young leaders, little unsung heroes 
You can run some meters, be a hoop or a track star 
School teacher, scientist, or even 
own your very own street, maybe even be a rap star 
Times witcha, you could change whole pictures 
Make a better situation, for your mother and yo' big mama 
Make dollars, own a ride and a house 
Get it right, use your powers, getting' everything you did want 
Then the youth say, ""Look at where I'm at now 
Straight poverty, death is in my backyard 
Dope dealers, get fifty G's a pack 
While my teacher don't really give a damn about a black child! 
And the grown folks say, 'tell the truth', then act fowl 
Say 'no' to drugs, hidin' all they crack vials 
And talk all about peace and love and God 
But then why are we at war, killin' people in Iraq now?"" 

[Chorus] 


[Verse Two] 
Young sista had a child, still young herself now 
And it's others all around screamin' turmoil 
Ain't done wit' school, how are you gonna make it now? 
Life is gonna be a little harder for you girl 
Some how, she sees the face of a child 
And on her face is a smile, and now it's brighter up in her world 
And makes her stronger now, she's gotta carry on 
And be a very good mama, this is life, let it unfurl 
And she's doin' it, mother of the earth now 
Found a blessin' in the struggle through her first child 
Kept goin', kept growin', kept flowin' 
Kept strivin', kept knowin' God would make a way somehow 
Live yo' life, girl, show 'em how it's done now 
I believe in you, so keep it movin' 'til the sun's down 
Never let them hold you back from anything you want now 
Life is but a ride, so find the treasures that are unfound 

[Chorus] 

[Verse Three] 
Young brotha, takin' care of his mother 
Makin' bread, gotta hustle, 'cause the table's lookin' thin now 
Stress ridden as he walks his little sister 
to her preschool, which is up the road just a few miles 
Back at the house, his mom seeks magic 
Through the pipe smoke travelin' through her lungs out and back down 
Worst part that breaks the young man's heart 
is he's the one that's supplyin' it, he feels like he's trapped now 
'Cause every time he says, ""No"", then she'll spaz out 
Start shakin', ""Mama, please, where is dad now?!"" 
Guess he's gotta be the home's only man now 
Left the life alone and gotta whole other plan now 
Stacked enough to put her in a rehab found 
Work and got a G.E.D., his sister's in his hands now 
And with support from other members in the fam 
Gonna make it out this struggle, young people, here's your chance, come on!

I didn't have to reap, the work put in but then 
even the work in itself was such a blessin

that come not from minds, but that travel through spiritual reasons 
Some of the time, I feel like, it's not even me 
No mon-ey can buy gateways to infinity 
Still I'm hun-gry to shine, when I know I should let it be 
I want but I have, every single thing that we need

I know all you fellas have had a lady in your life that, you really appreciated 
And you wanted to do something special for her and, let her know it 
Well, I gotta lady like that, and I wrote this song to her...",My Pen and Pad,2005
Blackalicious,"Met her out of town 
In a small cafe 
She had the motion of the ocean 
How her hips did sway 
She had everybody lookin' back 
And everybody tookin' back 
And anything she wanted all the guys 
Obeyed 
Now she was a site for sore pupils 
And she likes to flaunt it cause she knows she got it 
And she does the most intoxicating things 
To make a man with worries 
Feel everything is okay 

[Chorus] 
She's got powers 
And I think I want to get in her spell 
Powers 
Every bone inside me of all my cells 

She holds you down but when you need a push 
She keeps it honest 
She reflects 
Then she'll force you to look 
You dig everything about her 
From her head down to her follicles 
There's a heaven in her smile 
She'll steal your heart like a crook 
Now she knows 
Exactly what you want and when 
And she goes 
To any measures just to see you get it 
And she flows 
Like the now 
I think that she was Nephertiti in a life 
Before this present life was took 
She got powers 

[Chorus] 

P-O-W-E-R-S 
Fizz and bubble when I see her yes 
Want to see just how deep her abyss gets 
Lost in the magic of her secret bliss 
She is a bonafide keeper just 
Want to travel inside and seek her depths 
Mystique so fresh 
From the west coast to the east coast 
It's a death blow make a Negro get 
Spun up in her web she don't need no net 
People low and behold 
She knows just 
What I need make an ego 
What I need make an ego 
Fly like an eagle 
Feelin' regal, o b-o-y 
O she's so fly 
Lethal injection 
Frozen in my step like deep in breath 
Keepin'a brethren like me in a head spin 
Doc take a rain check 
She is the medicine 
 
She got some tricks and she got some treats 
She'll shake the ground underneath you 
Knock you off your feet 
She got everything you dream about 
Everything you think about 
Hear melodies and sounds of music 
When she speaks 
She stays persistent with her energy 
And she plays 
Those games when its time to play 'em 
And she ages 
Like the finest kind of wine 
And just a whiff of her ferment 
Will make your knees get weak",Powers,2005

[Lateef The Truth Speaker - Verse One] 
When you first walked in and I saw you at the bar or somethin' 
I ain't really wanna holler or nothin' 
I just pegged you as the type for frontin' 
Steady chucklin' with your girlfriends actin' contrary and cluckin' 
But ya song came on, and somethin' changed in the way she was movin' along 
Eyelashes caught flashes of the possibilities, maybe this one is the one for me 
She's movin' to the dance floor, we'll see 
What I seen was inspirational, highly motivational 
Had to maneuver the set, up to confrontationals 
Even though it was my chance to mack 
I already did my dance, had the reservoir tapped 
Hit me like a thunder clap, though 
Can't let somethin' that fat pass BY, why asks why? 
Made my way through the crowd with the side to side 
Then I pushed up on the tush 'cause, uh, I ain't shy! 
Said, ""Excuse me Miss, but I liked what I saw"" 
When she spoke, I damn near dropped my jaw! 
HELL NAW! I can't believe she SAID that shit! 
I need to call my sister, ""Come up through and check this chick! 
And put some sense in her, cause her IQ 'bout six"" 
Bein' that, stu-pid in pub-lic there should be a law against 
I mean, she didn't have a CLUE, tell you what to do 
Just SHUT UP, ride the groove, and let's move now

When I stepped into the coliseum, I was slidin' through 
Just bein' me, lovin' the space and lettin' everything be free 
And bein' free to 'til I seen her, me, I popped up, solutions 
Could it be? She was the one that could make me a believa? 
Step through the crowd like a bobber and a weaver 
Couldn't really see the crowd, all that I could see was HER 
Looked directly in her eyes, all that I could see was blurred vision 
Couldn't really tell if she was prime and ready furr pickin' 
She was downin' that 'Yac in straight shots 
Offered me a drink, I told her I was tryin' to stop 
I thought to reconsider mackin', then she pulled off her top 
and yelled, NEXT THING I KNOW, SHE WAS DOIN' THE WOP 
She said, ""Gabby, Gabby, Gabbyyy, you need to come and swig"" 
I said, ""I think I'm cool, you need to find another nigga"" 
Baby, baby, baby PLEASE, then she dropped down to her KNEES 
Then I had to leave, I didn't want to contract diseases 
I said, ""Don't take it personal, I think you need Jesus 
You're movin' kinda fast, you need to stop and just breathe"" 
Hopin' she would have a clue, tell you what to do 
Just SHUT UP, ride the groove and let's move, now..

The rati-o was in favor of me, 'cause as far as I could see 
all the bitties on the FLO'-woe-woe 
was movin' in such a way in the heat, kinda made me wanna pee 
Leavin' ME wanting MO'-woe-woe 
But I was scared, of major defeat, 'cause I saw the girl Lateef 
was dancin' with sayin' NO-woe-woe 
and Gab was wrestlin' with a freak who was topless 
I was intimated to SHOW, any interest at ALL 
I just stood still, pressed against the walllll (that's when I saw her) 
Time froze, the ice around my heart e-RODED 
Glasses she looked like a spy, wanna decode it 
I said, ""My name is Pi-Pi-Pigeon Johnny"" 
Stuttered a little bit, felt like a big DU-mmy 
She said I didn't have a clue, she told me what to do - 
She said, ""SHUT UP and ride the groove"" 
I said, ""Okay"", like..

[Intro to ""Automatique"" - Natalie Stewart of Floetry] 
If you gonna be creative, y'know 
You're ultimately offering yourself as a sacrifice 
A sacrifice of, channeling something, bigger than yourself 
and existing here at the same time, y'know 
Being measured upon your words 
when you're channeling yourself at higher than your state 
is a pre' serious, jump to take on 
So, if they truly about, the word 
poetry, singing, writing, and drawing and painting 
or however it is, then y'know 
want us to realize we're here to record ripples of vanity, y'know 
Ripples of mathematics, that's really what you're dealing with..",Side to Side,2005

Su-preme (Supreme, Supreme) [repeat 8x] 

Su-preme people living with they backs aligned 
Up against the wall cause these days are asinine 
Living in a money matrix, How cats survive 
Some will fade away and wither, others will blast a 9 
Kings and Queens working 9 to 5's 
And making nothing searching for a deeper purpose in life 
This CAN""T be life... 
? can't be right... 
Without no money in my pockets I just can't see right 
I used to try to preach to younguns like, ""Do right kids"" 
Now-a-days all that I can say is, ""Get it how you live"" 
Live how you get it, shit! 
Don't nobody wanna get... 
A promotion up to fry cook like little Calvin did 
Some would rather take a gamble, hey they might to bids 
The allure of fast money in this hell-bound system 
Got you look at two-hundred bucks a week 
Versus, like a thousand in a day 
Tell me what makes more sense to these... 

[Chorus] 

Trapped like rats in mazes for the cheese 
Every natural resource is here, We don't really need money 
But certain people need power over people 
They act like that cause they're trapped inside their EGO-sphere 
And now you can't feel free 
Without material possesions, you can't just be (Be: echo) 
And without 'em you're left stressin, so anxiously (Be: anxiously) 
So you grab the Smith & Wesson, then aim, then squeeze (Squeeze: echo) 
To get what's comin' to ya 
The block's so hot, it blew the top off the thermometer 
The rush for drama is more appealing than a plane light 
Cause life is insane, so insanity is a sane light 
It's so easy to see, simple as day and night 
SU-preme people born out of the way of the light 
In the darkness, trying to fly straight 
To some folks it's like being a fish swimming with sharks... shit! 

[Perhaphs not since men turned their ears the preachings of a mere prophet 
2000 years ago have the words of humble men reached so many with such force 
? Perhaps because it has been burning for long, now smoldering 
Now bursting into hot flames, now hastily covered over to smolder again 
Until the next outbreak.]

SU-preme people only want the best and uhh 
SU-preme people won't settle for less then uhh 
Straight from royalty put inside projects and uhh 
Capitalist system that don't make sense to ya 
SU-preme people put against the fence, Get up! 
? hostile if you aint fixing the... 
Problem you created that make these condition up 
A little reparation for your acts are sent to us 
SU-prome ride to die to get the bucks 
? by any means so, uhh, lock your benzes up 
Tuck your chain and watch and keep your defenses up 
All they wanna do is live it up like ?

Introduction to the nation of revolutionary thoughts 
Hear the sound evolve, expand, and change 
Most of the things that we're sayin' haven't broken through your chatter 
So y'all niggaz still ego trip based and 
Have not begun to taste the kundalini wisdom bliss 
I'm droppin' as a lyric quotin' vessel for the stages 
Play this on your play list 
I like dough 
But musically I'm transcendin' the physical 
And don't blame me for the slang and the words 
God writes these rhymes through me 
I just listen to him 
I'm just livin' duke 
Matrix driven rules haven't fooled me 
Cuz I still think abstract 
And stay metaphysical 
And challenge what is really real 
And keep creatin' with the force to bring rap back 
Not that it's away 
But everybody got somethin' to say 
So let me speak the opposite of what's hot now 
And make that hot 
So it will get exploited 
And the corporation only will back dudes who bite my style 
And they can try and try again 
I've been influenced by a lot of pioneers

Gets on stage with a real MC

On second thought, I'm like a letter man though

Shootin' through your vains, vibratin' though your eardrums 
Used to think 30 years old then the end comes 
Now I feel like I'm just gainin' momentum

About to vacate there when we finish this one 
Work hard but still some sweep 
We won't mention them 
In fact, they act as fuel for our engine 
Engine engine number 9, mic lynchin' 
When we're done with this these songs are our pension 
MCs are puppets, Me, I'm Jim Henson

Separate the weak from the fighters
Presented as the minority with mass destruction behind us

through the apathy translate in these bars
Locked in a cage fight
Face to face with my consequences 
From decisions that I made 
I
Felt like I would fall by the wayside 
And not make it through the raging fire
It’s thin line between love and hate
Fear and Faith 
I situate in a lukewarm state

Et ne veut pas comprendre

Un marteau en main toute ta vie

Et s'arrête au cinéma

Et dans les froids moments de l'incertitude
Il y a au plus profond de ta solitude
Derrière les murs de l'incompréhension

Un espoir rempli de passion
Tu prendras l'avenir comme il te viendra
Si tu veux il sera pour toi

Et dans les rues mouillées aux couleurs de l'ennui
Et ce chien qui hurle au silence de la nuit
Ton cœur trop serré a envie d'exploser

A la face d'un monde résigné
Tes yeux aveuglés par l'enfance trompée
S'ouvriront sur la vérité

Ta génération en veut à la terre entière
Le long des routes il ne trouve que la misère
Mais tes doigts sont en or et sur ta guitare

Tu joueras pour sortir du noir
Devant les lumières de la célébrité
Tu pourras faire briller le nom

Ouais, que ton père t'a donné

Isn't that gonna be the 2nd month in a row in May?

Blaze, niggas, let's behave, niggas
Tha onez in the club now dictate, niggas

So you think you can take my life?
Think you can take my wife?
Well, I'll like to see you try when I've got my knife

I'll stab you in the back
Run to your house, then give your mum a slap
Don't fuck with me
Otherwise 6 feet under is where you're gonna be

He'll give us what we need 
On a flying canoe we ride 
To the révellion or die

Touch not a cross or swear on the Lord's name Or your soul is lost
Be back before the light as well 
If not it's straight to hell 
We put our fears aside 
To the rules we will abide

Blackguard,"A choice to make 
A narrow road and no easy answers 
Make a stand today 
Small is the gate and hardship's what you'll face

Do you see what I've become 
Or would you stop what I've begun 
If your scorn is my gain then get out of my way 
And I'll see you on the road 

If I have the strength for this 
Will I be the one to stand alone?
And if I can overcome 
Will I be the better man for it? 

This is the sword that divides us all
Make one wrong move and watch me fall 
The burden of the choices made 
How high the price 
Never thought you'd pay 

These wounds run deep, see 
The fears as they creep 
Now left alone
Abandoned and cold
Deserted, defeated 
For the things that you believe in

If they turned their back to you
If they all just turned away from you 
All from those who you thought you knew 
What if this is what was asked of you",The Sword,2009

To sit with a glass and think of memories passed 
Now's a time for fun not for quarrels and fears 
I just needed to get out so
Pour me a beer

So cheers for the beers and hail to the ale

You're looking kinda pale

This round's on me

Good tunes, good brew, good friends 
What we have you can't break or bend 
I put another 50 down 'cause

So raise your glasses high 
To your brothers side by side 
And we'll remember all the good times we've shared 
So raise your glasses high 
To the things that can go in the blink of an eye 
And we'll still be here having one hell of a good time 

Have a drink for your job 
Where you slave all day to the long days and the long hours 
But at least it pays your way

I could never truly understand

Out of reach from a healing.

You know, I'm losin' sleep
And I've run out of excuses
For why I let you leave
You said you needed a little time
But it's been too long
I know you need your independence, girl
But I'm not that strong

Well there's got to be a way
That we can make ammends
This was all we ever wanted
Please don't let it end

Hold me harmless
There's nothin' else I can do
I'll always love you baby
Show some kindness
And hold me harmless

I've been told my love was gentle
Thought I had an easy touch
Until I met you, I never knew
You could love someone too much

Thought we'd last forever
I guess it just goes to show
If love is gonna put down roots
It's gotta have room to grow

My only crime of passion
Was that I pushed too hard
And if love's what I'm accused of
Then I'm guilty as charged

Hold me harmless
There's nothin' else I can do
I'll always love you baby
Show some kindness
And hold me harmless

Well I learned an honest lesson
Guess I never realized
If I overstepped my limit
Then I apologize

Won't you just hold me
Won't you just hold me

Holiday or vacation
But I need you all the time

Every beat of my heart
Every thought in my head
Points straight to you
Underlined in red
Every move I make
Every minute of mine
I need you all the time

I need boots when I'm walking
A southern drawl when I'm talking
And I run when I wanna unwind
Some cash when I'm going
Some freedom for growing
And some preaching to keep me in line
They could build it or dream it
I could take it or leave it
  But I need you all the time

BlackHawk,"It takes a dreamer
To get this far from my hometown
A real believer
To look up when things are down
It takes a fool to let a good life fall apart
But, when a man knows something's missing in his heart
It takes a woman

It takes forever
To get beyond the bitter years
And if I ever
If I ever get that far from here
I can look back, and say that I survived
But for a man to really make it in this life
It takes a woman

You can gain the world or lose your soul
But if you don't have someone to hold
You can't feel the victory for defeat
Climb higher than you've ever gone
When you reach the top, you're still alone
Flying high don't make a man complete
It takes a woman

Any fool can let a good life fall apart
But foolish pride can't fill an empty heart
It takes a woman",It Takes a Woman,2000

From backwoods without a name
Carrying their guitars and a heart full of southern soul
Down the dusty roads of Caroline
The Tucker boys were friends of mine
They echoed through the lonely pines
Running down the road 
And the day the Caldwells died
Before the rugged cross we cried
A voice from deep inside
Said you gotta carry on
And on and

And ragged voices heaven-sent
Singing hallelujah and dancing in the aisles

An angel's voice and the devil's smile

And the day the Freebird died
Before the rugged cross we cried
The grey ghost he rides 
Said you gotta carry on
And on and

Likewise with anyone
It's not so dangerous
It's not a smart thing to do
But if I had my choice
I'd take away his voice
And tell him I might be a clown
But I sure ain't no fool

Everyone seems to be waiting
For some deep thought or emotion
Someone to get the devotion
To what they do
But they don't understand
That when you find that man
He'll be doing it for himself
He ain't doing it for you

Come on train
Come on train
Can't you see I'm freezing here

Three is one too many
And one is one too few
Two just makes me lonely
And I can't get along with you
Man standing by the highway
Is lonesome as can be
Man standing by a boxcar
Looks a lot like me

Come on trainâ?¦

Fearless of flying
But I'm tired of climbing
And this time I've got to go
All the way

Or that it didn't matter

She only dreams about me when I'm gone
My heart rises to my mouth as she passes
By me
And I can't make a sound

She gives me a mirror in a picture frame
She says don't be afraid to blame your blues
On the man you see inside
He's trying desperately to hide

I know she's right
And I can't fight the feelings
That the man inside's not ready for revealing
I walked beside him on a stage
Watched him trying to make believe
He's read the pages of wisdom

Now everyone has a needle
Which we turn to in times of escape
Injecting our realities with some fantasy
Makes it all easier to take
Some people say that it sets them free
But me I found that it seldom lets you see
That the path your foot falls on
Doesn't make a sound

I know I'm right and
I can't fight the feelings
That the hearts of men aren't ready for
Revealing
I walked beside them in the rain
Watched their distant and their mortal pain
And it's all a shame

I was born to be a traveler, I must have landed on my head
I used to dream that I was flying, I was falling out of bed
Then the family started moving, but some got left behind
And we learned to send postcards, like letters from the frontline
Out of sight but never out of mind
I was born to be a traveler
To roll and ride

My Mother she told me how to get out of the country
Wrap the teacups up in comics and you can read them later
Learn to tie a knot but you must always have a blade
And cuts are just a consequence of the choices that you made
She showed me when to leave and my Father taught me why
I was born to be a traveler
To roll and ride

I'm running for love
For love and for money
I run when I'm stung
When I stumble and fall
I fall into the future
Not a break in my stride
I was born to be a traveler
To roll and ride

Early in the evening, I take my stuff out of the car
Someone asks me, maybe they could look at my guitar
And I open up the case, a little worn, a little frayed
A little weary of creating all the miles I have made
A gallery of faces, where the memories collide
I was born to be traveler
To roll and ride

There's supernatural in my hair
Space invaders all around me
Freak me out when I get down there

I'm getting old before my time and it?s too late

Way back in World War II
Playing his guitar in the sleeper car
To lullaby the lucky few

He worked the Canadian Pacific line
To satisfy his wandering bones
There weren't a lot of men that he couldn't call friend
Or places that he couldn't call home, good Lord
Places that he couldn't call home

Saying, ""Mr. Conductor put the hammer down
I'm not gonna rest 'till I reach Hammer Town
I got a girl on the East Side and there's a band on the West Side

He never crossed over that American border
Though he lived just a few miles away
He said, ""Everything I need I can find right here
North of the USA""

Guitar and piano and a thousand tunes
And his brothers just playing all night
Singing every song from the hit parade
And swinging by the steel mill light, good Lord

The same way that he's always been
Lighting up the aisles with a heavenly smile
And bringing everybody in

You're not here tonight
It's dark outside
You couldn't find a ride
Things were loose
Time got tight
Must've been an oversight
You'll write me of where you might be
Now the candle's burned out and the wine's all gone
And the dogs outside are gonna howl 'til dawn

I'm gonna lock all the doors
I'm gonna bolt all the windows
I'm gonna turn off that lonesome song
I'm gonna wipe out your words
I'm gonna tear up your picture
I'm gonna pray that it won't be long

What loneliness is about

Make it good

And I'm under your spell

I'm like a spider crawling up the wall
Still looking for his all and all

Peeping through the blinds
Oh honey come here running
Don't you take your time

But I'll be shouting hallelujah when I see you come

But I'm still carrying a heavy load

The ones I'd loved the best
Were the things that I'd left behind...

How worlds of change led us astray
Colors seem to fade to gray
In the wake of yesterday...

You looked into my eyes
You had me hypnotized and

A thousand stars lit up the sky
I touched your hand and you were gone
But memories of you live on...

You looked into my eyes
You had me hypnotized and
I can still remember you...
Those moments spent together promising forever and
I can still remember you

Do you ever think of me
And get lost in the memory
When you do, I hope you smile
And hold that memory a while...

The original vagabond
You strayed into my arms

Would keep you unharmed

Now I see you standing
With leaves falling around
And snow in your hair
Now you're smiling out the window
Of that hotel
Over Washington Square
Our breath comes out white clouds
Mingles and hangs in the air
Speaking strictly for me
We both could have died then and there

Now you're telling me
You're not nostalgic
Then give me another word for it
You are always so good with words
And at keeping things vague

I've already paid

In the middle ran a stream so blue
A maiden fair, in despair
Once had met her true love there and she told him

She would say
""Promise me, when you see
A white rose you'll think of me
I love you so, never let go
I will be your ghost of a rose""

She would lay amongst the leaves of amber
Her spirit wild, heart of a child
Yet gentle still and quiet and mild and he loved her

A white rose you'll think of me
I love you so, never let go

Dancing to the setting sun as he watched her
And ever more he thought he saw

He wrote in great detail
How cleverly he planned
All of the killings

How precisely he executed
His insane fantasies
It was all so perfect
Except for one thing, one thing
One thing, one thing, one thing

I like to watch from my car
I like to make sure you don't go far
I know the hours you sleep
Don't approve of the company that you keep

While you're in work I'm alone
In your room, on your bed and you'll never know
I like to go through your things
The touch, the smell, the joy it brings

I know where you live
I know where you hide
I know what keeps you alive

I know where you go
I know who you know
I know where you’re spending your nights

I don't like the guy in the suit
Or that street punk in the combat boots
You may not see them again
I showed them a quick but a painful end

I know where you live
I know where you hide
I know what keeps you alive

I know where you go
I know who you know
I know where you’re spending your nights

I see, I feel, I watch over you
I see, I feel, I watch over you

I want to know what you say
I need to hear the prayers you pray
I like to play with your hair
When you sleep and you dream
And there's no one there

I know where you live
I know where you hide
I know what keeps you alive

I know where you go
I know who you know
I know where you’re spending your nights

Hidden in the shadows watching always

One cold and silver winter's day
I could hear another worldly call

When the ivy overgrew I could never leave

Ça n'arrive qu'aux autres, on ne réalise pas tant que ça ne nous touche pas
On sait très bien ce qu'il se passe ailleurs mais on ose se plaindre
Relativise, ferme les yeux et imagine toi
Tu verras comme ta vie est belle!

Ferme tes yeux et imagine ta vie
Dans ces pays où les hommes politiques sont en treillis
Où la liberté d'expression est une conspiration
Où le dollar civilise avec des canons
Où l'on peut mourir d'une simple fièvre
Où les épidémies se promènent sans laisse
Crois-tu vraiment tenir sous la canicule
Dans ces pays où, pendant deux mois tu bronzes, eux toute l'année ils brûlent!
Imagine ta vie sans eau potable
Une douche les jours de pluie, pas de bouffe mise sur la table
Imagine toi dans un hôpital
Avec une maladie incurable, une maladie qui te juges, coupable
Imagine toi enfermé comme Natasha Kampusch
Ou brûlé comme Mama Galledou dans le bus
Ouvre les yeux maintenant
Et avant d'insulter la vie, réfléchis dorénavant!

Ça n'arrive qu'aux autres, on ne réalise pas tant que ça ne nous touche pas
On sait très bien ce qu'il se passe ailleurs mais on ose se plaindre
Relativise, ferme les yeux et imagine toi
Tu verras comme ta vie est belle!

Ferme les yeux et imagine toi quelque part en Afrique
Dans un village bâtit de terre, sous un soleil de plomb
Imagine l'air chaud et lourd, cette étendue désertique
Ce maigre troupeau de chèvres et ce bâton
Imagine cette longue marche que tu dois accomplir
Afin que tes bêtes puissent pêtre et se rafraîchir
Ces 30 bornes à faire
Ces voleurs de bétails et leurs kalachnikovs qui tirent sans réfléchir
Imagine Madagascar et ses montagnes d'ordures
Imagine tes 8 ans et tes pieds sans chaussures
Imagine tes mains dans les détritus
Pour un bout de pain mais tu t'y habitues
Imagine Paris et son périphérique
Quelque part sous un pont pas loin du trafic
Imagine toi sous un duvet sale
Luttant contre le froid, luttant contre la dalle
Maintenant imagine toi dans ta voiture bloqué dans les embouteillages
L'homme sort lentement de sa couverture, l'homme a ton visage
Dis-moi ce que tu ressens, le regardes-tu autrement?
Avant d'insulter la vie réfléchis dorénavant!

Ça n'arrive qu'aux autres, on ne réalise pas tant que ça ne nous touche pas
On sait très bien ce qu'il se passe ailleurs mais on ose se plaindre
Relativise, ferme les yeux et imagine toi
Tu verras comme ta vie est belle!

Karl, imagine toi sans la musique
La santé abîmée par les 3-8
Les aller-retour aux ASSEDIC

Saïd, imagine toi sans cette réussite
En galère, juste le SMIC
Prisonnier de cette tour de brique

Imagine toi sans Sniper
Moi sans Psy 4 et ces bons moments que d'autres ne connaissent pas!

Imagine un peu nos vies sans tout ça
C'est pour ça ! Remercions Dieu pour tout ça
Pardon pour tout les jours où je me plains
Les jours où je ne vois que moi, mon nez et pas plus loin!

Pardon pour toutes ces fois où j'ai grossi mes problèmes
Toutes ces fois où j'ai fais tourner le monde sur moi-même

Ferme tes yeux juste une seconde
Vois la misère du monde
Et ta place dans tout ça

Prenons conscience de la chance qu'on a
Et tu verras peut-être
Que la vie est belle!

Blacko, Soprano!

Blacko,"C’est un hommage pour ma reine, un chant d’amour et de peine
Elle s’en est allée, depuis plus rien ne va, mon cœur saigne
Son absence me fait mal et la tristesse me tourmente
Je n’sais plus où j’en suis, Maman tu me manques
Tu es partie si tôt, j’aurais tant aimé que tu voies
Tes petits-enfants grandir et rire autour de toi
Je leur parlerai d’une femme, courageuse et exemplaire
Afin que mes petites lionnes soient aussi forte que leur grand-mère
Tu gardais l’sourire malgré la maladie
Tu as rejoint les anges, dans les jardins du Paradis
Tu es restée forte pour nous préserver
Jusqu’à la fin tu as voulu nous protéger
Puis tu es partie rejoindre le Ciel
Notre amour est plus fort que la mort, il est éternel
Alors je suis sûr qu’on se reverra
Et que j’pourrais encore te serrer dans mes bras

Mama je sais que tu es là quelque part
Je sais que tu m’entends, et que tu peux me voir
Écoute mon poème, ma reine
Mon cœur veut chanter pour toi
Depuis que tu es partie, ça n’est plus pareil
Il manque le plus joli rayon à mon soleil
Maman je t’aime, je ne t’oublie pas

Mama je sais que tu es là près de moi
Tu es l’ange-gardien qui veille sur moi
Mon être est déchiré, depuis ton départ
Difficile oui dur de te dire au revoir
Je garde nos souvenirs au fond de mon cœur
Je ferai tout pour qu’tu sois fière, j’te ferai honneur
J'apprendrai à mes filles à être aussi forte que toi
Tu continues de vivre à travers elles, à travers moi
Je suis persuadé qu’un jour j’te retrouverai
Si seulement juste un instant le Ciel pouvait
Remonter le temps et que je redevienne enfant
Oui juste une seconde, auprès de toi Maman
Tu es le plus joli souvenir que possède ma mémoire
Tu fais et feras toujours partie de mon histoire
Tu seras avec moi, où que j’aille, où que je sois
Petite Maman je pense à toi

Mama je sais que tu es là quelque part
Je sais que tu m’entends, et que tu peux me voir
Écoute mon poème, ma reine

Depuis que tu es partie, ça n’est plus pareil
Il manque le plus joli rayon à mon soleil
Maman je t’aime, je ne t’oublie pas

Ma reine est partie, elle a rejoint les cieux
Oui le Ciel a repris la prunelle de mes yeux
Mon cœur est malade, et la pleure dans ses louanges
Ma reine s’en est allée, elle a rejoint les anges
Que ton âme repose en paix, Maman je te promets
Tu seras toujours la première dame de mon palais
Tu m’as donné la vie, tu t’es toujours battue pour moi
Je te remercie, j’ai tant d’respect pour toi

Rares sont ceux qui

Et ceux qui vont mal parler

Le pouce ou le majeur, dis-moi qui marche avec toi

J’ai croisé des loups, pas mal de morpions
J’ai croisé des serpents, écrasé des scorpions
Mieux vaut marcher seul que d’être mal accompagné
Avec le temps crois-moi, j’ai appris à sélectionner
J’ai du filtrer, j’ai du faire le tri
J’ai ouvert les yeux, Maman j’ai compris
Je n’ai pas besoin d’une meute

Blacko,"La vie ne tient qu’à un fil
Sur lequel je cherche l’équilibre
Elle n’est pas un long fleuve tranquille
Dès la naissance c’est un combat qui se livre
Vivre c’est apprendre
Être libre c’est comprendre
Qu’il n’y’a que la foi qui délivre
Personne n’est parfait
Des mauvais choix j’en ai fait
Je sais, j’en ai conscience
Mais je ne vis pas dans le regret

On est tous à la quête du bonheur
On cherche tous une vie meilleure
On oublie souvent
Que la richesse première est intérieure

À moi d’écouter mon cœur
Je sais que Babylone fera tout
Pour m’induire en erreur
Si j’veux rester solide
J’dois continuer à aimer
Garder l’esprit lucide

Sans attendre qu’on te donne
Donne le meilleur de ta personne
Bon est celui qui pardonne

Libère ta conscience
Fais confiance à tes sens

Te fie pas aux apparences

Dans un univers immense

Et si Dieu veut je l’obtiendrai
Mon âme danse sur un fil
Et si Dieu veut je tiendrai

Les marmots, tu connais les histoires
C'est une triste réalité
Mais dur de subsister dans leur matrice sans gent-ar

Dans ce système, si t'as pas d'oseille
T'es considéré comme un paria
Faut posséder monts et merveilles
Tout le monde veut le champagne et le caviar
Mener une vie loin du besoin
On pense que l'argent est une sûreté
Faut faire des thunes par n'importe quel moyen
Pour se sentir en sécurité
C'est la course aux billets violets
Tout le monde cherche à faire fortune
On a tous, dans la tête, des projets
Mais, pour les réaliser, il faut des thunes
Alors obligés de charbonner
En règle ou de manière l'illicite
Faire le taf pour que l'oseille rentre
À Babylone, tout est question de fric

Et nous sommes beaucoup de soldats
Prendre des sous, assurer nos arrières
Réussir à mettre bien nos 'milles-fa'
Quand le compte est blindé
C'est sûr, ça va forcément mieux
On vise la retraite anticipée
Car on ne vivra pas tous forcément vieux

Sans caillasse, c'est la hess
Et, la hess, elle se fait constante
On ressent une tension
Lorsqu'elle se fait rare ou absente
D'une manière ou d'une autre
Faudra se lever pour aller la chercher
Nous sommes tous esclaves de l'argent
Tous esclaves de nos porte-monnaie

L'argent ne fait pas l'bonheur
Mais, sans, tu t'sens vite dans la merde
Paraît qu'il n'a pas d'odeur
Mais il couvre le parfum des emmerdes
Quand tu es sur la paille
Tu te retrouves vite fait sur les nerfs
Obligé, faut faire rentrer la maille
Être toujours sur le pied d'guerre
Je sais très bien qu'je partirai sans

Au fait, moi, c'est Blacko, oui, si si, tu connais

Que rien n'a changé, qu'j'suis resté dans la même optique

La partie n'est pas finie, faut continuer d'aller de l'avant
J'ai encore une dernière carte à jouer

J'allais pas laisser tout tomber vu le chemin que j'ai fait
Autant aller jusqu'au bout

Qu'on leur donne un baye lourd, qu'on écrase les corps
Qu'on explose le truc, viens, on leur troue l'ul-c bien fort

Reminisce about the past
As we held each other's hand and we took our first dance
Even at the start I knew, the only one I'll ever love is you baby
I remember when we both told each other these three words
I love you, oh yeah

My whole world, I gave it all to you
Because of the love that we've shared

But let's tell 'em 'bout the happy days

You made all my dreams come true
Like when you told me that you're having my baby
This miracle creates a stronger bond
And it's so beautiful the way our love grows

Now it's time to take it a little further
Will you say 'I do'? I'll take care of you
Forever and ever baby, you know that this takes two
So tell me what would I do without you
I can't stop thinking 'bout the past

It was about who can hit the more punani before the summer

Just when you think love's about to end
That's when you find a new beginning
It's a part of life

You wonder why you go all through a change
Why it seemed like things never go your way
Girl, i know how it feels to be alone
'cause i been there before
At the bottom alone
I know the way to reach the top
You got to let go
I've been insecure
You'll come around
And you'll be alright

Gotta take these records off the shelf
Play something special for yourself

Gotta leave your troubles far behind
Or just enough to ease your mind

I can't, get you out of my mind
Your love is, one of a kind
You've given so much of yourself
I swear, don't want nobody else

Baby don't you know that I'll do anything for you
I'll give you my time, give you my heart
Give you the world if you want me to
Life hasn't been easy
Knowing that you love somebody else
Ain't nothing I can do about it
All I have to blame is myself, and I can't

I thought I had you fooled
With the girls and the things that I was putting down
But little did I know
Miss Thang was spreading business all over town
I don't know what she told you
But I bounced upon the love one time
I took her to my house, laid her on the couch
Set it affray, then threw her ass out

So what about the girl in the 6-4
She didn't mean a damn thing to me baby
She needed a ride from the jam
And being the man that I am, I said ""you can""
And what about the girl in the drop-top
With the lollipop, at the light, by the bus stop
You musta beel fooled into thinkin the kid was slack
Girl I did my thing, but now I want my baby back
Girl I can't

[Chorus]

Damn, just picked the wrong time to mess up
From the time you left me, up until this moment
I just couldn't get you off my mind
But I know if we could start all over again
I know things won't be the same
I can make it better, I swear, I swear

This is mark
I'm not in right now
So leave a message
And I'll get back to you as soon as possible
Peace

[lucille middleton]
Hello, mark
I know you're not there but
I know that you love the lord
And I remember when you was a little boy
You used to love music
And you loved to just play
And I always knew that you would make it
As long as you sticked with the lord
'cause God is here to do the things that fail
And I knew he have all power, he's peace
And I knew that you would do good
With your new group
So I'm prayin' for you and your group
That I know that god'll always will bless you
As long as you keep your head in his hands

Eric
There is one thing I would like to say to you
Wherever you go
Whatever you do
Whatever you say
Remember to put God first
And I know one day
You will be back home
After you finish sayin' this rock and roll

[mildred riley]
Teddy
You came a long way
You went the wrong way
But then God see fit to put in my heart
To bring you back the right way
And to tell you the right things to do
And so far, you have prospered through your music
Because you been playin' music for a long time
And you played all the way through church
I always tell you that god
Was gonna bless you one day
And God have blessed you
He have blessed you with sound and music
Through your heart, through your finger
Through your mind
And through the love that you share with other people
And it only come from being well mannered
And respect
And regardless of what song you sing
You can sing gospel, you can sing rock and roll
God gave you that song to sing
And every song he gave you so far
It became a hit
And you've been blessed with these songs
So you keep on singing these songs
And you keep on praisin' the lord
And for each thing that you do
You thank him
Because without god, you can't do nothing

[ada mckenzie]
Chauncey
I want you to thank god
For where God has brought you from
He has brought you from a mighty long way
You has been born with a special gift with a message
And I don't want you to forget
Where God has brought you from
You has been singing ever since you was a little boy
By listening to sounds of music as a baby
And listening to a reecord player
You would pick up the sound and repeat what you hear
At that time, we noticed that you had a gift by god
But you been through a hard time struggling
Through your career
But you kept pressin' on
You never gave up on your dream
And I thank God for the effort that you have made
You have been obedient
You have been singing in the church at an early age
And you have been honoring your parents for a long time
And you have learned how to respect people
But I want you to continue to do that
Don't never forget where you came from
And don't never forget what your father have taught you
He have taught you how to attend church on Sunday morning
And how to treat your brothers and sisters
And he have taught you how to share with people
I want you to always remember that God loves you
And I love you too
Always remember to do good
Do right and be great
And the lord will bless you
Because the lord is real

[blackstreet]
Amen, I truly do think the lord is real
And I think you know, if it wasn't for him
We wouldn't be where we at today
We wouldn't be able to do any singing, anything
So I think it's about time for us
To give unto the lord
It's time to make that change
And we gotta do it now

That's right
Because the lord is real
Let's go

Breasts said yes, give me more wet kisses, uh
Twist my body like the Excorist, hey
The way he licked his lips he was mackin
True thug passion, I'm like, ""Slow down before you crashin""
Never mind him, he ain't thinkin 'bout you
Or the way we sex, on the villa up in Malibu
Marry who? Daddy please
I'm takin it all from the stash to the keys
So let me see, boo I'm bout to dead my mans for you
When it's all said and done I got plans for you
He said (oh baby)

Ooh baby, I need you want you in my life
Gotta get you home with me tonight
Gotta get you home with me tonigh-iyiight (uh-oh, uh-oh)
Ooh baby, baby I need you
Gotta get you home with me tonight
Right here

Grabbed me by the hand and led the way
Outside of the club talkin to Valet
Mind started to stray, million miles away
Contemplatin goin back to his crib to par-lay
Jumped in the passenger seat, relaxed my feet
As he threw on Blacksteet casually
And we cruised the metro, on premium petrol
I sized up my thighs and couldn't let go
Ta-ta's perkin, You're Makin Me High
Like Toni, work me, take me I'm hot
I thought for a second and then my mind went
Sex all around the car, isn't it ironic?
Back to Reality, the Soul II Soul
Breathin heavily but still in control
Wants the shy girl role, put my hand on his leg
With sex in his eyes, he turned and then he said

Tonight baby
Ooh baby, c'mon c'mon Foxy c'mon
Gotta get you home with me tonight
Whatever you want me to do (uh oh, uh oh)
Ooh baby, do it for you baby
I need it in my life
Gotta get you home with me tonight
Ay I, ooh baby, gotta get you home tonight
Gotta get you home with me tonight, ooh baby",Get Me Home,1996
Blackstreet,"Hey, here comes Sherry
What's up with her and her homeboy?
Don't know, man
One minute they're kicking and one minute they're not
I know what it's gonna take
What? That one kiss goodnight, that's it

1-Before I let you go, before I let you go
  Can I get a kiss, goodnight, baby  (2)

Baby(rpt 1, 1)

Lately, I've been thinking something's going wrong
'Cause you got an attitude
And you're not in the mood like you used to
Girl, I can feel it when I hold you in my arms
The feeling is not the same
Can I be the one to blame?

2-I don't want to lose your love, mmm
  I don't want to say bye-bye, oh no no

True love is so hard to find
And it's right between your lips and mine, and mine
(rpt 1, 1)

Turn the lights down low
Let's take it nice and slow
My mission is to keep you mine
Don't want this to be the last time
We make sweet love
Baby, I know you feel it, too
It's bigger than the both of us
There's one thing I'm so certain of
(rpt 2)

It's always the little things, I remember
And I can't just let it slip away
Slip away  (rpt 1)

Teddy, won't you play the music for me
Teddy, won't you play Backstreet side?
Baby I get so lonely
Sometimes, I...
Baby my heart is broken sometimes
I need you right now, I don't...
I can't let you slip away, slip away
(rpt 1)     

I don't see it being a problem
If I just get one little bitty kiss baby...
I just can't let you get away, oh yeah...
Lord, have mercy...
I don't want lose your sweet love
So don't say good-bye, say good-night

And made me love once more

Keeps shining down on me,

Why life around and wit one kiss she set me free

Now that joy has taken over, 
And decided to stay

Just look what she's done for me, 
Just erased all the sadness away, oh oh oh,

Take me there. Let's go there
Take me to that great place with wonders and wishes
Take me there, I want to go there
Take me there. You know where
Just take me to that great place with wonders and wishes

Sittin here thinkin bout yesterday
About what we did and how we used to play
Just the thought of you brings a smile upon my face
That's how it makes me feel to see you everyday
Where we go, nobody knows
And what we do, is between me and you
So c'mon and take my hand, to that special place
Where smiles come to life and dreams come true

Let's make a wish
Close your eyes and count to five
'Cause you know that everything will be alright
I see the magic in your eyes
You're strong enough I know
To bring your dreams to life
Where we go, nobody knows
And what we do, is between me and you
So c'mon and take my hand, to that special place
I don't want this dream to ever go away

Now angelica's the one with all the exposure
Dil is the one who drop in the stroller
Tommy got the whole world on his shoulders
And dil cries to sleep
Til' his eyes get bleak
I'm identical to chuckie, chuckie to petro
Chuckie get scared, chuckie says ""let's go""
If I was a rugrat, it would've been so real
Me and my twin would've been just like phil and lil

And with one wish, blink grant you one trip
Where we goin, it's an adventure, who you want to come with
See you're my little brother that I'll come get
Run with, but it's gotta be done quick
Yo chucky is scared and tommy is sad
And Phil and Lil misses their mom and dad
So take the time of day
And we'll find the place
And I guarantee that we will all get home safe

Louie the 13, no more Cris tonight
Gold to me is like Superman and Kryptonite
So I pray how I don't miss my flight, switch to night
Get out the plane, it look all strange
See a man from Spain, holding up my name
Give him my things and head down to bag' claim
And I hear somebody scream my name

So I look back, look once, look twice
Look fast, look left, look right
Look Blink, look Meeno, look Myse
They try tell me honey don't look right

So I said, 'What the fuck, stand here and give me luck'
And she whispered in my ear
A purple one on there and put a pink one on there
I did just that and gave Hud a stack, shout 'I'll be right back'

Hit so many girls, and spent so many faces

She's back in town, this time we get it on

Had I known you'd treat me this way 
We'd have to swing the shower so, another day, baby 
This was your night, ringers off, beepers off 
My shit was tight, you blew it baby, word is born 
And after all I've done for you 
You messed around and blew the best thing that ever happened to you, baby

Now don't go and put this all on me 
Since I left town, you've been tryin' to run down 
On every girl you see 
I can't believe you do this to me, ooo, baby 
I know about your friend with the red Benz (say what?) 
Now why you want to go and a play a game you can't win? 
You didn't know she was my best friend (DAMN!)

You know you and I've been through many hardships in life 
They say people who believe, hardship has made us doubt 
The very God of gods 
But the apostle Paul said in his scripture 

We are troubled on every side, yet not in distressed 
We are perplexed but not in despair 
Persecuted but not forsaken 
Cast down but we are never distroyed 

And the conclusion of the whole matter is that 
Finally the storm is over 
It's time for us to reap what we have sewn 
No doubt my brothers and sisters 

God has given us a miracle, finally

It's time to give and praise and bless the Lord 
If you believe in miracles, just you wait and see 
'Cause finally we'll make it through it all 

Bless the Lord 
Bless the Lord 
'Cause finally we'll make it through it all

We've had our ups and downs 
Sometimes there no way out, I know He's there 
To lead me and guide me every step of the way, yeah 
Your grace, my joy, constant friend indeed 

Everything that I do, I owe it all to you 
I bless your name

Blackstreet,"My soul is so dirty 
I've been hustlin' everyday 
Now I know that I should pray 
But I wonder if He hear what I'd say 

I know my momma didn't raise me this way 
But I gotta feed my family 
If I could just make it through one more day 
I could live the right way 

Lord, you know it's been 12-15 years I've been in the game 
The way I live this life, forgive me, I know it's a shame 
But who'd a thought I'd make it this far 
From all the brothers and others that I've lost 
I know I'm fortunate not to be one of those souls you choose 
And I'm sorry for the ones I sent 
Down here is to live or die, what was I suppose to do? 
You know I wasn't quite ready 
For this soul of mine to come before you 

My soul is so dirty 
I've been hustlin' everyday 
Now I know that I should pray 
But I wonder if He hear what I'd say 

I know I may not have been right but I've been fair 
I guess that's why you saw it to keep me here 
You must have somethin' better for me 
Just give me a sign Lord, please show me 
Just want to thank you for the ones you've placed 
I pray you watched over them, 'cause you watched over me 
Until you clean us up Lord, like we should be 
I know you will eventually 

My soul is so dirty 
I've been hustlin' everyday 
Now I know that I should pray 
But I wonder if He hear what I'd say 

Please watch over my babies and they mommas, too 
'Cause they don't know what they daddy do 
But this one thing, I promise you 
I won't let my seeds do the same thing, too 
Lord, bless my momma, you know how much she means to me 
Despite the way I live, I know she still loves me 
She's up in church, cryin' and prayin' for me 
And I'mma try to see her there on Sunday, I said maybe

Just don't cry

Listen 

Ah yeah 

Just wanted to talk to you 

I'm sorry 



Just when you think you're strong enough 

Temptation raises its head 

'cause I kept on thinking 

That I got a good woman back home 

But I didn't regret it 

Til it was over (what should I do?) 

I shoulda never told (you were untrue) 

How could I let it show? 



That girl put a spell on me 

I couldn't stop thinking about it 

But I've got my lady 

That I can't live without 



(Chorus): 

If you look into my eyes, it says I'm sorry 

I didn't mean to hurt and ever make you cry 

I know I've got a good thing, girl 

So don't you worry (no, no, no, no) 

I'd go outta my way to keep you satisfied 



We've got a future, I don't move along 

I know it's easier said than done 

But don't let this one mistake 

Put a break on what we make 

Please forgive me 

I'm so sorry

When I realized that I love you so much 
That sometimes I cry, but I cant tell you why 
why I feel what I feel inside 

How I try to express what's been jugglin' my mind 
But still can't find the words 
But I know that something's got a hold of me 

It came over me in a rush 
When I realized that I love you so much 
That sometimes I cry, but I cant tell you why 
why I feel what I feel inside

Baby, some day I'll find a way to say 
just what you mean to me 
But if that day never comes along 
and you don't hear this song 
I guess you'll never know that... 

It came over me in a rush 
When I realized that I love you so much 
That sometimes I cry, but I cant tell you why 
why I feel what I feel inside

And when I say inside, I mean deep 
You fill my soul with something I cannot explain 
What's over me 

It came over me in a rush 
When I realized that I love you so much 
That sometimes I cry, but I cant tell you why 
why I feel what I feel inside

Goin' to Blackstreet so I can pick up my plaque 

What you need me to bring back? 
Mil, platinum earrings and silk 
Gucci towers for the Cristal 
Just a few acres so your dream house can get built 

Well, I got that

And put your pretty ass up in the drop

Baby, you're all I want
Baby, you're all I need
Hold on tight till we get it right
Can't let go, we got to keep it tight

Baby, you're all I want
Baby, you're all I need
You're too close to do just to let it go
You need to stop flippin', girl, I love you so

Now I messed up
Give me one more chance
I know you had enough
It was never in the plans to hurt you

I never meant to do you wrong
But then this shorty came along
And yo, her vibe was strong, so I hit it

It was one too many times I admit it
If you can find it in your heart to forget it
Baby, just forgive me
Love, you're the only one I want, the one I'm thinkin' of

Baby, you're all I want
Baby, you're all I need
Hold on tight till we get it right
Can't let go, we got to keep it tight

Baby, you're all I want
Baby, you're all I need
You're too close to do just to let it go
You need to stop flippin', girl, I love you so

Time and time again I know I played myself
But I had my thoughts of losin' you, no, baby
You best believe I'm in love with you
All I need, no one else will do
Girl, it's true, I'm so in love with you, girl

Baby, you're all I want
Baby, you're all I need
Hold on tight till we get it right
Can't let go, we got to keep it tight

Baby, you're all I want
Baby, you're all I need
You're too close to do just to let it go
You need to stop flippin', girl, I love you so

Baby, you're all I want
Baby, you're all I need
Hold on tight till we get it right
Can't let go, we got to keep it tight

Baby, you're all I want
Baby, you're all I need
You're too close to do just to let it go
You need to stop flippin', girl, I love you so

Ma, I hope you feel me
I know you love me and I love you too
It's like the street game, I can't get out of you
And you can't get out of me too
So let's just do the damn thing, you feel me? I'm out
",Baby You're All I Want,2003
Blackstreet,"As you pack your things to leave again
I feel it, wanting you to change your mind
Or maybe it's good that you go tonight
There have been many times before but somehow
We find reason why we shouldn't go our separate ways
Then go and cause eachother pain
This can really be the end, how do I erase
All of this love I have inside, I can't bare to see you cry
And as the door began to close on us
Do I just sit and let you go
Or do I call out for you
I'm so confused, tell me what to do

Chorus:
It's so hard to say goodbye
Dry your eyes
(Girl I love you so)
It's so hard to say goodbye
Girl don't cry
'cause baby girl you don't have to leave, no

I didn't mean to waste your time
But I've known for quite a while you weren't happy
With me and I've had days I wanted to leave
But to think about one day or one night without you
Baby it's the fear of losing love
The kind of love that you need so much
I know you will be alright, you'll be fine
Get a new man someone who helps you live all your fantasies
But girl I don't it's me
Before you go can I hold you
Wipe away your tears, console you
Make you know that my love was true
It's so hard baby saying goodbye to you

{CHORUS}

How could you just look me in the eye
Forgetting about all the things that were right
How could you just let me go when you know
(All this love I had for you)
All of the promises we made
The good and the bad, we vowed that we'd stay
You would have known that I didn't want to go
(If you had taken the time to just REALIZE)?
But you just let me leave baby

{CHORUS}

Hey ma I know you don't understand me and the things that I do
But I think its victory for us if we can just hold on
Lets keep this thing strong
I love you and I know you love me too
And I want to spend the rest of my life with you
That's my word!

verse 1
From the projects in bk all the way down to the villa copped in va
Lets not forget bout the 30 foot doc in the bay
With keys of your own for when you want to take it out to play
Now you want to flip the script
Your friends got you talkin real slick

Running wild and free
In a concrete jungle
Filled with misery.
There's no inspiration
To brighten up their day.

Wild with desperation

Children of the ghetto
Keep your heads
Keep your heads
To the sky.

Children of the ghetto,
Always in the news.
Talk less is their motto
And bitter are their blues.
Deep inside the ghetto
There's a unity,
Counsels of the sorrow
And the misery.

Blackwood Brothers Quartet,"Amazing Grace ! How sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me! 
I once was lost, but now am found.
Was blind but now I see.

In evil long I took delight,
Unawed by shame or fear
Till a new object met my sight,
And stopped my wild career.

3. I saw one hanging on a tree,
In agonies and blood
Who fixed his languid eyes on me,
As near his cross I stood.

4. Sure, ne’er until my latest breath,
Can I forget that look
It seemed to change me with his death,
Though not a word He spoke.

5. My conscience felt and owned the guilt,
And plunged me in despair
I saw my sins his blood had shed
And helped to nail Him there.

6.Alas, I knew not what I did,
But all my tears were vain;
Where could my trembling soul be hid,
For I the LORD had slain.

7. A second look He gave that said;
“I freely all forgive” !
This blood is for my ramson paid,
“I died that thou mayest live.”

8. Twas Grace that taught my heart to fear,
And Grace my fears relieved
How precious did that Grace appear,
The hour I first believed.

9. Through many dangers,toils and snares,
I have already come;
Tis Grace hath bro’t me safe thus far,
And Grace will lead me home.

The Lord has promised good to me,
His word my hope secures;
His will my shield and portion be,
As long as life endures.

Yes! when this flesh and heart shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess within the vail,
A life of joy and peace.

12. The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,
The sun forbear to shine;
But GOD who called me here below,
Shall be forever mine.

13. When we’ve been there ten thousand years,
Bright shining as the sun
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise,
Than when we first begun!",Amazing Grace,

You're the oldest boy Bill so teach your brothers right
Then she handed me her Bible said follow by its light
(Mama's Bible pages trimmed with gold Mama's Bible guiding our soul)

Blackwood Brothers Quartet,"Many years ago in days of childhood I used to play till evening shadows come
Then winding down an old familiar pathway I heard my mother call at set of sun
(Come home come home it's suppertime the shadows lengthen fast
Come home come home it's suppertime we're going home at last)

You know some of the fondest memories of my childhood were woven around suppertime
When my mother used to call from the backsteps of the old homeplace
Come on home now son it's suppertime
Oh gee but I'd love to hear that once again
But you know for me time has woven a realization of a truth that's even more thrilling
That's when the call comes from the portasls of glory
And we'll gather round the table with the Lord himself
At the greatest suppertime of them all
(Come home come home it's suppertime we're going home at last)

When these things beset us he doesn't forget us

He sends down his love on the wings of a dove)
On the wings of a snow white dove...

Troubles he had some but wasn't forgotten he sent him his love on the wings of a dove

Blaenavon,"Is there what you're worth?
Or shot in the dark from the corner of the past
You wondered why I lied to you the night you came into my room

One will settle the nerves, or take the edge off 
I've only got so many left to lose, 
I'll pick and choose

My bark is your bite, it cuts like a knife when I lie 
Because, the mind says it's the best thing to do, for you
My mind says it's the best thing to do, for you, 
My mind says it's the best thing to do

Is it what cigarettes do?
Doubt the price of your thoughts in the corner of your skull
And you wondered why I took my time to throw my arms around you

Nobody wants to love, 
To carry the burden or balance the glass 
With each and every move, I'll pick and choose

My bark is your bite, but time after time, I lie 
Because the mind says it's the best thing to do, for you
My mind says it's the best thing to do, for you, 
My mind says it's the best thing to do

My bark is your bite, 
It's like kind of right, 
But I lie because the mind says it's the best thing to do

So I'll take one more chance, I'll dance if you'll dance
I'll try because, the mind says it's the best thing do

And I've gotta hear the same sermon all the time, now from you people

Just because you came across it and lost it?

Blaenavon Male Voice Choir,"There was a man, a lonely man
Who lost his love through his indifference
A heart that cared, that went unchecked
Until it died in his silence

And solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him, takes him down
And by himself, it's easy to pretend
He'll never love again

And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire

Another day, a lonely day
So much to say that goes unspoken
And through the night, his sleepless nights
His eyes are closed, his heart is broken

And solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him, takes him down
And by himself it's easy to pretend
She's coming back again

And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire

A little hope, goes up in smoke
Just how it goes, goes without saying

And by himself it's easy to pretend

Surged most preferred from the verbs and words 
I finesse, try your best
to diagnose, when I host,
you get roast, toast
Bet grip bra when I rumble, you crumble
My stuff is good like mo jungle soup
Rappers getting soup front and rugged 
but i don't plug it, when my sematic hits to your nugget
and expose, you know how it goes when it be pretty
when we roll is like we got the key to the sitty
it won't be pretty, 
for you to challenge, knock you off balance
betta reconsider your talents
You weasel, you better off pumpin diesel
I find it feasible your days is over frontin evil
Shouting to your people triing to bless your spot
but we don't believe that 'cause CBS tells a lot
on who got shot and who does all the crime
DANGER! And you knew it all the time

Chorus:
When the East is in the house, Oh my God!
DANGER!

And when we in the house, ain't no time to act sheisty
come out a spicey to your ass that is pricely
cosin', you get baked like Mr. Braustin
Beans in box, you need more strength than just locks 
I rocks hardcore even when I dress suited
On some business shit my street is deep rooted
What is this shit?
Rappers want to blossom, put they all a costume
Toking weed buffoon I'll tell you soon you learn the hard way
Tims and blunts going Broadway throught this theater
hardrocks is getting witter like virrer
for Alles the East is in your parlor 
on some proper shit and it will never be the opposite

Chorus

And when we move on your circuit
You better pray to who you worship
Das recommended ass kicks come splendid
Long winded but I don't need my respiratory
to bless my story, you got nothing for me
Ace been ploted behind doors they skeemin' up
For my arrival, rappers are teamin' up
Do your stuff finize is going to be limpin' MC's 
when I plan my rap you be left handicap
Sweat! gather because I break you no Jalope
Building all heads that be older than your papi
Pack the wind while PF backspin
to the essence, you get scarred to my presence",Danger,1996
Blahzay Blahzay,"We'd like to dedicate this particular tune
to all to all to all the hell of ya from wherever

[Channel Live] But there's only weak rappers steady making hits, fuck that!

Verse One:

I drop clarity like kerotene, everytime I speak out
Rappers freak out, but never stick their necks too deep out
and touch the live wire, gettin live like from gaya inner
Jim Jones cool-aid you got mad reason to be afraid
You ain't ready, rappers are petty, never lyrical
It's a miracle they need to reign as they physical
to get blessed, East vs. West, we never on that
Cause the rugged format you can get from where you're born at
So learn this, to burn this, you gotta earn this
with your rap style be the firmest, forget about your color of epidermis
for advantages, there's bandages, whatever your language is
You be in Danger like that Blahzay triangle is
The Blah pre your mind freein
Not the fatigue wearin jewels glarin rapper, you used to seein
Absestos study lessions to make impressions
The P's come and squeal on the real I'm mad excited
I got my deal but still...

Chorus:

You don't know the pain I feel
  But there's all these weak rappers steady making hits, fuck that!
'cause 'cause 'cause you don't know the pain I feel
  But there's all these weak, rappers, steady making hits
You don't know the pain I feel
  But there's all these weak rappers steady making hits, fuck that!
'cause 'cause 'cause you, 'cause, 'cause you don't know the pain I feel
  But there's all these weak, rappers, steady making hits

Verse Two:

Now everybody lamp go ahead get amped for your camp
Without no harmony your Normandy will never be the champ
And let me mention, no racial tension the way the rule goes
I flows with bros, PF flows with papa chulos
We combine cluster, you can't muster break your ligaments
Building my predicaments, living with the immigrants
See special blow your vest or do it thorough
That's blurro, my referral don't try to rally up your borough
Just warm, stay calm if you don't got steel in your palm
you'll peel me, I'm top rank I got more lines than the Yanks
uni-form, carry on screamin on MC's
Running around together only bonded by smoking trees
Chronic, my tonic make you vomit for teamin up
Bringin the drama, be blank comma blank comma
Read it, singers get weeded, then conceeded
But you don't know the pain
So watch how you feed it to me

Chorus

Verse Three:

Comin with with the raw tech, strong like Gortex
Rappers get more plex, as they make their name off all fetch
and unrealistic, your neighbor crew know you're ballistic
Your statistic ain't mistic, under that talk we know who is it
So stay busy, keep touring
Your hood is roaring, it's not a place for pussycats to be exploring
Your plan lock it, you bandwagon just to start a rival
Without skills you better check for your own survival
And feel the pain rappers talk a good John Wayne but look stupid
You be trying to play us like a groupie
With your rap staff you riff and raff
I listen and laugh, in town you down out of town you get sent ass
And you don't know the pain...

He called me his son and I called him dad
He was like no friend that I had ever had
He taught me how to drive a nail and build a go-cart
And how to love a woman with all of my heart
And one night we watched him get down on one knee
And ask mama to be his wife, and he asked me...

To be the best man and I stood by his side
As he lifted the veil of that beautiful bride
He said I do, then she did too
And she walked back down the aisle holding hands

I remember just like yesterday
Off a footloose you lad ran off with the circus
Much to his mama's dismay
He was cleaning up after the elephants
When the highflying trapeze girl smiled down
In search of a handsome companion because
She had just broken up with a clown
With one graceful aerial flip he was smitten
With her and her little tutu
Standing there love struck he almost stumbled
Into the elephants doing their tricks
And the ringmaster smiled tipped his top hat and said
Son bid adieu to your heart
And his words rand true right there under the bleachers
Soon after that big top went dark
Now the old bearded lady whispered be careful
On the train to the very next town
And the handful of midgets who rode unicycles
Peddled by with one smile and four frowns
So he had a vague sense of uneasiness when
His new sweetheart openned her door
And he knew when he saw the clown standing behind her
In front of her there stood one more
Now I can't tell you if it was Barnum or Bailey
To whom I handed the note
But a tall skinny fella standing on stilts
First read the words that I wrote
It said ""Promise I'll never again give my heart
To a high-flying trapeze girl

No cheap hotel where we'll check-in
No other lives we'll be wrecking with alibis
To hide a cheaters kiss
Cause if there's lipstick on my collar
You can bet your bottom dollar
It's the color she wears on nights like this
And every Friday here at five
We try to keep the fire alive

Cause I'm in love with a married woman
And I don't care, I don't care who knows it
Yes, I'm in love with a married woman
And on her left hand there's a wedding band
She wears faithfully
And I thank God, I thank God
I thank God she's married to me",I'm in Love with a Married Woman,2006
Blaine Larsen,"It was Sunday Afternoon
I was sunk in my recliner
Football game was one
Tampa Bay in Carolina
I wasn't paying much attention
Volume down, not watching it at all

This house is like an icebox
Had all the curtains drawn
Had it more like a hotel room
And less like a home
Been so quite around here lately
I wasn't thinking anyone would call

Let alone you, all the way from Dallas
Out of the blue, saying that you missed us
And time and distance made you see
You were lost without me
How did you know I'd finally hit the bottom
An all-time low was suddenly forgotten
The sound of your voice on the line
Made fate turn circles on a dime
Just when I thought I'd never find somebody new
Let alone you

Now here I am at the baggage claim
A nervous wreck waiting on your plane
Wringing my hands, checking my watch
Never dreamed forty-eight hours ago
I'd be standing here waiting on anyone
No not anyone

Let alone you, all the way from Dallas
Out of the blue, saying that you missed us
And time and distance made you see
You were lost without me
How did you know I'd finally hit the bottom
An all-time low was suddenly forgotten
The sound of your voice on the line
Made fate turn circles on a dime
Just when I thought I'd never find somebody new
Let alone you

Let alone you",Let Alone You,2006
Blaine Larsen,"I'm all right now, I've got a new place to live
A one room apartment out on West 35th
No, I don't miss her and I've finally moved on
And I've found a companion that won't do me wrong

Oh, the lips of a bottle, don't have to say ""I love you""
Don't have to whisper my name the tender way she used to
Oh, I've got a new love to fill my emptiness
But from the lips of a bottle I'll steal one more kiss

I don't care if the label reads whisky or wine
Here at my bedside well, it eases my mind
They're just stolen moments this habit I'm on
Heaven forgive me, I can't leave it alone

Cause the lips of a bottle, don't have to say ""I love you""
Don't have to whisper my name the tender way he used to
Hey, I've got a new love to fill my emptiness
So from the lips of a bottle I'll steal one more kiss
From the lips of a bottle I'll steal one more kiss
",Lips of a Bottle,2006
Blaine Larsen,"Five hours of football one afternoon
Three nights of poker dragging in past two
Four years of trying to make it last
Even a fool could do the math

No woman is gonna hang around
For some man who can't figure it out
Do the numbers, it all adds up to
No woman, no woman for you

One of seven boxes, one Uhall truck
Three brawny men a'loading it up
One thousand ""I'm sorry's"" ten minutes too late
One fed up girl on the interstate

No woman is gonna hang around
For some man who can't figure it out
Do the numbers, it all adds up to
No woman, no woman for you

[Instrumental Interlude]

Congratulations Einstein
Look at what you've done
You've solved the equation
For two minus one

No woman is gonna hang around
For some man who can't figure it out
Do the numbers, it all adds up to
No woman, no woman for you
No woman, no woman for you

Blaine Larsen,"We grew up in the same town
Three houses down on Magnolia Street
Young love was going strong
Even though your Dad and Mom were sound asleep
A blanket and some moonlight
We'd slip down by the lake
Seventeen and restless
You know we just couldn't wait
And I wish I were rockin you tonight

I remember the day we both cried
You got that full ride to university
You had to do what you had to do
And we both knew it was the end of me
We wrote ""we miss you letters""
Made long distance calls
But I lost you forever halfway through the fall
And I wonder, baby, who's rockin you tonight

And I live for those moments
Wrapped up in your arms
Swaying to the music of those wildly beating
Wildly beating hearts

[Instrumental Interlude]

Gotta a lot of time to think of you
On my way to the next marque sign
With any luck one of these days
You'll see my name, no, I'm doing fine
Every now and then out here on the stage
I look through the flood lights
And I swear I see your face
Feels so good to be rockin you tonight
Yeah, I'm rockin you tonight
I'm rockin you tonight
Baby, I'm rockin you tonight

",Rockin' You Tonight,2006
Blaine Larsen,"There's aluminum cans and cigarettes butts
Lying in the sides of the streets
The baseball field in the County Park
Is buried in a blanket of weeds
There's a swastika sprayed from an aerosol can
Displayed on the overpass
Driving around it's easy to see
This town's going downhill fast

Somebody should do something about it
How hard could it be
Somebody should do something about it
Maybe that someone is me

Followed a couple into Ferguson's Grill
The door swung back in my face
Closed my eyes but I felt the stares
When I bowed my head to say grace
Watched a table of suits stiff the waitress a tip
Like they didn't have a nickel to spare
Walked out into the heat rising off of main street
But I felt a chill in the air

Somebody should do something about it
How hard could it be
Somebody should do something about it
Maybe that someone is me

Now I don't expect this world to be heaven
But it sure could be better
I can sit around complaining
Or stand around waiting
But I might be waiting forever
Forever

How hard could it be
Somebody should do something about it

Blaine Larsen,"Guys are playing pool, long necks in a bucket
Bragging about their luck with the ladies in bed
Laughing when they ask him for all the dirty details
He don't say nothing, just starts shaking his head

[Chorus]
Spoken like a man devoted to a woman
Not just any woman, but the love of his life
Spoken like a man crazy about the feeling
He gets every evening when they turn out the light

Cue behind the eight, he's staring down the table
There's a cutie across the room trying to catch his eye
She walks across the bar with her number on a napkin
He gives it to a buddy with a wink and a smile

[Chorus]

He pays his tab, pulls his keys out of his pocket
The boys say, 'where you going? Just one more game
Give us one good reason why you can't hang.'
Turns at the door and just holds up his ring

[Chorus]

Spoken like a man, spoken like a man
Spoken like a man",Spoken Like a Man,2006
Blaine Larsen,"Did you really think she'd let you in with that bouquet
Welcome you with open arms and say, it's okay
Well, them long stemmed apologies won't work no more
Cause she can't see the beauty just a hand full of thorns

And they don't grow enough roses to undo the damage done
Clouds don't make enough raindrops
And it's too much to expect from the sun
You can shower her in petals but it won't change the fact
They don't grow enough roses to get your woman back

Boy, looks like she finally made you understand
Love can wilt away like the flowers in your hand
Well, honesty might well be your saving grace
But you won't see forgiveness in another pretty face

And they don't grow enough roses to undo the damage done
Clouds don't make enough raindrops
And it's too much to expect from the sun
You can shower her in petals but it won't change the fact
They don't grow enough roses to get your woman back

Now, you can shower her in petals but it won't change the fact
They don't grow enough roses to get your woman back",They Don't Grow Enough Roses,2006
Blaine Larsen,"C'mon hurry, ain't no time for worrying, 
Gotta go, move On 

Just leave the lights on, grab some clothes, 
Set those sights on that four lane road 
I'm Gone 

In a truck, in a train, in a car, in a bus, 
Change my luck, can't stay, going far in a rush, 
Got that getaway feeling 
I'm leavin' 

Trust me, something better's gotta be right around this next turn 
Gonna be just fine, toss the map, don't look behind, push that peddle down, burn

Change my luck, can't stay, going far in a rush, 
Got that getaway feeling

But life got in between
Tried to square not being there

Hold back the river, so I

Blaine Smith,"Well I was there in Memphis
The day after Elvis died
But I never went to Graceland
'Cause I didn't wanna miss my ride
I've been down in Louisiana
Spent a night in New Orleans
But I never did sleep well enough
To dream the American Dream

I flew into New York City
Another face in the crowd
They took me in a limousine
To an office up above the clouds
They say one and one is three
Nothin's as it seems
Well I didn't sleep at all that night
So I missed the American Dream

I drove through a freezin' winter
Through the middle of the great heartland
Spend my nights at truck stops
My days with the country fans
Rollin' on 'til daybreak
Sleeping in my jeans
But I don't think dreamin' of home
Is the American Dream

Well I've been down to Hollywood
Well I've been to LA
Where people shook my hand
While they were looking the other way
Where everyone was dreamin'
Everyone but me
Well I'm sorry
But I don't believe
The American Dream

Hey, hey, get outta my way
I just got back from the USA",The American Dream,2010
