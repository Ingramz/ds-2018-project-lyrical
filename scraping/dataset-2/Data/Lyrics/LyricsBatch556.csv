Kirk Franklin,"While shepherds kept their watching
Over silent flocks by night,
Behold throughout the heavens,
There shone a holy light:
Go, tell it on the mountain,
Over the hills and everywhere;
Go, tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born.

the shepherds feared and trembled
When lo! above the earth
Rang out the angel chorus
That hailed our Saviour's birth:
Go, tell it on the mountain,
Over the hills and everywhere;
Go, tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born.

down in a lowly manger
Our humble Christ was born
And god send us salvation,
That blessed Christmas morn:
Go, tell it on the mountain,
Over the hills and everywhere;
Go, tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born.

when I am a seeker,
I seek both night and day;
I seek the lord to help me,
And he shows me the way:
Go, tell it on the mountain,
Over the hills and everywhere;
Go, tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born.

he made me a watchman
Upon the city wall,
And if I am a Christian,
I am the least of all.
Go, tell it on the mountain,
Over the hills and everywhere;
Go, tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born.",Go Tell It on the Mountain,1995

God, is right there by your side (weeping may endure for a night)
And he told me to tell you everything
(Everything's goin' be alright)

So thank you for calling, it's always good to hear from you
(Yea, but) but I gotta go now
(Wait a minute) I got another call on line 2
(But I ain't through)

See I'm sick and tired of all these church folk
Talking about stuff ain't as bad as it seems
See, why'all don't feel my pain (I don't have pain?)
I don't see how, you on the cover on Time magazine
(See, but you're looking at now and you don't know how I struggled)
(And what I've been through)
Yea, whatever (Now, you crossed the line)
I'm just speakin' my mind (Okay so let me speak mine, too) (Hmmmmmm)
(I've made some mountains, I've seen some valleys)
(I've even had to cry sometimes)
(Like when I lost my mother)
Your mother? (my mother) I'm sorry (No son, that's fine)
(See life is full of ups and downs but God said)
*singer* the storm won't last long
But how'd you make it through? (Boy, I thought you knew)
(It was His) *singer* love that kept me strong

[Chorus Two - T.D Jakes] {Kirk Franklin} (Singer)
When your smile is gone (He cares)
But I feel so alone} (He's there and)
Although, your heart is heavy, God said
(Every burden I will bear)
Yea, but see why'all don't feel (my pain)
And I'm getting very sick and tired of all this} (this rain)
Just got laid off, and to top it off the rent's due
So tell me, Bishop, what I gotta gain?
Didn't I tell you trials come to make (you strong)
And those old storms won't (last long)
How can I trust God in the midst of all this mess?
See that's the reason for this song
Wherever you go there's something ya got to know (God still cares)
(Weeping may endure for a night)
And he told me to tell you
(Everything's gon' be alright)

Thank you pastor (Any time)
I think I can make it now, just tell me what I need to do
(Just pray this prayer with me)

Say Father (Father) forgive me (forgive me)
I'm sorry (I'm sorry) please help me (help me)
I love You (I love You) I need You (I need You)
Hold me (hold me) Jesus (Jesus)
My heart (my heart) my soul (my soul)
Please take (please take) control (control)
Right now (Now) now
(Now) now (now) (right now)

When you ain't got no smile (He cares)
{And even when you feel so alone (He's there and)
Although your heart is heavy, God said
(Every burden I will bear)
And even in the midst of all ya (pain)
And when you're sick and tired of all the rain (this rain)
Remember that the rain won't last always
And in Christ Jesus, you got so much to gain
You see your trials come to make you (strong)
And the storms won't last (too long)
Remember my brother, my sister, it's only temporary
See that's the reason for this song
Wherever you go there's something you've got to know
God is still there (weeping may endure for a night)
And He told me to tell you

Kirk Franklin,"So many different religions
And so many different churches
And if God really loves me
Then why does life keep hurting me?
Have you ever asked any of these questions?
Well my friend I've got the answer just listen

You have the power
To make the seasons change
The river flows for you
The wind whispers Your name
For me you left Your throne
And traded crown for thorns instead
I'm safe within not by Your skin
But because Your blood was red

Some say You're black, you're white
They question if you're real
We treat you like we treat ourselves
I wonder how you feel
To see your children fight in spite
of the tears for us you've shed
Doesn't matter what color you are
As long as your blood was red

For it's strong enough to wash away my sins
And it's pure enough to cleanse me deep within
And it's real enough to find me when I'm lost
Great enough to die upon the cross
It doesn't matter what color you are
As long as your blood was red

We may be different but
The God we serve's the same
Yet every Sunday we separate
And bring the Father pain
Your name is higher than any other
Yet You took my place instead
And now my sins are washed away
Because Your blood was red

For it's strong enough to wash away my sins
And it's pure enough to cleanse me deep within
And it's real enough to find me when I'm lost
Great enough to die upon the cross
It doesn't matter what color you are
As long as your blood was red

Oh precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Doesn't matter what color you are
As long as your blood was red
Doesn't matter what color you are
As you are as long as your blood was red
Doesn't matter what color I am
As long as my blood was red",The Blood Song,2002
Kirk Franklin,"When I close my eyes and think of you
And reminisce on all the things you do
I can't imagine my life without you
It's like paradise now I know that it's real (um)
It's a mystery for someone to give their life just for me
What you did on calvary
Makes me wann love you more

[Chorus]
I never knew I could be so happy
And I never knew I'd be so secure because of your love
Life has brand new meaning
It's gonna be a brighter day, brighter day

Never thought that I would smile again 
I never thought the dark clouds would end
Never thought the dark clouds would end
Never thought that I could have a friend
That would keep me never leave me alone (um)
Jesus you're my everything
The only one that makes my heart sing (heart sing)
Now I know what real love means
It's everlasting, lasting.

Oh, He's gonna call my name (yes)
I'll be caught up in the twinkling of an eye (yes I will)

If my preacher don't go, said I'm going
Oh Lordy, oh Lordy, oh Lordy
I surrender all with a made-up mind
I'm going through, oh, care

So Father, we pray right now that You hear our cries
For peace, for restoration, give us hope right now
Without You we can't make it, we've tried and we're sorry
But we look to the hills, from it cometh our help
'Cause we know our help comes from You

We're gonna hold on, I said we're gonna hold on to You
We're not gonna let go this time, Father
We're gonna trust and have faith, the size of a mustard seed

Kirk Franklin,"Lord, I stand in Your presence
Wanting You and needing You
And I am here and I surrender
All of me so I can see

Your will is where I desire to be
Take all of me
All that I have and all that I do
I give it to You, Lord, it's for You

Just take my hand
And I'll follow You
For all that I am
And all that I do, it's for You

You are my song
It's Your love that keeps me strong
And You are the light
In the darkness of my night

I'm lost without You
Broken without You
Oh, how I need You
Oh, how I need You

You make life worth living
Your grace always keep giving

I'm lost without You
Broken without You
Oh, how I need You
Oh, how I need You

Lord, have mercy, Lord have mercy
Ooh, have mercy
We need Your healing
Please give us healing

Lord, have mercy
Have mercy
Lord, have mercy
Have mercy

Oh Lord, Lord, I come
Broken in this place
Weak and poor
For all I have is Yours, all Yours

This life, these things
They can't compare to You
No wealth, no fame can separate
The one my heart adores

Yet, we take our eyes off You
We're blind in reaching for the truth
And now this whole world cries
Because it realizes

There is none quite like You
The earth, the stars, the universe
They just repeat these words so true

Life begins and life will end with You
Hear me singing

When I die, what will they say about me?
Will the work that I've done
Be enough to help someone?
When I die, will I draw men's hearts to You?

At the setting of the sun
Wanna hear You say
Well done, when I die
Well done, well done

I know He will make me the spirit and the [Incomprehensible]

Kirk Franklin,"If I could I, I'd get away
Far from all this trouble I see everyday
Nobody wants to show their face
This life is like a, like a masquerade
I know you love me
I know you care
But while I'm hurting I just need to know your there
Watching over me and I feel your telling me

Count it all joy and always remember,
Life will get better it's gonna get better
No matter the weapon it will not prosper,
Things will get better it's gonna get better

Persecuted, pushed away, didn't think I'd live to see another day
Cried some tears and couldn't pray and when I'd try at times
I couldn't find the words to say, but now
I'm stronger, because of you without you Jesus I never could've made it through
Thank you for watching me loving me and telling me

Count it all joy and always remember,
Life will get better it's gonna get better
No matter the weapon it will not prosper,
Things will get better it's gonna get better

Count it all joy and always remember,
Life will get better it's gonna get better
No matter the weapon it will not prosper,
Things will get better it's gonna get better

Life sometimes may change and nobody wants to feel pain,
But it came to help you grow and there's one thing you need to know
God's in love with you and he'll never let you go

Count it all joy and always remember,
Life will get better it's gonna get better
No matter the weapon it will not prosper,
Things will get better it's gonna get better

Count it all joy and always remember,
Life will get better it's gonna get better

Kirk Franklin,"The heavens were silent 
The earth weeped in pain 
Nations were trembling and hope never came 
A Terror filled the air 
And it wouldn't go away 
We needed a hero to come and save

Famine and hunger, 
Disease in the land 
The hatred the killing taking lives from your hand 
Creation waits through the darkness we pray 
Tell me where is the hero to come and save

Through the nails 
Through the thorns 
From the hill to the grave
Was a voice in the distance the lamb that was slain 
My soul had no song and my debt I couldn't pay 
When I needed a hero you came and you saved

To the homeless 
The widow 
The fatherless son 
To the sick and the broken alone with no one 
Lift up you head your hope is on the way 
When we needed a hero you came and you saved the day

When the curtain had closed 
And it felt like the end 
When your blood caught the fall and took away every sin 
Even though men deny 
You're the only sacrifice 
That loved us enough you loved us so much Lord 
That you gave your life see you saved my life 

Now I can see you I'm no longer ashamed 
Your power I feel see our lives have exchanged 
Every wrong is erased, Jesus 
You are my hero you came and you saved the day

Kirk Franklin,"My mama gave me up when I was four years old
She didn't destroy my body but she killed my soul
Now it's cold 'cause I'm sleeping in my back seat
Understand the spirit's willing but my flesh is weak
Let me speak, I never had a chance to dream
Ten years old finding love in dirty magazines
Miss December you remember I bought you twice
Now I'm thirty plus and still paying the price
Had a sister that I barely knew
Kind of got separated by the age of two
Same mama different daddy so we couldn't fake it
I saw my sister's daddy beat her in the tub naked
Take it serious the demons in the man's mind
The same daddy with rape charges now he's doing time
Crack followed and like daddy prison thirteen years
Haven't her but she's traded tears for fears


Shout. Shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
So come on
I'm talking to you
So come on

Sex was how I made it through
Without someone to teach you love what else is there to do?
So where I'm from they call you gay and say you ain't a man
Show them you ain't no punk
Get all the girls you can
A simple plan that still haunts me even now today
Back to seventeen and got a baby on the way
No G.E.D. all I see is failure in my eyes
If you listening then remember I apologize
I was raised falling in the church
Made mistakes heard the Lord's calling in the church
After service on the parking lot getting high
Wanted to be accepted so bad I was willing to die
Even tried to tell the pastor but he couldn't see
Years of low self esteem and insecurities
Church taught me how to shout and how to speak in tongues
But preacher teach me how to live now when the tongue is done, help me

See I'm. See I'm
Soul surviver. Soul survivor
World survivor
I just wanna let it go
World survivor, soul survivor
Just wanna let it go

Jesus please on my knees can't you hear my crying
You said to put it in your hands and lord I'm really trying
You wasn't lying when you said you'd reap what you sow
Like that night mama died
Hard to let it go
You adopted me
Cared for me
And changed my name
But I cursed at you
Lied to you
Left your pain
It's not strange I can still see it in my head
To know for hours you were laying in that bed
If you listening to this record,
If it's day our night
If my mama still living treat your mama right
Don't be like me and let that moment slip away
And be careful cause you can't take back what you say
To my real mama if you listening I'm letting it go
To my father I forgive you 'cause you didn't know
The pain was preparation for my destiny
And one more thing lord let my son be a better man than me",Let It Go,2005
Kirk Franklin,"I refuse to be another black statistic
A black man who can wine and dine in the sin of the world and still be considered a christian 
I plan on being great
I care not to be less
I refuse to wear a bar code across my chest 
I refuse to let a black tee or throwback jersey define me
I refuse to let my children witness divorce 
Or make mature decisions in court
I refuse to grow up carrying the generational curse
I refuse to feel the need to curse in my verse
I hate being automatically looked at when someone asks can anyone rap
I wanna be a black man that can flip it from urban to corporate measures 
A black man who doesn't gain knowledge from the world for his own pleasures
A black man who reps Christ to the fullest with no regrets
My only regret is the stigma that many black statistics in the past have set
Like going to jail, bragging about bail, leaving our kids, cussing at church,
Married and you still flirt, no father present at birth
Animosity within the ministers of our church
I refuse to let my people be viewed as temporary
I plan on planting a seed not for the moment but for one that's legendary
As for statistics
My father broke the mode
And I feel its my job for the next generation to continue in it
Because I refuse to be another black statistic",Outro,2005

How can I thank You (how can I show You)

If they only knew (You are the one that gives me the air to breathe)
And see I can't deny that (You're the reason why my life has a melody)
And even when I stray (I still feel your grace pulling me close to You)
So no matter where You are, just know I'm not far (without You what would I do)

Question number three (where would I be)
And Lord not only that but (how could You see)
My days and my nights, the pains of my life
But now it's alright ('cause You worked it out for me)
You gave me a chance (when I had no chance)
When I needed help (You gave me your hand)
So now they need to see (just what You mean to me and if You ever left me (where would I be)

'Cause they never did deserve me
Can you imagine me?
Saying no to thoughts that try to control me
Remembering all you told me
Lord, can you imagine me?
Over what my mama said
And healed from what my daddy did
And I wanna live and not read that page again

Imagine me, being free, trusting you totally, finally I can
Imagine me
I admit it was hard to see
You being in love with someone like me
But finally I can
Imagine me

Being strong
And not letting people break me down
You won't get that joy this time around
Can you imagine me
In a world (in a world) where nobody has to live afraid?
Because of your love, fear's gone away
Can you imagine me?

Letting go of my past
And glad I have another chance
And my heart will dance
'Cause I don't have to read that page again

Imagine me, being free, trusting you totally, finally I can
Imagine me
I admit it was hard to see
You being in love with someone like me

Why He saved a wretch, a wretch like me
And by His blood, I've been redeemed

We shed our blood for what was right
We carried our cross through storm and rain

Let me touch You and see if You are real
Even though, I know my heart Your hands can heal
But sometimes I get discouraged
And I need Your strength and shield, Jesus
Let me touch You and see if You are real

Sometimes to me You seem so far away
And I wonder how to make it through the day
But if I can touch the hem of Your garment
Your power, I know, You can heal, Jesus
Let me touch You and see if You are real

CHORUS
When I'm down
Let me touch You
When I'm lonely
Let me touch You
When I'm discouraged
Let me touch You
Like I never have before
Lord, I need You more and more, Jesus
Let me touch You and see if You are real

Oh, see if You are real

Kirk Franklin,"Persecuted, criticized, been denied and abandoned 
Pushed away, given away, some days I couldn?t imagine 
Getting harder, getting colder, was hard for me to see 
Tired of runnin?, tired of hurtin?, even got tired of me 
Tired of cryin?, tired of tryin? to forget my mistakes 
Tired of bein? in this storm, how much more can I take 
Many nights in my life, tell me why 
I shed more tears, my eyes would allow 
And after all that

Look at me now! 
I?m stronger this time around! 
Not because I was so good, but somehow 
You looked past where I was 
And you knew I?d come through cause You loved me 
Look at me know! 
So many didn?t make it through 
That?s why this heart belongs to only You! 
How can I complain ?bout the pain I went through 
Cause it grew me 
Look at me now! 

Had no hope, had no future, even too hard to dream 
No one told me, ?boy, you can be whatever you want to be? 
Then You saved me and You gave me reason to breathe again 
Not perfect, ya?ll, but I?m gon? run ?til I make it to the end 
(It ain?t easy when your life?s filled with wounds that won?t heal) 
And you fight through the lies trying to find what?s for real 
Everyone wants the prize but they can?t stand the pain 
The strength I needed it came that night I cried out Your name 
To my people in the struggle, all my soldiers and believers 
To my survivors of Rita, Katrina and even FEMA!
(All things are working together for our good)

Yes, I?ve seen some hard times 
Some bad choices that I?ve made fell back on me 
But now it?s time to move on, move on 
Can?t let my past hold down my destiny 
And even though I don?t always know 
Why you allow the night to last so long 
But when I see the sunlight 
It was only to make me strong 

Look at me? 
Look at me? 
Look at me? 
Look at me, look at me

There's a savior who can hear you when you call, when you call
When you cry and you cannot figure out the reasons why
Know that weeping only endures for a night, when you cry

When you fall know that God will never take His love away
He's faithful to His people come what may, hear me say
When you fall

When your heart has been shattered by the storm and torn apart
And you wonder when will the healing ever start for your heart
Don't you know that He loves you too much to ever let you go?
And the storm is there to only help you grow, He loves you so
When you fall

When you fall there are angels there to catch you when you fall
There's a savior who can hear you when you call, when you call
When you cry and you cannot figure out the reasons why

And all you saw a cloudy day

And I remember that day when you surrender
You start turning 'cause you remember
The season it won't last away

You said when will my life get better?
I'm tired of stormy weather
But the sun always shines in day

So just remember
The next time you feel like December
Remember the night in September
When God wiped all your tears away

A ship without a sail
Battered by the raging sea
Taking any love I can to try and stop the rain
While waiting to exhale I finally got on my knees

Do you still remember my name?

Can I go back in time?
Can I have another try?

Not another sleepless night without you Jesus

Every time a wound heals
Something else takes the healing away
But even when I've gone too far

And if it comes back then it's back to stay

No money, no cars, no fame, no lies, no games my life is taken

Now we've come to the break
Tell me what you gone say (you gone say)
I know (I know)
I give my life right
But you know
You ain't promised tonight

Without you
(I can't breathe)
Without you
(I can't exist)
Without you

I'm coming home)

Kirk Franklin,"Toby Mac! (huh!) Turn it up!
Kirk, gonna get his white boy on!
God, I know You up to something (uhhh!) I can see it all right now (woo!) 
You pulling back my covers it's getting crazy (Come on!)

Think I'm gonna walk away
You're messing up my life today (wassup)
This time I refuse to pray
Still you keep calling me (calling me)
I don't wanna see your face
The thing I love you erased (Come on!)
Nothing but an empty space
Now I don't know how to be
I know it wasn't right for me(Yea!)
What you liking what you need
I feel like I'm in surgery
Still you cut deeper

My secrets within
My blanket of sin
Lord how much longer 'till ya through with me
Please take what you need (can I get up now!)

Be still and know I am God
Be still and know I am God

Loving you Lord is my way
Everything you don't explain
Somethings I don't want to change
So you keep breaking me (there you go!)
It's like I'm fighting for my life (woo!)
You hit me with another light
I feel like Jacob in the night
Won't stop 'till you bless me

My flesh and my will (yes father!)
Is yours not to kill (to kill!)
Bringing myself to you (come on!)
But living sacrifice is more (can I get up now)

Be still and know (yea) I am God(gotta know gotta know one more time!)
Be still and know I am God (you are god! you are god! gotta know! gotta know!)
Be still (Be still) and know (and know) I am God (yea!)

If I could I'd fly away from here
But even when I'm far you still are near
I gotta get out (There's no way out)
Where is there to run(There's no where to run)
Don't go(Don't go)
Don't go (Can't go)
No! No! No! (Whoa!)

You win. (uh huh!)
I've been trying to do it on my own. (Yes Lord!)
But right now I gotta surrender
You know what's best (Say it like you mean it!)
It's not easy waiting on you
It's not easy believing that you got this together
But without faith it is impossible to please you (We recognize you!)
So I'm gonna stand right here. (We are still before you!)
You got me. (We are still before you!) You got me You got me

Be still and know (we know!) I am God (We gonna lift those hands I surrender to your authority God! I surrender!)
Be still (we're still!) and know (we know!) I am God (I give you my will)(Gotta know! Gotta! know! Gotta know!)
Be still (I'm yours!) and know (we know!) (I'm yours!) I am God (I'm tired of living on my own! I'm tired of living on my own!)

Short, big nose, big lips
Kinda st- st- stutter but, I never trip
Got my daddy's swagger and I walk with a limp
Got a hot wife, no need to be a pimp

Since I been changed got that twinkle in my eye
Got my grill fixed, now I smile when I speak
Tell me who that is, that's the Jesus freak, it's ya boy

I just smile, I'm so content
And I ain't even got yellow stones on my wrist
I hear the world I'm supposed to be rich
Bud I don't but that, man, I don't go with the trends
Go the whole mile, lose or win
I hope that's the impression that the Cd's give
I'm more concerned about how they see me live
Than trying to get a house on MTV cribs

[Chorus]

When the light fade, I know that you see
More than my swagger, But it's you in me
From the storefront church to the packed out floors
They want an autograph but I'd rather give 'em yours
Ya ink don't fade, the crowd wants more
The king's on stage, the final encore
Can't believe it's, me now I'm chillin' backstage
Big nose, big lips, gon' get ya hands raised

It's easy, so easy, to tell you it's gon' be okay

Instead I push you away
Sunday everyone looks like you
But if our lives are cold inside tell me what's the use

If I say I love Jesus, but you can't see my Jesus
My words are empty, if they can't see Jesus in me
No more excuses, I give myself away
Because I may be the only Jesus they see

Too busy, forgive me, I've got problems of my own
It's easier to say your help is on the way
But I was your help all along
We're shouting, we're dancing, but can the world see a change
Am I just too selfish to see, the love they need you put inside of me

If we say we love Jesus, but they can't see our Jesus
Tell me what's the use if they can't see Jesus in you and me
No more excuses, we give it all away
Because we may be the only Jesus they see

If I am your hands and Your feet, and if your church is built inside of me
Where did we go wrong, we been here too long, we can't see your face anymore
It's not the same anymore

Have mercy on us Jesus, please forgive us Jesus
I lost my purpose, if they can't see You in me

I cry when you cry
Even the deep ones
Sometimes wonder why am I going through
I'm waiting but still no use

Your job and your life
Weighs on your mind
All day and all night

And what prayer to pray
Only a fool would think

For you there's a plan
A High Priest who knows
And who understands what you cannot say
Just a little longer can you wait

Don't know what tomorrow will bring
Or if this sickness will ever leave
You can paint a perfect picture
But will it ever look like it used to be

This season made you stronger and more mature
Can't you see how far you've come
And when you look back
It's gonna be worth it, oooh

So while you're waiting please wait patiently

I say ooh, it's so sweet
To know that You were always in love with me
Thought my game was clever
But no one can play me better than You
You know You always win cause You're

Oh
When I think about Your name I go, ooh
How You took away my pain I go, ooh
Every night at the club
Ain't no wife at the club
That Jesus He be showing me love
They said I wasn't gon' make it Kirk
I know how that sound
It's only by His grace I can say 'look at me now'

Hey Mr. DJ (Hey Mr. DJ)
Can you play my favorite song (will you play my favorite song)
I heard it say it's gonna get better
We gon' make it out the hood someday

Kirk Franklin,"My heart beats, standing on the edge
But my feet have finally left the ledge

Like an acrobat
There's no turning back

I'm letting go
Of the life I planned for me
And my dreams
I'm losing control
Of my destiny
It feels like I'm falling and that's what it's like to believe
So I'm letting go

This is a giant leap of faith
Trusting and trying to embrace

The fear of the unknown
Beyond my comfort zone

I'm letting go
Of the life I planned for me
And my dreams
I'm losing control
Of my destiny
It feels like I'm falling and that's what it's like to believe
So I'm letting go

Giving in to your gravity
Knowing You are holding me
I'm not afraid

Feels like I'm falling and that's what it's like to believe
Feels like I'm falling and this is the life for me",Declaration (This Is It),2010

Jesus all about it
At the altar you can tell
What you heart has to say, hey, hey 

You can tell how you need

So if your journey through life has been bitter sweet
And the courage to dream has turned incomplete
At the altar your brokenness He will meet

Kirk Franklin,"Brothers and sisters
I'm feelin' real good 'cause it ain't over
Right before I die I gotta live

Live out my dreams
So I can be what He planned for me
Not just for me but so they can see
Much more of Him and less of
Right before I die I gotta

Love my enemies, forgive the past
And set 'em free so I can free
Free up the things
Every blessing God has for me
See it's for me, not just for you
I had to learn from what I've been through
I can't go through that way again
Be hurt by you that way again
It's not the end

I used to be afraid to die
I used to be afraid to try
'Cause I was too afraid of knowing
What failing looked like
But the sun came to give me life
Now I feel like I can touch the sky
I'm ready if you're ready

Get up and live

Right now

Get up and live

Right now

Right before I die I gotta

Change, change how I think
Change how I speak I'm not the same
So when I speak
You don't hear the pain
No longer weak with no one to
Right before I die I gotta

Become more like you
Take up my cross
To count the cost 'cause I was lost
That's why I praise you
You're the only God
I don't know what they do

I used to be afraid to die
I used to be afraid to try
'Cause I was too afraid of knowing
What failing looked like
But the sun came to give me life
Now I feel like I can touch the sky
I'm ready if you're ready

Right now

Get up and live

Right now

So the next time you think of me
And you wonder where would I be
Without each blessing that helped me to see
Life is much more than things
And how you live is more than how you sing
When I die what did I really mean, I mean

Say what now? Say what? Say what now?
As we proceed, to give you what you need
Somebody, anybody, everybody, scream

I used to be afraid to die
I used to be afraid to try
'Cause I was too afraid of knowing
What failing looked like
But the sun came to give me life
Now I feel like I can touch the sky
I'm ready if you're ready

Right now

Get up and live

Right now

I see you makin' it, but you all

Kirk Franklin,"Born alone and left to die
Rejected, often criticized
Hid behind the childhood lies
Everything has changed since the blood
Since the blood, since the blood
Oh, the blood

Born alone and left to die
Rejected, often criticized
Hid behind the childhood lies
Everything has changed since the blood
(Falling on us)
Since the blood (it gave me purpose)
Since the blood (it says you're for us)
Since the blood (who can be against us)

Hopeless fallen from the air
Reaching but no hand is there
Screaming, quiet, no one cares
I might as well have died
But the blood (falling on us)
But the blood (it gave me purpose)
But the blood (it says you're for us)
Oh, the blood (who can be against us), oh

Oh, the cleansing power
That takes the guilt away (Jesus)
The lamb was sacrificed now we
No longer fear the grave (yes, Jesus)
No more condemnation (hallelujah)
The debt of man is paid

By the blood (by the blood)
But for the blood
By the blood (by the blood)
But for the blood

Now we are never alone (your)
Your blood, it makes us strong (now)

Whatever's first, it feels the same
Be young or poor, old age or fame
Know this for sure, everyone hurts, we all feel pain

Everyone hurts, everyone falls

Tell me how much can my soul take
We make mistakes, we hurt we need amazing grace

So we pray tonight, that you don't get weak
And please pray that I, don't forget what I believe
'Cause these days are hard, and faith sometimes is work
Pray until He heals the hurt
I trust God will heal the hurt

Everyone hurts, we all ask why
Sinner or saint, everyone tries
Life cuts so deep, feels like your dying
No cross no crown can't give up now please heal tonight

So we pray tonight, that you don't get weak
And please pray that I, don't forget what I believe
'Cause these days are hard, and faith sometimes is work
Pray until He heals the hurt
I trust God will heal the hurt

So tonight we cry out for the world
Cry out for the world 'cause everyone hurts
Everyone goes through sorrow
Tonight we cry out for the world
Cry out for the world
Please heal our hearts tonight

Everyone hurts but not for long
That weight you bare, will make you strong
Your guilty stains can be erased
The final price paid by His life amazing grace

So we pray tonight, that you don't get weak
And please pray that I, don't forget what I believe
'Cause these days are hard, and faith sometimes is work

Before you sit down there's something I need to explain
Since you're here
I think I should tell you since we last talked things have changed
See I'm tired of being brokenhearted
So I made a list and you're on it
All my hopes and my dreams you took from me
I want those back before you leave

Hello fear
I knew I would see you,
You have a hard time letting go
See these tears,
Take a good look 'cause soon they won't fall anymore
God's healing my hurtful places
That seat that was yours now is taken
I'm no longer afraid, see I'm better this way
And one more thing before you leave

Never again will I love you
My heart it refuses to be your home
No longer your prisoner
Today I remember
Apart from you is where I belong
And never again will I trust you
I'm tired of fighting it's been way too long
No longer your prisoner
Today I remember
Who I was and now it's gone

They're gone, hello fear

Farewell, goodbye, so long
Farewell, goodbye, so long
Farewell, goodbye, so long

Hello grace
It feels like forever, I thought my chance with you was gone
See your face, it reminds me of mercy
And please let me say I was wrong
Never knew your touch was endless
How you never run dry of forgiveness
Didn't know how bad it was, was afraid just because
Sorry fear, grace took your place

Never again will I love you
My heart it refuses to be your home
No longer your prisoner
Today I remember
Apart from you is where I belong
And never again will I trust you
I'm tired of fighting it's been way too long
No longer your prisoner

Kirk Franklin,"To the nobodies, to the abandoned
Who couldn't see in the pain was a plan
Looking back now Lord I can say thank you
Now let me tell you who I am

How do you do?
I am a sinner
Born into sin and shaped in iniquity
Now I believe not who I was but still not what I shall be
You found me and gave me your name and
Things I desired have changed but
Inside you'll see it's still broken pieces
Deep in me reaches for you (hello)

How do you do?
I am a beggar (that means I'm)
Desperate for more
I hunger for your truth
See I am shattered (broken)
And though I may fall still you make all things new
You speak, the storm, it obeys and gone is the weight of mistakes and
Though I still feel you continue to heal, look close, and see (whoa)

I am so far from perfect
I thought life is worthless
Until you showed me who I am
Not here by mistake
No luck, only grace
I'm on my way to
Who I am (not who I was), I am (forgiven and loved)
I am (healed by your blood), I am (yes)
Thank God I am (still being changed)
I am (help me say), I am

How do you do?
I am a winner (it wasn't easy)
I've lost a few and life's knocked me to my knees
But now I am standing (hallelujah)
Not by my power, but your life inside of me
(just like you, I've gone through)
Even through seasons and changes (no tear)
No tear has ever been wasted
Misunderstood still it worked for my good
Look now and see
(I am not the old me but still)

I am (I am) so far from perfect
I thought life is worthless
Until you showed me who I am (don't forget you're)
Not here by mistake (yes)
No luck, only grace
I'm on my way to
Who I am (now called your son), I am (forgiven for what I've done)
I am (forgiven for what I've done), I am (yes)
Thank God I am (sealed by your grace)
I am (still here, help me say), I am

Come on
Here I am closer, praise now is stronger
Stood up to fear, I think I'm still here
Couldn't walk away, love said not today
Times haven't seen what God has for me
The hurt and the lies, through the pain, through the night
Cried and I cried, but still I survived

I am so far from perfect
I thought life was worthless (yes God)
Until you showed me who I am (I am)
Not here by mistake
No luck, only grace
I'm on my way to
Who I am (and all of you), I am (I'm in love with you)
I am (here to worship you), I am (Jesus)
Thank God I am (ready to be closer)
I am (ready to go higher), I am

I am so far from perfect (so far)
I thought life was worthless (yes)
Until you showed me who I am (but you showed me)
Not here by mistake (thank you)
No luck, only grace (thank you)
On my way toWho I am (I'm not ashamed)
I am (look, I'm not the same)
I am (letting go of the pain), I am (yes Lord)
Thank God I am (more than what you see)
I am (not yet what I shall be), I am

Oh thank you
You didn't give up on me while I was still in the process
Hallelujah God that you could see what I couldn't see
Thank you",I Am,2011

Now we are never alone
Your blood it makes us strong
Now there is power to move on
Never, we are never alone

Once I had a heart that just wouldn't seem to heal
No joy blowing through the wind
You're touch I couldn't feel
Near my ear I heard your voice
Speaking comfort to my soul
Saying when you're weak that's when I am strong
Now I am so glad I know

No more loneliness
No more cloudy days 
No more crying in the midnight 
Or the fears that just won't fade 
No more loneliness
No more skies that all seem gray
For I am resting in your blood stained hands
Forever and away

Though I may fall
I hear your call telling me
That I am free, free indeed

No more cloudy days 
No more crying in the midnight 
Or the fears that just won't fade

In the world, things have changed
Look around, all I see is pain
And through it all one thing's the same
I still believe the power of your name (your name)

You've given up and walked away
God's not real, some people say (some people say)
But when troubles come and the sky is gray
Everybody gets real deep now and wants to pray

But why wait 'til your money's gone?
Lose your house, job and you're all alone
Call his name and it won't be long
'Til you feel that fire vanish, shot up in your bones

And this is what we hear
Through the dark and through our fears

It is still the sweetest name

It's on you bro

I can't sing but I am gonna work hard for you to like me
Didn't dream 'cause if I failed then I might be

Could I ever say I did it?
Tell ye now that I am second to admit it
Insecure, I can't understand the application
If I applied myself, I guess there would be no situation

But who teaches who when every day's in a substitute?
I try to plant love, but it never took root
My soul's got weeds and the roots are too deep
The roots don't sail 'cause the roots are too deep
Wait A-D-D see my roots too deep
A kid too afraid to close his eyes and sleep 
Can't you hear me stutter every time I speak?

Fear said hello when she left me weak
Loved me and left me with abandonment issues
Pain's a secret but it illuminates in you
Then it creates a menu, puts sin on your plate
You don't know until later how much of it you ate
Now I'm watchin' my weight
Will this album be my best one
But if it's not ya'll on to the next one

Kirk Franklin,"I'm losing my religion
Thank God
I prayed about my decision
How odd
For the man with the mic
To be the man all his life
While Christ-like stipes did with REM
Rev up the RPMs
How do I begin to try to paint this sin, of rules?
That divides God's people in two

In the beginning, religion created a mask
The reformation helped but soon the patch didn't last
I don't tell, you don't ask
So we created a lie
And for generations, church was where we went to go hide
Or we no longer tried
Because rules read our relationship was empty inside
Leaves you bitter, dry
Swift to cut like a razor
Swift to call you a traitor
'Cause you're swift to love Taylor
Now we got bad blood with our neighbor

Who's wrong, who's right
Every Sunday we're divided
Who's black, who's white, C'mon
Now the man in the mirror never gets race right
He'll never be Christ-like
Never receive good pay
So your faith never rises above minimum wage
So when it's time to save the world
You don't know what to say
To your brother that you love when he tells you he's gay
Do you push him away?
Judge him down till he leaves?
Give him a gospel he hears or a gospel he sees
Love wrapped in truth is the gospel he needs
There's room at the cross for everyone, even me

Well, my sins are now clean
The loss now redeemed
Religion is a prison but truth sets us free
Helps us believe
That the world we're in now is not the world that will be
Terror, famine, disease
Millions in poverty
Hungry, can't sleep
With all of this religion, why these babies can't eat?
And if the middle class is gone, how can America see?
How can America breathe?
When the oxygen is gone from the American dream
And these American streets listen close as they speak
The next time you think America please include me

Help the ones that are weak
All they want is a piece
Of the pie that you keep
Is that too much to ask of those who lay the concrete?
Still laying on concrete
Pop, pop by police
See, they the foundation of the nation
Not the 2%
Not the ones that own the building that the middle class rent
Because they make sense

Tell me how do you feel?
I'm the new Franklin and I have the new deal
I fight and do right
FDR for real
One nation under God
God, show us the way
The science of opinion
God is not a buffet
You pick what you want so no God on your plate
The preacher isn't God
Religion's first mistake
Serving stewards, shepherds, not kings

Let me touch You and see if You are real
Even though, I know my heart Your hands can heal
But sometimes I get discouraged
And I need Your strength and shield, Jesus
Let me touch You and see if You are real

Sometimes to me You seem so far away
And I wonder how to make it through the day
But if I can touch the hem of Your garment
Your power, I know, You can heal, Jesus
Let me touch You and see if You are real

So I am never scared, you can YouTube me

I was initiated into manhood at thirteen and it wasn't a barmitzvah
I break a bottle on you like a bad bartender
Let my star venture out, I got war in me, so let me vent it out

Ill admit it I could spit it like a fitted knitted cap
That means tight and won't stop like a city cab
That means I'm not white
But I figured do it big because the slum needs me
So instead of getting a beat from Kanyeezy
Who would probably take half my budget
I could save the back end and send it back to Mogadishu
Where my family and friends getting patched up again you can ask hova
The hood is harder than you thought
Like a fifty chain getting snatched in Angola?

Kirk Knight,"And I guess it's my turn to shine
The bright light I was starin' at turn lime
And the green stuff turned to slime, and grime
Everybody want to be your blood cousin
When you're buzzing
Fine, I give 'em my other line, another rhyme
Word to mother, I'm goosed up
My two fucks in two cups
Another double entendre
She fell in that Bombay
Now she tumble dry lingerie
Chardonnay nothing but the bottle of emotion
But the love potion when it sprays
They just caught up in the days
Let me show you how I feel these Jays
The cheese stays high like Dr. J
My flow is like land the boats, dock the planes
Hand the dope but cop the chains
For more fiends some antidote to stop the pain
Now my stream, floods these streets
They can't stop the reign

All right I need them back
To blast, to blast me out of sight
Like a satellite
Vibe all night
A satellite

I take a day off
Let the trees take some weight off
My mental's just a fact, Bannon's got the instrumental
I keep niggas on their toes
So you got creases in your Forces
My verses they're important, yo your verses they are boring
I am not of this Earth bro
I'm a satellite that's bound to fight
But we're down to light, 'n light the fuck up

Vibe all night

As I roll the die
Like my first drink was just the brink of a crooked eye
But don't blame the ice for the I U KEL
Oh God couldn't see past 'em
If his name is puff pass, no derive
Two dubs I got 40 on my hit list
Just smoking drinks both the broken in-glass like old English
Are you good bro?
Is your eyes dilated from the kush 'n Nuvo?
This new for the life
Like a Nubian with the doobie cold eyes
Better smell the coffee I'mma coughing
That means I'm sick widdit, spit it out
Kill it like airborne diseases
Is this why the rap game is this easy?
Like please eat your vegetables
So I took a dose of the edible
Ain't an overdose
Already a rap monster fucking overload
Hopping up on stepping stones
So we making stepping stones
Turn up that tichrome
Be back to introduce
This is Messiah and the eyes are hopeless
Please open my divide eyes through the world flex

This ship
Don't this shit make my people wanna jump?
No disrespect, ask my man for the pumps
Don't this shit
To blast, to blast me out of sight like a satellite
Don't this shit make my people wanna jump?
No disrespect, ask my man for the pumps
Don't this shit make my people wanna jump?

Surround Sounder
Come and hear the blunt-smoking philosopher
Smoking with a joint to get you open like a chakra
No time for the roster this rap game goes either way
Let him lead the way
And niggas will know who they need to play
Freeing the ways to amplify the idiolect
Saw nothing but shots since the project days
Like I was eyin' the Tec
Kept the eye in the text
Make 'em see my eye in the Lex
Giving my blood sweat and iron injecting selecting the soul
Cause mind body and soul can't be reinstalled
Special with the flow to make Niagara fall
It's over for the systematic rapping robotics
Crashing my logic
These niggas hooked on hooks and Hooked on Phonics
With hooked on phonics the pot could get em hooked on chronic
Cause pain conditions from the page conditions
Racing like Sonic inhaling the tonic
They couldn't grade my brain in a college
Themes behind it rob you for ya mind like thieves is behind it
So we had to squeeze in knowledge
To pile it when the green sees wallet
Anything to let the green seize wallet
Taking forever and a century with sentence speeds
Like a penitentiary to build cell blocks to block your memory
Catch me on the enemy's territory
Telling terrorist story with a terror
The Era ends with a good night story

So much fuckin stress on my mind real quick holmes

Lust demons get hornier and hornier
As the kills gets gorier and gorier
From corridors to corner stores
Catch him on the block
With the orphans in the streets
Violin's playing as another black coffin
Speaks at the thought
Of another ignorant phone call
Who is this calling me at 5:47 in the morning
Crack of dawn and why she mourning
Bittersweet, hit it both ways, now I'm scorching
First things first, man
You fucking with your hearse
So rehearse who you coming at
Aye aye squintin' at Captain Kirk
Star trekking, playing my role
But still follow scenes tread
Enemies, friend up ahead of me
Show no empathy
Get smashed like a centipede
Sent to energy
Don't bug me with your sympathy
You ran a whole train on a bitch
She still suck a mad dick
When the clock tick
As I elect no cause of politic
Could you picture the damage that we inflict?
I'm staring at my own, own fucking depth
Backwoods smoking out my motherfucking chest
5 minutes to death
I'm still in bed, get high at rest
As I arrest the sex pin
My love reminisce
Learn to architect, computerize love
It's that project that'll
Shock her back to cardiac arrest

I got some problems that I can't get away from
If all else fails, know I got my day ones
I got five on it
Keep a nigga face numb
Fuck five on it

My trigger finger get hornier and hornier
Finger fuck the grip til it spit on a cop
A warning shot for the warden
Holla, say the word if you want it
I'ma bring the ward in
Peep holes straight through ya doorman
My sound reach foreign
Y'all still be local, I'm in this foreign
My vocals still ain't focal
Rap game in a chokehold
I smoke those who don't know
Who could get lunged in the air by the dope flow
Matter fact, I flow dope, bars by the boatload
You said you ready for war, boy I just hope so
Let me vindicate for all my indigos and negates what I indicate
Been the great, the Flatbush renegade niggas been afraid
Squeeze the life out you rap niggas like lemonade
Yo, Kreeper say the word and I eliminate

Cross me, be the first and last like alpha and omega

Niggas with hella guns
Residence medieval so watch my umbrella, uh
Bright like canella with statements like Mandela, uh
Stank-face still stainless, it's whatever bruh

Hopped in the hot seat I'm drunk nigga
Leave you slump nigga

I dare some
To try to flash clothes and fair guns
Because where I'm from for amusement shoot the fair one

Go Brooklyn, go Brooklyn, go Brooklyn
Brooklyn's in the house!

I said nowadays Brooklyn ain't the same
And life's a scam and I'd rather be paid
Credit card by that fuckin' BOA
But if you want a couple stacks than you're going to Chase
If you play your cards right than you're heading the fast way
And them niggas in the clash just fillin' up plates
So I just keep on, reachin', lying to my teachers
With the hammer pants, I keep security cards in my sneakers
I'm heading for the trust funds, bonds, and planned speeches
All I ever knew was a ATF procedure
Transaction, gotta eat
Serving all the status
No fan could catch me that BMW fashioned
Black tinted, Mac 10
Oh yes the bitches
Circle round scan them pockets for the double digits
And these things around me make my wants money, bitches

All my hitters nonchalant, quick to change your ambiance
I’m from Castle, hail savage with the battle tales
Average with the baddest [?] status make you made as hell

Born from the trenches, hotter than these bomb shells
Coated arm, Larry Hench and Bond and with these living tissues
Not doing well, knee deep in the situation
Needed so they [?] very well
Preaching that this park side, nigga made me believe to something to eat
Peter Pan always dishing out flavors for all the streets
Always respecting the elder, but never give up the seat
And life is but a tightrope, will remain full of petite
Balancing with desferal, call that Ying Yang Twin
And get chemically imbalanced when the kid starts spitting
That's the full bitten, when the price is right, we sell a dream
We was born on the rocks star, intoxicated [?]
Off the scene, wasted all the time tryna find our life
Thought the scenes of Robin life
Tryna find drug abused knees, something to lean on
So nigga, I'm just gon' keep on
Pushing like the birth of newborns
While others miss-carry the message that a nigga grew on
Thought they woke up, nigga, false alarm, we snoozed on
The grass is greener on the other side
Lord of the Flies end of the innocence
I call smell in the air, PH proof on
This for STEEZ, this for STEEZ
Don't forget you in your bee, nigga

In a lot of ways, you're a lucky guy
Now all you need is a chance to try

In my heart there's a need to shout
Dyin', screamin', cryin' let me out
Are all those feelings that want to touch
Any love?

What a world for the lonely guy
Sometimes I feel I'm gonna lose my mind
Can anybody tell me just where to find
Any love, any love?

Everyone needs a love no doubt
Any love, Any love
Everybody feels alone without
Any love, any love

I know there's a love waiting
To enter my life, enter my life

Every day as I live
I try to think positive
I pray for someone good to come

And I can't wait for my love life to shine

I know there's someone waiting for me
To enter my life, Come into my life

Suddenly I'm up in clear blue skies
Lonely tears start to fill my eyes
I can weep, but I refuse to cry
I've got to keep holding on

To think love is strong
To keep holding on

I wanted to get down and sweet talk you

We should come close again

Kirk Whalum,"In a magical time, in a mystical place
He and she crossed paths
Their native tongues foreign to each other, they are not

Underscored with melody of innocence
They are children unaware of the impure
Able to communicate, able to take each others breathe

Without words, placed in a mesmerizing trance
With a dance of melody
Whalum wails in a whisper
Translating light, peace, joy, hope
There's something about that horn

The beautiful air soaked with freedom to be
Liberating the spirit to embrace difference
He speaks, she speaks, they listen to unknown, unfamiliar dialog
Completely familiar with each other
He takes hold of her soul, she takes hold of his soul

Within the quickest moment a lifetime has passed
Now begun the sun shining from that horn
Heals them both who have been scorned
Now adorned with jewels of wisdom
There's something about that horn
Whalum wails in a whisper

Through there mental temple blows a gentle breeze
Of hearing, really listening to what is being felt and said
Can that simply be the miracle of simplicity?
Listening, hearing, understanding
Even if you don't agree, agree to be cool

Something old school and yet something new is unfolding
Love always there, just being rediscovered
Melody always there, just had to find it again

Something old school and yet something new is unfolding
Holding the most timeless wibe
Like that horn on this groove, move, oh yeah

Oh, that's what's happening, they're moving each other
And brother it's hot, but it's not what you think
He is community, she is state, they are nations

This music speaks in a language only the spirit can comprehend
And make a mense, praying to walk on water
Breathe easy, calm air

He is beauty, she is strength, they are power
He is earth, she is fire, she is belief, he is culture
They are every color
He is harmony, she is melody, they are music

There's something about that horn
Whalum wails in a whisper
There's something, something about that horn
Oh yeah, that horn is love

Whalum wails in a whisper
Whalum wails in a whisper

And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.

He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

A crowd of people turned away
but I just had to look
Having read the book.
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

Ain't no sense in even wondering why 
She don't care about me 

I know she lives on 4th street or somewhere round about all 
I want to do is hold her hand or hang her dirty laundry out 
She's got a sister names Alice her older brother's name is bill 
She ain't got no dentist but her teeth are shiny still

And the occasional altered dreams

Appetites for memories grow
As the sunshine begins to fade
Across the hill it's the same old chill
Lurking right there in the shade

Just a child with bright eyes and a smile
Laughter was all she knew
Her mama was away and all papa did was pray
So the wanderlust slowly grew

She spread her wings and a couple other things
For the medicine man downtown
With his bottle of elixir he said that he would fix her
And soon she was going down

And everyone begins to look the same
Feel the burn from the same old evil flame
We watched her fall from sweet and kind
And I wish she could come back sweet Magdeline

She was gone on a bad trip
Followed by a needle and a silver spoon
Mama sat and cried and papa told us lies
Said she'd be back real soon

Suddenly the seasons changed
From the fall back to the spring
Answers live like peasants here
When the questions reign as king

And everyone begins to look the same
Feel the burn from the same old evil flame
We watched her fall from sweet and kind
And I wish she could come back sweet Magdeline

Just a child with bright eyes and a smile
Laughter was all she knew
Mama was away and papa sat and prayed
While the wanderlust that slowly grew

She spread her wings and wanted to do things
For the medicine man downtown
And with his bottle of elixir he said that he would fix her
And soon she was, soon she was going down, yeah

And everyone begins to look the same
Feel the burn from the same old evil flame
We watched her fall from sweet and kind
And I wish she could come back
And I will really do is, wish she come back
I wish she could come back sweet Magdeline

Kirk Yoquelet,"I remember as the seasons turned to fall 
Wind was sitting and the leaves fell a hinting a sign of the near winter's ball 
Chill in the air as I strolled down the front steps looking for a tale to tell 
Then she slipped me a stare as I slid into my chair she already knew me too well 

She said hello in that beautiful voice my reply was nowhere as sweet 
She seemed impressed by the state of my mess laughed at the wings on my feet 
Offered me a cigarette and before I could even refuse 
We were standing alone she was chilled to the bone she told me to sing the blues 

[Chorus:] 
Hey hey now I feel alright and I just wanted to see 
If I may if I might be the king of your world tonight 
So I told her of the books I'd read and details about the time I stole 6 dollars from a man named Jed just to turn around and pay him back 

I quoted my favorite poem but I ended it terribly wrong 
She said I understand then she clapped both her hands and said that's my favorite song 

[Chorus]

Just then a man walked in and took her away she said her sweet goodbye 
I'll see you again some day so it was over and I was standing there all alone 
And I said to myself as I dusted my shelf this time I think it was love 

[Chorus]",Wish,2001
Kirk Yoquelet,"You say that it's over this time for good 
But this time around you know that I wish 
That you would not call me on the phone
I need to get used to being alone 
Now you tell me you want me to be your friend 
Don't you know I'll be your fool again 
You say now you're gone and you won't be back 
This time around I'm just a little bit smarter than that 
Just because you've packed your bags 
That doesn't mean that you won't return 
That's the lesson I learned the last time I let you back in 
Don't you know I'll be your fool again 

My friends tell me that they doubt it 
When I tell them I can learn to live without it 
They say it's a game that I can't win 
So you say you found a new man and he treats you fine 
You say he brings you flowers and bottles of cheap red wine 
You say you like the way he wears his hair 
But don't you know I wouldn't care if you ever walk out on him 
Don't you know I'll be your fool again",Your Fool,2001

Just a kiss goodnight, maybe
You and I will fall in love (you and I will fall in love)

[Cee-Lo]
Shit, behold it is me, it is the epitome of extraterrestrial energy
Experiment and enter the internals of the inner me
The art of gone, and heart of stone, and own's worst enemy

Intellect shapeshifta, God's gift a Soul slippa
Hone in on clones and blow them out of my zone
International Fanatical, the radical tactical movements
Sounds are congruent to it

Work

It is what it ain't to these, infected disease
Thought of automatons deceived, by the deceptions indeed
Who mechanically breed at methodical speeds
Distorting your genes, aborting your dreams
As coarse as it seems

Aiyyo, Work

[Cee-Lo]
I could scream, I can't seem to sleep long enough to dream
It's life on a laser beam
But I fiend for the future at my finger tips
One of the minor technicalities of my head trips

You Better Work

The Barea Soul terror, been told since stories of old
Come on let's go and then I'll show how to beat down a rhyme
And wrestle a tempo
Hold on tight, but still let yourself go

Work

This is what I'm talking about
Should I begin to spit it just like the wind
Show my power take flight and quickly ascend
Like a bird beating my wings to the pulse of nature
Scaring spiritual devils while evoking the maker
Is it wrong for me to curse in the name of right
Is it wrong for me to spit life into this mic
That's all I'm asking baby
How come the new millennium brings fright
Something wicked approaches tonight

Work

It's the upgraded, complicated, premeditated

It's the psychotic, mean melodic, nod-narcotic
Microhard
(repeat)

What good is a call on the phone if you can't speak
And you find it hard to breathe
Paralyzed by my essence, mere presence I put forth
Inherently legends record all souls of expressions
Evil as evil does, better than good was
A spirit of music that once was, born out of the pool of your love
Baby I'm an agent with a flow that's so contagious
And all and all true patience, my brotha Lo told me makes for perfection
While you feeling bound by this matrix
That's why when it comes to protecting mine
I'm a brother you can call over zealous
And I lust and thrust out my staff and wet
Till the motherfuckin' rains get jealous

You Gotta Work

It's not coincidental I use my soul for a stencil to outline the rhyme
That connects machine and a mind
Until the end of time the one my kind, the message will now be profoundly
Spoken, rules are meant to be broken, therefore it's my pleasure to mentor
But once learned you must learn you must yearn to discern
The mechanical glitch of artificial intelligence
But the consequence of your ignorance is the reality I now see before me:
""maybe in time we'll see""

Don't Stop, Work

The degree you'll see will 'cause casualty when the codes download
The truth will unfold uphold until the end
'Cause our destiny will be to win, you're still free to sin within

I am the melody, the metaphoric prehistoric
The pre-meaning before it, preparing for war shit
Their god's only a graphic, the sky's computer blue
There is a moral malfunction, what will the machine do to you
They maliciously monopolize the mass
Niggas sleep rap and fuck they surprise you last
When you sell them your soul they supply you cash
But you can die for all they care, with your expendable ass
Because they know a new nigga, a brand new nigga
Will jump right in them tap shoes even if his feet bigger
Ain't shit sweet nigga, it's deeper than the street nigga
You and I just a virus they gonna delete nigga
Some people say go on and join what you can't beat nigga
I won't take the mark so I can't eat nigga
Holla if I'm talking to ya, (AH!)

Our comrade Cee-Lo is considered by many as a modern day Neo
And opposing forces known as agents will like him dead for what he know
He is The One, at least that's who Morpheus say he is
He can free the mind of a machine and give God to an atheist
But he's a daydreamer, it's all in his head
Still today's music has become the Matrix
And the real rhythm is in the red pill
So I chose it knowing I can never return once I'm gone
And I hope you got this message
I'll be waiting by the phone

I used to want you and her and her and her and you with her and her
And now you got me alone and me tonight
I'ma give you my all, all I want is you

Hair in a bun 'cause sometimes the hair just hides your beauty
Swear on my son, ain't too many things could hide your booty
Call me what you like, but bet I slide with cutie
Kenny name wasn't Bud, but he still ride with Rudy
And that's why we comfortable as a Huxtable
You been around since the Lunchables, girl I fucks with you
In the back of the truck with you, same fingers I chuck with two
I'm just playing with you, thinking bout staying with you
Not forever but at least until the A.M. with you
Still playing with it, but you like it raw
Might need a morning after, what we did the night before
Might go another round if you're trying to fight me more

I won't be holding back, my love
I won't be holding back
I won't be holding back, my love
No won't be holding back
'Cause in the end you'll know I want another round
Another round
Another round
Another round, oh I know I want another round
Another round (A round a round)

I used to want you and her and her and her and you with her and her
And now you got me alone and me tonight
I'ma give you my all, all I want is you

Cake cake cake cake cake, you know you love it
Icing like Nuvo with a touch of red velvet, look at you,
You a star, I'm a G, Joe the Don
Super thief, I go hard in these sheets, I'm a God, Lord,
Emilio Pucci leggings for good behavior
I wanna tear them shits off you like Hulkamania
Then dive up in the pussy, Superfly Snuka
Have you coming back to back, more sex to cook up
But ask the girl will I hit advance
She post it out picture perfect, Instagram
I hit home runs and drink last shots
She tore her ACL from all the backshots

I won't be holding back, my love
I won't be holding back
I won't be holding back, my love
No won't be holding back
'Cause in the end you'll know I want another round

So she done came down
Double cup with ice, man, I think she got some drink from me
Ever since I came round
She say she feel wrong, 'cause her boyfriend listen to me
I don't give a damn bout it
That nigga, if he trip, I got a whole clique of killers with me
See, I'm the man now
Rolling 24's through the hood, women checking for me
Girl, I ain't playing 'round
Pull up to the crib, hope you wearing something special for me
And I'mma lay it down
Round one, two, and three for you and me

I won't be holding back, my love
I won't be holding back
I won't be holding back, my love
No won't be holding back

And she know you weak and we ain't the same
You hit the scene, I make the scene

H-Town so I'm made for lean
I'm in her soul, I make her scream
I don't ride the toll, don't pay the change

Same page, same book, different song, same hook
Every time her nigga trippin', she on the phone with the same crook
And every time I pull up, she hit me with that same look
Lips bitin', hips right she left her man for that get right

Say ain't nobody triller
I'm a motherfuckin' killer
Say ain't nobody triller
And you know it's for real

Wake up in the morning, give thanks to the Lord
For giving me another day so I can go hard
Never been fraud, always kept it true
Get dressed, hit the street try ta' see what it do
Cut a few corners, chunk a few dubs
Get 'em, jump back, trill niggas show love
Some try to hate, I don't pay it no mind
Either get with me or get like me, that's on the grind
Candy paint shine as I flip through the city
Ridin' 84s, and them hoes look pretty
Had dirty money way before P Diddy
I'm just tryna squeeze a little mo' milk up out the titty is ya with me?

I'mma put it down my nigga
Gotta do what I do for the town my nigga
Boys talking down on a nigga
But since day one I've been a killer mayne and ain't nobody triller

The sun is shining down on my Astro's hat
I'm all about the cheese but I never been a wreck
Gotta keep it to yo self, what part of the game is that?
You see me rollin' 4's on them foes, just flipping
Leaning on the leather through the Southside dipping
You know I got the gat up on my lap with the clip in
Cock back ready but these boys ain't tripping
Who run this bitch? Don't even bother
My granddaddy did, he passed it to my father
My father did his thing like a G
He passed it down to me
Now the neighborhood belong to Bun B, OG

But since day one I've been a killer manye and ain't nobody triller
Say ain't nobody triller

And you know it's for real

Pussy niggas need to stay off in they lane
Sitting sidelines, want to quarterback the game
Back seat drivers get to talking too much
But not when I'm around, cause they know they get touched
This the city called Clutch, and that's how we come through
Fake niggas runnin' up? What the fuck they gon' do?
P.A. trill nigga, no Hilfiger
Put it on yo ass, before when we still we'll nigga
New niggas in the game, get your share
Long as you ain't touching mine, bitch I really don't care
Sets in the air, twist yo fingers til they break
Trill recognize trill, we never roll fake for the game

Velvet as the moon she lays down and resting stays
So she's seeing the shadow of life
Falls over the bright light and so on

She's breathing the air surrounding celestial stairs
And in the bright light shine all the sparkles in flight
Hold me tight just cross the line
Words capture silently all this time

Reminds me now of islands rising silently
Desert zones and western domes
Footsteps sound so lonely Travelling into dreams
Passing season gloved in grey the feeble dying beam

Its pain without ecstasy so, now
The contact is lost nothing but a sense of fear
And tonight the ocean is quiet
It's waters forever dead and so tell me

And looking around all my life lost in
A bridge filled with night.",Blue Room,2005

Screams and soft lovers, memories of a fight.
Slowly the clouds are fading into a cage,
While from my hands is falling another page...

Velvet black rays are drifting now so fast,
And in the great light I cannot see no more
Where is the right side, where is the golden door.

Mornings and colors are playing out of here,
Because I don't remember the memories of fear,
The aura of the moondawn is loosing her contours,
Sweet angels of heaven are missing their return.

Goes by everyday

All I need

Lock into that big one 
Escape to open places

Through the windows in the wall

And became so thin

The tacky photos and the phoney smiles

Just as an airplane roared above
Said something about football
But he never mentioned love

I never heard him all the times he yelled
I never heard him if he tried to tell me
If my memory serves me well
He never mentioned love
I never hurt him 'though he says I did
I never hurt him but I die a bit
Each time he passes on the street
He never mentions love

I used to call him every night
And pray that he was home
I couldn't bear the feeling
I might have to live my life alone
But now my phone is off the hook
The word came from above
It told me I was wasting time
If he never mentioned love

I never heard him if he said he cared
I never heard him, I kept my claws bared
I never heard the things he says he said
He never mentioned he was scared
I never heard him when he asked of love
I never heard him as the skies above
Chucked buckets on the both of us
He never mentioned love

So if I seem hardhearted
I would like the court to note
He never mentioned love to me
In anything he wrote
And if I seem coldblooded
I should like to tell the judge
In all the time I knew this man
He never spoke of love
(or if he did)

I never heard him when he called to me
I never heard him at all you see
He was down the line away from me
He never mentioned l.u.v.
I never hurt him 'though he says I did
I never hurt him I just die a bit
Each time we meet upon the street
We never mention love

I was born and I was bred
I was reared and I was fed
Moved into the neighbourhood
Where I was bad and I was good
I fixed things for people there
I took them out I don't know where
I coloured in their lives to give them outlines
I walked before I'll walk again
I'll walk along a line of men
And walk into the lion's den

I think you know but you won't say
Just what it is makes life this way
But I'm not going to take this lying down

Reach for the stars retch for the earth
We took the earth and made it worse
And there was never any doubt
We ate it up we spat it out
And still we love to say we did it our way
On this voyage of discovery
I'm blinded by the things I see
I've seen before I'll see again
I'll look along a line of men
And fall into the lion's den

Now you can pray your head is bared
And I'm not saying I'm not scared
But I'm not going to take this lying down

I think you know but you won't say
Just what it is makes life this way
But I'm not going to take this lying down

Maybe it's imaginary, I'd like to know
What's the world coming to and where will it go?
The hole in the sky where the sunshine gets in
It dries up the land as it mucks up your skin
And I don't know why, who will reveal?
Maybe it's imaginary, maybe it's real
We wash all the food and we peel off the skin
But what is the point if it's poisoned within?
Now I don't know why we say ok
Maybe it's imaginary, hope it's not too late
And when in the summer we go to the sea
The things floating by aren't what we want to see
And I'd change it all if I had one wish
I'd never go swimming with those nuclear fish
Maybe those imaginary rivers run dry
But if it's true then I'd like to know why
I don't know much but I'd like to know why

All it took was the time it takes
To smoke a cigarette or jam on the brakes
I nearly had it in my hands and now it's gone
Am I complaining 'bout by luck again?
Well it seems to me I was the one
Stood moaning in the morning sun
And now it doesn't matter much wherever I may roam
I keep feeling, feeling my way home

Now you see me, now you don't
You say you will but I know you won't
You nearly had me in your hands but now I'm gone
But not complaining 'bout my life again
No siree, and what I've got belongs to me entirely
I look left and I look right and I cross this road alone
'cause I'm feeling my way
I may go up, I may go down but wherever I may roam
I keep feeling my way home

Shall I explain away my life again?
Well it seems to me it's too far gone
To wonder where it all went wrong
I get up and I get down but I get there on my own

While the firelight is low
I'm disappearing
Like the last day of the snow
And really, it's better this way
We both know it's over
And we'll never pass this way again

Sunshine and the desert call to me
And you know moonshine
Makes you blind so you can't see at all
But whatever you feel
It may not be real
And baby we'll never pass this way again

I'm not the only love you'll ever know
Look to your stars above and wish it so
Let me go

And he felt alone so he followed a light
Into a bar where the music was loud
He ordered a pint and got lost in the crowd
He asked a girl if she wanted to dance
She turned up her nose and she told him ""no chance!""
He felt rejected and stood by the wall
And wondered why he'd ever bothered at all
He missed his family and wished he was home
With all of those strangers he felt so alone

He bought her a drink with his last two quid
When he said ""come back for a coffee"" she did

Patrick you've got it made
You're halfway there, you're on your way
Patrick she's not afraid
And now I bet you're glad you stayed

Looking so lovely and perfectly groomed
She showed in the centre of patrick's room
She was lit up from the inside and out
Oh he was enchanted as she moved about
She touched him like sunlight on cold mountain stone
And he grew afraid lest she leave him alone

A terrible band playing ""johnny be goode""

I do my makeup and I go to look for work

And I've been replaced by some computer jerk

Living like a hermit all alone
Find an occupation that won't deafen me

One day you'll be waving there 
No empty bench in Soho Square

And left a message on my machine
She called to say you broke her heart
And she'd wondered if I'd seen you
I didn't know what to do, I never called her back
Oh how can I break the news like that

Now I don't want to see caroline
Don't want to see her face when she finds out you're mine
Can't look in her eyes and tell her love is blind
Now I don't want to see caroline
I don't want to see caroline

How can I want you so bad
She has to lose again
How could you walk out on her
And turn to her best friend
It was wrong from the start
I wish I'd turned you away
And my head said go, but my heart, my heart said stay

And now I don't want to see caroline
Don't want to see her cry when she knows you're mine
Can't look in those eyes and tell her she'll be fine
Now I don't want to see caroline
I don't want to see caroline

I'm so ashamed of myself that I still want you
What a terrible thing for a friend to do

I think I've gone too far this time
I leapt across that thin blue line
God help this selfish heart of mine
Now I don't want to see caroline
I can never face caroline

Now I lie here with you, can't get her out my head
Do you think she knows that you share my bed

And I'm here for the hell of it now

And some boys play harder to get

I just hope he's happy when he does the things he thinks he has to do

I've camped by the Waynestones as well
I've sunbathed on Kinder, been burned to a cinder
And many more things I can tell

The heather has oft been me bed
And sooner than part from the mountains
I think I would rather be dead

The day was just ending and I was descending
Down Grinesbrook just by Upper Tor
When a voice cried ""Hey you"" in the way keepers do
He'd the worst face that ever I saw
The things that he said were unpleasant
In the teeth of his fury I said
""Sooner than part from the mountains
I think I would rather be dead""

He called me a louse and said ""Think of the grouse""
Well i thought, but I still couldn't see
Why all Kinder Scout and the moors roundabout
Couldn't take both the poor grouse and me
He said ""All this land is my master's""
At that I stood shaking my head
No man has the right to own mountains
Any more than the deep ocean bed

She was fair as the Rowan in bloom
And the bloom of her eye watched the blue Moreland sky

I went for a ramble instead

The way that I feel with you by my side?
Everyone can see that you are good for me
I always dreamed some day I'd find you
Now I can put my arms around you
And everyone agrees that you are good for me

Yes, I think I do deserve you
Yes, I think I really earned you
And now it seems every cliche is true
I can be good for you too

I'll tell you a story of love lost and found
There's no-one else for me now you are around
And everyone can see that you are good for me
Cut me adrift in the bluest of skies
I'm so close to heaven, it was such a surprise

Kirsty MacColl,"Every Friday night she rides the whole way over town
Just to see some stupid boy who never turns around
He never sees the girl whose dreams have told her he's the one
Still she gets excited whenever Friday comes
There is no reason in love's sweet plan
It's deeper than the sea
Things happen, we fall in love
It just comes naturally

Anyone who saw her in the street would never know
The passion of the feeling she never puts on show
We can not choose the ones with whom we think that we belong
Just when you're not looking someone comes along

There is no reason in love's sweet plan
It's deeper than the sea
Things happen, we fall in love
It just comes naturally

There she stands, clothes around her feet
Choosing what to wear so she can just stand in his street
""please, oh please, this time I'll make him mine""
She begs of her reflection in her dressing table shrine

Oh, there is no reason in love's sweet plan
It's deeper than the sea

With the trees on fire it looks like home
I'm an autumn girl on the endless search for summer
Cause I need some love to cook my frozen bones
You needed something to get your teeth into
And in my voodoo kitchen you said
""I've got something to show you,
It's a recipe handed down from father to son
For a thousand years, and it goes with those hot salt tears.""

I'm an autumn girl, crying over london
With a heart on fire but no-one home
I'm an autumn girl on the endless search for summer
Cause I need some love to heat my frozen bones

Get me on the boil and reduce me
To a simmering wreck with a slow kiss
To the back of my neck
Carve up my heart on a very low flame
Separate my feelings then pour them down the drain
Close my eyes and sweeten me with lies
Pierce my skin with a few well chosen words
Now you can stuff me with whatever you've got handy
And on a cold grey day a cold grey man will do

I'm an autumn girl, flying over london
With the trees on fire it looks like home
I'm an autumn girl on the endless search for summer
Cause I need some love to heat my frozen bones

So give me something to whet my appetite
And chill my soul with a sudden lack of interest
Oh, but the winter freezes on and the candle's burned low
Fill me with the hot stuff then say you've got to go
Take my mind, marinade it in red wine
Grate my thighs with your chinny chin chin

That my heart could be ruled by my brain

Kirsty MacColl,"I'm staying home this evening
And playing my guitar
And all the time I'm strumming
I'm wondering where you are
Oh yes I know it's over
I know I shouldn't care
But I can't get away from you
It seems you're always there

How come I don't see you anymore?
How come we lost the magic touch?
Why can't I pick up the telephone
When I want to call you so much?
Who's going to make me forget you
And get you off my mind?
I could be out breaking other people's hearts
If you weren't still breaking mine

The winter's drawing in again
Another year has passed
Now I think of things I meant to say
But the time went by so fast
I hear you're living in new york these days
And you don't come here any more
I keep asking myself so many questions
But lately I wonder what I'm wondering for

Who's going to make me forget you
And get you off my mind?
I could be out breaking other people's hearts
If you weren't still breaking mine

I let you pass me by
I never tried too hard
Though you'll never see me cry
You really made your mark

How come I don't see you anymore?
How come we lost the magic touch?
And why can't I pick up the telephone
When I want to hear your voice so much?
Who's going to make me forget you
And get you off my mind?
I could be out breaking other people's hearts
If you weren't
If you weren't still breaking mine
",Other People's Hearts,2005
Kirsty MacColl,"Just dropped in, I was driving past
You know I missed you since I saw you last
It gets lonely since you haven't been around
Little things don't make me cry
But still I think you could have told me why
You had to move out to the other side of town

Ah you caught me out
Ah you caught me out
But when I saw you walking out the door
You know I just couldn't take any more
I started crying

Every night I lie awake
Afraid what shape my dreams might take
I call your name out but I never hear a sound
You could say there's no love lost
But now I sit down and I count the cost
I wasn't ready to surrender what I found

Ah you caught me out
Ah you caught me out
But when I saw you walking out the door
You know I just couldn't take any more
I started crying

It doesn't seem there's any way
To say the things I wanna say
It's too late for me to explain I love you

Ah you caught me out
Ah you caught me out
But when I saw you walking out the door
You know I just couldn't take any more
I started crying

Ah you caught me out
I started crying

Kirsty MacColl,"(kirsty maccoll)
You've been around for such a long time now
Or maybe I could leave you but I don't know how
And why should I be lonely every night
When I can be with you, oh yes you make it right

And I don't listen to the guys who say
That you're bad for me and I should turn you away
Cause they don't know about us
And they've never heard of love

I get a feeling when I look at you
Wherever you go now I want to be there too
They say we're crazy but I just don't care
And if they keep on talkin' still they get nowhere

So I don't mind if they don't understand
When I look at you and you hold my hand
Cause they don't know about us
And they've never heard of love

Why should it matter to us if they don't approve
We should just take our chances while we've got nothing to lose

Baby
There's no need for living in the past
Now I found good loving gonna make it last
I tell the others don't bother me
Cause when they look at you they don't see what I see

No I don't listen to their wasted lines
Got my eyes wide open and I see the signs
But they don't know about us
And they've never heard of love

No I don't listen to their wasted lines
Got my eyes wide open and I see the signs
But they don't know about us

Aankho kaa thaa qasur chhuri dil pe chal ga i

Dono pe shabaab hai umr ye kharaab hai
Shauq shaayari kaa hai sher ye kisi kaa hai
Dekhaa jo husn-e-yaar tabiyat machal ga i

Teri-meri dosti
Pyaar me badal ga i

Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down
Everybody's gonna leave their seat

Movin' fast, doin' ninety five
Hit top speed but I'm still movin' much too slow
I feel so good, I'm so alive
I hear my song playin' on the radio
It goes

Get up
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down
Everybody's gonna leave their seat

Twelve o'clock, I gotta rock
There's a truck ahead, lights starin' at my eyes
Oh my God, no time to turn
I got to laugh 'cause I know I'm gonna die
Why

Get up
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get up
Everybody's gonna leave their seat",Detroit Rock City (Live Australia '80),1987

I'm feelin' low, so get me high

Shock me, make me feel better
Shock me, put on your black leather
Shock me, we can come together

And baby, if you do what you've been told
My insulation's gone, girl you make me overload

Don't pull the plug on me, no, no
Keep it in and keep me high

Shock me, make me feel better
Shock me, put on your black leather
Shock me, we can come together
Come on

Shock me, baby, shock me, oh yeah
Shock me, baby, shock me, oh yeah

Shock me, make me feel better, oh yeah
Come on and shock me, put on your black leather
Baby, I'm down to the bare wire
Shock me, we can come together

Kiss,"Many years since I was here, on the street I was passin' my time away 
To the left and to the right, buildings towering to the sky 
It's outta sight in the dead of night 
Here I am, and in this city, with a fistful of dollars 
And baby, you'd better believe 

[Chorus]
I'm back, back in the New York Groove 
I'm back, back in the New York Groove 
I'm back, back in the New York Groove 
Back in the New York Groove, in the New York Groove 

In the back of my Cadillac 
A wicked lady, sittin' by my side, sayin' 'Where are we?' 
Stop at Third and Forty-three, exit to the night 
It's gonna be ecstacy, this place was meant for me 

Feels so good tonight, who cares about tomorrow 
So baby, you'd better believe
