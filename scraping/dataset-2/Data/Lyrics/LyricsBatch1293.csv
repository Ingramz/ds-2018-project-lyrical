Young Thug,"Pussy niggas actin' like they never had shit
All these bitches actin' like they never had shit
I got a bad bitch, she said she always had shit
All these flawless diamonds, yeah they're lookin' glassy
Catch that nigga slippin', I'ma do 'em nasty
Check out my attire, this expensive fabric
We can wrestle just like Randy Savage
My jewelry as cold as an attic
The kush that I smoke'll blow your lungs out
I'ma walk in and clutch it like it's a war house
All your bitches that's busted, they live in your house
What goes up, come down, my nigga, north south
I done ran up them M's without a tour now
She done stepped up her game, Christian couture now
These niggas thought that they knew it but they don't know it now
I swear to God they're pursuin' at all my shows now

Hopped out my bed and hopped right in a foreign
Bitch don't get close, this a mothafuckin' warning
Suck that dick good, I'm the mothafuckin' warden
She runnin' away from my weed like it farted
She don't wanna swallow so I put it on her neck
I beat that pussy up, she loud as a parade
I got 1 million but only 10 in the bank
I taste a sample, I only buy if it's dank
I cook fishscale, and sang to her at the same time like Tank
I was born in '91, 23 years old, with a whole lotta stank
(5 star mothafucka)
Baby can you feel my pain?
All my diamonds need to be drained
I got a gangsta bitch that's gon' bang
And I got racks up, I can't complain
And all my dogs, they're dirty, check for mange
And all I gotta do is reserve your brains
And I'm a gangsta, my nuts, they gone hang
Who said you was straight? Boy you need to be retained

I swear to God they're pursuin' at all my shows now

Took the Rollie off, put the Breitling back on
Walk in the room and I cut the lights on
Why you spending like that? Cause I ain't ever had shit
This that real nigga PaperWrap, YSL shit
Never loved a bitch but I love money
In the church payin' my tithes with drug money
Went and got a new plug, got mama a new house
And a couple new coupes, that's how a young nigga live
Couple bitches, good weed that how a nigga chill
Top floor, penthouse, still crackin' seals
Them Houston niggas be like, ""That young nigga trill""
Them New York niggas say ""That young nigga ill""
My mama always told me dress to kill
My uncle always told me pack the steel
That nigga Thugger, that's my mothafuckin' brotha
From a motherfuckin' other, I'ma show you how to make magic
The fuck is you mad at?
Got your bitch dancin' all in my spot with no panties
I said, ""Bitch where your mothafuckin' man at?
Fuck that, where your friends at?"" Dammit
Sold 50 p's, hold it, have to bag it
That little bitch you lovin' on, I been had it
Pull up in a new drop, that thang nasty
Mama call all my big booty bitches trashy

You gotta see what your boss say

I ain't know what that mean
I bumped heads with my dean
Dropped out and hit the scene
Now I'm stunting like bling
Time and time again they told me no
They told me I wouldn't go
Cause in high school all I cared about was hoes
Well, maybe that shit was my interest
Now I spend more than they make at my dentist
After one night the folks thought I was finished
I pin my name to the game like a seamstress
Oh, bitch I bite like a gator
Fuck them reviews that they put in the paper
Did what I wanted, didn't care about a hater
Delivered my tape to the world as it cater
Oh, they fuck with me cause I'm different

When they killed my nigga Snupe, I seen my young nigga
In the casket he ain't even have no blood in him
Prolly the reason why I keep taking these drugs quicker
Ain't got no patience for these motherfuckin' fuck niggas
I watch everybody change, they thought I lost it
But now they all bustin' U-ies it's goin' cost 'em
I seen Chino shut the casket on the coffin (Truce)
Killed his only big brother and we lost him
So I'mma hold it down 'til we all win
We've been at the clear port ballin'
I just want to see my niggas flossin'

If you keep it trill you'll get a blessing for it
Deep down in the trenches with that Wesson on me
My mama, she can't sleep, I come here early mornings (mama)

Gotta watch my own homies on the roster
'Cause this the type of money get your lined up
And I can't trust nobody
They hit your homie and they knocked the soul out him
They said that they would ride or die but ain't nobody roll 'bout him

I wan' see my brother with the Patek not the static
Gucci wrap your toe up, got retarded with my daddy
All they seen was red bottoms bleeding by the casket
Perkys got me focused, I done noticed all the damages
I don't see no purpose, in the county eating sandwiches
Lost so many niggas, I went crazy, I couldn't balance it
You can't question God, yeah yeah, these challenges
Sipping on this Actavis, I swear I gotta manage it

North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

I want to see your face in every kind of light
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes
In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two

Through all of my life
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you

Young Thundering Herd,"She gets too hungry for dinner at eight 
She likes the theatre and never comes late 
She never bothers with people she'd hate 
That's why the lady is a tramp 

Doesn't like crap games with barons or earls 
Won't go to Harlem in ermine and pearls 
Won't dish the dirt with the rest of the girls 
That's why the lady is a tramp 

She likes the free, fresh wind in her hair 
Life without care 
She's broke, and it's ok

Hates California, it's cold and it's damp 
That's why the lady is a tramp 

She gets too hungry to wait for dinner at eight 
She loves the theatre but never comes late 
She'd never bother with people she'd hate 
That's why the lady is a tramp 

She'll have no crap games with sharpies and frauds 
And she won't go to Harlem in Lincolns or Fords 
And she won't dish the dirt with the rest of the broads 
That's why the lady is a tramp 

She'd love the free, fresh wind in her hair 
Life without care 
She's broke, but it's ok

Hates California, it's so cold and so damp 
That's why the lady

Young Tru,"[Chorus: Nelly]
I see you niggas ain't renting and leasing these cars
Fronting like you buy and buy and buy and buy 'em
Claiming that you making so much paper but I know
That I know that you a liar liar liar liar
Let a grand hang out, let a grand hang out
Dip deep into your pockets, let a grand hang out
Let a grand hang out, let a grand hang out
If you balling then quit the stalling, let a grand hang out

[Nelly]
Uhh, uhh, uhh, see'mon!
Hey yo, I pull up so aggressive nigga, hopping out the thing
Ice dripping wet like I just hopped up out the rain
My picture perfect pose like I hopped up out a frame
Ain't a coach on the planet that can take me out the game
My heart beats forever like my name was Eddie King
A Midwest rider like my dirty Jesse James
The CEO of dirty and he go by Cornell Haynes
Mean-mugging all you niggas like I hopped up out your dame
I'm like uh-oh, there he go-oh
A hundred and twenty up Natural Bridge in that Mo-Mo
Slipping and sliding, look how he riding pass the po-po
He blazing that fire behind the {?} they don't know-oh
Whoo! I'm really thinking of changing my name to Krispy Kreme
I'm do-nuts nigga, let me tell you what I mean
I'm paper chasing, chasing the paper, you chasing dreams
My money gettin stronger like it's takin Creatine

[Chorus]

[Young Tru]
My pockets like Wyclef Jean, the +Fu-gees+
We them locksmith boys, we keep a few ki's
Caterpillar pimp, that butterfly whores
Lamborghini spreewells, butterfly doors
Some'n like McDonald's when I move in packs
Quarter-Pound Supersized bullets and Big Mac's
House longer than I-70, arise ten stories
And I still ""Rob"" niggas just like Horry
Everybody hate on Young Tru boy
Cause they know that the nigga on fire fire fire fire
Rap phenomenon, soon as the album drop
artists don't eat like the month of Ramadan
Dirty this, dirty that, guess I'm a Dirty cat
Selling niggas some chickens, rob 'em get the birdies back
Plumber of the game, that flood the state
In a stretch Phantom, with more Windows than Bill Gates

[Chorus]

[Nelly] 
Uhh, uhh, Joey Crack!

[Fat Joe]
Yeah, they lease and we buy 'em, we peace and they crime
They dying cause we street, keep heat, and keep firing
y'all know, top of the world's my motto 
Anna Kournikovia, baby girl's my model 
All I wanted in life is to be a soldier
Now you can find me with chicks just doing yoga
Meditation that Marley, the hydraulicals
You heard Big, go check the Brown, they might hire you
High definition to any form of telecast
Me and young dirty got plenty hoes and hella cash
All I need is a minute to ""Shatter Your Dreams""
And we about to sell more than Avril Lavigne (bitch!)
And all I do is rep the hood where the jugs be
Can't help it if the folks at MTV love me
y'all see the T.S. we shining, come to the be-X we grinding
y'all want to be us keep trying, we buying, he's lying

Uh, uh, ladies!

[Remy Martin]
We like, fuck, that; I need a stack
And like, forty-nine to go with that
I'm quick to, tell a hoe her flow is wack
The type to, cop the jersey, throw it back
See I can stunt and tell a chick ""Yo let your man hang out""
Since he fronting like it's nothing, let a grand hang out
Fuck a handout, I been getting ? since way back
Can't wait to see they faces when I drop the Maybach
You lying, you claim you buying but you renting and leasing
If you pimping and niggas spending, where's the paper you seeing?
Stop stalling, I'm balling, call me Sheryl Swoops
Can't stand the backseat driver, that's why I cop the Coupe
Yeah, I been testing law with the darkest tints
So explicit valet had to tip to park the shit 
I'm like a, block away and the whip be starting 
Oh God, it's Remy Martin!

Young Wicked,"To all that are receiving this broadcast we are now entering our
Thirteenth hour of continuing cloud coverage. This ongoing event has been
Upgraded to a national emergency. It has been a sleepless night here in Metro
Detroit as panic and terror has swept the streets. It seems much of Detroit
As well as the rest of the country are still unsettled by this unexplainable
Cloud that still clutches the sky. From New York to Honolulu, Miami to
Fairbanks the expansion of the cloud has subsided but a wall of darkness and
Artificial night still grips the land. Witnesses now tell us that thousands
Upon thousands of people are emerging from sewers everywhere their faces are
Painted and they look like CLOWNS!!! The people are running and screaming but
Eye witnesses say they're not in pain its almost like a strange type of joy
Has overtaken them. At this time we do not know where or why the people are
Running but there seems to be an organized plan directing there action. Its
Like a guiding force is giving them supernatural stamina. The immense crowd
Of clowns are now on the move all in unison moving in one direction towards
An unknown destination. Its almost as if they see what others cannot heeding
An inaudible call that silently pierces this calm before the storm.",Intro,2015

Young Zee,"Yeah, big Strick, let's get it on
Yo, last night I had a nightmare that I was wack
Nope, I'm sorry, it's that you said something dope
Fuck it, it don't matter, 'cause I know shit ain't really like that
'Cause if you said something dope, I know somebody else probably had to write that
You on the wrong song an' I'm on the right track
I hit the cypher, and you bounce talkin' 'bout ""Strick, I'll be right back!""
What the fuck you comin' back for?
I pulled up to the front of the club and hurried and scurried up out the back door
Just in time 'fore your ass got a cracked jaw
Made 'cause I stack more, and what the Lakers sign Shaq for?
Incredible rhymer, what the hell am I sell crack for?
I'm real, you a ac-tor, I'm hot, you just not a fac-tor
You on some bound to do, I'm on some already done shit
I'll burn you with the same light you just lit up your blunt wit'
And I don't came wit' the style you probably 'bout to come wit'
You the opposite of smart feces, get it? Dumb shit
Couldn't give a fuck who you run wit'
Or them niggas you 'bout to go get
Matter of fact, go get 'em, you'll just be layin' on the floor wit' 'em
Lookin' up at me talkin' 'bout: ""Why you let the fo-fo hit 'em?
I really don't know these niggas, I just did a show wit' 'em
Went back to the telly and I hit a couple of hoes wit' em
Met 'em at the studio an' just spit a couple of flows wit' 'em
Bought a bag of dro and just sat back and got high wit' 'em""
Oh yeah, that's good to know, now you 'bout to die wit' 'em
Head straight to the pearly gate, say hi to the big guy wit' 'em
Or take it to that other level, down with the devil and fly wit' 'em
Grumble and groan, piss and moan, boo-hoo and cry wit' 'em
Atleast go home and tell his momma bye bye wit' 'em (bye, momma)
'Cause duke, I'm the hottest nigga on earth right now
And bust my gun in nine months 'bout to give birth right now
Run all up in a nigga hood and take his turf right now
Nothing's what your life is worth right now
I've been in shit for too long, it's about time I burst
A & R's ready to quit 'cause they ain't find me first
Record labels ready to shut down 'cause they ain't sign me first
So let me stop right now 'cause I know y'all niggas be dieing to be writing my verse

[Chorus]
If y'all don't know how we get sent on
From twelve at night to the cracks o' dawn
Got girls in the back takin' off they thongs
Then feelin' that something's wrong!

If y'all don't know how we get sent on
From twelve a.m. to the early morn'
If you seen them things then blow ya horn
'Cause if ya not there's something wrong!

I came outta rap training camp as a reigning champ
An' lay motherfuckers down just like the pain of a cramp
I won't stop 'till I see my name and my face on a stamp
And y'all still won't be able to stick me or fuck wit' me
I'm 'bout to leave my mark on this game like a buck fifty
Took shots but I duck swiftly, you just missed me
Fuck Alice, ????, Norton and fuck Trixie
I'ma fuck like it's my honeymoon 'till I touch sixty
You ain't a thug so don't try to get tough with me
If you think about tryna hit me, you'll get snuffed quickly
Deep down, hate Bobby Brown, but love Whitney
At times I wish it was O.J and the glove fit me
Then I wouldn't have to hear none of you wack niggas
Talk about how your crew's rich and you stack figures
In my hand's a chrome gun with a black trigger
I know you think your shit's big, but I pack bigger
Just ask your wife, 'cause I blasted her pipes
If I tell Strick to pass me a knife would you ask for your life?
You's a pussy, I can tell by your song
Homo/thug rapper, I can tell by your thong
Got sugar in your tank, you probably shit syrup
The world's about to see what it is when I hit Europe
And when I come back on for my birthday
I'ma do another video, too explicit to play

Ace, Zee, yo Strick, Bricks, Zee, Outsidaz, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Niggas fear me like the fear of Aids
I take out pretty boys wearin' shades
Or thug niggas with they hair in braides
Then fuck yo' girl through that thing she wearing
Get her pregnant to leave that bitch a single parent
Got mad cars, you probably apin' in a Jaguar
Drunk at Justin's, while you hang out at a fag bar
Scared at jail, but at home you tryna rob
When you got inside you got sodomized by a lotta guys
Girls pile up in Young Zee room
I fucked the wives of about twenty grooms on they honeymoons
We had a check sellin' bottles of rock
An' so much dope came we re-modeled the spot
That's why y'all cats be spittin' that shit from em
See you grinnin' when I stop and the rims keep spinnin'
Fuck with Zee I'll bash ya face
I'll fucks wit' Masta Ace, bitch",Something's Wrong,2001

Yeah, five X got me high to death
So high I can't even tell my right from left
If it's beef, right now we in trouble
'Cause all of us drunk and Young Zee seein' double

Shout to my dames in the house
Let us bash, knowin' my tape coming on
You can strip right now and get butt naked
'Cause doe come first nigga, a bitch come second

Right inside your stomach while you six months pregnant
Zee disrespect thugs, that want to flip drugs
Doe can't fuck with my checks though

Let me hear about a war, why'all get carried out the door
An' buried 'round the floor, you're feelin' kinda poor
Your belly drive a four
I push big chips, watch you ?????? an' I LOVE IT!

Pass me your blunt you gon' get it back torse
Pass me your 40, here take the back door

see'mon! Get your click's whipped
Football scores, we be 56 - zip
Neck crampin', sex slammin' (aha)
Fuck so much we need to get examined

Sit me down now, Zee and rotwilders
Two big dogs, you just a lil' dog like Bow Wow
Girls choose a wish, I'll ""fill your fantasy"" like Ludacris
Whilst your twat smells like tuna fish

Tonight, I could do it on my first night
No hotels, let's do it on my dirt bike
Just call and say when
You hate when I try to put it all the way in, but I LOVE IT!

Sixteen celly's and four pagers
Go hype up your squad that they might fuck with ours
I just light up cigars, go buy bikes, trucks and cars
Got axe n nitty in Atlanta deep
Ran the street, ten grand a week
I got one word, don't put ya man to sleep
And I love my jersey live bitches
They leave a nigga's, face with thirty five stitches
They'll help me, cinder blocks and pushin' kids so deep in the oceans
They see where octopuses live

This thing back on again.
Alright, perfect, God damn good.
Yo, this is Rondell Beene,
I'm back on the motherfuckin' scene,
And I'm upset as a motherfucker.
I mean first I didn't get paid for the D12 shit.
You heard me rippin' on there, they just edited my verse out.
Then I was on Obie's shit, I was in Obie's video,
And that Obie go ahead and I didn't get paid for that shit.
And now they got this bald head weed smokin' mother fucker,

Young Zee, keep movin' for the macs. Be cubin'.
Hmm? I'll make you sing like big Ruben.
Man, in the hood, I'm the American Idol.
First I fight you, and then run up on your stairs with a rifle.
Bang
Tech claims make you wipe out like X-Games
Next sprain's in your motherfuckin' leg bang?
Tryin' to shoot me like they tryin' to shoot 50.
Either you gon' die or need a new kidney.
Till I drop, I'm a sell to your friends.
Till I get some of that tin, in the federal pin.
I spit better than them.
Niggas wanna fight me, better go get in the gym
Or the metal'll spin. Since smokes' in 'Nam,
Doin' drugs than Eminem moms.

Flip your dumbass out the passenger side.",Commercial Break,2004
Young Zee,"Hit him up two times
Three'd be hat trick
Gave him more shots than the pediatrics
Came to his house and shot his left hand out
Left him with more scars than Mr. Def Jam South
To reach the sky, how far would a star go
To handle more cigars than a Cuban cargo
Makin money from everything I spoke in this
Wrapped by more ice than a broken wrist
Got ability to make missy a little tipsy
I'm more P.I.M.P than Mississippi (git it? Uh!)

I know you like to show off you're bust in gowns
'cause you go around jugglin guys nuts around
And we don't gotta wait till you're ass confesses
'cause you go around showing off you're ass in dresses
You watchin porn sittin there at you're macintosh
With you're hand in you're ass like you're jackin off
And you try goin harder than star wars Anakin
'cause you practice at you're house with a anus manikin

got a belt full of steel you can call me santa
You better keep your eyes peeled like a fuckin banana
And don't try to shoot me like some dumb retards
'cause I miss bullets like I'm sendin them e-cards 
Always equipped with the vest so don't aim for the bell-ay
'cause I dodge bullets like I play for LA
And I'm invisible 'cause you can't even see me son
But you're soft as shit I could shoot you with a bb gun
They call me stretch where I'm from 'cause I'm extended out
Find your ass in my house and I'll send it out
I got a custom made gun so the cops link my shot
So far.. how many mother fuckers do you think I got?

Young Zee,"I'm disgusted and dissatisfied, I don't need to fucking advertise
I'm a thief, I don't read the fucking classifieds
I like beef, I don't chitchat and fraternize
With police, pastors, or rabbis
I'm one of the bad guys, I never apologize
I don't just walk around with rocks and pocketknives
When it comes to homicide I'm not occupied
Murder's like oxygen to carbon dioxide
I don't know a lot about science and chemistry
My enemies take a lot of time and energy
When I'm not shooting I get iron deficiency
And I don't wanna have the guys look at me differently
I would rather have a gun than an epiphany
Can't really rely on tricks and wizardry
When I get irrational, that'll be practical
Niggas don't believe shit it's serendipity

Y'all in the presence of divine science
We don't subscribe to y'all theory of non-violence
I rule with an iron fist, I define tyrants
I went down the wrong path, that's despite guidance
Yeah and y'all are soon to bleed
And I'm from the house of wisdom Haroon Rashid
A goon indeed, ras-clat, Junior Reid
Y'all overstayed y'all welcome, y'all refused to leave
Refuse to see that the universe is deathless
I define rhyme with divine mind efforts
It's grind time, I design rhyme methods
It's high time y'all enshrine my records
And I don't know why y'all would fuck with the team
That's like standing on the block with no junk for the fiends
Pazienza is in love with the deen
I would jump in front of bullets, shed fucking blood for my team

I know what violence begets, timeless regrets
Silently sweat bullets when you ride for respect
Rivalry met with the vibe you'd expect
Four-pounder makes you flounder only live on the net
You know the Internet thuggery, Internet fuck with me
Long enough to see my company sucker-free luckily
Paz heard me then scooped me, spaz early [?]

Rap after the blood bath having a movie
Gats strapped to my blue jeans, [?]
Backpackers with Uzis, Black Sabbath and Kool G

Youngblood Hawke,"You say you won't wait forever on me
But I wouldn't make you wait that long

Sang drunk in my room Geronimo
Like an old great singer throat full of smoke
Shut the door to the attic, made myself a home
I pay no attention to what's down below

'Cause I don't want to break the bars
If I run they'll be a bust 'cause there's dogs on my tail
But my tracks are in the mud
And your Comanche spirit that's afraid to fail
Do everything you can now or you never will

You say you won't wait forever on me
But I wouldn't make you wait that long
You say you won't wait forever on me
But I wouldn't make you wait that long

So I followed all the trails to Monaco
Who the hell am I to tell you where to go?
Smokestacks and chimneys billow from my chest
Breaking into the house just to see what's left

'Cause time is watching all of us
And we all have the time
It's always on your mind
It's always on my mind

You say you won't wait forever on me
But I wouldn't make you wait that long

So don't you get scared, scared of nothing
'Cause I'm staying right here
Don't be afraid 'cause I won't leave you all alone

The path rolling to your door is a jungle
I'll be back because I never left

Down the dirty sidewalks stream
Dressed in their finest dreams
All the gold and revelry
Like the ghosts of New Orleans

Pupils bigger than the canyons in the sea
Darling, what would you do if you were me?
If you were me, twisted in the vines
Hoping that you would see

I'm feeling rootless in my wandering mind
Time is moving, it's moving

I see you creep into my room like smoke
Under my door, I can feel you in my throat
You ain't no good but you're good enough
I'll give you all my time but not my love

'Cause I'm trying to bring it home
But you're standing in my way
Bandits with red handkerchiefs
Covering their face

It takes a whole lot to shake
Don't get caught up in the time spent
You're walking round in circles
Asking where the time went

I'm feeling rootless in my wandering mind
Time is moving while I'm feeling rootless
Without you I am rootless, I am moving

I'm feeling rootless, so I keep on moving
I'm feeling rootless, so I keep on moving on

She be my last pick, I got a real hoe
Take yo' ass back to class and buy a dildo
Don't let the freak in you  keep you up all night
Gettin' fucked and sucked, you wastin' your life
Before a real nigga ever kick a hoe down
She gotta understand what I know now
Ain't no broke down, lazy, gold digging, cute bitch
Come around me gettin' credit cards and don't do shit, bitch
I travel throughout the year
I keep a woman with a house and her own career
So when I buy her a diamond ring, it's just a gift (what's your name?)

Tight jean and bra strap, girl that got to go (gotta go)
Strip you on down like a shake-a-booty hoe (uh huh)
Put you in the street, make me mo' money mo'

Now see, just the other night, I met me a ol' jazzy hoe
Straight boozyabitch, ol' sassy hoe
Who think she fly to death, so I ain't gon' hold my breath
To let you skeezers know, just let you ask yo'self
For as I cut one but two down the line
But could it be yo' hoe that I'm cuttin' everytime?
And I come to find she servin' every nigga in yo' clique
To get in where she fit in, now she known to be a trick

Hit the Club Jig, on some Wes Snipe shit
Snatchin' all the hoes in your harem, indeed
I mock turtlenecks while I'm bees and tweed
Til I proceed, damn right, the spot's tight
Nothing but dimes in sight, so just might
Bag these bitches like groceries
Player to player, you can't get close to me
Now who you 'posed to be?
Pullin' toast on the  S-O double N-Y, girlfriend lookin' fly
And I can tell she schemin' (why's that?)
Cause she like the ice is gleamin' (okay)

I got star hoes pickin' me up in Tahoes
Fuck them at-the-bar hoes, tryin'-to-score hoes
Mickey dropin' hoes, quick to drop they clothes

There's a cost to being brought up, and still I ain't gave a fuck
Not easier said than done, it don't matter how many come
They got you on the lock, striking men into your bums
Sometimes I had no fun, now the law done got me trapped
With my back against the wall, some waiting on me to turn it back
Now that is that, and this is this, and if you miss, you bound to slip
So watch that shit, just as they ship you, and pimp you, and dick you
Takin' you for granted, so nigga you'd besta handle it
Before they catch you slanted, don't panic, you on your own

These drawls had me gone, Victorias and perfume
See when it too much good, somethin' got to go bad
Just yesterday got my insurance and tag
Feelin' good never bad, on the way to see flat'
Tryin' to take it to the crib tell my folks bout the zag
Now see I'm in the Lac' so I ain't drivin' too fast
Just my luck, I creeps up on they ass
The police study beats, settin' up this road block
Found out the hard way it's only 10 o'clock
And ain't no room to shake the spot, plus everything tight
Gave em' all my shit, pulled over to the right
And what was said in my head ""Now I'm all fucked up""
Like my square, sir tell me what is all this for
I ain't did a damn thang, but I'm back in this wagon
Handcuffin' this clown ass nigga still braggin'
Ain't a damn thang funny, what the hell this be bout'
Tell me where the fuck I'm going, how the hell I get out

See we got that lil' bit, but rather spend it on dope
Now I'm out this bitch, see your ass in court

Hey what's up man, hey let me get one of them squares from you folk
I hope these niggas at the house man
Damn man ,these folk got me down here
Bout' some motherfuckin' driver's license man
What kinda shit is that man?
Made my hoe walk to the house

Tryin' to take it to the crib, and sit on my commode
They took my license, so now my shit is gone
But me and this Cadillac, we got a mind of our own
Wood grain, hill daddy tight
Ready to stomp the gas when I see a flashin' blue light
The reason that we ride like this, ain't got the funds to get the right
Police be takin' out your ass, cash low
Ain't got no place to stash my dope, at the time
Either yours or mine, stay down on da' grind
Servin' niggas with the dope from a blunt to a line
Throw my shit in the bushes make it hard to find
It's 6 to 14 and I ain't fuckin' around

I can't help but just to be that nigga, the nigga you can't fuck wit'
Now what the hell, just done happened, as I'm lost in this shit
Off in these cuts, doing what I gotta do, just as I reap bail
And break bail, up out these jail cells, see what I do well
And dat' is your last remark
So don't you start comin' around up here up after dark
Thinkin' you hard, with no regard, cause see I'm a' hit you where it hurts

Choose on the Attic Crew, my girl already been chose
These stankin' bitches get your boy caught up in that fuck shit
I know they suckin dick, but they thanking the game I spit
I put they ass in a rap and ride out on them hoes
Get wit' my slick partna' then hit the studio

We ain't scared, prepared to take this thang to the streets
Capric-e and Fleetwood ride good Vouges with the beat
You might no understand a damn thang that I speak
I'm slizzard as hell, might stomp your punk ass to sleep
And when this thang get crunk, I pack it up and take it to the lab
Hit that gentlemen's club, and grab a couple of hoes off on the ass
Laugh if you will, thank its funny but it ain't
What the fuck you gonna do, when they hit you, stick you for your bank
>From the freeze-tag to the Fleetwoods, from the two door to the four door
Who got the leather, who got the cloth, who got the Vougues
With all the hoes, who got the gold, who got that grain
Who got the green, who got the chains, who got the bitch
I got the Fleetwood, girls most likely to complain
See somethangs can't be explained, how we really do this man
Hit the lab, make it talk, now you here me once again
Have you jumpin' and shakin', like you off in that blue flame
what's really going on holmes, can you really tell me man

Oh really now, though whose to say that we won't never make it
Or even get the chance to tell the world just how we made it
Cause know that we gonna keep it crunk, no matter what 
Now who the fuck, just al nut, it's a must for you to get crushed
So don't rush to get dat' change
You'd besta wake on up and take a look inside this frame
For everything ain't everything when times are gettin' rough
To pressure is your conscience in this game you callin' bluff
Now nigga what, yeah

Oh, a lot of hatin' went on doing this thang here
Folks just swore we wasn't finna' put it down for the A-town
You know what I'm saying? I ain't gotta call no names
Cause you know who you are
You know what I'm sayin'
All I got to say to all of y'all is...
You can't keep nobody from the Attic down
Know what I'm sayin', and that's on the floor

Yea, it's me, remember me from back in the day
The same ol' nigga you thought wouldn't get paid
Look at me now nigga, shit done changed
Ain't no mo' gettin' wet in the rain
Hennessey and dank to kill all my pain
Sho' nuff' you can hear, but you can't feel me man
And it's a damn shame, we go through what we do
Playa hatin' while I'm chillin' on the avenue
Can't hold no nigga down from the Attic Crew
that's for trill on the blow, straight from me to you
Better listen up now, cause ain't no tellin' what's next
The dem' between real and the ones that flex
All in your face grinnin' when you cash that check
But when they get down and dirty it's like ""fuck dat' bitch""
Ass nigga, so how you figga' I was wrong
Got a baby, and a crib to keep clothes on
Long time ago, way before the grind
Trouble had become a friend of mine
You off up in my head, its just a matter of time
Before I rip shit apart and let Sean Paul shine
Like dem' folks open face off in yo' grill

Oh I can get mo money, mo money, don't come to me
And everything I say that be on the blow
Rap for the love of money, stack it up once mo'
Going once, going twice, got the O for the LOW
Got my cheese in the soil, tryin' to make my flow grow
Hell no, never fall off
Slip pimpin', you can get it hard or get it soft
All day, round the clock tryin' to get it in
I ain't worried bout' the rich, cause I'm in the wind
All I got is my folks, Lord forgive me for my sins
And if this ain't for me, please make me thank again
Gotta get my shit right, tight like these gurls draws
Let me recognize the game, and all the flaws
While I'm out here, please let me come up
And watch my every step so I don't have to duck
Never wanted this, damn how a nigga stuck?
Hit me on the hill nigga, I'm a' sack it up
Rabbit on my head all day for good luck
On the hustle everyday, but who really gives a fuck

So what you got, when you ain't got nothing to show
Thangs movin' slow, can't get your hands on no blow
Ain't got no flow, naw, need some quick cash
If hustlin' is the answer nigga, get up off your ass

I walk about the crib, with my mind on the dough
Been hustlin' these verses, ain't got a damn thang to show
I keep my head up, because I feel it's bout to pop
Done heard about a deal going down at the dock
Critics say it don't stop, til' you get it and it's gone
It's all about the fett', set it off, get it crunk
You catch me on the corner, I'll be buddy with the sacks
Off in the studio it be Twayne with the tracks
Fire, fire, like that dope gettin' smoked everyday
Got a call from my source, he on the way with the llell' (yeah)
Coming in from overseas, bout' 82 ki's
Not a word to be said, everybody hit your knees, lets leave
Get the cheese, make away with the blow
Slip in the door, right before we do the show
Mr. Dope Man, your looking kinda sick
Thangs movin' slow now that you ain't got shit

hook

So what you got now, you out of luck
Sellin' your soul to the devil, just to make a quicker buck
But for what, you took a chance, receiving half of some blow
And pushing them quarter ki's underground to keep the flow
It's toe to toe, we can take it to the deepest of the seas
And anybody else who want to bite, then try a piece
Of these Youngbloodz, bustin' 30 slugs, so just perhaps
You crawlin' out of a shell
Finding ways up out these traps
Like craps, you out to gamble, losing everything you own
And still like to pretend as if this game gonna keep em' known
And do know, you in a ball of burning hell
So might as well take a ride on the weed into the A-T-L
And niggas swear we outdone and out-gunned
So what's the first attempt when they got you on the run
With fun, they shootin' tons of shots, so whose to blame
Nobody but yourself as you hold inside the pain

I got my mind on my money, my money on my mind
(Got my mind on my money, and my money on my mind)
I got my mind on my money, my money on my mind
(Got my mind on my money, and my money on my mind)


I got my mind on my money, my money on my mind
The thing I got I sell it, to get it all the time
A nickel or a dime, a half or a pound
Long as my bitch ridin', I'll put a nigga down
I'm a playa from the jump, a hustler from the start
Something in your chest, then open up your heart
I'm 'bouta bet it, like Memphis 10, they get it get it
Gotta have it have it, take it all, man if they let me
Ima run it, put somethin' on it, instead of bet it
It's that money, don't make no money, buddy I'm ready
Can I get it? It's win or lose, you know the rules
We rollin', we didn't hit it, now pay your dues

Now when it comes to gettin' that cash flow
I'm all about that paper, no credit, just straight dough
And for all who don't know, there's money out to be made
So get it while you can, and still it's just a phase
In the eyes of a hustler nigga, you'd be amazed
That time waits for no one, so God, I pray
Try hard not to fall through life stuck unemployed
So instead I keep on livin' what's given within my void
Put a end after hours scrapin' up all my change
From quarters to dimes, as you see, this ain't no game
So pick up on your pimpin', get on it and never slip
'Cause all on my mind is my money fully gripped (fully gripped)

[Chorus]

Just call me, the money maker, bread taker
Nigga Breaker, the pocket raper, money scraper
May do me a favor, stay the fuck up out my way-a
The rock that I can take it buddy to collect my paper
That might save ya, think of no anger, no player hater
No bumpin' heads, when it come to gettin' this paper
I'm a player, runnin' wit the, hand that was dealt
Flippin' my work, ridin' the left, fully equipped
Ain't fuckin' wit hoes, unless talkin 'bout bread
Duckin' these streets, givin' these strangers some head
Bringin' it back, makin' sho', my pockets swole
Workin' the streets, now they know they my hoes

I must ain't had it, I gotta get it
Nothin' to lose, shoot me a quarter, and watch me flip it
Shakin' these haters down the line, they somethin' wicked
You on a roll then pay yo' dues, then buy a ticket
Gather your cheddar 'round this world, there's nothin' better
But keep it boomin' like a system, through any weather
Stackin' my green, that's somethin' good, I'm on a mission
Trappin' hard just like I should, no penny pinchin'
And for the gold, we steady missin', and reminisin'
Buy some S, ain't even hittin', so stop yo' flippin
'Cause when I pull in all my cheese you besta know
There ain't no playin' wit my thang when you see my foe
Act like ya know

[Chorus: Cutty]
I'm chillin, wood spinnin
No Bentley's, Cadillac pimpin
I'm cruisin, hoes choosin
That's cool 'cause I'm Cadillac pimpin
Spoke spinnin, gold grillin
Liquor spillin, Cadillac pimpin
Keep ridin, car slidin
That's cool 'cause I'm Cadillac pimpin

[J-Bo]
Now as I grip and dive, I smoke on to keep a high
In the sky, as I emphasize the right to reply
With these words you under heard I swerve through a blur
Dodging these fuck niggaz who figure we outta splurge
And if happen to have the nerve, see homeboy you made a choice
For the crime you standing on and walking on is getting poise
Plus the Cadillac's we pimpin so slightly you been slippin
On really how it goes when these ties begin to grippin
And shiftin and whole takin to the spot where hoes shakin
I'm quakin, ridin on out - am I gon make it?
And pimp fool like niggaz with gataz without no chaperone
So see, we been doing this from way back long
'92, aqua blue, on them thangs we roll
With a cup full of liquor blowing good on swole
So let's ride til we can't ride no damn more
We Cadillac pimpin hard see my nigga fa sho'

[Chorus]

[Sean Paul]
Sure be white Cadillac but I called it to go
This your boy Sean Paul, baby tell 'em the truth
So roll Old Fleetwood with the two door coup
All platinum bill with the fifth wheel too
And give truth to these suckas something overdue
Ride a 'Lac like a true playa 'posed to do
Old school, slant back with a jigga too
Tan gold wit some bows like a poster boo
Old school, gold chain, still grippin the grain
Show a crease in my jeans, stay ahead of the game
Got a, piece on my grill, diamonds off in the back
And got so many hoes had to change up my 'Lac
All day I don't know how to act
Got this game down pat, sure be running the track
Get some money from these hoes and see how they react
Show 'em how a real nigga come down like that

[Chorus]

[Sean Paul]
I got a 'Lac with a rag, Louie Baton top
Diamond cut interior, 15's the knot
I'ma be a last nigga from the ATL
y'all hell, feel eyes and the playa can sell
When you see me in the street, holla at me playa
My bitch got duke, e, rose and wine, boo as fine as hell
Through the strip'll never die, only time'll tell
To be in, it's Cadillac steerin wheel

[J-Bo]
Say what, gather round for this two door show
We let the spillin go, rillin in the Eldorado
We rollin through the spot to see which hoes gon follow
'cause we get cool and down passin rounds of bottle
With a gloss so clean, I put this thing in throttle
For we out and cruise in the wind like roscoe
So you gonna know us when you see us when we ride on by slow
'cause this shit'll never end through the eyes of my foes

Nigga Breaker, the pocket raper, money scraper
May do me a favor, stay the fuck up out my way-a
The rock that I can take it buddy to collect my paper
That might save ya, think of no anger, no player hater
No bumpin' heads, when it come to gettin' this paper
I'm a player, runnin' wit the, hand that was dealt
Flippin' my work, ridin' the left, fully equipped
ain't fuckin' wit hoes, unless talkin 'bout bread
Duckin' these streets, givin' these strangers some head
Bringin' it back, makin' sho', my pockets swole
Workin' the streets, now they know they my hoes

[J-Bo]
I must ain't had it, I gotta get it
Nothin' to lose, shoot me a quarter, and watch me flip it
Shakin' these haters down the line, they somethin' wicked
You on a roll then pay yo' dues, then buy a ticket
Gather your cheddar 'round this world, there's nothin' better
But keep it boomin' like a system, through any weather
Stackin' my green, that's somethin good, I'm on a mission
Trappin' hard just like I should, no penny pinchin'
And for the gold, we steady missin', and reminisin'
Buy some S, ain't even hittin', so stop yo' flippin
'cause when I pull in all my cheese you besta know
There ain't no playin' wit my thang when you see my foe
Act like ya know

[Intro]
Hey what's happenin' baby
What's your name girl?
Tequila?
Oh yeah, my friends call you Cuervo
You alright with me baby... fo' real

[Chorus]
now let me tell you about this girl Tequila
she was born in eighteen hundred
she makes me feel real woozy
sometimes sick to my stomach (ohhh)
but I love this girl Tequila
one shot of her love, it's over
she takes all my money
and all I want to do is hold her....Tequila
my Mexican lover

[Verse 1]
I cannot forget her, my Mexican lover
with that and its strong, can mix her up with no other
her name Tequila, we met in October
I hit her all the time, I can't sleep on your sofa
one hit and it's over, the girl's addictive
we stay at the bar 'cause she ain't that expensive
don't give me no problems when I'm with her
nice brown tone, she got me slither
my girl tequila, a jump me you say so
I'll serve you what ever you pay for
her nickname Quevo, eighteen honda
she got you woozy, got you sick to the stomach
the girl's a club hoe, a two shine dub hoe
not far from a drug hoe, get your back by the PO-PO
you're fuckin' with quevo, the girls a killer
I'll have you at the bar takin' shots of Tequila
my Mexican lover..

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
see I'm so true pursuing, straight getting right to it
on late nights we get tight, in ways I can't refuse it
like cupids, we undisputed, and together ruthless
and all the other hoes feelin' low, lookin' stupid
thought we was, we was two of a kinda cuttin'a rug
in back of the club, two of the most dangerous thugs
soakin' up your brain, driving you insane
and leaving you to lay on your back constrained
with no complaint, she's off the chain like no other
my Mexican lover, the only one on my covers
like hustlers, she got me tipsy she's got me voo-doo
and damn near foolish and one more gonna have me coo-coo
and kicked up 'til I'm tore up now what's the hold up
it's on now we back up on it, just as we post up
slither at the bar damn drunk to the world
burnin' down the club callin' on your boy Earl

Ain't no more room for them ain't nothing to debate
Just let them fight for it something they never heard
We keep it fight for them precise with every word

I'm screamin' at it nigga just watch where I swerve
We runnin' havoc nigga bangin' on every curve

We makin' blood on the niggas don't want to take it there
ATL runnin' things you goobers stack your chains
Moe back off in this thing jump off put in the game

We are known for being sold in a click foolish as mine
Cigarillo bustin' choppin' hoes down the line
Hatin' if you like us still the sun gone shine
Add a coupe the feature your request goes rewind
Like play action we stay ahead of the game
Runnin' through your whole league and still a catch the grain

'Cause this that real shit that make you act a fool
Where you straighten out that nigga and tell that bitch be cool

[Rome's 1st verse]
I'm tryna get it playa
I'll make em feel it playa
What chu hatas tryna do 
Rome already did it playa

My wheels spin like a Farris wheel
Since my days of youth 
I was bumpin dolla bills
You niggas kno it's real

And imam tight and still
Only I was 8 when I signed why 1st deal
It's in my genetics to neva be a jealous man
'Cause a jealous man is part feminine 

I'm half amazing my homeys blazin
And dey don't hit the club till they look Asian
See you could blind fold em wit a shoe string
Niggas tryna study how I try ta do thangs

Wit cha blue wings like the water in grill Jamaica
And we far from fakas see cake like bakas
Hatas cannot break us 
Ralph can't forsake us
'Cause we built the legacy like the LA Lakers

Now do I look like I care do I look like I give a damn
Say whatchu say or whatchu want when you the bottom man

So dig it we ova here just doin what we like
Not stuttin whatchu yellin

[Romes 2nd Verse]
I see that niggas want to look at me the wrong way
'Cause my papa stackin everytime you hear my song play

Getin my money since I was knee high

Pumpin bottles in the V.I
Chillin wit a diva ultimate group move units like a cheetah

Whole team bling wit jewels and wife beatas

You talking ?? and got a bunch of misdemeanors 
Petty crimes stealin tvs

Chorus DJ Paul
What you bitches wanna do ('cause it's whateva wit us)
What you bitches wanna do ('cause it's whateva wit us)
What you bitches wanna do ('cause It's whateva wit us)
It's whateva wit us, it's whateva wit us

Verse 1 DJ Paul
Now how the hell you little nigglets
Try and test me
Knowing the whole time you grew up on the green
Y'all trying to be Paul
But I ain't tryin' to be y'all
Your pockets is empty
Like summertime school halls
I'm worldwide trick
You're on the radio in one goddamn city
So check your crooked lip bitch
And change yo plans
It's the numbers on your phone
And numbers on your cell

Verse 2 Juicy J
I ain't messed up by messin crooked cowards
Wit a nigga name testing my gangsta
Get his fuckin feelings hurt
Eyes 45 on the fish desert green
Sippin hen smokin and coughin on the scene
You say you wanna fight I know you is a joke
So step in the ride
They call me the Juice
And it's the truth
It's wit all the sports
So watch bitch

Chorus

Verse 3 Sean Paul
Yeah I'm straight for ATL
Screamin' fuck what you claiming
Actin wit the brand new mack
Brand new glasses all my niggaz ???
I'm a gambler I'll handle ya
Hold the dice and shake em
Roll them self leanin the left
Nigga fuck around and break em
You' ze a bitch nigga I can tell it in your eyes
You a hoe nigga in tight jeans shown off your thighs
I'm a g nigga nothing but dro' rolled up in my swisha
In a big Lac with leather seats a pistol ready to split ya
I' m ready wit my partner ready to jump up in the chevy
I'm ready to kick it wit Three 6 Mafia
Back up 'cause we won't fuckin stop

Verse 4 J-Bo
You can call it how you like
But I'ma tell it like I see it
We strapped up wit heaters and bones
They so conceited
Dribble and bounce pass niggaz they so grab
But the whole world will know when we blast it
Knock em off in the ghetto ready nigga let's go
Youngbloodz wit Three 6 swolled my whistle
I'm backdoor like lil joe now nigga let's go
It's pimpin in this bitch
Sawin hoes off like nitro

Chorus

Verse 5 D-Rock
Nigga you bleed like I bleed
We born to die
I never seen man cry till my nigga got shot
I hear you talking but actions speak louder then words
Nigga fuck what you heard I ain't never scured
Can you walk it like you talk it
Show a nigga you real
But shit like that get niggaz killed
Either you won't but nigga you will
All these stories you makin up killin my ill
And my patience ain't long at all
Nigga don't fuck wit me if I ain't fuckin wit y'all
'cause I'm ready for the world but is it ready for me
What you see on TV is on these streets
Some of these niggaz ain't as hard as they say they is
And niggaz don't live like they sayin they is
They wanna roll wit thug niggaz and gangstaz
But real ass niggaz don't roll wit wankstaz

Let your shoulder lean, just let your shoulder lean
Ay, get it right, two step and let your shoulder lean, let your shoulder lean
Just let your shoulder lean

Dro...I'm clean in this bitch
Now I'm finna shoulder lean in this bitch
Nigga buck..carbon 15 in this bitch
This Grand Hustle team of kings is gettin' rich
I lean and get lit, lima bean 6
I take breath, the opposite of Primatine Mist
I ride 26 and let my 9 scream ""flip""
Dro be watchin' Oprah, Mac, 9 up in a clip
Triple black Phantom nigga nah it ain't Tip
With Lucky Charms down and man but nah it ain't Flip
K bounce..ok then I let my shoulder lean
And I bet my car charge, and I bet my motor clean
Suicide doors, Brown Rover look like pok n bean
Everybody know me in the club cuz they smokin' me..Dro
Hoes scopin' me, ice come from Bo Bareeton
Hundred carats have 'em froze for an eon
Red, black, and white Chevy now I'm ridin' Deion
Put them lights off in my rims, now I'm ridin' neon
Our cars look like cra-yon, hoes know I'm the man though
I can shoulder lean...I know how to dance though

First I let my wheels spin, then I let my screen fall
Then I let my trunk beat at Greenbriar Mall, tall
And then I pimp a hoe, take a bitch to Berlin

My girl got a girlfriend, Chevy blue like whirlwind
Nigga it's a drought on that boy, so I got that girl in
Pearl Bent', cockin' hammer, Arm & Hammer propaganda
Bitches think I'm pimpin' and leanin' in salamander sandels
Dirty South hot cuz Atlanta.. show niggaz with ammo
We ride Phantom, holla shorty for grammar
Yep, now I be on TV, BET, out the channel
Hood nigga from Bankhead, I stay by Grandma Nana
I lay by my banana, dumpin' and punkin' monkeys
Don't nobody live with my mom but a bunch of junkies
Throw me the donkey, bitch I ride glaze on the haze

Never trust a soul I'm here to say 
Stop dependin' and be yourself 
And grab a hold and don't look left

And eviction notice 
Now people strong self eviction notice 
Prescription cops serve keep it real 
That fine but if I get wit it I'mma face some time 
And its hard being young and rich 
Trying to survive 
Trying to keep a shot to shine 
On the poor headed ties

Talk that shit but this is my life

Straight disrespect, what you expect they suppose to lay
I know these niggas don't love me, so why should I trust them?
These niggas they bustas, I put em' in ditches
I put em' on crutches, slanging them cutters

He wasn't 'bout busting his trigger, took the boss of bosses
Got caught by the vultures, if you slippin' it might cost ya
Jeepers creepers in these waters, best leave home with your revolver
I hope yo people got extensions, 'cause them boys got shooters
It's 'bout who catch the other slippin', it's not bout choppers and Rugers
I pray I come home to Kinnie

Gripping on wood grain
Keep on, keep on, keep on moving
Banging, swerving lane to lane

[Al-D]
Gripping on grain, while the 15's bang
Know you wonder if it's thunder, where the fuck is the rain
Lane to lane dripping blue, puffing on coo-coo
Candy wetter than do, banging nothing but Screw
Reclined on buck, like I'm stuck in the mud
Ripping my mug cause I'm thug, sipping straight out the jug
Ghetto thoed we ghetto known, wih mo' ice on my heart
Boy got mo' ice, than a W march
Bout to knock my trunk off, with this shit down South
Knocking pictures off your wall, when I pass by your house
Know your spouse is your trojan, if you love her than get her
Cause she stuck on a G, like a god damn sweater
Hotter than a baretta, trying to give it up fast
Left her stupid like cupid, and put a plug in her ass
Swanging glass moving fast, as I dash through your hood
Picking splinters out my palm mayn, gripping on wood

Swanging down bumping tip, champagne under the tent
Trend setter, red beam for plexing
Crawling, living the life of a Texan
Get down your block three in the morning, waking the hood up
Crawling purple passion, up in my cup
I-10 to 71, mash the gas to Austin
Chrome glossing, big bossing flossing
Block to block spot to spot, no need for tripping
Still collecting my ends, in the 2K dimension
Twist a leaf out the leaf, as I crawl through the street
Waiting on the sunrise, praying a G on deep
It's a Sunday a fun day, and I crawl down Sunnydale
Sparkling sun rays, making the game prevail
Jazzy broads whispering, boppers shaking they tail
You can do what you do, I'm all about my mail

Bang out my garage, and I'm on 20 inch chrome
Grab my phone, cause I'm calling Al-D
When they see the buttons, don't try to compare me
She gon stare G, so you better get her
I'm coming down, and I'm banging the Hardest Pit of the litter
Down South, keep our name out your mouth
And we'll get it on, and we known to buy a house
And buy the block it don't stop, with shoes and socks
Bet the top drop, and let the bumper unlock
But me I'm rolling foreign, never ever alone
Swanging left and right, with alarm cats knowing
Paints I be pouring, and you know I'm so wet
Getting me a ticket from the laws, you want to bet
They can't stand me, pulling off they say you dripping too much candy
Yes I can't stand it, I'm the drank and drip bandit
You can't handle it, bought the ice that sunk the Titanic
Don't panic, when you see me riding with Janet
On the escapade, riding a Escalade
Break these boys off with techs, my chest plate

You better be stayin up out of my way
So keep away
Silencer is here to stay
Comin and gunnin you runnin
I got amunition with no competition
I got my ambitions I go on a mission

Never ever trust a fake and that's on the real ese
Enemies are gonna die for talkin shit ese
Baggy pants creased up
And I kick it with my thugs
If you ain't one of us
Then to you there is no love
Makin the rap
Strappin the gat
Silencer is creepin up out of the sight
With a homicide like that
Ready to take you off the map

And wonderin if I gang bang
Well homie press your luck
And their gonna see the bullets rang
And the pepas on the chain gang
And the pepas want to know my real name
But to me it's all the same

Cause she's helpin me to main tain main tain

I'm comin you runnin
And you hoping
You want to know some thing

Burn up their bodies to turn them to ashes
Ashes

[Mr. Sancho]
I'm out of sight
Despite the color of the night
I'm creepin up on you in alley
With no witnesses in sight, right
Givin me a difficult way of life
Needin a cuete to stay alive
Callin me 24 7
Not Low Pro fans
What are they sellin
Jealousy mixed with Heniseey
That's what haters be
Walkin up to me
Tellin me they love my CD
Gracias por to opinion
supe mi motivasion
escribo otra cancion
por que encontre mi pasion
Hypocrite trying to imidate
But he can not duplicate
So we had to hate
And now we debated
Trucha
Cause this shit got personal
Not nessecry to involve my family
I'm so violent and so versatile
Ready for combat
When ever you're ready
Don't get the baja
I'll still slice you like confetti
There's no way to avoid
It's better without being unemployed
Pero yo leta is some thing que no soy

Youngstown,"Lee Thompson Young: Well saving is the game,
Silverstone is the name... Secret Agent Status...
  
Day starts early and he's on the move 
He has to have breakfast in his dressing room
Knock, knock 5 minutes to chew
Go to make up then it's time to hear,
Take 1, take 2 everybody's telling him what to do 
It's a great big price to pay to be the man 
So listen to what I have to say


It's not what you think when you see him roll 
In the limo down the street baby you should know
That everything that glitters..it ain't gold.
(He's the famous Jett Jackson) 
It's not what you think 'cause when he's all alone
Reminices 'bout the past and he finds himself 
Trying to go back home. 
(He's the famous Jett Jackson) 
  
He thinks about what he used to be back home 
Everything was quiet, nothing really going on 
Talking to his peeps on the telephone 
Now his life has changed nothing is the same 
He took it to the next level, now he's gotta keep it all together

Villans and thugs for hire to run like somebody set their socks on fire 
Evil doers know by now to say,""aww man he's cocked his eyebrow 
This cat's about to say goodbye now find a place to lie down 
Duck and cover 'cause he's sharper than a diamond cutter 
Slicker than a stick of butter"",
But even the best of the best can't work alone 
So as far as sidekicks go Hawk's is one of the nicest and

5'5"" curly hair with an angel's face
Took me a second to even walk her way
Every time I get around her don't know what to say
Walked over to her, finally built up the nerve,
Takin' my time situating my words
She turned around, looked me dead in the eyes,
Smiled at me and my only reply,
I tell you all I could say

I swear my mind goes blank at just the smell of her hair
Doesn't matter where she is or what she does,
Irrelevant because you know I gotta be there

I just can't wait for morning to come

For forty seconds, streets settle 'til the light out like Shuttlesworth
Huddle I serve, just might cuddle your Earth
To pass it off to the goonies, sliding off from the hood to the boonies
Leaving rug burns on your boo's knees
Dust bunnies in the home with a stove get bus money
Chickens, they don't get nothing from me
Only donate to a foundation for cleft lips
And this one chick I nicknamed her coochie Death Grip
Shawty used a loan shark now her O's on par
Her mouth was a wood haven
I'm slaving, catch me on tour, I'm OTB
You at OTB, losing your life savings, spending a G
Real calm, I ain't gotta spazz
I stay cool, calm and collected, a lot of cash
If you dumb to come test
I get you buck 50'd by a dyke that look like Mannie Fresh

Vacay in St. Maartens and Arubas
And I still do this for my hood boogers
Who don't know what an Uber is
After Denali, pull up in a sixth series in Cali
Show off like a series finale
Used to take the train home, every day was the warriors
Now I ain't gotta say what my story is
I'm with a Laureates, name went from ringing no bells
Now it's like Nobel's, retire the mic
Shut up, I'm tired of writing
It's just like beating on desks in lunch period
Schemes, I got a myriad, the game I'm 'bout to marry it
Still witty, might have been lacking in terms of visibility
But was no doubting his ability

Sabotaged the pursuit of rap wealth, cause cash is dumb whack

To the point that when I came out, they thought I was someone else
Ain't planned it like that, but it helps
Remember recoding every week, just to get my tops up
And fools acting like I just popped out (what)
Before I ever made a project, I would go to projects out there getting busy
The fuck was suckas talking 'bout ""who is he""

Watched a couple cats profit off my wave too
Still running with the same crew, cause I stay true

This must be heaven, being a dad plus a legend

Yourcodenameis: Milo,"Shall I begin from here to tell everything ?
Relinquish honour in order to make it ring ?
You'd have to give me your promise
You won't expect too much from this
You'll just be happy with the gold that I bring

We've been playing cat and mouse now for far too long
I can't let it simmer and just go gruelling on
I have to make my move
I've still got so much to prove
You can't imagine the life that I've had

Chorus: if I could put the words together
If I could put the words together
If only I could put the words together
You'd understand

You've been a magnet stuck in my memory
I'd hide if I could but I'm red in a yellow sea
Consider me lost in aspic
(I'd give in but that's not my schtick)
You'll haunt me for ever, I know you will

There's a hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly liftin' 
Well, electric light still struck like arrows 
Fired but for the ones condemned to drift or else be kept from driftin' 

Well, tollin' for the searching ones on this speechless, secret trail 
For the lonesome haunted lovers with too personal a tale 
And for each young heart for each channeled soul misplaced inside a jail 
Yeah, we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'

Well, starry eyed and laughin' I recall when we were caught 
Trapped by an old track of vows for the hands suspended 
As we listened one last time, and we watched with one last look 
Spellbound and swallowed ""Has the tollin' ended?"" 

Yeah, tollin' for the achin' ones whose wounds cannot be nursed 
For the countless, confused, accused, misused strung out ones at worst

Yo this Wyclef Jean and the ReFugee All-Stars up in here 
Yo what's this I hear about the police in Brooklyn? 
Turn this jam up, yo, yo

I want the whole world to hear this joint right here, yo

You asked for it buddy, here it comes 

One two, watch out for the man in blue 
Three four, I keep it raw and hardcore 
Five six, you're beating us with nightsticks 
Seven eight, I'm forced to pack a thirty-eight 
Nine ten, you put me in a pen; if I could 
Do it all again, I'd probably bust your chin 

I'm from a land of black bats, alley rats and cats 
Scratch up my car, set me up for the carjack 
Under pressure, I gotta leave the gat 
Two straps, a total of sixteen caps 
Say something positive? No positivity 
More positivity, more positivity brutality 
Thugs get angry, the violence increase 
You want peace, make Wyclef chief of police 
Riding through the hood, it's the same ol story 
It's either you play ball or you drug dealy dealy 
Standin' on the block when the spot get hot 
Guaranteed to get set up, by a crooked cop 
So I'm sittin' back, rhymin' on instrumentals 
Anything I touch, it turns monumental 
Me and Jerry Wonder, we keep it credible 
For the streets, at the same time, we gotta eat 
When we commercialize it's to enterprise 
We guarantee to sell a hundred mil before we die 
But Jerry is broke, that's the situation 
Nine-seven, it's like no more eviction 
No more war milk, no more government cheese 
Police keep on shootin' at our bulletproof Bentley

It's worthless, you get smashed up, on the surface

Nine ten, you put me in a pen; if I could 
Do it all again, I'd probably bust your whole chin 

You got a gat nigga, use it, go 'head pull it 
Scientists got raw footage of me dodgin' bullets 
I walk the streets with heat, three biscuits 
Outnumberin' niggaz twin glocks with triplets 
When I spit shit I lace it, you get punched in face with 
Puncutations of five-knuckle phrases 
I assure you the vocalist standin' before you 
Will destroy you with temperatures hot enough to flame broil you 
My tongue moves much faster than yours do 
Every three thousand styles I change my voiceboxes oil 
Embarrass you in front of your crew to annoy you 
If you know some chicks that suck a good dick, then I'll employ you 
To this hip-hop shit, Canibus stays loyal 
That's why every Killuminati I battle somebody for you 
I'm warnin' you, me versus you, I hurt you 
My balance enables me to square dance in a circle 
Your head'll spin so fast you'll catch whiplash 
I practice lyrical witchcraft on your bitch ass 
Make your hard drive crash to see colon backslash 
Go back to the roots and reprogram your wack ass, nigga

You reap what you sow

After you've missed a day's work
It is almost impossible to catch up
And no one knows what the next day will bring

It's time to get to work
I challenge you to work
Hard work is the only key to dignity
Listen my friend, no matter how menial that work is
I cherish it more than anything else

When you are a position of authority
You should set good examples for others to follow
Be at work before everybody else
And try to be the last one to leave

After you've missed a day's work
It is almost impossible to catch up
And no one knows what the next day will bring

It's time to get to work

After you've missed a day's work
It is almost impossible to catch up
And no one knows what the next day will bring

Work is important
So I challenge all of you to make work a priority
No matter how young you are
Let me remind you that work is the only key to dignity

Your presence is essential
At work by 9, out by 10 to run your own errands

Let me remind you that
After you've missed a day's work
It is almost impossible to catch up
And no one knows what the next day will bring

It's time to get to work
I challenge you to work

No matter what, let's make work a priority
It builds a nation, let's work

Will mend this fatal flaw
Though it may seem a long wait
Others have been here

Before it comes knocking at your door

Give me one chance to know

For the future?

Chacun de nous a la niaque de Shaka Zulu
Pour chaque claque reçue sur chaque joue
À chaque joute qu'on livre on en rajoute dans les livres
Sur la façon dont on se délivre et dont on devient libre
Chaque fibre qui me relie à chaque frère est plus solide
Que chaque menotte de flics et chaque chaîne
Mais chaque scène de nos vies c'est des frères qui s'entretuent
Des conflits ethniques jusqu'au gangs du ghetto qui se tuent
Chaque tune que je gagne ne vaudra jamais ma culture
Les insultes ne me blessent plus car ce qui ne tue pas laisse des points de suture
Le futur de chaque môme est inscrit dans chaque paume
Mais nos mômes ont les paumes posées sur chaque chrome
Chaque tome de ma vie rend hommage à chaque noir 
Ceux dans le manque, ceux qui pètent la banque chaque mois
Chaque mot dédicacé à chaque bled
Chaque ghetto dans la merde, chaque poto qui souffre en scred
Chaque rouge, chaque vert, chaque jaune
Chaque cage, chaque faune, chaque village et chaque zone?
Aux icônes qui respirent dans nos récits
Aux nôtres à la mosquée ou à la messe ou qui attendent un autre messie

Chaque merci à chaque M.C. qui sait fumer le M.I.C.
Parfumé à la fumée de chaque sensi
Chaque insigne de police me laisse perplexe
Imprime chaque peine pour frère qui a pris perpette

Trop de tracas dans chaque cas de figure
Á chaque fracas c'est la bac qui vient nous mener la vie dure
Chaque bitume que j'arpente, que j'emprunte
M'habitue à ce que la poésie ardente soit mon empreinte
Chaque plainte vient des nôtres
Comment rester neutre ?
C'est parce que des flics ont tué des mômes
Qu'il y avait des mômes dans les émeutes
C'qui m'émeut c'est l'amour de chaque Mama
Pas le désamour dans le boule de chaque nana
A chaque carnage, à chaque drame
On relève chaque carma on rallume chaque flamme

Han, que t'avais jamais entendu de rap français, ok ?

J'suis qu'un MC relayeur
Puisque que le monde nous donne des frayeurs
La raison du plus faible est-elle parfois la meilleure ?
Et d'ailleurs à force de perdre j'ai prouvé ma vertu
Une emmerde de perdue, dix de retrouvées
Regroupés, l'espoir de paix nous rassemble
Nos peines se ressemblent et nos pertes se ressentent
Nos plaies sont récentes, d'Afrique en Amérique
Plus dure sera la descente car l'opinion publique est amnésique
Ma musique incomprise des dirigeants
Mec, c'est souvent en son-pri qu'on apprend à braquer la diligence
J'ai pas dix mille chances de devenir millionnaire
Visionnaire, pour y arriver, j'ai besoin d'un flingue ou d'un dictionnaire
Dingue révolutionnaire en Air Max requins
En marge mais tu retiens à la marque du refrain
Les re-frés vivent en otage ou en autarcie
Du chaud au froid comme s'ils passaient de Gwada à Bois D'Arcy
Je vois la cible, la gloire comme objectif
Impassible, du mal à croire à la victoire de mon effectif
J'ai pas l'air festif, j'ai pas l'air cool
Donne un salaire qu'on investisse, parce qu'on galère tous, t'as vu
Finie la garde à vue c'est l'heure des big boss
Y'a même des gosses receleurs ou hustler à la Rick Ross
Flics, procs, et le mépris s'installe
Comment faire du fric propre quand mon équipe a les mains sales ?
Je m'installe, à vous de juger celle-ci :
Faut gruger pour avoir un jet ou le budget de Chelsea
Y'a pas d'éclaircies l'avenir est nuageux
Les jeunes sont plus rageux et même le gun n'est plus un jeu
Cousin, y'a plus d'balles à blanc on s'tire entre nous
Plus de mal qu'auparavant on s'nique entre nous, putain

On a un biz à développer, esprit d'entreprise
Dis toujours opé' même si le mépris des gens te brise
Gentleman, trop de femmes ont fait de moi un homme
Dédicace aux sœurs, aux mères, qui remettent nos vies en ordre
Loin des normes ? Tout reste à vérifier
Peut-être qu'en vérité y'a que des tapettes chez les V.I.P
Toi tu te la pètes, en équipe, équipé
Plus tard tu baisseras la tête quand y'aura des gifles à éviter
Si l'rap était dirigé par mes lascars nègres
Mes nègres feraient des Pascals sans Pascal Nègre
Au lieu de jacter dans les ténèbres
Essaie de taffer pour que ton label devienne célèbre

On veut lui rapporter des tunes mais on a souvent que de belles paroles
On a été des gosses terribles peu importe où ca nous mène,
je sais qu'on deviendra de bons parents nous meme
Le ciel nous aime meme si les hommes nous ont renié
On reste fort car les derniers seront les premiers

Youssoupha,"Les accusations sont graves, mais comme d'hab on fait avec, c’est
Vrai qu’on est trop hard, et puis notre art est de vous vexer
Pas de menaces de mort, mon rap ne sort pas de douilles, mais
C’est le seul son hardcore depuis que le rock n’a plus de couilles, c’est
Un nouveau record de polémique, on dit que je chante le mal
Je vous l'avais dit qu'il y a des indics, ladies and gentleman
Et dans leur bêtise, ils confondent ""crime"" et ""Islam""
Ils m'auraient trouvé plus gentil si je ne faisais que du ""slam""

À la place de Orelsan, moi c’est clair que j'aurais le seum
On a les critiques imparables
D'une France qui oublie que les paroles de son hymne
Sont plus violentes que celles du gangsta rap
Je défends la cause des frères au Sud qui rêvassent du Nord

Dis que j'étais du genre à réagir sur le BPM
Je ne tends pas la joue comme celui qui a vu le jour à Bethléem
Une seule ligne, dans ""À force de le dire""
Où j’exprime tout mon mépris, et là, s'amorce le délire
Des mots accusateurs, pour les rappeurs, j’en retrouve dix mille
C'est vrai qu'on touche le fond chez ce bouffon de Morandini
Mais sans rancune, de ma plume je connais le taro
Et la droite se déchaîne, m’affiche à la une du Figaro
Encore un article pour faire mentir le baromètre
Qui me confirme que certains journalistes de merde sont malhonnêtes
Nous ne sommes pas du même monde, l'Hexagone va mal
Mais j'espère pas que mon prénom vous a subitement rappelé celui de Fofana
Et la Police aboie pour que le tribunal me morde
Ça suffit pour qu’un juge m’inculpe pour ""Menace de mort""

Alors laisse moi te dire
Tout se que je t'aime

Makes me feel for real
In the night in the night, you know when I close my eyes
I can hear your voice for ever
I'm dreaming, singing, hoping, smiling
Giving flying falling, fighting, crying, living, writing when you love me
I'm dreaming, singing, hoping, smiling
Giving flying falling, fighting, crying, living, writing when you love me

J'écris des textes en relief juste avec des rimes plates
J'ai pas changé mes rêves contre un chèque de 1000 plaque
Quand je suis en concert et que le public back
C'est grâce a Philo mon frère big up a mon big black
Je suis parti de mon bled forcé sous les bruits de balles
Dans la rue les murs ont des oreilles et les briques parlent
Rap de référence tu sais je ne biz pas, espérant que ce putain de show biz ne me brise pas
D'une manière ou d'une autre rêvais de toucher le ciel
Je pouvais pas être astronaute alors j'ai fait de la scène
J'ai un pied sur terre, l'autre dans le vide
Un pied dans le superficiel, l'autre dans le din
J'ai un cœur chez les miens, un cœur chez les fous
Un cœur sur la main, un cœur au milieu de la foule
En guise de refrain pour le public qui m'entoure,
Y a cette voix qui revient pour vous dire tout mon amour

Miss me miss me, you are the one who makes me feel
Makes me feel for real

I'm dreaming, singing, hoping, smiling
Giving flying falling, fighting, crying, living, writing when you love me

J'allume une bougie pour éclairer nos remords
Je me bouge vite pour ne pas rester dehors
Le temps s'écoule vite donc on a besoin de l'or
J'ai le flow de LL Cool J quand j'ai besoin de loves
J'ai une main sur mes proches l'autre sur une femme
J'ai une main sur le microphone l'autre sur une arme
Le succès est de taille mais faut garder nos repères
Plus belle sera la médaille plus lourd sera le revers
J'écris ces quelques lignes car souvent je m'y perd
La défaite est orpheline la victoire a mille pères
J'ai un œil sur nos vie un œil sur le monde
Un œil sur mon fils un œil sur la montre
Ma vie sans la foule triste anesthésie
Quand je soufre pour vous je souffre avec plaisir
En guise de refrain pour le public qui m'entoure
Ya cette voix qui revient pour vous dire tout mon amour

Youssoupha,"Appelle-moi Youss' on se connaît
Prim's, on se connaît
Lyriciste Bantou, mais avant tout, on se connaît
Black, Beur, Babtou, de partout, on se connaît
""Parle-nous d'amour avant de nous parler de monnaie, Youss'""
C'est ce que me disent les an-ienc', les daronnes
Loin des pinces et des charognes
Et même en iench', je n'ai qu'une seule parole
Quand vient la mort, on t'enterre sans tes milliards
Est-ce que t'as déjà vu un coffre-fort à l'arrière d'un corbillard?
Encore ignare, on m'a dit que le savoir est une arme
Mon frère en prison m'a dit que le parloir est une larme
Aux hommes, aux femmes, enfermés loin des palais
Et qui m'ont apporté leur flamme lors de mes concerts en maisons d'arrêt
Je suis dans l'arène, on me parraine, mais j'ai le trac
Et à ce qu'il paraît on nous traque
Je disparais après ce track, putain!
Après la trêve, je ne sors plus
Comment veux-tu que je mène une vie de rêve alors que je ne dors plus?
Pour un peu d'or pur, on devient vite des ordures
Et tu le sais déjà, y a des dégâts, les désaccords durent
L'argent incite les hypocrites à faire semblant
Ils oublieront que je suis Noir quand je leur signerai des chèques en blanc
Check l'ambiance, la musique est mélancolique
Mais tu peux entrer dans la danse si ton esprit est encore libre
Je délire, mais je me délivre des grandes gueules, loin des grosses bouches
Je suis plutôt du genre ""Enfant seul"" demande à Ox' Pucc'
Ils osent tous dire que le ghetto c'est cool, téma
Les mômes poussent pendant que les métaux s'écroulent, et moi
Je vois leurs sourires tout jaunes
La rue nous tue, certains la traitent comme une mère,
Alors je l'appelle ""Véronique Courjault""
Pour toutes les zones, loin du pays des merveilles
Ce pays est beau ? Va dire ça aux gens de Montfermeil
Je m'éveille, rêve de plage pour les petits reufs, pas d'une terre infâme
Car faut pas croire qu'on fait du surf sur un terrain vague
Mais comment on s'évade? On vient déjà de loin
On était déjà dans les vapes quand on avait vingt ans de moins
Dis-leur qu'on n'est pas fêlés, les médias n'en parlent pas
Marre de regarder la télé car la télé ne nous regarde pas
Et ils nous parlent de consommer plus à Noël
Si ils pouvaient, ils nous mettraient même des spots de pub dans nos rêves
Même cette vie devient commerce, entre risque et ristourne
Va dire aux commères que je veux vivre de mes disques et de mes discours
Je cours pour ne pas tomber comme un domino
Si dans ce biz faut le bras long, je suis la Vénus de Milo
Et quand mon stylo porte plainte, c'est pas de la provocation
On me conseille de faire le point, je fais des points d'interrogation
Pourquoi je n'ai pas peur de ma mort mais de celle de mes proches?
Pourquoi Marianne a des remords, mais qu'est-ce qu'elle me reproche?
Sur l'identité nationale, qu'on me corrige
Mais mes ancêtres avaient-ils vraiment la gueule de Vercingétorix?
Moi j'ai la rhétorique du bled et de nos banlieues froides
Mon cœur est si torride, que je ne peux pas tout dire en deux phrases
Alors je frappe les esprits au bon endroit
Je suis un éternel incompris, donc seul l'Éternel me comprendra
Ça part en drame, l’orgueil est une maladie
Quand des hommes et des femmes pensent avoir le monopole du Paradis
Fuck les religieux mégalos
Je préfère un athée qui se comporte comme un croyant
Qu'un croyant qui se comporte comme un salaud
Je me jette à l'eau avec ce texte un peu bavard
J'ai payé le taro, mais la crise a fini par m'avoir
Je voulais savoir comment faire plus de thunes dans le circuit
J'ai demandé à la Lune, elle m'a pris pour Nicola Sirkis
Ne sois pas si triste, mauvais karma
Quand tous les rêves de la street viennent à tourner au carnage
Car moi, le temps des briques m'a dépassé
Et la vie, c'est comme un Bic,
Tu peux bien faire une croix sur tes erreurs, mais pas les effacer
Trop fâché, mais assez ivre pour sourire
Je sais pas si l’espoir fait vivre, mais moi il m'empêche de mourir
Et l'amour peut me nourrir, d'un coup mon pouls s'accélère
Je veux être un homme heureux, histoire de chialer comme William Sheller
Et si parfois, j'ai l'air loin de la tourmente, Maman
Ma vie est belle, mais il y a toujours toi qui manques, Maman
Je pourrais chanter comme je suis fier, mais sans prétention
Dieu accepte surtout les prières, pas les belles chansons
La seule rançon, c'est le salut des gens qu'on aime, Amin
Pas de tension, on gagne tous à se connaître, Amin
Avoir toutes les vertus est impossible
J'ai une pensée pour tous les gens que j'ai perdus, pour tous les vôtres aussi
Le nombre de mesures de ce texte, si t'y penses

Je compte revenir après tout ce que j'ai enduré
Et sur ce son, si je pars en vrille, Julien y'a qu toi qui pourras me censurer
Rap d'enculé, la vie de cachot est écœurante
Je suis incompris comme un manchot qui, chez les flics, dépose une main courante
Un coup je rentre, un coup je me chie dessus
Un coup je tente, un coup je ne pige plus
Intolérant, je me dispute
Je vise plus les plans galère, je me téléporte

Faites péter le bif

Depuis que mon âme est partie, j'ai vraiment maigri de 21 grammes
Ça devient grave, est-ce que c'est la France que tu veux?
Boulevard Auriol, des familles crament, mais bon l'État n'y a vu que du feu
Qu'est-ce que tu veux, j'y vais direct, pas de ricochet
Si le savoir est une arme, alors l'ignorance est un godemiché
Que les poucaves oublient les consonnes, on le sait
Avec un canon dans la bouche, y'a que les voyelles qu'on sait prononcer
Les rageux poussent mon buzz, me faire détester est une chance
J'écris mes textes entre l'envie de gester et l'urgence

Le rire des soldats qui viennent d'éventrer des femmes enceintes
Il faut bien croire que la paix est impossible
Moi je veux plus voir le nom d'Allah juste à côté d'une ceinture d'explosifs
Je veux pas croire que l'amour puisse faire si mal
Je veux pas voir les sidaïques squelettiques dans leur phase terminale
Est-ce que l'amour, c'est massacrer sa vie?
Est-ce que c'est ça l'amour, un bon père de famille qui va baiser sa fille?
Pourquoi les politiques me laissent indifférent?
Demande aux ados de Bangkok ce qu'ils pensent de Frédéric Mitterrand
Quand c'est la canicule, les vieux ont leur destin

Nombreux sont les rappeurs, rares sont les lyricistes
Nombreux sont les interprètes, rares sont les artistes
Pourtant le rap doit continuer à dire des choses
À quoi sert notre musique si ce n'est à défendre des causes?
Alors la vie n'est pas toujours belle
Mais en tous cas ce qui est sûr, c'est qu'elle est courte
On n'a plus le temps pour les rimes creuses et sourdes
C'est pourquoi Youssoupha, donne-leur des mots qui éduquent
Des mots qui percutent, mais des mots qui ont un but
Car tant que l'autre rap existe, le nôtre ne doit pas mourir
C'est mon souhait, ce que j’espère, est-ce un Noir Désir?",La Vie Est Belle,2012
Youssoupha,"L'amour ça repart, parfois ça nous quitte
J'assume tous mes pas, car seul Dieu nous guide
Et quand on se parle, l'histoire est écrite
Ne me remercie pas, t'inquiète on est quittes
La rue m'a fait vivre, mais la rue m'a dégoûté
L'école m'a fait lire, mais l'école m'a fait douter
Maman m'a appris que l'argent n'est pas une fin en soi
Que vieillir est obligatoire, mais grandir est un choix
On m'a dit ""ne te rate pas"", y'a personne qui m'aide
J'aime pas le rap, moi, c'est le rap qui m'aime
Il m'a rendu au centuple tout ce que je lui donne
Et parfois quand je ne chante plus, c'est là que je m'isole
Et je n'ai pas d'idole, à part le plus grand
À part mon créateur, plus j'en parle, plus j'en tremble
Plus rien ne me tente, à part quelques doutes que je promène
On se ressemble, appelle-moi Youss', on se connaît!

Tant d'années, tant d'années, Youss' on se connaît
Tant d'années, tant d'années, Youss' on se connaît
Je peux pas t'oublier, non

Les stars ça décline, un jour on les remplace
Les foules sont anonymes, et un jour on les embrasse
La pression domine, personne n'est à ma place
J'ai pas de pseudonyme, Youssoupha c'est mon vrai blaze
J'ai un label qui monte, tant pis pour la critique
Et puis plaire à tout le monde, c'est plaire à n'importe qui
Le but de ma musique, du rap que j'expose
C'était de rester authentique, pas de rester pauvre
Et la France m'a fliqué, ses apparences nous mentent
Mon bled me fait flipper, ma famille me manque
L'amour m'a fait chialer pour tout ce que j'éprouve
Mais la haine m'a installé des yeux waterproofs
Prouve que tu luttes, prouve que t'exultes
Prouve que le but c'est briser les cœurs bruts
Ils veulent qu'on se buttent, attendent les erreurs que l'on commet

Il y a de l'amour dans mes paroles
Tu chantes avec moi et je m'envole
Tu te retrouves en moi
Je sais qu'on se ressemble
Tu bouges la tête sur la musique
Le temps s'arrête et c'est magique!

Un autre pas vers l'avenir

On se connaît

Youssoupha,"C'est l'histoire d'un Noir et d'un Arabe

Nan nan nan nan, faux départ
Toutes les histoires qui commencent comme ça se finissent toujours mal

Contrôle d'identité entre des frères de blood
C'est pas d'la faute des autres si le monde débloque
La crise identitaire est un problème d'époque
Le communautarisme est le cancer des blocks

Qu'est-ce qu'il t'arrive ? Tu veux test mon gabarit?
Tu crois qu'y'a qu'à Paris qu'on accueille bien les Qataris?
Ferme ton bec, ravale tes blagues raciales
Ou dans ton bled, tu t'feras rare comme un black-asiat'

Rien à battre qu'tu sois un brave muslim
Vu qu'un Arabe qui fait du rap, reste un Arabe qui gâte ma black music
Tu t'chies dessus quand c'est la tempête
Donc laisse nos panthères noires, t'aurais du appeler ton album ""Arabian Pampers""

Tu crois réunir les Noirs avec ton ""Noir Désir""?
Mais t'es qu'un demi-leader, comme Harlem Désir
Avec vos différences de langue tous les dix villages
Si les Noirs sont divisés, c'est qu'ils sont divisables

Tu divagues ! J'ai pas besoin qu'on m'accepte chez les macrelles
La pire des négrophobies, moi je l'ai subie au Maghreb
M'appelle pas ""khouya"" : on sait qu'vous êtes racistes
Et aucun Nègre n'oubliera que les Arabes étaient esclavagistes

Parle-moi plutôt de l'esclavage des Noirs eux-mêmes
De tous ces ""Oncles Tom"" qui ont enlevé des âmes humaines
Les premiers négriers étaient vos égaux
J'crois bien qu't'aurais fini comme Samuel Jackson dans ""Django""

Contrôle d'identité entre des frères de blood
C'est pas d'la faute des autres si le monde débloque
La crise identitaire est un problème d'époque
Le communautarisme est le cancer des blocks

C'est chez vous qu'on trouve les traîtres et les gars soumis
Donc entretuez vous avec vos Midi et vos Chalghoumi
Dans une embrouille entre rebeus, faut jamais s'incruster
J'avoue j'suis malheureux : j'aurais dû laisser Nessbeal t'insulter

Un peu de cash sur la table, et les Blacks se calomnient
Nous si on s'clashe, c'est pour mieux s'réunir comme Bachir et Laouni
Y'a pas qu'le sable du Sahara qui nous sépare
Et on sera toujours plus unis que Kery James et Kémi Séba

Nous au moins on a des leaders virils dans nos phases
C'est notre odeur qui fera toujours fantasmer vos femmes
Pas de pitié, alors écoute bien
Vous préférez les lapider, alors elles préfèrent notre coup d'rein

Les bonobos ne pensent qu'à tartiner les beurettes
Ils négligent leurs femmes, excisées à la clé à molette
J'veux pas d'vos rituels, j'évite les unions mixtes
Heureusement que les Arabes ont amené l'Islam aux animistes

Heureusement que le Prophète était un être à part
(Heureusement) Heureusement : Dieu nous protège de vos coutumes d'Arabes
(Heureusement) Normal que tu stagnes
Les ignorants comme toi ont bien vite oublié ce que Bilal a fait pour l'Islam

Contrôle d'identité entre des frères de blood
C'est pas d'la faute des autres si le monde débloque
La crise identitaire est un problème d'époque
Le communautarisme est le cancer des blocks

On n'a plus les yeux en face des trous
Comme sous une cagoule du Ku Klux Klan qui masque le jour
Qui écrit block avec trois ""K""
Qui écrit tess' avec deux ""S""
Doit prendre garde
Rien ne sert de jouer au Beur ou au Blackos fier
D'être plus identitaire que sur la blogosphère
On revendique être gosse d'Afrique
Mais qu'être ethnocentrique c'est être égocentrique
Quand les vieilles victimes deviennent de jeunes auteurs
Porteurs du gène d'Hitler sans être leur géniteur
Quand le poison s'invite dans une blague lambda
La mixité ressemble au mariage de Black Mamba
Des traditions aussi snobinardes
Que celles des apéros sauvages saucisson-pinard
Faussement droit-de-l'hommistes et républicains
Éradiquons le radical qui sommeille en chacun

J'me perds trop, coups d'éclats et illusions
Quand la radio diffuse les clashs, bien sûr qu'elle appuie la division
Trop d'ambition, j'avoue je n'ai pas d'état d'âme
J'attends qu'les rappeurs s'entretuent pour revenir et recompter les cadavres
Nouvel album, nouvelles angoisses paranoïaques

You make me, you make me, you make me smile
You make me, you make me, you make me smile
And in a little while, I don't have to more tears to cry

Y'a tous ces rêves que je promène, blédard est mon accent
J'ai pas réglé mes problèmes, les coups, j'en ai fait quatre cent
J'ai pas tenu les promesses, perdu dans mes passe-temps
Et, quand les autres progressent, j'ai l'impression d'être absent
Tout ça n'a pas d'sent, et ça me donne le tournis
Comment régner? Parmi les araignées, je suis une fourmi
Mais, toujours mon sale orgueil qui résonne comme un écho
J'sais pas si j'ai mal à mon cœur ou mal à mon ego
Tous inégaux, tous énervés
C'est pour ma tante et tout le travail ingrat qu'elle a fait pour nous élever
C'est pour les femmes qui ont apaisé mes soupirs
Celles qui m'ont croisé en larmes et m'ont redonné le sourire, refrain

Et, plus le bonheur me tend la main, plus je suis parano
À nos actes manqués, à nos embouteillages
À nos joies tourmentées, à nos coups de théâtre
Et y'a tous ces moments où je décroche, où j'pense à me retirer
J'pense aux reproches et à mes proches quand mes défauts remontent
Si j'aime autant mon fils, c'est pas seulement pour ce qu'il est
Mais aussi pour ce que je suis depuis qu'il est venu au monde
C'est pour mon grand frère dans le din, pour tous ses conseils
Pour tous ces gens qui m'ont fait grandir à travers les concerts
C'est pour les sœurs qui m'ont pas laissé souffrir
Qui m'ont vu quand j'étais seul, et m'ont redonné le sourire, refrain

Faut pas qu'je sois en pleine cuite, que le bon Dieu m'épargne

Dans une époque où ce qui est cru est plus important que ce qui est vrai
Tout ce qui m'effraie, c'est les refrés que nos légendes gênent
L'ultime séjour, les mauvais jours pour les gens que j'aime
Mon oxygène, c'est quand je veille près de vous
Et mon public est somnambule, je rappe des histoires à dormir debout

Ils prétendent tous faire du lourd alors je reviens léger comme une plume
Le passé lourd comme une enclume, mes démons me l'apprennent
Demain c'est loin, notre futur c'est la seconde d'après

Je suis d'une puissance calme, ne porte pas de gun
Silencieuses sont les batailles, alors fermez vos gueules

J'fais pas du rap pour les rappeurs, j'fais du rap pour les gens
C'est pour les bêtes et méchants, les têtes et les jambes
Les thèmes, et les textes de légende
Qu'on a écrit pour s'engager
Même si je sais qu'on peut avoir le bon message tout en restant un mauvais messager
J'viens cracher mes états d'âmes, et mes cas d'conscience
Y'a que les connards qui vont croire que c'est du rap conscient
Pourtant, j'n'ai pas confiance, même en mes propres dires
Entre rires de déprime et larmes de crocodiles
Pas de gros deal, que des risques forts

Maintenant qu'j'ai plus de maison d'disques, j'ai une maison de disques d'or
Triste sort face au charbon, il fallait du cran
Mais je cherche pas à être bon, je cherche à être grand
J'ai pas de clan, j'préfère éviter, parano
Je crois toujours aux mensonges et doute souvent de la vérité
Quelle idée, vu qu'ici je tourne dans le même schéma
Parfois, je doute, parfois, je pense à retourner chez moi
Laissez-moi libérer mon gospel

La France ne reconnaît pas les communautés mais nous traite comme telles
Quand les gens sont boycottés, forcément, ils se lassent
Quand on met les gens de côté, forcément, ils s'éloignent
C'est pas les lois qui font les hommes, c'est l'inverse
On témoigne sans respect, un signe de paix sans l'index
Sans déc, les beaux parleurs peuvent mentir, c'est les actions qui comptent
J'écoute pas ce que les gens disent, je regarde ce qu'ils font
J’m'en bats de ce qu'ils sont, j'ne vois qu'un cœur
Quand on voyage, le monde devient plus petit alors il fait moins peur
Viens, on prend de l'ampleur, quoi, viens, on fait une pause
Et, si y'a quelqu'un près de toi, check-le de l'épaule
Et je me pose, authentique dès le départ
C'est plus facile d'assumer ce qu'on est que d'imiter ce qu'on n'est pas

Que Dieu m'épargne de l'aigreur de perdre ma voix
Et qu'il m'épargne de l'erreur de perdre ma foi
Vous êtes ma flamme, je suis fou et malhonnête
Mais, tous les jours, je me soigne et j'apprends à vous connaître
Comme dit le poète : je le cite et je le chante
Faudrait essayer d'être heureux, ne serait ce que pour donner l'exemple
Ça tourne comme un sample, de Paris à Dakar
L'amour nous manque, prends ce texte comme une Sadaqa
On reste calme avant le carnage, qui m'aime me suive
Je cherche la paix pour mon Karma, moi-même, je suis

J'viens d'là où on meurt de jalousie plus que de choléra
J'aime bien chanter pour les thunes, mais j'suis le meilleur en pe-ra
Ajoute un peu d'autotune que j'devienne chanteur d'opéra
Nouvelle bombe, ouvrez les guillemets, arrêtez de filmer
J'ai fui le rap parce que j'étais LeBron parmi les Pygmées
Parfois, on parle en rime mais, souvent, on parle en chiffres
Pour eux, je reste une énigme, comme un Ramadan juif
En Afrique, je n'suis pas expat', je me donne en spectacle
Extase, on a vendu du shit mais jamais d'ecsta'
On perd avec honneur, polémique
Je sais c'que ça fait d'être un loser, j'suis supporter des New York Knicks
Fais ton truc sur ton trajet, jamais pour les gens
Ici, on commence par t'encourager en te décourageant, poto

Entre le soleil et le dark, man, colère et les blagues, man
J'suis bipolaire, certains m'appellent ""Bruce"", d'autres ""Batman""
Pas de solutions dans nos rues quand les condés frappent mal
À part chanter la révolution à la Tracy Chapman
Bien sûr que je m'échappe, man, à des kilomètres
J'fais du rap, man, noire musique, je n'ai pas de maître
Musique nègre, ça rend nerveux, c'est plus facile quand t'es blanc
Demande à Vald, demande à Orelsan ou Nekfeu
Il faut l'admettre, pas besoin que quelqu'un m'aide
Trop re-noi pour gagner aux Victoires de la musique de merde
Mentalité jamais prête, toujours coupable, je plaide
Rarement dans leurs festivals donc on fait des concerts au bled, quand même
De toute manière, on punit, j'veux ma peine sans modèle unique

La galère n'est pas un progrès, faire d'la merde n'est pas un projet
J'fais la guerre jusqu'à la prochaine, ma grand-mère est sur ma pochette
Guette pour quelques potes, c'est garant, parfois, on se porte garant
Mais l'rap, c'est pas toujours marrant, fais gaffe, on n'est pas tes parents
J'vais bombarder dans mon bolide, placardez pas mes acolytes
On préfère plaider la folie plutôt que d'aider la police
Sur quelques coups, c'est plus un flow, c'est une fontaine
Prochain album déjà en écoute sur un iPhone 13, putain
On fait ça black indépendant, jeunes débrouillards

Ce genre de Zaïre 1989

Yeah
Le buzz et les palabres, j'ai pas besoin d'com'
Refrain en lingala, j'ai pas besoin d'codes
J'ai beaucoup d’orgueil, tous les dollars, je recueille
Mais, un jour, dans mon cercueil, j'aurai pas besoin d'coffre
Pas besoin d'côte, pas besoin d'frime
Si Dieu m'escorte, j'aurai pas besoin d'fric
Pour changer la donne, que les rageux me pardonnent
Je suis seul pour cet album, je n'ai pas besoin d'feat'
Pas besoin d'clique, de colombes dans mon rêve
Pas besoin de flics, de colons dans mon bled
Dieu aux Congolais, nos richesses se terminent
Les diamants sont éternels, boy, pas la Gécamines, gamine
Alors on crie, on prie
Être grand, c'est aussi être incompris
C'est pour mes reus' et mes racines

De cette putain d'pauvreté entre rêve et déception

Mais j'attends de le devenir pour pouvoir faire une exception
On fait du commercial pour pas que nos familles chialent
Car votre ascenseur social nous verrouille et nous malmène
Il faut que je me sauve, y a du mépris sur ma peau
Je n'peux pas aider les pauvres si je reste pauvre moi-même

Comment respecter les délais des putains d'crédits de fêlés?
Dès le tin-ma, te lever tôt pour s’empêtrer dans le métro
Traficoter dans le ghetto, guette les condés dans le rétro
Putain d'attitude de dandy, détends ta dégaine de bandit

Maintenant qu'on se fait rares, c'est plus comme à l'époque

Finir au bout du monde ou finir au bout de la corde
On vieillit sur les photos, on n'est plus à la mode

J'suis pas d'humeur, j'm'écroule en moins d'une heure
J'suis pas à l'écoute, ni des tendances cool, ni des rumeurs
Je meurs, le temps me catapulte

Pourtant, ma gamberge est grande même si tu me vois faire le con
Moi, j'aime apprendre mais je déteste qu'on vienne me faire la l'çon
Évite les thèmes et les sujets qui fâchent

Le jour où j'ai arrêté l'rap, le jour où j'ai arrêté l'rap
Le jour où j'ai arrêté l'rap, moi, moi, moi

J'n'étais qu'un rappeur dans la masse, aucune carrière stratégique
J'attendais que ma parole marche mais elle était paraplégique
Parfois, j'hésite, mon cœur ouvert, quelqu'un a dû le fermer mal
J'suis dans la peau d'un amnésique qui tenterait d'écrire ses mémoires
Puisqu'il y a parfois des silences qui résonnent fort comme un cri
C'est pour les quartiers de France, de Port-au-Prince, de Conakry
Et, très vite, j'ai senti la douille, j'suis pas complètement inculte
Tout est parti en couilles quand ""rap conscient"" est devenu une insulte, poto
J'suis pas rebelle, j'pars avec aucun regret
Mais, si toute ma vie part en vrille, il faudra bien que j'la redresse
Moi, je n'garde aucune rancœur, j'ai de l'amour qui déborde
Et,vous qui entrez dans mon cœur, faites pas attention au désordre
Nique les codes, y a pas d'règles, c'est mon parcours qui le prouve
Et, souvent, c'est l'esprit qui cherche, mais c'est toujours le cœur qui trouve
Gamin, on m'avait dit ""dans ce rap, tu tiendras vingt secondes""
Comme dirait l'autre ""ça fait vingt ans que ça fait vingt secondes""
Moi, j'suis pas né ici, on pense que j'pars de rien
En vrai, j'vous déchire car j'ai la rage de ceux qui viennent de loin
Et j'suis tellement du bled à mort qu'j'ai jamais vu la Tour Eiffel
Mais j'suis tellement d'la banlieue Nord que j'ai grandi à Winterfell
J'préfère mélanger les genres, j'ai trop d'identités
Et j'tente de mélanger les gens mais c'est pas la mentalité d'ici
Pays laïque, on veut formater les modèles
On aura l'air con le jour où l'Aïd tombera à Noël, ok
J'suis pas rageux, mamène, merci à tous ceux
Qui ont refusé d'm'aider, ils m'ont aidé à faire les choses moi-même
Alors j't'emmène pour pas l'regretter, en vrai, faut pas l'répéter
J'suis pas juste en retrait, j'suis presque retraité
Et comment refléter un dixième de tout c'que j'ressens?
Et comment ré-freiner un millième de tout c'qui me ressemble?
Vu qu'à l'époque, sans oseille, fallait grandir
J'avais un casque sur les oreilles mais, pourtant, j'les entendais dire
""Laissez-le, ça lui passera, bientôt, sa musique est morte
Laissez-le jouer la caille-ra, c'est juste un phénomène de mode
Il vient de loin, il vient d'en-bas, trop de poids sur les épaules
Et, ""Youssoupha"", ça reste un blase pour finir chômeur ou en taule
Je vous dis qu'ça lui passera, il aboie sans jamais mordre
Il va nulle part avec son rap, ça reste un phénomène de mode""
Entre temps, j'apprends les codes et fais du hip-hop ma devise
Et puis le phénomène de mode est devenu un mode de vie
Moi, ils m'ont tous pris pour un fou devant ce rap dont je raffole
Avant de soulever les foules, moi, j'étais grave agoraphobe
Et, parfois, tout va très vite, les événements nous malmènent
Sur mon album, y a pas d'feat', je suis en feat' avec moi-même
Forcément, je fais des fautes, j'fais du rap à taille humaine
J'ai pas b'soin d'éteindre les autres pour rester seul dans la lumière
J'pense au bled, à la souffrance, à mon père parti en douce
Moi, j'voulais juste partir en France, au final, j'suis parti en couilles, crouille
T'as parié contre moi, tu m'croyais invalide
Vingt ans plus tard triple platine et j'suis un leader de La Ligue
Ce game a un goût d'strip-tease, j'suis tellement devenu le boss
Si j'avais fait du rock, je serais Bruce Springsteen
Et fuck les sixteen bars, j'avais trop d'choses à dire
Je n'avais que seize mesures à la base, puis c'est parti en vrille
Moi, je fais c'que je fais ce que je veux, les autres font comme ils peuvent
J'pleure tellement dans mes couplets, je me noie dans mes morceaux fleuves
Je rappe parce que j'étais muet et j'suis devenu parolier
Je rappe parce qu'on veut justice pour la famille Traoré
Je rappe parce que je sais, notre revanche commence à peine
Et puis, j'l'ai déjà dit ""R.A.P."", ça signifie ""rien à perdre""
Je rappe parce que maman est souvent de mauvaise humeur
Je rappe pour prolonger le combat du Ministère A.M.E.R
Je rappe parce que j'ai encore besoin d'oseille en dollars
Et puis on m'a fait croire qu'un jour je deviendrai MC Solaar
Je rappe pour combien d'temps encore, combien d'instants encore?
Je rappe pour marquer la légende, pour combien d'gens encore?
Au moins, j'l'ai fait avant qu'je crève, je peux sourire
Je meurs pas avec mes rêves, j'préfère mourir avec des souvenirs

Inspiration lunaire parce que chez nous, la foi est grande
J’suis devenu populaire pourtant, ma gueule est underground
On préfère rester simple, on a grandi avec peu

Nouvelle aventure, nique les rageux détracteurs
Mais qui sont ces créatures? Je n’crains que leur créateur
J’suis pas le ﬁls d’un toubab, pas le ﬁls de Zeus
Pas le ﬁls de Serigne Touba, je suis le ﬁls de Dieu
Mon continent est gravement atteint et je gamberge
Je vis parmi les diamants mais je meurs dans la merde
Je suis le ﬁls du Congo, je suis le ﬁls de Kin
Je suis le fruit d’un complot, je suis le fruit d’un crime
J’ai eu un ﬁls avant ma ﬁlle, ça, c’est le choix du roi
J’ai eu disque avant mon ﬁls, ça, c’est le choix du rap
Je suis un père parano qui ﬂippe des lendemains
Moi, j’suis un père par amour car j’ai pas vu le mien
Moi, j’suis un père de famille, je suis le père de Malik
Et puis maintenant, imagine que j’suis le père d’Imany
Ma mère, c’est ma reine, c’est cruel comme elle me manque
Je la vois dans mes rêves, dans la lumière, comme elle est grande
Je suis le ﬁls de HAN-toinette c’est dans mon regard
Petit ﬁls de N'Diaye Siby, ﬁlle du Sénégal, Moi
J’suis le ﬁls de tous, nos disparus qui m’entendent
J’suis le ﬁls de Ya Soukey et puis de toutes mes autres tantes
La musique, c’est un monde, j’ai dû prendre de la bouteille
J’ai dû me faire un nom pour reprendre le pouvoir
Avant, ils m'appellaient, ""le ﬁls de Tabu Ley""
Maintenant, pour appeller Tabu Ley, ils disent ""le père de Youssoupha""

Un pas en avant et, soudain, tu recules
Je suis fébrile et, parfois, c'est terrible
Ton amour me guérit ou peut-être qu'il me tue
Je préfère les p'tites causes aux grandes charités
J'préfère les grands défauts aux p'tites qualités
À force de vivre et puis, à force de fuir
Toutes les choses qu'on esquive finissent par arriver
Moi, j'ai pas gagné grand-chose à côté de vous
En vrai, l'amour, c'est surcoté de fou
Encore un leurre pour que les hommes pleurent
Plombés par leurs erreurs, qu'ils ne tiennent plus debout
Si notre Terre est ronde, faut vraiment qu'j'la traverse

Aujourd'hui, la haine, demain, on s'complimente
Bouger la tête et puis trouver la paix, et puis toute ma peine sera ma confidente
J'ai tellement de choses à te dire que t'ignores
Y a tellement de questions pour moi que tu portes
Te dire ""au secours"" avec de grands discours
Mais au final, je t'envoie un texto ""tu dors?""

I'd love ya if I could
'Cause you're the kind of girl
That I adore
And you're the kind of girl
I've been looking for

Hey, where do you live
Where do you live, baby
I'd like to take you home
What do I have to give
What do I have to give
To call you on the phone

'Cause you're the kind of girl
That I adore
And you're the kind of girl
I've been looking for

Girl, tell me your name
(I wanna know your name)
Just tell me your name
Please tell me your name
(I wanna know your name)

Ain't never seen nothin' as sweet as you
(I wanna know your name)
Sitting there in that gray dress, pretty little thing
(I wanna know your name)

'Cause I never believed
In love at first sight
But now I know
That it's alright

Girl, tell me your name
(I wanna know your name)
Please tell me your name
What's your name
(I wanna know your name)

You look so good, you look so good
(I wanna know your name)
Girl, ain't never seen nothing like this in my life
(I wanna know your name)
You just look like something I could settle down with

Let me introduce myself, my name is Little Sonny
I drive a little red Volkswagen
I like to go horse back riding
I like all kind of sweets, cupcakes, currants and things like that

This is why I can't help from noticing you
Just a jazzy, jazzy ol' babe
Come on, can I have this dance
Something as groovy as this, we got to dance

Lord, have mercy
Am I holding you too tight'
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, excuse me
Ain't gonna get too close

When are you going to tell me your name'
Please tell me your name
I'm just going to have to grab you
And hold you a little closer
'Cause, I just got to, Lord, have mercy

(I wanna know your name)
Girl, tell me your name
(I wanna know your name)
Just hold me, just squeeze me

(I wanna know your name)
Girl, tell me your name, you sweet little thing, you
(I wanna know your name)
I could love you, I could love you, I could love you
All night long, all night long, all night long

Listen, what about giving your phone number
And I call you one Saturday afternoon
Perhaps we can go in town, have a little bite to eat
And then maybe, go and take a movie

And afterwards, I'll just drop you at the, at the doorstep
And give you little kiss
Oh, I just, there's so many things
That we could do if you just tell me your name
I am not even married, are you married'

Girl, you gotta tell me, tell me, tell me your name
Just wait a minute, don't leave out the door
Don't leave me, don't leave me
Just tell, just tell girl
Just wait a minute",Boogie Oogie Oogie [Album Version],2005

Is in your eyes
A look your smile can't 
disguise

The look of love
Is saying so much more than
Just words could every say
And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away

[Chorus]
I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

Don't ever go
Don't ever go
I love you so

And baby we'll seal it with a kiss

I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

I am so awfully misunderstood

So lady be good to me.

Now in the air the spring is coming

Yuki Kajiura,"I'm living with false hope, and my eyes
Just want to see a ray of light
I'm gonna find it in my fairy tale

I hear, long forgotten broken toys
Tell me ancient tales of a boy
I will sing of them in my fairy tale

I was just a silent girl
Always dreaming of a little angel
Close to my reality
Sing, la la la

The midnight sun hangs in the sky
Show me your smile, my little angel
Hear me, my fantasy
Sing la la la through the night

See, how my flights of imagination
Help me discover comprehension
I can find it in my fairy tale

I know, only a man can dare to dream
Nothing is really as it seems
Keep on telling, your own fairy tale

Now wake up, my silent girl
Take to flight, like a foolish angel
Sing me your fantasy
Sing, la la la....

My midnight sun hangs in the sky
The first and last wondrous invention
Show me the horizon
Sing, la la la

The summer is here, we kiss and fall in love
But we've got to go, leaving nothing here
I want to share the memories of long forgotten love

I was just a silent girl
Wishing for better understanding
This is my melody
Sing, la la la 

My midnight sun hangs in the sky
Help me to tell my history
With painted scenery
Sing, la la la 

In my fairy tale
I'm living in my fairy tale",Fiction,2003

Tell me of a story never ever told in the past

Take me back to the land
Where my yearnings were born
The key to open the door is in your hand
Now fly me there

Fanatics find their heaven in never ending storming wind
Auguries of destruction be a lullaby for rebirth

Consolations, be there
In my dreamland to come
The key to open the door is in your hand
Now take me there

I believe in fantasies invisible to me
In the land of misery I'm searchin' for the sign
To the door of mystery and dignity
I'm wandering down, and searchin' down the secret sun

Come with me in the twilight of a summer night for awhile
Tell me of a story never ever told in the past

Take me back to the land
Where my yearnings were born

Now take me there to the land of twilight",Key of the Twilight,2003

To eternal dimension

Open your heart
For love and affection

For tears and rejection

Of heaven's eternal fantasy

Come to the grace
Of earthly devoted harmony",Open Your Heart,2003
