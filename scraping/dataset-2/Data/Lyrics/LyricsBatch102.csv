Daniel Humair,"No one here can love or understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
Pack up all my cares and woe, here I go, winging low
Bye, bye, blackbird

Where somebody waits for me
Sugar's sweet, so is she
Bye, bye, blackbird

No one here can love or understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
Make my bed and light the light, I'll arrive late tonight
Blackbird, bye, bye

Bye, bye, blackbird
Where somebody waits for me
Sugar's sweet, so is she
Bye, bye, blackbird

No one here can love or understand me
Oh what hard luck stories they all hand me
Make my bed and light the light, I'll arrive late tonight
Blackbird, bye, bye",Bye Bye Blackbird,1999
Daniel Humair,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,1999
Daniel Humair,"You'd be so nice to come home to
You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high, sang a lullaby
You'd be all my heart could desire

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon shining above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon burning above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love",You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To,1999
Daniel Humair,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Everything happens to me",Everything Happens to Me,2003
Daniel Humair,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,2003
Daniel Huttlestone,"Cuferaque, you take the watch
They may attack before it's light
Everybody keep the faith
For certain as our banner flies
We are not alone
The people too must rise

Marius, rest.

Drink with me to days gone by
To the life (To the life) that used (That used) to be (To be)
At the shrine of friendship, never say die
Let the wine of friendship never run dry
Here's to (Here's to you) you and here's to me
Do I care if I should die
Now she goes across the sea?
Life without Cosette
Means nothing at all.
Would you weep, Cosette, if I were to fall?
Will you weep, Cosette,
For me?",Drink With Me,2012
Daniel Huttlestone,"There are giants in the sky
There are big, tall, terrible giants in the sky

When you're way up high
And you look below
At the world you've left
And the things you know
Little more than a glance
Is enough to show
You just how small you are

When you're way up high
And you're on your own
In a world like none
That you've ever known
Where the sky is lead
And the earth is stone
You're free, to do
Whatever pleases you
Exploring things you'd never dare
'Cause you don't care
When suddenly there's

A big, tall, terrible giant at the door
A giant?
A big, tall, terrible lady giant sweepin' the floor
And she gives you food
And she gives you rest
And she draws you close
To her giant breast
And you know things now that you never knew before
Not till the sky

Only just when you've made
A friend and all
And you know she's big
But you don't feel small
Someone bigger than her
Comes along the hall
To swallow you for lunch

And your heart is lead
And your stomach is stone
And you're really scared
Being all alone
And it's then that you miss
All the things you've known
And the world you've left
And the little you own
The fun is done
You steal what you can and run

And you scramble down
And you look below
And the world you know
Begins to grow
The roof, the house and your mother at the door
The roof, the house and the world you never thought to explore
And you think of all the things you've seen
And you wish you could live in between
And you're back again only different than before
After the sky

There are giants in the sky
There are big, tall, terrible, awesome, scary, wonderful
Giants in the sky",Giants in the Sky,2014
Daniel Huttlestone,"Mother cannot guide you
Now you're on your own
Only me beside you
Still, you're not alone
No one is alone
Truly
No one is alone

I wish...
I know
Mother isn't here now
Wrong things, right things
Who knows what she'd say?
Who can say what's true?
Nothing's quite so clear now
Do things, fight things
Feel you've lost your way?
You decide, but
You are not alone
Believe me
No one is alone (No one is alone)
Believe me
Truly

People make mistakes
Fathers
Mothers
People make mistakes
Holding to their own
Thinking they're alone
Honor their mistakes
Fight for their mistakes
Everybody makes
One another's terrible mistakes
Witches can be right, giants can be good
You decide what's right, you decide what's good

Just remember
Just remember
Someone is on your side (Our side)
Our side
Someone else is not
While we're seeing our side (Our side)
Our side
Maybe we forgot, they are not alone
No one is alone
Someone is on your side
No one is alone",No One Is Alone,2014
Daniel Huttlestone,"But it isn't my fault
I was given those beans!
You persuaded me to trade away
My cow for beans!
And without those beans
There'd have been no stalk
To get up to the giant's
In the first place!

Wait a minute, magic beans
For a cow so old
That you had to tell
A lie to sell it
Which you told!
Were they worthless beans?
Were they oversold?
Oh, and tell us who persuaded you
To steal that gold

See, it's your fault
No!
Yes, it's you fault
No!
Yes, it is!
It's not!
It's true

Wait a minute
But I only stole the gold
To get my cow back
From you!

So it's your fault!
Yes!
No, it isn't!
I'd have kept those beans
But our house was cursed
She made us get the cow to get
The curse reversed!

It's his father's fault
That the curse got placed
And the place got cursed
In the first place!

Oh!
Then it's his fault!
So
It was his fault!
No
Yes, it is
It's his
I guess

Wait a minute, though
I chopped down the beanstalk
Right, that's clear?
But without any beanstalk
Then what's queer
Is how did the second giant get down here
In the first place?
Second place?

Yes!
How?
Hmmm
Well,
Who had the other bean?
The other bean?
The other bean?
You pocketed the other bean
I didn't!
Yes I did
So it's your-
No, it isn't
'Cause I gave it to my wife!
So it's her fault!
No, it isn't!
Then whose is it?
Wait a minute!
She exchanged that bean
To obtain your shoe
So the one who knows what happened
To that bean is you!
You mean that old bean
That your wife, oh, dear
But I never knew,
And so I threw-
Well, don't look here!

So it's your fault!
But-
See, it's her fault!
But-
And it isn't mine at all!
But what?
Well, if you hadn't gone
Back up again
We were needy
You were greedy!
Did you need that hen?
But I got it for my mother!
So it's her fault then!
Yes, and what about the harp
In the third place?
The harp, yes!
She went and dared me to!
I dared you to?
You dared me to!
She said that I was scared
So she dared me!
No, I didn't!
So it's your fault!
Wait a minute!
If you hadn't dared him to
And you had left the harp alone,
We wouldn't be in trouble
In the first place!",Your Fault,2014
Daniel Indart,"Ollie told me I'm a fool. 
So I walked on down the road a mile, 
Went to the house that brings a smile
Sat upon my grandpa's knee 
And what do you think he said to me?

When you awake you will remember ev'rything
You will be hangin' on a string from your
When you believe
You will relieve the only soul
That you were born with to grow old and never know

Ollie showed me the fork in the road
You can take to the left or go straight to the right
Use your days and save your nights,
Be careful where you step, and watch wha-cha eat
Sleep with the light on and you got it beat

When you awake you will remember ev'rything 
You will be hangin' on a string from your
When you believe
You will relieve the only soul
That you were born with to grow old and never know

Ollie warned me it's a mean old world
The street don't greet ya, yes, it's true
But what am I supposed to do
Read the writing on the wall
I heard it when I was very small

When you awake you will remember ev'rything
You will be hangin' on a string from your
When you believe 
You will relieve the only soul
That you were born with to grow old and never know

Wash my hand in lye water
I got a date with the captains daughter 
You can go and tell your brother
We sure gonna love one another, oh! 
You may be right and ya might be wrong 
I ain't gonna worry all day long

Snow's gonna come and the frost gonna bite
My old car froze up last night 
Ain't no reason to hang your head 
I could wake up in the mornin' dead
Oh! And if I thought it would do any good
I'd stand on the rock where Moses stood",Lazy Afternoon,2007
Daniel Ingram,"My name is Pinkie Pie (hello)
And I am here to say (how ya doin'?)
I'm gonna make you smile, and I will brighten up your day-ay
It doesn't matter now (what's up?)
If you are sad or blue (howdy!)
'Cause cheering up my friends is just what Pinkie's here to do

'Cause I love to make you smile, smile, smile
Yes I do
It fills my heart with sunshine all the while
Yes it does

From these happy friends of mine

I like to see you grin (awesome)
I love to see you beam (rock on)
The corners of your mouth turned up
Is always Pinkie's dream (hoof-bump)
But if you're kind of worried
And your face has made a frown
I'll work real hard and do my best
To turn that sad frown upside down

'Cause I love to make you grin, grin, grin
Yes I do
Bust it out from ear to ear, let it begin
Just give me a joyful grin, grin, grin
And you fill me with good cheer

It's true, some days are dark and lonely
And maybe you feel sad
But Pinkie will be there to show you that it isn't that bad
There's one thing that makes me happy
And makes my whole life worthwhile
And that's when I talk to my friends and get them to smile

I really am so happy
Your smile fills me with glee
I give a smile, I get a smile
And that's so special to me

'Cause I love to see you beam, beam, beam
Yes I do
Tell me, what more can I say to make you see
That I do?
It makes me happy when you beam, beam, beam
Yes, it always makes my day

Come on everypony smile, smile, smile
Fill my heart up with sunshine, sunshine
All I really need's a smile, smile, smile

Yes a perfect gift for me
Is a smile as wide as a mile
To make me happy as can be
Smile, smile, smile, smile, smile
Come on and smile
Come on and smile",Smile Song [Buddygirrl Remix],2015
Daniel Iorio,"I know that absence might 
Make the heart grow fonder
Or is it ""out of sight
Out of mind"" I wonder
And do you yearn for me
When the nights grow cold
Til death us do part
To have and to hold
I wanna give you my love, my love, my love

But is it just me or am I all on my own again
You're up at John O'Groats, I'm down in Land's End
On you I depend

I see your face 
When I close my eyes
And there ain't no place
Like between your thighs
Don't want a life alone
All by myself
To honor and trust
In sickness and health
I wanna give you my love, my love, my love

But is it just me or am I all on my own again
You're at the Taj Mahal, I'm outside Big Ben
It's driving me round the bend

Forever and ever
And ever, amen
I wanna give you my love, my love, my love

But is it just me or am I all on my own again
You're in the Vatican, I'm in the Yemen
And it feels like the end
The end",Is It Just Me?,2008
Daniel J,"I love her converse rip piece
And the way she looks at me
No one does it better I swear
She wears her hair down makeup
She don't even need that stuff
Taking picture everywhere

And I would fight
I would run
I would fly
Into the sun

'Cause I never met a girl like you before
You don't think you're perfect
But you're everything I want and more
And I'll try to make you mine
Cross my heart and I hope to die

I never met a girl like you
Met a girl like you before
I never met a girl
Met a girl like you before

She wears her headphones rolling stones
They write all her favorite songs
Dancing around like she doesn't care
She got a tattoo who knew
That she's got a boyfriend too
But he don't even know that I'm there

And I would fight
I would run
I would fly
Into the sun

Daniel Jay Paul,"Once upon a time, there was a girl
She lived in the land of never-never
Where everything real is unreal
And only fairy tales come true
Something like me and you

But she believed that what she dreamed of could be real
So she strived on to make it come true
Fighting odds, not knowing what would come of her
Never giving up the hope within her

She carried on and on, because she believed
That once, once in a time in her lifetime
The things so unreal would be real

And in the morning, one day when she awoke
To find herself surrounded by the same old room
She was disappointed

So she dreamed and she dreamed
And she dreamed and she dreamed and she dreamed
And she said that fairy tales do come true
'Cause I believe, I believe

And she kept trying, and she kept right on fighting
Till one day she met a man who held her tight
And she fell in love

Once upon a time, in the land of never-never
Where all things real are unreal
There lived a girl who believed
That all things could be possible

And one day she did awake
And found herself somewhere else
Beside her a brand new face
Of someone that she loved",Once Upon a Time,2000

But I don’t wanna live here no more

I felt everything was effortless, I let you go

There's a calm that's real somewhere
There's a jungle stream and band that's playing
There's a tune worth whistling to
Don't be scared

You can't sit if you don't believe it

Painted over many times

The poet rambles
The world it scrambles
But who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men

Your shadow knows
It's right behind you all the way
Your shadow knows where you've been

That opened up my mind
That may at last please save me
And rid my cold, cold heart
Of the dark deep gloom

But I really have my own way, I guess that's why you're not here with me today

I said hey lady, what can you expect
When I'm lying on the floor

You're a lovely lady but you don't wanna be no girl of mine
Well the only thing you ever done for me was help me waste my time
And I saw you at the funeral, you were standing there like a temple
I said hi, how are you, hello
And I pulled up a casket and crawled in
Yes I did

Climbed up a mountain, and I looked around
Some kind of circus with all them clowns
I said hey wait a minute, can't we slow down a bit
And I almost got hit by a truck

Well it just goes to show you, that we're all on our own
Scrounging for our own share of good
Stab your brother in the back
And pick up your paycheck

Goodbye lonely heart drawings, it never did work anyhow
I'm looking for a nice girl and I don't want no cow
I'm heading out west
Gonna find me the best

There were lights and fireworks and cannons going off in your honor

And I was worried,

You were the girl
Who seemed to own the world
Everything was about you

I took a chance to call you my own
I didn't know a thing about you

thought you could love
What a fool I was

what's going on 
I was just singing my song
There's something mad about you

I took it wrong
You like my song
Why couldnt I have you
Crazy dream you done me wrong
You left me long
I couldnt stand to chance without you

you said the love was dead
And in my head
I just couldnt believe it

and on the phone you said
You never knew me at all

thought there was love
What a fool I was

and everything was in hyper-jinx
Just like an old time movie

you don't understand
Can't comprehend

I guess it doesn't really matter

and every dream a nightmare
And nothing really matters

Daniel Johnston,"It was love at first sight 
When I talked to her 
It was the beginning of a real good time 
All I knew was her 
And when I came around 
Love had lingered on my mind 

She said on the telephone 
She wished me well. 
So alive with a spell 
Until I hung up early 
I've realized 
I've been dead for so long 

All my memories of her 
Like a fading light I suffer 
Thinking of our love for so long 
Back in the early days 
I saw a lot of her 
She was the coolest girl in town 

And when I saw her standing there 
Everything was all right 
I took a journey in my mind 
And as I saw her beauty 
She was so kind 
That was a good time 

Everyday we met it was wild 
I felt like a child 
I loved to see her smile 
And as I played piano 
I was so inspired 
I always had a real good time 

And when last we met 
I just can't forget 
I took for sure I love her bad 
I just can't ignore 
Her loving response 
I always knew she'd be all right

She made me think I was okay 
And the love seemed so real 
I still got feelings for her 
And when I'm on tour 
Singing about her forever 
I'll remember blessings
And the good times we had

I really tried to play the game of love 
And I hate to loose 
Maybe I can win somehow 
And so I'll dream of her 
For a thousand years 
Until I see another girl

That's the way it always was
That's the way it always was",Love Not Dead,2003
Daniel Johnston,"If you think your thoughts so rationally
Then you might just see it's not so funny

Prey tell
The wishing well will get you eventually
Beware
What you are is what you're doing there

Love is lingering with you on it's mind
And it's giving you a moment so kind

Believe
Your broken heart could heal so dramatically
And with a little luck
You could see a better way again real soon

As we stare into each other's eyes
And each year just goes so fast and goodbye

Look around
What your friends are telling you so free
Be gone
It's all over as the sun does set once more

If you think that love has a chance with you
Maybe hope can shine a light so true

Just smile
You can win the victory so sweet
And know
It's just another day for you and me

And tomorrow ? no more sorrow
You can all her - if you want to

There's a new way ? why won't you try it
Heaven sent it and you'll believe it now

Love can save you now
Love can save you now
Love can save you now

Why can't we syrup 
For sorrow pancakes so flat

But the emptiness I feel 
Depression has got me down 
Drilling for the kill 
It's too late to suffer through 
God, I'll make you a deal: 
Just let me smile a while, for real. 

And when the evening comes 
I'll be on the run 
You were the only one 
That sure was fun 

To me it's never been any better 
And no kind of love has been any greater than you
For me, I can tell 

You shone like a sacred goddess in love 
Like a psycho hot as the sun 
Until we meet again, I won't give up 
It's such a wonder for us – our inner quest 

And so it starts 
The alligator when you appeared 
From never forever 
And you smiled on my poor suffering soul 
Blessed child, you are my treasure 
Can't you see, it's all an illusion

Walkin' in the street
We talked of God and the end of the world
I stuck my head in a fire hydrant

The night was cool. It was around the time that the bad ladies come out
While river rats broke windows and performed un-natural acts
We walked halfway across the town and sang in an amphitheater
Then we walked a little further and admired some graffiti

Dodging cars as we crossed the highway
We sure must have looked ugly
My shirt was soaked, the grass was wet
I stuck head in a fire hydrant

We talked of things in the Good Book
While there was a naked lady on TV
She had no care, she had no shame
She had little propellers on

My friend he said ""I can't help
But look at this naked lady's body""
I said ""dear friend you got a dirty mind
Stick yr head in a fire hydrant""

Earlier that evening
I went to a banquet
Hoping she might be there
But she wasn't so I went to this other girl's house
Who was freaked out on drugs

So later after that
After the first part of this song
On my way home I drove past this other girl's house

I wondered if she noticed me

standing on that battlefield by the man at war

""Does she love me"" he screamed with bombs bursting in the air
does she love me, will she understand me, I'm a man at war

Long trousers and a derby
Stands erect
And cracks the whip loudly

Turn a somersault after singing a verse

To stand and act mysterious
And to watch her blush.

I know I'm such a weird guy. 
She could never take me serious.
There's always that green monkey
In around or near us.

I think sometimes of holdin' her, 
But the picture gets all blurred. 
I see shadows dancin' on my wall.
Thoughts scatter like birds.

I wish to God i could touch her hand, 
Somehow make her understand,
The man I somehow wanna be,
The man I want her to make me.

But she stands so distant and rolls her eyes.
She leaves me and I don't know why.
Nothing seems to make much sense. 
I cant appreciate the sky.

And so I go home lonely, 
Like a wolf without a pack 
I got nothin to put my love in, 
Like groceries without a sack.

Maybe someday when she gets fat,
She'll think about what she's missed.
She'll know shell never get me back.
She'll feel just like the pits.

She'll sit lonely in her apartment,
Thinkin' about what might have been.
She'll know her man had come and went.
Maybe she'll take me seriously then.

Waiting for the sun to beat down on my head
In this broken bed

I laid awake and dreamt of ships
Passing through night
Searching for shelter
Stopping at no harbor

I heard the screaming waters
Call sixty sailors' names
Raging words, pounding on the sail
Like an angry whale

I felt the iron rudder skip
The smell of seeping oil
The heat of slipping rope
Failing hands, failing hope

Every sailor asks
Asks the question about the cargo
He is carrying

God's anger broke through the clouds
And He spilt the cargo for all to see

The fault of he who asks no questions
About the cargo he is carrying

And I paid for what I had
I looked for you way down below
Till I felt I was going mad

I think of you when I tell myself
And the fever rises high
I think of you and I get what's comin'
Sleeping in the Devil's bed

Oh, why, why, why, why, baby why?
Oh, why, why, why, why, why, why, baby why?

I woke up in the steady rain
I woke up when you said
""It's late and I'm feeling heavy
Could you hold my aching head?""

I found myself tangled in wire
I found you there in my dream
I found you in desire
You had left the Devil's bed

Daniel Lanois,"I looked at you, your lips were moving
But I did not hear what you said
You wanted me, you wanted my name
I was carrying two feet of lead

See the rising sun on this make-believe town
White shoe shine and leather, both of us so brown

I was in the water, you were dry
You yelled my name now I know why
I'm still learning how to crawl
I'm still learning how to crawl

If that big drum, drum is rumbling
Keep me in line, keep me from stumbling
When I first went down, everything was right
Skinny white leg, laying on my bed
Over there running, afraid to be found out

Tasting everything with a scream and shout
All I wanted I rejected

He ain't comin' in, 'til you lay the table
He ain't comin' in, not comin' to watch me fall
The killer moves in, moves right into your face
When everything seems to be in its right place
Can't wait for love, love to be king
Can't wait for the love, to come with its sting

You blew away in your blue dress
I lost the one that I loved best

I'm just learning how to crawl

Daniel Lanois,"You wake up and there's something there tugging at your sleeve
It's not the pitter-patter, the one in your dreams
Held on by the chain, the unbreakable chain
Held there by the chain, the unbreakable chain

You walk and you'll know that the wind is not passing you by
It's speaking and you listen and the tears don't come out when you cry
Cry, cry, cryin' won't break the unbreakable chain
Cryin' won't break the unbreakable chain

It's thirty years ago and you live with your decision
You talk to him in a prayer, you send out your transmission
But a prayer won't break the unbreakable chain
Your prayers won't break the unbreakable chain

Your baby's not yours but he walks the streets of your city
He wants to know you, there's no self pity, yeah
It's pulling at your heart, the unbreakable chain
Pulling at your heart with the unbreakable chain

And you, you put an ad in the paper, it's foolish but maybe
Maybe he'll see 'cause he's searching for mama mia
Oh mama here, mama feel the unbreakable chain
Mama feel the unbreakable chain

You can't believe that it's now, it's turned itself around
You'll fight to know the way that you look, but you meet him there in town
Oh, the joy and the fear of the unfailable pain
The joy and the fear of the unfailable pain

He stares at you and you step back and no words are spoken
You say hello to your boy and he says ""Mama you've awoken""

Yes, you have broken the unbreakable chain

You have broken the unbreakable chain
Yeah, you have broken the unbreakable chain

In search of you I feel my way,
Through slowest heaving night
Whatever fear invents, 
I swear it make no sense
I reach out through the border fence
Come down, come talk to me

From sleepy tears undone
From nippled skin as smooth as silk,

Like there's no one there at all
There's a tension pulling on your face
Come on, come talk to me

Won't you please talk to me

Breaking out through the silence
All the things that we both might say
And the heart it will not be denied
'Til we're both on the same damn side
All the barriers blown away

I said please talk to me
Won't you please come talk to me
Just like it used to be
Come on, come talk to me

Where nothing comes up to the top
Everything stays down where it's wounded

Wasn't thinking of anything specific
Like in a dream, when someone wakes up and screams
Nothing too very scientific

And there's no exit in any direction

Wasn't making any great connection
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme
Nothing that would pass inspection
Just thinking of a series of dreams

Dreams where the umbrella is folded
Into the path you are hurled
And the cards are no good that you're holding
Unless they're from another world

In one, numbers were burning
In another, I witnessed a crime
In one, I was running, and in another

I could not feel for the fear in my life
And from across the great divide, In the distance I saw a light

My body is bent and broken by long and dangerous sleep
I can't work the fields of Abraham and turn my head away
I'm not a stranger in the hands of the Maker

Standing there with broken wings
I have seen the flaming swords

Well I work the double shift 
In a bookstore on St. Clair 
While he pushed the burning ingots 
In Dofasco stinking air 
Where the truth bites and stings 
I remember just what we were 
As the noon bell rings for 
Blackhawk and the white winged dove 

Hold on to your aching heart 
I'll wipe the liquor from your lips 
A small town hero never dies 
He fades a bit and then he slips 
Down into the blast furnace 
In the heat of the open hearth 
And at the punch clock he remembers 
Blackhawk and the white winged dove 

I remember your leather boots 
Pointing up into the sky 
We fell down to our knees 
Over there where the grass grew high 
Love hunters in the night 
Our faces turned into the wind 
Blackhawk where are you know 
Blackhawk and the white winged dove 
We were Blackhawk where are you know 
We were Blackhawk where are you know 

Do you still have the ring I gave you 
On the banks of Lake Bear 
Where I felt certain that I knew you

Another cup of muscatel 
Wrapped in the strong arms of the Union

The worms in the barrel, the hanging sun
Those first nervous evenings of perfume and gin
The lost smell on your breath as I helped you get it in
The rush of your lips, the feel of your name
The beat in your heart, the devil's arcade

You said ""Heroes are needed, so heroes get made""
Somebody made a bet, somebody paid
The cool desert morning and nothing to save
Just metal and plastic where your body caved
The slow games of poker with Lieutenant Ray
In the ward with the blue walls, a sea with no name
Where you lie adrift with the heroes of the devil's arcade

You sleep and you dream, your buddies Charlie and James
And wake with a thick desert dust on your skin

Voice says ""don't worry, I'm here
Just whisper the word tomorrow in my ear""
House on a quiet street, a home for the brave
A glorious kingdom with the sun on your face

Rising from a long night as dark as the grave
On a thin chain of next moments and something like faith
On a morning to order a breakfast to make
A bed draped in sunshine, a body that waits
For the touch of your fingers, the end of the day

The beat of your heart, the beat of your heart
The beat of your heart, the beat of your heart
The beat of your heart, the beat of her heart
The beat of your heart, the slow burning away
Of the bitter fires of the devil's arcade

They built the Eiffel Tower to stand alone, but they could build another if they please

And sometimes something comes along and you know it's for sure the only one

Gone into that dark ether where you're still young and hard and cold
Just like when they built you, brother, they broke the mold

Now your death is upon us and we'll return your ashes to the earth
And I know you'll take comfort in knowing you've been roundly blessed and cursed
But love is a power greater than death, just like the songs and stories told

There's no reason we should cry

When you need to be with me
Just think real hard we'll be together

Across that empty sky to feel you near

That's where you'll always be
Deep as the deep blue sea
Close as the air I breathe

Well the dogs and the people they gather round
As the caravan moves out of town
Moving on with the passengers
To another place
I don't know where love begins
Or how it grows or why it ends
We know when we keep ours
Where it can never change with the wind oh no

Can't you tell
You got me going crazy
Don't you feel
A little reckless maybe
Is it real
Or is it just a dream that we create

Has let me down again

Daniel Lavoie,"L'amour est juste avec les gens
Il donne, il donne, autant qu'il prend
Même qu'il rapproche les continents
Toujours et toujours en mouvement

L'amour est juste un coup de sang
Un coup de coeur évidemment
Chacun vers l'autre l'on se tend
Quand on l'écoute et qu'on l'entend

L'amour est juste un sentiment
Mais on n'pourrait pas vivre sans
L'amour est juste et justement
C'est pour ça qu'on lui ment souvent

L'amour est juste un mur en blanc
Où la vie s'écrit sûrement
Chaque mot, chaque geste lent
Il en fait des petits aimants

L'amour est juste un peu de vent
Qui souffle sur nous doucement
Qu'on soit pareils ou différents
L'amour est un sable mouvant

L'amour est juste un sentiment
Après lui, rien n'est plus comme avant
L'amour est juste et justement
C'est pour ça qu'on lui ment souvent

L'amour est juste un bon moment
Mais pas toujours où on l'attend
Qu'on soit d'accord ou pas vraiment
L'amour nous attend au tournant

L'amour est juste notre enfant
Il naît de nous à chaque instant
Comme on naît de lui tout autant

L'amour est juste un sentiment
Un peu, beaucoup, passionnément
L'amour est juste et justement
C'est pour ça qu'on lui ment souvent",L' Amour Est Juste,2004
Daniel Lavoie,"Ils arrachent la terre
A la terre à leurs pieds
Ils tracent des frontières
Pour se les disputer
Ils sèchent les rivières
Brûlent bois et forêts

Inversent les marées
Ils cherchent le profit
Sans même en profiter
Se lancent des défis
Comme on jette les dés
Ils sèment l'injustice
Récoltent la misère
Au bord du précipice
Ils regardent en arrière

Bénies soient les femmes qui aiment encore les hommes
Quand on voit ce qu'ils font, quand on en fait la somme
Bénies soient les femmes qui aiment encore les hommes

Ils se créent des empires
Et des palais de verre
Ils prennent leurs désirs
Pour ce qu'il reste à faire
Ils réclament l'amour
Ne pensent qu'à le faire

Demain pas mieux qu'hier

Bénies soient les femmes qui aiment encore les hommes
Quand on voit ce qu'ils font, quand on en fait la somme
Bénies soient les femmes qui aiment encore les hommes

Ils se donnent raison
Ils se donnent le temps
Exigent le pardon
Mais n'en font pas autant

Blottis, seuls et tremblants

Daniel Lavoie,"Si je cultive l'Amor, 
Si frénétiquement
Jusqu'à perdre le Nord,
Dans mon aveuglement

C'est qu'au fond de ma mémoire
N'est qu'un foutoir sans nom
D'où seul l'écho répond,
Quand je demande à voir

Dites à l'amour qu'est ""mi amor""
Que c'est pas moi qu'ai tous les torts
Dites à la mort, qu'est sans amour
Que je veux bien laisser mon tour

Si je poursuis l'Amor,
Avec acharnement
Tous mes boyaux dehors
Et mes tripes en avant,

C'est que nos solitudes
Sont de fieffées menteuses
Qui parlent de quiétude
Mais sont des emmerdeuses

Si je parle de l'Amor,
Comme d'une servitude
Un mauvais coup du sort,
Sur un triste prélude

C'est que même la Grande Ourse,
N'a jamais eu le choix
Elle ignore dans sa course,
Qui conduit le convoi

Dites à l'amour qu'est ""mi amor""
Que c'est pas moi qu'ai tous les torts
Dites à la mort, qu'est sans amour
Que je veux bien laisser mon tour

Et si je t'aime, Amor,
D'une insatiable peur
Quand le ciel bande encore,
Quelques semblants d'ardeur

C'est que ma vie est l'entre,
De cette cruche morte
Qu'un vieil enfant éventre,
Et que la terre emporte

Un train comme il y en a tant
Sous nos paupières la cendre
Feux de paille de nos tourments

Et cette limaille de fer
Entre leurs mains frigides
Qui leur parlait de l'enfer

Ses printemps majeurs
Peut-être mille peut-être cent
Ses yeux comme une douceur
De l'amour pour un chagrin
Et cet éclat de verre
Ce cri ensanglanté
Ces rêves de lumière
Que leurs mains ont tranchés

Les clochers en rose et blanc

Et le silence immense

Un reste d'émotion,
Une ombre de caresse,
Des poussières d'illusion,
Un fragment de sourire,
Un moment sans souffrir,
Tes lèvres sur les miennes
Comme un garrot sur ma peine.

Tes cheveux sur ma joue
En filament de lune,
Ton souffle dans mon cou
Vient dissiper l'amertume.
Une larme de tes pleurs
A respirer en secret,
Retrouver ton odeur
Dans le brouillard de mes regrets.

Me couler sous ta blouse
Et sentir sur ma poitrine,
Ton cœur jouer un dernier blues,
Un poème à l'encre de chine,
Dériver sur ton corps
Comme des notes de steel-guitar,
Remonter les courants forts
Jusqu'au récif du regard.

Tes yeux de mauves de louve
Qui s'entrouvent comme un rideau
Sur les morceaux de chair vive
De notre histoire en lambeaux,

Un éclat de porcelaine
Dans l'oreille d'un chien fou
Qui hurle

Making me remember there is no tomorrow

Of a cool clear morning she came to me
She didn't say a word, and all that could be heard
Was her breath as it jumbled

Plunking soft and steady
Then the oboe comes in
With a sweet simple melody

Is the harmony ready?
Now trumpet, you blow
Violin, strike the bow

Oh, this is my fabulous song

If you follow me, you won’t go wrong
Bluejays and chickadees
Flutter outside my window
To and fro
Like a violin bow

Oh, this is my fabulous song

Beautiful music awaits in my heart
That’s where it starts
And it flows out of my hands
Into the magical world
Of melody, harmony and rhythm
And then I’ve written
This fabulous song

That touches your soul
Makes you feel whole
Then you discover that dreams
They really do come true
Your future is hopeful and bright
And you can write

Daniel Lavoie,"Il me reste un pays à te dire
Il me reste un pays à nommer
Il est au tréfonds de toi
N’a ni président ni roi
Il ressemble au pays même
Que je cherche au coeur de moi

Voilà le pays que j’aime

Il me reste un pays à prédire
Il me reste un pays à semer

Vaste et beau comme la mer
Avant d’être découvert
Puis ne tient pas plus de place
Qu’un brin d’herbe sous l’hiver
Voilà mon jeu et ma chasse

Il te reste un pays à connaître
Il te reste un pays à donner

C’est un pont que je construis
De ma nuit jusqu’à ta nuit
Pour traverser la rivière
Froide, obscure, de l’ennui
Voilà le pays à faire

Il me reste un nuage à poursuivre
Il me reste une vague à dompter

Homme, un jour tu sonneras
Cloches de ce pays-là
Sonnez, femmes, joies et cuivres
C’est notre premier repas
Voilà le pays à vivre

Il nous reste un pays à surprendre
Il nous reste un pays à manger

Tous ces pays rassemblés
Feront l’homme champ de blé
Chacun sème sa seconde
Sous l’amour qu’il faut peler
Voilà le pays du monde

Il nous reste un pays à comprendre
Il nous reste un pays à changer",Il  Me Reste Un Pays,2011
Daniel Lavoie,"Le froid mordait mon coeur gelé
Le vent hurlait ma solitude
J’aurais au diable vendu mon âme
Pour sentir la chaleur de ma douce compagne.

Le malin vit belle occasion
De tenter mes rêves, d’ouvrir l’horizon
De faire miroiter la chaleur de mon ange
Inaccessible en cette morte saison.

Il m’apparut coiffé de cornes
Son feu brûla mon visage morne
La terreur laissa place à mon fol espoir
Car ma douce compagne je mourrais de revoir

Son marché fut ,fort équitable
Ce demon ne semblait pas mauvais diable
Dans un canot vers elle pourrais-je voler
Sans toutefois d’aucune croix m’approcher

Et vers le ciel je partis
Soutenu par tous les feux de l’enfer réunis

Au bord du rivage je l’avais quittée
Je vis son dernier souffle s’envoler
Mon canot frappa la croix du clocher
Dans ses bras je suis tombé.",Chasse-Galerie,2014
Daniel Lavoie,"Le roi Minos refusa d’immoler un jeune taureau promis
A Poséidon, dieu des poissons
Le dieu irrité se vengea sur l’épouse
Et lui inspira la passion pour le bestiau en question

Tu n’as voulu sacrifier la bête
Alors à la bête ta femme s’est unie
De l’étreinte animale le Minotaure naquit
Quatorze innocents tu sacrifieras pour lui

Minor presse Dédale de construire le labyrinthe
Pour y enfermer la bête, dissoudre cette fable
Captif en ces murs, le Minotaure s’abreuve
Du sang des innocents immolés chaque neuf ans

La belle Ariane, fille de Minos avait donné son coeur
Au jeune Thésée qui venait d’ailleurs
Pour le guider sans frapper un os
Elle demande à Dédale les plans secrets du labyrinthe

Thésée avec rage libéra les otages
Il fit cadeau de la mort au sanguinaire Minotaure 

Minos en colère se venge sur Dédale et sur son fils Icare
Il les enferme dans le labyrinthe
Prisonnier de son oeuvre, Dédale ne s’avoue vaincu
Car par la voie du ciel il connaît son salut

Avec plumes et cire, Dédale construit des ailes
Qui en quelques battements les tirent vers le ciel
Icare, mon fils, ne vole pas trop haut
Car brûlerait tes ailes la chaleur du soleil

Ivre de liberté, Icare ne freine sa montée
Il laisse le vent du ciel caresser ses ailes
Libéré du poids de l’être enfin il se sent vivre
De cette ascension celeste son âme s’enivre

Dans son interminable chute, Icare frôle son père
Qui ravala ses larmes, impuissant et amer
La mer ouvrit son flanc pour lui donner la mort
Puis se referma sur lui sans regret sans remords.",Icare,2014

J’aborde les rives de ton vase clos

Petite licorne, j’entends couler tes sanglots
Les hommes t’ont blessée depuis le berceau
De ta peau ta vie s’enfuit, quel fléau
Je veux t’emporter loin de tes bourreaux

Daniel Lavoie,"Le fils du roi, trop confiant
Guida sa belle au bord de l’étang
D’un geste lent, a tiré
Le mauvais canard est tombé

La blanche bête sentit son flanc
Tout lentement se vider de son sang
Du doux plumage privé du vent
S’enfuit son dernier printemps

Tu as tué mon canard blanc
Tu as tué mon canard blanc
Ô fils du roi, tu es méchant!

La douce belle s’enfuit dans la nuit
Qui lentement envahit le temps
Son pauvre prince perdit la vie
Au fond d’un sillon rouge sang

Tu as tué mon canard blanc
Tu as tué mon canard blanc
Ô fils du roi, tu es méchant!

La douce belle a épousé
Un noir seigneur au coeur masqué
Un sombre diable qui dans l’ombre guettait

La lumière pourra briller.",Le  Noir Et Le Blanc,2014
Daniel Lavoie,"I

Sur l'onde calme et noire où dorment les étoiles 
La blanche Ophélia flotte comme un grand lys 
Flotte très lentement, couchée en ses longs voiles 
On entend dans les bois lointains des hallalis.

Voici plus de mille ans que la triste Ophélie 
Passe, fantôme blanc, sur le long fleuve noir 
Voici plus de mille ans que sa douce folie 
Murmure sa romance à la brise du soir.

Le vent baise ses seins et déploie en corolle 
Ses grands voiles bercés mollement par les eaux 
Les saules frissonnants pleurent sur son épaule 
Sur son grand front rêveur s'inclinent les roseaux.

Les nénuphars froissés soupirent autour d'elle 
Elle éveille parfois, dans un aune qui dort
Quelque nid, d'où s'échappe un petit frisson d'aile 
Un chant mystérieux tombe des astres d'or.

II

O pâle Ophélia! belle comme la neige! 
Oui, tu mourus, enfant, par un fleuve emporté 
C'est que les vents tombant des grands monts de Norvège 
T'avaient parlé tout bas de l'âpre liberté.

C'est qu'un souffle, tordant ta grande chevelure 
A ton esprit rêveur portait d'étranges bruits 
Que ton coeur écoutait le chant de la Nature 
Dans les plaintes de l'arbre et les soupirs des nuits.

C'est que la voix des mers folles, immense râle 
Brisait ton sein d'enfant, trop humain et trop doux 
C'est qu'un matin d'avril, un beau cavalier pâle 
Un pauvre fou, s'assit muet à tes genoux!

Ciel! Amour! Liberté! Quel rêve, ô pauvre Folle! 
Tu te fondais à lui comme une neige au feu 
Tes grandes visions étranglaient ta parole 
- Et l'Infini terrible effara ton oeil bleu.

III

Et le Poète dit qu'aux rayons des étoiles 
Tu viens chercher, la nuit, les fleurs que tu cueillis 
Et qu'il a vu sur l'eau, couchée en ses longs voiles 
La blanche Ophélia flotter, comme un grand lys.",Ophélie,2014
Daniel Lavoie,"Ils brisèrent leurs ailes à la fin du mystère
A vouloir séduire la belle, faire reluire son regard
Seuls les nobles sangs pouvaient tenter leur chance
Mais pour caresser la belle, il fallait l’affronter

En combat singulier, au sabre ou à l’épée
Elle ne donnait qu’une leçon, la dernière sans remission

Si le sang boit le sang, la vie n’a plus de sens
Si le sang boit le sang, non vraiment plus rien n’a d’importance

Les nobles furent outrés de cette vaste hécatombe
Il fallait clouer la belle aux tréfonds d’une tombe

Ils se rendirent quérir un bel et noble sire
Tombeur de femmes et fine lame pour enfin la faire périr

Si le sang boit le sang, la vie n’a plus de sens
Si le sang boit le sang, non vraiment plus rien n’a d’importance


Mais entre ces deux-là, un grand courant passa
L’amour vibrait plus que fort, pourrait-il vaincre la mort

Un mystérieux parchemin croisa leur destin
L’expéditive demoiselle en perdit ses ailes
De son adversaire elle partageait le père 
Dans leurs vifs vaisseaux coulait la meme rivière

Si le sang boit le sang, la vie n’a plus de sens
Si le sang boit le sang, non vraiment plus rien n’a d’importance

Brisera-t-elle son serment, faire rendre gorge aux nobles
Et bien laver dans le sang l’affront fait à sa mère
Délaissé dans la boue en raison de son rang
Son père ce noble salaud l’avait larguée lâchement

Si le sang boit le sang, la vie n’a plus de sens
Si le sang boit le sang, non vraiment plus rien n’a d’importance

Son frère retrouvé trancha le débat
Car malgré leur sang mêlé, elle fondit dans ses bras
Cet amour interdit fut entre tous béni
Il fut panacée du coeur et la haine s’évanouit.",Le  Sang,2014
Daniel Lavoie,"Le marin glisse sur le dos de la mer
Où chaque nuit ses rêves espèrent
Depuis qu’elle est partie
Il y engloutit sa vie

Et Dieu ou diable enfin il prie
Pour la rejoindre au dernier port
Depuis cette triste nuit
L’amour est plus fort que la mort

La nuit s’enfuit quand le chant retentit
En un seul souffle son coeur revit
Il boit cette voix tendre
Il plonge en ses méandres

Suivant l’appel de sa douce sirène
Du vieux voilier il prend les rênes
Prisonnier de ses chimères
Il se perd aux confins des mers

Le chant l’emporte tout droit vers la tempête
Où les récifs lui font sa fête
La barre s’échappe, la coque éclate
Le vent déchire, lacère et frappe

Au bord de l’eau il se réveille
Émergeant d’un lointain sommeil
Sa douce belle blottie contre son flanc
Le caresse de son regard de sirène d’argent.",Sirène,2014

And he lights his pipe with a grin
And the moon so bright, like a neon light
Shines on me & my friend
You can sense the new day, not far away
Like a silent bubble ready to burst
But right here, right now, with 'em crickets lullabies
It's so good to see what it's worth
Feel alive, feel alive, feel alive

It may bring me down in a terrible mood
Waist-deep down in the mud
Put a load on my shoulder, like a five ton boulder
And I can't shake it off like I should
Adversities may line up, can't find a reason to smile
All you want to do is give up, sit right down and cry
But on the positive side, I'm feeling alive
Listening to the Son's of Thunder
Sanctified music from an up-lit hill
Tonight I can't go under
The night comes down on Duke's verandah
And everything, everything is alright

I believe in love like a burning fire
Glowing through my soul
Burning down every distance
So the divided can come to a whole
And if the world don't care for dreamers
That's the odds we'll have to stand
But tonight I ain't gon' worry
Just gon' sit right here with my friend
And feel alive, feel alive, feel alive

It was such a great night , I was full of delight

I dreamed I held you in my arms

Daniel Lussier,"When I had you to myself 
I didn't want you around 
Those pretty faces always made you 
Stand out in a crowd 
But someone picked you from the bunch 
One glance was all it took 
Now it's much too late for me 
To take second look 

Oh baby give me one more chance 
To show you that I love you 
Won't you please send me back in your heart 

Oh darlin' I was blind to let you go 
But now since I see you in his arms 
I want you back 
Yes I do now 
I want you back 
Ooh ooh baby 
Yeah yeah, naw 

Trying to live without your love 
Is one long sleepless night 
Let me show you girl 
That I know wrong from right 

Every street you walk on 
I leave tear stains on the ground 
Following the girl 
I didn't even want around 
Oh baby give me one more chance 
To show you that I love you 
Won't you please send me back in your heart

Daniel Mair,"I've searched through every city; every country
To find a girl (the perfect girl)
A girl who'll be the one; the one to marry
To marry me (to marry me)

I came I saw I conquered just like Caesar
Or so it seems (yes so it seems)
A knight in shining armour on a charger
The stuff of dreams (the stuff of dreams).

Mamma Mia what am I to do?
All these beauties, which one will I choose?
Could it be her? Or maybe her?
I just don't know who it should be  

So, I'll take them home to mama and let her decide for me.
In Spain I met Maria; full of fire
What Latin style
In France it was Elisa; such a teaser

That made me smile
The English girl was pretty what a pity
She was so shy, I wonder why?
And Lorna from California I should warn ya

Was free and wild, and I mean wild!
Mama Mia, what a mess I'm in!
Endless choices, where do I begin?
Could it be her? Or maybe her?

Perhaps Suzanne or Emily?
How will I know if she's the girl to love and hold eternally?
O, I'll take her home to mama and let her decide for me!",Home to Mamma,2005
Daniel Mark Faller,"Well, I had a buddy back in '81,
And we made ourselves a pact.
We were headin' for the new pipeline,
We were never comin' back.
Well we worked 80 hours making time and a half,
But La Grange was too damn hot.
We drove back home at the end of that week
And we spent it all on pot.

[Chorus]
So I'll see you in Houston,
If I ever get out that way,
I'll see you in Dallas,
But I won't have long to stay,
If you're ever out west son,
And you're feeling like slowing down,
I'll see you around,
Around my hometown.

Well, I played ball every single fall,
I could run just like the wind.
Went to college like they asked me too
But they didn't ask my friends.
Don't think I seen a single classroom,
But I drank a lot of beer.
My buddies still love to listen to me when I talk about that year.

[Chorus]

Now I got myself a little band,
And we're pretty good I guess
But I never learned how to wear my hair,
And I never learned how to dress.
So I'm leaving for the last time honey,
I'm never more to roam.
Gonna pack my bags a little heavy this time gonna head my ass back home.

So I'll see you in Nashville,
If I ever get out that way.
I'll see you in Austin,
But I won't have long to stay,
If you're ever out west son,
And you're feeling like slowin down.
I'll see you around,
Around my hometown.
I'll see you around,

All the birds are leaving
But how can they know
It's time for them to go?

Before the winter fire
I will still be dreaming
I have no thought of time

For who knows
Where the time goes?
And who knows where the time goes?

Sad, deserted shore
Your fickle friends are leaving
Ah, but then you know
It's time for them to go

But I will still be here
I have no thought of leaving
I do not count the time

For who knows
Where the time goes?
And who knows where the time goes?

And I am not alone
While my love is near me
I know it shall be so
Until it's time to go

So come the storms of winter
And then the birds in spring again
I do not fear the time

Where the time goes?
And who knows where the time goes?

Stop me if you think that you've
Heard this one before
Stop me, oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before

Nothing's changed
I still love you, oh, I still love you
...Only slightly, only slightly less than I used to, my love

I was delayed, I was way-laid
An emergency stop
I saw the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
And the pain was enough to make

And plan a mass murder

Oh, who said I'd lied because I never? I never !
Who said I'd lied because I never?

And broke my knee
And broke my spleen

Who said I'd lied to her?

Oh, who said I'd lied? Because I never, I never
Who said I'd lied? Because I never

get out my life why don't you

With her lips like cherry wine
She kissed me, said she loved me

Don't you fade away; don't you be that kind

Take a message to my friend
That the glamour of the city life
Is as empty as the wind
It'll steal away love's joy;

Seem like something warm and fine.

Tal vez mañana, yo despierte solo
Pero por el momento, quiero estar soñando
No me despiertes tú, no ves que así yo soy feliz
Consciente estoy mi amor que no eres para mí

No hay necesidad que me desprecies
Tú ponte en mi lugar, a ver qué harías
La diferencia entre tú y yo sería, corazón
Que yo en tu lugar, que yo en tu lugar
Sí, sí te amaría",La Diferencia,2005

Wollen Schulabschlüsse
Kinder machen

Ich will lieber Fußabdrücke hinterlassen
Auf dem Mond
Deshalb laufe ich
Streife durch das Hinterland
Pausenlos
Seit ich meine Schleife selber binden kann
Nenn mich einen Freiheitsliebenden
Einen Getriebenen
Meinetwegen einen Fliehenden
Auf Hip-Hop hängen gebliebenen
Schon Run DMC sagten zu mir
""Walk this Way""

Wenn das Reisefieber mich packt
Denn dann bin ich schnell auf der Stelle hier weg

Ich bin so lange schon am gehen
Ich hab entzündete Achillessehnen

Ich will es sehen
Und jeder Schritt tut weh
Aber scheinbar sehn ich mich nicht nach einem neuen Leben
So wie Frauen die die Pille nehmen
Und ich wähl nie den Mittelweg
Nie den Ausweg
Nie den gleichen Weg
Ich such meinen Weg
Und wenn er mal nicht weiter geht
(Bam bam ba bam)
Bin ich mein eigenes Straßenbauamt
Hab an meinen Füßen soviel Blasen oh man
Oh manchmal mags so aussehen als ob

Werde ich noch schneller
Und ich rappe Acapella
Und ich wette diese Rapper bleiben vor mir steh'n
Ich will allen hier beweisen das da noch mehr geht

Packe Metaphern in Takte
Fucke die andern nie ab
Ich paffe die Cannabispflanze
Nein ich mache nicht schlapp
Egal ob breit wie'n Sumo
High wie'n UFO

Daniel O'Donnell,"Standing in line at the sandwich shop
My eyes browse through the menu then came to a stop
I licked my lips and gave my tummy a rub
Something caught my eye, it was a meatball sub

Meatballs, mozzarella, pepperoni
Swiss cheese, yes please, all served on a hoagie
The cashier asked how I'd be taking this treat
One for here, one to go, and make them both on wheat

I said wait, this should be more Italiano
Take these back and add some Romano
It felt like Burger King 'cause I had it my way
But I was eating fresh 'cause I was really at Subway

All that sauce, all that cheese
All those meatballs, still I'm not obese
I'd be the happiest Italian guy
If I had meatball sandwiches stacked to the sky
Scarf some down and let the music fade
It's the meatball sandwich serenade

Daniel O'Donnell,"If you ever go across the sea to Ireland, 
Then maybe at the closing of your day; 
You will sit and watch the moonrise over Claddagh, 
And see the sun go down on Galway Bay, 

Just to hear again the ripple of the trout stream, 
The women in the meadows making hay; 
And to sit beside a turf fire in the cabin, 
And watch the barefoot gossoons at their play, 

For the breezes blowing over the seas from Ireland, 
Are perfumed by the heather as they blow; 
And the women in the uplands digging praties, 
Speak a language that the strangers do not know, 

For the strangers came and tried to teach their way,] 
They scorned us just for being what we are; 
But they might as well go chasing after moonbeams, 
Or light a penny candle from a star. 

And if there is going to be a life hereafter, 
And somehow I am sure there's going to be; 
I will ask my God to let me make my heaven, 
In that dear land across the Irish Sea.",Galway Bay,1997
Daniel O'Donnell,"Chorus: Ring a ring a rosie,
as the light declines,
I remember Dublin city
in the rare old times.


Raised on songs and stories,
heroes of renown.
The passing tales and glories,
that once was Dublin town.
The hallowed halls and houses,
the haunting children's rhymes.
That once was part of Dublin,
in the rare old times.


Chorus

Oh me name it is Sean Dempsey
as Dublin as can be,
Born hard and late in Pimlico,
in a house that ceased to be.
By trade I was a cooper,
lost out to redundancy.
Like my house that fell to progress,
my trade's a memory.


And I courted Peggy Diugnan,
as pretty as you please,
A rogue and a child of Mary,
from the rebel Liberties.
I lost her to a student chap,
with skin as black as coal.
When he took her off to Birmingham,
she stole away my soul.


Chorus

The years have made me bitter,
the gargle dims my brain,
'Cause Dublin keeps on changing,
and nothing seems the same.
The pillar and the Met. have gone,
the Royal long since pulled down,
As the gray unyielding concrete,
makes a city of my town.


Chorus

Fare thee well sweet Anna Liffey,
I can no longer stay,
And watch the new glass cages,
that spring up along the quay.
My mind's too full of memories,
too old to hear new chimes,
I'm part of what was Dublin,
in the rare old times.


Chorus

Daniel O'Donnell,"I've met some folk who say that I'm a dreamer 
And I've no doubt there's truth in what they say 
For sure a body's bound to be a dreamer 
When all the the things he loves are far away

And precious things are dreams unto an exile 
They take him through a land across sea 
Especially when it happens he's in exile 
From that dear lovely Isle of Innisfree

And when the moonlight peeps across the rooftops 
Of this great city, wondrous though it be 
I scarcely feel the beauty or the magic 
I'm once again back home in Inisfree

I wander o'er green hills and dreamy valleys 
And find a peace no other land could know 
I hear the birds make music fit for angels 
And see the rivers laughing as they flow.

And then into a humble shack I wander 
My own sweet home and tenderly behold 
The folks I love around the turf fire gathered 
On bended knees, their rosary is told

But dreams don't last though dreams are not forgotten 
When we are back to stern reality. 
And though they pave the footways here with gold dust 
I still would choose the Isle of Inisfree

I still would choose the Isle of Inisfree",The Isle of Innisfree,1997
Daniel O'Donnell,"Oh, Mary, this London's a wonderful sight
With people here working by day and by night
They don't sow potatoes, nor barley, nor wheat
But there's gangs of them digging for gold in the street
At least when I asked them that's what I was told
So I just took a hand at this diggin' for gold
But for all that I found there I might as well be
Where the Mountains of Mourne sweep down to the sea

I believe that when writin' a wish you expressed
As to how the fine ladies in London were dressed
Well, if you'll believe me, when asked to a ball
Faith they don't wear a top to their dresses at all
Oh, I've seen them meself and you could not in trath
Say if they were bound for a ball or a bath
Don't be startin' them fashions now, Mary Macree
Where the Mountains of Mourne sweep down to the sea

I've seen England's King from the top of a bus
I never knew him, though he means to know us
And tho' by the Saxon we once were oppressed
Still I cheered, God forgive me, I cheered with the rest
And now that he's visited Erin's green shore
We'll be much better friends than we've been heretofore
When we've got all we want we're as quiet as can be
Where the Mountains of Mourne sweep down to the sea

You remember young Peter O'Loughlin, of course
Well, now he is here at the head of the force
I met him today, I was crossing the Strand
And he stopped the whole street with wan wave of his hand
And there we stood talkin' of days that are gone
While the whole population of London looked on
But for all these great powers he's wishful like me
To be back where the dark Mourne sweeps down to the sea

There's beautiful girls here, oh, never you mind
With beautiful shapes nature never designed
And lovely complexions all roses and cream
But O'Loughlin remarked with regard to the same
""That if at those roses you venture to sip
The colours might all come away on your lip
So I'll wait for the wild rose that's waitin' for me

Daniel O'Donnell,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1997

Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;
That on the Cross, my burden gladly bearing, 
He bled and died to take away my sin.

Across the ocean wild and wide
To where your heart has ever been

And tears bedim your loving eyes.

Your heart was ever fond and true.

I scarcely ever see them now
Though many, many times I see
A dark'ning shadow on your brow.

To that dear home beyond the sea
My Kathleen shall again return.
And when thy old friends welcome thee
Thy loving heart will cease to yearn.

Beside your mother's humble cot
And brightest rays of sunshine gleam
There all your grief will be forgot.

I'll live in memory's garden dear with happy days we've known
In spring I'll wait for roses red, when fades the lilacs bloom
And in early fall when brown leaves fall, I'll catch a glimpse of you

Should you go first and I remain, for battles to be fought
Each thing you've touched along the way, will be a hallowed spot
I'll hear your voice I'll see your smile though blindly I may grope
The memory of your helping hand will buoy me on with hope

Beyond the sunset, oh blissful morning
When with our savior, heaven is begun
Earth's toiling ended, oh glory dawning
Beyond the sunset when day is done

Should you go first and I remain, to finish with the scroll
No lessening shadows shall ever creep in to make this life seem droll
We've known so much of happiness, we've had our cup of joy
And memory is one gift of God that death cannot destroy

I want to know each step you take that I may walk the same
For someday down that lonely road, you'll hear me call your name
Should you go first and I remain, one thing I'll have you do
Walk slowly down that long long path, for soon I'll follow you

In that fair homeland, we'll know no parting
Beyond the sunset for ever more

The longer I hold on, the longer this goes on
The harder that it's going to be

The right thing and just let her be

Making two times I've told her goodbye

Daniel O'Donnell,"A poor orphan girl named Maria
Was walking to market one day
She stopped for a rest by the roadside
Where a bird with a broken wing lay
A few moments passed till she saw it
For it's feathers were covered with sand
But soon clean and wrapped it was traveling
In the warmth of Maria's small hand

She happily gave her last peso
On a cage made of rushes and twine
She fed it loose corn from the market
And watched it grow stronger with time

Now the Christmas Eve service was coming
And the church shone with tinsel and light
And all of the townfolk brought presents
To lay by the manger that night
There were diamonds and incense and perfumes
In packages fit for a king
But for one ragged bird in a small cage
Maria had nothing to bring

She waited till just before midnight
So no one could see her go in
And crying she knelt by the manger
For her gift was unworthy of Him

Then a voice spoke to her through the darkness
Maria, what brings you to me
If the bird in the cage is your offering
Open the door, let me see
Though she trembled, she did as he asked her
And out of the cage the bird flew
Soaring into the rafters
On a wing that had healed good as new

Just then the midnight bells rang out
And the little bird started to sing
A song that no words could recapture
Whose beauty was fit for a king

Now Maria felt blessed just to listen
To that cascade of notes sweet and long
As her offering was lifted to heaven
By the very first nightingale's song",The Gift,2002

Treat them to late nights, sing a few songs

No matter where I go it's in my soul

Daniel O'Donnell,"When I was young and went to school
They taught me how to write
To take the chalk and make a mark
And hope it turns out right
Well that's the way it is with love
And what you did to me
I wrote it so you'd know
That I was yours eternally

[Chorus]
But my tears have washed I love you
From the blackboard of my heart
It's too late to clean the slate
And make another start
I'm satisfied the way things are
Although we're far apart
My tears have washed I love you from
The blackboard of my heart

If you'd been true the way you should
And not have gone astray
These tears would not have fallen down
And washed the words away
No need to talk, 'cause if the chalk
Should write those words again It will be for someone else
Not things that might have been

You have a right
Desira - desiderata

Go placidly amid the noise and haste, 
And remember what peace there may be, in silence.
As far as possible without surrender, 
Be on good terms with all persons.
Speak your truth quietly and clearly, 
And listen to others, 
Even the dull and ignorant; 
They too have their story.

Avoid loud and aggressive persons, 
They are vexations to the spirit.
If you compare yourself with others, 
You may become vane and bitter; 

For always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. 

You are a child of the universe, 
No less than the trees and the stars; 
You have a right to be here.
And whether or not it is clear to you, 
No doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.

Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.
Keep interested in your own career, 
However humble; 
It is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.
Exercise caution in your business affairs; 
For the world is full of trickery.
But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; 
Many persons strive for high ideals; 
And everywhere life is full of heroism.

Be yourself.
Especially do not feign affection.
Neither be cynical about love; 
For in the face of all aridity and disenchantment
It is as perennial as the grass.

Take kindly the council of the years, 
Gracefully surrendering the things of youth.
Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.
But do not distress yourself with imaginings.
Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.
Beyond a wholesome discipline; 
Be gentle with yourself.

You are a child of the universe, 
No less than the trees and the stars; 
You have a right to be here.
And whether or not it is clear to you, 
No doubt the universe is unfolding; 
As it should.

Therefore be at peace with god, 
Whatever you conceive him to be, 
And whatever your labors and aspirations, 
In the noisy confusion of life, 
Keep peace with your soul.

With all it's sham, 
Drudgery and broken dreams, 
It is still a beautiful world.
Be careful. strive to be happy.

And some day for my sake, she may let me take the bloom from my wild Irish Rose.

They may sing of their rose, which by other names,
Would smell just as sweetly, they say.
But I know that my Rose would never consent
To have that sweet name taken away.
Her glances are shy when e'er I pass by
The bower where my true love grows,
And my one wish has been that some day I may win
The heart of my wild Irish Rose.

giving all your love to just one man.
You'll have bad times
And he'll have good times, 
Doin' things that you don't understand.
 
But if you love him you'll forgive him,
even though he's hard to understand.
And if you love him Oh be proud of him,
'Cause after all he's just a man.  
 
Stand By Your Man,
Give him two arms to cling to,
And something warm to come to 
when nights are cold and lonely.
 
Stand By Your Man,
And tell the world you love him.
Giving all the love you can.

You're my baby, you're my pet
We fell in love on the night we met
You touched my hand, my heart went pop
Ooh, when we kissed I could not stop

You walked out of my dreams, into my arms
Now you're my angel divine
You're sixteen, you're beautiful and you're mine

You're my baby, you're my pet

I wanted you to comfort me the moment we begun

You sent the spies to find me, now they're kicking down my door

But am I still the one

But when I needed you the most you looked the other way

And you left us behind 
Was the world just too cruel
Were we just to unkind

I hope you are clear

Would you kiss me goodbye

I got no excuses so I wrote this song for you
Whatever the reasons did you come to say goodbye?
I'm hoping for one more try, I wanted to change your mind

So I pick up the pieces, I swallowed all my pride
I don't wanna wake up, feeling this empty inside
Did it spin you around? Did it turn you upside down?
I wonder when you found out I'm a waste of your time

So don't give up on me
I never meant to steal your smile, I haven't seen it for a while
And don't, don't give up on me
Just try to understand that I can be a better man

I tell you once just don't give up on me, yeah
I tell you once just don't give up on me

And now I feel that I'm out of place
I look for you on every stranger's face
I don't think I can do this any more

And every little things just falls apart
From the very first that day I broke your heart
It only makes me want you more and more just like before

'Cause you spin me around and now you turn me upside down
I never meant to be a waste of your time

That you wore in sixty-five

What am I supposed to do?

And I'm gonna fly, fly, fly away
And if our love is strong we'll never go wrong
'Cause that's the place to be

Baby, bye, bye, bye, baby
And if you ever come down we'll still fool around
And watch the sunset to the sea

And as the little black bird sat on the roof
Where did my baby go?
You said sometimes life could thrown you off track
You're weary and you never know

If your daddy asks me where you are
What am I supposed to say?

Daniel Powter,"Well something got me shaking
My mind was racing pacing the room
I don't know but I think I fell to pieces
The moment that I first saw you

Now it's true
I thought I could get over it
Brushed you off my shoulder but now
I'm a mess
Every day is worse and the hurt is always bringing me down
Help me

'Cause I don't know if I can take it
I'm so tired of trying to fake it
Tell me you know
That I've been crazy all my life

I try to be cool but I want more
Now I'm standing right here at your front door
I need to know
That I've been crazy all my life
Crazy all my life

Well tell me you can help me
I'm nothing but a shell of a man
Baby please the only time I'm right
Is when I am by your side understand?

Can't you see?
Baby it's irrational
Maybe I'm a natural freak
All I know is love can make you stupid
And you are just a song on repeat
Help me

'Cause I don't know if I can take it
I'm so tired of trying to fake it
Tell me you know
That I've been crazy all my life

I try to be cool but I want more
Now I'm standing right here at your front door
I need to know
That I've been crazy all my life
Crazy all my life
My life, my life
Whoa

Maybe you're just a fool like me
And you're feeling crazy too
Maybe we're just two fools you see
Maybe we found we've been crazy all our life

Don't know if I can take it
I'm so tired of trying to fake it
I wanna know
That I've been crazy all my life

I try to be cool but I want more
Now I'm standing right here at your back door
I wanna know If I've been crazy all my life

Let us all be grateful for a land so fair, as we
 raise our voices in a solemn prayer.

Daniel Romano,"Well I was born in a small border town
And I left home at a young age and headed on down
And I started walking
Following a white line
I was on the side of a wild rush end freeway
With one pair of clothes and nothing else to my name
When a lorry would pass I would pick myself up with
A new coat of grit and a fresh layer of dust
I was dirty, fully covered
And just when the dirt started stinging my eyes
And I couldn’t decide the ground from the sky
A man pulled over and offered a ride
So I took it, I ran right over
And I got in his truck and sat perfectly still
And he said ‘I just gotta stop off at the mill’
I said ‘You can take me wherever you will’
And I asked him ‘What do they call you?’
And he answered ‘Chicken Bill, they call me Chicken Bill’

Well, on account of the dirt he thought I was a man
And he reached out his mint and he shook my filthy hand
He said ‘Boy, I got me a farm ‘round the bend
And I could sure use the help if you got time to land,
Catching chickens, chopping their head off, locking them up’
All right, run around
So I worked for old Bill and his beautiful wife
Who would cook up a chicken for us every night
And just when I thought everything was alright
He sat me down, he said ‘I’m skipping town,
Going …around’
And I said ‘How could you live such a woman behind?’
Then the look on his face helped me open my eyes
And for the first time I saw Chicken Bill’s other side
He sat down beside me, all nervous and shy
And he told me the real story of Chicken Bill",Chicken Bill,2013

I’ve spent my life on a barstool all alone
Never knowing why she sent me from my home
Was there something wrong with me
That no one else could see?
What’s the reason
Only I got turned away?

Mama, please tell me why
You would leave just me behind
You sent me off and then you went and have my brothers
Before me, a little girl
And they’re the center of your world
Mama, tell me, why’d you leave the middle child?

I should’ve gone back home
And asked her to her face
But my life's become too much of a disgrace
And I got the news today
Saying mama passed away
So I’ll never know the reason I’m alone

Another sunny day
I couldn't wait to start
I combed my hair
Walked down the stairs
To wait for the phone to ring
Just before the momen that I lost everything

You didn't call so I thought I'd go to you
Thought I'd surprise you with some flowers
That I tied all up in blue
I skipped and hopped
For seven blocks
And with every skip I'd sing
Just before the moment that I lost everything

I couldn't wait to see your face when I arived
For your sweet love's the only reason I'm alive
And I swear I sit inside my head
I know I'd rather die
Than to be without that woman in my life

I walked up your stairs
And knocked at your front door
And I heard the creek of footsteps
Walking on the floor
You didn't come to answer it
So I gave the bell a ring
Just before the moment that I lost everything

Still no answer
So I crept up to the window
I looked in and there I saw
A man I didn't know
And by his side
You laid there smiling
As he held you tenderly
And that's the very moment that I lost everything

I step out into town and I go on my way

Daniel Simo,"Quiero decirte en esta canción que te extraño
No puedo vivir si no estás a mi lado
Muero lentamente en mi agonía a diario

Que sin tu amor mi vida no tiene sentido
En un inútil me he convertido
No hay alegría si no estás conmigo

Vago por las calles buscando ternura
Pero solo encuentro dolor y amargura
Si tú no estás no existe dulzura

Vuelve a mí por favor
No ves, llorando estoy
Yo reconozco mi error
Arrepentido estoy
Te grita mi corazón
No me ignores, aquí estoy

Siento que hay en mi alma un enorme vacío
Un profundo abismo, estoy sumergido
Regresa a mí, te necesito

Pasan los días, los años, los meses, las horas
No soporto más esta horrible demora
Si no vienes pronto, moriré a solas

Todo cambió desde el día en que tú partiste
Ahora mis amigos me dicen el triste
Todos me preguntan qué fue lo que me diste

Vuelve a mí por favor
Por ti llorando estoy
Yo reconozco mi error
Arrepentido estoy
Te grita mi corazón
No me ignores, aquí estoy
Vuelve a mí, vuelve

Arrepentido estoy
Te grita mi corazón
No me ignores, aquí estoy",Vuelve a MI,

Du und ich ham' angefangen
Sind Dinge anders angegangen
Die Kohle die war kein Problem
Das leben völlig angenehm
Unser Traum der wurde wahr
Doch dann kam das nächste Jahr
Das war leider schon dein letztes Jahr

Erinner' dich an mich
Erinner' dich an' Park
In dem sich unsere Clique trifft

If I was sober
I'd be with him
The pain too intense to see any sense in living
God please forgive me for all of the outbreaks
But my ? is up at the pearly white gates
I weep and mourn his death
Every single day
Ain't gon' celebrate this life
Until I pass away
We had big plans and shared the same dreams
I blowin up in the game and staring up the main stream
I'm miss building with you
Just being around you
You're in Heaven right now,
At least no evil surround you
I will reminisce over you

Make sure to send our love to fam, friends, big and pop
As long as I'm alive
They gon' remember your name
But without you here bro
Things will never be the same, never

Und die Erinnerung an dich
Entfacht den Schmerz
Bricht mein Herz
Und raubt mir die kraft
Es schlägt mich zu Boden
Ich fühle mich ohne macht
Muss realisieren
Du bist nicht mehr hier
Doch es fällt mir schwer
Das zu kapieren
Wir waren wie Brüder füreinander da
Wir waren wie eine Einheit
Bis zum letzten Tag
Du bist vorgegangen
Doch ich komm nach
Dann werden wir uns wiedersehen
Eines Tages
Eines Tages führen wir die Gespräche fort
Gehen gemeinsam neue Wege an 'nem anderen Ort
Du wirst immer leben
Solang ich lebe
In mir drin Bruder
Glaub mir bis ich gehe
Gehe und dich voller Hoffnung wiedersehe

Where there's love overflowing
I wish I were home, I wish I was back there

Suddenly the snowflakes that fall have a meaning
Sprinkling the sea
Makes it all clean

Maybe there's a way for me to go back
Now that I have some direction
It would sure be nice to back home
Where there's love and affection
And just maybe I can convince time to slow up
Giving me enough time in my life to grow up
Time be my friend
Let me start again

Suddenly my world's gone and changed it's face
But I still know where I'm goin'
I have had my mind spun around in space
And yet I've watched it growin'

Tell us should we run away, should we try and stay?
Or is better just to let things be?

Santa, baby
A '54 convertible too
Light blue
I'll wait up for you, dear
Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you check off my Christmas list

Santa, baby
I want a yacht and really that's not
A lot
I've been an angel all year
Santa Baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa, honey
There's one more thing I really do need
The deed
To a platinum mine
Santa, cutie
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me

Santa, baby
Forgot to mention one little thing
A ring
And I don't mean on the phone

Slowing down the waves of my heart

'Cause I can't stop when you turn, turn a frown

Para poder cambiar 
La pena que se siente 
Cuando un amor se va. 

Pero será una pena 
Si no vuelves amar 
Déjame asegurarte 
Te quiero consolar. 

Aquí esta mi amor 
Puedes confiar en el 
Ya deja de sufrir 
Te enseñare a vivir otra vez. 

DAME UNA OPORTUNIDAD 
Para tomar su lugar 
Veras que volverás a amar 
Como lo hiciste ayer. 

Yo se que ahora piensas 
Que no hay sinceridad, 
Que solo son palabras 
Que no debes escuchar. 

Pero yo te aseguro 
Que se pueden olvidar 
Heridas si se curan 
Pues me ha pasado igual. 

Aquí esta mi amor

Ya deja de sufrir

Daniela de Santos,"Play our love's theme tonight
My love's here, it's no dream tonight
It's been so long
Since we've danced to our love song
I know the melody that made him mine
Will be the melody that keeps him close to me (love's theme)

Play our love's theme once more
Make him feel, like he felt before
While the lights are low
Please, let the music flow
I know that the melody that made him mine
Will be the melody that keeps him close to me (love's theme)

Play our love's theme again
Touch his heart, touch his soul and then
Once we sip the wine
His lips will come to mine
I know that the melody that made him mine
Will be the melody that keeps him close to me

Daniela Lujan,"Ven que yo te quiero platicar
Lo que me pasa a mí y a mi corazón
Desde ayer que lo vi

Es como una nueva sensación
Que llevo dentro de mí
Y creo que se llama amor

Cuéntame como ocurrió
Que yo también te quiero platicar
Que me pasa a mí y a mi corazón
Yo tengo esa misma sensación
Dentro de mi piel

Es amor

Él es alguien muy especial
Cuando lo veo pasar
Siento las piernas temblar

Es el hombre que siempre soñé
Siento peligro en mi piel
Cada que lo vuelvo a ver

Yo no encuentro la solución
Siento perder la razón
Muero por su corazón

Mi miente puede estallar
Si pienso en él un día más
Cómo decir la verdad

Tú eres en quien yo puedo confiar
Dime qué hacer, cómo hacerle ver
Que soy yo quein escribe

Páginas de amor
Que hablan de él
Con mucha ilusión
¿Qué debo hacer?

Tú eres en quein puedo yo confiar
Sabrás guardar
Esta confesión de amor

Los dos sentimos algo igual
El amor no es cuestión de edad
Creo que

Es un chavo muy especial
Me encanta su caminar
Y hasta su forma de hablar

",Es Amor,1999
Daniela Lujan,"Cómo decirle
Lo que yo siento por él
Todo es confuso, qué hacer

Y ahora si yo me equivoco
Cómo podría yo hacer
Porque yo le amo y no sé

Siento sus besos
Y siento yo su suave piel
Abro los ojos, no está

Y es que lo sueño
Lo pienso y no podría asegurar
Que él también piensa igual

Abraza mi alma
Y habla con mi cuerpo
Y dame tu amor en mi interior

Siento que eres ya parte
De mi vida, te doy lo que soy
Porque tú eres yo

Eres mi amor, eres tú mi vida
Y mi pasión, tienes todo
Mi amor y mi corazón
Mira, te entrego mi amor

",Tema de Natalia,1999
Daniela Lujan,"Vengan que les voy a explicar
Como es que deben bailar
Les va a gustar, les puedo yo apostar
Voy a empezar, vengan pa' ca

Este ritmo va a contagiar
A quien lo llegue a escuchar
Y cuiden sus pies, se pueden enredar
Hey, atención, voy a empezar

Las manos arriba a mover a mover
Girar la cadera al derecho y al revés
Abajo de una vez brincando 1, 2, 3
Abajo de una vez brincando 1, 2, 3
Arriba otra vez brincando 1, 2, 3

Si se sienten cansados ya
Van a tener que aguantar
Y además tendrás que repetir

Girar la cadera codienda monie
Abajo de una vez codienda monie

Como el viento, como aves

Porque somos tan libres
Construyendo ilusiones
Que nos lleven tan lejos

Sueña lo que quieras

Mandar cartas de amor

Y no hay contestación de ti

Y si me paro yo, a su lado que le diré

En esa fiesta lo vi y yo empecé
A sentir como es que mi corazón palpitaba
El chavo tan especial me lanza con su mirar
Por fin creo que lo logre y viene hacia mí

Me dijo que guapa estas vamos te invito
A bailar que extraño que yo no te había visto
Bailemos le conteste que guapo estas
Tu también en realidad solo estaba esperándote

En esa fiesta lo vi y yo empecé
A sentir como es que mi corazón palpitar
El chavo tan especial me lanza con tu mirar
Que hice yo para conseguirlo

Son 5 vueltas las que ronde y ni volteo
De pronto me lanzo su mirada y se acerco

Daniela Mercury,"Ah eu vim aqui amor só pra me despedir
E as últimas palavras desse nosso amor, você vai ter que ouvir
Me perdi de tanto amor, ah, eu enlouqueci
Ninguém podia amar assim e eu amei
E devo confessar, aí foi que eu errei
Vou te olhar mais uma vez, na hora de dizer adeus
Vou chorar mais uma vez quando olhar nos olhos seus, nos olhos seus
A saudade vai chegar e por favor meu bem
Me deixe pelo menos só te ver passar
Eu nada vou dizer perdoa se eu chorar",De Tanto Amor,2000
Daniela Mercury,"Sob o sol da liberdade
Liberdade em que se dança
Sob o sol da liberdade
Ainda sou criança

Ao penhor dessa igualdade

Em teu samba retumbante

Gente boa que se preze
Nossa terra tem palmeiras
Onde reina o samba reggae

O samba reggae

Salve, salve o meu País
Salve, salve, Matria (Pátria) minha
E a nossa amada batu, batu, batucada
Idolatrada, batu, batu, batucada

Somos nota soltas notas
A compor a melodia
Vinda das praças, vindas das massas
Vinda de onde não se ouvia

Do mangue Beat de Recife que resiste
Do rap que repete a violência
Do Parintins que o índio existe

Pops como o pecado
Pops como o pecado

Agora olhe pro céu
Veja como ele está lindo
Tá lindo...
Pro céu, pro céu, pro céu, pro céu

Sob o Sol da liberdade
Liberdade em que se dança
Sob o sol da liberdade
Ainda sou criança

O povo reza pra Deus ajudar
O povo canta seus hinos
O povo vai aprender a falar
É flor em teu solo se abrindo

Com a nossa pouca idade
Com a nossa alegria

A brilhar no céu da Pátria

Daniela Mercury,"Juro que não vai doer
Se um dia eu roubar
O seu anel de brilhantes
Afinal de contas dei meu coração
E você pôs na estante

Como um troféu
No meio da buginganga
Você me deixou de tanga
Ai de mim que sou romântica!

Quando eu me sinto um pouco rejeitada
Me dá um nó na garganta
Choro até secar a alma de toda mágoa
Depois eu passo pra outra

Como mutante
No fundo sempre sozinho
Seguindo o meu caminho
Ai de mim que sou romântica!

Kiss me, baby, kiss me

Pena que você não me kiss
Não me suicidei por um triz
Ai de mim que sou assim!
(Romântica)

Quero lhe contar como eu vivi
E tudo o que aconteceu comigo
Viver é melhor que sonhar
Eu sei que o amor
É uma coisa boa
Mas também sei
Que qualquer canto
É menor do que a vida
De qualquer pessoa

Por isso cuidado meu bem
Há perigo na esquina
Eles venceram e o sinal
Está fechado pra nós
Que somos jovens

Para abraçar seu irmão
E beijar sua menina na rua
É que se fez o seu braço
O seu lábio e a sua voz

Você me pergunta
Pela minha paixão
Digo que estou encantada
Como uma nova invenção
Eu vou ficar nesta cidade
Não vou voltar pro sertão
Pois vejo vir vindo no vento
Cheiro de nova estação
Eu sei de tudo na ferida viva
Do meu coração

Já faz tempo
Eu vi você na rua
Cabelo ao vento
Gente jovem reunida
Na parede da memória
Essa lembrança
É o quadro que dói mais

Minha dor é perceber
Que apesar de termos
Feito tudo o que fizemos
Ainda somos os mesmos
E vivemos
Ainda somos os mesmos
E vivemos
Como os nossos pais

Nossos ídolos
Ainda são os mesmos
E as aparências
Não enganam não
Você diz que depois deles
Não apareceu mais ninguém
Você pode até dizer
Que eu tô por fora
Ou então
Que eu tô inventando

Mas é você
Que ama o passado
E que não vê
É você
Que ama o passado
E que não vê
Que o novo sempre vem

Hoje eu sei
Que quem me deu a idéia
De uma nova consciência
E juventude
Tá em casa
Guardado por Deus
Contando vil metal

Minha dor é perceber
Que apesar de termos
Feito tudo, tudo
Tudo o que fizemos
Nós ainda somos
Os mesmos e vivemos
Ainda somos
Os mesmos e vivemos
Ainda somos
Os mesmos e vivemos

Cuando empieza un amor no existen las quimeras
Una presencia llena, por fin llenar tus horas

Cuando empieza un amor un beso te hace fuerte
Y lo que te apasiona, es un detalle simple
Se usa mas lo nuestro, que de si tuyo o mio y todo es compartirlo
Con un alma sincera, corren por tus venas las sensaciones bellas

Daniela Romo,"Tu ausencia es peor que sufrir un castigo
Duele mas que perder un amigo
Es mas triste que verte llorar.

Tu ausencia es llevar una herida en el alma
Es clavarme un puñal por la espalda
Es sentir que perdí la mitad.

Por eso aunque sigan pasando los años
No concibo vivir y olvidando
Que a tu lado yo he sido feliz
Entiendo que no puedo esperar un milagro
No me alcanzas a ver que te extraño

Solo un poco de confianza
Para tratar de darte alivio y calma.

Daniela Romo,"Que sensación extraña
Que soledad tan larga
La luna que me llama
Amor que me reclama, que mágico poder

Estaba yo distante
Pero hoy quiero volver
Volver a enamorarme
A compartir con alguien todo lo que hay en mi

Quiero amanecer con alguien
Que en la lucha por regirme me seduzca
Que separe bien mi cuerpo de mi mente
Que sepa como amarme, que no quiera cambiarme

Quiero amanecer con alguien
Que me intuya solamente con mirarle
Que me busque al sentirse vulnerable
Que sepa como amarme, que no quiera cambiarme

Y mi razón se calla, mi corazón le llama
No quiere mas ausencias, y busca una presencia
Que lo haga aun latir

Que importa lo que pase
Que importa lo que fui
Porque la vida es una
Y aun contra corriente yo quiero proseguir

Quiero amanecer con alguien
Cuya fuerza me defienda de mis dudas
Que no rompa mis silencios con preguntas
Que sepa como amarme, que no quiera cambiarme

Que en las noches se confunda con mi sombra
Que comprenda que explicarse esta de sobra
Que sepa como amarme, que no quiera cambiarme",Quiero Amanecer con Alguien,1993

Y no me puedo desatar pierdo identidad
Esperar tu ternura fue mi osadía.

Me tengo que enfrentar a vivir sola
Y tengo que aprender a estar en mi
Aun sabiendo que me destruía
Me encuentro presa de mi libertad.

Y ahora no seas inmadura
Me repito a diario
Aceptarme y curarme
Es mi aventura
Y ahora la confianza en mi es la vía segura
Es un soplo de viento
Esta aventura.

Hoy un ave fénix debo ser
Batir mis alas fuerte
Con todas mis ganas renacer.

Aprenderé a querer
Lo que soy lo que seré
Vivir es una hazaña
Amarse a si mismo
Que proeza que gran aventura.",Ave Fénix,2001
Daniela Romo,"El ayer tan solo es
Un testamento anticuado
Mira bien y has de saber
Siempre nos sigue el pasado al fin

Solo Internet
Ni una mano alcanzar
Ni una mano sentir
Aquel ayer
De mirarse y vivir

Incertidumbre es el mañana que vendrá  
No lo adivines  
Y vive el hoy  
En tu presente  
Se construye el que sera  
Hazlo distinto y lucha  
Por hoy  
Con amor y compasión  
Con pasión y con amor  

Sin temor abrazate  
A las pasiones humanas  
Es mejor a ser virtual  
Globalizada y extraña al fin  
Hay que vagar encontrar y buscar
Enfrentar y llorar  
Ver mas allá  
Muy adentro de ti  

Incertidumbre es el mañana que vendrá

Porque el destino  
Siempre nos alcanzara  
Dale sentido  
Al sentido vital  
Abre tus alas  
No te dejes contagiar  
Es implacable  
El correr del reloj  
Con amor y compasión  
Con pasión y con amor",El  Ayer,2001
