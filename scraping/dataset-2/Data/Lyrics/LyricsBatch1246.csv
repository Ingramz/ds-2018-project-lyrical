Vasco Rossi,"Quando sei lì da sola con te 
Sei davvero lì 
quando dici ti amo davvero 
Sei ancora qui 
Quando sei lì da sola con te 
Vuoi fuggire e non sai perché 
Dove vai quando sembri da sola 
Senza di me 

Lo sai cos'è 
Io non posso stare senza te 
È che quando sei lì sola 
Ho paura e 
son nervoso più che mai 
Non ci crederai 

Quando sei lì da sola con te 
Cosa fai di me! 
quando dici ti amo davvero 
Sei ancora TE! 

Lo sai cos'è 
Io non posso stare senza te! 
È che quando sei lì sola 
Ho paura e 
son nervoso più che mai 
Non ci crederai 

Lo so che tu 
Quando parli sei davvero tu 
È che quando sei lì sola 
Ho paura e 
non mi sembri più sincera 
non mi sembri te 

Sei ancora (in) TE! 
Sei ancora",Da Sola Con Te,2005
Vasco Rossi,"Respiri piano per non far rumore
Ti addormenti di sera
Ti risvegli con il sole
Sei chiara come un'alba
Sei fresca come l'aria
Diventi rossa se qualcuno ti guarda
E sei fantastica quando sei assorta
Nei tuoi problemi
Nei tuoi pensieri
Ti vesti svogliatamente
Non metti mai niente
Che possa attirare attenzione
Un particolare
Solo per farti guardare

Respiri piano per non far rumore
Ti addormenti di sera
Ti risvegli con il sole
Sei chiara come un'alba
Sei fresca come l'aria
Diventi rossa se qualcuno ti guarda
E sei fantastica quando sei assorta
Nei tuoi problemi
Nei tuoi pensieri
Ti vesti svogliatamente
Non metti mai niente
Che possa attirare attenzione
Un particolare
Solo per farti guardare

E con la faccia pulita
Cammini per strada mangiando una
Mela coi libri di scuola
Ti piace studiare
Non te ne devi vergognare

E quando guardi con quegli occhi grandi
Forse un po' troppo sinceri, sinceri
Si vede quello che pensi
Quello che sogni

Qualche volta fai pensieri strani
Con una mano, una mano, ti sfiori
Tu sola dentro la stanza
E tutto il mondo fuori",Albachiara,2005
Vasco Rossi,"E centomila occhi si voltarono 
A guardare il cielo 
Con un sospiro leggero, 
Da quella parte sì, e da quella parte che 
Sarebbero venuti, loro 
L'aveva detto il vecchio pazzo 
Che abitava il monte 
Nessuno aveva dubitato 
Delle sue parole 
Avevano bisogno di loro 
Sarebbero venuti in volo. 
E centomila cuori cominciarono 
A sondare il cielo 
Con un sospiro leggero 
Da quella parte sì, e da quella parte 
Che, sarebbero venuti loro 
Non c'era che aspettare fino all'alba 
Con pazienza e rassegnazione 
Avrebbero risolto tutto quanto loro 
Senza fare il minimo rumore 
Avevano bisogno di loro 
Sarebbero venuti in volo. 

E centomila mani cominciarono 
Ad alzarsi verso il cielo 
Si stava già facendo giorno 
E non era arrivato nessuno. 
Non si poteva, più, aspettare invano 
Qualcuno già diceva 
Che non esistevano nemmeno
Fare da loro, 
Fu allora che preseroil volo",Sballi Ravvicinati del 3° Tipo,2005
Vasco Rossi,"Ma che cosa c'è 
Brutta storia 
Certo che a correre sempre, dici tu 
Quando mai ti fermi più 
Ma che storia è
Sei in forma uè
Certo che sei un bel fenomeno anche tu 
A farti prendere così

Sai che cosa c'è 
Non importa se
Ciò che conta costa sempre un po' di più 
O pago io, o paghi tu!

Ma che cosa

Vasco Rossi,"Amico fragile è nata così quando ero ancora con la mia prima moglie, 
Fui invitato una sera a Portobello di Gallura, 
Dove m’ero fatto una casa nel ‘69, 
In uno di questi ghetti della costa nord 
Sarda d’estate arrivavano tutti, romani, milanesi
In questo parco residenziale, e m’invitavano la sera 
Che per me finiva sempre col chiudersi puntualmente con la chitarra in mano. 
Una sera ho tentato di dire Perché piuttosto non parliamo di 

Era il periodo, ricordo, che Paolo VI se n’era venuto fuori con la faccenda  
Ripresa poi mi pare da quest’altro qui, della stessa pasta – 
Degli esorcismi. Insomma dico Parliamo un po’ di quello 
Che sta succedendo in Italia nemmeno per sogno, io dovevo suonare. 
Allora mi sono proprio rotto I coglioni, 
Mi sono ubriacato sconciamente, ho insultato tutti, 
Me ne sono tornato a casa e ho scritto Amico fragile. 
L’ho scritta da sbronzo, in un’unica notte. 
Ricordo che erano circa le otto del mattino, 
Mia moglie mi cercava, non mi trovava né a letto né da nessun’altra 
Parte c’era infatti una specie di buco a casa nostra, 
Che era poi una dispensa priva anche di mobili, 
Dove m’ero rifugiato e mi hanno trovato lì che stavo finendo proprio questa canzone.

Evaporato in una nuvola rossa
In una delle molte feritoie della notte
Con un bisogno d’attenzione e d’amore
Troppo, Se mi vuoi bene piangi 
Per essere corrisposti,
Valeva la pena divertirvi le serate estive
Con un semplicissimo Mi ricordo
Per osservarvi affittare un chilo d’era
Ai contadini in pensione e alle loro donne
E regalare a piene mani oceani
Ed altre ed altre onde ai marinai in servizio,
Fino a scoprire ad uno ad uno I vostri nascondigli
Senza rimpiangere la mia credulità
Perché già dalla prima trincea
Ero più curioso di voi,
Ero molto più curioso di voi.

E poi sorpreso dai vostri Come sta
Meravigliato da luoghi meno comuni e più feroci,
Tipo Come ti senti amico, amico fragile,
Se vuoi potrò occuparmi un’ora al mese di te
Lo sa che io ho perduto due figli
Signora lei è una donna piuttosto distratta.
E ancora ucciso dalla vostra cortesia
Nell’ora in cui un mio sogno
Ballerina di seconda fila,
Agitava per chissà quale avvenire
Il suo presente di seni enormi
E il suo cesareo fresco,
Pensavo è bello che dove finiscono le mie dita
Debba in qualche modo incominciare una chitarra.

E poi seduto in mezzo ai vostri arrivederci,
Mi sentivo meno stanco di voi
Ero molto meno stanco di voi.

Potevo stuzzicare I pantaloni della sconosciuta
Fino a farle spalancarsi la bocca.
Potevo chiedere ad uno qualunque dei miei figli
Di parlare ancora male e ad alta voce di me.
Potevo barattare la mia chitarra e il suo elmo
Con una scatola di legno che dicesse perderemo.
Potevo chiedere come si chiama il vostro cane
Il mio è un po’ di tempo che si chiama Libero.
Potevo assumere un cannibale al giorno
Per farmi insegnare la mia distanza dalle stelle.
Potevo attraversare litri e litri di corallo
Per raggiungere un posto che si chiamasse arrivederci.

E mai che mi sia venuto in mente,
Di essere più ubriaco di voi
Di essere molto più ubriaco di voi.",Amico Fragile,2005
Vasco Rossi,"Stai con me ancora un po'
solo un momento ti paghero'
soltanto un attimo di nostalgia
oppure per un attimo e poi vai via
E tu parli, parli

e poi Sogni sogni
sogni che poi svaniscono
Stai con me ci stai o no?
ci stai un attimo un giorno
ci stai per essere ancora mia
oppure ci stai per non andare via

Che qualcosa finisce o comincia cosi'

Stamattina è già il terzo 
Caffè che bevo
Ho fatto pure una doccia gelata
Ma non è servito
Sono ancora in coma
Poi il telefono squilla
La nevrosi mi piglia
Di rispondere adesso 

Proprio non ne ho voglia
Poi alla fine prendo su
Sei tu!?
Che cosa dici ""non mi vuoi vedere più""
Ebbe' fai bene sei bella
E puoi trattare gli uomini
Come fazzoletti di carta
In fondo devi stare solo attenta
Che non siano mai
Della stessa marca

Vasco Rossi,"La nostra relazione
È qualche cosa di diverso
Non è per niente amore
E non è forse neanche sesso
Ci limitiamo a vivere
Dentro nello stesso letto
Un po' per abitudine
O forse un po' anche per dispetto.
Non è un segreto dai lo sanno tutti
E tu sei buffa quando cerchi
Di nasconderlo alla gente
Che ci vede litigare
Per qualsiasi cosa o niente
Per la noia che da sempre
Ci portiamo dentro

Si deciderà tutto qui
Chi può aspettare aspetterà
Non scappiamo fuori di qui

Vasco Rossi,"Comunque non è questo il modo di fare
Disse il commerciante all'uomo del pane 
Domani sarà festa in questo stupido paese
Non per noi che stiamo a lavorare

L'uomo del pane fece finta di niente 
Se ne andò tranquillamente, 'ente, 'ente
Aveva, tante, tante, tante cose da fare
Poi lui non ci poteva fare niente, niente 

La primavera insiste la mattina 
Dalla mia cucina vedo il mondo tondo
Sempre diverso, sempre ogni mattina
Sin dal giorno prima, dal giorno prima 
Con in bocca un gusto amaro che fa schifo
Chissà cosa è stato, quello che ho bevuto 
M'alzo dal letto e penso al povero
Al mio fegato, fegato spappolato
Fegato, fegato, fegato spappolato 

Dice mia madre devi andare dal dottore 
A farti guardare, a farti visitare 
Hai una faccia che fa schifo, guarda come sei ridotto
Mi sa tanto che finisci male 
La guardo negli occhi, con un sorriso strano 
Eppure la vedo, forse ha ragione davvero 

Ma fuori c'è la festa del paese 
Vado a fare un giro
Non l'ho neanche detto
Che già mia madre che mi corre dietro con il vestito nuovo
La fuga è veloce mi metto le scarpe che sono già in strada
Che bella giornata, non bado alla gente che guarda sconvolta
Ormai ci sono abituato, sono vaccinato
Sono controllato
Si pensa ormai addirittura in giro
È chiaro che sono drogato

La festa ha sempre il solito sapore
Il gusto di campane, non è neanche male 
C'è chi va a messa e c'è chi pensa di fumare 
Come aperitivo prima di mangiare
Fini s'è alzato da poco, e non è ancora sveglio
Non è ancora sveglio, ed è talmente scazzato
Che non riesce a parlare nemmeno

La sera che arriva non è mai diversa dalla sera prima
La gente che affoga nell'unica sala, la discoteca
Ci vuol qualcosa per tenersi a galla sopra questa merda 
Sopra questa merda 
E non m'importa se domani 
Mi dovrò svegliare con quel gusto in bocca, gusto in bocca
Gusto in bocca
Gusto in bocca
Yeah

Vasco Rossi,"Sally cammina per la strada senza nemmeno 
Guardare per terra 
Sally è una donna che non ha più voglia 
Di fare la guerra 
Sally ha patito troppo 
Sally ha già visto che cosa 
Ti può crollare addosso 
Sally è già stata punita 
Per ogni sua distrazione o debolezza 
Per ogni candida carezza 
Data per non sentire l'amarezza 

Senti che fuori piove 
Senti che bel rumore 

Sally cammina per la strada sicura 
Senza pensare a niente 
Ormai guarda la gente 
Con aria indifferente 
Sono lontani quei momenti 
Quando uno sguardo provocava turbamenti 
Quando la vita era più facile 
E si potevano mangiare anche le fragole 
Perché la vita è un brivido che vola via 
È tutto un equilibrio sopra la follia 
Sopra follia 

Senti che fuori piove 
Senti che bel rumore 

Ma forse Sally è proprio questo il senso, il senso, il senso
Del tuo vagare 
Forse davvero ci si deve sentire 
Alla fine un po' male 
Forse alla fine di questa triste storia 
Qualcuno troverà il coraggio 
Per affrontare i sensi di colpa 
E cancellarli da questo viaggio 
Per vivere davvero ogni momento 
Con ogni suo turbamento 
E come se fosse l'ultimo 

Sally cammina per la strada leggera 
Ormai è sera 
Si accendono le luci dei lampioni 
Tutta la gente corre a casa davanti alle televisioni 
Ed un pensiero le passa per la testa 
Forse la vita non è stata tutta persa 
Forse qualcosa s'è salvato 
Forse davvero non è stato poi tutto sbagliato 
Forse era giusto così  
Forse ma, forse ma sì

Che penso a quando tu eri qui
Era difficile ricordo bene
Ma era fantastico provarci insieme

Ed ora che non mi consolo
Davanti una fotografia
Mi rendo conto che il tempo vola
E che la vita poi è una sola

E mi ricordo chi voleva
Al potere la fantasia
Erano giorni di grandi sogni sai
Erano vere anche le utopie

Ma non ricordo se chi c'era
Aveva queste queste facce qui
Non mi dire che è proprio così
Non mi dire che son quelli lì

Ed ora che del mio domani
Non ho più la nostalgia
Ci vuole sempre qualche cosa da bere
Ci vuole sempre vicino un bicchiere!

Ed ora che oramai non tremo
Nemmeno per amore sì
Ci vuole quello che io non ho
Ci vuole pelo sullo stomaco

Però ricordo chi voleva
Un mondo meglio di così
Sì proprio tu che ti fai delle storie ma dai
Cosa vuoi tu più di così

E cosa conta chi perdeva

È la vita ed è ora che cresci
Devi prenderla così

Sarà diverso e poi chi lo sa?

Posso fare anche senza di te

Vasco Rossi,"Un fantastico blues viene giù
Da una chitarra sola
È una musica che perlopiù
Fa sempre la sua figura

Non è più la stessa cosa

Un fantastico blues viene giù
Da una chitarra sola
È la vita che non viene più

Hai fatto tutto in fretta

I had no clue, didn't know what to do
But I remembered: His record is good.
I remembered His record is good.

I've read about the time when He fed the multitude
With two fish and five loaves; how amazing it was!
But I have to admit sometimes my faith gets weak
Even though I can't see, He's still there.
So when I have no clue and don't know what to do
I remember His record is good; 
I remember His record is good.

He spoke to the wind, and the storm ceased.
Healed the blind and made him see, see...
And just like you and me,
We have our own testimony
Of the goodness, the goodness of God.
When You have no clue and don't know what to do
Just remember His record is good;
Just remember His record is good.

He can do it. 
He can do it. 
His record is good.

Still a healer; still a deliverer.
He can do it; His record is good.

Still a healer; still a deliverer.
He can do it; His record is good.

He's a provider; my regulator.
He can do it; His record is good.

His record is good! 
His record is good!
His record is good!

Cast down, but not destroyed

Sun rise again in time

Why do the clouds keep crying
Why do you sleep curled up like a child

Still remember their nursery rhymes

As they write a word just by staying still
When you talk they move, painting what you say
So I understand more than words can tell

In the light it moves, red and green are brown

And a lifetime grows as the day comes down

Not wearin' a rubber got me stuck now with three kids

'Cause she might be leavin' anyday

That's why I'm missin' prayer daily
Tryin' to get these stacks
Why that
The situation that I'm in
The judge tryin' to send me to the pen
And give me ten
And do me in

And my grandma and my baby's sick

Pas besoin d'une date pour parler de paix ça m'a mis les nerfs.

Mais pourquoi ?
Où est-ce qu'on va ?

Vassar Clements,"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone

Well, you should go somewhere and hide your face

Was it just your little game?
Now look back on all the harm you've done
And then you can hang your head in shame

Shit, who broke the street to your radio?
Now you coming out of your mouth
But I'm on the white faces as soon as they pout
And walk on water just as soon as they doubt nigga
I'm hear to change the level boom
If you didn't sell records you ain't packin' the room
So this means you should rhyme first
Till you pay your dues rap hurts
Give me two takes and I'm gone with the wind
I know piranha rap niggaz that'll eat you thin
And all I gotta say is when because
You gets no love from me
You could throw me out the window and I'll land on my feat
If he's steppin' with me then we keep it discreet
You gets no love from me
You could throw me out the window and I'll land on my feat

I got the style that amazes
Too many phrases
You think I'm weeded up I'm on lasers

And I'll land on my feet

You think I'm weeded up I'm on lasers

Vast Aire,"This is not a love song. Naa.

I had a crush on Tawanda she went to IS230
Figure eight she was so curvy
Had an arch in her back with mad jewelery
Every Neanderthal wanted that cutie
Good complexion not too thin
She got the baddest trim
I ain't talking about her hair cut
She worked at my man's job
She made 11th grader's wanna cradle rob
She got the sweet potato, I got the corn on the cob
Tuck your shirt in she don't take no slobs
If you saw her smile, she had a bad attitude and a wicked profile
Gorgeous face and a nice style, it make you say ""Damn you can have my child""
Got me thinking all this is worth my while
With my head in the clouds screaming loud

[Chorus x2] 
I got a love Jones, for your body and your skin tone
Five minutes alone I'm already on the bone
Plus I love the fact you got a mind of your own
So you can sit by the throne

She looked good in the winter, better in the summer
I met her at the bus stop, she gave me her number
Sometimes we would go out and then slumber
She me yours, I'll show you mine (She lift up her sweater)
Back then no girl could do better
I really dug Karen, or was it Annetta
Or was it Vanessa, Stacey or Tracie
I didn't like Jessica, she was too spacey
Mia's got attitude, Janice got her tittie out
Missy's gay, Via's got her ass out
But Melissa's on the bed drinking wine
Don't hate on me Pa, I got pimp designs

[Chorus]


Pink cookies in a plastic bag getting crushed by the empire states
Come on baby why wait
Let's make whoopee today
I'm a Frankenstein valentine (how's that)
'Cause I can separate my heart from my mind
You were to emotional and then about three seconds I'm about to go postal
In other words, crazy nigga with a gun
I got a crush on you but you ain't the one
She was using sex as a weapon
Her aim was precise it kept me guessing
It kept me stepping
I was on my toes until I learnt my lesson
My man tried to tell me I was slippin' (slippin' man)
I ain't even no I was trippin'
But this is not a love song
Well, maybe it is
Maybe I'm frontin'
Why don't you pull my card
If the deuce is wild, I'll let down my guard

[Chorus]",The Crush,2008
Vast Aire,"Ladies

Mary, you make me wanna eat you
Every time I see you, it's like the first time I meet you
Fragrance like a flower, subtle and sweet too
Seductive and whatever, it might as well be see through

Like my genie in a bottle
Miss could get me rich like a magaziney model
Before you know it, he have her on a stroll
Fresh and ripe, perplexin' like Acapulco Gold

If I had to guess, just right, not a day old
Like a cradle robber, copped her off, shop a trailer load
Know the right number, you can get her
And hit while you would've sold to the highest bidder like

Fruits and berries, bring daddy loot in a hurry
Just be cute and don't worry
Type to make a nigga hallucinate and admit it
Then she started losing weight, lettin' everybody hit it

I like Ally, sometimes she gets bitter
Always kept me happy, never had a problem with her
She used to let me use her, back when I was looser
Respect her to this day, and never did abuse her

I told her I'll be faithful, but she don't believe me
I probably coulda been, if I never meet Eevee
She make me feel all fuzzy inside, it's loco
You won't get nowheres near her if you're broke though

Kept a shorty, can't find 'em much thinner
If caught I get mad time just for touchin' her
Knock wood, so much for hymens
So fly, she should be in the sky with diamonds

Little young thing, she likes to do the tongue thing
At times, she would play hard to get, grunting
Or something, she made me feel like the number one king
Run into her now, and we still catch a fun fling

Met her at Central Park this one time
Had the God mentally sparked, reflectin' sunshine
She said, you need to stop messin' wit that white girl
She fuckin' wit ya head and got ya heart in tight curl

We messed around once or twice, but she don't know me
She helped me get money at the Dutch price OT
Plus she from Columbia, so she really Spanish
Cookie known to make a cat bank account vanish

And Miss Hazy, all the women mature black
Every time she sees me, I end up gettin' pulled back
All she want me to do is blaze it crazy
The only one complaint is, she make me too lazy

Sugar mommy laced me with the butter Navy Avi
Just her way to makeup for the headaches that she gave me
It's all gravy, when I'm done getting my mack on
Ally is always there to help me get back on

Vat 19 Fontclaire Steel Orchestra,"I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now
Never can say goodbye

Even though the pain and heartache
Seem to follow me wherever I go
Though I try and try to hide my feelings
They always seem to show,

Then you try to say you're leaving me
And I always have to say no
Tell me why is it so

That I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now
Never can say goodbye

Every time I think I've had enough
And start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
Piercing me right through the core
It says, turn around, you fool
You know you love him more and more
Tell me why is it so

Don't wanna let you go
I never can say goodbye girl
Ooh ooh baby (don't wanna let you go girl)
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no
Ooh, oh I never can say goodbye girl
Ooh ooh ooh (don't wanna let you go girl)
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no, ooh

Never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now
Never can say goodbye

I keep thinking that our problems
Soon are all gonna work out
But there's that same unhappy feeling
There's that anguish, there's that doubt
It's the same old dizzy hangup
Can't do with you or without
Tell me why is it so
Don't wanna let you go

I never can say goodbye girl
Ooh ooh baby (hey baby)
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no
Ooh, oh I never can say goodbye girl

Hiding in her quiet tomb she sleeps there every night
And she cries while she dies silently inside

Slamming doors and calm frustration
Is just her way of life
Rage with love and confrontation
Is hard to deny but she tries

And she holds on anyway
She lights the candles one by one
Praying for the morning to come

Take away the crown of thorns she wears
Take away the hands that left her scarred
Help her find someone who really cares

And find a secret haven for her heart
'Cause all she needs is love for real
From hands that heal, hands that heal

She packs up all her courage
And she leaves her only home
Headed straight for the promise land
Where her life's not set in stone

And she smiles even though
She's miles and miles to go
She counts the headlights one by one
Adding up her blessings as they come

Vaughn Anthony,"Her face glow like I was exposed to sunlight
She's happy, her hair, toes and nails is dumb right
The smell of her fragrance, baffled my nostrils
I can see through her eyes, she's feeding on in the possible
She blushes, as I kept splashing her compliments
Polite thank yous, is all around, she crush the mints
Developments, smooth keys from the piano
Changed the mood, like we changed the channel
This is art, Picasso, I got him beat in the flesh
I'm staring at beauty, Nefertiti, heaven bone in the chest
Yes, everywhere she step, went off like a flare gun
Stilettos on, parquet floors
Miss thing, she's a fierce one, two and three
Bad little mama, she built like Alicia Keys
No facade, her strut is hard, based on books by
Intelligent jail crooks, writing to let the time fly
She dropped the bracelet, I kneeled down
Prestigious gentleman, with my right hand, I picked it up
I stood up, to the cutest eyelashes, as I gave her, her jewels back
Miss thing started rubbing her gut
Excuse me, are you pregnant? Not to be rude
But if it means anything, I can get you some food
Cheese crackers, in the back there's sauteed shrimp
(Nah, I never free lumps, I'll be as big as a blimp
See my due date is January, my first, and it's kinda scary
It's only June, and Christmas, I'll be getting married
And I'm happy, excuse me, what's your name?)
Tone Starks (Peace, I'm Gabby, well I gotta go, my husband is waiting)
But before I go, can I give you one last statement
You the most beautifullest queen, I ever seen
And I would love to have a thing like you, on my team, you take care

Peak Billboard position # 1 in 1949
Monroe may not have sung it precisely this way  but a recording by him was not 
available so the words and music herein are taken from the sheet music as written 
by Stan Jones 
Monroes' version, as well as competing versions by Peggy Lee (# 2), Bing Crosby 
(#14), and Burl Ives (# 21) were all charted as just ""Riders In the Sky""
Later, The Ramrods took it to # 30 in 1961 with the parenthetical (Ghost) added, 
as did the Baja Marimba Band (#52 in 1966) and The Outlaws (#31 in 1981)
Lawrence Welk used the original title on his # 87 in 1961.


An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
A'plowin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw

Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o 
Ghost riders in the sky

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breaths he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders comin' hard and he heard their mournful cry

Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o 
Ghost riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, and shirts all soaked with sweat
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
They've got to ride forever in that range up in the sky
On horses snortin' fire, as they ride on, hear their cry

Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o 
Ghost riders in the sky

As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name
""If you want to save your soul from hell a' ridin' on our range""
""Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride""
""A-tryin' to catch the Devil's herd across these endless skies.""

Who had ten thousand camels and maybe more 
He had rubies and pearls, and the loveliest girls 
But he didn't know how to do the rumba. 
He could afford..... a big reward 
So to his people one day he said: 
Ah ha hahahahahahahahahahah 
Which means... 
Take my rubies and take my pearls 
Take my camels and take my girls 
Rumba lessons are wanted for 
The rich Maharajah of Magador. 
Ah hahahahahahahahah 
So a slick little chick answered, ""That's for me"" 
To the ad he had placed in Variety 
When she saw his expanse, she could tell at a glance 
That he'd never learn how to do the rumba. 
He had his wealth, he had his health 
So he looked in her eyes and said: 
Ah hahahahahahahahahha 
Take my rubies and take my pearls 
Take my camels, I'll keep my girls 
From now on you'll be working for 
The rich Maharajah of Magador. 
Ah hahahahahahahaha 
He was anxious to learn, so she taught him right 
But she taught him the thrill of a moonlight night. 
He discovered the bliss of a half promised kiss 
But he never learned how to do the rumba. 
And on the day...she went away 
You could hear all the people say: 
She took his rubies and took his pearls 
Took his camels and all his girls 
Took his money and what is more 
She made the rich Maharajah the poor Maharajah of Magador.

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

But a false hearted lover will lead you to the grave
And the grave will decay you and turn you to dust

They'll hug you and kiss you and tell you more lies
Than cross lines on a railroad or stars in the skies

For the leaves they will wither and the roots they will die

You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams.
And life gets more exciting with each passing day.
And love is either in your heart, or on it's way.

To be young at heart.
For as rich as you are, it's much better by far
To be young at heart.

Look at all you'll derive out of being alive!
And here is the best part, you have a head start
If you are among the very young at heart.

Running here and there all around the square saying, catch me if you can

Vaughn Monroe 

Peak Billboard position # 1 in 1949
Monroe may not have sung it precisely this way  but a recording by him was not 
available so the words and music herein are taken from the sheet music as written 
by Stan Jones 
Monroes' version, as well as competing versions by Peggy Lee (# 2), Bing Crosby 
(#14), and Burl Ives (# 21) were all charted as just ""Riders In the Sky""
Later, The Ramrods took it to # 30 in 1961 with the parenthetical (Ghost) added, 
as did the Baja Marimba Band (#52 in 1966) and The Outlaws (#31 in 1981)
Lawrence Welk used the original title on his # 87 in 1961.


An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
A'plowin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw

Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o 
Ghost riders in the sky

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breaths he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders comin' hard and he heard their mournful cry

Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o 
Ghost riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, and shirts all soaked with sweat
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
They've got to ride forever in that range up in the sky
On horses snortin' fire, as they ride on, hear their cry

Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o 
Ghost riders in the sky

As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name
""If you want to save your soul from hell a' ridin' on our range""
""Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride""
""A-tryin' to catch the Devil's herd across these endless skies.""

I gave up long before, I lost it all the other day

Never better than this? (we come crashing down)
For as long as you live (we come crashing)

Maybe I pushed too far

Tell me why,
Tell me how,

Could my fears catch the breeze
And drag me to sea?
Could my house catch fire?

If my feet burn off, should I still walk the walk?
Or will the world die laughing?
What's the worst that could happen.

Vaux,"A simple man
Just move from new york city
A simple life
Never made it
With iron sides
A black hat
And a mood that matches
A simple man
On the level
He placed a bet and lost it
Not one to pay so he cocked it
But missed the mark, his girl got hit
Didn't live through the night, that's when he lost it
That's when he lost it.
Keep moving, keep moving on [x6]
There's hell to pay
Why not buy off the devil
No turning back
Keep moving on
On the day that the bank got held up
Two men, two guns and no luck
Never wrong when you're in the right
Bet black, see white
Keep moving, keep moving on [x6]
No turning back
No holding on
Nothing to see
Keep moving on
Keep moving on
An empty heart's
An empty box
Far from me
But not my thoughts
Keep moving, keep moving on [x6]

No holding on
Nothing to see
Keep moving on
Keep moving on

For a hard-pressed man who's caving in. [x2]

And regret what you did years ago
Waiting at the door for an hour
Look at you now
Turn your back on the weight of the world
Stay outside to keep from getting hurt
Always said it was for the best
But look at you now
Turn you back, turn your back once more
No one cares for a sharp dressed man
For a hard-pressed man who's caving in.

Vaux,"I've been led to believe
Been led to believe
We all can change
I have come to see
Have come to see
Everyone is tangled
Attached by strings that never stop
I ran myself into a knot
It's beautiful, it's beautiful, you know
Hung by a thread within the crowd
I want to know you but I don't know how
I am caught, I am tangled
God I'm tired of waking up, of waking up alone.
I've been led to believe
Been led to believe
We need our space
I have come to see
Have come to see
Everyone connected
How long can this keep up
Lost friends who never meant much
It's beautiful, it's beautiful, I know
God I'm tired of waking up, of waking up alone.
Lost the thread that leads me home.
I should have known we're tangled
Everyone is held together.

Splashing bourbon and rye
Playing randy and dandy, the game stakes are high

Baby, soothe me like an orphan child

This word's on fire, the crooks and the liars
Are bribing our souls and robbing our lives
They come to haunt us in dreams where they taunt us
And they don't tell us everything has it's price

Baby, stay with me tonight
Baby, say it will be all right

Fairy tales tell you a good man will find you
And love will be the key to paradise
Girls they believe it, they want to feel needed
They're so afraid to lead a lonely life

Locked in the shadows of doubt
Secrets are afraid of the light
Forever searching for the spirit
We keep hidden inside

Oh baby
I'll stay with you baby
Don't worry, it's going to be alright
You can count on me
I'll not keep any secrets for you
I'm gonna be right here for you

Baby, stay with me tonight
Baby, take me in your arms tonight

This world's on fire, we're caught in a mire
And we don't know what to believe anymore
Men built their towers of hatred and power
And we don't know what all the suffering is for

Locked in the shadows of doubt
Secrets are afraid of the light
Forever searching for the spirit
Hidden deep in our hearts

That I'm drawn back to you
As the miles remember me as I go
It's in the sadness of a nights dream, that I recall
The words of devotion we spoke.

And I can't remember 
Where our bodies froze
I can't remember, all alone
How our love got lost out in the cold

CHORUS: But you're the only song I hear
In this great wandering mess of my ears
You're the only one I know 
Who brings me back to the middle (x2)

Separated all I thought I knew
In a pile of books collapsed upon my floor
I memorized the words in code and true (?)
But I could carry them with me no more

And I can't remember 
Where our bodies froze
I can't remember, all alone
How our love got lost out in the cold

CHORUS

Don't tell me you've been swept away
I can't believe it about you
I won't believe it about you
No, don't tell me you've been swept away
I can't believe it about you 
I won't believe it about you

And you draw my near
When the sky opens and we appear
You'll bring me once again back to the middle.

Tell me I should give up

It's not the way you move
It's your words
Though they soothe,
They're not telling the truth

Didn't I try to
Carry on while just believing in you?
Didn't I give up, everything?
Tell me now,
If there a reason for anything?

You stepped through the door
It is tearing me up
Giving in, giving up
Left here always hoping
One day there'd be more

Tell me when is enough

I'm not blind
And I'm not fooled
Well you know it's true

Didn't I know you?

You couldn't stay

Reaching in
And will I be here till the day?

If I hold my breath you'll walk in any second
And tell me it was all a mistake, can't believe that you left and
It haunts me to hold you this close
But hurts me more to let go
That's why I'm still loving ghosts
They say I should get on with my life
But I can't even get up
I'd rather believe in this beautiful lie
Than admit you're really gone forever

Every sense is screaming
Every hair stands on my skin
Every room I feel it. You are here!
Baby I'm not seeing, but I'm still believing 
My heartbreak a chance worth taking
So on this floor I'll still be waiting

All the born into
That?s what he said
And all that I have to hold on to

You have opened up a part of me
Taken the shadows and replaced them with your face
And you
Have opened up a part of me
Saying please don?t leave me here
When I?m a world?s apart from you

Independence is the part that drew you in
You said I like the way you know a thing or two
But I must confess
The air I breathe has a chill
Making you less aware of what I have to do
I tell you now I can?t reveal the strength I need
Climb all the mountains wishing you were here to see

But you have opened up a part of me
Taken the shadows and replaced them with your face
You have opened up a part of me
Saying please don?t leave me here
When I?m a world apart from you

With a true and faithful heart
I found it
Apart from all the others
I can stand alone because I know that

You have opened up a part of me
Taken the shadows and replaced them with your face
You have opened up a part of me
Saying please don?t leave me here

And you, you
Saying please don?t leave me here
And you, you

Veenai E. Gaayathri,"Nation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see
Then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said, later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last

The world keeps changing, rearranging minds and thoughts
Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out
I told my brother, don't you ask me for no favors
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout
She pray to God to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?
I just want you to recognize me, I'm the temple
You can't hurt me, I found peace within myself

Traue wenig, sogar unter meinen Leuten

Sollst nicht gehn denn im ernst man ich warte sehr 
Und lieg ich nachts allein im Bett kann ich dich atmen h??rn 
Sollst nicht gehn denn ich lieb wie du wach wirst 
Wie du aussiehst, wie du lachst bis die nacht wieder anbricht 
Und du brauchst gar nicht stark zu sein baby, denn ich lieb wie du schwach bist 
Sollst nicht gehn und so offen f??r Gerede sein 
Ja ich lieb wenn du besoffen durch die Gegend schreist

Nur mit dir jeden Tag, mir sind alle egal 
Die schlampen egal 
Du wei??t ich schei?? auf Becks, Hasch und Schnaps 
Du hast meinen humor, du bist f??r mich extra mein Schatz

Vega,"Man führte uns ins heilige Land, hier fließt Milch und Honig
Drum wurden alle Menschen dick und klobig
Alles klebt, denn die Leute vergaßen
Vor lauter Freundlichkeit die Flut und die Heuschreckenplagen
Sie trauern nicht wenn lebende Geschöpfe sterben
Nein, erst wenn aus Regentropfen Frösche werden
Sie schmücken sich mit Lack ihre Füße
Doch bei 'nem 40-Tagesmarsch durch die Wüste
Machen sie Halt, und wissen nicht weiter
Die Masken fallen ab, denn ihnen rückt nun die Zeit ab
Und sind sie kniend am Beten, lassen alles liegen und stehen
Denn sie werden ihren Kindern erzählen:

Als die schwarze Sonne kam
Wurde alles zu Staub
Sie nahmen uns alles was wir hatten
Bis auf die Haut
Als die schwarze Sonne kam
Wurde alles zu Staub
Soldaten feuerten Raketen in den Himmel hinauf
Doch nichts hielt sie auf

Wir kamen ins gelobte Land, erst kam das Dope und dann
War der Himmel wo einst Gott war voll mit Satelliten
Wer beide Backen hinhält der geht ohne Kampf
Je doofer man sich klug stellt desto eher kommt Jehovah dann
Im Buch steht Moses hat das Meer geteilt
Doch wenn es fast nichts gibt, wird nichts mehr geteilt
Dann wird geschossen und gemordet bis nur Erde bleibt
Stolze Schiffe sinken in die blaue Tiefe - Schwermetall
Wir sahen durchs Teleskop Galaxien, riesengroße
Durchs Mikroskop ins Allerkleinste, die Atome
Nur das Richtige sah niemand seit der Blitz von Hiroshima
Seelen trank ging es nur voran solange Krieg war

Als die schwarze Sonne kam
Wurde alles zu Staub
Sie nahmen uns alles was wir hatten
Bis auf die Haut
Als die schwarze Sonne kam
Wurde alles zu Staub
Soldaten feuerten Raketen in den Himmel hinauf
Doch nichts hielt sie auf

Und deshalb lassen sie's uns ausbaden
Hatten alles, aber alles war nicht das was wir gebraucht haben
Herztod, Schmerz zog, Glaube verstummt
Wir machen Wasser nicht zu Wein, Nein, wir saufen uns dumm
Zwischen Servus in Bars, der Gefährdung des Staats
Kein Platz für Engel in 'nem Himmel, wo sie Airbusse fahren
Der verlorene Sohn ist heimgekehrt, is' aus Eis des Herz
Mein es ernst, Chab, denn Wochen war ich eingesperrt
Laufe raus, die Kapuze auf und schieß
Denn seit Tagen ist in meiner Stadt Bambule auf der Street
Hier bei Tauben und Sehschwachen, werden Stumme dir erzählen
Von dem Tag, an dem der blaue Planet brannte

Als die schwarze Sonne kam
Wurde alles zu Staub
Sie nahmen uns alles was wir hatten
Bis auf die Haut

Wurde alles zu Staub

Mi aspetta una staffetta illimitata

Di notte vedo mostri con la faccia ribaltata
La vendetta privata
In una cassetta piratata
Poi la luce si fa fioca, la pupilla dilatata
Per i soldi, per la droga e per la vita dilaniata
Vorrei che tu vedessi con che faccia disperata
Mi guarda mia mamma quando me ne vado via di casa
Fanculo!
Quando ci si guarda dentro, qui non ride più nessuno

Per uscire in tempo da questo tunnel buio
Perché mi hanno detto che pensare uccide più del fumo
E non pensare che non sia sensibile
Ma me ne frego di quello che credi sia credibile
Ti sei mai chiesto quanto sia difficile decidere se
Vivere per scrivere o se scrivere per vivere? (Eh!?)
Ma l'uomo è un animale e devi urlare più forte
Se non vuoi diventare il suo giullare di corte
Per imparare qui devi sbagliare un quintale di volte
E provare ad andare oltre
Tu non ragionare ad onde corte
Non si può spiegare il nosense
Allungare gambe corte
Raddrizzare piante storte
Anteporre il male e ignorare quanto sangue scorre

La mia vita è un cortometraggio, racconto di un saggio
Dove il protagonista sembra morto nel viaggio
Ti ho già perso di vista
Mentre affondo tra il fango, il rimorso, il rimpianto

Pur di non tenere addosso il volto del falso

Ora racconto la storia, la storia del bando
Qualcosa nel bando non va
Yo Christ, si io ho sempre risposto quando hai chiamato
Qualcosa nel bando non va
Qualcosa nel bando non va (qualcosa nel bando non va)
Qualcosa nel bando non va(qualcosa nel bando non va)
Qualcosa nel bando non va (se mi chiama Cristo di notte)
Ya, yeah, yeah

Mi chiamano a tutti gli orari
Mi scrivono in tanti anche la sera tardi
Se mi chiama Cristo di notte

Fra’ che faccio? Sta chiamando Cristo
Gli spiego che faccio soldi come un ricco
Ma lui fa come se non mi avesse sentito
Se mi chiama Cristo di notte
Qualcosa nel bando non va

Ti sbagli se pensi che siamo identici
Dimmi dove pensi di andare se ti accontenti
Non è che adesso che prendo il pane non ho più i denti
Anzi, ho pagato dei diamanti per renderli splendidi
Prenditi ció che ti meriti questo è il motto
Navigo tutto sconvolto, a largo la costa sott’occhio
Attraverso il mare mosso ma ai piedi le Gucci
Rilassato mentre fumo la mia buddha cheese
Cin Cin, con i fra porto in alto la città
Porto via il blocco da Coco, noci di cocco
Saranno in aereoporto pronti al mio ritorno
Risponderò che sogno tra poco vi ci porto, lo giuro
Tu pianti grana, io semino la grana
Perchè non ti levi stupida puttana
Raccolgo la prima che è aumentata
La seconda se n’è andata
Non ci sono piú problemi se non fosse che

Se mi chiama Cristo di notte

Occhio soldato che in questa guerra c’è molto di più di quello che vedi dal tuo mirino
Vedila così 
Per colpa di ‘sto schifo sono diventato schivo ma scrivo e fa meno male sì
È la mia anestesia
Perché dopo un paio di botte nel culo che ho preso mi sento molto più forte, sono un guerriero
E non avevo parole eppure le ho scritte quindi aspettati che un giorno che ti tornano tutte indietro
E il bando non è stato una semplice monolocale
Era solo un segno che dal peggio puoi svoltare
Chiedilo a Joe Vain, George, Fly la minaccia
C’erano pompieri, polizia e l’ambulanza
Tutti in venticinque metri quadri di stanza
Ma appena è successo ho ricevuto una chiamata
Ero diversi kilometri lontano da casa, era Cristo
Qualcosa nel bando non va

Vegas Jones,"Il fumo mi avvolge confuso ma forse ti vedo
Se Dio mi vede adesso sicuro mi toglie di mezzo
La strada l’abbatti soltanto a dadi e soldi per terra
Gli altri modi più di tanto non credere servano
Credimi non c’è niente come i giorni nel bando
Mi vengono i brividi ancora adesso se ci ripenso
Le ragnatele, lo spettro
La nostra tele è uno specchio
Le catene si spezzano se è arrivato il momento
Quella prova del nove sopravvivendo a nove
L’appartamento è solo l’ennesima prova del mio talento
Comprare quel gioiello è stato un step, bella
Ma non sto permettendo che mi togli le Air da terra

Oh Dio che parli per me
Dai tempi di “No, prof, assente”
Dai, ma fai il serio, riprenditi
Non puoi avere un nuovo armadio
Se quello che hai adesso è pieno di scheletri
Ma davvero chi ti credi di essere?
La poesia viene per prima, fra’
Come il commento di chi ti invidia
Sì, ma chi te l’ha chiesto?
Ti senti responsabile del fatto
Che sto tutto perso il pomeriggio presto per caso
E le signore del palazzo mi dicono: “Sei cambiato”
Non lo sai cos’ho passato a quel sesto piano
E ho bisogno di sentirmi odiato
In fondo amato già lo sono stato
Quella troia mi è bastata e mi imbastisce ancora

Ho tutto quello che mi serve
Ma evidentemente non mi basta ancora
È tutto oscuro e freddo, come quando mi facevo in quattro
Lì mi davano solo quattro euro all’ora in nero
Il resto è storia

Volevate Veggie B? Eccolo qua

Anche se sono dei giorni grigi speriamo nel money rain

Li ho già visti quei tizi girare con i tuoi nemici ieri
Ricorda che per ogni passo che muovi ti lasci le impronte dietro di te
Visto quello che ho fatto lì fuori non mi stupirei di trovarmi nel database

E vogliono sapere quello che so
Cosa vogliono sapere del mio top flow?
So solo dirti come suona il sound magic
Bora Bora Kalimalibu come il Jedi
E qui il cielo ha bei colori ma c'è il trick dietro
Lei, ""Che cosa hai lì dentro?""
Merce nel mio Benz Wagon, trip nel mio cervello
Tolgo il culo dalla strada e faccio un impero
Prego che mi ci facciano uscire intero

Scrivo un'altra pagina del mio vangelo, sincero è l'unica cosa in cui credo
Certe cose succedono, ancora non me le spiego
Ma se hai fede l'unica cosa che conta è il mistero
È il mio Modus Operandi che lo prendo, non chiedo
Perdo ancora l'accendino, te lo chiedo e la accendo
Ogni mio comandamento è un'eccezione alla regola, questo ne è un chiaro esempio

Quello che è tornato per portare via la sua gente
Se non ti venisse in mente, sono sempre io
Non seguirmi, non so se il posto dove vado ti piacerà
Sono in chilling, mi bevo lo Skinni Vanilli, mi fumo Blunt
Da bambino ho visto farlo bene ma non abbastanza, sta a me farlo al top fra
È come non era previsto vedermi, non è più previsto uno stop, fra
Non mi resta che prendere il volo
Cancellare le mie tracce

Lascivement devant la glace, elle enfile sa tenue de chasse
Elle arrange
Une dernière fois son maquillage, déboutonne un peu son corsage

Les proies se jettent dans le piège

Dans ses entrailles elle cache son arme secrète
De corps à cœur, de sang à sang, elle blesse

Enfermée dans sa camisole, on sent que rien ne la désole
Elle s’inspire
De la noirceur de ses textes, et dans le crime elle se projette
Elle se délecte
De l’innocence de ses conquêtes
Mais rien ne l’arrête
Les hommes, envers elle, ont une dette

Dans ses entrailles elle cache son arme secrète
De corps à cœur, de sang à sang, elle blesse

Entre ses hanches ils se démènent, tans pis si rien ne les protège
Elle s’applique
Leur fait payer leur inconscience, les punit de leur décadence ...

It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind, and she didn't pay attention
She was going way too fast

She saw both their lives flash before her eyes

And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock

She bowed her head to pray
She said, ""I'm sorry for the way

We're afraid we can't explain your dream to you.

And Daniel is his name
So before you take another sleeping pill
Perhaps he can explain.

That much is true
But it is God who gives me wisdom
And through me He will explain your dreams to you.

I quote in elegiacs all the crimes of Heliogabalus
In conics I can floor peculiarities parabolous

I can tell undoubted Raphaels from Gerard Dows and Zoffanies
I know the croaking chorus from the Frogs of Aristophanes
Then I can hum a fugue of which I've heard the music's din afore
And whistle all the airs from that infernal nonsense Pinafore

And whistle all the airs from that infernal nonsense Pinafore
And whistle all the airs from that infernal nonsense Pinafore
And whistle all the airs from that infernal nonsense Pinapinafore

Then I can write a washing bill in Babylonic cuneiform
And tell you ev'ry detail of Caractacus's uniform
In short, in matters vegetable, animal, and mineral
I am the very model of a modern Major-General

In short, in matters vegetable, animal, and mineral
He is the very model of a modern Major-General

In fact, when I know what is meant by ""mamelon"" and ""ravelin""
When I can tell at sight a Mauser rifle from a javelin
When such affairs as sorties and surprises I'm more wary at
And when I know precisely what is meant by ""commissariat""

When I have learnt what progress has been made in modern gunnery
When I know more of tactics than a novice in a nunnery
In short, when I've a smattering of elemental strategy
You'll say a better Major-General had never sat a gee

You'll say a better Major-General had never sat a gee
You'll say a better Major-General had never sat a gee
You'll say a better Major-General had never sat a sat a gee

I must teach you a lesson that I never learned
But without a god, could you carry on?
If the answer is â??noâ??, then just stop right there

I used to hate her Jesus, but jesus is herâ?¦..

God was created by human minds
Her mind was feeble so she loved god
God was created by human minds
Her god is dead, because she died
God was created by human minds
I fucking hate god, so I hate her

What I thought to be possession of my own mortal shell
Turned out to be my subconscious allowing my mind to be tricked

God was created by human minds
A ghost to scare you, make you succumb
God was created by human minds
Pathetic liar, I'm not afraid!

Her jesus was not to blame for taking her life she died by my hand
My hands around her neck, my cock deep in her cunt

Open your mind and understand (Repeat)

My hate comes from my mind, violence in my past
I fixate and connect, obsess and destroy
Her need for a god, created by her past
Fear and ostracization, she wanted it this way
This abuse created demons, one violent one demure
In the name of their god, I denounce the name of Christ

I am my own savior

From beyond the grave to awaken your mind
I must teach you a lesson that I never learned
But without a god, could you carry on?

Stars appear in the dusken sky, invoking urgent senses
The breeze wafts fragrance of passion and winter forgotten

Moving forward through rusted iron gates
Rediscovering distant lost memories
Minutes flying by as the scene darkens
Scurrying across dew soaked greenery
Unearthing freshly planted arrangements

Beads of sweat stream into my wildly rolling eyes, burning
Causing my vision to take on kaleidoscopic characteristics
The view is so inspiring as my target is now in blurred sight
Her name written so eloquently, I cannot bear the suspense

As I open the earthâ?¦..
Tearing though the groundâ?¦..

As I penetrateâ?¦the earth
My skin is soiled and rawâ?¦digging
Fingernails snap off from misuse
The blood flows early tonightâ?¦

Through The Earth
Six Feet Down
Fresh Young Corpse
I Grow Aroused

My shaking bloodied hand scrapes the finished wood
As I punch furiously on her box,
I first see a crack, then it starts to widen
Smashing through the cheap coffin, I drag her body upâ?¦

Laying her across the dirt, her crucifix glimmers
Upon her silky breasts, cold and hard from the cruel earth
Laying myself on top of her, to try and warm the flesh
Feeling her tight ass, my hands probe between her legs
Forcing my fingers into her, I kiss her blue lips
Remembering how she felt when alive, now even better!!!

Her father, an evil man, he wanted to destroy her
Constantly fucking her, and warping her mind
My love for her the strongest she'd felt
Right under the love for her Jesusâ?¦

But now we see what-Jesus did for her
Her body is mine-He can have her soul
Such short time alive-Short to her was good

As distant voices start closing in, I hasten the procedure
Her body replaced into the ground, to be saved for later
Earth filled in hastily as I flee from the graveyard
But the fact that makes this all right, I didn't kill herâ?¦.

Sobbing through a smileâ?¦.

Unfolds before me
Back to School but with intent to spill the blood of christs' sheep
On my flesh

Christ, they will pay for your sins
Everyone guilty in my eyes
My blade warm in my moist hand
Who will be the first?

Quickly venturing into the bathroom, class is in session
I find a young girl in a stall, I am in love again
I want to take as many as I can
This little whore gutted on the toilet
My dick stiffens staring at her vagina
Warm wet pool spreads across the tile

This is not a replacement

Like a spider web no escape
This girls come in but never leave
I start to lose count of my victims
Blood to my ankles vindicates

They are on to me

But never felt young

Beat it out of his young mind
Dad was a veteran and alcoholic
And so violent
Mother just sat there watching the TV
Her only words hate
She paid no notice to him
He couldn't love her
If she died he wouldn't care
So now he's so cold with no emotion
And no one matters
All that he can feel, merely physical
He thinks that is emotion

(He feels nothing)

Day to day lusting after flesh
Feeling satisfied with penetration

All the girls in his mind
Fantasy merely postpones his wrath
Acting out, soon follows
Walking dead women waiting to die

Fingernails embedded deep into flesh
Straddling his body gyrating slowly
Soft hair flows over ripe breasts swaying gently
Her screams of ecstasy, not fear this time

Digging through her garbage, searching for something
Picking through remnants of her daily patterns

Discarded tampon, telephone bill stub, last night's dinner
His heart growing fonder with every load he takes

Dreaming of what is to come for this girl
Her broken ripped flesh, swollen on his penis

Upon his discovery of her depressive state of existenceâ?¦â?¦..her sorrow
His attention to her growing stronger, more obsessiveâ?¦â?¦..she's his

He knows everything

Halo vividly backing a man of such flawlessness
Lusting eyes easily attracting the whore

Laying in her bed, mind drifting to her own self-consumed fantasy
What has he done to deserve her, not even daddy can take her here
Glassy slitted eyes wander across the fading wallpaper
Absorbing visions of a large wooden crucifix and the picture of her lord
She loves the picture of her lordâ?¦

Feeling of childhood

Raise to her feet
Holding her crotch
Stumble forward

Blindly reaches
Forward dimly lit
Comforting haven
This sickening spectacle

Virgin scraping
At her clit grab
The cross from the
Wall her secretions flow

As the twinkling
Diamond doorknob
Turns and the light
Shines in the old man

Stands with little girl
His silhouette cast
Across the dark wall
Changing so slightly

Sacred and ancient her images of what he was

Grabbing the cross from the wall, her secretions flow

",She Never Noticed Me,2002

Leaves rustle by ominously, a chill quakes through my mind
Though tear drenched eye I witness, this innocents demise
The heavy hand of her father, her virginal flesh defiled

My hand moves to my scrotum, not wanting to enjoy
But the pulsating heat of my passion, I can feel on my inner thigh
Peering through the bushes, to the dimly lit room inside
Desecration of a young girl, makes me wish she was my bride
Now I must venture further, into this shrine of pain
To satisfy my suffering, and end this creatures demise.

Now its my turn, I make my way into
This foul environment
His dick slips out, in utter dismay
His gaze meets with mine
My actions swift, as I push him to the floor
This man will have to die
His daughter panting, crouched in terror
They both await my next moveâ?¦.

Reflecting on my actions, I understand what must now happen
Concentrating my weight into my knee, I drop upon his face
My erection is persistent, so I turn and peer downwards
Laying in a pool of vaginal fluid, I approach my victim

Regret! Sorrow!
Sadness! Aching for my deathâ?¦.

The pulsing flesh under me, I can't fulfill my urges
Stepping out of myself and letting the hate control
Quivering in such ecstasy, my thoughts now wander

Into a void, another plane, a heightened state of mind
Driven into this negativity and exploring

Surprisingly she cannot feel my hands around her neck, or my death sinking into herâ?¦

Shakingâ?¦.
Smilingâ?¦.
Weepingâ?¦.
Bleedingâ?¦.

Her Jesus embraces touching, her breast tenderly
With a light push he enters, her swollen lips

But looming in the back of her mind
The knowledge that her Jesus is dead

Soldiers all go marching into battle, moving slowly on across the ground
Tracks of tanks flatten the sand beneath them, soon to be replaced by human flesh
Loved ones left behind are not forgotten, memories kept fresh by photographs
The will of the politicians is forced and now soldiers kill to make them proud

They can feel the spirit that they will kill for
Now the soldiers have become their god...

Arrogance now fuels the need for conquest, nuclear chemistry is the god
Capitol approaches in the distance, enemy waiting in their walls
As the first attack is launched upon them, you could see the passion in their eyes
Eyes that would soon be ruptured and removed, by the weapons that will take their life

They can feel the spirit that they will kill for
Now the soldiers have become their god
Pieces of human blasting through the air
The conclusion will not end in life

Pain comes, from deep within, brought about by course of the human condition and destroys
Resulting in the dreams end, and you see the rapid demise of this happy family
Substance to dull the pain, is consumed, now oblivious to the loss of all emotion
Mother came home so late, so fucked up and ragged from having sex with another

Little girl in my arms turned eight months three days ago
Pretty green eyes that cried when I scolded her
Married thirteen years, I loved my wife and my job
Three perfect daughters I did not deserve
She took them away, said I had grown cold
They found another life with a new daddy to love
I tried to see them but days past they grew away
Gave them my heart, they took the life from me

I watched their life - two months after they had gone
Followed patterns - she went running in the morning
And made my plans - I'll take the fear from their eyes

Daddy is at the door
Don't be afraid
Just let me in
Everything is fine

Her smile shattered - ""Daddy why do you have a gun?""
Gun shot painless - I know the others will soon wake
Through the hallway - nine year old died in her bed
Master bedroom - the baby stirs in her crib

Your green eyes
Cry no more
My baby girl
Dies in my arms

You want my heart, you got to work
And show me that you'd ride it there for me
I can see right through your eyes, and I know what you tryin' to do
You tryin' to rob, steal, take my love, well fuck you

Take my love, ha ha, not a woman on earth that can do that
Say what, I don't know where you from, or where you been at
I'm letting you know what's up, and if you don't play by the rules
Oh baby, you get cut, I talked so much, you took my love

Sip-sippin' bub and the bass is knockin'

But my smile is fake, 'cause I'm missing you
Baby you know that I didn't learn my lesson
Shoulda gave you more time, more love and affection
And when I see you later with that other guy
Keep telling myself a player ain't suppose to cry

You took my love, I thought I was the only one
You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun
You took my love, but my heart keeps telling me you're the one
You took my love, took my love

She took my love, and played me for a sucker
But it don't even matter, 'cause you know I still love her
She took my heart, and threw it on the ground
But it don't even matter, 'cause I still want her around

She's such a love taker, she's such a love taker
It's guaranteed that she's a professional heart breaker
But a great love maker, all in a sheet
She made my heart skip a beat
But for now she's as cold as they come
Not mags, no life and no guns
She took my love

You took my love, I thought I was the only one
You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun
You took my love, but my heart keeps telling me you're the one
You took my love, took my love

Immigrant parents but I’m living the American dream for them now
It’s it’s it’s about to go down
This is for Eddie, Bobby, Rudy, Johnny
Up in the sky drinking poly loddy doddy
I don’t need a Maybach or Buggati
Couple of beds and some sheets, that’s a party
Go DJ, blow the speakers
All my women wear heels, no sneakers
Grim reaper, the night is mine

Y ahora grito tan fuerte cómo deseo tenerte otra vez

En el amor hay que perdonar, sé que algún día tú volverás
En el amor hay que perdonar, sé que algún día tú volverás

Espero que no sea tarde
Y puedas volver a amarme
Verás en mí un cambio radical
Me siento con frío y pánico
Descalza en el suelo ártico
Ten compasión, no me castigues más

En el amor hay que perdonar, sé que algún día tú volverás
En el amor hay que perdonar, sé que algún día tú volverás

Quiero saber de mi pecado
Eso que no me has contado
Y tal vez no sea verdad
El amor es arte y ensayo
Y hoy de tus errores yo callo
Cuando se ama hay que perdonar

Entre la sombra que ilumina el sol
Veo el reflejo de nuestro esplendor

Sé que no es el final
Por ti siempre voy a esperar
Sé que algún día tú volverás

En el amor hay que perdonar, sé que algún día tú volverás

I peep a frown ? on your face when I ask you ""where you men at?""
But I ain't really tryin' to invade your space

And you used to be a bright gurl now world is death
Got an attitude which you hadn't heard of him

Did I ?? gurl never ??????
When I was broke on the block you was there for me
See you can cut through loose you don't compare to me

Yo' ma I'm always seen you around but lately 
Seem somethin' keepin' you down and
They say your x so abusive 
You don't play sports how you get those bruses?
To be honest the dude is useless
Let me take you out the hood we can do this (ok)
You too cute to be seatin' on the bench 
You can start on my teem ma come n represent and
I can treat you better than that looser ever did
Cause you don't deserve the type of stress that he give
I know I'm young but I can treat you right
And if he trippin' then you need to be with me tonight
Ah and baby he don't have an ounce of respect for you 
That's why I think is Gangsta how you backed off and left the dude
Shorty age ain't nothin' but a number 
If you need to get away take the Benz or the Hummer and
You say I don't know enough about you but I just can't see myself being 
Without you 
Yeah

Velma Carpenter,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,

Like all at once I wake up from something that keeps knocking at my brain
Before I go insane I hold my pillow to my head
And spring up in my bed screaming out the words I dread
I think I love you (I think I love you)

This morning I woke up with this feeling
I didn't know how to deal with and so I just decided to myself
I'd hide it to myself and never talk about it
And did not go and shout it when you walked into the room
I think I love you (I think I love you)

I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say that I never felt this way

I don't know what I'm up against
I don't know what it's all about
I got so much to think about

Hey, I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say I never felt this way

Believe me you really don't have to worry
I only wanna make you happy and if you say ""hey go away"" I will
But I think better still I'd better stay around and love you
Do you think I have a case let me ask you to your face
Do you think you love me?

Locked in a still position
Swaying back and forth
Needles in my arms
Broken inside
My chest rips open
And blood runs on the floor
Sealing my heart
Gazing at a wall
In some dark corner
Somewhere in time
Try to make sense
Relation unknown
Alone, alone, alone
In pain, and pain, in pain
Fear is here
Bleeding inside
Oh, you will remind
The anger all lost in fear
I never lied to you
You always lied to me
What the fuck is the difference?
I'm sitting here bleeding inside, inside, inside
It's no big deal
It's no big deal
Wrapped in lies
Close your eyes
See the pain
Locked inside
Ripped open for a fucking dollar
A green piece of paper shatters my life
Twisted up until I scream
Let me go, release me
Release me, release me, release me
Crying out, hearing sounds
But the feeling got lost away
In some forgotten song
They said, they said
To close my eyes and dream away
Dream away, but the pain
The pain didn't go away
It never goes away, it didn't go away
It never goes away
I'm lying in sound
Oh, and you, and dream
I'm breaking down
A thousand years, and all the tears
And feelings locked inside, locked inside
Tide of emotion
Blood, rain, and tears
Ruined all the years, ruined all the years
They told me that I was never here
Never here, never here, never here

I never played your fucking game
Oh lips are kneeling on my forehead
Now bouncing off the walls
Another way to say hello
I forgave you last time
I know how, and that you would
I never meant to be this way
You close your eyes, and never, and never
Woke up this way
You never woke up, woke up
You woke up this way
That's what I say going down
I feel it going down
I'll crawl into your window
When you're sleeping real tight
I'll kill you in your sleep
I brought the fucking knife
You drive me crazy every day
No, you don't leave me alone
My brain is on the floor
I can't decide until you're dead




",Killing Me,1998
Velvet Acid Christ,"
Assimilate the night
They cut into your brain
They crack apart the skull
And stick the wires in
The computer releationship
A flame into the flesh
A cut into the brain
A cut runs in your face
You can't believe your head
You can't believe your eyes
Nobody can escape
The futile assesment
The futile assesment
Oh, futile
We're futile
Futile
You're futile
Futile religion
Futile expression
Your futile aggression
A futile obsession
Oh, futile assassination
You'll faulter
Your generation
Your immoral futile assimilation
Expressionation

Open eyes blinded to the obvious
Right wing twitch spreading the disease
Of idiocies conquering with ease

Tonight tonight I slowly bleed
Haunted by the will of unease
Shattered by the sound of your screams
Tonight, tonight I watch you plea

Gasping for air, holding your throat, choking, feeling starts to distort

Propaganda for future wars
Nothing ever settles the score
No relief for ignorant stress
Mindless fiends under duress

Vomit from your crooked mouth
Scratch and claw, you can't get out
The mocking voices never end
Pointless views are such a trend

Wish I was a holy savior
I'd turn my back on all of you
Wish you were a different person
One that wasn't so confused

Vomit from your crooked mouth
Scratch and claw, you can't get out
The mocking voices never end

Wish I was a cruel infection
Killing off most all of you
Wish I were a rotting corpse
Haunting all of those like you

What if I, had chosen to,
Make a left, when I should have made a right and,
What if I, followed though,
And chilled with my crew last night.
What if I, took the call and
Stayed on the phone when I should have been gone.
And What if I, hadn?t turned around and seen you there.

If I could go back in time,
To when the stars aligned,
Would I find the strength again to talk to you,
Walk up to you.
If I could do it all again,
I wouldn?t change a single thing.

Don?t need to compromise, what I feel inside,
Don?t need to clarify my position I,
Submit to destiny, so baby come with me,
Let?s take it for a ride,
Baby, baby, I, I, I.
And furthermore, if you?re looking for,
Someone to be around, baby I?m down,

To change how I feel about you,

But I know that I believe in my point of view,
That I'm all mad for you.

Everybody tries to tell me you're no good,
And that boy you don't deserve a girl like me but I disagree,
And it's not their concern.
No they never had a love like you and I,
Call it jealousy playin' with their minds,

For desert, sexin her at the table.

Took some time to realize,
'Cause everything was spinning turning upside down.
I was stunned I was so confused
Wondered what to do, and so I followed their next move,
'cause it was you know who.

You never saw me when you kissed tonight,
You never noticed with your eyes shut tight,
You never saw me through the window steam,
Never knew I caught you schemin?.
Thought that you were creepin? out of sight,
Thought that you could get it on all night,
Never saw me till I hit the lights,
Now you see me now you don?t.

In the ride, hot inside, all the windows foggin? up,
From their heavy breath, makin? love in silhouette,
didn't stop, till they got to your driveway.

Wilson

Once upon a time there was a mountain
That rose out of a vast green forest
And in the forest there were birds
And lakes and rocks and trees and rivers

The forest was also inhabited
By a small group of people called the lizards
The lizards were a simple people
And they had lived in the forest undisturbed
For thousands of years in utter peace and tranquility

Once a year when spring came
And the first blossoms began to show
The lizards would gather at the base of the mountain
To give thanks for all that they had

They thanked the birds
And they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks
And the trees and the rivers
But most importantly, they thanked Icculus

Icculus lived at the top of the mountain
Or at least everyone thought so
For no one had actually ever seen him

But they knew he existed
Because they had the Helping Friendly Book
Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book
To the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift

It contained all of the knowledge
Inherent in the universe
And had enabled the Lizards
To exist in harmony with nature for years

And so they lived
Until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge
His name was Wilson
And he quickly became intrigued
By the Lizards way of life

He asked if he could stay on
And live in the forest
And the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider
Were happy to oblige

Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years
Studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book
And all was well

Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone
Wilson explained that he had hidden the book
Knowing that the Lizards had become
Dependent on it for survival

He declared himself king
And enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge
He cut down the trees and built a city
Which he called Prussia

And in the center of the city
He built a castle
And locked in the highest tower of the castle

Velvet Revolver,"She's all that I see and all that I breathe
Take a breath and hold her in as the shadows whispering
I can hear the laughter, knowing what they're after
And while she flies beside me, a man with broken wings

Take, take a look around, she's a pretty good dancer
She dances on my grave
Every time it goes down, every time she comes down
Every time we fall down, she dances all over me

She's the world in my feet, the sun that gives see
Take a rest and hold her near or she'll float away from here
'Cause I'm knowing what you fearing, an unsentimental jury
And every mile I guide you, I watch over everything

Take, take a look around, she's a pretty good dancer
She dances on my grave
Every time it goes down, every time she comes down
Every time we fall down, she dances all over me

And every time that we fail is just another long wasted night
And the dance that we do is just another way for you to roll over me
And the bed that we're sharing is the home that I wanna bring you
Wanna feel you, oh, I don't wanna hear you

Take, take a look around, she's a pretty good dancer
She dances on my grave
Every time it goes down, every time she comes down
Every time we fall down, she dances all over me
She dances all over me, she dances all over me

She's a pretty good dancer
Take, take, take a look around, she's a pretty good dancer
Pretty, pretty, pretty dancer
Every time she comes down, she comes down, comes down

With disdain for everlasting liars

Fighting for equality gives you the right to execution?
It's hard fight, is it a good fight?
Is there any other way to liberty?
Intensity, brutality in this static institution that we call ""Our State""

TERROR cannot be my decision.

Cut your fingers on the page where those old wounds run deep.
But the taste of the sand, rosary in her hand still haunts you in your sleep.

I'll deliver, vapid vulture to the light
Gonna shiver and shiver and shiver and shiver
You'll shiver through the night
Deceived by the sound the pitter patter of little feet, 
Was the rhythmless rave of your cloven hooved babe calling to you from the street.
As she taunts you as she dances your genitals in the dirt.
Your eternal heart aches, your bones bend and break but the beating barely hurts.
So desperate to love but you just can't pretend that her hands weren't claws.
Your madonna was medusa in the end.shiver, yeah you'll shiver through the night

Venerea,"[Originally by Yardbirds]

Sick at heart and lonely,
Deep in dark despair.
Thinking one thought only
Where is she tell me where.
And if she says to you
She don't love me
Just give her my message
Tell her of my plea

And I know if she had me back again
Well I would never make her sad.
I've gotta heart full of soul.

She's been gone such a long time
Longer than I can bear
But if she says she wants me
Tell her that I'll be there
And if she says to you
She don't love me
Just give her my message
Tell her of my plea.



",Heart Full of Soul,
Venerea,"There's something going
In the air tonight
And we all know why it is
Kids are boppin' around
We're all feeling allright
And we all know why it is
What's the use in stayin'
At the status quo ?
Dare to go !

[Chorus:]
Something's flying in the air tonight
Something all the kids wanna do
Go stagedivin' in the air tonight
Dare to go !

I know some bigshots who complain
About the kids who dive
And I don't know why they do it
Feel free to dive when we're playin' live
Can't see no reason not to do it
What's the use in fighting
In the front now ?
Dare to go !

Jump off the stage
Like a kangaroo in a rage !

to purposely shun none of 
the people around me
but now I've finally realized
I'm all on my own
I've always had the opinion
that if I can live with myself
somebody else can do as well
But now I'm my room
and I don't feel at home
When I'm in a crowd
how come I feel so alone ?
Every place feels like home
where I'm alone

I've got no peace of mind
I've got no peace of mind

The bigger the population
the fewer you can see

It's an obvious paradox
or at least it should

I swear I see eternity
And it doesn't scare me
though I wish it would

Be your date in the daytime babe

Today is the day of salvation!




",Salvation,1989
Vengeance Rising,"We are here, there shall be no stopping us
Brothers understand, you have been sent
I seek to strengthen you, cause I understand
We are not here by our own hand

We are the rising, foretold by Simeon
Raise your fists as one
We are the rising, my brothers, I and thee
In service to the King

Understand, action is silent speech
John 13 know what I mean?
I through 17, speaks of we
You have the example, now lets see

We are the rising, foretold by Simeon
Raise your fists as one
We are the rising, my brothers, I and thee
In service to the King

Grieve me not, when I arrive
Show me the unity, that does not divide
Be, if you not be, don't waste my time
Rising, all - be 13, you know what I mean

Veni Domine,"I saw an angel coming down from heaven
 With the key to the abyss and a great chain in his hand
 he seized the dragon and bound him for a thousand years
Upon the thrones sat those to whom judgement was assigned
 I could see the souls of those whom had been killed
Those who had not worshipped the image of the beast
 The day has come for the dragon to return
 He must fight the final battle
 I know the end for I have read the word
There is no way back Armageddon
 The chosen came to life again and reigned
With Christ for a thousand years
Though the rest of the dead remained in the grave
 This is the first resurrection over these
Second death has no claim
 Foes marched across the breadth of the earth
 And surrounded the camp of gods people - the city he loves
 But fire came down from heaven and devoured them
And the devil who deceived them
 Was thrown into the lake of burning sulphur
Where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown
They will be tormented day and night forever and ever
 I feel your love surround me
When the storms outside are cold
I see you walk before me
 When the roads just fade away
 You let me rest in harmony
 Until you come again
 I wait for you
 I'm waiting for the dawn
To see the light of the rising son",Armageddon,1996

Now as we say goodbye

To one of our own

But we're not alone
Though the leaves will fall

And the tears will flow
May it always comfort us to know
The family tree will always grow
Father down to son, mother to daughter

Thicker than water, we are made of this
From the Earth we rise
To the Earth returning
We'll keep a candle burning

For the ones we'll miss
And when we say goodbye
To one of our own
We may be lonely

Our little friend just sits and smiles
Take them home and love them
Read the bible to them
Be sure to kiss each one goodnight

But come the night
You'll freeze with fright

Another dies

Creeping and searching for victims unknowing
What fate doth await round each corner
The take in the night
He's got you in his sight

Now that I have warned you
Always look behind you
You'll never know just who'll be there

May be the one to fear
So never trust those you don't know

Lie momenterally unguarded.
Raging flames carved by the innocence of the angel's hearts

Will release forth their wealth of centuries of God loving
Souls once wronged of their destiny of Heaven's golden palace.

The castle walls are closing in, she's crippled now with age
Welcomes death with open arms - the reaper turns the page

Venom,"Satan, Father
Help me from this grave


Demons, Warriors

Ever be my slaves

'Cause I can't reason

With men and mortal fools
They will die hard,


Hear the golden rule





Die Hard

Legions iron and steel

Die Hard

Men of war reveiled

Die Hard
Captors of the Brave
Die Hard



Die Hard





Sinner, liar

Guard your crown of thorns

Priestess, Parson

Live your life of scorn

Of Hell and blasphemy
I can RAISE the fires



We can grow strong
Satanic royalty





Evil, angels

Ride the wings of Hades
Vultures of the night


Death is on our side

Furnace burnin' bright

'Cause we ain't getting tired



",Die Hard,1982
Venom,"The witches brew a pot of hate
With lizard, but and man
With a smile they laugh their spells
Astir with wretched hand
Calling demons baphomet
And mephistopheles
The tattered firyres cackle
As their mortal victims bleed
Don't burn the witch
The ways of hell aren't wrong
Don't burn the witch
Let them brew their song
The witches of the blackened arts
Are cunning, cruel and mean
Persecuted by religion
God the man unseen
Beastial malevolence
Is chartered in their bones
Leave the unreal house of God
And burn in hell at home
Eye of lizard
Wing of bat
Testicle of man
Tongue of eagle
Brain of rat
Jesus Christ's left hand
The witches make the voodoo doll
A toy taboo in heaven
They dance around the pentagram
In search of rape by satan
Leave the heart and blood of men
In cauldrons laced in sin
Add the arsenic, hemlock, pus
Triumph takes the wings
",Don't Burn the Witch,1982
