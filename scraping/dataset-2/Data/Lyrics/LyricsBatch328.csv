Great 8,"I saw a blind man,
He was a kind man,
Helping a fellow along,
One could not see,
One could not walk,
But they both were humming this song;
 
When you're smiling, When you're smiling, 
The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,
The whole world smiles with you.
 
I used to worry,
I used to hurry,
Each time it started to rain,
Now I see light,
Learned wrong from right,
And you'll never hear me complain;
 
When you're smiling, When you're smiling, 
The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,",When You're Smiling,1983
Great American String Band,"
I'm in love,
I'm in love,
I'm in love with a girl,
That's what's the matter with me  
I'm in love, 
I'm in love, with a beautiful girl, 
But she don't give a darn about me
to make her love me I tried,
How I sighed and I cried 
But she just refused 
And ever since she's gone away,
I've got those lovesick blues
 
Got the feeling called the ""blue hoo's,"" 
since my sweetie said ""Good Bye""
Seems I don't know what to ""Do Hoo""
All day long I sit and cry
That last long day we spent alone 
I'm yearning for it yet 
She thrilled me, filled me,
with a kind of lovin',
I never will forget, the way she called me sweet daddy"" 
Twas just a beautiful dream
 
I hate to think that it's all over I lost my heart  it seems
I got so used to her somehow
But I'm no body's baby 
Now, gee it's awful when you're lonesome 
and get those lovesick blue-oo-oo-oo-oo's 
 
Got the feeling called the ""blue hoo's,"" 
since my sweetie said ""Good Bye""
Seems I don't know what to ""Do Hoo""
All day long I sit and cry
That last long day we spent alone

Great American String Band,"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone",San Antonio Rose,1991

Great Big Sea,"From the first hello you gave to me I've done nothing else but smile
And I know you're in a hurry, but it's gonna take a while
So forgive me if we go slow, but there's something I think you should know

I'm going fast as I can, please don't make me rush
This feeling's coming on way too fast
I'll tell you all of the things that you'll never forget
But I'm not ready say, ""I love you"" yet
I'm not ready to say ""I love you"" yet

Don't push me in too deep, I've always been the fool who rushes in
You've got to take the pieces one by one before you've got everything
So forgive me if we go slow but there's something I think you should know

There'll be times when I'm mistaken, there'll be times when we're gonna fight
But you needn't doubt we can work it out and in time we'll get it right
So forgive me if we go slow but there's something I think you should know

Great Big Sea,"It's the end of the world as know, I feel fine

That's great, it starts with an earthquake
Birds, snakes, and aeroplanes
Lenny Bruce is not afraid
Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn
World serves its own needs, dummy serve your own needs
Feed it off an aux speak, grunt, no, strength
Ladder start to clatter with fear, fight down height
Wire in a fire, representing seven games
A government for hire and a combat site
Left of west and coming in a hurry
With the furies breathing down your neck

Team by team reporters baffled, trumped, tethered, cropped
Look at that low playing! Fine, then
Uh oh, overflow, population, common food
But it'll do
Save yourself, serve yourself
World serves its own needs, listen to your heart bleed
Dummy with the rapture and the revered and the right
Right
You vitriolic, patriotic, slam, fight, bright light
Feeling pretty psyched

It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine

Six o'clock, TV hour
Don't get caught in foreign towers
Slash and burn, return
Listen to yourself churn
Locking in, uniforming, book burning, blood letting
Every motive escalate
Automotive incinerate
Light a candle, light a votive
Step down, step down
Watch your heel crush, crushed, uh-oh
This means no fear cavalier
Renegade steer clear!
A tournament, tournament, a tournament of lies
Offer me solutions, offer me alternatives and I decline

It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine

It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine

The other night I dreamt of knives
Continental drift divide
Mountains sit in a line, Leonard Bernstein
Leonid Brezhnev, Lenny Bruce and Lester Bangs
Birthday party, cheesecake, jelly bean, boom!
You symbiotic, patriotic, slam book neck, right?
Right!

Great Big Sea,"Oh the night that Paddy Murphy died, is a night I'll never forget
Some of the boys got loaded drunk, and they ain't got sober yet;
As long as a bottle was passed around every man was feelin' gay
O'Leary came with the bagpipes, some music for to play

[Chorus]
That's how they showed their respect for Paddy Murphy
That's how they showed their honour and their pride;
They said it was a sin and shame and they winked at one another
And every drink in the place was full the night Pat Murphy died

As Mrs. Murphy sat in the corner pouring out her grief
Kelly and his gang came tearing down the street
They went into an empty room and a bottle of whiskey stole
They put the bottle with the corpse to keep that whiskey cold

[Chorus]

About two o'clock in the morning after empty'ing the jug
Doyle rolls up the ice box lid to see poor Paddy's mug
We stopped the clock so Mrs. Murphy couldn't tell the time
And at a quarter after two we argued it was nine

[Chorus]

They stopped the hearse on George Street outside Sundance Saloon
They all went in at half past eight and staggered out at noon
They went up to the graveyard, so holy and sublime
Found out when they got there, they'd left the corpse behind!

Oh the night that Paddy Murphy died, is a night I'll never forget

Great Big Sea,"I drank sixteen doubles for the price of one
Trying to find the courage to talk to one
I asked her for a dance
Not a second glance
My night had just begun

Well I drink to the father and the holy ghost
I'm kneeling at the alter of my nightly post
So I'll raise a glass, not the first nor last
Come join me in this toast

[Chorus:]
Because the old black rum's got a hold on me
Like a dog wrapped round my leg
And the old black rum's got a hold on me
Will I live for another day?
Hey, Will I live for another day?

Well the queen of George street just went walking on by
Walking on by with some guy who don't care
That she stood in line
Since half past nine
And spent three hours on her hair (On her hair!)

Well her friend is looking at me with an evil grin
I think the bloody racket might soon begin
I must have said some thing
To the George street queen
The boys are joining in!

[Chorus:]

So I drank all of my money
And I slept out in the rain
Everyday is different but the nights they're all the same

I look into your eyes and I realize

Oh no, I can't stop falling
My heart betrays me
And I know, I'll start to feel it all again
Won't someone save me?

She jumped aboard the brown line, I accidentally caught her eye
She told me she was born a Libra, and I told her I was Gemini
She made suggestive conversation, then she lightly brushed my hand

And in the English night, oh I realize it again

Oh no, I can't stop falling
My heart betrays me
And I know, I'll start to feel it all again

I wonder if I should, but her touch, her touch, it feels so good.

Roll me over next to the wall

Now, my dear good man, she said
Do not be perplexed
Before that you might bed with me
You must answer questions six.
Six questions you must answer me,
And I will ask them all
And you and I in the bed might lie
Roll me over next to the wall

And higher than the trees?
And what is worse than a woman's curse,
And what is deeper than the sea?

Where does the dew first fall
And you and I in a bed might lie
Roll me over next to the wall
Roll me over next to the wall

And heaven is higher than the trees,
The devil curse is worse than a woman's curse,
And hell in deeper than the sea

Driven by the strangers' will

But when it comes to ladies, I've had the best of luck.

My first one was a sly one, hanging round the rink,
But they sent me off to Cornwall, as fast as you could blink,
In Moose Jaw I was right in love, the daughter of the coach -
He traded me for nothing, didn't take to my approach.

So good-bye, fare thee well,
There's no time for delay,
You'll see me at the face-off, or catch the play-by-play
So good-bye, fare thee well,
I'm glad you shared my bed,
But never trust a fellow with a helmet on his head.

Chantal was from Moncton, elle a jouer avec moi.
A tongue as sharp as razors, but she had a fancy car.
Her husband was a bruiser, played senior in Quebec,
If he'd had the rights of it, it would have been my neck.

Nancy couldn't watch me fight, she'd always be in tears,
Waving from the bleachers, and screaming in my ears,
Dee I should have married, and we had a dandy fling,
But I had a one way contract, blew the money for the ring.

I should have sent a letter, and it would have been polite,
But I'm cleaning out my locker, and time is getting tight.
I'm calling from the station, perhaps another day,
Cause they're calling up a rookie, and they're trading me away.",Helmethead,2004

Your eyes, they look so dim,
Have you had any sore sickness,
Or yet been sleeping with a man?

No I haven't had any sore sickness,
But I know what's ailing me,
I am thinking of my own true love
Who ploughs the raging sea.

Is he a Lord or a Duke or a knight
Or a man of wealth and fame?
Or is he one of our sailor lads
Come tell me now his name.

He is no Lord nor Duke nor knight
Nor a man of wealth or fame.
He is one of your sailor lads
John Barbour is his name.

Now if John Barbour is his name,
A lowly sailor man is he,
If John Barbour is his name,
Then hanged he shall be.

Then he called his sailors all
By one, by two, by three
John Barbour was the first he called
But the last came down was he.

When he came a dancing down,
He was clothed all in white
His cheeks were like the roses red
And his teeth were ivory bright.

He paid their wages with a smile
And to John Barbour he did say
If I was a woman as I am a man
My bed fellow you would be.

And will you marry my daughter Jane?
And take her by the hand
And will you come and dine with me
Take charge of all my lands.

Yes I will marry your daughter Jane
And take her by the hand
And I will come and dine with you,
But to hell with all your land.

For if you can give her one gold piece,
Then I can give her three.
For they call me young John Barbour
And I plough the raging sea.",John Barbour,2004

Me old man said to me
You can spend your life, your jolly life
Just sailing on the sea
You can search the world for pretty girls
Til your eyes are weak and dim
But don't go searching for a mermaid, son
If you don't know how to swim

'Cause her hair was green as seaweed
Her skin was blue and pale
Her face it was a work of art
I love that girl with all my heart
But I only like the upper part
I did not like the tail

I signed onto a sailing ship
My very first day at sea
I seen a mermaid in the waves
A-reaching out to me
Come live with me in the sea, said she
Down on the ocean floor
And I'll show you a million wondrous things
You've never seen before

So over I jumped and she pulled me down
Down to her seaweed bed
And a pillow made of a tortoise shell
She placed beneath my head
She fed me shrimp and caviar
Upon a silver dish
From her head to her waist
It was just my taste
But the rest of her was a fish

'Cause her hair was green as seaweed
Her skin was blue and pale
Her face it was a work of art
I love that girl with all my heart
But I only like the upper part
I did not like the tail

But then one day she swam away
So I sang to the clams and the whales
Oh, how I miss her seaweed hair
And the silver shine of her scales
But then her sister, she swam by
Set my heart awhirl
'Cause her upper part was an ugly fish
But her bottom part was a girl

Yes her hair was green as seaweed
Her skin was blue and pale
Her legs they are a work of art

When I gave myself over to it
Learned every step and my efforts were met
When it rain and it told and it sang

If the line is a chain past today
Then each fielder I played is another that stayed
To turn himself into the link
And he’s still up here somewhere I think

And I hear the old voices singing
This song will never land
It was here long ago and continues to grow
In the fields of progeny

Where is the culture you ask? I don’t know
And when is the future you ask? I don’t know

Is it locked in the ice?
Is it under the frost?

But it’s under the snow I suppose

And where is the history?
And where is the memory?
Where is the language that I used to know?

And at the fight my words were strong
But I would not have the magic that they’d stop making patterns
It’s caps of white, raised and broke I fasten to the boat

The panic overtook me and the fear I held within
I drew a breath and I tried to find the courage
To stand the troubled trip. What have I gotten myself into?
I silently wondered, I silently asked

I thought of my family and thought of my love
I thought of my maker and what might be above
And the cabin in the woods that I have not yet build
Many other things that I hold dear in this world

I rode through the turmoil and rode through the strife
I held to my words and I clumped to my life
And then when my vision began to blur
This is what I saw in the thought that had occur

I saw every fish swimming fast beside me
And all kinds of leafs from all different trees
And all of the insects that circle on the earth
Birds and land animals are reaching towards birth

And I saw my body on a body of water
And I could see that we were the same
Roaring and reckless, invulnerable
Emotion and swinging and predisposed to changing

When I open my eyes vision respell 
I picked up my words and I kissed the condense
With stronger arms I silently swear
I silently drifted, I silently wept",On the Water,2012

The lift within the eyes, with gravity defied, I can tell it’s no good
See what you can find to satisfy your mind in the name I heard
How can they be so gone? And they’ve been here so long, living all of this

Too many ways to slowly die
How may shadows fade across a wall

From distances it's glistening
Like El Dorado's halls

High above these streets of fire
Fly lonely angel
Far away from mad desire

And fragrant nights
But how were you to know
The streets are hard
They're mean and scared
Where only fools find gold

Navigating by your fears

A way to find your isles of love

Someone told me there's a girl out there with love in her eyes and flowers in her hair.
Took my chances on a big jet plane, never let them tell you that they're all the same.
The sea was red and the sky was grey, wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today.
The mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake
as the children of the sun began to awake.

Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow;
I think I might be sinking.
Throw me a line if I reach it in time

Runs straight and high.

They say she plays guitar and cries and sings... la la la

Your stairway lies on the whispering wind.
And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul.
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold.

From Kegger's Den to Hooterville
My flaming tricks have topped the bill
A thousand empty bottles earn my name
Endless trains of one night stands
Sharing gigs with half-assed bands
And all the local groupies lay the same

Well I could have had a payin' job
Workin' for some fucked-up slob
Wife and family, true security
But I left that shit behind
For that heavy metal grind
'Cause rock'n roll is in my blood to stay

The long awaited rains
Have fallen hard upon the thirsty ground
And carved their way to where
The wild and rushing river can be found
And like the rains
I have been carried to where the river flows, yeah
My heart is racing, and my feet are weak
As I walk to the edge
I know there is no turning back
Once my feet have left the ledge
And in the rush I hear a voice
That's telling me to take a leap of faith
So here I go

[Chorus]
I'm diving in, I'm going deep, in over my head I want to be
Caught in the rush, lost in the flow, in over my head I want to go
The river's deep, the river's wide, the river's water is alive
So sink or swim, I'm diving in

There is a supernatural power
In this mighty river's flow
It can bring the dead to life
And it can fill an empty soul
And give a heart the only thing
Worth living and worth dying for, yeah
But we will never know the awesome power
Of the grace of God
Until we let ourselves get swept away
Into this holy flood
So if you take my hand
We'll close our eyes and count to three
And take the leap of faith

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Greater Vision,"I dreamed my life was done. I stood before god's son. 
It was time to see what my reward would be
With love he reviewed my life to count what was done for christ.
For that is what will last eternally

See I'd done my best to share that Jesus really cares
And he would save if they just believe
Oh, but seldom did harvest come and so few did I see won
Until the lord said, ""turn around and see.""

Then he showed me the faces of the ones who'd come because of me.
So many faces that my life had led to Calvary
All those years I thought nobody saw as I labored in lowly places
That's when Jesus smiled and showed me all the faces.

He said though you did not see the yield, you were faithful to plow the field
At other times you helped me plant the seed
No matter how small the task, you did just as I asked
And thanks to you these souls have been set free.


And for those years you thought nobody saw as you labored in lowly places
One day he'll smile and show you all the faces.

Ich hab so oft geschwänzt und war nie richtig im Unterricht
Doch wenn ich mal da war, war ich der, der die Stunde unterbricht

Kennst du die Lehrer, die ständig unter ihrem Arm schwitzen

Und jedes Mal kam sie mit irgendwelchen Formeln an
Als ob man sich damit irgendwas zum Essen besorgen kann

They notice fast
And some mistakes were built to last

That's what you get

That's what you get for changing your mind

I saw you standing there
Outside the 7-11
Don't care where you sleep
Gonna pass out where you are

I'm burned out on politics
Slimeball, you make me sick
Dead head, get over it
I'm already gone-

Just like on my tv
Don't care where you sleep
Don't stand a chance with me

They call it good, Making no mistakes
And dye it black, she's a TV man
Pick him up and take him away

Vision heady
I do not have the strength to pick it up,
Walk away

Reach right in
And see if you can touch him
Oh God no-the multi-color coded
Screen is there
So your hands can touch it
All alone, she's a TV Man

Pick him up and take him away
Vision heady
I do not have the strength to pick it up,
Walk away

She's gonna have a good day
She don't care about the weather
She's gonna have a good day
She don't care about whatever
The reception's fine by me

She tune it in and
Turns her head around
Frame by frame
She can't find her favorite station
She shut her eyes and laces them together
All alone, she's a TV man

Vision heady
I do not have the strength to pick it up,
Walk away

Must be kind of unusual, not fair falling short of denial

Cold beer and blue martinis-""in the sand's the lounge is lovely""
I'll be golden, someday sugar

If I can only get head
I'd go to bed

Sleep don't come easy when you're stuck-
In such a sickly paradice
I think that I could use it
Sleep don't come easy when you're rolling bone's
With funny eyes
I think that I could lose it

White suit of diamonds, holding a royal pain
I believe in nenemies lie nenemies
Believe in me
Closer I'm sinking, memories pulling me like-
Soda pop and sour cream hop scotch
To the liquor
Standin', under sea of neon
If I can only get ahead
I'd go to bed

You are the one I need
Up at your window
I see a shadow
Silhouette of your grace
Here's this flower
I picked for all the hours
That you've spent with me
The one I love
That I've been dreaming of
Sailing across the sea

Let my hands flow through
Your hair, moving closer
A kiss we'll share
Passionate love to be all night long
We'll never break, as one too strong

Nothing's more
Than what our love is for
As I kiss your cheek
Oh so softly
Hands flowing down my back
One thousand hours, I'll never leave
Our romance
Is a love trance
And now we'll never part
One thousand hours
Of such a love shower
We'll never stop once we start

Let my hands flow through
Your hair, moving closer
A kiss we'll share
Passionate love to be all night long

I always wish I was there

Ask my self why they've had to change

The clouds have fallen; here comes the rain

As for me I am blind without a cause
And now I realized what I have lost

It was something real that I could have had
Now I play the fool whose stable soul's gone bad

And no one can touch you?
Well I think you're disposable
And it's time you knew the truth
Cause it's just one of my lies!

Why does my life have to be so small?
Yet death is forever
And does forever have a life to call its own?

Don't give me an answer cause you
Only know as much as I know

Down the hatch and a bad attitude.
Salud.

Wasting time down a bum fuck road.
And I don't know where the hell it'll go.
Heirlooms and huffing fumes,
And I'm picking up the pace
And I'm gonna smash straight into a wall.

All the time.
A ""New Year's Resolution""
How soon that we forget.
Doing time.
Loving every minute.
Live it up on another let down.
Salud.

Promises, promises, it was all set in stone,
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Sugar fix, dirty tricks and a trick question.
Guess I should have read between the lines.
Having the time of my life, watching the clock tick.

All the time, where did all the time go?
It's too late to say goodnight.
Time flies when you're having fun.
Time's up when you work like a dog.

I used to listen to Lauryn Hill, and tap my feet
Then the bitch put out a CD and didn't have no beats
That nigga D'Angelo, he determined not to fail
That nigga went butt-ass, for his record to sell
My back shot to help Ashanti hit them high notes
And Big Ben taught Charlie B 'More to deep throat (yea)

Look out at the setting sun
Brink of your vision
Eternal youth
Is the landscape of a lie

The cracks of my skin can prove
As the years will testify
Say your prayers and light a fire
We're going to start a war
Your slogans a gun for hire
It's what we waited for

Hey Gloria

This is why we're on the edge
The fight of our lives been drawn to
This undying love

Gloria, viva la Gloria
You blast your name
In graffiti on the walls
Falling in broken glass and
Slashing through these spirits
I can hear it like a jilted crowd

Gloria, where are you Gloria?
You found a home
In all your scars and ammunition
You made your bed in salad days
Amongst the ruins
Ashes to ashes of our youth

She smashed her knuckles into winter
As autumns wind fades into black
She is the saint of all the sinners
The one that's fallen through the cracks
So don't put away, your burning light

Gloria, where are you are Gloria
Don't lose your faith
To you lost naivety
Weather the storm and don't look
Back on last November
When your banners were burning down

Gloria, viva la Gloria
Send me your amnesty down
To the broken hearted
Bring us the season
That we always will remember
Don't let the bonfires go out

The light that shadows in the night.

My debt to the status quo
The scars on my hands there a means to an end
Is all that I have to show

I swallowed my pride and choked on my faith
I've given my heart and my soul
I've broken my fingers and I've lied through my teeth
The pillar of damage control

I've been to the edge
And I've thrown the bouquet of flowers left over the grave

Baby, babe, you're the light
And the flame burns in my mind's eye

When triumph bleeds into bliss
And I knew it from the first kiss

What's your pleasure and what is your pain?
Do you dream too much?
Do you think what you need is a crutch

And the deaf-mute's misleading the choir

At first I thought that I pissed the bed
Honest stories in the midnight hour
The kiss of death on the Eiffel Tower

And I went down
Like the speed of sound
You're out of sight

I had a dream that I kissed your lips and it felt so true
Then I woke up as a nervous wreck and I fell for you
I'll spend the night living in denial
Making paper planes just for a while
I'll crash into you, crash into you
If you crash in my imagination too

Break a leg and you crush my heart
I'm a mess and you're a work of art
Got your blessings going 0 to 5
Steal a kiss and I took a dive

And I went down

And I, I may tell you, a tale.
A tale of three, little pigs,
And a big, bad, wolf.

Well the first little piggy, well he was kinda hip.
He spent most of his days, just a dreaming of the city.
And then one day, he bought a guitar.
He moved to Hollywood, to become a star.
But, living on the farm, he knew nothing of the city.
Built his house out of straw, what a pity.
And then one day, jamming on some chords,
Along came the wolf, knocking on his door.

Little Pig, Little Pig, let me in.
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin!
Little Pig, little pig, let me in.
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin!

Huffing, puffin, blow your house in.
Huffing, puffin, blow your house in.
Huffing and a puffin and I'll blow your house in!

Well the second little piggy, well he was kinda stoked.
He spent most of his time just a ganga smoking.
Huffing and a puffin down on Venice Beach.
Getting paid money for religious speech.
He built his shelter from what he garbage picked.
Mostly made up of old cans and sticks.
Then one day he was cranking out Bob Marley,
And along came the Wolf on his big bad Harley.

Little Pig, Little Pig, let me in.
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin!

Well the third little piggy, the grade A student.
His daddy was a rock star, named Pig Nugent.
Earned his Masters Degree, from Harvard College.
Built his house from his architect knowledge.
A tri-level mansion, Hollywood Hills.
Daddy's rock stardom, paid for the bills.
And then one day came the old house smasher
The big bad wolf, the little piggy slasher.

Little Pig, Little Pig, let me in.
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin!

Well the big bad Wolf,
Well he huffed, and he puffed, all that he could.
And low and behold the little piggy's house stood.
""It's made out of concrete!""  The little piggy shouted.
The wolf just frowned, as he pouted.
So they called nine-eleven, like any piggy would.
The sent out Rambo, just as fast, as they could.

""Yo, wolf-face, I'm your worst nightmare, your ass is mine!""

Well the wolf fell dead as you can plainly see.
That's to end the story, for you and me.

Peace, how you?
I ain't mean to be late, it was my night to watch my little girl.
It's chilly out here.
What happened, you crying?
Y'all got into it again, huh?
See you gotta let em know, from the jump, I don't care who they are, or who they with.
Yeah, I know they know we talking.
Why don't they just leave us alone?
I know it's hard for them to understand people like us can love each other.
Come on, stop cryin' now.
Oh, there's something I gotta tell you, I heard they watching you, yeah they watching you.
They watching me too.
But there ain't no reason to get low, I'm proud, I'm here.
You know, I'ma stand up for you, no matter what; and I know you'll stand up for me.
I don't have no doubt about you being true to me.
The world is ours, but right now i feel like the whole world is against us.

Looking for horny toads
With the sun on my back
Thinking about people past
Memories that never last
When you're young and naive

Chorus

Time ain't nothing
When you're young at heart
And your soul still burns
I've seen rainy days
Sunshine that never fades
All through the night

Had a motorcycle at 10
Never got into heroin
I guess I want to live
Maybe get a house someday
Find a wife raise a family
That don't mean you have to die

Chorus",Time Ain't Nothing,1985
Green on Red,"Got a tape of an old forgotten song
It was sad and mournful, how the past can't be undone
Singer sounded like Dylan through an old broke radio
Cryin about a woman whose heart had turned cold


And I wander through the night the melody holds me tight
And whispers I'm not alone


In the kitchen cupboard theres family recipes
For love and kindness the precious things you need
We rely on these things through trials and tribulations
When you feel like going out and buyin a gun

And I wander through the days the melody keeps me safe
And whispers I'm not alone

And I'm not going to believe in your lies anymore
I've got my dreams, you've got yours

Count your blessings on your toes 
Maybe your fingers will find someone to hold
Don't be stubborn like some ole fool
The future's not bleak dreams will come true

And I wander through these days the melody keeps me sane
No reason to run and hide with some fake disguise
So if your looking for someone who don't give a damn
Well I think you've found your man

We've got all we need
And I don't mean to make you feel
Dependent on me

But for everyone there comes a day
When you need some help along your way
When that moment comes

I'll be you angel when the going gets rough
(When your best ain't enough)
I'll be by your side
(All else has been tried)

And I ain't giving up
(You can't give up)
Not on this love
(You still got my love)
I'll be your angel

There's no doubt in my mind
Why I'm alive
'Cause I feel heaven-sent
When I look in your eyes

Well, this old world will drag you down
Tie your spirit to the ground
But if you call on me

I'll be you angel when the going gets rough
(When your best ain't enough)
I'll be by your side

Any foolish thing to call on your affection
Any foolish thing to show how much I care
Any foolish thing that we say might come about
Don't take it lightly, girl, 'cause it could just work out
That this love won't be any foolish thing

Forgive me if I'm sounding too sincere
But I can't take chances, you might slip away
While I wait for the right time
And place to say

Any foolish thing to call on your affection
Any foolish thing to show how much I care
Any foolish thing that we say might just come true
Don't take it lightly, girl, I'd bet it all on you
And that this love won't be any foolish thing

Could turn you away, can lead you astray

Anything I say might make you see

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables

The beauty that is Spring's

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

These things are dear to me

Living for you my dear
Is like living in a world of constant fear
In my plea, I've got to make you see
That our love is dying

Somehow I must explain
I'm gonna rap on your door
Tap on your window pane
I'm gonna camp on your step

Ironed up a pearl snap

Try to get a little bit better at some of these bad things I do.
But the night it is young; so am I for a while,
So I put on my hat and coat and pants and my boots and smile.
And I'm a gonna go

Downtown, downtown tonight,
I'm a gonna go all around the town, check out all the sights,
I will be back in the mornin', feelin' bad or good,
Well, I do what I want, and I don't do what I should.

Well, some people tell me that they love the mountains best,
Far as I can see it's just one big wilderness.
I've seen squirrels writin' tickets, dolphins drivin' cars,
Blowfish blowin' tubas, grizzly bears in the bars.
And I'm a gonna go

[Chorus]

Well now if you've ever checked it out, you know just what I mean,
There's always a few surprises in that same old scene.
You might meet some fella who can really blow the horn,
Make you glad for a change you done got born.
Don't ya wanna go

[Chorus]

Yes, I might get lucky, run into my friend, Jane,
Walk to her apartment in the shiny city rain.
Put on a little record; I get so long and tall,
I wish I was the wallpaper; Jane could be the wall.
And I'm a gonna go

[Chorus]

Yeah and when those lights come up, so soon, so soon,
We might sit and play some music in that trashed-out livin' room.
Keep playin' that music 'til the dawn's early light,
Laugh like no one's business,
Man ain't that the life.
And I'm a gonna go

[Chorus]

Have you ever known the magic hour just before the dawn?
When the mornin' is still sleeping, but the night is not yet gone.

With the moon and stars and the bells and birds all ringin' up above.
Don't ya wanna go

I get to thinking our
Love's a polished stone
You give me a long drawn look
I know pretty soon
You're gonna leave our home
And of course I mind
Especially when I'm
Thinking from my heart
But life don't clickety-clack
Down a straight-line track
It comes together and it comes apart
You say you hope I'm not the kind
To make you feel obliged
To go ticking through your time
With a pained look in your eyes
You give me the furniture
Well divide the photographs
Go out to dinner one more time
Have ourselves a bottle of wine
And a couple of laughs


When first you left I stayed so sad
I wouldn't sleep
I know love's a gift
I thought yours was mine
And something
That I could keep
Now I realize
Time is not the only compromise 
A bird in the hand
Could be an all-night stand
Between a blazing fire
And a pocket of skies 
So I hope I'm not the kind
To make you feel obliged
To go ticking through your time
With a pained look in your eyes 
I covered the furniture
I framed the photographs
Went out to dinner one more time
Had myself a bottle of wine
And a couple of laughs 
Just the other day
I got your letter in the mail
I'm happy for you
It's been so long
You've been wanting
A cabin and a backwoods trail
And I think that's great
Me I seem to find myself in school
It's all okay
I just want to say
I'm so relieved
We didn't do it cruel


But ain't life a brook
Just when I get to
Feeling like a polished stone
I get me a long drawn look
It's kind of a drag
To find yourself alone
And sometimes I mind
Especially when I'm
Waiting on your heart
But life don't clickety-clack
Down a straight-line track
It comes together
And it comes apart
'Cause I know you're not the kind
To make me feel obliged
To go ticking through my time

When I was fast asleep.
She threw her arms around my neck
And she began to weep.

Could someday beat as one
But then the third heart came along
And now our love is gone

Counting dreams that never will come true

Subtract one love, and multiply the heartaches
Divide the tears by every time a heart breaks
The answer only tells us that it's too late
Subtract one love, and multiply the heartache

Subtract one love, and multiply the heartaches
Divide the tears by every time a heart breaks
The answer only tells us that it's too late
Subtract one love, and multiply the heartaches
Subtract one love, and multiply the heartaches

Greg Cahill,"I've seen the world, been to many places
Made lots of friends, many different races
I've had such fun around the world it's true
African skies with a Nairobi mood
I fell asleep in Tuscany and dreamed
The one thing missing was you

Runaway with me my love,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Runaway with me my love,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I woke up with an Australian breeze
And danced the dance with Aborigines
Oh under the moon glow down in Mexico I dreamed
One thing was missing that's you

Runaway with me my love,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Runaway with me my love,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

We'll sail the waters of many colors
We won't need a compass, love will guide our way
Don't need nobody, as long as we got each other
No need to hurry, we've got everyday
I wanna share the world with you, you see
Spring time in Paris feels so good to me
Oh this is for me reality
So please make all my wishes come true

Runaway with me my love,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

And I just know we'll have a good time
And I just know we'll have a good time",Runaway,1992

From the mountains down to the sea
You've become such a habit with me

Well I come from, down around Tennessee
But the people in California
Are nice to me, America
It don't matter where I may roam

Promise and then follow through, America

And the men who fell on the plains
And lived, through hardship and pain

In a war that didn't seem right

Greg Castigliono,"Could be?
Who Knows?
There's something due any day
I will know, right away
Soon as it shows
It may come connanballing down
Through the sky
Gleam in its eye, bright as rose
Who knows?
It's only just out of reach
Down the block, on a beach
under a tree
I got a feeling there's a miracle due
Gonna come true, comin' to me
Could it be, yes it could
Something's comin', something good
If I can wait
Something's comin'
I don't know what it is
But it is gonna be great
With a click, with a shock
Phone'll jingle, door will knock
Open the latch
Something's comin'
Don't know when
But it's soon
Catch the moon
One handed catch
Around the corner
Or whistlin' down the river
Come on, deliver to me
Will it be, yes it will
Maybe just by holding still
It'll be there
Come on, something
Come on in
Don't be shy
Meet a guy
Pull up a chair
The air is humming
And something great is coming
Who knows?
It's only just out of reach
Down the block, on a beach
Maybe tonight
Maybe tonight
Maybe tonight!",Something's Coming,2007
Greg Castigliono,"There's a place for us, somewhere a place for us
Peace and quiet and open air, wait for us somewhere

There's a time for us, someday a time for us
Time together with time to spare, time to learn, time to care

Someday, somewhere, we'll find a new way of living
We'll find a way of forgiving, somewhere

There's a place for us, a time and place for us
Hold my hand and we're half-way there, hold my hand and I'll take you there

Somehow, someday, somewhere",Somewhere,2007
