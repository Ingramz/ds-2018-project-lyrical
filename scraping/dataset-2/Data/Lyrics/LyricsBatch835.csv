Pepper Adams,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me","Lover, Come Back to Me",2000
Pepper Adams,"Sophisticated lady tryin' to change my ways
Just because you're caught in your social maze
I think it's 'bout time that you realize
Your money and your power's got you mesmerized

Pretty lady, get back
Pretty lady, yea
Sophisticated lady put your blue jeans on
You're anybody's baby when your mama's gone

Educated lady with your college degree
Amazes me why you just can't see
Learned everything from your books on the shelf
But no one ever taught you how to think for yourself

Pretty lady, get back

Sophisticated lady put your blue jeans on

Pepper Adams,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

My love is a prelude that never dies

Pepper Adams,"You're my thrill
You do something to me
You send chills right through me
When I look at you 'cause you're my thrill
You're my thrill
How my pulse increases
I just go to pieces
Every time I look at you I can't keep still
Hm
Nothing seems to matter
Hm
Here's my heart on a silver platter
Oh where's my will
Why this strange desire

Flaming higher and higher

I can't keep still
You're my thrill",You're My Thrill,2017
Pepper Adams Quintet,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,1957
Pepper Adams Quintet,"Unforgettable
That's what you are
Unforgettable
Tho' near or far
Like a song of love that clings to me
How the thought of you does things to me
Never before has someone been more
Unforgettable in every way
And forever more, that's how you'll stay
That's why darling it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am unforgettable too",Unforgettable,1957

Pepper Rabbit,"We both sat, on our beds, in my room
And we talked about what was coming soon
All the pink powder won't cover up what we did
Doing wrong when, we were just kids

And I think that you're the older brother
That I never had
I wish I could reach out and touch you
Don't worry, I'm not sad
I know you're just where you want to be
And everyone's a hundred grand
Save some space for me
And say hello to your dad

I will look after your sister I swear
I'll write her when she's lonely, and send it off in the air
I will keep her safe, until I'm dead
She'll always have a place to rest her head
You don't have to worry about it now
You don't have to live with that frown
I will hold your memory close to my chest
Though I wish you hadn't said it was best
Could you have stayed just one more night
For all of us to say goodbye
But all of your troubles are now gone
And you still feel so damn warm

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh",Older Brother,2010
Pepper Williams,"You and I in this moment,
Holding the night so close,
Hanging on, still unbroken 
while outside the thunder rolls.
Listen now you can her my heart beat
warm against life's bitter cold.
 
These are the days. 
the sweetest days we'll know.
 
There are times that scare me.
We'll rattle the house like the wind,
both of us so unbending.
We battle the fear within.
All the while life is rushing by us.
Hold it now and don't let go.
 
These are the days. 
the sweetest days we'll know.
 
So, we'll whisper a dream here in the darkness.
Watching the stars till their gone.
And when even the mem'ries have all faded away,
these days go on and on.
 
Listen now, you can hear my heartbeat.
Hold me now and don't let go.
(These are the days,)
ev'ry day is the sweetest day we'll know.

Pepper Williams,"It's late in the evening; she's wondering what clothes to wear
She puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair
And then she asks me, Do I look all right?
And I say, ""Yes, you look wonderful tonight

We go to a party and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady that's walking around with me
And then she asks me, Do you feel all right?
And I say, ""Yes, I feel wonderful tonight""

I feel wonderful because I see
The love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize how much I love you

It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head
So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed
And then I tell her, as I turn out the light
I say, ""My darling, you were wonderful tonight
Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight",Wonderful Tonight,2000

You know 'em Tuesday's rain
Well, the days go by me
Like a southbound train
Yes, it's funny thinking
You will never call my name
Here comes long lonely
Here comes the blues
Well, the world's the same old comedy

You know my time is cold
Nothing new, blue lady
I won't get old
Cause the deal is gone now
I'd just better hold
Here comes long lonely
Here comes the blues
Well, sun has run down
She has gone out to hide
Yes, and now I'm out walking
Where the midnight ride
Just me and the good-time Charlies

And the suicide
Here comes long lonely

He reads the anger at your face
Torture by the heat with
With picture rushing through his veins

We talk so severed daze
And countless passive ways
Must he bend his knees?
Or can't he really be free? free? free?

The bell rings at the school
And saw his children take their place
Teach them by the rule
That no one hates them honest face

Or just outside that room
And ask for a ghetto broom
And child is born to see
That he might never be free, free, free

Could he and I make us friends truly?
Or is the song that were really just a lie to me?
The fact that nothing's being done as a circumstance
The time is short and we may never get a chance
Uh-huh, a chance, uh-huh

And sparrows teach their young to fly

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1995

On this, our weddin' day
Do not forsake me, oh my darlin'
Wait, wait along

I do not know what fate awaits me
I only know I must be brave
And I must face a man who hates me
Or lie a coward, a craven coward
Or lie a coward in my grave

Oh, to be torn 'twixt love and duty
S'posin' I lose my fair-haired beauty
Look at that big hand move along
Nearin' high noon

He made a vow while in state prison
Vowed it would be my life or his'n
I'm not afraid of death but oh
What will I do if you leave me?

Do not forsake me, oh my darlin'
You made that promise as a bride
Do not forsake me, oh my darlin'

Percee P,"Yo, my metaphor, my musical madness
Move and motivate those with musical talents, uhh
Read it in bold print, we holdin' it down
Lick a shot, hip-hop when we in yo' town
Uhh, master blaster sound
Freak the future far from here and now
With style, release increase the peace, uhh
Bubble with the beat 'til they feelin' the heat in the streets
Now each one, teach one, reach one, young gun
On one, listen to the warrior's drum
Beatin' up the block with the ghetto hop that knock
And make you want to crash the spot
And unlock explode (boom) the alpha and omega code
With drum rolls and old soul, we uphold
And foretold to scores of six years ago
Fast flow from g. rap to cool moe
Supasyllable, major to the minimal
Every individual, bounce to the tempo yo
Lungs collapse and raps be trapped in
The only way to make it happen, jaw-jappin', fast rappin'

Yo, I'm the hot dog that run the hottest monologue
In star poetic inserts and yes y'all s
My speech is like holding two glocks apiece
The outreach that rock police
The super adventure men portend to put somethin' in bitches
Win when we write, the Emmy winner get hyped, off any printer
And I came to get it (hit it)
Like operation push, operate the tush
Black octopus of soul, in inter-planetary patrol
I planted my gold, and low and behold
It's the brother doc, ready to rock-rock
Don't stop hobbes, I known like the lumberjack chop chop
The wordsmith, I write in block letters of cursive
Curse my circus, serve this surface
And watch how the brother fet over
The fly Casanova with the frankincense odor

Bear witness
To where riches'll make career bitches share pictures
When the ears get this ya brainses software'll glitches
Splatter your brains
Leave scattered remains of matter and stains
That'll explain how you was battled and slain
I get rude and go, to your show and use a row
Of fans to boo and throw you off 'til you lose your flow
A pro mean like joe greene when I blow theme
Put your whole team on pause like cold cream
Then show laughter when I flow faster, your hoe haveta
Go after her weave from the breeze when I blow past ya
I'm dapper plus ghetto and just pedal
When the dust settles we left in the rubble the crushed metal
Nurses with hearses sealin' conversed with lit purses
Spit fire, make you first to bit, try me
Like Osama, odoma', I'ma cause trauma
And homicides when I collide I get kamikaze

Kane baby, walk hard, the p-jects
On streets of Brooklyn I'm a crew of d-cepts
On streets of l.a. I'm a whole e-set
On tracks with Jurassic I be the T-Rex
Still that Gucci dressin', still that coochie pressin'
My pimp game smooth be-gets 'em
I don't use discretion; cop tends to be stressin'
Fuck explainin' it, who's he testin'?
Finsta perform all physical forms
Leave your ass shakin' like a Mystikal song
Please dumb, what type of shit was you on?
Cause man to compress a nigga mean one less a nigga (uh-huh)
All I want is my niggaz all recruitin' a slimmy
All I want is my liver all polluted with remi
Duel with any, bring it, I face-off
Son you out your league like Jordan was with baseball

Yeahhh, your majesty, word flash photography
Third class economy, blade slashed your artery
Nerve gassed anatomy, blurred past dramatically
Herbs hashed, my word splash packed agility
Never predictability
Maneuvers of mind fully designed cause I'm true to the rhyme
We do the sublime, crackin' yo' backbone
Attackin' you wack clones
Vernacular right and exact, capital rap zone
That come back verbal assault rifle (ahhhhh)
We fight like Stokely Carmichael
Nope! we just like you
We broke and ain't no tellin' what we might do
Ain't no joke
Provoke the right to reverse to seek mercy
With the king Asiatic and Percy P
Ain't heard the worst of me, until your chest 3-d
Spit venom and burn your body like a std

Put a twenty on the next brother steppin' to me wrong
I mess around a lick cause you done cheat on my theme song
This might seem wrong, but this is a mean song
Crushed like king-kong, and just like ping-pong
Back and forth, I spit knowl' and toss, it's time to floss
My verbal affirmation is to always go off
When syllables slide you'll be enjoyin' the vibe
When consider it pride, it's J5
When another deadly medley, camera action yo we heavy
Aim steady slash machette Maserati engine ready
Good and plenty don't be petty count the fetti and we jetti
Off to another city where we do our nitty grity
We wild like Serengeti, tear it down let's seek and set it
Get ready, for the ride, verbally hand-glide
Write and stay tight, mission's in sight
Murderer worldwide the stage is yo' knife",A Day at the Races,2002
Percee P,"I come on spittin, the song's hittin
Before there were capon chickens different dons listened to me for advice
Like I'm John, niggas just left again, so I'm steppin in
To catch wreck and when on my next kin'll be checks to spend that I'm exitin
Perc' is nice, worth the price, every verse entice
One of the most praised ministers to speak twice on the Earth since Christ
Ideas delay of light years away from what's here
I dare all my peers to slay

Two grand, review and, your whole crew man
The true fans, know who can, bring heat like in the Sudan black
No games, style is fo{?}, verbal cocaine, like propane

Percee P,"Since breast-feeding, my flesh-eating flows had 
The best leading rappers' chests beating, fast
Best dash, leave and lit your head
When I spit it's said like you're being hit with lead
Pipes with spikes that'll rip to shreds
You and your men Jack can sit back
From the impact like I was sitting strapped 
When napalm buried your skin, cat
Infernal heating, so much you run, spitting 
Like I bust a gun, make you suffer from internal bleeding
Raps that kill, drop 'em, play my tracks they're 
Ill like a jacket your cat with a punkish thug acting real
Home gone, skull torn, showin' family mourn throwin' dirt
But the search for the killer still long gone
Attack you, nigga, sneak up from the back and get you with raps
Then slit your throat like they wrote about Jack the Ripper
My dough short, with no thoughts, I let my flows scorch
And burn your whole fort down to the ground like a blowtorch
This mad will gets fans killed in a landfill
Make you stand still, get your head and hands drilled damn real
I aim raps like I aim gats to the head
Where said to make a lame cat's brains splat
Leavin' remains on the train track
I'mma stalk your boys, travel like a Tomahawk
Eat'em so bad, you'll think it's Dahmer's fort the way they find the corpse
And wild lames get migraines like the sun of hot flames
They bought frames tinted or their eye drains
Speakers blow and the beat, it flows
Start reachin' those peeps at shows, making each of my foes decompose
Thoughts of anger, those in my torture chamber, I abort with hangers
Brave men get bitch-smacked
I click-clack, spit fast shit at your six-pack 
Make your ribs crack and cave in (yeah)
This is Percee P, every verse with me's like 
Murder in the First Degree, disperse and flee!

For any entertainer
I got a torture chamber
Torch the flame to scorch and abort the brain
Forcing pain to contort your veins
Make a gelatin of a skeleton to support your frame
Orchestration with adequate manifestation
Panic awaits them in an attic or basement
Ancient bracelets (spikes on the inner perimeter!)
Grab and jab a knife to give him an enema
In a minute or two
Venom is spewed through the lips of a snake that I hit with a rake to aggravate
(Activate the radioactive waste!) to drown a clown in a bath that assassinates
Fascinated with acid
I ate it and hallucinated while I bruised 
And mutilated your Central Nervous System
(Sending nervous victims!)
Through a mechanism that'll, (bend, tend and twist 'em!)
Shred 'em, behead 'em
Before I get 'em I let 'em get a glance at the, two-headed tarantula
Avalanche and an antler to puncture pant legs
Your life span's limited you can't beg
I jam dead corpses
In hand-fed portions
In through the jaws
If a man-bred swordfish
Altered genetically to have big teeth that kill
While the henchmen keep him still!
A secret thrill exists within the mind of a 
Frequent killer skilled at bending rhymes
To the shape of an axe, scrape and attack
No escaping the facts, placed in the vat
Where in the neck is a knife that's black and char-broiled
I slit brains, I got gargoyles to spit flames
Rippin' physical frames and lacing them with spider-bites
Remove your legs and make you ride a bike and blow the dynamite!",Torture Chamber,2005

Beneath the shade of an old walnut tree
Oh, I can still see the flowers blooming 'round her
Where they met on the Isle of Capri

She was as sweet as a rose at the dawning
But somehow fate hadn't meant it to be
And though he sailed with the tide in the morning
Still his heart's in the Isle of Capri

Summertime was nearly over
Blue Italian sky above
He said, lady, I'm a rover
Can you spare a sweet word of love
She whispered softly, it's best not to linger
And then as he kissed her hand he could see
She wore a plain golden ring on her finger
'Twas good-bye on the Isle of Capri

Somewhere far away, over Naples Bay
I heard a quaint lover's story
It's magic thrill holds a spell on me still
It's a story old, that's been sadly told
Down by the shore in the moonlight
How love began for a girl and a man

Like all at once I wake up from something that keeps knocking at my brain
Before I go insane I hold my pillow to my head
And spring up in my bed screaming out the words I dread
I think I love you (I think I love you)

This morning I woke up with this feeling
I didn't know how to deal with and so I just decided to myself
I'd hide it to myself and never talk about it
And did not go and shout it when you walked into the room
I think I love you (I think I love you)

I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say that I never felt this way

I don't know what I'm up against
I don't know what it's all about
I got so much to think about

Hey, I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say I never felt this way

Believe me you really don't have to worry
I only wanna make you happy and if you say ""hey go away"" I will
But I think better still I'd better stay around and love you
Do you think I have a case let me ask you to your face
Do you think you love me?

Maybe the sun's light will be dim
And it won't matter anyhow

Well, it was what I wanted now

I won't be blinded by the light

When love was born 
A face on the pillow 
When early moan 
I still see that golden world 
In all it's splendor

A bluer morning sky above 
And maybe come September 
I will set these wonders 
With my love",Maybe September,1975

I worry and wonder.
Your lips may be near,
but where is your heart?

It's always like this,
I worry and wonder.
You're close to me here,
but where is your heart?

It's a sad thing to realize 
that you've a heart that never melts.
When we kiss, do you close your eyes,
pretending that I'm someone else?

this cloud that I'm under.
So please won't you tell, darling,
where is your heart?

I know but too well what they mean

Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

A heaven of diamonds shine down through the night

Love is now the stardust of yesterday

Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

When I read the things she wrote
She said, we miss you girl
We love you come on home

I had it all right on my back

Away from home, away from home

Where I'm going, where I've been
But there's a dream I've been following so long
If mama knew the things I've done
She'd forgive them everyone
But I'm still five hundred miles away from home

Away from home, away from home
Cold and tired and all alone
Yes, I'm five hundred miles away from home

Can't remember when I ate
it's just thumb and walk and wait

I'd be with them all tonight

With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.

Towering over your head.

And she's gone.

Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.

Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds

With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,

That you and I have finally said goodbye

When we could feel the wheel of life turn our way.

From angels bending near the earth to touch their harps of gold
Peace on the earth, goodwill to men, from heav'n's all gracious king
The world in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels sing.

Still through the cloven skies they come with peaceful wings unfurl
And still their heavenly music floats, O'er all the weary world.
Above its sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wing
And ever o'er its Babel sounds the blessed angels sing.

O ye, beneath life's crushing load, whose forms are bending low
Who toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slow
Look now for glad and golden hours come swiftly on the wing
O rest beside the weary road and hear the angels sing.

For lo the days are hastening on, by prophets seen of old
When with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold
When the new heaven and earth shall own the prince of peace their King
And the whole world send back the song which now the angels sing.

Percy Faith,"On top of old smokey.
On top of old smokey all covered with snow
I lost my true lover for courting too slow
For courting's a pleasure and parting's a grief

And a false hearted lover is worse than a thief
For a thief will just rob you and take all you save
But a false hearted lover will lead you to the grave
And the grave will decay you and turn you to dust

Not one girl in a hundred a poor boy can trust
They'll hug you and kiss you and tell you more lies
Than cross lines on a railroad or stars in the skies
So come all your maidens and listen to me

Never place your affections on a green willow tree
For the leaves they will wither and the roots they will die
You'll all be forsaken and never know why.",On Top of Old Smokey,2013
Percy Faith,"Christmas makes you feel emotional
It may bring parties or thoughts devotional
Whatever happens or what may be,
Here is what Christmas time means to me.

City sidewalk, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style.
In the air there's
A feeling of Christmas.

Children laughing, people passing,
Meeting smile after smile,
And on every street corner you'll hear:

Silver bells, silver bells,
It's Christmas time in the city.
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring,
Soon it will be Christmas day.

City street lights,
Even stop lights,
Blink a bright red and green,
As the shoppers rush home
With their treasures.

Hear the snow crunch,
See the kids bunch,
This is Santa's big scene,
And above all this bustle you'll hear:

Silver bells, silver bells,
It's Christmas time in the city.
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring,
Soon it will be Christmas day.",Silver Bells,2013

Alexander's Ragtime Band
Come on and hear, come on and hear

Like you never heard before
So natural that you want to go to war

That's just the bestest band what am, Honey Lamb

Up to the man, up to the man

Percy Faith,"I tried so hard, my dear, to show that you're my every dream
Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme
A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?

Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do
In anger unkind words are said that make the teardrops start
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?

You'll never know how much it hurts to see you sit and cry
You know you need and want my love yet you're afraid to try
Why do you run and hide from life? To try it just ain't smart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?

There was a time when I believed that you belonged to me

The more I learn to care for you, the more we drift apart

Percy Faith,"One more lonely trail
One more busted guardrail
One more safety net shot to hell

The maps, they are of no use
I'm blind

Your cab speeds away in the rain
But there's a guest that'll soon be showing up again
I recognize her all-too-familiar face
'Cause here comes heartache

Who knows how we got this far
A black leather jacket and a fast car
Wasn't it always written in the stars?
You'd have thought after such a common thing
The books and pills and the distractions
I've have found a way to start

Delivered your good-bye with many a tear
Academy Awards await you, dear
One for the best supporting break
Here comes heartache

It was your movie from the very start
You needed a lead, so I tried out for the part
Forgot all my lines, so I gave you my heart
I got a review that you wrote
Keep it in the pocket of an old coat
What am I supposed with any of this?

The whole thing hits like a tidal wave
The pain, the shame, the fear and the rage
When that wall hits the beach, and we break
Here comes heartache",Here Comes That Heartache Again,2013
Percy Faith,"Got a place in the sun,
A particular one,
On a tropical avenue;
Far away from it all,
That I happily call
The house of singing bamboo.

On the windier days,
Seems an orchestra plays
On a musical breeze for you;
Like a merry salute

From a heavenly flute
To the house of singing bamboo.
So here I'll stay, nevermore to roam,
From my new old-fashioned South Sea home.

You don't have to count sheep,
That's for ""Little Bo Peep""

You can dream any dream,

Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be

Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true.

That's why I seem to have more than my share,

She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,

The plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Over the ground lies a mantle of white
A heaven of diamonds shine down through the night
Two hearts are thrillin'
In spite of the chill in the weather

Love knows no season, love knows no clime
Romance can blossom any old time
Here in the open
We're walkin' and hopin' together
Together, together, together

Sleigh bells ring, are you listening,
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
We're happy tonight,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is a new bird
He's singing a love song,
As we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
Until the other kiddies knock him down.

When it snows, ain't it thrilling,
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Walking in a winter wonderland,
Winter wonder wonder wonderland,
Winter winter wonder wonderland.",Winter Wonderland,1995
Percy Faith & His Orchestra," came upon the midnight clear, that glorious song of old
From angels bending near the earth to touch their harps of gold
Peace on the earth, goodwill to men, from heav'n's all gracious king
The world in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels sing.

Still through the cloven skies they come with peaceful wings unfurl
And still their heavenly music floats, O'er all the weary world.
Above its sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wing
And ever o'er its Babel sounds the blessed angels sing.

O ye, beneath life's crushing load, whose forms are bending low
Who toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slow
Look now for glad and golden hours come swiftly on the wing
O rest beside the weary road and hear the angels sing.

For lo the days are hastening on, by prophets seen of old
When with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold
When the new heaven and earth shall own the prince of peace their King
And the whole world send back the song which now the angels sing.

I sit in my chair

Filled with despair
There's no one, no one
No onecould be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid

Send back my love

Percy Faith & His Orchestra,"When ever we kiss,
I worry and wonder.
Your lips may be near,
but where is your heart?

It's always like this,
I worry and wonder.
You're close to me here,
but where is your heart?

It's a sad thing to realize 
that you've a heart that never melts.
When we kiss, do you close your eyes,
pretending that I'm someone else?

You must break the spell,
this cloud that I'm under.
So please won't you tell, darling,
where is your heart?

Percy Faith & His Orchestra,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2004

Here is my heart, take it and say
We'll never part

Only a slave to you, temptation

Her only answer is one little smile,

When they hold a revival way down south
Everybody with care and trouble that day
Tries to shake it away

Shaking the blues away, unhappy news away
If you are blue, it's easy to
Shake off your cares and troubles

Telling the blues to go, they may refuse to go
But as a rule, they'll go if you'll
Shake them away

Do like the voodoos do, listening to a voodoo melody
They shake their bodies so, to and fro
With every shake, a lucky break

Proving that there's a way to chase your cares away
If you would lose your weary blues
Shake 'em away

Shaking the blues away, unhappy news away
If you are blue, it's easy to
Shake off your cares and troubles

Telling the blues to go, they may refuse to go
But as a rule, they'll go if you'll
Shake them away

Do like the voodoos do, listening to a voodoo melody
They shake their bodies so, to and fro
With every shake, a lucky break

Proving that there's a way to chase your cares away
If you would lose your weary blues
Shake 'em away

Gotta chase those cares away
Just to prove that there's a way
A way to shake shake your blues away",Shaking the Blues Away,2012

Cozy to hide in, to love side-by-side in. Don't let it abide in my dreams.

Just me for you and you for me, alone!

No friends or relations on weekend vacations,
We won't have it known, dear, that we have a telephone, dear.

We will raise a family, a boy for you, a girl for me, 
Oh, can't you see how happy life would be?

You are revealing a plan so appealing I can't help but falling for you,
Darling, I planned it; can't you understand it is yours to command it, so do.

I'd like to wait there for some future date dear;

I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,

Percy Humphrey,"Sometimes when I'm down and all alone
Just like a child without a home
The love you give me keeps me hangin' on
Oh honey,  all I ever need is you
You're my first love, you're my last
You're my future, you're my past
And loving you is all I ask, honey
All I ever need is you
Winters come and they go, and we watch the melting snow
Sure as summer follows spring, all the things you do
Give me a reason to build my world around you
Some men follow rainbows, I am told
Some men search for silver some for gold
I have found my treasure in your soul, honey
All I ever need is you
Without love I'd never find the way
Through ups and downs of every single day
I won't sleep at night until you say, my honey
All I ever need is you",All I Ever Need Is You,1995

Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've need you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand.

I can try to repay
All I've taken from you
Maybe Lord, I can show someone else
What I've been through myself
On my way back to you.

Love that runs away from me
Dreams that just won't let me be
Blues that keeps on bothering me
Chains that just won't set me free

Too far away from you and all your charms
Just out of reach of my two empty arms

Each night in dreams, I see your face
Memories, time cannot erase
And I awake and find you gone
And I'm so blue and all alone

So far away from you, so sweet and warm
Just out of reach of my two empty arms

That lonesome feeling all the time
Knowing that you could not be mine
Dreams that hurt me in my sleep
Vows that we could never keep

Dreams that just won't let me be
Blues that keeps on bothering me
Chains that just won't set me free

Too far away from you and all your charms
Just out of reach of my two empty arms

Each night in dreams, I see your face
Memories, time cannot erase
And I awake and find you gone
And I'm so blue and all alone

So far away from you, so sweet and warm
Just out of reach of my two empty arms

That lonesome feeling all the time
Knowing that you could not be mine
Dreams that hurt me in my sleep
Vows that we could never keep
