Shawn Mendes,"I thought that I've been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life

Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
I'm shaking falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
I'm tripping over myself
Aching begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh you lured me in I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left seeing red on my own

Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
I'm shaking falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
I'm tripping over myself
Aching begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses

And now that I'm without your kisses

Aching begging you to come help (begging baby please)
And now that I'm without your kisses

It's late at night
This is the same old story
Your friends should take your phone away

I always make the same mistakes, yeah
Ooh you give a little taste
Love me and then you take it from me
Oh I hate that I love it
'Cause you're driving me crazy

Shawn Mendes,"Am I asking all these questions for nothing
I'm wondering if anyone's there
And I really need to make a confession
I hate to say that I'm a little bit scared

But I've been on this train too long
People getting off and on
Praying that I don’t forget where I belong
And every time I ask myself

Am I turning into someone else?
I’m praying that I don’t forget just who I am
I really wanna understand
I just wanna understand

I'm callin' all my friends after midnight, yeah
To remind 'em that I'll always be there for them
It gets lonely when there's no one to talk to
But it's good to know that somebody cares

'Cause I've been on this train too long
People gettin' off and on
I'm prayin' that I don't forget where I belong
And every time I ask myself

Am I turnin' into someone else?
I'm prayin' that I don't forget just who I am
I really wanna understand
I just wanna understand

We all get lost sometimes
We don't leave your heart behind (no, yeah)

I really wanna understand oh who I am

When you wake up, your whole world is flipped
Is just different, and you gotta, you know, you gotta
You gotta go with it and
That's just simply growing up
And now I see it in a negative way
You have to see it as it has been giving to you
I mean, as much as time it's gonna be crazy
You're gonna feel like that's where we're supposed to be
You're not gonna feel out of place anymore
You're gonna feel that's where you're meant to be
You don't have to pretend that it's easy all the time
You just let it go and
And grow with it, and you can't hold on
To the old you, or the old this or the old that
Because, you know, you change
And it's not changing in a bad way
It's just changing because that's what happens in life
You grow up, everyone moves on
You're just learning
You stay true to yourself
Changing isn't a bad thing and it never was
But at the end of the day you know, you're the same person
And, and where your heart is, that doesn't change

And every time I ask myself
Am I turning into someone else?
And I just pray to God that I'm still who I am
I really wanna understand
I just gotta understand yeah yeah

Now I just need to, I need to understand
I really wanna understand oh who I am",Understand,2016
Shawn Mendes,"I wanna follow where she goes
I think about her and she knows it
I wanna let her take control
'Cause everytime that she gets close, yeah

She pulls me in enough to keep me guessing
And maybe I should stop and start confessing
Confessing, yeah

The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below; 
Following their footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors 
Of silent desperation, never speakin' to a soul. 
The poison air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dying 
Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain. 
But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes 
Of the clickin' of the turnstiles and the rattle of his chains. 

""Oh!"" she said, ""Casey it's been so long since I've seen you!"" 
""Here"" she said, ""just a kiss to make a body smile!"" 
""See"" she said, ""I've put on new stockings just to please you!"" 
""Lord!"" she said, ""Casey can you only stay a while?"" 

Casey leaves the under-ground and stops inside the Golden Crown 
For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bone. 
Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men 
Who reach for any thing they can to keep from goin' home. 
Standin' in the corner Casey drinks his pint of bitter 
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by 
Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason 
Is the beer that's in his belly, or the tear that's in his eye. 

""Oh!"" she said, ""I suppose you seldom think about me, 
""Now"" she said, ""now that you've a fam'ly of your own"";

Shawn Mullins,"As the lights go down 
The drumming clown 
Whistled a melody 
And as the rain pours down 
His happy face 
Turned into a sad one 
The autumn wind reminded him 
That the circus had come and gone 
So he opened a pack of swisher sweets 
And whistles down the first one 
His clothes are ragged 
And his hat is dusty 
His drum is missing snares 
He maybe laughin' and he may be cryin' 
But no one knows nor cares 
His belly's empty 
But his heart is full 
He knows where he belongs 
So he steps aboard that lovely train 
And he whistles his favorite song 
And as he sleeps 
He dreams of all the pretty girls he's seen throughout his life 
And though his dreams are sweet 
His aching feet 
Awake him in the night 
He wakes to the sound of thunder 
And he thinks of a reason why 
Then he hangs his head to cry 
Then he drifted off to a deeper sleep 
That no one could disturb 
And when he woke 
He was at a place that was higher than the birds 
He said my God I'm here at last 
Is this meant to be 
I've lived the life of a hobo clown 
Whistle tunes for money 
And his Lord spoke up 
And said my friend 
You are not alone 
You've lived a good life my drumming clown 
And now you have a home 
And somewhere a stock boy opens a crate 
And finds the butt of an old cigar 
He hears a distant whistling 
Then he gazes as the stars",Drumming Clown,1996
Shawn Mullins,"She sleeps with the windows open 
Yet she's still locked safe inside 
And to block out the sounds of the city's commotion 
She turns her fan up on high 
Yea she lives just far enough away from home 
To see the whole scene 
And down the street the kids throw sticks and stones 
And end up on the the TV screen 
Yea they throw their sticks and stones 
And end up on the TV screen 
And she used to walk on these gracefully 
But now they crunch beneath her feet 
I guess she must be changin' 
There's just no way to keep it neat 
And her father still barks like a soldier 
Returning from victory 
But now he's much older 
And that bark isn't as scary as it used to be 
Yea she watches his self torture 
No one left to abuse but himself 
But still her memory scorches her 
And she struggles to love herself 
Her memory scorches her 
And she struggles to love herself 
And she used to walk on these gracefully 
But now they crunch beneath her feet 
And I guess she must be changin' 
She never was to good at stayin' in her seat 
And this town grows hungry and restless 
Hungry for what I ain't sure 
But they're sweepin' the streets of the trash and the homeless 
And raisin' the rent 
And breakin' the poor 
And I used to walk on these gracefully 
But now they crunch beneath my feet 
And I guess I must be changin' 
There's just no way to keep it neat

Shawn Mullins,"Joshua was an old man 
His beard like mountain snow 
And when I was a boy we'd have jam sessions 
I'd sneak off to old Sharptop 
With my guitar I would go 
When I should have been at school 
Learnin' my lesson 
And I'd sip a little moonshine 
And I'd smoke a corncob pipe 
And we'd pick all day until our fingers bled 
And right around supper time 
I'd run home in the night 
Just in time to get a whippin' from my Dad 
Oh way back when 
He was 65 and I was 10 
And I will never be as free again 
Oh way back when 
The summer flew by quickly 
And Josh and I spent out time 
Writing words to songs from memories of his past 
He'd tell me bout the way it was 
And I'd find the perfect rhyme 
And I couldn't believe how we wrote our songs so fast 
I never knew an old man 
Could be so full of life 
The love we had was so hard to explain 
And I remember how the tears fell when he spoke of his late wife 
And I'd give him my 6-string to ease his pain 
Oh way back when 
He was 65 and I was 10 
And I will never be as free again 
Oh way back when 
And then in late November 
I knocked on his cabin dor 
I knocked and knocked but Joshua never came 
And I still remember 
How he laid there on the floor 
And I went home cryin' in the rain 
Oh way back when 
He was 65 and I was 10 
And I will never be as free again

Shawn Mullins,"Mormon's are everywhere 
Battalions of bicycling bachelors 
With dark suits 
And well cropped hair 
We're Mormons too 
Have been since '72 
I'm riding between my brother and sister 
In the back seat of a '67 Buick station wagon 
With red vinyl seats 
We stick by each other 
And to those seats 
We've been eating cheese and bacon sandwiches 
Our mother made for thirteen days straight in the August heat 
And both my siblings are wakin' on those eggshells 
As I will soon learn how to do myself 
They play their quiet silly games 
With their peashooters 
As I sip luke-warm Sprite from a tin can 
Sold to me by a hunchback silly bastard old woman 
A hundred miles back 
Who is probably the only person with good sense 
In this part of the country 
I still don't know what to do god-awful bacon and cheese sandwich 
But your body is your temple 
God tells us so, 
So drink up your milk 
And reap what you sow 
I mold the cheese and bacon sandwich into a ball in my hand 
It kind of reminds me of Play-dough 
I look around to see who is watchin' 
And stuff it between the red vinyl seats 
No one will find it 
At least not for a couple of weeks 
We're in this big place now 
It's kind of like 1/2 of an blue plastic Easter egg shell 
And there's a hole in the top 
Where the sun cuts through 
And lights up the room 
And I hear all these male voices 
Telling me that black people are inferior 
And it's ok to have more than one wife 
And as the dry dry breath of the Utah sun warms me 
I stand before a statue of Jesus that is far too big 
And has held these folks hostage for so so long 
And I gaze up at the nostrils of the sandstone savior 
And wonder if it 
Can smell all this bullshit 
Cause I sure can 
And I'm only 5 years old

Him once but that was long ago

Like a holy waterfall 
Over the gulf of mexico

And the beach is all closed down 
And the middle school punkrockers 
Ride their skateboards

About things and people she's never 
Seen just to keep from being blue and 
She gets home about a quarter to four 
And drives her brother 

To the liquor store on ocean avenue 
And I'm parked on the state line on this 
Cold November day and pretty soon I'll 
Be a drivin fool somewhere down this

In this bar on Fairfax
And from the stage I can tell that
She can't let go and she can't relax

She hangs her head to cry

Outside the city

Looks like a frown

And does his little show 
And all the people say 
You got balls to play the game this way

With good wine from mussel sholes

You gotta watch the bump right there across from the garbage dump

He said it hurt like hell

How have you all been

On a train ride down the west coast while 
On tour. 
Hadn't ridden a train since I was a kid

Waiting on a train 
I smoked my last cigarette 
Standing in out of the rain 
There's a cool wind blowin' 
Down the alley by the depot 
Amtrak down the coastline 
To the city of the roses 

Mama's hangin' hand me downs 
Daddy's in the hotel bar 
Kids reciting mother goose 
Running naked through the yard 
You see the best and the worst here 
The richest and the poor

To the red dirt floor 
Pull into the station 
The sun's settin' outside 
The pushers and the pullers

With no way to hold my head 
That didn't hurt 
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't 
Bad so I had one more for dessert 
Then I fumbled through my closet 
For my clothes 
And found my cleanest dirty shirt 
And I shaved my face 
And combed my hair 
And stumbled down the stairs 
To meet the day 
I'd smoked my brain the night before 
With cigarettes and songs 
That I've been pickin' 
But I lit my first and watched a small kid 
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin' 
Then I crossed the empty street and 
Caught the Sunday smell 
Of someone fryin' chicken 
And it took me back to something 
That I'd lost somehow 
Somewhere along the way 
On the Sunday morning sidewalk 
Wishing Lord that I was stoned 
Cause there's something in a Sunday 
That makes a body feel alone 
And there's nothing short of dying 
Half as lonesome as the sound 
On the sleeping city sidewalk 
Sunday morning coming down 
In the park I saw a daddy 
With a laughing little girl 
He was swingin' 
And I stopped beside the Sunday school 
And listened to the song 
That they were singing 
Then I headed back for home 
And somewhere far away 
A lonely bell was ringing 
And it echoed through the canyon like 
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

I look a lot like a leprechaun
With a Mexican vest and a red hippie hat on
Maracas in my left hand, stick in my right
There are canyons there are caverns
There are boarder roadside taverns
I am held captive by the big blue sky above me
She naps with the TV on
I smell the June cut grass from my pappy's lawn
I play alone in the little room upstairs
There are Lincoln logs and cookie tins
Colored blocks and wars to win
I draw and I dream and beat my drums up there
There are circus lights and maple leaves
There are daffodils and dogwood trees
I am held captive by the big blue sky above me
Now the coffee's strong
And the fruit's all wrong
And my wakeup call's for somebody else
And the TV's hoax and neurosis jokes
Always keep my laughing at myself
And I laugh a lot that's what I do
And I learn the things I never knew
And I see canyons I see caverns
I see border roadside taverns
And I am held captive by the big blue sky above me
I am held captive only by the big blue sky
I am held captive by the big blue sky above me",Canyons & Caverns,1999
Shawn Mullins,"I fell asleep about 12:30 last night 
With the remote held in my hand 
I drifted off and I could see the light 
I was dreaming of the Promised Land 

Oh I had a dream last night 
But it's all a little foggy in my head 
It was something about brotherhood 
And love of all mankind 
I spoke with an angel 
But I can't remember what she said 

You know as people we are powerless 
Yet we live our lives in any old way 
Your people, my people, 
We're all God's people, 
And I don't guess it matters anyway 

Oh I had a dream last night 
But it's all a little foggy in my head 
It was something about brotherhood 
And love of all mankind 
I spoke with an angel 
But I can't remember what she said 

I fell asleep about 12:30 last night 
And I woke to the sound of the rounds of a .45 
And as the ambulance pulled away 
I heard a neighbor way, 
""So young and so full of life."" 

Oh I had a dream last night 
But it's all a little foggy in my head 
It was something about brotherhood 
And love of all mankind 
I spoke with an angel 
But I can't remember what she said",The Dream,1999
Shawn Mullins,"She seemed almost demented 
As she frantically repented 
For the crime in which she filled her empty bowl, 
It was empty like her soul 

She kneeled inside the confession booth, 
And she told that holy man the truth 
But the booth was empty, 
Frozen black as coal, 
It was damp and cold. 

Where are you gonna run to now? 
You lost what faith you had somehow 
Your show is over, 
It's time to take a bow 
Where are you gonna run to now? 

She spends her nights with lonely men 
And she goes too far every now and then. 
But it's her longest running show 
And the oldest job around, 
They say she's the best in town. 

Where are you gonna run to now? 
You lost what pride you had somehow 
Your show is over, 
It's time to take a bow 
Where are you gonna run to now? 

Now in 5 more years she'll be 23 
And in a lot of ways she's just like me 
She gives away her body, 
I give away my soul. 

We're always searching for life's treasures to unfold. 
We give it all to you 
Yet we have no pot of gold. 

So where are we gonna run to now? 
We lost what love we had somehow, 
We're on this one way highway 
Until the bitter end 
But where are we gonna run to then?",Just Like Me,1999
Shawn Mullins,"She gets high
She gets low
She lives her life straight
Just like a Serpico

She starts to sneeze 
And pronounces bless me
Whipes her nose on a shirt that says
Kill whitey

She takes away the hurt real fine
Kinda like listenin to Jimi
Or Patsi Cline

Whirlin round 
In the air
People say she's crazy
But she just don't care

And if I could see through Amy's eyes
Chances are I would realize
Somehow she sees bluer skies than I do

She picks a seat
At Johnny Cash
But she hates Courtney Love
With a passion

She's got a mom
She calls Denise
Her daddy cuts hair
But he always wanted to be a priest

Heaven know's where she's from
She blows me away
Just like a machine gun
 
And if I could see through Amy's eyes
Chances are I would realize
Somehow sees bluer skies than I do

If I believed in myself
If I was somebody else
I'd run right up to her and say
Your faith is my pride
I've gotta have you beside me

And if I could see through Amy's eyes
Chances are I would realize
Somehow she sees bluer skies than I do

I'm going crazy girl, can't get you off of my mind

Everyday that I live without you
I just can't help but dream about you
Everywhere I go 
And after all the love that I've left behind me
You're the one I keep inside me
Everywhere I go, I get that feeling

It's hard to be so far apart
When thoughts of you keep coming on so strong
I picture you in every face I see
Now I know I left a part of me back home with you
There's nothing like falling for the very first time
I won't forget you girl, for the rest of my life

And give me one more chance to prove you wrong

I saw a monarch butterfly
Spread its holy wings and fly
Beneath the velvet sun
I watched her come undone and then disappear

And I dug down really hard
And then a voice inside said
I gotta ask you why you're still comin' here

And tell me where did we go wrong
And give me one more chance to prove you wrong

It's hard to say where love turns cold
We never thought that we'd grow old
We filled up fast and went down slow
Enough to fake us out and make us fold

In the burning heart of downtown Santa Fe

 Hitched a ride from sunny L.A. 
 With a soldier who'd gone AWOL Stockade bound 
 And they got off in the Texas rain 
 And they hopped a southern diesel train 
 Headed to Atlanta 
 My hometown 
 Where she danced all night 
 In a go-go bar 
 And he tried his best 
 To play bass guitar 
 In the absolute worst punk bar ever heard 
 Yeah, but she got tired of that Georgia clay 
 And a drunk musician 
 Who couldn't even play

 It keeps him up all night

 It keeps him up all night

 For somethin' of her own

 But the whiskey and the pills 
 Wouldn't quench his thirst no more 
 So he stuck a needle in his arm 
 Then he lost his band 
 He started liftin' shops 
 It didn't take long 
 To get cuffed by the cops 
 And right about now 
 He's workin' on the county farm 
 It's never easier to say goodbye

He reads his dirty magazines
And mops the bathroom floor
He's lived a hard life
He lost a digit in the war
He keeps one hand on the shotgun
And both feet on the floor

And the old dreams fill his head
When he lays down in his bed

Shawn Mullins,"I once had a true love, her name was Maggie Brown
Her eyes they were the color of the sun burning down
And she had hair that smelled like jasmine, I loved her from the start
How was I to know she?d have a cold black heart

Well Maggie was my true love, the only kiss I knew
I?d meet her at the oak tree in the cool evening dew
Where we would walk beside the levee our fingers intertwined
While the crimson moon gazed through the needles of the pines
We?d lay beside each other, staring at the sky
Listenin? to the whistlin? of the train blowin? by
As it was on it?s way to Macon The town where I was born
We?d make love in the darkness, ?til the hours of the morn

Waterfalls and rainbows, sweet salvation sin
As I lay there sleeping against her golden skin,
My friends now gather around and listen close
The story takes a turn I wasn?t fair young Maggie?s only lover I did learn
I went down by the oak tree lookin? for my lass
And walked east towards the levee with the sunset in my past 
And then I ran through briars and brambles, until I finally found
My Maggie and her true love there lyin? on the ground
My eyes they filled with fire, they didn?t see me there
I watched as she made love to him, caressed him with her hair
I don?t remember how it happened I guess I just saw red
I drew my pistol from my belt and shot them graveyard dead

I once loved a maiden her name was Maggie Brown
But now I?m riding on a boxcar back to Macon town
The setting sun will never let me forget what deed I have done
Until the day they hunt me down,
I?m livin? on the run

Shawn Mullins,"Pain, come no more Don?t you come knockin? on my door
Love, dry your tears You have lived a life way beyond your years

And faith, when you?re gone
All my demons and my devils they do me wrong
And faith, you let your light shine through
Let a ray of hope surround me
Just don?t think I can make it without you

Hey faith, don?t let me down 
Let me know when I come back she?ll be around
?Cause I?ve been burned, a time or two
If she left me Lord, I don?t know what I?d do

And faith, when you?re gone
All my demons and my devils they
Do me oh so wrong
And faith, you let your light shine through
You let a ray of hope surround me
Just don?t think I can make it without you

In the morning you know I wake up with the dawn
Everyday, there?s a way
You know I got to carry on
To know the way and take the road of right and wrong
And keep faith in my heart
Just keep faith in your heart

Pain, come no more
Don?t you come knockin? on my door
Love, please be strong
?Cause I need the peace of mind to carry on

And faith, when you?re gone
All my devils, all my demons,
You know, they do me wrong
And faith, you let your light shine true
You let a ray of hope surround me
You came back home and found me
Searching for the love I never knew

Not forgetting there's some truth to what you said
And you know now that I gotta keep rollin? on
Here we go now, we're driving through another dawn

Someday you'll find love
Someday you'll find love
Someday you'll find love

When it?s over, do you try to build another fire?
Or do you pour water on the coals? Are we both just too damn tired?
And you know now that I gotta keep movin?on
Here we go now, everything we had is gone

And someday you'll find love
Give you everything you need
And someday you'll find love
Give you everything you need
Someday you'll find love, find love

What you were after, I never had to give anyway

Shawn Mullins,"Sixty miles from El Paso
Feelin' lonesome as can be
Driving further from the heartache
That was slowly killing me

I left at 4 am last Monday
Filled my tank at luther's store
I might be checking' in come Sunday
'cause I know by then she'll walk the floor

She has it still inside her skull
That I am hers and she is mine
She's dead on empty and I am full of
Broken dreams and homemade wine

There's a kid who plays the squeesebox
On the border bridge on the juarez side
He dances to the beat
With no shoes on his feet
To the music that he makes as I drive by

And I felt just like the devil the whole night's pull
But right this second I feel fine
My tank is dead on empty, but I am full
Of broken dreams and homemade wine

Now the gulf wind she sings to me a love song
I can hear her from the boxcar that I ride
Her voice is in my brain
Making music with this train
That will soon take me to the other side

And she might think that I'm coming back
To hold her close and stop her cryin'
But this freight train's
Traveling down a southbound track
Full broken dreams and hommade wine
Just broken dreams and hommade wine
Broken dreams and hommade wine

Shawn Mullins,"""Lay Down Your Swords, Boys""

Well lay down your swords, boys, lay down your guns
A new day?s a comin? first sight of the sun It?ll shine like a beacon on whoever shall love While sweet baby Jesus rides the wing of a dove
Now our color filled country is a giant strip mall It?s a joke in the men?s room misspelled on the stall
But when it?s all over, ain?t no colors anyway Like an old silent movie, only black, white and gray
Lay down your swords, boys, lay down your guns A new day?s a comin? first sight of the sun
It?ll shine like a beacon on whoever shall love While sweet baby Jesus rides the wings of a dove
Well the bad guys are gone, boys,
We run most of them down
When we flattened the hillsides
And we pummeled the ground
And speaking on bombs, boys,
You'd better believe
That it?s better to give boys,
Than it is to receive
Lay down your swords, boys,
Lay down your guns
A new day?s a comin? first sight of the sun
It?ll shine like a beacon on whoever shall love
While sweet baby Jesus rides the wings of a dove
Now Old Glory?s still flyin?, just like before
And your kids ain?t believin? in nothin? no more
And you can?t really blame ?em,
Same shit we were fed
From the pages of schoolbooks
To the Bibles we read
Lay down your swords, boys, lay down your guns
A new day?s a comin? first sight of the sun
And it?ll shine like a beacon
On whoever shall love
While sweet baby Jesus rides the wings of a dove

I hate it when you cry
When your tears fall down
I feel like I could die

Or disappear
And that's the fear that you have
But you've gotta follow you own path

I've always been told
The tighter that you hold,
You might just squeeze the life

Right out of your own soul
Love can take its toll on your heart
Why can't you finish what you start?
Love is cruel, Baby, love ain't fair

And there ain't no map
Or book of rules to get you there
It's just a friendly game of solitaire

You gotta be crazier
Than any girl could ever be",Solitaire [*],2006

One that blows off dusty memories 
And the one voice of the faded and forgotten 
Is screamin' like an eagle through the trees
It sings to you a song that you remember 
It whispers like the softly fallen snow 
On a Pennsylvania farm in late December 
Is there somewhere like that left where we could go?

We could go and start again
We could go and start again
Shine some light on the shadows of our sins 
We could go and start again

When the devil tries to drag you through the darkness
And the self-hate rakes you through the burning coals
Take my hand and we will stand together 
We'll ride another cycle of our souls. 

Of our souls, on our way
Of our souls, on our way
Trade tomorrow for another yesterday
Of our souls, on our way

The day that peace will come won't be mistaken 
It'll sing a song that everyone will know 
And the holy train that leaves this worldly station
Will take us anywhere we wanna go

Shawn Mullins,"Old Miss Johnston lived all alone
On the sorry side of town
Broke down cars and burglar bars
On the windows and doors
In case danger comes around

Sittin' in her yellow kitchen
Listenin' to bad news on a Radiant radio
It used to be Louis Armstrong
Then Martin Luther King
Where did everybody go?

Out the window where her garden was
It's not safe to go outside
Old Miss Johnston in the eye of the storm
It was the safest place to hide

And life's a gamble for the broken and the weak
Dealin' with the bangers and the drugs
The whinos weave and amble
And shuffle on down the street
Steerin' clear of all the thugs

And now my city hangs her head in shame
You can't tell the truth from all the lies
Everything changed forever and everything stayed the same
On the night Miss Johnston died

Shawn Mullins,"Now my old friend Harry
Never slowed down to marry
He's in sales
He's gone most of the year

And he smiles through all those lies
With dollar signs in his eyes
He orders himself another beer

Now Harry, he's a dreamer
And a scholar and a schemer
But he'll be there for you
When push comes to shove

His mama called him Harold
She was one of only two women
That Harry ever loved

The other was a waitress
In Cave Creek, Arizona
That broke his heart
And tangled up his mind

My old friend Harry
Looking kinda scary
Wonders if he's runnin' out of time

Now Biloxi, he's got a sadness
Like a dark day in December
But Harry recognizes
An old forgotten southern times

Thumbing through the phone book
For a name he can't remember
Lookin' desperate like a junkie
Waitin' for a fix to come around

Sittin', playin' blackjack
With a hooker and a tourist
And a one eyed dealer winnin' every hand

Harry sips Black Label
Slumps down at the table
Feelin' like a fraction of a man

Had hair as orange as Halloween

And she always sang from the bottom of her heart
And though her road was so long
She finally made her way back home
Yes, she finally made her way back home

The loneliest kid I ever saw
Owned to an old man's calloused hands
Sitting barefoot in front of a dime-store
In a place some called, 'The Promised Land'

He had hollow sunken eyes
But he was smiling big like he'd won some kinda prize
He was ragged, he was rolling like a stone
In the dirty city streets that he called home
Yeah, the dirty city streets that he called home

Don't ride in box cars like they did before
Seems like most of my heroes
Just ain't around no more

Shawn Mullins,"There's a factory standing empty
Where we built your Chevrolet
And we sent our kids to college
On a forty hour wage

But now the windows all are broken
There's graffiti on the walls
And the kids came home from college
And took a job down at the mall

And the winter is getting longer
And this town is frozen now
And I can't remember summer
It feels like spring may never come

There's a half full whiskey bottle
On the table by my bed
And there's a hollow in the pillow
Where she used to lay her head

And all the dreams and all the memories
Faded pictures and crooked frames
Hang in silence down the hallway
In the chill of what remains

Now the winter is getting colder
And my heart is frozen now
And I can't remember summer
It feels like spring may never come

Shades of hopeless on the faces
Of the souls who stand in light
And Holy Jesus hangs on crosses
And I hear Mother Mary crying

Shawn Mullins,"I turned 17, spring of 1861
And I killed 20 men 'fore I turned 21
20 holes and 20 men, 20 holes they's buried in
There they lay in the cold red Georgia play at Catoosa County

I can hear the screaming, I can smell black powder burning
Cannon balls flying and the Gatling guns turning
Thousand souls, a thousand men, a thousand holes they's buried in
Shallow graves in the cold heart Georgia play at Catoosa County

And the blue and the gray, paint the colors of the light
How the old men found a way to send the young men out to die
If I could I would place a 100 billion dollar bounty
On the hate that makes a war that digs graves at Catoosa County

Night falling on the hills and the blue moon comes a-shining
And I can hear the weeper wail and the ? whining
And all the souls of all the men roll in the holes they's buried in
Blue and gray and the blood red Georgia play at Catoosa County

And the blue and the gray, part the colors of the light

That I wouldn't feel like I was missing out

Hope he's happy, I wouldn't trade for anything

Smoke in my head and drink in my hand
And too hard to laugh, too low to cry
And the smoke went south and the drink went dry

We were alone there
There was still hope there

The trees all hit the ground

I come in late
Just to find if you were there
Just to look at your long brown hair

And dream a dream out in the hall
Was that my name that's just been called?
I don't know, it could be
Have you got something to tell on me?

If you got something to tell on me, babe
It better be good
Even though you hate me so much
I'm still comin' back

Like you knew I would
You can't believe
What I been through these last few months
It's very difficult to tell the difference

Between the trumps and the down home dumps
Only one thing I can say to you
Even if you don't believe it's true
It's true

It's our turn now
To find out where we're going
It's our turn now
To find out where you've been

It's our turn now
To keep the new direction
It's your turn now
To cast off all your sin

Fellatia, Fellatia, how do you plead?
You don't have to plead
For anything that you really need
Plead, have mercy

When the wind starts blowin' hard
And this cardboard world we're livin' in
It ain't forgotten, out in the yard
Out in the yard

Where the air is cold
And there ain't no leaves to fall
He's lookin' hard at the ground for somethin'
Somethin' that won't show up

I keep lookin' back over my shoulder
Couple of good friends goin' by
Pour some wine over their fire
Don't let the tears stay in your eyes

He's not gone so very far
I know he's very near
'Cause every time I call his name
I know that he can hear

To find out where we're going
It's our turn now
To find out where you've been

To keep the new direction
It's your turn now
To cast off all your sin

Hey, Mr. Roberts, don't you tell me no lies
I don't mind you being vain
Pick up the phone in your whitewashed house
Simpering that same refrain

Three to five more years
Is all you got
For you to do your nasty thing
Making rain, suffering pain

Telling everybody that it's in his name
His name, whose name
What are you telling me?
I don't believe your tales

Too many people in this world
Don't like being snails
If you gonna do it
Better get it together

Better go and make the change
Do it right now
Do it while it's warm
Do it while it's there within your range

It won't be so very hard
You better have no fear
'Cause by the time you get it done
It'll be so clear

It's our turn now
To find out where we're going
It's our turn now
To find out where you've been

To keep the new direction
It's your turn now

Won't you let fly with your shaft of light
Are you hunting your quarry now?

And I see you standing there in your bright blue gown

To go back amidst the noise and babble

And I'll keep looking into that endless sphere
And then you're gonna know
There really wasn't nothing to fear

So don't cry, baby, in the dark of night
When you know I ain't there to hold you tight
And I can't answer any of your questing glances
Like when we woke up in the morning
And we saw the dawn was storming

And the clouds were there love
Outside the window so fair
And the sun came rising, it was surprising
Cast out all your dark surmising
And then the car came, you spoke my name
And left me

But I'm not alone on this earth so fair
There's something else beside me here
Something keeps me ever looking forward
And it's brighter than the sunlight
And it's purer than the moonlight
And it's drawing me toward it

As her cascade chestnut hair
And now loving is in living for forgetting your past
So now why the distant stare?
Could it be there is someone who remains
In her heart and she cares?

And the ice of her kisses lingers on and on
And the image of her body live
Yet you walked on black sand by the sea's turmoil
In the dark of a velvet night

Then you sat down and gave your hands to be kissed and loved
Could not you hear a gentle sigh?
And by the stars part control of your wandering life
Do you believe in not telling lies?
But it was good that you were warm
On your way back home, short love, goodbye",Steel Eyes,1971
Shawn Phillips,"Lightning slaying shadows
In the tremors of the night
While he creeps among the alleys
Bringing fear before the fright

She sleeps in tattered trousers
In the ballroom's decadence
Moaning gently of her dreaming
By escorted precedence

Antiquated babblings
From a constant stream of thought
Sensitively wringing out
The rags that he has caught

Patting yet her bulging belly
She so slowly cries a smile
In anticipated suffering
Of her slowly growing child

He is speeding in a vacuum
Going nowhere, but, of course
He might believe in discipline
Of a bloody kind of sort

Naturally a state of race
A never changing spate of hate
While everything in some weird way
Does manage to relate

To her it doesn't matter more
Its chasms have been leapt
And she leans upon the skepticism
Of her chosen fate

Stand tall, you spittle-smattered son of man
Stand up, you hear them say
To slap you down and kick your teeth
And smile across the bay

Irrelevant eloquent pleading
Wasn't what she did this year
She passed it by and told a lie
And shed a crystal tear

For him to see, from valley's edge
From plateaus in the sand
And yet he has beshit himself
For being just a man

A bragging crowing sort of twit
A cast-off shade of pink
Who's brought himself and all the rest
Unto the very brink

Yet that magic urge
Continues on and plays continuum
A song of pleasure and of pain
Until that will be done

Shawn Phillips,"Once in Royal David's City stood a lowly cattle shed,
Where a mother laid her baby.
You'd do well to remember the things He later said.
When you're stuffing yourselves at the Christmas parties,
You'll laugh when I tell you to take a running jump.
You're missing the point I'm sure does not need making;
That Christmas spirit is not what you drink.

So how can you laugh when your own mother's hungry
And how can you smile when the reasons for smiling are wrong?
And if I messed up your thoughtless pleasures,
Remember, if you wish, this is just a Christmas song.

Shawn Phillips,"T'was a man of youthful features
T'was a boy of sorrowful eyes
Watching out by looking inward
Tall and stately and full of life

In his life, he spoke but rarely
In his mind he cried for light
Painting perceptions trying to capture
That which he saw in his questioning strife

Once in Lisbon, twice in London
Traveling around for all of his time
Looking for and finding a goddess
He took Diana to be his wife

Of the children, they'd begotten
Two had died without knowing life
And the third I know not whereof
But if she lives, she will yet be kind

Casey had a mark of simple value
He had a star between his eyes
In his hands he held an axe blade
The Greek symbol of thunder and fire

On a night when the heavens were crying
He went out and took his blade
Chopping wood to warm his heart side
The lightning came and my brother died

Bring him no wine from faraway vineyards
Tell him no tales of the canyon's might
But wish him peace and eternal wisdom
For he has died and he died by light",The Ballad of Casey Deiss,1992

Of a mountain's winter day
I left her at the turning
To go on her seeking way

To pass o'er meadows green and bare
Or brown as her auburn hair
O'er all the waters on the face of the earth
To find that I really care

And the myriad reflections of myself
In her buttons on her oversize navy coat
But only reflections and never an image
In her mind's unfathomable moat

But some castles where she wanders
Are yet crumbling into dust
In this house of visions, on top of the hill
The glass has turned to rust

So never again will I look in her eyes
Nor shall she hear my voice
But I hope she will find a better man
To love him and rejoice

And he will turn the secret key
Nay, I know it's not up to him
But somehow in his words and love
Answer her every whim

So seek ye lass for what you wish
But in your troubled heart
And let not your mind race ahead of your breast
For the quicker shall you part

And wait for the click that you speak dear of
And never will you run
Light will splinter through open clouds
And you'll look straight at a face like the sun",L Ballade,1992
Shawn Phillips,"Yellow flowers
Bought today
I bought 'em from the man who lives in the other way
Wilting flowers
Couldn't stay
Not enough water gotta fill 'em to the brink today

Another moonshine
Oh, moonshine
Moonlight halo gonna tell about a coming rain
Another moonshine
Oh, moonshine
Moonlight halo gonna tell about a coming ...

I don't believe it can be verified
I don't believe it can be put right
It's too confused in all of its facets
It's too complex in all of its ways
They just continuing to tell me their trouble
They just continuing to tell me their lies
They don't believe in helping their brother
They're standing still and hearing his cries
If you believe that you got the power
If you believe it deep in your heart
You're on the run in front of a gunner
You're on the run and no one said start

I said moonshine
Oh, moonshine
Moonlight halo gonna tell about a coming rain
Another moonshine
Oh, moonshine
Moonlight halo gonna tell about a coming ...

Red moon rising, dogs are howling
Throwing stones at Willy on the other side
Octogenarians intermarrying
What you gonna do when the light goes out?
Madly scrambling in the brambling
Up the mountain like a frightened trout
Killing relieves the hunting imperative
Maiming relieves the sadist's delight
They don't believe in what they are doing
I do believe that they are uptight
Safe and secure in maudlin commodities
Smug and pedantic into their lives
Stupidity can never make answers
Pathos is there in all of its might

I said moonshine
Oh, moonshine
Moonlight halo gonna tell about a coming rain
Another moonshine
Oh, moonshine
Moonlight halo gonna tell about a coming rain

Talk about after, there's gonna be laughter
Talk about after, yeah, there's gonna be laughter
Talk about after, heh, there's gonna be laughter someday
Talk about after, there's gonna be laughter someday

Another sunshine
Oh, sunshine
Sunshine comin' gonna be another brand new day, yeh
Sunshine comin' gonna be another brand new day, ah
Sunshine comin' gonna be another brand new day
Sunshine comin' gonna be another brand new ...

And raised in the trees 
Of western Kentucky
On wobbly knees
With mama beside you 
To help you along 
You'll soon be growing up strong
 
All the long, lazy mornings 
In pastures of green 
The sun on your withers 
The wind in your mane 
Could never prepare you
For what  lies ahead 
The run for the roses so red
 
And it's run for the roses 
As fast as you can 
You fate is delivered 
Your moment's at hand 
It's the chance of a lifetime 
In a lifetime of chance 
And it's high time you joined
In the dance 
It's high time you joined 
In the dance 
 
From sire to sire 
It's born in the blood
The fire of a mare 
And the strength of a stud 
It's breeding and it's training
And it's something unknown
That drives you 
And carries you home 
 
And it's run for the roses

Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about

After it brought my lover near

From the tear running down my face

Visions of a sunset just appear
When I close my eyes
Takes me closer to heaven
When the flute starts to fly
And the violin cries
Confusion leaves
While peace orchestrates
Runs through my veins
And in other seekers it penetrates
My reason why the big city air smells so sweet
Takes me through journeys in time
From my youth to as far as I can see

Shawn Stockman,"We started out as real good friends. 
Mentally, we became intimate. 
Was it in the stride of my sexy walk? 
Or was it in the sound of the way I talk? 
Something about you opened up my eyes, 
Made me see, you weren't like other guys. 
All my life, I've been waiting for someone who'll love me for me. 

[Chorus: x4]
He knows me; he loves me for who I am, not what he sees. 

He treats me like a queen, 
Not by giving me (oh, no, no) material things. 
By respectin' me, 
And holdin' me, 
And comforting me, 
Whenever I'm in need. 
I can truly say I've been changed. 
My inner strength has been rearranged. 
When you see his face he'll be right next to me. 
Or you just might see him in your dreams. 
Never thought I'd find somebody quite like you. 
Because of you my grayest skies have now turned blue. 
You are why I wear the smile upon my face. 
I'm so glad it's me. 

[Chorus: x4]

I'm so glad it's me. 

[Chorus: x3]

He's a strong, sweet man, strong sweet man, 
Holds me near in my palm of his hands. 
He never changes like the weather. 
Stays the same. 
He ain't my fair-weather man, he ain't my fair-weather man. 
I can lean on him, yes, I can depend on him. 
When I need a friend, he is always there for me.",He Loves Me,1998
Shawn Stockman,"Listen... 
Close your eyes, and take my hand. 
I know you're wondering, but you will soon understand. 
See, love needs time to crawl low, and time to run free. 
That's why we should get away so we can chill privately. 
Through the week you go your own way, and I go mine. 
Never truly enjoying each other; never a chance to unwind. 
So, give your heart to me and my hands right now. 
We'll search for tomorrow under a silver cloud. 

Refrain: 

At last we're alone. 

And I want to fly so high that I kiss the sky all alone. 

And I want to fly so high that I kiss the sky all alone. 

It's quiet as the morning raindrops on the ground. 

We'll bless so gently with the love that's all around. 

And I'm so glad to know you the way I do 

My special friend...we become much closer the more time we spend together in love. 

The one I think of, when I'm farway, you brighten my day. 

And now that you're here, my jets stand clear. 

Want you always near by my side as we hide away.

Shawn Stockman,"You said a little time is all you need. 

You told me that you're still young and there's so much more you want to see. 

You said you wanted to be alone to get into yourself. 

So I'm just supposed to let you go. 

And pretend my heart don't hurt like hell. 

Boy, it hurts me. 

That you want to be free. 

Baby, if there's nothing I can't say 

That'll make you want to stay with me.

Can you please answer this before you go? 

How am I supposed to go through life alone? 

Where am I to run for love if you're no longer home? 

How can I continue going through life alone? 

Boy I thought that you were my best friend. 

You used to promise me your fidelity would never end. 

Now you say you need your space to grow. 

You want to give back my heart but I give my love to only you. 

I don't want to make a brand new start. 

You were all my mine for all this time. 

But baby if there's nothing I can't do that'll make you want to change your mind...

Has passed since you said goodbye
Got your message today asking how am I
Well, I'm doing just fine
To admit the truth, hasn't crossed my mind
All I needed was some time
I wasn't always this strong

(Chorus 1:)
I remember all
How I cried
The night that you said goodbye
You expected me to die
But I made a brand-new start
And got on with my life
I did what I had to do
To get myself over you
I'm not falling apart
You underestimate
The condition of my heart

There was a time
You were ev'ry breath of mine
I was ready to give the rest of my life
You walked away
And now you think
That you can walk right back into my life
Like nothing happened
And I won't put up a fight
No, you left me all alone

I wanna know, where were you
When I cried
The night that you said goodbye

They consider no limit the only pure game left

And know an ace deuce can take out your pocket broads

It was a late Saturday night, big chips, we had a lotta
Theodore performed at the Plush Brigatta
It was an hour in, big chip leader of the game
Caught pocket jacks and flopped two more of the same
Looking at quads, waiting for someone to bluff
So I checked til someone said ""I had enough""
I'm raising a thousand, son I pay to see the river
Caught an ace and his face, was a straight up giver
He had three now, must of caught two in the hole
A full boat, I'm about to sink ship, tell him to fold
He laughs, raises his fifty g's, please I need chip count
The pit boss, swear I flip over, you gon' flip out
I'm all in, here to win, I rep Staten Island

Shawn Wigs,"Ah-yo
Here's a little story ghetto situation
'Bout a girl I met who had many temptations
She was so fly, get high, well understood
Big-a** big brains and straight out the hood

[Ghostface]
Yo,
Ah-yo, I woke up early took a stretch and a yawn
Had a 2 o'clock appointment with this girl name Dawn
She ain't the Avon lady but her beauty was strong

Right before she went to rest she had me singin this song
She must be a special lady
And a very exciting girl
I don't know

She had the high-glow's switchin
See her in the club you hear others chicks b****in
But Dawn quit to bust a b**** a** and s***
See she did 12 months over a ratchet

Not no crab s***
Got bagged with the mag
Taxi cab s***
Clit was hangin out her panties with no where to stash it

It was cla**ic
Nowadays she's laid back
Helpin me perfect my rap
Only pink and smoked salmon where she feed her cat

Wife everything
Diamond cut like johnny lex collar attached
Lickin gla** bowls in her cat clothes
'Cause crazy stacks

Finicky thing
Her kittin drink pollar spring
Take naps
Near her jewerly box

She play with all the rings
And when she step out the tub its like an ill flick
Caramel skin, bath and body works leave the whole room lit
Cinnamon candles, sweet side, they on relax mode

Paint her toes on the bed slow, watchin me
Versace robe on her body, peak, sippin asti (piemonte)
She a perfect 10 in my wildest dreams DAWN

[Cappadonna]
Ah-yo, she gotta be gone
Waitin on my sweet strawbeery pecan rican LaShawn
Holdin my taffy down when I'm gone
Three fourths of her body always covered with clothes

That's why I'm eatin her candy
And suckin her toes
Sweet sexy LaShawn
She got body like what's goin on

On some marvin gay s*** like lets get it onnnnn
Sugar
Let's get it on
Ah-yo she a diamond in the rough

Black rose in the hood
I love my queen and she treat me good
F*** cookin for me
She stash me out when the feds come lookin for me

I'm not cheatin on her or beatin on her
I spend the weekend on her
We on the block when the bills start creepin on her
She right there when it gets sticky

She strict politic to the vicky's
And a fly aviator the color of sky
God on her side

Indian chick with cat eyes
Mad respect with the fat thighs
Plus her guns for the revolution
Would straight leave her if she prostituting

Yo my girls the bomb
Intelligent mind
Sky blue louis vetton
Leg muscles, deep dimples

Body is soft she smell fresh like a new born
Pretty feet peitete a** nice shoes on
The sunshine for my quiet storm
Keepin the food warm while I'm gone

It won't be long 'til I'm back to my sweet butter pecan rican LaShawn
Hit me up baby, P.S. Cappadon'

[Trife]
Ah-yo, ah-yo I woke up in the morning still drunk off the Henn
Had a 3'oclock appointment with this girl name Jen
You know Jen from a hundred and ten, she push the Lex Coupe
Part time fashion designer she work for Jet Blue

Pretty young thing, with a body like vida
A** off the meter, eva medenez look, strut like a diva
Leave her shine fine, blow minds like dimes of a cheeba
She like it from behind, slow grind, sometimes with her feet up

Ms. Bonitta Applebum Bottom, thick as a Roman column
Raw dick it down, love me, even if I'm holdin condoms!
'Cause she my b****, the only cat that I lick
Throwin that a** like Ciara on the top of that whip

Latin decent, velour suit with the cameltoe print
Peppermint flared panties with the garder-belt clips
Tattoo of a small butterfly on her inner thigh
Even at my loneliest times you that Jen will ride...

[Chorus - Trife]
Whether Jen, Don, or Shawn its the same situation
'Bout a girl I met who had many temptations
She was so fly, get high, well understood
Big-a** big brains and straight out the hood",Jellyfish,2006
Shawn Wigs,"[Shawn Wigs]
I know she gone, but I'm still holding on
Still smell the scent of her clothes, only God knows the pain
I cried til there's no tears left
Love my babies, we can't explain why she left
I'm all alone, feeling like my heart is blown
I do anything, just to see her come back home
But she chose not to hold on, and broke the bond
Left me with two babies like I'm Mr. Mom
But I'm handle what God gave me, cuz I'm a good man, and
Try to break me down, I'm strong and stay standing
Never imagine she gettin' down like that
Nine years in this together and you turning your back? Come on

[Chorus: Eamon]
(All we can do is) Hold on, yeah
(All we can do is hold on) That's what I'm do, yeah
(All we can do is) Hold on, yeah
(All we can do is) I'ma try to (Hold on) hey

[Shawn Wigs]
I can't believe you walked out of my life
Not saying I was perfect, babe, but I was willing to work it
I know the grass look greener, but you should of stayed beat
Let a good man go, so you can run free?
Could of held on, to these rough times, and made better ones
You left me when my music was down with no fun
Broke, I struggled so you made it through college
Cause I had street smarts, but you had knowledge
Longevity, suppose to be together forever
Now you say we growing apart? Whatever, whatever
So I'ma open the cage and set my butterfly free
Just hoping it ain't too late when you come on back to me

[Chorus]

[Eamon]
But I'ma try to, hold on, and be strong
Cause this time, you're so wrong
But I wait, and, I long
For you touch, but you're gone
All these tears, and all this pain
I'll never, never, feel the same
I keep control, I lift my soul
I sing my song, I hold on

Is decided over a no limit poker tournament
Players, pro's even, can't handle the pressure of the game
They consider no limit the only pure game left

We gotta know how to play your cards, have a mean pokerface
And know an ace deuce can take out your pocket broads
This is no limit hold 'em, you gotta know when to fold 'em
If you plan on, staying on top

You can't lose, what you don't push into the pot
You can't make much either, if you a believer of luck
Go all in, if you're feeling your cards, deep in your gut

It was a late Saturday night, big chips, we had a lotta
Theodore performed at the Plush Brigatta
It was an hour in, big chip leader of the game
Caught pocket jacks and flopped two more of the same

Looking at quads, waiting for someone to bluff
So I checked 'til someone said I had enough
I'm raising a thousand, son I pay to see the river
Caught an ace and his face, was a straight up giver

He had three now, must of caught two in the hole
A full boat, I'm about to sink ship, tell him to fold
He laughs, raises his fifty G's, please I need chip count
The pit boss, swear I flip over, you gon' flip out

I'm all in, here to win, I rep Staten Island
He called it, I showed four jacks, he started wilding
This son of **** all night, he set me up
He check, check, he trapped me

You can't make much either, if you a believer of luck
Go all in, if you're feeling your cards, deep in your gut

It was a cash game, 100 200 dollar table
Me and Johnny Mack sitting, God willing and able
July 23rd and 4th, the lions is out
It's the month of the Leo, we gon' win with no doubt

Bunch of high rollers, laughing like he know we're low in the amateurs
I buy him for the ****, twenty G's, I'mma damage ya
Couple of chuckles, broken glasses, all tinted
I'mma put y'all all on tilt, give me a minute

So I check raise 'em, bluff 'em, ain't showing my cards
Two four off two, y'all ain't no superstars
I should of been at the table, World Series of Poker
I'm up 80 G's already, y'all a bunch of jokers

Now they all on tilt, raising, I call 'em all in
With pocket three's, for 80 G's, I'm ready to fall in
Flop two aces, caught my three on fourth street

How you ain't gon' fuck! bitch out me?
I'm the god damn reason you in VIP
CEO you don't have to see ID
I'm young, wild, and strapped like Chi-Ali
Blow! We ain't got nothing to worry about
Whoop ass, let security carry em out
Watch out for the medallion my diamonds are wreckless
Feels like a midget is hanging from my neckless
I pulled up wit a million trucks
Looking, smelling, feeling like a million bucks-ahh!
Pass the bottles, the heat is on
We in the huddle all smoking that Cheech & Chong
What's wrong?! The club and moon is full
And I'm looking for a thick young lady to pull
One sure shot way to get em outta them pants
Take note to the brand new dance, like this

[Chorus]

Go on wit ya big ass! lemme see something
Tell ya little friend he can quit mean mugging
I'm lit and I don't care what no one thinks
But where the FUCK is the waitress at wit my drinks?!
My people outside and they can't get in
We gon' rush the back door and break em in
The owner already pissed cause we sorta late
But our time and our clothes gotta coordinate
Most girls lookin right some looking a mess
That's why they spilling drinks all over ya dress
But Louie Vuitton bras all over your breasts
Got me wanting to put hickies all over ya chest
C'mon! we going party tonight
Y'all use mouth to mouth bring the party to life
Don't be scurred, show another part of your life
The more drinks in your system the harder to fight!

[Chorus]

Stand up! Stand up!
Stand up! Stand up!

Damn right the Fire Marshall wanna shut us down
Get us out so someone can gun us down
We was two songs away from getting some cutta
Now we one song away from tearing the club up
Move over! Luda got something to say
Do it now cause 'tomorrow' ain't promised 'today'
Work wit me! let's become one with the beat
And don't worry bout me stepping all over ya feet

[Chorus]

Stand up! Stand up!
Stand up! Stand up!

Shawna,"Intro(Shawnna)

Why you treat me like you do?
Can it just be me and you?
Cause I don't wanna play no more
If I let go, you let go
Cause I just can't get enough
And I just wanna feel you touch
But I just gotta know whatsup, wutsup, wutsup

Verse 1(Marques Houston)

Hey girl come here sit down
Lemme holla at you a while
Gotta get this off my chest 
Hope that you can handle it
We've been seeing each other a lot
Honestly I don't want it to stop
You and me; Me and you
I'm liking what we've got
Only thing that's bothering me 
We ain't as close as we should be
That's cause your holding back
Holding back your love for me
How do you expect to grow if you just don't let go

Chorus(Marques Houston)

Why you tryna hold back
Why you tryna hold back
When you know you want it just like I do
Why you acting like that, girl don't do me like that
All I'm tryna do is be next to you
Why you tryna hold back
Why you tryna hold back on me baby
All I want is you stop holdin back on me

Verse 2(Mya)

don't take offense to this
Not tryna start no mess
Ain't tryna have you stressed
This is just a little test
I wanna see how serious
Serious you are of us
Do you like or like me not
I'm loving what we've got
Only thing that bothers me 
We ain't close as we should be
That's cause your holding back
Holding back you love for me
How do expect this thing to grow
If you don't let it go go go go

Chorus(Mya and Marques Houston)

Babe
Why you tryna hold back
Why you tryna hold back
When you know you want it just like I do
Why you acting like that, girl don't do me like that
All I'm tryna do is be next to you
Why you tryna hold back
Why you tryna hold back on me baby
All I want is you stop holdin back on me

Verse 3(Shawnna)
Everytime I get to thinking bout you
I see I can't be without you
Cause you that shit, that's it
And I really can't leave right now boo
You my fix, your kiss
Made me bout to let go bout to
But wait right quick can't slip
I don't really think your down with this
See I played these games before
And I fall everytime we go
Cause see I can't no more
I move slow but don't really wanna stop the flow
Don't know what to do
Gotta just relax and hold back
Just sit back and roll that, roll that, rolle that

Chorus(Mya and Marques Houston)

Babe
Why you tryna hold back

When you know you want it just like I do
Wht you acting like that, girl don't do me like that

All I want is you stop holding back on me

Outro(Shawnna)

Why you treat me like you do?

Cause I just can't get enough
And I just wanna feel you touch
Wutsup wutsup 
Why you treat me like you do?
Can it just be me and you?
Cause I just can't get enough
And I just wanna feel you touch
I just gotta know whatsup, wutsup, wutsup

Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,

But I've got rainbows planned for tomorrow

But with you there at my side

You know what I need
Somebody that who can come li-li-lick the clit
And a nigga who ain't thinking 'bout a Trina L P
And I'll make him go and get my shit

We can go from a fly ass jetta to a coupe De Ville
Hotel tally ho or the Beverly hill
A real nigga not the run of the mill
Come and spank me and make me shoot to kill

From the kitchen then you can move me
To the jacuzzi and out the booty
Come and do your duty
Me and fat dick Ludacris making us a movie

Butt naked in a bed of cash
Make tough stuff stutter when I shake my ass
Damn she back, I though she a thing of the past
Cause I'm a bad bitch and I'm off the glass

Having sex in little jets menage'tois
Getting buck wild no matter where we are
Indie 500 in the back of the car
In a dark ass club on the back of a bar

Never want, never ever wanna leave
Work for me like the league overseas
I want a man to fulfill my needs
Keep my body trembling and buckle my knees

I wanna do in the canopy
I wanna do it where your girl gon' see and get mad at me
I want a nigga that'll grab the weave
And turn my eyes Chinese

Tell me baby can you handle me?
I wanna do it all in your mouth
Then I'll pull the ass out
Make you bounce till you pass out

Or we can cut up in the grass
And give the neighbors a flash
Can you tell me who the bad motherfucker now?
Said I wanna take-ta-take-take a nigga back to the crib

And I wanna do all the things, do all the things that I never did
Like I up on the top-to-top-top of the projects getting head
Or you can find me in a dro-drop-drop-drop on dubs in the candy red
I like a nigga when he face down, mouth wide
Polo down with them blades on the ride
Give me a pound with the case on the side
But it's okay I'm gon' break something tonight

Oh see get on your knees
And I'll show you what's my fantasy
Like up in the coupe, coupe
Tell your bitch she ain't gotta be mad at me

And I wanna talk some shit while I feel it get stiff
And then ruba-dub on my tits while I nut on your lips nigga

I'm a be K Bitch, love to ride dick
Ass in his face, cock spread out
Nigga uptown, nigga down south
Same ol' shit, foot's in his mouth

F-O-X call me rough sex
Especially when a bitch get right on the X
Get it right on X
Fuck him, check right to the next

Those bitches go right, fox right to the left
Nigga can't fuck, burner on his chest
36 D's, Prada on the breast
Baddest, send him home with na-na on his breath

What? How you think a bitch got my rep?
3 mills, still BK to the death
Still don't give a fuck, still pose naked
Still specialize on sittin' on niggas faces

Pop magnum's by the cases, X5 Benz still spend big faces

I wanna get you in the Georgia Dome on the fifty yard line
While the Dirty Birds kick for tree

In the DJ booth or in the back of the V.I.P.
Whipped cream with cherries and strawberries on top, lick it don't stop
Keep the door locked don't knock while the boat rock
We go-bots and robots so they gotta wait 'til the show stop
Or how 'bout on the beach with black sand
Lick up your thigh then call me the Pac Man
Table top or just give me a lap dance
The Rock to the Park to the Point to the Flatlands
That man ain't Ludacris (woo) in the public bathroom
Or in back of the classroom
How ever you want it lover lover gonna tap that ass soon
See I cast 'em and I past 'em get a tight grip and I grasp 'em
I flash 'em and out last 'em
And if ain't good then I trash 'em while you stash 'em
I'll let 'em free
And the tell me what's they fantasy

Or we can do it on stage of the Ludacris concert
'Cause you know I got sold out
Or red carpet dick could just roll out
Go 'head and scream you can't hold out
We can do it in the pouring rain
Running the train when it's hot or when cold out
How 'bout in the library on top of books
But you can't be too loud
You wanna make a brother beg for it
Give me TLC 'cause you know I be too proud
We can do it in the White House
Try to make them turn the lights out
Champagne with my campaign let me do the damn thing
What's my name, what's my name, what's my name 
Sauna, Jacuzzi in the back row at the movie
You can scratch my back and rule me
You can push me and just pull me

Eating fresh fruits sweep yo woman right off her feet

I wanna get you in the back seat windows up
That's the way you like to fuck, clogged up fog alert
Rip the pants and rip the shirt, rough sex make it hurt
In the garden all in the dirt
Roll around Georgia Brown that's the way I like it twerk
Legs jerk, overworked, underpaid but don't be afraid
In the sun or up in the shade
On the top of my Escalade
Maybe your girl and my friend can trade, tag team, off the ropes
On the ocean or in the boat, factories or on hundred spokes
What about up in the candy sto' that chocolate chocolate make it melt
Whips and chains, handcuffs, smack a little booty up with my belt
Scream help play my game, Dracula man I'll get my fangs
Horseback and I'll get my reigns, school teacher let me get my brains

And his candy's just so sweet
When he caressed my whole body
All I need is him to be my loverboy

Loverboy, come on and love me
Give me more
Touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long (I enjoy the way you rock me)
Loverboy come on and take me
Only you know how to make me
Shudder with anticipation
All night long

Well I'm kind of innocent
A vision of love
You adore me
Even though my image is thug

What I see in you
Is for my eyes only to see
I bring out the freak in you
Up and down on me
I'm your lovergirl

Me your loverboy
But when we roam alone
We come touch toys
Making noise we can't avoid

The way I throw that
Can't pop, backdrop, stopwatch, Brat-tat
Get ya more rock
Hard up
All of the things that you wanna do to me
If you wanna, we can get obscene
My cream and you're ding-a-ling mingle
Bother me not
When the sensation come out

I'll make you scream
Uh huh uh huh baby
Feel me
When I pump the pump lady
Behind me we can be close like family
You're so sweet you taste like all types of candy
Starburst to jellybeans

Banana split my dairy queen
Butterfinger my tangerines
Chickens only taste my
Loverboy in they dreams
All my ladies
Let me hear you scream
Hate on me
As much as you want to
You can't do
What the fuck I do
Bitches be emulating me daily (daily)
Hate on me
As much as you want to
You can't be
Who the fuck I be
Bitches be imitating me lately (Loverboy)

Loverboy, come on and love me
Give me more (Give it to me)
Touch me and touch me

Loverboy come on and take me (Raspberry)

Luda Fate Tity Ho I'm the Southside
Face down ass up with her mouth wide
You know the drill slangin pills tryna get green
I'm 2-0 but got a m-16

[Chorus]
(T) Slums
(I&S) all them niggaz and them bitches with there own ends
(T) Slums
(I&S) who riding cutless and them caddies on them grown men
(T) Slums
(I&S) who's in the trap and make them papers till the folks come
(T) Slums
(I&S) You know that they'll never change unless they owe something

I'm like this corner I gotta stay bent
I need every quarter I gotta pay rent
I see you nigga you got fans and shit
But you gotta stop shakin and get your dancin ???

She hit a motherfucker straight up of the block serving rocks
Trying to get in my socks before the cops see
And if a nigga want to take it to the glocks want to shock
Quicker then a motherfuckers want to pop me

Keep it chill what you know about Scottsdale
Even late fighting pits and the glocks tale
Mack 10's church preachers even cops tell
And now he pleading over bread 'cause the block fell

When I was dead broke I didn't like postas
stuntin round me might stunt your growth
Draw down on four pound on
Pick shawnnas ass from up off the ground holmes

[Chorus]

I wish a mothefucker would try to come test a bitch
In the back ty's niggaz want to base a bitch
It's them Cadillac trucks and them lexesus
And can't none you niggaz stand next to this

Drug dealer legend in my own time
Nike signs happy faces and the whole nine
Pop pills pop pussy poppin crist nigga
Lil fate I double ludacris nigga

I'm like fuck everysingle free-throw
Even tho I might nigga wit a pink toe
The game is fast but the cash is slow
Why they want to come to tit like he know

You go down the block in that black 6-4
Smoking that stuff in the pack that tit bought
Project niggaz with project flow
Slum ass niggaz wit them slum ass hoes

Whoop ass, let security carry em out
Watch out for the medallion my diamonds are wreckless
Feels like a midget is hanging from my neckless
I pulled up wit a million trucks
Looking, smelling, feeling like a million bucks-ahh!
Pass the bottles, the heat is on
We in the huddle all smoking that Cheech & Chong

And I'm looking for a thick young lady to pull
One sure shot way to get em outta them pants

On my American bandstands
Summer-salts, cartwheels bitch just keep on dancing
Chinese splits-splits slide on down that pole-pole
And feel this dick-dick getting out of control-trol
Oh no keep going till a nigga like me say stop
Let it kiss the sky and then make it drop
Tuck and twist if you don't like it, you're fuckin' Cris
I'm rubbing clits so stay and catch don't try to duck and miss
Do your stretches don't pull no hamstrings
You got me moving, in fact you doing the damn thing
Stronger muscles exercise every part of your body hurts
Let's do this sweating, thank God your bath and body works
I like a woman that makes her own doe, don't need a lot of help
But your heart'll melt if I put a thousand in your garder belt
Lip gloss traces, your pierced in 11 places
And your lips downtown just made some familiar faces like whoa!

Let it go now front, back, watch me drop it like that
Show me where the money at

Redbone wit a Scorpio tatted on her tummy
I'm sitting slouched back in the chair, stunting, waving money
And shawty star, zig zagging her derriere for me
A bowlegged thoroughbred and said her name was ""Strawberry""
Up her pussy, shawty pushed in a whole bottle of Moe'
Reached in my pocket grabbed a G and then threw it on the flo'

Trying to figure out if they're scared of the hips or the chips

[Verse 1]
Now I was rocking this party in the hundreds wilding
You know where them killaz get right and rock a party
From Friday to Saturday night
Fifth of remy I'm scum and still hold the mic
I tried to put it down, and say that I'm cool
But they give it back to me and say continue
that's the thing about hundreds they never give up
On the drug and the music and all that hood stuff
That makes ya life worth hustling for
Projects is the crowd, the crowd that I draw
Never am I fake, and never ever shall I be
ain't a chicken alive that can deal with me
And if you think your the one, that can deal with this
well you a... bets prepare cause I spit that shit

Kick this one for Southside
Kick this one for the Westside
Now kick this here for me and my city

[Verse 2]
Yo I was chilling in the 50, minding my own
When this braod walked up with a chrome microphone
She said ""hey bitch look up, I heard about you
so here a microphone let's see what you can do""
So I took the microphone, and I threw it to the bar
Cause I need no assist when it comes to going hard
When I start to rap, she start to shake
She sort of confront me was truly a mistake
So she picked the mircophone up, and I took me a shot
And before I turned around that bitch was down the block, Now

Kick this one for oakyell
Now kick this one for the low end
Now kick this one here for me and my city

Now when I'm on stage, everyone start choking
Is it what I'm saying, or is it what I'm smoking?
50-50 chane is what I'm blowin
And at the same time DTP got 'em open
If you can get hype, and sort of like loud
Yo Jay Cee kick this one for the crowd
I been to lots of parties, mostly off a pound
And one thing I notice my niggaz get down
So Hip-Hopper (Hip-Hoppers) from all around

Why you treat me like you do?
Can it just be me and you?
Cause I don't wanna play no more
If I let go, you let go
Cause I just can't get enough
And I just wanna feel you touch
But I just gotta know whatsup, wutsup, wutsup

Verse 1(Marques Houston)

Hey girl come here sit down
Lemme holla at you a while
Gotta get this off my chest 
Hope that you can handle it
We've been seeing each other a lot
Honestly I don't want it to stop
You and me; Me and you
I'm liking what we've got
Only thing that's bothering me 
We ain't as close as we should be
That's cause your holding back
Holding back your love for me
How do you expect to grow if you just don't let go

Chorus(Marques Houston)

Why you tryna hold back
Why you tryna hold back
When you know you want it just like I do
Why you acting like that, girl don't do me like that
All I'm tryna do is be next to you
Why you tryna hold back
Why you tryna hold back on me baby
All I want is you stop holdin back on me

Verse 2(Mya)

don't take offense to this
Not tryna start no mess
Ain't tryna have you stressed
This is just a little test
I wanna see how serious
Serious you are of us
Do you like or like me not
I'm loving what we've got
Only thing that bothers me 
We ain't close as we should be
That's cause your holding back
Holding back you love for me
How do expect this thing to grow
If you don't let it go go go go

Chorus(Mya and Marques Houston)

Why you tryna hold back
Why you tryna hold back
When you know you want it just like I do
Why you acting like that, girl don't do me like that
All I'm tryna do is be next to you
Why you tryna hold back
Why you tryna hold back on me baby
All I want is you stop holdin back on me

Verse 3(Shawnna)
Everytime I get to thinking bout you
I see I can't be without you
Cause you that shit, that's it
And I really can't leave right now boo
You my fix, your kiss
Made me bout to let go bout to
But wait right quick can't slip
I don't really think your down with this
See I played these games before
And I fall everytime we go
Cause see I can't no more
I move slow but don't really wanna stop the flow
Don't know what to do
Gotta just relax and hold back
Just sit back and roll that, roll that, rolle that

Chorus(Mya and Marques Houston)

Why you tryna hold back

When you know you want it just like I do
Wht you acting like that, girl don't do me like that

Better then I ever seen it done before,
A lot of women drop it to the ground,
But how low can you go?
Lower then your mama's ever seen it in her life time,
Never would've imagined did not even in her right mind,
Practice in front of that mirror,
Now you doing it on the dance floor,

From A-T-L-A-N-T-A and all the way down to your block,
Put the needle on a record and I make her get lower than a Lamborghini,
And if she really gettin' low then I'm a shoot a video and put it all on T-V,
Cause I like that French vanilla and the caramel,
But when it comes to chocolate,
I know that very well,

No discrimination,

Now baby you should know that it ain't that serious

How could you tell me that you love me
When I know you were just trying to play me
But you're the fool
'Cause I know how to switch the game up on you
And in the end I know who will lose

I played this game before
And I can't play no more
What do you take me for
It's not what you thought
So don't play games with me
'Cause I play to teach
And if you want to cheat
It won't be with me

It's not that serious
I never put that much thought into us
It wasn't that I loved you
I was curious

Who did you think that you were involved with
Now baby you should know that it ain't that serious
It should concern you that I'm always one step ahead of you
So that should let you know that what you do
I have done before, it's nothing new
So run those games on someone who can't be fooled

I can almost see lies coming through your teeth
In every word you speak you make it clear to me
That you're playing wrong and your game ain't strong
I've been in this too long, so just be moving on

It's not that serious
I never put that much thought into us
It wasn't that I loved you
I was curious

Who did you think that you were involved with
Now baby you should know
It's not that serious
I never put that much thought into us
It wasn't that I loved you

Who did you think that you were involved with
Now baby you should know

Tú me haces reir todas las veces que
Tú creías que yo no sabía que
Tú estabas haciendo
Tú sabes que yo ha sido todo eso antes

Shawnyette Harrell,"I've been so caught up in the thought of me and you
Even though I love someone else, I know my heart belongs to you
Tell me how did we
Ever let the situation get this far
Maybe we should just
Try to hide the things we feel inside
Things I know we can't deny

Should've never told you that I cared about you
Didn't think that it would be so bad
Should've never kissed you
Should've never held your hand

Gotta find a way to let these feelings go
What did I do the day I let you slip into my soul (My soul)
It was then, when I realized that I would always want you in my life (In my life)
No one else, can know of the things that we were saying on the telephone
It would be, so bad if they ever knew that me and you were secretly into each other

Should've never told you that I cared about you
Didn't think that it would be so bad
Should've never kissed you
Should've never held your hand

Gotta find a way to let these feelings go
Oh, I'm so scared, trembling inside 'cause I'm feelin' like somebody else already knows
Oh, my God, I love you boy so much but to have to choose between the two,
Is hurting me so deep inside

Should've never told you that I cared about you
Didn't think that it would be so bad
Should've never kissed you
Should've never held your hand

Which one of you ugly muthafuckers think you thug enough or rugg enough
Or gutter enough, fast enough to keep up wit’ me
The most retarded motherfucker in the whole wide world
Ain’t stupid or dumb enough to fuck with me
If you in say you in, and if you is handle your mutherfuckin’ business
Knuckle up, buckle up, hustle up, huddle up. What we gonna do? Win!
Not a nan’ ‘nother nigga outta there can compare
To what I do to these boys on these bars and these scales
In these clubs in these bars on these tables and chairs
I need that

I’m like a great white shark in this aquarium
When I was young, I knew kids out caroling
Around the holidays, they were pistol carrying
In the spare, getting paper was imperative
I'm reaching in my pocket, only thing there was lint
Well I compare with then, don’t want to spare a cent
We suited up in all black, in a pair of tens

Shawty Lo,"It?s Okay
Tomorrow?ll be a better day

When ya rent a day late and ya tryna stay straight
But the only way to get it is to slang that weight
Okay, tomorrow?ll be a better day

We all Came in the world with a sparkle in our eye
Not knowing the only thing that we can promise is to die
A promise is a lot can?t nobody guarantee it
And death around the corner can?t nobody damn see it
I can?t agree that God good at all time
But we all know shit ain't all good at all time
So I tote my strap in the hood and all time
But respect ain't just something that?s understood in our time
Especially by our kind man I hate it for the future
Police don?t wanna lock ya up no more they wanna shoot ya
And that's half as bad as these hatas?ll do ya
As soon as ya get ya loot up they wanna shoot up
Lord forbid to kill me I bet ya nobody knew what
Suckas get shot and police come straight to us
And that jus how they do us ever since niggas blew up
I know ya goin through it know I?m goin through it too bruh

When ya rent a day late and ya tryna stay straight
But the only way to get it is to slang that weight
Okay, tomorrow?ll be a better day

When ya daughter like 6 and her pops ain't shit
You ain't wanna tell her you and momma gotta go strip
Okay, tomorrow?ll be a better day

I?m doin this for the hood and the kid wit no dad
I was just like ya?ll don?t feel so bad
Know it?s hard when ya live so bad
They whoop ya ass and they wonder why ya still so bad
For long, ya get whoopin?s and just laugh
Momma washin? clothes and find a lil? blue bag
She ask what ya what ya doin ya tell her stuntin? like my daddy
You knew that I was gonna be a hustla when ya had me
Look around ma you sent me to the store to get some bread
And I?m passin? atleast 8 J?s or mo?
Rent been late for 8 days or mo?
But slangin? blow a better habit than 8 days of snow

Ya out speedin' wit the white and ya see the blue lights
And ya on ya 3rd strike so the judge say life
Okay, tomorrow?ll be a better day

If ya son 14 and his dad a folk criminal
Hard to realize it Baby girl but god with ya
Okay, tomorrow?ll be a better day

My momma girl son 14 just got killed
Had to catch myself
Bout to tell her I know how ya feel
I?d a been a damn liar
See her tryin not to cry
She know he in a better place
But she just wanna know why
Know somebody touch mine
And a nigga gon? die
It?s goin down
How dare I tell her to calm down
I tried to convince her that he in God?s arms now
She said I don?t believe that there's a God right now
I know its hard right now and ya heart light now
But God give new begginins you can start right now
Know ya scarred right now 'cause you apart right now
But Shit you in better shape than we are right now

When ya rent a day late and ya tryna stay straight
But the only way to get it is to slang that weight
Okay, tomorrow?ll be a better day

When ya daughter like 6 and her pops ain?t shit
You ain't wanna tell her you and momma gotta go strip
Okay, tomorrow?ll be a better day

Ya out speedin' wit the white and ya see the blue lights
And ya on ya 3rd strike so the judge say life

And boy, we don't care who you calling
Nothing can save you now

Shotta youts will run up in your apartment
So unno betta mind where you walking
Goddamn man, can to your target
Nothing can save you know

See you dun push the wrong button
And cross the wrong line
Stepped on the wrong shoe

Time and time
They get me out the tandem
Me are da true, I traded mine in
For caveman king

You don't wanna fuck with
The Southside Gotcha boys
Y'all ain't know trill ass niggas
Y'all some boxy boys

And pull shots on boys
Scattered like a roach
And put that on the fifth
I'm the nigga you don't wanna approach

I was raised in the heart of the jungle
The belly of the beast
And this lick here sweet, I'm so flawed
You can put me on the front line
Ass back nicks, I don't represent the gun shy
Thing about the street life

Homie, I live, wear my heart on my sleeve
And niggas gotta fear life

Shoot you people while you sleeping
The grim reaper is out to lunch

Put holes in you mouth so you can't be found
And Khaled got my back
He gon' shoot a hundred rounds
So say hello to death
If you ever in my town

I came from the eggs of a goddess
And the balls of a gigolo
All I had was 2 ounces
An old Chevy and Figaro
Blood shed apart my feet

And bad vibes got a nigga rocking voodoo deep
Lord forgive me, I know not a better way
And pop has tried to stick me
Damn I need some better ye

Ring the alarm, tell 'em people come, come
Look at what the fuck the Briscgun, yeah

I'm an orphin
And leave a hole in his head
Like a dolphin
Fuck a hole in one, ain't golfin'
I'ma put his whole unit in a coffin

'Cause any nigga fuck wit my pocket
I'ma open his ass off, like suicide doors
Any badass niggas, y'all scared of that lake
I'ma tell you once don't be scared of the Dre

You have no idea why you started
But guess this is your final warning
And boy, we don't care who your calling
Nothing can save you now

I'm usually cool, but know I gotta bet back
I tried telling ya, ain't wit'cha death threats
I let my nigga know, tell 'em go hammer that
And it ain't gon' take all day
We know where you live at

I'll bet ya hide from ya neighbors
Keep 'em mad shawty
That's how we kill 'em babies

Look at me it's shawty
So bossy, and I don't feel like that
Can't stop me now, now, now
You see what's happening?

Shoot a lil dice blow a lil' loud
Sell a lil' powder make a few thou',
Turn them into millions standing tall as Yao

Ooh they hate my swag, cause these bars is Alaska
Hip-hop police got me workin' under the scanner
Coca cola where’s the water? Watch this doe I serve this order
One on the window, cause the police just might smell this odor

Ah but please now don't you take her from me, London Danny

Well I've learned to listen for your name round town
Whe people talk of your success in city life
But I could never tell if she heard them talk as well
Or rue the day she ever was a poor man's wife

Chorus

For she always said that time would make it right
But now I always hear her sighing in the night
And don't think I don't know, if you asked her then she'd go
Ah but please now don't you take her from me, London Danny

Well me' hands are black while yours are clean and clever
There's ways you know to turn her pretty head
Well its all that I can do when me' working day is through
To let her heart beat me to sleep each night in bed

Chorus

For she always said that time would make it right
But now I always hear her sighing in the night
And don't think I don't know, if you asked her then she'd go
Ah but please now don't you take her from me, London Danny

Well London Danny you're a real bad penny
The one man time has told me I should fear
For the girl you left behind, she said she would be mine
So why did you have to come and show your face round here

Chorus

For she always said that time would make it right
But now I always hear her sighing in the night
And don't think I don't know, if you asked her then she'd go
Ah but please now don't you take her from me, London Danny",London Danny,1996
"Shay, Michael & Martin Black","Adam and Eve on a Saturday night
That's when the trouble started
She said to Adam, ""Let's go get a bite""
And she nipped in to the garden
And ever since we try to make sense
Of this mystery in motion
Well you might as well try
To count stars in the sky
Or the raindrops in the ocean
You know it's...

Chorus

True love
Deeper than deep
Hotter than a fire
Well it's hard to find
And hard to keep
It's the thing we most desire

I was alone for so many nights
I really started to wonder
If I had run out of chances to find
A spell that I could fall under
And you walked in
Like in a Elvis film
You were singing ""Love Me Tender""
I was hypnotized by your blue eyes
And the next thing I remember
You know it was...

Chorus

True Love
Deeper than deep
Hotter than a fire
Well it's hard to find
And hard to keep
It's the thing we most desire

And there is true love in a winking eye
And a sweet perfume that lingers
It's an ""I love you"" on a new tattoo
It's the diamond on her finger

You know that it's...

Shaye,"So you've come to this bridge
In an unfamiliar land
You know it's a bridge you are going to walk on
And the only thing you know is
Everything you know
Will do you no good from here on

And the day that you spin
From your little cocoon
Well, you can't be prepared
For the beauty you'll find there
And you will find beauty
In the toughest of places
And I will be thinking of you out there

So pick up your bags
Look around at your friends
And you know none of them
Would ever have enough strength
To cross the bridge and lose control
I never felt this bold
Never felt this good

And the day that you spin
From your little cocoon
Well, you can't be prepared
For the beauty you'll find there
And you will find beauty
In the toughest of places
And I will be thinking of you

Stay true to your nomad skies
Keep your eyes out for coyote
A thousand secrets are lost
In the archival dust
So lay your ears upon the tracks

One day you will come back
With wrinkled hands and grey hair
And there you will stand on the spot
And you'll marvel how the place is still the same
Though you are somebody else now
Fly on butterfly

And the day that you spin
From your little cocoon
Well, you can't be prepared
For the beauty you'll find there
And you will find beauty
In the toughest of places
And I will be thinking of you out there",Beauty,2003

Waiting half the day

Knocked to the ground

Nobody's been saved

I notice that you've been cryin' over him
And I wonder why you just don't
Kick him to the curb instead of bein' with him

That's when you think that everything's fine
No one ever thinks it's gonna end

But when things go wrong and winter comes
You're gonna need to run to someone
Left alone you'll just freeze up again

But you should know
When it gets too cold
You're not alone
I'll melt the snow

Some nights I can hear you
Screamin' on the phone over somethin' that he did
And I wonder what can I do
To make you throw him out so you can let me in

I used to think that we could work it out
I used to think that if we had some problems
I always thought if there was love around
No matter what, I always thought we'll solvin'

Now, everyday we're in an argument
It's like a circle that don't ever end
We're keepin' secrets and we're tellin' lies

Girl, I thought that we would always have them
I used to make you laugh like all the time
Now, I don't ever, we got a problem

Lately, you never ask about my day
And on the phone we got nothing to say

A way that we can work it out
Girl, we're runnin' outta time
And the thought of a break up is tearing me up inside

We can work it out, if we talk about it
We can show the world that you and I are fighting for it
We'll get through the worst and I know we'll make it
If we stay together we'll make it through alive

See it finally hit me how much

Stumbling out of bed
I grabbed my phone and called ya
But you were M-I-A so I decided
To stay right here
Picked up a pen before I knew I had it

With some Vivaldi magic
See every love before this
I had was truly tragic
That's why I'm happy to say

Exactly what you and I've been doing

But like a jigsaw puzzle it's been torn all apart
 
A million words couldn't say just how I feel
A million years from now you know I'll be loving you still
 
The nights are lonely the days are so sad and
I just keep thinking about the love that we had
And I'm missing you
And nobody knows it but me
 
Ooh ooh yeah
 
Tomorrow morning I'm a hit a dusty road
Gonna find you wherever wherever you might go
And I'm gonna unload my heart and hope you come back to me

And when his eyes go dead the hell 
I send him to will seem like heaven after what I've done to him

Yo, time on my hands
Running fast like Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Hit the Jackie Rob
Cop the Hershey
Spark the bark for the ride back to the Galaxy
Back, back, down, forward, kick
That's a fatality
For Liu Kang, turn to a dragon then a raven
Ain't no professor that can fuck with this verbatim
Your style is prenatal
I got the hand that rock the cradle
Fully auto mac under the table
Jewish platters, kreplach soups and sable
If you ain't stable, don't hang around cause I enable
Drug use, dick sucks from a fiend
Rib eye steaks that still on a bone
Me and my team shine
Like hologram fishscale right off the Greek coast
Toast to greats with bubbles
Three states, three cases, no traces
I'm the ace to shovels
So sick, muthafucka cover face with muzzles (Yeah!)
Flushing, Queens, twenty seven years strong
Where you think you're gonna run to when the tears gone
And reality set just like the sun do
Ain't trying to have my babies raised up in the slum, true!

C'mon, you son of a bitch
Damn, he's slick

No love for snitch niggas trying to serenade the precinct
Singing about granulated onions that ain't used for seasoning
My mind is off, this life gave me a different type of reasoning
I'm so New York that I could rep it from a different region
Slay heffers, Ottomanelli's got 'em in telly's
We eat good, Turkish cuisine, Ottoman belly's
We sit in whips and our whips sit on Pirelli's
While we're getting dick sucks, my whole team is Akinyele's
Put in their mouth, let 'em give 'em second chances
I'm known for finger banging bitches giving table dances
Open my flip book, see me posted in the sickest stances
Glorious garments, you could get some style by taking glances
Red snapper, taken apart, put back together
Plated on some bok choy, fine fish platters forever (Yo!)
Same routine, another day, a new endeavor
I usually rock a power piece under a Polo leather

I write left, think right, need the box tight
Mind blowing dome cause I always eat the box right
Make believers out of haters, haters out of homies
Bring my fam to the top so I ain't lonely
I'm with the team, cuisine like we celebrating
Contemplate the takeover when we delegating
Get it shaking like a dancer at Perfections
Catch us in a European coupe, it's never rented, kid
Been getting it, circle full of amateurs
See great rappers smoking seeded up cannabis
Fucking embarrassment, we cooler than a Vick's rub
You the type to trick it all night at a strip club
I'm the type to bag a stripper out front
Take her back, line a twenty up and get my shit sucked (Yeah!)
That's what you do when you flyer than Goldblum
Purple label loafers, paying homage to the old school

I'm from Brooklyn, the reason why I walk with a bop
Same reason I don't fuck with the cops
My borough is thorough, if any nigga try to tell me it's not
I'll leave his face bloodied up, all covered in knots
We break bread at the table with made niggas and sip wine
And graduate from little niggas, now we living big time
I'm in a state of mind like Nas in his prime
That real New York talk, home of gritty and grime
Check it, I got the cleanup, Bronsonelli's batting lead off
Your mother's mouth is the place where I drop my seeds off
Hop in the Lamborghini, middle finger speed off
D's are getting P'd off, they're present, drop the weed off
I'm like a cross between Stoudemire and Carmelo

Peace to Lonnie Londell
Everything is Mar-vel
Kid, on this side we shine like the sun
Though the night brisk on the night shift
Peep the tight lips
Cause muthafucking loyalty is priceless
Fly bitch blow me harder than a vuvuzelo
My mood is mellow
Catch me hopping out the Cougar, yellow
Brew the Bustelo, Brosonlino
Smooth as Othello in convertible Z3's bruising the pedal
Chief of command, it's hard for you to try to see me
Your team ain't ready to win a war like Mussolini
Harsh as a Russian winter
Still we dining at Lupa right there on Bleecker and Thompson
Eating a custom dinner
Wine served, about a third of the glass filled
Premium rap skills, lounging in the Catskills
Let me end this with a kiss from my bitch
One love, Bronsonlino, signing off
Who better than this, kid?

Luxury sports apparel is what I rock to cover feet
I feel like everyday is Thanksgiving
That's how we usually eat
Rep the street, my flow is heat
Queens made me complete
When we outside deep
It's like a Double L retreat
You know my status, everything's Mar-vel
Hard shell shots will tear you up
Now you scar well
Bizarre hell, I'll take you there
Never fear nothing, not me
Shellfish specialist, I'll eat it if it's from the sea
Action Bronson is in the building
So it smells like half a key
He's usually smoking marijuana in a jacket past his knee
Yeah, we live this, still crispest
Back to business, fuck bitches
Most of y'all were living blind until I hit the light switches
Peace to my dress code and my way of life
Super trife, slay your wife
Ask about the way Lauren can lay the pipe
Never duplicated, wordplay is custom made
Niggas know my steez
Catch me in Queens covered in suede (word up!)

The fine fabric delegates
And Peter Pan Posse
This the finale, Youtube is where the fans watch me
High definition, Lo religion
Loving Scottie Pippen's
Switched it from Jordan Dream Team
It hurt the slutty women
Love to collab, I used to dabble in a couple of things
Facelift the Team, Outdoors, where the Men's will be
Cop Killer Queens, the Upper East, we need a gallery
We unscripted, real drama, never no fallacies
I might party like a rock star for a couple of days
A couple strays tag along taking bumps of K
I keep a Buddha, little liquor, make me triple stack
Ideal wifey, small titties and a lot of ass
They call me Shaz, before it was my government
Unholy covenant, could never get enough of it

So pay attention when this rich bong's broken in half
And don't get left behind to choke on my gas
Ginger ale, juggle, Gen Pop, pockets intact
Prime king in the booth
I got it like that
But wait, audible react
Don't get caught in the trap
Real recognize real
And see it's part of the act
I break hearts, surround sound
With the sermon I spit
And leave behind a trail of permanent drips
In a room full of douchebags burning their lips
And bugging out about the right amount of water to mix
The freebase specialist, I dug him a ditch
Struggling with that addiction's a son of a bitch, fucko
I'll give you something to fix, get sober
You'll understand when you're older
The rap Al Bundy got the handicapped boner
Hot breath and the ice cold shoulder
So, give me room so my set can breathe
I'm from the Up East, plus I got connects in Queens
So how you want it?
Bent, skeed or straight blunted
My rap good like Deer Park in your stomach

Incredible Hulk, flash the villainous smile
He trying to stay young, he's never going out of style
Fresh to death like the corpse out the morgue
The new slang stay stiff, pause
No shirt when he record
Stay zoned, known to kick rap through payphones
Mighty Healthy set the tones
Spread the wealth through fly poems
Well known rap flesh
Keep it tight like close homies
And never known to flip like a Solid Gold Cody
Known to keep it scummy like a Sunday at Jones Beach
Known to keep it bummy like a Sunday at Centre Street
Known for having fun, blacking out, that's the motto
@toechamp, twitter game you should follow
US Weekly with the centerfold
A thousand tapes pressed up
A thousand tapes sold
Kids screaming out, ""when the mixtape coming?""

Tikaman menjadi pedih yang di dalami jiwa..oww
Siang malam termenung sedih bebankan hati
Tak pernah ku ingat ku boleh dilukai begini
Namun ku cakap hatiku tuk melupakan mu ku tahu bukan begitu 
Come on!
Masa berlalu jiwa dan ragaku katakn pada pendengarku
Selamat tinggal oh kasih
Janganlah iri hati

More than I am

Is who I wanted to be
And now that we're together

Oh, it's a beautiful thing
Don't think I can keep it all in
And if you ask me why I've changed
All I gotta do is say your sweet name

She Wants Revenge,"It's getting late and we're both tired
Driving the awkward drive
Paying half attention as you're pointing the way
But our thoughts are racing double the time

You told me your stories, I told you mine
But there's so much we neglected to say
Driving back home I had to turn right around
There was something that I needed to ask you

Why can't I just spend the night?
It's cold outside and there's no place else I can go 
And it feels so right
Why can't I just spend the night? 
We'll keep our clothes on and we'll leave on the lights
Only if you like

The obsession got me stuck to the plan
I ran up the steps as my heart pumped fast
Then I knocked perhaps a bit too light
And she opened up the door wearing only her coat
And the smile that said ""this better be worth it""

She Wants Revenge,"Got a big plan, this mindset maybe it's right
At the right place and right time, maybe tonight
And the whisper or handshake sending a sign
Wanna make out and kiss hard, wait never mind

Late night, and passing, mention it flipped her
Best friend, its no thing maybe it slipped
But the slip turns to terror and a crush to light
When she walked in, he froze up, believe it's the fright

It's cute in a way, till you cannot speak
And you leave to have a cigarette, your knees get weak
An escape is just a nod and a casual wave
Obsessed about it, heavy for the next two days

It's only just a crush, it'll go away
It's just like all the others it'll go away
Or maybe this is danger and he just don't know
You pray it all away but it continues to grow

I want to hold you close
Skin pressed against me tight
Lie still, close your eyes girl
So lovely, it feels so right

I want to hold you close
Soft breasts, beating heart
As I whisper in your ear
I want to fucking tear you apart

Then he walked up and told her, thinking that he'd passed
And they talked and looked away a lot, doing the dance
Her hand brushed up against his, she left it there
Told him how she felt and then they locked in a stare

They took a step back, thought about it, what should they do
'Cause there's always repercussions when you're dating in school
But their lips met, and reservations started to pass
Whether this was just an evening or a thing that would last

Either way he wanted her and this was bad
Wanted to do things to her it was making him crazy
Now a little crush turned into a like
And now he wants to grab her by the hair and tell her

I want to hold you close
Skin pressed against me tight
Lie still, and close your eyes girl
So lovely, it feels so right

I want to hold you close

He said 'no touching tonight'

She said 'tuck me in'

Still he pulled back the sheets
And said

You better lie down 'cause the angels are watching

'you can hurt me do whatever you like'

She Wants Revenge,"She's like a ghost to me, drifting slowly.
Never wanting to stay, anticipation growing.
Blacked out with X's for eyes,
They won't lead you to answers.

Abandoned one too many times,
So she will not be taking chances.
And still she rules the day she took him
In her desperate way.

The stories of her past betrayals,
The list of names in the hush toned tales.
She should have offered up his name,
To place beside the ones she's blamed.

No matter how this hand is played.

Because you never wanna come back down.

Though she claims she found Jesus.

Her religion is killing me,
License to do as she pleases.
Never mind consequence,
That's a folly of weakness.

And she really believes this.

But we'll level the playing field tonight.

And no more murder, no more lies.

She Wants Revenge,"There's a poem that she wrote and hid under the mattress,
And if you find it please leave it alone.
With a picture she took of a girl on the subway,
With orange barrettes and the saddest face she's ever known.

As Rachael starts to wonder was it hers to begin with,
Or was the memory from someone else's sleep.
Cause there's a hole in her heart that still harbors a question,
Whose answer just might break it so she's hanging on.
At least it's her to keep.
So I asked her

""What if this does not belong to you,
And all these things you thought were true
Turned out to just be someone else's lies.""
Baby this does not belong to you,
This does not belong to you,
This does not belong to you.

There's a fleck in her eye that no one ever noticed,
A pretty birthmark for such a beautiful face.
All the men from her past seem to have left her abandoned,
I guess there's some things that you can never erase.

I've seen her play with her hair in a moment of tension,
I've seen her with her guard down ready to cry.
But there's a whole in her heart that still harbors the question,
Whose answer just might break it, still she's hanging on,
Cause no one wants to die.
Then she asked me

""What if this does not belong to you,
And all the things you thought were true
Turned out to just be someone else's lies.""
Baby this does not belong to you,
This does not belong to you,
This does not belong to you.

""What if this does not belong to you,
And all the things you thought were true
Turned out to just be someone else's lies.""
Cause baby this does not belong to you,
This does not belong to you,
This does not belong to you.",Rachael,2007
She Wants Revenge,"Oh my lover look what you've done,
You've gone and took your love away.
It seemed to me the only way out was run,
Despite you're trying to beg me to stay.

It started as an honest attraction,
Began under the guise of a flirt.
Till you were screaming at the edge of the bed
""Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt!""

[Chorus]
You said
""Come back baby, please don't go,
Come back baby, please don't go,
Come back baby, please don't go,
Come back baby, you hurt me so.""
Wake me on the other side,
You can hold your breath,
I'll be dreaming she's easy.
We can always say we tried,
If we both come clean, maybe then you can please me.
Wake me on the other side,
You can hold your breath
As the thought of her drags her down.
She cries like a baby
And she only learned to dream in sound.

Oh my lover the clock runs slow
Ever since the day you went away.
And though I've tried a hundred ways to forget you,
Still the emptiness is always the same.

No matter who is lying beside me
All it does is make me wish it were you.
And if I close my eyes tight I can almost pretend,
And for a moment it's as if it were true.
You said

[Chorus]

You can't pin it all on me,
The blame is mine to bear.
With all the things I've done to you,
We're far beyond repair.

But still sometimes I think of us,
And how things fell apart.
And how you knew from the first kiss
That I would break your hears.

She Wants Revenge,"She buys a new dress for the party,
She always looks good in red.
Turns around in front of the mirror
And disappears inside of her head.

She wonders if he'll even remember,
She asked him in a casual way.
Just in case he didn't want to go with her,
In that event she knew just what she would say.

She thought of maybe asking a girlfriend,
Even though she only has one or two.
She's always done much better with boys anyway,
So who needs girlfriends?

Pacing nervous across the floor of her bedroom,
Gripping tight the phone in her hand.
Fighting beck the rush of emotions,
And dreaming of just having a man.

[Chorus]
It's a long walk, and the music is loud.
She sees an old friend,
As she walks through the crowd.
Puts on her best smile,
But underneath she's a broken girl.
But It's a long walk, and the music is loud.
She sees an old friend,
As she walks through the crowd.
Puts on her best smile,
But she will always be a broken girl.

She struggles with an awful decision,
Stay at home or walk in alone.
Her mother does her best to console her,
Her father doesn't know what to say.

Puts on her makeup, puts on the new dress.
Holds her head high, then gets in the car.
Tells herself that no one will notice,
Assuming she can make it that far.

On the way she imagines reactions.
Cupped hands whispering into ears.
Secretly hoping that he'll be there watching,
And she's also hoping he won't.

Walking tentative alone up the driveway,
Sees some people smoking off to the side.
She stops and waits until they go back in,
Crosses her fingers and follows behind.

[Chorus]

He'll never get you,
He will never understand.
He'll never get you, you can find a better man.

Love is all you need.

You could walk away so clean?

Strange ceiling again,
Though you swore
You'd stay home and read,

And not their mouth,
So they don't look in your eyes.
You lie down exhausted

And riddled with doubt,
Then wait 'til they're sleeping
And sneak towards the door,
Careful not to make noise
Across the creaky wood floors...

Not knowing they?re building hopes and dreams on sand
They soon are disappointed (disappointed)
So like a good day (good day) depends on sunshine (on sunshine)
And like the harvest depends on the time
Like the tide needs the moon
My heart depends on you (My heart depends on you)
Ooo oo oooo ooooo

On Your Holy Word I am standing
For every word is true
That?s why I?m trusting in You
Like a comedian needs to be funny
And like a banker depends on money
Like a bride needs a groom
My heart depends on you (My heart depends on you)
Ooo oo oooo ooooo

On Your Holy Word I am standing
For every word is true
That?s why I?m trusting in You
I trust You

(Repeat x2, then out) (After x2, simultaneously)
My heart depends on you You know my heart
My heart depends on you You know my heart
My heart depends on you You know my heart
My heart Depends on You

Just like the flower depends on rainfall
Just like a good day depends on blue skies
My heart depends on yooooou

Sheb Wooley,"As I was slowly passing 
An orphan's home one day, 
I stopped for just a little while 
To watch the children play. 
Alone a boy was standing 
And when I asked him why, 
He turned with eyes that could not see 
And he began to cry. 

I'm nobody's child, 
I'm nobody's child. 
Just like the flowers 
I'm growing wild. 
I got no mummy's kisses 
I got no daddy's smile. 
Nobody wants me, 
I'm nobody's child. 

No mummy's arms to hold me 
Or sue me when I cry, 
'Cause sometimes I feel so lonesome 
I wish that I could die. 
I'll walk the streets of heaven 
Where all blinds can see. 

And just like for the other kids 
It will be a home for me. 

I'm nobody's child, 
I'm nobody's child. 
Just like the flowers 
I'm growing wild. 
I got no mummy's kisses 
I got no daddy's smile.

It had the one long horn, one big eye
I commenced to shakin' and I said ""ooh-eee""

It was a one-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater
(One-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater)
A one-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater
Sure looks strange to me (one eye?)

Well he came down to earth and he lit in a tree
I said Mr. Purple People Eater, don't eat me
I heard him say in a voice so gruff
""I wouldn't eat you 'cause you're so tough""

It was a one-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater

I said Mr. Purple People Eater, what's your line?
He said ""eatin' purple people and it sure is fine
But that's not the reason that I came to land
I want to get a job in a rock and roll band""

Well bless my soul, rock and roll, flyin' purple people eater
Pigeon-toed, under-growed, flyin' purple people eater
(We wear short shorts) friendly little people eater 
What a sight to see (oh!) 

And then he swung from the tree and he lit on the ground
And he started to rock, really rockin' around
It was a crazy ditty with a swingin' tune
(Sing a boop-boop, a-boopa lopa lum bam boom)

Well, bless my soul, rock and roll, flyin' purple people eater

If I don't like you, I'ma kill you not fight you
I bite a little piece of your ear off like Mike do
And everybody gon' follow me now
Down eighth and an Uzi mahogany brown
Fagots want you to kill 'em in a hurry
It fucks me up, like they aint got no money to get buried

Just to see clear, to tell the truth I can't breathe a Ki
Lick a shot for the stick up kids that twist up wigs
that's the shit that happens when you pick up bids
Lick a shot for the foreign car, American trucks
Old timers that'll throw a stack of presidents up
Got dice shooter slang, need a pistol to hang
But the P understand cause the ghetto is fucked

Running around unsupervised with sharp objects
Lick shots for papi that give you the yay half price

Lick shots when your diesels at ten, I'ma see you again
Lick shots cause my record is clean
Middle of the street, broad day lettin' it scream
If I'm lucky they'll squirt through your back
And after that I'll make sure I lick shots for the purple and yack
Lick shots just to guard your grill
To my nigga T and Green and my uncle and Arthur Kill
Lick shots for the S-L 6

Your gun is in the closet flippin'
Talkin' bout I get the most action he about to soak me up

So I went to the closet said ""Hammer what's wrong with you?""

You ain't busting me off, it's like I don't belong to you

I said I just beat a case daddy
And I'm trying to take it easy cause I gotta move this weight daddy
Then the hammer said

Man listen, used the knife twice in a row
Tell me if the plan switchin'
Cause we used to get around together
We used to put niggas down together, tell me if it's now or never

I said hammer take it easy baby
'Cause I got niggas to kill and I would never do you greasy baby

But nobody believe that my haze talk to me
I got a story to tell, my money talk to me

I hawk niggas down, bust arteries

And he get bright red for me
Knife you my nigga but leave me alone
I got to talk to my man Haze to get in the zone
I said ""Haze what the hell is up?""

You know how we do, you know that we crew
So where's the vanilla dutch

Rolling something up, 
Thinking about killing every rapper in the game
And holding something up

You need to calm down when the rage come to you
'Fore a grave or a cage or a gauge come to you
But you don't give a fuck 
So just open up your book and let your page come to you

I don't give a fuck
You ain't tryin' to hear me I'ma shoot through your mobile
It's funny, I'll stalk you
Hold up my niggas, it ain't a convo 'less your money start talking

My money spoke to me
It said shit that if it wasn't for his ass there wouldn't be no hope for me
Money ain't everything, and then he laughed at me
And said the hammer oughta blast at me
He said I got you out of jail, paid for the lawyer and bail
Take a look at the cars and the crib
I keep the clothes on your back, food in your mouth
Even paid for the birds when you moved niggas south
Shit, I'm the reason why the block jumping
Let a nigga try to stop something, D-Block'll pop something
And I'm the reason why you ride or die
Keep a lot of me by your side, shoot niggas in the eye

Plus I'm street like powder, milk, and government cheese
If you a runnin' man nigga, then I'ma shoot up your knees

Then it's me against the world, man against machine
S.D.T.S. - stick to my routine
My knuckle game impeccable, crack game incredible
Lawyers for my niggaz who be sittin' in the Federal
Nigga, I'm untouchable

[Chorus]

Lyrically I'm, untouchable..
Infa-Red nigga, let's go..

All I can know is 365 days of pain
My name, how to sell cocaine
And I was taught to buy guns so big when I go to the roof
I can aim and shoot down a plane

Infa-Red's my name but fuck all that
Fall back and witness how the streets made me the grimiest nigga alive
I sell you a fake pie, shoot out your fake eye
Give niggaz a break, nah; I gotta chase mine

Don't wear your watch around me nigga I take time
Like niggaz that them blue tried to like
I turn men to mice, canary yellow my ice
And Ruff Ryde on anybody, to be precise

But I handle my business like I'm supposed to
When you go in the precinct, that's the only time you see my poster
But I could post up and get rid of my pieces
I own collies sellin' rocks the size of Domino pizzas

I'm untouchable, nigga

[Chorus]

Double R.. whoo! All day..
Yo, aiyyo X let me get 'em daddy - yo, yo, yo

U-N-T-O-U-C-H, A-B-L-E-S
Sheek the new Elliott Ness (no doubt)
Nigga, Bloodline, D-Block; two of the best
Hang the Double are chain from the side of the car

Drive by and put your brains on the side of the bar
Sheek heavy in the hood (uh-huh)
And I don't mean cause I gained weight in the hood (nah)
My aim is good, aiyyo X what they want it to be here?

Our hammer's cocked, outside of the house on the lawn chair
Yeah nigga what? The new rap LeBron's here
Get 'em dog, we the new America's nightmare
And we don't say much, we just get it on

That's why we don't get touched, y'all like a dutch
Hands all on you, I'm tryna warn you
to stay in your place, so you don't get laced
And them pretty ass shades, can stay on your face

[Chorus]

[Drag-On]
Uhh, uhh, uhh, come on!
You motherfuckers got me back on my grizzly, I'm back on the grind
I'm back to the streets, catch a beef, come back with the nine
I'll murder ya man, come back with his shines

I tote two guns, I don't care if you box, I don't care if you blind
I spit in your eye like niggaz is eatin, I'm splittin the pies
Frank Nitty your rap, how gritty am I? The city is mine
Yeah, you get in my way I pity your moms

Yeah, my block is real, my niggaz is armed
My borough is thorough, we bang with each other
I'm switchin' my diamonds and changin' the color
with change of weather, canary in the sun, uhh

I bury ya nigga then bury the gun, X what up?
Me and you is untouchable (uh-huh)
We both had bricks they couldn't sniff cause the coke was uncrushable
Guns is fingerprint-proof, we ""Ryde or Die""
You drivin by, we clap at your ride, good-bye

Pardon me, LOX hooked up wit Rodney 
The Ferrari's teal, but the truck's mahogany 
Hating, I can't get you bastards off me

And I'm always in her so she can't divorce me 
Can't see farther than Kiss, I'm like a father to this

Thick shorty want to hop on it

Let me give it to your straight, I ain't spending no money

More than that, I'ma man, ya know what I mean (How I love you)
I'm in love, you my bitch, my bitch (How I love you)
Let's go

(Verse 1)
Uh
I used to dream about you watchin every move you made (yeah)
I was young though, I think third or second grade (ok)
I'd go home, write a poem, put it right to a beat
What I would do, what I would say if we would one day meet
Started getting older, still lovin your style
How you dressed, how you drove the whole 80's wild
I was proud when you first got on MTV (ooh)
You was in the video chillin with Run-DMC
That's my girl (that's my girl)
Little nigga fiendin to hit it
Knowin one day in the future I'd be right up in it
Started doin talent shows, I had it off the hook
You was there but you was too big, you wouldn't even look
I ain't mad you ain't noticed til I got with a group
But even then it wasn't nothin 'less I got in the coupe (Damn)
Got me goin crazy, every day you switch up on me
Puttin that in my face knowin me so horny
see'mon

(Chorus)
{Styles P}

(How I love you)
You all I got (all I got)
You all I want (all I want)
You all I need (all I need)
(How I love you)
From day 1 (day 1)
Till my death bed (til I die)
You all I breathe (uh huh)
(How I love you)
I'm disciplined (disciplined)
I'm dedicated (dedicated)
And determined too (determined)
(How I love you)
You got your ups and downs (ups and downs)
But I don't really mind (I don't mind)
I still ride wit you still ride

(Verse 2)
{Sheek}
Ok, listen
The group doin good (yeah), still in the hood (uh huh)
Got a nickname Sheek now you startin to speak (Sheek)
Said you want to fuck wit all three if that's ok (ok)
I'm like cool, once I hit it it was that anyway
A couple years gone passed, still havin a ball
A million times got the pictures on my wall
When I first hit it, I was like Sheek the man (you the man)
I stopped givin you the attention I originally planned
Then you stopped fuckin wit me (oh)
And left me alone
And people only seen you with Jada and P (That's my mans)
You even went around town and started doggin me bad (Damn)
But it was my fault ya know, I couldn't even get mad (Ok)
Had to grab the pen and pad and get right back
Write some more poems to your ass and get back on track (Whoo)
I ain't go no problems telling you I love you to death
And that I'm whipped
And my shit'll be blown if you skip
Let's go

(Chorus)
A'yo I had to hit the streets, they said you be out there a lot
And I can find you around any nigga out that's hot
Every club, every whip, every gambling spot
You know you'd rather be with me, you like to bug out
Love to bring the thug out
Plus I be keeping it tight
We even go to work together, let you play all night
Mad loud while I sit and I write
Haha
We gon' see the world together
But not on cable
All your friends lovin me, you even got me a label
Got the magazines lovin our relations
People love to hear us talk, DJ's record our conversations
You good around other people, 'specially kids
You make them happy, even brothers doin their bids
And I ain't jealous at all (uh uh), go out and spread your wings
And you can hang with Pop, just pick up the phone when it rings
Let's go

I ain't gon' lie to why'all, I'm whipped (whoo)

Sheek,"I don't know
Maybe we can make a change, maybe not

I'm tired of crying, I'm tired of living
I'm tired of niggaz, I'm tired of women
Just want to be myself
Keep the fame, keep the wealth, give me my health
Take me to a place where they a'int hating no more
Where I don't gotta raise the hammer and clap the four
Where I don't gotta kick your door and ask for more
Where I don't gotta dig your floor and ask for more, whoa
Where I don't gotta serve no heads, cook no coke
And there's no such thing as feds
And there's no such thing as AIDS
And little kids live the age to walk the stage
No little babies crying, mama a'int dying
Papa live at home, he got a steady job
Everybody fall, he don't gotta rob

[CHORUS]
Walk with me talk with me
Some times I just sit and think
You know it's hard to express it why'all
That's why I put it all in ink

Where we ain't black or white
Matter fact we are, but we don't have to fight, or kill
Maybe Malcom would have been alive still
Maybe Martin would have been able to chill
Maybe a black face on a dollar bill
I keep hope alive, that I stay alive
I think it's coming, I try not to drink and drive
A place where the death penalty is gone
No abortions, life only lives on
Nobody getting shot for their chains
And no hard labor jobs, we all using our brains
And you don't have to strip through school
Cover your body mama, everything is cool
Let you daughter know here moms is smart
And that's your heart, before you tear her apart
I think I'm asking for too much man

[CHORUS]
No murders on the 5 o'clock news
No bodies over Jordan tennis shoes
Nobody laying on me, waiting to blast
I feel the spirits of my niggaz that past
It's like they right here, I just can't see them
Sometimes I'm jealous of them, damn I want to be them
Everybody fake, when will this ever end
If you don't know your enemy, the you don't know your friend
A place where there's no more wars, no more tears, no more liquor, no more beers
No more stocks, no more shares, no more fights, no more jails, no more kites
A place where you don't value money, just the air you breathe
And every day is sunny
I know it can never happen and it's just rappin
And I'm dreamin, again

We could let it drop or we could let it pop
Make your decision 'fore I make my incision
Head on collision, head-body division
Spirit fly away like a motherfuckin' pigeon
Take that to your grave, why'all niggaz behave

[Chorus:]
Yeah, D-Block is knockin', turn it up
We got it poppin', turn it up
We comin' for why'all, turn it up
Niggaz they droppin', turn it up
We got the streets locked, turn it up
If it's beef let your heat cock, turn it up
Welcome to D-Block, turn it up
'Cause we don't fuck around

What, that nigga Sheek is the truth
You would think he had a stripper inside how he go hard in the booth
Lazer on the roof, squeeze off then poof
Presto magic, like where did his chest go?
Think not homie, got a ziploc on me
Of that sticky icky in the pocket of my dickie
Just drunk a half of sixty, kinda bended
Hat low, knockin, bout to fuck up the rented
I'm a general, I stepped up from a lieutenant
This is D-Block, join us, don't get offended
'Cause I ain't lettin' up and you ain't lettin' off
Plus I already know that most of why'all is soft
The hood love me, put it in the air for me
And boy cop mixtapes if they don't hear from me
Got cake but occasionally you catch me bummy
I'm too smart on the streets you fuckin' dummy

[Chorus:]

A'yo, real niggaz relate to me
Jealous niggaz can't wait to send the shell of a tray-eight through me
Don't miss cause it's uh-oh like Lumi
Sun out, Sheek make the sky get gloomy
I bail it all to you, I give you my life
I write it in ink or blood, nigga pass my knife
I'm takin' it there, even if they give me the chair
I'm blacked out in the gear, Huey new in the wear
My fist stuck screamin' black power
I ain't gon' lie, that shit could wash off in the shower
'Cause I don't care what color you are
Nigga clap at the kid, the kid tryna levitate your car
I'm not a star
I'm a nigga that'll issue the star
I'm that nigga wit his hammer on him, at the bar
Sheek a straight up crook who got you shook
A'yo Alchemist, bring in the hook

Jadakiss dropped a solo they lovin' his voice
I'm lovin' his shit but the hood thought it was moist
Styles P dropped Gangsta and a Gentleman
Hard, no need to speak but the promotion was weak
Sheek never had solo plans
Till I dropped a freestyle in the studio with some a my mans
Lobson tweaked that, Mario leaked that
Your shit hot you could bring the muhfuckin streets back
Nah, I dunno I'm just tryin' get a label
Sit behind the desk you know, watch a lil' cable
Put my lil' man out, throw a few grand out
Get into some pop music, put a rock band out
Got wit my nigga K, cool and Whop
Green Lantern had my shit on the block (Hold me down)
Killed it in Flex now these labels tryin' to jump on our cock
If we could get Sheek album we'll sign D-Block
P and Kiss was like fuck that we gettin' you off

Welcome to D-Block, the city of broke down dreams
Where things ain't always peachy keen as they seem
City of dope dealers, killers, pimps, pushers
Panhandlers, hustlers and doped out fiends
The sun don't shine here, in this part of town
But we all got a town that's similar to this too
Say every city's got a ghetto, every ghetto's got a hood
Take a good look around you 'cause there's a D-Block near you

A place where ain't nobody that proud, it's a fucking black cloud
That got people under the impression they can act wild
Word get around though, 'cause if you can pull a trigger on the pound yo
5 minutes flat, the whole town know
Lotta assuming a niggas' salary
More lies than truth definitely more rumors than reality
Only way you beating a body is a technicality
Other than that catch 'em in Clinton on the gallery
The determination and dedication and discipline
Listening and catching the jewels that you was missing
And they still doing coward shit
You know the hate is gonna always be heavy but the love overpowers it
Something in the air but the older they get
They kill you quicker over a girl than over a brick
We don't play with the lizards, we make phrases up and say 'em exquisite
Anytime you can pay us a visit

Its D-Block, the part of Yonkers I wouldn't be caught
Without two pistols on me that'll be cocked in each pocket
D-Block don't even stop to talk, you just keep walking
Stick up kids every block who watch for that free opportunity
As soon as you leave out that jewelry shop
And you won't even notice your mind will be so
Preoccupied with that new watch you just copped
You won't even see that ride pulling up alongside you
You'll be shot 'fore you even realize you were spied on for three blocks
D-Block the place where O.G.'s get knocked, locked up
Get out come home for a week and get re-knocked
You won't even see cops, hip-hop police don't even stop
On D-Block, where everybody wants to be 'Pac
And you can get popped over the new G-Unit Reeboks

How its gon' look when I come through your block?
Sheek, Funk Doc, Meth on top
Porsche, 300 horse fly by
Back open pumpin ""How High?"" (How High)
Yeah, can y'all see that (See that)
Bitch you can call me what you want, 'cuz ""I'll Be Dat"" (Be dat)
Get off my dick, I don't care about no jewels
Long as the condo's paid and the truck I choose
I'm tellin y'all niggas, if its not double R
I'mma spell my name out on the side of your car

Come and Ruff Ryde with us
If you wanna get high with us
If you wanna get down with us
Come on now
Come and Ruff Ryde with us
If you wanna get high with us
If you wanna get down with us
Come on now

I got a twin cam exhaust connected to the jaw
A five speed clutch on my paw when I write
I glow like the pegs in Lite-Brite
3000 volts of lightning when you fly the right kite
Me and Meth be Hennessy, two ice cubes
We can draw (choose your weapons) or do I choose?
When I choose the grip, one shot lose your hip
I hope your shoes fit for this move and pick
I avalanche your camp with, ten feet of snow
I'm cold blooded, my fam half-eskimo
My flows move like indo
Turn ten nickels to ten loads, outta ten sto's
Ride the crash course, do the math on it
Swizz Beats you can ride Amtrak on it
But I'm on it, grillin with George Foreman
Ya peeps is at the Grammy Awards cornin
The ice, the fat wallet son, I want it
And the helicopter warmin before mornin
Def Jam nigga, Redman nigga
Got - ""fuck ya momma"" on my sweat band nigga
You tough guys'll get smacked in the club
Come with the gun I bought from Mack in the club
Its P-P-P from Bricks to Brook-nam (C'mon)
(C'mon) Bring me some more ass to whoop on

Come and Ruff Ryde with us
If you wanna get high with us
If you wanna get down with us
Come on now
Come and Ruff Ryde with us
If you wanna get high with us
If you wanna get down with us
Come on now

Look what the cat dragged in
Underground dweller from the cellar bring terror
Scoop a high yellow Cinderella, Meth forever
Never rush a rhyme, hope to never bust my nine
But if I have to, I have to, it's all in the mind
I stay ahead of time while y'all fallin behind
Tryin to relight ya lime
It's a crime when I drop bomb lines designed
To tick, tick, boom blow your mind
Yeah me, M-E-T, H, the O, the D
Can't be done, like tryin to find a penny in the sea
Nigga run for cover son go and get them guns
Y'all ain't from here, don't try to come around here gettin' ones
Swizz Beat the track in the head, but I instead
Pull my dart gun and bust sixteen until it's dead
I'm the game, all of my dogs be off the chain
Yellin Wu Tang, Wu-Tang

Come and Ruff Ryde with us
If you wanna get high with us
If you wanna get down with us
Come on now
Come and Ruff Ryde with us
If you wanna get high with us
If you wanna get down with us
Come on now

Come and Ruff Ryde with us
If you wanna get high with us
If you wanna get down with us
Come on now
Come and Ruff Ryde with us
If you wanna get high with us
If you wanna get down with us
Come on now

Come and Ruff Ryde with us
If you wanna get high with us
If you wanna get down with us
Come on now",2 Tears in a Bucket,2000

Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Fuck why y'all niggas talking 'bout huh? (it's time I see you)
Get it right, you fagot niggas heard Suge Knight
Double are's the only niggas he respect and, why y'all niggas shook right?
Why y'all get on Hot 97 and, talk wit a baritone
Wit two niggas downstairs with licensed guns to take why y'all home
Scared ass niggas, you think they going take a life so they can get life [nope]
Ask Puff they ain't trying to hear that nigga
For no cake, and why y'all can get at us on Labor Day
We make stones that say ? your moms labor day
I'm in the hood so we can link up, any place you think of
Hand held don't hold prints plus I burnt the tip of my fingers
I'm a Bronx gangsta nigga, double are's hoodrat
The nigga they come get quick bitch, on this hood shit

[Cross]
Why y'all bitches think the riders a joke, well I don't play (let's go)
I blow you whole fucking shit up like Tim McVeigh
Gimme the needle, not tomorrow, but today
Cross coming why y'all better get the fuck out the way
I ain't the shit that you see that's on the top of your church
I put a bomb in your baby carriage, brick through your hearse

[Infa-Red]
Tell your CEO, don't call my CEO apologizing (sorry)
I'm at your wake in the choir standing harmonizing
It's Infa-Red the shit that be on top of the heater
The best thing in New York since Steinbrenner signed Jeter
Hold Camby sister the hostage, then send 'em a reef
So stop fronting vegetarian just scared of beef

[Eve]
Yo, hey suck my dick bitch, the way this chick spit ridiculous
Here we go again, only we on Kiss shit
We coming and you keep running
You keep claiming you the best that done it
Pussy let me see something
Fake niggas screaming ""Ryde or Die""
Same niggas we run up on and make 'em cry
Outta all the camps in this game, nigga
We the champs in this game
Who kick the real shit before the fame
Fuck you fat ass, fake bad ass niggas
Still play the hood while you ride past niggas
Coward trust me, we keep it gutter
Hope you stay mad a hater 'cause you can't touch us, huh

""It's time I see you""

[Styles]
Hey yo, I ain't got a care in the world
Kidnapping your kid, maiming your mom, and airing your girl
And like, you ain't got a care in the world
I'm hopeless and numb, I can't see but I can focus my gun
And I'm down for smoking blunts to the head
My nerves is shot, my paces is short, I dump in your head
I'm the hardest nigga out you outta know it by now
I'm the nigga that they talk about going to Chao
And my name ring bells, my blade stay bloody
If you heard about me beefing dog I leave the most shells
The nigga to salute, the quickest to shoot
Holiday Styles, motherfucker, giving you pound

[Sheek]
What? Like I won't run up and break your jaw
Like they make a vest for your head to stop the 4
I'm tired of rapping, let's get the mack and send niggas on vacation
Right in front of the radio station
Motherfuckers ain't quiet til the tech go off
Arteries hitted, hawkin, they neck is shit
I'm the motherfucking hardest
I smack the shit out of any one of your artists
Whatever the label
Why y'all niggas don't want beef, why y'all want meat at the table
And I don't give a fuck, Sheek'll do life in the box
Before any of why y'all bitch niggas front on the LOX
What? Motherfuckers, see man

[Jadakiss]
Yo, If I miss your head and your neck, I'll hurt your chest
If you from the streets betrayal is worse than death
And I'm known for getting money, not known for wildin
But I'm real I could rock both phones in the island
This is how we even the bets
I kill everything you love dog, right now, even the pets
Everything got dubs on it, even the vets
50 close, then 50 wide, even the sets
Cause the bullets is like calisthenics when I'm squirting
When they start hurting, that means they working
Only way we coming is hard
Industry is like jail nigga, double are's running the yard, uh",It's Time I See You,2001
Sheek Louch,"[Styles]
It's sorta like the Holy Trinity
I'ma say
I say it's like three different guns you fucking fagots
Get shot three different ways
Matter fact, make that six different ways
Gun in each hand bitch
None of y'all better
""Ain't none of y'all better""
If it is name it
We'll squash you, ASAP, feel it

All I know, niggas give me all my dough
Like Boston George coming through with all my blow
Right now I'm trying to charter a jet
Fuck this hit the Panama Canal and get a harder connect
Step on your toes, mess with your hoes, shoot up your mans
Come through the block trying to screw up your plans
Cause I still rob niggas for coke
Understand I'm the first one they call when they gettin the dope
I'm the one who prick your finger when they give you the oath
I'm the one who made the hit when they bring you the toast
Like Pacino and DeNiro 'cept they call me Paniro
Sad Styles still spin that arrow, fuck it
Like the boss of New York, you know how I feel
Kill a motherfucker cause a corpse don't talk (no doubt)
Sixteen in the joint wit one in the head
If the bullets had legs have them run in your head, bitch

[Chorus]
Int none of y'all better
What y'all know about
Put in my work
On the block
Aint none if y'all better
But you know it's all real
Is it real? Yeah son!
Aint none of y'all better
What y'all know about
Put in my work
On the block
Aint none of y'all better
""bet you know it's all real
Is it real? Yeah son!
Ain't none of y'all better

[Sheek]
Let's get it popping my nigga
Load the tech up and go shopping my nigga
And I don't mean the mall or no Gucci store
You know what the fuck I want, bricks of raw
And I'm too old to make less than a hundred a year
If it means waving the hammer and leaving you there
If it means grabbing your kids out daycare
Somebody losing a seed, pay or bleed
It's Sheek Louch, I ain't got no heart
I shoot broad daylight right in front of the mark
I put 28 holes through the icy car
Fuck around, like the God won't squeeze
If I don't see the badge I'm clapping the D's
LOX motherfucker, the OX motherfucker
The reason why you shouldn't cop drops motherfucker
Like it's something for me to shoot your pops motherfucker, what

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
Ayo the dopes and the rice, the cokes and the Pyrex
Over the stove and I'm bout to hit it with the ice
Runners love to pump the bomb
They know no fair ones, now niggas'll jump they moms
You god, minus the 12 disciples
I pop up, all you see is shells and rifles
If I don't like you, I'ma kill you not fight you
I bite a little piece of your ear off like Mike do
And everybody gon' follow me now
Down eighth and an Uzi mahogany brown
Fagots want you to kill 'em in a hurry
It fucks me up, like they aint got no money to get buried
You could flip, I'll survive m'kay, motherfucker
In my block still doing twenty-five a day
Know you work out, chest and your back all nice
But the twelve gauge'll have your six pack on ice, what?

[Chorus]",None of Y'all Betta,2001
Sheek Louch,"Turn it up (turn it up)
Swizz Beats the monster
(Fix ya face, Ruff Ryders)
Let's do it
(D-Block) E-V-E, Styles P. and Sheek
(Whats up, whats up)
Let's do it

Walk wit ya nigga, hawk wit ya nigga
I came to shut it down
Ski mask and four pound
Baby grenades, we deep like baby parades
D-Block I'm goin' sharpen ya blades
Let's get it on
Videos with bullets flying through Korn
Blow! Footage turn ya camcords on
It's the underground nigga with bricks, nigga with dough
A nigga fucking all y'all chicks, you know
I'm a gangster and a gentleman too, P
I'll lay a nigga down and send his moms a bouquet for free
I could start a pet store with these birds 
I'm the rap Donald Goines with words
Still rob y'all herbs (And I came to)
Hit the club on my dick, light up a blunt
Thug a bitch out, I got the mud in the front
I got the flight jacket, came with wings
When I chase you to the roof 
Clappin' at ya ass with one of them things

[Chorus]
I gots to live by my pride
'Cause I came to Ruff Ryde or die
And I gots to shut down ya name
'Cause I came to shut down the game
And I gots to hold down this heat
'Cause I came to hold down ya streets
And I gots to make sure I drop yo ass
'Cause I came to D-Block all ya cash

Yo, I was determined to sell
And not because I'm just a bunny with a fluffy tail
Had to prove that I could live hard and spit hard
Just a bonus that I'm cute and get ya dick hard
See, I ain't never lettin' mine go
I'ma be here forever with my dogs as the time go
And I know we makin' niggas sick
We in they face everyday every way and they can't handle it
Streets choosin' Double are realest niggas out no confusion
Cats don't want it over here--have you heard
S.P. ain't for games little boy lesson learned
I suggest you stay far from my nigga's face
Hop back go hard all day in a nigga's face
You see, you cowards ain't a threat to us really
Just figured that we let you know that testin' us is silly
Good luck, y'all, naw forreal, fuck why'all

[Chorus]

I live by my pride, I could never be broke
I'ma Ruff Ryde or die catch me bein' with dope
Smokin' weed in the hoopty with the three in the coat
'Cause my ace boon-koon got a connect
Told me send a hundred bundles to the day room soon
If the shit go right, he know that it will
We'll be cash, he'll be movin' straight weight through June
But back to this rap shit who thug it the most
It'll take the whole coast just to fuck with the ghost
He done shut down the game, shit on ya name
If you ain't hold down the street or bust off ya heat
Then me and you is different, we ain't get it the same
And I represent niggas who live it, keep askin' for it
And I represent niggas who give it
This a D-Block Ruff Ryder, Holiday Styles
Cock sucker and I don't give a fuck about you

[Chorus]",And I Came To...,2002
