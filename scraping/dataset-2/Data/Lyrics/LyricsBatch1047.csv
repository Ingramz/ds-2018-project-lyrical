Steve Conway,"I'm so unhappy
What'll I do?
I long for somebody who
Will sympathize with me
I'm growing so tired of living alone
I lie awake all night and cry
Nobody loves me
That's why

All by myself in the morning
All by myself in the night

I sit alone with a table and a chair
So unhappy there
Playing solitaire

All by myself I get lonely
Watching the clock on the shelf

I'd love to rest my weary head on somebody's shoulder
I hate to grow older
All by myself
",All by Myself,2001
Steve Conway,"Though you've decided that our love is wrong
And think that we should part
It seems as though I have loved you so long
You'll always be in my heart

Is it a sin
Is it a crime
Loving you dear like I do
If it's a crime then I'm guilty
Guilty of loving you

Maybe I'm wrong dreaming of you
Dreaming the lonely night through
If it's a crime then I'm guilty
Guilty of dreaming of you

What can I do
What can I say
After I've taken the blame?
You say we're through
You'll go your way
But I'll always feel just the same

Maybe I'm right
Maybe I'm wrong
Loving you dear like I do
If it's a crime then I'm guilty
Guilty of loving you",Guilty,2001
Steve Conway,"Maybe it happens this way
Maybe we really belong together
But after all, how little we know

Maybe it's just for a day
Love is as changeable as the weather
And after all, how little we know

Who knows why an April breeze never remains
Why stars in the trees hide when it rains
Love comes along, casting a spell            
Will it sing you a song  
Will it say a farewell
Who can tell

Maybe you're meant to be mine
Maybe I'm only supposed to stay in your arms a while
As others have done
 
Is this what I've waited for, am I the one
Oh, I hope in my heart that it's so
In spite of how little we know

Is this what I've waited for, am I the one
Oh, I hope in my heart that it's so
In spite of how little we know",How Little We Know,2001
Steve Conway,"I can't begin to tell you
How much you mean to me.
My world would end
If ever we were through.

I can't begin to tell you
How happy I would be
If I could speak my mind
Like others do.

I make such pretty speeches
Whenever we're apart.
But when you're near
The words I choose
Refuse to leave my heart.

So take the sweetest phrases
The world has ever known
And make believe
I've said them all to you.

But when you're near

Refuse to leave my heart.

So take the sweetest phrases
The world has ever known.
And make believe
I've said them all to you.",I Can't Begin to Tell You,2001
Steve Conway,"I poured my heart into a song,
And I'm afraid the words I chose are not so smart;
I couldn't think of clever things to say in my song,
I had to say it with my heart.

If it's never played
On the hit parade,
It will still contain a heart that is beating true.
If it's not a hit
I won't mind a bit,
Long as it conveys a love that I bear for you.

Oh, here is my heart wrapped in a song,
And if you take it please don't tear my song apart,
For if you do you won't be just destroying a song,
You will be tearing up my heart.",I Poured My Heart into a Song,2001
Steve Conway,"I wish I didn't love you so
My love for you should have faded long ago.
I wish I didn't need your kiss
Why must your kiss torture me as long as this.

I might be smilin' by now 
With some new tender friend.
Smilin' by now
With my heart on the mend.

But when I try
Something in that heart says ""No"".
You're still there
I wish I didn't love you so.",I Wish I Didn't Love You So,2001
Steve Conway,"Each time I see a crowd of people
Just like a fool I stop and stare
It's really not the proper thing to do
But maybe you'll be there

I go out walking after midnight
Along the lonely thoroughfare
It's not the time or place to look for you
But maybe you'll be there

You said your arms would always hold me
You said your lips were mine alone to kiss
Now after all those things you told me
How can it end like this?

Some day if all my prayers are answered
I'll hear a footstep on the stair
With anxious heart I'll hurry to the door
And maybe you'll be there

You said your arms would always hold me
You said your lips were mine alone to kiss
Now after all those things you told me
How can it end like this?

Some day if all my prayers are answered
I'll hear a footstep on the stair
With anxious heart I'll hurry to the door
And maybe you'll be there
And maybe you'll be there

",Maybe You'll Be There,2001
Steve Conway,"Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa men have named you
You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only cause you're lonely they have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile
Do you smile to tempt a lover Mona Lisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art.

Steve Conway,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,2001
Steve Conway,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble
Toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
Mais la vie separe ceux qui s'aiment
Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis",Autumn Leaves,2004

Steve Cradock,"If you gave me a fresh carnation
I would only crush its tender petals
With me you'll have no escape
And at the same time there'll be nowhere to settle -
I trample down all life in my wake
I eat it up and take the cake
I just avert my eyes to the pain
Of someone's loss helping my gain
If you gave me a dream for my pocket
You'd be plugging in the wrong socket
With me there's no room for the future
With me there's no room with a view at all -
I am out of season all year 'round
Hear machinery roar to my empty sound
Touch my heart and feel winter
Hold my hand and be doomed forever -
 
 If you gave me a fresh carnation
I would only crush its tender petals
With me you'll have no escape
And at the same time there'll be nowhere to settle.
And if you're wondering by now who I am
Look no further than the mirror -
Because I am the Greed and Fear
And every ounce of Hate in you.",Carnation,2000
Steve Cradock,"All that I want is for the apple
Not to fall far from the tree
Sunny and Cass, you float like butterflies
The magic of our saucepan lids

I'll tell you everything that I know
But the child's father to the man
So start to begin free like the wind
Begin my kin start to begin
The apple don't fall far from the tree

Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love

I'll tell you everything that I know
But the child's father to the man
So start to begin free like the wind
Begin my kin start to begin
The apple don't fall far from the tree

We're melodies, we're speaking tongues
We're sea shanties on the school run, we're fabled law
It's easy come and easy go not yet that old
You know what's right before you're told
Reveal yourself and avoid the cost

I'll tell you everything that I know
But the child's father to the man
So start to begin free like the wind
Begin my kin start to begin
The apple don't fall far from the tree

",The Apple,2009
Steve Cradock,"I got an inkling a feeling you won't
You think I'm half a man and half a goat
Excuse me can't you see

I sprung the spring for you
I can't let go
It's not that simple vows are not unknown
But I know or will be shown

To assume the weight of mythology
The story's a song when it's written so beautifully

It takes my hand as it comes
And explores the new state of the world
While the real world falls
Out of the arms who should hold
So beware of falling rocks

As in view from Richmond Hill we know
Thro' Turner's eyes it's kinda set in stone
The beauty just unfolds
The spring I sprung for you it can't let go
I got an inkling a feeling you know
Come to me it's all free

To assume the weight of mythology
The story's a song when it's written so beautifully

It takes my hand as it comes
And explores the new state of the world 
While the real world falls 
Out of the arms
Who should hold
So beware of falling rocks",Beware of Falling Rocks,2009
Steve Cradock,"Even while I've got my word it goes on and on
On and on, it goes on and on
Seen my fortune and I lift my words and they are everything
Oh oh, they are everything

Sailing boats and open roads can seem to pass you by
But sailing boats and open roads can pass you in disguise

Seen my days and oh I swear they go on and on
Oh oh, they go on and on
Have ? and it seems to work and it says everything
Oh oh, it goes on and on

Steve Crawford,"You'll never find her story in a fairy tale
Cause she wasn't like, the other women at the well
Her life was full of pain, hurt, rejection
And loneliness she didn't want to show
But Jesus saw the desert in her soul

Drink from this water
Drink from this water 
And you will never, you'll never thirst again
Drink from this water
Drink from this water
You will never, you'll never thirst again

Oh
We all search for something
To fill us up inside
But it's only an illusion
You know a True Love's hard to find
But I'm here to tell you there's one place
Your thirst is quenched for ever more
You will never leave empty disappointed
You will find what you are looking for

[Chorus]

And oh Jesus will meet you
At the place of every need
And only He can make the wounded whole
And make the blind man see

Steve Crawford,"Yeah

I was working part time in a five-and-dime
My boss was Mr. McGee
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind
'Cause I was a bit too leisurely

Seems that I was busy doing something close to nothing
But different than the day before
That's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her
She walked in through the out door, out door

She wore a
Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

Built like she was
She had the nerve to ask me
If I planned to do her any harm
So, look here
I put her on the back of my bike
And we went riding
Down by old man Johnson's farm

I said now, overcast days never turned me on
But something about the clouds and her mixed
She wasn't to bright
But I could tell when she kissed me
She knew how to get her kicks

She wore a
Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof
And the horses wonder who you are
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
You feel like a movie star

Listen
They say the first time ain't the greatest
But I tell ya
If I had the chance to do it all again
I wouldn't change a stroke
'Cause baby I'm the most
With a girl as fine as she was then

Steve Croes,"Won't you play some simple melody
Like my mother sang to me
One with a good old-fashioned harmony
Play some simple melody

Musical demon, set your honey a-dreamin',
Won't you play me some rag
Just change that classical nag to some sweet beautiful drag
If you will play from a copy of a tune 
That is choppy you'll get all my applause
And that is simply because I wanna listen to rag

Play for me

Born under a bad sign.

Steve Davis,"I am not such a clever one
About the latest fads

I love the moonlight
I love the old fashioned things
The sound of rain
Upon a window pane
The starry song that April sings
This year's fancies
Are passing fancies
But sighing sighs holding hands
These my heart understands

To stay old fashioned with me

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon

That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

It loads a might slow, and soon I found out 
It'll get you into trouble but it can't get you out 

So then I went and bought myself a Colt 45 
Called a peacemaker but I never knew why 
I never knew why, I didn't understand 
Mama says the pistol is the devil's right hand 

The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand 
Mama says the pistol is the devil's right hand 

Got into a card game in a company town 
I caught a miner cheating, I shot the dog down 
I shot the dog down, I watched the man fall 
He never touched his holster, never had a chance to draw 

The trial was in the morning and they drug me out of bed 
Asked me how I pleaded, not guilty I said 
Not guilty I said, you've got the wrong man 
Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand 

The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand 
Mama says the pistol is the devil's right hand 

The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand 
Mama says the pistol is the devil's right hand",The Devil's Right Hand [Live],1986

Strong enough to get you through the scary part
It's been broken many times before

Everybody knows my name 
But ever since the glass plant closed down 
Things round here ain't never been the same 
I got me a good job alright but some nights 
Take me to another time 
Back when I was No. 29 

I was pretty good then don't you know watch him go 
Buddy I could really fly 
Everyone in town came, hip flasks, horn blasts 
Any autumn Friday night 
Sally yelled her heart out push em back, way back 
I was hers and she was mine 
Back when I was No. 29 

We were playin' Smithville big boys, farm boys 
Second down and four to go 
Bubba brought the play in good call my ball 
Now they're gonna see a show 
But Bubba let his man go I cut back, heard it crack 
It still hurts me but I don't mind 
Reminds me I was No. 29 
 
 Now I go to the ballgames cold nights, half pints 
Friday nights I'm always here 
We got a pretty good team, good boys, strong boys 
District champs the last three years 
Got a little tailback pretty slick, real quick 
I take him for a steak sometimes 
Nowadays he's No. 29 

I don't follow rainbows, big dreams, brass rings 
I've already captured mine

I'll push as long as I'm alive, but I don't know how long I'll last

I'm blowin' by the double five
I know I'm going way too fast

I been down this road just searching' for the end
It don't go nowhere, it just brings you back again
Leaves you lonely and cold, standin' on the shoulder
But you've come too far to go back home
So you're walkin' on a nowhere road

Some folks say, if you keep rollin'
And keep it on the yellow line

I'm gonna leave you alone in your own little world 
But won't you be my San Antonio girl 
Be my San Antonio girl 
Be my, be my, be my, San Antonio girl 

Now I know you've heard the stories bout life in the fast lane

Pumpin' gasoline and countin' out of state plates 
They ask me how far into Memphis son, and where's the nearest beer 
And they don't even know that there's a town around here 

Someday I'm finally gonna let go 
'Cause I know there's a better way 
And I want to know what's over that rainbow 
I'm gonna get out of here someday 

Now my brother went to college cause he played football 
I'm still hangin' round cause I'm a little bit small

I sat around and had a beer with the boys like I always do 
Well I didn't have nothin' to say anyway there ain't no point 
There's just something 'bout a Monday that always makes me blue 

Well it was well after dark so I knew my wife and kids were waitin' 
And I guess I took a left where I generally take a right 
Well I filled her up with gas, checked the oil at the Texaco station 
I threw the car seat in the dumpster and headed off into the night

I hadn't never had her up past 55 before 

Well somethin' 'bout that little red line always looked so final 
Buddy you'd be surprised how fast a Chevrolet truck can go 

Now, down in Mexico they've got a little place called Boystown 
Where a man's still a man if you know what I'm talkin' about 
Well, I walked into the Cadillac bar and I laid my cash down 
I said ""there's plenty more where that came from"" and the lights went out 
 
Well I woke up in a county jail 'cross the line in Laredo 
With a headache and a deputy staring at me through the door 
Well he said ""Now how you got across that river alive, I don't know 
But your wife just made your bail so now you're really dead for sure"" 

Now my wife, she called my boss and cried so I got my job back 
And the boys down at the plant, they whisper and stare at me

He had the world in the palm of his hand
Sultans and kings beat a path to his door,
Had everything but he still wanted more

One day in spring came a lady so fair,
And he'd never looked on a beauty so rare
But he didn't trust her,
So he locked her away,
The gold lost its lustre when the love died that day

Once you love, once you trust it,
Once you give, your soul is bare
One false move and you know you're busted,
Once you love, you care

I knew an old man who lived all alone
A sad little house at the end of the road
Sat on his front porch, in an old rocking chair,
Everyone swore he'd gone crazy down there

But no-one comes near, so how could they know,
He lost someone dear to him once long ago
He remembers the laughter, still tastes the tears,
Still calls her name out after all of these years

Once you love, once you trust it,
Once you give, your soul is bare
One false move and you know you're busted,
Once you love, you care

You can keep it all inside,
You can run but you can't hide
When you think it's safe outside,
Look behind you love will find you

Well it was well after dark so I knew my wife and kids were waitin'

I saw my first pistol in the general store 
In the general store, when I was thirteen 
Thought it was the finest thing I ever had seen 

So l asked if I could have one someday when I grew up 
Mama dropped a dozen eggs, she really blew up 
She really blew up, I didn't understand 
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand

My very first pistol was a cap and ball Colt 
Shoot as fast as lightnin' but she loads a might slow 
Loads a might slow, soon found out 
It can get you into trouble but it can't get you out 

So then I went and bought myself a Colt 45 
Called a peacemaker but I never knew why 
Never knew why, I didn't understand

Well I get into a card game in a company town 
Caught a miner cheating, I shot the dog down 
Shot the dog down, watched the man fall 
Never touched his holster, never had a chance to draw 

The trial was in the morning and they drug me out of bed 
Asked me how I pleaded, not guilty I said 
Not guilty I said, you've got the wrong man 
Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand

Yeah it's your good rockin' daddy down from Tennessee
I'm just out of Austin bound for San Antone
With the radio blastin' and the bird dog on

There's a speed trap up ahead in Selma Town
But no local yokel gonna shut me down
'Cause me and my boys got this rig unwound
And we've come a thousand miles from a Guitar Town

Nothin' ever happened 'round my hometown
And I ain't the kind to just hang around
But I heard someone callin' my name one day
And I followed that voice down the lost highway

Everybody told me you can't get far
On thirty-seven dollars and a Jap guitar
Now I'm smokin' into Texas with the hammer down
And a rockin' little combo from the Guitar Town

Hey pretty baby don't you know it ain't my fault
I love to hear the steel belts hummin' on the asphalt
Wake up in the middle of the night in a truck stop
Stumble in the restaurant wonderin' why I don't stop

Well I gotta keep rockin' while I still can
I gotta two pack habit and a motel tan
When my boots hit the boards I'm a brand new man
With my back to the riser I make my stand

And hey pretty baby won't you hold me tight

Now the revenue man wanted Grandaddy bad
He headed up the holler with everything he had
'Fore my time but I've been told
He never come back from Copperhead Road

Now Daddy ran whiskey in a big block Dodge
Bought it at an auction at the Mason's Lodge
Johnson County Sheriff painted on the side
Just shot a coat of primer then he looked inside

Well him and my uncle tore that engine down
I still remember that rumblin' sound
When the Sheriff came around in the middle of the night

And the rain came down 
Like an angel come down from above 
And the rain came down

They scarce believed their eyes, they'd come so many miles
And this miracle they prized was nothing but a child

Nothing but a child could wash those tears away
Or guide a weary world into the light of day
And nothing but a child could help erase those miles
So once again we all can be children for awhile

Now all around the world, in every little town
Everyday is heard a precious little sound
And every mother kind and every father proud
Looks down in awe to find another chance allowed

Nothing but a child could wash those tears away
Or guide a weary world into the light of day
And nothing but a child could help erase those miles
So once again we all can be children for awhile

Steve Earle,"I woke up this morning and I took a look around at all that I got 
These days I've been lookin' in the mirror and wondering if that's me lookin' back or not 
I'm still the apple of my mama's eye 
I'm my daddy's worst fears realized 
Here of late all this real estate don't seem all that real to me sometimes 

I'm back out on that road again 
Turn this beast into the wind 
There are those that break and bend 
I'm the other kind, I'm the other kind 

Now my old buddy, what's his name, says, ""Man what the hell are you thinkin' 'bout 
Fool, you got two of everything, but you hang your head just like you was down and out""; 
And I'm damn sure not suffering from a lack of love 
There's plenty more where that came from 
Ah - but leave it up to me to say something wrong and hurt someone before I'm done 

You see it used to be I was really free 
I didn't need no gasoline to run 
Before you could say Jack Kerouac you'd turn your back and I'd be gone 
Yeah nowadays I got me two good wheels and I seek refuge in aluminum and steel 
Aw, it takes me out there for just a little while

I raised some Cain when I come back to town
I left to be all I could be

Now, I married Dawn and had to settle down

So I hired on at the prison
Guess I always knew I would
Just like my dad and both my uncles done
And I worked on every cell block
Now, things're goin' good
But then they transferred me to Ellis Unit One

And how they used to strap em in the chair
The kids down from the college and they'd bring their beer n all
N when the lights went out, a cheer rose in the air

Well, folks just got too civilized
Sparky's gatherin' dust
Cause no one wants to touch a smokin' gun
And since they got the injection
They don't mind as much, I guess
They just put em down at Ellis Unit One

Well, I've seen em fight like lions, boys
I've seen 'em go like lambs

And I've seen the victim's family holdin' hands

Steve Earle,"Billy was seventeen and mean as hell
Bonnie said she was thirty, it was hard to tell
Now Billy met Bonnie on a Saturday night
At the dirt track races, it was love at first sight

Now Bonnie was wilder than the west wind blows
Taught Billy every single thing he knows
But she never told Billy what she left out
The part about the trouble when your times runs out

When the thrill is gone, when your deal goes south
It's all over when your time runs out

Well Bonnie said, ""Billy, don't you think it's time
We moved on a little further down the line""
So they knocked off a Texaco south of town
Blew down the highway with the ragtop down

Now Billy woke Bonnie up about daylight
Said, ""You drive honey, I've been up all night""
Now Billy wasn't sweatin' no APB
'Cause he didn't leave a single soul alive to see

He was just sixteen, made his mama proud
That don't mean nothin' when your time runs out

Now Bonnie kept pushin' that Cadillac
Billy passed out with the seat reared back
Slept through Louisiana, then just past dark
Bonnie pulled over in a roadside park

Left Billy sleeping and she called the cops
He never knew nothin' when the dime was dropped
Now Bonnie knew what she had to do
She called the sheriff and she cried on cue

And the state police rousted Billy out
He was dreaming about Bonnie when his time run out

Well the sheriff told Billy, ""Boy, you're bound to die
'Cause this young lady's gonna testify
That you done took her off against her will
And she told us about the robbery and the boy you killed""
Now the judge said, ""Billy, what you got to say
Before I have the sheriff carry you away""
Now Billy looked Bonnie right in the eye
But he didn't even have to ask her why
But he turned around when they led him out
He said I'll see you down in hell when your time runs out",Billy and Bonnie,1996

Just staring at the screen
With an uneasy feeling in my chest
I'm wonderin' what it means

Tear your eyes from paradise
And rise again somehow
If you run into Jesus
Maybe he can help you out

Somewhere I failed to find your trail

But there's killers on the highway now

So I sold my soul for wheels that roll
Now I'm stuck here in this town

Come back to us now
Tear your eyes from paradise
And rise again somehow
If you run into Jesus
Maybe he can help us out
Come back Woody Guthrie to us now

Cows out in the corn
The unions have been busted
Their proud red banners torn
To listen to the radio

But you and me and Cisco know
It's going straight to hell

So come back, Emma Goldman
Rise up, old Joe Hill
The barracades are goin' up
They cannot break our will

But Colorado's always clean and healin'
And Tennessee in spring is green and cool

Where the sky is wide and the clouds are few
A man can see his way clear to the light
Just hold on tight

And one thing change'll bring is somethin' new
And Houston really ain't that bad a town

Steve Earle,"I saw you lookin' at that girl like that
Yeah I saw her too boy I know right where you're at
But you better be careful
'Cause she ain't the kind you're gonna forget
How much you want to bet

If you fall in love
Nothin' gonna be the same
You walk around callin' out her name
You throw your heart down like a glove
Push come to shove
You only end up lonely and blue
Whenever she's away from you
If you fall in love

You gotta hear me talkin' to ya
'Cause I'm your best friend
And I'd hate to see you goin'
Where I've already been
'Cause I've been in love before
And I won't ever be the same again
You better listen to me, Jim

If you fall in love
Nothin' gonna be the same
You walk around callin' out her name
You throw your heart down like a glove
Push come to shove
You only end up lonely and blue
Whenever she's away from you
If you fall in love

There she is again
She sure looks fine
Boy, I know you're walkin'
On a very thin line
So I guess it's up to me
'Cause your heart's not as strong as mine
Well just this one time

If you fall in love
Nothin' gonna be the same
You walk around callin' out her name
Throw your heart down like a glove
Push come to shove
You only end up lonely and blue
Whenever she's away from you
If you fall in love
If you fall in love
If you fall in love",If You Fall,1997
Steve Earle,"He was standing on the highway
Somewhere way out in the sticks
Guitar across his shoulder
Like a 30 ought six
He was staring in my headlights
When I come around the bend
Climbed up on my shotgun side
And told me with a grin

I'm going to New York City
I never really been there
Just like the way it sounds
I heard the girls are pretty
There must be something happening there
It's just too big a town

He was cold and wet and hungry
Never did complain
Said he'd come a thousand miles
Through sleet and snow and rain
He had a hundred stories
About the places that he'd been
He'd hang around a little while
And hit the road again

He's going to New York City
I never really been there
Just like the way it sounds
He heard the girls are pretty
There must be something happening there
It's just too big a town

See I've been to New York City
Seems like it was yesterday
I was standing like a pilgrim
On the Great White Way
The girls were really pretty
But they wouldn't talk to me
I held out about a week
Went back to Tennessee

So, I thought I'd better warn him
When he climbed out of my car
Grabbed his battered suitcase
Shouldered his guitar
I knew I was just jealous
If I didn't wish him well
I slipped the kid a twenty
Said 'Billy give 'em hell'

He's going to New York City
I never really been there
Just like the way it sounds
He heard the girls are pretty
There must be something happening there
It's just too big a town

He's going to New York City
I never really been there
Just like the way it sounds
He heard the girls are pretty
There must be something happening there

And I'm feeling all alone
There's a place that I go to
That no one knows

Where no matter what I do
Won't nobody put me down
That's why I'm going to
The other side of town

On the other side of town
Where the sun don't ever shine
Everybody walks around
With a shadow cross their minds

When that midnight train rolls by
And they hear that lonesome sound
They just hang their heads and cry
On the other side of town

Well it isn't very far
And it's not that hard to find
You just follow all the other lonely souls
Take a walk down lonesome lane
'Til you see the dead end sign
And your broken heart will tell you where to go

To the other side of town
Where the sun don't ever shine
Everybody walks around
With a shadow cross their minds

When that midnight train rolls by
And they hear that lonesome sound
They just hang their heads and cry
On the other side of town

So if you've find someone
Who won't ever let you down
Hurry home before the sun goes down
No matter what you do
Don't let night fall like a shroud
And catch you on the other side of town

Steve Earle,"I was almost outta here
I nearly left this time
I saw you in my rear  view mirror
And I pulled up on a dime

But nothin' ventured, nothin' lost
You can't say we didn't try
That is unless you weigh the cost
Of every tear we cried

Why do we do this to each other
I guess we were always poison lovers

If you could look me in the eye
And tell me what you see
Maybe you can tell me why
I let you torture me

I know that your lips are soft
And they sing the sweetest songs
But I've been listenin' long enough
My heart has turned to stone

Why do we do this to each other
Guess we were always poison lovers

Another time, another place
Another wind to blame
Cover every track and trace
I'll find you just the same

And even if we made our peace
And went our separate ways
You'd go west and I'd go east
And we'd meet here in this place

Why do we do this to each other
I guess we were always poison lovers
Why do we do this to each other
Guess we were always poison lovers",Poison Lovers,1997
Steve Earle,"Somewhere out there in the world tonight
Just out of my reach
I hear your heart beat
It's comin' in loud and clear tonight
Poundin' in my brain
It's callin' out your name

In the darkness something binds you to me
So that I can find you
When you want me
I will be there
Waiting on you
Somewhere out there

Somewhere in there, in your heart tonight
Where I have never gone
You are not alone
And it's tearing me all apart alright
But girl what can I do
When I'm so far from you

And when I lay me down to sleep
My one and only prayer is you'll keep
Safe from harm until I get
Wherever you are
Somewhere out there

If you're sad, if you're lonely
If you're scared, if you're only
Tired of fightin'
Seekin' shelter
Just hold on I'm
Somewhere out there

Somewhere out there in the world tonight
Just out of your reach
You'll hear my heart beat",Somewhere out There,1997
Steve Earle,"I went down to Taneytown
I went down to Taneytown
To see what I could see

My mama told me never go
I'm damn near twenty two years old
Sometimes I fear this holler swallow me

She ran off to Gettysburg
Went off with that new beau of hers
I snuck off after dark

It's a long way down the county road
The stars were bright and the moon was low
Down to where the black top highway starts

I went down to Taneytown
I went down to Taneytown
I went down to see what I could see

Now everybody stared at me
You'd think that they ain't never seen
A colored boy before

Well they chunked at me and called me names
They'd have whopped me sure but the sheriff came
I slipped off ran through the dry goods store

I ran down Division Street
Some of them boys followed me
Down to the railroad track

There's four of them and I can't fight
But I had my old Randall knife
I cut that boy and I never did look back

I went down to Taneytown
I went down to Taneytown
I went down to see what I could see

Cross the fields and woods I run
Like a bullet from a rabbit gun
Back home to my bed

Now Ma came in from Gettysburg
Her and that new beau of hers
""Boy you look like hell""; alls she said

A month went by without a word
Somebody down the holler heard
About that boy they hung

He begged those men to spare his life
But I dropped my bloody Randall knife
He picked it up so they thought he was the one, yeah

So convincingly real
Things can seem so amazing
'Til you get up close
And see they're no big deal

Or the one on the stage
Just a big ball of gas
And a regular guy
Fresh out of minimum wage

Are not what they appear
Yeah, I look like a hare
But if you stop and you stare
I'm related to a deer

I got a jackalope face, I'm a jackalope guy
And I'm staring you down, creepy jackalope eye

Is it so hard to imagine
Is it so hard to believe
Something so outrageous
Something so far fetched
Well how 'bout Adam and Eve?

I know you gotta have faith
I know the need to hope
But the truth is always in place
It's right in front of my face
The mighty jackalope, yeah

In a jackalope space, on a jackalope high

I've been waiting all of my life

Wish I was dead - and I know you'd never miss me

Could love a nobody like me

And he wrapped his wings round him
And he felt like a stone
And the big salmon fought but the talons held true

And he shuttered as the world turned
From silver to blue
I stood there in awe though I'd seen it before
I was born in these mountains 

And I'll die here for sure
I've traveled around I've seen city lights
But nothin' that shined like a big sky at night

[Chorus]
Some mornings will find me up above the timberline
Lonesome don't seem like much once you're this high
When it's all said and done I usually find
Me and the eagle are of the same mind

Now when I was young I took me a wife
But she never took to the high country life
So now I'm alone I don't really mind
But her name echoes down form the canyon sometimes

[Chorus]

In my dreams there's a horse,
He stands eighteen hands high
He's as whit as the snow and there's fire in his eyes
And he'll bare only me though other have tried

And together we'll travel up across the divide

When I was young he took me by the hand 
Dragged me to the station at the break of dawn 
Said ""boy I got to show you somethin' 'fore it's gone"" 
She was blue and silver, she was right on time 
We rode that Texas Eagle on the Mopac line 

We had some sandwiches that Granma packed 
We rode to Palestine and hitchhiked back 
Home in time for supper with a tale to tell 
That night I dreamed I heard that lonesome whistle wail 

When I got old enough to take the train alone 
I rode that Texas Eagle down to San Antone 

Nowadays they don't make no trains 
Just the piggyback freighters and them Amtrak things 
They shut the Eagle down awhile ago 
Sold it to the railroad down in Mexico 
But every now and then that whistle's on my mind 
I ride that Texas Eagle cross the borderline",Texas Eagle,1999
Steve Earle,"There's a place everyone of us can go to 
Maybe you have been there once or twice 
Where all your friends just look at you and whisper 
And they want to give you nothing but advice 
When you walk in they all know what you're after 
And the higher that you get the more they'll see 
In a dark room filled with music, wine, and laughter 
Your eyes keep searching for her constantly 
Is it that one in the corner with her eyes filled with tears 
Or is she the one who's having fun drinking too much beer 
Every night it's the same sad old procedure 
The doorman winks at you on your way out 
'Cause deep inside he knows just what you're after 
And he's got something you can't live without 
There's nothing new that can be said about dirt 
And there's nothing left inside your heart but the same old hurt

Steve Earle,"Well I woke up Sunday morning,
With no way to hold my head, that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast,
Wasn't bad so I had one more, for dessert
Then I fumbled through my closet,
For my clothes and found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face and combed my hair,
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before on cigarettes and songs 
That I'd been pickin'
But I lit my first, and watched a small kid cussin' at a can 
That he was kickin'
Then I crossed the empty street and caught the Sunday smell 
Of someone fryin'chickin
And it took me back to somethin' that I had lost somehow, 
Somewhere along the way

[Chorus]
On the Sunday morning sidewalk, wishin' Lord that I was stoned
Cause there is something in a Sunday, makes a body feel alone
And there is nothing short of die'n, half a lonesome as the sound
On the sleepin' city sidewalks, Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy, 
With 'w(?)' laughin' little girl who he was swingin'
And I stopped beside a Sunday school,
And listened to a song that they were singin'
Then I headed back for home and somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringin'
And it echoed through the canyons like the disappearing dreams 
Of yesterday

[Chorus] 
On the Sunday morning sidewalk, wishing Lord that I was stoned

Her daddy owns a grocery store and she lives in Bristol town 

Carrie darlin' Carrie Carrie Brown I cry 
If I can't marry Carrie Brown, believe I'd rather die 

I laid my last ten dollars down 
Though I didn't need a thing 
Just to touch sweet Carrie Brown 

When she handed me my change 
I hung around 'til closin' time I scarce believed my eyes 
My darlin' walkin' arm in arm 
With a boy named Billy Wise 

I walked around in Bristol town a bitter broken man 
A heart that pined for Carrie Brown and a pistol in my hand 
We met again on State Street poor Billy Wise and me 
I shot him in Virginia and he died in Tennessee 

Now I'm down in the Bristol jail and all I do is cry

The vilest tub afloat
And the captain's brother was a railroad man and he met us at the boat
So I joined up with the 20th Maine
Like I said my friend I'm a fighting man
And we're marchin' south in the pouring rain
And we're all goin' down to dixieland

She holds me and keeps me from worry and woe
Well, they took everything that she gave, now they're gone
But i'll die on this mountain, this mountain's my home

I was young on this mountain but now i am old
And i knew every holler, every cool swimmin' hole
'til one night i lay down and woke up to find
That my childhood was over and i went down in the mine

There's a hole in this mountain and it's dark and it's deep
And god only knows all the secrets it keeps
There's a chill in the air only miners can feel
There're ghosts in the tunnels that the company sealed",The Mountain,1999
Steve Earle,"Come on pretty baby won't you take me by the hand 
I thought maybe that I could be your man 
And for a while (unknown) we could go in style

I gotta keep movin', 'cause baby I'm a travelin' man 
And there ain't a lot of women out there that understand 
But if you do (unknown) I'll be good to you 
Come on we're goin' on an outlaw's honeymoon

This ain't never been my home

But I am just a pilgrim on this road, boys

Steve Earle,"Got a lot of memories tied up in this place
So much time spent in so little space
What looked like the world through the eyes of a child
Kind of closes in on you after awhile
It's a place to grow up and a place to grow old
You keep your mouth shut and you do what you're told
I told mama the day that I ran
This ain't no place for an angry young man

Mama if you could see me right now
You'd be so sure you failed me somehow
Mama you never could understand
There ain't no peace for an angry young man

A cheap hotel a long way from my home
So many people make you feel so alone
Dreams die easy out here in these streets
And hearts grow cold in the city heat
I ain't never been the patient kind
I got to live like I please or die trying
At a filling station with a gun in my hand
The only way for an angry young man

Got a lot of memories tied up in this place
Tonight they're staring me right in the face
A lonely grave on the outskirts of town
It's three in the morning, ain't no one around
Just like a ghost I come out of the night
But I'll be gone before the morning light
Mama I hope that you understand

Ain't no candle in the window

It's come to wash away your blues 
It's all up to you 

No one said it would be easy 
But it don't have to be this hard 
If you're lookin' for a reason 
Just stand right where you are 
Now there ain't no one out to get you 
They've got to walk in their own shoes 

It's all up to you 
No one else can get you through 
Right or wrong, win or lose

Everybody knows my name 
But ever since the glass plant closed down 
Things round here ain't never been the same 
I got me a good job alright but some nights 
Take me to another time 
Back when I was No. 29 

I was pretty good then don't you know watch him go 
Buddy I could really fly 
Everyone in town came, hip flasks, horn blasts 
Any autumn Friday night 
Sally yelled her heart out push em back, way back 
I was hers and she was mine 
Back when I was No. 29 

We were playin' Smithville big boys, farm boys 
Second down and four to go 
Bubba brought the play in good call my ball 
Now they're gonna see a show 
But Bubba let his man go I cut back, heard it crack 
It still hurts me but I don't mind 
Reminds me I was No. 29 
 
 Now I go to the ballgames cold nights, half pints 
Friday nights I'm always here 
We got a pretty good team, good boys, strong boys 
District champs the last three years 
Got a little tailback pretty slick, real quick 
I take him for a steak sometimes

Steve Earle,"In the blue of the evening when the sun is low 
There's a shadow that creeps across my cell block floor 
And it comes to remind me what I'm in here for 

No, I'm not admittin' that I done the crime 
I'm only getting down to doin' time 
The passin' of day is no concern of mine 

There's a guard on the second shift comes on at three 
And he's always about a half inch off of me 
Like he needs to keep remindin' me that I'm not free 

God forgive him 'cause he doesn't see 
He's no less a prisoner 'cause he holds a key 
And God forbid he turn his back on me 

For every wall you build around your fear 
A thousand darker things are born in here 
There fed on contempt for all that you hold dear 

The truth is it doesn't matter what you do

And admit that what scares you is the me in you",The Truth,2000

I have no home 
Now the time has come 
No place to run

Now I'm thinking 'bout burning it down
And I'll be long gone when the fire burns out
On the way to another town
To see another city in another light
With my past behind me and my future bright

One of these days when I've had enough
Buddy, you ain't going to see me around
Just as soon as I get my courage up
Going to take it to another town

I used to walk these streets with my head held high
Now I'm always looking down at the ground
But I see my feet on the outbound side
Of a road to another town

And I'm going to tell everybody I know
Yeah I'm going to spread it around
That there's a great big world out there where I go
On the road to another town
To see another city in another light

Steve Earle,"Long ago and far away 
In a land no map can find 
There lived in long forgotten days 
A boy who never cried 
He was his mother's only child 
So she never wondered why 
Until the news spread far and wide 
Of a boy who never cried 

From fabled lands the pilgrims came 
To behold the silent child 
In ancient tones they sang his name 
Over every lonely mile 
There were those who came in reverence 
There were those who stood outside 
And whispered low in quatrains dim 
Of a boy who never cried 

Days grew long and short until 
The seasons turned to years 
The child grew strong and fairer still 
With a face unstained by tears 
And every maid and lady fair 
Held her breath when he passed by 
For their mothers bid them all beware 
Of a man who never cries 

He lived alone for all his years 
And then on the day he died 
He shed a single precious tear for a boy who never cried",The Boy Who Never Cried,2000

But everyone's in love with you 
In love with you 

Everyone's in love with you 
They fall down at your feet 
And impale themselves knowin' full well 
You'll only watch 'em bleed 
And they won't stop 'til the final drop 
Cause they think it's what you need 
And everyone's in love 
In love with you 

You want everyone to want you 
But you don't want anyone to need you

Steve Earle,"Well, I took a stroll on the old long walk 
Of a day-I-ay-I-ay 
I met a little girl and we stopped to talk 
Of a fine soft day-I-ay-I-ay 
And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do?
'Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue 
And I knew right then I'd be takin' a whirl 
'Round the Salthill Prom with a Galway girl 

We were halfway there when the rain came down 
Of a day-I-ay-I-ay 
She asked me up to her flat downtown 
Of a fine soft day-I-ay-I-ay 
And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do?
'Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue 
I took her hand and I gave her a twirl 
And I lost my heart to a Galway girl 
 
When I woke up I was all alone 
With a broken heart and a ticket home

Then I let her slip away 
Now I'm all alone and blue

There's a halo 'round the moon 

There's a ghost that haunts this town 
Just ask anyone you see 
He drags his chain around 
And no spell can set him free 
And he looks a lot like me 
And if you ask him why he's bound 
He'll just say he lost the key 
There's a ghost that haunts this town 

There's no shelter from the storm 
Without the lightnin' and the rain

And out on the highway late some night 
That's all right 
If that's all that it takes 
Even if my heart breaks 
Darlin' I can wait 

I have nothin' but time 
And this poor heart of mine 
Probably could use some rest 
When the ghosts are all gone 
You can leave your light on 
Shinin' through the loneliness 
Just like a beacon in the night 
Brighter than any star in sight 
But that's all right 
For as long as it takes 
For that mornin' to break

It doesn't get any lonelier than this 
And there's no place I can go

There's another place beyond here

I have always been the travelin' kind

The only promise that I didn't break
Was to love you until the day I die

I wish I'd never seen those city lights
A sight for a country boy to see
For every one that you see shinin' bright
Another is burnin' out like me
I wouldn't listen though you told me dear
I couldn't see the lie
But all the same I still love you tonight
And I'll love you until the day I die

They built this prison just for fools like me
Who don't know a treasure from a stone
I killed a man now I won't ever see

I won't have to cry alone I know 
'Cause you will answer when I call

When the sun shines down on my heart it's gone 
But there's another night comin' I know

So I'll sit back and watch the sun go down
If it comes back up then this day's a good one

You know I wouldn't be that surprised
I'm just a regular guy and I'll work until the day that I die
I'm too young to quit, too old to hire
These days a man can't afford to retire

Steve Earle,"The last time I thought about leavin'
Was the last time I made her cry
I talked myself out of believin'
That true, true love never dies

The first time I thought of returnin'
Was just ten lonesome miles out of town
But my foolish pride kept these wheels a-turnin'
Yeah, there was nothin' on this earth gonna shut me down

But if I had one drop of water
For each and every tear that I have cried
I'd sail back to her on an ocean of sorrow
True, true love never dies

Well, the fires of anger turn to ashes
Your pride will forsake you by and by
The lonesome is not surely passin'
That ol' true, true love never dies

But if I had one drop of water
For each and every tear that I have cried
I'd sail back to her on an ocean of sorrow
True, true love never dies
No, it never does

Well, if I had one drop of water
For each and every tear that I have cried
Well, I'd sail back to her on an ocean of sorrow
True, true love never dies

Well, I'd sail back to her on an ocean of sorrow
True, true love never dies
It never dies
It never does
No, No, No

He was bustin' at the seams
He licked his finger and he checked the wind

Like a scene from a costume hall 
Decked out in the colors in Europe 
And on fire with the hope of it all 

There stood my father's own father stood huddled 
With the tired and hungry and scared 
Turn of the century pilgrims 
Bound by the dream that they shared 

They were standing in lines just like cattle 
Poked and prodded and shoved 
Some were one desk away from sweet freedom 
Some were were torn from someone they love 

Through this sprawling tower of babel 
Came a young man confused and alone 
Determined and bound for America 
And carryin' everything that he owned

Sometimes when I look in my grandfather's Immigrant Eyes 
I see that day reflected and I can't hold my feelings inside 
I see starting with nothing and working hard all of his life 
So don't take it for granted say grandfather's Immigrant Eyes 

Now he rocks and stares out the window 
But his eyes are still just as clear 
As the day he sailed through the harbor 
And come ashore on the island of tears

Touch beautiful things
Let all the skies surround you
Swim with the swans
And believe that upon
Some glorious dawn
Love will find you

Come some day
I'm bound away
Wind and wings on the water
Whatever may
You must stay
And remain my beautiful daughter

Steve Earle,"My father had a Randall knife
My mother gave it to him
When he went off to WWII
To save us all from ruin
If you've ever held a Randall knife
Then you know my father well
If a better blade was ever made
It was probably forged in hell

My father was a good man
A lawyer by his trade
And only once did I ever see
Him misuse the blade
It almost cut his thumb off
When he took it for a tool
The knife was made for darker things
And you could not bend the rules

He let me take it camping once
On a Boy Scout jamboree
And I broke a half an inch off
Trying to stick it in a tree
I hid it from him for a while
But the knife and he were one
He put it in his bottom drawer
Without a hard word one

There it slept and there it stayed
For twenty some odd years
Sort of like Excalibur
Except waiting for a tear

My father died when I was forty
And I couldn't find a way to cry
Not because I didn't love him
Not because he didn't try
I'd cried for every lesser thing
Whiskey, pain and beauty
But he deserved a better tear
And I was not quite ready

So we took his ashed out to sea
And poured `em off the stern
And threw the roses in the wake
Of everything we'd learned
When we got back to the house
They asked me what I wanted
Not the lawbooks not the watch
I need the things he's haunted

My hand burned for the Randall knife
There in the bottom drawer
And I found a tear for my father's life
And all that it stood for",Randall Knife,2001

Until I reach home on the morrow
Never never to wander again

Australia to Perth

I tasted your earth
Sung out my heart
For what it was worth
Never again shall I ramble

There's nowhere left
In this world where to go
My arms, my legs they're a-tremblin'
Thoughts both clouded and blue as the sky
Not even worth the rememberin'

Now as I stumble
And reel to my bed
All that I've done
All that I've said
Means nothin' to me
I'd soon as be dead
All of this world be forgotten

No words of comfort
No words of advice
Nothin' to offer a stranger
Gone the love, gone the spite

The ground's gettin' close

Well the sheriff had caught him stealin' chickens and such 
By the time that he was ten 

And one day his daddy took a ten dollar bill 
And he tucked it in his hand 
He said I can tell you're headed for trouble son 
And your momma wouldn't understand 

So he took that money and his brothers old bay 
And he left without a word of thanks 
Fell in with a crowd in some border town 
And took to robbing banks 

Well outside the law your luck will run out fast 
And a few years came and went 
'Till he's trapped in an alley in Abilene 
With all but four shells spent 

And he realized praying was the only thing 
That he hadn't ever tried 
Well he wasn't sure he knew quite how 
But he looked up to the sky 

Said you don't owe me nothing and as far as I know 
Lord don't owe nothing to you 
And I ain't asking for a miracle Lord 
Just a little bit of luck will do 

And you know I ain't never prayed before 
But it always seemed to me 
If praying is the same as begging Lord 
I don't take no charity 

Yeah but right now Lord with my back to the wall 
Can't help but recall 
How they nearly hung me for stealing a horse 
In Fort Smith Arkansas 

Judge Parker said guilty and the gavel came down 
Just like a cannon shot 
And I went away quietly 
And I began to file and plot 

Well they sent the preacher down to my cell 
He said the Lord is your only hope 
He's the only friend that you gonna have 
When you hit the end of Parker's rope 

Well I guess he could of kept on preaching till Christmas 
But he turned his back on me 
I put a home made blade to that golden throat 
And asked the deputy for the key 

Well it ain't the first close call I ever had 
As I'm sure you already know 
I had some help from you Lord and the devil himself 
It's been strictly touch and go 
Yeah but who in the hell am I talking to

Steve Earle,"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust

A long time ago before the ice and the snow
Giants walked this land each step they took
The mighty mountains shook and the trees took
A knee and the seas rolled in
Then one day they say the sky gave way
And death rained down, and made a terrible sound
There was fire everywhere and nothing was spared
That walked on the land or flew through the air
When all was over the slate wiped clean with a touch
There God stood and He saw it was good
And He said, ""Ashes to ashes and dust to dust""

The sea gave birth and it crawled up on the dirt
And stood up and took a look around
Said, ""I'm the next big thing and the gift that I bring
Comes directly from God, so there ain't no holding me down""
So he crowned himself king now no one remembers his name
But the seed that he sowed took the show on the road
There was blood on their hands and a plague on the land
They drew a line in the sand and made their last stand
God made us in His image and it's in God that we trust
When asked about the men that had died by their hands
They said, ""Ashes to ashes and dust to dust""

Now, nobody lives forever nothing stands the test of time
Oh, you heard 'em say, ""Never say never""
But it's always best to keep it in mind that every tower ever built tumbles
And no matter how strong, no matter how tall
Someday even great walls will crumble and every idol ever raised falls
Someday even man's best laid plans will lie twisted and covered in rust
We've done all that we can but it slipped through our hands
And it's ashes to ashes and dust to dust",Ashes to Ashes,2002
Steve Earle,"What if I told you it was done with mirrors?
What if I showed you it was all a lie?
Better be careful someone might hear ya

What if I said you were only dreamin'?
What you wanna bet that all you gotta do
Is open up your eyes and you will wake up screamin'
When you realize that it's all come true?

Hush, now, don't you believe it
Cover your head and close your eyes
Now, take it or leave it
Go back to bed now, don't you cry

Half a million soldiers fly across the water
One in ten are never comin' back again
Fifty thousand sons who never grew to fathers

What if you could've been there on that day in Dallas?
What if you could wrestle back the hands of time?
Maybe somehtin' could've been done in Memphis
We wouldn't be livin' in a dream that's died

Go on and tell yourself again there are no secrets
Go on and tell yourself that you don't want to know
It's best that you believe that you don't hear the footsteps

Will lay down their swords forever in Jerusalem

Will lie down in peace together in Jerusalem

Rollin' high and mighty traps 
Pounced with fire on flaming roads 
Using ideas as my maps 
""We'll meet on edges, soon,"" said I 
Proud 'neath heated brow 
Ah, but I was so much older then 
I'm younger than that now 
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth 
""Rip down all hate,"" I screamed 
Lies that life is black and white 
Spoke from my skull. I dreamed 
Romantic facts of musketeers 
Foundationed deep, somehow 
Ah, but I was so much older then 
I'm younger than that now. 
Girls' faces formed the forward path 
From phony jealousy 
To memorizing politics 
Of ancient history 
Flung down by corpse evangelists 
Unthought of, though, somehow 
Ah, but I was so much older then 
I'm younger than that now 
A self-ordained professor's tongue 
Too serious to fool 
Spouted out that liberty 
Is just equality in school 
""Equality,"" I spoke the word 
As if a wedding vow 
Ah, but I was so much older then 
I'm younger than that now 
In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand 
At the mongrel dogs who teach 
Fearing not that I'd become my enemy 
In the instant that I preach 
My pathway led by confusion boats 
Mutiny from stern to bow 
Ah, but I was so much older then 
I'm younger than that now 
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats 
Too noble to neglect 
Deceived me into thinking 
I had something to protect 
Good and bad, I define these terms 
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow

I'm younger than that now",My Back Pages,2002

Know the tale of the Donnelly's Oh 
Died at the hands of a mob that night 
Every child and man by the oil torch light 
Jim Donnelly was no angel sure 
But they burned his barn, broke down the door 
Well the children cried while they killed old Jim 
Then they killed his wife, then they turned on them 
No judge, no jury, no hangman, no justice in Ontario 
A hundred years or more have turned 
And you always hear how much we've learned 
Well a man lay dead in a Port Hope bar 
And the blood ran red on a hardwood floor 
And the big men ran through the nearest door 
Only one man knew what had happened for sure 
Well one and all wore the outlaws' brand 
And the big bikes roared through the Great Northland 
When you live on the edge of the law 
You know, justice in Ontario 
Blue smoke still hung in the air 
No one spoke when the cops got there 
Well the local constable made the call 
Send us Corporal Terry Hall 
They all sang a different tune 
When Corporal Hall walked in the room 
With his picture book and a list of names 
One by one the witnesses came 
And they told him what he wanted to know 
Justice in Ontario 
The provincial cops searched far and wide 
And the outlaws ran but they could not hide 
And they brought em in every single one 
Save the man who actually fired the gun 
It was down in London, they were tried 
And the guilty man stood free outside 
When he took the stand to pay his debt 
The judge was blind and the jury deaf 
In Kingston Town they're locked up still 
When the sun goes down and the air is chill 
You could swear you heard Jim Donnelly's ghost cry

I'm Twenty-Nine years old
I was born in Oklahoma
Quarter Cherokee I'm told

Don't remember Oklahoma
Been so long since I left home
Seems like I've always been in prison
Like I've always been alone

Didn't mean to hurt nobody
Never thought I'd cross that line
I held up a filling station
Like I'd done a hundred times

The kid done like I told him
He lay face down on the floor
Guess I'll never know what made me
Turn and walk back through that door

The shot rang out like thunder
My ears rang like a bell
No one came runnin'
So I called the cops myself

Took their time to get there
And I guess I could'a run
I knew I should be feeling something
But I never shed tear one

I didn't even make the papers
'Cause I only killed one man
But my trial was over quickly
And then the long hard wait began

Court appointed lawyer
Couldn't look me in the eye
He just stood up and closed his briefcase
When they sentenced me to die

Now my waitin's over
As the final hour drags by
I ain't about to tell you
That I don't deserve to die

But there's twenty-seven men here
Mostly black, brown and poor
Most of em are guilty
Who are you to say for sure?

So when the preacher comes to get me
And they shave off all my hair
Could you take that long walk with me
Knowing hell is waitin' there

Could you pull that switch yourself sir
With a sure and steady hand
Could you still tell youself
That you're better than I am

With an uneasy feeling in my chest

Tear your eyes from paradise 
And rise again somehow 
If you run into Jesus 
Maybe he can help you out

'Til it comes 
I'll go on 

My heart's a little ragged but it's all that I got 
So I'm gonna give it a try

Steve Earle,"I used to listen to the radio
And I don't guess
They're listenin' to me no more
They talk too much but that's okay
I don't understand a single word they say
Piss and moan about the immigrants
But donâ??t say nothin' about the president
A democracy don't work that way
I can say anything I wanna say

So fuck the FCC
Fuck the FBI
Fuck the CIA
Livin' in the motherfuckin' USA

People tell me that I'm paranoid
And I admit I'm gettin'
Pretty nervous, boy
It just gets tougher everyday
To sit around and watch it
While it slips away

Just don't forget your history

Steve Earle,"Beggin' your pardon there stranger
You look like you're new to this town
We're a long way away from the beach here
You won't see many gringos around
Well I come from West Colorado
And I've wandered this world far and wide
I've lived for some years in the shadows
And my eyes are unused to this light
If you buy me a strong drink of whiskey
I will tell you the tale of my life
It's long and it's sad but it fits me
And it may bring a tear to your eye

All the men of my family were solidiers
The hard fightin' straight talkin' kind
When my turn came all that was over
But I'd already made up my mind
I was there when we blew though Grenada
And I still have to ask myself why
Then we took down that fool Noriega
That's where I caught the good colonel's eye
Well he asked me if I loved my country
And before I had time to reply
He regaled me with tales of past glories
I believed every one of his lies

So I left my old life behind me
Turned my back on my family and friends
And I did everything that they asked me
And I lost some sleep now and again
And I lived like a thief and assassin
I smuggled their poisons sometimes
Until I asked the wrong question in passin'

And the colonel himself dropped the dime
So if you're ever in west Colorado
Tell the folks in Durango goodbye
There's a price on my head and I can't go
So I'll just wait around here 'til I die",The Gringo's Tale,2004
Steve Earle,"When I pulled out of Basra they all wished me luck
Just like they always did before
With a bulletproof screen on the hood of my truck
And a Bradley on my back door
And I wound her up and shifted her down
And I offered this prayer to my lord
I said ""God get me back home to Houston alive
And I won't drive a truck anymore""

Early in the mornin' and I'm rollin' fast
Haulin' nine thousand gallons of high test gas
Sergeant on the radio hollerin' at me
Look out up ahead here come a R.P.G.
If I ever get home to Houston alive
Then I won't drive a truck anymore

I've driven the big rigs for all of my life
And my radio handle's ""Train""
Down steep mountain roads on the darkest of nights
I had ice water in my veins
And I come over here 'cause I just didn't care
Now I'm older and wiser by far
If I ever get home to Houston alive
Then I won't drive a truck anymore

Great God A'mighty what was wrong with me
I know the money's good but buddy can't you see
You can't take it with you and that ain't no lie
I don't wanna let 'em get me I'm too young to die

Then I won't drive a truck anymore",Home to Houston,2004
Steve Earle,"I been watchin' you watchin' me
I could feel your eyes from way across the room
But now that I'm holdin' you close I can see
Ain't no way I'm gonna get around you
I won't tell you I don't need you tonight
I won't pretend I ain't burnin' inside
Your skin glowin' soft in the silver moonlight
The shadows where the promises hide
The bittersweet taste of your kiss
It's all more than I can resist

If you're thinkin' â??bout breakin' my heart
You might as well just pick up your little black dress and go
Somebody else already tore it apart
And I thought you should know

Maybe this is all that you want
Maybe you're just as lonesome as me
A shoulder that you can cry on
A warm safe place you can be
Someone to call in the middle of the night
When the ghosts in your bedroom won't rest
Two arms to hold you tight
I promise that I'll do my best
To give you everything I got to give
And keep your secrets for as long as I live",I Thought You Should Know,2004
Steve Earle,"I was eight years old when my granddaddy died 
He that showed me the signs I still miss him sometimes 
Been a long time ago but his words still ring true 
Whatever you do be a seeker 

All these years I have wandered and wherever I roamed 
I was never alone or forsaken I know 
Somewhere way out yonder I know I will find 
That a bright beacon shines for a seeker 

You can't always believe your eyes 
It's your heart that sees through all the lies 
And the first answer follows the first question asked 
The mystery unmasked by the seeker 

In a world full of sorrow, hunger and pain 
It's so hard to explain why I'm still travelin' 
But there's a new day tomorrow and maybe I'll hold 
Something brighter than gold to a seeker",The Seeker,2004
Steve Earle,"I was walkin' down the street
In the town where I was born

That the world had turned around

Yeah, it's your good rockin' daddy down from Tennessee

But no local yokel gonna shut me down
'Cause me and my boys got this rig unwound
And we've come a thousand miles from a guitar town

Nothin' ever happened 'round my hometown
And I ain't the kind to just hang around
But I heard someone callin' my name one day
And I followed that voice down the lost highway

Everybody told me you can't get far
On thirty-seven dollars and a jap guitar
Now I'm smokin' into Texas with the hammer down
And a rockin' little combo from the guitar town

Hey pretty baby don't you know it ain't my fault?
I love to hear the steel belts hummin' on the asphalt
Wake up in the middle of the night in a truck stop
Stumble in the restaurant wonderin' why I don't stop

Well Gotta keep rockin' well I still can
I gotta two pack habit and a motel tan
When my boots hit the boards I'm a brand new man
With my back to the riser I make my stand

I'll push as long as I'm alive
But I don't know how long I'll last

Steve Earle,"This is the best time of the day?the dawn 
The final cleansing breath unsullied yet 
By acrid fume or death?s cacophony 
The rank refuse of unchained ambition 
And pray, deny me not but know me now, 
Your faithful retainer stands resolute 
To serve his liege lord without recompense 
Perchance to fall and perish namelessly 
No flag-draped bier or muffled drum to set 
The cadence for a final dress parade 
But it was not always thus?remember? 
Once you worshipped me and named me a god 
In many tongues and made offering lest 
I exact too terrible a tribute 

Take heed for I am weary, ancient 
And decrepit now and my time grows short 
There are no honorable frays to join 

Only mean death dealt out in dibs and dabs 
Or horror unleashed from across oceans 
Assail me not with noble policy 
For I care not at all for platitude 
And surrender such tedious detail 
To greater minds than mine and nimbler tongues 
Singular in their purpose and resolve 
And presuming to speak for everyman 

Oh, for another time, a distant field 
And there a mortal warrior?s lonely grave 
But duty charges me remain until 
The end the last battle of the last war 
Until that ?morrow render unto me 
That which is mine my stipend well deserved 
The fairest flower of your progeny 
Your sons, your daughters your hopes and your dreams 
The cruel consequence of your conceit",Warrior,2006

To build his family a home 
With his wife and new baby 
And what little goods that they owned 
Had a good yoke of oxen 
And hand tools for clearing the land 
And he built him a church 
'Cause he was a God fearin' man 
All of his children when there 
Worshiped here through the years 
On down to my granddad 
He's buried 'bout 40 yards from here

And where I took me a wife 
And if I have my say so 
That's where I'll rest when it's time

When I'm dead and I'm gone 
Won't you carry me home 
To that little white church

But I've done come this far 
And it's too late for changin' 
When this race has been run 
Take me back where I came from 
And let me return what I took from the ground 
When this body won't carry me no further 
Take me back 
And lay me down

Won't grow much of nothin' they say 
'Cept tomatoes and peaches

Thought it was the finest thing I ever had seen 
So l asked if I could have one someday when I grew up 
Mama dropped a dozen eggs, she really blew up 
She really blew up and I didn't understand 
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand 

The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand 
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand 

My very first pistol was a cap and ball Colt 
Shoot as fast as lightnin' but it loads a might slow 
Loads a might slow and soon I found out 
It can get you into trouble but it can't get you out 
So then I went and bought myself a Colt 45 
Called a peacemaker but I never knew why 
Never knew why, I didn't understand 
Cause Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand

Caught a miner cheating I shot the dog down 
Shot the dog down, watched the man fall

Except to wander these hills forgotten
With the Oxycontin blues

Well I never cared much for whiskey
'Cause it only made daddy mean
Wrapped a little bit tight they tell me
For the methamphetamine
Then my cousin come up from Knoxville
And he taught me a thing or two
Now I'm headed nowhere but downhill
With the Oxycontin blues

Got a dollar bill in my pocket
Got a half a tank in my truck
I'm gonna go and pawn grandma's locket
Hell, maybe it'll change my luck
Ain't nothin gonna be right no how
'Cause I know I can't ever lose
This devil that's draggin' me down
And the Oxycontin blues",Oxycontin Blues,2007
Steve Earle,"North wind blowin' like a hurricane house
Old man leanin' like he's pullin' a plow
Neck bowed, bendin' like a willow bough

Red sky color of the end of time
Bleeds dry runnin' down the center line
Wise guy pretends he doesn't see the signs

Bad news everybody talkin' 'bout
A short fuse a half an inch from burnin' out
All used up beyond a reasonable doubt

Make way for his majesty the prodigal king
Still taste the poison when you're kissin' the ring
Don't say he never gave you anything

Deep breath the calm before the storm begins
Cold sweat pretend that you ain't listenin'
Don't bet on gettin' by with that again

Short ride from here to where the beast resides
Fine line that separates the shadows inside
Make mine a double shot of cyanide",Red Is the Color,2007

Sparkle and shine
Sparkle and shine
My baby sparkle and shine
And everyone knows she's fine
She blesses all that she sees
A toss of her hair and a kiss in the breeze
But she don't love no one but me
And I can't believe she's mine

Shimmering she moves
Sunlight all around her
Even when she's blue
Silver clouds surround her

Big tall high heel shoes on her feet
Walks by and my heart skips a beat
And I'm stumblin' like a fool
She give me somethin' so sweet
I can't sleep y'all and I can't eat
Sparks fly whenever we meet
I'm breathless 'cause she's so cool

Anywhere she goes
I can only follow
She'll be there I know

One of these nights I'm gonna sing a different tune
All night long beneath the silvery moon
When the war is over
And the union's strong
Won't sing no more angry songs
One of these nights I'm gonna sing a different tune

Someday when my struggle's through
I won't have to strive
Until then all I can do
Is let my hammer fly

One of these days I'm gonna lay this hammer down
Leave my burden restin' on the ground
When the air don't choke ya and the ocean's clean
And kids don't die for gasoline
One of these days I'm gonna lay this hammer down

Worked his whole life long
When he made that hammer ring
He always sang this song

String around my finger but I don't remember why

All the harps they sound empty when she lifts her lips to the sky
The brown of her skin makes her hair seem a soft golden rainfall
That spills from the mountains to the bottomless depths of her eyes

Well, she stands all around me her hands slowly sifting the sunshine
All the laughter that linger down deep 'neath her smilin' is free
Well, it spins and it twirls like a hummingbird lost in the morning
And caresses the south wind and silently sails to the sea

Ah, the sculptor stands stricken and the artist he throws away his brushes
When her image comes dancin' the sun she turns sullen with shame
And the birds they go silent the wind stops his sad mournful singing
When the trees of the forest start gently to whisper'in her name

So as softly she wanders I'll desperately follow her footsteps
And I'll chase after shadows that offer a trace of her sight
Ah, they promise eternally that she lays hidden within them
But I find they've deceived me and sadly I bid them goodbye

So the serpent slide softly away with these moments of laughter
And the the old washy woman has finish her cleanin' and gone

And a lonely child longingly looks for a place to belong",(Quicksilver Daydreams Of) Maria,2009

Here's to all the poetry
And the picking' down the line
I'll miss the system here
The bottom's low and the trebleÃ¯Â¿Â½s clear
But it don't pay to think too much
On things you leave behind
Well, I may be gone, but it won't be long
I'll be bringing back the melody
And the rhythm that I find

We all got holes to fill
Them holes are all that's real
Some fall on you like a storm
Sometimes you dig your own
The choice is yours to make
Time is yours to take
Some dive into the sea
Some toil upon the stone
Well, to live's to fly awe low and high
So shake the dust off of your wings
And the sleep out of your eye

And the tears out of your eye",To Live Is to Fly,2009

I saw my first pistol in the general store 
In the general store, when I was thirteen 

Thought it was the finest thing I ever had seen 
So l asked if I could have one someday when I grew up 
Mama dropped a dozen eggs, she really blew up 
She really blew up and I didn't understand 
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand 

The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand 
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand 

My very first pistol was a cap and ball Colt 
Shoot as fast as lightnin' but it loads a might slow 
Loads a might slow and soon I found out 
It can get you into trouble but it can't get you out 
So then I went and bought myself a Colt 45 
Called a peacemaker but I never knew why 
Never knew why, I didn't understand 
Cause Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand 

Well I get into a card game in a company town 
Caught a miner cheating I shot the dog down 
Shot the dog down, watched the man fall 
Never touched his holster, never had a chance to draw 
The trial was in the morning and they drug me out of bed 
Asked me how I pleaded, not guilty I said 
Not guilty I said, you've got the wrong man

Steve Earle,"There's a Vietnam Vet with a cardboard sign
Sitting there by the left turn line
The flag on his wheelchair flapping in the breeze
One leg missing and both hands free

No one?s paying much mind to him
The V.A. budget?s just stretched so thin
And now there's more coming back from the Mideast war
We can't make it here anymore

And that big ol? building was the textile mill
That fed our kids and it paid our bills
But they turned us out and they closed the doors
'Cause we can't make it here anymore

You see those pallets piled up on the loading dock
They're just gonna sit there ?til they rot
?Cause there's nothing to ship, nothing to pack
Just busted concrete and rusted tracks

Empty storefronts around the square
There's a needle in the gutter and glass everywhere
You don't come down here unless you're looking to score
We can't make it here anymore

The bar?s still open but man it?s slow
The tip jar?s light and the register?s low
The bartender don't have much to say
The regular crowd gets thinner each day

Some have maxed out all their credit cards
Some are working two jobs and living in cars
Minimum wage won't pay for a roof, won't pay for a drink
If you gotta have proof just try it yourself Mr. C.E.O.
See how far 5.15 an hour will go
Take a part time job at one your stores
I bet you can't make it here anymore

And there's a high school girl with a bourgeois dream
Just like the pictures in the magazine
She found on the floor of the laundromat
A woman with kids can forget all that

If she comes up pregnant what'll she do
Forget the career and forget about school
Can she live on faith? Live on hope?
High on Jesus or hooked on dope
When it?s way too late to just say no
You can't make it here anymore

Now I'm stocking shirts in the Wal-Mart store
Just like the ones we made before
?Cept this one came from Singapore
I guess we can't make it here anymore

Should I hate a people for the shade of their skin
Or the shape of their eyes or the shape I'm in
Should I hate ?em for having our jobs today
No I hate the men sent the jobs away

I can see them all now, they haunt my dreams
All lily white and squeaky clean
They've never known want, they'll never know need
Their shit don't stink and their kids won't bleed
Their kids won't bleed in their damn little war
And we can't make it here anymore

Will I work for food, will I die for oil
Will kill for power and to us the spoils
The billionaires get to pay less tax
The working poor get to fall through the cracks

So let ?em eat jellybeans let ?em eat cake
Let ?em eat shit, whatever it takes
They can join the Air Force or join the Corps
If they can't make it here anymore

So that's how it is, that's what we got
If the president wants to admit it or not
You can read it in the paper, read it on the wall
Hear it on the wind if you're listening at all
Get out of that limo, look us in the eye
Call us on the cell phone tell us all why

In Dayton Ohio or Portland Maine
Or a cotton gin out on the great high plains
That's done closed down along with the school
And the hospital and the swimming pool

Dust devils dance in the noonday heat
There's rats in the alley and trash in the street
Gang graffiti on a boxcar door
We can't make it here anymore

I ended up out walkin' in the rain

As long as I got money they don't whine

Steve Earle,"The name she gave was Caroline
A daughter of a miner
And her ways were free
It seemed to me
That sunshine walked beside her

She came from Spencer
Across the hill
She said her pa had sent her
'Cause the coal was low
And soon the snow
Would turn the skies to winter

She said she'd come
To look for work
She was not seeking favors
And for a dime a day
And a place to stay
She'd turn those hands to labor

Ah, but the times were hard, Lord
The jobs were few
All through Tecumseh valley
But she asked around
And a job she found
Tending bar at Gypsy Sally's

She saved enough to get back home
When the spring replaced the winter
But her dreams were denied
Her pa had died
The word come down from Spencer

She took to whorin' out on the streets
With all the lust inside her
And many a man
Returned again
Just to lay himself beside her

They found her down beneath the stairs
That lead to Gypsy Sally's
In her hand when she died
Was a note that cried
""Fare thee well

And out on the valley way below
It sweeps the grave of my darling
When I die that's where I want to go

Lord, send the angels for my darling
And take her to that home on high
I'll wait my time out here on earth love
And come to you when I die

Our names are carved upon the tombstone
I promised you before you died

Is the prairie and the sky

And I don't want to hear a sad story
Full of heartbreak and desire

I was in the wilderness
And the canyon was on fire
And I stood on the mountain

I watched it burn, I watched it burn

I would hold my life in his saving grace
I would walk all the way from Boulder to Birmingham

Of the trucks as they move down
Out on 95
And pretend that it's the ocean
Coming down to wash me clean, to wash me clean

I saw my first pistol in the general store 
In the general store, when I was thirteen 
I thought it was the finest thing I ever had seen 

So I asked if I could have one someday when I grew up 
Mama dropped a dozen eggs, she really blew up 
She really blew up, and she didn't understand 
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand 

The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand 
Mama says the pistol is the devil's right hand 

Me very first pistol was a cap and ball Colt 
Shoots as fast as lightnin' but it loads a might slow 
It loads a might slow, and soon I found out 
It'll get you into trouble but it can't get you out 

So then I went and bought myself a Colt 45 
Called a peacemaker but I never knew why 
I never knew why, I didn't understand 
Mama says the pistol is the devil's right hand 

The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand 
Mama says the pistol is the devil's right hand 

Got into a card game in a company town 
I caught a miner cheating, I shot the dog down 
I shot the dog down, I watched the man fall 
He never touched his holster, never had a chance to draw 

The trial was in the morning and they drug me out of bed 
Asked me how I pleaded, not guilty I said 
Not guilty I said, you've got the wrong man 
Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand

Steve Earle & the Dukes,"Ooh pretty baby what you doin' to me 
The way your kisses burn right through me 
I don't think I can last much longer 
I get weaker and my love gets stronger 
I don't think that my heart can take it 
One little slip of a word might break it 
Well believe me baby this ain't no crush 
I think maybe I love you too much 

Baby, baby, baby, oh baby, ooh baby, baby, I love you too much 
Baby, baby, baby, oh baby, ooh baby, baby, I love you too much 

I tell myself that it ain't no big thing 
Then you give another little tug on that heart string 
Well you cut me girl and I'm still bleedin' 
Well just touch me baby, that's all I'm needin' 
You must think that I'm easy, don't ya 
But I got scars that I've never shown ya

I think maybe I love you too much",I Love You Too Much,1987
Steve Earle & the Dukes,"No matter which way the wind blows 
It's always cold when you're alone

It's all up to you 

No one said it would be easy 
But it don't have to be this hard 
If you're lookin' for a reason 

Just stand right where you are 
Now there ain't no one out to get you 
They've got to walk in their own shoes 

It's all up to you 
No one else can get you through 
Right or wrong, win or lose 
It's all up to you 

You can stand out on that highway 
Look as far as you can see 
But when you get to that horizon 
There's always someplace else to be

Steve Earle & the Dukes,"I was born and raised here this town's my town 
Everybody knows my name 
But ever since the glass plant closed down 
Things round here ain't never been the same 
I got me a good job alright but some nights 
Take me to another time 
Back when I was No. 29 

I was pretty good then don't you know watch him go 
Buddy I could really fly 
Everyone in town came, hip flasks, horn blasts 
Any autumn Friday night 
Sally yelled her heart out push em back, way back 
I was hers and she was mine 
Back when I was No. 29 

We were playin' Smithville big boys, farm boys 
Second down and four to go 
Bubba brought the play in good call my ball 
Now they're gonna see a show 
But Bubba let his man go I cut back, heard it crack 
It still hurts me but I don't mind 
Reminds me I was No. 29 
 
 Now I go to the ballgames cold nights, half pints 
Friday nights I'm always here 
We got a pretty good team, good boys, strong boys 
District champs the last three years 
Got a little tailback pretty slick, real quick 
I take him for a steak sometimes 
Nowadays he's No. 29 

I don't follow rainbows, big dreams, brass rings 
I've already captured mine 
Back when I was No. 29",No. 29,1987
Steve Earle & the Dukes,"The old man loaded up everything that he owned 
On a wagon and headed out west 
The old woman fearlessly faced the unknown 
'Cause she figured he knew what was best 
And they settled down hard on a government grant 
With six mouths to feed and forty acres to plant 

And the rain came down 
Like an angel come down from above 
And the rain came down 
It'll wash you away and there ain't never enough 

Fall turned to winter another year gone 
Over and over again 
Some took their lives from their land and moved on 
And some stayed on to plow it back in 
And the good Lord he giveth and he taketh away 
And the restless shall go and the faithful shall stay 

Now my grandaddy died in the room he was born in 
Twenty-three summers ago 
But I could have sworn he was beside me this morning 
When the sheriff showed up at my door 
So don't you come around here with your auctioneer man 
'Cause you can have the machines but you ain't taking my land",The Rain Came Down,1987
Steve Earle & the Dukes,"Now I'm a pretty big man around this town 
I got me the hottest little Chevy around 
My sweet little '66 
She got a yellow front fender and a gray one on the back 
But my income tax is comin' and I'm gonna paint her black 
Sweet little '66 

She got the 396, she got the four on the floor 
And those stickers in the window ain't just for show 
My sweet little '66 

Now old Bubba and me built her back in '79 
Then he went into the army so now she's all mine 
Sweet little '66 
I used to run her down on River Road and make a little dough 
Can't afford another ticket so I'm laying kinda low 
Me and my '66 

Now she ain't too good on gasoline, she burns a little oil 
But she was built by union labor on American soil

Steve Earle & the Dukes,"I got out of work and I headed for the neighborhood beer joint 
I sat around and had a beer with the boys like I always do 
Well I didn't have nothin' to say anyway there ain't no point 
There's just something 'bout a Monday that always makes me blue 

Well it was well after dark so I knew my wife and kids were waitin' 
And I guess I took a left where I generally take a right 
Well I filled her up with gas, checked the oil at the Texaco station 
I threw the car seat in the dumpster and headed off into the night 

Woo-ohh-ooh-ooh-ooh 
There's somethin' 'bout a Monday that always makes me blue 
Well I headed south on 35 hell bent for vinyl 
I hadn't never had her up past 55 before 

Well somethin' 'bout that little red line always looked so final 
Buddy you'd be surprised how fast a Chevrolet truck can go 

Now, down in Mexico they've got a little place called Boystown 
Where a man's still a man if you know what I'm talkin' about 
Well, I walked into the Cadillac bar and I laid my cash down 
I said ""there's plenty more where that came from"" and the lights went out 
 
Well I woke up in a county jail 'cross the line in Laredo 
With a headache and a deputy staring at me through the door 
Well he said ""Now how you got across that river alive, I don't know 
But your wife just made your bail so now you're really dead for sure"" 

Now my wife, she called my boss and cried so I got my job back 
And the boys down at the plant, they whisper and stare at me 
Yea well my wife can find a lot of little jobs to keep me on the right track 
Well, but that's a small price to pay for a week of living dangerously

Steve Earle & the Dukes,"I dreamed you were standing 
On the edge of the world 
And I thought I heard you call out 
With one foot on the rock 
And one a cloud 
Was it just the wind that I heard

Close your eyes 
This world won't stop spinning you know 
Close your eyes 
Why don't you just let go 

Thousands of people, searchin' out there 
Most of 'em lookin' for love 
But nothing, is something 
That there's plenty of 
In time we'll all get our share

Steve Earle & the Dukes,"She's a country girl 
Young and pretty 
She want to see the world 
So she headed for the city 
She was entertained in all the right places 
Knew half of the names, and all of the faces 

Just a country girl 
If her daddy could see her now 
Just a country girl 
Well you'd never recognize your little angel now 
She comes down from way South, 
She talks slow and lazy 

When she opened her mouth the city boys went crazy 
They fed her pink champagne, give her a headache 
Cheap cocaine makes her meaner than a rattlesnake 
Reelin' and a rockin' couldn't get enough 
Crawlin' when the sun comes up 

And payback's hell 
There's a bag lady talkin' to her shopping cart 
Don't you know the scary part 
Is she saw herself",Country Girl,1990
Steve Earle & the Dukes,"Nights fall hard on Hollywood 
The stars don't come out like they should 
Up above the world so high tonight 
They can't outshine the neon lights 
Now the golden days are gone for good 
In Esmeralda's Hollywood 

She comes out when the sun is gone 
But she don't have to walk alone 
Cause once the darkness takes this town 
She ain't the only ghost around 
Waitin' by the public phone 

If it don't ring she heads back home 
Esmeralda, Esmeralda girl, what are you waitin' for 
Esmeralda, Esmeralda, can't hang around this place no more 
Searchlights rip the L.A. sky 
When you look in Esmeralda's eyes 
The people come from miles around 
To see the kings and queens they crowned 
Behind the barricades they stood 
In Esmeralda's Hollywood 

Aw, wait until the sun goes down 
Listen for the lonely sound 
Esmeralda's hanging round 
No one shed a tear that day 
When Esmeralda passed away 

All up and down the strip they say 
It was just like any other day 
The evil struggled with the good 
Down in Esmeralda's Hollywood",Esmeralda's Hollywood,1990
Steve Earle & the Dukes,"He was standin' on the corner 
A hundred dollar bill in his hand 
Said I could feed a lot of these people with this 
But that ain't the business at hand 
Ain't but one reason for a white boy to be 
Over on this side of town 
He gave that money to the man and he 
Bought a little mercy for now 
Have mercy on me 
Have mercy on me 
I'm a sinner Lord can't you see 
Have mercy on me 

Old Joe don't know how it got started 
I guess it was the fire in her eyes 
He loved his wife and children 
And he wasn't into telling all these lies 
But she gave herself so freely 
In that room at the top of the stairs 
He'd go to her in hope he'd find a little mercy there 
 
Tears were made to fall 
Hearts made to break 
Sometimes it feels 
Like they just want to know 
How much you can take 
She was all alone that evening 
What was she thinking about 
Her mind was made up and 
I guess it was the only way out 
There's a pistol in a pawn shop window 
Made of cold, blue steel 
She took it home to find out 
How warm a little mercy could feel 
God knows that mercy ain't free 
Have mercy on me",Have Mercy,1990
Steve Earle & the Dukes,"You can love most of the people 
Most of the time 
Now and again if you're lookin' I'm sure 
You will find 
Someone who's helplessly hoping 
That someday 
They'll finally find the one 
Hopeless romantics keep hoping that 
Someday will come 
Used to be you could be sure that a 
Warrior was true 

Nowadays everyone knows that it's cool to be blue 
Constantly circling close to the flame And then stopping on a dime 
Hopeless romantics will go down in flames every time 
Hopeless romantics drop everything and run 
When they find a broken heart 

Always afraid that they're missing someone 
With time on their hands and a missing part 
So one of these nights when you're 
Sitting at home all alone 

And you've finally admitted you're lonely 
Right down to the bone 
You might as well get on out in it 
'Cause you've got everything to lose 
And hopeless romantics are always 
At home with the blues 

And a broken heart 
Find the missing part 
Hopeless romantics are usually 
Hopelessly true",Hopeless Romantics,1990
Steve Earle & the Dukes,"Oh you who hail from Ontario 
Know the tale of the Donnelly's Oh 
Died at the hands of a mob that night 
Every child and man by the oil torch light 
Jim Donnelly was no angel sure 

But they burned his barn, broke down the door 
Well the children cried while they killed old Jim 
Then they killed his wife, then they turned on them 
No judge, no jury, no hangman, no justice in Ontario 
A hundred years or more have turned 

And you always hear how much we've learned 
Well a man lay dead in a Port Hope bar 
And the blood ran red on a hardwood floor 
And the big men ran through the nearest door 
Only one man knew what had happened for sure 

Well one and all wore the outlaws' brand 
And the big bikes roared through the Great Northland 
When you live on the edge of the law 
You know, justice in Ontario 

Blue smoke still hung in the air 
No one spoke when the cops got there 
Well the local constable made the call 
Send us Corporal Terry Hall 

They all sang a different tune 
When Corporal Hall walked in the room 
With his picture book and a list of names 
One by one the witnesses came 
And they told him what he wanted to know 
Justice in Ontario 

The provincial cops searched far and wide 
And the outlaws ran but they could not hide 
And they brought em in every single one 
Save the man who actually fired the gun 
It was down in London, they were tried 
And the guilty man stood free outside 

When he took the stand to pay his debt 
The judge was blind and the jury deaf

Don't remember where I slept last night 
I just remember halfway through the night 
I woke up stiff with fright 
I dreamed there was no asphalt 
I dreamed there was no gasoline 
Felt like a rat caught in some nowhere town 
I woke up and screamed

I used to shut em down 
I used to take their pinkslips

I blew them all away

As I towed their lives away 

I used to run the cocaine 
I used to run the weed

Is I run on desperation

Don't remember Oklahoma
Been so long since I left home
Seems like I've always been in prison
Like I've always been alone

Didn't mean to hurt nobody
Never thought I'd cross that line
I held up a filling station
Like I'd done a hundred times

The kid done like I told him
He lay face down on the floor
Guess I'll never know what made me
Turn and walk back through that door

The shot rang out like thunder
My ears rang like a bell
No one came runnin'
So I called the cops myself

Took their time to get there
And I guess I could'a run
I knew I should be feeling something
But I never shed tear one

I didn't even make the papers
'Cause I only killed one man
But my trial was over quickly
And then the long hard wait began

Court appointed lawyer
Couldn't look me in the eye
He just stood up and closed his briefcase
When they sentenced me to die

Now my waitin's over
As the final hour drags by
I ain't about to tell you
That I don't deserve to die

But there's twenty-seven men here
Mostly black, brown and poor
Most of em are guilty
Who are you to say for sure?

So when the preacher comes to get me
And they shave off all my hair
Could you take that long walk with me
Knowing hell is waitin' there

Could you pull that switch yourself sir
With a sure and steady hand
Could you still tell youself

I was underneath the weather and all my friends looked a crowd
The swimmin' hole was full of rum, I tried to find out why
All I learned was this my friend you gotta swim before you fly

I got two girls one's in heaven, one's below
One I love with all my heart and one I do not know

Two lonesome dudes on an ugly horse passed by not long ago
They asked me where the action was and I said I did not know
As they disappeared into the brush I heard the driver say
He's a little slow between the ears, he's always been that way

I got two girls one's in heaven, one's below
One I love with all my heart and one I do not know

Now Jolly Jane just lays around and listens with her mouth
She's had about a dozen husbands but the last one just pulled out
Now, who's gonna bring her dinner through the weary years ahead?
All she'll get from me is sympathy, ain't got time to see she's fed

I got two girls one's in heaven, one's below
One I love with all my heart and one I do not know

And now it's cold down on the bayou and they say it's in your mind
But my moccasins are treadin' ice leavin' strange designs
The Cajuns say the last time that this happened they weren't here
All Beaumont's full of penguins and I'm playin' it by ear

You look like you're new to this town
We're a long way away from the beach here
You won't see many gringos around
Well I come from West Colorado
And I've wandered this world far and wide
I've lived for some years in the shadows
And my eyes are unused to this light
If you buy me a strong drink of whiskey
I will tell you the tale of my life
It's long and it's sad but it fits me
And it may bring a tear to your eye

All the men of my family were solidiers
The hard fightin' straight talkin' kind
When my turn came all that was over
But I'd already made up my mind
I was there when we blew though Grenada
And I still have to ask myself why
Then we took down that fool Noriega
That's where I caught the good colonel's eye
Well he asked me if I loved my country
And before I had time to reply
He regaled me with tales of past glories
I believed every one of his lies

So I left my old life behind me
Turned my back on my family and friends
And I did everything that they asked me
And I lost some sleep now and again
And I lived like a thief and assassin
I smuggled their poisons sometimes
Until I asked the wrong question in passin'

And the colonel himself dropped the dime

Red white and blue to the bone when he landed in Kandahar

To serve his liege lord without recompense 
Perchance to fall and perish namelessly

I exact too terrible a tribute

And decrepit now and my time grows short 
There are no honorable frays to join 

Only mean death dealt out in dibs and dabs 
Or horror unleashed from across oceans 
Assail me not with noble policy 
For I care not at all for platitude 
And surrender such tedious detail 
To greater minds than mine and nimbler tongues 
Singular in their purpose and resolve 
And presuming to speak for everyman 

Oh, for another time, a distant field 
And there a mortal warrior's lonely grave 
But duty charges me remain until 
The end the last battle of the last war 
Until that morrow render unto me

Across the mountains far, but when it came to rest
They scarce believed their eyes, they'd come so many miles

Or guide a weary world into the light of day
And nothing but a child could help erase these miles

Steve Earle & the Dukes,"On Mardi Gras day the Tennessee kid
Awoke in a puddle
Of his own worst fears
Haunted by the ghost
Of vague remembrance
No corporeal beast he could name
So the kid invoked Lucifer himself
With oaths most grievously discourteous
And charged him submit
Forthwith to atone
At the crossroads
Celebrated in song
Come on

Up jumped the devil
In the middle of the thoroughfare
“Who dares to utter my most secret name?”
He roared
But the kid yielded not so much as an inch
To uncertainty
Steadfast he rejoined the enemy in kind
“Old patch then, Satan, Mephistopheles,
Beelzebub
By any other name you ain’t nothin’
Like a rose”
Then he girded his loins for the
Ensuing onslaught
But the devil only shrugged and the kid
Shuddered when he hissed he said

Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
The balance comes due someday

Wait just one goddamn minute cried the kid
From the cumberland
You never mention nothin’
'Bout no kinda note
Just said, sign here, it’s just a soul
You’ll never miss it
I ain’t set foot in a church since I was just
A little ol’ thang
Reckoned I was headed straight to hell
By the highway
No matter how long and how hard
That I prayed
So I might as well learn how to make
This guitar talk
Somebody said ol’ Bob Johnson
Came down this way
And Devil say

Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
When the balance comes due someday

And the monster raised himself up
To the fullness of his stature
Black wings eclipsing a sanguine
Mississippi moon
Behold behemoth the trampler
Of infidels,
He who sweeps away nations
With a flick of his tail
Theopolis, Agrrippa, Faustus, Paganini
Lurid and long is the tale of my prey
Question not the ironclad bond
Of my surety
Set down here in blood
In your very own hand

And the Tennessee kid cast an eye
On the list where his mark
Was indeed clearly inscribed
And he fell to his knees
But it was too late to pray
And with his very last breath he did say

Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
The balance comes due someday",The Tennessee Kid,2015

I went away just when you needed me so.
Filled with regret I come back beggin' you,
Forgive, forget. Where's the love we once knew?
Open up your eyes, then you'll realize here I stand
With my everlasting love.
Need you by my side, girl you'll be my bride.
You'll never be denied everlasting love.
From the very start, open up your heart,
Be a lasting part of everlasting love.
Real love will last forever.
 
Ooh, ooh.
Where life's river flows, no one really knows
'til someone's there to show the way to lasting love.
Like the sun that shines, endlessly it shine,
You always will be mine. It's everlasting love.
When other loves are gone, ours will still be strong,
We have our very own everlasting love.
Real love will last forever.
You give me, you give me, you give me everlasting love
 
Ooh.
Open up your eyes, then you'll realize here I stand
With my everlasting love.
Need you by my side, girl you'll be my bride.

Steve Ellis,"When I had you
I treated you bad
Wrong my dear
But since, since you went away
Don't you know I sit around
With my head hanging down
And I wonder who's loving you

Oooh, my first mistake was
I wanted too much time
I had to have him morning, noon, and night
If I would of known then
The things that I know now
I might not have lost the time I complain about

Don't waste your time
Fighting blind minded thoughts of dispair
Hold on to your love
You gotta hold on
Hold on to your love
Ooh, ooh, baby hold on
Hold on to your love
You gotta hold on
Hold on to your love

The art of playing games now
Is not the hearts you break
It's bound to good love you make
When it's heart's on fire
Give him love evryday
Remember he needs space
Be patient and he'll give his heart to you

Don't waste your time
Fighting blind minded thoughts of dispair
Hold on to your love
You gotta hold on
Hold on to your love
Ooh, ooh, baby hold on
Hold on to your love
You gotta hold on
Hold on to your love

Trust and honesty too
Must be the golden rule
You'll feel the strength of passion in your soul
Burn so deeply within
Ooh, the magic that you share
So sacrifice and show how much you care

Don't waste your time
Fighting blind minded thoughts of dispair
Hold on to your love
You gotta hold on
Hold on to your love
Ooh, ooh, baby hold on
Hold on to your love
You gotta hold on
Hold on to your love

Keep the ties
Hang on tight
And don't let go
No, no, no, no
If you need him
Just keep on
Just keep on hanging on
Little trust, honesty, golden rules
Feel the strength of passion in your soul
It's burning so deep
Have faith
Just keep the fire burning at home

He'll come home to you
He'll be there for you
He'll want to have you",Hold On [*],1978

Je rêvais le bonheur, ardent mirage;
Tes yeux étaient plus doux, ta voix pure et sonore
Tu rayonnais comme un ciel éclairé par l'aurore;
Tu m'appelais, et je quittais la terre
Pour m'enfuir avec toi vers la lumière;
Les cieux pour nous entr'ouvraient leurs nues;
Splendeurs inconnues, lueurs divines entrevues...
Hélas, hélas, triste réveil des songes !
Je t'apelle, ô nuit, rends-moi tes mensonges;
Reviens, reviens radieuse
Reviens, ô nuit mystérieuse

Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

On the day that you were born
And the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true

So they sprinkled moon dust
In your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue
That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

On the day that you were born
And the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true

So they sprinkled moon dust
In your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue
That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you",(They Long to Be) Close to You,1986
Steve Feldman,"You are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always be around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart 
I feel like this is the beginning

Though I've loved you for a million years
And if I thought our love was ending
I'd find myself drowning in my own tears 

You are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always stay around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart 

You must have known that I was lonely
Because you came to my rescue
And I know that this must be heaven
How could so much love be inside of you? 

You are the sunshine of my life, yeah

Steve Ferrera,"Old black magic has me in its spell
Old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine
Same old tingle that I feel inside
Then the elevator starts it ride

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for 
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you are the lover I have waited for
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love",That Old Black Magic,2000
Steve Ferrera,"My name is Calypso
And I have lived alone
I live on an island 
And I waken to the dawn
A long time ago
I watched him struggle with the sea
I knew that he was drowning
And I brought him into me
Now today
Come morning light
He sails away
After one last night
I let him go.

My name is Calypso
My garden overflows
Thick and wild and hidden
Is the sweetness there that grows
My hair it blows long
As I sing into the wind
My name is Calypso
And I have lived alone
I live on an island
I tell of nights
Where I could taste the salt on his skin

Salt of the waves
And of tears
And though he,pulled away
I kept him here for years
I let him go

My name is Calypso
I have let him go
In the dawn he sails away
To be gone forever more
And the waves will take him in again
But he'll know their ways now
I will stand upon the shore
With a clean heart

And my song in the wind
The sand will sting my feet
And the sky will burn
It's a lonely time ahead
I do not ask him to return
I let him go
I let him go",Calypso,2002
Steve Ferrone,"I had a dream last night, Lord it wasn't me
I dreamed the only woman I ever loved
People, turned her back on me
Let me tell you little more about the dream

I dream of working a graveyard shift
For the long nights a week
When I left home my baby's in bed
My baby, she was fast asleep

When I'm done sick of my job
And I had to go home
And when I got there my bed was empty
My baby she was gone

It couldn't let this worry
It all happened in my sleep
All the things that has been so bad
And I don't want you from seven to seven next weekend

And that's why, that's why, that's why I had a dream
Lord, that's worrying me
She's the only woman I ever loved, people
She's turned her back on me

Baby, don't you know I had a dream last night
Don't you know that worries me
You know I had a dream last night
I had a dream, you were worrying me

Just pick the way I was going people, yeah

Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin
Then you'll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh
