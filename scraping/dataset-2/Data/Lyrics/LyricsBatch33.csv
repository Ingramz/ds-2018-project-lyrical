1 - I wear my sunglasses at night
     So I can, so I can
     Keep track of visions in my eyes

Repeat 1

Yo pretty feisty ain't she, eighteen she can't be
Heard he was some broad getting over then that ain't me
Cause I'm that broad that their broads tell more broads about
And on their mouths is the mouths my name won't stay out
Big benjamining in the slimming
And see me, I keeps in it
Chrome spinning window tinted
I can see me all up in it
It's only summer I have him moving out before fall
How the misses gon' let the mistress steal dough from y'all?
Have him taking me to the places he don't go with y'all
Be the one he sneak and call when he out with y'all
Come on y'all gotta admit it's kind of good to be young
Got his whip, got him whipped, and she don't know what's going on
Yeah I ran that bank account, spent everything in it
Took the credit cards, pushed the Visa to the limit
She be so nieve too the things you believe boo
If I was you I'd be rocking these sunglasses too, come on

Repeat 1

I see this industry gon' love me or hate me
But y'all aren't fans, ain't gonna make me or break me
It takes you a year to get a hit I can't relate see
Cause what you doing in minutes, seconds it takes me
Ain't got no choice so take your verbal spanking like a troop
We're all actors and I'm whooping your whole cast and crew
I make this vow if it's the last thing a sister do
To rip this mic until I'm out of breath or black or blue
This is going out to all your rappers who be acting new
Give me my props or I'mma take them like a rapist do
And why you females hatin' me cause I ain't hatin' you?
I'll take your man for a second but I'll give him back to you
Ain't trying to keep him every state have a him and you
If you were in these sneaker shoes you would do it too
So understand y'all just got picked out of the chosen few
But he gon' always gonna think of me when he holding you
What'cha want to do? Come on

Repeat 1

I make 'em come up out the cuffs quick to touch this Miss Luscious
Make you see how much you miss from the broad you fuss with
Ask a friend if you don't know-oh, vanilla slash cocoa
I be dipping your five to the uh-oh
Messing with that Sebring chick, touch knee deep quick
And if need be switched cause the team is getting thick
I keeps all I leave with ain't nothing strategic
Broads see chick want to be chick
Without cause, sea sick
So if you really just going there buying a Benz
Moving that kind of weight, getting them kind of ends
Count me in, you really trying to ball and spin
In front all you men, I rock these shades for all you men

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Noontime and So So Def
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh
See it don't stop
Y'all don't stop, yo

[Cha Cha](JD)
Yo I'm killing the flow, I'm promo crossing the globe
Got these rap chicks scared to breathe the cough on their toe
Crossing their toes damn near fart through their nose
Buckin' that whoa, I hope they put her project on hold
Few seconds ago, seems like I had your blessings to flow
Now I'm next and you're nervous and hexing me mo'
You make the call I can school you on becoming a broad
It ain't hard to find me y'all I'll show you how mommy ball
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[JD]
All my niggas keep getting that paper
Stand your ground let nobody take you
Look them bitches right dead in the face
And say what'cha want to do?
[Cha Cha]
All my down broads keep taking that paper
Stand your ground let nobody break you
Look them niggas right dead in the face
And say what y'all wanna do, holla

[Cha Cha]
Face to face with you, face the case with you
Visit rooms every time the state say switch you
To state the truth, probably a thing I wouldn't do
Except blaze with you and get your face tattooed
Mistake you fool I wish I would chase that dude
Wait for dude and let alone lace that dude
See too many checks get to many banks
You're on my neck, you're just a guess
I'm too in effect, I'm doing my best
Two on my right, two on my left
Who under stress?
You got me in the Lex doing the preps
See these checks is peever
Cha spitting the fever
Don't smoke so imagine if I was hitting the refer
See mamacita, miss senorita
Spend your visa till you give your keys up
Have you higher than chocha
And niggas that know Cha know she's livin' la vida loca

Stand your ground let nobody take you

And say what y'all wanna do, holla

[Cha Cha]
So hectic, dealing with broads least expected
Accepted, I'mma problem too late for correction
Exceptions, none given, you just need direction
Either exit or take a few keen suggestions
This year I hope you know I'mma keep me dough
Cha Cha and Chi Chi, yo the remix ho
Seasoned flow, trying to get this cheese to marvelous
So umph get off me, uh get off me
Its small change is what these broads should be costing me
They all small time chicks that I'm straining to see
Angry with me, don't get mad your man came up to me
It's ain't my fault he holler at everybody famous he see
Blame it on me, because I want the goodies with gems, no hoodies
And ten Timbs, and grain wood in the Benz
Too many friends, niggas be assuming we friends
If I fool with you daddy, I be dead before I do it again

Honey since last fall in December
I've been getting that
And setting that to the side
If I pinch that
It's only cause your royalty and pug checks ain't in yet
Why you wait so late to get pissed?
I just about done spent this

You the man since you low-keyed her
You wish you was still my man instead of my ex
Cause I be living in your land instead of his Lex

Yellow and green bottles, you know what that mean? y'allin'
Know you got to drop if you cop a skwat
This shit goes no further then the parking lot
Burns a tab (???????) back to your pad
Be lucky if a broad drop you mad to the lab
After that we stab, look backwards and laugh
take a bottle in the air

[Verse two: Cha Cha]
You might ketch me in Bahamas, when I'm loungin' wit him
Tell him bring the Condoms wit him, like he gon hit 'em
Know I always liein' a little, bullshit him
Tell his ass lye on the pillow, let him feel 'em
Pop dom wit him, and roll up (?) wit him
Create bonds wit him, but I don't wined up wit him
I just stack my cake, hair back to the states
Know it's two case, like ""Oh yea, by the way...""

Thanks for the trip, I just got payed
That's what you get, tryin' a hotel

I tax for the stress when it's (?) to invest
Wynnin', we kissin' (?)
Why we can't undress?
That's when I lie

So I dig at your wallets

Du mal à vivre dans le commun des autres, du mal à fuir les nôtres,
Blessés on se referme sur soi même,
Du mal à faire confiance aux autres alors on finit souvent blasés,
On aime se cacher derrière le regard des nôtres,
Confondre mensonge et vérité devient malaise désespéré,
Pour les nôtres, on espère un futur clean sans tâches,

Chad Brock,"What the heck was I thinking
Comin' and livin' in this concrete canyon
Tryin' to swim upstream in a river of vacant-eyed people
Where are they all going so fast
And what in the world could be so important

Man, I miss Mama
Wonder what she's doing
Probably looking out the kitchen window
At that green grass and that clear sky

Daddy's probably sneakin' up behind her
Puttin' his arms around her waist
Restin' that head on her shoulder
Tellin' her how much he loves her
That's what I oughta be doing with you, right now

I find it hard to breathe without you next to me
Gonna leave this phone hangin', I'm gone
Before the sun goes down, gonna ditch this town

Oh yeah, I know what I was thinking, I wasn't
I came this close to making the biggest mistake of my life
Is that a train I hear in the background
You're on the porch aren't you
Got your head resting on that pillow, on the swing
Your bare feet propped up on those chain links
Your toenails painted all cotton candy pink, oh man
Let's see, smog or the smell of summer in your hair
I'm outta here

[Chorus: ]

Baby, I can't tell you how good it felt
Rollin' back into this little map dot
Seeing those sugar maples shading Main Street
And I never noticed it before, but I smiled when I saw
Those post-game celebration beer bottle dents
In that deer crossing sign
Ya know, a few of those were ours
Kiss me, no you kiss me

Feels so good to breathe
With you here next to me
In your arms it feels like home
Watch the sun go down

That's how we got this whole thing started
She called and said that i had mail waiting there for me
I told her that i'd come and get it
How could i know in just a minute
That i'd be standing face to face with my own destiny

Ohhhh how we sat there talking just like we were old friends
Ohhhh then i asked her can i see you again

She said yes! and i said wow!
She said when and i said how about right now
Love can't wait then i asked if she believed in fate
And she said yes

The days flew by just like a fast train
And nothing else has been on my brain
Except the thought of how she makes me the man i want to be
She's the one i long for a million reasons
Loving her is just like breathing
It's easy and it's obvious she was made for me

Ohhh then it happened one night looking in her eyes
Ohhh when i popped the question much to my sur-prize

She said yes! and i said wow!
She said when and i said how about right now

Please, don't move too fast, I scared of why'all niggas and my nerves is bad!""
So sad, but I won't think twice

We rich, we get the best judicial advice
Threaten my life with them words that they ut-ter-in'
Adrenaline pump, my heart start to flut-ter-in'
Continuous dump, that tech gets to stut-ter-in'

Left in the slump, mother and sister cud-dle-in'
And for what, 'cause you ego-trippin'
If that thing jam, it's divine intervention
Click!

[Chorus: x 2]
Don't let 'cha ego trick yo ass
'Cause this motherfuckin' tech will get yo ass

[Pharrell]
""Yes, the semi-automatic tech is know to jam...""
But if it don't, that's yo ass my man

[Pusha T]
Even if it's talk cheap (Say what...)
You know I can't sleep on his word
Had to show him that I heard (Let's go...)
All that duct-tape-tie-up talk put in reverse

Now it's him who's in a bind on the account of his words (Yeah, you know it...)
Yeah, they talk 'bout this and that (That...)
Got it fucked up, like I'm all 'bout rap (Rap...)
Word is I'm loaded, they want a piece of that

I respond with four words, ""Rat-tat-tat-tat"" (In yo ass...)
Now, rap about that
I carry a human heat box, to make ya heartbeat stop (Stop...)
Some say Pusha's the coldest

Money is my morals, other than that, I'm soulless
Refuse to wake up zeroless and 0-less
Carry that shit that blow your arm out your shoulders (Bla-oww...)
Techs don't come with holsters, I'm a menace boy (Don't forget, motherfucker)

Don't let 'cha ego trick yo ass

Chad Hugo,"Yo, I go by the name
(I'm yo' Pusha) Of Pharrell from the Neptunes
And I just wanna let y'all know (I'm yo' Pusha)
The world is about to feel
Something (I'm yo' Pusha)
That they've never felt before, c'mon

From ghetto to ghetto, to backyard to yard
I sell it whip on whip, it's off the hard
I'm the neighborhood Pusha
Call me sub woofer, 'cause I pump bass like that, Jack
On or off the track, I'm heavy 'cause
Ball 'til you fall 'cause you could duck to the fetti govs
Sorry my love, what I'm seeing through these eyes
Benz convoys with the wagon on the side
Only big boys keep deuces on the ride
Gucci Chuck Taylor with the dragon on the side
Man, I make a buck, why scram?
I'm trying to show y'all who the fuck I am
The jewels is flirting me, damned if I'm hurting
Legend in two games like I'm Pee Wee Kirkland
Platinum on the block with consistent hits
While Pharrell keep talking this music shit

Grindin'! (Ah)
Grindin'! (Ah)
Grindin'! (Ah)
Grindin'! (Ah)
Grindin'! (Ah)

Patty cake, patty cake, I'm the baker's man
I bake them cakes as fast as I can
And you can tell by how my bread stack up
And disguised in this rap so the Feds back up
Watch it, like my whip, like my chick, topless
Doing a buck-six with me in the cockpit
Grindin' cousin, I got hoes for a dozen
Even Eleven-5, if I see ya keep it comin'
And my weight, that's just as heavy as my name
So much dough, I can't swear I won't change
Excuse me if my wealth got me full of myself
Cocky, something that I just can't help
'Specially when them 20's is spinning like windmills
And the ice 32 below minus the wind chill
Filthy, the word that best defines me
I'm just grinding man, y'all never mind me

Niggas better stay in line, when (Whooof)
When you see a nigga like me shinin' (Grinding!)

My grind's 'bout family, never been about fame
From days I wasn't able there was always 'caine
Four and a half will get you in the game
Anything less is just a goddamn shame
Guess the weight, my watch got blue chips in the face
Glock with two tips, whoever gets in the way
Not to mention the hideaway that rests by the lake
Consider my raw demeanor the icing on the cake, I'm Grinding

I move 'caine like a cripple
Balance weight through the hood
Kids call me Mr. Sniffles, other hand on my nickel
Plated whistle, one eye closed I'll hit you
As if I was Slick Rick my aim is still an issue
Lose your soul in whichever palm I'm holdin'
One'll leave you frozen, the other, noddin' and dozin', I'm grindin' Jack

Chad Hugo,"Playas we ain't the same, I'm into 'caine and guns
Show par with the fishes, make the face lift numb
Out in Panama in that amazing sun, I'm amazing, son
You n****s wonder where my grace is from
I speak with corrupted tongue
Recognized the underworld since I was young
Back in '84 when I saw Crocket & Tubbs as the law
These eyes got big when they televised that raw
My mama should've seen it comin'
Me runnin' up and down the stairs too quick
Hummin' Miami Vice theme music
Called the 'roin made me colder
I see the villains' impact, now that I'm older
Ignorant fool, views ignorant, too
Got a lot of money, keep militant tools
Wasn't present the session they handed out the rules
So I grab a tape and related to life's cruels
The meaning?
Pusha T's more than the semen
Not just a rap name, more so like a damn shame
Nothing's changed, just the crimes is less heinous
The three of us know, yet the shooter remains nameless
And I don't even watch my back
I was raw before rap, and I ain't lost my past
S*** could get hairy, I could lose my-self in a flash
N****s'll think I'm Jim Carrey how I off that ""Mask""

I even went by the book at first
Until I realized 9 to 5 wouldn't quench my thirst, so I
Start my mission, leave my residence
Mama knew that I child like me had better sense
But something had to give, that's real I had to live
I chefed that soft white and pumped from her crib
Scouts honor started with my grandmama
Who distributed yay she had flown in from the Bahamas
Partner, please, I grinds, I hustle with ease
Can damn near eyeball any weight in my sleep
I don't entertain hate surrounding the street
If I was you, I'd be trynna get down with me
But no, see these n****s know too much
Meanwhile I rock jewels that look like my diamonds blush
Cats act as if rap fell in my lap
I've suffered heartbreak many times back to back
And still feel belittled sittin' here spittin' riddles
Amongst clown a** rappers who tend to give me the giggles
Let 'em take it however they wanna take it
I'm the reason your favorite MC's no longer your favorite
Hey, I one of the greats, I can't lie
I mean great to the point I'm concerned I might die
Make no mistake, Malice is who you tune to
It's all in the name, trust, I will wound you",Intro,2002

So baby take my hand and away we go

Had to make you mine when I seen you from the get-go
You know that I’m in trouble if I ever lose ya
So I'm out here cuffin' like a state trooper
And we can do whatever you like it don’t bother me
Long as you on my arm like an IV

Only secret's victorian, never change up your story
I never need to record my feelings, I vindicate

Somehow you done did it, you came before the squad
You vote for me, I vote for you too though
I choose to curb the ones that ain't you though

And blood spilling

If I said I didn't like it then you'd know I'd lied

Every time I try to talk to you
I get tongue-tied
Turns out that everything I say to you
Comes out wrong and never comes out right

So I'll say 'why don't you and I get together and take on the world and be together forever
Heads we will and tails we'll try again
So I say why don't you and I hold each other and fly to the moon and straight on to heaven
Cause without you they're never going to let me in

Well, they called him Super Skier
As he sat around the sundeck,
For he swore that he would never take a spill.
When they finally brought him down
They had to use three toboggans
To carry all the pieces down the hill.
CHORUS:
He was comin' down that slope
Doin' ninety miles an hour
When he caught an edge of his ski.
Well, his clothes, they were fast,
But the slopes, they were faster.
That's the last of Super Skier we shall see.
Well, he hollered, ""What the hell!""
As he lined them parallel:
He figured there was nothing more to learn.
(Oh, no...)
And as he started on his way,
He shouted, ""Ondelay!"",
Assuming that he'd never have to turn.
Well, he was slippin' down that slope
Doin' ninety miles an hour
When a mogul flipped him in the air.
His jumping form was fine
Until he ran into that pine,
And two one-legged skiers left from there.
(repeat CHORUS)
When he left that tree at last,
He was moving twice as fast.
Both halves were skimming moguls like a feather.
He said, ""If I must be
A split personality,
How can I ever keep my knees together?""
One ski was headed north,
And the other headed west,
'Cause both of them, you see, were running freer.
And folks up on Little Nell
Looked up, scared as hell,
Said, ""It's a bird."" ""No, it's a plane."" ""It's Super Skier!""
(No, uh, it's a bird.)
(repeat CHORUS)
Now the moral of my story
(Though my story's kinda gory):
For all you sundeck Charlies, there's still hope.
You buy the fastest clothes you can,
Then talk skiing like a man,
But don't let people catch you on the slope!
(repeat CHORUS)
And let's get Charlie off the M. T. A.

Chad Mitchell,"I Can't Help But Wonder Where I'm Bound
Chad Mitchell Trio


It's a long and a dusty road.
It's a hard and a heavy load
And the folks we meet ain't always kind.

Some are bad and some are good.
Some have done the best they could.
Some have tried to ease our troubling mind.

Chorus:
And I can't help but wonder where I'm bound, where I'm bound.
Can't help but wonder where I'm bound.

I have traveled across this land
Just a-doing the best I can.
Tryin' to find what I was meant to do.

And the faces that I see
Are as worried as can be.
Looks like they've been wonderin', too.

Chorus

I had a buddy, way back home,
But he started out to roam
And I hear he's out by Monterey,

And sometimes, when I've had a few,
His voice comes singin' through
And I'm a-goin' out to see him some old day.

Chorus

If you see us passin' by
And you sit and you wonder why
And you wish that you were a rambler, too.

Nail your shoes to the kitchen floor,
Lace 'em up, bar the door
And thank the stars for the roof that's over you.

Chorus

And I can't help but wonder where I'm bound, where I'm bound,
Can't help but wonder where I'm bound.

And the wind will whisper your name to me

Leaves will bow down when you walk by
And morning bells will chime
 
I'll be there when you're feeling down
To kiss away the fears if you cry
I'll share with you all the happiness I've found
A reflection of the love in your eyes
 
And I'll sing you the songs of the rainbow
A whisper of the joy that is mine
And leaves will bow down when you walk by

Think I'll go out to Alberta
Weather's good there in the fall

Got some friends I can go to working for
Still I wish you change your mind
If I asked you one more time
But we've been through that a hundred times or more

If I get there before the snow flies
And if things are going good 
You could meet me if I send you down the fare

Oh, we're meetin' at the courthouse at eight o'clock tonight
You just walk in the door and take the first turn to the right
Be careful when you get there, we hate to be bereft
But we're taking down the names of everybody turning left
Oh, we're the John Birch Society, the John Birch Society
Here to save our country from a communistic plot
Join the John Birch Society, help us fill the ranks
To get this movement started we need lots of tools and cranks
Now there's no one that we're certain the Kremlin doesn't touch
We think that Westbrook Pegler doth protest a bit too much
We only hail the hero from whom we got our name
We're not sure what he did but he's our hero just the same
Oh, we're the John Birch Society, the John Birch Society
Socialism is the ism dismalest of all
Join the John Birch Society, there's so much to do
Have you heard they're serving vodka at the WCTU?
Well you've heard about the agents that we've already named
Well MPA has agents that are flauntedly unashamed
We're after Rosie Clooney, we've gotten Pinkie Lee
And the day we get Red Skelton won't that be a victory
Oh we're the John Birch Society, the John Birch Society
Norman Vincent Peale may think he's kidding us along
But the John Birch Society knows he spilled the beans
He keeps on preaching brotherhood, but we know what he means
We'll teach you how to spot 'em in the cities or the sticks
For even Jasper Junction is just full of Bolsheviks
The CIA's subversive and so's the FCC
There's no one left but thee and we, and we're not sure of thee
Oh, we're the John Birch Society, the John Birch Society
Here to save our country from a communistic plot
Join the John Birch Society holding off the Reds
We'll use our hand and hearts and if we must we'll use our heads
Do you want Justice Warren for your Commissar?
Do you want Mrs. Krushchev in there with the DAR?
You cannot trust your neighbor or even next of kin
If mommie is a commie then you gotta turn her in
Oh, we're the John Birch Society, the John Birch Society
Fighting for the right to fight the right fight for the Right
Join the John Birch Society as we're marching on
And we'll all be glad to see you when we're meeting in the John

Chad Mitchell,"I'm just a typical American boy
From a typical American town
I believe in God and Senator Dodd
And an keepin' old Castro down

And when it came my time to serve
I knew better dead than red
But when I got to my old draft board
Buddy, this is what I said

Sarge, I'm only eighteen, I got a ruptured spleen
And I always carry a purse
I got eyes like a bat, and my feet are flat
My asthma's getting worse

Consider my career, my sweetheart dear
My poor old invalid aunt
Besides, I ain't no fool, and I'm goin' to school
And I'm workin' in a defense plant

I've got a dislocated disc and a racked up back
I'm allergic to flowers and bugs
And when the bombshell hits, I get epileptic fits
And I'm addicted to a thousand drugs

I got the weakness woes, I can't touch my toes
I can hardly reach my knees
And if the enemy ever came close to me
Well, I'd probably start to sneeze

Sarge, I'm only eighteen, I got a ruptured spleen
And I always carry a purse
I got eyes like a bat, and my feet are flat
My asthma's getting worse

Consider my career, my sweetheart dear
My poor old invalid aunt
Besides, I ain't no fool, I'm a goin' to school
And I'm workin' in a defense plant

I hate Chou En Lai, and I hope he dies
But I think you gotta see
That if someone's gotta go over there
That someone isn't me

So, have a ball, Sarge, watch 'em fall
Yeah, kill me a thousand or so
And if you ever get a war without any gore
Well, I'll be the first to go

Sarge, I'm only eighteen, I got a ruptured spleen
And I always carry a purse
I got eyes like a bat, and my feet are flat
My asthma's getting worse

Consider my career, my sweetheart dear
I got to water my rubber tree plant
Besides, I ain't no fool, I'm a goin' to school
And I'm workin' in a defense plant

Sarge, I'm only eighteen, I got a ruptured spleen
And I always carry a purse
I got eyes like a bat, and my feet are flat

Funeral Directors of America, I am very deeply honored standing here;
Receiving this token of your esteem, ""The Funeral Director of the
Year.""
Now I've been asked by all the delegates--and members of the board,
To tell you of the funeral that won me this award.
It was handled with taste and dignity, that much I can say for it;
And I'm sure it will take the family twenty years to pay for it!

[Chorus:]
It was a helluva fun'ral, It was a helluva fun'ral
The finest fun'ral ever booked:
I had some high school juniors who passed around petunial
And lilies everywhere you looked.
It was a helluva fun'ral, I say one helluva fun'ral
Oh, how I wish that you were there;
I had ten drum majorettes doubling on the castanets
It really was a lively affair
It really was a lively affair.
It was a helluva fun'ral, It was a helluva fun'ral
The national guard showed up for me;
And during the oration, they went into formation
And formed the letters R. I. P.
It was a helluva fun'ral, I say one helluva fun'ral
I gave it all my loving care;
The band was on its toes playing ""Mexicali Rose"",
It really was a lively affair.
It really was a lively affair.
A tisket a tasket, Tell us about the casket

[Spoken:]
Well, I'll tell you 'bout the casket, my good friends
It would-a made your poor eyes pop
It was sterling silver all around and a real formica top.
(Formica top, it had a formica top).
Well, I'll tell you 'bout the widow, my good friends,
The widow was in navy blue
With a gown designed by Balenciaga, I supplied that too.
(He sold the widow widow's weeds too).
I held the first funereal raffle, though I don't much like to boast
And I gave away a Chevrolet to the person who cried the most.
(He gave away a brand new Chevrolet). I won it myself!
There were eighteen jugglers by the grave to demonstrate their art
And when they were done, I fired a gun to let the hoot-e-nanny start.
(He fired a gun and the hoot-e-nanny begun).
I was serving beer and prtzels, 'til the hot pastrami came;
And I sold some souvenir hankies with the dear departed's name.
(He was sellin' hankies with the dear departed's name).
As a fitting finale we had the Rockettes from New Your's Music Hall;
As you can see, my very good friends
All in all, all in all:
[Sung:]
It was a helluva fun'ral, I say one helluva fun'ral

Can't find a woman who's nice and pretty
They all look like page in a magazine
Legs are long and they eat like a sparrow
Figures stick to the straight and narrow
Top and the bottom are same as in between

Show me a pretty little number
When she walks it rolls like thunder
Eyes as deep and dark as the deep blue sea
Round right here and round right there
Pretty red lips and her very own hair
Wrap her up, she's the natural girl for me

Way down in a coffeehouse palace
Found a little lady and her name was Alice
She had friends and her friends had her it seems
Face was dirty and her sweater was baggy
Pants were tight and her hair was shaggy
I've seen her kind on college football teams

Show me a pretty little number
When she walks it rolls like thunder
Eyes as deep and dark as the deep blue sea
Round right here and round right there
Pretty red lips and her very own hair
Wrap her up, she's the natural girl for me

Well, way up at a penthouse pretty
Thirteen miles up above the city
I met a little lady from a wealthy family
Now she could cuss like a real longshoreman
She was making eyes at the doorman
She made a most unusual offer to me

Eyes as deep and dark as the deep blue sea
Round right here and round right there
Pretty red lips and her very own hair
Wrap her up, she's the natural girl for me

Way up at a Broadway party
I met a lady, she was very arty
She took me home to see her studio
She took out her paints and she whispered to me
She said that she wanted to 'do' me
Some of that paint will never come off, I know

Show me a pretty little number
When she walks it rolls like thunder
Eyes as deep and dark as the deep blue sea
Round right here and round right there
Pretty red lips and her very own hair
Wrap her up, she's the natural girl for me

Days and nights are one or so it seems
Why then do you say you've got to leave me
When you can answer all my prayers and dreams?

Stay with me, stay with me

'Tis of the noble Stewball, a gallant racing pony
'Tis also of his rider, who brought ol' Stewball over
He's the diamond of the land and he rolls around in clover

Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win, oh, you'll win
Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win

Oh, the horses they were all brought out with saddle, whip and bridle
The gentlemen did shout when they saw the gallant riders
And some did shout, ""Hooray"" and the air was filled with curses
On the mare, Griselda, the sportsmen lay their purses

Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win, oh, you'll win
Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win

Oh, the trumpet it did sound, and they shot off like an arrow
Ol' Stewball scarcely touched the ground, and the goin' it was narrow

?Oh the gray will win the day, and Stewball, he can foller?

Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win, oh, you'll win
Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win

In the middle of the track, up spoke the noble rider
?I fear we must fall back, that gray is runnin' like a tiger?
Up spoke the noble horse, ""Ride on, ride on my master
We're only half way round the course, and now we'll see who's faster?

Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win, oh, you'll win
Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win

And as they did discourse, ol' Stewball flew like lightnin'
He dashed around the course, and the gray mare she was taken
Ride on, ride on, my noble horse for a good two hundred guineas
Your saddle, it shall be of gold when we pick up our winnings

Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win, oh, you'll win
Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win

Well, past the winning post, bold Stewball went so handy
And both the horse and rider called for sherry, wine and brandy
They drank to that gray mare, the gallant Miss Griselda
And to all who lost their money on the sporting plains of Kildare

Springtime is sad without someone to love
Yes springtime is sad and it troubles my mind

Then it is to remember and always be said
But still I keep wondering each now and then

The green leaves of Summer are callin' me home.
'Twas so good to be young then, in a season of plenty,
When the catfish were jumpin' as high as the sky.

A time just for plantin', a time just for ploughin'.
A time to be courtin' a girl of your own.
'Twas so good to be young then, to be close to the earth,
And to stand by your wife at the moment of birth.

And the owl in the pine tree a-winkin' his eye.

Seven seas that run high

And I'm bound for moving on
I look for you if I'm ever back this way
Think I'll go out to Alberta
Weather's good there in the fall

Got some friends I can go to working for
Still I wish you change your mind
If I asked you one more time
But we've been through that a hundred times or more

If I get there before the snow flies
And if things are going good 
You could meet me if I send you down the fare
But by then it would be winter

Ain't too much for you to do
And those winds sure can blow cold way out there",Four Strong Winds,1996
Chad Mitchell Trio,"I'm just a typical American boy
From a typical American town
I believe in God and Senator Dodd
And an keepin' old Castro down

And when it came my time to serve
I knew better dead than red
But when I got to my old draft board
Buddy, this is what I said

Sarge, I'm only eighteen, I got a ruptured spleen
And I always carry a purse
I got eyes like a bat, and my feet are flat
My asthma's getting worse

Consider my career, my sweetheart dear
My poor old invalid aunt
Besides, I ain't no fool, and I'm goin' to school
And I'm workin' in a defense plant

I've got a dislocated disc and a racked up back
I'm allergic to flowers and bugs
And when the bombshell hits, I get epileptic fits
And I'm addicted to a thousand drugs

I got the weakness woes, I can't touch my toes
I can hardly reach my knees
And if the enemy ever came close to me
Well, I'd probably start to sneeze

Sarge, I'm only eighteen, I got a ruptured spleen
And I always carry a purse
I got eyes like a bat, and my feet are flat
My asthma's getting worse

Consider my career, my sweetheart dear
My poor old invalid aunt
Besides, I ain't no fool, I'm a goin' to school
And I'm workin' in a defense plant

I hate Chou En Lai, and I hope he dies
But I think you gotta see
That if someone's gotta go over there
That someone isn't me

So, have a ball, Sarge, watch 'em fall
Yeah, kill me a thousand or so
And if you ever get a war without any gore
Well, I'll be the first to go

Sarge, I'm only eighteen, I got a ruptured spleen
And I always carry a purse
I got eyes like a bat, and my feet are flat
My asthma's getting worse

Consider my career, my sweetheart dear
I got to water my rubber tree plant
Besides, I ain't no fool, I'm a goin' to school
And I'm workin' in a defense plant

Sarge, I'm only eighteen, I got a ruptured spleen
And I always carry a purse
I got eyes like a bat, and my feet are flat

Chad Mitchell Trio,"When I was just a wee little lad
Full of health and joy
My father homeward came one night
And gave to me a toy

A wonder to behold it was
With many colors bright
And the moment I laid eyes on it
It became my hearts delight

It went 'Zip' when it moved
'Bop' when it stopped
'Whirr' when it stood still
I never knew just what it was
And I guess I never will

The first time that I picked it up
I had a big surprise
For right on its bottom were two big button
That looked like big green eyes

I first pushed one and then the other
Then I twisted its lid
And when I set it down again
Here is what it did

It went 'Zip' when it moved
'Bop' when it stopped
'Whirr' when it stood still
I never knew just what it was
And I guess I never will

It first marched left, then marched right
Then marched under a chair
And when I looked where it had gone
It wasn`t even there

It started to cry and my Daddy laughed
For he knew that I would find
When I turned around my marvelous toy
Chugging from behind

It went 'Zip' when it moved
'Bop' when it stopped
'Whirr' when it stood still
I never knew just what it was
And I guess I never will

Now, the years have gone by
Too quickly it seems
I have my own little boy
And yesterday I gave to him
My marvelous little toy

His eyes nearly popped right out of his head
He gave a squeal of glee
Neither one of us knows just what it is
But he loves it just like me

It still goes 'Zip' when it moves
And 'Bop' when it stops
And 'Whirr' when it stand still

And I guess I never will

There's a calf with a mournful eye.
High above him, there's a swallow
Winging swiftly through the sky.

They laugh with all their might.
Laugh and laugh the whole day through.

Oh, we're meetin' at the courthouse at eight o'clock tonight
You just walk in the door and take the first turn to the right
Be careful when you get there, we hate to be bereft
But we're taking down the names of everybody turning left
Oh, we're the John Birch Society, the John Birch Society
Here to save our country from a communistic plot
Join the John Birch Society, help us fill the ranks
To get this movement started we need lots of tools and cranks
Now there's no one that we're certain the Kremlin doesn't touch
We think that Westbrook Pegler doth protest a bit too much
We only hail the hero from whom we got our name
We're not sure what he did but he's our hero just the same
Oh, we're the John Birch Society, the John Birch Society
Socialism is the ism dismalest of all
Join the John Birch Society, there's so much to do
Have you heard they're serving vodka at the WCTU?
Well you've heard about the agents that we've already named
Well MPA has agents that are flauntedly unashamed
We're after Rosie Clooney, we've gotten Pinkie Lee
And the day we get Red Skelton won't that be a victory
Oh we're the John Birch Society, the John Birch Society
Norman Vincent Peale may think he's kidding us along
But the John Birch Society knows he spilled the beans
He keeps on preaching brotherhood, but we know what he means
We'll teach you how to spot 'em in the cities or the sticks
For even Jasper Junction is just full of Bolsheviks
The CIA's subversive and so's the FCC
There's no one left but thee and we, and we're not sure of thee
Oh, we're the John Birch Society, the John Birch Society
Here to save our country from a communistic plot
Join the John Birch Society holding off the Reds
We'll use our hand and hearts and if we must we'll use our heads
Do you want Justice Warren for your Commissar?
Do you want Mrs. Krushchev in there with the DAR?
You cannot trust your neighbor or even next of kin
If mommie is a commie then you gotta turn her in
Oh, we're the John Birch Society, the John Birch Society
Fighting for the right to fight the right fight for the Right
Join the John Birch Society as we're marching on

Funeral Directors of America, I am very deeply honored standing here;
Receiving this token of your esteem, ""The Funeral Director of the
Year.""
Now I've been asked by all the delegates--and members of the board,
To tell you of the funeral that won me this award.
It was handled with taste and dignity, that much I can say for it;
And I'm sure it will take the family twenty years to pay for it!

[Chorus:]
It was a helluva fun'ral, It was a helluva fun'ral
The finest fun'ral ever booked:
I had some high school juniors who passed around petunial
And lilies everywhere you looked.
It was a helluva fun'ral, I say one helluva fun'ral
Oh, how I wish that you were there;
I had ten drum majorettes doubling on the castanets
It really was a lively affair
It really was a lively affair.
It was a helluva fun'ral, It was a helluva fun'ral
The national guard showed up for me;
And during the oration, they went into formation
And formed the letters R. I. P.
It was a helluva fun'ral, I say one helluva fun'ral
I gave it all my loving care;
The band was on its toes playing ""Mexicali Rose"",
It really was a lively affair.
It really was a lively affair.
A tisket a tasket, Tell us about the casket

[Spoken:]
Well, I'll tell you 'bout the casket, my good friends
It would-a made your poor eyes pop
It was sterling silver all around and a real formica top.
(Formica top, it had a formica top).
Well, I'll tell you 'bout the widow, my good friends,
The widow was in navy blue
With a gown designed by Balenciaga, I supplied that too.
(He sold the widow widow's weeds too).
I held the first funereal raffle, though I don't much like to boast
And I gave away a Chevrolet to the person who cried the most.
(He gave away a brand new Chevrolet). I won it myself!
There were eighteen jugglers by the grave to demonstrate their art
And when they were done, I fired a gun to let the hoot-e-nanny start.
(He fired a gun and the hoot-e-nanny begun).
I was serving beer and prtzels, 'til the hot pastrami came;
And I sold some souvenir hankies with the dear departed's name.
(He was sellin' hankies with the dear departed's name).
As a fitting finale we had the Rockettes from New Your's Music Hall;
As you can see, my very good friends
All in all, all in all:
[Sung:]
It was a helluva fun'ral, I say one helluva fun'ral
No other burial could compare;
It was all done up deluxe 'n' I made forty thousand bucks,
It really was a lively affair. It really was a swingin' affair!",A Dying Business,1998
Chad Mitchell Trio,"All over this great big city
Can't find a woman who's nice and pretty
They all look like page in a magazine
Legs are long and they eat like a sparrow
Figures stick to the straight and narrow
Top and the bottom are same as in between

Show me a pretty little number
When she walks it rolls like thunder
Eyes as deep and dark as the deep blue sea
Round right here and round right there
Pretty red lips and her very own hair
Wrap her up, she's the natural girl for me

Way down in a coffeehouse palace
Found a little lady and her name was Alice
She had friends and her friends had her it seems
Face was dirty and her sweater was baggy
Pants were tight and her hair was shaggy
I've seen her kind on college football teams

Show me a pretty little number
When she walks it rolls like thunder
Eyes as deep and dark as the deep blue sea
Round right here and round right there
Pretty red lips and her very own hair
Wrap her up, she's the natural girl for me

Well, way up at a penthouse pretty
Thirteen miles up above the city
I met a little lady from a wealthy family
Now she could cuss like a real longshoreman
She was making eyes at the doorman
She made a most unusual offer to me

Show me a pretty little number
When she walks it rolls like thunder
Eyes as deep and dark as the deep blue sea
Round right here and round right there
Pretty red lips and her very own hair
Wrap her up, she's the natural girl for me

Way up at a Broadway party
I met a lady, she was very arty
She took me home to see her studio
She took out her paints and she whispered to me
She said that she wanted to 'do' me
Some of that paint will never come off, I know

Show me a pretty little number
When she walks it rolls like thunder
Eyes as deep and dark as the deep blue sea
Round right here and round right there
Pretty red lips and her very own hair
Wrap her up, she's the natural girl for me

Show me a pretty little number
When she walks it rolls like thunder

Round right here and round right there
Pretty red lips and her very own hair

Chad Mitchell Trio,"Come on, you men of sportin' blood and listen to my story
'Tis of the noble Stewball, a gallant racing pony
'Tis also of his rider, who brought ol' Stewball over
He's the diamond of the land and he rolls around in clover

Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win, oh, you'll win
Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win

Oh, the horses they were all brought out with saddle, whip and bridle
The gentlemen did shout when they saw the gallant riders
And some did shout, ""Hooray"" and the air was filled with curses
On the mare, Griselda, the sportsmen lay their purses

Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win, oh, you'll win
Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win

Oh, the trumpet it did sound, and they shot off like an arrow
Ol' Stewball scarcely touched the ground, and the goin' it was narrow
Griselda passed him by, and the sportsmen all did holler
?Oh the gray will win the day, and Stewball, he can foller?

Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win, oh, you'll win
Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win

In the middle of the track, up spoke the noble rider
?I fear we must fall back, that gray is runnin' like a tiger?
Up spoke the noble horse, ""Ride on, ride on my master
We're only half way round the course, and now we'll see who's faster?

Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win, oh, you'll win
Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win

And as they did discourse, ol' Stewball flew like lightnin'
He dashed around the course, and the gray mare she was taken
Ride on, ride on, my noble horse for a good two hundred guineas
Your saddle, it shall be of gold when we pick up our winnings

Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win, oh, you'll win
Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win

Well, past the winning post, bold Stewball went so handy
And both the horse and rider called for sherry, wine and brandy
They drank to that gray mare, the gallant Miss Griselda
And to all who lost their money on the sporting plains of Kildare

Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win, oh, you'll win
Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win

Days and nights are one or so it seems
Why then do you say you've got to leave me
When you can answer all my prayers and dreams?

It's a long and a dusty road.
It's a hard and a heavy load
And the folks we meet ain't always kind.

Some are bad and some are good.
Some have done the best they could.
Some have tried to ease our troubling mind.

Chorus:
And I can't help but wonder where I'm bound, where I'm bound.
Can't help but wonder where I'm bound.

I have traveled across this land
Just a-doing the best I can.
Tryin' to find what I was meant to do.

And the faces that I see
Are as worried as can be.
Looks like they've been wonderin', too.

Chorus

I had a buddy, way back home,
But he started out to roam
And I hear he's out by Monterey,

And sometimes, when I've had a few,
His voice comes singin' through
And I'm a-goin' out to see him some old day.

Chorus

If you see us passin' by
And you sit and you wonder why
And you wish that you were a rambler, too.

Nail your shoes to the kitchen floor,
Lace 'em up, bar the door
And thank the stars for the roof that's over you.

And I can't help but wonder where I'm bound, where I'm bound,
Can't help but wonder where I'm bound.

Our cells just won't divide like they're told
And I'm not really good at this kind of thing

Should I take the advice of the graffiti on the wall telling me to ""go suck it""
Or should I listen to the voices ringing in my head like a broken bell
Can I meet someone nice on the other side looking for more than just a good time
But I don't think it's fine to expect that the universe was born with such a good temper

I sit and do a drawing
A portrait of my mom as a child
I wish we could just get along like we used to

Yeah, it feels just like we can't get enough of it

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say I came up up with more secrets to tell you today
These are my confessions
Slip my mind the last two times
Silly me, so now I gotta give you part three of my confessions
First I told you about the skank that I was cheating with,then I mentioned she's having my kid
That's not all, now I recall more you see, so I'll give you part three of my confessions

Now this is gonna be the hardest thing I ever had to do,
Gonna tell you everything I left out of parts one and two
Like remember when I told you I knew Paulie Shore (Paulie Shore)
That's a lie, I don't know what I said that for
I borrowed your chapstick (from you)
I tried out your nose hair trimmer (too)
And by the way your diamond ring is cubic circonium,
I killed your goldfish accidently, just replaced it with another one

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say I needed to get some things off my chest right away
These are my confessions
Slipped my mind the last two times, silly me, I guess I gotta give you part three of my confessions
I threw up on your dog last time I had too much to drink
There have been times when I've peed in your sink
Don't know why, but you and I should agree that belongs in part three of my confessions

Baby forgive me I'm still trying to figure out why 
I used your toothbrush to clean off the bathroom grought
Oh and sometimes in private, I really like to dress up as Shirley Temple and spank myself with a hockey stick (hockey stick)
My boss thinks I'm a jerk, I didn't get that raise.
I haven't changed my underwear in twenty-seven days!
And when I'm kissing you I fantasize you as a midget
I'm so sorry Debbi! I mean Bridget!

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say I got a few more secrets I'd like to convey
These are my confessions
Slipped my mind the last two times, silly me, I guess I gotta give you part three of my confessions
Gave you buttered toast I dropped and then picked up off the floor
FYI it was not a cold sore
Ooops my bad, but you'll be madder at me when I finish part three of my confessions

You don't know how hard it is for me to tell you this, 
But remember that shirt that you got me for my birthday?
Well, I returned it for store credit. That thing was hideous, what were you thinking?
O and by the way, I wasn't really sick last week,
I just didn't wanna go to your stupid office picnic
Oh and when I told you at breakfast we were all out of rice krispies,
What I meant was that there was only enough left for me. Sorry.

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say, I thought of some more things that should scare you away

Once I blew my nose and wiped it on your cat
And I lied, yes that dress makes you look fat

I'm in the club with my homies, tryna get a lil' v-I, 
Keep it down on the low key, cause you know how it feels. 
I said shawty she was checkin' up on me, 
From the game she was spittin' my ear you'd think that she knew me. 
So we decided to chill 

Conversation got heavy, 
She had me feelin' like she's ready to blow (watch out oh, watch out) 
She saying come get me, come get me, 
So I got up and followed her to the floor, 
She said baby lets go, when I told her I said 

Yeah (yeah) shawty got down an' said come and get me 
Yeah (yeah) I got so caught up I forgot she told me

Now I gotta keep it real now, 
Cause on a one-to-ten she's a certified twenty, and that just ain't me. 

Cause I do know if I take that chance just where is it gonna lead, 
But what I do know is the way she dance makes shawty alright with me. 
The way she getting low!

You were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to
When me and my girl was having problems
You used to say it'll be OK
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I go home at night and lay my head down
Last thing I think about was you

Knowing it should have been you
What's sad is that I love her but I'm falling for you
What should I do
Should I tell my baby bye-bye
Should I do exactly what I feel inside
Could I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together

I never meant to hurt her

I tried, I tried to fight it

Chaim Topol,"This was my dream, in the beginning I dreamt
That we were having a celebration of some kind
Everybody we knew was there, musicians too
And then in the middle of the dream in walks
Your grandma Tzietl, may she rest in peace

Grandma Tzietl, how did she look?
For a woman who's been dead for thirty years
She looked very good, naturally, I went up to greet her
And she said to me

A blessing on your head, Mazel Tov, Mazel Tov
To see a daughter wed, Mazel Tov, Mazel Tov
And such a son-in-law like no one ever saw
The tailor Motel Camzoil, Motel

A worthy boy is he, Mazel Tov, Mazel Tov
Of pious family, Mazel Tov, Mazel Tov
They named him after my dear uncle Mordachai
The tailor Motel Camzoil

A tailor? She must have heard wrong, she meant a butcher

You must have heard wrong grandma, there's no tailor
You mean the butcher grandma by the name of Lazer-Wolfe
No, I mean a tailor Tevye, my great grandchild
My little Tzietl who you named for me
Motel's bride was meant to be

For such a match I prayed, Mazel Tov, Mazel Tov
In heaven it was made, Mazel Tov, Mazel Tov
A fine upstanding boy, a comfort and a joy
The tailor Motel Camzoil

But we announced it already we made a bargain with the butcher

But we announced it grandma to our neighbors
We made a bargain grandma with the butcher Lazer-Wolfe
No, no, no, so you announced it Tevye that's your headache
But as for Lazer-Wolfe I say to you, Tevye that's your headache too

A blessing on your house, Mazel Tov, Mazel Tov
Imagine such a spouse, Mazel Tov, Mazel Tov
And such a son-in-law like no one ever saw
The tailor Motel Camzoil

It was the butcher
The tailor Motel Camzoil
It was Lazer-Wolfe
The tailor Motel Camzoil

Look who is this, who is this, who comes here
Who, who, who, who, what woman is this?
By righteous and is shaking
Could it be, sure, yes it could, why not
Who could be mistaken

It's the butcher's wife come from beyond the grave
It's the butcher's dear, darling, departed wife

Fruma Sarah
Fruma Sarah
Fruma Sarah

Tevye, Tevye, Tevye
What is this about your daughter marrying my husband?
Yes, he's her husband

Would you do this to your friend and neighbor, Fruma Sarah
Have you no consideration for a woman's feelings
Handing over my belongings to a total stranger

How can you allow it out, how can you let your daughter
To take my place, live in my house, carry my keys
And wear my clothes, pearls, how?

How can you allow your daughter to take her place
House, keys, clothes, pearls

Such a learned man as Tevye wouldn't, let it happen
Tell me that it isn't true and then I wouldn't worry
Say you didn't give your blessing to your daughter's marriage
Let me tell you what would follow such a fataled wedding

If Tzietl marries Lazer-Wolfe I pity them both
She'd live with him three weeks and when three weeks are up
I'll come to her by night, I'll take her by the throat
And this I'll give your Tzietl, that I'll give your Tzietl, this I'll give your Tzietl

Here's my wedding present if she marries Lazer-Wolfe
It's an evil spirit may it fall into the river, may it sink into the earth
Such a dark and horrible dream and to think
It was brought on by that butcher

If my grandma Tzietl, may she rest in peace
Took the time to come all the way from the other world to tell us
About the tailor all we can say is that it's for the best
And it couldn't possibly get any better, Amen, Amen

A blessing on my head, Mazel Tov, Mazel Tov
My Grandma Tzietl said, Mazel Tov, Mazel Tov
We'll have a son-in-law like no one ever saw
The tailor Motel Camzoil

We haven't got the man, Mazel Tov, Mazel Tov
We had when we began, Mazel Tov, Mazel Tov
But since your grandma came, she'll marry, what's his name

The tailor Motel Camzoil, the tailor Motel Camzoil
The tailor Motel Camzoil, the tailor Motel Camzoil

Retaliation is a must when you fuck with us
Tell me what was on your mind when you loaded your pistol up?
Was it some gangsta shit, that couldn't been it (nah, that ain't it)

Break bones as rug-be-snug, slugs being sold and printless
Stay spittin' at your divisions, hit your visions

If it gets adventures, affective niggas, arrest resistance
Timper screamin' that deaf vast words splintered without the whispers
Connects got prices for product, but Tune fathers vanish
Rock the cuts now I control sonic voices like ???

Category code of the street let's see the next day

Cause it's beef on the streets then kick, kick the cow
Catapult and critters kick 'em, quickers clap
Cookin' trio's like Crio, I'll split that ass that go show your crack

Crazy, deranged, strange, with a sharp aim
And shootin' range as deep as Danny maintain gets forfeited
When we show up to play the sport
Niggas show the military support and fight for what you brought up
Play to a good battle, battle and got grazed
In the heart of New Jersey - straight land of the crazed
Bad blood boils and picky goals will destroy you
Fans, straight hand me the jams to unemploy you
Yo, so you better keep it real right and tight

Remembering I'm pretending to be where I'm not anymore
A little taste of hypocrisy
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake
Slow to react
Even though you're so close to me
You're still so distant, and I can't bring you back

Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories

Old black magic that you weave so well

I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for 
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Holding confidence that will never, never fail
Hearing angels´ voices singing ""Love Prevail""
Oh darling.... oh, hey, come closer to me, and let my love, when me sing, come

Chaka Demus & Pliers,"Rock And Roll Music
Just let me hear some of that
Rock And Roll Music,
Any old way you choose it,
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it,
Any old time you use it.
It's gotta be Rock And Roll Music,
If you want to dance with me,
If you want to dance with me.

I've got no kick againt modern jazz,
Unless they try to play it too darn fast,
And change the beauty of the melody,
Until they sounded like a symphony,
That's why I go for that
Rock and roll music 

I took my loved one over cross the tracks
So she can hear my man await a sax,
I must admit the have a rockin' band,
Man they were going like a hurricane
That's why I go for that
Rock and roll music 

Way down South they gave a jubilee,
The jockey folks they had a jamboree,
They're drinkin' homebrew from a water cup,
The folks dancin' they all got shook up
And started playin' that
Rock and roll music 

Don't care to hear 'em play a tango,
I'm in the mood to dig a mambo,
It's way to early for a congo,
So keep a rockin' that piano
So I can hear some of that
Rock and roll music",Roadrunner,1993

Chaka Demus & Pliers,"Me love you so well
You make me skin swell
The world me tell
Though I've tried before to tell her
Of the feelings I have for her in my heart
Everytime that I come near her
I just lose my nerve as I've done from the start
Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on
What me say
Girl I want to fill your sexual appetite
Want to take you on a magic carpet ride
Want to make you a proposal to be my wife
Give you love comfort for the rest of your life
I'll never make you sad I will treat you right
If there's a dark cloud me a go change it to bright
Girl I want to fill your sexual appetite
Want to take you on a magic, on a magic, on a magic ride
Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on
Do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days since we first met
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me who ends up getting wet
Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on
I resolved to call her up
A thousand times a day
And ask her if she would marry me
In some old fashioned way
But my silent fears have gripped me
Long before I reach the phone
Long before my tongue has tripped me
Must I always be alone
Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on
If I told you that I love you girl what would you say?
I need you in my life every step of the way oh ho yeah
Just believe every word I say
Surrender your love you will make my day
Woman me are your love injection
Woman me want for stick you in your love section
Nah go make you be no substitution
To me you are every solution

And so afraid but alive

And you've finally broken free

Throw my heart away each spring
Now a spring romance
Hasn't got a chance
Promised my first dance to winter
All I've got to show's a splinter
For my little fling

Spring, this year has got me feeling like a horse
That never left the post
I lay in my room
Starring up at the ceiling
Spring can really hang you up the most

Morning kiss wakes trees and flower
And to them my life
To drink a toast I walk in the park
Just to kill those lonely hours
Spring can really hang you up the most

All afternoon
Those birds tweet-a-tweet I know their tune
This is love this is it
Heard it before
And I know the score
And I decide that love is a bore
Love seem sure around the new year
Now it's April

Love is just a ghost
Spring arrived on time
But what became of you, dear
Spring can really hang you up the most
Spring can really hang you up the most

Spring is here
There's no mistaken
Robins build their nest from coast to coast
My heart tries the same
So they won't hear it breaking
Spring can really hang you up the most

College boys are riding somewhere
Tender passion there it grows
But I'm on the shelf with last years easter bonnet
Spring can really hang you up the most

Love came my way
I'm holding the last
We had our day
Now that's all in the past
Spring came along
A season of song
For love's sweet promise
But something went wrong
Doctor's once prescribed a tonic
Sulfur and molasses was the dose
Didn't help me a bit
My condition must be chronic
Spring can really hang you up the most

All alone, the party's over
Winter was a gracious host
But when you keep praying
For snow to hide the clover
Spring can really hang you up the most",Spring Can Really Hang You up the Most,1982

Sometimes I wonder
About the facts of love
I sit and wonder
About the facts of love

More and more than all the stars above

How ya got inside my system
But I feel the sweetest pain
I, I can't do that
But I got to break this tension
If it makes you feel the same

An ordinary woman
That's all I am
And I think I'm falling
For an ordinary man

Take me to your heart
When the love begins
You and I can only try
To make a love with no strings
Take me to your heart
When the story ends
You and I we can't deny
We're making love with no strings
No conductor
Could've played this situation
Better than a fool or millionaire
I won't tie you down
With a little love and affection
All I want to do is share

A little time together
Maybe holding hands
An ordinary woman
And an ordinary man

Take me to your heart
When the love begins
You and I could say goodbye
And we'll always be friends
Take me to your heart
When the story ends
You and I we can't deny
We got a love with no strings
",Love With No Strings,1992
Chaka Khan,"Cold endless summer days
Since you went away
Tore my heart in two
And now wandering through the night
I see the city lights
Feelin' so in need
I'll never be at peace

[Chorus]
Love you all my lifetime
Lost to you eternally
Everything in my life
Tells me we were meant to be

Strange there's always something wrong
Dreams don't last that long
What part did I play in that game
And now, now you turn away
Excuses are too late
Feelin' so in need, I'll never be at peace

Won't you call me boy

Stay with me baby
Stay here for a little while
Won't you say you'll stay here for the night
Stay right here with me sweet baby
Stay here for a little while
For a while

I'm sitting at my window
And I look
Where are you

I wonder if you even know
You belong to me
No matter where you roam
You've got to take me

I'm givin' my everything
Givin' all my time
So darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin' please

I never knew which way to go
Everybody had an answer
So I said
Go lecture someone, go lecture someone

I could feel it in my heart babe
I couldn't scream, I couldn't shout
I had to find out in my own way
Ran into someone - ran into someone

I'll be the woman I am
Now I don't have to hide
All that I feel inside
I'll be the woman I am
Just had to let it show
Had nowhere else to go

I had to learn to trust myself
I had to learn just when to say no
Always trying to please someone else
I had to let go, I had to let go

The world is filled of many wonders
I had to look to heaven for my own
I saw the star that I was unter
Lord lead me back home, lead me back home

You had another lover
I read the signs, but I tried to hide
All the pain I felt inside

You can make the story right
I believe what you say though you tell me lies

Chaka Khan,"Coming with the realness lyrics of life 
Some people need to watch what they say 

Watch what you're saying 
Someone's gonna hear exactly what you said 
Soon you'll be paying 
In the dead of night they'll be nowhere to run 
While you were laying 
Laying for the doom that's coming to a head 
No kind of praying 
Is gonna save us from the past that will surely come 

Warning, rappers be like boring 
They're sleeping, it's deep man 
So peep in closely when I'm speaking 
Weaklings, it's obvious you can't like up to 
Your petty pointless words, yet and still you love to 
Run off your jibs, now there come a time for judgement 
Punishment, what if we take away your ornaments 
And strip you down to the raw deal 
Then I'd reveal the evidence 
Cause you don't really represent 

Watch what you're saying 
Someone's gonna hear exactly what you said 
Soon you'll be paying 
In the dead of night they'll be nowhere to run 
While you were laying 
Laying for the doom that's coming to a head 
No kind of praying 
Is gonna save us from the past that will surely come 

Listen here 
I'm getting tired of you shooting lip 
You better tighten up 
Or you will really slip up 
And say something that you mean to do 
Turn around and it'll be on you 
To save yourself from your call and blunder 
And bury your ??? like the world it's under 
And like a fool you'll sit and wonder 
What, who do you want to know, wish 
No water, no magic spell 
Can save you from your self made hell 
You've made your bed and you know darn well 
You got a lay it in the ?
And there's no magic potion 
To save you from the wheels you've set in motion 
The stone is cut, the die is cast 
What were you thinking 

Watch what you're saying 
Someone's gonna hear exactly what you said 
Soon you'll be paying 
In the dead of night they'll be nowhere to run 
While you were laying 
Laying for the doom that's coming to a head 
No kind of praying 
Is gonna save us from the past that will surely come 

I can't understand it, they should ban it, can it 
Too much weak talk and not enough real hip-hop 
I sense a purpose is filling me 
To display credibility and show responsibility, willingly 
I'll take on any Johnny Dangerous 
Pull his file, for he knows he cannot hang with this 
The illest king, I smack the jokers 
No hocus pocus, a real MC when I kick vocals 

Watch what you're saying 
Someone's gonna hear exactly what you said 
Soon you'll be paying 
In the dead of night they'll be nowhere to run 
While you were laying 
Laying for the doom that's coming to a head 
No kind of praying 
Is gonna save us from the past that will surely come",Watch What You Say [Interview],1995

Now I'm wondering if your love's still strong

The music was young and strong
And the melody still lingers on

From Coltrane to Stevie

And I'm reckless it's true, but what else can you do
At the end of a love affair?

So I talk a little too much and I laugh a little too much
And my voice is too loud when I'm out in a crowd
So that people are apt to stare

Do they know, do they care, that it's only that I'm lonely
And low as can be?
And the smile on my face isn't really a smile at all!

So I smoke a little too much and I drink a little too much
And the tunes I request aren't always the best
But the ones where the trumpets blare!

So I go at a maddening pace
I pretend that it's taking his place

For every wish you make to the stars
There's one silent kiss I send to the sky

Until you I was lost in my dreams
And I never knew that love could feel like heaven

In a world of grey

Chaka Khan,"I got a problem with democracy
Don't know what it really means
A livin' lie, devoid of honesty
Where nothing's really what it seems

I'm in a funky situation
Doom is lurkin' ever nearer
I'm waiting for a revelation
Each day the signs are getting' clearer

Lies to my left, wrong to my right
Compassion unknown
This must be the twilight zone
A grizzly affair
Caught unaware
Why am I so scared
Where have all the flowers gone?

I've got a problem with democracy
So where exactly do I stand?
Who is this dark cloud hangin' over me?
It ain't from God; it must be a man
He is the one that you will seldom see
The new world order is his name
He's got a plan in mind for you and me
There are no winners in this game

Lies to my left, wrong to my right
Compassion unknown
This must be the twilight zone
And I'm standin' here
Tryin' to lose the fear
For this I would die
The truth will open up my eyes

Love will set you free from democracy

Supreme power invested in the people
Is a bit extreme
The highest rank of authority
Only God is Supreme!

And taken
And if this love can't come to pass

Chaka Khan,"This is a story of mind, soul and heart
Come to think of it, don't know where to start
I'd take it from the top but we don't have that much time
So I'm breakin' off a piece of this crazy life of mine

As a little girl, I had a stubborn mind
Bonnie and me were wild most of the time
I used to sing for mama's company
I guess that was the start of the woman I came to be

Sometimes young, yet so old
Warm to the touch, intellectually cold
I love the how and why of it
Thank God, the pieces seem to fit
Pieces seem to fit in this crazy life of mine

Never will forget from whence I came
I have some regrets but I made myself a name
Two times a mother and as many times wed
Tough times were around me but better times ahead

I see you and me in this crazy life of mine

Aight then, here's a pair
Lace 'em up tight then you might feel what was dealt to me
You see ain't no young boys up in here, keep a clear head

Tryin' to keep my pockets on stuffed like deer heads
Upon the wall, so all the gall we get from y'all don't faze
So mind your biz and walk away
'Cause I'm never gonna let you up inside my maze

I don't care about what you think you see
The thangs you want to know when you look at me
God knows I done been there and paid my dues
I can't change how you feel, 'cause it's all, on you-whoahha-ohh

Swang corners, put aim on 'em

Leave brains on 'em and stains on 'em
Get three grams of my main smoker

Reminded me of us society

Frequent find the reasons
Niggas stepping on my sneakers
Got me steaming, I should beat 'em up
Or get beat up and say somebody made ugly

So disgusted seeing couples coupled up in public hugging
Huffing puffing phone reluctant

Equalize or I'd go insane

Now I know that I may have cause some sorrow
Will nothing cause I'm living that way

Or judge me in a negative way
Won't you?

For every wish you make to the stars
There's one silent kiss I send to the sky

And I never knew that love could feel like heaven

In a world of grey

Chakeria,"Wann seh' ich Tageslicht? Komm und geb' nicht auf
Weißt du wie hart es ist? Lebe deinen Traum
Ich leb' in ewiger Nacht, Komm und steh auf
Ob mein Herz je wieder lacht? Wenn du dran glaubst

Geh meinem Schicksal entgegen, 
Mein Herz blutet mit Wörtern, meine Tränen sind der Regen, 
Schaurige Szenen die sich in mir niederlegen, 
Ich bin ein Kind der Trauer und vor meinen Augen stirbt der Segen, 
Bin von Einsamkeit und Angst umgeben, 
Und muss diese Zeilen mit den Fasern meines Herzens weben, 
Mich über den Winter meines Kummers erheben, 
Die traurigen Schlachten meiner Träume Gestalt geben 
Musste vieles in meinem Herzen aufgeben, 
Und träume im Dreck von kleinem Glück, so ist es eben, 
Die Sehnsucht hat mir den Lebensdurst gegeben, 
Schweigen, Wut und Trauer die sich heute in mir niederlegen, 
Ich muss die Dunkelheit Stück für Stück zerlegen, 
Meinen Finger in meine brennende, nicht heilende Wunde legen, 
Denn heute bekenn ich mich schuldig zu leben 
Und versuche kampfhaft dies leben zu vergeben Bitch! 

Wann seh' ich Tageslicht? Komm und geb' nicht auf
Weißt du wie hart es ist? Lebe deinen Traum
Ich leb' in ewiger Nacht, Komm und steh auf
Ob mein Herz je wieder lacht? Wenn du dran glaubst

Mama, bitte weck' mich nicht auf, 
Ich hasse die grauen Wände in diesem dreckigen Haus, 
Mama, ich kann das alles nicht mehr sehen, 
Ich guck mir mein Leben an und kann es nicht verstehen, 
Mama, das Wasser tropft von den Decken, 
Sag mir, warum muss ich mich in diesem Loch verstecken? 
In diesem Loch zwischen all den dunklen Gängen, 
Wenn ich spielen wollte durfte ich mit den Hunden bellen, 
Ich geh jetzt raus und werd' Geld verdienen, 
Hab keine Angst, ich werd' mich nie in diese Welt verlieben, 
Die Welt in der wir nie wieder glücklich werden, 
Alles was ich will, ist einfach nur glücklich sterben, Mama
Erzähl mir, wie sieht ein Regenbogen aus? 
Wie sieht im Himmel, das Leben oben aus? 
Ich weiß nicht was mir der Schmerz verspricht, 
Ich weiß nur eins es tut weh wenn ein Herz zerbricht, Mama

Wann seh' ich Tageslicht? Komm und geb' nicht auf
Weißt du wie hart es ist? Lebe deinen Traum
Ich leb' in ewiger Nacht, Komm und steh auf
Ob mein Herz je wieder lacht? Wenn du dran glaubst

Bin auf der Suche nach dem Glück, mein Navigator die Hoffnung, 
Ich träum von dem Tag an dem die meinen hochkommen, 
Das Schicksal ist mein Weg, 
Ich leg mich in die Arme Gottes, kann nicht sehen, doch spüren wie er mich trägt, 
Die Familie ist mein Herz, 
Mein Blut ist mein Vers, 
Meine Tränen sind der Schmerz, Bruder 
Ich kann nicht lassen von dem Traum den ich hege, 
Mein Weg den ich gehe ist mein Traum den ich lebe, choya 
Meine Tochter ist mein Licht, 
Ich gehe durch die Hölle, flieg zum Himmel und hole einen Stern nur für dich, 
Allah ist meine Seele, 
Dein ist mein Leben, 
Sein Wort ist mein Weg den ich wähle, 
Der Beton in meinen Knochen, der Asphalt in meinem Schädel, 
Glaub' mir es ist kalt da wo wir leben, 
Meine Liebe ist meine Kraft, 
Ihre Flügel die mich tragen und mich hoffen lassen dass ich's doch schaffe 

Wann seh' ich Tageslicht? Komm und geb' nicht auf
Weißt du wie hart es ist? Lebe deinen Traum
Ich leb' in ewiger Nacht, Komm und steh auf
Ob mein Herz je wieder lacht? Wenn du dran glaubst

Wann seh' ich Tageslicht? Komm und geb' nicht auf
Weißt du? Lebe deinen Traum
Wie hart es ist? 
Ich leb' in ewiger Nacht, Komm und steh auf
Wenn du dran glaubst
Hmm wenn du dran glaubst",Ewige Nacht,2004

Chakuza,"Du lebst in deiner kleinen Welt, es tut uns Leid,du bist leider du,
Doch leider kannst du nichts erzählen man von Schweiß und Blut
Wir sind verschieden Junge merk dir eins wir teilen nicht,
Du lebst in deiner heilen Welt und ja ich scheiß' auf dich

Ich scheiß' auf deine heile Welt man du bist leider du,
Verschließ' die Tür denn du kriegst heute von uns zwei Besuch,
Wir sind verschieden und wir teilen niemals deine Sicht,
Du siehst wie deine heile Welt in tausend Teile bricht.

Hier bist du weg und keiner sieht's wenn es passiert
Und bist du frech kannst du statt Geld nur eine Kiezschelle kassieren
Es hat sich viel verändert hier es wirkt so endlos jeden Tag
Denn statt zu betteln um was Bares sagt man „Hände hoch du Arsch“
Es ist alles Frust und niemals Schluss mit diesem Dreck
Nur einen Schuss und du bist weg Junge russisches Roulette
Und statt lustig ist es hässlich und grau
Und zum Schluss kriegst du statt Essen nur ein Messer in den Bauch
Hört die Sachen und verbietet es
Ich bin froh ich brauche Kraft denn diese Straße war noch nie gerecht
Idiot was für ein Absturz Junge siehst du es
Du hast erst Frieden wenn dich irgend so ein Bastard mal kurz abmurgst und dann liegen lässt
Du kannst hart sein oder arm, ein Soldat, bist du da, bist du am Arsch
Scheiß-egal was einmal war
Jeder Schlag trifft dich hart so schwer am Kopf wie ein Boxer
Jetzt wird Scarface ein Star und Harry Potter ein Opfer

Du lebst in deiner kleinen Welt, es tut uns Leid, du bist leider du,

Die Welt ist grau und du siehst jeden Tag den gleichen Müll
Weil sich kein Kühlschrank an diesem Ort alleine füllt
Hier platzen deine Seifenblasen hier macht keiner Geld
Und leider hat auch keiner Lust Kanaken einzustellen
Hier stirbt die Hoffnung und zwar jeden Tag
Deine Welt ist kunterbunt doch in dieser Welt ist die Tapete schwarz
Du kannst mir glauben hier schreibt man die Probleme groß
Was für Skrupel unsre Jugend geht auf Lehrer los
Wo siehst du Kinder spielen? Ich seh' nur Kinder dealen
Und wenn schon Kinder dealen ist das echt ein Kinderspiel
In dieser Welt siehst du jeden Tag den gleichen Dreck
Menschen verlieren wirklich alles und verzweifeln echt
Wo dein arbeitsloser Vater ohne Kohle ist
Und deine Mutter auch im Supermarkt den Boden wischt
Und mir ist wirklich so egal ob dir der Scheiß gefällt
Leb' dein Leben jetzt in deiner heilen Welt

Du lebst in deiner kleinen Welt, es tut uns Leid, du bist leider du,
Doch leider kannst du nichts erzählen man von Schweiß und Blut

Es ist traurig, es ist wolkig, es ist grau,
Auch das Blaulicht hellt den Horizont nicht auf so sieht's aus (So sieht's aus)
Jeder Clown wird im Vollkontakt verhauen
Währen die Vollspassten da draußen ein Wolkenkratzer bauen
Und das Volk kommt hier nicht raus es bleibt da
Scheiße bleibt Scheiße es bleibt einfach alles da
Scheiße bleibt Scheiße und kommt einfach aus'm Arsch
Und dieses Jahr kommt für die kleinen auch der Weihnachtsmann in schwarz
Du kannst das alles ignorieren wenn du die Augen schließt
Doch hier trägt jeder eine Waffe und zwar aus Prinzip
Du hörst richtig sie sprechen hier gebrochen deutsch
Kein Aspirin der Schädel wird vom Smog betäubt
Du meinst ich übertreib schön für dich ich untertreib
Du spürst das warme Blut vom Messerstich im Unterleib
Scheiß' auf deine heile Welt herzlich willkommen hier in meiner Welt
Ich begrüße deine Jungs mit 16 Schellen

Egal ob mit Rhymes oder beim Einzelkampf
Man euch zu punchen ist noch leichter als das Einmaleins zu schreiben Punk
Von wegen meine Herkunft wäre ein Witz, ich hab mein Land verraten
Ich mach mein Bussinnes hier den damals hatte schwache Karten
Ja ich geb ein fick drauf was die Affen sagen
Sieh da ein Blitz ich jag euch Splitter in den Arsch wie scharfe Handgranaten
Sieh es doch so, ich hab entschieden wo ich wohne
Es viel mir leicht zu entscheiden große Liebe oder Hoe
Ihr wollt Krieg führen aber wo? Denn es kann sein das ihr sauer seid
Ihr Bauern bleibt zuhause und knallt Feinde ab bei Counterstrike
Immer das gleiche ich seh Neid in den Gesichtern
Doch sei leise Wichser sonst kriegst du mein Teil in deinen Dickdarm
Denn nichts tut mir leid, sei mein Feind oder Freund
Ich hab viele Moves gemacht, aber keinen den ich bereue

Also Augen auf, Schnauze zu, Klappe halten, still
Denn ihr hab keine Chance wenn ich ein' zusammenfalten will

Schnall die Flügel an und und flieg wie Ikarus zur Sonne
Wer hält mich auf, ihr seid zwar groß aber gefickt
Obwohl ihr flowen könnt wird das nichts wie bei Goliath und Kid
Keine Show ich zieh dein Cash ab mit der ganzen Welt denn ey ihr wisst es
Wenn nicht mit Rap mach ich mit Schwanz mein Geld: Penis Business!
Österreich ist meine Heimat, ja es stimmt
Und es war alles ziemlich geil da als ich klein war und ein Kind
Jetzt bin ich weg und ihr meint es sei Verrat was ich begannen hab
Und meine Welt besteht ab jetzt aus Schlagzeilen und Kameras
Doch alles klar, denn ich muss keinem irgendwas beweisen
Nur schlafen, etwas essen und irgendwann mal scheißen
Das ist meine Art und Weise wie ich Danke sag
Das ihr so abgefuckte schlampen wart
Wärt ihr nicht wäre ich gar nicht da
Und trotzdem bleibt das alles hart
Wie Leben in der Gang weiter Tag für Tag
Parts die eure Schädeldecken sprengen

Also Augen auf, Schnauze zu, Klappe halten, still
Denn ihr hab keine Chance wenn ich ein' zusammenfalten will

Ich halt das Ohr auf die Straße
Glaube es oder glaub's nicht
Schau ich zieh jeden mit mir rauf, der mit mir down is
Jeder kriegt vertrauen und ihr erzählt mir ich sei abgehoben
Punker ihr seid fassungslos mein weg geht bis ganz nach oben
Du Vogel ich bin nicht Phönix aus der Asche Junge
Nein ich will den Thron ich seh nach König aus du Affe
Also schön hol deine Waffe raus mach stress zu jeder zeit
Für den Kampf brauchst du ein Messer, aber ich wähle das Mic

Und du gehst baden, Mann, wie ein zu nah am Fluss gebautes Haus
Halt die Schnauze!

Denn in Wahrheit ist mein Schlafplatz noch am Boden
Ich muss nicht nach Hollywood und mit allen Stars Sekt saufen
Ich muss mit dem Bus noch zu Aldi fahren und Essen kaufen
Nur weil ich rappe, kann ich Essen kaufen
Auch wenn mein Geld längst nicht reicht, um hier endlich mal wegzulaufen
Ich schreibe Zeilen und ich pack sie auf meinen Beat
Während die Kleinen aus Verzweiflung auf der Straße stehen und dealen
Seht die Wahrheit, dass mein Partner in dem Lied
Kids der Straße widerspiegelt und ein Pate ist für sie
Denk' mal nach, was sie dir sagen, ist das echt oder der letzte Stuss?
Ja, Mann, ich laber Dreck, wenn ich den ganzen Tag Dreck fressen muss
Und ja, sie wollen weg und einen Entschluss ziehen und da raus

Weil ihr meint, dass meine Texte viel zu skrupellos sind
Wo sind die Kinder? Wo sind sie, wenn die Schule beginnt?
Du siehst sie sitzen draußen auf der Straße und sie suchen den Sinn
Es geht um Klauen und um Dealerei, jeder will ein Spieler sein
Heute ist es Gras ticken und morgen Autoschieberei
Okay, das gibt's in Dörfern nicht
Doch ich lebe in Berlin
Wo sich ein Junkie jede Scheiße in den Körper spritzt
Was kann ich dafür, dass so etwas passiert?
Denkt ihr, ich hab' durch Musik eure Kinder dazu animiert?
Ich denke manchmal echt, dass es keiner begreifen mag
Ich hab' eure Kinder so gemacht, das war leicht gesagt

Chakuza,"Ich kapier' das hier nie, ich versteh's nicht
Aber irgendwie fehlen mir die täglichen Depris
Im Schädel die Hintergrundmusik
Als hätte ich Tetris auf der zehnten Stufe gespielt
Ich schmiss damals als Kind, 'ne Party bei McDonald's
Doch es kamen nur Harlekins wie Ronald
Aber als vor dem Sommer ein Anruf kam
Dachte ich, oh man, wieder Eier für die Pfannkuchen da
Was soll ich anfangen, da ich wie so oft keinen Plan hat
Kaufe erstmal meinem Mädchen das versprochene Fahrrad
Das rote oder in weiß
Oder gleich beide, weil die Kohle nun reicht
Komm steig ein, lass uns wegfahren,
Denn ich komme mir so unheimlich groß vor
Denn mein Auto hat ein Lenkrad und einen Motor
Ein Wunder, unglaublich, undenkbar
Schon seit Tagen ist die Laune nicht mehr unten im Keller

(Und alles) wieder gut das Gefühl im Bauch
Unglaublich, kein Ruß, Blütenstaub
(Denn alles) sorgenfrei, unbekannt
Halt die Zeit für 'ne Stunde an

(Und alles) wieder gut das Gefühl im Bauch
Unglaublich, kein Ruß, Blütenstaub
(Denn alles) sorgenfrei, unbekannt
Halt die Zeit für 'ne Stunde an

Ich kapier' das hier nie. Was und wie? Keine Ahnung!
Im Briefkasten liegt mal wieder keine Mahnung
Im Kopf hab ich Musik, doch keine Oper ertönt
Nein, Kings Of Leon mit „Closer“ wie schön
Und so hab ich es mir immer vorgestellt, dass
Es nicht in Worte zu fassen ist, überfordert mich fast
Rein ins Bett, ein Traum oder echt?
Ich gähne, kneif mich selbst, blauer Fleck, der Zehnte
Für 'n Tapetenwechsel ewig gebraucht,
Leg mich auf die bequemste Couch, die Ikea verkauft
Und guck mal ich habe 'ne Matratze im Bett
Und mein Hund endlich Futter im Napf, das ihm schmeckt
Endlich seh' ich meinen Dad und meine Schwester mal wieder
Ich hab Geld für Benzin, 1, 60 pro Liter
Doch ich traue mich jetzt noch nicht loszufahren
Blauer Fleck Nummer elf auf dem Oberarm

(Und alles) wieder gut das Gefühl im Bauch
Unglaublich, kein Ruß, Blütenstaub
(denn alles) sorgenfrei, unbekannt
Halt die Zeit für 'ne Stunde an

Nun hat sich doch alles zum Positiven gewendet
Denn nach so langer Zeit im Abseits waren Liebe und Vertrauen
Gefühle, die ich nicht mehr kannte
Drei Jahre lang ging ich durch's Leben wie ein Schlafwandler
Dann bin ich aufgewacht und entdeckte die Welt für mich neu
Dabei alle, wirklich alle falschen Freunde und schlechte Menschen 
Gegen die guten getauscht
Mein Gott das war nicht immer leicht,
Aber jetzt kann ich endlich wieder auf mein Herz hören
Ich bin glücklich
Überglücklich
Und ich danke all jenen, die mein Leben etwas besser gemacht haben
Schöner gemacht haben und ein Teil dieses Albums waren

Chakuza,"Ich setz' mich hin und schreibe einfach mal den Brief meines Lebens
Erzähle alles einem Blatt, egal wie viel ihn lesen
Seh' mich gerade noch am Strand spazieren, Hand in Hand mit meiner Frau
Ich hab mich vor 'ner Wand platziert, starr sie an, wein mich aus
Reibe meine Augen spür' den Sand in ihn' und heule los
Noch vor Tagen war das alles angenehm, die Freude groß
Heute tobt ein Sturm in meinem Kopf und hört nicht auf zu wüten
Sonne weg der Wind macht braunes Laub, blaue Blüten
Steh auf und geh zum Kühlschrank hol das vierte Bier raus
Was sich in meim' Bierglas spiegelt, das sieht wirklich nicht nach mir aus
Ich verlier' mich gerade selbst verdammt ich kenn' das leider schon
Es fühlt sich an als würde irgend so ein Fremder in mir wohn'
Hab die Kräfte nie geschont, bekomm' die Rechnung präsentiert
Denn im echten Leben läuft es nun mal echt nicht wie geschmiert
Mein Gedächtnis explodiert es vermischt sich alles kreuz und quer
Und alles was mir früher einmal leicht fiel, fällt mir heute schwer

Wieder muss der Boden unter meinen Füßen beben
So bedrohlich dieses honigsüße Leben
Ich geh den Weg den die großen Männer gegangen sind
Das hat sich verändert von jetzt an geh ich woanders hin

Aber niemand hat die Kräfte weder Zwerge noch Riesen
Um die Hälfte eines Berges zu verschieben
Und so schieb' ich eben meinen Berg alleine
Doch egal wie alleine ich bin, ich kriegs' hin

Nehme alle alten Dinge, mal' nen Grabstein daneben
Grabe alles das was etwas schlimmes ist ein
Ich habe so viel falsch gemacht aber so will ich nicht sein
Ich wär' gern wie alle andern' gern ein friedlicher Vater
Aber ziehe durch die Bars, gestiefelter Kater
Muss mich abschießen, denn sonst mach ich heut Nacht wieder kein Auge zu
Anstatt es zu verarbeiten, kipp ich lieber aus den Schuhen
Genug und Happy Birthday Chak, willkomm' im neuen Leben
Da wo alle Leute die du mal enttäuscht hast dir vergeben
Ja ich sehs' da war ein Licht, jippie, wieder am Leben
Und ich werd' mein altes Ich wie 'nen Marienkäfer zertreten
Vergeblich was gesucht, was mich mal glücklich macht
Und nun ist das in Wirklichkeit passiert sag wie verrückt ist das
Spielt die ganze Welt verrückt, denn ich hab endlich meinen Platz
Das letzte mal die Füllfeder noch angefasst, ich schreibe was

Ich konnt' die ganze Nacht nicht schlafen, war wach
Einen Kaffee nehmen um 8, kalte Pizza von gestern

Doch sitz' mit Dosenbier am Sofa, statt mit Noten vorm Klavier
Ohne Hosen, unrasiert, schlechter Atem, schlechte Karten
Verpass' die besten Tage, die Welt hat nicht gewartet

Besser ohne viel Gerede wieder schlafen zu gehen

Jeden Abend, jede Bar, steh ich da und schnorre Drinks
Schnorre Kippen, aber schicke in den Himmel, was sie oben nicht haben
Zitronenlimonade, Chips und Schokolade
Nun sitz' ich da und finde keine Worte
Leider kein Spaß, keiner springt aus der Torte
Doch ab Morgen werde ich mich wohl messen mit den Größten
Geh zum Bäcker, hol Brötchen und wecke Dornröschen
Und wir gehn' spazieren im Park, werden einmützen im Gras
Einen Moment lang fühln' wie ein glückliches Paar
Manchmal hab ich das Gefühl, ich würde dich hassen
Nix machen, oder unsere Brücken einstürzen lassen

Chakuza,"Man sitzt im Auto oder Bus die Fahrt beginnt
Jedes Bild das man im Kopf hat hat die Tragik eines Films
Doktor Schiwago auf der Leinwand flimmert wie schöne Kerzen
Ganz alleine keine Kinder die mit Klingeltönen nerven
Leere Blicke allen zieht es das Gesicht runter im Herbst
Wir wären alle lieber Krabben fang' am Fischkutter im Meer
Mehr ist nicht drin, es bleiben leider alle Tage die gleichen
Sehen die Freiheit durch vereiste und beschlagene Scheiben
Alles Chaos, das war wohl die Hälfte unsres' Lebens
Lagen regungslos da, Marionetten ohne Fäden
Unser Platz in der Bahn ist wohl übrig geblieben
Wir fahren zum Flughafen, denn da gibt es Züge die fliegen
Und wir fahren, wir sind alt und die Haare werden schütter
War noch niemals in Australien, Koalabären füttern

Und mit Gitarren hat das alles begonn'

Ich dreh' mal lauter, dass der schöne Sound nach außen dringt
Ich merk', hör ich genauer hin, dass hundert andre' auch mitsing'
Unglaublich wie man sehen kann,
Das jedes Ding das uns je gequält hat schmilzt wie ein Schneeball
In der Gegenwart bin ich zufrieden, ziemlich schräge Sache
Ja fast niedlich, denn man sieht sogar die Zähne wenn ich lache
Alles das hat dieses Lied geschafft, ich lieb' es
Für immer auf Repeat schalten und nie wieder die Beatles
Ich schrieb gefühlte tausend Jahre negative Dinge
Denn ich war über den Ausgang meines Lebens nie im Bilde
War kein Wille da, jeder kleine Blick, den ich erhascht hab
Wie auch immer wurde das im Keim erstickt und damit Basta
Langsam wird es eng, wir werden älter und nicht jünger
Jeden Tag wird der Kalender etwas dünner
Doch wir wollten nichts verändern, sondern alles sollte bleiben
Wie es ist, wir liefen einfach davon

Meine Ohren tun weh, tausende Feuerwehrsirenen
Ich steh' draußen, zähl' die Autos die geschwind an mir vorbeifahren
Und halte die Momente fest wie Bilder die man einrahmt
Was passiert ist all die Jahre, tragisch nah bei mir
Ließ meine Arme mit 'ner Nadel verzieren
Doch mit dem Alter wird das alles mal an Farbe verlieren

Ja, ich weiß, das ist nur eines der zehn Dinge, die du an mir hasst
Ich trinke Schnaps aus dem Fass, schlaf' am Boden ein
Und kann mit meiner Fahne zwei Nationen vereinen
Manchmal raste ich aus, verliere oft den Verstand
Erst kommt der Hass dann das Loch in der Wand, dann die gebrochene Hand
Die Nachbarn dachten, Mord, Einbruch und Überfall
Da wir morgens um drei uns noch streiten und die Türen zuknallen
Aber Entwarnung, war nur mörderische Wut
Schlimme Wörter, doch es fließt kein Blut, ich finde das gehört dazu
Zu uns beiden wie ist das möglich? Wir machen
Streit aus fröhlichem Lachen und kleine Vögel zu Drachen
Zuhause rauer Seegang, ein Klabautermannpaar
Ich hab das erste Glas aufgebwahrt, das 'ne Frau nach mir warf
Ja, ich hab es mir gemerkt und gelernt aus den Fehlern
Besser schläft man auf Federn als auf 'ner Couch aus braunem Leder

Und doch führ' ich mein Mädchen trotz den Fehlern, die ich habe

Zehn Dinge waren's am Anfang, zwei hab ich im Griff, jetzt sind's Acht
Oft war's ein Drama, Tage des Donners
Der Kontostand am Arsch, keine Bahamas im Sommer
Etwas Sonne und wir könnten uns nicht glücklicher schätzen
Doch Frau Holle über uns schüttelt die Betten
Echt an schneebedeckten Tagen wie diesen
Will Schafen den Schädel einschlagen, begrabe Hasen und Riesen
Und da ist wieder diese Rauchwolke und geht nie weg
Wie traurig, wir besetzen beide Hauptrollen in Breaking Bad
Ich weiß am Ende hast du mich gerettet wie 'nen verletzten Igel
Kein Bedenken, echte Liebe, Kleiderspende, Fetzen fliegen
Lippen geschloßen, draufgebissen. Wie oft
Hast du 'nen Blitz auf mich geschossen wie ein griechischer Gott
Doch es macht jetzt keinen Sinn, wir reden morgen irgendwann
Ich leg mich hin und sag am nächsten Tag good Morning, Vietnam

Ich befürchte ganz egal auf welcher Wolke ich nun schwebe
Wir als Paar führen eine Hollywoodehe

Wir könnten neue Möbel brauchen, wenn wir gestritten haben
Die Vögel hören auf zu zwitschern, jetzt fang' ich erst an
Stell dir die Frage, ob du mich ehrlich noch liebst
Denn du hast jedem unserer Teller nun gelehrt wie man fliegt
Porzellan ist am zerbrechen, was führen ekelhaftes Pärchen
Blanker Horror für die sprechende Teekanne im Märchen
Ich beschwer' mich nicht, ich bin nur ganz offen und sag's
Gott sei Dank ist mein Kopf nicht aus Glas

Bringt mich nicht um, ich hab' mehr Luft als eine Blaskapelle
Zerstarrt im eigenen, im fremden Mercedes
Denn mein Kahn zieh' ich alleine bis zum Ende des Weges
Erstmal den Schädel säubern, ich fang' mein Leben neu an
Endlich Frieden und weit weg von diesen Seelenräubern
Anfangs war's nicht klug von zu Hause wegzuziehen
Aber nun sieht meine Zukunft endlich gut aus in Berlin
Denn verstanden hab' ich nie, warum das alles in die Brüche ging
Warum ich seit zwei Jahren keinen Tag lang mehr nüchtern bin
Ich wünschte ich hätte manches nicht getan, viel Mist gebaut
Ich würd' das nicht mehr machen, aber irgendwie vermisse ich's auch

Im Laufe der Zeit beginnt man Dinge umzuwerfen, umzudenken auch wenn
Tausende Erinnerungen sterben, ich werde manches wegwerfen und
Nachdenken verwirrt mich, ich weiß nicht mehr, was seit letztem März passiert ist

Ich lauf' (ich lauf') ohne zu fragen
Ich lauf' (ich lauf') soweit die Sohlen mich tragen
Ich lauf' (ich lauf') über alte Ruinen
Ich lauf' und falle nicht, ich bin mit allem zufrieden

Ich lauf (ich lauf') ohne zu fragen
Ich lauf (ich lauf') soweit die Sohlen mich tragen
Ich lauf (ich lauf') über alte Ruinen
Ich lauf (ich lauf', ich lauf')

Oft bin ich gefallen, hab' den Halt verloren, blieb liegen
Den Kopf voller Gewalt, ich schoss aus Panzerrohren auf Fliegen

Viel lieber war ich Stargast auf zehntausenden Partynächten
Vergaß all diejenigen die auf mich zuhaus' gewartet hätten
Hab' den ganzen Schmutz aufgesaugt nun schleppe ich
Das dauernd mit mir rum wie einen staubigen Teppich
So perfekt war's vor drei Jahren einfacher kann's nicht gehen
Doch dann musste ich meiner Mum goodbye sagen, Abschied nehmen
Keine Ahnung was los ist ich bin normal
Aber die anderen sind komisch
Denn sowieso bin ich der allerletzte Scheißkerl der winkt
Wenn der letzte Eisberg schmilzt, ein Eisbär ertrinkt
Ich bin dreißig, ein Kind, einfach naiv
Wenn 'ne Seifenblase fliegt für mich reinste Magie
Leider aber lief ich in ein offenes Messer und sah den anderen zu
Beim Spielen durch in ein geschlossenes Fenster

Ich lauf' (ich lauf') ohne zu fragen

Chakuza,"Neue Liebe gefunden, alte im Herzen behalten
Und zufrieden in den Spiegel gucken, erste Falten

Immer etwas suchend, immer graben aber keinen Grund, 
'Nen kleinen Hund anschaffen, Kinder haben bleibt ein Wunsch.

Auf der Flucht quer durch die Wüste auf 'nem Hexenbesen
Trauriger Schluss, Märchenbücher bis zur Hälfte lesen

Seltsames Wesen, keine Regeln, nicht eingliedern, mit sich selber Federball spielen Einsiedler

Die Hand ans Keyboard, Taste drücken, lauter Ton
Die viele Arbeit macht verrückt, aber wird kaum belohnt

Ohne Rauchen stoned, Zauberbogen holen, rauf zum Mond
Hab wohl geträumt, wo kommt der Krach her? Ich bin wach jetzt
Wohnung zwangsgeräumt, alles leer und das Dach weg

Und machtet uns sauer, statt majestätisch fällt man lediglich vom Schachbrett, 
Als Bauer

Mit dem Kopf unter Wasser und niemals aufgetaucht, luftleer
Alles was ich hatte hab ich aufgebraucht, luftleer
Langsam geht der Sauerstoff auf null

Das Glück ist weg, die Würde blieb, man kann's nicht ändern
Gürtel in die Jeans, die damals eng waren
Doch bloß den Eltern nichts erzählen
Man ist zwar älter, doch für sie immer derselbe wie mit 10
Der am Wochenende Oma besucht, der blonde Enkelsohn ohne Tattoos, ohne Blues

Der nicht im Bus fährt, 
Sondern eine Runde um die Erde dreht mit nicht mehr als einem Rutschpferd

Große Bühne doch Gefühle keinen Hunni wert
Lügen schmecken süß wie grüne Gummibären
Düsen ab in die Sahara und nie umgekehrt
Mir gezeigt wie man mein Blut wie alte Suppe in den Gulli leert
In Hotelbetten zu schlafen war gestern, 
Der Schlafsack-Polyester ist angesagt von jetzt an

Abgefahren jetzt werden andere ans Licht treten, 
Kein Platz mehr am Buffet für mich, ich knabbere an Fischgräten

Mit dem Kopf unter Wasser und niemals aufgetaucht, luftleer

Chakuza,"Für viele ist es wie ein riesiges Haus
Man verirrt sich innen drin und findet nie wieder daraus
Schnee im Winter und im Sommer große Hitze, doch kein Strand
Für immer in der Innenstadt im Spinnennetz gefang'
Dann die Gesichter angespannt und kühl
Ist man schwach wird man ganz sicher an den Straßenrand gespült
Und als gäb' es nichts zu lachen hat man manchmal das Gefühl
Auch der Nachbar ist nur der Typ von nebenan – anonym
Die Stadt die keine Berge hat – Berlin
Nur schwere Herzen und entleerte Batterien
Die Beine schwer, man fährt auf Schienen
Hin und her zwischen voneinander weit entfernten Zielen
Und wieder ist ne Schicht vorbei, die Rechnungen beglichen
Die kitschig heile Welt ist einer hässlichen gewichen
In sämtlichen Fenstern brennt noch Licht
Und dahinter erzählen sich fremde Menschen Geschichten

Es ziehen Stürme auf
Mir geht der Treibstoff aus
Kann nicht mehr weiter fliehen
Notlandung auf Berlin

Die Stadt sie fängt mich auf
Sagt mir ich wär' zu Haus
Und manchmal glaub ich's auch
Notlandung auf Berlin

Morgens um fünf herrscht schon Lärm
Keine Beschwerden denn so früh werden die Mülltonnen geleert
Aber das dauert nicht ewig und schon bald wird das erledigt sein
Die Glasscherben weggefegt die Gehwege sind besenrein
Die Stadt die keine Liebe kennt, nur mieses Wetter
Durch all den Wind und Hagel fallen die Ziegel von den Dächern
Es gibt auch in der kleinen Stadt Gewalt aber hier
Schmeißt man auch Briefe an den Weihnachtsmann zum alten Papier
Von hier raus aufs Land man atmet durch, daran zerbricht der Kopf
Man kommt auf Atemluft nicht klar und vermisst den Smog
Lieber spaziert man zwischen hohen Gebäuden
Zwischen unfreundlichen Leuten und den Drogenverseuchten
Man muss warten bis ein Wunder passiert
Und bis dahin auf einem Drahtseil über Schluchten balancieren
Und ich selber hab es endlich mal nach 100 Jahren kapiert
Im Dschungel dieser Großstadt verirrt

Es ziehen Stürme auf
Mir geht der Treibstoff aus
Kann nicht mehr weiter fliehen
Notlandung auf Berlin

Sagt mir ich wär' zu Haus
Und manchmal glaub ich's auch
Notlandung auf Berlin

Ich wache auf,
Alles tut weh
Öffne die Augen
Hab's überlebt
Ein rauer Wind trug mich hierher
Durch dichten Nebel ins Menschen mehr

Für immer Freund und Feind
Liebe und Hass vereint
Will nicht mehr weiter fliehen
Notlandung auf Berlin

Die Stadt sie saugt mich auf
Sagt mir schwer zu Haus
Ich komm hier nicht mehr raus

Chakuza,"Ich war dumm, war ein Idiot und war ein Griesgram
Sogar am Rummel fang' ich Krieg an mit den Dosen am Schießstand
Aber ich großer Sieger oder Held, der ich gern war
Hatte bloß wieder einen rosaroten Teddybären im Arm
Denn weg waren die Kumpels und ich kuschelte mit Bären
Keine Herz die Brust leer, Muschel ohne Perlen
Leute, ehrlich tut mir leid ich machte Worte zu fassen
Hab meine ganzen Freunde mit Kacke beworfen, ich Affe
Aber jetzt wird alles besser, mach es jetzt wieder gut
Meine Verfassung nicht mehr wechselhaft wie Ebbe und Flut
Habe mit dreckigen Schuhen auf vielen Nasen getanzt
Nach Jahren gehen die Wunden Weg, aber die Narben nie ganz
Ich war der Bomber der Herzen, der beste gewesen
Manchen weniger getroffen, doch verletzt habe ich jeden
Aber komm schon lasst uns feiern mit Silvester Raketen
Und wir tun mal einfach so als hätte es gestern nie gegeben

Und wieder zum Anfang
Wir halten den Sand an
Vergessen und ich frage dich
Wo warst du? Was los? Wie geht's dir?
Sag zum ersten Mal „Hallo""

Schluss damit, ausgeträumt, bin immer noch hier
Und darum muss ich endlich aufräumen wie mein Zimmer mit vier
Aber alles ist im grünen Bereich die Zeit der Lügen vorbei
Meine Weste frisch gebügelt und weiß
Da war ein kleines bisschen Sand im Getriebe,
Aber ich bin wieder da und versammle gerade alle die ich liebe
Um mich wieder zu versöhnen und verzeiht mir meinen Größenwahn
Es tut mir so unendlich leid wenn ich mal böse war
Gestern wollte ich jeden auf der Erde verfluchen,
Nun kommt von Herzen alles Gute, Kerzen in den Kuchen
Und ab nun klebe ich es wieder zusammen
Und spiele nie wieder die falsche Melodie auf einem Beat ohne Drums
Schon als Kinder von zuhause weg, wir gaben uns die Hand
Was hätte unser Haus gebrannt, gelaufen und gerannt
Und so wurden wir alt, erhielten dem Ansturm nicht stand
Und niemand hielt die Sanduhren an

Und wieder zum Anfang
Wir halten den Sand an
Vergessen und ich frage dich
Wo warst du? Was los? Wie geht's dir?
Sag zum ersten Mal „Hallo""

Und so geht es nun ist keiner mehr da
Verreist oder gar für immer weg und ich verlier'

Jeden Tag hinterlasse ich den Abdruck meiner Hände im Schnee
Für immer Winter, egal wie man es wendet und dreht
Mein kleiner Planet

Immerzu im Gleichschritt und schon immer war's der gleiche Weg
Ein Cinemaxx 3D-Film als hätten sie nur ein' gedreht
Die selbe Bar, Zigaretten, Rum und schlechter Wein
Wie ätzend doch der Kater ist, identisch zu den letzten dreien
Keine Action drinnen aber draußen da
Wechselt der Himmel mal die Farbe zwischen blau und schwarz
Seit Jahren dem gleichen Penner Kohle in die Dose schmeißen
Und wenn er spart wird's irgendwann mal für 'ne Cola reichen
Alte Achterbahn, ohne Geschrei ohne Hosen scheißen,
Wird sowieso nicht entgleisen
Und zum millionsten Mal, beiß' ich in 'ne Pizza die nicht heiß ist
Oder Chicken-Rice vom Thai in der Midlife-Crisis
Und so steht man täglich in 'ner Riesen-Videothek
Hat nie gewählt aber bekam es in die Wiege gelegt
Ein Siebenschläfer hinter Gitterstäben sein, das wollt ich nie,
Doch sehe ein, dass Wolke sieben hier leider keine Rolle spielt

Doch es ist Winter egal wie man es wendet und dreht
Jeden Tag hinterlasse ich den Abdruck meiner Hände im Schnee
Für immer Winter egal wie man es wendet und dreht
Mein kleiner Planet

Sind das bloß verwelkte Rosen oder Blumenkohl
Die große Welt bloß gefälscht wie die Truman Show
Statt Richtung Himmel fahren, runterfallen
Nur die Hexe macht im Wunderland aus Giftschlangen Zuckerstangen
Es gibt gar keine Engel ein erfundenes Paradies
Ein Lucky Luke der Waffen zieht und schneller als sein Schatten schießt
Ich dachte echt, dass ich das habe von dem jeder träumt
Dann war es weg wie wenn man Salz über 'nen Schneemann streut
Wolken auf denen man wie auf Watte liegt, die gab es nie
Dank Fantasie war sie keine Matratze die nach Katze riecht
Tatsache ich bin ein großer Mann in Jeans,
Doch lasse jedes Jahr Großvater den Osterhasen spielen
Ich schaff es nicht einmal im Traum mich vor dem Leben zu drücken
Tausend mal versucht, geht es zu flüchten
Baute ein gläsernes Haus um mich vor Regen zu schützen
Doch wache jedes Mal auf wenn jemand die Schneekugel schüttelt

Chakuza,"Soundtrack des Lebens, Soundcheck, ich lebe
Pause, ich gehe nicht mehr aufrecht, ich schwebe
Augen auf, ich sehe, es wird jeden Tag schlimmer
Wieder gegen die Wand geprallt, weh getan, immer
Doch wenn es schmerzt, merk' ich wieder, ich bin wach
Mag' ich nicht, streck' mich nieder, bis es kracht
Ziehe durch die Bars, Alkohol die ganze Nacht durch
Rufe zu Hause an, Abholen kommen, Absturz
Soundtrack des Lebens, Soundcheck daneben
Taube Ohren, während die Augen nichts sehen
Will nicht raus, will nicht gehen, lass' mich einen noch kippen
Shit, hab mein Zeitlimit weit überschritten

Letztes Glas, halb leer
Kopf voll, verdammt schwer
Letztes Mal, nie mehr
Doch nächste Woche wieder alles von vorn

Alptraum des Lebens, ich kann kaum noch stehen
Zu wenig Kraft um zum Pfandhaus zu gehen
Der Kühlschrank vereist, nur für Brot wär' ich dankbar
Ich träume nicht von Reisen oder Ozeandampfern
Verwerfe meinen Atlas, werde wütend, zerschlage
Alle meine Bücherregale
Mache alles zu Asche, geh' danach einen saufen
Dann nach Hause, um zu schlafen wie im Ameisenhaufen
Kein Soundtrack, der nett ist, eher Metal
Eher Penner, alte Männer in alten Ledermänteln
Zurück ins Bett, bitte weck' mich nicht auf,
Denn im Traum hab' ich mir selbst einen Tempel erbaut

Letztes Glas, halb leer
Kopf voll, verdammt schwer
Letztes Mal, nie mehr
Doch nächste Woche wieder alles von vorn

Ich hab' mich irgendwo da draußen verloren
Komme nach Hause mit rauschenden Ohren
Denn dieser Soundtrack wird alles wieder gut machen
Augen nicht schließen, wegschauen, zulassen

Da will ich hin, ich baue mir ein Floß
Mach mich auf, segle los
Vergesse zu Hause, ich glaube mein Mädchen braucht Trost
Irgendwo versteckt sich mein besseres ich
Kein zurück, besser ihr vergesst mein Gesicht
Keine Schätze hinterlassen, keiner wird belohnt dafür
Für all die Scheiße, ich geh leise durch die Wohnungstür
Hab ich Flügel, es ist windstill
Schwimm' ich über Wellen, bis dahin wo ich hin will
Renne bis dahin, wo ich hin will, das wird schwer
Immerhin ist es Himmelsrichtung Meer
Wenn nur ein Zug fahren würde
Dann würde ich mir die Flut sparen und Stürme
Der lange Weg wär' ganz kurz mit der U-Bahn

Kapitän auf einem Schiffchen aus Pappmaschee
Segel weit über den Rand eines Baggersees hinaus

Lass mir den Wind um die Ohren wehen
Irgendwo zwischen den Fischen verloren gehen
Die alte Wäsche lass ich Altlasten hängen
Hab nur Tränen an den Wangen, weil das Salzwasser brennt
Es war einsam aber kein schwerer Gang
Ganz alleine übers Eismeer zum Strand
Lange Reise ohne Autos zu zählen
Fast lautlos – nur das Rauschen der See
Ein Leben zwischen Schlangen und Fröschen
Lass mich die Vergangenheit löschen
So tragen mich die Wellen und mein Boot zum Strand

Nein, das ist keins ich ziehe los, ich flüchte
So viel los, so viel komische Gerüchte, alles geht bloß in die Brüche
Hier riecht's nach Koks statt nach Honig und Nüssen wie in Omas Küche
Und schon oft auf dem Weg nach oben dacht' ich „Oh, verflucht

Ungewohnt, dass es mal dunkel, mal hell ist

All das abzuwaschen, war nicht einfach, aber tu es
Ab unter die Dusche, in den Abfluss mit der schwarzen Tusche
Und ich kann mich noch bis heute erinnern

Bittere Tränen, bitterer Schnaps
Keine Schulter da zum anlehnen, ich nehm' nicht mal die von Paps
Alles zig mal verpatzt, aber Stop, Schluss jetzt

Ich hab da so 'nen Knopf da steht On und Off drauf
Ich knack mein Sparschwein, Jippie, Leute, nach vorn geht's
Friede gefunden, wie das Spielzeug in den Cornflakes

Aber halt alles neu bevor das Fass überläuft
Ich werd's ein allerletztes Mal riskieren
Mit aller Kraft um mich schlagen wie ein verletztes Tier
Und so heftig, dass sie später mal Geschichten erzählen
Mein Gesicht vor sich sehen, ich lass das Licht an, wenn ich gehe
Ich bin verschwunden, nicht mehr hier, ich bin weg
Und was am anderen Ende des Tunnels passiert, interessiert mich einen Dreck

Den ganzen Tag am Ackern, eine magische Maschine
Schwache Knie und ein Schweißabdruck in Taschentüchern
Kleingedrucktes führt zu reinem Schmutz, verbrannte Bücher
All das zwischen nicht mehr enden wollenden Tagen
Man sitzt im rollenden Wagen mit einer Bombe im Magen
Voller Passagen und Stories, die dann wohl keiner erfährt
Denn nur von Sorgen zu schreiben ist diese Scheiße nicht wert
Vor dem Ziel noch kurz an's Schienbein getreten
Oder es rieselt mal eben Ziegelsteinregen
Alles aufschreiben, 1000 Zeilen mehr als ein Takt
Sich in jedem Satz ausweinen, aufgeweicht leeres Blatt
Irgendwas geht vor da draußen
Denn vor dem Haus wird pausenlos so laut gebohrt, dass ei'm die Ohren rauschen
Dauernd überfordert, aber so, dass alle Balken sich biegen
Das über'n Haufen Geworfene ist beim alten geblieben

Anstatt Frühling oder Blümchen wartet Hass vor der Tür
So vieles macht mich wütend, doch ich kann nichts dafür
So viele Dinge, die mich stressen ohne Pause

Kleine Dinge
1000 kleine Dinge
Ich steh' noch auf der Klinge, aber glaube ich springe

Stillstand - Man hält den Atem an

Statt einem Spiegelbild den Teufel vor Augen
Und muss nach 1000 Feuertaufen seine Freunde verkaufen
Gebaute Gebäude, gemalte Gemälde, noch mal von vorn'

Und auch so vieles, dass daneben geht, unglaubliche Dramen
Und ich hab' das alles satt, sag' warum sollte ich malen?
Das ist die abgefuckte Wahrheit und kein Comicbuchladen
Das ist kein Rembrandt, hab' wenn dann einen Brand vom Weinbrand
Denn den einen, der für alle einstand, nannten sie Heiland

Lieder voll des Lobes, bitte spiel' mir das vom Tod
Nimm die Mundharmonika und immer wieder wiederhol'n

Denn es reicht nicht einmal zum Punk oder Alleinunterhalter
Und statt 'nem Schluck aus der Minibar, gibt es Spucke im Whiskeyglas
Und statt russischen Eiern, nur Vodka Puschkin aus Eimern

Nicht mehr auf Zitronen beißen, geschweigedenn saure Äpfel
Keine Tropfen aus Pech, die die Augen verätzen

Kann nichts lesen, wie ein Analphabet
Und nicht verstehen, dass sich alles um die Patte dreht - Pappmaché-Planet
Am Rad gedreht, bis es da steht, wo es steh'n soll, alles nicht sinnvoll
Kinderkarussell, aber den ganzen Tag allein sitzen
Tag lang mit dem Arsch parken auf giftigen Pfeilspitzen
Dieselpower Einspritzermodus is' angesagt
Jeder Affe auf dem Globus, der mir irgendwas nachsagt, kann mich mal
Glaub' ich das, was man erzählt? Nein, ne, weil's mir eh am Arsch vorbeigeht
Eklig wie Kotze und der Duft eines Wunderbaums

Als dürfte man nicht trauern
Statt im Jetset zu versauern
Warf ich Würfel gegen Mauern
Um die Ecke, mit zwar netten
Aber Menschen, die mir fremd waren
Echter Fremdscham
Denn mich Penner hält nicht mal das letzte Hemd warm
Seltsam, wie es kam
Erst majestätisch unterwegs
Hat sich gedreht, dann Jahre später
Schwer erledigt und zerlegt

Ab durch die Hintertür, den Wind im Rücken spüren
Er bläßt, den Schlüssel nicht gedreht
Und nicht zurückgelegt, kein Stück bewegt

Doch kaum was davon hingekriegt
Hingelegt und eingeknickt, 'ne Weinschorle vom Pennymarkt
War immer schon ein Trinker und kein Cyborg oder Predator
Selten sah ich mal die eine Seite: Die Gute
Doch nun befrei' ich mich aus einer Zeit, die ich verfluche
Und wenn es sein muss
Werde ich ein kleines Haus aus Karten bauen
Eines ohne Gartenzaun: Charlie Brown

Ich stand hinter dem Schrank
Und da kam die Sonne nicht durch
War nur der Schatten einer Comicfigur
Doch ich habe mich bunt angemalt (bunt angemalt)

'Nen riesen Wagen, ich verzweifle an den Leasingraten
Hört mir nicht zu aber Horton hört ein Hu und so
Find ich ja cool und so
Oder auch nicht ich muss ein schlimmes Wort benutzen
Dieser Horton ist ein Hurensohn!
Dann sieh mich an und sag mir was du da siehst
Einen der 'nen anderen nachmacht der eine Spasti in Jeans
Ich seh 'nen Mann der viele seiner Liebsten gehen lassen musste
Und dann darüber gesungen hat, was eh jeder wusste
Ewig lang gefrustet und mit Rauschmitteln getröstet
Ich gehe davon aus, dass auch das Laufen mich tötet
Doch bis dahin gehe ich den Weg der etwas schwierig werden wird
Doch auf Erden große Fresse bis er stirbt

Manchmal denk ich das hier alles eine Drehscheibe wär
Die sich eine Weile lang dreht, dann stehen bleibt, leer
Dann geht hier nichts mehr, also Flasche leer'n
Dann dreht sie sich mehr

Und sich nicht trauen was zu sagen unter traurigen Gestalten
Und nie jemanden ran lassen, das war's dann für gewöhnlich
Was ich anfasse wird Salz, ich war einmal ein König
Falsche Fassade wie ein achso schönes Pärchen
Ich war einmal ein König, das is' 'n ganz altes Märchen
Ich auch und solange abgetaucht und lautlos
Nach all den Jahren abgefuckt wie ein gebrauchtes Auto
Da hilft es auch nicht Sonntags durch den Park zu wandern
Man kann mit mir quatschen, ich bin ganz woanders
Hab' nichts anderes getan außer zu saufen die Tage
Der Masterplan ist geplatzt, Kaugummiblase
Dann renn' ich rum denn der Ruhestand nutzt mir nix
Ruhelos als hätt' ich hundert Dosen Redbull gekippt
Oder am Rum gelugt
Und dann umgekippt

Wie geht's mir wohl?
Irgendwie bin ich am Arsch, diese Sache mit Tränen und so.
Ich dachte immer, niemand kann die Nuss knacken.
Nun hab ich immer wiederkehrende Vermissungsattacken.
Es ist nicht mehr als ne beschissene Schnitzeljagd
Immer hinter dir herzurennen. Sagt wer bist du denn? Fick dich ma, fuck!
Erst mal die Wand anstarren, manchmal mit Tieren reden.
Bettlaken riechen so, als wärst du grad noch hier gewesen.
Das macht mir eh nichts aus, das kann jeder sagen.
Am Ende des Tages hab ich 'n heftigen Leberschaden.
Jedes Mal wenn etwas Wichtiges richtig ist, dann verliert man es.

Ey, hab was geschrieben, Süße, egal ob's gefällt.
Briefmarke dran und schöne Grüße vom Arsch der Welt.
Endlich mal ich selbst sein, nicht böse sein und verrückt.
Denn bis jetzt hab ich das größte Schwein in mir drin unterdrückt.
Aber es fehlt jemand, der mich im Zaum hält.
Es fehlt ein Baustein, beschädigte Traumwelt.
Nicht nur beschädigt, sondern mehr als zerstört.
Nun bin ich ledig und muss täglich was von Aerosmith hören.
Und hab den ganzen Tag lang nur schnulzigen Schlager im Ohr.
Also war's nur warme Luft, unser Indianer-Ehrenwort.
Und ab nun mach ich was Dummes, etwas Doffes, was Dämliches,
Wie Huf, von nun an laber ich den Blues oder was Ähnliches.

Irgendwie ist das Ganze voll aus dem Ruder gelaufen.
Die Luft ist raus, hab kaum noch Puste um kurz unterzutauchen.
Irgendwie ist es besser wenn unsre Wege sich trennen.
Wir sparen uns das Reden, mach's gut und wir sehen uns, bis denne.

Pause aus Zwang, aber zu Haus verwelkt der Blumengarten.
Ich kann nichts machen, doch ich hasse es
Und meine Hände wachsen auch wie alte Essensreste in den Taschen fest.
Nachts im Wald, am Tag auf Straßen hin und her zu schlendern,
Als wär ich ein schwachsinniges Pferd auf ner Carrera-Rennbahn.
Nachts wird sich gewälzt im Bett, doch sicher nicht beim Liebemachen.
Meine Liebste ist die, die mir zusieht, um sich schief zu lachen.
Die Batterie die wär dann immer in Betrieb.
Mein Herz hat viel mehr Energie als kleine Meerschweinchen auf Speed.
Rausgehen, Trinken, Miete futsch. Austicken, weil mieser Druck.
Auch wieder viel zu viel geschluckt, nach Hause auf den Knien gerutscht.

Was für ein kraftraubender Akt, um für Kaffee Zucker zu holen.
In der Schlange anstehen fühlt sich an wie im Supermarkt zu wohnen, ehrlich.
Ja, aber für mich ist es nie gut gewesen. 
Im Kerzenlicht ein Buch, es ist schon schwer genug die Juice zu lesen.
Husch, husch und auch wenn alles fertig ist nie Ruhe geben.
Als wär ich Merlins Zauberlehrlings verfluchter Besen.
Schaff ich das, trotz Rückenschmerzen, nicht ganz so verrückt zu werden.
Job kündigen und überkopf Matratze von ner Brücke werfen.
Nicht daneben stehen, doch wie ein Kreuzfahrtschiff anlegen, im Bremerhaven.
Sich bei jemand anlehnen und schlafen.

Chakuza,"Ich mag keine Partys, und weiß nicht was damals bei ABBA lief
Aber geht's mir mies, dann tanzt mein Herz wie ein Gabbafreak
Unendliche und nächtelange Tänze zum Sprechgesang
Zu starke Getränke, danach noch Tage im Bett gefangen
Fußballwetten, auf die Falschen gewettet
Weg ist das Geld, bis auf die alten Schuhe, alles verpfändet
Das hat uns allen bloß ein Lächeln gekostet
Unter dreckiger Wäsche, die Dosen aus Blech, von Pepsi verrostet
Und wir hängen ständig am Ostbahnhof, Sonne brennt, doch im Park ist kühl
Wenn der Magen sich meldet, schnell zu McDonalds, ein Sparmenü
Wie üblich kann der Tag erst mal ab Mittags beginnen
Alles andere ergibt keinen Sinn
Ist schon toll, wir haben nichts doch führ'n ein glückliches Leben
Es interessiert uns wahrlich nicht was andere über uns reden
Sich durch die Wüste bewegen, das überlass den Kamelen
Wir laufen lachend durch die Gegend ohne Tage zu zählen

Denn wir hängen einfach so rum
wir hängen einfach so rum
Kein wieso, kein warum

Und auf den Bauplänen steht, dass es so nicht mehr lange bleibt
Was auch immer hier dann hinkommt, es wird ein Friedhof sein
Und unser wunderschönes Leben, passt in fünf kleine Kartons
Doch ohne uns ist das alles hier, nur Glas und Beton

Wir tragen alles in uns was wir haben und sammeln mal hier mal da
Um dann bis zum Abend für 'nen Kasten voll Bier zu sparen
Keiner von uns will vor Regen schutz, unter Dächern wohnen
Leben 'Over The Rainbow', Marusha's Technoversion
Wer hat es denn nicht gemacht? Papa Geld aus der Tasche klau'n
Oder manches mal beim Nachbarn, ein paar Äpfel vom Apfelbaum
Und manchmal gibt es nichts zu lachen, kein bisschen lächeln
Das Picknick kannste vergessen, kein bisschen da um zu essen
Aber alles kein Stress, solang es die Möwen nicht finden
Dann fallen irgendwann für uns auch ein paar Brötchen vom Himmel
Und alles böse verschwindet, die Traurigen trösten sich gegenseitig
Endlich weiß ich auch, wie es ist, wenn das Leben nicht leicht ist
Jeder begreift, dass es dir ma' nicht um die Kohle geht
Denn um Kohle zu scheffeln, ist es für mich sowieso zu spät
So oft mal fröhlich sein, trotz zerflossenem Lebenstraum
Lieber jahrelang mal gar nichts, als auf rostigen Nägeln kau'n

Kein wieso, kein warum

Arme Stadt sitzt jetzt grade in Hemd und Krawatte gezwungen
Stellt sich dem Wecker, bleibt nicht mehr Wach ohne Grund
Auf ihrem schwedischen Sofa, ist jetzt kein Platz mehr für uns

Hart wär das Leben, doch wohnen Zuhause
Geh' doch mal raus und sieh wie's den ander'n geht:
Auch nicht so angenehm
Ist dein Zuhause gar kein Gefängnis
Wo's immer warm ist? selbstverständlich
Endlich, endlich
Jeder erzählt, er liege am Boden
Statt in der echten Welt lieber auf Drogen
Niemand ist froh und genießt, was er hat
Vieles verkackt und wieder nicht satt
Viele verkacken und alle sind ängstlich
Alle sind ängstlich, selbstverständlich
Endlich, endlich
Jeder erzählt, dass alles so schlecht ist
Guck aus dem Fenster, nicht auf'n Teppich
Augen vom Boden und Nase zur Scheibe
Sonne sie blendet, da war vorher keine
Vorhang zur Seite, alles erhellt sich
Auf einmal ist alles so selbstverständlich
Endlich, endlich

Um diesen Stein bis nach oben zu schieben
Brauch' ich 'ne Regenbogenmaschine
Tausch' meine aufgeschobenen Ziele
Gegen 'ne Regenbogenmaschine
Hab' viel gewonn' und verloren beim Spielen
Ich will 'ne Regenbogenmaschine
Wenn nur der Regen von oben nich' fiele
Regenbogenmaschine

Endlich mal wieder Licht
Mal wieder fit
Und keiner mehr traurig
Nichts in mei'm Kopf staut sich
Endlich mal wieder frisch
Aufgewischt und Staub gesaugt
Der Kopf war staubig
Unglaublich, unglaublich

Chakuza,"Solange die Stadt schläft steh' ich vor dem Wecker auf
Schnell das Fenster aufgemacht und raus, ich kletter' die Dächer rauf
Die Zeit ist nur für mich, ich bin zu selten alleine
Und wenn das Große Ganze nervt ist hier die Welt eine kleine
Denn da unten heißt es ackern oder penn' auf 'ner Parkbank
Hier ist mein kurzer Aufenthalt im „Leck mich alles am Arsch“-Land
Was'n Abturn, ich muss wieder nach unten klettern, da alle grade wach werden
Mein Chef, mein Hund und der Bäcker
Hier oben war es unverwässert still und jetzt beginnt wieder ein Tag an dem Jahrhundertstress mich killt
Mich lieber hier oben über 'ne Kante lehn', meterhoch
Oder lieber mit 'nem Bier mir die Kante geben, Gläser hoch

Egal, ob es schneit, es heute kalt ist oder Sturm in Sicht
Wer steht alleine nachts am höchsten Turm der Stadt? Ich
Klare Aussicht, ich halt' mich an den Seil'n der Brücke fest
Genieße es, solang' das Glück mich lässt, dann wieder zurück ins Nest
Auch wenn ich jetzt über die Dächer von Moskau wache
Vergeht mir sicher später das Lächeln, wenn ich die Post aufmache
Es war immer ein verflixter Balance-Akt
Man ist mal unten, mal oben, wenn man dazwischen keine Chance hat
Je kleiner die Chancen sind, desto größer der Traum
Doch ein größerer Höhenrausch, je höher der Baum
Und ich trau' mich auf den höchsten Punkt den's gibt in der Stadt
Bin zufrieden mit dem was ich hab', wenn fliegen nicht klappt

Eine kurze Auszeit nehm' und eine rauchen im Freien
Ich bin hier draußen, meine Kleine sitzt zuhause allein
In den Büros riecht es nach Kaffee, ob die Chefs oder Tippsen

Da ist eine verdammte Lücke

Chakuza,"Ich hab geschrien was ich schreien musste
Geschrieben was ich schreiben musste
Ein Leben geführt
Ein von viel Musik beeinflusstes
Voller Modenschau’n und Krach
Keine Kraft mehr
Denn irgendwann wird die große Donau zum Bach
Zu viel gereist
Zu viel geweint und unzählige Shows
Eine tägliche Soap, ist unser tägliches Brot
Erzählungen vom Tod oder vom wirklichen Leben
Ich sag nur Amen ohne in die Kirche zu gehen
Denn ich habs überlebt mit mehr Glück als Verstand
Und dem verdammten Tattoo auf dem Rücken der Hand
Steh mit dem Rücken zur Wand
Aber das nur um nicht umzufalln'
Und so lass ich den aller letzen Korken der Stunde knalln'

Allein auf weiter Flur
Ich bin mein eigenes Zugpferd
Die Scheiße ist nur, dass wenn ich schreie keiner zuhört
Wie eine Einweihnungsfeier aber du störst
Der Kreis wird bei weitem nicht reichen für'n U-Turn
Rießiges Boot oder sinkendes Floss
Stimme zu tief für nen Engel
Der Himmel zu hoch
Nach außen hin kleiner Bengel, innen drin groß
Doch ich hab immernoch
Nicht vergessen wo ich herkam mit der ?
Die besten zehn Jahre wenn die letzten sechs auch schwer waren
Etwas zuviel Erde im Schubkarren
Als ich von unten aus der Ferne noch den Sternschnuppen zusah
Zuviele Aasgeier die durch die Gegend schwirren
Und ich steh unter einem Wasserfall mit Regenschirm
Ich dachte grenzenlos wäre die Liebe aber das hier ist das letzte Konzert das ich spiele

Was soll ich den erzählen, jap - den Mann im Spiegel gibts nicht
Komm frag mich ob ich Fit bin
Alter, eigentlich Banane
Manchmal fühl ich mich so steif, als hät ich eingegipste Arme
Das mit Reisen klappt nicht so, weil mir die Patte fehlt zum Fliegen
Ich fahr Slalom auf den Skiern, durch den Acker voller Mienen
Und dann steh ich an den Schienen eines stehgelegten Bahnhofs
Alle Flammen sind erstickt, riesiger Drache aber Zahnlos

Und dann lasse ich die Bilder von den Wänden fallen
Mein selbstgemaltes Ende halt
Sprenge das Gebäude ich bin fertig mit den Träumen

In meinem Kopf herrscht des getrampel einer Sambatänzerin
Oder mich richtig hasse, denn es ist ein nicht endender Kampf
Der verdammte Griff zur Flasche und das nicht wegen dem Pfand
Das war mal anders, ich bin tagelang nur traurig, früher nicht
Denn ich hab so viel Mist gebaut, der nicht mehr auszubügeln ist
Und dann taucht es wieder auf, wie in nem Fluss versenkte Leiche
Irgendeiner kommt, bezeichnet dich als Schwuchtel oder Scheiße

Keine Sterne, alles fern, alles Kasernen und alles Grau
Ich fühl´ mich schwer, als wär´ ich Fernfahrer nach tagelangem Stau
Könnt´ ich Traurigkeit verkaufen wär´ ich Multimillionär
Doch ich schieb´ dauernd einen großen Haufen Bullshit hin und her
Ich kann die firlefanz Musik schon nicht mehr hören, doch hör sie trotzdem
Blas mir irgendwann den Kopf weg wie ein Selbstmörder-Maskottchen
Und natürlich such ich Gold, denn nach unendlichen Versuchen
Hängt der Wolf vor meinem Haus rum und ist ständig nur am pusten

Ich verniete hier in diesem Schrank, vor nie versandten Briefen
Und fand immer erst den Frieden wenn die Lieferanten schliefen
Niemals Zeit für die Romanzen, sie verliefen sich im Sand
Denn innen drin sieht´s bei mir aus - wie ein vom Krieg zersägtes Land
Sag mir selbst man bleibt Zuhause, denn den Rest kannste vergessen

Wir haben vergessen, warum wir uns damals so oft geküsst haben
Nun wirkt es so als wären wir nach den ganzen Jahren wieder schüchtern
Wir haben beide unsere Jobs, alles in trockenen Tüchern
Doch ich ertrag das nicht mehr, weder stockbesoffen noch nüchtern
Denn es ist nicht so, dass wir zwei an Problemen nicht genügend hätten
Lief nicht so wie diese Liebesfilme oder -bücher enden
Letztlich hat das alles mit uns beiden nicht sollen sein
So viele Stolpersteine, von der siebten wieder auf Wolke eins

Der Zug ist abgefahren, ich nur 'ne Runde um 'n Block gefahren
Es war doch nicht so unendlich wie wir uns das versprochen haben
Und am Ende ist es so, dass immer bleibt, was immer Hoffnung war
Denn einer von uns fällt wie beim Duell zum ersten Glockenschlag
Ist doch so, dass wir nach dieser Zeit im Stress mal Ruhe brauchen
Da hilft es auch nicht, einfach Eis essen und Schuhe kaufen
Wenn so viel Wasser fließt, bricht irgendwann der Damm
Erst ein Hoch und dann ein Tief, ein ziemlich mieses Diagramm
Dann platzte uns der Kragen, eine traurige Riesenbombe
Der Grund warum ich manchmal nachts die Augen nicht schließen konnte
Das mit uns ging schief und ich bekenne mich schuldig
Denn das Ding mit Ying und Yang ist auch letztendlich nur Bullshit

Und auch in 40 Jahren
Wird es sich anfühlen als wenn's 14 waren

Einsam zu zweit, man sieht die Zeit vorbeiwandern
Irgendwann kracht's, bleibt kein Stein auf dem andern
Das Ganze schmeckt wie ein vergifteter Cocktail
Schmetterlinge weg und nichts außer Kopfweh

Schlaf' ich ein vor dem Fernseher, dann deckst du mich zu
Gott sei dank begreifst nur du wenn ich was peinliches sage

Auf in den Krieg, es hängt der Haussegen schief
Doch nach den Tagen, die von Bomben erschlagenen
Genießen wir die friedlichen Sommerabende
Unsere Geschichte wird man oft noch erzählen
Vom besoffenen Peter und dem Hiroshima Mädchen
Und so gehts, am Anfang gabs die Hoffnung, das wars
Du bist die Frau die mein Auto zu Schrott fahren darf, check
Du machst alles platt, Karre abgefuckt

Hörte nur die Igel über'n Hügel rollen und großen Pferden

Schlaf länger, der Zeiger dreht sich langsamer als Windräder
Fast wie damals, als man noch mit Paps zusammen als Kind gelebt hat
Nein, hier muss ei'm niemand dieses graue Stück Balkon zeigen
Hier baut man sich ein Baumhaus und lässt tausende Ballons steigen

Nie wieder Stress, friedlich, chillig, kein mieses Essen vom China-Imbiss
Lichtermeer, das Business nervt, zu Meetings fährt man widerwillig
Alte Möbel, Riesenvögel, schöne Wiesen, Dielenböden
Und der graue, dunkle Raum wird umgebaut zur Liebeshöhle
Weg von hier ins Nirgendwo

Ich sag' dir was mein Großvater in drei Wörtern beschrieb:
Du bist das, wo du bist, und dass es Einhörner nicht gibt

Regenmantel schnüren, der Calvin Klein bleibt auf dem Kleiderbügel

Keiner nebenan klopft an die Wand; ""Macht nicht so'n Krach da drüben!""
Keine Autos, nein, wo aus dem Schornstein der Rauch aufsteigt
Rushhourverbot, der Sonntagmorgen einer Pause gleicht
So steht man hier, das Abenteuer kann beginnen
Geh heut spazieren, fotografier die Nadelbäume wie die Sphinx
Ein Alltag zwischen schwarzen Katzen, Bienen und Hummeln
Lass in der Großstadt all die brummenden Kaffeemaschinen verstummen
Auf den Zug gesprungen und los, irgendwo hin, so weit die Schienen reichen
Ich genieß' mein Lieblingseis statt Pizza-Slice zu Niedrigpreisen
Ich park den Wagen da, Twingo, kein Jaguar

Gott hat uns Lichter erschaffen, aber noch gar keine Kunst
Aber noch gar keine Kunst
Wir kehrten um, ha'm uns gewehrt aber kassierten noch mehr Schläge
Standen wie die Zwerge in riesigen, leeren Konzertsälen
Verzweifelt, gehofft, man gab uns nur keine Chance
Die Zeit ist uns davongelaufen, ?

Alles bleibt wie es ist
Kein Weg führt zurück
Wenn die Uhr tickt

Alles bleibt wie es ist
Kein Weg führt zurück
Wenn die Uhr tickt

Unsere handersparten Pumas durch die Schuhsohlen latschen
Die erste Show auf dem Schulhof, danach am Fußboden schlafen
Dann war die Bahn davongefahr'n aber egal, ob man den Tag verpennt hat
Damals war'n wir für uns echte Stars vor'm Panoramafenster
Vollkommene Euphorie und was man heute sieht ist was von diesem goldgelockten Teufel blieb
Der Teufel schlief, wir wollten haben was sich jeder wünscht
Was aufs Sparbuch legen und entspannt 'nen schwarzen Tee um 5
? sind die Ränder des Brotes
Denn anscheinend wird man erst wertvolle Legende, wenn man tot ist
Doch wir fürchten wirklich keinen, lasst uns die Zeit in die Länge zieh'n
Und das Glühwürmchen nur einmal so hoch steigen wie'n Zeppelin

Alles bleibt wie es ist
Kein Weg führt zurück
Wenn die Uhr tickt

Alles bleibt wie es ist
Kein Weg führt zurück
Wenn die Uhr tickt

Wir hatten keinen Plan von gar nichts
Für uns klangen die Gitarren besser
Unterhalb der Chartspitze und uralten Garagendächern
Wagten's nicht zu denken doch ham's immer gehofft
Tragen die Rosa Brille oft, weil's mehr Bock macht als die ""Stille Post""
Alles war uns fremd, eine erfolglose Band von vielen
Wollten nie Geld verdienen mit den neugespielten Melodien
Auf einmal hat's gekracht und über Nacht wurde das Ganze real
Die Welt, die uns umgab, so fabelhaft wie die von Amélie

Alles bleibt wie es ist
Kein Weg führt zurück
Wenn die Uhr tickt

Alles bleibt wie es ist
Kein Weg führt zurück
Wenn die Uhr tickt",Vorhang,2016
Chakuza,"Wir waren schon immer nur die zweite Geige spielend
Die dann am Spielende noch streiten an der Seitenlinie
Keiner deiner Lieblingsrapper, die die Kette verlieren
Nur Männer die nach sechzehn Bier die Etiketten verlieren
Wir stehen noch vor den Bullen Schmiere
Haben statt Waffen 'ne Familie oder Tiere, degradierte Offiziere
Und gibt es Streit, kann auch Weihnachten beschissen sein
Auf die Lippen beißen, küssen keinen unterm Mistelzweig
Lange nicht gesehen, ziehen gemeinsam durch die Clubs
Trinken alles, was noch reinkann, bis zum Schluss, es muss
Und wenn alle Städte leer sind, erst dann hören wir auf
Es muss nicht einmal das Meer sein, wir surfen auf der Couch

Und da wir uns nach all den Jahren wiedererkennen
Können wir all die nie geschriebenen Briefe verbrennen
Denn echte Freundschaft ist teuer
Ein Diamant geschliffen durch Wassersturmfeuer

Uns interessiert, Mannschaft gut oder verliert
Und nicht dieses verfluchte Tagebuch eines Vampirs
Fangen an, zu musizieren wie ein Orchester voller Kinder
Wir spielen kein Klavier, es ist besser, nur zu klimpern
Erst Handy an und fragen „Sag, was labern die Idioten da?“
Die alten Geschichten zum abermillionensten Mal
Von all den üblen Zeiten und den lustigen Tagen
Von den harten Prügelei'n und unsern blutigen Nasen
Sieh, die Jahre vergehen, es gibt viel zu erzählen
Es macht Spaß, sich als Riesenbabys wiederzusehen
Sieh ma', denn heute sind wir Rapper oder Ärzte mit bekannten Namen
Und dann machten wir klar, wie man der stärkste in der Bande war

Und da wir uns nach all den Jahren wiedererkennen
Können wir all die nie geschriebenen Briefe verbrennen
Denn echte Freundschaft ist teuer
Ein Diamant geschliffen durch Wassersturmfeuer
Feuer, Wassersturmfeuer

Fotoalbum raus ? vergangenen Nacht durchschauen
Erst die alte, kaputte Vase zusammenbauen
Ach zum Teufel hier hat keiner mal Kunst studiert
Freundschaften, Feindschaften, die alt sind, aber funktionieren
Noch stehen wir hier, aber die kurze Zeit ist immer gut
Mit unseren ausgebleichten schlimmeren Tattoos
Was passiert, ist nur aus Liebe oder blinder Wut
Ist ein in Blindenschrift geschriebenes Kinderbuch",Wassersturmfeuer,2016

So als würd’ ich mich in „Walking Dead“ und „Zombieland“ befinden
Ist kein königlicher Sonntag, denn der Vibe in meinem Bungalow
Ist einfach viel zu dunkel und bedrohlich - leider unheroisch
Schrecklich ist der Morgen für das ungeliebte Stiefkind
Kommt mir vor als würden LKW-Motoren für mich ein Lied singen
Und mein Mädchen wird zum Biest, war vorher Liebling, es gibt Streit
Denn ich beherrsche sie ganz gut, die Kunst der Mittelmäßigkeit

Während für andere der Tag wie ’n Berg aus Baklava schmeckt

Wieder steh’ ich hier, ganz ohne Ziel und ohne Plan
Ticket reserviert für eine stillgelegte Bahn
Ich komme nie ans Ziel, ich hab’ mich hoffnungslos verfahren
Wieder gibt’s nur mich und meinen Koffer unterm Arm

Er ist tatsächlich da, der unendlich lange schwarze Tag
Depris, Trauer, Tränen - eine schreckliche Ménage-à-trois
Und plötzlich fängt eine Kapelle an zu spielen
Man hört Musik durch diese blechernen Lamellen der Jalousien
Wie oft hat mir der Kopf das schon verziehen?
Ich denke oft, ich fiel als Kind in einen Topf voll Aspirin
Die Arme müde und die Hanteln, die sind richtig schwer
Tag der lahmen Ente, nicht verdammt wütender Grizzlybär
Und am Abend ist der Dampfer tief im Meer versunken, dann
Ist wieder alles gut, die mieseste der Sternstunden vergangen

Don't tell me that it's over because I know my heart won't hear
It thinks we'll be together like we've been for all these years
I know this may sound foolish, but you've got to realize

I'd rather be a fool than to say good-bye
I'd rather take my chances that I'll get one more try
I'd rather live a lie than to face the truth
Before I'd love somebody new, I'd rather miss you

I can't imagine life without you
I close my eyes and see your face
You say I'll find another, but who could ever take your place
So I'll keep on believing my love will change your mind

Said if you want to see your brand new daughter you better drop that load

Chalee Tennison,"Down a dirt road down in southern Louisiana
Flew a white Continental with the top laid back
Pretty blond sittin' on a seat of red leather
Dust blowin' out of those well wore tracks
She goin' back

Moss hangin' down like beards in the bayou
Old folks watchin' from a rockin' chair
Ain't no place for a girl of her state
She's gonna ruin her reputation
She don't care 'cause he's waitin' there

She's gonna say

Tell me you think that I'm smart
Tell me anything and I'll believe it
'Cause I'm listening with my heart""

Maybe it's wrong but that's the way it goes
When the only love you get is down
Cheater's road

Bedsprings rubbin' her back through the blanket
Sweat like a tear rollin' down her neck
Watchin' him pullin' down the shades on the window
She'd rather have him than an empty bed
And her self respect

She said a prayer and asked for strength
She put her makeup on just perfect
For the first time in a long time
The mirror showed her grace
She heard him stirring in the kitchen
Last night's whiskey in the air
She could hear him carryin' on and cussin'
Then the woman in the mirror said
You gotta get outta here
'Cause you've been broken down and kicked around
One too many times
You finally found the strength
And he ain't gonna break my faith
She said I might go back to school
I know you take me for a fool
Despite what you say
Something occured to me today
Guess what, I am pretty
He took a drag off his cigarette
That patronizing look on his face
And he said 'Ah, Here we go again
Got that little suitcase in your hand
Let me guess, you're gonna find your dreams today'

I'm gonna get out, I'm gonna get out of this

So I tried to follow it I tried to track you down
Thought I caught wind of it outside of San Antone
But it was just a ghost so I kept right on goin'

I drove an told myself you wouldn't lie to me
Tears of confusion fell and I wiped them on my sleeve
Two tanks of gas and a floorboard full of coffee cups
I finally hit the border and Mexico was all there was

As I crossed that river the sun was settin'
But I started seein' the light
I walk those streets and I talked to myself
And I decided I would be all right
I drank some Tequila
I said, who needs you
I don't have to do this alone
Me and Mexico are lettin' you go

I bought a big sombrero and made me laugh
Funny I don't think we were ever happy like that
Country full of strangers a thousand miles from home
The first time in a long time that I have felt alone

A band of merry archers was playing in the crowd
I couldn't understand the words but singing right out loud
Here is this border town that's where your memory lays
And when I head back home here's where it's gonna stay

With my hands on you I wouldn't be feelin' you
Yeah you platinum, but you whack as hell
I dubbed over your single like a Maxell
You need to
Stop now, get original
Start practicin', master your flow
You might as well, turn in your mic
And start collectin' dollars at the turnpike
'Cause the rhymes you kick, need to be fixed
But you couldn't even fix them
If you ate pebbles, your shit wouldn't rock
You one of them balloons made to go pop

You need to
Stop now, get original
Start practicin', master your flow

Whaaat?
Stop now, get original

There is really nothin' you can do
We about to hit you in your face with my kung-fu
Risky on the microphone, I am
Got the energy of and 
I'm about to let you know the deal on how I feel
Many people can't be real, so they gotta chase the steel
What the deal? Is it really all about the bills?
What's the thrill? I'd rather have my soul fulfilled
You gotta
Stop now, get original
Start practicin', master your flow
We delegate the skills to conversating
The loss of motivation of MC's to create
Sent it in for quick hit, waitin' for the break
You didn't pay your dues, so you got on Ricki Lake
How does it feel to be the man on top
When everything you got ain't any of your props?

[Chorus]
You need to
Stop now, get original
Start practicin', master your flow
Stop now, get original
Stop now, get original
Start practicin', master your flow

When you think about rap in it's entirety
Violence became variety
Silently personalities differ from what they try to be
2na be on the frontline, with rhyme shell I hit you
You're sluggish like a barbituate
We can make you admit you bit
A hectic thrill, connect with will
And we create with the kung-fu collective skill
The checks get real, people think this shit is hunky-dory
It's another story while we be fightin' for re-
Demption pimps and prostitutes get the break they need
With breakneck speed, the fakes succeed indeed
Thinkin' life is a party and it's a must to please
But many pop MC's work for Mephistopheles stop it please
Choppin' broccoli happily for your company
Publically sellin' Satan when really you should be bumpin' the truth
So stop now
Stop now, get original
Just practice and master your flow",Get Original,2000

Oh God (good night).......

My escapades exceed Caddy Escalades
I best behave to the rhythm of justice slaves
Selected brave ah lecture me extra waves
Doggin your sounds causing you clowns just to cave
Address the rage rush the stage just to blaze
Glorify your glamour and gorers just to faze
Cutting down the rainforest for cows just to graze
It's killin the populous while you clone test tube babes
Test the change 'cause of the fantasies they try to feed us
Under the bridge drumming for flea an anthony kiedis
I ran from elitist who got the truth confused
It's the Manphibian and the one Roots Manuva

Oh Lord I feel so sensual And every now and then I get a great sense of wha...
Synchronization of the hip gyration of the old time New Right
Back to Back, Man or no man no matter oh man boy or boy girl or girl
Steppin out of place with the light of the world I'm locked up
Weed grass rushing through my veins slip over the rocky terrain and maintain
Like a weed whore checkin that hydroponic buck
Earth child, come see me rolling in the muck
He there go ever so civilized while I unrobe
No played out to catch wives
Don't wanna get knicks up in their mix up
Wanna just fix up mind soul and mental plane

We have them darks jealous in dark cellas

We spark letters we art sellers
Pleadin the waters the sharks fell us
Be quick with your camcorder In no particular plan order
We go hit like vehicular man slaughter sing

In ding bring a fling of bringin it on
Refuse to get lost in the quest for one

Yo, when music temptations can't be resisted
Fifths will be unconsistent make me a misfit
Listed as a phenomenom I got an oncoming bomb
Which is perfection and flexin like I spent time in Nam
The beat is on and its nice an easy
Instrumentals blendin like cinnamon rice and peas
And lifes a breeze when you don't have to kick it to find 
Contemplate the creation with blackalicious and I
Tuna fish is for a musical infant he's past gone
Tryin to hold fast and grasp hits like last fall
So last long flash on keepin the past strong
we grab songs and rhythm so people can catch on
Yes 
My mic honor cause my momma I twiced promised her 
Love life if music is truly your wife honor her
Burnin to your thermometer stretch a million kilomteres
Connect a population at birth to one another for real

More remore pure sonic over joy sworn for shorts
Unseen aquatic bout to get explored
Warriors breakin all the limits twistin the laws

Now who said that underground is only just one more
I'm sellin time and space and matter makin hula-hoops of saturns rings

And bring my thing and sink to think 
That these was meant to be writ if these spits will ever be writ
We on some destiny (shh shhh) we took a piece of this 
We often testement on every cultural element 
Ever sent to us by the ancestors as though we manifest it
Some new world pedestrians 
just lounging with some fishin poles Up on the moons crescent
Just tryin to make some history spittin on a few records 
I had a dream like martin luther king in adolescense 
And now I'm out in tokyo and europe havin sessions
The final destination used to be my main question
But then I looked and all that I was searchin for was present

Chali 2na,"From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture's there
The memory won't escape me
But why should I care

We're stuck in a place so dark, you could hardly see
A manner of matter that splits with the words I breathe
And as the rain drips acidic questions around me
I block out the sight of the powers that be
Duck away into the darkness, times up
I wind up in a rusted world with eyes shut
So tight that it blurs into the world of pretend
And the eyes ease open and it's dark again

From the top to the bottom 
Bottom to top I stop 
At the core I've forgotten 
In the middle of my thoughts 
Taken far from my safety 
The picture's there 
The memory won't escape me 
But why should I care

In the memory you'll find me 
Eyes burning up 
The darkness holding me tightly 
Until the sun rises up

Listen to the sound, dizzy from the ups and downs
And nauseated by the polluted rock that's all around
Watchin' the wheels of cars that pass
I look past to the last of the light and the long shadows it casts
A window grows and captures the eye
And cries out yellow light as it passes me by
And a young, shadowy figure sits in front of a box
Inside a building of rocks with antennas on top
Now, nothing can stop in this land of the pain
The same lose, not knowing they were part of the game
And while the insides change, the box stays the same
And the figure inside could bear anybody's name
The memories I keep are from a time like then
I put on my paper so I could come back to them
Someday I'm hopin' to close my eyes and pretend
That this crumpled up paper can be perfect again

From the top to the bottom 
Bottom to top I stop 
At the core I've forgotten 
In the middle of my thoughts 
Taken far from my safety 
The picture's there 
The memory won't escape me 

I'm here at the podium talking, the ceremonial offerings
Dedicated to urban dysfunctional offspring
What's happening
City governments are eternally napping
Trapped in greedy covenants, causin' urban collapsing
Bullets that scar souls, with dark holds, get more than your car stole
Some hearts be blacker than charcoal
For real, this society's deprivation depends not on our differences, but the separation within
No preparation is made, limited aid, minimum wage
Livin' in a tenement cage where rent isn't paid
Tragedy within a parade
The darkness overspread like permanent plague
I'm the forgotten

The darkness holding me tightly

Give plaques & charms to writers of wack poems
Divided attacks, tryin' to collapse this platform
In this rap, we detach from any distraction

Yes, sever the head of the evil music(meant to divide & confuse kids) the media spoon-feeds you
People who need you concede to your bluffin'
Parasitic poison unfit for human consumption
Why they focus on one of they crusades

Vatican they paid for they role in the slave trade

Secret political interests hide from view

Flows they close and do stunts 'cause all they want's the wit of your ignorance

And where we had it pathetic where citizens give up their civil liberties
To officers of evil intent & devilish tendencies
While enemies join forces to endorse this mental extortion gone corporate

When will the corporate forfeit morbid acts on the helpless?
Ignoring facts 'til they selfish aristocrats who flex well in the time where sex sells
Their crime rhymes melt kids' minds like soft snails
Either you end up in jail or caught shells

But time blinds, help kids find their thoughts well, for real

To violent images permanent like Yakuza tattoos
They got shoes, relax the underwear

As deep as your pockets and use logic
The words kill before you have time to breathe
What the ears hear & the eyes see, the mind believes

While they hang you from your ankle and they take what falls
Citizens of this planet deserve a wake-up call
He who hides knowledge controls this grand scheme
In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.

To vital organs, forming your brain and tiny heart
The fetus, date of birth; until puberty finally starts
Adolescence, adult, then your elderly body rots
It was divine decree that begun the plan
But is diseased by the greed of the sons of man
Don't try to leave with the guns in hand
Understand: God's the one in command

Did we climb out of the sea?
Where did we come from, you and me?
Two legs to walk, and as you see
I'm not a man I want to be
People growing, my backyard (I'm growing in your backyard)
In my garden, in my heart (I'm in your garden, I'm in your heart)
Pink and purple, red and blue (See all the colors?)
On this sunny afternoon (It's a sunny afternoon)

Back before time was time and space was space
The ever-present eye divine so laced with grace
Decided it was time to try to chase, to chase
But what it would design, now life is taking place
Within itself, divided; now it takes some space
And it can't be found alive, the mind creates the state
Of ego, now what's mine is mine
OK, now hate will reign until the blind have eyes and lay awake in wait

How are the seeds in the ground?
How is my garden growing now?
A tender kiss, a little smile
The way a mother holds its child
Tasty little human beings (Tasty little human beings)
I grow them on the people tree (I grow them on the people tree)
I will eat them one by one (Eat them one by one)

Tell me what the purpose is for creating the earth

Be fruitful and multiply across the planet's back)
Well, why does hate exist?
The war and AIDS and shit?
If we're to be fruitful, why can't poor people pay they rent?
('Cause love and hate, both sides are conjoined
Physical forms have to deal with both sides of the coin)
Why do we die? (So you can live!)
Why do we strive? (So you can win!
But why did you defy every truthful word I recommend?)
My question back, why do you recommend an ode temptationing
(So I can test your patience and tolerance in the face of sin)
But why attest when you hold all the answers to the state we in?
(For you to bear witness of imperfections of mortal men)
So it's a lesson? (And a blessing
Journey back to where you been
'Cause before the tree can flourish seeds must first be planted in)

Straight out the door, I come to give you more
Lay the law keep it raw, when I speak it from the core
Get underneath your skin like especially with the claw
Conflicted with the rich 'cause I kick it with the poor
I laugh in the face of adversity
Sound clashed with the bass 'cause it's natural to me
But if you pay attention to the past you will see
Not long ago you black they'd hang your ass from a tree
Certain things things change, while some stay the same
Some are recluse others are lovers of the game

Chali 2na,"Another war another martyr revered
Passed the fear from their fathers then it’s lasting for years
Bullets don’t discriminate the skin color they pierce
We speak the same language brother love, laughter and tears
Refugees trading death for a prison
While some base a set of opinions on race, sex or religion
Come on, enough day to day stress of just living
Without giving a fuck if they’re hated just cause you’re different
Let’s do it under the name of the love that became lost
Dress it up how you want, we’re cut from the same cloth
Scars of hate, frowns stitched to our faces
Can’t escape the cage we forge, we’ve got bars to break
For those living every bit of the struggle
Given to hustle trying to figure how they fit in the puzzle
Cause right now we’re in pieces and peace is the people as one
Till then we’re treated like we’re speaking in tongues so here we come

I am, you are, we are one
We’re two sides of the same coin, we drink from the sun
We be the left hand, right hand, right man?
But sometimes it seems like we’re speaking in tongues so let me speak on the drum
I am, you are, we are one
We’re two sides of the same coin, we drink from the sun
We be the left hand, right hand, right man?
But sometimes it seems like we’re speaking in tongues so let me speak on the drum

Media is teaching the young, debate about belief in the one
Can make an eight-year soldier fall asleep with a gun
While tax mans hands deep in your funds, raping your ones
Money tight like we tweaking the drums it’s like we speaking in tongues
But no book burnings or church sermons
I surf currents, my words burn like a dirt furnace
Confusion leads and anguish sells
But this music succeeds where even language fails
To convey free honest expression
It’s a problem trying to get people to acknowledge progression
My goal is to leave a lasting iconic impression
Controlling crowds like demonic possession and ain’t no time to invest in
Biting the hand that created the platform
Attaching pseudo patriotic crap to a rap song
Hoods and 2na try to unify the people as one
And yet we’re treated like we’re speaking in tongues so here we come

I am, you are, we are one
We’re two sides of the same coin, we drink from the sun
We be the left hand, right hand, right man?
But sometimes it seems like we’re speaking in tongues so let me speak on the drum
I am, you are, we are one
We’re two sides of the same coin, we drink from the sun
We be the left hand, right hand, right man?
But sometimes it seems like we’re speaking in tongues so let me speak on the drum

I would never
Hate someone for the way they display love for someone else
(And if you do)
The blame comes from the weight of the way that you see yourself
Take some of the weight off your plate by taking the hate away
And then maybe you’ll make your way to start loving yourself
Fear’s a cancer logic is a countermeasure
A property that you can’t count or measure
I got a problem with people who got a problem with
The way that other people wanna live, that’s their prerogative
They’re mad at how you love, where your prayers are going
Their anger’s like a drug, they’re mad at where you from
But fuck a redneck checking if your visa’s valid
They act like pigs and chickens I’m sick of Caesar salad
So we seize the mallet, and we swing on the ignorant
Can’t speak our language? Then we’ll see if you can sing in it
Hoods and 2na try to unify the people as one
And yet we’re treated like we’re speaking in tongues so here we come

I am, you are, we are one
We’re two sides of the same coin, we drink from the sun
We be the left hand, right hand, right man?
But sometimes it seems like we’re speaking in tongues so let me speak on the drum
I am, you are, we are one
We’re two sides of the same coin, we drink from the sun
We be the left hand, right hand, right man?
But sometimes it seems like we’re speaking in tongues so let me speak on the drum

They pick me up just to pull me down
March to different drums, come from all around
It’s like we’re speaking in tongues
It’s like we’re speaking in tongues
They pick me up just to pull me down
March to different drums, come from all around

Chali 2na,"By the skin of my teeth, by the sweat of my brow
I made it through, but you don't know how
When it's a matter of life or death
I'll drag it out so don't hold your breath

Put me in danger and I feel no fear
Take something from me and I'll shed no tears
I'm self contained and I want what I need
You have to work hard just to see me bleed

Oh, laughing in the face of danger
Oh, in this passion of a stranger
Oh, laughing in the face of danger
Oh, in this passion of a stranger
Yeah, I don't need your love
Yeah, I'm gonna spill your blood

Sliding down on a slippery slope
Inside see that there are no ropes

I have to confess that I feel no shame
I'm gonna have fun playing out this game

It's true that the dead men tell no tales
I'll be the judge when you tip the scales
Where's the intelligence that comes with age
I don't need religion or a self-help sage

Oh, in this passion of a stranger
Oh, laughing in the face of danger
Oh, in this passion of a stranger
Yeah, I don't need your love
Yeah, I'm gonna spill your blood

My path is to race against the anger
In the past when I've laughed in the face of danger
I've been asked to embrace a stranger
As I leave into the grass of my sexed-up neighbors

A rash as I race from nations
As I walk a straight path in a wasted nation
See me defend in at worst of places
In an effort to suppress and to test my patience, but

I make immovable objects
Hoping to get them moving in an immovable context
They confess like a thief in the night
For a foundation when they're deep as behind the dog cat fights

You're always trying to sabotage
Dressed in camouflage
Double down the laws trying to burn like a camouflage
Fill a prescription like a doctor
No one led by this fool that thinks we shall prosper

Oh, laughing in the face of danger
Oh, in this passion of a stranger
Oh, laughing in the face of danger

Is to let all our worries

This is how we, do it down South
Platinum and the gold, ice in our mouth
Fo's in place, Chi-Town fades
4's or blades, candy sprayed

Down here we like it big, on that Dirty coast
Big money swanging whips, cause we serve the most
We live by that G code, that's what gangstas do
On the grind stacking chips, with a gangsta crew
Down here sipping lean, that's that purple stuff
Staying thoed getting bucked, playas living it up
Game spitters riding big, is a habit y'all
Everything you dream about, we done had it y'all
We got money yellow hoes, wearing g-string clothes
Sport sweaters in the summer, cause our necks stay froze
Gripping grain having change, hanging low as your belt
If you want to be a man, go and get it yourself
Down here we do it all, break laws and ball
Ghetto stars for the cause, either stand or fall
We live it up cause we love it, playa deal with that
Tite getting it how I live, keep it real with that

Down South, yeah we ride on dubs
Abuse them drugs, and hoes don't get no love
We just some thugs, with ice that glow and glisten
In a six hundred Benz, and the top is missing
Sit back and listen, cause what I'm saying is real
From Houston to Huntsville, boys got ice in grills
We love to chill, and ride on candy paint
Sip on drank, and blow on that stanky dank
Down South, we known as that Dirty Dirty
If you got your money right, I got them birdy birdies
They going for thirty, yeah you heard me clear
And if you didn't know nigga, that's how we do it down here

I mean we can screw it nice and slow
Like Usher, I gotta confession
Call a player when you get this pleasure

[Hook]",Call Me,2009
Chalie Boy,"[Chorus]
She got a caramel round round brown
Make me go crazy when she come around
Baby you's my butta cup
Oh I got a sweet tooth
Baby you's my butta cup
Oh I got a sweet tooth
When she got those skinny jeans ridin' down low
She's my favorite candy gotta let her know
Baby you's my butta cup
Oh I got a sweet tooth
Baby you's my butta cup
Oh I got a sweet tooth

Yeah you crossin' out yo label girl you bustin' all night
Not a top notch top rank or top flight
But it ain't a butta finga' or it ain't a Babe Ruth
Got ya dancin' way loose like you off the gray goose
Caramel dumy's on my mind on the frappachino
Betty Crocker dunkin' Hines taste like rios
Her body so frio colder then Alaska
Break me off slow she gone break me off faster
And you know she broke me off from the south to the north
East to the west baby do it so soft
Got me singin' boy yoy boy yoy
She got that goody gum drop oh boy

[chorus]

Less feelin' taste great that's my thang
Honey buns dum dums coconut cream
Cut her up clean 'cause she sweeter than my swisha
I get a cavity every time I get with her
Shes my cover girl lover girl sweet as amaretto
Lookin' some vicious when she do it in stiletto
Hip hop or heavy metal she workin' that jello
And she love to bring it home and help me count my dinero
She kisses for my lady cadaver
Ain't got a square bear gots me a ryder
Put her on the flier betcha club jump off right
Guarantee she gone keep it bumpin' all night

[Chorus]

Your my top notch lady make the club go crazy
Let me see ya goody goody gum drop
Thicka then a snicka with her body off the liquor
Let me see ya goody goody gum drop
If your sexy and you know it and your not afraid to show it
Let me see ya goody goody gum drop
And get your frame off the chain make 'em say main
Let me see ya goody goody gum drop

[Chorus]",Buttakup [Remix],2011
Chalino,"Navegando en los trenes del sur 
A una indita muy linda encontré 
Que vendía ramilletes de flores 
Recorriendo las vías del tren 

Encantado de aquella morena 
Le compre un ramito para mi 
Y al poner la moneda en sus manos 
A la indita formal dije así 

Hay indita que vendes tus flores 
No le vendas a nadie por dios 
Y al cantar de un hornito de troya 
Tuve toda la mas linda flor 

Pero el tiempo y las olas de vuelta 
A esos rumbos me hicieron partir 
Yo busque en la estación a la indita 
Pero en cambo mi tiempo perdí 

Hasta que una señora ya anciana 
Mis tristezas deseaba saber 
Me entrego un ramillete marchito 
Y me dijo aquí esta su merced 

La que viene a buscar ya esta muerta 
Y al partir este ramo dejo 
Se la entrega al señor pasajero 
Que en mi vida fue mi único amor",El  Navegante,2015
