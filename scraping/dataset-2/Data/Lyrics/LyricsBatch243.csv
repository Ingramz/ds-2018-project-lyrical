Evan Dando,"Reaching out to look inside
I got it wrong again
I try so hard to take your side
Though I know you can't win

You're on your own
You're in the street
Come back home
Repeat

Take a fall or place your bet
It's the same damn thing
Crushing out a cigarette
Crack a fit of gin

[Repeat: x2]
If things go wrong
Admit defeat
If things go well

And we got time to walk around
Drift away on solid ground
And take a plane to some place cold
Or somewhere warm if we get old

Stick to your guns
I find my feet
My legs won't run
Repeat",Repeat,2003
Evan Dando,"Another joke at my expense
I can't believe where the time went
My past became a present tense
It's all blown out for me

A trapped toe underneath my shoe
I stepped aside and let her loose
I stepped aside and let her through
It's all blown out to sea

And the same thing you though hard about
Is the same part I can live without
And the same thing you though hard about
Is the same part I can live without

I can't believe how far I slid
But secretly I'm glad I did
I can't believe how far I slid
I guess I had to see

A broken heart and two black eyes
But you should see the other guy
Forgetting how, forgetting why
It's all blown out to sea

And the same thing you though hard about
Is the same part I can live without
And the same thing you though hard about
Is the same part I can live without",The Same Thing You Thought Hard About Is the Same Part I Can Live Without,2003
Evan Dando,"There are a million things you'll never get to do
You had your way before and where'd it get you to
Waking up on the floor and sleeping in your shoe
Already too much change in the reflecting pool

Whatever part of you that's been calling the shots is fired
Whatever part of you that's been calling the shots is fired

There are a million things you'll never get to do
You had your way before and where'd it get you to
Waking up on the floor, your sleeping in your shoe

Whatever part of you that's been calling the shots is fired",Shots Is Fired,2003
Evan Dando,"Speaking before you figure it out
Not always right but never in doubt
Stepping inside for now
Your mind is read
Fall down dead

Into the dark, out of the room
Out of the way, never too soon
Some of the ground you gain
Lost instead
Fall down dead

Don't listen to me, listen to yourself
Listen to yourself
Don't listen to me or anybody else
Listen to yourself

Some of the things you said
Stop my head
Fall down dead

Fall down dead",Stop My Head,2003
Evan Dando,"Put the other rest of it around itself
Spray with water and restore the health

Let it sleep, still it keeps
Waking up
Waking up

Take a shower and destroy your hell
Put the other rest of it around itself

Let it sleep, still it keeps
Waking up",Waking Up,2003
Evan Dando,"You stayed awake for fourteen days
And then you slept a week
Why do you do this to yourself?
You drank out on the fire escape
Until you couldn't speak
Why do you do this to yourself?

Why do you do this to yourself?
Refusing any kind of help
You're not hurting no one else
But you can't see
Why do you do this to yourself
If you knew just how it felt?
You're not hurting no one else
Cause you can't see

You'll stay up again, I'm sure
I won't be losing sleep

Evan Dando,"On the road of experience, I'm trying to find my own way.
Sometimes I wish that I could fly away.
When I think that I'm moving, suddenly things stand still.
I'm afraid cause I think they always will.
And I'm looking for space and to find out who I am, 
And I'm looking to know and understand.
It's a sweet, sweet dream, sometimes I'm almost there.
Sometimes I fly like an eagle and sometimes I'm deep in despair.

All alone in the universe, sometimes that's how it seems.
I get lost in the sadness and the screams.
Then I look in the center and suddenly everything's clear.
I find myself in the sunshine and my dreams
And I'm looking for space and to find out who I am, 
And I'm looking to know and understand.
It's a sweet, sweet dream, sometimes I'm almost there.
Sometimes I fly like an eagle and sometimes I'm deep in despair.

On the road of experience, join in the living day.
If there's an answer it's just that it's just that way,
When you're looking for space and to find out who you are.
When you're looking to try and reach the stars.
It's a sweet, sweet dream, sometimes I'm almost there.
Sometimes I fly like an eagle and sometimes I'm deep in despair.",Looking for Space,2013
Evan Frankfort,"Oh, let me pull it all back
This runaway train is running out of track
No more tricks in the old trick-sack
The minutes tick by 'til the watch face turns black

I wanna go 
Bang, bang, bang, bang?
I wanna go 
Bang, bang, bang, bang?
I wanna go 
Bang, bang, bang, bang?
I wanna go 
Bang, bang, bang, bang?

On the phone
But you're not at home
And the trees are blown
By the wind
Please let me say,
I had a hard one today
I never could feel ok
Alone

Evan Frankfort,"The trick to happiness is to ignore anything negative you might
Feel about yourself
That people don't really like you that much
That you got fat because you are lonely
Or that your parents are going to die

I like to get my coffee with all the little frothy things on the side
And I like to put in those little sticks

The trick to freedom is to deny your past regrets
Questionable lovers, lies, drunken weekends

I just like to have a lot of energy
My life demands it
Everything's up, all the time
Up, up, up!

[Chorus]
What's the beat? The beat is up, ah!
What's the beat? The beat is up, ah!
What's the beat? The beat is up, ah!
What's the beat? The beat is up, ah!
How high? to the sky!
What's the beat? The beat is up, ah!
What's the beat? The beat is up, ah!
What's the beat? The beat is up, ah!
What's the beat? The beat is up, ah!
How high? to the sky!

People like positive people
Positivity makes good things happen

My husband doesn't let me buy those tabloid magazines
'Cause he says that it makes me fight with him more

Pills that you mix with wine
That your husband and you aren't having sex anymore
That you got married for the money
It's been positively proved that most top 40 hits have a BPM
Of one twenty or more

I definitely like the gin-song
And the ginko bal-boa?

[Chorus]

Sometime you picture yourself getting impaled
On an imaginary spike sticking out from over your bed
When you keep forgetting to call somebody back
But the more time goes by, the less you feel like calling
Because you're embarrassed

'Cause it kind makes you freaky
And you don't want people to think you're freaky
Even though you are kind of freaky
But only in the bedroom
L-O-L

My mom says I'm really hard on my kids
I don't want them growing up thinking
That everything's just going to be handed to them
They're going to have to work their asses off, just like I did!
You know, we get them up at six in the morning
We're like 'come on! get up! get outta bed!'
'It's gonna be a great day C'mon! up, up, up!'

[Chorus]",Beat Is Up,2010
Evan Frankfort,"I was tripping looking at my portfolio
Wondering how I was gonna make enough dough y'know
Called up a friend who wrote for One Tree Hill and Jericho
He had a job for me, and check it, with a four-letter company

Get it on
Get it on

Hey, I got a proposition for ya
How 'bout you let me keep my profits as a scorer
Record sales are shrinking, I'm gettin' poorer
I got a kid to feed, how about you cut a deal with me

Ha! Hey look, Liz we see you as a commodity
We've been with you since Day One and that's an oddity

And after a series of phone calls
To the great publishing houses of Ursa Minor,
I reached my representative, who pulled out the contract
From the File Cabinet
On microfiche
In the form of Tablets
Made of stone
Then he said

Let me see, it's here in my folder
Oh shit, you're twenty years older
Still hot, but getting a lot colder
And you wanna cut a what with me

Let me tell you how it's done here in the Hollywood

Evan Frankfort,"Well, I've been in this garden of Eden a long time
And I've never seen Adam do anything I understand
When I see you gunning for me double four time
Then I probably haven't been doing the best that I can

And you wonder if I know what we had
Well, I'm sorry that you have to remember
But don't be sad
Because I've been happy too
Yes, I have
I wanna spend my life with you

They've got you in ropes and they're prodding you all night

Tell me you don't long for the good times

Gonna drive that honey down the road for a while

Could've been something in between

You're pushing daisies straight up to the sky

You got a lot more money and my bitch got style
Gonna tap that honey and they come for miles
To take me on the road
Gonna lose my self-control

That your beauty lies inside

But it's nice to take a detour sometimes
You drove me out in your rented car, we didn't have to go too far
To look back on the city lights

But other things, they change

You've got the world at your feet, with everything you need
Tell me, are you satisfied?
It all comes easily to you, with everything you do

I came, I saw, I kicked its ass
I walked away, and I never looked back
I remember you, when you held my hair
As I puked, oh, everywhere

It never takes too long.

You hold me without touch.
You keep me without chains.
I never wanted anything so much than to drown in your love and not feel your rain.

Set me free, leave me be. I don't want to fall another moment into your gravity.
Here I am and I stand so tall, just the way I'm supposed to be.

When I thought that I was strong.
But you touch me for a little while and all my fragile strength is gone.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,

Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?",Over the Rainbow,1990

Evan Marshall,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed

You need love
Give me love
And I'll give you my love

They say thirty is the new twenty
And twenty is the new thirty shit I guess
Makes sense, cause fifteen year olds seem twenty
And twenty five year olds seem ten
I used to drink away my paycheck
Celebrate the mistakes I hadn't made yet
Our generation isn't the best on safe sex
We forget the latex, becoming Planned Parenthood patients
Synthetic heroin is the new basshead
So much to escape, fuck a straight edge
Walk around looking through a fake lens
Apps this good, whose got time to make friends?
I wish I didn't care
Acynical hispters with long hair
Cocaine problems, like my music
It's not my issue, I can't solve it

My flight has finally landed down
And the ground has stopped moving all around
Eyes open, awake for the very first time
We both forfeit this game of crime

They say it's so refreshing to hear somebody on records
No guns, no drugs, no sex, just truth
The guns that's America, the drugs are what they gave to us
And sex sells itself, don't judge her 'til it's you
Ah, I'm not more or less cautious
The rappers rappin' 'bout them strippers up on the pole, copping
These interviews are obnoxious
Saying that it's poetry is so well spoken, stop it
I grew up during Reaganomics
When Ice T was out there on his killing cops shit
Or Rodney King was getting beat on
And they let off every single officer
And Los Angeles went and lost it
Now every month there is a new Rodney on Youtube
It's just something our generation is used to
And neighbourhoods where you never see a news crew
Unless they're gentrifying, white people don't even cruise through
And my subconscious telling me stop it
This is an issue that you shouldn't get involved in
Don't even tweet, R.I.P Trayvon Martin
Don't wanna be that white dude, million man marchin'
Fighting for our freedom that my people stole
Don't wanna make all my white fans uncomfortable
But you don't even have a fuckin' song for radio
Why you out here talkin race, tryin' to save the fuckin' globe
Don't get involved with the causes in mind
White privilege, white guilt, at the same damn time
So we just party like it's nineteen ninty nine
Celebrate the ignorance while these kids keep dying

My flight has finally landed down
And the ground has stopped moving all around
Eyes open, awake for the very first time
We both forfeit this game of crime

Evan Saucedo,"Chimps are going ape, giraffes remain above it all
Elephants remember, though just what I can't recall
Crocodiles are snapping up fresh offers from the banks
Showed interest in my nest egg but I quickly said ""no thanks!""
We haven't paid the hornbills and the vultures have a hunch
Not everyone invited will be coming back from lunch

Every grunt, roar, and snort
Not a tale I distort

The buffalo have got a beef
About this season's grass
Warthogs have been thwarted
In attempts to save their gas
Flamingoes in the pink and
Chasing secretary birds
Saffron is this season's color
Seen in all the herds
Moving down the rank and file
To near the bottom rung
Far too many beetles are
Quite frankly in the dung
Aak!

Fill me with flaming desire
Setting my being completely on fire
You and the night and the music
Thrill me but will we be one
After the night and the music are done

Until the pale light of dawn and in daylight
Hearts will be throbbing guitars
Morning will come without warning and take away the stars
If we must live for the moment
Love 'til the moment is through
After the night and the music die
Will I have you?

Evan Stover,"The sun is sinking low in the sky above Ashokan
The pines and the willows know soon we will part
There's a whisper in the wind of promises unspoken
And a love that will always remain in my heart

My thoughts will return to the sound of your laughter
The magic of moving as one
And a time we'll remember long ever after
The moonlight and music and dancing are done

Will we climb the hills once more?
Will we walk the woods together?
Will I feel you holding me close once again?
Will every song we've sung stay with us forever?
Will you dance in my dreams or my arms until then?

Under the moon the mountains lie sleeping
Over the lake the stars shine
They wonder if you and I will be keeping
The magic and music, or leave them behind",Ashokan Farewell,1990
Evan Stults,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Evan Stults,"I've been holding back my rhyme to long,
Let it go and unleash the fury of my old school flow.
I'm no superstar more like a John Doe.
But I'm badder then the water down in Mexico.
Oh no, a rock n' roller man who's not allowed to be rap.
But I write what I like and I like the boom bap.
The rhyme's in the front and the beat's in the back
A trunk full of funk and a page full of fact.

Right about now I'd like to hear everyone say.
Yes o yes we shall overcome.
My fans got a job,
Are we gonna get it done?
Yes o yes we shall overcome.

I can't be shy I've gotta come with it.
No fear here! I Sing and bring it.
In Christ you've got no right livin' timid.
He's light in the dark and hope for the wicked.
There's a land of the dead called planet earth
And a race called man walks dead from birth
And the beast and man both bear the curse.
Come from the womb but retrun to dirt.

Right about now I'd like to hear everyone say.
Yes o yes we shall overcome.
My fans got a job, are we gonna get it done?
Yes o yes we shall over come.

Here's what I do I hope I get through.
So cling to what's true and tell the world too.
Cause some live in fear, oppression from peers.
These kids smoke weed, these kids that drink beers
Who don't want to hear what you got to say
And they shut their ears and laugh cause you pray,
But don't be afraid, that used to be me I used to mock God
But I was empty.

Right about now I'd like to hear everyone say.
Yes o yes we shall over come.

With a corncob pipe and a button nose

Is a fairytale they say
He was made of snow
But the children know
How he came to life one day
There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Was alive as he could be 
And the children say 
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

And we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away
Down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler stop

Broke! Inside",Erase My Scars,2010
Evans Bradshaw,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Everywhere
Everywhere
Everywhere",A Foggy Day,1959
Evans Bradshaw,"""Clang, clang, clang"" went the trolley
""Ding, ding, ding"" went the bell
""Zing, zing, zing"" went my heartstrings
For the moment I saw him I fell
 
""Chug, chug, chug"" went the motor
""Bump, bump, bump"" went the brake
""Thump, thump, thump"" went my heartstrings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Buzz, buzz, buzz"" went the buzzer
""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels
""Stop, stop, stop"" went my heartstrings
As he started to leave I took hold of his sleeve with my hand

And as if it were planned
He stayed on with me and it was grand
Just to stand with his hand holding mine
All the way to the end of the line",The Trolley Song,1959

I warn you it's gonna get you and your guys killed
With my skills stay on your toes like high heels
And handle bars like bikes 'bout to blow like innertubes

See me in the tube in the views to interludes
Never see me in the nude, Blade gon' bend the rules
Lock the street coming through with more rocks than Pete
I'm into jewels I will not repeat
Y'all obsolete, Sonya Blade y'all
It's murder when they drop the beat

I spit it once, I'm hungry spit at lunch
One take, I hate boxes so I don't punch
I got a hunch, y'all figure, y'all gon' stop my figgas
Get on some rah-rah with Eve and Rah Digga

How they gonna stop us Digga?
Tryna shine, the rest of them bitches
Is past tense and out of time
'Cause my time line consists of many dreams shattered
Trying to run up with two ryders deep as if it mattered

When real bitches get to rockin', heads knockin'
All dem chickens in their coupe gon do is get to squawkin'
All the hating do is feed my temper, let me live
Ice grillin' eyein' my clothes, I'm eyein' the crib
E V E spell it out when you speak about her
The only one out the bunch to hate
The rest gon' crowd around her

Majority rules, it's our time, back the fuck up
'Cause the shit you sayin' out your mouth
Make me crack the fuck up
Laugh hard 'cause we pass y'all so dash broad
Lay my shit by myself in the booth
While y'all need flash cards

Put it down for the bitches all across the map
All the real live bitches all across the map
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead

Yeah, check it out now, like that y'all
Watch me sink three points
Smash your whole LP with just my lead joint
It's the rhyme super bitch gon' stay forever wildin'
Smooth with the pen, Shakespeare, Edgar Allen
Hot chick, catastrophic, blast the hot shit

Your whole verse whack and bare no facts or logic
Smash your clique in, y'all niggas only heard tidbits
I put that on Gabana every rhyme I done spitted
One two, one two, your whole crew I dismantle
Rock fly gear and stay clear of sex scandals
With drogues to spark wait for shows to start

My put my niggas down if they know their parts
Caramel give 'em hell from Bricks to Anadel
Rappers tryna compete get ate like Samuel
By a sister who twist a few L's rip it dually
The song say It Ain't My Fault like Mystikal

Who thought we'd see the day when we'd put our feet up
Lay back, exhale, put the heat up
No stress, no scale, no jail could keep us
Only case we catching now would be a misdemeanor
Remember we used to hustle thinking life would cheat us
Not knowing if we struggled life would treat us
Think on how mommy carried us
Where life gon lead us
Knowing if we getting married
Our wife will need us
If at one time you could look into my mind
When I close my eyes and remember them times
No gas, had a hot plate heat our dinners
No cash, most nights ate sleep for dinner
Welfare and white landlord, that life ain't easy
The only ones moving up was George and Weezy
All my sugar water babies who live in autos, it's crazy
Keep it in the dark, I'm-a speak it from the heart

You never thought they would get harmed
Only time our block got wet was when the sprinklers were on
Think about that time dawg that wasn't long
Now that we got kids think when we was born
Coming up in my hood was hard
Every day my mom cooked with lard
Fucked up I couldn't feed myself
Living life no means of wealth
Eating shit I can't believe myself
That's not a joke
Man I was dealt these cards and I played dem out
Yeah the road was rough but I made a route
Now picture running extension cords from your neighbor's house
To get lights, fuck Max on the latest routes
Used to close my eyes try to fade it out

Trust me, them days is over

Let you sit on my shoulders
Them times when you messed up

But I stayed and you played the right way in your place
And I prayed everytime you was away you'd see my face
But the me was you, and your
Pain was mine, and the
Same situation playing over in my mind

Ain't tryna hear you
Just tryna hear me
Don't wanna hear nothing, baby it's selfishly
I blaming you for the hurt in me, but it's not your fault that
I'm so incomplete

I seem to ruin
Got this funny way of falling in love

Effecting how I'm eating

And I can't take no more
I'm looking for the problem
Standing over the seek
One thing I found, I had to take a look in mirror
See I can't leave you, until I learn to leave me

What was I thinking
That you could talk to me like that
You was holding me down, but I was holding me back
Looking inside myself, and has to see who I am, cause this is my trial, affecting my smile
I'm gotta walk (?), this is gonna be a while

All them times I ran away
You see, really I was running for me
I know constantly we're trying, we was living in a lie
Finally looked into mirror to see

Lot of beams to make your stock drop, right on the seams
Nigga here is too hot and too much for you to touch
Better tell your man cause I'm too tough 
Indubitably, too dust
Do you bust?  Cause we do
You need to ask the people, but quietly
But they don't believe until they leave violently 
Is you buying this?

Who you know besides 'Kiss take the piss in the bottle of Crist'
and then give it to a modelin bitch 
And you like your watch plain, I'ma flood mine
Alligator bloodline trained to find coke and bite one time

Y'all niggaz ain't hearin me out, til I pop up 
appear in your house, clearin it out, holiday style
Everybody actin violent and wild 
Snatch the wife silence the child, that's how we move
Kill me my man kill you, that's how you lose

Ain't to many mother fuckers bad as me
Bust at a nigga wit' a rhyme
Or a nine wit' a tragedy

When it cause catastrophes, will actually 'cause you to bleed
Fuck up anything you breathe, pass the weed
If a nigga proceed to step outta line, I'm a gradually
Fill his anatomy wit' bullet holes in his behind

I happen to be the type of bitch
Get a grudge I don't budge and shit
And look at what I did in life as a kid
Wit' thugs and pents

Now I got the knowledge of a college mother fucker
Wit' a scholarship
At any degree my temperature get, boiling hot to freezing
When I release, you can see the reason, I'm so cold

Niggas continuously rolling me beats to choke on
Tryna get a smoke on
High, 'cause I have to get it
When you can never see me coming the Devil's Advocate

Material hoe, keeping niggas dropping they draws
And fiending for more
Surrounded wit', diamonds around the wrist
Cruise the town in my six, bruising them every time I hit

And I ain't tryna quit
If I do, you can never find another to fill my shoes
I prove you can't duplicate this
Attempt to and lose

This little nigga been rocking the basement since I was about two
Pick up the pace quick, why worry about a replacement?
When I stepped in came wit' my feet in the pavement
Leave niggas in amazement

And guess what the ingravement say?

Matter of fact, take your clothes off, I like it when they're bare 
Everything from iceberg to silk Dolce underwear, come on 

[Chorus]
Hey yo check that nigga cause we on that shit 
Get out your ride fool cause we on that shit 
Hid your stash box cause we on that shit 
Run that ice cause we on that shit 
Keep a loaded clip cause we on that shit 
Ryde or die nigga cause we on that shit 
We out to get it all cause we on that shit 
And Eve don't play cause she takes no shit 

[Eve] 
Uh, yo, yo, yo 
I shoot backing out, P max them out 
And the only way I don't get shit is if you stash the house 
Professional bitches, destined for riches and precious jewels 
Distracted by the size of my ass, had you fooled 
I ain't getting' nada, forget that 
Just sit back and watch me take everything even you're drough sack 
Yeah my bitch can roll with, 
Expensive paintings on your wall, gimme that 
Ain't no slacking, time ain't a factor 
I'ma get it all 
Used to ball with your niggas 
Now I'm making you crawl across the floor 
Ego crushed and I don't give a fuck 
Small change to the range, heard what I said 
Give it up 
I know it ain't right, but me and my bitches gotta eat tonight 
And every night from now on, get it right 
Why, why ask why? 
I'm simply living and I get what I want 
By simply taking or you're simply giving 

[Chorus]

[Eve] 
y'all niggas faggottish 
Cops spot me got me running out my kiss 
Unlatch the ice pieces on my neck and wrist 
Screeching in the streets from the five series to a ditch 
I'm fast, he'd have to waste it and I ain't scared to blast 
Ducking, jumping over shit, bet this bitch could last 
Ready for war, act like I ain't done this shit before 
Practice on me next week, I'll be wanting more 
Best believe you ain't gonna live to see tomorrow 
My dogs already warned your mother 
She'll be full of sorrow 
Busting through the door, somebody's house, kids screaming 
I ain't gonna front somehow I wish that I was sleeping, dreaming 
Too late it's done now, all you hear is gun sounds 
Cock back, pop, pop, pop, and I'm like what now 
Ghetto bird on me, weaving through the trees 
Last fence I hopped over, fell and landed on my knees 
Barrels at my temple, hey yo fuck it I'ma make it simple

Brick house stallion, think you tamin' me right?
Not this baby Del-Philly streets they raisin' her right
Keep it pretty or can make it gritty be a lady
Need boots, pocket books and a baby 380
But prefer to keep it calm and cool
When I'm heated I suggest you move
Just avoid a bad situation, what you got to prove?

Leave her be, chicken squakin' hatin' frequently
Mad they man is obsessed and stalkin' me
If he icy enough, I'm pricin' his stuff
Be nicy enough to let him spend, I'm callin' ya bluff

Snatched up the illest viscous pitbull in a skirt

Stoppin' your shine, and I do it to perfection
Made a promise everytime I touch the mic to bless 'em
Used to tease me how I keep is greasy just to test 'em

Shorty-bang hear the niggaz singin', shoutin' my name
Make the thuggish niggaz scream, watchin' me entertain
Dicks brick when I lick the lips, just keepin' it plain
Fantasizin' 'bout this bitch, got 'em goin' insane
Ooh's and ahh's, 5'7"" thick in the thighs

Cheater, that be you check your beeper 9-1-1
Never Eve stressin' for your lovin'
I don't want none
Peep her, two seater
Look at you nigga actin' like you need her
You run blocks with your henney on the rocks
You don't think I see you wiling, thirsty nigga want the cock, uh
Let you live for a minute 'fore I slide off
Get you mad, holla no smokey ride off
Stressing me, you ain't blessing me
With your 96 Rolley glistening and impressing me
Hear me though, want a job need a resume, ready though
Cause my time is like Presume
You got petty dough and I'm here to let you know
My time is priceless, so if you iceless, baby girl gotta go

[Chorus Missy: x2]
Ain't got no dough

Niggas like 'em flashy drive a F50
Jets I go, go-tee y'all blow, H-why-dro
Keep 'em leaning the club
Hoochies screaming y'all don't know
Many bitches follow me
Daddy licking out your tongue, want to swallow me
Want to pile me, never put no smile on me
Better stop that
Want to see me beggin' for your chips
Bet I doubt that
What ya looking at huh?
Still speakin' to me think you pushin' it huh?
Know you pussy cat run
Cause this bitch is gonna bite
I don't light fire
Grab it, choke it, hold it down
Ride it ruff ryde
I can give you what you need
Or give you what you like
But the pay is kind of the low
So this pussy pawn stride
Wishin' you could touch me, lust me
Listen up daddy you ain't ready for the bed
Try-na to give it up

Yo, yo

Y'all keep watching
Play the back baby while your team keep flockin'
Try-na to touch my ass
You ain't got the strength to mount this stallion, I pass
Whiling out I dash
To that type of thug that's about they business
Piling out that cash
Long line of credit cause I like my thug to last
See they like it when I talk back
Dough stack, cut backs, we don't want that
Frontin' but you flaunt that
Somethin' whatcha want black
Cheap stack, keep that
Fake money nigga, fake thug
We don't need that
What's that all about
I can see you from a mile running at the mouth
Lies poppin' out
Claimin' you's a hustlin' type of nigga, cut it out
You's an average type of cat
No money, no clout

If your bitch is ugly you don't need her
Feed her to a wild pack of cheetas

Now for every real dog
There's that bitch that's behind him
That bitch that when that nigga get to missin'
She gon' find him
Old girl gonna stand with the dog
Hand in hand with the dog
And whatever the fuck went down she ran with the dog
First time I had a match and didn't scratch
You catch just loss half you niggas, but the punk can fetch
And I know my baby girl is gonna stretch
Any rappin' motherfucker, male or female
Place your bets
You can imagine what the bloodline is like
Since I love mine to fight
I'm on some shit like what time tonight
y'all niggas can't be for real
Cause any one of you fagots
Will catch a face full of lead
Bitch you shouldn't be fagots
Fuckin' maggots, once you have it, as good as I got it
I know my hands is in my pockets
But Eve got you spotted, red dotted
Eve didn't before the Dog
Nothin' but a walk in the park

[Eve]
Always been the bitch that could roll with a thug and
Wipe up the blood
Roll in the mud with your other ducks nigga what?
What you need when the chips is down
I'll abide on the stand when evidence is found
I give pound to ya niggas they respect this bitch
I spit rounds at your enemy no less than six
Always keep the extra clip Dog taught me well
The extra eyes on your team I see who's next to fail
Always hold your back up, I pick it up when you slack up
And if attention gets to close I tell the world to back up
Bind too tight, rhymes who ride?
Bitch and you livin' nigga lessons through life
Fuckin' with the dog he's the master
Plus he's gonna show me how to blast ya
Bullets hit you then pass you
Split you then stash you

Get em girl, ha-ha, that's my baby
I'mma put the bitch down, cause the boy got rabies
All my pups is crazy, cause off the leash
They can eat, stand a match for 3 hours at least
And if the beast is in the big one
The beast is in the little ones
Talkin' 'bout let's hit him son
Fuckin' with the little guns

What more do you want?
For your fans you can front
But the dog is on the hunt

You know I'm at the door point fox rippin' 'em out
And you're the only one that can tame me
When I'm flipping 'em out
Bite's lethal, no recovering
I spits no other than acid
Up against the top contenders
None of them lasted
This bitch goin' always hold you down
Keep the cowards thinking twice
I keeps it gritty nigga
Never think that love is life
Turnin' my back is something cats would do
I never take flight
Cause any breed he put's me up against
This bitch is gonna bite

[Eve]
Yo, Yo, this nigga lookin' like love, no doubt
Sophisticated thug keep me guessin'
Said it would be a blessin' just to watch you undressin'
Callin' you daddy, late nights I'm layin' on your chest
And, stay reminiscin' bout the rest
And, how they less than, trying to come between what we share
Can't compare, could have been left
But when it's mine, I never share, fight to the death
If need be to prove that, wounds from your war
Other bitches couldn't soothe that, broke from a bad back
I'm holdin' you down, throwin' dirt with other bitches
But them other fishes drown, locked in, for however long
I'm playin' it smart, court dates in other cities
There I'm playinÃ¢?T my part, wif-ey, in ya life see
Forever be us, passenger side of a Bentley
Or the number 2 bus, tell the whole world, papi
EVE don't want nobody else, with other niggas pick and choose
But you, I'm keepin' for myself

[Chorus: x2]

All my peoples thinkin' I'm delirious
But the love I feel is serious
Couples of the world, no comparing us
Been through fist fights with niggas when I see it escalate
I'm the getaway driver so my nigga can escape
Pull my ice for the bail, spending nights in jail
Drawing hearts on the wall with our names around the cell
It made a little craziness, maybe I'm blind
But for me to leave now lookin' for love would take a lifetime
So I'm keepin' mine, uh-huh, fuck it keep me blind
Feels like heaven when we makin' love, controllin' my spine
Wine and dine, I don't need that as long as long as you wit me
And you bitches thinkin' that you competition, come and get me
My position is held, some try and all fail
Pussy piece a motherfucker, uh-huh, good enough to sell
Never leave his baby girl, mad 'cause he claim me
Only thug in the hood that was wild enough to tame me

[Chorus: x2]

I'm the bitch he'll never leave, helped him build his luxuries
Carry stories that can hurt him, still he only trustin' me
Secrets never leave my mouth, even if they torture me
Always taught to hold the ground, that's why I'll always be his queen
It's some thug shit things see him in the party, start to flip
(What the fuck?)
Curse him out on the regular just to make him sick
Disappear for a day or two to test his loyal ground
Keep my dogs on a short leash, controllin' the growl
Open wide, I don't give a fuck, I'm swallowing my pride
And he fast to blast a cat that he think be on the prowl
But I'll never let him go, temper flare, let it go
Always be his extra back bone, quick to let a nigga know
Always by his side, EVE the apple in his eye
Us together ain't no stopping snatchin' pieces of the pie
Us together in our own world, what's his becomes mine
Exceed eternity with him we'll stand the test of time

My story

Went from dancing on tabletops to making labels pop
For the love of the money so I could cock everything from icy rings to drop
Tops and now I'm on top
But to look back on my reality happy I stopped
Letting niggas ruin my world impressed by niggas trying to school this baby
Girl I was fucking too early
15 knowing money was green
Puffing too early, body big, not grown knowledge'd up and too early
Thought it was cute to flirt with older kats up in they face
Didn't have a daddy so I put a daddy in his face
My mami was my shelter but I broke free
Learning that the streets was harder that I thought they'd be
Wanting to be grown, rebelling
Ain't no telling what I'd be pussy selling (huh) never would I
Instead I wore a g-string
Thought never could I
Thought I had to, to be grown beginning of my life

[Chorus]

Yo, close myself down
Held myself in
Explode by myself alone no one helping
What am I to do but cry alone at night
No one in the house nude TV is my life
Who was I to tell and what would they think of me
No one understood the pain that was sent to me
Broke down from the things men would say to me
Selling drinks to a naive kid
I blame me
But I never really had someone tell me what to do
Teach me that I'm better than just pussy that's true
Teach me that the future was written already waiting to respect my self in
Life not to be someone would hate me
Do positive and positive will happen
Stay positive and positive was rapping
It was like my brain was clouded with unnecessary shit
But I chose to see through the negative and make hits uh

[Chorus]

Uh, uh, yo, yo
Now I'm 20 years old and look where I'm at
I thank the Lord every night and pray there's no turning back
I wanna keep my family happy and that's that
Seen tears in my mother's eyes from platinum plaques
See things I've done I don't regret I just learn
From mistakes in the past knowing now I had to earn respect and earn trust
Survival school was never giving
The way you find out what life's about is simply living to be strong
Stay strong let nobody crush you your body is your temple young girls
Don't let him touch you
He'll respect anything you say if he really loves you
Don't settle for second let him put no one above you
I did a lot of things in my life
I take back gotta take from the good and the bad collect that
Cause it help the bill who you see now respect that
Young, black, and strong keep me in ya

Eve,"Hey, yo I don't even know you and I hate you
See all I know is that my girlfriend used to date you
How would you feel if she held you down and raped you?
Tried and tried, but she never could escape you

She was in love and I'd ask her how? I mean why?
What kind of love from a n**** would black your eye?
What kind of love from a n**** every night make you cry?
What kind of love from a n**** make you wish he would die?

I mean s*** he bought you things and gave you diamond rings
But them things wasn't worth none of the pain that he brings
And you stayed, what made you fall for him?
That n**** had the power to make you crawl for him

I thought you was a doctor be on call for him
Smacked you down cause he said you was too tall for him, huh?
That wasn't love, babygirl you was dreamin'
I could have killed you when you said your seed was growin' from his semen

[Chorus: x2]
Love is blind, and it will take over your mind
What you think is love, is truly not
You need to elevate and find

I don't even know you and I'd kill you myself
You played with her like a doll and put her back on the shelf
Wouldn't let her go to school and better herself
She had a baby by your a** and you ain't giving no help

Uh-huh big time hustler, snake motherf***er
One's born everyday and everyday she was your sucker
How could you beat the mother of your children?
How could you tell her that you lover her?

Don't give a f*** if she lives
She told me she would leave you, I admit it she did
But came back, made up a lie about you missing your kids
Sweet kisses, baby didn't even know she was your mistress

Had to deal with fist fights and phone calls from your b****es
Floss like you possess her, tellin' me to mind my business
Said that it was her life and stay the f*** out of it
I tried and said just for him I'll keep a ready clip

[Chorus: x2]

I don't even know you and I want you dead
Don't know the facts but I saw the blood pour from her head
See I laid down beside her in the hospital bed
And about two hours later, doctors said she was dead

Had the nerve to show up at her mother's house the next day
To come and pay your respects and help the family pray
Even knelt down on one knee and let a tear drop
And before you had a chance to get up

You heard my gun c***
Prayin' to me now, I ain't God but I'll pretend
I ain't start your life but n**** I'mma bring it to an end
And I did, clear shots and no regrets

?Member cops comin' in, watch me going to jail
N**** whatever my b****, f*** it my sister
You could never figure out even if I let you live

Yo, yo what ya need from a bad bitch, that bitch
(Ladies) Don't fuck around if you strapless
Real thug hide his money in his mattress
See him in the club with his team never stackless
Want what we got, shorty got me hot
Might have something to do with the drop top
Big thing, big man
Spotted, your number, your name, got it
Freaks out, baby mother sneaking out
(Big boys in the back pull your g's out)
Thorough chick tell a nigga pile it on
Bitches what they call us?
(Brick house stallions)
Now we feelin' it, drinks all in me
Lady but a thug, double shot of Henney
Nigga look good, nigga got it all
Can help but to speak (""Damn daddy how ya doing?"")
Baby girl grew up, mommy ain't around
Searchin' for a thug in the club to hold me down, ughh
Find the one that's running it all
Top dog, his game sunning 'em all, huh
Whiling out, people piling in
(Oh shit, watch out)
Damn not again
Another nigga knocked out, that's how it go
Move to the other side, another drink (let's go)

Yo, yo, yo
Ladies are you feeling it
(Hell yeah)
Niggas are you feeling it
(Hell yeah)
What we gonna do with this shit
(Tear it up)
What you got beef with a bitch
(Play it up)
Shit, drunker than a mother fucker
Another round from the bar for my dog nigga
Here now (all night long)
Dance floor shoutin'
(That's my song!)
DJ mix it up, who got heat?
(Swizz Beats nigga what?)
Almost seeing double
Bet you be in trouble if he pull me
I got no time to cuddle
Fuck it let me have another drink
Damn how you get to the bar?
Let me think
Line for the bathroom, I ain't waiting in it
To the front chicks hatin'
(Uh-uh I know she didn't)
Shit yes I did, moving right along
Gotta get back before they play the last song
(Last call for alcohol)
Damn I knew it
Thirty minutes till it's over, better do it
One more drink, one more dance
Papi staring at me in the corner you got one more chance
Gotta eat, head to the diner
Thinkin' you gonna see me next week
(Try and find her)

Lets go

This is the darkest shit, sparkest shit 
Hitting wit the hardest shit, 'cause 'fore we started shit 
Wit kids I knew my friends all turned against me 
Said fuck it, bought me a dog ever since me and my dog has been like this 
He got my back I got his, scheming on mad niggas 
That's how we do biz
It's about time to start another, robbing spree 
'Cause yo, my way is highway, robbery, chump 
When I was up north, since 16 I was sending niggas home in a coffin 
Living like a orphan, you bad nigga? 
I'll be back to see if you'll be still here 
You know my style I'll put yo fucking man, in a wheelchair 
He'll never walk again, on the strength of me 
That's how I left him G, scared to death of me 
Cannot run, hit wit the hot one 
From the shotgun, cats was close, wondered how we got done 

E-V-E 
My dogs believe in me 
Petty thugs hide yo cake, never teasing me 
I show love to, all my bitches hustling one's, tussle wit thieves 
Making moves, second to none, I locked it, uh 
Made a sudden move you got bit 
Flooded wit the double R, real street shit 
The blonde hair bandit, you got guns, hand it 
Turn my face when I bust a cannon 
'Cause I don't wear sunblock 
Ask Drag if the fire is hot 
Click pop shells, fall three feet, roll over and stop 
Believe in this gang, we beat y'all, you got money? 
Keep y'alls, for us be tearing trying to i-dentify big dogs

And you can come see me if you trying to make a grand tonight 
'Cause I can get it for you raw, gray, tan or white 
I hate rap yo, I'd rather be planning a flight 
Somewhere hot on a Wave Runner, tanning wit dikes 
Blowing the haze, while all of 'em giving me brains 
One at a time, y'all start from the front of the line 
And as for you playboy you can keep those raps
And keep your awards, my son can't eat those plaques 
Drove the Benz off the lot and just dusted her off 
Tints, rims, stashed, took the governor off 
Even the cats that be hating still be loving the dogs 
'Cause they know that the double R's coming for war 
What

If you ain't ready to die, then why should you live? 
'Cause when I start swingin' the thing you hiding the kids 
And the P is still riding on trips, surviving the strip 
Beefing on the 4th you got to fly on the 5th 
Like I wasn't hustling hope or runnin' the block
Starving or not, carving the cheek, palming the Glock 
Figure which nigga could I watch wit a watch 
I like to knock off my work then I pull off a heist 
Put it together, double it twice, rider for life 
Catch me wit a 45, hot pair of Nikes 
And three red dice, like, give me the bank or gimmie yo face 
Gimmie a shank, it's Holiday  

Y'all dem bust in them crowd cats and hit whoever 
When you should aim for them cats that took yo leather 
They right there, but you scared that they gon' bust 
'Cause they crazy, but them crazy ones bleed like us 
See I'm one shot through the heart like Cupid 
Y'all dogs might be crazy, but y'all not stupid 
Y'all I got call cops squeelers, I got autops killas, that'll bust you and slide 
And some ol 6-drop killas 
Revolver pop killas, easy ox killas
Get knocked, say we smoked detox killas
Drug program, hit the streets we cop 56 mo grams 
Y'all killas ain't messing wit scrams 
And that's 

Boy, whats the difference between fire and water? 
You whether drown or die off torture, 'cause yo skins of ya 
And watch ya burn off fat, dog I'm off the thermostat 
Could put a comb to my mouth and give yo chick a perm wit that 
Keep shells in the envelopes 'cause I'll mail out bullets 
More blood than a riot on a jailhouse footage 
Buck 40, buy the extra 20 wit the semi, when it hit you 
You gon' do a 360 pretty swiftly 
'Cause I got things that'll pop yo top 
And double R spot yo block wit 16 shots and watch y'all drop 
And ain't nobody getting up, 'less they in the wheelchair

And if you gon' crack a nigga, might as well be a head
Cause if you targettin the L.O.X.
You might as as well target a box
That you gon' sleep in for years, all covered wit rocks
Cause I think not, I pop shots, I double what y'all got
Ya hotshots aint got blocks, ya punta muchacha
From the days in school, now a motherfucker rule
And I could drop my chain in court, yeah, keeps ya cool
That's how ice be, I'm priceless, the iciest
And I dont gotta wear fatigues to blow out your chest
My bullets thump when I'm laced in some fly shit, punk
The baby nine be on the daily, aint no poppin a trunk
But if I pop the trunk, its to hand you a rag
So you can wipe down the windows on the side of my Jag
Must I brag?  My shit paid for, yours tagged
And every bitch you grabbed, Sheek bend em back

Ayo I hope you aint tongue-kissin your spouse
Cause I be fuckin her in the mouth
Type of nigga buck at your house
Too slick, means she be suckin my dick
And before you know it, I'ma have her stuffin my bricks
Jada, if I kiss you now, you'll die later
I been nice since niggaz was watchin movies on Beta
Ready to clap, everybody givin me gats
Cause believe it or not, we be the ones settin the traps
You listen to y'all shit, then listen to our shit
Ain't nuttin y'all faggots could do but gossip
That's the reason now y'all niggaz ain't got shit
Cause everytime I turn around y'all on the L.O.X. dick
Niggaz thats narrow, I just smack em wit the barrel
Give it to em at the light, like Kane's cousin Harold

I clap you, I clap him, and thats rule number one
Suckin my dick, and I dont give a fuck what you spit
Who you are, where you from, and who the fuck you can get
Cause I sell records, plus I got a jail record
Y'all niggaz ain't sayin shit until y'all bare weapons
And even when you dead, you can still fuckin get it

Comma, burnin niggas often
They call me Drag-On, I'm hot scorchin
Keep the block roastin
Light a dutch wit the flames comin, toastin
In my eyes you could see what summer's holdin
Realizin, every guy I'll fry or dead rowdy
I burn to a degree of 130, and my gun dirty
Cause it got one bury, so you better run, hurry
Or catch one early
You wrong, tryin to touch me,  what type of shit you on? 
You better through your boots on and your unflammable suits on
Cause I'm comin through wit a Yukon
Black tinted wit gats in it
Catch you while you smokin, send your casket, throw the sack in it
But only half of it, cause y'all like half-ass dude
And we are one whole, and y'all niggaz is one slash two
My gun blast you, tryna out the flames, what're you, firemen?
You'll catch a hell of a backdraft
cause my fire retirin, aight then

Its my, survival instinct that keeps my head above the water
Everyday I show another how a I love a slaughter
Flood your daughter, full of more holes than spurges
Taxin businessmen for stocks over lunches
Wit these, I shoot the breeze, and extort
Enough keys from the Cuban, to build a fuckin fort
Caught up in somethin that I cant control
Tryna get a hold of a bankroll, let's role
Catch bodies like a cold, and I stay slick so face it
Make me chase it, I take your life and erase it
Waste it, in the fuckin streets cause it ain't worth shit
The undertaker take your ass under the earth quick, I
Love money, but the scrambles hot
So i snatch up my man and the gamblin spot
Twenty grand is got, one niggaz shot, one nigga less
What used to be his chest is now a mess under his fuckin vest

I ain't got no sympathy so if you scared, nigga cry

Fuck the mask, we're robbing you in lipstick and wigs, what?
Yeah we brawl, but you took me out and let me see it all
Braggin' 'bout the shit you got and now I get it all

Expensive paintings on your wall, gimme that
Ain't no slacking, time ain't a factor

Used to ball with your niggas

Now I'm making you crawl across the floor
Ego crushed and I don't give a fuck
Small change to the range, heard what I said
Give it up

I know it ain't right, but me and my bitches gotta eat tonight
And every night from now on, get it right

Ducking, jumping over shit, bet this bitch could last
Ready for war, act like I ain't done this shit before
Practice on me next week, I'll be wanting more

Best believe you ain't gonna live to see tomorrow
My dogs already warned your mother
She'll be full of sorrow
Busting through the door, somebody's house, kids screaming

I ain't gonna front somehow I wish that I was sleeping, dreaming
Too late it's done now, all you hear is gun sounds
Cock back, pop, pop, pop, and I'm like what now
Ghetto bird on me, weaving through the trees

Last fence I hopped over, fell and landed on my knees
Barrels at my temple, hey yo fuck it I'ma make it simple

Only case we catching now would be a misdemeanor
Remember we used to hustle thinking life would cheat us
Not knowing if we struggled life would treat us
Think on how mommy carried us
Where life gon lead us
Knowing if we getting married
Our wife will need us
If at one time you could look into my mind
When I close my eyes and remember them times
No gas, had a hot plate heat our dinners
No cash, most nights ate sleep for dinner
Welfare and white landlord, that life ain't easy
The only ones moving up was George and Weezy
All my sugar water babies who live in autos, it's crazy
Keep it in the dark, I'm-a speak it from the heart

Fucked up I couldn't feed myself
Living life no means of wealth
Eating shit I can't believe myself
That's not a joke
Man I was dealt these cards and I played dem out
Yeah the road was rough but I made a route
Now picture running extension cords from your neighbor's house
To get lights, fuck Max on the latest routes

And tell me half of these cats ain't been through jack

One night back in July
She was standing outside the club
So fly she caught my eye
But you know that was not enough
I tried to get closer to shorty
But wifey had peeped my game
She looked at her funny
They had words
And I was the one to blame

It started out one day
Coming on a rainy day
The sooner I do it, she never even stood a chance
More will come, but there's only one champion
She was out for the count again

It took about one hour later
I started to make my move
Out on the dancefloor
When wifey returned she was through from powder room
She saw me, freaking the same way I do
When I dance with her
And maybe if I would have played the right cards
She wouldn't be hurt

Now that's for acting dumb like you ain't know who you was wit'
You see this are around my neck

See me drinkin' think I'm touched
Next time you see this thug
You gonna be walking on a crutch

'Cause E-V-E got it locked down tight
B****es ball, watch 'em fall, made it mine for life
Killin' it with Drag-On; I mean dash On
Y'all n****s complain while we get this cash on
Get our blast on and mash on anyone tryin'
Too late, luck turned bad; you left dyin'
And I got no fear; f*** it, don't care
Know my n****s, then you know that we gon' blast in the air
Weak shots, not; change you for block
Stop game; no pain down from the dock
Take out who, invincible crew
Got n****s that don't even hang with us with tattoos
Most influential
N****, please, who sent you?
Smells like enemy 
Take you out, it's essential

[Chorus x 2]

[Drag-On]
Yo, yo, I got bullets to give to ya
And a fast way to send 'em to ya
You might not be able to live with that or give it back
Hold it for now
Aiyyo, Eve, I'm holdin' you down
'Cause they know our pockets is swollen now
It's over for the clowns

[Eve]
Aiyyo, crazy if they think we lazy; got the bankin'
Us all stop that, maybe leave 'em stankin'
B**** of the litter and how you gon' rid of her?
Never shy, speak to the public after we hit 'em up

[Drag-On]
Drag'll come through your town, sunroof down
Guns is packed with rounds
Drag ain't stupid now
I'm smart, but y'all can get the dumb dumbs in a lump sum
'Cause you know they all come when run come

[Eve]
Aiyyo, ride shotgun; crowds scream how come
Cops lay; chest plate blown outcome
How you gon' try snatch our fame without none?
Muzzled mouth lights knocked out; we 'bout done

[Chorus x 4]",Here We Go,2000
Eve,"(do you ever have bad dreams? All I have is bad dreams)
I knew a man with a son
Who bought him a gun
And learned shorty just how to use it
Taught him hunting and skinning
Right from the beginning
Built himself a mighty fine killer
But shorty got picked on
Beat on and kicked on
And all his classmates want to punk him
So with tears in his eye
He catch him in a ride
And told his old man he went hunting
And he felt so free
Like his destiny
Lay somewhere out on the horizon
His heart went cold
He felt a hundred years old
And started pulling back on the trigger

[Chorus]
I think I'm gonna die today
And everyone who hurt me's gonna pay
How could such a short time be so long
How could such a young life go so wrong

(what's it gonna take for you to really make it in life?)
See me
Hear me
But don't touch me
You should fear me
Lived your life dearly
'Cause I'm seriously disturbed
That's my word
Straight to my mother
Wayne, my brother
Who found another one to play sucker
'Cause I ain't the one
Who put shade in your sun
And took all your shine
Watch me get mine
Feel my love burn
Me for my sins
Watch the world turn
The saga begins
Losses and wins
Angels and sins
Dancin' on top
Ahead of the pit
Don't know where I'm going
But I know where I've been
I can't hear a sound
I clapped a full round
I came to get down
I came to get dirty
I came to get even

[Chorus]
Momma, don't cry
Please, momma, don't cry
Momma, don't cry
You did nothing wrong",So Long,2000
Eve,"Eve:
Come on, huh
Come on, yo, yo, yo
Some people blond peeps, red banjies
Some are moving quickly, outta town
How they gonna find her moving swiftly?
Five steps ahead of the best so that's nothing
Twenty steps ahead of the rest they left stuck
And in they face not, what not?
I can't stand broads
Ridiculous niggas practice for the title ""hard""
Me pick of the litter
I was born to bubble why'all
Born to change game shit born to stand guard
Play games you left nameless, fame hard
Promise that it's never painless
Nigga be hard
Convinced that you can take over the Eve
Eat nigga let starve
Strong as a stallion maiden
You better dart
Is she feminine with pretty women friends all dimes!
Timberlands is how I like my men and all minds
Rough ryde you niggas hard head, soft spine
Pass the word
Must have the stacks to cross lines
Come on

Now don't start flippin' it
Everybody know
We've been had dough

Money might make you grown
But you still need a dog to take you home
And make you moan
You ain't gotta see the bank for loans
All I do is party and bullshit like when Frank was home
And you got it all boo I got it all too
A four, five, and a six and they all blue
And I don't care what she think
If I offered you any ice love it'll be in the drink
And instead of talking 'bout what you got and all that
Just make sure when I hit you that you call back

Yo, yo ay yo
One touch will make a nigga blush on site
Grown men create a crush, nails they bite
It's a game try to catch me but only if you can
It takes a lot to impress the bombshell to want a man
And it ain't about your dough baby Eve alright
Cause if Eve want to fly away, Eve take a flight
Eve hungry for a meal baby Eve get a bite
You nice and you might get to see it daddy, tight

Jada:
Yo, yo, yo
I'm glad that you got it all
That's more for me
And I ain't gotta pay for the puss I score for free
And the same thing I pulled on them
I pulled on you
Come on now how you think I pulled your crew?
Got my own crib so you can't kick me out
I'll call one of your friends to come twist me out
If you know Jada then you know what Kiss be 'bout
Just for fun I hit the bank and pull fifty out, uh ah

Uh, uh

[Verse 1: Jadakiss of The LOX]
Yo
Catch me comin' out a red lobster 
In a red Boxer
With a red bone and take headshots to Vodka
Nothing like a pretty chick, that's pretty rich
Who pretty lips and who smoke 50 nicks
The type you can bring around the fam and all
She get plain tickets, creditcards, scandin' off
And why'all know Jae, I, Swizz, honeys with Parle'
And I still gon get my money the hard way

[Chorus 1: Parle']
Just one hit of your love
Is exactly what I need
To get my high, (Got me down the street)
Get my to the places where I want to be
But instead, you got me in the streets (Got me down the street)
Fiendin' like a freak
Caught up in the mix
All I need, all I need's just a fix

[Parle]
Fix me with your love
Straight up (Say I'm straight up)
Just can't get enough of your love (Can't get enough of your love)
Hit me with the dub (two times baby)
And hook me up (High)
Want to get high up off your love (So high)

[Chorus 2: Parle']
Just can't quit, can't get enough
So addicted to the stuff
Get me high, (Got me down the street)
Tastin' your love baby's all I'm thinking off
In my bed, fucked up all the weed (Got me down the street)

It's playin tricks
All I need, all I need is just a fix

[Chorus 3: Parle']
Fix me with your love (Fix me with your love)

Daddy you know the bid, mommy here a stimulate
Think you be ready for my lovin' on the first date

Rydin' Ruff with a stallion, bring 'em to they knees
Tried to warn you first you ain't listen
Now you in a fucked up position, got you cleanin' up my kitchen
And the dishes and the gifts you givin' out
You got you dug out

I had to tell my girl to pack her shit
Cause she slipped and dipped inside
I need a girl that's ready to ride
To keep the heater right by her side

Hey yo, so what the deal Dogg, tell me, keep it real Dogg
Niggas seem stressed to the brain, how you feel Dogg?
Nigga I'ma ride, set it up, let it spill Dogg
Anything you want, I can flip, got the skill Dogg

Baby girl you so sophisticated
Finance related, you graduated
To the next level in the game, wearing my name
Bad little brick-house, go and do that thing

[Eve]
Yo, niggas surprised when they open they eyes
Thick in the thighs wasn't part of they plan
Not just his bitch, I'm like his main man
Act shifty, your resistance gone swiftly
Bitches mad at a nigga, asking why he kissed me
Stop whining, just to cry and get the macking daddy
I don't like it when the angry chick is acting crabby
That's why he bagged me
Ghetto jewel, never loud and trashy
No stressing over chicks, problem? Bet I solve it fastly

[Chorus: x2]

[Snoop Dogg]
We gang-bang on these niggas like we 'posed to do
And I'll be damned if I let a bitch get close to you
We posted Boo, you, my, one and only
Quick to dump before the homies
Remember when that phony nigga ran up on me at the club?
You filled him up with slugs, that's what I call love
All that pushing and shoving, kissing and hugging
Thugging, dig it, dug-in
I'm loving every minute of it Boo
The way you stay true, and always kept your cool
You kept the heater right by your thigh
And when the shit got hectic you was ready to ride
You didn't run out, when I pulled the gun out
That's what I'm talking bout, no doubt
Ruff Riding, Eastsidin, to the realest y'know
D-O-double-Gizze, you know how we get busy

[Eve]
Hey yo, how could I leave a real nigga? A real nigga's all I need
Fake bitches try to take my place, fall to they knees
Don't violate, see my man, he don't like no scrapes
And if I heard you was fronting I hope on the case
Wild one? Maybe, but I'ma protect my baby
Test me fool and by the end you gon' think I'm crazy
That's how I do for my Dogg, keep my niggas strong
Both sides relied on the shit, nigga sing the song

Just avoid a bad situation, what you got to prove? 
Leave her be, chicken squakin hatin frequently 
Mad they man is obsessed and stalkin me 
If he, icy enough, I'm pricin his stuff 
Be nicy enough, to let him spend, I'm callin ya bluff 
Puttin it down, Ruff Ryders put in they work 
Snatched up the illest viscous pitbull in a skirt 
(Grrrrrr) Makin em hurt, haters steady dishin up dirt 
Changin the game, settin the rules, makin it work, uh

Leavin em scared, mami takin all of this here 
All of this fame I'm hungry hope you cats is prepared 
Niggaz, set me up and I'ma take it and run

Stoppin your shine, and I do it to perfection 
Made a promise everytime I touch the mic to bless em 
Used to tease me how I keep is greasy just to test em 
Eve handcuff niggaz but I don't arrest em 
Shorty-bang hear the niggaz singin, shoutin my name 
Make the thuggish niggaz scream, watchin me entertain 
Dicks brick when I lick the lips, just keepin it plain 
Fantasizin bout this bitch, got em goin insane 
Oooh's and ahhh's, 5'7"" thick in the thighs

Then wait for a drought and flood 'em with all 'dres
Ride or die chick, hand do a B.I.
Give a nigga up north some ass on a V.I.
And she blackout when she in the mall
Got the brand new spring Prada shit in the fall
Don't matter what size panties, fitting her small
And she don't got no problem hittin' us all
And she said she got a man, but he in the fed
And she miss him so much that she pee in the bed
So you know I had to lighten her raw, fighting the dog
Pushing the seat back gettin' right in the fall
Make her use a fake credit card twice in a store
Might make you do it tomorrow you triflin' whore

I need a chick that ryde or die, pullin' the 5
Gettin' high with the Coogi frames over her eyes
Sweet to the tail, still won't fuck in a Benz
'cause she bought me a Polo coat and a couple of Timbs'
Doobie was rap, both in the movie with gats
Gave me head 'cause the movie was wack, word
Toasted her crib, blow in the fridge, she needed to work
I died and that bitch gon' put weed in my hearse
Gamed her to death, tattooed my name on her neck
You don't want to see me bangin' the left, hittin' the gas
That bitch out the window poppin' heat in yo' ass
You could catch holiday in to Holiday Inn
With a bad bitch swallowin' gin, word
And if it got to do with money count Holiday in
With my ride or die bitch that'll body your man
You don't like me as a artist, she gon' body your fam'

Yo, when you see Sheek, don't look at me as Sheek from The L.O.X.
Look at me as that cat that know how to box
Know about glocks, know about slingin' them rocks
Know about runnin' from cops and switchin' up spots
How to get rich, know about thuggin' a bitch
Fuck 'em in the park, fuck a sweet as the Ritz
They like that shit, and I ain't gotta spend no checks
Fuck diamonds, all they really want is rough ass sex
And they name, shout it out when I'm up at Flex
I get drunk with bitches that don't get drunk
Don't get high, have 'em doing drive-by's
Shit they never did, forgetting about they kids
Moms babysitting, ain't seen her in a week
I'm a bad influence to parents that hate Sheek

Now you can quote me on this
I bust my gun
Also quote me on this
I handle my biz
I knew it was my house when Run was sayin it was his
I ain't lying
Ain't no cords or no steam in this iron
But it is a permanent press
Have these 38 shells spray starch your chest
Leave you stiff
Coroners make ashes of you
In rap I'm like God nigga forever above you
If I don't do it all I just dial my phone
And you get sprayed through your clothes like you put on cologne
If it's not violence or drugs I have nothing to spit
I be lying if I talk some spiritual shit
Like Kirk Franklin and them
Y'all just ain't me
I can't tell you about God but I can tell you about a key
And what I'll do to God's children if they jerk me
Hurt me , never , that'll be a sin
I'ma put the Bible to your head and shoot through Matthew verse 10
What
C'mon niggas
What

[Chorus: x2]
You told me you would bust your guns for me
(Yeah bust your gun dog)
You said you'd always sling your pounds

But L-O-X will hold it down
(You know the LOX gonna hold it)

I'm back in the game
I still ride the back of the train
And sit right next to Jake with a package of Caine
Niggas say he realer than me you call him a liar
I got the Audi T T the same color as fire
You just getting a name
Putting shit in the game
Stop faking
I have your do-rag looking Jamaican
Holey as the water in the front of the church
Then find you with no back plus one in your earth
I can't wait for the day you get murked
Cause I'ma throw a free party at the Tunnel and give out work
I love myself , my family , and love my son
Love my niggas and love white Air Force Ones
And besides that I'm open off the dro and the guns
And the head you could get from a hoe in the slums
Niggas always act silly till you show em the milly
Then they got the nerve to ask you why you wanna kill me
Uhh

[Chorus: x2]

[Styles]
I know it ain't right
For me to swear to God
But I swear to God that I'll murder you dog
And I know it ain't right
For me to sell dope
Rob stores but I still gotta run from the law
Twenty niggas in the clique
How all of us pour
In a three room apartment and we all on the floor
I reflect to the days I thought of busting the whip
Now I come through the scene and niggas cuffing they bitch
Feel good to see Kiss spend a buck on his wrists
Or Sheek fronting on a jet ski with a Puerto Rican chick
I don't rock no jewels
But I pops my tools
And I work my coupe to do a buck 68
P hit you in the head like a dutch to the face
Or a cup full of liquor
Come and fuck with you nigga
Cause I make drug money
Gotta take blood from me
If you wanna prove a point pull a joint shoot dummies

Double are's the only niggas he respect and, why y'all niggas shook right?
Why y'all get on Hot 97 and, talk wit a baritone
Wit two niggas downstairs with licensed guns to take why y'all home
Scared ass niggas, you think they going take a life so they can get life [nope]
Ask Puff they ain't trying to hear that nigga
For no cake, and why y'all can get at us on Labor Day
We make stones that say ? your moms labor day
I'm in the hood so we can link up, any place you think of
Hand held don't hold prints plus I burnt the tip of my fingers
I'm a Bronx gangsta nigga, double are's hoodrat

You keep claiming you the best that done it

Same niggas we run up on and make 'em cry
Outta all the camps in this game, nigga
We the champs in this game
Who kick the real shit before the fame
Fuck you fat ass, fake bad ass niggas

And I'm down for smoking blunts to the head

If you from the streets betrayal is worse than death

I kill everything you love dog, right now, even the pets
Everything got dubs on it, even the vets

Brought up in poverty and sin
Makin' jokes at the crazy lady
Never acred how she was dealin' within
I knew all the words to
Micheal Jackson's album as a kid
And when it came to the biggest crusher
No he wasn't my man
At the age of seven years old
A strange thing happened to me
Before I even saw
My life had flashed before me
And I've got the mark to show
And it became a thing of beauty
So I gotta let you know

From all the sights that I've seen
From abusin' the hole in trust

Ain't no values being taught, no productive thoughts
Jealousy rules the world, take shit at any cost
Gotta change our state of life, keep it worth livin'
God gave us voices to speak and that's our way of givin'
It's so much bigger than the furs and the jewels
What about encouragin' the youth to do well
What about givin' back what about unifying
Shit we all black get it together
Everybody's got their trials and tribulations
Learn to change the negative to positive situations
Don't hold the lessons that you learn
Pass it on and except the blessings that could earn

Listen to me baby, relax and start passin'
Expressway, hair back, weavin' through the traffic
This one strong should be labeled as a hazard
Some of why'all niggas hot, sike I'm gassin'
Clowns I spot em and I can't stop laughin
Easy come, easy go, E-V gon' be lastin'
Jealousy, let it go, results could be tragic
Some of why'all ain't writin' well, too concerned with fashion
None of you ain't gizell, cat walk and imagine
Alotta why'all Hollywood, drama, passed it
Cut bitch, camera off, real shit, blast it

And if I had to give you up
It's only been a year
Now I got my foot through the door
And I ain't goin' nowhere
It took awhile to get me in
And I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear
Now let me blow ya mind

They want to bank up, crank up
It's been a week?
Shank up, haters want to come after me
You ain't a gangster, prankster, too much to eat
Snakes in my path want to smile ?after me

Now while you grittin' your teeth
Frustration baby you gotta breathe
Take a lot more that you to get rid of me
You see I do what they can't do, I just do me
Ain't no stress when it comes to stage, get what you see
Meet me in the lab, pen and pad, don't believe
Huh, sixteens mine, create my own lines
Love for my wordplay that's hard to find
Sophomore, I ain't scared, one of a kind
All I do is contemplate ways to make your fans mine
Eyes bloodshot, stressin', chills up your spine
Huh, sick to your stomach wishin' I wrote your lines

And if I had to give you up
It's only been a year
Now I got my foot through the door
And I ain't goin' nowhere
It took awhile to get me in
And I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear
Now let me blow ya mind

Let your bones crack
Your back pop, I can't stop
Excitement, glock shots from your stash box
Fuck it, thugged out, I respect the cash route
Locked down, blastin', sets while I mash out
Yeah nigga, mash out, D-are-E
Back track, think back, E-V-E
Do you like that (ooooh), you got to I know you
Had you in a trance first glance from the floor too
Don't believe I'll show you, take you with me
Turn you on, pension gone, give you relief
Put your trust in a bomb when you listen to me
Dancin' much, get it all? now I'm complete, uh huh
Still stallion, brick house, pile it on
Ryde or Die, bitch, double are, can't crawl
Beware, 'cause I crush anything I land on
Me here, ain't no mistake nigga it was planned on

And if I had to give you up
It's only been a year
Now I got my foot through the door
And I ain't goin' nowhere
It took awhile to get me in
And I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear

Eve,"[Eve]
This song is a dedication to those strugglin' and livin' on
For those who can't see the light, it's comin'
Stay strong, feel me

[Teena Marie]
Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah,

[Chorus: Teena Marie]
Living life is so hard
Every day I pray to God
Tell Him to send me light so I can touch my soul
And always know right from wrong
Living life is so hard
Every day I pray to God
Tell Him to touch my heart so He can ease the pain
Anything to hide the scars

[Eve]
Thank you God, I appreciate every blessin'
Happiness to heartaches, take it as a lesson
I learned a lot in this year

Got a profession that keeps me stressin'
Facin' criticism, answerin' questions
And you still keep me happy and healthy
Blessed with a mind to play the cards that life has dealt me

No doubt I struggle, I cry at times
Sometimes I wish I could live in a bubble
And it gets hard not to stray to trouble
I'm proud of me, got a family that holds me down

Real friends 'cause the other ones claim they don't know me now
But long as God with me, I'ma be good for sure
He's the one who picks me up when my face is to the floor
Life is crazy, people never cease to amaze me

Stay with stories by how they made me or raised me
And it's funny, 'cause everybody seems to be so hungry
Either they want my life, or they want my money

[Chorus]

[Teena Marie]
How can life be so hard?
How can my life be so hard?
Whatever doesn't kill me makes me strong
Whatever doesn't kill me makes me strong
Every day I pray to God
Every day I pray
Whatever doesn't kill me makes me strong
Whatever, whatever, whatever

[Eve]
Been through a lot
Still gotta watch my back 'cause people plot
Close is to do you dirty just so they can take your spot
Some days I feel like I want to quit

But I pray too long and dreamed and worked too hard for it
Wouldn't trade my life, none even a little bit
'Cause it could be worse for real, I could be turnin tricks
Might bitch and whine but always just in the back of my mind

I could be livin' on the streets, nothin' to eat without a dime
So I thank God, and I think why 'cause life's hard
Meet a lot of people but always I'm puttin' up my guard
'Cause you never know, some people snakes

Some people give a lot but mostly not, most people take
A lot of smilin,' claimin' realness but most people fake
Still gotta smile, 'cause that's what it takes
Sometimes it's lonely

I feel like people see me really don't know me
But my best friend is Him, and I know He'll hold me

[Chorus]

[Eve]
I got a lot of people on my side protectin' me
Dee, Waah, Chivon, and the family
Gotta thank God for them 'cause they keep me right

I also thank Him every day for the love of my life
I thank Him, for this gift just to be able to write
And rock crowds that scream my name, able to excite
Thank God for my fans; I love the way they love me

Happy that I'm comfortable, eatin, livin lovely
I love my life, still there's the pressure and pain
So I make sure that I'm grounded and able to maintain
A lot of people think I'm lucky, travelin and hangin out

But if they only knew, I +WISH+ I could be hangin out
I'm bangin out hits, in the studio I'm livin low
Makin plans to last a lifetime, make sure I'm gettin dough
Huh, come on, just so the people know
Uhh, come on, just so the people know

My, Baby, That's my baby come on!

[DMX]
Time to hit y'all cats with another joint from Eve and
the dog
And you know how we do baby creep in the fog
Now hold it down for the fellas, hold it down for the
girls
Keep motherfuckers knowing this rap shit is our world
(What!)
Been there and done that, had fun where the run
at 
Don't got to shoot a motherfucker no more so put the
gun back 
Pay niggas to do that, cause they a lot better at it
Keep the burner in the truck cause well you got to
have it (aight)
It's an unwritten law (uh huh)
Let a fagot open that unwritten door (uh huh)
Hit 'em with four  hairline to the jaw (what!)
That's what I'm aiming at
We going to get that nigga X aight well keep saying
that
Eve I wish you the best and I'll always love you

Never hear me say FUCK YOU because I love you (what)
Always here for you when somebody else is not 
A dog and his bitch blowing up the spot
Come on

[Chorus: x2]

[Eve]
It should be against the law, me and the dog like a
brawl
And the only thing that can help you is God and you
should call on him
Weak sight, the streets like, creep like
Cause they got each other's she bark and he bite
It ain't strange you cats know the name
Double are bubble hard it's a shame
Realest niggas doing it, them clowns they ruin it
Shut 'em down give 'em pounds cause palms go glue in it
Sticky finger niggas steal each other's style
Claiming how they started things not original
Cats they get caught up in the glitter and glam
If that's the case you should be considered a fan
I'm like tired of the same beats that claim streets
Doing nothing but ducking from the hood got the same
speech
Only one you feeling is you niggas know the deal
Industry, fuck it, in the streets keep it real, nigga

[Chorus: x2]

[DMX]
Since the beginning we both knew we was winning
Cause we been in all type of shit  but kept on
spitting, hitting
Niggas in the head with that shit that let 'em know it
was the truth
So they feel that cause it's real black (WHAT!)
We never going to stop, no matter what they say

No matter what they do  they'll never take it away
(Come On)
What the Lord give you let no man curse
E-V-E and DMX from the birth to the earth

[Eve]
Why they sick cause we still close thought that it was over
Cats trying to tear us apart dogs got closer
All the shit we deal with only make us stronger
Try to do a lot of shit but they can't belong to
For real niggas scared us, steady catching thembluffing
What you say shut up nigga saying much of nothing
Act like they don't want it but they demand it
Double are keep it hard and niggas can't stand it

[Chorus: x3]",Scream Double R,2001
Eve,"First time I seen your face I was like damn
Put your arm around my waist I was like man
Gentle with the touch I ain't fuss still a strong hand
I ain't know if I should lust or play it like a man
True I'm human like you but gotta play it smart
Questions I gotta ask for we get this start
Pulse racing fast damn can you feel my heart
Got me feeling wild yeah you doing your player part
Trying to feel you up excuse me I mean feel you out
What your life like tell me what your mind about

His touch it really turns me on
This message comes from me to you
Please stop touching on me (you know you want it)
But I got go

Listen baby you know that I'm attracted to you crazy
But I ain't gonna play stupid so you can try to play me
You ain't really telling me shit and tryin' slay me
And on the real this quiet shit is starting to drive me crazy
The only thing that's keeping me still is sex appeal
Strong but silent type is that you what the deal you
Know what I like on me gotta keep it real
Something in my mind saying that you probably got the skills
But I ain't giving in your friends they feminine
And I don't know how many of them you might be swimming in
But them lips though make me wanna try my luck
Straight thug what I love and you got me stuck
Cause you dress right I'm supposed to be pressed right
But on the real you got me thinking if I could be blessed tonight
Let me stop thinking these things it's not polite
I wanna give it to you raw but I'ma put up a fight

[Chorus: x2]

From subliminal seduction not really touching
But like rubbing acting like you wanting nothing
Your eyes say it all playboy but you no rushing
Treat me like your pray only your sexual hunting
I'm running fronting cause really I'm wanting to
Let you lay me down pound for pound we be crushing
I'm tight vexed cause I'm really dwelling on the sex
Chills up my spine the way you smelling up my neck
I'm like putty in your hands I gotta keep my composure
Plus I'm tryin' to remember how long I really known ya
You make it hard fighting you off is like a job
But I'm doing good so far body starting to throb
Should I give in ready to open my garage
And let you park in the dark but damn I gotta
Fight you off gotta roll out but before I leave

Left it wide open got no time to play
Mad 'cause shit changed got no time to stay
Considered snobby then just hate me I don't give a fuck
Considered sloppy to me you just need to give it up

Eve don't give a fuck about you

I ain't got a moment to waste
I'm tryin' to get to your head, so I gotta make room in your face
And they can't see your eyes or your nose
Why P? 'cause four, five slugs is consumin' the place
This is holiday you need, you fuck with the scorpion
I don't stop poppin' till your body don't breathe
Clap more than the audience, after the show
Stab more than the butcher and I'm kinda righteous
So I'ma help you pray for the Lord when I push you
She, the first lady, I'm the ghost with the gun
Aimed at your son that'll love to burst crazy
Ruff ridin' the clique, come up outta your shit
Get clapped in the wig, sold a lotta records
But we never gave a fuck so it's a wrap for the kids
Got to the back and the ribs
We the hood, even holiday bitch that's what it is

Broke out and got grown, holdin' her own
That bitch come strong, give up, dead wrong
I don't even fuck around 'less your head strong
Ain't too many that's around that can match they mind blown
Can't figure her out
Is she street, sweet, gutter, I'm from the hood
A lotta y'all niggaz gold
This bitch two million sold
And I just figured that I'd make it known
Baby girl got the whole world in her palm, alone
Watch me rock, got my lip cocked
Spit fire, watch it better duck, you stuck, you crossfire
Thought you was the realest you said you caught, liar
Any time you at where I be, I'ma try you

I be the D-are-A-G dash ya niggas foot slim
Cause bullets make your feet fast
We throw babies in the trash
Drag don't play with little gats
Crib like McDonald's nothing but Big Macs
And quarter pounds
Bitch place your order now stay in line
I only fuck with broke niggas
That straight depend on crime
You straight pussy so fuck your ass cap
Cause in jail they'll put your cap where
Your ass at you ass black
Projects that's where Drag at
Yea ya got heart
But if I don't got my gun
That's where ya gonna get stabbed at
Boy as a young I never grabbed that toy
Drag was taught to grab that and ask
""Where the cash at""

[Sheek]
You think we shoot his pocket sides
Deuce deuce and 25's
You ain't takin' em' nigga
You threatenin' lives
I ain't frontin motherfucker
I don't shoot no legs
I'm tryin' to see if your brains
Really look like eggs
Or is it just that commercial
Your brain on drugs
Now it's a total different look
From these shotgun slugs
To get rich it could take less than two days
I'm like them little beepers
Half's and bullets two-ways
Fuck vests my shit go through toupees
I'ma thug in New York
And when I'm on your set
We the apartment where they filmed
Good times at
Bitch what the fuck I'ma thug nigga

[Chorus: x2]
I'ma thug in the streets and I know what to do
If you fucking with me I'ma fuck with you
I don't give a fuck now I'm doing my thing
Like a motherfucking dog I'm doing my thing

[Styles]
Weight on my back
Hate in my heart
Blood in my eye
Foot on the gas
Blunt in my mouth
Loving the ride
Hand on the gun
Ear to the street
Back to the wall
Mind on my money while I'm clapping at y'all

[Jadakiss]
I got niggas in jail
Crack in the hood
Hustle in south
Fiends and customers
That run in your house
I got family ties
I'm handy with knives
I live my life in the ghetto
Nose candy and nines
I'm deeper than most
Sleep wit it close
Wake wit a demon
Have visions of the whole
World shaking and screaming

[Styles]
I was born to be a leader
But if the game was dirty
I was born to be a cheater
You talking to me greasy
I was going to get the heater

[Jadakiss]
You tell me what you know about blow
Getting dough and straight warrin' with a meaner
Fronting in a Benz or I was soarin' in a Bima

[Styles]
Lyin in the cut
The gun is straight running
Like a tire on the trucks
If he is real or a liar
Put the player to his nuts
Or the fire to his guts

[Jadakiss]
Cause niggas is too soft
That heat make niggas cool off
Fuck ice I'm tryin' to cop the crew lofts

[Styles]
So we can be back in effect
I throw the barrel to the back of your neck
And hop back in the vette (corvette)

Cause they say rap is like dust

Bitches is so sick
They throw up
So scared they don't even
Come around in places that I show up
Go ahead nigga put your dough up
Me against who nigga grow up
Bitches choke can't even get their flow up
I ain't got no fear bout you bitches in the industry
Acting all confused don't know who you supposed to be
Chickens lost steady worrying bout
Who's dick is tossed
Stop stallin' better get this thing before it's gone
But I ain't mad
Cause I ain't gon' pass it on
Callin' askin can you get on my shit
Cause your cash is gone
You won't get no sales off of me

You had me, You lost me
And now you want me back
You fucked around and played around
And now your feeling sad

Uh, uh
How should I start it off
You must have thought me soft
Like it was all good to move on and cross me off
We never shared secrets
We wasn't fucking raw
Helped you when you were down and now you got the fucking gall
We used to be so tight
We was each others life
You was my husband and no doubt I was your fucking wife
Did anything you ever asked of Eve
You turned out to be a devil nigga I couldn't believe
Sneaking numbers out my phone
Calling bitches on the cell
What the hell!
Clunky bitches one on the scale
I'm like a dime over line
You can't calculate my status
And you fucking with these bitches like my ass wasn't the fattest
Like I didn't dress the baddest
Any time we surface
Must have been insecure
Niggas made you nervous
And I guess it was your purpose to lock me in
But you fucked up
Your lucks out
But then again

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Used to let shit slide
Caught a couple lies
I chilled for real, I mean I called a couple guys
Knew when you was fucking up, I saw it in your eyes
Then I guess it was my fault cause I put up the disguise
In public we was happy
In home we'd be scrapping
Later we'd be naked, joking, smoking and laughing
Making up to Break up
I thought that shit was love
But it wasn't and I learned the hard was soaking in suds
Crying all depressed
Not again You'll never catch me
Wishing on a star for some nigga to come bless me
I tried to save it
All you ever did was stress me
Pushing all me buttons
Why the fuck must you stress me
Nigga get a life
Go on and find a wife
Get the fuck out my face â??fore I go and find a knife
And you still calling my phone trying to act polite
Asking me for favors now you know that shit ain't right
But

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Uh-oh
You see me coming don't you
Look at you running won't you
Oh you gonna sit there and see me like I want to approach you
Now it's payback
I'm talking way back
To bitches calling hanging up
You ain't no way to save that
To unanswered questions
To home in the a.m.
To you out clubbing 
Forcing me to stay in
Remember, okay then
It's over, no playing
I said it before
I'm about to do it, fuck what you saying
To late for apologies
Go puff on a pile of weed
Think about this good bitch that's leaving and don't follow me
Moving on
Shut you down
Now you want to regret
You could fuck all day
But it would never feel like my sex
Played yourself
Tried to show I cared
You ain't cared
When I needed you the most nigga you wasn't there
And the game is the same
Comes around goes around
Now hate me forever while the chorus goes around

Eve,"It ain't so much about the words I say but how I say 'em
And I'm gon' play this game the best and make sure that I slay 'em
Even my enemies impressed 'bout how I make my moves
They tried to step it up but can't 'cause they just fake and lose
My niggas double are but I don't hide behind my dogs
Nigga, I'm holdin' mine
Bet against her, take a loss
And I ain't slackin' up
I gotta win at any cause
Intimidate you bitch niggas I got bigger balls
Ayyo I bet you can't stop her
She got a lotta shit wit her
Damn you's a fan don't try to block her
Man got you wantin' it
Fame how you hunger it

Gotcha, hear this music don't let nothin' stop ya
Dance and wave yo hands, let this beat start to rock ya
Every step, try to catch yo breath
In and outta control 'till you ain't got nothin' left
I love it when they wildin' out
I got 'em jumpin' around, see don't be shy
Don't hold it in baby just ride it out
Don't worry 'bout the time
Can't handle it? Then find the exit sign
I need the rest of y'all to lose ya mind

They want to try to say face it forget them cowards, they blew it
My attitude is confidence, Philly sponsored this

People hear me when I talk to yea

(On my own)
And can nobody can take me off this
(Path I travel on)
People hear me when I talk to yea

Yo
I'm in a position to help a lot of people
When I love it, but people that claim that they love me
Want to take advantage of it
I duck 'em, I can't lie that toss a lot of lies
Can't trust the story tears swellin' in my eyes
Let my pen stab the page, times I feel raged
Sometimes I feel trapped got me locked in a cage
But I break free
Won't never let the anger overtake me
'cause actions of another never make 'e or break 'e
(Hum)

I never let 'em shake me
And no matter what I always wish excessive thos' who hate me
The ones they call my enemies
Who only will be wanna be friends of me
On the other hand surrounded by the greatest team
Who wouldn't trade mind for nothin' not for anything
(Hum)
Thank you for giving me your bless
And I appreciate giving you everything and nothing less

I live my life through what's in my chest
My heart beat strong, sometimes contaminated by the pest
And yea I know I'm livin' blessed
And if I didn't make it here, my life would be a mess
Can't live a life of fear
All that get you is nowhere surrounded by a bunch of stress
And I always had a hard head

Had a choice to play around wit life or listen to a gossip
So I straightened up and I'm doin' right
Growin' every year, hey yo' this thing ain't happen' overnight
But I still got a lot to do
And never givin' up 'cause anything I feel I know is possible
Don't never let people discourage
Plant yo'll see the dream, baby and let 'em flourish
Lettin' you in on what I know
Hum, as I live my life an' as I grow

Jadakiss: What up what up what up, yea!
Styles: Eve let's do it again! Hahaha...

[Verse 1: Styles]
Yea it's the ghost Jada and Eve
I squeeze my shit, I don't wave it and leave
why'all motherfuckin' extra lame
Here's the game, when I shoot seeds, your man can catch your brain
He looked a hero when he drove the taxi in the hallway
Shootin' niggas down if they clothes is tacky
Get an 18 or brick and my clothes is khaki
And the Porsche got a glass roof
The blunt got a live purple haze in it, little bit of hash too
See me when I pass through, fuck around and I'ma blast you
Do what I have to, tryin' to get my math too
I leave a message, ain't a phone I use
I call my niggas, bat 'em down, they bones I bruise
Leave 50 niggas dead, niggas know my groove
Another 20 more engine niggas know my tools
I got a gun, you need to stand fo'
FUCK YOU BRING YO' MAN FO'?!

[Chorus: Styles, Jadakiss, Eve]
Styles: S be the ghost, Double are What
First come the hawk, then next come the toast

Jadakiss: K to the are Double are what
Send mad cowards on they way to Allah

Eve: E-V-E, Double are What
First lady, I just point, they squeeze
Ryde or Die, Double are What
Better keep your hammer right by your side

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
I gave you the best flows
On top of that, I even made niggas set goals
I want to know how many bullets can your flesh hold
Thirty-two, or whatever the tech holes
My dirty crew rather hawk you to death rather than talk you to death
'Cause listenin' is like livin' when yo' talkin' is death
So why'all better start readin' before you start bleedin'
And the odds was against us before we got EVE-n
Niggas in the hood don't give a fuck if you rich
Or drunk with the Prince CD own, bumpin' a kiss
Nigga frontin' I get my you in the pump kinda hot out
Hit the button put the roof in the trunk
Play the block with the Royal Blue 45 and make your mouth leak
Can't fuck with NY
Get my diesel from South Beach
you ain't got a ride, getchu a cab
ya' bitches is mad
Eve got the shit and smash

[Verse 3: Eve]
I'm a savage bitch
Ain't nobody gettin' close to this
And ain't nobody flipped and wrote the shit
And can't nobody sit and coach this shit
You feelin' lucky? then aproach me, shit
I'm like the glass, you just the coaster bitch; Under me!
You want to make it ugly, can't do nothin' 'bout it
Angry at the public, buggin' me
Rat bitch, pot bitch, hungover hot bitch
Wantin' all that money, fuckin' gettin' all that rock, shiiit
Scared of who? huh, we goin' get rid of you
Climbin' the walls wit' gimmicks, that shit is pitiful
Dawgs close by me, so why try me
They wan' cop me but they too sloppy
Damn, I gotchu stuck in a box
You feelin' trapped, got your stomach in knots
'Cause I ain't lettin' go
I keepin' it locked
I know you gettin' mad 'cause your luck's up
Plus I'm a purebread, baby, I don't fuck with mutts
Come on!

Now I ain't ever been the type to
Not excite ya
Can't miss the vixen that meant ya like her
Play ya position, just might invite ya
Party till the mornin if she like ya
I ain't attracted to no lame dudes,
Don't want to name a few
Don't lie either so don't ask
She might be namin you
When I'm allergic to these corny bitches
Tryna start shit to end my ? I'm too up on my riches
?Gang? been a part of me, dawg, and I'm'ma keep winnin
Never shoulda started me off
I love the way I'm livin
And they wonder why she won't stop
Sit around mumblin to myself hopin that my shit flop
Now that's the shit I like to laugh at
Obsessed with my every move
Dummy, find a crash test
Every year I'm just a little wiser
And yo it's still gon be left in the race ?

(Ayyo she got it like)

Eve,"[Chorus]
Lady look I'm tryin' to figure you out (OK)
I'm tryin' to find out what you all about (Yeah)
Baby girl I wanna get in ya head (My head?)
Damn is you everything that you said? (No Doubt)
Mean no harm. I admire ya style 
Just take a second baby here me out
I know ya game you tryin' to make me shout
Yo look I'm just tryin' to figure you out

He approached me boldly. Said he felt me said I'm looking lonely
I had to stop 'em. Tell him daddy chill cause you don't know me
He said listen ma mean no harm
Just wanna let you know my story yo, don't be alarmed
Usually I'm like the bitchy type
I'm quick to hit 'em wit a 'Ha yeah, OK aight'
'What's ya name again?'
But I was feeling dude
And to my surprise for once I wasn't being rude
had these eyes that'll make you melt
So what its corny. That's the way I felt
Had this body not a big deal but it helped
I mean this nigga had some shit wit 'em
And every time I tried to talk
he grabbed my hand and said sweetheart just listen

[Chorus]

Felt like I was little. Got me back to shy days
Is he being real or is he comin at me sideways?
Said he want a build wit me. I'm like here we go
Said he was a regular nigga that liked my flow
Confidence is key wit me so I let him go on
Casanova saying shit like damn you got a glow on
I'm like he did his homework knowing what I like
Cant find nothing wrong on 'em and he might be my type
Continued wit his story bout his 3 years in jail
How he missed the streets cause being in there was like hell
Bout his little daughter Kira center of his world
His princess and she know she daddy's little girl
I'm looking at his face-I looked at my watch
He smiled said he wished that time would stop
I apologized to 'em cause I didnt mean to be rude
He said 'I know you busy. Just really wanted to meet you.'

[Chorus]

Asked me if I had a man I said that I didn't
Wanted to know if he could be that wit my permission
Told 'em that I wasn't ready. He said 'Yeah right'
Told me that I need a real nigga in my life
I agreed wit 'em. Told him that'll come soon
Let him know that I enjoyed the talk but had to run soon
He asked when's the last time I took time for me?
And if I ever reflected on how shit could be
He told me I was blessed. I said 'Dog I know it'
He said just a reminder. Feel that way and never blow it, huh
Slipped me his number said use it for inspiration
Kissed my cheek and whispered thank you for your conversation,
huh

I keep some chuck's on my feet khakis on my legs
Trunk full of funk nigga while I'm breaking bread
Sliding through your system banging, bobbing heads
Doing mines and I don't care what other niggas saying
They can pop it, but they can't stop it, boy I'm getting mine
Selling clothes up in this bitch like Calvin Klein
Getting cuties to shake they booty at the same time
I'd be damned If I go back to jail for the same crime
I'm to slick to get caught up in this dirty game
I'm a scollar that make dollars off the birdy game
Crip hoping I got it popping on the Blvd.
Man I ain't fucking with Chevy's I got my own car
D-O Double you don't want to rumble, why you testing me
Oh I know, you must be gone off them extacy
Bad habits you better kick it before it get you loc
And try to get yourself hooked on this chronic smoke
Fo' sho!

Hey y'all, dogs from East to West Coast
All my dogs we could smoke, we 'bout to take some bank roll
Everywhere that I go, man I see the same hoes
I know they already know, yea we like it real raw

(uh-huh)These niggas got you head nodding
And this chick got the drums from your ears throbbing
Known to do it, baby bubbling do 'chu dare stop it
Love when bitches hate you, hear the song pimps
ain't nothing to me, Got my nigga Snoop he been down
As for my nigga Nate, shit he was in town
created heat so you can bang it, crank it nice and loud
Can't block me out I'm popping up Evie Eve, I'm upon your tv
Ain't never stuck up off the freezyness
Same bitch, same pitch nothing ridiculous
Want this brown girl I see you thug lick your lips
Gotta have that bombshell, damn girl I need you for me
Keep love on the both sides, we in the church
On these niggas getting smoke ties, domino playing
Up here praying that they legalize, but fuck it still choke top down
Baby blowing smoke in the sky, come on

[Chorus]

[Eve]
Now when you see me acting up in the club (it ain't nothing)
Uh six fall up on dub's (it ain't nothing)
Huh breaking up blueberry buds (it ain't nothing)
And every hood showing nothing but love (it ain't nothing)
Taste buds ain't the same, for the simple brain
Should of never let me learn what millions really mean
Yea I'm a simple girl, but really don't want simple things
Keep real dogs close, hate cats with simple brains
Not ready for the collision, stay up in your lane
East coast, West coast, you still don't fucking think
Dedicate to you baby, keep your gangsta lean

You gots to be my queen, cause I'm the Big king
The one with the Big house with the Big things

You're the queen of the team, with cream, you're so supreme
A blessing in the skies, open up your eyes
Me and you together shit, we gone collect the vibes
Exercise, and go where we want to go, stay fly
Sure and original, turn up your stereo

Now I'ma do this thing like it ain't done before
Never leave the game stranded, I had to give more
I'ma give you what you want, what you waitin' for?
Make the music that the people can't ignore
A lotta niggas is bitches, a lotta bitches be trippin'
A lotta them be wishin' that they was in my position
A lotta niggas be cowards and most chicks be chickens
Fuck 'bout the CLUCK! CLUCK! Eve ain't trippin'
Most dudes is okay (Half of the rest ain't)
Talkin' 'bout what they want to do (Reality they can't)
Ask 'em what they life worth, watch 'em draw a blank
I really ain't got no interest if it don't involve the bank
Most of the time I'm nice to 'em (Half the time I'm not)
It ain't nothin' new though (Learned it from off the block)
People think I changed much ''cause I'm livin' good
Now they get my voicemail, hear them callin' me rude?
Sometimes I feel bad (Most of the time I don't)
''cause if I don't protect my shit (Other niggas won't)
Some want me to neglect my shit (Take it for a joke?!)

Dre and Bombshell, don't you love how it blend?
Radio stations, DJ's they spin
Told why'all determined to win
You tryina enter through the back door?
Ain't nothin' happenin', this whole shit is my shit bitch and I'm the captian
Can't beat me join me baby then get to clappin'
Bang it in ya whip to get ya neck snappin'
I know you hopin' that I rest so you can breathe
Stressed when we in the same places 'till I leave
Whisper to they friends what they want to do to me
Wish they could erase me, take away the air I breathe
And I feed ''cause that shit only give me hunger pains
Never let you muhfuckas put out my flame
Ready for whatever, was trained to maintain
And I always been a savage 'bout the fame
Separate the girls from the women and the winnin'
Always knew the thrill was worth it from the beginnin'
Baby what's the deal I'm hurtin' 'em how I'm livin'
I gotta conquer it all now the world's my wishin'

[Verse 3]
Ain't nothin' hotter than this heat why'all, it's like a magnet
I don't really mess wit too many ''cause they be plastic
That's it enjoy it boy, it's like magic
Anything less than a banger will not have it
Still I Ruff Ryde but I got my team
And we ain't goin' nowhere 'till we lock the game
But in the mean time ball while we live the dream
And now I need to hear why'all sing

Yea it's hard, breakin' up ain't never easy, believe me
But fuck that, I wasn't gettin' treated like I needs be
But trust, I was controllin' all the things around me
But shit, I always been this chick ever since you found me
I tried and I tried, cried and I cried
Down for you nigga wit' lie after lie, after lie
Got sick of tradin' games wit' you
Started bein' jealous of me like dames would do
I'm like dawg, check ya balls, mad 'cause I receive applause
Men in my life was against the law
Startin' fights in public just so you could piss me off
I swear, if I was a dude it'd be fist to jaw
Always mad at my mouth 'cause I cursed you out
Missin' hard, know you feelin' what these verses 'bout
Doin' dumb shit, breakin' things, hidin' my phone
I'm outta 'dis here, pimp jus' leave me alone

Reminiscin' 'bout the way you was pursuin' me
Actin' like your period on screamin' you doin' me
Well, bye dawg, have a nice life, I'm fine dawg
Don't try to track me down or call 'cause that line off
Hope you feelin' bad without me, see if you can laugh without me
Cry what tears? I'm happy, I'm free
Still ridin' past the spots that you know I go

When you find out that the one you wit ain't who you want
Then you move out 'til you find yourself anotha love
But your ex gone always hate 'cause he can't hit you off
You don't hear me though

Claim you wanna please me, yet you vex me
Can't front, be thinkin' 'bout the way you used to sex me
God damn, days short, nights was long
And I was mad when I started spendin' nights alone
But I'm better off by myself lookin' for somethin' else
Sendin' me shit you can't pronounce, I don't want nothin' else
Wanted to love you until the end of my time
But fuck it, I'm done wit' you at the end of this line

You and me should just let this go
We never did take the time, to try to hold on
I'm thinkin' that you and me, should just let this go
We never did take the time, to try to hold on
I'm sick of that
I'm sick of that
I'm sick of that

Eve,"Gonna get in the car
Drive away
Drive so far
No one's gonna find me
Put my foot on the gas
Accelerate

Some days I be wantin' to get away, from it all
To be real this game ain't all it seem to y'all
I mean I'm blessed by my good God high, that no question
And I know my journeys long just a life learned lesson
But the world's just a mess right now, gone all crazy
Thankful for my single mother, strong how she raised me
Could've gave up long time and been lazy
But my dream's strong, hear this song I'm not complainin'

Just the realisation, livin' in this world of dreamin'
I mean I cry real tears and I got real fears
Want a marriage and some babies, do ya'll hear me in ya ears?
Discouraging, keep ya courage and walk ya path
Question everyday, ""How much longer will we last?""
How can you apologize for mankind?
No heart, no soul got sight but yo, the man blind
Not really seeing what he done to the future, he lost

Gonna get in the car
Drive away
Drive so far
No one's gonna find me
Put my foot on the gas
Accelerate
Drive so far
No one's gonna find me

Love, hate, pain, all the same
Still took for granted, either reason that's to blame
Gone 'coz he loved her, gone 'coz she hated him
Flipped out, taken out from the pain, who she datin' him?
It's like we don't have no meanin', what we breathin' for?
Birth, child raised right, gone now, fightin' for the war
Damn! Enough to make you crawl up in a shell
Cry for the innocent babies in this hell

Stuck from a fast fuck no shelter from the cold
Drugs and disease never growin' to be old
Do you feel me? Am I seein' all this by myself?
Can't trust the air I breathe, I'm prayin' for my health
Wanna get away but where I'm supposed to go?
Can't escape it so I'm makin' songs, let it flow
I said I wanna get away but where I'm supposed to go?
Can't escape it so I'm makin' songs, let it flow

Gonna get in the car
Drive away
Drive so far
No one's gonna find me
Put my foot on the gas
Accelerate
Drive so far
No one's gonna find me

Sometimes my heart hurt
Wish I could take away the pain with music
But it won't work, I guess I'm just an optimist
What's it gonna take for all o' us to stand up, put a stop to this?
Man, we in this thing together
Live and breathe together
Everybody love life but never make it better
Everybody talk shit but never get together

Shit, I ain't tryin' to preach I ain't even teachin'
This some shit that's bottled up inside me, I'm just speakin'
Wanna get away but where I'm supposed to go?
Can't escape it so I'm makin songs let it flow
I said I wanna get away but where I'm supposed to go?
Can't escape it
So I'm makin' songs let it flow

A lotta niggas is bitches, a lotta bitches be trippin'
A lotta them be wishin' that they was in my position
A lotta niggas be cowards and most chicks be chickens
Fuck 'bout the CLUCK! CLUCK! Eve ain't trippin'
Most dudes is okay (Half of the rest ain't)
Talkin' 'bout what they wanna do (Reality they can't)
Ask 'em what they life worth, watch 'em draw a blank
I really ain't got no interest if it don't involve the bank
Most of the time I'm nice to 'em (Half the time I'm not)
It ain't nothin' new though (Learned it from off the block)
People think I changed much 'cuz I'm livin' good
Now they get my voicemail, hear them callin' me rude?
Sometimes I feel bad (Most of the time I don't)
'Cuz if I don't protect my shit (Other niggas won't)
Some want me to neglect my shit (Take it for a joke?!)

Dre and Bombshell, don't you love how it blend?
Radio stations, DJ's they spin
Told y'all determined to win
You tryina enter through the back door?
Ain't nothin' happenin', this whole shit is my shit bitch and I'm the captian
Can't beat me join me baby then get to clappin'
Bang it in ya whip to get ya neck snappin'
I know you hopin' that I rest so you can breathe
Stressed when we in the same places 'till I leave
Whisper to they friends what they wanna do to me
Wish they could erase me, take away the air I breathe
And I feed 'cuz that shit only give me hunger pains
Never let you muhfuckas put out my flame
Ready for whatever, was trained to maintain
And I always been a savage 'bout the fame
Separate the girls from the women and the winnin'
Always knew the thrill was worth it from the beginnin'
Baby what's the deal I'm hurtin' 'em how I'm livin'
I gotta conquer it all now the world's my wishin'

And we ain't goin' nowhere 'till we lock the game

And now I need to hear y'all sing

Cheer up, back to the basics, I geared up
Settled this, stuck, and I'm here, what?
What you gonna do to take me out? Nothing!
But thank you cause you caked me out
Watched you, studied you, made me better
Played you, faded you, now they sweat her
Got through the door only cause they let her
Dose of the first was cool, but it gets better

Down South they'll tell you 'Kiss is good folk (that's right)
Up North I hit my niggaz off with good smoke
Out West they ridin with me, now I'm back hard

I'm just worried bout the rats that's in my back yard
Hated by many, confronted by none
I trust two guys, one's God, and one is my gun
Jada is the nice guy, 'Kiss is the monster

D-Block and Double are is my sponsor

Eve,"This is another one of those heartbreak hotel joints for the ladies
Why won't you grow up & be a man someday
I can't believe that you're still playing silly games
Now why do I put up w/ all this child's play
Now if your word is all you have
Then you ain't worth a damn thing

Promises you told me every day
That you made you never ever kept
By me I really want to believe
But not today, not today, not today, not today

You're the worst
I can't even depend on you
you say a lot of good things
But something else you always do
Be a man of your word
Try to love something other than you
But now you can be on your way
Cause I don't want you to stay

Promises bout our house
Bout the kids
Lifestyle we would live
Who the fuck you really is
In my face
All the time
Spittin' line after line
Broke down my wall and you got in my mind
You's a fake shoulda known
All the signs I was wrong
Believed what I saw
And your cover was blown
Breakup, leave
Make up, please
You's a magician all them tricks up your sleeve
Had me for a minute
I was in it
you played good
But I'mma get you
I'mma make moves
And I'mma leave you where you at dog, chill
Go back to square one
Wait for something real
Selfish nigga
Could have helped you nigga
Usually know betta but I felt you nigga
I guess getting in my head was a part of the plan
Cause in reality the only thing you giving me is

Promises you told me every day
That you made you never ever kept
By me I really want to believe
But not today, not today, not today, not today

Promises you told me every day
That you made you never ever kept
By me I really want to believe
But not today, not today, not today, not today

Don't let him waste your time girl
He's only telling lies girl
And when he apologizes (and he will)
Don't be believing that man
Cause he gon' do it again

Promises you told me every day
That you made you never ever kept
By me I really want to believe
But not today, not today, not today, not today",Not Today,2003

Could never claim to be a ganster nigga, just gangsta
Now take a sip 'a something, let me entertain ya
This funk is for them rowdy niggas liable to shank ya
A cock back blast, wit no questions asked
So just, hold tight, don't let the liquor run your whole night
Don't let a sucker into courage fuck up your whole life
I play the cut and analyze the view
Push up my glass just to acknowledge the chosen few
Cause I don't fuck wit many
Especially the tough ones off a glass of Henny
Especially the ones always frontin' that don't have a penny
I run wit niggas that demand respect
And I'm a boss bitch, most y'all can't handle that
All you can do is watch your glide
It take a special type 'a nigga 
'Bout something that can stop a stride
Cause I can't respect a nigga that's soft
And I bet y'all never seen it comin'

Crazy nights arguments
Running towards the door
Lying to myself, not wanting you no more
No matter what we been through
You're the man that I adore
You're the only one I need in this world, see
People used to tell me I was crazy
Told me not to give in
Told me that you would never love me
All I did is pretend
I told them mind their business
Cause they not in my position
When I said that I was in love
They said I was trippin
I cut the haters off and I got into my man
Cause I take him for all he is
And he takes me as I am
The way I feel about him
It was god's perfect plan
The only one I need and I'm his girl
So let me hear you say

Give a nigga up north some ass on a V.I.

Got the brand new spring Prada shit in the fall
Don't matter what size panties, fitting her small
And she don't got no problem hittin' us all
And she said she got a man, but he in the fed
And she miss him so much that she pee in the bed

Pushing the seat back gettin' right in the fall
Make her use a fake credit card twice in a store
Might make you do it tomorrow you triflin' whore

The way he looked into my eyes
What he doin' to me

He caught me by surprise
He opened up my life
He wasn't like them other dudes
I wanna be his wife

He said he got played
I told him don't be scared

Forget the rest, they ain't prepared

He took my hand
And put them to my hips

You can't get out yo mind
You go to sleep, he in your dreams
He with you all the time

This was the way it was
Thought it was meant to be
Till I picked up the phone one night
And it was Tiffany

She said he was her dude
I said is that a fact
She said I let him go and play
But he always come back

I said that can't be true
She said it always is
I hung up, heart stuck
No relationship

Eve,"I used to give you too much power
Trust me, them days is over
Can't understand how I
Let you sit on my shoulders
Them times when you messed up
I made escuses for
And I always knew it, that I should have headed for the door
But I stayed and you played the right way in your place
And I prayed everytime you was away you'd see my face
But the me was you, and your
Pain was mine, and the
Same situation playing over in my mind
It seems

Ain't tryna hear you
Just tryna hear me
Don't wanna hear nothing, baby it's selfishly
I blaming you for the hurt in me, but it's not your fault that
I'm so incomplete

You see everytime I do it do it
I seem to ruin
Got this funny way of falling in love
And it's effecting how I'm breathing
Effecting how I'm eating
Seems like I'm all up on drugs
So beg you my pardon
Loving you deep in my heart
And I can't take no more
I'm looking for the problem
Standing over the seek
One thing I found, I had to take a look in mirror
See I can't leave you, until I learn to leave me

What was I thinking
That you could talk to me like that
You was holding me down, but I was holding me back
Looking inside myself, and has to see who I am, cause this is my trial, affecting my smile
I'm gotta walk (?), this is gonna be a while

You see everytime I do it do it
I seem to ruin
Got this funny way of falling in love
And it's effecting how I'm brething
Effecting how I'm eating

One thing I found, I had to take a look in mirror
See I can't leave you, until I learn to leave me

Everything I thought I knew
All them times I ran away
You see, really I was running for me
I know constantly we're trying, we was living in a lie
Finally looked into mirror to see
Probably would have left you sooner, but I was being scared, that ain't how I ever should be
Yeah I was searching for a while for the sores of the problem
One thing I found, I had to take a look in the mirror",Mirror [*],2007

Eve,"Uh, uh, uh, huh, yo, yo
Drop your glasses, shake your asses
Face screwed up like you having hot flashes
Which one, pick one, this one, classic

Red from blond, yeah bitch, I'm drastic
Why this? Why that? Lips stop asking
Listen to me baby, relax and start passing
Expressway, hair back, weaving through the traffic

This one strong should be labeled as a hazard
Some of y'all niggas hot, sike I'm gassing
Clowns, I spot 'em and I can't stop laughing
Easy come, easy go, E V gon' be lasting

Jealousy, let it go, results could be tragic
Some of y'all ain't writing well, too concerned with fashion
None of you ain't gizell, cat walk and imagine
A lotta y'all Hollywood, drama, passed it
Cut bitch, camera off, real shit, blast it

And if I had to give you up, it's only been a year
Now, I got my foot through the door and I ain't going nowhere
It took awhile to get me in and I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear, now, let me blow your mind

They wanna bank up, crank up, makes me dizzy
Shank up, haters wanna come after me
You ain't a gangster, prankster, too much to eat
Snakes in my path wanna smile up at me

Now, while you gritting your teeth
Frustration baby, you gotta breathe
Take a lot more that you to get rid of me
You see I do what they can't do, I just do me

Ain't no stress when it comes to stage, get what you see
Meet me in the lab, pen and pad, don't believe
Huh, sixteens mine, create my own lines
Love for my wordplay that's hard to find

Sophomore, I ain't scared, one of a kind
All I do is contemplate ways to make your fans mine
Eyes bloodshot, stressing, chills up your spine
Huh, sick to your stomach wishing I wrote your lines

And if I had to give you up, it's only been a year
Now, I got my foot through the door and I ain't going nowhere
It took awhile to get me in and I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear, now, let me blow your mind

Let your bones crack, your back pop, I can't stop
Excitement, glock shots from your stash box
Fuck it, thugged out, I respect the cash route
Locked down, blasting, sets while I mash out

Yeah nigga, mash out, D are E
Back track, think back, E V E
Do you like that? You got to I know you
Had you in a trance first glance from the floor too

Don't believe I'll show you, take you with me
Turn you on, pension gone, give you relief
Put your trust in a bomb when you listen to me
Damn she much thinner know now I'm complete

Still stallion, brick house, pile it on
Ryde or Die, bitch, double are, can't crawl
Beware, 'cause I crush anything I land on
Me here, ain't no mistake nigga it was planned on

And if I had to give you up, it's only been a year
Now, I got my foot through the door and I ain't going nowhere
It took awhile to get me in and I'm gonna take my time

Still pushing buttons that'll do away the roof
Still walk around with 5 thousand dollar boots
So when I'm in the club the chicks get jealous
Cause I'm dat bitch that still keep a mean fetish
Still stack lettuce, still stack cheese
And I got a bad temper tell your nigga say please
Cause this is for the G's, never for the Busta's
So put your diamond rings on and get yourself a hustler
Better yet a customer, guaranteed to buy it
Sick from the lips, caramel wanna try it

High above the clouds
Swear I won't look back if I get chance
Oh, I won't come back around

Yo, have you ever laid in bed and it's late in the night
Staring at the ceiling talking to God about life?
Asking when it's gonna happen, just maybe it might
Made a lot of life turns, some wrong and some right
Wanna know when it's your second, your minute, your time
Sick of dreaming, wanna lay the pictures in your mind
Never been like all the others, you're one of a kind
I know you're feeling like you wanna break free, it's a sign
Just wanna fly above it all, see where you can land
Know that you can do it on your own cause you can
Know that you can conquer all with a plan
Forget about the negatives buried in the sand
Yeah, never forget this is your life
Your path, your dream, this is your fight
Victory you'll see, you'll be alright
Get through the darkness, on the other end is pure light

When I close my eyes
I can see me fly in the hope
High above the clouds
Swear I won't look back

I will come back around

I'm gonna make it out this time, yeah
I'm gonna roll the dice
And take a risk tonight
Gotta make it out this time

Have you ever felt alone like the whole world was missing?
And when you prayed it seemed like no one was listening
You try to keep the faith and keep on living
But when you struggling the future looks distant
All your hope seem to be just pipe dreams
And you really gotta wonder what your life means
That's when you gotta pick yourself up out the dust
Make a change and find a place in your heart you trust
You ain't always gotta take the first card your dealt
In this life only you can represent yourself
Never let your circumstances hold you back
You were born free, never gotta feel trapped
And on the pursuit to happiness you're gonna feel pain
But the only way to win is to stay in the game
The naysayers they're gonna try and embarrass ya
But I've learned that the struggle builds character

When I close my eyes
I can see me fly in the hope
High above the clouds
Swear I won't look back
If I get chance
I will come back around
If I make it out this time, yeah

(Goodbye)

[ VERSE 1: Everlast ]
Goodbye, it's over, it's through and done
Our relationship is no longer one on one
So I quit, girl, I don't need this
I'm disgraced cause in my face you spit
I caught you steppin out with another guy
And after givin you my love I deserve to know why
How long has this been going on?
How long have you been doin me wrong?
You thought I didn't know?
You thought I'd never go?
Well, that's why I'm makin this song
To say goodbye

(Na na, na na na na, he he hey, goodbye)
(Na na na na, na na na na, he he hey, goodbye)

[ VERSE 2: Everlast ]
Pack your bags and leave, get out of my sight
I won't share you with another man on any night
You tried to play me for a fool
But now you'll find that you been schooled
By the E and it's plain to see
You thought you had luck like a four-leaf clover
Your luck just ran out, homegirl, it's over
I hope you had a lot a fun
Were you lyin when you said that I was number one?
Well, I guess it doesn't matter
It makes no difference
I caught you with a smokin gun
Or so to speak, girl, you're a natural sneak
And the hand you dealt me was really weak
But that's alright, you won't see me cryin
I brush a girl off when I catch her lyin
So when I toss you out, don't dare ask why
Don't try to return with a tear in your eye
It's just my way of sayin - goodbye

(Na na, na na na na, he he hey, goodbye)
(Na na na na, na na na na, he he hey, goodbye)

[ VERSE 3: Everlast ]
Using me, confusing me, inside you're bruising me
You think I'll stick around so you keep abusing me?
Wise up girl, I ain't playin
You try to make it better sayin let's hit the hay and
Make love, then I'll know that you're loyal
But I can't take the stress, don't need the turmoil
You told me that you love me but it was a lie
You know that I care but I must say goodbye
Who is it you're thinkin about when we're kissin?
And when we're all alone is it him that you're missin?
I couldn't stand the feelin that I got
When I seen another man standin in my spot
Next to you, so what you want me to do?
Forget about it act like it never happened?
Turn the other cheek and wait to get slapped again?
Or until you say when, you're through with me
But you will see I'll be the first one to say goodb-why-e
So when I toss you out don't dare ask why
It's just my way of sayin - goodbye

(Na na, na na na na, he he hey, goodbye)
(Na na na na, na na na na, he he hey, goodbye)

[ VERSE 4: Everlast ]
I must admit it, you hid it well
Did you get your kicks puttin me through hell?
Runnin around with your new found child
He's not a man, he can't get wild
But that's alright, girl, you made your choice
And maybe by now you're sick of my voice
But it's too bad cause you made me mad
And I'ma show you all the things that you mighta had
Then you'll be the one feelin pain and misery
Regrettin the past (goodbye) cause you're history
So when I toss you out don't dare ask why
Don't tug at my sleeve as I walk by
Don't try to return with a tear in your eye
It's just my way of sayin - goodbye

A redness on my face
I tasted you
You tasted me

You were never my taste
Now left alone
With precious thoughts of half - assed half an hour stops
And talk so small I can't remember every single word

Laced with think naivete
Firm delusions can't be swayed
Tell yourself you're happy
We both know the truth

It's false behind the dirty talk
The dirty sheets
The sexy walk
Your eyes are closed

Your heart is open wide
And that's no good.
There is something up my sleeve
There is nothing in  between

You and me that you can't see
So beg my pardon.

Honesty's a virtue that can hurt you
Let it be
The thought that counts is
Counting down the minutes 'till I leave

And when I do you'll be looking for security in words
Though you know that you won't get it for the better
For the worse.

There is something up my sleeve
There is nothing in  between
You and me that you can't see
So beg my pardon

I apologize for me
Then I'm back in a couple weeks
I'm too weak to help it
Don't know how to end it

I apologize for me.

Eve 6,"Tell those stories to me
I'm dying to hear the things you've done and seen
Farfetched as they may be
You strike a smile in me
Your stories ring of perjury
Constructed of self empowering theme

{Chorus}
Sucking on my brain
You're the teacher, I'm the student
Turning things around
You story's not congruent
Tabloid decoys
Pitiful excuses
Turning things around
You're turning things around!

A manic stunning scene
I'm taking notes
You're taking me away
Into your false reality
I know your comfort lies in lying
To try to make your life make sense
But you're not making sense

{Chorus}

I'd say it aloud
But I'm not allowed
I see your head
Spin round and round
Broken record talk tonight
Skip that needle back and forth on your mind
Wearing out unconvincing lies

Like a seedling dropped from and old oak tree
Your shade don't hide no sun from me
Fake stories humor me
It's graduation time
I love you like a mother

{Chorus}",Leech,1998
Eve 6,"Tonight I feel ambitious and so does my foot 
as it sinks on the pedal
I press it to the floor
I don't need a girl, don't need a friend
Cause my friend Lonesome's unconditional
We're flying forever bored
And for a moment I love everything that I see and think and feel
I love my broken side view mirror
Cause it's so perfect I'm so perfect you're so perfect you're not here
I hear the change in gears

{Chorus}
My pile shakes as I hit eighty on the open road
This is an open road song

The night is beckoning
Although I have nowhere to go but home
Feels good to be alone
With every turn comes a new frame of mind
If I could frame my mind 
Where would it hang?

{Chorus}

I crack a window and feel the cool air cleanse my every pore
As I pour my poor heart out
To a radio song that's patient and willing to listen
My volume drowns it out
Yeah, but that's O.K. cause I sound better than him anyway, any day
Yeah, my voice is as sweet as salt
I search for comfort and I find it where I've found it many times before
Times before can be forgotten

{Chorus}",Open Road Song,1998
Eve 6,"Saturday night burns
A redness on my face
I tasted you
You tasted me

You were never my taste
Now left alone
With precious thoughts of half - assed half an hour stops
And talk so small I can't remember every single word

Laced with think naivete
Firm delusions can't be swayed
Tell yourself you're happy
We both know the truth

It's false behind the dirty talk
The dirty sheets
The sexy walk
Your eyes are closed

Your heart is open wide
And that's no good.
There is something up my sleeve
There is nothing in  between

You and me that you can't see
So beg my pardon.

Honesty's a virtue that can hurt you
Let it be
The thought that counts is
Counting down the minutes 'till I leave

And when I do you'll be looking for security in words
Though you know that you won't get it for the better
For the worse.

There is something up my sleeve
There is nothing in  between
You and me that you can't see
So beg my pardon

I apologize for me
Then I'm back in a couple weeks
I'm too weak to help it
Don't know how to end it

I apologize for me.

There is something up my sleeve
There is nothing in  between
You and me that you can't see
So beg my pardonThere is something up my sleeve

You and me that you can't see

Eve 6,"Cheap shot hocked straight to the ear drum
Is it some sick sign of affection?
Violated and singed with deceit
Disgust from my head to my hands to my feet
Your face, it gives a foul taste
Whether smiling, crying or denying
I see your motives 
and you're charged with fraud by me
So take the hint and leave

{Chorus}
I loved you while he was in you in the shower
Did (in joy and ecstacy) your eyes begin to water?

And if I may stop by when you're living in the next town
Ten years down the road
A good time for a dime and a crushed cigarette
Making bets with your body on the avenue
Look into my eyes you say
And you'll see nothing but sincerity
Almost as if you've got some hope that you'll enlighten me
You're a head case story

Just trust me you said
Just trust me you said!
Just trust me you said!!!

Find a sidekick pronto I should 
Think Thelma not Daria
So I search hard and near and far for 

Someone the description called for
Thought seldom not Daria
Found her in a suburban wasteland 
Swaddling clothed and caked in beach sand

At first sight thought that I might turn and 
Run out of fear and intrigue
I stood numb kind of military 
I'd found her I'd keep her

Safe and sound
Don't make a sound
Look up at the sky shit's going down
I heard a bang and stars collided

Her skin drew me in just like a magnet
Little girl my little world is yours

I took a one way highway headed West heaven bound
Never even thought once to turn round

Pointed fingers were left in the dust and The ones who doubted rusted

Now I'm looking at a picture where I'm right beside you
Eyes shine with a light that binds you
To this fool with Super Glue

From all the way across the nation
You came with just your name and 
Your suitcase I'll keep you

October light show bright through the windshield
Right into my eyes where I was silent riding shotgun
Chewing on some sugar free gum

I'll never leave her

I am just a little broken up
OK my nerves have never been so short

I'm asking why there is pleasure when there's pain
I'm here to pay for my mistakes in a humiliating manner
If there is a next time I'll cover up
I feel alone, I feel shaky and uncertian
A kind man shakes my hand and draws the curtain
In a word he saves my life and then
I exit out the enter door and smile
Can't get this shit off my mind
I just want to be alright
So just tell me nothing's wrong
Then get undressed and spend the night

I faced a fear of mine and shivered but didn't blink

And now I know that I'll be fine

It brings back a night of tropical splendor

And even the palms seem to be swaying

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Feeling like you can't go on?
Just remember love will find a way

Tell me, are you going through changes
Time seems like it's passing by
Just believe that love will find a way

I see the tears you cry
I see the pain that's in your eyes
So many times you were so lonely
And no one seemed to care

But if your hopes for your tomorrows
Are drowning in your sorrows
Know your heart will show you the way

Are you trying to find a beginning
Something just to hold on to?
Always know that love will find a way, yeah

Is it hard this life you're living?
Does the world seem so unkind?
Don't you worry, love will find a way

Some say the world has gone astray

There is nothing you can't do

'Cause problems will come
And they will leave you
The world will try to deceive you
But the truth will always be in your soul

Making plans was so much fun 
We set our goals and reached the highest star 
Things that we were after were much better from afar
Here we stand just me and you 
with everything and nothing too

Not knowing if we struggled life would treat us

Where life gon lead us
Knowing if we getting married
Our wife will need us
If at one time you could look into my mind
When I close my eyes and remember them times
No gas, had a hot plate heat our dinners
No cash, most nights ate sleep for dinner

Never enter my mind

I'm always doing something

'Cos I'm always doing something for the boys
Or they're doing something for me.

Back in the days of gifty giving
When all God's daddies had greens
I was oh so busy living

Long as my bank roll was buttered
But now my life's completely cluttered
With soldiers, sailors,
Not to speak of those big marines

Evelyn Evelyn,"Evelyn, Evelyn,
Why do we bother to stay?
Why are you running away?
Don’t you feel like severing?
Everything’s just come together at last
It’s broken, I don’t want to play

We grew up closer than most
Closer than anything, closer than anything
Shared our bed and wore the same clothes
Talked about everything, spoke about so many things

What shall we wear tonight? What shall we eat today?
Can we go ice skating? But we just did that yesterday
Should we be firemen? Can we be astronauts?
What if they find us? They’re not looking anyway

Fill my glass, let’s drink a toast
This is our birthday, so why are we weeping?
At your side, I feel like a ghost
I wake up first, and I stare at you sleeping

What shall we wear tonight? What shall we eat today?
Do you think I should marry him? But we just met him yesterday
Should we be movie stars? Will we be millionaires?
I want to be famous They're watching us anyway

We grew up so very close
A parasite needs a host
I’m only trying to do what is best for us
Well, I never asked for this, I never wanted this
All that I want is some time to myself
Looking in your eyes, I’m coming home
Just get away from me, please just stop touching me
You’re always trying to be somebody else
Now I realize I’m not alone
Well, you’re only scared of me
But you never cared for me
Why don’t you let me free?
‘Cause you’d never dare to be
‘Cause you never listen, you’re always insisting
(I’m just/just stop) reminiscing,
I feel something missing
I just want (you here with me my privacy),
God (can’t we just get along/won’t you leave me alone)?",Evelyn Evelyn,2010
Evelyn Evelyn,"You pulled up at the house at half past seven 
In your '69 Impala, you shook hands with my father 
And we stopped off at the drug store by the drive-in 
For some Trojans and a six-pack, but still your eyes 
Kept wandering back to her
It's always her
So let's get one thing straightened out here, sir

[Chorus]
If you think you're seeing double, let me save you some trouble
This ain't no two-for-one bargain here mister
'Cause I'm much more than just my side
Had enough of two-timing guys who only want me 
'Cause they want my sister

My eyes are just as blue as her's
My hair is just as fine, and that tattoo on her lower back's 
Exactly just like mine
But if you look beneath the surface
We're as different as can be
'Cause there's just one heart that beats for you and 
That heart belongs to me and not to her
It's always her 
So let's get one thing straight if I'm your girl

[Chorus]

Hoo-ooh

And if tomorrow you should die my sister would not bat an eye
She doesn't even know your name
She's going with some other guy
As long as she is still around I'll always have a trace of doubt
I need to know your love is real, but how?

We're all dressed up, the flowers sure are pretty
Mother pays her last respects I look around, no one suspects that it was me
I put some Drain-O in her coffee
Now that she is underground I'll know that you're not hanging
'Round for her, not for her
Now I know your love is true for sure

[Chorus]

It pains my heart to think of her a rotting
Stinking, maggot-infested, bloated and pus-oozing corpse that I leave her
You can't imagine just how much I miss her
But now I know you want me, not my sister",You Only Want Me 'Cause You Want My Sister,2010

Throw your rope up in the air

And left me all alone
With only memories

Through the mirror of my mind
Through all these tears that I'm crying
Reflects a hurt I can't control
Although you're gone
I keep holding on
To those happy times
Oh, girl when you were mine

As I peer through the windows
Of lost time
Keeping looking over my yesterdays
And all the love I gave all in vain
(All the love) All the love
That I've wasted
(All the tears) All the tears
That I've tasted
All in vain

Through the hollow of my tears
I see a dream that's lost
From the hurt baby
That you have caused

Everywhere I turn
Seems like everything I see
Reflects a hurt I can't control

Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song

It all seems like yesterday, not far away

All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book.
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

I got a guitar on Christmas day

And I know you love me too

Didn't start until
We left on our honeymoon

We stepped off the plane
Into a warm sunny day
And then we, got laid
Together

The sun shines down
On a Hana lei town
Where the fish all smile
Cause they know us

Our wedding day
Was warm and sunny
Our friends and family
Came from out of town

We said I do
Then ate some food
And smiled 
Until the sun went down

We'll take the Zodiac Cadillac
Around the north shore
Then we'll head back
The sea turtles come to greet us

So let's get loaded tonight
We'll drink on the flight
Back home

Threw my keys inside that window
And we never looked back

We got all drunk and sloppy on a Greyhound bus
We passed out cold so all them losers
They were laughing at us

I will never let them break your heart
I will never let them break me

We got lost in Phoenix
Seemed like such a long time
Seven months of living sweaty
On those thin white lines

I did some time
For selling acid to the wrong guy
Life just keeps on getting smaller
And we never ask why

Why there is no perfect place
Yes I know this is true

And that's not easy to do

I know there will come a day
When we can leave
And just go running away

When the storms came
I was working in New Jersey
Hitching rides in the rain

You was happy talking dirty
At that phone sex place

No I will never let it break your heart
No I will never let it break me

Five years down the line
We got married in the desert
In the sunshine

I can handle all the hell
That happens everyday
When you smile and touch my face
You make it all go away

Yes I know there ain't no finish line
I know this never ends
We are learning how to fall
And climb back up again

I know there is nothing perfect
I know there is nothing new
We are just learning
How to live together
Me and you

You know I live for the day

I'd ring you in the morning but the phone's been cut
Can you hear me, I've been calling all day
Can you hear me
The radio reporter said the line's all dead
He told me that I oughta write a letter instead
Can you hear me, I've been calling all day
Can you hear me 
Yes I'd wish they'd fix the wires cause my baby won't know
That I'm leaving in the morning and I'm ready to go
Can you hear me
Can you hear me at all
Gotta get the operator, make a telephone call 
And if I write a letter it won't get there on time
I'll only reach you baby on the telephone line

On that magic carpet ride last night

You'll still have to pay the price

We will be together
We will be together
(We will be together)

It's 5 AM on a Sunday morning
Walking uptown
In the rain in the snow
When I saw you
It came without a warning
A face like I had never seen
A feeling I had never known

Moving slow in the early morning
Making love in the quiet of the day
The world was waiting to take us to a new place
We knew that we were changing
We knew that we would never be the same

[Chorus]
I know
I would do it all over again
At the end of the day
When we are alone
I get that feeling when I see your face
And I know
You'll be there at the end of the day

Two years later we are living together
We built our dream house on a hill by the sea
We could see the shadows that were growing in the distance
We were hiding our eyes
We were blind to what we did not wanna see

[Chorus]

5 years gone by we have turned into strangers
We never talk now since you went away
Now I find myself walking in circles
I keep looking for you everywhere
Keep waiting for the end of the day

I know
I would do it all again
At the end of the day
When I'm all alone
I get a feeling that I can't explain
Oh, If I knew then what I know now
Wouldn't change a thing if I could somehow
I'd do it all over
Over and over again
I hope and I pray
We can do this all over again
At the end of the day
When I'm all alone
I close my eyes when I see your face
At the end of the day
when I'm all alone
I get a feeling that I can't explain
And I know
And I know
Yeah, we will be together someday

When we discovered romance, like we never knew.
My head was in the clouds, My heart went crazy too,
And madly I said: ""I love you.""

Too soon I heard you say:
""This dream is for a day""
That's Portugal and love in April!
And when the showers fell,
Those tears I know so well,
They told me it was spring fooling me.

When we discovered romance, like I never knew.
Then morning brought the rain,
And now my dream is through
But still my heart says ""I love you.""

That's Portugal and love in April!
The music and the wine convinced me you were mine,
But it was just the spring fooling me.

So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Down, down came the sun
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part
