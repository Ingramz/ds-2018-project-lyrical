Twista & the Speed Knot Mobstaz,"[Liffy Stokes]
The stress of everyday living is slowly corrupting my soul
I'm 2 months out the joint on papers walking with 3 years parole
I did 4 and a half a slab and shit a nigga was dying
I'm finally back in the world and its hard but I'm still trying

Not to fall and risk my freedom again trying to ball
While waiting for this pussy ass job to call
And it ain't hopping 
Got me tipping to hear them things popping

Cash bags dropping 
With plenty of cane for recopping oppurtunity knocking
Its what I'm on
I cry when I'm at home cause I'm alone

24 years and grown with a future unknown
My heart was torn from the pain of being back in the game
But I'd rather die getting my hussle on and live like a lane
So its back to pistols and cane

Plotting on licks hitting stains
The mob life runs through my veins
Its too late for me to change
These streets got me deranged

Strapped up and paranoid
Ready to add on situations I can and can't avoid
Plus big voices getting hot
They constantly sneaking on blocks

They trying to bring me in unconscious
But them pins got popped
Now they got me on the run
Cherishing every last breath

But I ain't going back
Its freedom or death
That be my motive for murder

[Chorus]
[Liffy Stokes]
Now I know you the judge of life and death
I ain't evil or nothing 
But somebody done brought me pain and sorrow 
So I'ma have to kill something 
Let me count the ways that I can repent 
Trying to stay holy and focused
But that evil in his eyes let me know that nigga too bogus 
That be my motive for murder

[Twista]
I'm a survive these streets another day
I know the pain in my heart won't go away
These mother fuckers try to murder me 
And won't nobdy hurt my family 
That's what he gotta die

[Mays]
9 times out of 10 you can find Mays trying to hit a better lick
If it ain't coming up with the dopest shit
Then I'm trying to cop the thickest brick
'Cause life in the belly of the best

Is equal to povertys bottomless pit
Where bitch niggas trick 
And thirsty mother fuckers beat you out of everything you get
But it seems like everybodys trying to make some type of come up quick

Before its too late to get straight
And the most I make is final pick
Anywhere they shit like riding slick
With a thick chick slobbing your dick

Even if it means fighting these niggas in cases
As long as neither ones thick
'Cause I swear when I get hit 
I go in a crucial rage like a flick

Turn straight lunatic
Making all these bitches niggas hear their final tick
But that don't mean my minds sick
Just cause I'm motivated by a lot of cheese

When trees by the p's
And fuckin' fine fee's and 3's with ease
For sure the skilled poets
Within in the mask up kill for it

I'll whoop a fiend with a crushed grill
I'll bet his dumb ass will still blow it
Bullshit ain't nothing
I'm trying to get this first mil in the bank

And drive a bullet-proof hummer tank
So the next haters who try to air me out come up blank
And I'm a have to sacrifice your life
With a wrath that's stronger than christ

And forces of life that's know to do damage to human eyesight
I guess its true
Moneys the route of all evil
'Cause crooked or legal

It's all manipulated by the eagle
And be my motive for murder

[Chorus]

[Twista]
Lord knows I was hurt from a judge from the start
How I'm a hide love from this mark
This nigga made my homie die in my arms
Had to put a slug in his heart

Mother fuck that stuff
It was just a grudge on his part
My boy was young and ambitious
Took his dreams and wishes

Try to do right but my attitude like blast them bitches
Drowning all my sorrows in bottles of yack
And a quarter ounce of dro want a rap
I'm bout to snap

Here come the big pay back
Looking up on the dresser for the black and gray strap
I'm crying and shit
I was hurt so bad I felt I had to go kill him

Even if a slug hit him
I was still hurt enough to aim at myself and die with him
Can't control them pains
Now its time to throw them things

Visions of the stud don't stay
Empty the clip of am out right
Ambulance come around
By the time the hypes

Taking of his nikes
I know it sound cold
But this bullet put a hole in my soul
Never shorties years stole

He was only 17 years old
And at the funeral I got to watch his mama's tears roll
And I know he used to wild sometimes
Carry a 9 but you took away your sunshine

No more reminiscing on the fun times
Balling and coming at bitches with blunt lines
But this nigga ain't going to want mine
For the pain I'm a handle this funk and dismantle this junk

Fuck all that
In all black and then pumped
To run up on this nigga 
Tip up on him then jump

Mission to kill armed with a fist full of steel
Eyes gleam with the fury
Never thought I'd be facing to 2 mothers
In front of a prosecuting team and a jury

How did one murder turn into 2
Revenge had me shooting through hate
I couldn't stop 
In the mist of the action 

Is when that little ? got shot
All because of my motive for murder

[Chorus]",Motive 4 Murder,1998
Twista & the Speed Knot Mobstaz,"You looking chilly wit yo thick ass
I know you got plenty niggas out there who trick cash
I damn near caught whiplash as you walked pass
Fucked up the blunt ashes
Peepin' your script perpetrating you high
Youz a rat in disguise I see the freak in you eyes
You got between your thighs from fuckin' to many guys
And yet still you play the sweet role but we know
That you juggle dicks like slot machines at a casino
I'm high as hell so I'm flaotin'
Up in the party tokin'
A 44 max and nigga don't jack
Cause I blast away fuck up a niggas whole day
Get the wildin' and shoot this bitch up in the party
Mobsta style you ain't had a thug in a while
I hit her wit the proposition as she's peepin me out
So what's the lick shorty? Fuck the game me or the lane
She hoped in the Range and then her attitude changed
She said ""I know you fool you one of them Mobsta niggas""
""Who rap wit Twista, where's he at"" fired up wit some liquor
Hold tight shorty we almost at the City Inn 
I told Maze about the lick soon as he buzzed me in

[Chorus: x2]
Baby if you want to party tonight 
then let me see you touch your toes
And show me you a party hoe
I got my niggas you got your girls 
cause bitch we fucked the world and how do we hurl
Only if you partying hoe

I gotta confess I think I'm obsessed wit group sex
Yo lets have a contest and see who do it the best
Inside of Nubian flesh make me want to get undressed
Tap that ass from the back cause baby your bodies blessed
And your friend to she bend too
Bust out some ginseng brew so I can dick your whole crew
That's the shit I'm into pass some pussy to my guys
Put my dick in your mouth shoot the loogy in your eye
I don't want to socialize I'm just trying to get bucked
So after you get fucked you hoes gotta raise up
Bumpin' out just blaze up big ol' B and the T's
Kick off the party wit you and your homies or your knees
While y'all party to see who got the most superb herb
Nigga Stokes gonna stroke that ass wit the killa curb
Till sober and then do it over again
Cause who ever taste the most dick is the one to win
So open them thighs wide while a nigga slide in
Let me see how many different ways your body can bend
Trippin' on Liff spinnin' your girl like he gonna miss her
While I'm opening the door for my niggaro Twista

[Chorus]

Oh gody what a sexy body you likes to party bitch come on get bucked
I gots to get some if I can't bust one gots to get fucked
Immaculate love get wit the look up at the ceiling lens
A pen of friends bring the Rhemy in I'm sinner sinning sin
Come up inside surprise pour Heny in a glass
Pretties is fast I'm glad squeezing titties and ass
Freakin' at last Maze and Liff happy ever so horny
And one of them bonin' what I'm gonna do now all of them want me
They slobbin' and bobbin steady mobbin' and globbin'
like they slob whenever they party
But this big fat thick bitch made my dick hard
No that its swollen she choking 
while her cheeks parted open the bitch started stroking
And I'm hoping the girl is hot and soakin', play wit her emotions
Talk about a Chi-Town po pimp
Let's flash the gold and whether or not get the dough gotta grab fo' fin
Mo' freaks came thinking I don't want 'em I show
I got a gun, put you mouth around my scrotum and hold 'em
And catchin' me bring that ass to me I have to see
Maze broke after me all of us going Ugh!! like Masta P
Boys is laughin' cause we got the girls partying up

Twista & the Speed Knot Mobstaz,"Haha, heh, last time for the mobsta
Get up in here and do our thang, heh
That's how we gon' do
Hahahaha

[Twista]
Get down to the club
Chokin' on sticky and everything was loved, oh yeah
Look here now
Then on came the lights, hey
All the niggas and bitches in the party was feelin' high
Liffy Stokes bring it

[Liffy Stokes]
Tonight's gon' be the bomb, it's warm and calm
I got to take this cool in my arm with an ounce in my palm
I done took the bottle with Don, and I'm back for sure
Actin' a fool, gettin' skully, mixin' henny and mo
With plenty to draw, and we gotta blaze by the door
With too much M to the O from rushin' the dance floor
Mob style runnin' wild through every section and aisle
Drinkin' River, pissy now, collectin' numbers to dial
Talkin' loud, flash the cheese just for the haters and keys
That try to catch me sooner so they can cease without the cheese
Through mobstability, y'all be killin' me
With that weak shit, a nigga just came to party
With my guys and women probably pitchin' couple of innings
Break em down through my winnings and come out Detroit grinnin
With my paper and ladies on the E doin' about eighty
Tryin' to get to the (?) so that freaky bitch can lay me

[Chorus]
When the mobstas rock y'all spot
Watch all the niggas and bitches start dancin'
Big ballers wave y'all knots
'Cause y'all the ones playa haters can't stand with
The mobstas rock y'all spot
Watch all the niggas and bitches start dancin'
Big ballers wave y'all knots
'Cause y'all the ones playa haters can't stand with

[Mayz]
I'm bendin' curves through the gym straight smokin' and drinkin'
Westside, mob style, and the mink and the lickin'
Trippin' on the cutie that's winkin'
'Cause she know we got the shit that rocks her block
And put the boom in your box and make your speakers pop
So I take this as my cue to make sure shorty don't snooze
The mobsta's rockin' tonight at the House of Blues
With some mo and some crews and now she lookin' in dues
Talkin' about bringin' our homies and puttin' on dancin' shoes
It's like that y'all, let your paper stack tall
So when you hit the club you can ball and get some numbers to call
Don't worry about the playa haters leanin' on the wall
Because when they get the gold and start to ball
They gonna have to fight us all to the end
Playas get a glass and a set of twins
In different clothes so they can be a thug's extend
'Cause when this party ends another begins it don't stop
So flash your knot and beep me at my guy's red shop

[Chorus]
[Twista]
Hey hey, oh suki-suki now, look here now, what's cookin' now
Shook it shook it, child, shake it down, let's boogie now
From the hood and I be the chief, feelin' good as taters and waiters
With playas with the ladies pullin' up in big-ridin' Mercedes
This party gon' fade me, smokin' with the brokes and the brothers
Cherry gators, yo dawg, this pocket's full hundreds and rollers
I'm kickin' it out with tippin' dippin' off from the laws
In the glance of an eye with drawers, while they hustlin' just to ball
(?) so I bought a drink, sport a link, recall the mink
Hoe figure she was pretty and think maybe I ought to wink
And she takes a glance, party'a boomin' so maybe I got a chance
This cutie got too much booty and I asked her to dance
Flippin' 50s in my hand, champagne all up in my face
Takin' pictures, (?) close 'em all bitches' probably in the place
Straight po pimpin', I'm trippin' (?) it's the weekend
Steady quickin', take a pimpin' and pay the scraps for sneakin'

Ain't no reason to say no, all I want is a good time 
By getting in the 50 yard line and bump and grind 
We can get our grub on but I ain't spendin' a dime 
Except for (..?..) Swisses and wine 
I want to drink until we're boozed at the match of playin' (?) 
While I'm takin' you to school we can trip and get cool 
And talk about how fun it is to break the rules 
Then you do these fantasies to try something new 
Baby let me sell you the dream and make 'em come true 
It ain't all about sex but we can do that too 
Get you something to go back to tell the girls in your crew

Push on that pack tell 'em niggas I'll be back 
I got a green broke down for some else to grab 
A bitch in school, kicked off the piece and loot

Hoes swoop like troops to dive in while I'm drivin' 
Got a wave and choosin' a slick nigga who's rotten 
Bumpin' it feels good, chokin' on backwoods 
With a pocket full of scraps, the sun beams on the wood 
It used to be henny but now it's remy (?)

Twista & the Speed Knot Mobstaz,"[Liffy Stokes]
It's like I got the 4-4 cocked
On the block in it two door dropped
And my spot is keepin but hot
The pussy-ass cop throw some murder in the lot
My nigga got popped with a bullet that was meant for me
The adapt by T's and be	's and the regencies
Fuck what the reason be, I'ma start squeezin these
Them niggas ain't G's, they want to be thugs
And it ain't shit, these ain't no motherfuckin slugs
The fools and plugged plus ain't no hoes over here
I done dropped more dead bodies than tears
Brought to life momma's worst fears
Pictures of a son dyin from that hot ones flyin
Baby mama's cryin at the funeral
Cause the magnum lit him like a Black & Mild
When I rolled out on his ass on the solo
I caught him up on mo-mo cookin up co-co
I got to tip on the low-low 
Bust it there like po-po takin lives with the, oh no
It's a 4-4, mini-missile with a silencer for the whistle
My favorite pistol, cause when I let that bitch ride
I know the homicide is being carried out in official 
Niggas steady bumpin guns, but don't want none
Because of these hot ones that explode on contact
A manic that's prepared to die in combat
Besides all that a 4-4 keeps me laced, don't be petty to say
I can see the fear in your face 
as I reach my waist for this warm embrace

[Chorus]
I got plenty love for the 4-4
But when I pick it up, I don't want to let it go
Because a nigga straight lovin' your warm embrace
I got plenty love for the 4-5
But when I pick it up, I don't want to let it ride
But still I bust 'cause I survive from your warm embrace
I got plenty love for the nine-mill
And when I pick it up, I don't really want to kill
But still I bust because I'm needin' your warm embrace
All you muthafuckas better duck and hide
Before I let it ride, the sucka stepped aside
Still I bust because I'm lovin' your warm embrace

[Mayz]
I love the element of surprise when I'm taking these hoes lives
With my customized 4-5
Get enough ammunition to knock off you, your crew and some more guys
You muthafuckas better get wise
Make sure your first shot is sweet, tryin to kill the elite
Cause you ain't gettin no more tries
Hate to make a nubian mother weap, but fuck it
Long as I don't hear the hoe cry
Split a beam between his eyes and make that bitch nigga so wise
No matter what the size of the warm embrace of my forty-five
Make sure the nigga crossed through dies
You don't want to throw them thangs
Cause when I cocked and aim it's time to think in a split second time
But Mayz ain't new to the game
I use the spark when the shots light up this thunderin crime
But niggas get bucked for dime and it's like you're a magnet for sin
Punk pretend to be your friend til they get close enough to your ends
To do you in, that shit puts me on ten
And make me want to put the barrel of this solid fiend
Upon under that nigga's chin, plus he talkin big shit about war
Like he don't know my Speedknot Mob gon' win
But I dare one of you niggas to say my name
Cause I put a fuckin bullet into your closest kin
Just to get under your skin like a dirty syringe
Plus I know you can't win with a gun or a pin
So when you see Mayz come in the place you better say your grace
Before I fuck up your face like a can of mace
Before I get disgraced, I'ma catch a case
Maybe you hoes fear the wrath of my warm embrace

[Chorus]
[Twista]
With you my passion, nina squeeze off seventeen, for sure
Hold you ever so tightly, I love you nina and never want to let you go
Miss Millimeter's makin a mockery of motherfuckers gotsta be ruckus
When I get my clutches upon this hoe
Itchin' to let the barrel blow
Like a sparrow, how it flow, like an arrow, geronimo
Spit 'em up and swallow slow
I reload, clippin' your ass crack, you constantly blast back
Payback from flashback, some bitches know
Bust 'til I see the chrome from the intro
You was fucked from the phasin', deep with the cuts and abrasion
Erupts and amazin', nigga, my nina bucked
Fuck the gazin and enemies get tore up from the blazin
Fool you be burnin' them with your black ass
Murderous hips, hurtin' the grips, ride on personal list
Deposition die for servin' them six
Everyone of 'em with a hit but some are missin' of a jerk to the kick
'Cause I be working my bitch
Tryin' to pimp her but she a wild and a tame thang
Kick a static on when she gangbang, blast in the fullest moon
Niggas better pull it soon or else suffer hellafied bullet wounds
And even though I stay clubbed with some thugs, why call 'em stug
When it comes to her love, it's none above she drawin blood
Static under the bra 'cause everytime I take a hit at the bud
And give you a hug you gon' pop up a slug
Drinkin' remy on the block, gotta bust the glock
When the henny hit the chest, bustin' smith-n-wess
Fuck the discussion, I'm bustin' 'em all, clutchin' my balls
If I see y'all be laid to rest, let me hit the sess
Loose revolver used to be a problem solver
But the nina made me a baller
No strap could take the place of the black nine
Leave 'em flat lines, feelin' fury, you was born to taste
From my warm embrace

[Chorus]
I got plenty love for the 4-4, 4-4, 4-4
Warm embrace
I got plenty love for the 4-5 (4-5), 4-5 (4-5), 4-5
Warm embrace
I got plenty love for the nine-mill (Nine-mill), nine-mill",Warm Embrace,1998

All into good rushin', touchin', better roll when I flush 'em 
I'm causin' concussion, sportin' pellet, come here baby 
My way will change, I used to kinda rugged my day 

Let's dance, while we get our groove on I get known 
If it's on, then Lexus she gon' get home 
First get bucked up and sip on 
G on the room and drink po wine up in the whirlpool 

Don't leave my comb and pearl too 
Leavin', let the girl cool my world, ooh 
I like to get down, straight up you're freaky 
You want to meet me, just beep me, take the (?) and weakling 

Drop the top and leave haters wishin' the (..?..) 
Let's keep it a hood thang, you get busy on wool grain 
I treat you precious as diamond rings, so don't cut me up 
I start the fussin', I'ma get the bustin', now no thang, I gotta give it up 

'Cause all your love can make the hardest thug cry like a dove 
Pull my mink over your shoulders when we leave out the club 
Ain't no need to knock a con, I'm feelin' like Chaka Kahn 
She the bomb like Lebanon, still fine with no Revlon 

Just let the Don inside, I promise pleasure and sweat 
I guarantee you ain't gon' be no regrets

Here she comes with them big legs, no fat on the back 
What's up shorty, can we kick it tonight and choke on the sack 

Come see as I foreplay, freaky at this slow-ass track 
Big and black, had attention ready to dig in that 
So what we just met, that don't mean I won't give you respect 
I just fight the temptation to get your body real wet

Tryin' to fall too, I got tall brew, it's all you 
Or like I be, let's shoot up to the club, like two tattoos

Do that fool, do that, do that, who that creeps on my hood 
Do I see my nigs thuggin' but, dawg, y'all lookin' good 
Ballers please, it's a straight playas party, can't fuck with these 
Champagne and Henessies for my G's and stuck a piece, and uh 

Haters please, no bustin' we up in place 
Put 'em in the trunk, the flame 
When I'm tryin' to get up with ""what's her name""

Twisted Brown Trucker,"I need somebody won't you help me
I need somebody won't you tell me who I am
I've been livin' a lie so long it seems I've lived a life time
If you could see what I feel it would make your ghetto lood like heaven 

And I believe it stems down from my family situation
I never liked my old man
I couldn't stand to be around him 
Sometimes I sit all alone just starin at his picture, yeah
My heart turns to stone and I think of this 

I need somebody won't you help me
I need somebody won't you tell me who I am
You never loved me, you never held me tight
Instead you shook me like a beast to wake me up at night 
You tried to make me think that your ways were best
When all I was was an outlet for all your stress 

Life it's the ultimate sin
A game with no rules that you're expected to win 
My personal hell's hidden with a grin 
Dad take the stand and let the trial begin

You said that oil and water don't mix though it seems cool
Keep with your own and don't f*** up our gene pool 
You should've went to school like your bigger brother
But you played the fool with a different color 

Runnin' ship with a whip
I tried to keep up but I kept getting tripped 
Money made you so wise
How could you look through my face and not see your own eyes 

Do as I say and not as I do
But I can't 'cause when I look in the mirror I see you
And oh the pain how it hurts
It was always your home and your business that came first 

You said a man is as good as his word
But your mind was closed and mine never heard 
My visions blurred, thoughts obscured
And with my blinders down I strain from the heard

They say the nut don't fall far from the tree
Look at you then look at me... 

You ain't nothin to me you've never been to me
And all you ever gave a damn about was money see 
So now f*** you man you ain't s*** to me
And it's the day that I die of this hate that I'm free 

Now I know growin up son that it ain't always been easy
And I know at times I was not always there for you 
No we never spent much time just talkin or havin a good time
But understand growin up son I never had a dime 

So I worked my a** off and I put myself through college
And everything I have to this day you know I built it all 
Oh I wish I could go back and change the years that's lost between us
I wish I could take back some of the things I said to you 

Son I said I'm sorry but still you resent me so
Son I said I'm sorry and why do you resent me so

I always loved you I always cared for you
Just never wanted you to go through what I've been through 
I tried to raise my f***in family just the best I know
And now I'm hated like the devil and for why I don't know 
Dah...

Alright, get down baby
Yeah...

I need somebody won't you help me
I need somebody won't you tell me who I am 
I need somebody please, please help me
I need somebody you must tell me who I am

Twisted Brown Trucker,"Well, I'm a-packin up my game and I'ma head out west
Where real women come equipped wit' scripts and fake breasts
Find a nest in the hills, chill like flynt
Buy an old drop-top, find a spot to pimp

Then I'ma Kid Rock-it up and down ya' block
With a bottle of scotch and watch lotsa crotch
Buy a yacht with a flag that says ""chillin' the most""
Then rock that bitch up and down the coast

Give a toast to the sun
Drink with the stars
Get thrown in the mix
And get tossed outta bars

Sift to Tiajuana
I want to roam
Find motown telephones and come back home
Start an escort service for all the right reasons

And set up shop at the top of four seasons
Kid Rock, and I'm the Real Mccoy
And I'm headed out west, sucker 'cause I want to be a

Cowboy, baby
With the top let down and the sunshine shinin'
West Coast Chillin' while the boone's whinin'
I want to be a Cowboy, baby
Ride at night 'cause I sleep all day
Cowboy, baby, I can smell a pig from a mile away

I bet you'll hear my whistle blowin' when my train rolls in
It goes""hooy-hooy-hooy"" Like dust in the wind
Stoned pimp, stoned brew, stoned out of my mind
I once was lost but now I'm just blind

Palm trees and weed
Scabbed knees and rice
Get a map to the stars
Find Heidi Flice

And if the price is right
Then I'm gonna make my bid
And let Californi-A
Know why they call me

West Coast Chillin' while the boone's whinin'

Yeah
Kid Rock, you can call me Tex
Rollin' sunset women with a bootle of becks
See a slimy in a 'Vette, roll down my glass

And said ""yeah this dick fits right in yo' ass""
No kiddin', gun slingin', spurs hittin' the floor
Call me hoss, I'm the boss, with the sauce, and the horse
No remorse for the sheriff and his eye ain't right

I'ma paint his town red then I'ma paint his wife white
'Cause chaos rock like Amedeus
Got west-coast pussy for my Detroit playas
Mack like mayors, ball like Lakers

They told us to leave but bet they couldn't make us
Why they want to pick on me?
Lock me up and throw away my key
I ain't no cheat, I'm just a regular failure

I'm not straight out a' compton, I'm straight out the trailer
Cuss like a sailor, drink like a mick
My only words of wisdom are just ""suck my dick""
I'm takin' my pick

Up and down that and keep on truckin'

To gettin' much respect from top record execs

So shut up now or put my balls in your mouth
Bet that ass, hoss, I ain't forgot
When I was tossed in the dime bin and left to rot
Used to call me funny when my nose was fucking runny
Now my fuckin' bunnies gettin' fuckin' Matchbox 20 money
Motherfuckers want to claim they're down
But when I was broke and down I never seen 'em around
All the shit we talked, all the shit we dreamed
I did it without you, I got a brand new team
No triple beams, it seems like a movie
Bought two cribs, drop-top, and jacuzzi
No more floozies, only high-class hoes
A couple when it rains and a few when it snows
A brand new nose to go along with my habit
And a garden hose made out of twenty-four karat
Bought a couple parots that like to squak
And they sound like you and all the shit you talk
Step inside my shoes, you couldn't fill em' doc
You're too old to kid, too soft to rock
I already did what most love to shout
Seven years on wax and I still ain't sold out

Out strecthed hands and one night stands

Still I can't find love and when the walls are tumbling down
I will always be around
Yeah...

And when the walls are tumbling down I will always be around
People don't know about the things I say and do
They don't understand about the shit I've been through
It's been so long since I've been home

I've been gone, I've been gone way too long
Maybe I've forgotten all the things I miss
Oh, somehow I know there is more to life than this
I've said it too many times and I still stand firm

You get what you put in and people get what the deserve
Still I ain't seen mine, no I ain't seen mine
I've been given but just ain't gettin' I've been walkin that thin line
So I think I'll keep a  walking with my head held high

I'll keep moving on and only God knows why
Only God, Only God, Only God knows why
Only God knows why,why,why,why
Only God knows why

Different girl every night at the hotel
I ain't seen the sunshine in three damn days
Been fueling up on cocaine and whiskey
Wish I had a good girl to miss me
Oh I wonder if I'll ever change my ways

[Chorus: x 2]
I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you 
While I'm lying next to her
I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her

I called you last night in the hotel
Everyone knows but they won't tell
But their half-hearted smiles tell me something just ain't right
I've been waiting on you for a long time
Filling up on heartaches and cheap wine
I ain't heard from you in three damn nights

I wonder where you've been 
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to him

I wonder where you've been
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to him

I saw you yesterday with an old friend

It was the same old same how have you been

Since you've been gone my world's been dark and grey

You reminded me of brighter days

I hoped you were coming home to stay
I was headed to church

I was off to drink you away

I thought about you for a long time
Can't seem to get you off my mind
I can't understand why we're living life this way

I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways
I just called to say I want you to come back home

Twisted Brown Trucker,"15 years on this lonely road
I paid my own way
I carried my own load
I never ask too much from no one

I was much too proud
All I ever wanted
Was to play my music for a sold out crowd
Bitches money fame

They say I had it all

I walked around like I was 10 feet tall
Did you see me shine

Hope it's been kind to you
Stand strong in the storms of life
The sun will always shine on you
Now I've been rollin' on love and lust

I ride around on this million dollar bus
But this bus is just a bus man
I can't sleep at night
Man I miss my babies

And I'd really like to fuck my wife
But she ain't here tonight

After the lights go down

I've seen this train wreck
Time and time again

I felt It's pain
I've seen it take my friends
You've got to stop and take a look man
Or life will pass you by

Get you a guitar and a good song
That's all you really need to ride
On that rock n' roll pain train
I can't slow it down

The music and the whiskey
Don't it make you want to get loud

You think your makin' it too hard

I know that I can hide no matter what you do or what you say to me
I keep fightin'
And know this shit is fucked up

Back on up 
When I'm roll up my sleeve
Forget this pain that's takin' over me
I'm comin' on by my side 
Its Friday night and I'm ready to rock so bring it on 

Its over
Cause its over
Cause its over now

I go on about my day 
Hopin' everything's ok

I will never ever hide 
And its locked inside my brain

Reach out your hands to me
I understand you because I feel the same

A local stranger from the neighborhood
Those little kids, oh, he left behind
With their mangled lives and their tortured minds
Since he didn't seem to care, then don't you think it's only fair

Call for street justice
Let no mercy show
Call for street justice
Don't let him go

The man was caught and brought before a judge
Who had just returned from a three drink lunch
His lawyer screamed ""you must set him free""
And off he went on a technicality
Since the law don't seem to care, then don't you think it's only fair

Call for street justice
Why should parents cry?
Call for street justice
How many have to die?

[Solo: Jay Jay]

The mob assembled, smoke filled the air
And marched in anger to do what's fair
To bring to justice this soulless thing
And show the others what evil brings
Now before you shake your head, think if it was your child instead

Call for street justice, tell me what you'd do
Call for street justice, pray this isn't true
Call for street justice, why should parents cry
Call for street justice, how many have to die
Call for street justice, when slime escapes the law
Call for street justice, we'll even up the score
Call for street justice, let no mercy show
Call for street justice, please don't let him go

This dream to come true
And as it approaches
I can´t believe I´m through

I´ve tried, oh
How I´ve tried
For a life, yes a life
I thought I knew

Oh it´s the price we gotta pay
And all the games we gotta play
Makes me wonder if it´s worth it to carry on
'Cause it´s a game we gotta lose
Though it´s a life we gotta choose
And the price is our own life until it´s done

Time seems to have frozen
But the mind can be fooled
As the days passed I discovered
Destiny just can´t be ruled

Hard times, oh
Hard times
For the price, yes the price,

Oh it´s the price we gotta pay
And all the games we gotta play
makes me wonder if it´s worth it to carry on

He examined those who leered
Then he cleaved the air
With his fiery stare
Rend all those there

Make your choice now for tomorrow may be far too late
And then you'll burn in hell

Dispised by the rest of the world, 'cause of my axe
The freaked out raps, and the bugged ass contacts
Not normal, nothin' in comparison
Stop frontin' bitch, you's embarrisin' (HOE)
separated from the rest at birth
And the blood in my viens is cursed
I'm leavin' the Earth, represented by killas and juggalos
And all that don't know should die like some dumb hoes
My contingent mind state spreads quicker than the cold in most states
And I hope you both hate (HATER)
Can't stop what you can't see
I'm slippin' in through your backdoor, tyin' up your family
Unexpected, and unexplained
I'm underground, and I'M INSAAAAANE
People want to talk the talk, but I'mma walk the walk
And even chalk the chalk, bitch

[Hook]

[Monoxide Child]
I'm different like I never exsisted
Different like that 50 pack, smokin' bud toker from Twiztid
I'M DIFFERENT, like I'm segregated
No, hold up, fuck that, a better word is ""Player Hated""
DIFFERENT, 'cause it's so for real
And if you fuck with weak shit, the axe I'll wield
I said DIFFERENT, you can see it in my soul
I'm different 'cause I'm Twiztid for life wit' juggalos

[Jamie Madrox]
We walk through walls, sleep with bats
Been to Heaven and Hell and still can't relax
I'M DIFFERENT, at least my mama called my strange
Said that I would be dangerous if I was given a brain
I'm a serial killa, that's what I amounted to be
And there's more than a thin line between you and me
I live behind the mirror and I'm every bad dream
So believe what you heard and see, because I'm different

I was born an accident, off the ripper
Free spirit but a mind drifter
Vampire labeled me the blood sipper
Wit' an X in the middle of my head, the fallen son
Gravewalker, leader of a legion of killas and soul stalkers
Midnight Marauders
We put the world in a submission
We told all of y'all to listen
Twiztid monistic superstition
Transforming, like a shadow in the dark, I float by
Looking at you dead in the eye
Time to wake the dead on up and ring the alarm
I got you bitches shaking and nervous with sweaty palms
From the beyond
Lands where mortals will never roam
Homeless in a pitchblack room all alone
separated, until death, do it's own
So I create and populate the dead zone

Banished to purgatory, but a life of heaven and hell

Twiztid,"Galacto Inspector do you read me?
Yes Captain
Status?
Completed
Your mission was to land on the Dirtball and explore it thoroughly.
You were to monitor the activities of a common life on the Dirtball,
And study peoples life styles,
Their general habits of living in their strange society.
Yes
Have you done that Galacto Inspector?
Yes I have Captain
Very well, may we have your report?
A strange place this Dirtball is
A lot of guns a lot of rich folks spitting on bums
A lot of hoodlums
These are just the bums that are really pissed off
Why? Probably 'cause they been ripped off by the system
Cops, they ride around in little cars
And throw folks behind bars, like little jars.
They supposed be there just to serve and protect,
But they just punch faces a lot, and choke necks.
Then they got the higher ups they call judges, and they rule the land.
This I don't understand.
First of all they like to dress this bitch up in a robe.
On top of all that, ""What?"" he's mad old.
And he hates anybody that looks different then he did back when he was a kid,
But that shit was like 400 years ago.
Captain ""Yes Galacto"" I just don't know.
Any kid that was going to jail. Yeah?
He looked me dead in the face and said 'Stale'
Then my cloaking device must of went dead. Why?
Cause the old ass judge looked at me and said:
This is our world
This is our world
This is our world
This is our world
So get the fuck out
(x2)
Very interesting, thank you Galacto Inspector
Now probes Data and Data, do your read me?
Yes, here sir
What information were you able to gather for us on your recent voyage to the 
Dirtball?
This is professor Data
My transmission signal is weak and my communication is shattered.
We came in contact with several different specimens of life.
Everything has got a price even if it's wrong or right.
Upon sight people judge and stereo type.
Their forms of government and religion are glorified.
Purified as the waters that are now polluted.
Members of the flock recruited for duty, locked up, or instituted.
This is doctor Data I phase with the planet to see how they medicate her.
She's high off that cane.
Depending how you slang you can get most anything.
From a nickel bag of grain to a lucy worth of cane.
Maintain communication Data here again
Their leader is determined by the vote of many men
Although he's only human and slightly over weight.
He control's and manipulates their whole United States.
I call to the white castle.
Secret service on the phone giving me a hassle.
He said the information I requested was denied.
Before he hung up the phone he took a deep breath, stopped, and replied:
This is our world
This is our world
This is our world
This is our world
So get the fuck out
(x2)
Judging from the information so far collected
The Dirtball may not be the ideal place to land our craft
After receiving this information we'll make our final judgment.
Fleek are you there?
I'm here, but hold up captain cause this ain't good.
I'm getting chased by some fat rednecks in white hoods.
I think there trying to kill me 'Well what do you mean?'
It seems they got a problem with the fact that I'm green
I guess on the Dirtball they all hate each other
If it ain't were your from, it's your skin color
Let me get my phaser tron out, hold up *buzz*
'What was that?'
I smoked 'em
But what really fuckin turns my tentacles is their relationships.
They swell each other's lips.
I see men that ain't shit in their daily life.
So they come home drunk and beat they wife.
She forgives him when he say's he didn't mean it.
You ask me they can both suck my petty lip.
I give up captain beam me back to Zelaloovy.
Another thing they love to watch horror movies.
But your not allowed to be scary on a CD.
They tried to ban this one group ICP.
I went to see 'em in concert J grabbed me by the head,
And then he took his microphone and said:
This is our world
This is our world
This is our world
This is our world

As this marks the day that
3 of America's most notorious outlaws
Will be executed for their crimes
Together the states of Michigan and California
Will conduct the executions behind prison walls
The 3 prisoners are set to be executed by 3 separate methods
Electric chair, hanging, and firing squad
Midnight tonight will mark the first execution
Death waits in my cell I can smell him
Somebody tell him that I still breathe, leave
I'm alive I'll never see 25 
Yet still I can feel, I'm real
When it all happened I was in the lime light
News, camera, gaven killer stamina
Another year I'm here but forgotten
Skin is rotting feeling old, cold
Motherfucker in a robe gonna sentence me to die in a metal chair
Fizzle my nut hair
Bad enough I'll be dead
Yet I'm tryin to figure out a way
To keep my eyes from poppin out my head
Oh they'll remember my ass
Twitchin, with my eyes drippin down the glass
Shaggy I think they're tryin to start a riot
And then it's Ice T but he don't seem fazed by it
I know the devil's waitin on me
But does God like him playin his role in killin me though
Lock me up until I die maybe
But you can never tell 
We might sharing a cell in hell

Let my homies smoke my ashes and catch a Violent J buzz
One more thing before you hit that switch
Please tell my momma that I'm sorry, I never

Should've thought about that shit before you done it
Why? I, never want to die
Don't nobody cry for me, it's only murder

The lights dimmed in my cell block
Cause all the power they got surged into one spot
J's chair hear him screamin, fully loaded
It was funny at first till his head exploded
It's something else for me 
Another kill just as wicked 
But cheaper on the light bill
It all starts with a thick rope
Make a noose and I'm gone
Stretch out my neck bone
Minutes left I think about my brother
When we was young...
Wait I don't have a brother
What the fuck?
My minds in a tangle
I wish somebody was here that I could strangle
I keep waking up on the floor
Cause I strangle myself but what the fuck for?
Haha starin at the cracks on the walls
Whistlin necks, fidgetin my balls
Kill me it'll still all be the same
Wicked clown juggalo phantom of the night train
What if I drop, but don't die
Tie weights to my legs 
And give it another try
Still coming think of something, I speak
I'm not feelin so hot let's go for it next week
Didn't work, I pulled down my collar
At least they won't be hearin me holla
My neck shut

And the 3rd prisoner slowly makes his way
To the designated spot on prison grounds
Where he will be executed by way of firing squad

My backs against the wall
If I only had my strap then I could plug 'em all
Watch 'em fall
But they got my ass tied up behind this wall
So the homies can't ride up
Known killer in fact I killed the most
At random though some of them I planned 'em
Fuck it, I kicked your bucket for you, floor you
Got more guns if there's more of ya
War with the cops no prob 
They shouldn't took the job
Blow holes throught they heads like donuts
Grown-ups, kids and girls
Gather round and get gunned down
I do it for the fun of it, adrenaline rush
Coked up quick to bust 
Plus I love my dust
Gun son, watch the blood run son
I'm on one, muthafuckas
But check it this time I'll be the one dissected
I can't wait to feel the heat when lead and flesh meets
Bitter sweet baby, I been waiting for this
Go straight to hell kick it with the rest of my clique
Fuck a blindfold I want to look 'em deep in they eyes
So they can see the fool's face of a dog as he dies
Plus I want to see the muthafuckas squeeze
I got a hot date with my soul mate
Bust I can't wait

I can't fix my hair or check my clothes
I can't even see it if there's a booger hangin' out my nose
I'm a hologram, but check it, I'ma feed em' back

Smooth with the buttoned up shirt and the dress socks
It's getting harder to breathe, hello, I'm dying
The air is getting thinner, I'm past the point of cryin'

Broke necks
Mind checks
Seranaded with these beats
How deep?
About a hundred and fifty-two feet
Don't sleep
'Cause the boogyman will steal your soul
And have you strung out on remote control
And now your mind is broken and you feel pain
What you call sanity's what I call insane
I said your mind is broken and you feel pain
What you call sanity's what I call insane
My mind's flippin' on alcohol
Tylenol
And marijuana
Still I eat the rhythm alive like a piranaha
Now Madonna done fucked everybody but me
But I heard she got the clap (awwww!!)
Pass me a Newport, it could be a light
Image is nothing so I'ma drink me a Sprite
Tonight's the night
But my name ain't Betty Wright
It's Mr. Bones
And aggrivating hoes please leave me alone
I'm on my own
In my little fucked up world
And I ain't got time for silly games little girl
'Cause I'm tryin' to be me
And that's all I can be
And if you see more, you best a-go and join the Army
Arm me
With the lyrics and rhythms that I be spittin'
I seen it through your panties it was written on your kitten
Smellin' like chicken
But finger-lickin'
Nonetheless
And for my big Johnson, I got the propholactic vest
So I won't bust no bulky shot
'Cause that's highly illogical like Mr. Spock
And I ain't tryin' to be a father any time soon
And we only got one hour left in the motel room
But that's enough time for me to hit the skin
I can tell you want it baby, by the way that you grin
Let me fondle on your breasts
As we both undress
And if you let me, I'ma bust a nut all up on your chest
Bend over let me catch the rhythm as ya moan
I love it when you tighten up and try to touch your toes
As my dick smashes
Crashes
What a disaster
Clit pleaser, call me the Thigh-Master
'Cause I got a black belt in the art of Wo-Tongue-Fu
Let me lick on your vagina as you holler at the moon
Now mengo, mango
Me and Tisha did the tango
But little did I know my girl was looking through the window
Now what was I to do, throw that bitch out in the street
Fucked up hair, no panties, and bare feet
Two...keep on fuckin' like ain't shit up
Because a couple more strokes and I'ma bust that nut
Three...play it cool, let the shit unfold
Calmly get dressed and say, ""fuck both of y'all hoes.""
Woke up in the backseat of a ride
Tangled in the seatbelt, smellin' like peroxide
Blood keeps gushin' from the side of my head
And I wonder to myself am I alive or dead
Reach for my dick, oh my God, I hope she didn't chop it
Try to play the lunatic like Lorena Bobbit
All up in the place, confused and distraught
She took back the new Polo shoes that she bought
She tried to play me out with a fucked up scheme
And then I blinked my eyes and woke from my bad dream

I can't stop smokin' because I can't kick the habit
What is a jam if you don't come smooth?
What is a beat if you don't have a groove?
I could be the President, and legalize weed
I could grow a field of bud with a hand full of seeds

Twiztid,"What up y'all?
This Jed Thumpman
Let me tell y'all a little story
About a muthafucka that I know named Blaze
Now everytime we roll up a joint
Muthafuckas always be talkin' about Blaze Blaze Blaze
Man fuck Blaze
This muthafucka act like he puttin' it down for the hood
Talkin' bout everybody know Blaze, big baller
I don't give a fuck
Dead muthafucka don't get no special treatment from me
Look at Sarie's son little Eric
You know that muthafucka down to wear a wheelchair
I hate that muthafucka
And I don't show him no special treatment
So Blaze can kiss my ass

I put in work for my hood
So fuck a 9 to 5
You can find me on the corner
Hustlin' on the grind
They call me Mr. Lump Lump
So when their heads hear the thunder and the bump bump
They come out runnin' like the kids to the ice cream man
Children I'm sorry it's Blaze in the loony van
Playin' Atari, and I gotta do a crime to loot and 8 ball
Semi automatic with a clip for the law
All I want to do is make money and smoke
Fuck hella bitches, and slang my dope
The law ain't good for a muthafuckin thang
But eatin' mad donuts, and gettin' all in the way
I been gone for more than a day, and some things changed
Some many died and some faded away
I represent the ghetto from Harlem to Pinewood
I ride for the hood, I put it down for the hood

I put it down for the hood
I ride for the hood
And all my muthafuckas is up to no good
Cause everybody in the hood is trying to come up
So gimme all of your money before you get your ass stuck
I put it down for the hood
I ride for the hood
And all my muthafuckas is up to no good
Cause everybody in the hood is trying to come up
So gimme all of your money before you get your ass stuck

I've been dead to the world for the last 11 years
My body's decomposing, I'm missin' part of my ear
Still gonna rock till the day I die again
Get up back from the dead, and ryde again
Walk again, talk thug shit, right
Empty mack clips, right
Keep it old school, want to see that bitch? Uh huh
When it's thugs in King's coats and Raider's caps
Killers, jerry curls, and baseball bats
Ready to die like everyday
I put it down like a muthafucka, everyday
I drink brew and smoke weed like, everyday
And we all trying to get paid but anyway
Killas don't talk, but this one do
Talk you out your wallet let the 45 blast you
Twice in the chest, once in the face
Plus the extra heater on the safe side in case
Your bitch is wack well she can catch one too
Cause if you're down with your hood
Then your hood down with you

I put it down for the hood
I ride for the hood
And all my muthafuckas is up to no good
Cause everybody in the hood is trying to come up
So gimme all of your money before you get your ass stuck
I put it down for the hood
I ride for the hood
And all my muthafuckas is up to no good
Cause everybody in the hood is trying to come up
So gimme all of your money before you get your ass stuck

Psychopathic just like thugs
We ball, and we fight
And just like the freaks I come out every night
Holdin' down the sidewalk
Standin' amongst muthafuckas that's soon to be outlined in chalk
Sippin' on a cold ass 40 of OE
Live from the DET we OG
Pissy drunk always, we dead bumpin'
Stay thug with the throw away in the trunk
Bitch slapper, fuck a bitch rapper
Bitches were made for fuckin' but that's another chapter
Bitch you don't know me, don't approach me
Thinkin' that you're down with Blaze ya dead homie
G Blood imbedded in street blocks
That's why I put it down, and blast with many shots
Bullet holes in my chest, it's all good
Man I even died for my hood, muthafucka

I put it down for the hood
I ride for the hood
And all my muthafuckas is up to no good
Cause everybody in the hood is trying to come up
So gimme all of your money before you get your ass stuck
I put it down for the hood
I ride for the hood
And all my muthafuckas is up to no good
Cause everybody in the hood is trying to come up
So gimme all of your money before you get your ass stuck",Put It Down,2002
Twiztid,"I remember when people used to break on me
Sayin' anything I do would never make money
And everything I do would always be wack
And every word they spoke, a knife in my back
I remember watchin' Evil Dead
At 4 o'clock in the morning every night all summer
Sittin' in the dark tryin' to game on hoes
For a chance to dip my thang dank in some neden hole
I remember my first piece of ass
She lived in Detroit, she was white trash
But I fell in love like a big ol' fool
I remember drivin' that dumb bitch to night school
I remember the first time me and Jeremy gave weed a try
Oh, what a surprise
Bloodshot eyes
It's all a bunch of lies
We said it didn't work and we wasn't even high
I remember shit, but don't remember a lot
But I remember the house behind the parking lot
And I remember the first day I met Madrox
From then it was on like Kirk and Spock
And I remember all the people and the things they say
And I remember when I see em', they gon' die that day
And I remember when my mama said watch my back
And I remember who to look out for now in fact
I remember the first day that I hit the green weed
I remember that it's us against the world in need
And I can remember the very first girl that I fucked
And I can really remember how bad it sucked
And I can remember the day that I took that vow
To bring the world the wicked shit the way that I know how
And I remember all the shows and all the love we got
And I remember buyin' three for 25 at the weed spot
I remember me and Jeremy used to fight and shit
And I remember all the bites and busted lips
I remember enough to get by
If you feelin' what I'm sayin', throw your hatchet in the sky

Every minute of my life, I remember it all
Happy and sad
Good and the bad
Every day we spent and all the times we had

Check 1, check 2
now what it feel like
they say we're just a couple in the way ass, talkin way too fast
and all our shit, it sound like trash (what!?)
You can't see us, replicate us and try to be us
if only you swap me 2 stripe adidas
Now what you holdin down, dog your whole style is tough
your rhymes is whack and shit don't bump
you say I'm hatin, hell naw, I'm just telling the deal
and since I hate you then I don't give a fuck how you feel
We keep the dead jumpin put your hands in the air
you can diss the unreal, but the unreal don't really care
we don't give a fuck, more bodies up in the trunk
every day is Friday the 13th with bad luck
Somehow we made it through, don't know how, somehow we do
without relyin on radio or interviews
Where my killers at, middle finger in the air
and we spread in the numbers everyday so be prepared

Chorus: x4
what's this
that's what it's like
and I don't want nobody to know
nobody

i could cut your eyeball out with a exacto blade
you still couldn't see my freekshow mindstate (twiztid)
Levitate up in the middle of the room
and have everybody shakin in they kung-fu shoes
I got madrox wit me packin a bowl
I got 17 keppin 1 in the hole
I got a stash spot that I keep on the low
incase I gotta put in work on the bitch ass juggaho
People sendin me their death threats
but I got something for you fake ass bitches better believe that
My axe is swingin I got your blood on my face
with your body still floppin cut in half at the waist
It's like peepin with a mad man
shit it ain't nothing to loose but my shell and you can have that
Never ? you mother fucker never die
with the axe and the pistol representin the eastside

Chorus x4

We got the dialect to dialate you intalect
we change up love and hate without no textbook or no internet
We stomp on waves (waves) play in the graves (graves)
and we take the minds of those are listening in interphase
and defind mind frames, everyone is king
and the pressures of the world are crumbled by the words we sing
I contend I'm sick and pissed of all this bullshit
we all up in your face while a bone(?) is geriatric

we ain't the trend of the millennium, I can tell ya that
you can keep the freestyle rap and backpack
We are the drama seekers, looking for non-beleivers
we walk on water and clouds in search of dream weavers
I hope your glad to meet us, now get the blaze up
your just a hot dog spot bitch so raise up
You outta mind, outta body, outta spirit, outta rhymes
sneak up on behind you in the dark from behind

I jumped out of my bed thinking I'd been invaded, heard smashing, more pounding, the sound escalated 
Looked out of my window, blood dripped down thy glass, I see bodies lay twisted and mangled on grass, 
I ran into thy main room and Shaggy was dead, so was Nate the Mac, Jumpsteady and ABK 
Bolted out of thy house to see if it's a joke, I heard hundreds of car alarms, saw flames and smoke 
And thy sky above red, I see dead bodies fallin' it's raining with corpses thy blood is appalling

IT POURS, but never mentioned Dead Bodies,

I hope I never see what all them people saw
And put them in there places

So hot
I was burning,
Yeah 

Dead bodies lay randomly some stack in piles, on all of there faces pour horror, no smiles 
I see children, and ciders, and ninjas my age, all lay naked and mangled, most withered for days, 
I found safety a shelter I'm under a tree; only fingers and organs come falling on me, 
I lay sleepless for days as thy raining continued, thy heat of thy sun baking corpses like food 
Then it finally stopped I walk knee deep in blood, over piles of bodies threw what was my hood 
It was right azt that moment thy Wraith had appeared, and thy message it left me might sound kind of weird 
But take all that I'm seeing and opposite that, truth is I'm thy one dead and this is my Hell's Pit",Hell's Forecast,2002

You goin' look at me, or I'm a get to palming the world just like I was Apocolypse 
With that destructive and malicious look in my eyes 
Me, Mono, Blaze, and Esham who want to die? 

[Monoxide Child]
Fuck it, why yall 
I've been fucking with black magic 
Now I'm standing in the middle of the Gratiot yelling at the passing traffic 
Nothing to laugh at, but I'm something to see 
I spit fire, you can see my tongue blaze when I breathe

Look at me! Monoxide!

Look at me 
My life and times what they took from me 
They overlooked me, the judge threw the book at me 
Look at me

Twiztid,"If everything is going my way 
Then why does it suck so much to be Eric Ritter today? 
I'm like the captain of the football team 
And every girl who's someone in my school, they want to suck my dick or sleep with me 
I get big props, and high fives 
For them quarter back sneaks from the 30 yard line 
I never fuck with drugs, I only drink for the buzz 
I can handle my liquor, and my daddy is a judge 
And he looks out for me 
But what about the prom queen? 
It's been at least two weeks since she's been heard from or seen 
Susan Casada, her momma is a lawyer and her daddy is a doctor 
Her picture's in my locker 
Her body's in the lagoon, underneath the lily pads 
Glow from the moon, dark watery tomb 
Consumed the body, then pulled her below 
I wrapped her in my letterman coat and slit her throat 
Then I let go 
Loudest splash I ever heard 
And from that day forward I haven't spoken a word 

And from that day forward I haven't spoken a word

[Chorus:Repeat x2]
The marsh lagoon 
So many want to dump their dead in here 
Only the water 
Only the waters know what stories they bare 

My name's not important 
You never thought you'd see the day when you would see me again 
But now I caught you 
I've been abused, confused but uplifted 
So I choose to keep this inside but that shifted to a hate that'd keep me alive 
Until your heart stops 
Then padlock your time box and dropped it in a black marsh 
To hell and back is where my mind has been 
And once upon a time I had a friend I thought I really could confide in 
Flashbacks of the touching 
Uncomfortable feeling 
Can't sleep much at night 
I'm crawling the ceiling 
Got me feeling like I'm sick and depressed 
Cause everybody that I told, they just laid it to rest 
But now I'm twenty five 
And I'm sick of all the talking 
Now I'm stalking you, waiting by the door that you'll be walking through 
No disguise so you can recognize my face 
And all the shame and disgrace will be the reason I dismantle you 
I handle you like a candle 
Break you in half and then I laugh at you 
Soak you in gas and make you flammable 
I burned the body and I gathered the ash 
And then I sprinkle the lagoon every time I get the chance 

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

I got dark secrets 
Eventually I told everybody 
One day I'ma snap and leave a crime scene bloody 
But they only think I'm playing 
I'm just a Dave from Donut Hut 
They always like ""What up Dave Nut?"" when I show up 
But that doesn't really bother me I suppose 
Yet there's a darkness inside of me 
Which eagerly grows 
When I was younger I murdered off some neighborhood squirrels 
And this abandoned garage was like my own private world 
Now it's ""Honey, I had a bad dream again"" 
I'm tripping 
Demons eating me alive and burning within 
I gotta feed it 
I roll down another dark street 
I'm trying to find something alive so I can smother out it's heartbeat 
I'm thinking a hooker 
You think I'm bullshitting? 
I reach for my leathers, but I only find my wife's mittens in the glove box 
Circle some blocks 
I pick the chick up, I let her suck the dick up, before I cut her neck up 
She kicked for a minute, not putting much in it 
I never thought I'd get this mad 
I'm glad I did it, I admit it 
Feel so much better, a neck wetter, a throat shredder 
I got blood on my sweater and I better not get a head, of myself 
The first matter is disposal of the body 
I found the perfect spot out past my Uncle Marty's 
It's some hidden lagoon where it be dark all the time 
I dumped her there and got on with mine 

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Only the trees 
Only the fish 
Only the bugs 
And only the water 
Truly really know 
What happened that night 
When right went wrong 
That's how they got there

Twiztid,"Speculation has it, that I'm the freakiest one 
I like to rip out my tongue and spit the black magic 
And I'm supposed to be fucking some crack addict without a rubber? 
And I already got a baby by her mother? 
They say I'm a sci-fi wizard of sorts 
And my momma, she was a banshee, she was drowned by the courts 
They say my little brother Jamie, he's dead and in a grave, and I'm all alone and afraid 
And everything I gave has been so underestimated, I've been hated by generations 
For having conversations with people who didn't make it 
How could I fake it? 
I'm a monster, remember me? The weirdo with the axe, from another galaxy 
I keep a blender in my kitchen filled to rim with the blood 
And spit suspicions of me drinking it up 
So it's fucked, scatter stones, get out my cool-Aid 
I'm blasting away from all you haters 
Hit me up on my two-way 

[Chorus:Repeat x4]
Besides some bullshit falling down 
I'm okay 

Speculation has it that I'm a drunk and a drug addict 
A shit talker, always trying to start static 
A borderline faggot, with long fingernails 
Either that or he's a coke head, but I don't think he cares 
Speculation has it that I have already engaged in sexually fantasies with me and Gwen Stefani 
A video taping, internet downloads 
Speculations is called is the one who gets boned 
I can't escape it, mistake it, or fake it out 
Look you in the face as if I don't know what you talking about 
Speculation, you heard I don't spit on no bodies shit, but no, don't hate me 
Many mouths to feed, and many personalities, and me looking to get P.A.I.D 
Is it a lie or is it true? 
You can put that on our skills they stay snug like my Batman suit 

[Chorus:Repeat x4]

Smash the flash I have the plastic backing 
Speculation, hateration, me and Twiztid don't give a
Mistaking, papered up, smashing independently 
With a dedicated ass fanbase, and don't a mothafucka hear from me 
Speculation, see they just don't know 
I be rapping too fast, they be listening too slow 
I be spitting sluggish 
E-40 be spitting thuggish 
E-40 be representing the bottery up in the cop, got the dirt popping 
Ain't no stopping a pimp 
Walk with a limp 
Elbows on bimp 
Flopping on hips 
Sipping on sip, sipping on sip 
Dipping and skating and bounce to this shit 
Me and Twiztid be twisted 
Me and Twiztid be gone 
Me and Twiztid be blisted 
Me and Twiztid be stoned 
Gone on our head, dead, dead wrong 
Smoking turtle, beating on our chest like King Kong 
Conversating acting and poking, that's how it's hanging today 
Trying to persuade this liquor into giving me brain

Twiztid,"I was looking for some shoes, and some brand new shorts
And took a minute to relax, with some snacks in the food court
I was half way finished, with my value meal
When I spotted this little cutie, with some sex appeal
I winked at her, she gave me a look like I'm a booger
I thought ""Bitch, I'd rather spend my money on a hooker""
Then a bright idea, ran across my mind
If I could swipe a manikin, I'd have a freak all the time
No listening to her lip, no putting up with her shit
No having her act a fool, the way them bitches get
So I hid in the clothes rack, at ""Frederick's of Hollywood""
And waited until they closed, and it was all good
I snatched this little fine ass, strawberry blonde
With her ass jutted out, with nothin' but some sale panties on
Alarms rang out, I ran to the ride
And stuffed my new, lifeless sex friend, quickly inside

I love a manikin, should I be panicking
I don't know what's happening, but I love her
I'm taking her home

I love a manikin, should I be panicking
I don't know what's happening, but I love her
I'm taking her home

I went to this little traveling, carnival deal
Nothing but a few games, a ferris wheel
Haunted house, bumper cars, and a wax museum
I went through it once, I'll never be the same
She was waxy, sexy, smooth, and scratchable
Hourglass titties, and ass was unmatchable
I waited for us to be alone, and I kissed her
Licked her wax neck, and started caressing her
She don't get old, rosy red and pretty
I'm sneaking her out of here, and taking her with me
To my trailer in the woods, I laid her down gently
I bent her arm upwards, accidentally
I took a box cutter and I made an incision
I carved out a little hole in her, for the neden
It hit it, then I set her toes on fire
And cried, watching her slowly expire

I love a manikin, should I be panicking
I don't know what's happening, but I love her
I'm taking her home

Everyday I see her, when I'm riding to work
Look in the window, just a little shirt and short skirt
Her eyes follow me, whereever I go
And she's always in some brand new clothes, and a new pose
Banging ass, and not a wrinkle to be found
With a face like a doll, and she never makes a sound
I bet she likes to talk, when she gets fucked
But then she'd probably never shut the fuck up, with my luck
She always seems so happy when I'm around
And if it wasn't for this window, we'd be fucking on the ground
I wanna take her ass home for keeps, she never sleeps
I don't even think I seen her off her feet
Tonight's the night, that I'ma get her
I can't even take it anymore, when I see her, I start to shiver
Lip quiver, with the butterfly stomach
Leave the truck going, I'ma just grab her and start running

I love a manikin, should I be panicking
I don't know what's happening, but I love her
I'm taking her home

Wanna touch her
She's in my dreams
Wanna hold her, kiss her
I'm taking her home
She's not real
But I feel like I need her in my arms tonight, wrong or right

I'm not afraid I'ma go to work with a gauge
And with the help of a barricade I'ma make the front page
I'm not afraid but when the TV keeps playing
I can see faces of people and the voices keep saying
Starve your fear, feed your life
Let me see you mother fuckers deal with that shit every night
I wanna see one of you walking in my shoes
And in less than six seconds you'll be begging
To take them off and be you
I'm never alone and clone drones that look like me
But to follow every move that I make is not likely
Don't take it lightly
This shit is heavy like a gang of fat bitches
Who love to wear their clothes tightly
I'm more afraid of myself than anything else
This world can hurdle at me
Disease, war and slap me if I'm going in another direction
I can't help it when I get to disecting I get infected

No one knows what you're going through
Be completely different all together

And then say it with such conviction you'll believe them and I know
I sit and listen to all the little drama
All the who's baby mama, who's addicted to blah, blah, blah
Who gives a fuck it's probably all a big lie
A way to get the people talking and walking to get in line
A way to keep the name going but sometimes it backfires
And then everybody but you is nothing more than a liar
You hire lawyers and I watch and read about it for weeks
While the media transforms and digs deep
And you believe the media so much
That your opinion is now a fact regardless of what they told us
The jury's back and everybody's on the edge of their seat
They read the verdict and it says not guilty
And you expect that we believe in what you say

Newports when conversating
Asian carpet woce so well it keep us levitating
Like Aladdin but we're stealing souls like a reaper
Look into my eyeball ring we both see you
Dilated and intergrated mixed with the madness
All traps and no cheese creates sadness
And if this is life, am I living in a maze
Feeling like Jimmy Hendrix always seeing purple haze
But what a beautiful color for such a delusion
Government trying to clone suckas with cell fusion
Now tell me what is that, stealing individuality
Beefing up the army all brawn with no mentality
Can you see through the face like cellophane
We're the voice in the back of your brain tucked away
But your sanity is such a lie
Don't believe me mother fucker, open up your eyes

Got to have the name brand shit to enhance your shine, is it
civilized
Seems more human than human seeing the mutant alive
Breathing inside the music
And the truth is only what they want you to know
Because they know too much would break control
And cause an overload in your perfect humdrum so predictable
Reality of life where everything is fictional

Organized like La Costa Nostra
Bring the truth like Carl the Tooth, it's game over

Come with me 
Won't you run through the middle of my mind and see
How fucked up it can be! {x2}

You don't poke or provoke me when I'm smoking
Razor blade out of my coat and slight your throught clean
Drive you out on a boat and now you're fish feed
All because of my weird addiction to make a bitch bleed
(gotta die)
Since a kid I been in all kinds of counsulin
(ya gotta die)
They tell my momma that an evil is inside of em
I'm dangerous and can bust at any second
My wig split and if I explode clear the wreckage
Car crash and I did that shit on purpose
Had a hooker with me and she's in need of medical service
Coulda took her with me, but instead I left her for dead
And now the lookin for me so I been hidin out in the shed
I been in it for a week now
And I been fendin just ta get somebody bleedin' but in the meanwhile
I lay low unless the bleedin won't stop
I got bored and cut of my hand with one chop

Say Hey! 
I don't think I like it anyway
But you're not gonna tell me what to play
Cause I got a flava that's so addictive I know you'll dig it
O Kaaaayyyyy
Come on now we can play a game
Grab yourself a shovel, dig a grave
Promise not to die 
It's so addictive I know you'll dig it

Sometimes brain waves get scrambled
I go blank and fly off the handle
More hot air for the birthday candle
Celebrating another year off in the gamble
(hell yeah)
So thankful, so appoligetic
So not what I expected
That it's border line pathetic
(fuck ya'll)
But who am I to judge
I don't hold a grudge
Hold the gat to my dome and pray the trigger don't budge
(blaaaa)
Love in the chamber and I aim to kill
The man in the mirror for a change of feel
Switch the pace up, paint his face up with bloodstains
Then redeacorate the bathroom with most of his brains

Like an arrow aimed at your face, got a pair on
Not here for the accolades
So I sit here and I pack grenades
Inside words and I hurl away
Until the world becomes my cemetery
This ain't no Child's Play
Charles Lee Ray can't stop me
I'm made up of demon's blood and I rock with them zombies
Are you livin' in the darkness?
Death is what I encompass
Brought back by the musical voodoo in which I come with
Witchcraft - I run shit
In graveyards, I'll come get
Enough souls to mosh pit
And just start to rock shit
Anybody got a tombstone?
Watch as I get it grooved on
You probably better move on
Or become part of my group home
New song, move along
And I'm gone just like that
You belong in a place just like that
Just hold your breath and I'll be right back
Just like that

I bring that boogie man
That boogieman is waiting
Only the boogie can
Make the dead wake up and get it
Boogieman, boogie, boogie

Gonna make you dance
Whether or not, you want to
Skeleton hands everywhere surround you
Cemeteries, zombies are hungry and need food
And hoping to eat you, you're a dancing fool
Better come to boogie cause it's starting to rain
More like a lightning storm, as we perform
You're gonna fall in the grave
Better glue your ass onto the dancefloor
Pass more bodies to the morgue
Gather outside the mausoleum door
Turn the base so we can fit them all
Mosh pit shoving, whatchu fighting for?
Thunder and lightning, I was gonna pour
Dancing on graves cause we rotten to the core
Finish on the creature dance, I'm the boogieman
Jumping like I'm dunking a hoop through a backboard
I tried to tango with a torso and I let go
They dance too slow, not funky enough
And bitch I came to boogie ho
Gotta get your two left feet and feel the beat
So you can shake them tats
The boogieman don't care less
If you got one arm, no legs, or half a face
You feel the rain in the dark
You're bleedin', sweatin', it's fine
It's to get chicks into shakin' their hips
Emerge for the darkness on the grind
On ya, whether alive or whether you're dead
When that boogieman is breathin' it's easy to lose your head

It's like a ray made a cemetery
Bodies everywhere, see the dead here, see the dead there
Ain't nobody scared
And compared to the farm, this shit's the bomb
And I'm fucked up, finna get my boogie on
Get a dance like I know I can
Ain't nobody bragging, shit I know I'm sweet
And me and M-O-N-O, we came to be
'Cause we're dancing with Majik Ninja feet
To the vampire, we're the werewolf
Till the boogieman comes we fucking grind
Do this shit every day of my life
To the moon in the sky each and every night
Bring the boogieman everywhere we go
Every song in the studio, every video
Every show when you know that we go loco
When we rep the dead yo and that's fosho

Over shadow respecting this
Expecting this to be conceited and heavenless
But never live, never settle again, any better when
Life's weighing my patience, making me feel heaven
And if I have any real feelings, that's relevant
Blessed to never forget like an elephant
Don't fit like shotgun shells up in the derringer
Amongst the square pegs feeling more like a cylinder
Swing to the symphony, metrodone
And the musical gravitation are pullin' ya
Close for microphones and earholes are fitted with zeros
Or forked tongues waking the dead
Makin' some new foes, a simple stain
And permanent pain on a mission to take the clear throat
Y'all know this attractin' hope
But the lack there of be the true scope but no rope
Scapegoats and sailboats soon become
Sinking ships with escape rafts of cut throats

And walk like an animal amongst the primates
And talk like a cannibal ready to eat those
Who stand in the way of the new maze in the end days

While you starve for the light like illuminated apartheid
We all are wicked, check the archives

It showed everyone I suppose
Exactly how to get here and survive down below
But instead most of those chose to find the light
And I suppose it'd be alright if they were standing here tonight
But they ain't want to listen like I had static on the mic
But that was just a sign of their spite
I had to sit and think about betrayal and I died
At least a little piece of me was twisted up inside
And I don't mean Twiztid up like contacts and knives
I mean twisted, like damn, all that was a lie?
Like damn, no more homies by my side?
No more happenings of anything, and I broke down despite
I know I said it was forever until the day that we died
But I never thought you'd be the reason we'd have to fight to survive
But everybody gathered, and they all stood by our side
And that's the reason we're never leaving what they've designed

Sleep the night away in caskets and graves
And awaken from their slumber each

You see us crawling from the ground like a Romero flick
Contaminating up the top side, we stay sick
There is no cure, vaccines, so they quarantine
Our inner being and label each and all of us the enemy

Had to talk to a pastor
Told me sit down, handle my shit
And tried to figure out what the fuck's really the matter
Hating animosity, only the guy wicked
It's the last, the victim, from your offer to the premises
I never know peace cause the nemesis there
'Fore I cover up all the scars and all my blemishes
Needing that x, another interest
Nothing form and I manage to myself with a run-on sentence
And I hang out of shape, put my bat head down
Got my eyes closed, watch as I swing for the fences

Wanna hear about the night when Jamie Madrox died?
And I had to get him out of hell, and to my surprise
He had every serial killa standin' side by side
And they were all singin' along to ""We don't die""
And the fire was burnin' strong, using heads for his bongs
He was the king of everything wrong
And he didn't wanna come back home
But I told him, everything down here would disappear
When I make that clear, it's all a ploy to keep you near
And he just looked and gave a sneer, and said:
I'm not the Devil, but I'm bad as hell
But that motherfucker, he left as soon as I walked in
And I'm the reason when you're breathing
All you're smelling is sin
So when I died, I came to the place where I best fit in
And I play shackles on the demon, I watch, souls are tied
Like a couple of nooses, now there's no more excuses
Why I cannot be ruling everything he was doing
Instead he left and I guess he meant
That hell got bent on the day he went, nah

Once upon a time, when Monoxide died
Had to get him out of hell, to my surprise
Closed my eyes and I journeyed to the other side
The night, the void of all light, hope everything goes right
Got an axe and a piece of a map, it's a one way trip
Ain't nobody comin' back but I am comin' back
And I'm bringin' Monoxide back with me
Hell better know about that
Swing, chop, mowin' down everything that's in my way
And the angels, they say
The demons they know are keeping him close
And demons don't play
Clean move away, I'm cuttin' heads off
No time for small talk, across the catwalk
Wait a minute, I see, never must've been, hear me
Surrounded by eleven and they all look grim
Butcher aprons with blood stains
Faces are pigs with people brains
All their sorts in wicked things, chained and summoning
Trying to put the spirit of the Devil in my brother
Must be outta your mind motherfucker
I'm standing right here with a double headed axe
Ready to fade to black, we gonna kill one another
Three of the pig face demons, they lunge toward me
Waving their blades in my face tryin' to sword me
All I can think is saving my brother
Bringing him back to the world, it's about to get gory
Three dead demons as seven still stand here
Blood on my body, my axe, and my hand, and
All of the sudden they start eating his soul
And he starts to scream and I lose control
Chopping down demons, still screaming at red eyes
And demons are all turning him black
Then I break through the shackles, both wrists and ankles
Grab Monoxide and I climb right back

Full throttle, before weed became legal in Colorado
And booty cake was a nice dish
From Paula Deen before she opened the sucka mouth
And became that racist white bitch
When I'm out with songs, it's killing people like a boulder
The panic through the media had you looking over shoulders
At the known folks, cleaning coin collections with Coca-Cola
That's the sign of a good taste of the name brand soda
Open they eyes holes
They destroyed the twin towers and turned into ground zero
And all the innocent people that died for nothing
Can be remembered in the monument collecting coin
At 9/11 hope button
I can't ever be disgusting, it try to stomach the aftermath
Appetite of destruction
They're switching up to fugazzis

From tongues and ties to Nazis
Now tell me what would Jesus do
Love in the house of the holy was the home
Of a persecutors of Jews
I'd like to think he takes the high road

Like bombs in marathons at Boston
But I'm only one person, how can I make a change
I get lost in the solstice
Disappear from out of sight like a Malaysian flight
And have the entire world searching everyday and at night
I got the moon prayer for them short lives
Like Trayvon Martin, James Foley, Michael Brown, and it ain't right
Don't let the people die in vain

Tell people what they became

But a fucking argument, like
Fuck I'm doing in a relationship
When I've been fucking every chick that she's been hanging with
I'll admit it, I'm burnt news
From the bad attitudes and bad views
And look how fast you gravitate to the back room
Just like me when the track moves
Feel like I'm part of the last view
To come through like a monsoon
And wash it all away
Put perspective on the break
Nail it and call it a day
'Cause if I don't I'm gonna make it, only dues a day
I'll be the top story, not just another fool in the pot
Pour me another so I can slowly drown it away

Raining without the thunder
Bear and amongst the tundra

And I came here to make clear
We're no blurred lines, an assertive time
And I've earned mine like I worked crime

Riling and I'm high like a bird's eye

Others say only psychic powers are needed for you to hear it
In fear, in the disenchanted voices of beyond
In an effort to conversating with 'em, tell 'em to dawn
They're no longer in this plane of existence
Trapped in purgatory, still adjusting to the afterlife conditions
Or in search of the light to move to the next phase
Or continue with haunting the living, playing the game
Some reliving the same day, same way that they died
Confused and couldn't move along if they tried
Some were never alive, not in this world, were told

No tricks, I'll swallow this liquid
And I get life from the breath I bowel
From different victims who come here
And some want to get a little bit closer
Probably looking for closure
Something a little bolder
Grab something and throw it across the room
The evil consume my very soul to control it
I got the feeling of doom when I invoke it
Something so ominous, through certain eyes, I provoke it
Chance to the die ever single time that I woke it
But I'm willing to try, so I keep drinking the potion
My eyes floating inside of my mind
Focused on making some kind of contact

Twiztid,"Abused and ridiculed
I’ll admit that I played the fool
I was bullied when I attended school
I toughed it out and did what I had to do
Thick skin makes it harder to cut them deep wounds
Unless there's already scar tissue covered with attitudes
Emotion is an ocean, it's easy to drown in undertow
It's natural to fight for air and so much harder to let it go
So now I'm broken, incomplete like missing puzzle piece
The darkness overbearing, I'm wondering will it ever cease

When I'm watching raindrops fall against the concrete
Like my feet, when I beat the pavement
When I walk away from the hatred
But it follows me, like I make it
Forsaken me cause I take it
Could change it, but nonetheless
I'd rather be myself I guess
Unless the whole day goes by
And I don't feel like I'm gonna fucking die
Wrong or right, I'm being day, your night
That's how I feel and I can't help it
But I can't tell if it's all a dream
Cause this here don't feel right to me
I can't be who I wanna be

Be it your size, your shape, or the tone and color of skin
Maybe deformity, abnormally, I'm different
But why are they so superior and I've been insignificant
I'm like a painting of confused brush strokes
A whipping post and just another face for them cruel jokes
I wear it all, I go horrible, suited to shame
I'm damaged already, and no, I'll never be the same

Not the norm, won't conform
Against the grain from the day he was born
Please just treat him like a monster, or
Evermore declare war on a misfit

Anybody want to walk in my kicks?
Please do so, cause I know
That anybody wanting to get into my soul
Has a long, dark road to toll
When your all alone with no one to help
Feel lost, just walking in circles

Can't believe that being me
Can make some narcs so angrily

Yelling about the same thing
Telling her what you gonna do
Bunch of mights and maybes
Complaints and fake schemes
Out of your mouth on the daily

It's just as weak as your daydreams
And I'm stuck here in this nightmare
Well aware that you don't care

To me, is nothing more than blurred
My confidence is gone
And all I got going for me is that I'm breathing

Could it be possible that someone feels like I
Someone to tell me that it's over, there's really no need to cry
So I'm bending knees, I'm looking up to the sky

You couldn’t see the clearing from the road
So, alone I sit, my legs folded and eyes closed
This is the place that I go
To come to grips that my sanity’s juxtaposed
With insanity, overload
And I’m afraid of my soul
When I’m back here, I’m all alone
There ain’t no screaming for help
When you're gone, they’ll never know

All the way to the drowning
Heavy stick in my hand and my heart, it keeps pounding
I'm holding them under
And their faces turn blue and I'm watching for wonder
See I hunt them like wild lions
And I catch em and kill em and cut em with hunting knife
Taxidermy like Mormons, stuff their body with leaves and replace vital organs
The thing that's important, is to never dispose of the edible organs
Delicious and morbid like a bucket of blood and a handful of organs
A place in the woods, where no one will hear you dying or seeing you live again
Rest here, you're home now, I'll keep you here with all of them

I- I shouldn't of gone in there
Stop going there, -do you go in there for?
""Hey, stay out of the woods!""

Off in the shadows on darkest of nights
There stands the heartless, his targets in sight
Underbrush overgrown, death stays hidden
Moss growth camouflage, body parts missin'
Trophy collection connected to the prize
Like to hear em scream, always look em in the eyes
Where my disguise is the face of a victim
Get excited everytime I knife sticks em
Watch em die in a place in the woods, the sensation feel so good
Drag em to the cabin, singing and laughing
Addicted to the feelin', so appealin' is the killin'

Lost in the rapture as I torture the victim I've captured
No hearin' the screams of me stabbin' behind, on the side of vacational cabins
There’s darkly shadows somewhere deep in woods where I have them
Tall trees, and the leaves they love the breeze
It’s so peaceful and secluded with horror you can’t believe
The begger repeating ""please"", broken down upon your knees
Hands quiver, come now bleed out until it reds the streets

They wanna get up inside of my head, never
I don't care what the doctors said
In the woods with a bag full of smoke for cover
It just makes me feel better, just keeping it real when I
Tell you not to go in the woods
Cause I’m back there and I will sever
Head from neck, put em in a hole
And I call the show cause it’s dug fresh
Anything left, dig another hole
And burn that shit like I’m learnin' it

Ran up a little further so I can get a better look at whatever
It is am I on sedatives
Can't control it so im running like a zombie

Let the monster out

I'm breathing, I'm living, so fuck what they sayin
So irritatin the games that they playin

I'm just blowing up something lost in the moment and talking shit
I wanna leave it all behind, but in my mind all I find
That I'm alive, and then come all the insane overtimes
Like beside the time that keeps passing me by
So I'm out of my head, my hands, emotionally tired

It's like the whole world welcomes me back
It's like every problem I ever had is back from the track
I took reality and fallout when it casually comes falling right back, and then it's over
I'm either livin' to get high or I'm dyin' tryna be sober, neither bringin' me closer
Now I'm sittin' in this room detoxin' and I'm alone, and all I wanna do is go home
But if I ever get myself up out of this fuckin' hole 
This is the only thing I wanted y'all to know, and it goes

Feelin' lost in a room and so alone, there's no changin' me so take me home
I am on my own I've been gone too long, I'm the memory that echoes on
And this song is yours but I'll share it too, because they always question everything we do
And I guess there's just no fixin' wrong as your heart bleeds out to the beat of this song

Do you feel like the level you tryna get 
is stuck somewhere between right here and all this stupid bullshit?
You work so hard but it seem just like nothin' matters though, 
This life you make em' feel sick and fed up is there an antidote?
To feel better be confident to be okay with the things I cannot change 
But that's positive and I'm the opposite
In a bottomless pit I'm fallin' 
My feelings are all around me so many sleepless nights, 
So many tears enough to drown me
Instead you learn to sleep grab a pillow and work 
Sleep and be like a burnable fall when you can simply ride don't quit it
Wherever they may and possibly will beat me along my path,
Will I return to you to see you smile and possibly hear you laugh?
Or will I venture further, more distance 'tween me and home 
As long as you know I'm out there that you're never truly alone
And on my endless journey floating beyond the stars 
Learning life is not eternal but home is wherever you are

Feelin' lost in a room and so alone, there's no changin' me so take me home
I am on my own I've been gone too long, I'm the memory that echoes on
And this song is yours but I'll share it too, because they always question everything we do

I've been told that home's where the heart is, love don't live here no more regardless
I still feel this emptiness in me, will there be something that can save me?",Long Road Home,2017

Gather round my wealthy friends and endure the horrifying sights
Only your worst nightmares can produce
Actual human beings of a deformed nature
Come at once and come and indulge yourself

Ring one, a dung a dung dung
My name's Violent J and I staple my tongue
To the desk in school then I run down the hall
Scaring the shit out of all y'all bitches
Which is why you don't invite mine to your parties
Just 'cause I don't look like everybody
I guess you're just a bunch of hot shots
They act like they ain't never seen a Cyclops

And what's the big deal about my neck
Just because now and then I like to let it stretch
Up a couple feet to get a better sight
Is that any reason to scream and run in fright
No, so, what's up with that?
So what if I got another arm growing out of my back
I guess I'm just another freak show thing
And now they got me in the three ring

I'm Shaggy 2 Dope, chicken-faced bitch, who?
You don't try to front ho
Try to play me out just 'cause I'm an albino
Or maybe it's the sack growin' out my neck
But don't jet baby, heh, not yet
I'm popping in like a pound of lead
Black n blue, his next roll and drop me on my head

Oh shit, I knew I had to fuck up my circuits
'Cause when I was two, my momma left me at the circus
Abandoned at the carnival with the freak shows
Like bad boys, hermaphrodites and old man crow
But then I escaped to the ghetto zone
Started a crew of my own, motherfucker, I'm not alone
So don't be stickin', your finger in my face stank
Or your stomach might receive a shank from the

What's so fuckin' funny about it
These fuckin' people are real

Look if you want but I wouldn't lay a hand on me
That's how you get fucked up
We'll squeeze your windpipe shut
Yo, I'm a nerd word, I drink Thunderbird
I chill with my homies on a crackhouse curb
Nobody wanna hang with a freak
Who's clinically dead with no heart beat

Fuck that, bitch, suck that
I was born with a wang but I never had a nut sac
Just two balls hanging with no protection so
I move real careful and slow
You can call me a weirdo, call me a freak
Just 'cause my nose curl up like the iron shriek
Is that the reason nobody wanna hang, fuck It

And that fat flop of shit wife of yours
And get the fuck out of our circus tent

You think they look fucked up
Just wait till I kick your
Fucking lips in a couple times
You'll be sitting up here like a bitch
And we'll laughing at your folded ass

Place the stones at my head and feet
Tell them all I've gone to sleep

And as the city unravels her metal bedroll
I dirty her sheets with the stumble I stroll
And the people all stop just to watch me go by
With a thirst in my throat and a tear in my eye
So riddle me this while I lend you my soul in a song, in a song, a song
And balance the sky on these shoulders of mine

Saying ""Boy, this ain't no nigger's race

Tuck in the other side
These confessions are mine
But I'll not claim a word

This restless parade
Yes I watched it go by
Through the cracks in my palm
Seen them all gone
Some sequence of lives

Well she calls out alone
With the pain in her voice
It's the wound of betrayal
It's the weapon of choice

Left her heart on display
Though that she'll deny
Two tattoos of skin
One of ice one of tin
For the days have gone by

But I ain't one to reminisce
But close my heart and clench my fists

Now the days swiftly pass
With the chest full of fear
Here the minutes are hours
But the moments are years

And old acquaintances passed
In trios, in pairs
And if they stay or they go
One struggles to know
One struggles to care

But out beyond the Ten Tree walls
The wind blows hard the highway crawls

And if you should pass the James Hotel
Please stop in for I knew you well
But that was oh so long ago
And I never learned how to let go

But when you fear your own faults
And you're sick of this life
When you're reckless of hand
And trembling the knife
And all your doors prefer locks
And your death prefers spoons
Why wouldn't you wait one last laugh at fate
Forever's too soon

But across the field death bell knells 
Listen close hear the toll tell

To run and tell my darling true
My breath is short
My days are few
So please come down
And take my hand
My last demand

And lead me to some slender rest
And please dismiss what I confess

Heart like all men?s dreams in the days of 49
I turn hollow, no me more swallow, fast only she breaks
But distance keeps her miles or meters, what difference does it make?

'Cause here they come again to repossess my dreams
Child don't play yourself things are never what they seem
A bridge, a river, a pale moon sliver, city shines so bright
But to my despair, I return where they sleep out every night

But the girl I love is oh, so, oh, so far away
And I wonder can she hear me as I go through my day

Oh, now the ragin' sea she laps upon my door
I?ll round a thousand horns just to drown upon her shore
Blood red roses go down moses, oh, billowin' sails
Those so weak-willed, guts all sea-filled, throw them o?er the rails

Boys, slacken up the jib and sing a hearty song
We've been driftin?, driftin?, for far too long
I take no care, me I'm so bare-breasted on the bow
Scabbed and weathered skin of leather, who's the deader now

But the girl I love is oh, so, oh, so far away
And I wonder, can she hear me as I go through my day
It's so long lady angel, I guess, I?ll say goodbye
But I do believe I'm aging right before your eyes

Wash up on her coast, not a nickel to my name
Sold my, sold my, sold my gold watch and chain
Enough to hire a band of lyres to march me on my way
Through hills and valleys, streets and alleys up to her open gates

But the girl I love is oh, so, oh, so far away
And I wonder, can she hear me as I go through my day
It's so long lady angel, I guess, I?ll say goodbye
But I do believe I'm aging right before your eyes

Cock crow in the morning, heard it loud and clear
Asked her for to marry, she answer with a tear
Boy, you have my heart and I know you always will
But that ain't enough to hold me 'cause love don't pay the bills

I turned away in shame for all my days in vain
Guess, I?ll just drag on, no one loves you till you're gone
Let the river be my guide, let the desert be my bride
Till my heart turns to steel, till I no longer feel

But the girl I love is oh, so, oh, so far away

It's so long lady angel, I guess, I?ll say goodbye

And the wander of your fingertips
I should prove true to my emptiness
And stay here

For the one that I hold dear

You know, you could be anyone

I claw my eyes, I skin my face
Beg somehow to be replaced

And your service is so free of cost

Left somewhere behind

And I hate to speak so free
But you mean nothing to me

I?ll get home tonight

I guess by the dim light in your eyes
And that to you all things come as a surprise
I should set the steel trap of your thighs
And dive right in

But to you I'm just a confused child
Insecure or in denial
Go raise your robes, go have your trial
I?ll let you win

You know, I could be anyone
God forgive what I should've done
A thoughts enough to guilty be

Yes, I guess I made this bed
But I?ll take the sidewalk instead

The prison of your company
The snake oil of your love

The heights to which you drag me
Just to hurl your scorn
The trumpets play the livelong day
But they blow so forlorn

Did you hold the hand that held me down?
Did you laugh at my expense?
When there's rust upon your ragged crown
Who will stand at your defense?

And when I unveiled my weakness
On your rodeo of tears
You stood there so vacantly
Your fingers in your ears

And you left by the morning
With all that's left to steal
But every time you say farewell
There's breadcrumbs at your heels

Did you kiss the hand that held me down?
Was your kindness just pretense?
When there's no one left for you to clown
Who will stand at your defense?

But it's ashes, Lord, it's ashes
Soon we all fall down
You take your place among the saints
Make not a single sound

And the hills that held our childhood
The flowers grow there still
You lay beneath them, pushing weeds
And I guess you always will

Could you be the hand that held me down?
When I was sick with common sense
And now your statuettes are all torn down
There's no one left to lean against

And ever since your epitaph
Was spattered on my wall
No one comes to call
They can't stand the stench

But I still sing your praises
Every time the curtain calls
The burden on me falls
Yeah, I alone stand at your defense

Is Jesus gonna pick you up
When your hunger weighs you down?

Mama, come and save me
Nothing?s sacred anymore
What good was living for?

And I been wondering just who misplaced my soul
There's pockets in my holes
And way out on the open plains, men pave beneath the sun
The great suburban dawn, if you build it they will come
Build it they will come, build it they will come

When there's no knock on the door
No shelter from the world

I'd sing your lonesome song
Pack my things
I'll be gone vaguely

You tell me I'm out of place
Rip my eyes out of my face with ease
And if I had one inch of pride

You took that too
When you said goodbye

And I woke to curse my life

Por tu amor me desespero

Pensando en ti me pongo caliente

Two Kings in a Cipher,"[Amen-Ra]
Here we come, here we come, we're two kings
The cipher's complete, spiced up with a smooth beat
A guaranteed hit, sure to get us paid
The cut was concieved by Freeze from the hit brigade

[D.O.P.]
It's a mellow type of flow, the kind you snap your fingers to
While you're in your car playing Low Pro
You're not an MC, but even you start flowing
Amen-Ra come down, and do a little TKO'n

[Amen-Ra]
All right, let me explain TKO'n
It's like breaking your curfew, coming in after 3 and
You're tip-toeing, trying to be slick or very quiet
It's so smooth your mother and your father try it
Nodding and bobbing your head is the main reaction
Then you're tapping and snapping causing a chain reaction
And the person next to you does the same
You're acting like really big kids playing one big game
You begin to recite the rhymes
Then you hear a hard line and rewind for a foul time
The record is memorized, your conscious is stimulized
And you're glowing, we're TKO'n

[D.O.P.]
Yes, thy kingdom come
Two Kings in a Cipher keeping you hyper, children of the sun
And I bless, the listening ones
I'm filling your soul and making you whole
With truth when the rhyme's done
It sounds kind of wicked, am I correct?
And I didn't even say ""1,2"" or give a mic check
Cause I can just grab it and whip it
A true MC can you dig it? When the rhyme flows, you sip it
Like drinking champagne with a cutie named Tootie
TKO'n with a mossie, pimping hard like Rudy
Looking like ""3 the Hard Way""
TK Tone, D.O.P., and on my right the Amen are-A
Crashing the scene like the A-Team, we're showing off
Grabbing the mic and we're going off, we're TKO'n

[Amen-Ra]
Here I am, back again, the serpent in the sky
TKO'n in the sudio making hits when I
Turn on the boards, set up the reel and run the beat through
Wait for a minute, rewind, then give the music EQ
The engineer asks, ""Who's up, you or D?""
I say ""Me"" and put my vocals on tracks two and three
Then I proceed to rip the mic up like a chainsaw
Brothers falling victim when I'm taking the blame for
Those who slept, crept he stepped on my
Ego, D.O.P. come ghetto legal

[D.O.P.]
Damn, we're saying fly weak dope shit
I got a second mic cause the first one I broke it
But hype hype rhymes I hit harder than a brick
The DJ will scratch and cut and we will just kick
Yes the tempo is slow and my voice is low
So hip hip hooray and away we go
Behind the M-I-see I'm standing, rhymes I'm rambling
On, got MC's scrambling, word is bond
I take a trip and I fly by the power of the eye
And I know where I'm going, that's TKO'n",Tko'n,1991
Two Lone Swordsmen,"You may be on top of the world
You're also standing on my roof
You say I'm on rockets to stars
Your shadows waking me at night
You may be on top of the world
My ceiling shakes 
And that's the truth
You say I'm on rockets to stars
You're only taking up my light

Four steppers
Is two too many
Your storm too strong
Three voices
Unnecessary
Your call too long
Two questions
Means I am ready
Beware my pain
One warning
Then kiss you deadly
No love refrain

So what you can walk on the clouds
Pressure only makes it rain
So hot to the fingers that touch
Glowing embers hit the ground
So what you can walk on the clouds
Footsteps driving me insane
So hot to the fingers that touch
Burning bodies never found",Kamanda's Response,2004
Two Lone Swordsmen,"The sound of new machines
Over the junkyard
Ease him into sleep
A bullet to the brain
Means that he drunk hard
Looking for the deep

A stranger he now knows
To be a countess
Wakes him with a start
And asks please take me home
To Daddy's address
You can have my heart

A stranger he now knows 
To be unstable
Writhes with need and fears 
A look of pure dirt
Across the table
Even so he hears

The alarm in his head
Moving into the red
Sounding like punches and knives

Hear the voices, they cry
It's likely you'll die
Pounded by punches and knives

The lady did not show
Her recognition
Of his firm replies
Just took control and moved
Into position
Sparks in magnet eyes

So with one simple no
It's the green light to go
What if the answer was so
A week's loving quite dark
And out goes the spark
Then she'd have finished with me

A stare he could see now
May signal violence
Should he make a move
A sweetly pleading smile
Prompts only silence
Got no point to prove
A stare he could now see
Went quite a distance

Hiding make-up tears 
With loud and knowing tones
Of dark insistence
This is what he hears",Punches and Knives,2004
Two Lone Swordsmen,"Tear me to pieces
Do it for show
Eloquent speeches
Flick of the wrist
Pressure increases
Sure lets me know
Taste of you teaches
Sick when we kiss

Coming down
Like a space shuttle
Head hurts
Teeth rattle
Walking around
Playing spurned lover
Limbs roll
Eyes shudder
Bursting banks
Like the damned rivers
Spine bombs
Blood shivers
Sickly sweet
Just a gak yearning
Touch cold
Hair burning
Give up the tactics
Flag never raised
Fuck the heroics
Enemy lines
She drops in hat tricks
Then leaves for days
Even the stoics
Chop down the pines

Fast on my crutches
Slow for the bored
Pure to the last drop
Poison the first
Out if your clutches
Try to get cured
Messages won't stop
Summon the curse

Validate calls
Don't call it lying
Covering tracks
Shake down and treason
Crumble the walls
Gunned down while flying

Two Lone Swordsmen,"Those who are left at the end
Would have won with desire
The kind that destroys as it grows
As you walk in the fire

Those who last right to the end
Would have got there by lust
The kind that consumes, never slows
As you crawl in the dust
To love with a light in your eyes
Is to feel in the dark
Directions are harder to take
Every time that we ask 

Love with a white piercing beam
Is to move from the black
Direction that renders us weak 
Every time we attack

We who are left at the death
Will be under a spell
One that cost victims their minds
With a brief glimpse of hell

We who were right all along
Will then read out your names
Those who stole secrets will pay

Because you're sleeping in his bed

Off to gather kind words and compliments

Consumed before the light

As long as there is night

Losing coats and hats in lovers? cars
You're losing friends
You don't know who they are
Climbing ladders that don't interest you
Chasing rabbits, well, you always do

Tie your tiger to an old tree root
You're sticking pins inside your soldier?s boots

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""

Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

 As we just ... alright ... let me ...' (Ty's voice fades)

It was a sunny afternoon, somewhere between April, May or maybe June
The year had been quite busy 
and I was just taking a break from having to make a tune
I was chilling with my cousin rude boys undercover just ... 
watching the place
Sitting opposite the tube 
and this girl walked up and said 'I recognise your face.
Your name's Ty isn't it? I seen you in this and that magazine'
I was quite chuffed really, 
looked slightly at my cousin and we both said 'seen!'
One month later she phones me up
'I'm in the area, can I come up?' I'm like 'please!'
Turned to my brethren said 
'I love you like a brother, but BRUSH you got to leave!'

(Tee talking)
'You know what I'm saying? You got to leave! If you met this girl right,
you'd understand. You - have - got - to - go. Thank you.'

Check my reflection in the mirror, 
spray a little air fresh, splash a little brute
Answer the intercom, 'is Tee there?' Oh,, she sounds cute!
I take her jacket and she's left with a white dress going from here to here
I offer her a drink, but she only wants water, I'm like 'oh each!'
The conversation goes from vague adult chat to thinly veiled come on's
Blood leaves my brain, my whole body's a drum stick ... anxious to drum on
How shall I approach this? I'm virtually brain dead plus the line's busy
I begin with a little friendly WWF and touch the titty!

(Girl talking, Ty whistling in background)
'Hold on, what are you doing? What are you doing? Are you trying to touch
any of this? Who are you? Just because ...' (Girl's voice fades)

Felt so ashamed! Had to excuse myself by pretending to take the piss
Walked to the mirror, splashed water on my face and said 'man what is this?'
Get a grip Ben, just because the girl's here doesn't mean you're in
Ha, this sexy bullshit can mess up the play 
and make you think your love is king

(Ty talking)
'Ohhh boy. Listen ... 
 you know when you're in one of those predicaments where it's like, 
 just, oh what can I say, I can't say ...' (Ty's voice fades)

I left the bathroom with a clear head, 
expecting her to moan, apologetic in the worst way
She's butt naked on the sofa, 
smiling like a joker 'T-why it's your birthdayyy!'

(Ty talking)
'No, no, no, no, no, no, no, why'know, no! 
 You don't, listen, you don't have to ask me what happened next! 
 Anyway, lets just say ... mighty fun was had by all!
 Of course this is fictional, so. why'know.'",The Tale,2001
Ty,"Uh, uh, uh, hardcore, [niggas]!
Uh, uh, uh, hardcore, j-j-j yeah... er...
Alright, well... got my shit down here... smoke that shit...
We bout to just do some nice stuff here wassup...
Aaaaaaaaaaaah...

UH! My style hurts doesn't it?
Turn around and your hole crews loving it
Uh, you tried stiff neck thugging it
Couldn't sleep 'cause your mind had a bug in it
Buzzing without weed, extract
And you thought I wasn't coming? Well you need a slap
Let me see, chapter three, verse one, and I'm on
Wait, fore warning you of the coming of kong
Come on, splash little fishy can you swim in the pond?
Are you that, breaking the wall will your building respond?
To the pressure, walking with the strength of my predecessor
Ancient, I never walk alone
I'm up against the stereo-mono-typical
Visualising wealth is not applicable
Now, my brain cries out for me to read
With movement inspired by Johnsy D and Benjy Read

[Chorus]
The Globe keeps spinning (The hole damn world is)
But I ain't moving (Excuse me?)
We can't keep joking (No no no no)
Break the lock if the door's not open now (Break it down break it down)
The Globe keeps spinning (The hole damn world is)
But I ain't moving (Excuse me?)
We can't keep joking (No no no no)
Break the lock if the door's not open now

Concepts get abandoned with no gloves
Traditional trends evaporate like soap suds
The innercity whirlpool will suck you up like
A person with a temper can [fuck] you up right?
Time to bring back down to syndromes
Custard in your eye like Bugsy Malone
You need to stay calm with napalm attached to ya
Embrace arm in gasoline strike a match to ya
Now, now do you feel enlightened?
Well I don't and I'm the one writing
Anything versus everything really means nothing
Can't be a king peacock - I hate strutting
Dressed up semi-jiggy I might frustrate somethin'
A lion in the wardrobe is ready to break somethin'
Mr Fantastic Fox
the Awkward individ' that makes the wack [shit] hot
My jazz addiction is a preminition of war
When visible tussels appear on the dance floor
The sweat breaks to the beat, freak of the month, year, decade
Vacuum the essay, now lets say
I'm one in a million, a million in one room
You want an interview with the killer of monsoons?
I'll sing sonnets to don and donnettes, ok?
I'm terrible with a broom sweeping your mess away

Ty Burrell,"Kermit, let’s begin
Describe the day you played Berlin
We rehearsed and then we walked about
We ate bratwurst and sauerkraut
That night at ten o’ three

Were you inside the portrait gallery
From ten o’clock to ten o’ four
Was when we did the show encore

Hmm, Frog we've got our doubts
Can you confirm your whereabouts
My alibi is watertight
The audience saw me sing all night

Monsieur we know you did the crime
I was on stage that whole time
Ask who sang Rainbow Connection

Thank you Kermit, no more questions
Hello, I think it’s time for good cop, romantic cop

Miss Piggy, you could end up locked inside
Now’s your chance to save your hide
Gentlemen, I did not know
It’s a crime to steal the show

Tell us how the art was taken
If you want to save your bacon
I haven’t seen your missing art
All I've stolen is audience hearts

We can give you a plea deal
All you have to do is squeal
I’m not a thief, I don’t know how
All I've ever taken is a bow

We’ll catch the swine that did this job
Give up the pig puns, creep
Go jump in a lake, that’s my suggestion
Thank you Piggy, no more questions

I think she likes me
I don’t think your puns are helping the investigation
You know, I think they did it
No they didn't
Yes they did, and we can pin it

If they did, how did they do it
If they didn't, how did they didn't
If they didn't then it’s easy, ’cause they simply didn't do it
If they did it, then I knew it, but we've nothing that can prove it

Oh, excuse me
Uh
Bring in the purple guy with the shnozz
Do you remember what you did
On the night you played Madrid?

I was hit by a raging bull
And rushed off stage to the hospital
Gonzo, what do you know
About the sculpture theft at Madrid’s Prado
I never saw the stolen busts
I spent the night in bed concussed

The truth Gonzo, the clock is tickin’
If you don’t believe me, ask the chicken
Camilla was there, she’ll co-operate
Madam, are you willing to corroborate

Bawk bawk begawk, begawk gawk gawk
Will someone get this chicken out of here
Calm down Camilla, it’s a routine inspection
Thank you Gonzo, no more questions
Let’s go from the start
What do you know about the stolen art

I didn't know there was a plan
Your accusation is far out man
The chances of us committing a crime
Are less than .009

Shern de shern de herf
Sher de chicky en de farney hug

To help with our investigation
Can you do a full translation

What the chef just said to you
Was schnoop do schnnop do schnook
It’s not Swedish

Argh
Wank wank wank
I can do an Elvis impression

Thank you Muppet's,no more questions
They didn't
No, they didn't
There’s no way they did the crime
They couldn't they’re too stupid
They’re not criminal masterminds

We do not know who did it, but we know who didn't do it
So we know who didn't do it yes we know who didn't do it
They’re incapable of being culpable",Interrogation Song,2014

Ty England,"When life's little troubles
Block the road you're going down
Don't beat your head against the wall
Just find another way around
If the bad guys are winning
Everything you're working for
Maybe you should change
The way that you're keeping score

When the weight of the world's
About to run you in the ground
You don't have to stand for that
You just take it lying down

Kick back - relax
Just let your train of concentration
Go and jump the tracks
At the end of your rope
Just cut yourself some slack
If it's more than you can hack
Kick back

What's the sense of burning up
Your candle at both ends?
Burns twice as bright but half as long
And it won't burn again
Quit living for tomorrow
'Cause it never comes to pass
Even when you take it slow, life's too fast
We're just spinning 'round
So tell me where's the rush?
You only get one ride, so prop your feet up

Of an uphill fight

Before I could ask you'd already answered
And to my surprise you said that you'd love to

And they all laughed when I stepped on your toes
But they got quiet when you moved in close
They lost their smiles

Oh, they got a laugh
But look who got the last dance

As they stood in line waiting to kiss the bride

I was the one standing by your side

I was minding my business
Thinking to myself
What a great life this is

Rockin' to the radio
I was through with love
All the fussing and fighting
It didn't seem worth
The thunder and lightning
Made up my mind
I was living my life alone

Just when my head was getting clearer
Took a little glance in the rearview mirror
Did a double take
'Cause I couldn't believe my eyes
She was right on my bumper
In a drop top mustang
Long hair flying
Pulling in the fast lane
'Cause I couldn't let her pass me by

When it comes right down to love
Even if you say forever
You won't ever ever get enough

Can't count the times

Swearing I was never
Gonna take that fall again
No sooner said then she turned the corner
Suddenly I'm a born again goner
Telling myself this one will never end

I guess God got tired of me bending his ear

Come in and set that suitcase down
It looks like you and I got lost and found
No need to be sorry, don't apologize
You don't need to ask it, just look in my eyes

Sure, I still feel the same
I still keep the flame, I still call your name
My love does endure

Sure, we can try again
Honey, you just move on in
I have always been sure

It was like double deja vu
When you came in I saw me come in too
Come in from the rain, come in from the blue
I've been missing me as much as I've been missing you

Sure, I still feel the same
I still keep the flame, I still call your name
My love does endure

Sure, we can try again

Sure as this road is winding towards eternity

I dropped my drink when she came walking by
By the time I got a grip
She slipped through my fingertips
And left me with my big mouth open wide

I should've asked her faster
But I waited too long
In a red hot minute
Like a flash she was gone
I didn't get her number 
I never got her name
A natural disaster
I should've asked her faster

She was talking to some cowboy in the corner
My one last chance to ask her on the floor
And just when I got the nerve
I got just what I deserve

Traded all the troubles on our minds 
One thing lead to another in the evening 
And I fell in love again for my last time 

Blame it on Mexico if you need a reason 
Say too much guitar music, tequila, salt and lime 
Blame it on Mexico, but she's the reason 
That I fell in love again for my last time 

Daylight dawned and found me in Del Rio 
In a rundown motel room as dark as hell 
I felt all the pains of a morning after 
And all alone as far as I could tell 

Why she left I have no way of knowing 
I guess she caught her train and that's a crime 
She took everything I ever wanted 
And I fell in love again for my last time

Too many new places
Too many stranger's faces

To the top of the hill

I went to pieces when she blew in
Like a strong man running through a hurricane wind
Before I had a clue how bad it would be
She tore my heart out and she showed it to me

Like a bone in a pit bull pen
She chewed me up and spit me out again
My knees still shake, my ears still ring
All in all it was a pretty good thing
All in all it was a pretty good thing

That was one ride that I'll never forget
I still ain't found all the pieces yet
She stripped my gears-she stole my shocks
And she left me sitting up here on these cinder blocks

Like a bone in a pit bull pen
She chewed me up and spit me out again
My knees still shake, my ears still ring
All in all it was a pretty good thing
All in all it was a pretty good thing

I know it's bound to sound a little crazy to you
But it sure was good for a minute or two

When a pickup truck flew by me out of control
As I watched in my headlights, he swerved left and then back right

I found him lying in the grass among the steel and glass
With an empty whiskey bottle by his side
Through the blood and tears, he whispered in my ear
A few last words just before he died

Don't tell mama I was drinking
Lord knows her soul would never rest
I can't leave this world with mama thinking
That I met the Lord with whiskey on my breath

I still think about that night, how that young man died
How others sometimes pay for our mistakes
Last thing on his mind as he left this world behind
Was knowing someone else's heart would break

The highway
Another day for the wanderer

Was out there
Around the corner from where we were

Cut and run
Straight back to Tennessee

But you stood true
A real rock
And never doubted me

I will be there
Any time you need me to
As much as you believed in me
I'm returning the faith to you
I'm returning the faith to you

With a sure hand
You gave love every step of the way

If it takes me
Forever
I'll give back everything that you gave

And when she cried I turned my head

He hit me for a dollar, I just turned and walked away
I was feeling high and mighty when I heard him say

""Pray for me, pray for me
Pray for me and I will pray for you""

I thought who is he to pray for me as I hit my power lock
And then the weight of my hypocrisy fell on me like a rock
I caught him at the corner and I gave him my last ten
I said, ""Please forgive me, brother and until we meet again""

""Pray for me, pray for me
Pray for me and I will pray for you""

You know each of us is broken somewhere deep inside
And we're really not that different when you strip away the pride
We've all got our struggles and chains that we can't break
And you never know the difference one simple prayer might make

I stood there on the corner and I watched him drifting off
As the sun behind St. Mary's made the shadow of a cross
On a street of busy people and places on the run
I felt like calling out to each and every one

We?re in a room full of people and your

Talking to yourself again till you

Find your closest friend, the door


Let?s take a walk out in the sun

You say ?Why? The clouds will come?

Just like all the times before


How can you survive

On whiskey and goodbyes

Does it satisfy, baby..


Chorus:

Don?t go off and hide

So scared of what the world will find

I can help you if you need it

You may not care for love

You made it clear, you?re minds made up

I can make your heart believe it


It will take your breath away

Just try, you?ll be amazed

It?ll bring new life to the dead


You just know without any proof

It can turn lies into truth

Yes, the best medicine you can get


Won?t you take my hand

Before you slip back there

And get nowhere


Chorus


Oh, make your heart believe it

I can?t watch you drown, drown

Sink to the bottom like a stone, cold

Unaware that you?re even going down, down

You do it, oh so naturally

Too long for granted
No wonder she left me behind

I swear I'd change
If she would give me one more chance
And to lift her up where she belongs
She loved me right and I loved her wrong

So I'm crying out for mercy
What do I have to do to have her forgive me?
I just wasted my time
Wondering if I could only have her love back

She gave all of herself

Ever wanted from me
And I never gave her enough

Lying, deceiving myself

Struggles for meaning

Several seasons with their treasons
Wrap the babe in scarlet covers, call it your own

Did he doubt or did he try?
Answers aplenty in the bye and bye
Talk about your plenty, talk about your ills
One man gathers what another man spills

Saint Stephen will remain
All he's lost he shall regain
Seashore washed by the suds and foam
Been here so long he's got to calling it home

Fortune comes a-crawling, Calliope woman
Spinning that curious sense of your own
Can you answer? Yes I can
But what would be the answer to the answer man?",St. Stephen,2018

Ty Tabor,"Summer wind blowing the grass on a hill
When was the last time that I stood still?
The wondering comes and goes, but it's sometimes clear
I look for the Voice that will move like the wind
I pray that I don't blow it off again
The rumbling man and my eyes have me trying not to hear
And I'm hoping there's nothing to fear

Let the truth set me free

Yesterday tries to remind me to see 
Over the towers
The place I must be
The lock on the door when it opens the room with the key
I complicate matters believing in man
Forgetting to look at the misshapen plans
It points at the one thing that sometimes is easy to see
That's not always how it should be

Fascinated
Complicated
Super-Ego's been inflated
Wonder why we hide inside and die
And should we all believe a lie . . . 

Sunday I went to the ""Church of the Hair""
Just like the boardwalk or a big county fair
I watch the commercial and try hard to just take it in
He said, ""Just believe and get anything
A red Lamborghini
A big diamond ring
Don't worry about the hungry and poor
We can pray for them""
And I wonder what God thinks of him",The Truth,1998
Ty Taylor,"Someone, someone's got me wrong
You thought that your love was strong
Now you're feelin' like such a fool
Poor you, you're thinkin' maybe if you said goodbye
You'll understand the reason why
The love you had felt so cool um hm

Oh but it's all right
Once you get past the pain
You'll learn to find your love again
So keep your heart open
Cause love will find a way

Sometimes we all feel a need to change
Our love we have to rearrange
And move on to something new yes you do
Your dreams feel like they're fallin' apart
You need to find a brand new start
But you're almost afraid to be true to yourself

Oh, but it's all right
Once you get past the pain
You'll learn to find your love again
So keep your heart open
Cause love will find a way

Love will find a way
Love will find a way

So now don't, don't be afraid of yourself
Just move on to something else
And let your love shine through
Again yes 'cause it's all right
Once you get past the pain
You'll learn to find your love again
So keep your heart open
Cause love will find a way",Love Will Find a Way [*],2012

Everything's gonna be alright

At the end of a long hard day
I don't want to be another brother

I want to look behind me 
And know this is my destiny
I want to keep rejoicing

You bared your sould I waltzed right in
You gave me everything

You spilled your guts on my best shoes
I keep it in, you let it loose
It's only love that makes you feel like I'm getting
So completely
Naked and you don't remember
How you let yourself become so unraveled
Your naked pretty as a heartache
Waiting for your second skin to settle in

My hardened heart can't hide me now
It loves as much as I allow
And in the end the eyeball army will just drag me down
And I'll be

Naked
Nothing but a heartache
And I know there's nothing that can hide me now
I'm naked
Nothing but a heartache
Going out exactly how
You came in

Got some money in the cut like I’m Jewish
You ain’t got no money on me than you useless

Every time you see me I’m with a new one
Every time you see me, man do nothing

I got a New York bitch, she out of Brooklyn
I gave that dope dick and now she hooked on

And if yo bitch out of line she don’t respect you
When I pull up on yo block I’m on business
When she with me she ain’t thinkin bout commitment
Said she ain’t been with a real one in a minute

These niggas tryin they hardest, you niggas still poor
Hunnit bottles of liq that’s what we live for
I’m bout them chains and watches that you got robbed for
You got a team of niggas ain’t on they job though

My lil bitch from LA stay in the A town
Move that back on that grape how she stay down
Every day I expect the same designer
If you don’t know homie, let me remind ya

Tydolla$ign,"She knew exactly who I was becoming
Reality of dreams, younger for memories of a still wonder
Of who I might be
And for her it’s hard to stomach what’s left behind
And what’s to come in the same introduction of a king
Just know everything coming can only give birth to the principle that by any means
I produce like eagles
Soar in the highest clouds to let my conscience free
So I can feed ex girls like sea gulls with better egos in out work
While these ambitions girl with the tip of my penis
To write stories, a young boy the genius
And I mean this, there’s never been a day off
Never been laid off, my own boss and my payoff is to get laid off
Get a break off just to rehire myself
For the take off

Tydolla$ign,"Way before your time the world knew this would happen
Was destiny to many, was just hard work for you
As you were brought into this world
You tried to find out about your surroundings
The people, the feeling of being alive and breathing the air
The smiles you see at that point are the ones you should always remember
Authentic is due to the choices you make for yourself
It'll be a bunch of fake smiles so easy to forget
But some although not healthy for them
Will create an understanding of what the word real means
Us and never eyes one of your greatest attributes
Others before thyself as long as thyself is taken care of is well being
And money, well, I know you know how to get money

Real niggas don’t die
Appetite for destruction
Just a nigga with an attitude
Always into something

Impala on eights, dope boys on crates
Swiss movement on watch, 45 on the waist
Got a million dollar hustle, a rich nigga face
White cocaine, rack it up on the plate
Alpina Beamer with the cavalier plates
My niggas dribble down in VA on the run from the DEA
That’s when niggas wore button ups and white ups like
H O V A, and everybody had Ye before 808s & Heartbreak
The streets was a shark tank, put money in the gold link
And loyalty was everything
Your lady held you down, with or without a wedding ring
Selling dope wasn’t settling
If you could smoke it they was selling it
Hard grind peddling
A street nigga pedigree, tryna leave a kingpin legacy
Pockets fat like Ledisi, thank you to the heavenly
Father for them dollars, I got it straighter than the letter T

100 miles and runnin'
Always into something
Yelling fuck the police
Like I’m straight up out of Compton
Real niggas don’t die
Appetite for destruction
Just a nigga with an attitude
Always into something

Dope man, dope man, that’s what they yelling
Pockets full of stones and an automatic weapon
Teenage outlaws, rebels without cause
Lost in this jungle where everybody is flawed
Middle finger to the law, best friends lay in morgues
And they wonder why our attitude’s raw
A real nigga never take a fall, that’s on god
Or never take on the false façade
Before that happens niggas blocks getting taked off
Appetite for destruction
That’s how we all function, and we get it how we live
Even if it’s gun busting
Number crunching with 8 balls for fiends luncheon
Anything to keep from ribs touching
Rims bumping, I blame it on Cube
He says it gets funky, a subject and a predicate
F the police, that’s a gangster nigga’s etiquette
And this nine filled with cop killers that’s sitting on my hip

100 miles and runnin'
Always into something
Yelling fuck the police
Like I’m straight up out of Compton
Real niggas don’t die
Appetite for destruction
Just a nigga with an attitude
Always into something",Always Into Something,2014

It’s a miracle I’m still standing! (Still standing)

Kicked us while we was down, don’t want to help us up
Damn!
Indoctrinated and banging before I could bust a nut
Cuttin’ up, couldn’t shut 'em up
Now I’m on my way upstate
Locked up then gave thanks, change my up
This remind me of the time I survived
But in my mind I knew that my date came up
Knew it was God, mamma tried, but couldn’t save him
And now we on our way up
Hinting that a prison break on the way, anticipating
They say it's like waiting on Judgment Day (Huh)
Now they praise us
But we downplay fame, and stay prayed up
Look where we came from
Yeah, we caged up, but they couldn't enslave us
(Miracle) Now they’re payin’ us, yup

How they stayed hatin’ on us, guess they didn’t know
We them boys, we them niggas
Look at all this money and all these bitches
But it’s still realness over millions
Keep God first and fuck them niggas
That switched up and got caught up in they feelings
I kept my ten toes down like I’m supposed to
Stay focused like I’m supposed to
And stay away from them broke dudes, like I’m ‘supposed to

You ain't never been on dropped off in the jungles
Teared Khakis, red bandana wrapped around your knuckles

Stopped at the Weiner Schnitzel, got socked in the jaw
By some sixties, I bombed back, the nigga pulled
Out a strap, said it's 6-0, I ducked then he missed me
Now I'm back to Bompton
Before I hit the hood, a nigga gotta stop in the swanson
Pick up a sack, had fifty for an eighth
And I only had fifty, made it last all day

I won't ever think I'm better than the next man

Baby I'm too busy countin' all these blessings

Yah, yah, yah
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Line 'em up, line 'em up, line 'em up
Swear the sun shinin' on me in my huddle
No matter the trouble surroundin' us
They don't see that it's a lot of us
Everybody move anonymous
Won't take that credit, I know where we get it
Them blessings be comin' from God above
I was doin' all kinda bad
Where the choir at? Tell 'em I need a verse
Hit the pew and tell God He's first
Hit the studio to body a verse
I remember pushin' mama's little white Hyundai with no gas money
I just bought a car, cash money
I ain't even tryna brag on it
I just tell it how it really is
I ain't trippin', they ain't feelin' this
I ain't sayin' I deserve nothin'
I'm just tryna talk about the benefits
I've been punchin' in the clock
Tryna keep the kitchen stocked
Man it's a blessin' 'cause we ain't ever had a lot
But all we need is all we got

If I ever took a loss, I learned a lesson

I put my mama in the crib, said, ""Stop stressin'""
I put my girl in a brand new diamond necklace
She said she need more of my love and affection
'Cause lately I've been workin' harder than ever
She said, ""Baby, you a boss, baby, clear your schedule
Dolla you a boss, let's do somethin' special
Take me on a PJ, we should go to Mexico
I've been down for you boy, since when the money was low""
Anything for my bae 'cause she a blessing
If you woke up this morning it's a blessing

If I ever took a loss, I learned a lesson

I took so many losses
Coulda lost it
Left 'em leakin' like a faucet
Almost cost me
Everything that I got, all of my fam
Part of the plan
I was eatin' fried bologna out of the pan
Y'all don't understand
I was tryna get it
I'm in that studio tryna keep it pushin'
Patty pies, boy I kept 'em cookin'
All I needed was the Mary Mary
But the God in me was havin' commentary, woo!
I got angels all around like Anita Baker
Blessings fallin' in line, guess I need a taper
And every loss is a lesson
Tell my haters I confess
Treat 'em like the green bubbles on the iPhone
I probably never read the message

If we only knew we were slaves to the pains of each other
One thing I believe I can learn
To see my enemy as my brother
Then we could be free, truly
Then love could wash away all the sorrows
I'm not afraid to bleed
If it means, we'll make a better today not tomorrow

One day I dream of telling my mama
""You ain't gotta work no more""
Same for my father, born in Ghana, down on that dirt road floor
Far as he came I can't complain, but pain is so subjective
Spend so much time countin' issues, I forget to count my blessings
Watch my cousins back at home, getting water out a well
While I watch my brother stacking stone, whippin' water by the scale
Tryna' get a mill' on the other side
They ain't got a meal, we don't recognize, we in heaven
So we think we live in hell
It's been getting kinda hard to tell
But

Sometimes I wake up and I look up in the sky
Asking why I'm alive when so many niggas died
And my pride won't let me give up, Lord as hard as I try
In those times I try to remember

That we could be free
If we only knew we were slaves to the pains of each other
One thing I believe if I can learn
To see my enemy as my brother
Then we could be free, truly
Then love could wash away all the sorrows
I'm not afraid to bleed

Love, love, love
We'll make a better today not tomorrow

I don't want to wait for the afterlife
I don't want a vigil by candle light
I don't want to be the new sacrifice
I don't want to turn into a poltergeist
Be a ghost at night full of broken dreams
Mama cryin' at a open casket
Cold as ice in a suit, three piece
All dressed up for Sunday masses
Pastor say, ""put faith in God""
But faith alone can't make things right
Fuck is you to patronize
Somebody son who daddy died?
Why they flood Baton Rouge?
Why the city singing Alton's blues?
Why, why, why, why?
I feel like Jadakiss every time I watch the news
What the fuck I got to lose?
So I'm down to bleed if it means things improve
You fools, saying ""all lives matter""
But it's black lives you refuse to include
Blocked from the polls
Locked in the hood, trying to stop you from voting and stop you from growing
And cops keep blowing and blowing
Keep black people rocking the cotton
They don't want you to own, but

Sometimes I wake up and I look up in the sky
Asking why I survived all the days that I could have died
Who am I in my place
To contemplate suicide?
In those times I try to remember

That we could be free, truly
If we only knew we were slaves to the pains of each other
One thing I believe I can learn
To see my enemy as my brother
Then we could be free, you and me
And love could wash away all the sorrows
I'm not afraid to bleed
