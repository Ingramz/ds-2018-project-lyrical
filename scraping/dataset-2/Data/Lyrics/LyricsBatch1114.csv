Beni,"Much as you blame yourself, you can't be blamed for the way that you feel
Had no example of a love that was even remotely real
How can you understand something that you never had
Ooh baby if you let me, I can help you out with all of that

Girl let me love you
And I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl let me love you
And all your trouble
Don't be afraid, girl let me help
Girl let me love you
And I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl let me love you
A heart of numbness, gets brought to life
I'll take you there

Girl let me love you
Girl let me love you baby, oh
Girl let me love you
Girl let me love you baby
Girl let me love you
Let me love you, let me love you, oh

I can see the pain behind your eyes
It's been there for quite a while
I just wanna be the one to remind you what it is to smile
I would like to show you what true love can really do

Girl let me love you
And I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl let me love you
And all your trouble
Don't be afraid, girl let me help
Girl let me love you
And I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl let me love you
A heart of numbness, gets brought to life
I'll take you there

Girl let me love you baby
Girl let me love you
Let me love you, let me love you baby
Girl let me love you
Girl let me love you baby
Girl let me love you
Let me love you, girl let me love you baby

For every heart that beats
For every heart that beats
For every heart that beats
For every heart that beats
Heart that beats

Girl let me love you
And I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself

And all your trouble
Don't be afraid, girl let me help
Girl let me love you
And I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl let me love you
A heart of numbness, gets brought to life
I'll take you there

Beniamino Gigli,"Nessun dorma! 
Nessun dorma!
Tu pure, o principessa
Nella tua fredda stanza
Guardi le stelle che tremano
D'amore e di speranza!

Ma il mio mistero e chiuso in me
Il nome mio nessun saprà!
No, no, sulla tua bocca lo dirò
Quando la luce splenderà!
Ed il mio bacio scioglierà
Il silenzio che ti fa mia!

Il nome suo nessun saprà
E noi dovrem, ahimè! morir! morir!

Dilegua, o notte!
Tramontate, stelle!
Tramontate, stelle! 
All'alba vincerò!
Vincerò!

Benita Charles,"I don't hang around that place no more
I'm tired of wearing circles in the floor
And I don't carry myself very well
I've gotten so much braver
Can you tell

I'm happy
Can't you see
I'm alright
But I miss you Amber Lee

And I line my secrets up all one by one
I put 'em all away when I was done
And I would really love to hear your voice sometime
To close a little distance in my mind

I'm happy
Can't you see
I'm alright
But I miss you Amber Lee
Amber Lee

Where have you been all these years
And how could you just disappear
And when did you stop

Benita Charles,"INTRO
Those happy hours I spent with you
That lovely afterglow
Most of all I miss you so

Your sweet caresses, each rendezvous
Your voice so soft and low
Most of all I miss you so-o-o

You once filled my heart with no regrets, no fears
Now you find my heart filled to the top with tears

I'll always love you and want you, too
How much you'll never know
Most of all I miss you so-o-o

I'll always love you and want you, too
How much you'll never know
Most of all I miss you so-o-o

Benita Hill,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!",The Christmas Song,2001
Benita Hill,"Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on, our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

Benita Hill,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
[Chorus]

Benito Camacho,"Se me olvidaba decirte que te amo
Que te quiero como a nadie yo he querido

Sin tus caricias yo me siento mal herido
Y sin tus besos y sin ti no sé vivir

Te quiero mucho y sé que soy correspondido
Y eso me hace mucho mucho muy feliz

Si yo supiera que tu nunca me has querido
De la tristeza me pudiera yo morir

Te quiero y me quieres
Te adoro y me adoras
Vida mía, mi cuerpo mi vida y
Mi alma son de ti

Te llame en la madrugada 
Pidiéndote explicaciones 
Del por qué hoy pa' ti soy nada

Te digan tus amistades 
Que me han visto fatal 
Que ni parezco el mismo de antes 

Es muy probable 
Que me falte el orgullo 
Y salga a buscarte 
Probablemente disimulo 

No observarte 
Aunque me llenes los ojos 
Con esa belleza 
Que siempre me tuvo a tu antojo 

Probablemente 
Esto dure sólo un tiempo 
O quizás sea permanente 
Y me he tatuado tu recuerdo 

Y es que no logro olvidarte 
Me haces falta a cada paso 
Desearía que por lo menos 
Pensaras en reintentarlo 

Probablemente 
Solo sea cuestión de tiempo 
Para que caigas en cuenta 
Que necesitas mis besos 

Y que este amor no es desechable 
No se borran los momentos 
Te hice mía tantas veces 
Dudo que tú olvides eso

Esto sólo está en mi mente

Benito Gonzalez,"It begins to tell
'Round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well, till after sundown
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad
'Round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too
When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

Let our hearts take wings'

Benjah,"(You just gotta know)
You ever feel like life just comin' at ya a million miles an hour?
(You just gotta know)
You just gotta know
Somebody's holdin' it all together

Life is like an elevator, a lot of ups and downs
People pushin' your buttons and gettin' jerked around
I used to lurk around town tryin' to work around
Workin' so that I could hit the ground with the perfect sound
Even perfect sound sounds like work
When you spend your time flirtin' with the crown in the perp
I was bound for Berzerk with a layover in Crazy,
Got lazy Jay-Z hopin' rocker fellas paid me
Or rockin' ladies were caught me a Mercedes
But that whole dream was in Ã¢??80's baby
Missed that shot like the cop that's crooked
TV goes off, third eye still lookin'
Mom still cookin', I can always go home
Even though I'm five years past grown (five years past grown)
Here I go again, I'm still chasin' the wind, I can't win
When it gets hot, it boils down to sin
If Heaven ain't a gift, then I ain't getting' in (man)

I can't even find the words for the way I feel
So I paint a picture, I paint a picture
I've been goin' down this road, seen some crazy things
So I paint a picture, you gots to see it

You just gotta know
You just gotta know
You just gotta know
You just gotta know

(Yeah) I sit and hear the guitars play,
Wonder if they could, what would stars say or Venus and Mars say
Or say that we want it our way,
Stars so desperate to shine that they go on livin' the hard way
The intellect to travel to Mars but so blind,
We worship Venus but she don't even know who we are
And she never cared why cuz she wasn't there
When I was tryin' to drown my sorrows in a pool of despair
I ain't perfect, sometimes I feel worthless,
Worth less than that is the image that I'da purchased
Man, from the shades to the shirt to the shoes,
Just another fool tryin' to cover he's confused, that ain't cool
Sometimes I hate the man in the mirror
Cuz I know he's a liar and a cheater and a killer
People say they love him but they love what he can give 'em,
But deep inside he knows that there's a reason for him livin'

I can't even find the words for the way I feel
So I paint a picture, I paint a picture
I've been goin' down this road, seen some crazy things
So I paint a picture, you gots to see it

You just gotta know
You just gotta know
You just gotta know
You just gotta know

(Uh) You know I need you like aqua,
Day without ya got me so nauseous,
If I ain't cautious, I'm gonna self-inflict my sickness
You know it's true, you as my witness
At how you witness my inconsistence
Yes, the ovation when I need your assistance
And I just gotta know that even though I'm a misfit
I'm still worth more than calamity's French kiss
Yes I'm loved, and I'm pursued
And though I can't feel it, still I know that it's true
Somebody woke me up, and yeah, I know it was you
And yet I keep tryin' to steer clear of your view
Cuz if you get me, I know that you got me
But I'm so insecure I can't believe that you want me
But then I heard you went on your way to adopt me
Well you can have my all if you swear you won't drop me
Cuz I gotta know (yeah)

You just gotta know (gotta know, gotta know)
You just gotta know (gotta know, gotta know that it's real)
You just gotta know (gotta know, gotta know that it's real)
You just gotta know (hey, hey, gotta know that it's real)

I don't wanna be alone 

Uh, tears hit her cheeks, like Tyson's glove
Pain hit his heart, as she fights for love
She says don't go, but the call came,
It's time to deploy, and they called his name
Close to zero five-hundred, her mind starts wanderin'
Butterflies, tummy starts rumblin'
Queasy, uneasy, tryin' to hold it all together
She doesn't want their last moments here to be
Unpleasant

The car ride is quiet, outside it's hard to fight it
Inside it's like she's dyin', that's when she started cryin'
He tries to comfort her, ""Baby, it's alright, liar""
That's what she screams louder from the thoughts of fight
They pray, it's okay, ""I'll promise that I'll be safe"" uh
That's what he tells her as he looks her in the face
And as he walks away, lookin' in her eye
Last kiss as they say

[Chorus]
I pray this is not our last goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

Uh, graduation, her nine weeks are done
Hoorah, hooplah, now it's time to move on
Leavin' out of basic, she just got her assignment
She's headed off to war and it's hard for her to face it
Or face her, the daughter that she's leavin'
It's hard to come to terms with the truth, no one
Believes it and even when it's starrin' in ya face, you don't
Receive it

She hears mommy and it's just like her heart
Stopped beatin' (beatin', beatin') inhales heavy breathin'
Worried when she leaves she may not be back to
See them, her baby girl, and the family that she loves
Tryin' to hold back the tears right now is tough
She fights to stay strong, gotta hold on
She says a prayer, just tryin' to find a calm
Thoughts of eternity, then back to reality
And then she tells her family

I don't wanna

Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice
But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you dear

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think I was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible
'Cause everything is new
And everything is you
And all I've learned has overturned
What can I do

In one night so long?
Could there be enough love
To combat this night stretching on?

I will dig my trench in hope
It won't be my grave
My spirit is more than
My flesh is brave

Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight

I will light my candle
And burn it bright in an endless night
I can handle
I can burn it bright in an endless night

Come join me brothers, sisters
Bring your children too
We will stand together
Our faith will bring us through

If this is the beginning
Of the end of time
How much longer have we
Got to sing this rhyme

Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight

I will light my candle
And burn it bright in an endless night
I can handle
I can burn it bright in an endless night

Tonight, tonight
I will light my candle
And burn it bright in an endless night

I see the light of a new day
I hold my breath and I pray
That we'll be stronger
That we'll be stronger

I'll reach out and take your hand
Our love will give us strength to stand
And we'll be wiser
We'll be wiser

I will light my candle
And burn it bright in an endless night

Benjamin,"Si me dieran a elegir una vez más 
Te elegiría sin pensarlo 
Es que no hay nada que pensar 
Que no existe ni motivo, ni razón 
Para dudarlo ni un segundo 
Porque tú has sido lo mejor 
Que tocó este corazón 
Y que entre el cielo y tú yo me quedo contigo. 

Si te he dado todo lo que tengo 
Hasta quedar en deuda conmigo mismo 
Y todavía preguntas si te quiero tú de qué vas. 

Si no hay un minuto de mi tiempo 
Que no me pasas por el pensamiento 
Y todavía preguntas si te quiero. 

Si esto no es querer entonces dime tu lo que será 
Si necesito de tus besos pa´que pueda respirar 
Y de tus ojos que van regalando vida 
Y que me dejan sin salida 
Y para que quiero salir 
Si nunca he sido tan feliz 
Que te prefiero más que nada en este mundo. 

Si te he dado todo lo que tengo 
Hasta quedar en deuda conmigo mismo 
Y todavía preguntas si te quiero, tú de qué vas. 

Si no hay un minuto de mi tiempo 
Que no me pasas por el pensamiento 
Y todavía preguntas si te quiero. 

Y es que no ves que toda mi vida tan solo depende de ti.

Des couloirs infinis
Peu de feuilles aux arbres
Des flocons tombent au ralenti
Le soleil se sale
Nos pas se suivent dans la plaine
Lorsque trop loin nos corps se plaignent
Ne regrette rien

Tout au long de la vie
La tournée des lacs
Des bras de mères de quelques taudis
Sont remis à sac
Nos pas se suivront dans la tombe
Viens on s’envole vas-y on tombe
Ne regrette rien

Communément on le recense sous le nom de l’amour
Communément on le ressent mieux l a nuit que le jour
Mieux la nuit que le jour
Mieux la nuit que le jour

(OrelSan : )
Est-ce que nos instants d’extase
Laisseront des traces
Ou presque des remords
Une amertume après la fonte des classes
Avec le temps les sentiments les plus profonds s’effacent
On joue nos rôles du mieux possible

Un jour on tombe les masques
Interroge l’avenir son désastre
Peu d’option relations néfastes nos passions trépassent
Si l’amour est dans l’air des classes
Ne regrette pas l’espace
Les vibrations l’excitation
Les nuits d’action

Le ciel est gris
Les anges pleurent
Les nouvelles déceptions
Feront les vieilles rancœurs
La routine les sales manies les mauvaises habitudes prennent de l’ampleur
Le quotidien cohabite mal avec les etres branleurs
Trop de classe pour un seul coup de maitre chanteur
Les memes disputes et je discute avec le sampleur
Ne regrette pas les fresques l’apogée
La beauté du geste
Ne regrette pas l’effort les chasses au trésor

Des couloirs infinis de glace et de marbre
Un froid qui brûle un froid qui détruit
Le soleil se cabre
Nos pas se suivent dans la neige
Sur la grand’ roue dans les manèges ne regrette rien
Ne regrette rien ne regrette rien
Ne regrette rien

(OrelSan :)

Benjamin Biolay,"J'm'appelle Slimane et j'ai quinze ans
J'vis chez mes vieux à La Courneuve
J'ai mon C.A.P. d'délinquant
J'suis pas un nul j'ai fait mes preuves
Dans la bande c'est moi qu'est l'plus grand
Sur l'bras j'ai tatoué une couleuvre

J'suis pas encore allé en taule
Paraît qu'c'est à cause de mon âge
Paraît d'ailleurs qu'c'est pas Byzance
Que t'es un peu comme dans une cage
Parce que ici tu crois qu'c'est drôle
Tu crois qu'la rue c'est les vacances.

J'ai rien à gagner, rien a perdre
Même pas la vie
J'aime que la mort dans cette vie d'merde
J'aime c'qu'est cassé
J'aime c'qu'est détruit
J'aime surtout c'qui vous fait peur
La douleur et la nuit.

J'ai mis une annonce dans Libé
Pour m'trouver une gonzesse sympa
Qui bosserait pour m'payer ma bouffe
Vu qu'moi, l'boulot pour que j'y touche
Y m'faudrait deux fois plus de doigts
Comme quoi, tu vois, c'est pas gagné.

Ce que j'voudrais, c'est être au chôme du
Palper du blé sans rien glander
Pi comme ça, j'serais à la sécu
J'pourrais grattos me faire remplacer
Toutes les ratiches que j'ai perdues
Dans des bastons qu'ont mal tourné.

J'ai rien à gagner, rien à perdre
Même pas la vie
J'aime que la mort dans cette vie d'merde
J'aime c'qu'est cassé
J'aime c'qu'est détruit
J'aime surtout tout c'qui vous fait peur
La douleur et la nuit

J'ai même pas d'tunes pour m'payer d'l'herbe
Alors, je m'défonce avec c'que j'peux
Le trychlo, la colle à rustine
C'est vrai qu'des fois ça fout la gerbe
Mais pour le prix, c'est c'qu'on fait d'mieux
Et pi, ça nettoie les narines.

Le soir, on rôde sur les parkings
On cherche une B.M. pas trop ruinée
On l'emprunte pour une heure ou deux
On largue la caisse à la Porte Dauphine
On va aux putes, juste pour mater
Pour s'en souvenir l'soir dans nos pieux.

J'ai rien à gagner, rien à perdre
Même pas la vie
J'aime que la mort dans cette vie d'merde
J'aime c'qu'est cassé
J'aime c'qu'est détruit
J'aime surtout tout c'qui vous fait peur
La douleur et la nuit

Y'a un autre truc qui m'branche aussi
C'est la musique avec des potes
On a fait un groupe de hard rock
On répète le soir dans une cave
Sur des amplis un peu pourris
Sur du matos un peu chourave.

'n a même trouvé un vieux débile
Qui voulait nous faire faire un disque
Ça a foiré parce que c'minable
Voulait pas qu'on chante en kabyle
On y a mis la tête contre une brique
Que même la brique, elle a eu mal.

Des fois, j'me dis qu'à 3000 bornes
De ma cité, y'a un pays
Que j'connaîtrai sûrement jamais
Que peut-être c'est mieux, peut-être c'est tant pis
Qu'là-bas aussi, j'serai étranger
Qu'là-bas non plus, je serai personne.

Alors, pour m'sentir appartenir
A un peuple, à une patrie
J'porte autour de mon cou sur mon cuir
Le keffieh noir et blanc et gris
Je m'suis inventé des frangins
Des amis qui crèvent aussi.

Benjamin Biolay,"Je me souviens d'un coin de rue
Aujourd'hui disparu
Mon enfance jouait par là
Je me souviens de cela
Il y avait un' palissade
Un taillis d'embuscades
Les voyous de mon quartier
Venaient s'y batailler

À présent il y a un café
Un comptoir tout neuf qui fait de l'effet
Une fleuriste qui vend ses fleurs aux amants
Et même aux enterrements

Je revois mon coin de rue
Aujourd'hui disparu

Je me souviens d'un triste soir
Où le cœur sans espoir
Je pleurais en attendant
Un amour de quinze ans
Un amour qui fut perdu
Juste à ce coin de rue

Et depuis j'ai beaucoup voyagé
Trop souvent en pays étrangers
Mondes neufs constructions et démolitions
Vous me donnez des visions

Je crois voir mon coin de rue
Et soudain apparus
Je revois ma palissade

Mes deux sous de muguet de printemps
Mes quinze ans… mes vingt ans

Benjamin Biolay,"Le Grand Café

Au Grand Café vous entrez par hasard
Tout ébloui par les lumières du boul'vard
Bien installé devant la grande table
Vous avez bu, quelle soif indomptable
De beaux visages fardés vous disaient bonsoir
Et la caissière se levait pour mieux vous voir
Vous étiez beau vous étiez bien coiffé
Vous avez fait beaucoup d'effet
Beaucoup d'effet au Grand Café.

Comme on croyait que vous étiez voyageur
Vous avez dit des histoires d'un ton blagueur
Bien installé devant la grande table
On écoutait cet homme intarissable
Tous les garçons jonglaient avec Paris-Soir
Et la caissière pleurait au fond d'son tiroir
Elle vous aimait, elle les aurait griffés
Tous ces gueulards, ces assoiffés

Ces assoiffés du Grand Café

Par terre on avait mis de la sciure de bois
Pour que les cracheurs crachassent comme il se doit
Bien installé devant la grande table
Vous invitiez des Ducs, des Connétables
Quand on vous présenta, soudain, l'addition
Vous avez déclaré : Moi, j'ai pas un rond
Cette phrase-là produit un gros effet
On confisqua tous vos effets
Vous étiez fait au Grand Café.

Depuis ce jour, depuis bientôt soixante ans
C'est vous l'chasseur, l'commis de restaurant
Vous essuyez toujours la grande table
C'est pour payer cette soirée lamentable
Ah, vous eussiez mieux fait de rester ailleurs
Que d'entrer dans ce café plein d'manilleurs
Vous étiez beau, le temps vous a défait
Les mites commencent à vous bouffer

Benjamin Biolay,"Le vieux piano de la plage ne joue qu'en fa qu'en fatigué
Le vieux piano de la plage possède un la qui n'est pas gai
Un si cassé qui se désole
Un mi fané qui le console
Un do brûlé par le grand soleil du mois de juillet
Mais quand il joue pour moi les airs anciens que je préfère

Un frisson d'autrefois
M'emporte alors dans l'atmosphère
D'un grand bonheur dans une petite chambre
Mon joli cœur du mois de septembre
Je pense encore encore à toi
Do mi si la

Le vieux piano de la plage ne joue qu'en sol en solitude
Le vieux piano de la plage a des clients dont l'habitude
Est de danser samedi dimanche
Les autres jours seul sur les planches
Devant la mer qui se souvient il rêve sans fin
C'est alors que je sors tout courbatu

De ma cachette
Et que soudain dehors tremblant, ému,
Devant lui j' m'arrête
Et c'est inouï tout ce que je retrouve
Comme cette musique jolie m'éprouve
Me fait du mal me fait du bien
Je n'en sais trop rien

Adieu, adieu piano tu sais combien peuvent être cruelles
Ces notes que tu joues faux mais dans mon cœur ouvrant ses ailes
S'éveille alors la douce rengaine
De mon heureux sort ou de mes peines
Lorsque tu tapes, tapes, toute la semaine mais le samedi
Quand les jeunesses débarquent
Tu sais alors brigand de la plage
Que ton souvenir les marque
Et qu'un beau soir passé l'bel âge
Un autre que moi devant la piste s'arrêtera là et sera triste

Pour parvenir accru au bout de nos chagrins

Mais parfois me reviennent
Des rengaines insensées
Trois milliers d'éoliennes
Des amours désossés
Et d'autres bien plus chiennes
Mais peu d'eux s'arrangeait
Rien dont je me souvienne
Il y a bien sûr ces nuits
Où la mémoire se raye
Il y a bien sur ta nuque
Et des boucles d'oreilles
Des mots glaçants qui marquent
Bien plus que les coups
Et puis aussi ces marques
De suçons dans mon cou
Je me rappelles à peine
Mais je me souviens
D'avoir fait de la peine
À ceux que j'aimais bien
D'avoir quasi vécu
D'eau fraîche et puis de vin
Je n'ai pas posé nu
J'ai fraudé tous les trains
Je m'en rappelles plus
Mais parfois me reviennent
Ces armées de cocus
Sous de lourds ciels de traîne
Battant le pavé nu
Je prenais pas tangente
Grâce à quelques gros culs
La vie fut bien charmante
Il y a bien quelques soirs
Où la mémoire recrée
Ta petite robe noir
Et ton grain de beauté
Celui sur ta poitrine
Comme un astre égaré
Quand la nuit de morphine
Devient l'aube dorée

Mais je m'en souviens
J'ai tout oublié
Mais tout me revient
Ces volées de mots crus
Qui atterrissaient bien
Entre le lit et le mur
On se faisait du bien
Mais parfois c'est le pire
La mémoire joue des tours
Et met un point d'honneur à salir nos amours
Mais le cœur et les tripes ne portent pas d'amure
Et l'amour en principe est une piqûre qui dure
Il y a toujours ces nuits
Où la mémoire ne flanche
Que sur quelques détails
Sans la moindre importance

L'espoir se fait la paire
Et plus les nuits défilent
Plus le cœur est de pierre
Plus la mémoire me perd
Plus la mémoire me perd",La Mémoire,2017

D'un homme singe et d'un cadran
De cette douleur entre les dents
De la douceur d'aucun printemps

Tout en les maudissant au fond
Je me rappelle de quelques friches

Aujourd'hui encore je m'entiche

Sans rancœur ni rancune

Je me souviens de leurs amants
Sale tête de con, sale tête de gland
Y'a trois quart d'heure j'avais trente ans
Le cul d'un orang-outan
Je me rappelle de pas grand chose
Un coin de ciel qui vire au mauve
J'étais déjà bien peu de choses
Comme bien des rebelles sans causes

Y'a pas deux plombes j'avais quarante
La vie était déjà moins marrante
Tord boyaux couleur amarante
Chaque été en douce pente

La vie n'aime pas qu'on la regarde
Dans les yeux
Elle peut te faire croire par mégarde
Qu'elle est deux
Mais elle n'est qu'une
Sans rancœur ni rancune
Aucune

Long soupir embrouilles et brouillard
Petites combines, faux débrouillard
Je vois mon avenir de vieillard
Comme un train toujours en retard

Y'a pas cinq heures j'avais quinze ans
Déjà la rage, c'était déjà les gens
Déjà les yeux rougis de sang
Déjà le nez au firmament

Y'a quelques mois
J'avais quinze ans
Mais j'aimais pas",Volver,2017

Prepare a little time to reminisce
On all that eventually falls into nothingness

Before we all get to the knowing 
All will be gone

Gambling on memory's lane
I tried a trip through all the pavements and fields 
But I lost 'cause all had changed 
Like the road I use to cross to school  
Is now full of prostitutes
No wonder why the priest is dead
No wonder why the priest is dead
Oh brother when did you get married?
Neighbors where did you vanish to?
If it was to a wonderland
Well it's not known to my kind, mankind

Before we all get to the knowing
All will be gone 
 
And what about relationship?
What is it about relationships that we don't get?
Here we are always thinking we've learnt
Only to get smacked and realize we are but mere students of life
And feels like
We've been fighting a lost battle
To have always realize at the end of it all
It feels like
We've been brought to a royal banquet
Just to be served a brew and a wretched floor

It doesn't mater 
All because am here now and it's too late to go back anyways

Be my favorite punch, he said

Dressed in black a class that seem too far too fetched

The cup is full stop praying for more exposure""

So clear you could hardly miss it, you could hardly miss it

I am listening to the advice
Slowly, slowly, please, slowly
We have a lot of time
Sometimes I would wish you were I 
To see clearly, not just visualize 

Many people said
Oh I’m lost, I’m a bastard, oh am lost
Those same people will pray 
For the best, for their own brothers
So why would I quiver but quiver a little, then burst in laughter 

(He laughs)

Read all the books and you will find
Nothing new has been hidden underneath the sun 
Integrity is sometimes hard to climb
But I look up, not down, who knows might go a bit further up there

You are lost, you are a bastard, you're lost
Those same people will pray 
For the best to for their own sisters 

And so friend I will just quiver a little, then burst in laughter

Life is as cold just not literally as in Greenland
Where snowfall is the norm as opposed to the ray of sunlight but 
Like the boy who woke up one morning to see his mother
On the floor then he screamed 
""Wake up mother""

Oh, just quiver a little

Who, who is next in line to get speared?

Bad mouth, bad habits

Though I know god created me beautifully
But don't you know beauty will forever kill

Oh!
There he is 
Wasting no time, packing

Well they say no man can be a prophet in his own country
And so I left and here I am
Come on embrace me!
I am your brother!
Now whilst he kept on talking
In his left pocket laid the prose of the magnificent Orwell
His right hand embraced a battered guitar borrowed
'Borrowed from me!'
Come to think about it
I think a few days ago I heard him talk
About how God blessed an eagle with 54 stars
And so maybe he's gone, he's gone
Wandering around looking for his kind of star 
But even stars 
If we think about, even beautiful stars 
They tend to shoot through the night
And you will never find them again!
Never and never and never again!

Don't you ever judge Winston boy
 
'Cause one day this boy might be the man 
Though clearly nobody knows when nor how 
One day this boy will stand in front of a pulpit

Underground to upper ground in the depths of I will surely survive

Although you're full of misery 
You mustn't show a trace of sadness 
Never look for sympathy

Sometimes face humiliation 
While you were burning up inside 

Facing reality is often hard to do 
When it seems happiness is gone 

You've got to learn to hide your tears 
And tell your heart life must go on 

You've got to learn to leave the table 
When love's no longer being served 
To show everybody that you're able 
To leave without saying a word 

You've got to learn to hide your sorrow 
And go on living as before 
What good is thinking of tomorrow
Who knows what it may have in store

Sort out your spinning head

Stop, don't say that, dear
That you wanted him here
Stop, don't give him the clear

Take a picture of them
Take a picture of them

If you are afraid, don't be
I have the whole thing planned
We'll start in the ocean, baby
And when we find the land
We will be thankful to
All of our friends
That they didn't leave us
As we got to the end

Take a picture of them
Take a picture of them
Take a picture of them
Take a picture of them

If you find your faith in
Your parents' God
Don't be so quick to
Point out the flaws in it

You've been around and you've seen
The way that things work
But you need a compass to
Get around your house",Pictures,2011

Tarot cards
Said I'm already dead
Crystal ball
Fell down onto my head
Tenderness
If I want it I pay
My true love
Well she threw it away
CHORUS
But I can shine it all on
I can shine it all on
I can shine it all on
And still be amazed
Had some money
And a hole in my pocket
Had a house
But I forgot to lock it
Took a drag
>From a smoke that may kill me
What a drag
How the winter wind chills me
CHORUS
I'll shine it on just like MacBeth
In the face of certain death
Of a salesman or a king
And when the palm trees are on fire
I'll take my boat out on the sea
Had a face
But I never could save it
Hada kid
But I never would name it
Have a life
Well, that's what they call it
It's a road
But I guess I could crawl it

Benjamin Francis Leftwich,"Take me to the docks, there's a ship without a name there
And it is sailing to the middle of the sea
The water there is deeper than anything you've ever seen
Jump right in and swim until you're free

I will remember your face
'Cause I am still in love with that place
But when the stars are the only things we share
Will you be there?

Money came like rain to your hands while you were waiting
For that cold long promise to appear
People in the churches started singing above their hands
They say, ""My God is a good God and He cares""

I will remember your face
'Cause I am still in love with that place
When the stars are the only things we share
Will you be there?

It started with a feeling, I can make a brand new start
Gonna go out, gonna shake off all the demons of the day
Gonna sing out, gonna stay out 'cause the rain has gone away

I've been waiting for the summer to come
So I wait here
Waiting for the light of the sun
I've been waiting for the summer to come

And I started to believe in the hope of better days
Then the wind changed in the garden
And the darkness went away

Je cause de cette chose qui fait peur à entendre
Un thème qui risque fort de surprendre
De quoi je parle ? De ce qu'ils ont à craindre
Révolution annoncée et pas la moindre
Comment faire quand l'essentiel on le perd de vu
Le peuple en détresse, lésé par vous
Va-t-on s'contenter de c'qu'on nous donne
Ne rêvez pas en 2002, y'a maldonne
Trop de différence entre riche et pauvre
De laisser pour compte parqués comme des épaves
J'aimerais voir autre chose quand je cligne des yeux
Pourquoi pas c'qu'ils nous promettent dans les cieux
J'suis p't'être trop pessimiste
C'monde ressemble a une scène surréaliste
J'suis p't'être trop idéaliste
Quand j'dis que je le verrai sans fascistes

Normal dans ses rues voit comme ça pue

Révolution, mot qui fait trembler l'Etat,
On y fait appel quand plus rien ne va,
Vu l'ampleur qu'ont pris les choses on y avance à grands pas.
Vu les conditions de vie on peut pas aller plus bas.
Allez leur dire, aux politiciens et ceux autour d'eux, qu'ils s'mettent bien en tête :
""c'est nous contre eux"". Y a trop de haine dans nos yeux
Quand j'vois les fausses factures, transferts de compte et dessous de table.
Que d'autres font la manche et n'ont rien à bouffer à table
Et ce bon père de famille qui trime pour un salaire minable,
Une mère seule qui élève ses gosses, vie de ces ménagères

If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,

Got a heart just like a stone,

There was Hannah pouring water on a drowning man!

Is like travelin' through Alaska in your BVDs.

Miss Otis regrets, she's unable to lunch today. 
She is sorry to be delayed, 
but last evening down in Lover's Lane she strayed, madam, 
Miss Otis regrets, she's unable to lunch today. 
When she woke up and found that her dream of love was gone, madam, 
She ran to the man who had led her so far astray, 
And from under her velvet gown, 
She drew a gun and shot her love down, madam, 
Miss Otis regrets, she's unable to lunch today. 
When the mob came and got her and dragged her from the jail, madam, 
They strung her upon the old willow across the way, 
And the moment before she died, 
She lifted up her lovely head and cried, madam

Benjamin Northey,"There was a guy at my school when I was in high school
We'd ride side by side in the morning on our bicycles
Never even spoken or faced each other
But on the last hill we'd race each other

When we reached the racks we'd each go our own way
I wasn't in his classes, I didn't know his name
When we finally got to speak he just stared at his feet
And mumbled a sentence that ended with 'James'

I was young and caught in the crowd
I didn't know then what I know now
I was dumb, and I was proud
And I'm sorry
If I could go back do it again
I'd be someone you could call friend
Please please believe that I'm sorry

Well he was quite a big guy, kinda shy and quiet
When the kids called him weird he didn't try to deny it
Every lunchtime he'd spend walking by himself
Round the boundary of the grounds til he heard the bell

Well one day I found him, joined him on his walk
We were silent for a while until we started to talk
I told him my family were fighting in court
He said his step-dad and him always fought

We talked about music, he was into punk
Told me all the bands that I liked were junk
I said I'd never heard the songs the sex pistols sang
I laughed back at him and then the bell rang

I was young and caught in the crowd
I didn't know then what I know now
I was dumb, and I was proud
And I'm sorry
If I could go back do it again
I'd be someone you could call friend
Please please believe that I'm sorry

It was after school in the afternoon
The corridors were crowded as we came out of the rooms
Three guys I knew pushed him into the cement
Threw away his bag and said he had no friends

He yelled that he did and he looked around
Tried getting up but they pushed him on down
That's when he saw me, called out my name
And I turned my back, and just walked away
Yeah I turned my back, and just walked away

I was young and caught in the crowd
I didn't know then what I know now
I was dumb, and I was proud
And I'm sorry

Stay - maybe she'll come back again'

Then when I wake up, I'm all covered in sex
With eyes that fall somewhere between rubies and stars
Don't look at me baby or I'll flex

If you and I were just ten feet closer
Then I'd make you understand
That everything I want to do to your body, baby
I would do to your head

Benjamin Verdery,"Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today 
To get through this thing called life

Electric word life
It means forever and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell you
There's something else
The after world

A world of never ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night

So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one, Dr. Everything'll Be Alright
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, baby 

'Cause in this life
Things are much harder than in the after world
In this life
You're on your own

And if the elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy, punch a higher floor

If you don't like the world you're living in
Take a look around you
At least you got friends

You see I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
(Ah, ah) is all I heard

Are we gonna let the elevator
Bring us down
Oh, no let's go!

Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana 
'Til they put us in the truck, let's go!

We're all excited 
But we don't know why
Maybe it's 'cause
We're all gonna die

And when we do (When we do)
What's it all for (What's it all for)
You better live now
Before the grim reaper come knocking on your door

Tell me, are we gonna let the elevator bring us down
Oh, no let's go!

Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Look for the purple banana 
'Til they put us in the truck, let's go!

C'mon baby
Let's get nuts
Yeah
Crazy

Let's go crazy

Are we gonna let the elevator bring us down
Oh, no let's go!
Go crazy

I said let's go crazy (Go crazy)
Let's go, let's go 
Go 
Let's go

Dr. Everything'll be alright 
Will make everything go wrong
Pills and thrills and daffodils will kill
Hang tough children

He's coming
He's coming
Coming

Another year over, a new one just begun.

And so this is Christmas, I hope you have fun,
The near and the dear ones, the old and the young.

A very merry Christmas and a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one without any fears.

And so this is Christmas for weak and for strong,
The rich and the poor ones, the road is so long.

And so happy Christmas for black and for white
For the yellow and red ones let's stop all the fights.

Benjamin Woolman,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere

Benjamin Zephaniah,"It seems like years since you held the baby
While I wrecked the bedroom
You said it was dangerous after Sunday
And I knew you loved me
He thinks I just became famous
And that's what messed me up
But he's wrong
How could I possibly know what I want
When I was only twenty-one?
And there's millions of people
To offer advice and say how I should be
But they're twisted
And they will never be any influence on me
But you will always be
You will always be
 
If I treated you mean
I really didn't mean to
But you know how it is
And how a pregnancy can change you
 
I see plenty of clothes that I like
But I won't go anywhere nice for a while
All I want to do is just sit here
And write it all down and rest for a while
I can't bear to be in another city
One where you are not
I would return to nothing without you
If I'm your girlfriend or not
 
Maybe I was mean
But I really don't think so
You asked if I'm scared
And I said so
 
Everyone can see what's going on
They laugh `cause they know they're untouchable
Not because what I said was wrong
Whatever it may bring
I will live by my own policies
I will sleep with a clear conscience
I will sleep in peace
 
Maybe it sounds mean

And will lie there forever
If your hands were in mine
I'd be sure we'd not sever

My apple tree my brightness
It's time we were together
For I smell of the earth
And am worn by the weather

When my family thinks
That I'm safe in my bed
From night until morning
I am stretched at your head

Calling out to the air
With tears hot and wild
My grief for the girl
That I loved as a child

Do you remember
The night we were lost
In the shade of the blackthorn
And the chill of the frost

Thanks be to Jesus
We did what was right
And your maiden head still
Is your pillar of light

The priest and the friars
Approach me in dread
Because I still love you
My love and you're dead

I still would be your shelter
Through rain and through storm
And with you in your cold grave
I cannot sleep warm

And Dublin in a rainstorm
And sitting in the long grass in summer
Keeping warm
I'll remember it
Every restless night
We were so young then
We thought that everything
We could possibly do were the right
Then we moved
Stolen from our very eyes
And I wondered where you went to
Tell me when did the light die
You will rise
You'll return
The phoenix from the flame
You will learn
You will rise
You'll return
Being what you are
There is no other Troy
For you to burn

I swear I didn't mean
Those things I said
I never meant to do that to you

What do you want to do?
Does she need you like I do?
Do you love her?
Is she good for you?
Does she hold you like I do?

Do you want me?
Should I leave?
I know you're always telling me
That you love me
Just sometimes I wonder
If I should believe
Oh, I love you
God, I love you
I'd kill a dragon for you
I'll die
But I will rise
And I will return
The Phoenix from the flame
I have learned
I will rise
And you'll see me return
Being what I am
There is no other Troy
For me to burn

And you should've left the light on
You should've left the light on
Then I wouldn't have tried
And you'd never have known
And I wouldn't have pulled you tighter
No I wouldn't have pulled you close
I wouldn't have screamed
No I can't let you go
And the door wasn't closed
No I wouldn't have pulled you to me
No I wouldn't have kissed your face
You wouldn't have begged me to hold you
If we hadn't been there in the first place
Ah but I know you wanted me to be there oh oh
Every look that you threw told me so
But you should've left the light on
You should've left the light on

I lay in their mold!

Do you got any love in your heart? Unfeeling! Unfeeling! Unfeeling!

Threw myself down at the feet of its mercy
the stone of my heart met its defeat love emptied me filling me with serenity.

I was not of love still it accepted me whole

Va bene qualunque via
Va bene qualunque cosa

Forse l’ho solo rotta
Forse tu sei diversa
Forse stanotte ho perso la rotta

Ultimamente me ne frega un terzo
Sai quanto me ne importa di una casa in centro
Dei mille discorsi in giro su di me
A pensare male a volte si fa centro

Cicatrici di una vita passata
Di chi ha dato troppo amore alla persona sbagliata

Fisso le pareti e penso a tutto ciò che manca

Le foto di quella vacanza fatta insieme in un paese troppo grande da vedere in una settimana
Odio tutto in questa stanza

Che sembra il Sahara
E basta poco
Per accorciare la distanza

Certe volte basta una telefonata
Ma questa volta ha detto basta
Ha detto solo basta

Ora sei niente di speciale
Butto tutto ciò che ci rimane
Tra la TV, i film di Hollywood
E le notizie dei giornali
Eri tutto
E ora sei niente, niente di speciale

Facciamo reazione e tutto esplode, boom
Hanno dato un nome a questo legame
Si chiama amore

Il mio cuore è indipendente
È scisso dalla mente
Anche se non vorrebbe
Sento le proteste di uno stomaco ribelle

Che si contorce su se stesso lentamente
Perché alla fine chi ci tiene di più è chi ci perde
Sono un perdente

Well, it's literally not that

Of the few main things I hate about her, one's her petty, vogue ideas
Someone's been told too many times they're beyond their years
By every half-wit of distinction she keeps around
And now every insufferable convo
Features her patiently explaining the cosmos
Of which she's in the middle

Lately, I can't stop the wheels from spinning
I feel so unconvincing
And I fumble with her buttons

Til she said that she sounds just like Sarah Vaughan

I don't know about the rest of you, but seeing what I'm doing is a plus

Put my mouth to her ear, and in all my grace
Whispered a borderline, could be an embarrassing situational phrase

Mama said, How's life in the city?
My your sister's grown
And you just missed those awful dixie storms
Thank God they've passed
Those awful dixie storms

I left so long ago
I'd forgotten just what for
But they say
When a big city beckons
You have no choice but to go
And here, there are no dixie storms
Thank God, there are no dixie storms

And the smoke on the street
Makes me wonder why I stay away
From those gentle dixie storms

When I was younger
How I would wonder
What made the sweet Georgia rain
Make me feel so warm
And how God made a dixie storm
And how I loved those dixie storms

And the rumble in the sky
Brings a shudder to my soul
Oh how I loved those dixie storms",Dixie Storms,2000

But you'll have my love with you so don't ever doubt it
And, baby, don't leave home without it

Wrap it all around you like these arms of mine
I'll be there for you anytime
My love has no boundaries and that's the good thing about it

Where the years went I can't say

Of dusty books and faded papers

Softly as the night was fallin'
With a question and I replied

And he needs someone who will listen

    Come and sit by the river with me for a while
    And I'll tell you a story that's true
    Of when I was a boy playing here on the shore
    And the grass was so green and the water so blue



Well our house stood right over there
Of course they took it down for the highway

And you know we would still if I had my way

Many years I have watched this river flow
Rolling down from the hills to the ocean
I have seen the waters high, almost fierce and rushing by
I have seen in nearly dry and without motion

Oh we prospered but poisoned the waters
Now the tunes have all been played and the piper must be paid
Not by us but our sons and daughters

Like the seasons, he'll come and he'll go
Just as free as a bird and as good as his word

Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away
Looks like we warm the steak

Take time, we've spoken sixty-five 
So about, so about you 
I know it, I know it 
This time, I've suspect stolen dollar 
I talk with you this high

Come and talk no tears 
Come and talk no tears 
Come and talk no tears 
Come and talk no tears, tears 

Tears I come as well 
Were you thinking right? 
Was there are? 
Ask for me, ask for you 
Unbelievable, what´re you do? 

Tears I come as well 
Were you thinking right?

Bennett Carl,"Hey yo nephew check this out man 
Now I know you got that bad chick right there 
You ain't even tripping off of her 
But she doing all of that for you 
She got this, she got that 
She's off the hizzle 
I mean when you find one like that 
You got to make that change man 
'Cause they don't come too often 
And when they do come 
You gotta be smart enough to know when to change 
Like Sam Cooke say change gon' come nephew 
And you better believe that 

As I look back on all that I've done to you 
My biggest regrets 
The things that I never could do 
I see the light now baby it's shining through 
Gotta give up the game 
Yeah I got some changin' to do 

I won't get high if you want it 
Get that straight 
Nine to five if you want it 
Keep my ass home at night if you want it 
Whatever you need me to do 

When you talk I'ma listen 
Give you all that attention you missing 
Girl I swear I'ma handle my business 
Just like a real man should do 

I can change 
I can change (you know I can change baby) 
I can change 
For you (you know I can stop baby) 
I can change (you know I change baby) 
I can change 
I can change 
For you (you know I can stop baby) 

I'll give up all the places I used to go 
Stay out the club 
Stay home because I'm with you 
I'll give up all those girls that I used to know 
They don't compare 
Baby I swear it's the truth (you know it's the truth baby) 

So I'm through with the women 
Yeah that's right 
I give up on the pimpin' 
Girl I'm gonna repent from my sinnin' 
If that's what you want me to do 

I'll get right if you want it 
Go to church 
Get baptized if you want it 
Girl you opened my eyes and I'm gonna 
Be much better for you 

Baby believe me 
Baby believe me 

I can change (you know I can change baby) 
I can change (know I can change baby) 
I can change 
For you 
I can change 
I can change 
I can change 
For you 

Take me to the river 
And baptize my soul 
I'm so outta control 
Needing someone to hold 
Man it's cold 
I ain't been clubbin', drinkin', or smokin' 
I'm focused 
Bowin' down every night prayin' and hopin' 

I'm trying to figure out a way 
But I just don't know how to say 
But I'm rearrangin' 
Hopefully I'm changin' 
And you can see that 
Baby 'cause it's hard for me 
Kinda sorta odd for me 
But ain't nothing to it 
If you need me to do it 
I guess' 

I can change 
I can change 
I can change 
For you (I'll give up on the pimpin' for you) 
I can change 
I can change

Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry

My baby's drama mama, don't like me
She be doing things like having them boys come from her neighborhood 
To the studio trying to fight me
She need to get a, piece of the american pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby, and not a paycheck
Private school, daycare, shit medical bills I pay that
I love your mom and everything, but see I ain't the one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war, my lawyers stay down
Shit you never got a chance to hear my side of the story we was divided
She had fish fries and cookouts for my child's birthday I ain't invited
Despite it, I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

[Chorus]

Me and yo' daughter, got's this thing going on
(We got a special kind of thing going on)
You say it's puppy love 
We say it's full grown 
Hope that we feel this, feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic
But you can't predict the weather, Ms. Jackson

Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin; fine
The quickest muzzle throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing, together dream
Bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever, ever, forever, ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day by day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson my intentions were good I wish I could
Become a magician to abacadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me
Had, I pray so much about it need some knee, pads
It happened for a reason one can't be, mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes I will be present on the first day of school, and graduation

[Chorus]

Uh, uh, yeah
""Look at the way he treats me"" 
Shit, look at the way you treat me
You see your little nosy-ass home girls 
Done got your ass sent up the creek G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle 
And ride this thing on out
Now you and your girl ain't speaking no more 
Cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what I'm talking about?  Jealousy, infidelity, envy
Cheating to beating, envy and to the G they be the same thing
So who you placing the blame on, you keep on singing the same song
Let bygones be bygones, you can go on and get the hell on
You and your mama

Representin Legit Ballers and niggas biten the flow
On the streets or the stage 
A 45 or a gauge 
that's why me and the Twista always hittin the front page
For what? cause we so damn cold
And when we enter the car niggas cluthcin they hoes
So fuck it, fall wit dust and get snatched 
While Nitty bustes the facts in the Grand Finale

[Toxic]
Yeah 'lil nigga its been once for you bitches

And just when you thought it was over
T-Nitty in here doin danger 

[T-Nitty]
The names Nitty, you know I'm comin off like a gangsta
Disrespectin the mob I gotta bang ya
An everyday, cituation when I was caught by
Fuck a car, I do a muthafuckin walk by
When the G to the A-M-E
Leavin whole fuckin familys greivin
Cause if I miss some I gotta burn ya
Then I'm aressted (For what?) attempt murda
Never out done only out doin
Fuckin them bitches and then I leave 'em boo-hooin
Why?, cause they addicted, to what the dick did
The pleasure and pain the wing ding inflicted
Given niggas two to the head
Boy you can't mess wit a mad and hard head
Fool, I'm a straight low neva broke
Cause today I be a balla, shot shot caller 
I don't give a fuck about one
Them hoes ain't even got love and they boo-hooin
Now when I take it pass rap
While I'm still gang bangin bitch nigga catch a cap
Not easy but my nine easy to kill wit
Especially if you poppin bullshit
The N only I to the T
Especially my dogs on the muthafuckin Grand Finale

The orignator of the style all why'all niggas been biten
And to show you how its done
GUNNIN!

Swingin, singin my raw was through rap 
To the rhythm see-cock back T-O is in the back 
So if it makes you giggle I figure you thinks its petty
But to me its kinda Tilly 
(Tell 'em what) I'm makin fetty
Trippin off the man tho we buzzin while I'm thuggin
Get drunk and discustin the way I be bustin pistols and hustlin
don't take second for me to pop off my nine 
Cause I'm the tiggy-tiggy Twista nigga what have been on out of the pick
But I was harder T-W-I-S-T-A to the formula
Its cold cause we been smokin on dro
So nigga when you take a listen
You wonder who I'm dissin
D-O-N-T L-E-A-V-E without permission
The ""Baller-T"" aka ""The Swisher Roller"" 
""The Bigger Gun Holder"" so I be damned when a nigga role up 
Ever compete wit Mobster Elites
Much Less beef
Its like you comin on my tip wit no heat
Never smile when the Twistas in the club
Cause I got a mask and gloves 
And I might be bustin out slugs
I'm comin raw cause I'm smokin on kali
Gang bangin wit Mobsta Elites on the muthafuckin Grand Finale

I like that, ooh shit, sexy than a motherfucker
Can I kiss that

Is it on your back (uh huh)
Is it on your leg (uh huh)
Is it buy your cat (uh huh)

Let me see your tattoo girl
Where your tat, tat, tatty
Let me see your tattoo girl

[Liffy Stokes]
Hey there shorty, what you working with
Let me see you pop that shit for daddy
That's shining blowing big pound out a pro caddy pick up
Diamonds flick up protect your tip tattoo bezel that lift up
Blinding them ?booshy? hoes
I bends through the Gucci store
Grinning, Sprewells spinning, but I'm standing still
Man trying to call up this zig-zotic hot mama out by the Ville then
I'm talking top flight, high priced brown sugar
With the curly butter, thick hips and all 
With the easy-e kitty cat paws, tatted above her bra
When the Twist sat down by her draws
But I guess that leaves dust and all
Cause a man keeps on running off
Just dropping her cheese, but shorty got me's
Taking trips to the tat shop, come on the black top
Let her feel Anita while we sold be	's
Cause you really gotta get greedy
Fish that pearl, and then show it off to the world
Thickness shorty got niggas out here screaming
Let me see your tattoo girl

(Chorus)

[Bennie Franks]
It's Mr. Fat, freaky, black, nasty and here for money grams
It's something bout a red bone tattoo, god damn
You need a cover up, X out your baby daddy name
Girl I know you love to fuck, just the way you took the pain
Check my name and Eddy came, oops I don't mean to be rude
I got a fetish for oops I mean I love some tattoos
Let's get up on a room, everything is on me
Ain't got an A and the ointment but I got some Vaseline
The Brandi, I can't stand it the way my mess 
And let's get stranded, I kizzel my nizzel fa shizzel 
My cameras handy, bumping to this shit type to break the walls down
In Miami, top notch swallow and keep the ostrich and get up

(Chorus - 2x)

[High Beam]
I guess you with me like a reeeeal
And then she suck me like a neckbone
I've been gone slap then I took the Milly that home
Since nobody needed to drive I'ma be the one they gone put it on
(did you know me daddy) Man I ain't even have to ask shorty
It was right before my eyes, tattoos on her chest
Snake wrapped around her legs all the way up to her thighs
Her size, scrumptious fulfilling the fantasy of me and my guys
When she pulled her pants down 
Made me want to buck she oh my, what a surprise
Man I'm hoping, she'll let a nigga get it wet I gets wild and open
Way too provoking, on the beach rubbing her body down with suntan lotion
What's that, another tat with the Playboy bunny by her cootie cat
Got one going in the crack of her ass 
But she can't really see cause her booty fat
Girl you don't know what I'd do to that
got limo scrapes ride the butter crack
Put Legit Ballin all across your back, take that off and let me see that

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Bennie Green,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1954

Somewhere alone with you

Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?
When the steeple bell says,

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",There's a Small Hotel,1954

'Cause the night has a thousand eyes 
And a thousand eyes can't help but see if you are true to me 
So remember when you tell those little white lies 
That the night has a thousand eyes 

You say that you're at home when you phone me 
And how much you really care 
Though you keep telling me that you're lonely 
I'll know if someone is there 

[Chorus]

One of these days you're gonna be sorry 
'Cause your game I'm gonna play 
And you'll find out without really trying 
Each time that my kisses stray 

'Cause the night has a thousand eyes 
And a thousand eyes will see me too 
And no matter what I do 
I could never disguise all my little white lies 
'Cause the night has a thousand eyes 

So remember when you tell those little white lies 
That the night has a thousand eyes",The Night Has a Thousand Eyes,2005
Bennie Green With Strings,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1954
Bennie Green With Strings,"I'd like to get away, Junior
Somewhere alone with you
It could be oh, so gay, Junior
You need a laugh
Or two

A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
""Good night, sleep well,""
We'll thank the small hotel
Together

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",There's a Small Hotel,1954
Bennie Hank Crawford,"Hide nor hair
Oh, I was lying in the bed with fever
And I was burning up inside
My baby walked in my bedroom
And I could hardly open my eyes
She said she was going to the pawn shop
Just across the track
She started packing some clothes in a hurry
And then she said she would be right back
But I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since that day
Well I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since she went away
I remember so well when she slammed the door
But the girl didn't make it back no more
I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since that day
Well I waited for her twenty four hours
And I was just about to starve to death
It didn't look like she was coming back
So I had to look out for myself
Well I called the police department
To find out what they knew
They said, no by heck but we will get her yet
Because they were looking for her too.
But I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since that day
Well I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since she went away
Well I don't know what happened across the track
But I know my baby didn't make it back
I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since that day.
Well I called my Dr. Foster
And when the girl answered the phone
I got a funny feeling
The way she said Dr. Foster had gone
She said he left with a lady patient
About twenty four hours ago
I added two and two and here's what I got
I got I'll never see that girl no mo'
But I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since that day
Well I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since she went away
If Dr. foster has got her then I know I'm through
Cause he's got medicine and money too.
I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since that day.
Whoa no",Hide nor Hair,2000

Like a flower crying

From my tender sentimental woes

A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Creo que es hoy
Es la ultima oportunidad
De tenerte como ayer
Y sentirme vivo al romperme el alma

Hiereme

Esta noche verte triste
Frena mi respiracion
Intentar besar tu boca 
Solo aumenta la distancia
Antes de que me desprenda
Voy a acercarme a la verdad
Sin temores
Pero hoy quiero que me hagas sentir
Una vez mas
Que el dolor se convierta 
En lo unico que sienta

Abrazando tu ausencia
Quiero besar tu voz
Oir la risa de la distancia

är det nöjen i en stor stad
eller tystnad på en ö
Att finnas till det är för mig
att se sommarängar blomma,
lyss till vågor från en sjö
Att se ett hav i solnedgången
Att se ett segel ligga still
Sommarkväll - att förnimma alla dofter
Det är då jag känner jag finns till
Att finnas till - det är att njuta stunder
Att finnas till - det är så stort för mig
Finnas till - det är ett herrens under
Att finnas till - det är att va' med dig!
Finnas till det är att sitta
med den vän man håller kärast,
kanske läppja ett glas vin
Att finnas till då för varann
medan staden redan sover,
kanske tända stearin
Att ligga där och känna värmen
från den man älskar - sådant vill
jag nog tro många tycker är att leva
Det är då man känner man finns till
Att finnas till - det är att njuta stunder

Benny Aronov,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams [Live],1998

We laughed and cried
We never said goodbye

She was gone

Che tutto sembra possibile
Mentre nel cielo si arrampica
Un desiderio invincibile
Che lascia una scia
Come astronave lanciata
A cercare una via
Verso una nuova dimensione
Un'illuminazione

In questa notte fantastica
In questo inizio del mondo
I nostri sguardi si cercano
Con ali fatte di musica

Posso toccare il cielo
Lo posso fare per davvero
Lascia che questa atmosfera
Ti porti con sé
Non c'è più niente da perdere

Ti porto via con me
In questa notte fantastica
Ti porto via con me
Ribalteremo il mondo

Una cascata di bassi
Che fanno vibrare la spina dorsale
Una manciata di ore da metterci dentro il delirio totale

Due come noi che si fondono
Per diventare una nota sola
Due come noi che si cercano
Dentro una musica nuova

Dentro una macchina suona una ritmica forte
Si sente da fuori
Un temporale elettronico lava la polvere dai cuori
Dj suona musica buona, BPM 130
Respira, respiro

Ti porto via con me
In questa notte fantastica
Di questo inizio del mondo
Con mille storie che nascono

E mille amori che esplodono in mezzo alla via
Fanno una luce più forte del sole
In questo spazio elettronico
Posso toccare il cielo

Ti porto via con me
In questa notte fantastica
Ti porto via con me
Ribalteremo il mondo

Donna che danza la notte, fa nascere il sole, ti sento vicino
Come filmare una scena per dire chi siamo su un altro pianeta
In questa parte di mondo la strada finisce, comincia la vita

Senti il dolore
Si scioglie nel tempo
Che scorre e che scivola via
Non resterò qui a guardare
Ho già iniziato a viaggiare

Ti porto via con me
Ti porto via con me, oh
Ti porto via con me

Let the tears fall down

Lost in this race
And my heart’s in a hearse
Can we put it in reverse, babe

Cause I can’t even feel the drum and bass
It’s drowned out by the beat my heart makes
I hear that song but something is wrong
My mind’s a million miles away

Ohh, Everybody’s going to the floor
Maybe I don’t want to dance anymore

I’m changing the station
Cause I can’t smile
Like everyone else
Play my sad song
In heavy rotation
I won’t go out
I’m trying to save myself

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

Like a daisy, I'm awake
With no bromo-seltzer handy
I don't even shake

Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I've sinned a lot; I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

When he talks, he is seeking
Words to get off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best

Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank God, I can be oversexed again
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

Wise at last, my eyes at last
Are cutting you down to your size at last
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered no more

Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered no more

Couldn't eat, was dyspeptic

Another to me?

I could climb the snow capped mountains
Sail the mighty ocean wide
I could cross the burning desert
If I had you by my side
I could be a king, dear, uncrowned
Humble or poor, rich or renowned
There is nothing I couldn't do 
If I had you
 
I could show the world how to smile
I could be glad all of the while
I could change the grey skies to blues 
If I had you
I could leave the old days behind
Leave all my pals, I'd never mind
I could start my life all a new 
If I had you
I could climb the snow capped mountains
Sail the mighty ocean wide
I could cross the burning desert
If I had you by my side
I could be a king, dear, uncrowned
Humble or poor, rich or renowned
There is nothing I couldn't do",If I Had You,1975

Benny Carter,"Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May
Sweet and lovely heaven must have sent her my way
Skies above me never were as blue as her eyes
And she loves me, who would want a sweeter surprise
 
When she nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me, melody, haunting me
Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May
And she loves me, there is nothing more I can say
 
Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May
Sweet and lovely heaven must have sent her my way
Skies above me never were as blue as her eyes
And she loves me, who would want a sweeter surprise

",Sweet and Lovely,1976
Benny Carter,"I was just minding my business
Life was a beautiful song
Didn't have a care nor worry
Then you had to come along
I fell in love with you first time
I looked into them there eyes
You've got a certain lil' cute way of flirtin'
With them there eyes
They make me feel happy, they make me blue
No stallin'
I'm fallin'
Going in a big way for sweet little you
My heart is jumpin'
You sure started somethin'
With them there eyes
You'd better watch them if you're wise
They sparkle, they bubble
They're gonna get you in a whole lot of trouble
You're overworkin' 'em
There's danger lurkin' in
Them there eyes
Maybe you think I'm just flirtin'
Maybe you think I'm all lies
Just because I get romantic when I gaze in
Them there eyes
I fell in love with you first time
I looked into them there eyes
You've got a certain lil' cute way of flirtin'
With them there eyes
They make me feel happy, they make me blue
No stallin'

Going in a big way for sweet little you

Benny Carter,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for the very taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul",Body and Soul,1977
Benny Carter,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here",Here's That Rainy Day,1977
Benny Carter,"In a mellow tone
Feeling fancy free
And I'm not alone
I've got company

Everything's OK
The live long day
With this mellow song
I can't go wrong

In a mellow tone
That's the way to live
If you mope and groan
Something's gotta give

Just go your way
And laugh and play
There's joy unknown
In a mellow tone

Benny Carter,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

",On Green Dolphin Street,1977
Benny Carter,"Here I go again, I hear those trumpets blow again.
All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again.
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.",Taking a Chance on Love,1980
Benny Carter,"This time we almost made the pieces fit
Didn't we?
This time we almost made some sense of it
Didn't we?
This time I had the answer, right here in my hand
Then I touched it and it had turned to sand

This time we almost sang our song in tune
Didn't we, love?
This time we almost made it, made it to the moon 
Didn't we, love?
This time we almost made our poem rhyme
This time we almost made that long hard climb
Didn't we almost make it?
Didn't we almost make it?
Didn't we almost make it this time?",Didn't We,1986
Benny Carter,"Behold the way our fine feathered friend
His virtue doth parade
Thou knowest not, my dim-witted friend
The picture thou hast made
Thy vacant brow, and thy tousled hair
Conceal thy good intent
Thou noble upright truthful sincere
And slightly dopey gent, you are...

My funny valentine, sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable, un-photographable
Yet, you're my favorite work of art

Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?

But, don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little valentine, stay
Each day is Valentine's Day

Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?

Benny Carter,"Don't worry I'm not looking at you
Gorgeous and dressed in blue
Don't worry I'm not looking at you
Gorgeous and dressed in blue
I know it drives you crazy
When I pretend you don't exist
When I'd like to lean in close
And run my hands against your lips
Though we haven't even spoken
Still I sense there's a rapport
So whisper me your number
I'll call you up at home
Whisper me your number
I'll call you up at home
Don't worry I'm not looking at you 
Don't worry I'm not looking at you
Gorgeous and dressed in blue
Don't worry I'm not looking at you
I know you see me see you
As you see me walk on past
When there's nothing more I'd like to do
Then come in close and hear you laugh
Though we haven't even spoken
Still I sense there's a rapport
So whisper me your number
I'll call you up at home
Yea whisper me your number

Benny Carter,"Yesterday you came my way,
And when you smiled at me,
In my heart I felt a thrill you see,
That it was love at sight and
I was right to love you as I do.
Still I never dreamed that you could love me too.

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

You're telling ev'ry one I know
I'm on your mind each place we go
They can't believe that you're in love with me.

I have always placed you far above me.
I just can't imagine that you love me.
And after all is said and done,
To think that I'm the lucky one.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

Skies are gray. I'm blue each day
When you are not around.
Ev'ry thing goes wrong, my dear I've found
But when you're by my side I fill with pride
For I'm so proud of you
It all seems too good to me to all be true

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

You're telling ev'ry one I know
I'm on your mind each place we go
They can't believe that you're in love with me.
