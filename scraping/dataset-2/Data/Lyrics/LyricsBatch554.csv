Hello [Repeat: x9]

[T.I.]
Hey, what's happenin'?
It's been a minute, huh? I'm just hollerin'
How you doing? 

It's been a minute since I seen ya,
I fell off for the scene, 
Cause it seem like you wanted other things than da king,
Why you fightin', fussin', cussin', and disagreein' wit da king?
When you got cribs, cars, bling, and a king wit da king?
Is the grass as green as it seemed in ya dreams,
Are you getting all the things that you needed and I ain't bring,
Does it satisfy your self-esteem being seen on the screen,
Is this new nigga the real thing or is just a lil' fling?
Did he buy a nice bracelet and get ya a lil' ring?
Or give you all the attention and the lil' things?
He know what to do with the stuff you stuff in them lil' jeans?
Do he stand up and lean in it 'til you start screamin'? 
Or smack your ass and kiss your G-String to start eatin? (muah),
You get how you need it, not only when it's convenient,
I just pick up the phone and call you every week or two to let you know I miss you,
To see how that other nigga treatin' you.

[Chorus: Governor]
I remember morning, noon, and night, 
I used to hold you tight,
I know we used to fuss and fight ,
But I'm just calling to say (hello) Hello, (hello, oh baby)
See time has a funny way of keeping us close, 
Even though we never stayed, toghether,
I just wanted to say (hello) hello (hello)

[T.I.]
Hello?
Hey, it's me,
Hey, what's happening? How ya doin?
I know plenty of niggas pursuin' them panties, all for the screwin',
Fly you down to Miami,
Let you walk the red carpet wit a ? at the Grammys,
But I'm what he can never be, a boss, understand me?
He pose and take ? things he buy for ya,
He got you a rose, but that don't mean he'd die for ya, 
Hey, maybe I got too much pride to cry for ya,
But not too much to call you and tell you that I adore ya,
And tell you how I'm missing you, loving you, and kissing you,
And think about the good old days and wanna visit you,
This song I'd like to listen to whenever reminisicin' you,
You, stay on my mind nevermind how I picture you,
Think about the past and all the time that I spent with ya,
Rubbing on that ass from behind as I dig in you, 
Never been a doubt in my mind that I was diggin' you,
How I love you shorty, you'll never find another nigga to

[Chorus]

[Governor]
Every now and then I think of you, 
And I can't lie I be wantin' you,
But I understand that I'm not your man,
And I also know that the future's not in your hands 
Every now and then I'd call you to say how you doing,
And baby I miss you,
Girl, this is just to say hello,
Hello Baby.

[Chorus]

(Hello, hello)",Hello,2013
King & Monster,"My cup runneth over with pinot grigio, hold up
You bogus in the lambo if you ain't lifting the door up
You bogus poppin' pills if you ain't pickin the ho up
You bogus running out on your kids my nigga grow up
For God's sake, like a wedding, cutting large cake
For large stakes let the hammer bang broad day
Ay, nevermind what the blogs say
This what my mind and my heart say

My philosophy profit off of my properties
Get it, flip it, we got to be rich, that broke shit is obsolete
Possibly off of my rocker, watch how you watching me
Sophisticated, psychotic, fly as a pilot
Officially silent, all you wish you could get I got it
Unlimited titanium nigga, what's in yo wallet?
Out of gladiator college, I made it summa cum laude
While you clowns couldn't have got a cap and gown if you bought it
I parlay with Saudis, buying crude oil and diamonds
Hustle January, July, fly to Dubai
A broke nigga telling me 'bout how I'm dividing the pies
Like a blind nigga telling me it's an eye for an eye
Bullheaded and stubborn I be that way until I die
But find a nigga with more hustle then me I dare you to try
And according to the hand on my Audemar
It's my time to shine so fuck ya'll

What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to
What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to
The fact is you can't please everybody
You can't please everybody
What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to

I grew up in the gutter, life a motherfucker
I guess that why I don't trust a motherfucker
Seen a nigga snitch on they mom, shoot at they brother
Go to prison in love with a bitch and a nigga fuck her
I seen real G's destroyed by real suckers
Innocent ladies raped and defenceless babies abducted
Such a horrible truth, but you see it over and over
It's nothing, get numb to it and your heart grow colder
Pacify your pain with a chain and a Rover
Fuck it, justify your action with stacking your dough up
You show up with a brick of cocaine and baking soda
Just enough for me to blow up, nigga hold up
Switch the flow up, 'cause these niggas be snitchin' so much
I promise all they missing's the badge, coffee, and donuts
Go to jail so what, never see my integrity perish
That ain't the Harris' way, study my pedigree
Promise I'm one of the only ones who keep it 100
Probably why I think they all out to get me, you can't convince me
Large money and fame will plant seeds of envy
To make my partners resent me enough to come and get me
Catch me slippin' and hit me, just like they did 50
'Cause I'm in the position that he think he should be given
Listen, dawg, the fact of the matter is
I'm on a narrow path and we all can't travel

What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to
What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to
The fact is you can't please everybody
You can't please everybody
What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry toy

What it ain't, What it is?
Even if you gotta live
I learned that apartment is way more exciting than a big ass house on a hill
I used to be a way better writer and a rapper
When I used to want a black Karmann Ghia
Now a nigga speeding in a Porsche
Feeling like I'm going off a course
Cut these fuck niggas off
Negative in my life, scream that till I'm hoarse
Duck these get the fuck off me projectiles, bitch you ain't really got a choice
I'm living my life live yours
I don't even like rapping fast, but that's how the word come to me
Talk to me sideways nigga that's your ass
Slow it down, this that shit that'll make you call your momma
Say hey I'm sorry for begging for all them clothes you couldn't afford
And this the type of shit that'll make you call your rap partner
And say I'm sorry I'm awkward, my fault for fuckin' up the tours
I hated all the attention so I ran from it
Fuck it if we did, but I hope we ain't lose no fans from it
I'm a grown-ass kid, you know ain't never cared about no damn money
Why do we try so hard to be stars, just to dodge comments
And this that shit that'll make you call your baby mama
When you gone on half a pill, don't know why but that's how it is
Then you take a flight back to the crib, y'all make love like college kids
And you say all the shit you gon' do better, we can try this shit again
'Round the time the dope wear off, you feel stupid, she feel lost
That's that dope, I mean, I mean dopamine you think Cupid done worn off
Waiting in the hallway with her arms crossed
Baby boy face full of applesauce
Maybe should have stayed but it ain't yo fault
Too much pressure, I peel off, I'm sorry
Was young and had to choose between you
And what the rest of the world might offer me, shit what would you do
Well I'd probably do it differently if second the chance
Only if some cool ass older man would've let me know in advance
This, this quarry, that is dug so deep in a father's chest
When he feel that he's broken up his nest
And he figured shit he was just doing the best that he could
Which end up being the worst that he could
And all some pussy nigga on the internet can say is that verse ain't good
It's boring, boring?
Really?

When I'm disgusted with this world and I can hardly breathe and
Told so many lies, don't know what to believe
I discussed it with this girl, and this is what she said
She said lay down baby, baby, rest your weary head up
I love these distractions but my mind don't wanna rest
But my body disagree so I laid up on her breasts, yes
Ooooh, you are so fucking fine
I woke up the next morning with new purpose on my mind

Ooooh, who knows your ponytail
Who knows your body well",Sorry,2013
King & Monster,"[Chorus]
Stand up
If you don't like what I'm saying then buck
Swing when you see me we can throw them hands sucker
Stand up
If you didn't notice nigga, I don't give a fuck
If I said it then I meant it and what fuck nigga
Stand up
You don't want to see the triggerman bust
Hit you and your mans up, make it hard for niggas to
Stand up
Tell your crew they don't want it with us dude
And if them motherfuckers do, bust a motherfucking move
Stand up

[Verse 1: T.I.]
You got a gator mouth and a hummingbird ass
Your mouth writing checks that your ass can't cash
145 and I'm out of your weight class
Want to survive, you better scramble like eggs and break fast
Cause I know how to handle your fake ass
I'm a ride on you and hide you in yesterday's trash
Pull up in the Chevy's spraying rounds through the glass
See you laying face down in the grass and I'll laugh
Ha, cause that's the end of the saga
The end of my problems, nigga mash the Impala
Go lay up with a model and watch the news tomorrow
And that's the end checkmate, game over, I'll holler
Pimp, telling you partner, you don't know what you're doing
Or recognize the trouble you getting in to and you're ruin
And dig this man
I spent my childhood in a wild hood
And all that gangster shit you talking, yeah, it sound good
But make it understood
You gone have to show me, I'm a O.G.
You want to overthrow me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Trick Daddy]
Dearly beloved, we're gathered here today
To marry this young nigga in his own special thug way
Do you promise to love and respect all of the real niggas
And when a problem come, learn to deal with 'em
Do you swear to turn this chopper
On any motherfucker in your path, or the bitch that's trying to stop ya
Or do you promise to keep him handy
And don't hand him to nobody, nobody except family
And keep him cocked and loaded and don't expose him to no body
Unless somebody, who want him in his body
To love and cherish and from this trigger to a barrel
From the bottom of your heart
'til death do you fuckin' part
Do you understand to live, to lie by him
Is to share your soul, Lord knows, you gone die by him
I know you heard gun stories about John Wayne and Billy the Kid
Shit, all them motherfuckers dead
And did you know that every other bitch from the Wild, Wild West
End up dying from hollow points to they fuckin' chest
Cause I ain't never seen a cock beamer meant for a team of tummy guns
With a hundred round fuckin' drum

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Lil' Wayne]
Shit, I'm talking about riding out tonight
Only way I die first, got to kill me in this verse
Weezy F middle finger to life
So nothing seem critical in the hood I'm typical
Yet I'm feeling good and spiritual
Healing hoods with this shit up out my kitchen
I'm pitching that it's really good
Smoking, drinking, I'm like a fish
And I'll probably shit on ya bitch
Probably piss on her lips and she probably give you a kiss
Nasty, Holly Grove classic
Polly wood a nigga probably robbed the same bastard
Ask him
We don't give a fuck about a casket
Nigga this the murder campy
Niggas is murder happy
12 years old, I jumped off the pot
I started selling rock right after I got shot
I had to hold my weight down
Pussy nigga stand up or lay down

[Chorus]",Stand Up,2013
King & Moore,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,1993
King & Moore,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
On Green Dolphin Street
",On Green Dolphin Street,1993
King 'Tet,"The looks are - The smile is a lie 
The clock drags on - The smoke is in your eyes 
You know the blame is someone's 
But you don't quite know who 
In your mind - if it could only be different in your heart 
If only you could run away from it

Prisoner, prisoner (if you could only say) 
Choosing death for life
Prisoner, prisoner (you are a prisoner)
Smiling executioner 
If money - if love was in your life 
Ifs run out - got to realize it's time
Confusion delusion alive in destitution 
In your mind - if it could only be different
In your heart - if only you could run away from it

Prisoner, prisoner (if you could only say)
Choosing death for life 
Prisoner, prisoner (you are a prisoner)
Smiling executioner",The Prisoner,2005
King 810,"Put your back against the wall
Ready your weapon
Tonight they try to kill us all
But we won't let them
If I should fall tell my mother that I tried
And I'll do the same for you if you die

(Let's ride)

'Cause when the chips are down
There is no backing down

Bang
Bang
Bang
Bang

Who's gon' stop us now?

Kill 'em all
Kill 'em all
Kill 'em all

Gun 'em down hang their fuckin' bodies in the halls
Kill 'em all
Kill 'em all
Kill 'em all 

Cut 'em down let 'em fall fuck 'em all
Kill 'em all
Kill 'em all
Kill 'em all
 
There's no law in this land we just kill 'em all
Kill 'em all
Kill 'em all
Kill 'em all
I'm about to killem all

Who's gon' stop us now?

It's me against the world but I brought some friends with me
And they don't have no problem killing any of you for me 

It's me against the world but I brought some friends with me
And they don't have no problem killing any of you for me 

That's it
I tried talking to you about peace
I quit
They only wanna hear about the beast
Well sit
Open your ears and close your eyes 
And I'll try and tell you how it feels to fry

Taking a bullet feels like being set on fire 
And the knife blade feels ice cold

And I see things when I sleep at night 
No author could describe with words

And I've went to bed hungry and I've fought for my life 
And when the chips are down there's no backing down

When I try to explain it just drives me insane 
Because I become so overwhelmed",Killem All,2014

King and I Pit Orchestra,"When I was a boy, world was better spot
What was so was so, what was not was not
Now, I am a man, world have changed a lot
Some things nearly so, others nearly not

There are times I almost think
I am not sure of what I absolutely know
Very often find confusion
In conclusion, I concluded long ago

In my head are many facts
That, as a student, I have studied to procure
In my head are many facts
Of which I wish I was more certain, I was sure
Is a puzzlement

What to tell growing son?
What for instance, shall I say to him of women?
Shall I educate him on the ancient lines?
Shall I tell the boy as far as he is able
To respect his wives and love his concubines?

Shall I tell him everyone is like the other
And the better of the two is really neither?
If I tell him this I think he won't believe it
And I nearly think that I don't believe it either

When my father was a king
He was a king who knew exactly what he knew
And his brain was not a thing
Forever swinging to and fro and fro and to

Shall I, then be like my father
And be willfully unmovable and strong?
Or is it better to be right?
Or am I right when I believe I may be wrong?

Shall I join with other nations in alliance?
If allies are weak, am I not best alone?
If allies are strong with power to protect me
Might they not protect me out of all I own?

Is a danger to be trusting one another
One will seldom want to do what other wishes
But unless someday somebody trust somebody
There'll be nothing left on earth excepting fishes

There are times I almost think
Nobody sure of what he absolutely know
Everybody find confusion
In conclusion, he concluded long ago

And it puzzle me to learn
That tho' a man may be in doubt of what he know
Very quickly he will fight
He'll fight to prove that what he does not know is so

Oh, sometimes I think that people going mad
Ah, sometimes I think that people not so bad
But not matter what I think, I must go on living life
As leader of my kingdom, I must go forth
Be father to my children and husband to each wife
Etcetera, etcetera and so forth

If my Lord in Heaven Buddha, show the way
Everyday I try to live another day
If my Lord in Heaven Buddha, show the way
Everyday I do my best for one more day

When he left them and gone back to his father
Don't forget it

Said let not your heart be troubled
Believe in God, believe in me also

In my father's house are many mansions
Everyone not so I would have told you
I'm going to prepare a place for you
And if I go
To prepare a place for you
I will come again and receive you unto myself
That's what I am, that you may be also

Now, tell me, dear one, why was Jesus?
He was standing on earth
Talking to his disciples

What is it good for? (war)

Man has a sense for the discovery of beauty
How rich is the world for one who makes you for us to show
Beauty must have power over man, war

After the end of the war I want to devote myself
To my thoughts for five to ten years and to writing them down
War has caused unrest among the younger generation
Induction then destruction, who wants to die?
Wars come and go what remains are only the values of culture

Then of course there is revolutionary love
Love of comrades fighting for the people and love of people
Not an abstract people but people one meets and works with
When Che Guevara taught of love being
At the center of revolutionary endeavor, he meant both

For people like Che or George Jackson or Malcolm X
Love was the prime mover of their struggle
That love cost them their lives, love coupled with a man's pride
Love coupled with a man's pride
Give it to you on top, now

War, I despise 'cause it means destruction of innocent lives
War, means tears to thousands of mothers how
When their sons go off to fight and lose their lives

I said, war, good god, now, what is it good for?
Absolutely, nothing
Say it again, war, what is it good for?
Absolutely, nothing, listen to me
War, it ain't nothing but a heart breaker
War, friend only to the undertaker, war

King Changó,"I was so lost in all my troubles 
I felt that everything I did was wrong 
I searched for help instead I found oppression 
They tried to break me but it didn't work 

So I don't care what people say 
Sometimes I stay sometimes I run away 
Nobody has to like the things I do 
And if you try to hurt me then fuck you too! 

I feel so low then I feel so high 
But when I play you make me feel alright 
For those who are dying of jealousy 
Don't even try to mess with me! 

I search and try to figure out this new person 
This person that I've become 
Music changed my life but now you changed my soul 

So, I don't care what people say 
I've found you and now it's all okay 
I was lost and then you showed me the way 
I could run away, but I'm going to stay 

I learned my lessons from my past 
Don't worry baby it's gonna be alright 
For those who kiss me with hipocracy 
Don't even try to mess with me! 

You make me so happy let me show you my love! 
You make me so happy let me show you my love! 

So, I don't care what people say 
I've found you and now it's all okay 
I will never let you go 
Come on baby don't you know 
You're all I need 
All I need

Cast the darkest shadows,
And that's where I'll be found,
For what's hiding by the morning
Will be chased by daylight's hounds.

Oh, the Dawn light sweeps all the shadows clean
Of what has gathered in the night,
Hang the villains and the crooks
High on butchers hooks
As they run from the sun in fright.

Oh the moonlight shadows are fleeting and scattered
Where memories and prophecies are slain,
Only the moment you're in can delight in sin,
So forget your regrets and pains.

The brightest lights
Cast the darkest shadows,
And that's where I'll be found,
For what's hiding by the morning
Will be chased by daylight's hounds.

Well the twilight shivers as darkness is risen,
Cold ash poured over the sun,
For the son to rise again he must go through hell
To see what the darkness has done.

Willingly surrendering,
There's a song to your soul while you bow to gold,
The song the angels sing.

You're a chameleon in the night
You're the sahara's sun glare

You're the wax in my moustache

Oh, you're my trainer
You'd never let me go
But if you did I would stay here
In love there is freedom
But it must be returned
There must be sacrifice
Love must be learnt

A donkey, a mule, a lifetime of work
In death he rests his head from his reins
No burden to bare but work left him lame
And the lion on the mountain chased from his pride
His lioness stolen, his rival survives
The sound of his cubs in death are dim
He knows his world well, no pain can defeat him

Wild horses in the wilderness
Will know no journey home
Well my love is locked in chains
The lion walks alone
Oh the lion walks alone
Nature is cruel
But he knows it's his home

He to his demons

In love there is freedom
But it must be returned
There must be sacrifice
Love must be learnt

A donkey, a mule, a lifetime of work
In death he rests his head from his reins
No burden to bare but work left him lame
And the lion on the mountain chased from his pride
His lioness stolen, his rival survives
The sound of his cubs in death are dim
He knows his world well, no pain can defeat him

Wild horses in the wilderness
Will know no journey home
Well my love is locked in chains
The lion walks alone
Oh the lion walks alone
Nature is cruel
But he knows it's his home

He to his demons
And you to your own
Please let me stand by you
And we'll conquer them all
We will conquer them all

Oh I will conquer them all (x3)",Ivory Road,2012
King Charles,"Never let a woman go even when you know she can always be replaced.
She can always be replaced.
Oh, lust only grows like anger and revenge oh beauty comes and goes but love stays until the end.

I wrote you a song Mississippi Isabel 
I even sent you flowers when you fell ill
You've the strength of the Greeks
You are God's masterpiece
You're every triumph, every victory
I believe in every breath you breathe.

And I always imagined you'd be by my side
Whether I'm hiding in the city or tearing through the wild
You're only a yoke and noose on my throat
If your beauty is a fortress then my love will be the moat.
Oh, fall in love with you, fall in love with you, I must. 

I'll consume every part of you to indulge my love lust.

Never let a woman go even when you know she can always be replaced.
She can always be replaced.
Oh, lust only grows like anger and revenge oh beauty comes and goes but love stays until the end.

Never let a woman go even when you know

With a guitar in my hand or a gun in my hand, I'd give it all up for your hand in my hand. 
For the sun on my skin as the morning begins, I'd die in the darkness to feel your skin on my skin.

King Charles,"Found out about her 
Her name's Mississippi Isabel 
She grows wild strawberries 
She's made of ivoir and pearl. 

To look at the universe 
She'd abandoned the world 
I go with her back to the darkness 
I'd give my life for this girl 
[Repeat x2]
I rode around on my bicycle 
All the way in the rain 
She kissed me once I took her out for lunch 
And she never kissed me again 

Her beauty knows no tick of time 
She's the song of the nightingale 
The torturer, the remedy and the tragedy 
In the passionate tale 

And I begged for forgiveness for the way that I am 
And I hope she doesn't blame men for the inelegance of men

On a boat, one ten miles east
Of Aberdeen

With twenty-four hours in each
Of shattered boyhood dreams
And not much sleep

I'd much rather be me
For once I'd much rather be me

A month at sea
And then they'll surely sleep
With their heads
Still stuck on land

A month on land
And then they'll surely dream
Of girls they can afford
But cannot have

And in a drunken haze
They're on the rolling wave

On which the Lizards feed.

Wear your blizzard season coat
Burn a bridge and burn a boat
Stake a Lizard by the throat.

The reapers name their harvest dawn
All your tarnished devil's spoons
Will rust beneath our corn.

Across his rain tree shaded lawn
Lizard bones become the clay-
And there a Swan is born

Wear your blizzard season coat
Burn a bridge and burn a boat
Stake a Lizard by the throat.

Round which upholstered Lizards sold
Visions to their leaden flock
Of rainbows' ends and gold.

Of walls and trumpets thousand fold

And reels of dreams unrolled . . .

I ran my hand across my head,
Pulled out a pile of worried hair.
I went to my physician who was buried in his thoughts
He said, 'Son, you've been reading
Too much Elephant Talk.'

He said, 'The thing about depression is,
Well you just can't let it get you down,
You have to see the world for what it is:
A circus full of freaks and clowns
And you'll never please everybody,
It's a well established fact',
He said, 'I recommend a fifth of Jack
And a bottle of Prozac.'

What can you give a man who has everything?
Can you give him back his edge,
Can you make him want to sing?
No, you can only take from him,
And there's nothing he can do.
I've got the driving me to drink and eat
A bottle of Prozac blues.

Well, I woke up this morning and I shaved off my head.

When people stomped on dirty floors

Convinced that I don't care
It's safe as houses I swear
I was just sitting musing
The virtues of cruising
When altitude dropping
My ears started popping
One more red nightmare

Sweat beginning to pour down
My neck as I turn round
I heard fortune shouting
Just get off of this outing
A farewell swan song
See you know how turbulence can be
The stewardess made me
One more red nightmare

Reality stirred me
My angel had heard me
The prayer had been answered
A reprieve has been granted
The dream was now broken
Thought rudely awoken
Really safe and sound
Asleep on the Greyhound

King Curtis,"Oh! they say some people long ago
Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues,1959
King Curtis,"Every night your line is busy
All that buzzin' makes me dizzy
Couldn't count on all my fingers
All the dates you had with swingers

Bye, bye, bye, baby
I'm gonna kiss you goodbye and go right through that doorway
So long, I'm leaving
This is the last time we'll meet on the street going your way

Don't look surprised, you know you've buttered your bread
So now it's fair, you should stare at the back of my head
If you write a letter to me
My former friend, don't you end with an R.S.V.P.

I'm going bye, bye, I'm moving
Tomorrow I may be splittin' to Britain or Norway
I'm saying bye, bye, bye baby

She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

She may search this whole wide world over

I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay

And then she said ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

""Well Billy Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

It's on your face

Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

Would you like to glide in my beautiful balloon?
We could float among the stars together, you and I

For we can fly, we can fly
Up, up and away
My beautiful, my beautiful balloon

The world's a nicer place in my beautiful balloon
It wears a nicer face in my beautiful balloon
We can sing a song and sail along the silver sky

For we can fly, we can fly
Up, up and away
My beautiful, my beautiful balloon

Suspended under a twilight canopy
We'll search the clouds for a star to guide us
If by some chance you find yourself loving me
We'll find a cloud to hid us, keep the moon beside us

With my hair down in my eyes and she says ""Hi"" 
And I stumble to the breakfast table 
While the kids are goin' off to school goodbye 
And she reaches out 'n' takes my hand 
And squeezes it 'n' says ""How ya feelin', hon?"" 
And I look across at smilin' lips 
That warm my heart and see my mornin' sun 
 
And if that's not lovin' me 
Then all I've got to say 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime 
And there's no such thing as Doctor Seuss 
Or Disneyland, and Mother Goose, no nursery rhyme 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime 
And when my self is feelin' low 
I think about her face aglow and ease my mind 
 
Sometimes I call her up at home knowin' she's busy 
And ask her if she could get away and meet me 
And maybe we could grab a bite to eat 
And she drops what she's doin' and she hurries down to meet me 
And I'm always late 
But she sits waitin' patiently and smiles when she first sees me 
'cause she's made that way 
 
And if that ain't lovin' me 
Then all I've got to say 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't snow in Minneapolis when the winter comes

Everything is nothing, if you got no one and you did walk in the night

Too deep in love and we got no way out and the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing

Baby, I will hurt you never

I met him in a cell in New Orleans
I was down and out
He looked at me to be the eyes of age
As he spoke right out
He talked of life, he talked of life
He laughed, slapped his leg a step

He said his name, Bojangles
And he danced a lick across the cell
He grabbed his pants
In fettered stance
Oh, he jumped up high
Then he clicked his heels
He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh
Shook back his clothes all around

Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles, dance!

He danced for those
At minstrel shows and county fairs
Throughout the south
He spoke with tears of 15 years
How his dog and him traveled about
His dog up and died, he up and died
After 20 years he still grieves

He said I dance now
At every chance in honky tonks
For drink and tips
But most of the time
I spend behind these county bars
Cause I drinks a bit

One that they could croon 
As only they can

Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn

They left me lying on the floor
Heading for local church, no a trace of guilt in their eyes

And so easy to convert

Knocking at the preacher's door
none of them were ever here before

I open up my hand, the ""Goofer Dust"" is falling

To destroy the cemetery on their land

I wonder what could be so powerful beyond the dark
Human bones... in little chambers all along the narrow halls

I see a light, I push some bones aside

Down into the dark I go, another chamber, a chamber with a glow

A full size figure carved in wood up against the wall
Her face is peeling from all the years gone by
Is it just a statue, or is it what I'm looking for?
I break her face and see another one instead

Dried out face with hate upon me gaze
How grotesque... the mummy wears a crown of thorns
From the empty sockets where its eyes should be

And there it was... The House of God

Henry froze: ""Oh, you mean our ghost?""

""Downstairs on the lowest floor
That's where you will find THE DOOR

""Miriam please take my hand"", then his mood really changed

Up to a room where love they would share
To a room that smelled as if Miriam was still in there

Jonathan was a hideous sight
So Abigail she hilled the candlelight
What was to come, should have never been done
She was blocking her mind from his awful thing
In her mind his moaning became
Nothing but falling on slippery stairs
Falling and crying, crawling and dying
At the end of the stairs

A woman in every single way
Abigail was walking in the forest where
The darkness, it seems to be alive

It was hours ago that she left her home
The chapel in which Black Horsemen saved and raised her soul
And now in the darkest night a storm was born
And Abigail, she did not know...she was its prey

Solo: Andy

In the storm itself a monster came alive
Chasing Abigail, lightning from the sky

Ah...then her face turned white
Never did she see the EYE that cried
Raindrops on her head, weeping for the dead, rain...rain...
Turning red

Oh no...Let me go back to my home...Oh no...

Solo: Mike

God he looked away the night the storm it came
And Abigail was drawn into the rain

Rain...was pulling on her hair
To where there is a mansion...THE LAIR

The mansion showed itself...in silhouette

Ah...rusty iron gates
This is where the Little One she waits

Turning red

Oh no... Let me go back to my home...Oh no... Oh...

Fear and twisted hate, then the feeling of being betrayed
Overwhelmed him...
""That child is part of ME""

He had to get up, get up and out of the wheelchair
But without his cane, Oh he didn't stand a chance
The cane was in her hand, she used it to push him back
Push him in the chest, she was ready for attack
Then a quick blow to his wrist, four five across his back
One last one hit him in the neck

""I can't believe you're still alive

She was laughing at his every scream

""Now we're finally alone, Miriam
Abigail is here to stay""

The birth of Abigail would soon be realized
The second coming of a devil in disguise
And the moon did not shine
It was darker than ever before

On this sacred night
The soul of Miriam was crying out in pain
Remembering the day, arrival in the rain

The pain of labor was so strong that Miriam died

To whom it may concern.

I am scared to death. 9 years ago they finally let me out, and I
was just beginning to feel better. I am not Myself any longer.
I guess You could not even recognize My face if You saw Me now.
That phone call 2 hours ago has torn Me apart. It was Grandma.
She invited Me back to the old house. I do not want to go back,
but I must. Maybe You will understand My fear if I tell
You what happened during My childhood.

18 years ago I was living with My mother and
My sister Missy in Grandma's old house. I had
been told that Grandma was away on a long vacation,
and that she would soon return. She did.

I have later found out that she was actually being released
from that same asylum. ""She's insane"", they said, when she
kept on babbling about ""THEM"". I still cannot make up
My mind about who really did separate Grandpa's head
from his shoulders. You see, ""THEY"" were always so
nice to Me.

house. So here is what happened 18 years ago. And

Mother's getting weaker, looking paler day by day

As morning came, she could not make it out of bed
And Grandma's spell was getting straight into her head
Not a single word, she didn't seem to be alive

Getting weaker, looking paler day by day

Then Missy came in and she led me by the hand
I didn't want to go, Oh but I should have known
Mother was barely conscious, why should I care
Just looking forward to the next ordeal

I think I heard My sister begging me to stay
She gave me the phone, so I could call someone for help
I simply let go of her hand, then I cut the wire

Missy was crying as I left them both behind
And Mother's getting weaker, Missy shouted at 
My back ""I hate you""",Mother's Getting Weaker,2004

Oh she's pretending as always, but
She does make a good cup of tea.

Now you be good to Grandma; and remember
She's been away on a long vacation.

I tried anyway

Took me away

A hundred things on the re-up of course I'm living fat
My Mercedes outside nigga where yours at
Top down on a good day the K the I the wood way
Got cats thinking should I stay fuck what the hood say
Niggaz wanna rob me now
Bitches wanna slob me now
Hoes didn't holla last year feel sorry now
Practice jumpshot Reggie Mil (Reggie Miller) Robert Horry now
The nigga that you with played like Atari now
Lyrically unorthodox I flow continuous
Never on a straight path I'm known to bend a twist
Put it down from the Suburb to the Tennament
You bet against me but wanna wonder where your money went
I get the cash take niggaz out like trash
Known to stack a mean stash they used to call me pure math
Back in the days all I did was stay paid
But as they say in the South bitch gimme some head

Excuse Me mister do she got a sister
Who he not to kiss her True she do got a blister
Not a movie plot twist like a twistler
If I needed my meat burned I'd go to Sizzler
Getting paid like a biker with the best crank
Sprayed like a high ranked sniper in the West Bank
Type to just blank and don't show much pitty
When I'm in the city I always keep a dutch with me
Touch her titty till she ask me where the trees is at
Or tell me don't squeeze that rats wanna tease a cat
Let the dog beg wait up
Who talking Doom with the hog leg straight up New Yorkin'

No matter how hard they try they can't stop us now (That's Correct)
We got King Geedorah on the boards with that golden sound (King Geedorah)
They don't know how we get down when we're out uptown (I Just Can't Stand the Guy)
So when you see us in the streets",Anti-Matter,2003
King Geedorah,"Fast lane
Three, two, one, go

Only God is judged, never plea the case
Oh, reason where is the truth we can never erase?
I've fallen from grace, black nor face
Ounce of green smoke, jack wit no chase

Peddle on the floor, thirsty for score
Fastlane destination, top of the cash game
See keep like a missile with mad aim
You can't blame missin' spirits who campaign

A mystery at most, universal most steel is hot
Yup off in the knot
Vision clear like a Hindu with the third eye dot
We be wig, nah baby that's my word I got

'Nuff rhymes, tuff times, try talkin' to kids
Who walk around thinkin' that doesn't forgive
Life in itself is like a bid
And if you scared to die then you scared to live

Ain't it a shame dealin' with the remain?
Hennessey on the brain, travel the plane

Will the copy cats twist the def traps?
Bliss the sex raps blind to jet black
The matters awake in response since came to life
Singin' a seance, escape the realm

Bly swift like 'o' at, fake jacks a cast
Catch two smacks, gentlemen relax
Blaze trails that haven't been traveled in a while
Scatter clues for those who equate the style

Cruisin' in the Lex out the window seat
While I be trippin' off the rhyme, bop my head to the beat
I can't speak on delirious mood swings
True crowns, a helmed at the true kings

Tell ya take it back, straighten
Money makin', light we sign awaken, idle mind oversaken
No debatin' on the vessel that we navigatin'
Gravitatin', schemin', leave 'em standin' waitin'

Specialize in futuristic mental picture paintin'
We are slave to sick ways, I'm quenchin' with thirst
Gift of a new day they seem like a curse

What we made, penetrate the charade
The incision is barely felt from the sharpness of the blade
Movin' motionless through this masquerade

Loomin' in the dark but justice save a spark, rock
Like a match made in heaven and hell apart
But still one, if it's life we start

So real reveal, sign is sealed
What we feels translates to meals
That nine to five shit is no joke, muscle in scientist
But don't look upon my hustlin'

Will the copy cats twist the def traps?
Bliss the sex raps, blind to jet black
The matters awake in response since came to life
Singin a seance, escape the realm

Bly swift like 'o' at, fake jacks a cast
Catch two smacks, gentlemen relax
Blaze trails that haven't been traveled in a while
Scatter clues for those who equate the style

Look at them, those two space monsters
The one with the three heads is King Geedorah
And that one's Gigan, we are controlling them
",Fastlane,2003
King Geedorah,"Follow the light ... the light is your guide ...
I am controller of Planet X
And I've invited you here to discuss something that's very important

King Geedorah, take me to your leader
Quick to claim that he not no snake like, ""Me neither""
They need to take a breather
He been rhyming longer than Sigmund the sea creature
Been on Saturday feature -- pleased to meet cha'
And came to wake you up out the deep sleeper, like --
He needed to stop before he caught the knee-drop
Even give you more zip-zip then ZZ Top
On full beers, though shall not ball corners
Geedorah like, ""One more step, and y'alls goners""
So-called rich, front if y'all want to
When he spit electrics don't be in y'all saunas
He only here to warn us what the plan is
The hour is upon us, it's bananas
Born alone die alone, no matter who your man is
Hope he live long enough to tell it to his grandkids
King Geedorah, three-finger ring fever
Spring chicken eater, ID'ed as the ringleader
Who needs a heater? Catch 'em with bare hands
These same hands that make razors out beer cans
His own biggest fan
And got a fan base as big as Japan
Uh ... yeah ... and?
All hail the king! And give him three cheers, fam
Like, hip hip hooray!
Do his thing for the little kids like Sling Blade

To the grave, put in work like a slave
On how to flip scripts on the dipstick brigade
Rock 'em like ""Su-su-sudio"" played
Back when we used to rock the shag, no fade
This skilled trade like a tailor made suede
Hit the studio -- and I'm paid
Half upfront, half upon mastering
""Would you like that in cash,"" last thing you should ask the king
You don't have to be no crystal ball reader
Allergic to salt pita, used to be a wall beater
In the game like a Wall Street cheater
A lot of rap noise is annoying like Cita
Turn into a triple-X monster from a fairy tale movie
He don't know me very well, do he?
King Geedorah, crush on his seed's teacher
They need to pay her better, she had nothing on the reefer
Heifer, and I had to offer her a stick of gum
She was as thick as they come, and taught a strict curriculum
Which is only good for my son
When I'm in the hood? Razor's on tongue
Nowadays, it's amazing raising young
Rule number one: keep your fazers on stun!",Fazers,2003
King Geedorah,"""The final hour is approaching for the people of Earth, hear this!""

She said ""Excuse me""
And you be illin with the wordplay
He said ""Thank you very much I'm billing till Thursday""
Once heard a beat drum it sounded like a sloppy knock
Whoever was on the mic speech is pure poppy cock
These go back to the days of pop lock
Even back to rumors that Mikey died off pop rocks
Where the girls wore jellies and played hop scotch
Older broads used to wear tennises and sloppy socks
APB the 3 headed with the fancy crown
Last seen headed towards a city in shanty town
All of a sudden can't be found
Safe and sound mouth on the nipple panties down
Put a choke hold on the monster from Ogopogo
Whoever did they vocals
And also they so-so logo
That's a no-no
Through the wheels of steel phono
Geedorah no deals pro bono

""Ah!""",The Final Hour,2003
King Geedorah,"Render unto Geedorah what is Geedorah's
Tend to when he seizure through a beaker and a tweezers
Read the fine print and be like, ""What's the big deal?""
Spun wheels-of-steel since broke wheel Big Wheel
Back when it was greasy S-curl, now it's easy dread
Had a rhyme on how they used to tease him 'bout his peasy head
Yes-yes-y'all to the beat, have a ball or Avacore
Have it your way, grab his straw, Jabberjaw
Since two tone Lee's, these new phonies is boney hoes

Lonely like cheese and baloney only
I could've broke my ""sacro-philly-ac"" (sacroiliac)
Silly grind, Billy Jack, illy nine milli black
Listen to it go ""bang!"" Through and through a Kangol
A strange combination of a king who use slang flow
Two-thirds slow, one-third amazing
Wonder words, fine sponsor of this Thunderbird occasion
And have an iller rhyme, at least by Miller Time
Collect the skrilla and geese with a killer dime
Met her out in Killa Queens, originally she from the Philippines
I love the way she fill her jeans
Still a teen, and made for strange bedfellows
Okay, so it's head to elbows for shell-toes
Uh-oh, heads up! There she blows
A whole load of Head & Shoulders, and who care where she goes
Let the music take control
Just don't let the evildoers abuse it and use it to take your soul
It's like putting fire to fake gold, it turn colors

And get duller than a bake roll with no butter

The shutter of a cake hole
Who break drakes 'til it get old and flake mold
Cornball, have 'em seeing white stars, I warned y'all
Like getting hit with a bottle of Mo' from Sean Paul
(He not white) ... Oh, he mad light though
Either which way, they not ready for the lightning show
And can't scandalize mine
You could ask a swine who can't stands when I shine
Geedorah the professor, add a question to the lessons
He suggest you get a full assessment instead of guessing
It's too stressing, did he stutter like rookie yes-men?
Or did he just bring the butter, like the cookie chessmen
This just in: they ain't even worth the worry

Lying on their first birth and couldn't even hurt a Smurfberry

Hear ye, hear ye! How dare ye
Go up against the king who do his thing tri-yearly?
They're too carefree with their mouths around here
Off with his head, and display it at Town Square
On top a seven-feet spike, make sure it's on tight
In light of when the peasants throw stones with all their might
Skull get smashed for weeks
'Til vulture beaks eats the last meat off your cheeks
Maybe then they'll know the right words to speak
Out loud, at home, in the world, or in the streets
It's no escape, just in case
All the kings' mens and 'em decides to go apes
The most slick-talking of burly guys
Get caught and boiled in oil like curly fries
Even those that's Mr. Furley's size that earned the fate

Could all get burned at the stake
Send word to his closest kins, that for his sins
We claim his throne, his providence, and its citizens
In the name of King Geedorah! ...

Don't make him catch a seizure ...",The Fine Print,2003
King Geedorah,"That's right I got problems and personal issues
Stories that'll make ya, eyes tear and wet tissue
It's true, I'm Madd like the Rapper
I'm so upset I gotta put it up in my rap before I snapper

After the things I've seen from Atlanta to Queens
To the mean streets of Brooklyn when I was a teen
Back and forth to the Islands, scream when I left
But adapted, and still my dreams haven't left

I only hung with the crack kids we not the best
Me and the ruffest ruffnecks went chest to chest
Now my best friend's locked up north I won't rest
'Til I let him live his dream threw me and I confess

That even though both our hearts was dark his was darker
Best believe when shit got spark he was the sparker
And when the block got hot he was the fire starter
And if I had beef my nigga Roger was a martyr

I wonder, how certain people come in my life
I wonder, why'd I get in so many fights
I wonder, why sometimes things just don't go right
Why I gotta live this life, hey hey

I wonder, how certain people come in my life
I wonder, why'd I get in so many fights
I wonder
Why I gotta live this life, hey hey

Yo, you one of the most important people in my life
They called you Dice but I called you cousin
We was buggin' 'cause I figured that we both had something in common
You loved to chat reggae music and I loved rhymin'

But still they ain't call you Dice for nuttin'
I seen you shoot with the wiliest cats and leave them with nothing
Somethin' must have pleased that bluffer in you
To make you wanna take dough from those tougher than you

Threw out school we made money together
When you was on the floor shootin', I was the side better
And yo we cleaned out them cats and took the scraps
But you wasn't a ruff cat and cats knew that

I knew eventually them thugs would try to hurt you
If I was there, I'd never let nobody hurt you, it's hurtful
I knew they wouldn't let you take the money and run
That's why I shoulda came when you told me to come

I wonder, how certain people come in my life
I wonder, why'd I get in so many fights
I wonder
Why I gotta live this life, hey hey

I wonder, how certain things don't go right
I wonder, why'd I get in so many fights
I wonder
Why I gotta live this life, hey hey

Yo, it was June sixth '96, graduation night
Made it threw the school swish shootin' dice gettin' in fights
I even sparked a riot, 'til the school got quiet
And dismiss just got tired of usin' my fists

We had some shit like knife pipes bottles and sticks
Can't forget them 380's, nine's and 22's
Best believe, many dudes was paid in my crew
We made a name for ourselves boy I've seen some drama

Seems my momma never dreamed she'd go threw so much trauma
Comma, pause you ask about cops and laws
Well that shit don't exist when you black and poor
So we broke 'em, but at that night my heart got broken

Choken on the weed smoke drinkin' rum and gettin' open
Not to mention, never a big drinker I'm a thinker
But I'm thinkin' hey dis my night, pass me more liquor
Fight breaks out, I'm just too nice to get in it

But my brother got stabbed and I missed it
Word up, its crazy
Why I gotta live this life, hey hey
(Wonder)

I wonder, why sometimes things just don't go right
I wonder, why certain people come in my life
I wonder, yeah
Why I gotta live this life, hey hey

I wonder, why sometimes things just don't go right
I wonder, why'd I get in so many fights
I wonder
Hey, why I gotta live this life, hey hey

I wonder, why sometimes things just don't go right
I wonder, why I gotta live this life
I wonder
Why I gotta live this life, ay ay uh ay

That's right

King Geedorah,"""Where's the intruder?"" ""Looks like he went to the tower""

Before I rock raps, I drink a keg of Listerine
Then I spit the freshest lines you'll ever hear for centuries
Then I form blazing sword and cut your mic cords
And kill them garbage rhymes only your friends get hyped for
Blitz your whole team, them niggaz need to come clean
So I give 'em an acid wash like old school Levi jeans
(Lockjaw!) Crackin your faulty frame
And I bring the house down without hijackin planes
Locked stocked with two smokin barrels and will use it
To fuck up more beats per minute than drum'n'bass music
Trunks ain't a rapper, he's a monster from the future
Twistin your body in more positions than Kama Sutra
Smart-ass, gettin the Last Word with Jim Jome
With a right hand like Dr. Claw that's known for breakin bones
(""I'll get you next time Gadget, next time"")
We can have a close encounter of the fucked up kind

""Time warp, set on""",Lockjaw,2003
King Geedorah,"1, 2 1, 2 yes
Yo, it's King Gheedra, combined with the forces of nine ether
Blowing woofers and tweeters, shaking syllable meaning
Disaster's cataclysmic, mystic natural, it's about time
We hit you with some substance that's actual

I got a gift call, hip-hop prophecy, says 2003
Ends the reign of the jiggy MC
No more roaming on this planet like scavengers
Sciences broke the code of the Gregorian calendar

Define laws and space in time, trying to trace my lines
Hold up, respect the architect
Digital rollin', my whole crew roll with VS
Type to master this whole universe in three steps

We stretch across the equator with something major
Universal rhyme tones, tamper with ya time zone
Minds blown by the millions jus' for the feeling
Hip-hop, it just don't stop until I make a killing

Nah, I'm kidding, but for real, the world ain't the same no more
Take your life to next level or remain no more
Take your life to next level or remain no more
Word up, word up

Well, I'm colliding with the mind of a survivor
Surviving, uncover the time brother
The high volume white collar high styling
Verge jocking the side, dodgin' mirages

Conquer the vibe, hunger lurks
Nine to five work saga, God bless the life
Father trife, crawl for the light, pounding the globe on sight
Vocal pimpin', it's throat

So you know how we go down yo
Struck from the ghetto yo, medal throw
Settle the dough, live showbiz
The cannonball, weapon, men and arms

Four section, super intelligence, balance
Benevolent, stinging nettle medicine
Crouch tiger, dragon, craftmatic
Watch ya back, if, catch this

Fascist through the atlas, first class diplomatic status
Stagma flag, overstanding the plan
Bar skin, then a [unverified] streets watch timex clocks
[Unverified] punchless [unverified] on the dot five

Minutes to rot
So we blew blocks, crews
It's old news how we do

I'm a drop one rhyme
For every time, I cross the thin line
Between yours and mine, see, it's part of my design, shifting paradigm
Yin and yang combined, must be out ya mind

Thinking star would never shine
Pops duke, focus with a hawk's eye view
I'm all that, a plaintain, and some Ital stew
Gettin' spine ache, British, ATL upon this

Even avitronic figures be thumpin' off over this verbal elixir
Magnetic attraction, raw, nearly Jacksons
Straight open in the caption, here comes the Hix and Braxton's
Lyrical contraction, delivery reaction, it started with a passion

That's just the way it had been, raw with umbilical cords strapped
A corpse, won't drop a curse, while mustard hit this spouse?
Sharp with a needle, try to reach the people
Ya'll fiending for the sequel and the beat's not even EQ'd

We have a snake to catch
",Next Levels,2003
King Geedorah,"Ghidra has arrived, you guys could take five
By the time it's over, no snakes alive
Take the dive, I'm tellin' you, you better off
Then up against a flow to make her, take her sweater off

From the set off when it came to scripts he could hardly brag
It's the result of concentration and lolly-gag
I said, ""Yeah right"" he pulled the mic out a snotty rag
Sealed up air-tight and wrapped up in a body bag

Get a advance and catch chance writer's block
After spendin' the first and last penny
My own worst enemy tell me if I'm OD and usual flow
And made deals with these cats who keep sending dough, so

The Three Headed said it, never get busted
He's a man of his word who's not to be trusted
Beats encrypted, multi-faceted encrusted
Shorty pawn, keep mic rusted

Sort of mellow type of fellow
Who sometimes spaz on wife like Othello
Hell no he won't use words like illuminati
Or Gotti all shotty might use karate

Azar the Gaza cut I'll ask why a mask
With the gall style caps say nice fly
Exact dough till it stack high, white ho, black
Guy the rap game, black eye

Exhiliration, Jet Jag's accelerations
Touch speeds minds can't concieve
Achieve altered, attitudes and angles, angels answer
Aura, illumilation, awesome interperation

Awkward alarm, ankle house arrest and who's best?
Monster Island Czars crush pawn dreams to be king
A frank reality calculation could never be
Quest destined, distant competition dusted

Disgusted raise for second, crowded
Clouded confusion, conclusion simple, plain
Self education, self made millionaires
Serpents slitherin', sidewind searchin'

Stalkin', heat sensin' can't have me Jet Jag's riki tiki tavi
Superhero hit zero to sixty hot pursuit, pedal to the floor
Handlin' lyrics, traction swervin' left right makin' head fix
Layin' high stakes levitates, quick hit breaks
They fly past hit war parts fly loose, kill a mongoose

Fake niggaz contiue to practice the art of intimidation
Sterile minds concieve and threw up all artificial insemination
Syntax a sequential rage unless it's all deliberate
Angle wide words clear, but population stay illiterate

Consider it God's a fine power, fools get rid of it
Men build dreams on promises but lacken' the will to deliver it
You, I disolve connivers like saliva on tic tacs
World is strange, but get the job done like sises mix max

Flip tracks, murder stinks, drunk niggaz killin' six packs
Chokin' on venom, suffered tricknological kick backs
Poverty stricken' minds, all thoughts barely worth two cents
Build history through time, many a design on blueprints

Anooshes slides in the sky, eight-five percent never knew
Wise men arise, pull files like internal revenue
Forever true, appauled? There's self evidence with leverage
Upset? The beast belly concoct

Homogenised beverage
Clever shit, calculate a sabatoge trojan horse
Gift from? See through any G motion that grows in force
Chose to toss to teach familiar line throughout the underworld

God of elevation kills Superman, rape Wondergirl
The discounted, decapitated rapist it's acceptable
The everyday occurrence a fatal outcome's inevitable

Might as well join the forces boss
Chance take a loss like coin toss
Roll with the double headed nickel
Pawn the pawn a Jet Jag with the sickle you and a pickle

King Ghidra yo you ass betta leave 'em alone
Before ya go catch a seizure and leave 'em blown
If you ain't the best of the best in the top three

Either myself, I and me don't even think of caps
But act like you had a slight inkling perhaps
Or get smacked back in the ring like Bob Backlund
Ink jet black and wack

Ha ha ha hey, what's the meaning of this?
Shut up ha ha ha, young man

Proof the king of bars hit the pretty coffin
I'm like a sucker punch (why?) Cause I ain't seen it often
Genius artist, so retarded
Broken hearted, my soul's like a open target
And I'm ready to leave Earth
You step to my death next year on my T-shirt

King Harvest
(Sherman Kelly)


We get it almost every night
When that ol' moon gets-a big and bright
It's a supernatural delight
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight

Everybody here is out of sight
They don't bark, and they don't bite
They keep things loose, they keep things light
Everybody was dancin' in the moonlight

Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight
Everybody's feelin' warm and right
It's such a fine and natural sight
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight

We like our fun and we never fight
You can't dance and stay uptight
It's a supernatural delight
Everybody was dancin' in the moonlight",Dancing in the Moonlight,1973
King Harvest,"This is about two cats
They're sittin' down by a river in the swamps
They're sitting on a log
One of them is kind of a big fellow
And the other one is a little bit smaller and he's got a long-billed cap
And they're sittin' there ponderin' on what they're gonna do for the night
And anything the big guy decides on the little guy's for
Cause he digs him, he's cool
So it's called Roosevelt and Ira Lee

The river was dark and muddy
And the moon was on the rise
And all of the creatures in the swampland
Had woke up to feed for the night
Roosevelt and Ira Lee were sittin' there on a log
Ira Lee turned to Roosevelt and said
I'd sure like to have a mess of bull frog
He said: Yeah yeah lawd sure would taste good

So they slipped on their rubber boots
And walked down to the water edge
And right away they knew that the night would be a bummer
Cause Ira Lee stepped on a water mossacin Ugh! Ugh! Lawd
""Somebody help me !""

Ira Lee turned to Roosevelt when he quit his screamin' and kickin'
And he said, ""Let's forget about those bullfrog legs
And go out and steal us some chickens""
And Ol' Roosevelt said like this now
""Yeah, yeah, ooh it sure would taste good
Yes it would I love my chicken""
The river was dark and muddy

You so full of bitchness
You trip flipping on chicks but a b-boy make him wanna shit bricks
This is vicious, everything out yo lips is fictitious, hehe
Misses made me mad as Mozzy, huh
Man the motive must've been made of molly, huh
Man I Maximize a mess with a mind of Malcolm X
And a martyr man whose mom is Maude, huh
Better be cool, I'ma lead you to the B fools that'll greet you
With a blacca, blacca, blacca leave you in the coffin often talkin' fecal
I'm a grown mane, taking this with no shame
Really wanna have no brains, step foot into my domain, no games
All of my children are grown and I'm feeling they love me but don't really like me
I'm illing I'm no longer locked in a marriage I'm careless
So anyone of my loved ones you funk and I'll inherit

Better quit beef end the dissing
And then I dip I shoot you
On a head of Cohiba I go cuckoo
Or poo poo like a shit fever
I don't wanna take a tip neither
The MC's I'm a grim reaper
So anybody coming at me tripping like he wanna run a war with an in visa
But the bully get to pulling everybody hard like he had a chip reader
This is Iso, big dick psycho, smash this chick and this guy like a kick flip, primal
They don't wanna see me rocking with Tech N9ne no
Yeah I know could've been backwards thinking Tech signed Iso (what you price bro?)
Get it big like Bruce Bruce me me me

We go out, we don't go out, this strickly parkin' lot pimpin'
That there sounds like a nice game plan
Nice thangs wit thick frames, no need to think twice man
Pick up some bud, pick up my boys, wipe off my dubs

And matter fact fuck the whole nine

Yo, turn the club 'to a jungle gym
Matter fact girl get all under him
If you know any freaks act like one of them
Get crunk again, have fun again, dirty
Err'body leave ya guns in the cars
And err'body run right to the bar
Get ya something staright or the bubbly
We ain't Bubba but it's finna get ugly

[Verse: King Jacob]
Yo, Vokal is so extreme
Strut up in the club wit the rest of the team
Thinking 'bout my dubs the compress is so mean
Got on blue and gray today, so fresh, so clean
Had to hide my eyes from the Disco beam
Just enough sight to find a Disco Queen
Just enough light to fire up this mo heat
Got just enough ice to not be low key
Look, I'm King Jacob you ain't gotta know me
But ya, you so real so you gotta know me
Addictive type and my baby moma OD
Descriptive writing made a million dollars for me
I'm just a Young Dude, young and doing young
Pursuing like them one dudes from St. Louis
Murph, come on dirty, where P, let's represent the turf (Youth City)
If you change in the game represent what we worth

[Chorus]

[Verse: Murphy Lee]
Hey yo I'm Murphy Lee the trouble maker
I'm in the club with my house shoes on
Don't like being in the house too long
Having dreams about buying the bar out
I don't own a dog so sometimes I got to let my cars out
Hit the lawn on my humble abode
My car dusty but it rassle the road
See I used to have ""freetime""
Now my life like a ""Nextel"" and it's not ""free OP"" time
I'm three times, four minutes away
Peace to printed shirts for the LA in the ashtray
I ain't been in this car for a month
So I think I'm a call this a throwback blunt
Hit the corner bumping Old School, ready to drink
Cause my stomach full of Barbeque Tofu
I knew two people at the door
So I EIP, parked it and ordered some more

[Chorus]

[Verse: The Professor]
Hey wait, hey hey, hold up, is it my turn yet?
I been waiting the many let me introduce you to 'prentice
Plot - me in the club and it's 3 AM
With Murph and Jake so drunk I had to lean on them
Disgusted, I snapped myself up, this ain't no fun
I took a girl by the fat girl and smoke my one
High as can be, back on the scene, what do I see?
Dance flo' hiding her plan, they taking off things
Daisy Duke shorts unzipped with the thong inbetween
Girl, you got the fattest ass I ever seen
I give you, what you need dick, weed, but you gotta be clean
A fat ass ain't err'thing except if burning up slings
King I stumbled in to him, he still want to drink
A thick chick took him away and gave gim head on the scene
Blinking, looked over my shoulder and tried to spot Murph
Spotted three dimes that swooped him up, Menage time

Think that you better niggas show me, let's have a stomp-off
Go hard, stack your cheese up until you can't see the sky

Catch him at his foul play, hawk him like a hallway

Well OK, you should have nothin' to say
We guarantee it goin' be another hit man, ok?
For your reference, I been inside the house since 6
Bakin' up bars of rap, chiefin' and munchin' on chips
Now should I go dip? debate what style and color to get
We go out, we don't go out, this strickly parkin' lot pimpin'
That there sounds like a nice game plan
Nice thangs wit thick frames, no need to think twice man
Pick up some bud, pick up my boys, wipe off my dubs
Hittin' on chickens and buckets, so what they rollin' on hubs
I'm honkin' my horn like a animal straight from the barn

And it's a fact, Green Bay sendin' em Packin'
Man it's goin' on a three day thrashin'
Fuck this for real why'all, I need some action
Aw man, Murph don't want to drive the Benz
But he's too busy tryin' to dodge his friends
I just want to go back outside again
Get high again, sippin' Heineken's
Grab my 22 inch wired rims
Hit the street, got bitches pilin' in

Ah, I guess my sista know a brotha
I'm a nasty mothersucker cause I'm poppin' wit cornbread and butter
Cause there ain't nuttin' like booty in the daytime
Look at it wiggle, sunshinin' on the waistline
And matter fact fuck the whole nine
The whole time I'm thinkin' bout this party goin' downtown
I had to get my ass outta the bed (ah get up!)
Ain't nothin' like a lil' last minute head (ah you right)

King Johnson,"I remember holdin' on to you
All them long and lonely nights I put you through
Somewhere in there I'm sure I made you cry
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico
One place I may never go in my life again
Was I just off somewhere just too high
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

You were always on my mind

Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times

Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me, give me one more chance

Hell yeah
This is how we supposed to do
Uh-huh, Black Fist we gon' do?

[Chorus]
Drop the grenade, niggas ain't larger
Time to get paid, you're in the alarm
Rappers get slayed, and they cause no harm
I'm about to lay, hey, can I get some?

[King Just]
Yo, come get a fuckin taste of reality
Casualty, wept over the whole fuckin galaxy
Battle me, your styles a game like Sorry
Or like Atari, I'm gnarly just like a Harley
Davidson, I take on the bravest one
And turn into that bitch ass nigga he was
'cause, ain't no fakin and no playin
And every word that I say, is every word that I'm slayin
Oh God, why do they think I'm broad
Is it my lyrics is hard or is I'm wit the Mob
From the Six, now all these rappers talkin shit
But I must be schemin on my life to make hits
Black Fist on the rise, oh now you're surprised
Ya niggas don't exist, like fuckin pens you pry
But I'mma ride, this beat like girls ridin my meat
Fuckin wit Just, that's like swimmin in Shit's Creak
Wit diarrhea, oh mamma mia
Skills is ill, real faster than a cheetah
In a jungle, and I'mma watch ya empire crumble
If rap was football, ya niggas would of been fumble

[Chorus]

[King Just]
Back up, back up, yes Zoo's in town
Wit the new twist and a brand new sound
What you want? Ya niggas ain't ready for war
'cause it take ten more, before I get raw
Hardcore, off the wall hip hop
Nonstop, settin up shop on your block
Wit glocks, let ya brain rot
Mob tactics, bustin shots, there's a freeze on the pop
What blood clot? Means no money, no honey
And that's what make us better than you dummies
Sayin all types of shit like Shaolin wouldn't last
But just like an automobile you been gassed
Passed, just like the rest, you want to come for test
My brain's half rhyme, the other half cess
I've been blessed wit the success
What did you except? Look at the way I catch wet
From the projects, and I'mma live here
Til I die, gettin high, Shaolin Soldiers take over in '95
And I'mma make sure all my shit is raw
For ya niggas who front, spell it backwards, war

[Chorus]

[King Just]
Hey good lookin, what you got cookin
Pack your nerve quick, I have this in the street shookin
The fucked up, niggas better duck
Somebody call a bomb squad, 'cause I'm about to blow up
Boom, there goes the building
The bomb makes a killa stackin loot to the ceiling
Who dwellin and dealin, maybe I got the fuckin feelin
That I'mma make platinum, I gots to see the million
I'm destined to buck fuckin wild just like a Western
They goin two in the quarter, and have mad sessions
Ain't no second guessin, I'm back, where's ya heart at?
Shaolin's on the map, Zoo niggas attack
The track, got my mind flippin a hundred miles a minute
And as long as I'm in it, boy, I'mma finish
A M.C. off, they got lost and tossed by the source
'cause I pay the cost to be the boss
You get flagged like Betty Ross and the Spangled Banner
Slammin shit more harder than fuckin Thor's hammer
The ill manner, wit ill grammar
When I get mad, I turn the opposite of fuckin David Bammer
The incredible, unedible, turn backwards
Terrible, cock a phony rappers offa pedestal

You better off gettin pick a size, tryin to ban us
Either way you put it off, I'mma be heard

Like a nerve, don't fuck what ya heard
That nigga just started hangin out on the curb
What's the verdict, soundin like me, you can't word it
I put it in overdrive, while you short circuit
Worship the ground that I walk on
I brought on, all the real niggas that you talked on

Walkin our dogs, ya cats better beat yours

You weak paw, me and my street niggas a' eat why'all

I just want to say what you want me to

oh, take me. take me back
Take me back to virginia,
Take me back I want to go back for good

Sleep to the music of the ice cream man
And rest my head
If I wake up on the right side
I'll sit at my window and play
A song for my people from yesterday

And I see you when I'm sleeping
And I know I'm not lost as long as my lines are true

Dancing to the music
As she sings out to me
Smiling and laughing as the people dance my soul
Take me back to virginia

Wonder if you know I'm there
If you looked in my eyes
Would you see what's inside?
Would you even care?

So I wait for the day, and the courage to say
How much I love you

Sittin' in ya cell thinkin' to yourself, ""how'd I fail""
Well, why’d I wail?

Now do you see this, the way the grey controls only
The souls that go to sleep to sink and dissolve
I set adrift, in between the concrete and the mist
Just another inner city bliss

King Krule,"Here's another thing
That threw up in my mind like the razor blade and her wrist locked
In a closet of Deep Space Nine
Deposit for a wasted life
I lost it with a sweepstakes sigh in another fucking fight
A junkie in a queue for the lavatory line

That's another lost sight
A stabbing of his eyes
Her veins are now popping like Blue Train lines
Still pumping on the bathroom floor, and not for the frost or what the mirror thought it saw
He got a clearer thought and pulled her straight out
""You got me jumping from a real safe height
I wanna fall forever if you ain't by my side
I wanna fall forever if you ain't in my life""

Smoke settled in a fabric of the BFE 34

King Krule,"Dumb surfer is giving me his cash
Won a bet for fifty and now I need a slash
Man this band that's playing, is playing fucking trash
Skunk and onion gravy, as my brain's potato mash

He came across the back of a bureaucratic stash
Shot the lot for credit and never got it back
He's mashed, I'm mashed, we're mashed
That cat got slashed in half like that

As venus completes orbit, I’m feeling slightly mashed
The stir fry didn’t absorb it, I need another slash
She spoke in English, it was low lit where we sat
Remembering her face but that’s the end of that

I’m a step from madness as I puke on pavement slabs
Got a bit embarrassed, need to get back to the lab
In the depths of traffic, I was feeling like we crashed
With a girl from Slovak in a European cab

From a set of habits, I can see momentums mashed
If we were commuting, this train would fucking crash
Now my brain's diluting with blame and guilt and hash
Getting lashed, getting lashed by all of the gods

By all of the gods, by all of the gods

As my brain's diluting, I suffer from whiplash
This girl's now screaming, I think we've gone and crashed

King Krule,"Lonely blue, lonely blue
He slated life, was never alone
Lost his touch, encased head to toe
I'd save him but he's dead
She still hugs the cold night air
Still will search
The burdening city awaits
But he’s gone

Lonely blue, lonely blue
She thought about the flesh and his bones
Took a trip and called down the phone
I'd answer but I’m gone
My head's in all kinds of a mess
She takes it upon herself, concaves her chest
Now I'd be glad to see, now I'd be glad to see

Lonely blue, lonely blue
The blue cave, the deep dark unknown
Submerged forever soaked to the bone
She screams but she’s stone
Repeats my theory
Crawling through the dirt
From the deep dark, I wandered alone
So forlorn
Now I’ll be glad to see you
Now I’ll be glad to see you
In a ballad, we touch
'Cause our skulls will mush
So please don’t let go of our kingdom of trash

That boy he's just a puke stain
That girl she made me mutate

Oh so lonely
Oh so lonely

And high above the moon was new

King Kukulele and the Friki Tikis,"Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there.

The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads.
And mama in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap.

When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.

The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow
Gave the luster of mid-day to objects below.
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tinny reindeer.

With a little old driver, so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be St Nick.
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name!

""Now Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen!
On, Comet! On, Cupid! on, on Donner and Blitzen!
To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!""

As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky.
So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,
With the sleigh full of Toys, and St Nicholas too.

And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St Nicholas came with a bound.

He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.
A bundle of Toys he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a peddler, just opening his pack.

His eyes-how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.

The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.
He had a broad face and a little round belly,
That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly!

He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself!
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.

He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk.
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose!

He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
But I heard him exclaim, 'ere he drove out of sight,
""Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!""",The Night Before Christmas,2008

Once again it's another rap bandit
Fiending at I and I can't stand it
Wanna be down with the Day-Glo
Knocking on my door, saying, ""a yo yo""
Knocking on my door, saying, ""a yo yo""
""I got a funky new tune with a fly banjo""
I can't understand what the problem is
I find it hard enough dealing with my own biz
How'd they get my name and number
Then I stop to think and wonder
Bout a plan, yo man, I gotta step out town
You wanna call me up? Take my number down
It's 222-2222
I got an answering machine that can talk to you
It goes

Hey how ya doin'
Sorry ya can't get through
But leave your name and your number
And I'll get back to you

Yo, check it, exit the old style
Enters the new
But nothing's new 'bout being hawked by a crew
Or should I say flock cause around every block
There's Harry, Dick, and Tom, with a demo in his palm
Now I'm with helping those who want to help themselves
And flaunt a nut that's doggy as in dope
But it's not the mood to hear
The tales of limousines and pails
Of money they'll make like a pro
I be like, ""Yo black, just play me the tape""
But at the show the time to spare I just make
But the songs created in they shacks
Are so wick-wick-wack, situations like this
And now I hate they give me smiles cool-Aid wide and ask
""Was it def?""
And with the straightest face I be like, ""Hell yes""
I slip them the digits to Papa Prince Paul
So I don't go AWOL but yet I know when they call
They get

Party at the dug-out on Diction Ave
Haven't been to the jam in quite a while
Figure I'll catch up on the latest styles
'Stead piles and piles of demo tapes bi-da miles
All I wanna do is cut on the decks wild
But edition up here bi-da miles to the center
Reliever of duty, Plug One mosies in
And I be like, ""Yo G, Pos does all the producing""

Now woe is me to the third degree
Mase pulls the funny so I make like a bunny
Jettin'
But I'm getting used to this demo abuse
Getting raped and giving birth to a tape
'Cause there's no escape from the clutches of a hawker
Attached to my success, sent like a stalker
Make way to my radius playin' fly guy
Try to get on my back they force like Luke Sky
Me myself and I go through this act daily
And rarely do I not
No matter how I dodge some jackal always nails me
No matter what the plot
And even out on tour they be like,
""Yo I got a tape to play you back at the hotel""
I be like ""Oh swell""
Unveil the numeric code to dial my room
And tell them to call me at noon
But of course there's no answering machine in my room
But a pretty young adorer
Who I swung on tour
And if it rings while we're alone
She'll answer the phone
And with the quickness she'll recite like a poem

""Hey, you done did the right thing, dial up my ring ring
Now you're waiting on the beep
Say, I would love if you'd sing
The tune to Tru instead of fronting on the speak""
So no problemo, just play the demo
And at the end it's break out time
Please oh please don't press rewind
'Cause I'll just lay it down the line

Sorry ya can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number
And I'll get back to you

Hey how ya doing

Count the money, no time to duffle, I paper bag it
Drop the top and I paper tag it
Got a new Glock and I’m laser taggin’

To dodge law, but God is law, awesome virtue

Cause daddy never had his back
Always talkin bout how his mama front now that's played out
You are who you're made of, all make-up don't make out

Mouths full of foul words but never put the hours in to get ours
Hours curse us
Reverse ourselves cause cowards verse us

And medicine isn't healing but a hug is
And smiles don't last forever but forever is
A mighty long time if you never smile, you never live

I said God, save us, money, slave us

I said God, save us, money, slave us

Every second count
Cause if I'm second than that's still a blessing
Cause you took a second just to check me out
Could a check me out, I mean out for real
We need family time, we got a house to build
I mean why they tryna take the house from Bill
Now we need a doctor and a house for real
Dear Mr. President, if you're hesitant
Your presence is requested in the mist of neglagence
To fix your residence

Tryna wrestle with being the lesser of
Whatever the lesser get

How could you plant seed and not return for harvest

Moved my family to Hollywood cause the fucking hood is a trap
Imagine me raising my son and he grow up pushing them packs
To be honest nigga, that’d break my fucking heart
My homies never had a fucking start
To be honest, I’m just being honest
Can I be honest? Cause I’m just being honest nigga
To be honest
To be honest they’d rather hit the kitchen like Benihanas
Whip it whip it and keep the semi with em for any drama
Then to make a penny honest to be honest they’ll rob a nigga blind
Let him live to be modest, to be honest these niggas done never helped me
Never liked me or felt me
Want to be in the picture but bitch I’m just taking selfies
To be honest, to be honest, they pray for your expiration
Praise your relationships then they pray for your separation
I pray for your education, paces and dedication
But I don’t owe you shit, not even an explanation
To be honest nigga, to be honest
I’m just being modest nigga, yeah
To be honest, who be on us?
We ain’t falling like you haters truly want us to, we on to you
To be honest you the one you really should be honest to

Oh, let’s be honest, naw ain’t fronting
Wasting all this time talking bout that bullshit
I ain’t really with the cuffing
I’m just trying to be honest
Everything I said I meant, that’s a promise
That’s why [?] for my crew, my niggas stay 100 too
I’m just honest
If we take it to the crib will you give me what I want right now?
Girl you know what I want, no time for them games right now
Girl I know you want next, keep it 100

Honest sometime, you just got to be honest with yourself",To Be Honest,2015

It's a war going on
Yeah, it's a war going on

God told me this movie will write itself
Spread love, be wise and let foolery fight itself

'Cause it's a war going on outside on the corner
It's a war on your TV screen every morning
Not the war with the bombs and the helicopters swarming
But the war for your soul, that's what everyone's ignoring
It's a war going on
Yeah, it's a war going on

(I was just talking to the homie the other day man)

He said I'mma pump this fuckin' caine, pump this fuckin' caine
Hug this block, tote this fuckin' Glock, all you suckas lame
This my spot, this my fuckin' spot, you know what I rep
I go deep on in my way up from a kilo on that step
Tell the death, yeah I mean the death, let that pistol talk
You say truce, me speaking no english, bitch go get some heart
Fuck the law, nigga fuck the law, they can see me too
Fuck a school, and the teacher too, they don't teach the truth
What's a pops, never had a pop, let that ratchet pop
I'm too real, gave a fiend a pill for a Magnavox
Man fuck we got, fuck we really got, but this gutter shit
All my niggas hug the strip and all my bitches love to strip
So suck a dick, I got kids, and a baby mama too
Yeah she work my fucking nerves like a baby mama do
I be stressed, I be hella stressed, smoke a bunch of weed
High for real, pop the pill and drop the Xanny in my lean
I can scream, cause you just smile like everything is fine
Hope is fun, when I grab my gun, come take dear life or mine
Suicide, yeah it's suicide, life is suicide
Fuck your right or wrong, the shit that I been on is do or die
If I do I die, if I don't I die that's suicide
Got the devil with a gun against my brain like choose a side

'Cause it's a war going on outside on the corner
It's a war on your TV screen every morning
Not the war with the bombs and the helicopters swarming
But the war for your soul, that's what everyone's ignoring
It's a war going on
It's a war going on

God told me this movie will write itself
Spread love, be wise and let foolery fight itself

It's a war going on

I love the hood with my whole heart
It whole heartedly been a part of me in my own thought
Process so I digest through my own art
That I'm blessed though I digress due to slow starts
But who else could bring the hood out
And tell 'em when they let God in, it brings the good out
Learn a lesson and listen, my current composition concerns your present condition
And turn direction envision of givin' blessings and wishin' you well
Well wishing and tales fishing
Siftin' through hell's kitchen to find good
Have a God-like mind as the divine should
Define good within yourself I think the time's good
And may these lines live forever like a line should
It's a war going on and your soul fighting
So frightening within you I see thunder and both lightening
Boat striking, snow ice and hail
Your whole life unfold like, cold nights in Hell
In a mode like, you're feeling low like, like you don't like yourself
You got no sight, no insight, no foresight, that's the shit that your foes like
Run up on a nigga get 'em froze like
Put the 4-4 to his foes like
Niggas 'bout to take a pic, trying to get the pose right
Red dot, headshot, hit 'em close like
Like, like all theses niggas I've got to shoot one
Fuck one, plus I'm cocking two guns
Fuck shoe money, I'm coppin' coupes son
No y'all niggas not 'bout to do none
Guns, that's a way of life, get money not God
You got guns, we got bigger guns, go get one and I ride
If I die, they say I went hard, I go super hard
Bitch you with this shits or not? We gon' get this loot or starve?
Fuck you doing? Writin' in a pad, fuck you making songs
What you rappin', boy you know what's happ'nin', that shit take too long
Fuck you mean? Get this fucking cream, get this fucking cream
Hug this block, tote this fucking Glock, can't let these suckers scheme
Shit too real, shit too fucking real, I'm too real to dream
So when it's this cold world won't feel a thing

Lonely days are gone
All them nights to come
Waited to be yours
So let's make love not war
So let the choir sing the let 'em know
So let the choir sing the let 'em know
So let the choir sing the let 'em know

That I'm the motherfucking one to breed them and lead 'em
In a league my own, you ain't even made it up to my throne
You ain't even authorized for this song
Might be best for you to get gone
Best be careful about your tone
That shit can hit me wrong in this song
I have tried my best to be calm
Please don't make me grab that phone
Now who you know who came this fucking far
From the fucking bottom?
30 years in this bitch and I'm still here
Decade after decade
And evidently I must be doing something right
Word to my nigga Eazy

From the other side (Eazy)

It's easy to say you need me
When you got everything you want
But It's hard for me to believe it
You'll find out when I'm gone

I went from hanging out down at the swap meet
To driving some of the hottest cars LA has ever seen
People been telling me I've grown into some kind of monster
But they don't know me though I've been this way since 17
Tryna get finances poppin', man I thought that was the object
To some of my niggas lost they life and then that goes the team
My only dream was holding us down like fuck who tryna stop us
You could get the middle finger or the reddest beam
It's your choice, I took this industry by storm young and black
Killing them softly, don't ever call me fortunate
You don't know what it cost me
So anybody complaining about they circumstances lost me homie
We ain't even talking fuck that energy, fuck up off me

It's easy to say you need me
When you got everything you want
But it's hard for me to believe it
You'll find out when I'm gone

You look at my lifestyle, I'm living my life now
I'm dealing with diligent Benjamin
How come my attitude piped down?
I'm fuckin' with Ice now
I'm fucking with shit you can only get on an oversea flight now
You scare of my heist now
But still I got enemies giving me energy I wanna fight now
Subliminally sent to me all of this hate
I thought I was holding the mic down
I thought I was holding my city up
I thought I was good in the media
You think I'm too hood in my video?
But really no clue you idiot
I just can't help myself
Even when that record spin
Every now and then you hang yourself
Cause I got that green and gold, with a million sold
Like 19 more, from a dollar fit
But without all the diamonds though
To you I'm just another nigga

It's easy to say you need me
When you got everything you want
But It's hard for me to believe it
You'll find out when I'm gone",Darkside/Gone,2015

King Missile,"I remember the last time I donated blood.
The nurse put a bandage on my arm and told me not to remove it for six hours.
The time was five o'clock, and
At about ten to six, 
I was having an early dinner with some friends
In a pretty nice restaurant.
I was embarrassed enough that I had short sleeves on;
The bandage made me look downright silly.
So I removed it slowly,
Surreptitiously,
So no one would see.
Suddenly,
A thin but powerful stream of blood started gushing out of my arm.
It hit a man sitting directly opposite from me,
Splashing off of his head and onto the floor.
A waiter,
Delivering a bowl of chicken noodle soup to a nearby table,
Slipped.
The bowl went flying and landed on my head.
I was completely covered with noodles and I disappeared.
Well, I learned my lesson that day.
And the next time I give blood,
I'll wear long sleeves
And I'll leave the bandage on.",The Blood Song,1988

An expression he detested. 
""There is no rope!"",
He would scream at the laughing walls. 
""There is only the end. 
No hope, no rope. 
Ending is better than mending. 
Doors of perception, windows of opportunity
These are illusions, like the killing floor."" 
Ed spoke in a squeaky whiny voice 
With perhaps a slight tinge of glee, 
But this was only because 
He couldn't be bothered to develop a manner of speaking 
That truly reflected his mood. 
""This is a vacuum. 
There is no air in this room. 
Despair is no fun anymore. 
Nihilism knocked three times on the ceiling, 
But the rosy fingers of dawn always inserted themselves
In the nose of unfulfilled promises. 
Angels sang ""Heysanna, Hosanna"". 
Paralyzed primadonnas danced in the streets all day
But when the darkness came, everybody went home. 
I was ready, everyone else was asleep. 
And while it may have been a relief to see that I was right all along, 
Here I am still, alone and trapped, awaiting the endless end.""
""And I can turn it all around, and laugh at it and laugh at myself 
I can laugh louder than the walls, the halls, the waterfalls, 
Louder than Charles de Gaulle or Fulton Mall, 
But I don't know what I'm laughing at. 
I don't know just what I think is so Goddamn funny. 
I don't know why I don't just shut up and give up and lay down and die. 
What do I have to complain about anyway?"" 
Ed asked his Picasso, ""I'm a millionaire!""
This wasn't actually true. 
Ed's Picasso was an obvious forgery, 
His three Rothko's had just been singled out 
In an article in ""Artforum"" entitled 
""The three most insignificant paintings of Mark Rothko"" 
And his Barbara Krueger's had been irreparably damaged 
By Rein Sanction and a few other bands from Gainsville 
That refused to acknowledge the value of art.

""Come to think of it,"" 
Ed mused to the laminated roadkill coffee table 
That he had purchased when times had seem slightly less bleak, 
""Come to think of it, not only does art have no intrinsic value, 
But my collection has no extrinsic value either. 
I know I'm not a millionaire, but that's no reason to complain. 
There is no reason to complain, there is no reason to do anything. 
I don't believe in reason, objective reality, or collective farming. 
I don't believe in public speaking, which is another reason why I'm here alone. 
I don't believe in life or death. 
I would kill myself, but I don't believe in suicide."" 
Ed put on a red shirt and took a quick walk around the block 
While whistling softly to himself. 
He reentered his apartment screaming. 
""There is no life on this planet! 
Jehovah-One replaced all life with machinery five centuries ago. 
The so-called industrial revolution was just another hoax 
And we all fell for it, 'cause we were all programmed to. 
Even I fell for it, I believe in the steam engine, 
Even though I don't believe in anything. 
Logical inconsistency is the Mr.Bubble I bathe in each and every evening, 
Except yesterday evening, when I roller bladed over to the masonic temple 
To play pinochle with Pope John Paul the First. 
I really had no choice in the matter."" 
Ed certainly could go on and on, 
And he did, and he would, and he will, 
Until you or I or somebody does something about it. 
Senator Sterno of Louisiana announced over closed circuit television. 
""And as long as he continues to pontificate pointlessly, I will do nothing."" 
Ed walked away from the program feeling fortified and stapled. 
His brain was buzzing, the way it always did after watching Jeopardy. 
He loaded up the micro bus with Atlases and Poseidon's and headed for Pope County.
""I've had it!"" he sang. 
""I've had it with puns, alliteration, Russian literature, 
Italian Neo-Realism, meaningless cross references and laundry lists of nonsense.
I shall drive without a license, without clothing, 
Without direction and if I make it to Arkansas fine, 
And if I'm running late, if I'm running a numbers game, it doesn't matter. 
I shall keep on running, yes, this is the answer. 
This is the ending. 
I shall keep running, because a body in motion tends to stay emotional, 
And its better to feel. 
Pain is better than emptiness, emptiness is better than nothing, 
And nothing is better than this.""",Ed,1992

And my penis was missing again.
This happens all the time.
It's detachable.

[Background singing begins: ""detachable penis"" over and over]

This comes in handy a lot of the time.
I can leave it home, when I think it's gonna get me in trouble,
Or I can rent it out, when I don't need it.
But now and then I go to a party, get drunk,

And the next morning I can't for the life of me
Remember what I did with it.
First I looked around my apartment, and I couldn't find it.
So I called up the place where the party was,

They hadn't seen it either.
I asked them to check the medicine cabinet
'Cause for some reason I leave it there sometimes
But not this time.

So I told them if it pops up to let me know.
I called a few people who were at the party,
But they were no help either.
I was starting to get desperate.

I really don't like being without my penis for too long.
It makes me feel like less of a man,
And I really hate having to sit down every time I take a leak.
After a few hours of searching the house,

And calling everyone I could think of,
I was starting to get very depressed,
So I went to the Kiev, and ate breakfast.
Then, as I walked down Second Avenue towards St. Mark's Place,

Where all those people sell used books and other junk on the street,
I saw my penis lying on a blanket
Next to a broken toaster oven.
Some guy was selling it.

I had to buy it off him.
He wanted twenty-two bucks, but I talked him down to seventeen.
I took it home, washed it off,
And put it back on. I was happy again. Complete.

People sometimes tell me I should get it permanently attached,
But I don't know.
Even though sometimes it's a pain in the ass,
I like having a detachable penis.

Personally, I'm more than a little disillusioned with castration. I've used it numerous times as a literary device, and it seems to have lost its punch. I'm sure it isn't the last taboo; no doubt there are endless avenues of violence and depravity for me to explore. I've done child molestation, president-fucking, golden showers – in fact, I believe I helped popularize the phrase ""I'd rather be pissed on than pissed off""! I've written about mass suicides, mass murders, and God help me, Christian masses. I have blasphemed heinously – although, I admit, not nearly as heinously as any major religion, try as I might. Some of the shit I've done with shit would make your shit turn green. I've played with and eaten my own vomit. I have fucked your father's corpse in every available orifice and have punched out a few new ones, and there's not a fucking thing you can do about it, and tomorrow I'll do it again. I've done bad things with relish, and good things with pickles. I regret nothing, I apologize for nothing – but it is all so appallingly pedestrian, and none of it thrills or shocks me anymore. It is so sad. So maybe I should just go back to the flowers and the bunnies and the sunshine and whatnot.",Ennui,2003
King Missile,"Jim is a new character I just thought of today, but I warn you â?? don't get too used to him. Don't try to get to know him, don't try to like him, because I'm gonna kill him. That is what I do. I invent people, and then I kill them.

Jim walks with a limp, but don't worry about it. It doesn't matter that he does, and it doesn't matter why, because he's going to die.

Okay, he was bit by a dog last week, that's why he limps. Okay? And it wasn't his fault at all. Nor is it his fault that he will die. He will die because he had the poor sense to be invented by me. He doesn't deserve to die. He is a nice guy with a lot of friends, and he is helpful and reliable. A lot of people count on him, and they will be sad when he dies in a few moments. And it is too bad for those people. Some of these people will also die, because they count on Jim, and Jim is going to die, and Jim won't be there when they need him, and so they will die too. So it will be a shame for these people. People I also invented. People like Jane, who has no arms. People like Jack, who has lung cancer. People like John â?? not me, a different John â?? who is autistic. Jim is a friend to them all, and he helps them all in countless, invaluable ways. But it doesn't matter. None of it matters. I only bring these things and people up for only two reasons: so that as I write them down, I can think about exactly how Jim will die, and so that his meaningless death will have meaning.

Would you like to know what Jim does for a living? So would I, let's see. Jim is independently wealthy. He â?? he doesn't have to work, but he does anyway. He does volunteer work. He helps out at the cancer ward, and in the section of the hospital where the people who have no arms live. And on the weekends, he works with autistic children like John (not me).

Does Jim have a love life? No. He is too busy and too shy. Does Jim have any pets? No. Are Jim's parents still alive? Yes. It will be tragic for them when Jim dies, maybe of a brain hemorrhage, I haven't decided yet.

Okay, let's do it. This morning Jim was reading the paper. He was reading an article about the Congo, the country formerly known as Zaire, and he was drinking coffee and he spilled the coffee on himself, and it burned, it was very hot, and he jumped out of his chair, and he bumped his head on the wall somehow, and fell out of the window and landed on his bad leg, and limped into the street and got hit by an ambulance and left for dead, but he wasn't dead yet, he was just lying in the curb, and pigeons came along and ate his eyes, and seagulls ripped his stomach out, and pelicans ate his liver, and his spleen popped out all on its own and turned into a harmonica and played a pleasant little tune. Then out came his pancreas, which turned into the dog that bit him last week, and it bit him again and again and again many times.

Jim was writhing in agony, and just then Jack, Jane, and John (not me) walked by. But they didn't recognize him, so they did nothing. They could have saved him, but they were too distracted. They could have saved Jim, but they didn't; they left him dying there. So don't blame me, 'cause I wasn't even there. Jim was killed by his friends, really, because one of them stepped on his face as they walked by, and the other two kicked him â?? by accident, but still, they kicked him â?? one in an exposed part of his brain where a piece of his skull had come off, and the other in the testicles, which technically maybe wasn't a direct cause of death, but it sure didn't help matters any either. Jim recognized his friends, of course, but of course his throat was full of blood, and he was unable to call out their names. This made him unbearably, impossibly sad, and he lost the will to live, right then and there, and just right then, he died.

Did he choke to death on his own blood and vomit? Perhaps. Did he die from the loss of his internal organs? You could say that, maybe. Did he die from the kick in the brain, or from getting hit by the ambulance? Well, look. Causes of death, like meanings of life, are mysterious and ineffable. We can speculate for the rest of the evening if you like, and one can attribute Jim's death to any number of assorted factors, but as for me, I like to think he died of a broken heart.",Jim,2003

My father died in the '80s, but in the '40s he was quite famous. He played in the Negro Leagues. He was the first white man to play in the Negro Leagues. I think originally he played for the Brooklyn Dodgers, but then they traded him to the Kansas City Monarchs in exchange for Jackie Robinson or something like that, I don't know. My father was a modest man, and he didn't like to brag about his accomplishments. And they were very great accomplishments.

For example, in 1965, he came to this country with just a few dollars and started the Hare Krishna religion. I still have a picture of him hanging out in Tompkins, showing the hippies how to chant and be happy. Also, my father was the first, and so far only, man to be born with Fallopian tubes. He had his nipple pierced, and his testicles, and his clitoris â?? he was really cool. He used to work for American Standard, the toilet people, and he did some mail drops for the CIA. He always used to say to me, ""Son, Lyndon Johnson has always been made out of clothespins, but Eisenhower was a cantaloupe and only now is he Episcopalian. Nothing short of sausages and funnels for as long as you both shall live."" He never explained this to me entirely. He never had to.

Speaking of testicles and clitori, about five years after he died, my father wrote a play, and the main characters were named Testicles and Clitorus.

Here is a brief excerpt:

(spoken, with Bradford as Clitorus and Sasha as Testicles)
Clitorus: Hey Testicles, how's it hangin'?
Testicles: Dude.
Clitorus: Dude.
Testicles: Dude, baby boomers suck. 'Cause they're old, and they don't give a fuck about AIDS research, 'cause they're all old and they don't have it, and they don't give a fuck if we all die.
Clitorus: Yeah, but dude, like, at least they support free cheese enemas for the poor.
Testicles: So dude, when are you gonna introduce me to Ella Fitzgerald's underwear and Jerry van Dyke's pancreatic fluids?
Clitorus: Well, dude, when are you gonna bake me that delicious blueberry fetus pie you've been promising me?

Anyway â?? it went on from there. It was never produced, but Desi Arnaz bought the film rights for Paramount, and I put my share of the inheritance into mutual funds, which I parlayed into a sizable fortune, which I then spent on Q-tips and hydrogen peroxide for the Church of Hal, because I could never really get into my father's religion, dressing up in orange and jumping up and down and chanting all the time â??

Sunny, thank you for the truth you've let me see
Sunny, thank you for the facts from A to Z

Steals across the meadows of my heart

Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

Watch the gangsta haters close 'cause they worse than dope fiends

Cause I'ma make things get better for me

To supply you wit what you need, no room for greed
Better go around and when it come to you
Don't bite off more than you can chew

Game is life, life is struggle
Without the coastal juggle
So if you drop I test that, fragile as a crsytal

See I'm vicious like hell, got em waggin they tail

On the receiver, go get it like a retriever
I want em close enough so I can lock on em

Check this out here man, I lick em, sick em

I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

This bigger than money, this bigger than fame
Remember everything that I did to get where I'm at
Please don't take it from me
Said I wouldn't change
I'm still the same, and they love it
You can hate me or love me
But I bet you remember, I bet you remember
Remember my name

They never remember
I did time for a gun, that I never remember
Did time with my son been delivered
I cried tears, I couldn't show 'em my position
No sleep in the hallways
Me being me, sipping lean with a .30 like always
Couldn't afford Trues, now I sleep on Versace and Balmain
Danny had the streets on lock so
Still slept with the rats and the cockroaches
Lost niggas, I lost bitches, I lost time
But I'm back on the block though
Gang with me also, but it's bigger than money
End counts all I know
They say I won't make it
Now they favor, I got 20 to play with
Grew up on Chicago South Side, where you get killed if you outside
And I made it out, and I'm outside
Name hold weight like a motherfucker
And I love my niggas like blood brothers
Same niggas, same gang can't change on 'em
One time, no movie
But I bet that clip gon' hang though

Don't forget about me

But I bet you remember, I bet you remember
Remember my name

Real street nigga, made it from the bottom
Coming up as a kid niggas gave him nothing
12 years old knew I was a problem
All I wanted was money and the fame
Cars, cribs, and bitches wouldn't name
I can't change for nothing in this world
Lord blessed me two boys and a girl
Two dead 'cause I lost to this world
Crossed over like Flo Rida
Only my squad they both sliding
Money and power they both riding
Caught him and him and they both sliding
Trap house, block party, niggas doing the same shit
And got nothing
And niggas try me and that Mac bust
And they remember my name

Don't forget about me
This bigger than money, this bigger than fame
Remember everything that I did to get where I'm at

Your bitch on my dick and she giving me play
Savage nigga, like to play with them things
He got a big missile, and he aiming for brains
I don’t trust niggas, all them niggas fugazi
I don’t shop on a budget, I’m just getting the cake
My niggas fucked up the cake
They do anything, they switching them lanes
I stay with Scottie Pippen
Leave your body limpin’ when I find that you fucked with the Jakes
Pass me the K, bullets put face on the pave
Chopper put niggas in graves
Bullets put face on the pave

There was a Buffalo Soldier
In the heart of America
Stolen from Africa, brought to America
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival

I mean it, when I analyze the stench
To me, it makes a lot of sense
How the Dreadlock Rasta was the Buffalo Soldier
And he was taken from Africa, brought to America
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival

Said he was a Buffalo Soldier, Dreadlock Rasta
Buffalo Soldier, in the heart of America

If you know your history
Then you would know where you coming from
Then you wouldn't have to ask me
Who the heck do I think I am

I'm just a Buffalo Soldier
In the heart of America
Stolen from Africa, brought to America
Said he was fighting on arrival
Fighting for survival
Said he was a Buffalo Soldier
Win the war for America

Thank ya'll for coming out to the wise underground club
Our first act up
All the way from Memphis, Tennesse
Show him some southern love
JT and the Tennessee Kids
Come on! Give it up!

Thank you for having us out tonight
We're JT and the Tennessee Kids

Mmm, yeah yeah yeah
Think I'm in love with you

Didn't have to run, I knew it was love from a mile away
But I had to catch you, running through my mind all day baby
They all say I'm crazy, cause anybody even when your father say
That I can't be with you, I don't hear what they say

Cause I'm in love with that girl
So don't be mad at me
Cause I'm in love with that girl
So don't be mad at me
So what you're from the other side of the tracks
So what if the world don't think we match
I'll put it down like my love's on wax, guess what
I'm in love with that girl
And she told me, she's in love with me

Now we didn't have to fall, but fell in love to the bottom babe
No one's there to catch us when we fell from heaven that day
People always staring, but I don't care nothing about it babe
Since I saw your face, I've been staring just the same

I'm in love with that girl
So don't be mad at me
Cause I'm in love with that girl
So don't be mad at me
So what you're from the other side of the tracks
So what if the world don't think we match
I'll put it down like my love's on wax, guess what
I'm in love with that girl
And she told me, she's in love with me

My pretty lady
You'll always be my baby, baby, baby
It's so amazing
How you became my baby, baby, baby
My little daisy
Come here let me rock you like a baby, baby, baby
Pretty lady
Don't you know, you'll always be my baby, baby, baby

Now don't it seem like these days
That everybody's got something to say
But I don't pay attention to the talk baby
And I don't really care if they stop and stare
Because they see my number one
My number one girl

I told you I'm in love with that girl
So don't be mad at me
I'm in love with that girl
So don't be mad at me
I don't care
So what you're from the other side of the tracks
So what if the world don't think we match
I'll put it down like my love's on wax, guess what
I'm in love with that girl
She already told me, that she's in love with me

The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart

And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Hey Jude, don't make it bad

King Sun,"I make real fat tapes, and I like the sound
Sayin' lines from the mind, never writin' em down
Though a talent I have had for quite some time
Not everybody enjoys a good rhyme
I couldn't care less for anyone else
Put a rhyme on a tape and listen to it myself
If something is wrong, I gotta erase
I think of something much fatter, and then I replace
I see it as a deed, done for reward
My voice with a beat makes you want to record
King Sun with the sounds you could never escape
Every time you turn around, you hear another fat tape

I went downtown, to buy a fat box
Everything was included, so the tape could rock
Had dual cassette with the auto reverse
Made sure that I had the fat tape first
When I looked in my bag, cold had a fit
Couldn't find one tape with hardcore 
I was so upset, and ready to get ill
Then I thought about a kid who lived up the hill
I went to his house to get my tape
He was playin' the jams from the fire escape
I told him that I needed my tape today
He said to tell it to the people in the alleyway
Who are havin' a party, but it had to halt
Pass of my tape, and it ain't my fault
Went back for the box I came to get
Bought new batteries for the fat cassette
Godfather of Rock, the one with the box
Playin' 24 hours around my block
Some people okay, but I'm in good shape
It cost 5.99 for a fat tape

Bust the rhythm & blues, here's good news
For those of you that love the hip-hop
Continuous beats play through the streets
And the good news is that it will not stop
(Check this out)
It's contagious, like a bad disease
Attracts many people like a dog does fleas
Though it pumps as this party jumps for only 1 MC
I am the activator, sole creator
Down with the man who rocks the crossfader
Back and forth, to move south and north
And to increase at such a level, and I can go off
Slow or fast, yet to get faster
Capability equivalent to the masters
Knowledge known, wise words to be spoken
Record what I'm sayin' if your deck is not broken

Maestro, I conduct, make mega bucks
And this tape will certainly self-destruct
No mission's impossible, I'm unstoppable
Afford to record on tapes that are droppable
Various beats that rock the street
King Sun who you anticipated to meet
My tape will sore to unlimited heights
Contract of insurance in case you might bite
Put a tape in a box, start walkin' around
No need to rewind or turn the tape down
Turn it up past 10 and have no fear
You are playin' one of many fat jams to hear
In the winter or the summer, or any time
Nothin' is recorded over none of my rhyme
Soundwave static, no interference
People applaud by the sight of my appearance
No top hat, Tuxedo or cape
Just me on the m-I-see and a fat tape

Some tapes are heavy, and I mean fat
I record in a level above the hi-hat
Bass drum plants fear into your ear
With the help of the snare it will ruin your gear
Rippin' off your clothes from your head to your toes
Idolize the sound that many people have chose
Sound so live, you would think I'm in it
So much pleasure on a 60 minute
Cassette, to eject shows disrespect
Bustin' out a 90 minute full of hi-fi 
Technology induced, well givin' a boost
I get loose, and I do it for a musical use
Not done for the money, or to impress
I do it, because this is what I do best
King Sun is the one, fruitier than a grape
Everytime you turn around, you hear another fat tape

Bust the fat tape

And the Co-Pro Brothers",Fat Tape,1989

The kind that bite you if you're not awake
Not the reptile, the cold bloody wild
Walkin', talkin' with the human lifestyle
The kind that lie, cheat, and do wrong

Without any trace they vacate the place

I was the one who got caught and dropped dime on Red
Cause you got the fellas mad as can be
Money, I'ma get you before they get me
See, I'm not the rat who bites the cheese
Cause I can do a three year's bid with ease
Please, you heard wrong from what I know
Because I wasn't even caught by five-o
Now who would assume Sunborn is a rat?
The same one who said I wasn't right 'n exact
For you are the one, you let your tongue run loose
You try to set me up, so you can have my juice
My name is seven letters, my shoes are too big
It's burrial time, and you will help me dig
Your grave, now be brave, there's no time to waste
The snake is the one who I shot in the face

He denied before I asked him, so he was the fake flake

Devilish (snakes) the venomous (snakes)
Once you are bitten, that's all it takes

One of my girls found out about the other one
I just killed a snake, now I gotta kill another one
Could haven been a male or female who told
My girl they seen another girl wearin' my gold
Now she knows everything that I don't even know
She gave me a list of every place we go
Together, I say 'whatever', it can't be denied
Just because I never told, doesn't mean I lied
Now I gotta 'fess up and tell the truth
She even knows about the phone calls at the phone booth
Damn, who's the little fork-tongued critter?
Who told her I knocked the boots of the baby sitter
She won't say who she heard quotin'
Just keep talkin' while my gun is bein' loaded
It might be a friend who's really a foe
But say no more, love, I think I know
Who the culprit is, you canivin' swine
Can't be me, so you want to have mine
Guess who is guilty of such perpetration

A snake is a snake
Cause they're phony and fake
Devious (snakes) the wicked (snakes)
And once you are bitten, that's all it takes

The city streets are full of deceit
The same negativity must repeat
It's goin' on and on, and not about to stop
Snakes are criminals, snakes are cops
Out even in the White House, without a doubt
Find a snake, and let's cast them out
Slippin', slidin', duckin', hidin'
Buy a new car and go snake-ridin'
I guess now you snakes are very angry
Cause I'm black, white, you want to hang me
I see the ropes, and I'm no dope

Can you fool me? Nope

King Sun,"Have any of you ever been to Africa,
Back to the motherland? It's somethin'

All these lovely brothers and sisters
The subject at hand is about your own people
The poison animal eaters, slaves of a mental death in power
And our next speaker, well we know who he is

This is not a rhyme about the racial times
And if you don't want to hear it then pay it no mind
What I'm about to say may get you all upset
So I apologize and the wise don't sweat
The matter at hand is toward the black
That live a falsehood life and that's no way to act
You don't wear gold because you can't afford it
The medallion was cheap, so you went out and bought it
From a Chinese man, or some Korean fella
I bet you think your money went to help Mandela
Oh really, has the past been forgotten?
Dressin' how they used to in the days of pickin' cotton
Martin Luther King did a lot for us
But today it's cool to play the back of the bus
I study one twenty, I'm right and exact
So I think I should reveal what it is to be black

Now everybody's wearin' the red black and green
Here's the point, do you know what it means?
Red for the bloodshed, black for the people
Green for the land to be utilized equal
""Yo I'm from Africa"" boy you're just a faker
Name one city ""Uhh, Jamaica!""
Wrong, and I think that's a shame
An African look with an American name
You might fool others but you can't fool Sun
Want to build with the brother, then I am the one
Play connect the dots, all the way to the motherland
What have you done for your nation my brother man
You can't even do the right things for self
Then you got the nerve to criticize somebody else
If it wasn't for Chuck you wouldn't know of Farrakhan
I understand that the man is a paragon
Open up your eyes and ears and try to learn
Stop perpetratin' with your false concern
Even some rappers, frontin' in their videos
Nothing but Oreos, tryin' to be memorial
I'm not impressed, by the way some stars
perpetrate to be original, you know who you are
I diss my people who choose to lack
'Cause there's more to learn on how to be black

And then they say I'm prejudiced, cause I like red bones
But nowadays original girls are headstrong
Not as a whole, but the majority I know
Are too busy frontin' yo, tryin' to be fly though
You might hear this and think I'm trippin'
But knowledge the wisdom before you start flippin'
As modern day God, I do analysis
To find out what makes them hard like callouses
Instead of being sweat, truthful and soft
They want to be false and that turns me off
Your hair's not real, neither are your eyes
And your makeup is swine plus a big disguise
Your clothes are tight, I can see every inch
And then you wonder how I get this urge to pinch
Sellin' your sex, without makin' love
I'm not Keith to be Sweat-in you and that's unheard of
If I got dollars, I'm good for your number
If I look fine, I get a one night slumber
Wham, bam, but no thank you ma'am
Want to knock the boots but you don't know who I am
This is not a diss to my black sista
If I screamed on ya daughter, pardon me mista
The point I'm makin', such a visual fact
Teach her to be original, and how to be black

Groove to this
Move to this

I know you're probably mad and would like to roast me
But get yourself together, before you approach me
'Cause I'm no sucka, I say what I feel
I might hurt your feelings, but at least I'm real
The way to be black is to strive for goals
You're no longer the people who was bought and sold
My advice to you is a word to the wise
Snap out of the negative, into the civilized
This place around you was meant to down you
Kings and Queens but yet they still won't crown
Sun Born Allah has a goal no doubt if you're black
and you're proud you better live that out",Be Black,1990

Once upon a time there was a big diesel kid
Who just got sprung from a 10 year bid
10 years is a long time, he left as a pup
But came out as an adult, about to act up
Out on the block he played the average street games
Gamblin, scramblin, just to build up a name
Pumped a few pockets, he got on the spot
Not until he bought a Benz did his name get hot
Out on the streets slingin big rocks on concrete
Those who tried to play him, they cold got beat
I mean cold, you dissed him and you just got smoked
Then he'd take your spot and leave your family broke
Even five-o was petro and wouldn't even act up
To give him a ticket, they'd have to call in for back-up
That's how extra and large the boy got
Just gettin started in the game of a big shot

	(Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie)

[ VERSE 2 ]
It only took two years for all of this to occur
He met a light-skinned squally and flipped over her
She was dope alright, but the girl was so young
Her eyes was so lovely that money was strung
This kid was 23 and the girl 16
See, another street king had now found his queen
And he was runnin things, puttin others in fear
Makin 20 g's a week, and that's a million a year
Steppin out to the club with his girl in a mink
Wearin custom-made jewels and big fat links
Go upstairs where his place would be set
With the choice of Dom Perrignon or Moët
Four soldiers undercover loungin with his brother
Everybody strapped with a vest and a rubber
Just in case somebody's girl got hot
But she was bagged and ragged in the club by a big shot

Extra large

[ VERSE 3 ]
Spots from the east to the westside he ran
If money was power, then this kid was He-Man
Never again would homeboy go thirsty
Cause he bought a mansion in Patterson New Jersey
The house that was owned by Lou Castello
At the age of 25 life was so mellow
A father of 4, each had different mothers
That's to my knowledge, might have had others
Nothin could go wrong, the world was his
Until one day somebody gave him a quiz
To see if he was thorough or just a front
A kid pulled out and got smoked like a blunt
The brother knew how to react on impact
Bust him in the shoulders, opened up his back
Three more to go, what was four deep
Who were sent on a mission to put him to sleep
He dipped in a Benz, bein pursued by a van
Picked up the cellular phone to call his man
They strapped up and loaded up in the trucks
With A.K.'s, nines and Uzis, ready to buck
Now homebody was doin like 100 quick
Down the block cold jettin and not sweatin conflict
Bullets were flyin from the van behind him
His boys were rollin, but they couldn't find him
The city was large, and they had to think fast
He had on a vest, but what if he crashed?
The brother made a right, and what happens then?
A big yellow sign that read 'dead end'
Now he could give his soul to the essence to keep
All of a sudden there were shots from a black jeep
It was his young girl who met him at the spot
Cause she was always taught first hand from a big shot

[ VERSE 4 ]
19 year old female was so bold
Her and the homegirls always had ammo
The brothers in the van just kept on firin
Deep in the background the sounds of sirens
The kid in the Benz, got out and got shot
Caught two in the leg, and the leg was real hot
He fell to the ground with no strength to run
The clip was empty in his automatic gun
The girl in the jeep had blocked off the street
Tryin to save a big shot from defeat
Crazy gunfire last for a while
But then came the trucks with the Bigfoot style
A.K.'s and Uzis weighed more than tons
Killed the three brothers that tried to run
The ones who lived were arrrested by the cops
But the charges were dropped, the judges were paid by big shots

[ VERSE 5 ]
Listen, it's not hard to take charge
Life of a big shot is extra large
Strictly do or die, makin moves direct
Cause a big shot will always get just due respect
>From east to west coast, mainly minorities
Make enough money to buy the authorities
Dollars are chill when the women are real hot
So no matter what, you'll always remember a big shot",Big Shots,1990

Killin MC's with a lyrical death kick
Laid-back in the track like a cantor
Wonderin what they want to quote 'word is bond' for
When they can't quote the power of god degree
They must want to be down universally
In that case, I'm ready to start punishin
With many stripes I snipe you so astonishin
I leave a shine on your mind like a pledge
Push you off the edge if you don't know the ledge
As in the first step towards righteous
You look a bit hungry, please, don't try to bite this
Duplication will result in a violation

When I resign, there could never be another Sun
Anyone could be the king, even a dog
But when I hear 'Sunborn', I leap like a frog
And you're the lillypath, you must be silly mad
I'm so rough, that when I'm good, I'm really bad
How many rappers does it take to beat me?
Well, I don't know, cause they're afraid to meet me
Some try to greet me, and then try to diss me
Behind my back when their girls can't resist me
It's only right that I get my props
Cause I drop hip-hop freestyles non-stop
This is comin from the east coast shore line
Your mother was on mine as soon as she saw mine
Tell your sister I said to stop hawkin
I never flirt with dirt, cause I'm just cold New Yorkin

I call upon your attention, the extension is a live one
With the energy comin from a live Sun
As in Sun Born, the Universal
To get like me, it takes too much rehearsal
I'm comin at you from every direction
Forget about cryin out police protection
Even five-o know about the death blow
Not the kind you find in a line, so
The only freeze you receive is a cold
Current that gives you goose bumps when I roll
Those who weren't aware were caught out there
Left to rot in the middle of nowhere
This proves that I'm out for the real thing
Whether buildin or rhymin I'm the real King
I visualize the snake as an enemy
As I radiate thought I let off pure energy

The fun has just begun
And the name of the game is let's see who can step to King Sun
Sounds like nothin but somethin to do
Visualize your condition when I get through with you
Dragged and ragged and put away in a body bag
The mic stuck up in your mouth like a dog tag
Tell the truth, you're afraid to come near me
I can see it in your eyes, you fear me
How you're gonna go against a pit and you're a poodle
I bust your whole kitten kaboodle
You're doodoo and got a booty identity
Another loss in the sauce, victim of pure energy

Have you not heard that your word shall be bond
You're wicked and weak, so I don't speak to warn
A perpetrator or false advacator
Now is the time to build and not later

Only amonst the punks you got juice
For you to be hard you gotta get souped up
You want to lock with the god, put your dukes up

They don't want none
(Come on)
They don't want none
(Come on)
I know you don't want none
(Come on)
Cause you're soft
I knew you wasn't fit to take the hit
And this is only a little bit of some of the good shit
The rest is better, every word, phrase and letter
A sworn vendetta to all those who said a
Little too much and touched a nerve
The only thing you deserve is the justice I serve
Severely, and I make you pay dearly
Play me like a ( ? ) then I really
Come out to get you, find you and wet you
Met your girlfriend forget she met you
You against me, come on, that's a no-win
You must be drunk off Cisco and slow gin
When I'm fightin it's Clash of the Titan
Thunder and lightnin, you're frightened by what I'm writin
You wonder how come my records ain't sellin
Cause I won't sell out to the pit you fell in
I'm too wise like a bag of chips when I flip

I still ""Heat Up"" ""Snakes"" till it's ""Time to Go""

To diss me, but you missed me, and that didn't please me
A song and dance doesn't give you a chance to advance
I think you better go home and enhance
Your lyrical skills on the real, you can't swing
On the devine, be off mine, picture the King
Bein all up in the open, hopin you could step to
I be a monkey's uncle, and you're my nephew
Climbin on my back while I'm flowin with the tracks
Tryin to learn how to burn - this is what you lack
Air, gas and energy, greater than Con Edison
Fuel into infinity with pure solar medicine
I know what time it is, I clock it on the Sun dial
Chumps are beaten, tied up and dragged for miles
I'm so foul, that at times I'm bad news
Battle me and lose, you win a pair of shoes
Made of concrete, there's somethin sweet about that
To match your dead man suit and your dead man's hat
When it's right I deliver, at the bottom of the river
You'll be found, gagged and bound, with no liver

Then you can pop shit while your teeth are fallin out
I throw joints to score points at war
Once more I make sure you leave through the door
On a stretcher, I betcha your concussions are rushin frequent
Blow for blow my k.o.'s have been a sequence
Step up of step off, the choice is yours
There's always room for one more on the floor
You lay down and stay down, until the full count to 10
Unanymous decision - I win

I was gonna let you slide, but I decided not to
Don't even try to run, cause I got you
Trapped like a rat, your tail bein squeezed
In the trap I set, caught you goin for the cheese
Sayin please doesn't mean you're released from the scene of the crime
Tryin to step to me with your bullshit rhymes
You practice in a daily rehearsal
I'm universal, dramatic or commercial
One thing to say about the King is worth big money
Dig, money, I master 120
Okay, you got a gun, now I'm supposed to be afraid?
You pull the trigger, I pull the pin to the grenade
If you catch me in a chest, bust, I'm in a vest
You'll be blown to the zone of your perpetual rest
Don't ever try to take me out the box again

Count your heads, cause your boys just fled

Always waggin her tail and on all fours

Every now and then she might spend
Sometime with another female's boyfriend
Why? I don't know, maybe for fun

Got to your house, went around the back
You had on a night gown with nothin underneath that
Took me in your room, hung up my coat
Asked me if I want to play _Love Boat_
""Yeah, how do you play it, remember?"", I said
Then you pushed me into your waterbed
Raised my sail, squabbed the deck
Came up and put a hickey on the side of her neck
Worked me over and got undressed
Sent me home and said I needed to rest
I went on the ave., weak as a mouse
Build wasn't out there, he was at your house
Stayed for an hour, then he left

Hour by hour, minute by minute

Sharing a secret life so undiscovered
I sneak to meet such a girl so sweet
As we make love between satin sheets
The time we spend as nothing more than friends
You see me with my girl, I wink and you grin
We can't be together or showing a sign
Because you're with your man but I'm on your mind

The way we meet and go some place to eat
I wine you and dine you and hold your hand

People started rumors from the time they've seen us
Holding hands, smiling at each other

A certain part of you belongs to me
The part that is soft, tender and sweet
That starts from the beautiful hair on your head
On down to the pretty little toes on your feet
Love me tender, female agenda
To your secret love I surrender

To last through forever and another day 
Just as time knew to move on since the beginning 
And the seasons know exactly when to change 
Just as kindness knows no shame 
Know through all your joy and pain 
That I'll be loving you always 
As today I know I'm living but tomorrow 
Could make me the past but that I mustn't fear 
For I'll know deep in my mind 
The love of me I've left behind Cause I'll be loving you always 

Until the day is night and night becomes the day, always
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away, always
Until the day that 8x8x8 is 4, always
Until the day that is the day that are no more 
Did you know that you're loved by somebody? 
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left, always
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself 
I'll be loving you forever 
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through, always
Until the day that you are me and I am you, always
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Always

We all know sometimes life's hates and troubles 
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space 
But you can bet you life times that and twice its double 
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed 
so make sure when you say you're in it but not of it 
You're not helping to make this earth a place sometimes called Hell 
Change your words into truths and then change that truth into love 
And maybe our children's grandchildren 
And their great-great grandchildren will tell 
I'll be loving you 

Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky, loving you 
Until the ocean covers every mountain high, loving you 
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea, loving you 
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream, be loving you 
Until the day is night and night becomes the day, loving you 
Until the trees and seas up, up and fly away, loving you 
Until the day that 8x8x8x8 is 4--Loving you

King Sunny Ade & His African Beats,"As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving 
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May 
Just as hate knows love's the cure 
You can rest your mind assure 
That I'll be loving you always

But in passing will grow older every day 
Just as all is born is new 
Do know what I say is true

Straight West Coast nigga, ain't no pity
Put holes in niggas, real pretty
Real shitty like a black Frank Nitty
I give drugs to the thugs price-free
Handed down the game by that nigga Ice-T
No doubt players like me
Recognize the great King Tee, about twenty grand a ki
Ah, that's that G shit, no doubt about that
Statutory lyrics is how I rape the rap
And get your niggas off my back
And no, GOD, ya don't pull a strap, 'cause (*gun shot*) FUCK THAT!
I'm very precise when I shoot
Straight out the roof of my Lexus coupe
Ya want to blame Tha Alkaholik group
But, naw, that nigga Tela must've hit the loot
'cause he's actin real loonie
And I don't give a fuck cause I'm drunk and I'm a G like Spoonie
The hoodrats want to do me
So if you've got'cha county cheque give it to me

Huh, so I guess I earned the title 'OG'
Been down for ten years, this my fifth Lp
I'ma get this one easy
A real motherfuckin G, are-rock Tee
Now all these fools talkin 'bout they some killers
Car stealers, big time drug dealers
Bitch ass niggas keep it real, don't lie
You ain't killin shit and they gon' let shit die
You ask ""Who the hell am I?""
They call me 'Big Bone' and on my worst night I fades em all
And I come through ya hood like a locc ass G
Rip any fool that calls hisself an MC
It's only one way, let's have gun play
I make it play, nigga, fuck what you got to say
I got a mad crew of murderers, ex-burglars
Puttin soft niggas outta service

Strapped with the bulletproof vest in the front and back Regal
Smokin that sticky green grass
Hittin switches, bumpin on cuts from the past
We smoke leaf 'cause we live like G's
Super-soft niggas become enemies
I hit a lick on the East for ten ki's
Now everything I drive is on Deez
I'ma make you believe, I gotta put it down like a real nigga should
My dope spot in every nigga's hood
I don't waste time, I need to get what's mine
Fourteen shells from behind
Leave you in the blind, str-8 paralysed from ya spine
A partner of organised crime
Ya hear it all the time but now ya gotta hear it from the truth
Til my nigga Karl Phat's respect due

Xzibit rates the state 
Cross me or cause me, fuck jiggy and flossy 
I'm tryin to keep the government off me 
Dodgin hard time and house arrest 

Whatta you expect, findin' what ya never forget 
'Cause you're sellin wolf tickets that your ass can't pay 
What I display, skill last found in Cassius Clay 
In this prime time, hustle for mine 

Used to nickel and dime 
Doin felony crime, but now I bust mine 
Instead of bustin' at enemies when the sun go down 
Me and my niggas with a fat one 

Smoke 'em all down to nothing 
Crushin rappers, bare Witness like Jehovah 
Swore we haven't been sober 
Since 21 and over

I get conceptions to make the microphones explode

So I blocks it, pull they whole set out the socket

(West West y'all)
Yeah, L.A. niggas
L.A. niggas rule the world nigga
Y'all niggas gotta recognize, yaknahmsayin?
Niggas don't wanna peep game, yaknahmsayin?
But this shit come all the way back around here
My nigga Dre, droppin' heat box on y'all bitch-ass
Yaknahmsayin? You gotta recognize
L.A. niggas, connected all over the motherfucking world, nigga
Recognize this; peep game

Now in my younger days I used to sport a rag
Backpack full of cans plus a four-four mag
G'd up from the feet up
Blue'd up from the shoe up's how I grew up
Loc'n, smokin' and drinkin' til we threw up (threw up)
At Leimert Park, taggin', hittin' fools up
Ditching my class, just to fuck yo' school up
You don't wanna blast, nigga tuck yo' tool up
But don't sleep, y'all niggas quick to shoot you
Now there's another motherfucker with no future
But Time Bomb much smoother when I maneuver, dope like Cuba
Got em jumpin Disciples to the Hoover

I'm coming ""Straight Outta Compton"" with a loose cannon
Smoke big green, call it Bruce Banner
Watch your manners, at last another blast from the top notch
From way back with the pop rocks, I pop lock witcha
Picture this, Dr. Dre twisting wit Tha Liks
And Hittman bought a fix
Don't trip, it's a Time Bomb in this bitch
Here it tick tick tick tick {*BOOM*}
Wait a minute it's on, I tell it like a true mackadelic
Weed and cocaine sold separate, check it
From sundown to sunup -- clown and run up
The Aftermath'll be two in your gut, nigga what?

We roll deep, smoke on weed drink and pack heat
Requirements for survival each day in L.A.!
It don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops
Analyze why we act this way in L.A.!

Gimme that mic fool, it's a West coast jack move
They call me Hitt cause I spit like gats do
Cock me back
Bust caps for my max crew, at Fairfax
Who used to wear Air Max shoes, that's true
But I grew up where niggas jack you, harass you
Blast you, for that set you claim (where you from?)
Mash on you for your Turkish chain, C.K. B.K
Blue'd up or flame, I ran wit a gang
I helped niggas get, jacked for they Dana Dane's
My pants hang below my waistline
I look humble wanna rumble? (yeah yeah)
I bang though, like Vince Carter from the baseline
Don't waste my time
Fuck a scrap in killa Cali, AK's and 9's
One-time's, sun-shines, and fine-ass bitches
Hawaiian Thai, drive-bys, six-fo's on switches

I was raised in the hood called WHAT-THE-DIF'
Where the brothers in the hood, refused to go Hollywood
Slugs for the fuck of it
Anybody hatin' on us can suck a dick
If I catch you touching mine you catch a flat-line, dead on the floor
Better than yours, driving away gettin' head from a whore
It's AvireX-to-the-Z
Fuckin' with me might get you banned from TV
Cassette and CD it's all mine the whole nine the right time
Multiply, we don't die, the streets don't lie
What, so neither do I, I'm bad for your health
Like puttin' a pistol up to your face and blastin' yourself

Five in the mornin', burglars at my do'
Glock forty-five in my dresser drawer
Let 'em come in BLAOW he see the thunder roll
Roll with niggas, who buy fifths by the fo'
And brew's by the case
SLAP YOU in the face with the bass, Dr. Dre laced
Likwit Kings wit Sedans and gold rings
Haters fold the style, but can't find no openings

We roll deep, smoke on weed drink and pack heat
Requirements for survival each day in L.A.!
It don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops
Analyze why we act this way in L.A.!

So roll shit up, if you got a sack of that good
Have you trippin' like some sherm when we bounce through yo' hood
We make it happen, from the nickel plate to the platinum
It's real shit, think of it, just musical rappin'

Now ain't no mercy when we dealin' with these putos
Ask the homey Kurupt, he said the feelin' is mutual
We lay em down on site, on GP
Hit em up for la raza and for DPG

I got a cannon for the bustas, fuck the world
Gangstas and cascades, perms and curls

Impalas, drops and pop collars

Keep control... 



(Tradegy the Intelligent Hoodlum) 

When I made arrest the president  America ate me 

Spoke the truth that the gov't hates me 

They labeled me a prejudice poet 

I'm speaking the truth as I know it 

I hold on but it's hard for me to handle 

Too much lies  corruption and scandal 

Cops want to kill a brother or two 

Who do you call when the gang wears blue 

I ain't going out like an Uncle Tom man 

My gun is loaded and I'm itching to pull the trigger 

I'm marking for death as a funky rhyme sayer 

Corruption flows from the cops to the mayor 

Mali troops will run through your resident 

In my hand will be the head of your president 

All you fess that made a check to throwdown 

Will rise up for a political showdown

Yo, King Tee stepping in on a dark tip 

Open your eyes and your mind and get a grip 

Of the ropes and chains that kept us 

Since we were black they didn't want to except us 

But it's ok, I got my own plan 

'Cause yo, I ain't down wit your program 

The natives cook, wash and clean 

And to the rubbers that throw in the scene 

M-A-N-D-E-L-A 

Now you got a chance to hear what he say 

Since they kept him locked up for so long 

'Cause his skin was black and his mind was strong 

But we need to all stand together though 

And let the red, black and green show 

Become aware of yourself before it gets too late

Hon living lovely, Miss Gouchi 

Even got a Benz when she drives around wit all her friends 

Ugn, miss quick fast in a heedy 

Speedy, speedy, speedy, the bitch is greedy 

Spend so fast, she got caught wit 4 kids 

And the man caught a nice thick bitch 

Now the bitch is on skid 

Screaming how she hates her kids 

The move for the bitch is a thing quick and easy 

Think slick, she better get wit the wick 

'Cause foul, foul, foul is your style

And ever, sever make it endever 

To enlight your brother when 

I recommend to extend a hand 

Expand it then wish strength to fend 

Black women and men from the white power structure 

They stucked ya in, stoled your culture and fuked ya 

And you gave birth to a nation 

You freelabel laid America's economic foundation 

Blood, sweat and tears and fear for years 

But now here was a peer to give you shift in the gears 

The turn of the tables, knowledge and ables 

Us to escape the sterotype wit the labels 

And years of classroom fables, fiction 

Fallacies all sorts and fabrications

I know this 11 year old kid named Jeffery Cowen 

And knowing his father slowing 

And his mother is hoeing 

And now should he be growing 

He's too young to be sewing 

he should just chill and be flowing 

I know he was being malested and sold 

And his mom for being infected 

Never check it, so I invested 

My time and made sure little bro was looked at 

Pops got evicted, not a smack 

Pumped his fists and being that I'm a ?fugiless? 

The bum got done by the one 

And little Jeffery, no more tears left and drip 

Mixed wit seaman on his lip, emotional trip 

It confuses and bent ill thoughts 

In the soul of the youngster 

Is daddy a monster 

That raw creates lip songs and heartache pain 

Drys and open your eyes for the insane

Wherever my crew go, same old scenario
Takin' over every show, rockin' on the radio-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

It's Tha Liks you know our repertoire, we party y'all
We treat every day like it's fuckin' Mardi Gras (y'know)
Y'all done started somethin' you just can't finish
Ten years deep in this game called rap business
We takin' hip-hop back, it's gettin' unbearable
Y'all done disrespected the game somethin' terrible
My Likwid Crew shower you, with rhymes that's incomparable
Beats so ridiculous it just ain't fair to you
We act stupid off the tonic and whiskey
Smoke so much weed you might think I'm a hippie
In the club drunk with my nigga King Tipsy
Lookin' for some hoes that we can toss like frisbies
Bail through the club belligerent like, ""Bitch Please"" (damn)
Tab at the bar is already like six G's
Everywhere we go, I roll with the same old gang
Doin' the same old thang, again and again

[Chorus]

Niggas know (y'all niggas know) 
On your marks get wet, three vets is on the set
It's nine years in the game and we ain't lost a step yet
We still in full effect with drunk rhymes that make the world spin
(While you starin at me nigga) Nigga, I'm starin' at your girlfriend
Women see us out and think my click is too obnoxious
Cause we bail around the party like we off a couple notches

We off a couple vodkas, home girl, we Likwid niggas
Take the time to get to blow us, tell yo' friends come kick it with us
Ha ha, all jokes aside, we slide slippers
Money fallin' out my pocket like I robbed nine strippers
Tash is, ""Animal House"" like Jon Belushi
I'll be drinkin all the sake while you eatin' all the sushi (damn)
(Whattup nigga?) It's still the same situation
Tha Liks be gettin' head from the same bitch you datin'
Ratin us a 9'll be a waste of your time
We tens with big ends so let the games begin (y'know)

[Chorus]

Niggas know y'all niggas know 
Niggas know y'all niggas know 

Yeah, yeah!
Imperialistic without doubt, the King'll blast your character out
So stop playin with it, you fadin in it
I stay with it, let me present the crown sound
Constricted with the Likwid, the ticket round town
The wicked wild sound unleashed out the cage
Plus the Alkaholiks got the bar on stage
Get pissy, Tipsy got a baggy full of cavi
J-Ro put D's on the Mavi'
Swift got TV's in the Caddy
Tash kept it all factory
The Likwid far from tacky
Even if I step in the Sky Bar, K-Swiss and hard khakis
Y'all niggas better be happy, let me bubble

and catch a charge shake em down like the riot squad
And they deserve ruin like ancient Rome; I span the universe
and return to Earth to claim my throne

Stand like Collossus, regardless to whom or what
Numerous attempts at my life, so who to trust
Who but us, to supply you with the fire?
The burning truth, 150 Absolut proof
On the mic like Moses spoke in golden scribe
Survivor of the oldest tribe whose soldiers died
I notified families, we shed tears and more
but our hands are the ammo cause the battle's still on
Sound the horn; we come rumblin through the function
Precise laser beam technique to touch somethin
When we die hard, to build the monument to honor us with

King Tech,"I reminisce for a spell, or shall I say think back
22 years ago to keep it on track
The birth of a child on the 8th of October
A toast but my granddaddy came sober
Countin' all the fingers and the toes
Now I suppose, you hope the little black boy grows, huh
18 years younger than my mama
But I really got beatings cause the girl loved drama
In single parenthood there I stood
By the time she was 21, had another one
This one’s a girl, let’s name her pam
Same father as the first but you don’t give a damn
Irresponsible, plain not thinking
Papa said chill but the brother keep winking
Still he won’t down you or tear out your hide
On your side while the baby maker slide
But mama got wise to the game
The youngest of five kids, hon here it is
After 10 years without no spouse
Momma’s gettin' married in the house
Listen, positive over negative for the women and master
Mother queen’s risin' a chapter
Deja vu, tell you what I’m gonna do
When they reminisce over you, my god

When I date back I recall a man off the family tree
My right hand poppa doc I see
Took me from a boy to a man so I always had a father
When my biological didn’t bother
Taking care of this so who am I to bicker
Not a bad ticker but I’m clocking pop’s liver
But you can never say that his life is through
5 kids at 21 believe he got a right too
Here we go while I check the scene
With the Portuguese lover at the age of 14
The same age, front page, no fuss
But I bet you all your dough, they live longer than us
Never been senile, that’s where you’re wrong
But give the man a taste and he’s gone
Noddin' off, sleep to a jazz tune
I can hear his head banging on the wall in the next room
I get the pillow and hope I don’t wake him
For this man do cuss, hear it all in verbatim
Telling me how to raise my boy unless he’s taking over
I said pop maybe when you’re older
We laughed all night about the hookers at the party
My old man standing yelling good god, almighty
Use your condom, take sips of the brew
When they reminisce over you, for real

I reminisce so you never forget this
The days of wayback, so many bear witness the fitness
Take the first letter out of each word in this joint
Listen close as I prove my point
T to the r-uh-o-y, how did you and I meet?
In front of big lou’s, fighting in the street
But only you saw what took many time to see
I dedicate this to you for believing in me
Rain or shine, yes in any weather
My grandmom pam holds the family together
My uncle doc’s the greatest better yet the latest
If we’re talking about a car, uncle sterling got the latest
I strive to be live ’cause I got no choice
And run my own business like my aunt joyce
So pete rock hit me, nuff respect due
When they reminisce over you, listen

Listen, just listen
To the funky song as I rock on
And that’s word is bond
I’m not playin
Everybody, just coolin
This song we dedicate
To the one and only
Never be another
He was my brother

You see me standin' outside of your buildin'
Screamin', ""Puffy is good, but Slim Shady is for the children!"" (Hey, wait!)
I look at my life in a new light, fuck it
Give me two mics, I write songs for me, fuck what you like
You'll probably hear me rap half-hearted 
'Cause I don't like rap anyway
I'm just tryna get my porno career started (hell yeah)
Every place and event, ""Been there, done that""
Shit, Dre stuck me in a suitcase when he went 
Want a deal? Study these five chapters
Lesson one, throw demos as hard as you can at signed rappers
Lesson two, face 'em and dis 'em (what up dog?)
Don't give em a demo, kidnap 'em (I want you to come with me)
And make 'em come to your basement and listen (you're gonna fuckin' check this out)
Lesson three, get a job at a label, switch demos with Canibus 
And put yours on the owner's table (here listen!)
Lesson four, know you heard this before
""Hey, let me get your number, I'll call you tomorrow, for sure!""
Don't act like a fan, you want to get signed?
Get the whitest A and R you can find
Pull him aside and rap as wack as you can
Lesson five, get a hook-up at Jive
Dress up like I.C.P. and have them come see you perform live
And that's the key, but when you see me on the street
I ain't givin' you shit bitch, don't even bother askin' me (get away from me)
Toilet water splashes me right in the ass when I'm spittin'
'Cause I'm always shittin' when I'm rappin' like Master P (uh)
Got a blow job from Paula Jones, and stuck it so far in her mouth
My balls broke both of her collarbones (ow!)
Told Mya this shit was all about me-ah (It's all about me)
Gave Alyssa Milano syphilis, mono and gonorrhea (You're a dick)
And all three of my main girls said see-ya
'Cause Brandy and Monica walked in and caught me fuckin' Aaliyah (what? Oh my God!)

In your driveway (what?) and drive away

Blood drippin' from it, rippin' your stomach like a paper mache
You talk a lot of shit, but you was never ill though
I'm sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow
Tipped over some cows, just for a joke and a laugh 
Jumped up, choked a giraffe, snapped his neck and broke it in half
Wagin' wars, went on stage and sprayed Cage with 'Agent Orange'
And wiped my ass with his page in Source (here!)
The demon is here, steamin' this year
I rip Mystikal's voice box out, scream in his ear 
It's not a gimmick bitch, it's an image, I live it

Who's itchin' to leave you disfigured and stiffer than Christopher
Reeves, I was teething with strep throat 
While your mother was breastfeeding
And gave her the flesh-eating disease
I'm iller than takin' a hammer and beatin' your knees
And walkin' through South Central L.A., bleedin' in jeans (Am I a Blood or a Crip?)
Wakin' up the next day in breathin' machines
Flashin' back to being shot and repeatin' the scenes

Cause I'm the one that you claim to love for life

I take a chance jack, so I must attack
With knick knack paddywack so I won't lack
Oh my style is def, and as deadly as crack

Battle in the trenches where the funky be playin'

A kin not blood related, but you can call us cousins
Cause as we climb the charts, better known as statistics

Droppin' hits like I'm Housin', You Gots Ta Chill, and more
The proof is in the pudding (yo check the Billboard)

Up against your body as the music just swings
Knockin' out the suckers, now who's left?

The cool gangster, the gangster, that's me

Now keep on movin', better yet keep steppin'
You know, from the right to the left and
Dance all night till your knee caps break
You can do the Biz Markie, then the Heavy D Shake

If you like to boogie from sun to the moon
Well, cut the rug to my rhythm and blues tune
Just remember if the phonograph skips
Don't worry about a thing, we're on a dancin' tip

And I got to see you move it

Yeah, yeah, come on, come on, come, E-Swift
We got to see you move it

Well I'm the one for my treble, two for my bass
3, 4, 5 just to stay on pace
Now that I got your attention you'll be happy to know
That they call me Tee the King but King Tee's how it goes
So suckers, get your shit and get packed
Catch the next boat out, supreme Tela's back
And I'm funky once again, so run and tell a friend
They said I wouldn't last but I'll be here until it ends
Yo, I'm the king at being cool but get a load of this
They wanna label me best L.A. soloist
I couldn't be like that, but then again I could
Cause half of you MC's ain't no good
Anyway, hey, I got somethin to say
Directed to every MC in L.A.
You run up on the King - huh, how dumb
You knew from the beginning you shoulda brung a gun, son
Cause I be shootin the gift like it's a gift
Take the punk, slide em up just like a spliff
Then everything's cool and copacetic
I wrote the book on being cool, oh, you read it?
How'd you like the part where I tell you how to walk
The kinda clothes to wear, the use of slang in your talk?
No need to look around cause there ain't no clone

Now this tune right here allows you to get funky
Literally you can do what you want, see?
I'm more like the pilot or the driver of the scene
Or somethin that you usually dream
Yeah, I'm manufacturin the sickest metaphor
Lyrics you're not ready for
Hear it, I keep a steady score
Of suckers and muthafuckas who like to suffer
I wear big ropes in clusters
And I execute, never wore a sexy suit
I wear khakis with a t-shirt and hiking boots
A rare fashion with the gangster touch
Because Ballys don't mix and turtlenecks suck
But hey, I be crashin, throw in a accent
Maxin while I'm waxin the boots with passion
Happens to be one of my favourite attractions
The name's King Tee, but the T's for taxin
Phony MC's, them sucker punks wanna riff
Just because I wanna give the party a lift
You know, build your spirits expand your horizon
This particular production is mine's
And E-Swift's, the DJ E-Swift to be exact
Holds a hypnotizing scratch, make the others look whack
So look all you want cause there ain't no clone

Open mic night, so, the Liks gots to grab it 
Check the mic, it sounds tight so 
I guess we might rock the motherfucker all night yo 
The niggas went wild, the hoes went crazy 
We dropped the microphone than we Swayze 

Ooh don't I sound great when I down a black eighth 
My style is much hotter than the enchilada plate 
My name is James but the girls call me God when I'm humpin'
I should get a gold medal for broad jumpin' 
Rappers, talkin' bout, back to the old school 
You never shoulda left in the first place fool 
Now everybody wants to be a prophet 
But I won't quit rhymin' bout my dick so get off it 
You put a rhyme together but I only dismantle it 
So gimme a high-five cause you juts can't handle it 
If rap was a swimming pool I'd climb to the top 
Plus a triple-back, hand me the mic and watch the belly flop

Dress the same, shoot the same, fuck the same

Check this out
Hey, I knew this nigga named johnnie walker
A nightstalker, a big shit-talker
Even though he liked a lot of vodka (say what? )
He was from tennessee, sprung off hennessey
Makin enemies fast - in l.a.n. they didn't play (what? )
He got into a tanque/tangle with +ray+, he had on too much gray
Ray had a strawberry sister named daquiri
Johnnie politely her ass behind the back three
Now, all four uncles e&j wanna tossi
Martini and rossi had to get the niggaz off me
He got jacked for his dana's, in other words
(give it up nigga, give it up!)
He caught the nighttrain and blasted his thunderbird
With the pistol, him and cisco, couldn't stand him
Cause he caught him lickin brandy off his sister named kandi
At this point he had more bad luck than a trash truck
He lost his girl, remi spent his last buck up
Remi caught him shootin game at elayne, so now
Flowers and champagne don't mean a damn thang
Remi ended up runnin off with martin
He was wanted for arson for startin fires in carson
So johnnie hired a gun named rum, and paid him
151 and the job got done
With a thirty-eight straight to the face
He caught him in a six-pack and got they ass back
Up close he made 'em post and broke all their glasses
(? ) and rum threatened their families with matches
He felt he needed more men just like gin
So he packed his strap and started claimin silver satin
From then on in, anybody caught bailin
Down seagram's 7 was bound to get sweated
Except bartyles and james, cause they was cool
He knew 'em from school when they didn't bang and made moves
Turns out, he never reached the top
They found his ass at the beach ""on tha rox""

MC's in ninety-five that think they rock like 
MC's in ninety-five, MC's in ninety-five 
MC's in ninety-five that swear they rock live 

MC's in ninety-five they need way more rehearsin'
They write they booty kyrics then they add they little curse in 
You're not a true hip-hop person 
Spend a little time with your rhymes and quit makin' wack versions 
I send this shit out to all them niggas from that group 
With the ninety minute demo sounding just like Snoop 
You better bizzay, your ass up out my rhyme zone 
Fore I leave you on the ground broke up like pine cones 
You're rootin' and tootin' but ain't did no shootin' 
While the freshest hip-hop, it curses verses like a wicked witch 
Disaster, cock the rhyme flows back to kill 
To get me out your system takes more than Golden Seal 
'Cause I bust so many flows I gotta file my shit in columns 
While MC's be goin down like Olympiads that slalom, rock-bottom 
I got em, left without no watchers 
While I be housin niggaz like they put up for adoption 
I rock loaded, I never get promoted 
But through the bullshit my crew stays devoted 
While you be bustin' lyrics bout the funs y'all niggas toted 
I'll be standin like a B-boy with both arms folded 
But no exucses, I still get the loosest 
When RIco's in the house tryin to grab the mic and juice this 
So back the fuck up like we told you last time 
Cause it's the Liks in the house with the ninety-five rhymes

We can do out thing (we can do our thing), bottoms up! 

I wake up, kill a roach, call the homies, hit some weights 
Reminesce about the shows we did in forty-eight states 
Banned in the rest, but we was on tour with who 
De La, and Quest, we made the crowd say yes (yes) 
Now it's like fuck, Make Room, move your ass out my way 
Bay-bee, bay-bee 
With all these hoes around clwon, why you want to bang? 
Let's have a celebration like cool and the Gang 
I bring it all the way back, like a punk return 
I rock some spots and call more shots than Chick Hearns 
The only MC I like is Amante 
I was drinkin Asi Spumante wit cha auntie 
Bust them lyrics shots from the AKG 
When it comes to style and finesse, I'm the epitome 
Hit a beat, make em all retire, flyer 
Higher than a jet, like Stet I'm on fire 
'Causin pain like a runaway train you don't stop 
Drop the track, now watch it flow back to the top 
I'm the J-are-O, not J-E-are-you 
And you know what we came to do, bottoms up!

Raise up off the wall, bitches Last Call 
Ready for the ruckus, pushin' motherfuckers off the stage 
Teela's got a brand new gauge 
So Make Room, for the crew with beats that 
I got a complex I guess I bust best with stress

Uh, I bring drama, like Jeffery Dahmer 
Choppin' up MC's with they mama

Down two 40's, then hit the boom
Release all your doubts cause, I'm what it's about
The funky drunk man, in front with the stout
And niggaz wanna test the fashion
Cause I bring passion, for those who's askin
I don't trip I just, hit the switch for the funk shit
I don't fuck with the punk shit
I slang my rap like crack, and niggaz be cluckin
A quick blast for the buck
Then they spark, and yo oh, peace to Mark
For the beat from Carolina to the Compton streets
They'll know, the original G, from the see-P-T
I ""Act a Fool"" on the funk boy, you can't see me

""To all my people with the funk.."" "".. where ya at?""
You can't see me!
""To all my people with the funk.."" "".. where ya at?""
You can't see me!
""To all my people with the funk.."" "".. where ya at?""
""To all my people with the funk.."" "".. where ya at?""

All aboard the mothership, prepare to set sail
Lyrics fat, swell as a killer whale
Enemies approachin, identify yourself
They're raisin up the flag, backin up they get to blast
Open fire, cannons let loose
Shut 'em down like the spruce goose
Captain aye aye, they still floatin
Give the order - blow they punk ass out the ocean, got 'em
Drink hit the dank as they sink to the bottom
Schools of sharks circles then the sea turned all purple
Even jacques costeau punk-ass was scared to go
And that just goes to show to uhh, let you know, uhh
As I chill again like gilligan and the skipper
A nigga kickin it with two hoes like jack tripper
Swabbin the deck, just stabbin in my cabin
Rubbed the magic lamp and out popped aladdin like ""what's happenin? ""
I said, ""what's up? I want my rhymes to be the dopest
Ala.. cadabara.. hocus pocus
You think they can see me? "" he said, ""nope not really
Cause the fog's in the air plus you're way out there""

[chorus]
When you look up in the sky, ohh me oh my
It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a God damn shame
Tela come wicked and you best beware
You will see when he kick it that he's way out there

[king tee]
My style pattern's unique, exquisite, so come visit
Exhibit a through g, through z, e-n-t
Stuck your equilibrium on activate
Captivate the ear and then his eyesockets upon my pockets
I left him in suspense, who's the, tribes and crews?
Competition none exists bitches be blowin me kisses
Others fall like missiles, the cap was artificially flavored
My first verse, it quenched your thirst
For instance, I'm makin people boogie but yet
From long distance, causin it to interfere with your hemisphere
Flee, it's a g recipe
It get you hooked, havin fits off my shit

[chorus]

[king tee]
They wanna wipe us out! I think they hate us
Killers with the pencils and the papers and erasers
I'm comin through ya living room boom, shok-a-lok-a boom
Shake ya whole area, break your sound barrier
So wake up if you sleep cause like a clock I tock I'm tickin
Early bird, get the worm, and I stopped slangin chickens
But I still be kickin facts, black, black on black crime
Why the hell you jackin me? I don't have a damn dime
My skills kill you like a deer with my spear
When it rains it pours he fell from the tier off the third floor
The pieces of the puzzle huh, figure it out
And start fuckin around and we'll be diggin you out
And it's just that simple put the thang up to your temple
And now you got a permanent dimple
It's king, tee, the name nigga and don't get snotty
Better knock on some doors and ask somebody (yeah)
So fuck that other shit and grab my hand with all your might
Cause I'ma show you what that west coast like
The flavor's unbelievable, nutritious, delicious

featuring King Tee 

King Tee: 
Now let me introduce whose first 
The nigga that's been down 
with the set since birth 
Whatever it was worth 
I checked in on the norm 
Since a juvenile callin' 
Shots in the dorm 
Moms said you better get right 
Or shake the spot 
I chose to break and be a rollin' stone 
Like pop 
Stashin' the rocks by the gats 
With the Gs 
So I can talk crazy when the narks yell freeze! 
I don't fight the feelin' 
Gotta hustle with a passion 
Comin' cross state to put you down 
With some action 
In actuallity I keeps it real in the streets 
Remininsin' younger days 
Over gangsa ass beats 
And I, 
Hit the weed 
Til myeye balls bleed 
While my life is corrupted 
By lust and greed 
Serve you anything from cocaine 
Up to speed 
I came with the drank 
So here's five on the weed 

Xzibit: 
See kids don't belong 
Up in grown folks business 
The Likwit niggas rollin' through with a thickness 
Sickness bear witness 
Like tequlla without a chaser 
It burns going down 
Niggas guaranteed to drown 
Legendary sound 
From the west coast underground 
The mighty King Tee 
And Mr. X to the Z, see 
Never underestimate the power 
Of the X man 
Dismantle your plans 
Or just catch you with a back hand 
Xzbit bring it to you live 
With the know how 
Cool in a gang 
And ain't about to change 
My lifestyle 
Catchin' bodies in this uphill battle 
But Xzibit unravel 
Have smoke will travel 
I bust Teflon rhymes 
Into the crowd, bitch 
You anin't Steve Rif 
So stop trying to get Loud 
You need to pump your brakes to avoid the collision 
Xzibit still winnin' 
Unanimous decisions 

King Tee: 
It's going down 
Once again everybody lay down 
Run your money and the jewels 
To the front without a sound 
The infamous supreme King Tee 
Glad to meet ya 
Derranged in the mothafuckin' brain 
Through ya speaka and hey 
I walk around the hood lookin' looped 
Strapped like a mothafuckin' 
Desert strom troop 
Niggas be like ""King Tila 
How you get that Benz?"" 
By sending birds to Oklahoma City 
To my friends 
I slang my gangsta funk 
Through the night 
Sometimes I fight 
Like I'm the ghost of Eric Wright 
Compton is where I dwell 
It's like hell 
Slangin' the shit that got the smokers 
In a spell 
And all my homies live lives 
Like crooks 
Rich and infamous 
Hoes want to look but get shook 
Cause we don't trust you hoes 
You'll have a nigga fucked up 
With a bullet through his clothes 
Positively nothings positive 
Negativity positively how we live 
Positively nothings positive 
Negativity positively how we live 

Xzibit: 
Ladies and gentlemen 
Undivided attention 
Xzibit get you open like Nicole Brown Simpson 
It's the... 
Most dangerous things next to grizzles 
Unsolved mysteries 
Xzibit hit you penetentary style 
Quick sharp and straight to the neck 
I'm heavy on your chest 
I'm all up in your life 
Like stress 
The coast that resides to your left 
Whre niggas perpitrate 
And catch a fate worse than death 
And like Cyanide I'm hard to detect 
Got more desighns and stragiht lines 
Than an architect 
King Tee chapter four 
Verse seven reads 
Xzibit shall come and break down humanity 
Niggas lose ther're sanity 
Trying to handle me 
Dysfunctional member of the Alkaholik family

Dedicated to the up city
Straight West Coast nigga, ain't no pity
Put holes in niggas, real pretty
Real shitty like a black Frank Nitty
I give drugs to the thugs price-free
Handed down the game by that nigga Ice-T
No doubt players like me
Recognize the great King Tee, about twenty grand a ki
Ah, that's that G shit, no doubt about that
Statutory lyrics is how I rape the rap
And get your niggas off my back
And no, GOD, ya don't pull a strap, 'cause (*gun shot*) FUCK THAT!
I'm very precise when I shoot
Straight out the roof of my Lexus coupe
Ya want to blame Tha Alkaholik group
But, naw, that nigga Tela must've hit the loot
'cause he's actin real loonie
And I don't give a fuck cause I'm drunk and I'm a G like Spoonie
The hoodrats want to do me
So if you've got'cha county cheque give it to me

Now baby, don't trip, it's King Tee with the gangsta shit
Ain't fuckin with nothin but them platinum hits
And the two dog groan, a 50 gat to your dome

Huh, so I guess I earned the title 'OG'
Been down for ten years, this my fifth Lp
I'ma get this one easy
A real motherfuckin G, are-rock Tee
Now all these fools talkin 'bout they some killers
Car stealers, big time drug dealers
Bitch ass niggas keep it real, don't lie
You ain't killin shit and they gon' let shit die
You ask ""Who the hell am I?""
They call me 'Big Bone' and on my worst night I fades em all
And I come through ya hood like a locc ass G
Rip any fool that calls hisself an MC
It's only one way, let's have gun play
I make it play, nigga, fuck what you got to say
I got a mad crew of murderers, ex-burglars
Puttin soft niggas outta service

Now baby, don't trip, it's King Tee with the gangsta shit
Ain't fuckin with nothin but them platinum hits

Baby, don't trip, it's King Tee with the gangsta shit
Ain't fuckin with nothin but them platinum hits
And the two dog groan, sittin on chrome
That nigga on the mic str-8 gone

My whole crew lives illegal
Strapped with the bulletproof vest in the front and back Regal
Smokin that sticky green grass
Hittin switches, bumpin on cuts from the past
We smoke leaf 'cause we live like G's
Super-soft niggas become enemies
I hit a lick on the East for ten ki's
Now everything I drive is on Deez
I'ma make you believe, I gotta put it down like a real nigga should
My dope spot in every nigga's hood
I don't waste time, I need to get what's mine
Fourteen shells from behind
Leave you in the blind, str-8 paralysed from ya spine
A partner of organised crime
Ya hear it all the time but now ya gotta hear it from the truth
Til my nigga Karl Phat's respect due

King Tee,"Yo Pooh, let's... drop... some...
Bass, to make the walls shake
And vibrate the floor, just like an earthquake
King Tee is back again, but with a new topic
I wouldn't listen too close, 'cause it's toxic
A new format, complete with the tool
Even though I transform, I stay cool
For me to get taken, how would you figure it
Right off the bat, if you thought so would be ignorant
Or just stupid, or cold dumb
I play lead vocals, Pooh plays drums
Keith does cuts, suckers get torn but
I gotta break, here comes the horns...

Bass, to make your heart shiver
I know you, remember back when I used to wear silver
But I gave it a toss, 'cause I was told
That you're not a real B-boy, without real gold
So I, went downtown to see
How much is the thirty inch dookie
It's quite a bit of money for a big gold chain
Throw him a thousand then he hand me some change
And now I'm cooler, in other words I got it goin'
Sway to the side, while I'm showin' a professional skill
That I put together with perfection
I gotta clear my throat, punch in the horn section!

'Cause I need some boom, to crack the walls
Break the windows, shake the room
When I'm done take my photo, this is how it go though
King of cool lyrics, and I'm solo
As a rhyme preacher, shoulda been a teacher
Let the bass reach ya, and let it beat ya
Never givin' up 'cause I persist to be the dopest
I wouldn't take it as a gag or a joke it's
Serious, bass drum kickin' like a ninja
You want to dance to death, I'll send ya
If you say that I'm the coolest I'll probably say ya",Bass,1997

Yo, I'm from Killa Cali

I'm hella fresh comin straight through your chest 

I blow a hole in you soul, I'm constantly on a roll 

'cause in order to survive, you gots to have drive 

Like a rental, but I'ma call you Ben 'cause you gentle 

My crew's blowin up like a Pinto 

Hip hop's gettin rotten but we stay fresh like a Mento 

So put it in your mouth 

We gonna show you what this rap shit is really all about 

We gonna turn this bitch out like Goldie 

This cut will still bump when it's an oldie 

And if we still ain't sold platinum or gold 

That'll be the bigges lie you ever told me, hold me...back 

Black, I snack on the wack and wash it down with a fifth of Yak 

It's like that and that's the way it is 

You can ask his to stay out my biz

Bust that ass, super nigga jeep class 

Me last in the game, no problem 

Sit and drink a fifth with my nigga James Robinson 

Check your alcoholic pulse while its throbbing

Doin felony crime, but now I bust mine 
Instead of bustin' at enemies when the sun go down

King Tee,"It's Friday night on the streets of L.A.
I'm goin' out, been hangin' round the house all day
So I take me a shower, dress like a big daddy
Stop at the Arco, put some gas in my Caddy
Armor on my wheels, shine up my Daytons
Check my 12-gauge, I see jackers just waitin'
Got in my car, rolled up the tinted glass
Looked for my zapp tape to pop in my dash
Can't find it, forget it, went under my seat
Found my old fired tape of the song ""knee deep""
So I popped it in, then I pumped it up
Love hearin' funk, because disco sucks
Body got chills when the basses started poundin'
I took off because I'm goin' to town, and
Won't be back 'til mornin', don't have to go to school
(Better get ready) I'm finna act a fool

Now I'm on the move, got a grand in my pocket
Reached for my phone, plugged it in the socket
Heard the dial tone, so I dialed up Aladdin
He answered the phone and said ""what's up?"" I said ""what's happenin'?""
He said, ""where you been? I been tryin' to get in touch
The party's in Watts,"" I said, ""I don't give a fuck""
""If you want to go, just wear neutral colors
If anybody asks you, just tell 'em you're my brother""
Stopped at the store to buy me a Cisco
A 40 ounce and some crackers by Nabisco
A pack of Dentyne and I pulled out a 10
And said, ""fuck it, Supersacco and gin
I'm finna act a fool""

Now I'm drivin' down Compton on my way to get Aladdin
Feelin' like a pimp 'til my tape started draggin'
It's a old tape anyway, it ain't no thing
Pulled it out and slapped in dana dane
Got to Aladdin's house and I honked my horn
He said, ""when we comin' back?"" I said, ""6 in tha morn'""
So he got in the car, lookin half-dead
So I gave him my Cisco and took the 40 to the head
Now I'm feelin' tipsy, and I'm headed for Watts
But wait, what do I see sittin' at the bus stop?
Sexy Susanna, had a butt that kills
Pretty long hair, but they say it's not real
Aladdin yelled ""these fake or real?"" she threw a rock in my glass
So I got out my car and drop-kicked her ass
I checked out my window, everything was cool
She was lucky I was nice and I didn't act a fool

We finally arrived at the party, drunk as a jerk
Got out my car, pressed the kit so the alarm, would chirp
After that we made our way, I tried not to fall
Couldn't walk a straight line if they let me crawl
Got to the door, and what spots my eye?
My homeboy Mr. Prince, and he's smokin' some Thai
So I stumbled his way and said, ""hey, pass the jay""
I took a hit then I reached for my mouth spray
This girl asked me to dance, but I told the hoe no
'Cause she was on my tip 'cause of my big gold rope
But it seems she got offended, that's splendid
Before she starts somethin', I just slap her and end it
'Cause I feel like a gangster, and I just don't care
About a girl with fake drag, fake eyes, fake hair
Fake clothes, fake nails and all that fake jewelery
All she want to do is tell her friends that she screwed me
I get nutty, act a fool when I want to
Run up when I'm drunk and I just might pump you
Take your car, your wife, keep talkin', your life
Beat you down and have you smokin' the pipe
(You know why?) 'Cause I'm cool

(Well, kill me! Shoot me, muthafucka!)
(I gotcha)

It's not a flute or a trumpet, don't beef 'cause you love it
A funky guitar rhythm that Pooh sampled and cut it

So for those who really know what dope stuff sounds like
If it sounds good, sounds funky or sounds hype
Put your ear to this and let me know what you think
Yo Pooh, bust the guitar while I grab me a drink

Listen to the guitar playin'
Listen to the guitar playin'

Now to many people this tune is like fazin'
Get the crowd dancin' with the funkiest persuasion
Hypnotizin' suckers with some personal-fication
Get the crowd movin', motivation
(C?mon)

See I'm like a symbol to MC's, I'm a father
No wait, I'm a lyricist, better yet a saga
Enough about the King 'cause you know I get far
I played with the bass, now I'm messin' with the guitar

And the way that it sounds you say shucks
It can't be real how the player just plucks on the strings
It rings yo, it's like the funkiest rhythm
Pooh brings the drums with the sticks to hit 'em

It's not ballet jazz punk rock or swing, it's dope
Rappin' brought by the T apostrophe King
And if I was in school and this was an assignment
I wouldn't type it or write it, I'd just rhyme it

'Cause rhyme is what I like, I got a metaphor background
A punk jumps up, I bust a verse, he sits back down
I wrote a epic, I hope you accept it
Fly stupid rhymes I composed and perfected

I'm down with some people that know what they're doin'
Darryl and Bobcat and Dwayne and DJ Pooh
And Keith Cooley is cool see, I'm the coolest person
Somebody drop the guitar before I start cursin'

Listen to the guitar playin'
Listen to the guitar playin'

So as it looks, the people like it
The funky guitar tune that we ignited
Pooh, I mean really, suckers be stumblin'
When they hear the funky guitar strummin'

You know frankly, I think this cut is kinda musical
Just like my bass song but don't get them confused though
The guitar gets your mind in the funky kind of state
And my bass makes the walls shake
(Yeah)

Suckers can't come close with what I got goin'
What I be doin', what I be showin'
How I be conquerin' and how I keep rulin'
What makes the King Tee stay so cool and

Where I get my Filas from, how I learned my slang
How could I afford such a big gold chain
And fly girlies tempt me when [unverified] wanna hit me
Why I drink brew 'til my body gets tipsy

To ask all the questions that I just spoke though
It's not magic or a hoax I'm just loco
I like bustin' on the funky dope track
Smooth like T, mo' powerful than a gat

Now that you know what's goin' around
(Come on)
Here comes the funky breakdown

That's smooth, man
That made me laugh at all these suckers, man
You laughin' too Pooh?
(Yeah, haha)

Listen to the guitar playin'
(Haha)
Listen to the guitar playin'
(Haha)

Yo Pooh, yo Pooh, break it down for a minute
Let me talk to the party
Now yo, me and Pooh is feelin' real hot right now, you know

But we want y'all to know, that see, me and my crew
We from Compton, y'all heard about Compton? Compton
(Compton)
Aight, see that's where we from

[King Tee:]
Yo whassup, it's King Tee on the vocals
I rock the coolest rhymes, from here to Acapulco
I drive a Cadillac, not a played out DeSoto
Look I'm fin' to pose, photographer take my photo
Cool is back, in fact I'm comin' exact
It's MC Breeze and King Tee, and Pooh on the track
So we all got together, and thought of a freestyle
Gather round the stage, and come see how
Pros go for what they know and get paid for it
And I brung along the Breeze, so you can enjoy it
... And to fans I'm an idol
It's me and Breeze, ""Just Clowning"" is the title
Get up what's happening? I'm a King, not a Captain
Do the most coolest rappin', talk smack I'll be gat'n
I'm the King Tee punk, and I don't talk junk
But I do smoke blunt, love rappin' to funk
You know the mic is like a vine I swing on it like Tarzan
I drink a Coke and hit a note like Barbara Streisand
Step up, fess up, stand around and
Get down to the song ""Just Clowning""...
... It's the joint! [Repeat x 4]

[MC Breeze:]
Well I happen to be, hopin' to be, a big-timer
A dope rhyme and you won't find a
Nother MC who can get with this program
Served by no one, I mean no man
You say I'm good, it's the truth, you're not soupin'
I take it as a compliment and keep troopin'
Unlike most you know I never stop flowin'
My name is MC Breeze 'cause I'm the master at blowin'
Rhymes and lyrics, that is my specialty
I'm high-fidelity, you can't mess with me
Don't even think you can just sneak up
On bein' number one, is a high that I'm stuck on
I'm on a mission, wishin', all the time you spend
That you would make a legend or a monument
I'm not souped up, or a pooh-butt
I only lay my voice on a track that Pooh cuts
A beat is like food for thought so I eat it
I'm feelin' kinda hungry Pooh so just feed it
Keep the bass poundin' I like the way it's soundin'
Pooh is gettin' ill while me and Tee are just clowning
... It's the joint! [Repeat x 2]

[King Tee:]
I've been rappin' for a while, I'm acquirin' chapstick
Like a magician with the mic I do a hat trick
I don't wear a cape, or perform at a sideshow
Let me hit the 40 'cause my throat is kinda dry yo
When I'm on stage it's like a Broadway play
King Tee and MC Breeze and Jennifer Holiday
But Breeze, my throat's gettin so'
Get on the mic and won'tcha give it a go

[MC Breeze:]
Clowning, is like actin' ill sometimes
But when I ill, I like to say a dumb rhyme
To increase my fame and star stature
I'm like Anita Baker I'm caught up in the ""Rapture""
Hittin' like bolos when I go solo
Last name is spanish but yo, I'm not a cholo
Keep the bass poundin', I like the way it's soundin'
Pooh is gettin' ill while me and Tee is just clowning

[King Tee:]
But, but, but Breeze... You know me and you can clown right, right?
We gotta see if... Mixmaster Spade can do it
... It's the joint!

[Mixmaster Spade:]
Well it's Tuesday night, I got nuttin' to do
I guess I'll get on the phone and call DJ Pooh
Say ""Whassup Pooh? Are you beat?""
He say ""Forget that stuff, let's hit the street""
Since I got a Caddy, and you got a Z
I can roll witchu, or you can ride with me
I say ""We goin to a club that's dynamite"" (Where?)
The Red Onion on a Tuesday night
I walked in and glanced, shook a few hands
Grabbed the baddest broad, then I commence to dance
I looked the DJ, and said ""Whassup?""
He said ""Spade's in the place and he's doin' the butt""
Now I'm back to the rap that we have at hand
I'm the Mixmaster man with the master plan
I slapped the girl on the butt then she started to frown

King Tee,"See not long back when I was seventeen 
When I walk in the jam 
Suckers look at me mean 
They wouldn't give me respect 

Told girls I was wack 
You shouldn't have did that brother 
I'm here for the payback 

They spread rumors about the king 
They said that I was a front 
All my rhymes are wack 
All my cuts are bunk 

They said I live in a slum 
My father's a bum 
They said my sister's a crackhead 
My brother's drinkin' rum 

But I didn't let it bother me 
Took my time 
Sat at the kitchen table 
Wrote my rhymes 

And now that I'm eighteen,I'm not a kid no more 
I could walk in a nightclub and wop across the floor 
I'm a show you I'm good 
Make you wish that you could do the things that I do 

If I could teach you I would 
See,back then you didn't like me 
I stayed in your path 
See my name on a flyer 

You giggle and laugh 
Tell people I'm soft when I could really get off 
You didn't know it,now I show it 
I'm the Hip Hop boss 

See,people like you are known for fakin' 
Frontin' and bluffing and perpetratin' 
Biting and lyin' and always waitin' 
For me to come around and see how much I'm makin' 

See,money I got, 'cause I'm a pro at this trade 
You thought you got away 
But you're about to get paid 
You told girls I was wack 

Shouldn't have did that brother 
Look, I'm King tee and my payback's a mother 

As I talk you get madder 
Because the crowd starts to notice 
A professional rhymer,yeah,you must know this 
I'm cooler than most 

Most of all I'm so cool 
Never smacked on the crack 
Because I'm too busy in school 
See,I just think you're jealous 

And you envy my style 
You hear my rhymes,say it's weak 
But in your mind you're sayin' ""wow"" 
Tell people I'm ugly and I got big lips 

But as I walk by your girl 
She want to ride king's tip 
Going down in fame just remember my name 
Not a sapoe with a afro 

A king with a brain 
If a sucker gets beef 
And want to battle,let'em come 
We'll discuss it over lunch 

And drink some one-fifty-one 
After that I set a trap 
Even though I feel tipsy 
The crowd starts to clap 

And I ain't even got busy 
I'm great 
Some even say I'm a genius 
You said my crew was wack 

You haven't even seen us 
So I'll get you back 
Can't survive too long 
Tellin' lies about the king 

But I could take it I'm strong 
Got a Emmy in rap for usin' my cool strategy 
Rappin' was nominated to get a Academy 
The girlies I get,suckers probably get mad at me 

But I don't care 
King tee is the baddest,see 
Fila's my trademark 
I'm going for a medal 

Letting off some steam 
Like fire to the kettle 
Sportin' real gold and a baseball cap 
You better look out punk 
I'm here for the payback 

See,I'm macho supreme 
Head honch of the team 
Numero uno 
Kadafi of the Hip Hop scene 

I could be a cool rebel 
I'm already tuff 
Dominate rap artist 
Never spoke on a bluff 

Down and I'm hard 
When I'm rockin' I'm smooth 
I get a trophy for mostly doin' b-Boy moves 
Affiliated with a posse

And cold crush Chris 
Vatchiek's a pro 

He's also down with the krew 
The master mind of the drum

You'll look like a poot butt

King Tee,"Some cool shit for the King's anthology
And when I'm done, don't expect no apology
Stupid motherfuckers shoulda stepped when I warned 'em
I'm from the Boondocks of Compton, California
I'm just anxious to whoop some ass
I went to high school, but I flunked every class
So what makes you think I give a fuck about respect?
I'll put your bitch in check, and I'll bet
You won't run up, son of a punk and a bitch, too
I shoulda did a drive by on you and your crew
Cuz ya'll be poppin' some shit that's unheard of
For you, what's the word? Uh (wack!) it's murder, son
When I be crushin' your hood with a passion
And I ain't talkin' that Action Jackson
When I come you better run for ammo
Or get played like a fuckin' piano

And yo, we got my homeboy Ice Cube in the house from the motherfuckin'
Lench Mob (what's up, nigga?), and yo Ice Cube, I heard you're a singer now
Man what's up? Yo, yo

Do-Ray-Me. But I don't sing, mothafucker
I kick shit with the King, mothafucker
Ice Cube will clock the cash, rock the mass
And if you run up, I'll sock your ass
And watch that eye get swollen
Cuz I'm playin' punk niggas like Beethoven
So bust a cap or swing and die
Fuck Yul Brynner, it's still The King and I
Cuz where I'm from the sun don't shine
So One-Time hope I only bust one rhyme
But I bust one more for the suckers

Now they're lookin' for me, King Tee, and Pooh
Now every nigga that crossed me's soprano
Cuz I played their ass like a fuckin' piano

Yo, check this out, we got my homeboy Breeze in the
Motherfuckin' house from the L.A. Posse
and he got some shit to holler
Come
On, man, bust this shit

Well, I'm-a take the mic like it was a jack move
Run with the beat as long as the track moves
Hot as lava, organized like a seminar
Serve you, your crew, him, and them and a
Couple of rap-saps who think they can get butt
You slipped and shit, so nitwit, just get the nuts
Stealin' your high hopes, watchin' you write notes
Better walk a chalk line, not fuckin' a tightrope
Rap slicker, thicker, quicker than others, then I stop swift
Shift from 1st to 5th, while you stop to shoplift
Take the mic stand whenever the duty calls
If I bust a nut for every rhyme I had, I'd get blue balls
Serious as drama, I'm-a watch her say ""Me too.""
You're shorter than Michu, your rhymes are see-through
You're nothin' like GQ, transparent, I made it apparent
I'm here to wax and tax the incoherent
Cuz B-R-E-E-Z-E will eas-i-ly re-main to be-e a top MC
When you see me, I wear a beanie, and not a Kangol
Now you got played, like a fuckin' piano

This is just a sample of three black nig-roes
Who grew up in the heart of the ghetto
Doin' what we had to just to make ends meet
Some steal for a livin', some stand on the street
Just slang. Some gang-bang, but big deal
They say in Compton, you gotta kill or get killed
Mothafuckin' police pull ya over, slam ya down
Then tell ya that your hood is their town
And I ain't goin' for no shit like that;
Cuff me up, take me to jail, I'll come back
Talkin' much shit, cuz I talk what the fuck I feel
A few weeks in the county ain't no big deal
So a punk like you can't fuck with me

My beats are masculine, I think that there hasn't been
A better groove to keep you like dancing, man
I feel thankful to feel there ain't no
Sucker tryin' to gank my spot, least I think so

But I don't sweat, 'cause I can stand on my two feet
Hold the mic and just curse the beat
I don't complain about the crowd I attract
Roll out the red carpet, I'm comin', I'm back

When I'm done there'll be another ruff rhyme

There'll be another ruff rhyme when I'm done
I'm back, King Tee is back again

Well, this might seem odd
You ask who taught me, well, it musta been God
'Cause ain't none of y'all cool like me
The impresario, majestic Tee

Some rappers are scared of me, they say when they dare to be
Threatened, well, keep on steppin', I'll be prepared to be
Jacked, Jack, cause your rhymes don't match
You got bold when I left, now I'm back

To stomp you, 'cause you stomp wrong, so I'ma stomp on
Fool, you forgot, I'm from Compton
This is just a taste of my album, really nothin'
Just to show you I'm back, I'm comin'

When I'm done, there'll be another ruff rhyme
King Tee is back again, there'll be another ruff rhyme
When I'm done, there'll be another ruff rhyme
King Tee is back again, there'll be another ruff rhyme

Back again, back again, back again
There'll be another ruff rhyme
There'll be another ruff rhyme
When I'm done, there'll be another ruff rhyme

And if you live in compton, it's like at mccobb
From block to block everybody's bad
And if you don't know where you're at, then your life's been had
Cause they walk in the street with intentions to meet
Some sappy lookin punk with fila on his feet
And if you try to act tough, well mr. tough, you're through
Cause everybody's a family, if not, they're a crew
I'm here to give some advice advice (run!)

Alright man, tell em what's up, man

I used to cut up the beat on the two turntables
Now I'm rappin on the mic, cause I'm willin and able
When I'm on the mic I take no slack
And everytime that you see me I'm tearin a gat
I got .380s and .22s
You messs with me, I'm gonna bust on you
I got a .357 and a m-16
They call me master spade, and tee's the king
Now compton is the city where the homeboys stay
Rollin in a different car everyday
Can't roll too hard, gotta watch my back
Cause if I don't, I just might get jacked

Now the next place is kinda risky if you're walkin with your mother
Y'all can get shot if she wears the wrong color
They're all from the old school, nobody's modern
The place I'm talkin 'bout is the nickerson gardens
You can get away with murder, cause they murdered the cops
Cause they said they tried to run a bumrush on watts
But they took control, slingers walk real tall
While real down gangbangers write their set on the wall
If I was you I wouldn't visit here, it's like hell
And if you get robbed, who you gonna tell?
I'm only here for advice advice (run!)
And if you're ever in watts, you better bring a gun

Now you got a nice car with a brand-new paintin
Rag top convertable with all-gold daytons
You decide to take a ride down the crenshaw strip
You stop at the fat burgers to feed your lip
You got your sounds bumpin, playin zapp and vibe
A skeezer comes your way, you say, ""let's take a ride""
So you're cruisin crenshaw with her, you're goin to bail
A brown cutlass pulls up, they put a gauge to your head
They say, ""(get our your car) if you value your life
(and leave your money) if you love your wife""
Now you're standin in the street lookin like you're on crack
And you say to yourself: I can't believe I got jacked
You call the police because your car they stole
But when you get in touch with them, they put you on hold
Your car is gone, nothin could be done
So next time you cruise crenshaw, you better bring a gun!

Cassette and CD it's all mine the whole nine the right time

But T that's trippin' and that ain't my sport
I'd rather lamp in my crib and flip the Robb report
And set my v-dozen on the streets
Bump my beats
Cause when I'm twisting my dubs
Can't nobody compete
Imagine this: 
A hundred G 'lex on your wrist 
Imagine this: 
About ten karrots on your fist
Imagine this: 
All dime hoes on your list
Ha - that shit would be nice
But your name ain't ""Ice"" - kid... 
I'll screw the silencer on - rock you softly
How you gonna step to me kid? You grew up off me 
TV, Movies, and Records and Tours
So many busters wearing Versace I don't wear it no more... 

[King T]
But this will be a classic 
Many facets to get that ass kicked 
The alcoholic Don, call me King Tragic 
Watch me speak the magic
Watch me teach that old habit - full of havoc 
And Ice'll tweak the mix when it statics
People pay
Just to have me stay 
And say a verse 
I'll freak a couple words unrehearsed 
Then I burst 
I mean I bust
From all angles 
Guarunteed platium on your single

[Ice-T]
Yo T, I really must admit I'm blessed 
Master V does some other shit TV's in the head rests 
Never wear no vests because I got mad love 
I catch respect when other niggas catch slugs 
1, 2 I bust shit to load guns to
Beats for the hoodlums 
Somebody's gotta do'em
Fed's screw 'em
Faggot's got my whole crib bugged 
Mad tapps on the phone cause I deal with the thugs 
Drugs? never
No, the Ice is too clever 
I'm overseas
Checkin G's
Nigga please 
Ballin' since the 70's - yeah baby 
Blew up in the 80's 
Now you niggas hate me
You can't see me motherfucker your focus is off
You can't be me motherfucker, you're broke and you're soft 
Too many niggas try to pert my lifestyle - romancing 
I was kickin game while them kids was breakdancing 
Overlord - so why the wack niggas ain't dead?
Probably because my aim is over nigga's heads/ 
East coast - west coast, I play the whole map and bounce/ 
They got a benz but live in their mom's house... 

[Chorus]
[King T]
To all my G's rock on
get your ride on - when you hear it
The forbidden Gangland lyric
Player Haters fear it
Get you right up close near it
Possessed by the Eazy-E spirit
Ice-T set the limit
And niggas won't cross this line
suicide - and niggas won't cross this nine

You got to have cash, I guess you know

You put it on a tree or on the grass

Sacrifice worth waitin on the platinum and ice
I'm precise with the merchandise, came back like Christ
to change the game, while y'all niggaz remain the same
Clear the lane, comin through like Kobe, you can't hold me
You can't stop me, ever since I dropped ""Paparazzi""
I done watched the game unfold into some hideous shit
Like every idiot that can spit be droppin a hit
I transmit for the convicts, committed, never bullshitted
Shadowbox, detox, my own worse critic
It's like tryin to squeeze water from rocks
I negotiate the neighborhood stops and clean your clock with a glock
Sick of niggaz screamin they hot, but really they not
Beatin you all to the ground like six L.A. cops
Put your fist up in the air if you ever been shot
and lived to tell about it, never leavin home without it, c'mon

Bitches come a dime and a dove, we ain't trippin it

Didn't arrest aim, the bullet-proof vest came
These niggas shoot first, then askin' check names

It's all real; I bet fame; it's a chess game
Wrong move and it's checkmate (That's right)

But, really, niggas get money out here 
And, hey, everyday is sunny out here
So listen, don't play dummy out here

And his mom for being infected 

Never check it, so I invested 

My time and made sure little bro was looked at 

Pops got evicted, not a smack 

Pumped his fists and being that I'm a ?fugiless? 

The bum got done by the one 

And little Jeffery, no more tears left and drip 

Mixed wit seaman on his lip, emotional trip 

It confuses and bent ill thoughts

When I reached the party everything was right
Then Babylon raid, them raid, them raid
Me gets me 'fraid, me gets me 'fraid

It was like three blind mice
You could-a see how dem run
It was like three blind mice
You could-a see how dem run

Baddie sticks start flyin', man start to bawl
Some jump de fence, some put off defense
But it gets me 'fraid when Babylon raid

The police checked the deejay
Tell him to turn off sound
The crowd never like that
Them start gathering 'round

Let the music play
Let it play, let it play
Let the music play

It was like three blind mice
You could-a see how dem run

No man no want go a jail

Let it play, let it play

Let it play, let it play

I'm gonna smile when I'm swallowed by the sun
Oh yeah, the time is gonna come
I'm gonna smile when I'm swallowed by the sun
Yeah the time is gonna come
I'm gonna smile when I'm swallowed by the sun
Yeah, the time is gonna come",Neverending Sunshine,2018
King Tuff,"I left home
Tears in my eye
Where I was going
I had no idea

That must have been
The last time I cried
From that moment forward
All my teardrops disappeared

Yeah I'm going down
Where there ain't no one around
Nobody knows who I am

There's no way out
No north, no south
Here in no man's land

Digging for days
But no sign of diamonds
All that I saw
Was garbage and worms

And a glimpse of the future
The maniac horizon 
A silhouette I will dance
In the lightning storm

Yeah, I'm going down
To the forgotten part of town
With roses and rubies in my hands

The fog rolls in
And waltzes with the wind
Here in no man's land

The time finally came
To abandon my name
Take a blind-eyed leap
Into the big old unknown

Someday maybe you'll find me
Like a wild Santa Claus
In a tinfoil hat
Talking on a disconnected telephone

But I got my crown
And I got my sacred cow
I'm a Buddha in a blazing sinking sand 

The purple skies
Electrify my eyes
Here in no man's land

Tell my neighbor to water my plants
Tell the devil that I learned how to dance
Tell the angels to wait up for me
Tell the world I'm free and I'm

Deep in a dream
Landscape is empty
Except for one soul
She's waiting there for me

I fell into her arms
I faintly remember
The sweet song of salvation
The hummingbirds in the trees

Yeah, I'm checking out
And I'm riding on a cloud
Back to where my whole being began

Well, I started to speak in tongues
And swing around the sun
Here in no man's land

Oh, here in no man's land

Oh, here in no man's land",No Man's Land,2018
King Tuff,"I'm going back to the edge of the earth
Looking for an old friend
I didn't know when we said goodbye
That I wouldn't see you again
I still see your smiling face
In all the stars of outer space

Here one moment, gone in a flash
I guess, we all fall 
Through the cracks

The river shimmered like a sequin dress
Bouncin' off your blue eyes
You put it on, you started to dance
'Til you turned into the blue sky
I still see it in the summers of my brain
See it in the rainbows, see it in the rain

Here one moment, gone in a flash
I guess, we all fall
Through the cracks

What is on the other side
Sun palace in the sky
A perfect paradise
Another kind of life

You know you had such a beautiful brain
But no one understood you
You only saw one way to escape
But I wish you didn't have to
But through the cracks, a light came shining
Like the biggest, brightest diamond
Through the cracks, where you dispersed
And became a whole universe
I still see it in the stillness of the breeze
Sittin' on the stoop down on Elliot Street

Here one moment, gone in a flash
I guess, we all fall oh yeah, we all fall
Oh yeah, we all fall 
We all fall through the cracks
La la la la la la la la
Through the cracks
La la la la la la la la
Yeah we all fall
La la la la la la la la
Fall through the cracks",Thru the Cracks,2018
King Tuff,"I step into the sunrise
In my yellow shoes
Crossing through illusions
Directly to the truth
I light a little candle
I blow and make a wish
'Cause in this very moment
Death does not exist
No death does not exist

For so long I lived in shadows
Covering my eyes
I made it out of there somehow
To my own surprise
I guess I owe it all to big Luna
I call her with my bell
She took me in her silver wings
Yeah I believe she suits me well
Yeah I believe she suits me well

So throw in that rabbit
The potion's getting stirred
And all that's left to do now
Is say the magic word
And we can blow this popsicle stand
Straight to kingdom come
'Cause  all I need is your hand
And your ultraviolet love
Yeah, your ultraviolet love

Ultraviolet coming down
Everybody's happy now
Ultraviolet coming down
Everybody's high

Ultraviolet coming down
Everybody's happy now
Ultraviolet coming down
Everybody's high

Ultraviolet coming down
Everyone is happy now

Ultraviolet coming down
Everyone is happy now

Ultraviolet coming down
Everyone is happy now

Ultraviolet coming down
Everyone is happy now

Ultraviolet coming down
Everyone is happy now

Ultraviolet coming down
Everyone is happy now",Ultraviolet,2018
