Machine Head,"Oh your sweet little lies
Oh your sweet little lies
I can hear when I hold you close to me
When I look in your eyes
I see through your disguise
What I see is an only lonely void
And I can see hell in your eyes

'Cause you're drowning inside
Those fake tears that you cried
As I claw my way from your tragedy
Emptiness is your bride
Arrogance is your pride
I won't drown in another's misery
And you won't pull me down to die

No!
Stuck in this prison with a brother I loved
Stuck in this prison with the memories of...
Another time, when music's all that we had
Bonded by anger and addictions, so glad
Always together but no words are spoken
This is the sound of a friendship broken
Trapped and climbing up the walls
How the fuck do I get out of these pitfalls?

And you say that life is just a game and
Everyone who plays is just a pawn
And shame on me it went so long
How could I've been so wrong?
I've forever gone, colder
If life is just a game then
Game over

Dreaming of choking someone I used to know
Strangling the negativity that they sow
Resent has now become the face in the mask
That plays upon a bitter two-man cast
Go find somebody else to blame your problems
Trying to fuck me, because you can't solve them
Stop! You never gave a shit
We almost fucking quit, because how much you hated it

And you say that life is just a game and
Everyone who plays is just a pawn
And shame on me it went so long
How could I've been so wrong?
I've forever gone, colder
If life is just a game then
Game over

For as long as you're alive
I'll curse your worthless name

On the day
On the day of your demise
Unburied and left for the flies
Believe me that I will piss upon your grave
Forgiveness may greet me on someday
But I'll never forget all this pain
Let there be no mistake
This is not a game!

Oh your sweet little lies
Oh your sweet little lies
I can hear when I hold you close to me
When I look in your eyes
I see through your disguise
What I see is an only lonely void

'Cause you're drowning inside
Those fake tears that you cried
As I claw my way from your tragedy
Emptiness is your bride
Arrogance is your pride
I won't drown in another's misery
Forever this friendship has died

No!
And you say that life is just a game and
Everyone who plays is just a pawn
And shame on me it went so long
How could I've been so wrong?
I've forever gone, colder
If life is just a game then
Game over

Machine Head,"Let me feel my palms around your throat
Let me see the pain of lost control
Let me hear your heart racing inside
Let me see the darkness that you fight
When the night crashes down

See (No vision)
Can you believe? (Derision)
Will I fall? (Down so far)
Into the deep (It's so dark)

Ghosts will haunt my bones
So just leave me alone

Let me taste the salt within your tears
Let me swallow hope, it disappears
Let me steal the mind that makes you whole
Let me peel a layer from your soul

(Will I fall?) Down so far
(Into the deep) It's so dark

Ghosts will haunt my bones
They won't leave me alone

In darkest night I lay awakened with
These thoughts of endless black that never quit
The tortured thoughts inside my head you see
They hide a mask of pain that's so ugly

These ghosts come haunt my bones
They won't leave me alone

From my throat the agonies emit
My demons wrestle and my thoughts conflict
The stench of bile, as I purge this hate
An inner struggle I can't separate

These ghosts come haunt my bones
They won't leave me alone
Thunder cracks and dark furies sound
When the night crashes down

These ghosts come haunt my bones
They won't leave me alone
Thunder cracks and dark furies sound

Machine Head,"(America, America, I shed these words for thee)
All hail Praises be to thee
Oh ye paper deity
As we hail our sacred cow
To the bankers we will bow
Endless profit from their wars
Making slaves of all the poor
Our new god is on the hill
The Almighty dollar bill

I want to burn down Wall Street, baby
And fan the flames of discontent like Hades
Saints of red, white, and blue
Pass bonds of junk to you
Our flag has all but bled to green

In comes the flood
Wake up America
In comes the flood
Wake up America

Live to buy or time to die
It's all for sale on credit lines
Until the fucking end of time
Shackled to the dotted line
Oh the market may be free
But not for you and me
Succumb as we forget
To the angel of debt

I don't give a fuck if I'm rich, motherfucker
We bought that line 'cause we're a bunch of suckers
We're fighting for the scraps
We've let our conscience lapse
By turning cash into a god

In comes the flood
Wake up America
In comes the flood
Wake up America

Moneytheistic religion
Saints of the red, white, blue, and green
Who dare to inflate my life's interest rate
'Til their rich bellies burst at the seams
Our lives nothing more to them
Than a snap of financial decision
Blinded by a TV screen
All hail the American dream

And woe to thee
Our life empty
If we hold this dear
Then lose our fear

Wake up

Machine Head,"Dark lady read me the future
The ancient verse hidden away
I turn from the ever-gray, and

Oh

The king of pentacles is here
Strength and fortitude help to push away the fear
We stand atop the mountain with the hermit and the lamp
As the lovers in the knight of swords give in to the damned

What do The cards say?
The prophecy remains
The devil in the emperor could keep us locked in chains

It means a change is coming that you simply can't deny

In summer of '69, there came a prophet
His words were used profit off the minds of the weak
He spoke of holes deep within the desert
His followers into the belly of the beast
Don't look into his eyes

They're piling bodies one by one
Fulfilling all their dreams to come
The prophecy of war that Charles Manson had begun in the hills

The hills were echoing with their laughter
Happily ever after was a faded memory
Rosemary and the baby of Polanski
6 people dead and bloodying
In the hill's of Beverly
They're screaming for their lives
Praying and pleading for lives of babies unborn
The spawn of hell they just begin
The horror of the splitting skin
Ropes are tied around their necks
To breathe their dying breaths
In the hills
Of Hollywood tonight

Machine Head,"And with this now we die
And with this now we die

Standing at the edge of the world
Uncertainty calling as the page unfurls
Fortune, Heaven or Hell
Shedding my body of this mortal shell

Black steel and iron
A Lion Heart is forged from these bones
Fear not, the discontent you hide
Awake from the slumber and define this time

No fear to pay the price
And with this now we die

Ashes to ashes
The ocean crashes
Louder and louder it cries
Over and over
The sands wash over
Facing, embracing the tides
And with this now we die
And with this now we die
(And with this now we die)

Screaming violence into the void
Is anyone listening or is all destroyed?
Fighting heaven and earth
Saving your children from their pain and hurt

Bloodstone and diamonds
Nothing can break the strength of these stones
Cast off the shackles of the past
Live in the moment nothing ever lasts

Now cross the bridge of sighs
And with this now we die

Ashes to ashes
The ocean crashes
Louder and louder it cries
Over and over
The sands wash over
Facing, embracing the tides
And with this now we die
Are you ready to die?

Standing at the edge of the world
Standing at the edge of the world

The damned are we
Abused and beat,
We're left for dead
We raise our head
For we are strong,
And they are wrong
So scream with me,
I do believe!

I need your help,
For I have knelt
Held fist at skies,
And cried out, why?
Your shoulder strength,
It gives me length
We lift ourselves,
Together meld

So take my hand,
And don't look back
And sing with me, let new life be,
Old life goodbye,
And now we die
For we are one
Forever young
And with this now we die
And with this now we die
And with this now we die
And with this now we die

Are you ready?

And all those mysteries, lost in your eyes, lost in your eyes
We sail into the black

Side by side
Pounding the heretic drums as we rise or we fall

The nightmare it calls
The fear and betrayal begin
We’ve come so far
The shit we ingest
With a mouthful of spit and protest

We sail into the black 
We sail into the black

Go disappear, lost and forever broken
Shattered like glass
The scars and the sex
The lies and the fables we tell

Regrets that you’ll take to the grave

Empty heart is filled with malice
Cold

You better sleep with one eye open
Never let my name be spoken ill
Don't make me send the lions out to kill

I was born as a bastard, no father, no master
A shadow in silence left searching for answers
Put up for adoption and left with no option
Another kid fostered to fester forgotten

Machine Head,"Yesterday I told my sons, ""Sometimes the bad guys win""
And that it made me scared about the world that we live in
But I had to reassure them that it wouldn’t be for long
""Sons we have to be ourselves, we have to be strong""

I said, ""Boys you are the future, so let this be a lesson
There may come a day you have to fight off their aggression
'Cause fear and hatred won today, the darkness ate the light
But both of you look in my eyes, it’ll be all right""

In every step you take
I’m with you all the way
'Cause I would die for you
To do what’s right for you
In hopes that when I’m gone
You’ll carry on these words I wrote for you

'Til then
I’ll sing

Stand your ground
Don’t let the bastards grind you down
Be bold, be strange
Don’t let their fears make you afraid
There’s hope, it’ll change

Well I looked out to the world today, thought “What a bloody mess”
They stripped our morals from us, put ‘em under house arrest
And ""liberty” and “country” are the words they need to speak
A little “God”, a little “freedom”, if we don’t agree we’re weak

And every politician stood there idle and so smug
Empowering the racists and Second Amendment thugs
Wall Street and the billionaires, convinced us they’re so smart
Saying, vote with your wallets, instead of with your hearts

But we won't go away
You won’t forget our name
The pussy generation, the PC and the brave
The protesters that slink along these streets of misery

And so
I’ll sing

Stand your ground
Don’t let the bastards grind you down
Be bold, be strange
Don’t let their fears make you afraid
There’s hope, they’ll change
We'll change
Change

Oh, oh, oh

No, no, no, no, no (we say no)
No, no, no, no fuck no
No, no, no, no, no fuck no

So give us all your faggots, and your niggers, and your spit
Give us all your Muslims, the so-called terrorists
We'll welcome 'em with open arms and put 'em in our mix
We're better off together now, embrace our difference

Remember there is love
Our words can stop their guns
Forget the rednecks
Living in the past
We're never going back now, we've reached critical mass

And so

Like moths they're drawn towards the inhumanity

Devise a twisted plot and gently pull the strings

The revving engine of the war machine

Into a hangman's tree of deceit

Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues,1991
Machito,"Night and stars above that shine so bright 
The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan,1993
Machito & Afro Cuban Salseros,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose

I met him on a bus in Barcelona
We kinda got to talkin'

I asked him what he did in Barcelona
In sunny Barcelona

You are fortunate my friend

In Spain I am a famous Caballero
I fight the bravest bull in all the land
With the flip of the hip of the music of the band
I cha cha, the bull is so confused because I cha cha
I never kill him, only if he gets in my way 
Torero, torero play

He bragged about the many senoritas
Who showered him with flowers
With big bouquets of flowers
He told me that in Holly wood
They want him to be like Marlon Brando

Machito Ponce,"Ella era una chica plstica de esas que veo por ahi
De esas que cuando se agitan sudan chanel number three
Que sueñan casarse con un doctor
Pues el puede mantenerlas mejor
No le hablan a nadie si no es su igual
A menos que sea un fulano de tal
Son lindas delgadas de buen vestir
De mirada esquiva y falso reir

El era un muchacho plstico de esos que veo por ahi
Con la peinilla en la mano y cara de yo no fui
De los que por tema en conversacion
Discuten que marca de carro es mejor
De los que prefieren el no comer
Por las apariencias que hay que tener
Pa andar elegantes y asi poder una chica plastica recoger

Que fallo

Era una pareja plastica de esas que veo por ahi
El pensando sol en dinero
Ella en la boda en paris
Aparentando lo que no son
Viviendo en un mundo de pura ilusion
Diciendo a su hijo de cinco años
No juegues con niños de color extraño
Ahogados en deudas para mantener
Su estatus social en boda o hotel

Que fallo

Era una ciudad de plastico de esas que no quiero ver
De edificios cancerosos y un corazon de oro ver
Donde en ves de un sol amanece un dolar
Donde nadie rie donde nadie llora
Con gente de rostros de polister
Que escuchan sin oir y miran sin ver
Gente que vendio por comodidad
Su razon de ser y su libertad

Oye latino oye hermano oye amigo
Nunca vendas tu destino por el oro ni la comodidad
Nunca descanses pues nos falta andar bastante
Vamos todos adelante para juntos terminar
Con la ignorancia que nos trae sugestionados
Con modelos importados que no son la solucion

No te dejes confundir
Busca el fondo y su razón
Recuerda se ven las caras
Pero nunca el corazón
No te dejes confundir
Busca el fondo y su razón
Recuerda se ven las caras
Y jamas el corazón
Recuerda se ven las caras
Y jamas el corazón

Se ven las caras, se ven las caras, vay, pero nunca el corazón

Del plovo venimos todos y ahi regresaremos como dice la canción

Se ven las caras, se ven las caras, vay, pero nunca el corazón

Recuerda que el plastico se derrite, si la de de lleno el sol

Se ven las caras, se ven las caras, vay, pero nunca el corazón

Se ven las caras, se ven las caras, vay, pero nunca el corazón

Estudia, trabaja y se gente primero alli está la salvación

Se ven las caras, se ven las caras, vay, pero nunca el corazón

Pero que mira mira no te dejes confundir, busca el fondo y su razón

Se ven las caras, se ven las caras, vay, pero nunca el corazón

Pa' lante, pa' lante, pa' lante, pa' lante, pa' lante
Y asi seguiremos unidos y al final venceremos

Se ven las caras, se ven las caras, vay, pero nunca el corazón

Pero señoras y señores, en medio del plastico 
También se ven las caras de esperanza
Se ven las caras que trabajan por una 
Latinoamerica uniday por un mañana de esperanza y de libertad",Plástico,1996

A felicidade é como a pluma 
Que o vento vai levando peloar
Voa tao leve Mas tem a vida breve       
Precisa que haja vento sem parar...

A felicidade do pobre parece 
A grande ilusao do carnaval, 
A gente trabalha o ano inteiro
Por um momento de sonho 
Pra fazer a fantasia
 
de rei, ou de pirata, ou jardineira 
E tudo se acabar na quarta feira
Tristeza nao tem fim Felicidade, sim...
A felicidade é como a gota de orvalho 
Numa pétala de  flor
Brilha tranqüila Depois de leve oscila     
E cai como uma lágrima de amor
A minha felicidade está sonhando 
Nos olhos da minha namorada
E como esta noite 
Passando, passando 
Em busca da madrugada 
Falem baixo por favor
Pra que ela acorde alegre como o dia   
Oferecendo beijos de amor 
Tristeza nao tem fim

I'll nock you from your feets
I'll bring my wii to up defences

Come give your soul to me
I'll take control of all your senses

What's up dog? 
What you need nigga?
Aw shit one time!

It was once said by a man who couldn't quit
Dopeman please can I have another hit
The Dopeman said cluck i don't give shit
If you girl kneel down, and suck my dick
Gave a nigga head, and homie tried to choke her
but he didn't care, cause she ain't nothing but a smoker
that's the way it go, that's the name of the game
Young niggas gettin over by slangin caine
Lex around my wrist in 18K heaven
Bitches clockin on my dick twenty four seven
Plus I'm makin' money, keepin baseheads waitin
Roll the six four with all gold Daytons
Live in Inglewood, California, CA.
This oozy up your ass if i don't get paid
Niggas beggin for credit, I'm knockin out teeth
Clockin much dollars on the first and fifteenth
Big wad a money, nothing less than a twenty
Yo you want to whole chicken, Mack 10 got plenty
To be a dopeman, boy you must qualify
don't get high off your own supply
From a Key to a G, Its all about money
Ten piece for a ten, base pipe come free 
If people out there not hip to the fact
If you see somebody gettin money for crack
he's the..

Chorus
Dopeman, Dopeman (Mack front me a sack)
Dopeman, Dopeman (I'll get ya back)
Dopeman, Dopeman (tryna stack me a grip)
Dopeman, Dopeman (Man fuck that shit)

You need a nigga with money, so you get a Dopeman
Juice that fool for as much as you can
She like his car, and he get with her
Got a black eye, Cause the Dopeman hit her
Let that slide, and you pay it no mine
Find that he's slappin you all the time
But that's okay,  cause he's so rich
And you ain't nothing but the Dopeman's bitch
Do what he say, and you keep your mouth shut
Talkin' that drag might get ya fucked up
You sit and cry, If the Dopeman strike you
He don't give a fuck, he got two just like you
There's another girl in the Dopeman's life
Not quite a bitch, but far from a wife
She call a Strawberry, and everyone knows....
Strawberry, Strawberry is the neighborhood hoe
Do anything for a hit or two, give a bitch a rock
She fuck the whole damn crew
It might be your wife and it might make you sick
Come home and see her mouth on the Dopeman's dick
Strawberry, just look and you'll see her
But don't fuck around, she'll give you Ghonorea
If people out there, not hip to the fact
Strawberry is a girl, sellin pussy for crack
to the..

Chorus
Dopeman, Dopeman (From a ounce to a key)
Dopeman, Dopeman (Tryna get this chesse)
Dopeman, Dopeman (Cluckers riding my dick)
Dopeman, Dopeman (Man fuck that shit)

If you smoke caine, you a stupid motherfucker
Know around the hood as the schoolyard clucker
Doing that crack with all the money you got
On your hands and knees searchin for a piece of rock
Fienin for a hit, and you lookin for more
Done stole a Alpine out of Wavy six four
Smokin like a train, man I wouldn't want to be you
Done took from the homies, betta run, when i see you
Ballin everyday, doing more drug deals
Rollin' round town, on the twenty inch wheels
If people out there, not hip to the fact
if you see Mack 10, you can ask me for crack
I'm the...

Chorus
Dopeman, Dopeman (Yeah that's me)

Tic-toc around the clock, for the rock ya come see me
Just knock at the door I'll grant your wish like a genie
Straight out to get paid, stack the loot that I made
Been slangin' dope out my mamas' house since the 10th grade

Never tried it can't deny it in the tiots was a looter
Used to hang with drive by shooters, stick 'em up for Honda scooters
Never was a scholar, make you throw yo hands and holla
Wolla went to Jr. high slangin' joints for a dollar

Finger waves was the new fad, so they spotted a due rags
Niggas got dumped on for the red or blue rags
Down with the G's so them niggas never serve me
Bellin' through the hood in my honeycomb Jersey

Painter pants cuffed so I fix it on my biscuits
Til' my hair get long enough to braid, my bitch I'll keep it twisted
It's that nigga runnin' wild punch the pedal to the meadow
And everywhere I go it's a must, I keep it ghetto

24/7 on a 211 fresh out the county, I hunt like a bounty
From 10 to midnight make sure my shit tight
Map out the lick right, so that I hit right

I strike to stay alive to be exact, need a sack
Can't hack this monkey on my back
So I shot it, now you plot it, I got it
Exotic to erotic money hoes to narcotics

No preachin' knowledge of self or religion
I'm too busy raisin' pitbulls and pigeons
Put the hustle down steady for the summer
I'm ready way tighter, got two birds and a rider

But I'm out for mo nigga can't get enough doe
Place my hands on the 4-4
Arm robbery is my hobby
So I gotta sick 'em then lick 'em

Got the plaque in the back, straight rag top
Peepin' the scene with the gangsta lean
Super clean in and out, make you weak at the knees

Stereo type for life from the streets where the palms trees sway
And the money parlay
For block niggas got the hoes like sewed up
Bitches on my nuts every since I first showed up

BG nigga with my though skins hangin'
Tryin' to look like my big homies that was bangin'
Slangin' like 90, goin' north with the cavey
Twistin' through the hood in a 83 caddy

Coupe Deville I packs my big still
Cause it's sittin' on white ones with the two way tight ones
And as I floss I keeps my nina Ross
Cocked with the clippin' to catch a nigga slippin'

Mack 10,"Quietly I stalk niggas call me the Chicken Hawk
Approach with my gun in a 2-1-1 
As I sick'em lay my victim may I lick'em 
All action stop nobody move no pop 
As I wreck shop red alert make yo blood squirt 
When I work in the brownies and the high top chucks to do dirt 

Keep it sound put it down my way 
Protected by an A.K. as I search for my pray 
Through the ghetto hit the peddle every corner I'm turning 
Look for the money the kilos and the gallons of shermin nigga 
Till we meet I stash my heat 
Neat in my baggage do damage nasty as a savage 
Looking for the cabbage 

It's on 20 grand I spot a bird in hand 
As I spread my wing span I swoop ready to land 
Got to get him, hit the spot grab the sack 
And I shake it blessed with the game 
To make it bus its easier to take it, nigga 

[Chorus]
I'm a chicken hawk hunting for a chicken 
Sticking, my hit to ya brain with the cane, nigga 
I'm a chicken hawk hunting for a chicken 
Sticking, my hit to ya brain with the cane, nigga 

""Don't make me kill everybody on this motherfucker"" 

On a late night creep the hawk sours on a mission 
Mashing through the hood heard this nigga had the chickens 
36 zones in each sack to be exact 
Got 50 G's or more in street value worth of crack 

As he put it down out of control with the cavey 
Got Benzos on the grass twisting front and back Cadi's 
Cappuccino instead of coffee moet 
No more rossie, rolex diamonds all glossy 
Glossy, Mr. Flossy 

Sewed up the block keys to double up rock 
I gotta lick him, nigga won't know what hit him when I get him 
Shoot straight never hesitate fools cooperate 
Or I drag, tag them body bag'em with my magnum 

Heat in yo chest how we do it in the west 
I gaffle up yo dope and fly back to my nest 
I stalk hit up in chalk all over the sidewalk 
Its Mack 10 fo' life better know as the chicken hawk 



Interlude: 

Man: Allo 

Mack 10: Yeah nigga, I got yo bitch, so take all the ??? you got and put on ??? behind the ??? or I kill this motherfucker 

Girl: Fuck this nigga don't give any shit 

Mack 10: Bitch shut the fuck up right now 


On a midnight flight the hawk glides through the breeze 
Pull my wings at ease as I lands in the palm trees 
Overlook my lick set my scope like a sniper 
Hawk the bitch piper be alarmed for the type a fool 

That I hoot ride when he do ride 
I came ruff out the box Inglewood school of hard knots, nigga 
A gaffle dick is all I ever gave a hoe 
Where peneltons not a cape so I can't save a hoe 

Mack 10 just stepped off the planet of the apes 
Foe the money and dope I never rapes I duck tapes 
Bitches I mack'em down flag'em down they pull over 
Feel lucky as a four leaf clover in a Range Rover 

They never know its the hawk his self 
My eyes redder than red with St. Ides on my breath 
I draw down all this licking got me nervous so I'm twitching
Bitch two to the dome or take me to yo nigga chickens

Yeah you're the kind of nigga that ??? with your bitch

Mack 10,"Verse 1

Mack 10 nutty as they come 
leave 'em face down
and numb from the waist down
It's a Sunday a gun day
rollin' down a one way
in my 'lac front and back
over train tracks
On yak and herb nigga swerve
it get's on my nerves
banked my Danas on the curb
In the gutta lane
I'm butta man
Foot to the flo'
what you want from the sto'
I'm broke as a muthafucka nigga buy my single
comin' from Ingle (Foe Life) is my jingle
Seen yo' bitch at the sto' coulda took her
but niggas start to handcuff they hoes like T.J. Hooker
Fool I'ma vet you can bet
that I can dance underwater and not get wet
It's the nappy headed nigga that can kill and rap
everybody run when I bust a cap
puttin' Inglewood up on the map
look at what I do when I pull my strap
Bust 2 rounds nigga about to clown
bitch hit the silent alarm it's goin' down

Chorus

Foe life foe life

Verse 2

Khacki suit ski mask is my attire
with my luck cut my chucks on the barbed wire
Fool where ya keep the rims and tires
'fo yo' life expires I'm as nutty as Michael Myers
Didn't think about the Rottweiler
a lot of stiches in the ass
blood in the Impala
Sittin' in the County with a gold record
Ice Cube send me pictures of bitches naked
caught with a contraband in my hand
Mack 10 take the stand
your Honor I'ma changed man
so please let me go so I can flow
Got a show had to ask my P.O. can I go
and if he say no I'ma have to say
bitch get out the car slow
and leave ya fuckin' dough
'cause a nigga gotta eat fuck the world
let the bullets hurl and feed my baby girl

Chorus

Verse 3

Call 911 there's a son of a bitch on the roof
yarned up in his birthday suit
(Mack 10 to the rescue)
my momma want to know why I do what I do
'cause I'm superman superbad supermad superfly
fool you can die
There's gonna be a lot of cars with they lights on
and I'm at home sewing stripes on
Cause I'm the General and you's a stowaway
'bout to buck you down with this throw away
with no serial number it's the summer
where niggas die
It's hotter than July
You better stay low fo' you get a halo
plus wings and a gown when I come around
So take 10 paces
and try to guess the color of my shoelaces

Bust a right turn 12 dollar motel
'Cause in the hood that's the best a nigga get

But hurry up shit cause we only got an hour
And I plan to be in it up to win it a good 45 minutes
And break that back down

You won't believe all the wreak I'm catching
I'm hard as a brick and my rubber is stretching
See a motel bed can take a pounce
When you give it more bounce to the ounce
And I'm feeling it from the way I'm hung
And I'm killing it I might puncture a lung
Now the Mozi-Wozi is the place for chillin'
But the bathroom towels ain't worth stealin'
The T.V.'s broke and the carpet is dirty
And you got till about 12:30
To have yo ass out
But don't fuck around and get drunk and pass out
Cause before I can finish this rhymes
You hear a buzzer and a bitch yealen check out time

But on some shit you got to let 15-8's twist
Chevy trucks and 'em
El Caminos anybody want Danas i got them for eight ??????
All day long
Gold or all chrome it's on
You out to get 'em cause the tires come with 'em
but they ain't for busters only hogs roll D's
So keep yo' stocks on if you can't fade these
Thousand in my pocket, yayo I rock it
Keep my lond clean so the car hops can jock it hit the switch up and down
Make the bumper drag the ground on the 'Shaw
Every Sunday night just to clown on them thangs

Get the hammer
Be sure that yo strap ain't a jammer and as long
As ain't nuthin' wrong then beat I'm on
As I watch for the lick i got the switch to make me hit
Front back side to side and three wheel shit
Won't hesitate to let loose niggas broke the gang truce
But I still roll my deuce that hang like a noose
It don't stop for Mack, it's the same ol' same ol'
Danas gold as I lay low, twisting like a tornado 
in that surplus gear like the G of the year
Fuck the hour, it's all about the money and the power
Ain't about set trippin' no bloodin' no crippin'
Just dippin' hittin' switches knockin' hood rat bitches
As I'm rollin' out of control and smoking humps
Crank up the bumptie bumps 4 gates and square
Dumps so I bang it, make the 20's slide when I swang it
Lick it once lick it twice as nice 
when I hang it on them thangs  

D's I'm on 'em 
Killas they want 'em
On them thangs...

Old Chevy's to Cadillacs on twisters and Doves
Everybody got a plaque given pub to they car club
Mafia for life individuals and Damus Ride
Majestics and them niggas from the southside
New school to old school get they ride on
Bendin' corners caravaning like 50 strong
In a Rag Top that and a hard top this
Bustin ho's cause you can't miss if you let 'em twist
So get you a set of them what we call Dana's
And see for yo'self all the bitches they brang us

And everthang is straight I'm in the full zone
Gettin paper every day, it's all I'm trippin on
Cause ain't nothin like a ride in Californ-ia
with the top back, rollin on a hot sunny day
It's one-oh, fo'-sho', and I'm clownin all the rookies
With a pocket full of cookies
and mashin to the backyard boogie

Get yo' boogie on [repeat 3X]
And then we comin wit that

Chorus:

Verse Two:

Now just throw yo hands up high in the sky
Representin where you from cause it's West till I die
Put it down anywhere, take thangs for what they worth
been a rider since birth, and the earth is my turf
So I bails in the party, everythang is cool
It's niggaz in the hood I ain't seen since high school
And everybody gots stripes cause we all paid dues
Crips, Damus, and other clicks and crews
Just gettin they boogie on, hoochie bitches gettin loose
It kinda remind me of the truce in nine-deuce
I'm even kickin back, and I'm usually chicken hawkin
The bloods shootin dice, and the crips are see walkin
Now the party is jumpin, and the crowd's gettin bigger
Looked up and saw four hoes to every nigga
And it's off the hook, got ya grindin and humpin
Cause the backyard boogie be bumpin

(Unh, straight from Inglewood, and you know that it's all good
 You can put that on yo' hood, everyday
 And we comin with that)

Chorus

Verse Three

Now it's out of control, and everywhere you look
ain't nothin but real niggaz, the bustas got shook
And everybody left with the whole hustla bang
and Daisy Dukes and khakis do seem to be the thang
You choose or you lose while you conversatin
enough cock to go around, so ain't no playa hatin
I want homegirl over there in red
cause Baby Got Backs like Mix-a-Lot said
When I keep my composure, kick back like a pro
Cause Mack one-oh just refuse to save a hoe
But it's a done deal, locked up throw away the key
Cause she gonna lead a backyard boogie with me
(Get yo' boogie on, yeah
 Get yo' boogie on, Inglewood
 Get yo' boogie on, Inglewood, pause
 Get yo' backyard boogie on)

Chorus

Straight from Inglewood, and you know that it's all good
You can put that on yo' hood, everyday

Get yo' boogie on, get yo' boogie on
Get yo' boogie on, nigga get yo' boogie on
Get yo' boogie on, get yo' boogie on baby, pause

Mack 10,"Newscaster: In the news tonight rap star Mack 10 releases his second
solo album titled ""Based On A True Story,"" and according to reliable
sources Ha, he laughs in the face of the sophomore jinx. After the 
release of Westside Connection and Mack's new record, gangster rap
seems to be at an all time high.

Verse 1
Either the thrill of victory or the agony of defeat
you either got ends or struggle to make ends meet
You can either turn square or keep the mind of a rebel
some uppity livin' good some faced with death in the ghetto
I'm a product of the streets so I vow to never slip
so I trust no one and keep a P. Coltrane on my hip
I always paid attention while my O.G's was teachin'
Rule number one if it's on blast the first nigga reachin'
either death or the pen' shit I had to do better
It was a must I moved on and now I'm all about cheddar
a young entrepreneur I rather slang than bang
now girls be like you go Mack 10 baby do yo thang
So I continue to get down and I keep writin' rhymes
and I parlay every dollar to flip at least a hundred times
So keep your game tight and it's all fame and glory
and everything I recite's Based On A True Story

Chorus 
You can feel nigga
It's based on a true story
You know it's real nigga
Based on a true story

Verse 2
The year 1986 is when it all started
now eleven years later we still rough and cold hearted
and as the saga continues I ride the wave like a Sea Doo
not to knock hip hop but gangsta rap is what we do
Niggas on they first album
already sold a mil'
So before you knock our style
at least admit that it's real
It's all sex drugs and violence
so you pretend you ain't checkin'
You mean to tell me people
really ain't dyin' every second
Now y'all made the rules
niggas can say what they choose
So if you gone ban Gangsta rap
then you got to ban the news
That means no weather report
no Waco and the bad reverand
No channel 4 channel 7 and no film at eleven
With no high school diplomas we became millionaires
media mad 'cause we winning and we really playin' fair
So keep your game tight and it's all fame and glory
and everything I recite's Based On A True Story

Chorus

Verse 3
I crumble green on a magazine
ready to roll a joint
damn in this billboard
I'm number one with a hollow point
It was a rough road ahead
but for my kids I gotta pave it
so I twist one shake the weed out
close the book up and save it
'Cause my son li'l Mack
might grow up and have a crew
and he can show all his homies
this what my daddy used to do
See I was raised around gangstas
and grindas since a youth
so the shit I rap abouts like 99% truth
With dedicated fans from bebe kids
to bambinos and niggas that's CEO's
before they reach they three O's
Maneuver through the corporate world
makin' moves to take ours
Rolling big German luxury and Italian sports cars
so watch what you do 'cause you know we playa hated
and everytime it's a homicide they call it gang related
So keep your game tight and it's all fame and glory
and everything I recite's Based On A True Story

Chorus (2X)

Too $hort talking: Say Mack baby, it's yo pa'tna $hort dog man.
You know I got yo back boy. You know a nigga like me I just left
the Ferrarri dealer man. I ain't go lie I know you ridin' rims.
But the problem is, it's a lot of mothafuckas out there that think we

The Dopeman said cluck i don't give shit
If you girl kneel down, and suck my dick
Gave a nigga head, and homie tried to choke her
but he didn't care, cause she ain't nothing but a smoker

Young niggas gettin over by slangin caine

Bitches clockin on my dick twenty four seven
Plus I'm makin' money, keepin baseheads waitin
Roll the six four with all gold Daytons
Live in Inglewood, California, CA.

Niggas beggin for credit, I'm knockin out teeth
Clockin much dollars on the first and fifteenth
Big wad a money, nothing less than a twenty
Yo you want to whole chicken, Mack 10 got plenty
To be a dopeman, boy you must qualify

You need a nigga with money, so you get a Dopeman
Juice that fool for as much as you can
She like his car, and he get with her
Got a black eye, Cause the Dopeman hit her
Let that slide, and you pay it no mine
Find that he's slappin you all the time
But that's okay,  cause he's so rich
And you ain't nothing but the Dopeman's bitch
Do what he say, and you keep your mouth shut
Talkin' that drag might get ya fucked up
You sit and cry, If the Dopeman strike you
He don't give a fuck, he got two just like you
There's another girl in the Dopeman's life
Not quite a bitch, but far from a wife
She call a Strawberry, and everyone knows....
Strawberry, Strawberry is the neighborhood hoe
Do anything for a hit or two, give a bitch a rock
She fuck the whole damn crew
It might be your wife and it might make you sick
Come home and see her mouth on the Dopeman's dick
Strawberry, just look and you'll see her
But don't fuck around, she'll give you Ghonorea

On your hands and knees searchin for a piece of rock
Fienin for a hit, and you lookin for more

Smokin like a train, man I wouldn't want to be you
Done took from the homies, betta run, when i see you

Hey hey hey
What you got to say

Verse 1
Fast bitches fast cars money and fame
this rap shit is just like the '90's dope game
Before sold out shows rocked and hoes jocked
it was all about the 'hood and that Foe Hundred block
A few scraps as a puppy dog
you had to be down
to roam that infamous neighborhood
where niggas wore the crown
It was on every morning from Manchester to Century
BG's walkin' in packs to elementary
afterschool some had 'hood patrol
and watched deals on the corner
while others had skills and hittin' drills in Pop Warner
The unforgettable good old days how it used to be
'foe niggas made the transition from a jock to a G
now the streets is nice but the police is thick
'cause niggas sick and mo' murders
committed than a horror flick
but whatever happen rappin' or not
it's the same for me
it's still I.N.G. foe L.I.F.E.
so...

Chorus
Hey hey heyy
What you got to say
Inglewooooood 
Inglewood Swangin' 

Verse 2
The city's full of cheddar like a cheese pizza
known for senoritas and Inglewood Familias
The landmarks in the 'hood is legendary
the fabulous Forum, the Court and the Library
The city hall is scandalous to the average tax payer
so the town done fucked around and voted me the mayor
had G's that put they life on the line and some died
but thanks to this rap we on the map worldwide
And as far as race go we probably even these days
about 50% black and the rest is esays
so we spin and we win up and down Market St.
Bitch I'm a million dollar nigga and still shop the Swapmeet
what I'm in right now probably ain't worth a hundred bucks
a beany T-shirt khakis and a fresh pair of Chucks
That's a real nigga foe you that's me so don't knock it
I got everything I need plus money in my pocket
So...

Chorus

Bridge
I.N.G. foe L.I.F.E. (4X)

Verse 3
It seem like yesterday I was the average Y.G.
and at the blink of a eye became a household MC
From the land of sunshine gold D's and palm trees
to Japanese screamin' for a nigga overseas
But I gotta think about O.G's I got game from
remain the same nigga and can't forget where I came from
We all know money make the world go 'round
so I give back to my town and put a few niggas down
I keep my enemies close 'cause they salt shakers
mad because I travel state to state
and get paid like the Lakers
Used to like the Magic man when I was a itty bitty
but now Mack and Shaq can go half and buy the city
So...

Relax facin' facin' mind bogglin' hallucinations 
Easy does it til the skull get your lungs full 
Take a deep ??? sit back 'cause Mack 
got that bu yow shit that get'cha higher than wick whack 
Is hard as stone alone it's always on 
Never home grown totin 'cause the streets made me potent 
Down since '84 now live for '95 
Got it swingin' while some niggas bangin' I'm dope slangin' 
for my everyday expenses, know the consequences 
The bigger the sack, the bigger the sentence 
No time for repentance, put it down 
count the stripes that I tally 
Runnin' backstreets and alleys through Inglewood, Cali 
So back the fuck up, don't act the fuck up 
Never slip from the hit 
Triple-six in the clip when I trip 
So busters beware, never dare to have quams 
with that nigga Mack 10 full of ghetto ass bombs 
Take a hit

Can you feel it nigga? Nothin' can save ya 
Roll ya papers and take a heel on my shit 

Get'cha high like a rocket, loot in my pocket 
Mean like the green, bomb like the chocolate

Dirty ass Lynch Mob crew, new voodoo 
Cast a killer, cap peeler, hang with gorillas 
Tragic when you catch it, runnin from my magic 
TAADOW! New Jackin' got it crackin' like Nino's 
Stackin' like casinos, bomb like the primos 
Make your crack dough black, attack like karate 
Always beamed up like Scotty, I control your body 
leave ya numb, redrum, slug like a Dodger 
Nothin' bomber than this Westside ghetto ganga 
Hundred proof pure dopeness and it seems 
heavy as a Chevy, too much for a triple beam 
Fiend for the microphone, one pop ya drop 
And it don't stop, I can't stop

Got that one-hitter quitter shit so take a whiff 
Need a torch to light my spliff, work the late night shift 
Get my drift? Had it sewed up ever since I showed up 
Cookin' up boulders, got a crew fulla soldiers 
Claimin' be	's, claimin' see's, everybody Gs 
Went from laces to Deez, from mo' see's to ki's 
What you need guaranteed to whip and leave ya trippin' 
like your sane, I sippin', funky germ dippin' 
Make you tweak, lose sleep, I creep like a phantom 
Ran em then I win em, all up in em like venom 
Got the lotions, slow motion, hit the magic potion 
Don't panic, satanic, devotions, convulsions 
Wipe your whole crew out, niggas get blew out 
Hides behind a stockin' while the bomb's tick-tockin' 
Keep rockin' and it don't quit, it's Mack 10 the shit

Now when I come to y'all hood, y'all watch my back
And when ya come to Inglewood I'm a front you a sack
So we can grind and get away with the cash like a caper
Cause it ain't about the set-trip, it's all about the paper
Made the poverty cease, on the rise like yeast
A parvay lex piece, and I keep my khaki's creased
Mack 10 is the lick, and ya know what my set be
Connect gang from the west, nigga, where the best be

It ain't no questions asked
You down to blast for me?
Down to ride for me?
Down to die for me?
I come through for these sucker-ass niggas who rep
Come creeping up on shorty slowly, show him death
Pull out the Mack 90 automatic for static
Blast a couple of niggas, leave em all panicked
We swerve and hit the curb, smoke some herb
We came up too much, and too tough, and too grub

Where ya gun, nigga?
Show em where you're from, nigga
Riding-ass young nigga
Arsenal equipped, hot enough to scorch
With the double fours on the hip rolling with the force
He's out to catch a body
Talking, but I thought this was a gangsta party
Now he's walking around smarter
Now he's about to see, talking about who's jumping
I'm about to get the pump to pumping and start dumping on something

And wave em all around like ya just don't care
We're riding dope, so, nigga, act like ya savvy

I'm serving niggas like a host with the pound so take a toast
Dog, this west coast and our shit bump the most
Cause vine to vine I swing through the woods of Ingle
And everything I make, fuck around and be a single
From the who banging hit, to the yes, yes, y'alls
Now all down my halls, got plaques on my walls
We might slow the roll, sit back and still kick it
But the shit don't stop till we hit a meal ticked

[Dat Nigga Daz]
I'll be god damned
I'm in it for a meal ticket
And the goal's successful
I don't know who to prove a show
Usual swerve a corner and hit a block back-to-back
Y'all don't know us like that,
Where the gang-banger's hang at
They ""Daz, are you a rider?""
I reply ""Boy, hell yeah, I'm a rider!""

Leave you in Reece's Pieces, rolling in white cornices
Knocking out teethes, I know where we can get the blackheads cheapest
From my homie down the street on the block
He copping everything from Desert Eagles down to them mini-Glocks
If niggas fuck off the money we raise the murder stats
Me and my nigga Mack 10 committing terrorist acts
You see us bailing don't mumble under your breath
Have the heart to say fuck you so I can put five in your chest nigga

And since my last LP they start calling me Mack Manson
Now when I come around punks know they're gone
? my pistol around and fall straight into a coma
So take if you want it that's my number one motto
Hitting licks like the lotto, with a four-five bottle
And assault rifles like Rambo full of ammo
Dump a nigga in his chest and watch him bleed through his flesh
? chicken hawking
You kill a nigga, you kill his bitch so she can't talk
So I smoked the bitch and made it simple
I put one in her temple and got horny as a nympho
So with a hard dick and guns, a bad bitch dies
I take my two fingers and then I slowly close her eyes

Mack 10,"Intro: Cube
In every game, we gotta have the brains and the muscle
The game and the hustle... to be real on these streets
So here you have it, the Brainiac
 Ice Cube
With the Maniac
 Mack 10

Mack & Cube: Yay-why-yay! X2
Verse One
Ice Cube:
While ya`ll niggas think about the pap¨¦
I think about which Titanic I`mma sink
The iceberg, with the nice words
I slice verbs and predicets, ghetto etiquette
Y`all better get, this dime-mega shit
The Braniac, the theory be conspiracy
Keep my eye on the birdie, but never get my hands dirty
Verbally call the Maniac and his attack dogs
Signing contracts with automatic jack clause

Mack 10:
I get full of their shit and take flight on these niggas
`Bout to show these so-called
Wig-splitters and nigg-hitters
Who the man be, and what the number one clique is
Let my nuts hang on these busts
And hoes see how big my dick is
Maniac Mack 10 always keep the heat toted
And teflon tips keep the .44 loaded 
Straight quoted in nine-trey, by the dime
Now we connected
He said, ""Mack, when you westsidin` and ridin` is expected""
So I...

Chorus
Cube: Maniac with Brainiac, Mack 10!
Mack: You do the drivin`, while I do the jackin`
Cube: Maniac with Brainiac, Mack 10!
Mack: My nigga if you plot it, best believe I got it
Mack: And it`s on... feel the chrome

Verse 2
Ice Cube:
You in the Stargate, trying t`escape, it`s not an option
Got torture techniques for them lies, don`t ever lie
Just put the car in drive, we can go ride- get this money
Determined as the Energized Bunny, make a left
Underground parking, guns start sparkin`
ATF enemies all around start chargin`
Tryin` to fuck up my new suit and my weekend
Ask me what you want, you bitch! I ain`t speakin`

Mack 10:
Shit, I gives a fuck what the next nigga think
(?) gives a fuck how much bitch you say you ain`t
It`s like this on mine, potna
By all means, I got the ball
So it`s your life, not mine nigga, so you make the call
Now, I can blow your brains out, punk and act the fuckin` fool
Or you can hand your guns over, and let everything be cool
But know this: I won`t hesitate to peel your wig back
I`m off that wet-bomb and the whole fifty yak
It`s Mack the Maniac, nigga

Chorus
Verse 3
Ice Cube:
What`s the plan? Everything thought out
Everything bought out, like Bill Gates
My niggas love steel weights
I`m still great, after 12 muthafuckin` years
I (?) your ass after 12 muthafuckin` beers
I act kind to my peers and everybody that listen
They know when the Brainiac`s missin`
The big fish, hanging with the chicken hawk
Got all the haters, claimin` that they want to talk

Mack 10:
You argue wit `em and negotiate, and I really want to kill `em
I`m tired of the bullshit, man I really want to peel `em
Dog, I knew they were scareless
`Cause my brother Snoop told us
So fuck the money and the dope that they punk-ass owe us
Now when I see `em, it ain`t no question it`s all the way on
But I`mma wait in front of they momma house
For that one nigga to get home
And when I gun, watch his body jump
And it`s all going to amaze me
To see his own self
Layin` there with his own brains on the pavement

Play us by the trigger so I`ma live by the trigger
And rivals, seven bitches for all my hoodlum and thug niggas

Got turned out early by them scandalous freaks
Addicted to crime so I stay in the mix
With a love for hoochie chicks and pulling jewelry licks
Moms said, ""Mack, baby watch for danger""
I said, ""Momma don't you know I'm a real gang banger?""
I can't switch over night and be good
And I'll be damned if a nigga turned his back on the hood
So I walked out the door, hopped in the Regal
Twisting triple gold with the all black eagle
Got a deuce fired at Scoob's, I need a gat
So I stopped and got the Tech from my G homie Wreck
He said, ""Mack, don't slip dog, u gotta stay heated
And here's the extra clip incase you might need it""

More bounce to the ounce and I'm clowning
Keep the gat in my lap cause I'm fully strapped
For the car jackers, but no haps cause I pack a
Tech 9, plus a A-K 47
Send a one way ticket to my hell or maybe heaven

That silly nigga's wearing vest's but we aim for the temple
Watch my nigga's back, who sacked the yayo
Keep the calico with extra ammo
So and so gets blasted, to the casket

[Mack 10] 

This song is dedicated 

to all the up and coming rappers  singers  hustlers  actors 

Whatever you may be remember: 

without no struggle  you get no progress 

So keep grindin  keep on mashin  get yours 



Chorus: Gerald Levert 



You're nothin far from comin up (keep on) 

Money's just a touch away (keep on) 

So keep on grindin don't give it up (keep on) 

There'll always be another day (keep on) 



[Mack 10] 

And now I'm sittin at the pad, teary eyed and depressed 

Starvin and sufferin from mental stress 

Now a true center to the game of beginner 

but hard to feel like a winner when you eat spreads for dinner 

Hit the streets late night in the form of star mushin 

On the 211 mission just to pay tuition 

For my kids I got to grind and develop street saavy 

Servin stress cause I just ain't got enough to cop cavi 

But I can't stop, I won't stop, til I got it made 

Either build my clientele, get a job or learn a trade 

like hip-hop, and make enough to live good forever 

So I learned to write the rhymes and get my metaphors together 

Then I joined a rap crew, with the homies on my street 

Sellin underground tapes out the local swap meet 

Gettin tighter on the mic, as I worked day to day 

So now I lay down at night, and I hear voices say, ""Mack"" 



Chorus 



[Mack 10] 

Now I'm new to the scene, H as in Hard, N as in Nympho 

So like EPMD, could you _Please Listen to My Demo?_ 

I left the local crew, felt like I was the man 

In popular demand and now ready for SoundScan 

So I searched for a deal with no luck I kept rappin 

Felt like it would take a miracle to make it all happen 

Marble said it was a test, ""Mack don't do nuttin wrong! 

Just have faith in God and keep your hustle goin strong 

Stay hongry, keep writin, don't quit you're too close 

Remember good things come to those who want it most"" 

So I never left the house, without my rap book 

Thought I found a new crew but eventually got shook 

First they said I was cool, but then started to doubt me 

Put me on the backburner and just forgot all about me 

Partna said I wasn't fresh, and sent me on my way, but you know what? 

As I was leavin, I could hear voices say, ""Mack"" 



Chorus 



[Mack 10] 

Now the tables turned, but I remember they used to clown me 

The hard work paid off, and luck finally found me 

So call every publication, Billboard and the editor 

and tell em Mack's being signed by dude workin on _The Predator_ 

I got the Midas touch, now everything be the bomb 

Hooked up with The Don, now made a few mill-ion 

I don't bang I write the good rhymes, you know about mines 

Man I'm the tightest MC, Ice Cube ever signed 

Now if ain't the radio, it's a video shoot 

Livin life in the limelight, with a bank full of loot 

Now my crew is solid, shook the haters and the leeches 

Runnin full court at my house with our girls on the beaches 

Plus the violence is ceased, no more bi-coastal beef 

Cause now I get down with the North South and the East 

I reminisce on hard times, seem like yesterday, but now 

Hoo Bangin' is official and I remember they used to say, ""Mack""

Money's just a touch away.. 

Money's just a touch, just a simple touch 

Money's just a touch away..

Feel the wrath of a nigga who bust
Makin my clique the shit, bitches want to discuss

In this, in my vein, ain't no way I can control it
When this inside of me is as deadly as them niggas
You know the ones who killed them boys and dumped the body in the river
I enter the place, ski mask covered my face

Checkin' through my rearview with my hand on my heat 
'Cause hatas can't stand to see a nigga doin' good 
But fuck Hollywood I'm a still bang the 'hood 
Gettin' my stalk on walk on loc I'm all about the paper 
Hoppin' out the Navigator with braids & Chucks Taylors 
A regulator scopin' the field like a commentator 
Dodgin' investigators haters & salt shakers 
The cookie baker the 64 pancaker

Tippin' nobellas cause loc we's all about the Cheddar

Bounce baby baby bounce baby baby bounce 
To them outta town niggas I still got 'em 9 an ounce 
Can't rely on no label to send my kids to college 
So after I rock the spot meet me in the parking lot 
Now call it what you want but the game got me cheese 
With bitches on my dick since my last CD 
I went from young black & broke bro' to dub the inevitable 
Turnin' over three decimals bangin' the oyster perpetual 
Let it go rags to riches buckets to Phillies 
I went from no dough to mo' dough 
To still gettin' these switches 
I'm wicked for digits forgive me God for the truth 
But I fiends for Cheddar like a smoker with a sweet tooth 
Got game from Legit & 40 see Mac & Short 
Cube told me the key to it all is to keep hustlin' loc 
Put your family first & the rest will endeavor 
Stay focused & forever we can get this Cheddar

It's the curse of money, once you get it, fool you got it
Buy a new pair of drawers and motherfuckers spot it
Niggas plotted, to have me knotted up in basements
till these cocksuckers see what they're faced with
Their fantasies of a life stress-free
Full of orgies, in the Florida Keys
But this bullshit is so thick, it's like mountains
Sick of threatenin all my lawyers and accountants
The decibals, gold diggers goin for the testicles
Soon they realise, I don't invest in hoes
Sometimes it's like hell on earth
When everybody tryin to get your ass for all your worth

When you hot, they think you got more than you got
When you not, motherfuckers callin you a flop
I just laugh, the curse everybody want to have
Before you sell your soul better do the math

I start to scream shit like ""May day, may day""
'cause motherfuckers think it's all grav-ay wit my pay day
And like I said, it's the curse of money
They start laughin at your jokes when they ain't that funny (Ha ha ha)
See this ass kissin yes man
Shakin hands with the left hand, get my weap-an, get to stepp-an
Fuck every phony ass nigga round me
Stick a shaft up your ass like Richie Roundtree (Yea yea!)
Got to have some gas money if you goin
If not who you fuckin? Who you flowin? Who you owin?
In '98 don't shit come free
Not even hard rhymes that's describin these hard times

(The curse, the curse) Do the math baby, aha

When you not, motherfuckers callin you a flop
I just laugh (haha), the curse everybody want to have
Before you sell your soul better do the math

To relax I smoke a stick, the shit make me sick
Gotta gang of new homies, and relatives on my dick
No time for drama, busters get sprayed
Bitches want to get laid, and everybody need their bills paid (Everybody)
Motherfuckers, sweat me like a spy
They want to kick it 'cause I, got the curse of mulah
Make me want to start scrappin and look at me to make it happen
What the fuck was they doin before Mack 10 was rappin ?!? Tell me 
(What the fuck?) how can I remain a man of seven figures
when I'm rushed by gold diggers everytime I get bigger? (Ch-ching)
Like David Banner, when I tweak I turn green
And everytime I'm seen it's like people start to fiend
It's the curse

Went to Branson, back to back, Lex coup
Up in ""Harlem World"" in my Timb boots

Two suckers had beef so I watched them shoot
Called up Benny Rat, copped a bullet proof
Seen T-Funk he took is to the fruit
Then he went to the Tunnell and brought down the roof

Mink coats and moet, bitches drippin sweat
Slang a cassette to Funkmaster Flex
And now I'm bumpin' on East Coast tapedecks
Went from Swatch to platinum Rolex

Run wit my niggas that ain't got shit

Pop shit, and peddle poetry for profit
One time, out for mine, but can't stop it
Trying to keep they hands in my pocket
So I bring obnoxious, infected lah that be toxic

Leave the crop scene spotless
Mix the green with the chocolate, here's the topic

I shake that bullshit off [arf arf arf] then go ...
I've been down too long, can't a motherfucker show me nothing
Why'all .. niggas is duckin me like you owe me something
I got more homies than an esse, but lets say

I couldn't talk you wouldn't walk my way on your best day
The best way you can hope to get close to me
Is right here under my wing like you're supposed to be
The first time you start acting fuckin' strange 

Best to be ducking range
Talkin' shit wearing a fuckin' chain

Split em' open like Thomas'

And sell more drugs than a pharmacist
Strapped wit nothing but a rhyme a long history of violent crime

Won't fall tryin' to walk from crawl 
Tryin' to hustle up from broke to ballin'

I got more lime light than Vegas on cable 
Willing enable to shoot, seen nervios at the craps table 
And while you can't get off the ground, I'm getting high 
Fuckin' fly and fly, with desire to build an empire 
I strapped up and took flight like a missile 
Told them loud and clear as a whistle 'Hoo Bangin' is official' 
Handing out gold medallions at roll-call 
I'ma ball and never fall 'cause Mack 10 want it all

Why fall in love with the struggle if the struggle don't love me?
Catchin hell as I bubble, still can't let em above me
People love you, at the same time want to see you crumble
We gon' hustle rain or sunshine, love to see us rumble

[ VERSE 1: Mr. Mike ]
We out the do', you know I got about a ounce or mo'
Rock, bounce through the streets, stop countin my dough
Hoes creepin four deep in a black Benzo
The game's deep, now can you see us, me and Mack One-o?
To hell where some go, a don that's velcro
We bail and bomb while some fail to turn pro
So act like you know, hey hoe, best not doubt me
Niggas don't mob without me, ain't nothin fraud about me
Time tickin, mind spinnin, can you dig these wicked rhymes?
Gettin live, what's the deal with his eyes? Devil I despise
Sniff em out like bloodhounds, lyrically puttin my thug down
Seriously, why'all can hunch now, spiritually we been drugged down
I'm your host now, who's the boss? Niggas get lost and broke down 
Crossed with golden crowns, then you hear me more than now
A million ways to lay the game out
I went without a million days before I came out

[ VERSE 2: Mack 10 ]
I stay stressed out and short with nowhere to turn
I'm out of dope, it's a drought the whole hood is concerned
I gotta take what I want, I never learned how to earn
I pull my heat out and squeeze, yelli, ""burn, baby, burn!""
With no rocks to sack up I wonder who can I jack up
Along with this .44, which other heat should I pack up?
Niggas never been robbed by a guy short in size
If I put a 211 in progress, cooperate or die
Why fall in love with the struggle if the struggle don't love me?
So nigga, why should I watch you hustle off a whole ki?
If I say I want it, hand it over or watch the snub nose flame
The Chicken Hawk got to have it, dog, and that's on everything
Now Mr. Mike (What's up?) You out here ballin these streets
Now front your partner a few ones, until he back on his feet
And that ain't askin for much if that's somethin that you can do
Cause you know if you was short, a nigga'd look out for you

[ VERSE 3: Mr. Mike ]
It's like wakin up to eggs, grits, bacon, and blunts
Girl, what you do in here? Why you still naked and stunt?
(I'm the girl, you're the man, and the sex was fun
I ain't makin this up, nigga, you made me come)
Alright we done, back to the lab without a mic to grab
Can't take this poverty, crews sling
We hoo-bang for the robbbery (Who's game?)
The chosen one, three years old, know how to hold a gun
I'm on the run till I finally find the right one
Mr. Mike, guns and glocks can't stop me
Cause we here tonight, love and props is all I see
Somebody callin me, I'm dealin with these inner feelings
Show my partners the game, a damn shame, they still don't get it
I won't quit it, cause I'm livin life on the edge
Sometimes I feel I'm better off dead

Never shoulda been let out the penatentiory
Mack 10, I'd like to say
That I'm a crazy mothafucka, from around the way
Since I was a youth, I grew weed out
Now I'm the mothafucka that you read about
Selling a ounce or two, that's what the hell I do
You don't like how I'm living, well fuck you!
This is the dope game, and I'm in it
My nigga g, will fuck you up in a minute
With a, right, left, right, left ya toothless
Then you say, god damn they ruthless
Everywhere we go they say ""damn""
It's the connect game, fucking up the programme
Then they realise we don't care
We don't just say no, we to busy saying yeeah!
About drinking, straight out the odd bottle
Do I look like a mothafucking role model ?
Too a kid looking up to me
Life ain't nothing but bitches and money
Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
You fuck with me, I'll put a foot in ya ass
See, I don't give a fuck, cause I keep dealing

Me and my homeboys stepped in the house
All the punk ass niggas started breaking out
Cause you know, they know what's up
So we start looking for the bitches with the big butts
Like her, but she keep crying
""I got a boyfriend"", bitch stop lying
Dumb ass hooker, ain't nothing but a dyke
Suddenly I see, some niggas that I don't like
Walked over to 'em, and said ""what's up ?""
The first nigga that I saw, banged 'em in the jaw
Cube starts stomping 'em with w.C
By that time, got rushed by security
Out the door, but we don't quit
Wait up!, ""let's start some shit""
I got a shot-gun, and here's the plot
Taking niggas out with a flurry of buck shots
Boom! Boom! Boom!, yeah I was gunning
Then you looked, and all you see is niggas running
And falling, and yelling, and pushing and screaming, and cussing
I stepped back, and I kept bussing
Then I realised, it's time for me to go
So I shot, jumped in the vehicle
It's like this, because of that hoo-ride
The hoo-bang niggas, wanted for a homicide
Cause I'm the type a nigga, that's built to last
You fuck with me, I'll put a foot in ya ass
I don't give a fuck, cause I keep dealing
Yo, what the fuck are they yelling ?

""Yo mack, say what the fuck you feeling
And don't hold a damn thing back""

Homies all standing around, just hanging
Some dope dealing, some gang-banging
We decide to roll, and we deep
See a nigga on 20's and we creep
Real slow, and before you know
I had the .44, pointed in the window
He got scared, and hit the gas
Right then, I knew I had to smoke his ass
He kept rollin, I jumped in the bucket
We couldn't catch him, so I said fuck it!
Then we headed right back to the fort
Sweating all the bitches, in the tight-ass shorts
We didn't get no play, from the ladies
With 6 niggas in the coupe, is you crazy ?
She was scared, and then was sure
We all said ""fuck you bitch"", and kept going
To the hood, that we was sent to
Find something else to get into
Like some pussy, or in fact
A bomb rush, but we call it rat-pack
On a nigga, witta hella surprise
Mack 10 will go stupid, when he full on train-eyes
I might stumble, but still won't loose
Now I'm dressed in the county blues
Cause I'm the type a nigga that's built to last
Fuck with me, I'll put a foot in ya ass
See I don't give a fuck, caz I keep dealing
Yo, what the fuck are they yelling ?

Here's a little gangsta short in size
With a t-shirt and levis, as his only disguise
Built like a tank, and hard to hit
Mack 10 and scoop go running shit

Well I'm the nigga scoop, the one they talking about
Nigga tried to roll a dice, and straight cracked out
At least try to roll, it's time to go
I creep away real slow, and jump in the 6-4
With the (diamond in the back; sunroof top)
Digging the scene with the gangstaline
Cause I'm the scoop, I don't slang or bang
I just smoke mothafuckas like it ain't no thang
And to you bitches, you know I'm talking to you
""We wanna fuck you scoop!""
I wanna fuck you too
Cause you see, I really don't take no shit

So let me tell you mothafuckas who you fucking wit

Consist of big-ass parties and sippin gin

County bus rolls through - niggas trips to jail
What the hell won't trade it, high class can't fade it
Out of town trips with pigeons is how we made it
why'all niggas hate to get a dubs and rocks
Land of the green weed and cars that ???? hops
Don't stop - packin' my heat and Beretta 
Guarantee my hollows goes tough through your leather 
Whenever the rhyme play or the 9 play (ping ping!)
It's a done deal when I hit you run way

Till my very last breath, nigga, I swear to make you pay
Guilty conscience? Never me!
Last night nigga done caught a felony
Jealousy try to approach, want to promote
Then provoke through gun smoke, watch out, loc!
Shake down cause these niggas fuckin' with yours
Get in where you fit in even if it's a back door

Trying to hand me you popped, you're booked, I want more
Lock down for me on the bus downtown

So as the clock tickin' - and the plot thickens
We be juggin' up Sherman - and rockin' up chicken

Time to elevate the game and turn it up a notch
And bust on the muthafuckin' neighborhood watch
My money greener than a clover - in a 4-6 Rover
I be a millionaire thuggin until it's all over
I take a ice cold 40 of Cristal and what they servin'
Me and a Persian hoe in a 6-4 blowin' doja while we swervin'
Keep that off the hood, greed and determination in my eye, nigga
Be my piece of the pie, nigga, so I ride until I die,nigga

We rollin` Benz-o`s and Lex-o`s by the dollars

For all the homies out there that cook it up good
Distributin so up they project a neighborhood
Whether it`s Peruvian or Ghetto D
Won`t you bust down a kid and sell a ounce for me
I`m from the ghetto so the hoodrats gettin propers
Real criminals, robbers and the pit bulls squabblers
Puttin down thousands till there ain`t nothin left
cause real street riders, let em roll to the death
I like fly shit so I scramble for the pay
Rather hustle homeboy, then gangbang anyday

Plus them automatic things to make the pop noise

cause I flow through the city in a drop top Bentley

Pay you no mind and keep the safety off my nine
I ain`t worried about you busters, we ain`t scared to kill
I was beastin before rap, I`m a street nia for real
So check my resume and tell me what it say
I`m the same Mack from the block known for pushing yay
I claim the turf and bang the hood from a b.g.
Now I`m eight figures up, and when you see me it`s TV
Mack ain`t getting caught up in charged with murder one
When you got loose you don`t do it, you simply get it done
Now who want to test and try push around Mack 
Get this rap shit twisted and get your dome pushed back, huh??

[Chorus 2X]

Back to them O.G. gangsta for life critic piss 
See I`m insane bangin Inglewood city kids
If rap fail today I`m back to cuttin chunks 
Pushin work through the hood from down South to the Bronx
Nan they trip if they want to and get cheap thrills
Only MC with skills but not an MC with kills
And when the four kick I smash the letter pay the note
Everybody say hoe if ya love mack one-oh
Killas on my payroll`s a chain of command 
but my neighbors don`t know; think I`m a family man, ha 
I know sometime they wonder when the six four draggin
Hair braided, tatted up and I wear my pants saggin
Every room in my house stay flooded with heat
Livin in the hills but I still got tied to the street
Ain`t shit about me change worldwide, I`m respected

As soon as I get a word we can rush the safe

Niggas jealous of my shit
You unaware of this young nigga getting all the fly shit
While you're rooting and recruiting
Nigga 6-8 whooping
I was in the hood shooting cause I had the wife whooping
I come from padres gold in over sized jars
I past up strife and got star awards
No time for playa hating, Mack paper chasing
Came out the substation to the hip hop nation
The mo' hits the mo' bigga with illegal weight figga
Done develop the status of a platinum plus nigga
Bust the first asshole to show I can hit it

Don't stop nigga hit it

Mack 10,"I jumped out the blocks like ready! set! go!
Check all my traps and dodge the fair cold
I'm all about the mix like a fuckin collage
And out the gararge, is the Bentley Onage
With the brains blowed out, so is the suns beeming
I got a jacket drooming and the hoes feeming
Since I'm Westside Connected I got a streets on hype
I got big deals, big squeels, big wheels, big pipes

Twenty-inches row - going get these hoes
Pinky hoes - when I roll with my negros
Be a freak about it and I'm a see about it
Speak about it, not bitch I'ma be about it
Who want some of this, West running this
Mack 10 with the playboy bunny bitch
She's a dummy bitch - with a money pit?
You broke ass niggas can't even stomach this

What that connect nigga like three times selling
Six-double-0-west nigga selling rich roll delling
Throw it up, hold it up, guns bust fo' fingas up
Two twisted in the middle with the thumb cuffed
Chevy Nash and dippin at ass and king of the zaggin
Fo'-fo' macking and coat tacking
Dub the hood and I'm in blue friend at 'em
Front up the club, I'm duolete, do for talk and mack 'em trick

What is it like? Tossing 'em hoes
And rolling on fools on them fo's
Flossing 'em chain, we doing big thangs
And busting on punks at close range
This is the way us gangsta's roll
Sit back and watch it as it unfolds
Bitches on suck us done so cold
Ahhh! this is the life we chose

Dope money and rapping shit I'm all with it
And all I know is streets is how I spit it
Chickenhawk see a bird, I gotta get it
So if ya hood come up sho', then I'd probably get it
If lil momma dick then I gotta hit it
The trojan gotta be a magnum for me to fit it
If you sherm on 'em stick then I'd probably lit it
The red beam is on your wig so I probably split it

To all them bitches that think they bootylicious
I think they new tricious - I think they do dishes
I make 'em three wishes - I take 'em they pictures
And spendin' they riches and fuckin' they bitches
Ego maniac - little homies call me brainiac
Ice Cube's an asshole and it ain't an act
So take a hit at that - and remember that
Where my motherfuckin niggas and my bitches at?

Britches I get I'm Dub-C, the rider with the clique
Like a dragon it's nothin' but fire when I spit
And I can't shake these ghetto ways
A street rich nigga eatin a bag of Lays
And the rubber bands and brains
From the turf for the sirens and Neverlands
Where we keep the pistols smoking just like Afghanistan
It's gangsta the killa - the dope dealer
Back for mo' figgas - so trick bow down and po' the liquor bitch

What is it like? Tossong 'em hoes
And Rolling on fools on them folks

Please let your lil' dog pay this cat a visit
Fuck wit the O.G. and B.G. get busy
Make sure his days livin', cut to a minimum
I speak this shit cause I mean it my nigga

You'll need 20 jugs of water plus a whole gang of crack
But firsts things first, find him, hit 'em with the tool
Then make his blood ooze until there's no more to lose
Murder, murder's a must, take the stairway to heaven
And if you fuck wit Mack, then it's a 187

The lowriders, the mansions, is that why you resent me?
Smile in my face, and act so friendly
Walk away with hate and a heart full of envy
Say bruh, what part of the game is that?
You got ways like a dame and how LAME is that?
Actin like a groupie around famous cats
And it's strange, you don't have no shame in that
I got your card playboy, but I ain't trippin
You know me, I just roll with the punches and keep it pimpin
Get dough by bunches, donatin and tippin
Let it ride on the Harley, and six-fo' dippin
Stay real about my scrill if you know what I mean

I got trouble rhymes to a death the troubled times

And heaven knows that I tried to change
But in the mist of trying to be a better man
Trouble is all I can seem to see
And the fact I know tomorrow isn`t promised to me
So from this day forth I`ll be all I can be
My brother turned his back on me
Got to be my own man
Regardless of what the stakes is I`ma play my own hand
And I`m tired of being let down by my so-called friends
Regardless to the blood shed ? no tears in the end
Father please forgive for I have sinned ? forgive us all
But I ain`t to blame ? the lunatics wearing my heart
And I think I gotta build another wall
Cause I don`t want the world to see me
Cause maybe these demons will try to end me
I`m exhausted and my body`s sleepy
Never the less it`s hard to rest ? I`m a nervous wreck
I walk with the stress
I use to walk around with a vest
But now a days I be like ""fuck it dog
You fuck with me I gots to fuck with ya`ll""
And ""make ends"" is just another word for ""pay back""
Paying you back today for this grudge that I had way back
You niggas I grew up with wouldn`t play with that
I send you bitches to the morgue with holes in your head
No remorse ? why you think my niggas taught me to ball?
Cause I be walking around in designer suits?

Every time I get my hands on
I try to make you dub, with my chips wouldn't stack
Than man I wouldn't hustle
I'm legal dog - I got the same desert eagle dog
When birds fly out of my hands
And to my people dog - Ya understand
The white man can't fuck with me
I Hoo-Bang in the streets Hoo my company
Papered up beyond mother fucker's belief
A millionaire patrolling the city streets
See the flames burning in my eyes mother fucker?
Cause if you sleep on it you get these dreams mother fucker
I ain't the one like I said, ""I want it all""
And like my Conrads, time to wake up and ball
Call shots, have it ready - soft and rocked
Let all my neighbor hood fiends
Come to scrap all the pots
Let my little B.G.'s run the hood spots
And if it's funked than my killers come to shut down the block

[Mack 10 (Chorus)]
If I throw a chicken up and that bitch start flipping
Nigga that's mathematics
Over here we bloodin' and crippin' - Hoo banging and dippin'
Nigga that's mathematics
I got legal money in my account and dirty money under my mattress
Nigga that's mathematics
With my super bad bitch and my house on the hill
I can add it up for real all because of mathematics

[Mack 10]
I work for mines - let my work, work for me
I make my ends - my friends buy their work from me
Money is me - that folding on those switches is me
Went out on the seat and out with all those bitches is me
I make money while I'm sleeping
Cause money don't sleep - money is up seven days of the week
Three-sixty-five if you grind than it pays
I don't mind as long as your one-o is straight
Put some bread on this plate plus a little rate
That I give mines with a tape how to grind
I'ma leave my dent in the game like ripples
As a kid, even tried to make my lunch my triples
Stack it up, how do you think I bought that first double up?
The (?) and that other shit I hustled up - mathematics
That's just how I look at it
With enough carrots to feed a whole hood of rabbits


[Mack 10 (Chorus)]
If I throw a chicken up and that bitch start flipping
Nigga that's mathematics
Over here we bloodin' and crippin' - Hoo banging and dippin'

With my super bad bitch and my house on the hill
I can add it up for real all because of mathematics

[Mack 10]
Everything is to the good now I'm living how I want to
I got dope around the world and got some still on the corner
If you broke come and see me, I got shit for you to do
I got a class on how to make one bird turn in two
I'm a connected shot caller - pure bread baller
All I do is try to make my money flip like quota quarters
If money is the root to all evil than I'm (?)
And money is a race on mind so I'm cheating
I don't want shit subtracted - everything added
I didn't look back for shit since I hit bird status
And now I pack clips like Glaydis with no tips
Just a whole bunch of bloods and a whole bunch of crips
And a whole bunch of bitches when I rock the microphone
And my key to success is thirty-six hard zones
With my mind on a dub, re-up and stack cabbage
And I'm a walking proof of the signs of mathematics

[Mack 10 (Chorus)]
If I throw a chicken up and that bitch start flipping

But you rather have a hoe strap on dildo (Oh s***, what is that?)

Mack 10,"And now, our national anthem!
It's going down, West Coast
A toast to the Coast, West Coast!
I got my nigga Mack 10 up in the house from the Westside Connection
My nigga Deadly Threat from the L.A. Zoo
L-B-C Crew, D.P.G, West Coast finest
Here's a toast to the coast!

What have we? - a house full of Cavi, no stress
Well known riders from different sides of the West
Got the hi-zoes licking up, so hard we're sticking up
How could the East Coast win; when the West Coast is clicking up?
So please, no set tripping about Cs and Bs
It's the Westside connected with the D.P.G.s
For the cheese we're jab with the gift of the gab always capping
Mack 10 and Snoop rapping, now how does that happen?
It's all good, fool, so peep game if you could
Snoop be from Long Beach, and I be from Inglewood
So now you despise, cause it came to your surprise
Two well known enemies now becoming allies
In Californ-I-A; we parley the G way
Some wear red and black, and some sport (Blue and Grey!)
But gangsters don't dance, we hang-boogie and bang
So it's the Westside connected with the Dogg Pound Gang

We are party people, West Coast gangsters are party people
(Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll)
We are party people, West Coast gangsters are party people
(Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll)
Party people, party people, do you wanna get funky?
Get down, get down, you know

Up jump the boogie, so I've jumped up with it
We smoke weed by the ounce, no hit it
It's a party, Bombay and Bacardi, O.E. and Hennessy
We're all heated just in case, any of my enemies slipped in
Tripped in, you don't wanna own a casket this soon
Get at the bitches, nigga, bump to the boom
The ladies love me cause I love myself
I'm like an age, by no wine in time you'll find
I'm at the top of the shelf
So when you ready and you're cracking a sip
Strip, trip, slide around your house in your slippers
Bump the rap tunes that's as cold as the Whispers
Fantastic, brand new in this classic
We done mellowed out but you still get your ass kicked
It's Mr. Bad Azz, I rock microphones right
West Coast, East Side, for life!

It ain't no need for the fronting black, between me and you
Reality bites, so I'ma keep it real with my crew
I'm dangerous like Michael Dew
My life cycle completes the last stages
I'm more, I'm through, definitely gauges is outrageous
Cause I was born to rock the party
Oh! now you're Mister Smarty because we got the show started!
I'm cold-hearted, and won't stop what I'm revealing
Leave it up to the West to have them dancing on the ceiling
And I'm feeling, that Vibe that represents the East
I attack like a pack, to make them burn like grease
So let the nonsense cease, and hold my piece in case
Reel-to-reel come to deal, I have to give them a taste
I serve face to face, rhymes define by Tech
Versatile style done switched up to wreck your whole set

That's real, you know
It's getting kind funky here man, uh

Mack 10 is the lick, Dogg Pound is the clique
I can't get enough of this gangster shit
My name ain't +Jeru+ and I ain't out to +Dama-ja+
But when on the mic, emcees, to me, they're all amateurs
See the opponents, disassemble the components
Disassemble the opponents, then disappear in a moment
In a blink's time, I take time in the doorway to crime
With a criminal mind, the raw kind
Microphones used so abusively
You can't fuck with the K-U-R-U-P-T
And in the mixture, painted clearer than a picture of a psycho
I'm suicidal, split shit to cause a twister
And get you twisted, you're fucking with the unlisted
To be specific, niggas ain't being realistic
I ain't impressed, you're about to get your chest test
In the west, where it's about your money and your set

You East Coast niggas flow like the home grown grow
Zoo got the flavor, every color for the rainbow
Dream, on out far, pass the stars
Your styles ain't doper than ours
Hard to the core, hit it one time, hit it some more
Y'all spit but that West Coast shit is out doors
Wild like Ninety Days in the cage
Cold like the Everglades, and never fades
Me, C to the Z to the T
Beef? Bet' not let me catch you in the streets
Hoo-Bang, cracked in the fast lane
The melody by Deadly, the Dopeman

Yeah yeah yeah, there you have it
It's like magic, it's so tragic
The West Coast, Hoo-Banging, Westside Connection, L.A. Zoo
L-B-C Crew, and you know about the infamous D.P.G.s
We make them freeze to their knees, real Gs

Never get in a situation wit me involvin' guns
Never able to sleep always on tha run

That I won't soften ya head & come split it

Grew up around killas, hung wit tha big dawgs
Nigga we play it raw as it go, were I stay
Run ya mouth too much, get found in a hall way
Wit a head shot, look that's how niggas get it
Keep it on a tuck, nobody know who did it
No evidence, no witness, you just assed out
Busta ass nigga, you just assed out
Fuckin' wit a guerilla ah untamed one at that

I'm a burst that, it's dealin', the hustle don't stop
I got stones and hairone, ecstasy and weed
Meth, imphetamine, sherm, sticks and speed
Pay it high wid, dope is all I got to give
I'm a ghetto nigga dog so I get it how I live
Got money, lock 'em off, fuckers still I got drama
Got two strike dog and five baby mamas
With new strain I maintain, I'm ready and willin'
to keep change on niggas brains to keep the blood spillin'
I hate it but it ain't complicated, it's real simple
Fuck with me and know you get a hole in your temple
I ain't gonna play you niggas, I'ma slay you niggas
Don't take but a few figures and a few new triggers
Mack 10 livin' legend, every West coast rhymin'
Straight hoo bangin' gangsta and all rhymin' sodom, it's bad

[Chorus x2]
[Royal Flush]
Shut up, let me talk for a minute, a lot of bull shit on my mind
Dealin' with crime, a lot of why'all dealin' wid rhymes
Stuck on the grind, crackheads cookin' my pies
Startin' off on the 1-2-5, the block's mine
Bucket the spine, DH tryna tap my line
Stop my producitons, want to know my money discussions
Who I roll wid, ""buy so many cars is he legitin' of my dick""
It didn't matter when I ain't have shit
They done watch me in helicopters, parklin' in my crib
All I want to feed is my kids, no time to do a bid
Feel me, I forced the whole guns a while for my ones
Didn't sell drugs, where the money come from?
No school, no job, no bitch, no food, fuck that
Do what I do to make my shit true
And I make it hard on them boys who blew they cats charges
If I go to jail you know I'm blowin' on the Sergeants

[Intro: Knoc-Turn'al]
Now that's cool
You know

Fuck the music

And he came hittin my weed
He came drinkin my Hen'
Matter fact if I see him in traffic, even know y'all fuck with him
It's on

[Chorus: Knoc-Turn'al]

This is for the G in me, let's go (let's go)
Would ya party on with me? (get it crackin in this motherfucker)

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
On the mic I been a deamon since seamen
How you screamin': Oh mama, here come that young O'Sama
With that Al-Quaida drama
Fuck no
It's the Dalai Lama, wit that West World Order
Now MC's Bow Down and treat me like Yoda
When they catch me in the corner after club
Like ""nigga whuut"", they t'ow up the dub
So you can tell Samuel L. I'ma keep ac'in
You can even tell that motherfucker Jassie Jackson
Pay your child suport, keep your payments up
Put a rubber on and don't fuck wit us

[Chorus: Knoc-Turn'al]

[Verse 2: Mack 10]
Mack pull up in the rag, Cevy laid the ass
And crumble green on a Zig-Zag and lacein' with hash
I keep a 9mm cocked and ready to blast
So when the phone jump off a nigga ready to smash
I drink my 'gnac out the bottle
I don't fuck wit a glass
And I ain't sip trippin dog, that's a thing of the past
And I stay in good shape so my stamina last
And put hands on a motherfucker bout my cash
I was a stick up kid, I snatch your chain and dash
And if the pawn shop wanted it I bound it fast
Or I'm creepin through your window breakin out your glass
Then I rob the whole party lookin through a ski-mask, c'mon

[Chorus: Knoc-Turn'al]
All lights are on

[Verse 3: W.C.]
From the land of the Lakers, bird brakers, Impala Peddles
While we chop dollars wit those in Supremo's
It's the check a hoe, when the cutlass checkin doe
So so ghetto Dub let's rep the boat

Ball griddy but a crew a hog's wit me
And V.I.P. yo from mad dog 20/20
Dub C. chunkin up at 23th
And better go still swiss hangin' like a testicle

Lick 1, 2 to the nose, my butt was swaz, huh
Take my picture, trick my foe's posein' like the heisman
I'm burnin' money, tryna slice some in you tummy (what)
Leave your panties gummy, have you walkin funny, trick

Hook:
See all we need is just a few good men,

We know nobody's perfect, so repent for ya sins,
So ya better get it straight, 'cause he's coming again,
(Whisper) He's watching 


Verse 2 - Mack 10:
I got the hood on smash homey
And though I'm ballin full throttle
I'll never run outta gas homey
I'm so fly as the days go by I'm better
So I dump re-up and keep getting more cheddar
You know what it do
Mack 10 a savage
Got hustle in my veins so I fiend for the cabbage
Fresh baller to the end
Tell a friend and a neighbor
Ain't that I got so much flavor
It's that I got so much favor
I'm like Pac I get's down, against all odds
And you don't wanna go to war with a child of God
So if you see me in a six four
Tuck ya pistol
Plus it's on if ya miss
So be careful what ya wish for
A rhyme sayer wit respect like the mayor
Plus your arms is to short to box wit God playa
See I'm all for Jesus but I'm nuthing like Mase
I'm to ghetto and gutter
But I'm covered in his grace, yea!

If the Devil wasn't alive, Mack would be stressed
Riding around town in a bulletproof vest
Police everywhere amour cars and shh
Worried about being another victim of a hit

But my relationship too strong for real I'm a saint
A child of God and if you hate me then you ain't
Be the only G I know to take it all with no triggers
So I put my faith in Him and never no niggas

As a result of that I'm cool, seem like I'm never nervous
So catch me Sunday mornings in that 8:30 service
Told me ride with me son and I'll never leave you lonely

Most people get outrageous when they hit they knees
But I'm a thank you for the simple things the grass and the trees
I'm grateful for everything my fame and good wealth
I'm blessed with good money but most of all with good health

God, if they don't think I'm sincere, they don't know me, never knew me
And I tear up every time I think how good You been to me
I should of lost a few times and walked away without any pay
But I got favored with You and You gave it to me anyway

So when you blind in a situation believe, He can show you
And if you ever need a hug then just believe He can hold you
So turn to the Lord for He's the best to consult you
And that's the realest thing that Mack 10 ever told you

And thank You for letting my momma survive them five shots
It was up close and personal a lot for a kid to see
All the stuff I been through how could I not be a G

I know you got a purpose for me, it ain't no if ands or maybes
God in case I never told You, I want to thank You for my babies
Although I'm a gangster, rapper I'm pretty smart and well rounded
I never sell my soul and I promise to stay grounded

In every game, we gotta have the brains and the muscle
The game and the hustle... to be real on these streets
So here you have it, the Brainiac
Ice Cube
With the Maniac
Mack 10

Mack & Cube: Yay-why-yay! [Repeat: x2]

[Ice Cube]
While y'all n****s think about the papÂ¨Â¦
I think about which Titanic I`mma sink
The iceberg, with the nice words
I slice verbs and predicets, ghetto etiquette

Y`all better get, this dime-mega s***
The Braniac, the theory be conspiracy
Keep my eye on the birdie, but never get my hands dirty
Verbally call the Maniac and his attack dogs
Signing contracts with automatic jack clause

[Mack 10]
I get full of their s*** and take flight on these n****s
`Bout to show these so-called
Wig-splitters and nigg-hitters
Who the man be, and what the number one clique is

Let my nuts hang on these busts
And hoes see how big my dick is
Maniac Mack 10 always keep the heat toted
And teflon tips keep the .44 loaded 

Straight quoted in nine-trey, by the dime
Now we connected
He said, ""Mack, when you westsidin` and ridin` is expected""
So I...

[Chorus]
[Cube] Maniac with Brainiac, Mack 10!
[Mack] You do the drivin`, while I do the jackin`
[Cube] Maniac with Brainiac, Mack 10!
[Mack] My n**** if you plot it, best believe I got it
[Mack] And it`s on... feel the chrome

[Ice Cube]
You in the Stargate, trying t`escape, it`s not an option
Got torture techniques for them lies, don`t ever lie
Just put the car in drive, we can go ride- get this money
Determined as the Energized Bunny, make a left

Underground parking, guns start sparkin`
ATF enemies all around start chargin`
Tryin` to f*** up my new suit and my weekend
Ask me what you want, you b****! I ain`t speakin`

[Mack 10]
S***, I gives a f*** what the next n**** think
(?) gives a f*** how much b**** you say you ain`t
It`s like this on mine, potna
By all means, I got the ball

So it`s your life, not mine n****, so you make the call
Now, I can blow your brains out, punk and act the f***in` fool
Or you can hand your guns over, and let everything be cool
But know this: I won`t hesitate to peel your wig back

I`m off that wet-bomb and the whole fifty yak
It`s Mack the Maniac, n****

[Chorus]

[Ice Cube]
What`s the plan? Everything thought out
Everything bought out, like Bill Gates
My n****s love steel weights
I`m still great, after 12 muthaf***in` years

I (?) your a** after 12 muthaf***in` beers
I act kind to my peers and everybody that listen
They know when the Brainiac`s missin`
The big fish, hanging with the chicken hawk
Got all the haters, claimin` that they want to talk

[Mack 10]
You argue wit `em and negotiate, and I really want to kill `em
I`m tired of the bulls***, man I really want to peel `em
Dog, I knew they were scareless
`Cause my brother Snoop told us

So f*** the money and the dope that they punk-a** owe us
Now when I see `em, it ain`t no question it`s all the way on
But I`m a wait in front of they momma house
For that one n**** to get home

And when I gun, watch his body jump
And it`s all going to amaze me
To see his own self
Layin` there with his own brains on the pavement

Check all my traps and dodge the fed co
I'm all about the mix like a f***in collage
And out the garage, is a Bentley Onage
With the brains blowed out, so the sun's beamin
I got the jackers drooling, and the hoes fiendin'
And since I'm West-side Connected got the streets on hype
I got big deals, big skrill, big wheels, big pipes

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Twenty-inchers roll - go and get these hoes
Picky hoes want to roll with my n****roles
But be a freak about it, and I'ma see about it
Speak about it, no b**** I'ma be about it
Who want some of this, West running this
Mack 10 with the playboy bunny b****
She's a dummy b**** - with a money pit?
You broke a** n****s can't even stomach this

What that connect like? N**** like three time felon
Six-double-0-west n**** selling rich are you-bellin'
Throw it up, hold it up, guns bust fo' fingers up
Two twisted in the middle with the thumb cuffed
Chevy Nash and dippin' the a** and king of the zaggin'
Fo'-fo' mackin' and coat taggin'
Dub the hood phantom I'm in a blue phantom
In front of the club and valet, do for talk and mack 'em trick

What is it like, tossin' them hoes?
And rollin' them fools on them vogues
Flossin' them chains, we doin' big things
And bustin' on punks at close range
This the way us gangstas roll
Sit back and watch as it unfolds
B****es and suckers stunt so cold
This is the life we chose

[Verse 4: Mack 10]
Dope money and rapping s*** I'm all with it
And all I know is the street so that's how I spit it
Chicken-hawk see a bird, then I gotta get it
So if ya hood come up short, then I probably did it
And if lil' momma thick then I gotta hit it
The Trojan gotta be a magnum for me to fit it
If it was sherm on a stick then I probably lit it
The red beam is on your wig so I probably split it

To all them b****es that think they bootylicious
I think they nutritious - I think they do dishes
I'm makin' three wishes, or takin' they pictures
And spendin' they riches and f***in' they b****es
Ego maniac - little homies call me brainiac
Ice Cube's an a**hole and it ain't an act
So take a hit of that - and remember that

And like a dragon it's nathin' but fire when I spit
And I can't shake these ghetto ways
A street rich n**** eatin' a bag of Lays
And rubber bands and braids
From the turf for the side, rings an ambulance
Where we keep the pistols smoking just like Afghanistan

Back for mo' figgas - so trick bow down and po' the liquor b****

It's a Sunday a gun day
rollin' down a one way
in my 'lac front and back
over train tracks
On yak and herb nigga swerve
it get's on my nerves
banked my Danas on the curb
In the gutta lane
I'm butta man
Foot to the flo'
what you want from the sto'
I'm broke as a muthafucka nigga buy my single
comin' from Ingle (Foe Life) is my jingle
Seen yo' bitch at the sto' coulda took her
but niggas start to handcuff they hoes like T.J. Hooker
Fool I'ma vet you can bet
that I can dance underwater and not get wet
It's the nappy headed nigga that can kill and rap
everybody run when I bust a cap
puttin' Inglewood up on the map
look at what I do when I pull my strap
Bust 2 rounds nigga about to clown

'fo yo' life expires I'm as nutty as Michael Myers
Didn't think about the Rottweiler

blood in the Impala
Sittin' in the County with a gold record
Ice Cube send me pictures of bitches naked
caught with a contraband in my hand
Mack 10 take the stand
your Honor I'ma changed man
so please let me go so I can flow
Got a show had to ask my P.O. can I go
and if he say no I'ma have to say
bitch get out the car slow
and leave ya fuckin' dough
'cause a nigga gotta eat fuck the world
let the bullets hurl and feed my baby girl

Call 911 there's a son of a bitch on the roof
yarned up in his birthday suit

'cause I'm superman superbad supermad superfly
fool you can die
There's gonna be a lot of cars with they lights on
and I'm at home sewing stripes on
Cause I'm the General and you's a stowaway
'bout to buck you down with this throw away
with no serial number it's the summer
where niggas die
It's hotter than July

Got turned out early by them scandalous freaks
Addicted to crime so I stay in the mix
With a love for hoochie chicks and pulling jewelry licks
Moms said, ""Mack, baby watch for danger""
I said, ""Momma don't you know I'm a real gang banger?""
I can't switch over night and be good
And I'll be damned if a nigga turned his back on the hood
So I walked out the door, hopped in the Regal
Twisting triple gold with the all black eagle
Got a deuce fired at Scoob's, I need a gat
So I stopped and got the Tech from my G homie Wreck
He said, ""Mack, don't slip dog, u gotta stay heated
And here's the extra clip incase you might need it""

Throw the Hoo-Bang plack in the back and your ride on

More bounce to the ounce and I'm clowning
Keep the gat in my lap cause I'm fully strapped
For the car jackers, but no haps cause I pack a
Tech 9, plus a A-K 47
Send a one way ticket to my hell or maybe heaven
Peep, nigga I don't sleep

Watch my nigga's back, who sacked the yayo
Keep the calico with extra ammo

On yak and herb nigga swerve
it get's on my nerves
banked my Danas on the curb
In the gutta lane
I'm butta man
Foot to the flo'
what you want from the sto'
I'm broke as a muthafucka nigga buy my single
comin' from Ingle (Foe Life) is my jingle
Seen yo' bitch at the sto' coulda took her
but niggas start to handcuff they hoes like T.J. Hooker
Fool I'ma vet you can bet
that I can dance underwater and not get wet
It's the nappy headed nigga that can kill and rap
everybody run when I bust a cap
puttin' Inglewood up on the map
look at what I do when I pull my strap
Bust 2 rounds nigga about to clown
bitch hit the silent alarm it's goin' down

Chorus

Foe life foe life
Mack 10 comin' through the hood with stripes
(Repeat)

Verse 2

Khacki suit ski mask is my attire
with my luck cut my chucks on the barbed wire
Fool where ya keep the rims and tires
'fo yo' life expires I'm as nutty as Michael Myers
Didn't think about the Rottweiler
a lot of stiches in the ass
blood in the Impala
Sittin' in the County with a gold record
Ice Cube send me pictures of bitches naked
caught with a contraband in my hand
Mack 10 take the stand
your Honor I'ma changed man
so please let me go so I can flow
Got a show had to ask my P.O. can I go
and if he say no I'ma have to say
bitch get out the car slow
and leave ya fuckin' dough
'cause a nigga gotta eat fuck the world
let the bullets hurl and feed my baby girl

Chorus

Verse 3

Call 911 there's a son of a bitch on the roof
yarned up in his birthday suit
(Mack 10 to the rescue)
my momma want to know why I do what I do
'cause I'm superman superbad supermad superfly
fool you can die
There's gonna be a lot of cars with they lights on
and I'm at home sewing stripes on
Cause I'm the General and you's a stowaway
'bout to buck you down with this throw away
with no serial number it's the summer
where niggas die
It's hotter than July
You better stay low fo' you get a halo
plus wings and a gown when I come around
So take 10 paces
and try to guess the color of my shoelaces

Ain't no bicken, the whole hood get brackin'
I'm from the bottoms where [?] get chest highs
Before Worldstar, head ups weren't televised
Crack sales with shoe box deposits
Homie lived outside and the cleaners was the closet
Work got swallowed, enemies got knocked off
Giver to the [?] half the nigga's top gone
Work, sold for it, young niggas flocked for it
I represent Inglewood and the whole corner pop for it
Enemies all foul, snitch when you bust at 'em
But they the enemy, fuck it, still bust at 'em

I wrote the book and all the rules
I can act a fuckin' fool but I'm bicken' back being bool

Do anybody remember the CPD?
Look who outlast 'em, that's that TTP
Arabian spruce, the cranberry's the juice
That we drink with that vodka 'cause they don't make [?]
The first platinum nigga with some big red plaques
Then Mack ten hit the scene, that nigga had me backed
And I kept pushin', drinkin', smokin' kush and
Puttin' money back in my hood and rollin' bushes
Now who the fuck would say that find out where you lay at
Bring it right up to your porch, your home, stay back

MC's spilled their skills but they'll just get mopped
Early bird on the track, first up to bat
Throw a steak on the grill so I can chill and get fat
Heat up the coals while I heat up the mic
Competition, if they're a match then I'll strike
Wreck the shop, leave the shit in a shambles
Put your money on a sure shot, Benj ain't a gamble
I'll slap a muzzle on a sucker whose tongue skips
Give him the boot and turn his ass into dumb chips
With what's left I'll fertilize the earth
You was bunk as an MC but your shit you bring birth
I walk a path to become legendary
Rhymes so milky they'll be labeled as dairy

Swift with the gift, the man all the hoes love
Slamming suckers like Bambam Bigelow
Got bitches on my team like I was a gigolo
I break hearts and I climb charts
And I never been booty, save that for the farts
Kids blowing hot air, who got their heads gassed?
You can have ten wack rappers and they still come in dead last
I watch them fall cause they're faulty
I laugh in their face and they walk away salty
I rain on suckers while some choose to drizzle
You come up with beef you leave with no teeth and gristle
Fuck with your head like Hannibal the Cannibal

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

And even if you get married you could'nt do what I do
Now let me get high off my drug scandals
Life's a gamble...

Niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm muggin' back
Yes sir

Check me out, look

Old school Chevy, faster than a silver bullet
Strawberry paint, seats vanilla puddin'
2 bitches, gon' and eat each other's pussy

Top chopped sent the car to the barbershop
My driveway looks somethin' like a parkin' lot
I'm so unothodox
I got your bitch Ridin' my dick wit no shocks
Bounce bitch, bounce, bounce

I'm the hottest shit jumpin' out the coffee pot
Man, I'm just tryin' to get my spot like a polka dot
Lil' kush make my eyes and my shoulders drop
Lil' syrup and I can make a soda pop

Keep talkin' 'n' I can make my soldiers pop
Real niggas wit me ridin' till the motor stop

The whip got the dicks out like a pop bra
And you ain't gotta ask your girl... you knew she knew me
From ring tones she sing my songs at the karaoke
She call me baby all day like I'm Bryan Williams
The new hip-hop landlord I'm 'bout to buy the buildin'
And I'm evictin' all you cats that only spit an ounce
And like a stripper ass you better bounce diggity, bounce, bounce

Always Strapped when I hit the club
Niggas give me dap, bitches give me hugs
And since I'm paid niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm muggin' back
Niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm

Always strapped when I hit the club

Bitches be lovin' me, they know I love 'em back

Yeah Shawty The Last MOB Flyin' The Bugatti With The Tool On The Seat
Put the K in the car while we ridin' blaze
Put the chopper on the pussy in the driveway
Bet the house on the young 'un when we got paid
Triple colors on the bikes in the new mercaids
Bustin' keys on they ass while we got paid
From I-10's ridin' hot to an open bay
Uptown made man out the hard way
Crab in the bucket 50 shots bitch make a way
I Thought They Knew Shawty
Like Father Like Son
Ball till you fall stuntin' wit them paper plates
Throwin' hundreds on them hoes while we eatin' steaks
We in the club poppin' bottles like everyday
We grind for the shine nigga gettin' big money
Got a fleet tossin' chicken nigga get cake

Mack Maine,"I see your dirty face, high behind your collar
What is done in vain, truth is hard to swallow
So you pray to God
To justify the way you live a lie, live a lie, live a lie
And you take your time and you do your crime
Well you made your bed, I'm in mine

[Chorus]
Because when I arrive
I bring the fire, make you come alive
I can take you higher what this is, forgot?
I must now remind you let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

Now the son's disgraced
He, who knew his father
When he cursed his name
Turned, and chased the dollar
But it broke his heart
So he stuck his middle finger
To the world, to the world to the world
And you take your time and you stand in line
Well you'll get what's yours, I got mine

[Chorus]

Yeah! Wayne's world
Planet Rock, panties drop
And the tops and she gonna rock 'til the camera stop
And I sing about angels like Angela (rock) and Pamela (rock)
And Samantha (rock) and Amanda and Tamara 
I'm in here up like bitch what's up
Mechanic, me, I can fix you up
I can fuck you up, I can fuck you down
Shorty we can go wherever just pick a town
And the jewelry is louder than an engine sound
Big ass rocks like on the ground
Dirty like socks that's on the ground, Weezy

[Chorus: x2]

Just let it rock
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

I'm back like I forgot something, I'm something

Miles like I'm trying to get a flat stomach
Like Wayne the personal trainer
My aim is perfect I'll fuck ya, period, like the reminder

Y'all go hard, I go to the bank
Check my check stubs, bitch it's Mack Maine
Young money up and runnin', join the campaign

Times ain't the same, shit been goin' bad
Bend a bitch over, pull some money out her ass
I'm tired of the game, 'cause it ain't what it was
The chopper's so close, I can give that bitch a hug
And a gangster need love, so I keep a gangster bitch

I'm tryna tell her how sexy she look wit' cream on
And all she wanna know is why I still got my jeans on
Bounce till the springs gone

Mack Maine,"A million lights and a kick drum, the floor is moving slow
I've got a feeling 'bout this one, and we still young, you know
I'm breathin' fire in your cup
It's not my fault if your hearts grown cold
It's not my fault if your hearts grown cold

New Hermes duffle bags
On the plane, see the sky through a little glass
Twenty hour flight, now we jet-lagged
Sipping white wine, watching the sunset
Real love this close? I ain't never had
Sitting with you all day til the night pass
Damn, I ain't trying to fight that
But if we fall too fast, will the feeling last?
Now I'm lookin' over my shoulder, shoulder
Champagne, good dine and good times, and now it's all over
But can't blame me for all that
You was bright, now your heart all black
Try to outshine the good with the bad
You a cold motherfucker, I ain't mad at you
Still shinin'

A million lights and a kick drum, the floor is moving slow
I've got a feeling 'bout this one, and we still young, you know
I'm breathin' fire in your cup
It's not my fault if your hearts grown cold
It's not my fault if your hearts grown cold

You gettin' old and your heart turn cold
Time line froze, mad at the world 'cause you lived your life,
but this the life that we chose
Lights on the road for the nicest road,
I mean long-ass flights with these trifling hoes
But we don't crap out when the dice is rolled, I mean no life, low life
Say my name and hopes to get more life, nigga live yo life
Lame ass nigga, you cookin' with no spice
Lil B sacrifice, show me what your ho like
Hit her with that dope dick, now she's a dope fiend
Leo lion and king, I'm lookin' for a dope queen
Uh, first thing baby, I'm ready to rock
Baby car goes high, man smash flocks
Me does, Millz, Tyga, we give 'em the chills (Millz-y)
Keep riders, get birth control pills

Uh, young money, bright lights
Lord knows I live for these nights
You're damn right, I'mma sip champagne 'till it burn my sight
Yanks fitted cap to the front, like Jeter
My diamonds ain't fierce like an episode of cheetahs, jesus
Mouth jewelry, loud speakers
Blowin' loud weed with some loud divas

A million lights and a kick drum, the floor is moving slow
I've got a feeling 'bout this one, and we still young, you know
I'm breathin' fire in your cup
It's not my fault if your hearts grown cold
It's not my fault if your hearts grown cold

Uh, it's that summertime, money time
Gonna rhyme good time, when a dime gimme mine
Brown smoke, quiet engine out the silly lines
Pretty toes hangin' out the window to the finish line
Spikes pokin' out my kicks like a porcupine
Young Money, Cash Money, We The Best, fall in line
Uptown thoroughbreaded from the south Bronx
How blocks in Miami, Khaled outcome
You made us, they hate us, just to say the latest
Life nothin' like a movie, I just date a ?
Remember it was hard trying to page wagers
Nice spittin' hard rhymes on the main stages
Independent, yeah I told 'em major later
We some independent niggas gettin' major paper
Shout to 'em, Stunna, Slim, Mack
We play for keep, so how we gon' give up that?
YMCMB, lights, camera, action!

A million lights and a kick drum, the floor is moving slow

Pop a bottle and celebrate
We made it to a new day
Pop a bottle and celebrate
We done made it to a new day
Oh I take a hit and just elevate
'Cause today will be a good day
I got my mind right, money right, ready for war

Hey! - blow the horns on 'em
The sun is out, it's a brand new day and it just dawned on 'em
The smoke in here got 'em floating just like in salt water
And break is fast, we got it cooking just like a short order
Go feed the hands birds cover the cheetah print
A jungle out there and the jail is the zoo that keep us in
Players in gators is crazy, we feel the need to rock 'em
Furs coming in all different colors like PETA got 'em
Killing yourself for a salary
Look ya line flatter than stomachs of the women that's running, watching them calories
Hope that we linking, we smoking and drinking casually
'Cause life without living ain't nothing but a fallacy

[Chorus]

Say, who's that peekin' in my window?
Is that sunshine? Is that one time?
Let that sun shine through my living room
Hospitality is what I'm giving you
Harsh reality is what I've been through
But I'm not alone, ask her and him too
And they shall tell ya, ain't nothin' better
Than the smell of a new day
I know the ocean runs dry and the sky gets dark
And ya don't see what He's trying to show ya
And I know the wall may seem tall
But if we help each other I guarantee we get over
And once I'm over, I'll reach back for my brother
And pull him over as well
Keep our heads high and our noses wide open
Hopin' for that new day smell

[Chorus]

Yea homie, I been? since I was 16
To tell 'em what I'm 'bout to tell 'em
So I need more than a 16
See I'm the only son of Mary and Joe
So I gotta fulfill my purpose 'fore I'm buried, ya know
My momma say she having visions of me being a missionary
And the hood looking at me as a walking visionary
So I sit back and wonder will I ever have my time to shine
And die like Pac in his prime
Or will I go out like Len Bias and OD before the tryouts
No teller no reaper no buyout
I'm good, I pray for a head to protect ya
And I gotta walk the streets with the heat as my protection
Still gotta watch my back, still watch my front home
'Cause I seen a lot of n-ggas die with they gun on
So with that in mind, I just get higher
And pray to the higher Messiah, I'm no liar
And they say that puffing the fire f-cks with your memory
But I got a lot of stuff that I don't wan' remember see
Like when my homie ivin died
I like how I never seen a man cry 'til I seen Lance died
Never seen my pops cry 'til I seen my Grams died
And I'm here to tell him that I miss my Grams too
And I wish I could hug her for mothers day too
And I feel the same way that you do
But we gotta still move on so she can just smile down on us
And I don't want the Lord to ever frown down on us
I know that they really got power in a gun
But I also know that they got power in a tongue
So every time I speak, look I try to speak life
Y'all tweaking for broads, I tweak life
They said I was s'posed to die as a fetus
My momma said I bind that Devil in the name of Jesus
So now I'm here just to talk to y'all
Come and stroll with me homie, let me walk wit' y'all
Ten million ways to die so I chose
To get my life right by the end of the road
'Fore my body in a casket and I'm stiff and froze
'Fore I'm laying in a morgue with a tag on my toes
I'm here to tell you take heed to the warnings
School shootings, hurricanes, and global warming
Open ya Bibles up with no hesitation
BC was the Genesis, this is Revelations
So you better pick your destination
Tomorrow ain't promised, better pick your destination
Rest in peace B Spencer, rest in peace?
Shit could be worse so I'm feeling like Weezy
I wake up in the morning, take a piss, and wash my hands
Take a knee and thank the Man and leave my life in God's hands, yea!

We done made it to a new day
Oh I take a hit and just elevate
'Cause today will be a good day
I got my mind right, money right, ready for war

The smoke in here got 'em floating just like in salt water
And break is fast, we got it cooking just like a short order
Go feed the hands birds cover the cheetah print
A jungle out there and the jail is the zoo that keep us in
Players in gators is crazy, we feel the need to rock 'em
Furs coming in all different colors like PETA got 'em
Killing yourself for a salary
Look ya line flatter than stomachs of the women that's running, watching them calories
Hope that we linking, we smoking and drinking casually
'Cause life without living ain't nothing but a fallacy

Say, who's that peekin' in my window?
Is that sunshine? Is that one time?
Let that sun shine through my living room
Hospitality is what I'm giving you
Harsh reality is what I've been through
But I'm not alone, ask her and him too
And they shall tell ya, ain't nothin' better
Than the smell of a new day
I know the ocean runs dry and the sky gets dark
And ya don't see what He's trying to show ya
And I know the wall may seem tall
But if we help each other I guarantee we get over
And once I'm over, I'll reach back for my brother
And pull him over as well
Keep our heads high and our noses wide open
Hopin' for that new day smell

Yea homie, I been? since I was 16
To tell 'em what I'm 'bout to tell 'em
So I need more than a 16
See I'm the only son of Mary and Joe
So I gotta fulfill my purpose 'fore I'm buried, ya know
My momma say she having visions of me being a missionary
And the hood looking at me as a walking visionary
So I sit back and wonder will I ever have my time to shine
And die like Pac in his prime
Or will I go out like Len Bias and OD before the tryouts
No teller no reaper no buyout
I'm good, I pray for a head to protect ya
And I gotta walk the streets with the heat as my protection
Still gotta watch my back, still watch my front home
'Cause I seen a lot of n-ggas die with they gun on
So with that in mind, I just get higher
And pray to the higher Messiah, I'm no liar
And they say that puffing the fire f-cks with your memory
But I got a lot of stuff that I don't wan' remember see
Like when my homie ivin died
I like how I never seen a man cry 'til I seen Lance died
Never seen my pops cry 'til I seen my Grams died
And I'm here to tell him that I miss my Grams too
And I wish I could hug her for mothers day too
And I feel the same way that you do
But we gotta still move on so she can just smile down on us
And I don't want the Lord to ever frown down on us
I know that they really got power in a gun
But I also know that they got power in a tongue
So every time I speak, look I try to speak life
Y'all tweaking for broads, I tweak life
They said I was s'posed to die as a fetus
My momma said I bind that Devil in the name of Jesus
So now I'm here just to talk to y'all
Come and stroll with me homie, let me walk wit' y'all
Ten million ways to die so I chose
To get my life right by the end of the road
'Fore my body in a casket and I'm stiff and froze
'Fore I'm laying in a morgue with a tag on my toes
I'm here to tell you take heed to the warnings
School shootings, hurricanes, and global warming
Open ya Bibles up with no hesitation
BC was the Genesis, this is Revelations
So you better pick your destination
Tomorrow ain't promised, better pick your destination
Rest in peace B Spencer, rest in peace?
Shit could be worse so I'm feeling like Weezy
I wake up in the morning, take a piss, and wash my hands
Take a knee and thank the Man and leave my life in God's hands, yea!

Mack Rice,"If you disrespect anybody that you run in to
How in the world do you think anybody's s'posed to respect you
If you don't give a heck 'bout the man with the bible in his hand, y'all

You goin' out the world backwards like you did when you first come here yeah 
Keep talkin' bout the president, won't stop air pollution
Put your hand on your mouth when you cough, that'll help the solution
Oh, you cuss around women and you don't even know their names, no
Then you're dumb enough to think that'll make you a big ol' man

Respect yourself, respect yourself, respect yourself, respect yourself

Come for my people, you'll be sorry
'Cause we're not sorry, we're not sorry
So think about the war that you'll be starting
'Cause we're not sorry, we're not sorry

So called Christians, what do they do?
They label me evil, man you don't know just how crazy these people
So many conspiracies they get from hearing me
Fearing me 'cause they think that I'm the tyranny of Devilry
Think they planning to level me
'Cause I'm king of the revelry
I will never be taken by the hands of another man
I get grim like no other can
Christian household my mother ran, in this gutter land
Then she married a good Muslim brother man
So I had a hell of a lot of teaching
We leave sin on the table with the goodness and feasting
Eating like cannibals we're the animals beasting
Seeking the enemy who invented these preachings

I'ma say this quick
If you come for me and my family, I'ma spray this clip
And my army is super ready if you haters trip
Keep popping off at the mouth, you get inflated lips
Ain't no Illuminati, don't let the ruckus consume ya body
I'ma groom the shotty then I'ma aim it at whom is naughty
With them damning me to hell, planning for me to fail
Ain't no landing me in cells, abandoning me in jail
Stop mocking me and my symbols
Back in the day was bishop, more, and me in the temple
So if you coming at me I will never be gentle
You gotta know ya conspiracy theories are mental
Me and my children breathing that is really essential
So me just being a rapper is not my only potential
Was brought up in a war, you can check my credentials
All I gotta do is tell my army come and let the sin flow

Mackenzie Nicole,"I'm aware that right now a lot of us feel like chips are down
Sick of bein' kicked around
Thrown on the ground, picked right back up then tossed in the lost and found
Stumblin', lost your ground but it sounds like a chance for you to recover quickly
If you know anything about a struggle at all, the hustle is real, you probably already get me
So I need all of you with me
The Killer City committee, the Middi West version
Of the Avengers goin' harder than Bobby and Whitney
The enemy's shifty, so we gotta react swiftly
Whenever negativity hit me, I try to get it in check quickly
Came to know playing the role of a psycho is not gon' fit me
Cause I'm not so fifty, but I do know this
We all have the power, in every moment the time is ours
Counting minutes, seconds, hours
Death to cowards, fight the power
Smite the lions, light the fires -
Brighter, higher, 'till we burn 'em down
Take the tables that we turn around
It's worth the search if freedom's found
(And you're a hero)

What we need is a hero

A source of light when things go wrong

Who can brave our world and save our day
Hero, who always knows what to do
Someone like me
Someone like you
What we need is a hero

I watch it all unfold, and then I take my chosen road
This one goes out to everybody livin' state to state, place to place, and coast to coast
They're ridin' in, committin' acts of violence that leave us divided, you can take your own control
The kids lookin' up to us for guidance, now they wanna try it, how were they supposed to know?
It's like we all wanna fly (Uh), nobody wanna phone on the line but
Sometimes you gotta swallow your pride and apologize
For all of the time you were wrong and cauterized the wounds that we harbor inside (Uh)
Ain't nobody perfect, we need to organize the community, stop living like Lord of the Fly
I know it might seem hard, it's important to try to keep a light on and centered at the core of your life
Go to war with a mic
Shoot 'em down with a peace sign
The system of control is an intelligent design
It need a second look, and many elements refined
We're lookin' for a hero that can help us defeat crime and settle the beef
If you only throw a rock at police lined, you're really not a rebel to me
It isn't us vs. them, we all one, stand together in unity better than lyin' dead in the street

That you can reach 'em and my world is not a disaster waiting

When I did ""Anghellic"" I was good and bad, straight confused
Then an angel turned to Devil Boy when the Reparation blew
Them demons had ""Absolute Power"" when I drug abused
So the angels searched through the ""Vintage Tech""
What they found was the love was through
Then an accident would happen that made life necessary
So now receiving God, the angel was ""Everready""
But the Melancholy strikes, the eleven angels mommy's life
So the Misery sat in the angels now becoming ice
As mom got ill and iller, when it hurts her he can feel her
To the strain of the pain made of bane
There's no more angels straight up KILLER!
My apologies, it's not very God of me
To go crazy and try to teach the whole world ""Sickology""
I was then split in two, back to the beginning view
Angel demon cause the killer showed me death was overdue
But I gotta live for my kids, all the evil stuff I did
Taught me to teach you, you can love then no matter how much sluts you did
Or dug, you met my demon back when I had that grudge
But I gotta let you know most of my spirit comes from up above
I'm mostly angel, and you know sometimes we fall

I can't take it no more so sing it Mackenzie and tell em' why I'm

So lonely, so lonely
So lonely, so lonely
Yeah
When I came up, 
I was famous
And I stayed up
Yeah
Now I'm way up
People they just
Turn to hater

Got everything that I wanted but it came with a price
Bought me a crib with my money, but I gave up my life
Sometimes I stay up kinda late, and I hate it at night
Every other day me and my lady we break up and fight
Thinkin' you bringing that mentality 
Into my galaxy is a fallacy for anybody that battle me
Realizing I ain't got nothin' but friends and family
And after that ain't nobody else gonna look after me
So I'm proud to be

I done kissed a couple of people, I don't even know nobody
I'm just spilling my drink, threw up in the sink
And trying to get in her pink but what do ya think
They won't let me up in my face while my breath in it stink

So I hit the road and made my getaway.
Restless feeling, I really gotta hold,
I started searching for a better way.

[Chorus]
And I kept on looking for a sign in the middle of the night,
But I couldn't see the light, no I couldn't see the light.
I kept on lookin' for a way to take me through the night,
But I couldn't get it right, no I couldn't get it right.

La fever, made me feel alright,
But I must admit it got the best of me.
Gettin' down, so deep I nearly drowned,
I can't get back to where I used to be.

I nearly died from hospitality,
Left me stranded, and took away my pride,

I got a question
How'd he make it this far? How the fuck did it begin?
A Trump rally sounds like Hitler in Berlin
Or KKK shit, now I'm goin' in
I'm just sayin' what's real, I don't give a fuck who I offend
'Cause it's gotta be said, it's gotta be said
It's off the top like the toupee on Donald Trump's head
This man's not peaceful, racism's evil
This man hates Muslims, that's a billion fuckin' people
If truth be told, Donald is a terrorist
Reasons why the world's got a problem with Americans
The fuck is goin' on? People just passed
A mass murder happened, you said thanks for the congrats
You tryna get your votes up, you don't got class
Orlando was a tragedy, you react fast
And then made it 'bout you, to boost your campaign
It's goin' all bad if he wins this damn thing
Man America is fucked if he's next up
Take a day to undo what Obama fixed up
It's Young Gerald so you know who said it
And Ivanka can get it, straight up

Oh we ridin', check it
Now, we protest when we see the tour bus (Bang, bang)
Too scared to get out, that's why the door is shut (Bang, bang)
Your politics are like a Starburst pack (Why?)
Nobody fucks with the orange one (Biatch!)
Bannin' all Muslims? Aiight, bool (This guy)
What if we ban all the white dudes?
Because a couple have run up in trenchcoats and rifles
And killed in the name of Jesus Christ at the high school
How 'bout we stop sellin' automatic guns?
You got rich 'cause your daddy gave you automatic funds
Add it up, you an automatic punk, what it is?
I'm just tryna make America great again! (Mothafucka)
Party in the streets when Hillary wins
If she don't, my girl's half Canadian
Actually nah, I'm not gonna stay with them
I got an eagle on my arm, I'm a patriot
I'mma stay right here, I ain't livin' in fear

Obama don't like you, Michelle don't like you
Been tryna make it to one of your rallies but I ain't have time to, punk
Piss on your golf course just to find you
Like where you hidin' at? Who you lyin' to?
Fuck your get rich scheme, I've been ballin' out
You're too old, you keep lyin', that's why your hair fallin' out
Donald Trump, call him out, KKK supporter
His favorite phrase, ""Deport 'em,"" how the fuck y'all endorse him?

This an ode to the B-boys, B-girls
The people out there who do it for the love
And believe me I'm not dissin' anybody out there who's trying to get paid
I'm trying to get paid too!
But I got one question

Whatever happened to the heart?
That pumped the passion into the art?
The entity that gave you the energy to wanna start?
Breakdancing, I'm battling, doing it at the park
Where the mission was expression, not only to top charts
I don't know what happened, wanting to blow rap
You lose soul and passion for the flows and the tracks
Radio's lacking, controlled by fascists, assholes doing damage
But we're gonna take it back
Before beats to a hundred G's a pop
All you needed was a tabletop and a beatbox
Hip-hop without the B-boy is like shelltoes only having two stripes
Hip-hop, we're freedom-fighting, graffiti-writing, party types
That recite and organize and revitalize our rhyming
'Til the group of the moneymakers systems
Knows that the industry can eventually get served
Breakers of my verses spinning up a revolution throughout our words
If you really want it, come on get it, 'cause I've got it
I'm honestly paying homage to forgotten pioneers 
Of this culture that are giving them props and learn
If you wanna earn your stripes
You gotta be able to rock this mic and set cyphers alike
The feeling to put in everything you got in the circle
Will never be documented in the Coke commercial

We be the baddest

Now B-boys, B-girls
Bring it back to the block
Lemme see you get ill, for real, pop and lock!
If you record without thought then stop
Because I'll serve your whole album with the goddamn beatbox
Without thought it just happens
If you gotta think to feel, that's not rapping, that's acting
I'm from a land of backpacks and fat cats
Mcs with sick raps who serve those that are wack
It's a way of life
I put all my energy into the melody
On the MPC until the death of me
Record exceptionally, especially
Whenever I be monumentally, grammatically, killing the mic
I tell my DJs, cranking that music, keeping 'em moving when the beat plays
Staying into it, breaking and grooving, and MCs they
Thinking that you should always pursue in what their dreams make
Taking from lucid to really do it
All the people gotta make their money
And the way to make money is to get inside of the industry
Take it on the radio, blow so
Even go blow, we get a car and a crib up on MTV
But in the end what's classic?
Radio bubblegum? Or a voice filled with passion?
To my real hip-hop heads, please stand up
'Cause the only people that can preserve this art is us (seen)

Macklemore,"I was seven years old, when I got my first pair
And I stepped outside
And I was like, momma, this air bubble right here, it's gonna make me fly
I hit back-court, and when I jumped, I jumped, I swear I got so high
I touched the net, Mom  I touched the net, this is the best day of my life
Air Max's were next,
That air bubble, that mesh
The box, the smell, the stuffin', the tread, in school
I was so cool, I knew that I couldn't crease 'em
My friends couldn't afford 'em, Four stripes, some Adidas
On the court I wasn't the best, but my kicks were like the pros
Yo, I stick out my tongue so everyone could see that logo
Nike Air Flight, but bad was so dope
And then my friend Carlos' brother got murdered for his fours, whoa

See he just wanted a jump shot, but they wanted to start a cult though
Didn't wanna get caught, from Genesee Park to Othello
You could clown for those Probings, with the Velcro, those were not tight
I was trying to fly without leaving the ground,'cause I wanted to be like Mike, right
Wanted to be him, I wanted to be that guy, I wanted to touch the rim
I wanted to be cool, and I wanted to fit in,
I wanted what he had, America, it begins

I wanna fly
Can you take me far away
Gimmie a star to reach for
Tell me what it takes
And I'll go so high
I'll go so high
My feet won't touch the ground
Stitch my wings
And pull the strings
I bought these dreams
That all fall down

We want what we can't have, commodity makes us want it
So expensive, damn, I just got to flaunt it
Got to show 'em, so exclusive, this that new shit
A hundred dollars for a pair of shoes I would never hoop in
Look at me, look at me, I'm a cool kid
I'm an individual, yea, but I'm part of a movement
My movement told me be a consumer and I consumed it
They told me to just do it, I listened to what that swoosh said
Look at what that swoosh did. See it consumed my thoughts
Are you stupid, don't crease 'em, just leave 'em in that box
Strangled by these laces, laces I can barely talk
That's my air bubble and I'm lost, if it pops
We are what we wear, we wear what we are
But see I look inside the mirror and think Phil Knight tricked us all
Will I stand for change, or stay in my box
These Nikes help me define me, but I'm trying to take mine, off

I wanna fly
Can you take me far away
Gimmie me a star to reach for
Tell me what it takes
And I'll go so high
I'll go so high
My feet won't touch the ground
Stitch my wings
And pull the strings
I bought these dreams
That all fall down

I started out, with what I wear to school
That first day, like these are what make you cool
And this pair, this would be my parachute
So much more than just a pair of shoes
Nah, this is what I am, what I wore, this is the source of my youth
This dream that they sold to you
For a hundred dollars and some change, consumption is in the veins

And now I see it's just another pair of shoes",Wing$,2011
Macklemore,"And we drink and get older
And some of us even try to get sober
Now here's to the assholes and the last calls
Well city kids, you get what you ask for

And acquaintances turn to friends, I hope those friends they remember me
Hold the night for ransom as we kidnap the memories
Not sure there is a way to express what you meant to me
Sit around a table and use those ears as the centerpiece

Sounds of the city on Capitol Hill
Where I question if what I'm seeing here is real
Cowboy boots doing lines at the bar
Where the time goes slow when you're drinking PBR

Sounds of the city on Capitol Hill
Where I question if what I'm seeing here is real
Cowboy boots doing lines at the bar
Where the time goes slow when you're drinking PBR

Hold on to what you were, forget what you're not
The streets were ours that summer, at least those two blocks
Reminisce on those days, I guess that's OK, you wonder why
Some grow up, move on, close the chapter, live separate lives
The twenty-something confusion before the suit and tie
Strangers become mistakes but those mistakes make you feel alive
Hindsight is vibrant, reality: rarely lit
Memories to collage, paste to the glue that barely sticks
Good Lord, they broke all my shields
Locked bathroom doors, graffiti, and high heels
Until you felt that altitude you don't know how high feels
Party mountain, some don't ever come down from around here
To be young again, I guess it's relative
The camera lights, the whiskey rise, sink into the skin
I fantasize about a second win
Grow a mustache, pick up another bad habit and let the games begin

Sounds of the city on Capitol Hill
Where I question if what I'm seeing here is real
Cowboy boots doing lines at the bar
Where the time goes slow when you're drinking PBR

Cowboy boots doing lines at the bar
Where the time goes slow when you're drinking PBR

So here's to the nights, dancing with the band
Strangers into girlfriends from a one night stand
Brought a little liquor and turn up the Johnny Cash
You could bring a receipt to Heaven but you cannot take it back
And this is life, this is real, even when it feels like it isn't
I'd be a goddamn liar to say at times I didn't miss it
So deuces, I turn my back as I walk into the distance
Dip my feet in every once in a while, just to say I visit
And we hold onto these nights
Trying to find out way home by the street light
Over time we figure out this is me, right
Learn a lot about your friends right around two A.M

And acquaintances turn to friends, I hope those friends they remember me
Hold the night for ransom as we kidnap the memories
Not sure there is a way to express what you meant to me
Sit around a table and use those ears as the centerpiece

Macklemore,"Everything is gold, everything is equal
Posted on the porch just chillin', me and my people
Eyelids closed, gold sun shines on
The world’s coated in the gold Krylon
Yea, and these days days days
They never run away
Gold tints, shades, that block out that golden haze
Take all the gold from the pawnshop that lives behind the case
And get to give it away
My gold erupted from volcano's in the heavens
And every shrine that existed in time melting
Tombs open, Dookie Ropes on the bells
When everything is gold, who cares about the carats?
They say that gold's the skin of the gods
You can’t take the band there when you’re gone
Now I’ll tip over that kiosk in the mall
As the sunset falls into tomorrow

Today we’re feeling like gold, five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, row fun, hella cold
And we stay fresh, so fresh head to toe
Ghost slowly faded, 14 carat plated
So we’re feeling like gold

Five hundred thousand soul
Slick rick gold, row fun, hella cold
Yea we’re feeling like gold
So fresh head to toe
Ghost slowly faded, 14 carat plated
So we’re feeling like gold

Alright now we open up that car door
Hop out, hope they notice us
Throughout society we been locked in that cobra clutch
More gold bottles, gold bottles, never sober up
Ditch Jesus, In gold I Trust
I solemnly swear to wear my cross and stunt
Separate myself by sticking out just because
That’s how you illustrate power and who you’re above
But nah, tonight we take it, take it, giving it back
Crack open the vault, let everyone mob in the bank
Take whatever they want, we party and give thanks
I've been rocking gold chains since pee was in the tank
You only live once, you only live once
Watch Rick Ross give his Jesus piece to a bum
'Cause tonight we ball, we ball, we comin’ up
Paintin' the globe gold, two steppin’ on the sun

Like gold, five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, row fun, hella cold
And we stay fresh, so fresh head to toe
Ghost slowly faded, 14 carat plated
So we’re feeling like gold

Oh, oh, oh, oh oh
Today we’re feeling like gold
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Gold coins, gold phone, gold car
Costs at least 10 racks to get 16 gold bars
Gold rush, suck on my gold dust stuntin'
Under these gold trunks, that’s 2 golden nugget
Flyin' on the gold eagle, flier than the rest of ‘em
Passing space needle, golden shower on pedestrians
Excuse me, that’s my bad, that’s my eagle and he shouldn’t of
My eagle got hair, that motherfucker got a mullet bruh
And it’s gold, two girls gold brass
Lounging on the water, feet in the gold sand
Sipping on Orangina, arms around them both pants
They’re sipping Olde English right out of a gold can
Two girls, gold spandex so pretty
That girl ain’t even gold, she just got golden girl titties
I’m kidding, everyone is gold in my city
You paint Betty White gold, even Betty White can get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it

I roll them dice and I'm fine
'Cause all I ever dreamt about was makin' it
They ain't giving it, I'm taking it

I’m taking it, taking it, they ain’t giving it
I’m taking it, taking it, they ain’t giving it
I’m taking it, taking it, they ain’t giving it
I’m taking it, taking it, I need all that shit

If I just went in and stole it, the police would of notice
Gotta be strategic, creepin', go in, leave with that motive
Hold up, my plan is forming, alright, caseing this building
Watch these rappers that rappin' walk in and leave out with millions
Headed in sweatin', open that front door
Interscope printed out right by the entrance, door closes
Not a metaphor, then I start towards
That front, that’s right, where you check in
Dressed in an uniform, acting like a janitor
All blue, jumpsuit, why shoot?
Bloodthirsty for the money like a bull
Looking in the eyes of the matador (fuck you!)
Carrying 2 cans of paint, security looks at me awkward
I say third floor i’m late, paintin' jimmy iovine's office
Holding my breath ‘bout to faint
I’m scared to death that he stops me
Heart beating so loud you can hear the echo in that lobby
And see I'm breaking down if I don’t make it out
Then i’m leaving town with that contract
And i’m spazzing out, grabbin' the a&r out
His chair and i’m taking him hostage
I don’t give a fuck, step into the elevator press 3
Now i’m headed up (heist!)
What they don't know is there is a gun in the paint can
And i’m ready and willing to bust ‘em, I'm fucking desperate
Stuck in this recession, now what you think
If I could get signed my life is destined
My future depends on ink
And secretary at the front of the entrance staring right at me
I walk up she whispers go ahead and then gives me a wink

I put my life on the line
I roll them dice and I'm fine
'cause all I ever dreamt about was makin' it
They ain't giving it, I'm taking it

I’m taking it, taking it, they ain’t giving it
I’m taking it, taking it, they ain’t giving it
I’m taking it, taking it, they ain’t giving it
I’m taking it, taking it, I need all that shit

If I get past security, the secretary, the cubicals
But it’s weird, it’s like this room i’ve walked into is unusual
Thought it would be shiny and beautiful
Thought it would be alive and like musical
But it feels like someone died, it’s got the vibe of a funeral
There’s numbers on a chalkboard
Cds boxed in cardboard
Artists that flopped, that got dropped and never got to be sophomores
Graphic designers are sitting around
Waiting for albums that never come out
Complainin’ that they have nobody in house
Wonderin’ what they make art for
I start thinking, am I in the right place?
Just walk forward, see plaques on the wall
Oh yea, in a second those will be all yours
Finally see an office with a mounted sign, heaven sent
Big block silver letters, read it out loud: president (nice!)
This was my chance to grab that contract and turn and jet
Right then felt a cold hand grab on the back of my neck
He said: we’ve been watching you, so glad you could make it
Your music gets so impressive in this whole brand you created
You're one hell of a band, we here think you’re destined for greatness
And with that right song we all know that you’re next to be famous
Now i’m sorry, i’ve had a long day remind me, now what your name is?
That’s right, macklemore, of course, today has been crazy
Anyway, you ready? we’ll give you a hundred thousand dollars
After your album comes out we’ll need back that money that you borrowed
So it’s really like a loan, a loan? come on, no
We're a team, 360 degrees, we will reach your goals!
We’ll get a third of the merch that you sell out on the road
Along with a third of the money you make when you’re out doing your shows
Manager gets 20, booking agent gets 10
So shit, after taxes you and ryan have 7% to split
That’s not bad, i’ve seen a lot worse, no one will give you a better offer than us (hmm)
I replied I appreciate the offer, thought that this is what I wanted
Rather be a starving artist than succeed at getting fucked",Jimmy Iovine,2012
Macklemore,"Now, this is my job, I will not quit it
Pulled me out the depths when I thought that I was finished
Yeah I questioned if I could go the distance
That's just the work, regardless of who's listening, listening
Listen, see I was meant to be a warrior
Fight something amongst me, leave here victorious
Classroom of kids, or a venue performing
If I'd had done for the money I'd have been a fucking lawyer
Concrete, vagabond, van telling stories
Humbled by the road, I'm realizing I'm not important
See life's a beautiful struggle, I record it
Hope it helps you maneuvering through yours and
That's why we stay in the lab at night
I've been staring into this pad for over half my life

Forget about the fame, fortune and the mansion
Sitting and tripping watching myself on a plasma
Yeah, I start slipping when I'm thinking about that stuff
Ego won't swole until the karma catches that up, that up
I'm my grandma's number one grandson
I lost myself to remember who that was
We start thinking about some kicks, a necklace
What I really need is a job off Craigslist
Take away the dot com, name, love
Fans, twitter followers, and the buzz
See, you keep the issues but you take away the drugs
And I had to find out who I really was
Who I really wasn't
So sick of who I was becoming
Yeah, tired of running
Time to look at the man in the mirror until I can learn to love him

The prayers flow better when I’m soaked they're gin
The air is rusty and sits in the corner
Bad bartender that’ll pickpocket your heart
And a jukebox that’ll steal your quarter
Bartender, please give me a confession
Exchange fear for courage in the form of a well drink
There’s a heavy current, got a long way to swim
Closed the Bible a while ago, I need some shots for this sin
Hail Mary, come with me, feel like Pac when it hits
Got some fire in my belly and a riot in the gut
Bushmills for a band-aid, the sweet taste of blood
Then I might actually feel something if I don’t cover it up
Watch their faces, familiar places
Even if they didn’t left the vinyl booth that they stayed in
The motel next door, a sign that reads vacant
And a truth that’s so strong I’d be a fool not to chase it
But yea, I’m a fool and I stay here
Hope these problems bail themselves, I die in wait here
One more, four more, fuck it a night cap
Service starts at 5 tomorrow and I’ll be right back

Underneath this fragile frame
Lives a battle between pride and shame
But I’ve misplaced that sense of fight
This crown of thorns has punched the top my spine
But listen closely as I testify
Dependency has been a thief at night
Thief at night, thief at night

I read the Bible but I forgot the verses
The liquor store is open later than the churches
Pure by their imperfections, everything is burning
To hell with the confessions, oh the Lord immerses
Blessed in holy water, the sin of Holy Father
Have you ever smelled bless that smells atmonic Vodka
11 AM in the morning and you can’t get it off ya
Comment to the preacher but it’s like the pastor isn’t talking
Until the store opens I can read up on that doctrine
The people close to me say I’m in need of a doctor
Think that I got a problem but these are not apostles
This the drink of the Lord, that’s according to my gospel
Open to interpretation, if you’re judging it I don’t want it
I got tins that scole like my throat when I hit the bottle
And I’m sinking and that’s why I keep on drinking
I need a refill, bar more than once every weekend
Sweet Jesus, I’m getting amnesia
Shaking til I’d get a taste, my faith is having seizures
Every time I walk away and try to leave it
Every time I walk away and try to leave it

Wouldn’t miss it for the world
Baptized in my vices and the bar is my church
Traded my artist and I pawned off the easel
Spend it all searching for God at the neon cathedral

Wouldn’t miss it for the world
Baptized my vices and the bar is my church

Underneath this fragile frame

Macklemore,"When I was in the 3rd grade I thought that I was gay 'cause I could draw,
My uncle was and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face, she's like,
""Ben you've loved girls since before pre-K""
Trippin', yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like ""Yeah, I'm good a little league""
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those who like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think its a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition. Playing God
Ahh nah, here we go
America the brave
Still fears what we don't know And God loves all his children it's somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written 3,500 hundred years ago
I don't know

And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

If I was gay I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the Youtube comments lately
""Man that's gay"" Gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yeah, we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word routed in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
Gay is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that lead people to walk-outs and sit-ins,
It's human rights for everybody
There is no difference
Live on! And be yourself!
When I was in church, they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service Those words aren't anointed
And that Holy Water, that you soak in is then poisoned
When everyone else Is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans, that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same But that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal
Damn right I support it

I don't know

And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

We press play Don't press pause
Progress, march on!
With a veil over our eyes
We turn our back on the cause
'Till the day That my uncles can be united by law
Their kids are walkin' around the hallway
Plagued by pain in their heart
A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper
Isn't gonna solve it all, but it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us
We have to change us. Whatever God you believe in
We come from the same one
Strip away the fear
Underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up

And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

Macklemore,"One, two, now
Those 3 plus years, I was so proud of
And I threw ‘'em all away for 2 Styrofoam cups
The irony, everyone will think that he lied to me
Made my sobriety so public, there's no fuckin' privacy
If I don't talk about it then I carry a date
08-10-08, but now it's been changed in every
When they put me in some boxes that say
That I never was, it's the false prophet that never came
And will they think that everything that I written has all been fake
Oh well I'll just take my slip to the grave
Uh, what the fuck are my parents gonna say?
The success story that got his life together and changed
And you know what pain looks like
When you tell your dad you relapsed and look him directly into his face
The seep on your shoulder's the seemingly heavy weight
I haven't seen tears like this on my girl
In a while the trust that I once built's been betrayed
But I'd rather live telling the truth than be judged for my mistakes
Them falsely held up, give em props, loved and praised
I guess I gotta get this on the page

Feeling sick and helpless, lost the compass where self is
I know what I gotta do and I can't help it
One day at a time is what they tell us
Now I gotta find a way to tell them
God help 'em
One day at a time is what they tell us
Now I gotta find a way to tell them

We fell so hard
Now we gotta get back what we lost, lost
I felt you'd go
But you were with me all along along

And every kid that came up to me
And said I was the music they listened to when they first got clean
Now look at me, a couple days sober
I'm fighting demons
Back of that meeting on the east side
Shaking tweakin', hope that they don't see it
Hope that no one is looking
That no one recognizes that failure under that hoodie
Was posted in the back with my hands crossed shooken
If they call on me I'm passing, if they talk to me I'm booking out that door
But before I can make it somebody stops me and says are you Macklemore?
Maybe this isn't the place or time
I just wanted to say that if it wasn't for other side I wouldn't have made it
I just look down at the ground and say thank you
She tells me she has 9 months and that she's so grateful
Tears in her eyes, looking like she's gonna cry fuck!
I barely got 48 hours, treated like I'm some wise monk
I wanna tell her I relapsed but I can't
I just shake her hand and tell her congrats
Get back to my car and I think I'm tripping yea
'Cause God wrote Otherside, that pen was in my hand
I'm just a flawed man, man I fucked up up
Like so many others I just never thought I would
I never thought I would, didn't pick up the book
Doin' it by myself, didn't turn out that good

If I can be an example of getting sober
Then I can be an example of starting over
If I can be an example of getting sober
Then I can be an example of starting over

We fell so hard
Now we gotta get back what we lost lost

Macklemore,"Uh, I hope that God decides to talk through him
That the people decide to walk with him
Regardless of Pitchfork cosigns I've jumped
Make sure the soundman doesn't cock block the drums
Let the snare knock the air right out of your lungs
And those words be the oxygen
Just breathe
Hey man, regardless I'ma say it
Felt like I got signed the day that I got an agent
Got an iTunes check, shit man I'm paying rent
About damn time that I got out of my basement
About damn time I got around the country and I hit these stages
I was made to slay them
Ten thousand hours I'm so damn close I can taste it
On some Malcolm Gladwell, David Bowie meets Kanye shit
This is dedication
A life lived for art is never a life wasted
Ten thousand

Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand ants
Ten thousand ants, they carry me
Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand ants
Ten thousand ants, they carry me

Now, now, now
This is my world, this is my arena
The TV told me something different I didn't believe it
I stand here in front of you today all because of an idea
I could be who I wanted if I could see my potential
And I know that one day I'ma be him
Put the gloves on, sparring with my ego
Everyone's greatest obstacle, I beat him, celebrate that achievement
Got some attachments, some baggage I'm actually working on leaving
See, I observed Escher, I love Basquiat
I watched Keith Harring, you see I study art
The greats weren't great because at birth they could paint
The greats were great 'cause they paint a lot
I will not be a statistic, just let me be
No child left behind, that's the American scheme
I make my living off of words
And do what I love for work
And got around 980 on my SATs
Take that system, what did you expect?
Generation of kids choosing love over a desk
Put those hours in and look at what you get
Nothing that you can hold, but everything that it is
Ten thousand

Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand ants
Ten thousand ants, they carry me
Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand ants
Ten thousand ants, they carry me

Same shit, different day, same struggle
Slow motion as time slips through my knuckles
Nothing beautiful about it, no light at the tunnel
For the people that put the passion before them being comfortable
Raw, unmedicated heart no substitute
Banging on table tops, no subs to toot
I'm feeling better than ever man, what is up with you?
Scraping my knuckles, I'm battling with some drug abuse
I lost another friend, got another call from a sister
And I speak for the people that share that struggle too
Like they got something bruised
My only rehabilitation was the sweat, tears and blood when up in the booth

It's the part of the show where it all fades away
When the lights go to black and the band leaves the stage
And you wanted an encore but there's no encore today
'Cause the moment is now, can't get it back from the grave

And on on, and on, and on we go
We love who we are but now it's gone
Let's leave before we eat each other alive
Alive

Same city, yeah, we can't break up
Nice mask on, wear the same one
The greatest trick that the devil ever pulled
Was convincing women that they looked
Better in their makeup
I wear war paint, fight to the casket
Too tired to apologize on this mattress
Emotional detachment, what's the matter?
She's learning that she never should have
Dated a rapper
I don't blame her, my mind is gone
I'm at dinner, checking phone calls
Texts & blogs
I don't hear a word, I know nothing at all
Just concerned about the world
Memorizing these songs

Goes on and on
Don't wanna break you
But I'm leading you on
On, on, on, on
And now it's gone

And on on, and on, and on we go
And on on, and on, and on we go
We love who we are but now it's gone
Let's leave before we eat each other alive
Alive

You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
This time we know we know
It's over, over

Didn't believe in love until we fell out
Gave the keys back, now I'm on the homie's couch
Always going out, sleeping ‘round with strangers
Danger! But you can't live without her
Now you're paranoid, checking on her cellphone
Making sure she ain't like you alone
Haven't made love with the lights still on
It's like you're hiding something from me

Let's fake another toast to the good life
Predict the future, clean slate, blue sky
Fantasy, I see me husband, you wife
Lyin', staring into those two eyes
And I can't take it, back to where we came from
My pavement, past the emotional earthquake foundation
Yeah, let's keep swimming in the snake pit
Get bit, get out then jump back into the suffocation
Make up and fuck to save us like we got this
Come on, this is just us baby
And this is just a fight, this is just love, maybe
Is it just you or am I fucking crazy?
I swear to god, I wish that I could Photoshop the scars off
Cold world and get all my heart throbbed
And I said it all and never get lock jaw
Mouth is a saw, a shock at any second could pop off
How does the truth taste?
My job comes with complimentary toothpaste
Lately, I've been living up out of my suitcase
Building trust in that I'm leaving on Tuesday
Bought a one night stand, just a bootleg
A duplication of something authentic
Heart augmented, and it's so hard to end it
I said peace before but this time I meant it

Can't get her out of my head
This place is a mess
Holding onto cobwebs
That has us both on the fence
She walks that thin line
In and out of my bed
Each time I love her less

Can't get her out of my head
This place is a mess
Holding onto cobwebs
That has us both on the fence
She walks that thin line
In and out of my bed
Each time I love her less

They say thirty is the new twenty
And twenty is the new thirty shit I guess
Makes sense, cause fifteen year olds seem twenty
And twenty five year olds seem ten
I used to drink away my paycheck
Celebrate the mistakes I hadn't made yet
Our generation isn't the best on safe sex
We forget the latex, becoming Planned Parenthood patients
Synthetic heroin is the new basshead
So much to escape, fuck a straight edge
Walk around looking through a fake lens
Apps this good, whose got time to make friends?
I wish I didn't care
Acynical hispters with long hair
Cocaine problems, like my music
It's not my issue, I can't solve it

My flight has finally landed down
And the ground has stopped moving all around
Eyes open, awake for the very first time
We both forfeit this game of crime

They say it's so refreshing to hear somebody on records
No guns, no drugs, no sex, just truth
The guns that's America, the drugs are what they gave to us
And sex sells itself, don't judge her 'til it's you
Ah, I'm not more or less cautious
The rappers rappin' 'bout them strippers up on the pole, copping
These interviews are obnoxious
Saying that it's poetry is so well spoken, stop it
I grew up during Reaganomics
When Ice T was out there on his killing cops shit
Or Rodney King was getting beat on
And they let off every single officer
And Los Angeles went and lost it
Now every month there is a new Rodney on Youtube
It's just something our generation is used to
And neighbourhoods where you never see a news crew
Unless they're gentrifying, white people don't even cruise through
And my subconscious telling me stop it
This is an issue that you shouldn't get involved in
Don't even tweet, R.I.P Trayvon Martin
Don't wanna be that white dude, million man marchin'
Fighting for our freedom that my people stole
Don't wanna make all my white fans uncomfortable
But you don't even have a fuckin' song for radio
Why you out here talkin race, tryin' to save the fuckin' globe
Don't get involved with the causes in mind
White privilege, white guilt, at the same damn time
So we just party like it's nineteen ninty nine
Celebrate the ignorance while these kids keep dying

Man I’m lounging in some shit Bernie Mac would’ve been proud of
Looking down from heaven like damn that’s stylish
Smilin’, don’t pay attention to the mileage
Can I hit the freeway? I’m legally going 120
Easy weaving in and out of the traffic
They cannot catch me, I’m smashing
I’m ducking bucking them out here
I’m like go fuckin their tastic, I am up in a classic
Now I know what it’s like under the city lights
Riding into the night, driving over the bridge
The same one we walked across as kids
Knew I’d have a whippin’ but never one like this
Old school, old school, Candy paint, two seater
Yea, I’m from Seattle, There’s hella Honda Civics
I couldn’t tell you about paint either
But I really want a Ducati so I put in the hours

Tires with the spokes on it in the 4-2
Most of the mayonnaise, keeping the buns on ‘em
My dogs hanging out the window
Young as whoosh, fuckin like we ball
Tryna fuck em all, kill the fuckin wimps
See what’s poppin’ at the mall, meet a bad bitch
Slap her booty with my palms, you can smoke the pussy, I was tearing down the walls
I’m motherfuckin’ off
Son, swear these eyes tryna hypnotize
Grip the leather steering wheel while I grip the thighs
See the lust stuck up in her eyes, maybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke?
Or does she want it low? This shit a Coupe de Ville so you’ll never know

Recluse, sipping on some lean I would let loose
Looking in the mirror, watching myself lose
Cleaned up in '08, got a job making barely minimum wage
To get into that page
Hit the road with RL, performing in front of 8 people
And that shit will check your ego
About around that time I'm watching that EP go
From nothing to getting us booked around the country
I know no limits, life can change in an instant
Eight people turn into sold out shows in a minute
And I'm watching my pops in the back row grinning
With his glass up to my mom, toasting this Guinness

And we on (we on)
Good music, it lies in the ambiance
When we leave here
Will these words live on
Till then, we keep on making the songs

So put 'em up, up up, up up (so high)
So put 'em up, up up, up up (so high)
So put 'em up, up up, up up (so high)
Put 'em up, up up, up up (so high)
So put 'em up, up up, up up (so high)
So put 'em up, up up, up up (so high)

I remember that Freshman edition
Last year thinking to myself like
Yah, nah, I won't win it yet
Probably won't get it, but I'm gonna give it everything
Play my position
The next 11 months I gave it all everything I had in me
Left blood, sweat, tears in every god damn city
No label, no deal, no publicist, indie
Just music that connected and fans that rode with me
Throw me a gold mine, and a co-sign
While you're riding a couple dope rides
Two women, both dimes
Not gonna lie, that shit sounds so nice
But I got creative control and my souls mine
I wouldn't trade it, maybe I'm crazy
I put on for my city
Seattle that raised me
Rule four thousand eighty, it's really not changing
Now a days make good music, the people are your label

So put 'em up, up up, up up (so high)
So put 'em up, up up, up up (so high)
So put 'em up, up up, up up (so high)
Put 'em up, up up, up up (so high)
So put 'em up, up up, up up (so high)
So put 'em up, up up, up up (so high)

Oh my God, feels like a victory lap
Can I have that moment
Can I talk my shit

And they say, ""Don't forget where you come from
Don't die holding on to your words
'Cause you know you got a whole world to change
But understand who you got to change first""

Put 'em up, up up, up up
Up, up up, up up

He kicked me out
He kicked me out
When I told him that I lived this way
I lived this way, I lived this way
I lived this way, I lived this way
I lived this way, I lived this way

He doesn't own me
He doesn't own me
He doesn't own me
He doesn't own me
Just escape!

Arrows land, we’re fallin'
Arrows (arrows) were fallin'
Arrows land, we’re fallin'
Arrows (arrows) were fallin'

The black rinse align your face
Like a deer drinking water in a picture frame
I swear to God I've seen those eyes
The back of my lids when closing mine
With clasped hands we shake it out, shake it out
Lace the boots and we walk away
I felt slightly connected to him and said
Now boy, now you own me

Arrows land, we’re fallin'
Arrows (arrows) were fallin'
Arrows land, we’re fallin'
Arrows (arrows) were fallin'

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
He doesn't sleep
So in truth he never wakes up
Another day rushing to his death
Out of breath on the treadmill of the famous
He makes mistakes tells stories to his paintbrush
And when the world finally sees his art
He wishes that he never would have made it
Just escape, just escape
Ricochets and eclipses faith
Living in a city with a grey umbrella over your shoulders
And you're becoming suffocated by the weight, can't hit those breaks
This is what you wanted, huh
But you got it all in vein
'Cause you forgot who you are
Right as the world learned your name it goes

Arrows land, we’re fallin'
Arrows (arrows) were fallin'
Arrows land, we’re fallin'
Arrows (arrows) were fallin'

Let me ash my issues
Ashtray is this asphalt
American spirits, black coffee, conversations and a passport
When God gives you everything
Everything that you ever asked for
And it still looks a bit different
Then when you pictured it on that back porch, and I'm gone
World traveler all I got is my songs
When the nights start blending into one another and I don't recall
Tom Petty in this motherfucker, all I wanna do is free fall
Yeah free fall
And I'm so caught up, I'm caught up
I'm caught up and I'm so tired
Swore that I wouldn't stare into the light and guess who tried it
Shit I'm blinded by this lime light
This lime light, it's all night, it's all day
These bright lights, these bright lights
Once you turn 'em on, you can't walk away
Don't die here, don't die here
I came too far, I'm too great
But I'm too scared and I'm too afraid
To stare this world into its face
I'm almost home, I'm driving lost
My eyelids closed, light turns to grey
The cameras off, the show is over
You close the curtains and just escape

Arrows land, we’re fallin'
Arrows (arrows) were fallin'
Arrows land, we’re fallin'
Arrows (arrows) were fallin'

While your daughter sleeps in bed
And when she wakes up, will the world be the same?
Will my girl be afraid in the home of the brave?
See I hope, I hope, that it's gon' be alright
But what a hell of a night

Humanity is a privilege, we can't give in
When they build walls, we'll build bridges
This is resistance, we're resilient
When they spread hate, we shine brilliant
March by the millions 'til they hear the children
We found ourselves at a distance
Open up the jails and the overcrowded cells
When we oppress anyone, we oppress ourselves
Greatest gift I ever learned is helpin' someone else
You build, believe and build 'cause you forget about yourself
Service, purpose, works if you work it
Love everyone regardless of the God they worship
This isn't the Apocalypse
We can't address the hate 'til we acknowledge it
If Jesus was alive, would he let Mohammed in?
This isn't nature, my daughter hugs strangers
We teach fear and preach hatred
Put up a fence, scared to meet our neighbors
Think that if we let them in, they'll take advantage of us later
There's so much anger and this world is a razor

See I hope, I hope, that it's gon' be alright
But what a hell of a night

And we fight for the people that haven't had a voice
Fight for the first amendment, fight for freedom of choice
Fight for women's rights, if she does or doesn't care
We ride for all the queer folk and fight for all to get married
I'm not moving to Canada, not fleeing the nation
No time for apathy, no more tears and no complainin'
Gotta fight harder for the next four and what we're faced with

Remember the old days and praying for co-signs
When labels offer me pay, I said that I won't sign
I took my weakness and turned that into a weapon
And when everybody doubted me, I turned that to my leopard
So I stand up on the stage, it wasn't planned, see it was destined
Look at fifty-thousand people with their hands unto the heavens and said

So dear Spirit, I know I gotta take a chance

Travelled 'round the globe, I needed to slow down (that's right)
And no better feeling riding 'round in my hometown

No other person on this Earth could ever take my job
This my life, it was planned, I can't take it off
Bruised elbows, knees scraped, I learned to take a fall
My mistake, my mistake, karma waits, karma waits
But I'll be brave, I'll be brave
The pain stings more than I could take, I could take
I learn more from loss than the gain, than the gain
New state of mind, I feel like taking my time
And that laidback reclines, still pushing that '85
Like windows down, city passing by, like a timelapse
The weatherman be tripping, so that ceiling got that white rag, ay
We came so far, just some kids in the city trying to make some art
Leave some change in the fountain, hope to make my mark

I rely on that constant communication with my higher power
More so than anybody these days

Tryna get closer to spirt that enters the body
It's the vessel like I'm not in it
In fifty-something years, I won't be here
There'll be a kid with some headphones covering his ears
Walking 'round a hallway, dreaming of ideas
Find himself in the sound 'cause music is a mirror

What's your name worth when they mention yours?
When you leave here, are you stepping forward?
Can you remember your intention when they question yours?
They're gonna question yours, they're gonna question yours

Surrounded by people I love and respect
And a baby blue Cadillac hearse
Pulling me 'round the block that I rep

Like was I just alive for success
Or did I leave a better life for the rest?
My greatest achievement isn't the dollars
My greatest achievement isn't the followers
My greatest achievement isn't the accolades

Watching the light kiss her eyelids
Hearing her sing along to Chance
And being like, yeah, that's my kid

And the saxophone up on Coltrane train started to blow
Tender laying in the snow, turn on my headphones
Couple miles to go before I run out of road

We born worth dying, in-between we live
Love, prosper, hands to the sky, catch a gospel
Roll the dice, nah, I ain't bettin' on tomorrow
Chain looking like Orion's belt
Jacket looking something like a lion pelt
Had to take a break and find myself
They put me in a box by myself
The same writers criticizing my rhymes
Are the same writers that are gentrifying in Bed-Stuy
I can't even see the hate, I should probably check my eyes
I got fifty thousand phones pointed at me in the sky

Between a rock and a hard place
Cold blooded with a stone face
Fire breather, fire breather
Born under a blood moon
But the sun is coming up soon
Fire breather, fire breather
Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire
Fire breather, fire breather
Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire
Fire breather, fire breather

What the fuck you think I'm doing it for?
Hungry like it's my rookie year, and I'm new to the sport
The game is tied up, they looking at you in the fourth
Do you take the shot or pass it, this is ten-thousand hours
And I'm working on my Master's, liabilities, and assets
And I'm showing up to practice, shooting early, getting baskets
There's no father to my style, I'm just a freckle-faced fuck
The animal in the jungle, running, hunting with the habit (woo)
Abracadabra that shit was magic
It's '81 and Madonna is on me dancing
I'm sorry mama, I got it, I know I should mind my manners
I'd probably go double-platinum if I could think of an ad-lib
I'm jazz Prince, I rap a lot
I grew up on Scarface, now Brad's my dog (woo)
Irish goodbye, sayonara and we mobbing
Put the nail in the coffin, motherfucker, I'm on one

Between a rock and a hard place
Cold blooded with a stone face
Fire breather, fire breather
Born under a blood moon

Macklemore,"I wish somebody would have told me babe
Some day, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
Someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of these good old days

I was thinking about the band
I was thinking about the fans
We were underground
Loaded merch in that 12-passenger van
In a small club in Minnesota
And the snow outside of 1st Ave
I just wanted my name in a star
Now look at where we at
Still growing up, still growing up
I'd be laying in my bed and dream about what I'd become
Couldn't wait to get older, couldn't wait to be someone
Now that I'm here, wishing I was still young
Those good old days

I wish somebody would have told me babe
That some day, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
'Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of the good old days

Wish I didn't think I had the answers
Wish I didn't drink all of that glass first
Wish I made it to homecoming
Got up the courage to ask her
Wish I would've gotten out of my shell
Wish I put the bottle back on that shelf
Wish I wouldn't have worry about what other people thought
And felt comfortable in myself
Rooftop open and the stars above
Moment frozen, sneaking out, and falling in love
Me, you and that futon, we'd just begun
On the grass, dreaming, figuring out who I was
Those good old days

I wish somebody would have told me babe
That some day, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
'Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of the good old days

Never thought we'd get old, maybe we're still young
Maybe we always look back and think it was better than it was
Maybe these are the moments
Maybe I've been missing what it's about
Been scared of the future, thinking about the past
While missing out on now
We've come so far, I guess I'm proud
And I ain't worried about the wrinkles around my smile
I've got some scars, I've been around
I've felt some pain, I've seen some things, but I'm here now
Those good old days

You don't know, what you've got
Till it goes, till it's gone
You don't know, what you've got
Till it goes, till it's gone

I wish somebody would have told me babe
Some day, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
Someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of these good old days",Good Old Days,2017

But I won't ever tell my brother
And now I wonder where's the good gone?
'Cause I can't find no miracles 'til I go home
Oh, I wonder where's the good gone?
Need to find me some hope
Where's my miracle? Where's my miracle?
Where's my miracle?

It's been a long night
I just might wake up on the wrong side
I tell myself it'll be alright
Sunlight peaking through the dark sky
Bottle it up, fall in the cut, all out of luck
Drowning in this quicksand and I swallow mud
I taste temptation and I fall in and out of love
Grab her hand, taxi cab, in God we trust

You can wish on all the stars way up in the galaxy
They want you to fall apart so they can have a piece
I threw a hundred in a wishing well
And then I came back for a refund
Said all this pressure just might tip the scale
Seen it before, it's just a re-run
So keep running, ay, I keep running

My troubles test me on the daily
They say that only God can save me
I think I'm slowly going under

My palms together, praying, but I keep on thinking 'bout evil
Snake bit in blood, and the poison, it ain't leaving
Wanna sabotage everything, one and only enemy
If these walls could talk, they'd have a lot of blackmail
Is karma real or not? I can't tell
The devil complimented me and said, ""You dance well""
But prayers won't save me, and neither will the fan mail
I'd be a sinner, but thank God I'm not religious
And I'm addicted, drugs and women, there's no difference

I guess I never thought I'd have to choose
Between paradise and you

I still creep on your 'Gram, oh
See you with you and your man, oh
And I scroll and see the pictures you deleted
Like the history ain't happen long as we cannot see it
Getting back is insanity and we repeat it
Mama said we need counseling
But I can't reason with the terrorists
Oh, this is embarrassing
You ain't Cinderella, ain't no pumpkin turning into fuckin' carriages
You create a narrative, people ask me, ""Where's she been?""
Send her back and now she's living back out at her parent's crib
Fight, break up, we fuck, we fight, break up, you know the deal
Vent to friends and tell them, ""It's the last time, I'm for real""
You text me, then the next thing you know, I'm behind the wheel
Pull up, you in the backseat thinking this will help us heal
There's no use for you texting my phone

Can't get in the gate because I changed the code

Back on the ""Shit, I was busy""
Back to us raising our voices
Back on that nobody's listening
Back to those horrible choices
Back on you moving back home
'Cause I would rather live in Hell than get comfortable sleeping alone
Back to that lying deception, back to the self-will
Back on that ""Well, she don't do it and I know that somebody else will""
You cheated, I cheated, you cheated, I cheated, I mean it
Please, Father, forgive us
The dirt that you've done and the secrets that we swept 
Up under the rug that are gonna die with us
And I should've cut the ties so many times
That I finally gave up on the scissors
We are both sinners if we both lie to ourselves
That is just selfish, that isn't commitment
I try to hold it in, I try to hold it in
Numb to it all and ignoring it
I'm just searching where the closure is
Going in circles, not noticing
But in my heart, I know I'm not over it

Oh no, oh no, we been grinding from the go
Jump start, I just bought a new whip, push start
Push the coupe down the highway like a go kart
All my niggas keep that toaster with them like a Pop Tart
Make her moan and she sound just like Mozart
Pure art
I think they mad because I broke into the game with a crowbar
Top the charts, Hip Hop ain’t the same we the new stars
Rock stars, look at all my chains call them ice pops
Ring pops, let the rain drop on the wrist watch
Fuck the cops, and fuck Donald Trump, bitch it’s Macklemore and Lil Boat
Anything else you need to know

I be riding through the town
My music loud
Windows down yeah you can hear me now
I turn it up, I need that bass
And my chain so bright can’t see my face

I thought you’d end up with my last name

And I travelled around the world
Think where you living at now?
I heard you moved to Oxford
Got an apartment and settled down
And every once in a while
I start texting
Write a paragraph
But then I delete the message
Think 'bout you like a past time
I could cry you a river
Get you baptised or
I wasn't ready to act right
Used to always think I'd get you back, right
They say that things fall apart (yeah)
We were gonna move to Brooklyn
You were gonna study Art (oh no, oh)

To remind us who we are
And that we are not alone

Return of the Mack', get up, what it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn’t
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the internet and checking a new hit
We get up, fresh out, pimp strut walking
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like, Rocky and Cosby, sweater game
Nope, nope, y'all can't copy that

Stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town

Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
With the fourtrack, bussin'

And I'm meeting at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on shark week, raw
Tell me go up, gone
Gone! Deuces, goodbye, I've got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar make you a believer, nah
I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes, so I'm giving it back to the people now
Sing that song and it goes like

Macklemore & Ryan Lewis,"And we drink and get older
And some of us even try to get sober
Now here's to the assholes and the last calls
Well city kids, you get what you ask for

And acquaintances turn to friends, I hope those friends they remember me
Hold the night for ransom as we kidnap the memories
Not sure there is a way to express what you meant to me
Sit around a table and use those ears as the centerpiece

Sounds of the city on Capitol Hill
Where I question if what I'm seeing here is real
Cowboy boots doing lines at the bar
Where the time goes slow when you're drinking PBR

Where I question if what I'm seeing here is real
Cowboy boots doing lines at the bar
Where the time goes slow when you're drinking PBR

Hold on to what you were, forget what you're not
The streets were ours that summer, at least those two blocks
Reminisce on those days, I guess that's OK, you wonder why
Some grow up, move on, close the chapter, live separate lives
The twenty-something confusion before the suit and tie
Strangers become mistakes but those mistakes make you feel alive
Hindsight is vibrant, reality: rarely lit
Memories to collage, paste to the glue that barely sticks
Good Lord, they broke all my shields
Locked bathroom doors, graffiti, and high heels
Until you felt that altitude you don't know how high feels
Party mountain, some don't ever come down from around here
To be young again, I guess it's relative
The camera lights, the whiskey rise, sink into the skin
I fantasize about a second win
Grow a mustache, pick up another bad habit and let the games begin

Where I question if what I'm seeing here is real
Cowboy boots doing lines at the bar
Where the time goes slow when you're drinking PBR

So here's to the nights, dancing with the band
Strangers into girlfriends from a one night stand
Brought a little liquor and turn up the Johnny Cash
You could bring a receipt to Heaven but you cannot take it back
And this is life, this is real, even when it feels like it isn't
I'd be a goddamn liar to say at times I didn't miss it
So deuces, I turn my back as I walk into the distance
Dip my feet in every once in a while, just to say I visit
And we hold onto these nights
Trying to find out way home by the street light
Over time we figure out this is me, right
Learn a lot about your friends right around two A.M

And acquaintances turn to friends, I hope those friends they remember me
Hold the night for ransom as we kidnap the memories
Not sure there is a way to express what you meant to me
Sit around a table and use those ears as the centerpiece

Macklemore & Ryan Lewis,"Everything is gold, everything is equal
Posted on the porch just chillin', me and my people
Eyelids closed, gold sun shines on
The world’s coated in the gold Krylon
Yea, and these days days days
They never run away
Gold tints, shades, that block out that golden haze
Take all the gold from the pawnshop that lives behind the case
And get to give it away
My gold erupted from volcano's in the heavens
And every shrine that existed in time melting
Tombs open, Dookie Ropes on the bells
When everything is gold, who cares about the carats?
They say that gold's the skin of the gods
You can’t take the band there when you’re gone
Now I’ll tip over that kiosk in the mall
As the sunset falls into tomorrow

Today we’re feeling like gold, five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, row fun, hella cold
And we stay fresh, so fresh head to toe
Ghost slowly faded, 14 carat plated
So we’re feeling like gold

Five hundred thousand soul
Slick rick gold, row fun, hella cold
Yea we’re feeling like gold
So fresh head to toe
Ghost slowly faded, 14 carat plated
So we’re feeling like gold

Alright now we open up that car door
Hop out, hope they notice us
Throughout society we been locked in that cobra clutch
More gold bottles, gold bottles, never sober up
Ditch Jesus, In gold I Trust
I solemnly swear to wear my cross and stunt
Separate myself by sticking out just because
That’s how you illustrate power and who you’re above
But nah, tonight we take it, take it, giving it back
Crack open the vault, let everyone mob in the bank
Take whatever they want, we party and give thanks
I've been rocking gold chains since pee was in the tank
You only live once, you only live once
Watch Rick Ross give his Jesus piece to a bum
'Cause tonight we ball, we ball, we comin’ up
Paintin' the globe gold, two steppin’ on the sun

Like gold, five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, row fun, hella cold
And we stay fresh, so fresh head to toe
Ghost slowly faded, 14 carat plated
So we’re feeling like gold

Oh, oh, oh, oh oh
Today we’re feeling like gold
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Gold coins, gold phone, gold car
Costs at least 10 racks to get 16 gold bars
Gold rush, suck on my gold dust stuntin'
Under these gold trunks, that’s 2 golden nugget
Flyin' on the gold eagle, flier than the rest of ‘em
Passing space needle, golden shower on pedestrians
Excuse me, that’s my bad, that’s my eagle and he shouldn’t of
My eagle got hair, that motherfucker got a mullet bruh
And it’s gold, two girls gold brass
Lounging on the water, feet in the gold sand
Sipping on Orangina, arms around them both pants
They’re sipping Olde English right out of a gold can
Two girls, gold spandex so pretty
That girl ain’t even gold, she just got golden girl titties
I’m kidding, everyone is gold in my city
You paint Betty White gold, even Betty White can get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it

Macklemore & Ryan Lewis,"I put my life on the line
I roll them dice and I'm fine
'Cause all I ever dreamt about was makin' it
They ain't giving it, I'm taking it

I’m taking it, taking it, they ain’t giving it
I’m taking it, taking it, they ain’t giving it
I’m taking it, taking it, they ain’t giving it
I’m taking it, taking it, I need all that shit

If I just went in and stole it, the police would of notice
Gotta be strategic, creepin', go in, leave with that motive
Hold up, my plan is forming, alright, caseing this building
Watch these rappers that rappin' walk in and leave out with millions
Headed in sweatin', open that front door
Interscope printed out right by the entrance, door closes
Not a metaphor, then I start towards
That front, that’s right, where you check in
Dressed in an uniform, acting like a janitor
All blue, jumpsuit, why shoot?
Bloodthirsty for the money like a bull
Looking in the eyes of the matador (fuck you!)
Carrying 2 cans of paint, security looks at me awkward
I say third floor i’m late, paintin' jimmy iovine's office
Holding my breath ‘bout to faint
I’m scared to death that he stops me
Heart beating so loud you can hear the echo in that lobby
And see I'm breaking down if I don’t make it out
Then i’m leaving town with that contract
And i’m spazzing out, grabbin' the a&r out
His chair and i’m taking him hostage
I don’t give a fuck, step into the elevator press 3
Now i’m headed up (heist!)
What they don't know is there is a gun in the paint can
And i’m ready and willing to bust ‘em, I'm fucking desperate
Stuck in this recession, now what you think
If I could get signed my life is destined
My future depends on ink
And secretary at the front of the entrance staring right at me
I walk up she whispers go ahead and then gives me a wink

I put my life on the line
I roll them dice and I'm fine
'cause all I ever dreamt about was makin' it
They ain't giving it, I'm taking it

I’m taking it, taking it, they ain’t giving it
I’m taking it, taking it, they ain’t giving it
I’m taking it, taking it, they ain’t giving it
I’m taking it, taking it, I need all that shit

If I get past security, the secretary, the cubicals
But it’s weird, it’s like this room i’ve walked into is unusual
Thought it would be shiny and beautiful
Thought it would be alive and like musical
But it feels like someone died, it’s got the vibe of a funeral
There’s numbers on a chalkboard
Cds boxed in cardboard
Artists that flopped, that got dropped and never got to be sophomores
Graphic designers are sitting around
Waiting for albums that never come out
Complainin’ that they have nobody in house
Wonderin’ what they make art for
I start thinking, am I in the right place?
Just walk forward, see plaques on the wall
Oh yea, in a second those will be all yours
Finally see an office with a mounted sign, heaven sent
Big block silver letters, read it out loud: president (nice!)
This was my chance to grab that contract and turn and jet
Right then felt a cold hand grab on the back of my neck
He said: we’ve been watching you, so glad you could make it
Your music gets so impressive in this whole brand you created
You're one hell of a band, we here think you’re destined for greatness
And with that right song we all know that you’re next to be famous
Now i’m sorry, i’ve had a long day remind me, now what your name is?
That’s right, macklemore, of course, today has been crazy
Anyway, you ready? we’ll give you a hundred thousand dollars
After your album comes out we’ll need back that money that you borrowed
So it’s really like a loan, a loan? come on, no
We're a team, 360 degrees, we will reach your goals!
We’ll get a third of the merch that you sell out on the road
Along with a third of the money you make when you’re out doing your shows
Manager gets 20, booking agent gets 10
So shit, after taxes you and ryan have 7% to split
That’s not bad, i’ve seen a lot worse, no one will give you a better offer than us (hmm)
I replied I appreciate the offer, thought that this is what I wanted
Rather be a starving artist than succeed at getting fucked",Jimmy Iovine,2012
Macklemore & Ryan Lewis,"Now, this is my job, I will not quit it
Pulled me out the depths when I thought that I was finished
Yeah I questioned if I could go the distance
That's just the work, regardless of who's listening, listening
Listen, see I was meant to be a warrior
Fight something amongst me, leave here victorious
Classroom of kids, or a venue performing
If I'd had done for the money I'd have been a fucking lawyer
Concrete, vagabond, van telling stories
Humbled by the road, I'm realizing I'm not important
See life's a beautiful struggle, I record it
Hope it helps you maneuvering through yours and
That's why we stay in the lab at night
I've been staring into this pad for over half my life

Forget about the fame, fortune and the mansion
Sitting and tripping watching myself on a plasma
Yeah, I start slipping when I'm thinking about that stuff
Ego won't swole until the karma catches that up, that up
I'm my grandma's number one grandson
I lost myself to remember who that was
We start thinking about some kicks, a necklace
What I really need is a job off Craigslist
Take away the dot com, name, love
Fans, twitter followers, and the buzz
See, you keep the issues but you take away the drugs
And I had to find out who I really was
Who I really wasn't
So sick of who I was becoming
Yeah, tired of running
Time to look at the man in the mirror until I can learn to love him

Make the money, don't let the money make you
Change the game, don't let the game change you

Uhm
1, 2, now

Round here they sing broken hymns
The prayers flow better when I’m soaked they're gin
The air is rusty and sits in the corner
Bad bartender that’ll pickpocket your heart
And a jukebox that’ll steal your quarter
Bartender, please give me a confession
Exchange fear for courage in the form of a well drink
There’s a heavy current, got a long way to swim
Closed the Bible a while ago, I need some shots for this sin
Hail Mary, come with me, feel like Pac when it hits
Got some fire in my belly and a riot in the gut
Bushmills for a band-aid, the sweet taste of blood
Then I might actually feel something if I don’t cover it up
Watch their faces, familiar places
Even if they didn’t left the vinyl booth that they stayed in
The motel next door, a sign that reads vacant
And a truth that’s so strong I’d be a fool not to chase it
But yea, I’m a fool and I stay here
Hope these problems bail themselves, I die in wait here
One more, four more, fuck it a night cap
Service starts at 5 tomorrow and I’ll be right back

Underneath this fragile frame
Lives a battle between pride and shame
But I’ve misplaced that sense of fight
This crown of thorns has punched the top my spine
But listen closely as I testify
Dependency has been a thief at night
Thief at night, thief at night

I read the Bible but I forgot the verses
The liquor store is open later than the churches
Pure by their imperfections, everything is burning
To hell with the confessions, oh the Lord immerses
Blessed in holy water, the sin of Holy Father
Have you ever smelled bless that smells atmonic Vodka
11 AM in the morning and you can’t get it off ya
Comment to the preacher but it’s like the pastor isn’t talking
Until the store opens I can read up on that doctrine
The people close to me say I’m in need of a doctor
Think that I got a problem but these are not apostles
This the drink of the Lord, that’s according to my gospel
Open to interpretation, if you’re judging it I don’t want it
I got tins that scole like my throat when I hit the bottle
And I’m sinking and that’s why I keep on drinking
I need a refill, bar more than once every weekend
Sweet Jesus, I’m getting amnesia
Shaking til I’d get a taste, my faith is having seizures
Every time I walk away and try to leave it
Every time I walk away and try to leave it

Wouldn’t miss it for the world
Baptized in my vices and the bar is my church
Traded my artist and I pawned off the easel
Spend it all searching for God at the neon cathedral

Macklemore & Ryan Lewis,"When I was in the 3rd grade I thought that I was gay 'cause I could draw,
My uncle was and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face, she's like,
""Ben you've loved girls since before pre-K""
Trippin', yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like ""Yeah, I'm good a little league""
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those who like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think its a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition. Playing God
Ahh nah, here we go
America the brave
Still fears what we don't know And God loves all his children it's somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written 3,500 hundred years ago
I don't know

If I was gay I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the Youtube comments lately
""Man that's gay"" Gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yeah, we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word routed in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
Gay is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that lead people to walk-outs and sit-ins,
It's human rights for everybody
There is no difference
Live on! And be yourself!
When I was in church, they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service Those words aren't anointed
And that Holy Water, that you soak in is then poisoned
When everyone else Is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans, that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same But that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal
Damn right I support it

I don't know

And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

We press play Don't press pause
Progress, march on!
With a veil over our eyes
We turn our back on the cause
'Till the day That my uncles can be united by law
Their kids are walkin' around the hallway
Plagued by pain in their heart
A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper
Isn't gonna solve it all, but it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us
We have to change us. Whatever God you believe in
We come from the same one
Strip away the fear
Underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up

Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried

08-10-08, but now it's been changed in every
When they put me in some boxes that say
That I never was, it's the false prophet that never came
And will they think that everything that I written has all been fake
Oh well I'll just take my slip to the grave
Uh, what the fuck are my parents gonna say?
The success story that got his life together and changed
And you know what pain looks like
When you tell your dad you relapsed and look him directly into his face
The seep on your shoulder's the seemingly heavy weight
I haven't seen tears like this on my girl
In a while the trust that I once built's been betrayed
But I'd rather live telling the truth than be judged for my mistakes
Them falsely held up, give em props, loved and praised
I guess I gotta get this on the page

Feeling sick and helpless, lost the compass where self is
I know what I gotta do and I can't help it
One day at a time is what they tell us
Now I gotta find a way to tell them
God help 'em
One day at a time is what they tell us
Now I gotta find a way to tell them

We fell so hard
Now we gotta get back what we lost, lost
I felt you'd go
But you were with me all along along

And every kid that came up to me
And said I was the music they listened to when they first got clean
Now look at me, a couple days sober
I'm fighting demons
Back of that meeting on the east side
Shaking tweakin', hope that they don't see it
Hope that no one is looking
That no one recognizes that failure under that hoodie
Was posted in the back with my hands crossed shooken
If they call on me I'm passing, if they talk to me I'm booking out that door
But before I can make it somebody stops me and says are you Macklemore?
Maybe this isn't the place or time
I just wanted to say that if it wasn't for other side I wouldn't have made it
I just look down at the ground and say thank you
She tells me she has 9 months and that she's so grateful
Tears in her eyes, looking like she's gonna cry fuck!
I barely got 48 hours, treated like I'm some wise monk
I wanna tell her I relapsed but I can't
I just shake her hand and tell her congrats
Get back to my car and I think I'm tripping yea
'Cause God wrote Otherside, that pen was in my hand
I'm just a flawed man, man I fucked up up
Like so many others I just never thought I would
I never thought I would, didn't pick up the book
Doin' it by myself, didn't turn out that good

If I can be an example of getting sober
Then I can be an example of starting over
If I can be an example of getting sober
Then I can be an example of starting over

We fell so hard
Now we gotta get back what we lost lost
I felt you'd go
But you were with me all along along

That the people decide to walk with him
Regardless of Pitchfork cosigns I've jumped
Make sure the soundman doesn't cock block the drums
Let the snare knock the air right out of your lungs
And those words be the oxygen
Just breathe
Hey man, regardless I'ma say it
Felt like I got signed the day that I got an agent
Got an iTunes check, shit man I'm paying rent
About damn time that I got out of my basement
About damn time I got around the country and I hit these stages
I was made to slay them
Ten thousand hours I'm so damn close I can taste it
On some Malcolm Gladwell, David Bowie meets Kanye shit
This is dedication
A life lived for art is never a life wasted
Ten thousand

Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand ants
Ten thousand ants, they carry me
Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand ants
Ten thousand ants, they carry me

Now, now, now
This is my world, this is my arena
The TV told me something different I didn't believe it
I stand here in front of you today all because of an idea
I could be who I wanted if I could see my potential
And I know that one day I'ma be him
Put the gloves on, sparring with my ego
Everyone's greatest obstacle, I beat him, celebrate that achievement
Got some attachments, some baggage I'm actually working on leaving
See, I observed Escher, I love Basquiat
I watched Keith Harring, you see I study art
The greats weren't great because at birth they could paint
The greats were great 'cause they paint a lot
I will not be a statistic, just let me be
No child left behind, that's the American scheme
I make my living off of words
And do what I love for work
And got around 980 on my SATs
Take that system, what did you expect?
Generation of kids choosing love over a desk
Put those hours in and look at what you get
Nothing that you can hold, but everything that it is
Ten thousand

Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand ants
Ten thousand ants, they carry me
Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand ants
Ten thousand ants, they carry me

Same shit, different day, same struggle
Slow motion as time slips through my knuckles
Nothing beautiful about it, no light at the tunnel
For the people that put the passion before them being comfortable
Raw, unmedicated heart no substitute
Banging on table tops, no subs to toot
I'm feeling better than ever man, what is up with you?
Scraping my knuckles, I'm battling with some drug abuse
I lost another friend, got another call from a sister
And I speak for the people that share that struggle too
Like they got something bruised
My only rehabilitation was the sweat, tears and blood when up in the booth

It's the part of the show where it all fades away
When the lights go to black and the band leaves the stage
And you wanted an encore but there's no encore today
'Cause the moment is now, can't get it back from the grave

And on on, and on, and on we go
We love who we are but now it's gone
Let's leave before we eat each other alive
Alive

Same city, yeah, we can't break up
Nice mask on, wear the same one
The greatest trick that the devil ever pulled
Was convincing women that they looked
Better in their makeup
I wear war paint, fight to the casket
Too tired to apologize on this mattress
Emotional detachment, what's the matter?
She's learning that she never should have
Dated a rapper
I don't blame her, my mind is gone
I'm at dinner, checking phone calls
Texts & blogs
I don't hear a word, I know nothing at all
Just concerned about the world
Memorizing these songs

Goes on and on
Don't wanna break you
But I'm leading you on
On, on, on, on
And now it's gone

And on on, and on, and on we go

You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
This time we know we know
It's over, over

Didn't believe in love until we fell out
Gave the keys back, now I'm on the homie's couch
Always going out, sleeping ‘round with strangers
Danger! But you can't live without her
Now you're paranoid, checking on her cellphone
Making sure she ain't like you alone
Haven't made love with the lights still on
It's like you're hiding something from me

Let's fake another toast to the good life
Predict the future, clean slate, blue sky
Fantasy, I see me husband, you wife
Lyin', staring into those two eyes
And I can't take it, back to where we came from
My pavement, past the emotional earthquake foundation
Yeah, let's keep swimming in the snake pit
Get bit, get out then jump back into the suffocation
Make up and fuck to save us like we got this
Come on, this is just us baby
And this is just a fight, this is just love, maybe
Is it just you or am I fucking crazy?
I swear to god, I wish that I could Photoshop the scars off
Cold world and get all my heart throbbed
And I said it all and never get lock jaw
Mouth is a saw, a shock at any second could pop off
How does the truth taste?
My job comes with complimentary toothpaste
Lately, I've been living up out of my suitcase
Building trust in that I'm leaving on Tuesday
Bought a one night stand, just a bootleg
A duplication of something authentic
Heart augmented, and it's so hard to end it
I said peace before but this time I meant it

Can't get her out of my head
This place is a mess
Holding onto cobwebs
That has us both on the fence
She walks that thin line
In and out of my bed
Each time I love her less

Can't get her out of my head
This place is a mess
Holding onto cobwebs
That has us both on the fence
She walks that thin line
In and out of my bed

And twenty is the new thirty shit I guess
Makes sense, cause fifteen year olds seem twenty
And twenty five year olds seem ten
I used to drink away my paycheck
Celebrate the mistakes I hadn't made yet
Our generation isn't the best on safe sex
We forget the latex, becoming Planned Parenthood patients
Synthetic heroin is the new basshead
So much to escape, fuck a straight edge
Walk around looking through a fake lens
Apps this good, whose got time to make friends?
I wish I didn't care
Acynical hispters with long hair
Cocaine problems, like my music
It's not my issue, I can't solve it

My flight has finally landed down
And the ground has stopped moving all around
Eyes open, awake for the very first time
We both forfeit this game of crime

They say it's so refreshing to hear somebody on records
No guns, no drugs, no sex, just truth
The guns that's America, the drugs are what they gave to us
And sex sells itself, don't judge her 'til it's you
Ah, I'm not more or less cautious
The rappers rappin' 'bout them strippers up on the pole, copping
These interviews are obnoxious
Saying that it's poetry is so well spoken, stop it
I grew up during Reaganomics
When Ice T was out there on his killing cops shit
Or Rodney King was getting beat on
And they let off every single officer
And Los Angeles went and lost it
Now every month there is a new Rodney on Youtube
It's just something our generation is used to
And neighbourhoods where you never see a news crew
Unless they're gentrifying, white people don't even cruise through
And my subconscious telling me stop it
This is an issue that you shouldn't get involved in
Don't even tweet, R.I.P Trayvon Martin
Don't wanna be that white dude, million man marchin'
Fighting for our freedom that my people stole
Don't wanna make all my white fans uncomfortable
But you don't even have a fuckin' song for radio
Why you out here talkin race, tryin' to save the fuckin' globe
Don't get involved with the causes in mind
White privilege, white guilt, at the same damn time
So we just party like it's nineteen ninty nine
Celebrate the ignorance while these kids keep dying

Inside my Cadillac, That is my shit
And I throw it up (I throw that up)
That’s what it is (That’s what it is)
In my C A D I L L A C bitch (biatch)
Can’t see me through my tints (Nah ah)
I’m riding real slow (slow motion)
In my paint wet drippin shorty like my 24’s (Umbrella)
I ain’t got 24’s (No oh)
But I’m on those Vogues
That’s those big white walls, round them hundred spokes
Old school like old English in that brown paper bag
I’m rolling in that same whip that my granddad had
Hello haters, Damn y’all mad
30k on the Caddy, now how backpack rap is that?

I Got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m blowin’ that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

Man I’m lounging in some shit Bernie Mac would’ve been proud of
Looking down from heaven like damn that’s stylish
Smilin’, don’t pay attention to the mileage
Can I hit the freeway? I’m legally going 120
Easy weaving in and out of the traffic
They cannot catch me, I’m smashing
I’m ducking bucking them out here
I’m like go fuckin their tastic, I am up in a classic
Now I know what it’s like under the city lights
Riding into the night, driving over the bridge
The same one we walked across as kids
Knew I’d have a whippin’ but never one like this
Old school, old school, Candy paint, two seater
Yea, I’m from Seattle, There’s hella Honda Civics
I couldn’t tell you about paint either
But I really want a Ducati so I put in the hours
And roll on over to the dealer
And I found the car, junior, problem with this geezer
Got the keys in and as I was leaving I started screaming

I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m blowin’ that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

Backwoods and dope
White hoes in the backseat snorting coke
She doing line after line like she’s writing rhymes
I had it hella my love, tryna blow her mind
Cadillac pimpin’, my uncle was on
14 years out so excuse me and my niggas was gone
Sendin’ portions of his liquor, water in the Patron
Rather smiling like I won the fucking lottery homes
(Fuckin' lottery homes)
Tires with the spokes on it in the 4-2
Most of the mayonnaise, keeping the buns on ‘em
My dogs hanging out the window
Young as whoosh, fuckin like we ball
Tryna fuck em all, kill the fuckin wimps
See what’s poppin’ at the mall, meet a bad bitch
Slap her booty with my palms, you can smoke the pussy, I was tearing down the walls
I’m motherfuckin’ off
Son, swear these eyes tryna hypnotize
Grip the leather steering wheel while I grip the thighs
See the lust stuck up in her eyes, maybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke?
Or does she want it low? This shit a Coupe de Ville so you’ll never know
So we cool with niggas, my nigga fuck the limit
Got a window tinted for showing gangstas in it
Slice off when the gas is finished, Q

Macklemore & Ryan Lewis,"I was seven years old, when I got my first pair
And I stepped outside
And I was like, momma, this air bubble right here, it's gonna make me fly
I hit back-court, and when I jumped, I jumped, I swear I got so high
I touched the net, Mom  I touched the net, this is the best day of my life
Air Max's were next,
That air bubble, that mesh
The box, the smell, the stuffin', the tread, in school
I was so cool, I knew that I couldn't crease 'em
My friends couldn't afford 'em, Four stripes, some Adidas
On the court I wasn't the best, but my kicks were like the pros
Yo, I stick out my tongue so everyone could see that logo
Nike Air Flight, but bad was so dope
And then my friend Carlos' brother got murdered for his fours, whoa

See he just wanted a jump shot, but they wanted to start a cult though
Didn't wanna get caught, from Genesee Park to Othello
You could clown for those Probings, with the Velcro, those were not tight
I was trying to fly without leaving the ground,'cause I wanted to be like Mike, right
Wanted to be him, I wanted to be that guy, I wanted to touch the rim
I wanted to be cool, and I wanted to fit in,
I wanted what he had, America, it begins

I wanna fly
Can you take me far away
Gimmie a star to reach for
Tell me what it takes
And I'll go so high
I'll go so high
My feet won't touch the ground
Stitch my wings
And pull the strings
I bought these dreams
That all fall down

We want what we can't have, commodity makes us want it
So expensive, damn, I just got to flaunt it
Got to show 'em, so exclusive, this that new shit
A hundred dollars for a pair of shoes I would never hoop in
Look at me, look at me, I'm a cool kid
I'm an individual, yea, but I'm part of a movement
My movement told me be a consumer and I consumed it
They told me to just do it, I listened to what that swoosh said
Look at what that swoosh did. See it consumed my thoughts
Are you stupid, don't crease 'em, just leave 'em in that box
Strangled by these laces, laces I can barely talk
That's my air bubble and I'm lost, if it pops
We are what we wear, we wear what we are
But see I look inside the mirror and think Phil Knight tricked us all
Will I stand for change, or stay in my box
These Nikes help me define me, but I'm trying to take mine, off

I wanna fly
Can you take me far away
Gimmie me a star to reach for
Tell me what it takes
And I'll go so high
I'll go so high
My feet won't touch the ground
Stitch my wings
And pull the strings
I bought these dreams
That all fall down

I started out, with what I wear to school
That first day, like these are what make you cool
And this pair, this would be my parachute
So much more than just a pair of shoes
Nah, this is what I am, what I wore, this is the source of my youth

And a front lawn, and a fuckin' wedding ring
I danced in paris
I swam in oceans, felt the scales
Put my cd in starbucks, it did not sell
Get the cd out my car, turned it into myself
These piano keys hold some weight
In a bolo tie I escort my date

Want a co-sign and a whole track this year

Judging me off of my past, you don't see what I'm doing

The non-profit for the kids in the hood
That ain't got no option in them shelter homes plottin' shit
I'm just doing what I should
They must want no one to know
Cause they don't put that on the news bro
They entertained by the culture, they vultures
They suck us like leaches 'til we broke
But I know the game so I play it like chess
Act like a square but really be the threat
The next time my name in the press
Talk about how yg gave them kids christmas

Seven bucks an hour wasn’t much money

I was in the back, back seat of the bus before a bluetooth
Got the boombox and a blunt, bootlegger deuce-deuce
H on my crew, we get drunk, a little coo-coo
Type of dudes who square up and knock a tooth loose
Quick to the basement, the, the, the basement
That is the window I’m planning to vacate with
Pops put on bars just in case somebody breaks in
That’s not gonna stop me from getting to the pavement
Shh, meeting Jerome at the bus stop
I got the bigger roll, paranoid buck cops
And all my city’s known for grunge, flannel, puck rock
And a bunch of Sub Pop, I was on that Buckshot

Bang, bang, let me do my thing
Give me two cans and you gon’ know my name

You know I be on these overpasses burning bridges, dog
You know I be dippin' through these alleys tryna diss the law
Sixteen with Adidas on
I’m too speedy for police I’m chiefin' through these streets, I’m gone
I got game, don’t need to talk anymore
Boppity-bo, tippity-toppity, I pop me some more
I was underground where he came from and he pop out a hole
Cracked the top back on the flat black aerosol
I woke up in the morning and I had a vision
These suit and ties got the nerve to call it vandalism
They hella mad, say my art is really bad for business
But I'mma paint a better world until the cans are empty
Now let it drip, let it drip
If they catch me doing dirt I’ll plead the fifth

Turn up the CD or turn up the TV
Turn up your T-A-P-E, turn your phone up, crank up the PC

See, we call it aerosol art when we splatter the city

But your dad has shed a lot of tears
They say I should be a strong man
But baby, I'm still filled with fear
Sometimes I don't know who I am
Sometimes I question why I'm here
I just wanna be a good dad
Will I be I have no idea
They say girls shouldn't be tough
And moms should raise their kids at home
But baby, I know that that isn't true
'Cause your momma's the toughest person I know
I wanna raise you to be like her
And watch you show the world how to do it on your own
I'm still tryna figure out who I am
I don't wanna mess this up or do this wrong
I'm gonna be there for your first breath
I don't know if I'll be there for your first step
I can promise you that I'll try to work less
But the tour's routed, and I got this album
Put in so many hours, and I just want the outcome
To be something that I can look back and I can be proud of
Don't wanna be a dad that's living in FaceTime
But I've got a world to sing to and you at the same time
I won't spoil you, you can trust that
For your sweet sixteen, you get a bus pass
Had your heart broken, been there, done that
I love you and I can't give you enough of that
Get back to community that raised you up
Read Langston Hughes, I suggest A Raisin in the Sun
Listen to Sam Cooke, a change gon' come
You put the work in, don't worry about the praise, my love
Don't try to change the world, find something that you love
And do it every day
Do that for the rest of your life
And eventually, the world will change

I'll be patient, one more month
You'll wrap your fingers round my thumb
Times are changing, I know, but who am I if
I'm the person you become
If I'm still growing up, up, up, up
I'm still growing up, up, up, up
I'm still growing up

I recommend that you read The Alchemist
Listen to your teachers, but cheat in calculus
Tell the truth, regardless of the consequence
And every day, give your momma a compliment
Take your girl to the prom
But don't get too drunk hanging out the limo
Slow dance with your woman in your arms
Sneak her in after but boy, you better tiptoe
Don't wake your mom up,do yoga, learn 'bout karma
Find God, but leave the dogma
The quickest way to happiness learning to be selfless
Ask more questions, talk about yourself less
Study David Bowie, James Baldwin and 2Pac
Watch the sun set with best friends from a rooftop
Wear a helmet, don't be stupid,jaywalk, but look before you do it
If it snows, go outside, build a jump, get some help
Get a sled, thrash the hill with your friends, 'til it melts
Go to festivals, camp, fall in love and dance
You're only young once, my loved one, this is your chance
Take risks, 'cause life moves so fast
You're only young once, my loved one, this is your chance

Macklemore & Ryan Lewis,"Okay, okay
Yeah
And we live tonight
Check it, now

I seen pain, I felt the losses
Attended funerals and seen coffins
21 years old, an angel was lost here
Wings clipped by the grip of 80 milligram sniffs of Oxycontin
Everyday through the nostrils
Never went away, never does it stop there
Death a line or two away and a couple tall cans
'Cause you never know when God is gonna call, man
Precious, what we all share
I said peace at five thirt, the next time that I saw him was in the hands of the pallbearer
What if I would've never gone and dropped him off there?
Blaming myself, in hysterics, screaming ""It's not fair!""
21 years old with a book of rhymes he was gonna recite to the globe
Only thing to numb the pain besides that shit in his nose
He was gonna quit tomorrow, we're all gonna quit tomorrow
Just get us through the weekend, and then Monday follows
Then it's Wednesday, then it's fuck it, I'm already feeling hollow
Might as well go crack a seal and might as well go chug a bottle
Might as well go pop a pill and go and band-aid that problem
And escape this world, vacate this world
'Cause I hate myself
No praying's gonna cure this pain

Doctor, please, give me a dose of the American Dream
Put down the pen and look in my eyes
We're in the waiting room and something ain't right
All this is on you, we're over prescribed

For me and Kev
You end up in jail, institutions are dead
And with our lives, we play Russian Roulette
And try to find a life where we could be content
'Cause for us, we're just trying to minimize the fear of being alive
And now my little brother is in the sky
From a pill that a doctor prescribed
That a drug deal a million dollar industry supplied
And the cops never go and profile at night
Yeah, the, the, the orange plastic with the white top they sell to you
Has us looking for the answers and not instead of you
Quick fix, whatever do
We just gonna neglect the truth
Because a doctor with a license played God and said it's cool
Played God and said it's cool
But me? I don't blame Kev or his mom freebasing while pregnant with him
I blame the pharmacy companies
And country that spends trillions fighting the war they supplying themselves
Politicians and business and jail
Public defenders and judges who fail
Look at Kevin, look at Kevin
Now he's wrapped in plastic
First dealer was his mom's medicine cabinet
Got anxiety, better go and give him a Xanax
Focus, give him Adderall, sleep, give him Ambien
'Til he's walking 'round the city looking like a mannequin
Ups and downs, shooting up prescriptions you're handing him
So America, is it really worth it? I'm asking you

Doctor, please, give me a dose of the American Dream
Put down the pen and look in my eyes
We're in the waiting room and something ain't right

I'd like to order a hot dog, some bon bons
A large soda, and some tacos to go

With a really huge package
I wanna be the 2015 Batman

Everybody got a resolution
But the next day, we forget about it never do 'em

Five minutes on the treadmill and I never lift
That was four years ago I should probably cancel this
But they tell me I gotta do it in person, ain't that a bitch?
But tomorrow though, I'mma get fit
Get me a fuel band and a fit-bit
Get me some workout shoes, and a bench press
Some lulu lemons and a french press
I'mma finally focus do some private yoga
Exercise my shoulders, I'mma hide the donuts
Realign my posture, no time for sofas
I'm finally sober no lime Coronas
But again, that's tomorrow
And today man I gotta go big cause it's my last day
Before I lose that weight, I gotta get one last plate and go big
I ate all night, Kool-Aid on ice
I woke up and I felt like shit

I should probably start on Monday instead""

Past lives in light tunnels
Light tunnels

In the back of a town car, staring at myself in a tux
Maneuvering through the people out front
Police barricade, orange cones and we're stuck
Twenty minutes late and my manager blowing me up
Security guard in the garage at the entrance
Rolled down the window and showed him our credentials
[?] flash the pass and he let's us continue
Metal detectors, phone booths and reception
I should be grateful this my nine to five
I walk into the green room, alright, alright
I get on Youtube tryna learn how to tie on my tie
Fuck it, I'll wear the bolo tonight, night, night
I probably shouldn't have done the drugs I've done
A couple of days ago, detox son
I forgot my belt at the hotel
Fuck, now my team all scared my [?] sucks
I need something to cope, ain't nothing to cope
I eat a banana and I drink a cup of throat coat
I wish I had the homies with me here but nope
Most of the artists that I know don't get invited to this show
Because success to them determines our value
The make-up, the power, the hairspray, perfume, make-up and powder
The ratings come down to who's popular now in the song in the hour
Knock at the door, I let them in, hair and make up now, red carpet in ten
She covers up my freckles, concealer on my chin
I look orange but she swears it looks natural with my skin
The show is starting, they take me to my seat
Walk in the arena building, ego of elites
Like the whole industry is staring at me
A row away from Taylor, two away from Jay and B

Last night the sky's turned purple and
Past lives in light tunnels
Light tunnels
So that's who we are
Just like the stars
Shine your light on
Shine your light on

Curtain opens up, host walks out
We stand in unison and applaud real loud
I watch the other people that have been around for a while
Just excited I got invited, feeling cool in the crowd
Thinking such and such is bold, look at such and such's gold
Damn, such and such in real life, looks really fuckin' old
Such and such is fine, she's with such and such, oh
I'm here but I'm barely even watching the show
Cause tonight we toast to our accomplishments
Insecurity dressed up as confidence
I said tonight we toast to our accomplishments
Insecurity dressed up as confidence
An award is given out, commercial, re-set the scene
They keep saying ""coming soon is the Biebs""
Watch celebrities take selfies with celebrities
It feels so make believe
They want the gossip, they want the drama
They want Britney Spears to make out with Madonna
They want Kanye to rant and to go on longer, cause that equates to more dollars
They want talking topics, they want trending topics
They want outfits to be outlandish, they want sideways glances
Beef and problems, they want nipple slips
Cause they live for clips, this is economics
So we Botox our skin and we smile for the camera
Might as well get a new nose while we're at it
This is America and insecurity's our fabric
And we wear it and we renamed it fashion
I look to my right, there's a cameraman snapping
Picture after picture after sister after sister
Of the line of Kardashians, mind so distracted
Realized there's an ovation and everyone's clapping

Last night the sky's turned purple and
Past lives in light tunnels
Light tunnels
So that's who we are
Just like the stars
Shine your light on
Shine your light on

It's just weird when the camera's on you
Gotta remember to still clap if I lose
I see myself on the screen
Split into five different artists on TV
And just look normal, don't get turned into a meme
Relax, breathe
Me
There's a stranger holding my award
I give her an awkward hug she says ""It's yours""
Think I'm supposed to kiss her on the cheek
Man, I should have prepared an acceptance speech
Do I talk first? Is it Ryan? Is it me?
Fuck it, I'll take the lead, grab the mic, say my piece
Do I look at camera one? Do I look at camera three?
I promise, I'm honored, I'd like to thank God, my momma and father
I'd like to thank Trisha, the mother of my daughter
I couldn't have done it without you all in my corner
Especially the fans, been here since the beginning
Supported the music, allowed us to be independent
And I know, I shouldn't be long winded
Wait hold up, don't play the music let me finish
This feels so narcissistic
Dressed as a celebration to conceal it's a business
Me, me, me, my my image
My, my songs, my self interest
One big reality show that is scripted
And I could keep trying or get out the competition
I rather run out of my fifteen minutes than have life
Pass me by and I forget to live it
But, that doesn't mean retirement
But I don't like who I am in this environment
I forgot what this art is for
I didn't get through freshman year to get out as a sophomore
Here I am in this arena, yeah I'm scared
I got the people's attention don't want to lose it here
Thinking about my career, miserable here
But wanna make sure I'm invited next year
To the same damn party, celebrities on isle
Same blank stares, same fake smiles
Same big budget production
I know now who I am when the lights go out and it falls down
And the curtain closes, nobody notices
Wanted to throw up the Roc, wanted to be Hova
Wanted to be Wayne with the accent from the NOLA
Thought I'd feel better when the award show was over
But I guess I showed up late
Almost got cut off when they closed the gate

Time to explain this unruly mess I've made

Macklemore & Ryan Lewis,"Washing out cigarettes in the bathroom
Should probably only give my opinion when I'm asked to
I'm really good at telling the half truth but usually only when I have to
The money doesn't work, the chain doesn't work
Something broken in my brain, got me praying in the dirt
Got me stranded in my bed like I'm laying in the hearse
And the grass is always greener when you play on astroturf
Wonder why my generation poppin' pills and poppin' percs
And got some weed and got some purp
And got some bars and got some syurp
And got some Jordan's on my feet, I went and matched them with my shirt
And I just Instagrammed them both to show you that I got them first
Got a Louis duffel bag, I got my girl a purse
I'm tryna find God through a purchase, I'm not tryna go to church
Amen, Satan, told me not to serve
I only think about myself, I only think about my worth
I only think about my come-up, capitalism
Look at where we come from, we are what we run from
We are why we smoke some, so numb, so numb, so numb

I cry when she smile with her eyes closed
I'm already afraid to tight clothes
I want all her best friends to be white folks
I scratched out this line so many times, I can't forget it
It's fucked up, I almost say it almost every time that I edit
I swear rapping make it easy to lie
But secrets don't make it easy to write
I met the devil in Manhattan, quickly ended discussion
I don't need a thing, he warned of repercussions
But I know he come in all forms, that won't be his last visit
Time is moving fast and I'm running where the past is
Looking in the mirror like, ""Damn that ain't my dad, is it?""
He handed a choice but he ain't hold my hand in it
I spent a pretty penny on microphones, many midis
In years and cds, I put the indy in Windy City
Indian giver, Black father, White liar
Right next to Eazy like Mike Myers
Stare at the cue cards, take out the juke parts
Take out the God references, just leave the cool parts
I remember opening for Ben, wasn't no liquor at the show
And now the white girls call me nigga at my show
I wish that I could open twice, sit down at the open mic

Macklemore & Ryan Lewis,"I think happiness went the other way
Sometimes you just have to wait
I never believed in God
But things got so fucked up
That I had to pray
I used to steal my Daddy's cabernet
Never thought it would turn into a rattlesnake
Thinkin', everything will be all right
If we could get thru the week
Maybe see another Saturday
All the while where we know where to go
Argue with the homies over who's gonna roll
Bumpin' Goodie Mob as some food for the soul
Till it's two in the morning
When rain hits the windshield
And everything is still
Nothing really is a big deal?
One hand on the steering wheel
And we gon' be all right

I had a brown paper bag
St. Ides in that motherfucker
In the city where we smash
5-0 comin' then you know I'm running
Crawling broken fences, when shit gets hard
You know who your friend is
And I lose perspective
Need to go to a place where I lose reception
Looking at the satellites pass by
Reflectin' on my past life
I can barely remember last night
Another  morning, swear its the last time
Where would I be?
Can't start over if you don't get a new ID
I know the devil fancy me
But that don't mean that motherfucker gets to dance with me

I bought a house, second guessing what I own now (What?)
Traffic moving kinda slow now (What?)
I watch the population grow wild (What?)
A bunch of people I don't know now (What?)
My city's changed and I'm zoned out
I thought about New York, maybe SoCal
Put up condos people can't afford now
Marks bulldozed been tore down
Overpopulated but the city is a ghost town
Keep a little real ones with me
When it goes down
Lack of diversity, I think about Sloane now
Only reason I would ever leave my hometown
If I still drink, I would crack a 40 ounce
Parents finally left, moved away, and they sold the house
It's really hard to ignore it now
Wish that we could sort it out
Last couple sips pour it out

And I could look the other way but it still won't erase the pain
And I pray that she stay the same, amazing grace
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Just another reflection in the window
Watchin' the trees pass by the tempo
Got a round trip ticket out to limbo
And I'm getting close to my kinfolk
I'm sorry that you didn't get the memo
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Water run under bridges
Always on the road tryna earn a livin'
I remember when I bought my first ticket
I been going haven't turned back since then
This return day must be a misprint
Made a wrong turn now I'm long distance
And I miss them

Otra cuidad, otra vida, otra, otra cuidad, ah, oh, oh, oh

I try to write but every sentence is a run on
I try to text you but I don't get reception in this tunnel
Vision, visit only for a minute
I'm gettin' off track but the world's still spinnin'
You can see the smoke in the distance, it billows
Roll up my sweatshirt, turn it into a pillow, aye
I got a polaroid camera so I don't forget where I travel
I got a couple rolls of film I'll get developed when I get back to Seattle
I told momma that I'd call her, talked for a couple minutes
But I didn't
I miss my brother, feel disconnected
Wanted to stay, wanted to catch the next one
I wanted to talk just me and him
Because I had some things I felt I had to tell him
When you're always runnin', tryna make a connection
It's almost impossible to stay connected
When you get on this train after standin' in the rain
You'd be crazy to ask her
And give your seat to the next one, nah
I'ma ride this shit till the wheels fall off
The conductor screams out all aboard last call
The city as you pass on, the city as you pass on

Macklemore & Ryan Lewis,"Pulled into the parking lot, parked it
Zipped up my parka, joined the procession of marchers
In my head like, ""is this awkward?
Should I even be here marching?""
Thinking if they can't, how can I breathe?
Thinking that they chant, what do I sing?
I want to take a stance 'cause we are not free
And then I thought about it, we are not ""we""
Am I in the outside looking in, or am I in the inside looking out?
Is it my place to give my two cents?
Or should I stand on the side and shut my mouth?
""No justice, no peace,"" okay, I'm saying that
They're chanting out, ""black lives matter,"" but I don't say it back
Is it okay for me to say? I don't know, so I watch and stand
In front of a line of police that look the same as me
Only separated by a badge, a baton, a can of Mace, a mask
A shield, a gun with gloves and hands that gives an alibi
In case somebody dies behind a bullet that flies out of the nine
Takes another child's life on sight

Blood in the streets, no justice, no peace
No racist beliefs, no rest 'til we're free
There's blood in the streets, no justice, no peace
No racist beliefs, no rest 'til we're free
Blood in the streets, no justice, no peace

You've exploited and stolen the music, the moment
The magic, the passion, the fashion, you toy with
The culture was never yours to make better
You're Miley, you're Elvis, you're Iggy Azalea
Fake and so plastic, you've heisted the magic
You've taken the drums and the accent you rapped in
Your brand of hip-hop, it's so fascist and backwards
That Grandmaster Flash'd go slap it, you bastard
All the money that you made
All the watered down pop-bullshit version of the culture, pal
Go buy a big-ass lawn, go with your big-ass house
Get a big-ass fence, keep people out
It's all stolen, anyway, can't you see that now?
There's no way for you to even that out
You can join the march, protest, scream and shout
Get on Twitter, hashtag and seem like you're down
But they see through it all, people believe you now?
You said publicly, ""rest in peace, Mike Brown""
You speak about equality, but do you really mean it?
Are you marching for freedom, or when it's convenient?
Want people to like you, want to be accepted?
That's probably why you are out here protesting
Don't think for a second you don't have incentive
Is this about you, well, then what's your intention?
What's the intention?
What's the intention?

""Pssst, I totally get it
You're by yourself and the last thing you want to do is take a picture
But seriously, my little girl loves you
She's always singing, 'I'm gonna pop some tags'
I'm not kidding, my oldest, you even got him to go thrifting
And 'One Love,' oh my God, that song, brilliant
Their aunt is gay, when that song came out
My son told his whole class he was actually proud
That's so cool, look what you're accomplishing
Even the old mom like me likes it, 'cause it's positive
You're the only hip-hop that I let my kids listen to
'Cause you get it, all that negative stuff it isn't cool""
(Yeah?) ""yeah, like, all the guns and the drugs
The bitches and the hoes and the gangs and the thugs
Even the protest outside, so sad, and so dumb
If a cop pulls you over, it's your fault if you run""
(Huh?)

Damn, a lot of opinions, a lot of confusion, a lot of resentment
Some of us scared, some of us defensive
And most of us aren't even paying attention
It seems like we're more concerned with being called racist
Than we actually are with racism
I've heard that silences are action and God knows that I've been passive
What if I actually read a article, actually had a dialogue
Actually looked at myself, actually got involved?
If I'm aware of my privilege and do nothing at all, I don't know
Hip-hop has always been political, yes
It's the reason why this music connects
So what the fuck has happened to my voice if I stay silent when black people are dying
Then I'm trying to be politically correct?
I can book a whole tour, sell out the tickets
Rap entrepreneur, built his own business
If I'm only in this for my own self-interest, not the culture that gave me a voice to begin with
Then this isn't authentic, it is just a gimmick
The D.I.Y underdog, so independent
But the one thing the American dream fails to mention
Is I was many steps ahead to begin with
My skin matches the hero, likeness, the image
America feels safe with my music in their systems
And it's suited me perfect, the role, I've fulfilled it
And if I'm the hero, you know who gets cast as the villain
White supremacy isn't just a white dude in Idaho
White supremacy protects the privilege I hold
White supremacy is the soil, the foundation, the cement and the flag that flies outside of my home
White supremacy is our country's lineage, designed for us to be indifferent
My success is the product of the same system that let off Darren Wilson, guilty

Big timing all the time, nigga been stuntin'
Pearl white Maybach, nigga spent a mill
Bugatti for 2, on the hill
Shining with my strap in my right pocket
Hundred thousand a day on that sky rocket
From round the block doing this shit round the clock
Million dollar nigga doing this sh-t non-stop
Swagged out, big dogging on a private flight
Popping bottles, celebrating living life
Blowing big, freelander down ?
YMCMB nigga, rich gang

[Chorus]

Ugh, big dawg shit nigga
I'm on my feet like dog shit nigga
Tell 'em hatin' n-ggas miss me with that hatin' shit
And tell them bitches, my dick got a waiting list
I ain't trippin' nigga I'm just taking trips
Put the money on the trampoline and make it flip
Young mack, stupid mack ?
I just bought a coupe, the roof is translucent
Pockets on etc, money talk bullsh-t, walk like George Jefferson
Virgins they ain't fucking with us
Young money cash money
Fuck them other n-ggas

[Chorus]

If I ain't getting money, than I'm getting p-ssy
I don't play with you p-ssies get a silver bullet
I know you looking so how I look
I don't fuck with n-ggas, call me George Bush
It's tunechi baby, the money man
The money talks, now I understand
That chopper make a nigga do the running man
I would take a girl and turn her p-ssy to a punching bag
I'ma stunt my ass off, bitch that's word to stunna man
School these bitch ass n-ggas, you are undergrad
The world is in my hand, smack the shit out you with my other hand
Young money, cash money, welcome to wonderland

He knows everything we?re doin?, and he don?t make a fuss
There ain?t nothin? that he does not know
He is a powerful man, and what he says goes

Let freedom ring, in my home town
Let peace, spread around
Let our own time, and good ole towns
Not let us down
Let?s all grasp our hands and shout it out loud
Let freedom ring, in my home town
Let peace, spread around

When the time comes around, we will all know
Because the land will change, and for that it shirley shows
What happened to all those times with God, peace and love?
I miss all those days, at the drive-in-shows

He?ll see you there and pull you through

Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,

I am the voice

Midnight shimmering
Why can't you just open your mind
I'm tired of listening to the screams
Which comes from inside
Try to sleep now in solitude you shall awake
Sleep as a child all I feel is he's shattering gaze
Come with me I'll protect you from the voices within
I can't I wish I was close to you I can't bear this pain

Adrian please wake me...

Screams are shattering your vains
Promises only pain shall remain
Why do you struggle your fear
My gaze shall shatter your stear
Why do you petty yourself
Why can't you reach out instead
Why won't you trust me I am your voice you shall see...

There's no sleep tonight
Flashing memories fills my mind
I fell so close to you
Can't you stay with me until eternity

Screams shall forever reach your mind
Why, cause only one day you shall be mine
Creation of souls I make them blind
Eternal, soon they shall all be mine...

Macy Gray,"Said I loved him
And forever I would stay
Took everything he had
And ran away
He reminded me
But I guess it's been a while
'Cause it's rather hazy to me now
Rather hazy to me now

Said that I'd be true
And love him till the end
Then he caught me
Messin' with his friend
He reminded me
But I guess it's been a while
'Cause it's rather hazy to me now
Rather hazy to me now

Thought my sins were washed away
Rack my brain on why you stayed
So easy to be good to him
But I don't think I've ever been

Maybe shady
Maybe cowardly
I turned and gave him
No apologies
Said, I'll see you around

Yes, it's

I could dance in the raw in the sun underneath the stars 
When I walk over to my money tree ain't nobody there 
Trying to take from me 
When they ask ""Are you truly free?"" I'd say ""Yes, truly"" 
But down here in reality everybody knows there ain't 
No such thing 
And It's clear 
It's obviously this is not the place I'm supposed to be 
On and on and on I've searched 
What I'm looking for is not here on earth 
I can't stand I can't take no more 
So I know that I gotta go 
So long everybody

Life was a heartache and now I am finally free 
Don't know where I'm headed 
Hope I see you someday soon 
So long everybody 
I have gone beyond the moon 

All I ever wanted was some love and peace and harmony 
Just to be live and shine 
When I get ready I up and fly 
And I can't remember none of the things that I want 
To forget 
It's the best - satisfaction no less 
Ask if I'm free and I'll say ""Oh yes"" 
But down here in reality everybody knows there ain't 
No such thing

 In the lane, snow is glistening

 Gone away, is the bluebird
 Here to stay, is a new bird
 He sings a love song, as we go along
 Walking in a winter wonderland

 In the meadow we can build a snowman
 And pretend that he is Parson Brown
 He'll say are you married? We'll say ""No man
 But you can do the job when you're in town""

 Later on, we'll conspire
 As we dream, by the fire
 To face unafraid, the plans that we've made

 In the meadow we can build a snowman
 And pretend that he's a circus clown
 We'll have lots of fun with Mr. Snowman
 Until the other kids come knock him down

 When your nose, gets to chilling

Of course I'm honest plus I'm keepin things all intact
I be stressed out baby, sometimes on my grind
And on my mind, is a paperchase with minimal time

She should know how it goes - I'm, still into her
I got feelings for her, I been caring for her
But really though; I mean she ought to know the deally-yo
Especially if I'm in a meeting or out shooting a video

I love her yo, but I'm just doin my job

I'm the type of man, with a serious type of plan
I'm calmer no drama, no need for gettin hyper

Supposed to help with the pain, supposed to help me maintain

I got her all up in my mix, so it means I care

This job of mine goes on and on, twenty-four hours a day
And with trust we can win, in a powerful way
When I get home, I'm gonna love her down
I'll be like Teddy, get some hot oils, and rub her down

I know she's bored, feels ignored, all by herself alone

Know I love my baby, my baby loves me
Laying in some heaven, need a little company

Searching for a love, throughout the ghetto
Young girls is thick, righteousness is narrow
I got my third, I want the sparrow
Want my peoples straight and rock sweet apparel
The mother of my child, we not together
Baby it's your back, I got forever
As the weather, talks to us
Him rocking the holy spirit walks through us
The blunted eyes of the youth search for a guide
A thug is a lost man in disguise
The rise and fall, of a nation, even when the buildings tumble
I still stand tall, I walk through the valley, wit a life preserver
Feeling at times, that I might just murder
Yo but that ain't what I was sent for
I want folks to say his life it meant more
Than ""any ca, any ba ca"" any broad
He found geto heaven in himself and god

Geto heaven
Standing in some geto heaven
Geto heaven
Standing in some geto heaven

Love, your happiness don't begin wit a man
Strong woman, why should you depend on a man
I understand you want a man that's resourceful
If he pay your bills, he feel like he bought you
Talking to a friend, about what love is
Her man didn't love her, cause he didn't love his
Hugged her from afar, said what I felt
You never find a man, till you find yourself
Time helps mistakes, you can learn from
Cause one man fucked up men you shouldn't turn from
You want a certain type of guy, gotta reach a certain point too
At the destination, a king will anoint you
Going through the storm, many bodies stay warm
That relationship died, for you to be born, you worth more
Than anything you could cop in a store
For you to grow he had to go so what you stopping him for
Not even I could ignore being alone it's hard
Find heaven in yourself and god

I know I love my baby
My baby loves me
I'm laying in some heaven, need a little company, yeah
It's twenty four seven, time to get some geto heaven
Time to get some geto heaven
Geto heaven, geto heaven
It's time to get some geto heaven
Time to get some geto heaven, oh

This music is so much bigger than me
As far as happy, yo it's like a trigger to me
Dealing with crab rappers, and groupie broads
Record execs, at times it do be hard
But to choose words, and be heard across waters
Doing something you like to support daughters
Keeping your guys who collecting court orders
Conveying messages that the ancestors brought us
Thought of things to say to become the end thing for the day
Somehow, that didn't seem the way for me to make it
Music is a gift that is sacred
I hope you didn't use it hoping you could grow to it
Whether serving or a surgeon, you goin' go through it
Can't imagine going through it, without soul music
It's like donnie hath' helped me see lonnie's path
On my behalf, let's take whole steps to imhotep
And show depth, as we make people nod
Find heaven in this music and god

Geto heaven","Geto Heaven, Pt. 2",2000
Macy Gray,"Games, changes and fears
When will they go from here
When will they stop
I believe that fate has brought us here
And we should be together babe
But we're not
I play it off, but I'm dreaming of you
And I'll keep my cool, but I'm fiendin'

[Chorus]
I try to say goodbye and I choke
Try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not here
Goodbye and I choke
I try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not here

I may appear to be free
But I'm just a prisoner of your love
And I may seem all right and smile when you leave
But my smiles are just a front
Just a front, hey
I play it off, but I'm dreaming of you
And I'll try to keep my cool, but I'm fiendin'

[Chorus]

Here is my confession
May I be your possession
Boy, I need your touch
Your love, kisses and such
With all my might I try
But this I can't deny
Deny

I play it off, but I'm dreaming of you

And I'll keep my cool, but I'm fiendin'

Macy Gray,"Got my back against the wall now
Problems that I didn't see
We got caught up in tangle
Then you tried to swing on me

How could I justified
Mistreating the love of my life
I ain't too proud to beg for better, baby
That's what I deserve

Tried to be good to you
Even stood there by you
And you ran out on me anyway
I must have been a fool

'Cause all is fair in love and war
So when your fighting someone you love, you better be careful
There no feelings, there's low blows, just in case you didn't know
'Cause in the morning it will be alright, alright, alright

Here comes him again
Streaking in my back door
Bruised heart torn from trampling
From years of my past

I'm painless and I'm angry
No time to catch feeling
I've been done wrong so I'm stone cold
And down to get even

Loves a gamble
And I ain't winning
Torn up from my past
Love don't live here no more

All is fair in love and war
So when your fighting someone you love, you better be careful
There no feelings, there's low blows, just in case you didn't know
'Cause in the morning it will be alright, alright, alright

All is fair in love and war
So when your fighting someone you love, you better be careful
There no feelings, there's low blows, just in case you didn't know
'Cause in the morning it will be alright, alright, alright

All is fair in love and war
All is fair in love and war

So why you wanna hate me?
(All is fair in love and war)
I tried to hurt you 'cause you tried to play me out
So why you so cruel to me?
(All is fair in love and war)
You took my heart and you tried to play me soft?

You took my heart and stoned it
(All is fair in love and war)
I didn't want you take and tried to lead you on
All I was, was good to you
(All is fair in love and war)
I didn't want you take and tried to lead you on

So why you wanna hurt me?
(All is fair in love and war)
I tried to hurt you 'cause you tried to play me out
Why you run around on me?
(All is fair in love and war)
You took my heart and you tried to play it soft

How long can this last?
(All is fair in love and war)
I didn't want you take and tried to lead you on
You took the best of me
(All is fair in love and war)
I took the best of you

ain't too many more days, I'm gonna be treated this way
(In love and war)
And it ain't too many more lies, I'm gonna listen to my baby
(In love and war)

If you listen to me, things will go a little bit better
(In love and war)
Why would I listen to you?
Willing to give you a chance yes I am

For all the leaders- Why don't you listen and learn
To love this happiness, once we're strong
But to (society) even that's (turned wrong) Why!
Are we dumb-dummie and disrespect mommie and why!
She put you on earth and loved you since birth and you

The world is yours
 ""Hey young world""

""Young world, young world""

""Young world, young world""
Young world, young wo-ah-ah-rld

The world is a brainwashed kid (kid...) run wild
Young little girls, already have a child
Bad company and now you've been framed (been framed)
Parents are hurtin', so hurted and ashamedp, why!
Hey little kids don't follow these adults, why!
Don't be a fool, like those who ditch school, it's yours

Hear that, hear that, accomplish things
You'll see your under, and the trouble life brings
To my teens, and all my youth
Get on the limited and hold rocks too
Listen, be strong and scream Whoopie-woo!
Go for yours 'cause dreams come true
You'll make your mommy so proud of you to and
This is the message at the ruler Rick's school

Elders seen our wise ones grown
Interest in what the kid learned 'bout
Seen how the old spring turned out
""Whaa-aa-aa-aaahh"" Mm-mm-mm
Knowin' you can know safeguard self
Put upon an exciting path
You'll see a mans pride they'll have

[Chorus]

Don't discipline, lose soundly
Kids that we have lose boundaries
Grow into what's called curserates
Like in-de-pen-dence, words case
imprisonment death, therefore
Not what we brought kids here for
Morales and values of sort
Should be the first thing in store

Believe it or not, God still shines on you
He guides you and, he watched you as you grew
Stay out of trouble, when it comes in sight
'Cause a man never loses a fight in God's sight!

Welcome this is my life,
And it's heavy like lead,
All my defenses down,
All my lies are shed,
Things you don't see when I'm, 
Naked in your bed,
Am I still beautiful, to you? Shed

Did you know that I'm from a planet coloring?
Sometimes at night cartoon figures dance in my head,
For breakfast I like green eggs and stew,
And deep inside I'm deep in love with you.

[Chorus]

I have five or six, orange leather coats,
And when it snows I like to go outside and, row row my boat
On Saturdays I lick lollipops and watch my boo,
And deep inside I'm deep in love with you
And deep inside I'm deep in love, with you.

This track here may cause concern
For all ring leaders
Why don't you listen and learn
Love peace happiness once was strong
But due to society
Even that's turned wrong

Why?
Don't be a dumb dummy
And disrespect mommy
Why?
She put you on earth
And loved you since birth
And you

Reward is a brainwashed kid gone wild
Young little girls already have a child
Bad company and now you've been framed
Parents are hurting so hurt and ashamed
Why?
Hell lil' kids don't follow these dopes
Why?
Don't be a fool like those who ditch school
It's yours

Hey young world
The world is yours
Hey young world
The world is yours

Get ahead
And accomplish things
You'll see the wonder and the joy life brings
Don't admire thieves they don't admire you
Their times are limited
And hardrocks too
Listen be strong
And scream
Woopie doo
Go for yours
Cause dreams come true
You'll make your mommy so proud of you too
And this is a message that the ruler rick threw

Why?
(slick rick)
Elders see our wise ones grow
Interest in what their kid learned 'bout
Seen how the offspring turned out
Knowing you can now safeguard self
Put upon an exciting path
You see immense pride they'll have

Hey young world
The world is yours
Hey young world
The world is yours
Young world young world

Don't discipline rule soundly
Kids that we have lose boundaries
Grow into what's called curse race lack independence
Worst case imprisonment death near for
Not what we brought kids here for
Morals and values of sorts should be the first thing installed

Believe it or not
God still shines on you
He guides you
And he watched you as you grew
Stay out of trouble

Cause a man never loses a fight in god's sight",Hey Young World Part 2,2001

In their rendition of 'The Cell Block Tango'

Pop! Six! Squish! Uh uh, Cicero, Lipschitz!
Pop! Six! Squish! Uh uh, Cicero, Lipschitz!
Pop! Six! Squish! Uh uh, Cicero, Lipschitz!

He had it coming, he had it coming
He only had himself to blame
If you'd have been there, if you'd have seen it
I betcha you would have done the same

Pop! Six! Squish! Uh Uh, Cicero, Lipschitz!

You know how people have these little habits
That get you down like Ernie
Ernie like to chew gum, no, not chew, Pop

Like, I come home this one day and there's Ernie
Layin' on the couch chewin', no, not chewin', poppin'
So, I said to him, I said
""Ernie, you pop that gum one more time"" and he did

So I took the shotgun off the wall
And I fired two warning shots into his head

He had it coming, he had it coming
He only had himself to blame

I met Ezekiel Young from Salt Lake city about two years ago
And he told me he was single and we hit it off right away
So, we started living together

He'd go to work, he'd come home, I'd fix him a drink, we'd have dinner.
Then I found out, single, my ass
Not only was he married, well, he had six wives
One of those Mormons, you know

So that night, when he came home
I fixed him his drink as usual
You know, some guys just can't hold their arsenic

He had it coming, he had it coming
He took a flower in its prime
And then he used it and he abused it
It was a murder but not a crime

Now, I'm standing in the kitchen
Carvin' up the chicken for dinner
And in storms my husband Wilbrin in a jealous rage
""You been screwin' the milkman""

He says and he kept sayin'
""You been screwin the milkman""
Then he ran into my knife
He ran into my knife ten times

If you'd have been there, if you'd have seen it
I betcha you would have done the same

Mit kersek, en itt? Azt mondjok, hogy a hires
Lakem lefogta a ferjemet en meg lecsaptam a fejet
De nem igaz, en artatlan vagyok
Nem tudom mert mondja Uncle Sam hogy en tettem
Probaltam a rendorsegen megmayarazni de nem ertettek meg

But did you do it?
Uh uh, not guilty

My sister, Veronica and I had this double act
And my husband, Charlie traveled around with us
With the last number in our act
We did 20 acrobatic tricks in our world

One two three four five, splits, spread eagles
Flip flops, back flips, one right after the other
Well, this one night we were in Cicero

The three of us, we were in this hotel room
Boozin' and havin' a few laughs and we ran out of ice
So I went out to get some

I come back, open the door
There's Veronica and Charlie
Doing number seventeen, the spread eagle

Well, I was in such a state of shock, I completely blacked out
I can't remember a thing, it wasn't until later
When I was washing the blood off my hands
I even knew they were dead

They had it coming, they had it coming
They had it coming all along
I didn't do it, in spite if I'd done it
How could you tell me that I was wrong?

I loved Alvin Lipschitz, he was a real artistic guy, sensitive, a painter
But he was always trying to find himself
He go out every night looking for himself
And on the way, he found Ruth, Gladys, Rosemary and Irving

I guess you can say we broke up because of artistic differences
He saw himself as alive and I saw him dead

The dirty bum, bum, bum, bum, bum
The dirty bum, bum, bum, bum, bum

They had it comin', they had it comin'
They had it comin' all along
'Cause if they used us and they abused us
How could they tell us that we were wrong?

He had it coming, he had it coming
He only had himself to blame
If you'd have been there, if you'd have seen it
I betcha you would have done the same

With a missy who was ready to play
Was it me she was foolin'?
'Cause she knew what she was doin'
Told me how to walk this way
She told me to

Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, talk this way
Just give me a kiss

Intoxicated and I'm faded, by your honey
Why, we finally made it, got to lovin'
Money, seeds and shine
They want to hate it, try to break it
But it's yours and mine
Nothing can change it, finally made it, so divine

[Raekwon]
Yo, I sat around the illest villains
Campaignin' while we all G off
Automatic mayors, now we ain't playin'
Wolves start scheemin', violate me in the rain
Get more respect, rob Marvin Gaye on 'em
Gold, black, beige on 'em, heavy gauge
Gettin' blazed, all that money, but he ain't even shaved
This a new flavor, bigger vets, bigger begets
Bigger papes, god damn it, nigga got saved
Three or more, two thousand four Blazers
Lookin' good, it's all hood, just analyze amazed
Peace, let's mozy and swaze', y'all
Then count real bank and thank 'em, hit me on the page, what

[Method Man]
Yo, I was born on the same day as Dr. Seuss
Plenty of friends, henny and gin, who got the juice?
Let's get drunk, in this motherfucker, let's get pumped
I need that funk, like I ain't took a bath in a month
You can find me where the thugs be at, club be at
A fact, I love women, 'cause they love me back
The name's Johnny, they used to call me sucker for love
But now I'm grimey, cops searchin' motherfuckers for drugs
Give me that buzz, that calm a nigga, dimes and doves
At four twenty, when niggaz knew what time it was
A shot of Remy, in my system, I'm buzzed
Then baby, I ain't just a little war from unplugged
Haha, you know I, crack myself up, sometimes with no excuses
Like every nigga that done time, I didn't do it
Meth the Magnificent, not Jeff
I see the game done gone imputent, soft and suspect

[Chorus]

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Yo, silence on Smith with six shots, lick shots
Leave ya head like a Shaolin monk with six dots
Hit a gush, twistin' a sweet switcher
In search for Bobby the Digital, bitch, not Bobby Fisher
Head full, with a Grey Goose and Redbull
I came for, a beer, weed, plus a bed full
Of dimepiece, model type bitches, who mind they business
Blow my dick, like birthday cake wishes
My warrior's scornful, hard to respond to
Dirt McGirt, be sailin' boat and in Honolulu
Brooklyn Zu, wild like Chaka Zulu
Brooklyn Zu, shots will go right through you
Touch me in Cali, or the streets of Mauwi
In the two thousand six pitch black Audi
Drivin' by bitches, I'm like howdy
Doody, to you some beauty bitches crowd me

I walk in and she's countin' her cash 
Got so much cash her office looks like a green pasture 
I said, ""give him the little bit of money you owe him"" 
She said"" get back bitch I ain't givin' you shit"" 
I said, ""you ole bag, maybe you ain't heard but them are 
Fightin words""
 
[Chorus]

And I don't feel bad about it 
See baby there was this struggle 
And I don't feel bad about it 
As a result of our struggle 
And I don't feel bad about it 
But the good thing is 
And I don't feel bad about it 
We don't have to struggle no more 

With a suitcase full of money 
We flew to a Jamaican paradise 
One thing I've learned through all of this is 
Having money sure is nice 
Me and my baby got married 

He's working hard to make his dreams came true 
As far as regrets I don't have any 
Would You?

Gone crazy but I guess it don't matter since the work is gonna
End. Gonna make a change at least Ill try to will they notice
When I do? And if I don't make it will you still be my friend?
So baby tell me when Ill see you again it'll all be better.

All of my troubles they go away when you're on top of me loving
Me down, making sounds and its so good I am screaming.

Make you want to throw your hands and holler, crying cause I
Miss my father when will we get out the mess were in? all I
Want to do is reach the sky don't want to have to die to do that
Where on earth is my heaven? So baby tell me when Ill see you
Again it'll all be better.

All of my troubles they go away when you're on top of me loving
Me down, making sounds and its so good I am screaming.

In each others arms were safe. Why don't we just stay that
Way? making love and loving all the time.

Quite the way we planned, 
Got your bags at the door 
And now you're leaving me again. 
I play cool like I don't care, 
That's just the way I am; 
But inside I wish I had the nuts 
To ask you for another chance. 
All I do is wish for you now 
That you are gone, time should heal, 
Pain should fade and I should move on

But it still hurts, still burns. 
When it comes to love I got a lot to learn 
Ain't comin' back like I want you to
Baby there's no gettin' over you 
Cause it still hurts, it still burns

I smile when I look back 
On the way we were before, 
Remember the life I had in love 
When I was your girl. 
Nowhere was as lovely 
As our own little world, 
I can't believe I messed up, 
I can't believe I'm not your girl. 

Cause all I do is dream of you now 
That you are gone, 
But time should heal and pain should fade 
And I should move on

But it still hurts, still burns. 
When it comes to love I got a lot to learn 
Ain't comin' back like I want you to,
Baby there's no gettin' over you 
Cause it still hurts, it still burns

I try to fight away this hold you have on me, 
Baby I kick, I scream, 
Baby I've tried everything. 
But I'm hopeless ya see, 
Stuck on a love that used to be, 
Chasing a dream that maybe 
Baby you would come back to me..

That you make me smile

Under covers staying dry and warm

You tuck me in just like a child now

I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth

While the sun gently sweeps in the sea

Scorpion tail snaps, constrictor strangles 
S+M rocks, Dilated works the angles

Yo I came here to change the whole sound of art
And let em know it all comes down to heart 
The mission now is rip the whole town apart 
Wit my colleagues, my teammates, my counter parts

Galvanize steel grade, I'd say we're quite well made 
I trust you're rush into an open blade of rust 
Hands to ribbons, is in a beatbox of must 
Crimson wordplay Prevail, the narrator from the doorway 
My partners in this, have gotta be clearly obvious 
Known for superior form of smoke inhalation 
From spoken incineration 
Omens of Damien reignin in present New Haven 
Now ain't that amazing? 

[Evidence] 

Yo I'm inspired and wired 
That time will be attractive 
Not tired I've fired volcanoes still are active
Causin drama or terror, it's fabulous 
I'll bounce to the arctic with a backpack full of travelers Checks to burn, stay warm for the brain storm 
'cause in my snow storm 
I freeze if I don't sleep below the ice for my blanket 
Thank earth for it's hidden treasures
And now I'm takin drastic measures

[Madchild] 

Indulge in this intrusion 
Underworld defender 
Horrendous snowball of absolute insaneness (feel me) 
Riskin freedom to be famous 
When nothin remains except passion and pain 
No slashin the vein, to bleed and drown in a bath 
Fall down and I laugh, get up wipe myself off 
and walk down a new path I'm INTACT! 
You can't handle the impact 
Insync, blazing wit killer instinct

[Iriscience] 

I excel, they all fell 
New details, Madchild Prevail
I remove the veil, manifest God self 
As the life-giving son, Iriscience brings twelve 
Like Buckingham Palace to British Columbia 
Three states under ya, I deal wit District of Columbia Understand the numbers and the system that you're under And why them belly full but the people feelin hunger

Mad Child,"[Prevail]
My comparative dissention
From high as an intense discription
Of why the valkyrie fly, calculate
The circumference of the sky for future reference
Measure it all from bird's eye to add some fuel to my furnace
To those who scratch the surface and lace signs of plotonus
Expected to strown trajectory of David's sling to Goliath
Nor abundance of nouses accommodate my body weight
Circle 1-9-7-5 with
Instruments of vine and I'll
Dine the road of chrisis if it
Crosses over to the land of radiogiants 
Founded by po-pyus and pontious pilots
I make ?garbious? my habit to stab it until it's had it
Encourage the cutting of Marionette by bayonette
To escape the twin maker's cabinet
I was born in between 11:59 and 12 which 12 falls into thirteen
Prepare the barricades for the running of the ramping
While some try to change or exist to its wash cloth soaked in chlorine

[Madchild]
Much too dangerous
Meet the perfect stranger
I'm the extreme case of fire and anger
The misguided angel with deep routed fears
My face shows the years of blood sweating tears
Pay attention, this gypsy that deeply senses
Evil spirits lurking behind picket fences
Embarking darker images and skeletal remains
Cold hearted soldier with ice in his veins
I'm twice as insane
My advice is refrain
From confrontation, total annihilation
Serenating my princess, gut renching terror
See much clearer on my side of the mirror.....
Progressing modestly, moderately dichotomy
Manslaughter sporadically, automatically adequate
Gang up on myself, by myself, but keep me out of it
Undoubtedly a lunatic, Battle Axe exclusive
I'm utterly repulsive and self abusive
Offerings from the gifted I'm swiftly elusive
Making fun of myself I'm quadrofrenic mentally
Not laughing at me I'm laughing with me accidentally
Trip on Swollen Members, keep it on if it suits ya 
Silver surfing and ride the wave of the future",Strength,1999
Mad Child,"Slightly schizophrenic borderline psychotic 
Sensational recreational narcotics 
I thought I lost it but I found it 
Temptation marches along till I'm surrounded 
Inspired by fire the sensual illusion
Caught between the crossfire anger and confusion
Howl at the moon black blanket that's starlit 
I'm rarely romantic plowing through tramps 
And harlots madchild prevails tails of the unwanted 
Not to be taken for granted 
My past has come back and haunted for real 
I've all ready danced with death. a dozen black roses 
I pose with babies breath 
Be afraid a place where magic is made 
I'll rain on your parade with silver razor blades 
I'm creepin' over the fence crawlin' through your back yard 
My mind states intense 
Savage penetration on the rocks with a twist 
Now scream and shake your fists
Cause dreams are made of this

For real the opposite transmit telepathic 
Roamin' the flats with automatics and back packs 
Doin' jacks for Big Macs, accumulatin' stacks to make G's 
Nigga please, you artificial 

You dropped somethin', it's your heart 
An' it's still pumpin', pumpin' you from this existence 
It seems to be absolutely mandatory, 'cause you be manipulatin' skin 
But no way, because you fake I can trace out your image 
Even though you don't cast one, I smell a rat, I'm smellin' that 
Stay back at least 150 inches, 
You brew tea? an I know you know I can sense it 
With the nostrils innocently mixed with 6 hostile stenches 
Henceforth the elbow swings dinging, we bring whip to bleed scalps 
Swingin' sleep out your mouth 
How long you been hibernatin'? Too long! 
You're abiding and aiding a felon, to switch your melon 
Droppin' grammar like a judges hammer 
I feel you mark, feel me feel your chart 
You gotta be real an you gotta to have heart 
You gotta to be real an you gots to have heart 

Stir the blur, nuts and bolts whirl 
Stored in electric ports, 4 strong boxes of 10 floors 
Shift the weight towards the door, in hopes of escape 
When hands on cord, the blazing roof Prev creates 
Sound break, concord, eye of the condor 
Hand skills of a saboteur, your in for 
A war that pours coarse of molten into cords 
Strung by the young ones, put me on tour 
No folk lore horsemen for poison, pour in skin pores 

Soft rhymers, metamorphize their cartoon characters 
Grafted from Africa, in this game you got no stature 
Not even a factor in this 
Whole shit makes me yawn 
Snatch your heart out your chest like a '96 ghetto spawn
Antonym of urban, too feminine for this cut-throat mentality 
Have ? thoughts in my area, you get snatched out your Suburban 
Fallacy with no antidote, in this ? your age get broke 
Runnin' from gun smoke, ballin' never rumin' 
Silver spoons crumbin' from flavor 
Soon there will be no overseer to save ya 
When I delve, tell your podiatrist it's a size 12 
National ? Soldiers, leakin' a swine 
A snake with no spine, I'll see you, I peeped you 
You'll see blue, the fake,
A quick death is your fate 
Now, I got shit to do",Valentine's Day Massacre,1999
Mad Child,"Yo the rhyme excursions touch minds like brain surgeons 
Feel the lyric tear gas even on clean versions 
No profanic goddammit hard like granite to the utmost 
I'm butter on rye, always high but play the low post 
I stretch to go the distance yo my lungs are mad elastic 
I'm dope on plastic like Flex, and always keep it, classic
Expressions in the facial, I'm on rachel from Caribbean rhythms 
I hit 'em wit' a battered flow pattern then circle Saturn twice
I'm nice on ice The line slice your dome and separate rhymes from poems
My life, ain't tryin to see no Grammy or Oscar 
Best believe the styles will rub off like pastas
On people, yo check Dilated, Evidence 
The influential rock rhymes in sequential format 
You see the doormat if you acting dis-accordingly 
Something to the effect of Fat Boys in Disorderly's

I'll take you from He-Man to She-Ra 
Battle Cat to Cringer 
Medieval messenger, west coast avenger 
Take you to the street, battle me that's a fuckin' sin 
Go one round wit Madchild, you'll be suckin' wind 
Snappin' handcuffs just from deep concentration 
Then I broke out the bus, the mental hospital patient
On the weekend pass, but I still come sick 
Psychopathic, you're dealin' with a deranged lunatic 
Soon to kick ya teeth in and then go berserk 
Even Van Gogh looked at me, 
And said ""You're one piece of work"" 
So I said ""Lend me an ear"" 'cause I'm the state of the art 
First I'll feast on your brain and rip your body apart 
There's a part of your heart stuck in between my fangs 
Wrap a rope 'round your neck and you still couldn't hang 
'cause you're way off track you need realignment 
Murdering masterpieces in solitary confinement

I keep your backside open like the English Channel 
I rock the sure shot, I keep it hot like flannel 
I'll survey your panel, put my foot up in your anal 
You think it can't happen, kid 'cause I'm rappin'
Ain't no gun clappin', cut the jaw-jackin '
Let the joints get shot and see who wear this knot 
Then kick off your shoes jump off my jock
And check the new style Whitey Ford's prone to rock 
'cause once upon a time, not long ago
Before hip hop was made for the radio 
An MC show had to cold rock the masses 
Used to wear a Kangol wit the clear Gazel glasses 
So bang bang boogey, up jump the party 
Someone clapped off, and scattered everybody 
Drunk off Bacardi, high off the trauma 
It's death from above, the livest dive bomber 
In the squadron
I break formation 
I get New York love like my name's King Sun 
I T La Rock Bells till they break the dawn 
Steady puffin L's, I fight hell like Spawn 
My moves are animated, my crew's reinstated 
While you cats suspensions are up in my dimensions 
We can ease tensions or we can get rowdy 
So I'm a keep it on the love and do my duty like Howdie 

Direct your short term plan, rigidalize rhyme boards wit the hoards
I'm Satan dynasty killer reveal the cause wit the sling on down 
Venom spit regurgitate death scripts I sound 
Cylinder never python, Prevail Madchild 
Physical justice can't rush this for now 
Move faker the game time set back so don't sweat that 
God don't test that, too much infinite to get at 
Face the fields Swollen Members got the iller drills 
And if you wit the rhyme steel 
Bust the revealings in my feelings of these dealings 
I went to represent shield 
I build three phases of death,
The illusion is the sweat that you reflect 
When you feel the veil Divine Styles circum navigate nine circles of hell 
You keep on you don't stop 'cause a nigga never stay still 
Whatta whattta whatta whatta whattta what I'm sayin is-is that 
You-you ain't ready for that chill",Bottle Rocket,1999
Mad Child,"Rappers talk like felons but they're all fake villains
Madchild 'bout to erupt like Mount St Helens
I don't give a fuck if I hurt your feelings
Get your helmet cracked, I'm a silverback gorilla
Yeah! This is quantum physics
""Little Monster"" will stomp on you daunted midgets
I've lived a life full of wrong decisions
I got condoms for conjugal visits
with blonde haired midgets, monsters, mongrels and wizards
This is on-going, I'm throwing bombs in a blizzard
This is calculated long division
I got a strong condition, my funds are insufficient
It was a really fuckin' long intermission
Now I'm goin' all out, and I ain't askin for permission
While I gather up my arsenal, you couldn't wrap a parcel
You're a harsh farce marshmallow with a asshole
I don't wear bar clothes, I'm not gettin' a bar code
tatted on my arm bro, you couldn't hit a barn door
My aim's perfect, it ain't worth it
Perfectly wired circuitry, hurt you like I'm Hercules
Then paint my face 'cause inside I'm a dark circus freak
Lurkin' through the forest with a black axe handle
Wax candles, droppin' acid drinkin Jack Daniels
A masked vandal, I'm a victim of a bad scandal
The Mad's Rambo, commando in a black Lambo'
Used to gamble back when my head was scrambled
Now I'm Foghorn Leghorn eatin a hambone
Playin in a jamboree with a tambourine eatin' a tangerine
A backpack with a change of clothes and couple cans of beans
Wait I sounded like Yelawolf there, I wonder if he'd care
He seems like a pretty good guy, he probably won't mind
So back to bein' Madchild, opposite of fragile
People think I ought to rat style, fuck Madchild",Fuck Madchild,2012
Mad Child,"I spit ferocious fireballs, the kids are all excited
I pour petroleum on your linoleum and light it
On a podium, I'm causing pandemonium
Sodium and nitrate, second greatest rapper in the white race
Might've been the spider venom, might've been the snake bite
Fuck with me and find out what a metal pipe will taste like
I'm explosive like a molotov cocktail
Lyrics get around the kids quick like fuckin' hotmail
Involuntarily, solitary confinement
I've no one to confide in, quiet in my environment
Mentally, I'm way off balance and off kilter
Brains, we ought to wack, that's why I rap without a filter
Perverted matador, I tackle bulls and try to mount 'em
So many personalities, don't bother trying to count 'em
My life is a crazy rollercoaster, call me magic mountain
I'm throwing boulders, they're exploding, mouth's a fuckin' fountain

I'm mental
That's just the way that it goes, dog
Canadian but you could keep the rain and the snowballs
I love palm trees, sitting in the sunshine
Learning quick, my rhymes, they are ridiculously sublime
Stupid shit, but the way that I combine
My wordplay, smartest rapper out with a dumb mind
Sometimes I kind of miss the clouds and the rain
'Cause that's what helped me get the blues, madchild is proudly insane

I went from backpack, to snapbacks, to lab rats on acid
Spit anthrax, the band's back, this man's raps are massive
Completely gone bananas, whipping up within bonanza
Short like Dan Devito, still the boss like Tony Danza
Now stick your damn hands up, this here is a robbery
Hobblin' like a goblin and my brain is a little wobbly
I'm probably the height of a hobbit that's hobnobbin' in Oz
With a couple wonderful wizards, I've got problems
The plot thickens, I'm stuck up in the mud again
Utterly disgusting when I'm muttering my foot up in your anal hole
It's unexplainable 'cause I'm the awesomest
Blossom from a possum, stick my cock down your esophagus
Narcissist, I'm also an arsonist from an orphanage
Cock is way too big for my body, it's unproportionate
Morph into a profitable author, mad's a novelist
Of course I'm still a mess and I'm depressed, it's probably obvious

I'm fuckin' mental
That's just the way that it goes, dog
Canadian but you could keep the rain and the snowballs
I love palm trees, sitting in the sunshine
Learning quick, my rhymes, they are ridiculously sublime
Stupid shit, but the way that I combine
My wordplay, smartest rapper out with a dumb mind
Sometimes I kind of miss the clouds and the rain
'Cause that's what helps me get the blues, madchild is proudly insane

I lost my mind a long time ago
Hot with the rhyming though
Fall in line like dominos
Light it up, vamanos
My flow is all kind of dope
Something like a line of coke
Streets is cold, go and grab my heater, that's my kind of coat
Rain, hail, sleet, or snow
Shit you never know but to each his own
Pops back from prison, guess the preach is on
Watch your tone, Battleaxe Warriors are not alone
Smoke a zone, to the dome
I can't leave this life alone
Murder on this microphone
Living in a Cali daze
Get familiar, this serial killer is in his final phase
And my path ain't paved, every brick is laid
Fuck it, I'm paid
Light a j and just fade away
Fuck what they say, I ain't listening
Son, I'm like a christening
Keep it rolling like Michelin
You don't know shit about positions that I've been up in
Then again, grind for the benefit
You want to see the end of it

I'm fuckin' mental
That's just the way that it goes, dog

You're just a heartache in disguise
Won't you keep my heart from breaking
If it's only for a very short time

Playing with the Queen of Hearts
Knowing it ain't really smart
The Joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do anything for you

Laying out another lie
Thinking 'bout a life of crime
'Cause that's what I'll have to do
To keep me away from you

Honey, you know it makes you mad
Why is everybody telling everybody what you have done?
Baby, I know it makes you sad
But when they're handing out the heartaches
You know you got to have you some

To keep me away from you

Lovers, I know you've had a few
But hide your heart beneath the covers
And tell 'em they're the only one
And others, they know just what I'm going through
And it's a-hard to be a lover when you say you're only in it for fun

Everyone must stand alone 
I hear you call my name 
And it feels like home 

[Chorus]
When you call my name 
Its Like a little prayer 
I'm down on my knees 
I want to take you there 
In the midnight hour 
I can feel your power 
Just like a prayer 
You know Ill take you there 
 
I hear your voice 
It's like an angel sighing 
I have no choice 
I hear your voice 
It feels like flying 
I close my eyes 
Oh God I think I'm falling 
Out of the sky 
I close my eyes 
Heaven help me! 
 
[Chorus]
 
Like a child 
You whisper softly to me 
You're in control 
Just like a child 
Now I'm dancing 
Its like a dream 
No end and no beginning 
You're hear with me 
Its like a dream 
Let the choir sing 
 
[Chorus: x2]
 
Oh [x4]
 
Life is a mystery 
Everyone must stand alone 
I hear you call my name 
And it feels like... Home 
 
Just like a prayer 
Your voice can take me there 
Just like it used to be 
You are a mystery 
Just like a dream 
You are not what you seem 
Just like a prayer 
No choice, your voice can take me there

[Featuring Smif-N-Wessun] 
Verse One: Steele 
Here we go, break of day, with a mad live session 
Down in Bucktown it's Black Moon, and Smif-N-Wessun 
Pick up the pace 'cause we're right behind ya black 
The punk got X-amount of shots, take one to your back 
BOO-YAA-KAA!!! Mr. Ripper did the shooting 
Cops heard the shots, shit's hot 'cause they're pursuing 
But it's my stomping groung where herds get blown down 
Think I'm gettin caught by beasts youse a damn clown 
Check the drums of death as I break what's left 
of your face, 'cause you're sellin out the rap race 
Your family cried as your body lies in it's casket 
I keep a black Smith-and-Wessun in my polo jacket 
Sixteen shots, for all you hardrocks 
And if your bitch is a dime she can get the cock 
Straight up and down, we two terrible toughies 
The Vickster hit your pockets then I made your eyes puffy 
What pussy? Better drop your mic and get to steppin 
Before you're face to face with a black Smith-and-Wessun 
Chorus: repeat 4X 
Load the clip, bust lead to the head 
The nappy head dread, Buckshot and Baldhead 
Verse Two: Buckshot 
Real niggaz represent and don't die 
Never dead like I said all we fuckin do is multiply 
I puff a mad bag of buddha 
Niggaz be like ""Yo who the shorty?"" 
I'm bustin niggaz with my six-shooter 
I get so much pussy my dick be in stitches 
Red-boned or even fucked-up black Zulu bitches 
What? This lil nigga is a mad stalker 
Brooklyn, New York will grab the leash around your neck and then I 
walk ya 
If youse a bigger nigga bigger niggaz get bucked 
'cause I'm the Buck and I don't give a fuck my dick you can suck 
Buck is a killer, thrill a nigga like Manilla 
I'm small but strong like that fucking gorilla 
A crazy-ass nigga puttin Brooklyn on the map 
I never gave a fuck, I never give a fuck, 'cause I'm all that 
I take no shit see, givin the Buck fifty 
I even blew your bitch 'cause your man tried to stick me 
Chorus 
Verse Three: Tek 
Ahh shit, a personality split 
And I'm bout to flip with my nigga pull the trigger let the Glock spit 
A little bad-ass shorty with no remorse 
I kill forties and quarts remains on stage so who the boss? 
Another boom blew up the scene 
throughout the planet, get green, now I got sticky mean with my tag 
team 
G want a clip thinkin I'm takin this the underground moves 
There ain't no more fakin if you're fakin I'm bakin it 
Straight up and down, nuff respect to Bucktown 
Home of the chrome, where I roam, not givin a FUCK now 
Damn, just when you thought it was safe 
to come out, with a rhyme, I got the nine to your face 
Boom, hooked up with Black Moon, now it's on for real 
so I pack more steel lookin for the kill 
Hope you're not the picture on my scope, 'cause the dread'll 
pump lead, from the black Smith-and-Wessun, nuff said 
Chorus 

",Black Smif-N-Wessun,
Mad Lion,"Sittin' on the toilet, shittin', puffin the dough
Strobe light affect, everything's movin' slow
Slip into a deep zone, the sound let the phone bring me home
Stagger to my feet, emotion toward the walk talk
(Aiyo Ripper what up nigga, check out this proposition
There's money to bait and I'm in the mood to go fishing)
Whatever nigga, give me time to wash my ass
My habit at your norm' day, fiendin' for the cash
(Do what you gotta do, 'cause I'm on my way in the car
'cause when I get there, yo we outie like Tamar) Right right easy
(Now I'm off to the south to get more info on this dough I heard about
Gotta make sure everything secure
Can't let me and my man let these grants slip past our hands
The man's out heavy today
I hope they don't try to get in the way of our pay)
Damn, I'm ready, high noon, the man's out
Gotta take a quick shower, get dressed and bounce
Grabbed a fatigue, strapped out the generals
Proper attire for all criminals
Blazed up the clip, loads up the 4/5th
If a boy riff, leave a body their stiff
Who dem man there gon' rap on my door
Disturb me at work, on the low dub four (Yo it's me)
Who that (ST, what up) Aight hold up son, let me put it back on safety
(Aiyo kid it smells like fresh grown cess, lets
Twist up some trees before we jet)
True, you know we keep a fat pack of sense
Even though you know it make our pockets go empty
(But no less about to starved into free men
So whenever we finish we gon' bag up this spinach)
Easier said than done, peep the 4-1-1
The dred around the corner, just try to blast Ruck and Dunn
(I knew it, bad vibes flowin' like fluid
Forget about the dough, let's do it
I see you already strapped pa, so I'll meet you
Outside, 'cause my gats back in the car
How far must one go
Before he throw his whole entire life right out the window)

And a dead boy, and I don't even know
(Aiyo he looks like the dred, that hooked us up on the low)
What you say fly?
(Thinkin' out loud, just caught me in the zone
I'll tell you all about it on the way home)
Whatever, I'mma send this nigga to his essence
Fuckin' wit' the family, know he gotta learn a lesson
And you know he ain't yardy right
Some boy gon get dead tonight
As we strap on the gloves, feel the buzz from cannabis
Niggas bout to get scandalous

Gotta be gon' the double, I think I seen them all tumble
But on the left there's trouble
Undercover had to spill staked out
Watchin' the whole thing go down, yo it's time to brake out
The 4/5th as I shift and drive
'cause every mind right here might not leave alive

Son why you stallin'? Hop on the ballin'
Get us outta here before we be the next fallin'
Right now, this whole shit is bug, we the thugs
Yet the beast comin' up showin' niggas love
Took our burners, gave us dap, let us bounce
Now it's back to the dog house, to smoke the next ounce

Who could believe them beats left us alone
And took the chrome that's in one of our own back home
And not only that kid, check
How money that we just did, was that connect
For the cash, them pigs must of had dips for the stash
That ain't that some shit for ya ass

Troops say, ya never liked this pretty ass anyway
But that shit wit the pigs CO-made my day
Gave me a whole new outlook on the beast
Even watched out for the ones so called the beast
But anyway, you know we high right now
Doin' it like this, the original crook style",Hellucination,
Mad Lion,"""One two, testing one two
 Alright party people in the place to be
 The party has already started
 An-an-an-and it's about to il-il-il-ill *echoes*""

Let me introduce you to another type of rapper MC
where glamour and glitter don't matter gently
I'm tired of the Chattanooga empty
Classical like a German luger
Deep like a tune for scuba diving who am I the hyper
Like I said before my radar's going BIBBIT BIBBIT
The microphone I grip-it grip-it, lyric lyric I live it
Hear it my spirit is where it should be
Don't push me if you pussy, HUH
I spot em, it seems you want to ride the dillz
I got em, KRS got skills in the place
I waste megahertz of bass bottom, chill
As I rock em and get ill, I build the perfect spot to kill
Verbal excitement will lead to your indictment
Whether or not you like it, still, number one I hype it
Your album, rewrite it

        How many MC's, wannabemceez
        Never be MC's, cause they can't MC
        How many MC's, wannabemceez
        Never be MC's, cause they can't MC

Triplet syllables for minimal criminals
Lyrical riddles that got hard flavors in the middle
Sit back and chittle as I stand and still rebuild on skills
The admission of serial lyrics, calculated to weaken the spirit
will be diverted by this lyric when you hear it
Ricochet any style any day
Any which way and you'll Cherish the Day like Sade
The advanced oratorical techniques I speak
Keep the heat at full peak!  My grammar
with stamina, grabs a rapper like the fresh catch of the day
and crack the back of that DJ
I'm strappin and attackin a pack
And whatever happens after that just happens, FACT
Flamboyant and flashy is one point in time when you're not ashy
Focus on the syllable formats and the cash G
G for guard your grill, I'm hard to kill
Odd but ill, a job to fill is to refill on skills
We built and killed style and skill
while poetically recriminate you like a child I will
get ill, and switch to earn
Cause I prefer to slur but not blur
Blurring you're stirring up trouble surely you don't need it
be seated I'm undefeated dem not see it
Observe me then beat it

        How many MC's, wannabemceez
        Never be MC's, cause they can't MC
        How many MC's, wannabemceez
        Never be MC's, cause they can't MC

Let's get back to the point quickly, get with me
The voice from New York City is too witty
I come from a era of ?OJ cars?, Latin Quarter
fake Gucci and fake Fendi, you can't send me
Nowhere, that I ain't been to
You can't tell me nuttin that I ain't been through
Disrespect the teacher I gots to get you
                        *cause they can't MC*
But what you really sayin
You sound like a bitch-ass rapper when he's saying
""Yo Kris you hit too hard"" stop playing!
Switching and swaying
Day in and day out, your styles are played out, see you way out
Before you're laid out, your bright lights start to fade out
The last thing you heard is ""Who let the K out?""
?No great area?
Everything is black and white we took the gray out it's scarier
Either you're winnin or losin, spinnin the rules of conscience
But lyrically there ain't no stoppin
I'm droppin a lot in your noggin
Cause I know that you're lyrically starvin
Carbon, your name, battle battle
Everybody wants to battle but you BAB-BLE
Who knows ya, battlin me, is the only way that you can gain exposure
I feel for ya soldier
I hate to say it but I told ya so
You know that I know the ancient flow KRS-One
is the holder of a boulder yo, money folder yo
You want a fresh style let me show you slow
your blow, I'm not your foe
Battling me?  No no no no no no NO!

        How many MC's, wannabemceez
        Never be MC's, cause they can't MC
        How many MC's, wannabemceez
        Never be MC's, cause they can't MC

If a DJ think he man den he better prepare for war!!
