Mos Def,"Yeah, one for the treble
Two for the bass
Welcome to the great incredible paper chase
Keep your boots laced if you want to keep pace

Oh no
Niggas ain't scared to hustle
It's been seven days, the same clothes
Ask them originals cause they know
Mos Def, Nate Dogg, and Pharoahe
Step away from the mic they too cold
The funk might fracture your nose

Say my name, say my name
Observe how I stake my claim
I independently laid down and played my game
My own two raise my flame
'Cause dick ridin' ain't my thing
I earned what they said I wouldn't
I got it the way they said I couldn't
But now I'm gettin' it and their whole grill is crooked
Mad cause I'm getting caked out from my bookings
When ya'll was askin' permission I just stepped up and took it
What!? The kid's better buy my rookie card now
'Cause after this year the price ain't comin' down
And if you got a joint bubbling then get money now
'Cause in a minute there's gonna be some real trouble coming out
Just a warning, as usual some cats won't heed it
The hard headed always gotta feel it to believe it
It's a shame that jealous gays is too short to see it
But when their face hit the cement, they nod in agreement
We could play nice and decent
Or dirty like the 7-1 precinct
Call it a day or make it a long evening
You keep on scheming, making me some more reasons
To have the women in your mama's church screamin' ""Lord Jesus!""
Harder than ya'll cause I'm smarter than ya'll
I know that deep down it's got to be bothering ya'll
Pay attention, watch fly gon' get larger than ya'll
Put your pride on the rocks, make you swallow it all
The mathematic problem for y'all, it just get harder to solve
Every day that the saga evolve
The do or die stay rumbling and bumbling hard
And when we move, we ain't got no discussion at all
East coast on your neck and you ain't shrugging it off
Try to bullyfoot and end up stumbling off
I'm Daddy Brooklyn, y'all niggas are the sons of New York
Getting spanked when there's too much trouble to talk
Respect mine

Oh no
Look at who they let in the back door
From Long Beach to Brooklyn they know
We rock from the east to west coast
Queens salute (they know)
Step away from the mic they too cold
The funk might fracture your nose

Very contagious raps should be trapped in cages
Through stages and wackness, foul rats is blazin'
And it amazes me how you claim thug,
But go two ways without Skytell pagers
I'm intellectual, pass more essays
Than motorcade police parades through East L.A.
More beef then deli's
Thus what I vent is just, what you lust to vent is irrel'
Halleluja, Pharoahe marching through ya
Maintain the same frame of mind school ya
Get the picture, sit ya, seat ya, greet ya with scriptures
I'ma quit the rip ya reach ya
Pharoahe and Mos is verbal osmosis
Coast to coast, we boast to be the most explosive here
Ferocious, the lyrical prognosis
The dose is just leaving you mentally unfocused here
Emcee's just come on 'round
You're the next contestants on ""catch a beat down""
Don't be hesitant sound cracks to sediment
It's evident we're medicine for your whole town
Sky's the limit, game's definite when I'm in it
All window's is tinted, how you seeing me when I'm in it
Rap, we got it on lock man, stop that
Put that mic back down, boy, drop that
Pharoahe's slows blows shows like afros
We hate ya'll though
That's why Nate Dogg goes

Oh no
Niggas ain't scared to hustle
It's been seven days the same clothes
Ask them originals cause they know
Mos Def, Nate Dogg, and Pharoahe
Step away from the mic they too cold
The funk might fracture your nose

Oh no

Mos Def,"Same story, same target, different time
Cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the blind
Trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind
Waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind

Same story, same target, different time
Cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the blind
Trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind
Waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind

Yo, talk about paying the ultimate price
Hurricane been incarcerated all of his life
Started out at like twelve 
Trapped in a belly of hell

Grew into a man inside of a cell
Yo, anger just swell up
At a early age that develop
Hot head and now it ain't shit y'all could tell him

They said he's on a road to become a felon
But instead he swung blows that'll split your melon
He did his thing and was the king of the ring, undisputed
Started making noise but they tried to mute it

They put him through it
For him to make the system look stupid, [yo]
They rather look you in the face and shoot it
And leave your spot looted [or what]

Or leave your whole life blank futured and caught
When you scream at it and do it
With sweat leaking from the outline of your solid
Don't understand the point that you at

Or how the hell you came to it?
Flashback to images of that night, out in Patterson
They pulled him over heading home from a gathering
And when they told him the charge it kind of baffled him
Murder in the first for the champ, we on that again?

[Chorus]
Hurricane
Accuse a Hurricane
Ain't change a damned shame
It's life for Hurricane, Hurricane

Forever, imagine your locked down forever 
Could y'all stand the weather?
Could you hold it together?
You tell me that you know the pain

Yo, imagine if your life was like a hurricane, a hurricane
Forever, imagine your locked down forever
Could ya'll stand the weather?
You built for that weather?

Yo, know what'm saying?
Know what'm saying?

You gotta fight for what you believe in
Nobody knows the troubles seen
This flick left me wondering
'What can become of kings and young kids?'

Summer dream deferred, incident occurred, freedom blurred
A freedom that would only be retrieved again in words, later on
The cops, y'all know what they be on
A nigga's life is like a field that they play upon, away and gone from

Natural lifer, a soul he had to fight,
Learn it himself, sleep days, stay up half the night
Amongst dead man walking, he got afterlife exercising,
Developing his knack to write

Never leaving his cell, in this world he trapped himself
What he loved on the outside world, detached himself
You know the cards Blacks get dealt by the system
He drew a picture of freedom with many dimensions

This picture proved to be bigger than Black and White
A young soul named Lesra brought him back to life
It's amazing to a man what a book could do
And how certain books seem to look for you

This is the story of a champion's fall and rise
The story left me wiping my eyes
Peace are you

[Chorus]

Yo, yo, forever, imagine your locked down forever 
Could y'all stand the weather?
Could you hold it together?
You tell me that you know the pain

Yo, imagine if your life was like a hurricane, a hurricane
Forever and ever yo, locked down forever
Could you stand the weather?
Yo, yo I can't even explain the pain
Just imagine if your life was like a hurricane

Yes, I am the inescapable, the irresistible,
The unnegotiable, the unchallenged [who dat?]
I am time
I scroll in measurements, control the elements,

I hold the evidence, I tell the story [say what?]
I am time
I know no prejudice, I bare no sentiments
For wealth or settlement, I move forward [who you?]

I am time
You can't recover me, conceal or smuggle me,
Retreat or run from me, crawl up or under me,
You can't do much for me besides serve

Me well and have good dividends returned to you
Or attempt to kill me off and have me murder you
Many have wasted me but now they are facing me,
Treated me unfaithfully and now endure me painfully

Plaintively, I wait to see what history will shape to be,
Who's hearts will never die inside the sake of me
Angel's scribe the page for me,
Keep a full account of all the names for me
And make a special mark for Hurricane who (?) patiently

[Chorus]

Yo, yo, a Hurricane forever,
Imagine your locked down forever 
Could you stand the weather?
Could you hold it together?

I can't even explain the pain
Imagine if your life was like a hurricane, a hurricane
Forever, imagine your locked down forever and ever, ever
Could you hold it together?

Yo, can't explain the pain with words, know'm saying?
Just imagine if your life was like a hurricane

The clouds clashed and the heaven's gave birth to star
God placed it in a man on the day he was born
Convicted minutes after, a true natural disaster
Framed for manslaughter, the Hurricane Carter rising

From out the south water, like torrential rains
In the ring no opponent escaped unscathed
You can't believe the world we live in's injust
All I see is more proof, there's no place for us

They had my man Carter locked in a cage, like an animal
Drive him to the point where the mind work mechanical
Or works by remote control 
It was done to all of us, they tapped directly into our soul

Either it's sing-sing, or it's bars around your mind
There's no where to run, no where to hide
In a six-by-six a guilty man cries
For repentance and lost is what innocence is

Same story, same target, different time
Cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the bilnd
Trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind
Waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind

Same story, same target, different time
Cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the blind
Trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind
Waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind

[Chorus]

Your locked down forever 
Could you stand the weather?
Could you hold it together?
I can't even explain the pain, know'm saying?

Your life was like a hurricane, a hurricane
Forever, imagine behind bars forever
Could you stand the weather?
You built for that? Is you cut for that?

Don't be telling me that you know the pain
Your life was like a hurricane, yo

Same story, same target, different time
Cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the blind
Trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind
Waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind

Same story, same target, different time
Cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the blind
Trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind
Waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind",Hurricane,2000
Mos Def,"Took spanish one for four years, just so you know
Spit my shit right here

Oigame, malo muchacho
Mos Def con Tony Flaco, el idioma que yo hablo
Pretty young champ like Camacho, spittin the hot flow
B-Boy shout, Zulu gestapo, bro
You know my stilo, cigarrillo con tamarindo
Habichuelas negras, arroz amarillo
Yo soy suave viejito, campeon nacional como Tito
Bringin the heat bro, unique when I speak yo
Doin my Way like Carlito, beats by M-A-S-E-O
From Panama to Puerto Rico, play my jam on Caliente noventa y siete
On the expressway, and press play, see what ya neck say
Duro siempre, para mi gente, ganamos
Se acabo venga vamos, corillo, alcen las manos
Blowin ya spot like I got toast
A lotta MC's is Def, but they not Mos, and not close
Understand it when I shine, all your light is through
Ya niggas wack in one language, I'm nice in two, fuck is you

[Chorus]
Que eso? Tu no sabe mi sonido
Siempre ganamos, nunca perdimos
Para quien? Blanco, Negro, Latino
Del mundo, cuando junto, que profundo
Que eso? Tu no sabe mi sonido
Siempre ganamos, nunca perdimos
Para quien? Blanco, Negro, Latino
Corillo, so my street folk come unidos

I got chips, to Ziploc grips to burst
Non-conventional, original B-Boy, my peeps call me Merc'
I'm from N.Y.C., so see why in me
There's a lot of hustlin', found around my cheek
Sippin' strawberry daq, that ain't never been fucked
Try to catch me off balance, man, you shit outta luck
Cause we got more rams, and I drivin' y'all
Got the people like the jams, more live than y'all
I'm wit Tone Touch, while ya all touched in the head
Such a lethal combination, got you facin' the red
And um, yo, you don't want no parts in that
You style so pussy, last name should be Cat
We takin it back, like flea stacks and pylons
Wit the ladies in a frenzy, runnin' they nylon
Reveal flesh to test, cause I love bruisin' 'em
Treat my battles like my children nigga, I'm never losin' 'em

Aiyo, what's that? You don't know, that's my sound yo
No one can rock it like this, we put it down yo
For who? Black, white, purple or brown yo
It's Mos, De La, and Touch, we hold the crown yo
Pero what's that? You don't know, that's my sound yo
No one can rock it like this, we put it down yo
For who? Black, white, purple or brown yo
So all my street folk come on gather round yo

Pardon me son, but the only Spanish I knew, was dame un beso
Cut bitches wit niggas, who nettin' the peso
Ya breathin' on beats like this, if you say so
I stay sippin' on God theories, so where the case yo?
Wait flow on four floors like film edits
Fuck sayin' the name, you read it in the credits
Sit that ass down on my lyrics
We servin' niggas up some beans and rice, everything is everything
Heavy metal thing, rock, wit Mos and Pos and us
Written flows get broke down by the comas
From L.I. lawn, I green shit up in my wallets
To fly the wrong places, and get red like scarlet
How I dollar it, I just earn the say
So when the itchy itchy come, I satisfy the crave
And let it fall a little too much
I let Tone touch my ears to let the bullshit disappear

Pa' 'fuera, tu no sabe, mi manera
Native tongue, puttin' it down, donde quiera
De La, Mos Def wit a candela
Borinquen, que bonita bandera
Respect the architect or be next to catch a pela
I send ya all runnin' home to your abuela
Cash rap over a beat or acapella
Kick a wicked rhyme like a fortune teller
This fella, se pone feo quando llego
I still be shoutin' out cats in San Diego
I'm still in effect, and I'm still doin the huevo
I still be putting it down, till I'm a viejo
Man, you can't tell me nothin' about the juego
I told ya suckas before, leggo my eggo
Yet you insist upon playin' wit fuego
But I catch you on the rebound, hasta luego, pendejo

[Chorus]",What's That? (Que Eso?),2000
Mos Def,"We fantastic, flippin' on tracks like gymnastics
Small brats get they ass kicked, me and Mos smash it
Top gun like what comes after the, fist rockin' knife
Check the keys that get played on the roads of life
Yo the rhyme is so heavy like a load of my chest
Travel on these mc's, leave 'em broken like house pets
Priceless like the streets I'm on, my word is born
You like Paula Abdul-ka-ka compared to Sarah Born?
Sayin', what did I do to be so black and blue
Mc's sayin' damn what got it goin after you
Slam my microphone and do just what I have to do
Hey yo, I'd like to stop and chat but I'm just passing through
You know I'd like to stop and chat but I'm just passing through

I'm on my way back to Louis Avenue
Inside Brooklyn the b-boy capital, lot of cats travel to black eratical
Say, my response is invatically yes
We invatically fresh, you dramatically stressed
These mc's proceed to cease the presidential palace
And burn Babylon like a ?
Strive to maintain balance
With the God given talent
Articulate the article, eliminate the fossical
Black Star Line shine remarkable, they style ain't even talk-able
These socalled criminals is fictional they make the party turn miserable
We document the memorable
Then break 'em up like syllables
Straight down to earth like minerals
Your style is foul like down? chemicals
We five-dimensional, audio, visual, physical, spiritual, lyrical
Another world

Another world, y'all
We transmit another world
Another World, y'all
We transmit another world
Another World, y'all
We transmit another world
Black Star 'bout to shine from what

Yo Mos, ain't it a shame how these people treating life like a game
Ain't gonna give you no fame by callin out your name
Just explain how I do it and, lead by example
Stay away from repetition don't wanna sound like no sample
You can't handle this Messiah
My shit is classical we get bug' like Umfufu, ""You treat me like animal!""
Just 'cause you got money, don't mean you made it
Just 'cause you make it don't give you the right to be a ?
Matter fact stay out my face
I can't take it like them stupid big horse bills
Your defense is nill, my chatter, shatter your force field
Kweli and Mos Definition with more lines then a petition
Yo my mission is to break shit in half, like intermission
Then get missin' with Hi-Tech or anyone like that
Costin' one million pounds 'cause it sound so fat
Lay you flat like the carpet
Take the tobacco out my spliff before you spark it
The only tye I rock is chocolate
Makin' profits like Spacely Sprockets, you can't stop it
The topic, we always gonna be black like markets
From the underground, look around and tell me what you see
Another picture painted perfectly by yours truly

Another world, y'all
Say what, another world
Another world, y'all
Say what, another world
Travellin' through, time and space
On the the Black Star galactica
Yo, another world
'nother 'nother, 'nother, 'nother, 'nother world

Never never never soap opera
Whether you, Indian, Dominican, Jamaican or Bolivian
No matter what disc recorder or part of town you livin' in
I recommend you listenin' to these distinguished gentlemen
Who take the proper measurement to represent
The solo's ? chrome is known to built on
Gleam on the measurement
Master MC carpentry
Talib kwa, the Kweli in quality
Put the groundation down properly
You can't trespass the property
Ain't takin' or breakin', robbery
Got the whole owner blast-back policy
Follow me, descendant of the grand master armery
Where cats rock the Wallabe and Kangols, MC's exchange flows
The same goes on, they'll be here when we gone
Hope they heart stay strong for
The other world

Stakes is high like astrophysics
Play with mine, you'll have no winnings

Hand crafted flows wove in silk or linen

Ya vision not sharp
Ya vision can't see the light proper, ya see?

[Talib Kweli]
Movin the crowd like cattle from here to Picadilly Circus
Try to battle us, it's clearly silly and worthless
You really can't hurt us and it's ridiculous to try
So stick us with us unless you want to die and not know why
Yo we spray you with ambition like an inner drive by
Feel the pain of my rain when I snatch the sun out your sky
Thinkin you fly, signin contracts with the devil, bust guys iller
We flatten your town like Godzilla
Whether guilt is a skrilla, Franks or banks, five pence or ten cents
Whatever the currency we currently intense like great sex
You make bets before you gamble your life away
On mics I break up vets like fights
Crumble up rookies like cookies
Lest why'all can deal with them bookies
Aww sooky sooky, now looky looky here
Yo you softer than pink cashmere
Just catchin up with rhymes that I fuckin dropped last year
I flow clear like Evian, tap on that ass like Savion
My style's way beyond the average rhyme savage
The shit that they be on, it ain't doin no damage
If lyrical skills is food then them niggaz is famished
They can't manage so their shit is poorly represented
Necessity's the mother of everything that's embedded
I came up with the style to see right through your smile
My rhyme is true and leave you kinda blue like Miles
Pick my gun up and run up on you just like the river Nile
Bringin life to the mic like midwives deliver child
Now the stakes is high so I'ma take you there
That beef will get you all bloody 'cause your steaks is rare
The hard margin
Why you startin? Your life get finished
Corny cats, no experience, green like spinach
Lookin diminished and malnourished
Me and Mos flourish
The illest shit ever dropped by American tourists
Hard margin

[Mos Def]
What if I drop the hard bargain?
We the reason why Cipher start sparkin
Curse on your whole dance squadron
Black Star shine and never darken
(???) enlarging, hard margin, hard margin
So what if I rise and start sparkin?
From never foolin lofty ass gardens
Rock your whole head, code red like margarine

Mos Def,"Yo, we keep it type raw, and know exactly what we fight for
When the nightfall come, we in the right war
Cats who spill blood for a cause, not just because
Defy the authority and follow god's law
Revolutionary entrepeneurs, who make the fans
Clap they hands and stompin the floor not start the applause
Thank you very much, without further ado
Let me introduce the rest of my crew, mos def!

Yo, I am the world renowned, verb adjective adverb
Pronoun preposition suffix prefix
Original or remix, sunburst and eclipse

Things changed since we came out, been some shit in new york
Niggaz stopped gettin jig in new york, bloods and crips in new york
The y-2-k celebration wasn't big in new york
Babylon live in new york, should I keep a crib in new york
Or just v.i., to handle my b.i.
When with my a-alikes we see with three eyes

Yo kweli I agree I, was thinkin the same thing myself
Smog in the city ain't no good for your health
Things changed in new york, type strange in new york
Forty-deuce don't look the same in new york
Just politics, tricks and big games in new york
Switched trains a writer can't get fame in new york
Internet and wall street got paid in new york
Poor folks and workin class got slayed in new york
Even still, everyday they make weight in new york
Flashlights lookin for a brighter day in new york
In new york they say it's red hot
Will the temperature ease up?  black I guess not
It's multi-lane traffic, no sign for rest stops
No corner breaks, put on your gloves and just box
No dance school to teach you to wop and bus stop
Better get up in the booth, hop up and just rock
If you think it's like that, it's not so just stop
All mankind time runnin down on one watch, just watch

If, you, are, just, coming, in, I, will

We best-sellin authors writin great chapters in history
These cats undercover like gay rappers dealin with mystery
My platinum grey matter spray batter that's specifically
Designed to make rappers break faster than eggshells in the mornin
Inhaled the divine in that's laid dormant
Water from the well stay pourin
I answer back when I hear fate callin
Freedom fighter ready to attack at the crack of a new day dawnin
Way more than necessary skills for the application
My flow is great like the lakes and it rocks like applachains
My facts more than make up for what you lack in imagination
You more confused than tiger woods when he made up cabalaysian
I'm sayin!

Break bounds like the jet concorde
Win awards before I leave for my world award tour
When they scream encore, that's when they want more
Flow steadily, whether I'm on or off shore
High potent, zone coastin, no jokin

Yo
Just when I think that I've forgot you
I hear that thug that we used to rock to
Just When I think I'm gettin' on without you
Somebody Passed and asked me about you

Was in the back of the cab the other day
Swear to God I saw you walking passed the other way
My heart rushed, my face flushed
Tell the driver hit the breaks slow the pace up
Wait up, It wasn't you
Realized it's a mirage I was running to
Damn, can the affects of Love and time
Cause the mind to trick the eye?
I wonder how you gettin' by
And all the stars still in your eyes
But you still just get the five
You break the bank to spend the time
I reminisce of shifting time, to when you was mine

[Bilal]
Years ago, in a mist of hallways and sliding doors
Missing links of family very obscure
Vision of you shine
But only for a short time
My mistake I didn't pick up on it till years down the
Line

Here now as I (reminisce) reminisce, will I ever see
Your face again?

Baby as I lay back (reminisce) will I ever see your

Yes Sir
Yo I reminisce over this chick
Colder than a soda
Princess a soldier
Raised in Islamic culture
Sexy as the girl on the Jamaica poster
Men are over seas where there really don't be no
Sistas
Brought her on stage as Bilal sang ""Soul Sista""
In body parts the blood was thicker
Sweet only tryna make sure it ain't the liquor
She was with a nigga come to find out
She and Sista backstage, conversation kissed her
Made me forget to remember that I pimp the dime
Put the pimpin' aside I see Kenya in her eye
Our connection lies in a life before
For us to meet again was devine law
So I can't describe how deep I dug her
Now only in memory can I hug her
I reminisce why'all

Yo, I speak in whole beat legends
Divide it up in parts and sections
Days I was ministerin' sectors
Direct from the spot, forgotten on your election
Jail laced with fragments, speech clipped with accents
Phenomenal ave and for future and the past tense
Blew up the room in my absence
Live or closed caption watch my song vibrate with passion
The response in action to light bulb irrations
I come from where anything can happen and usually does
You find tension where it used to be love
I use my words to shine light inside the dark valleys
The dark alley, U.K., U.S., New York, Cali
From this king to all counties I out loudly
The clammer ? the chain of things that surround me
And seek bounty or stay stridin' and keep strivin'
I seek guidance, like the sun at the dawn I keep risin'
Like that y'all

Brighter day came my way
Had to decide was I gonna stay
Packed my things and I moved on (move on, move on)
That was the day that it all begun

Yo yo yo nobody knows what tomorrow holds, could be pot of gold
Or a mere pot on top ya stove, still ya got to roll
Climb my obstacles and honor those who paved the harder road
Blazed the trails so a brighter day wasn't far to go
So many stories aren't told, so many lights that aren't shone
Still the world remain ignorant to what the heart should know
My love is audio, transmitted, heard, and felt
My words are mirrors to nearer and observe yourself
To receive (ceive), reflect (reflect), magnify
Let a bright light heal a damaged eye
We hold fort like family ties
Shout the battle cry and what we challenged by
Make the shady stand aside so ? risers can arrive
From native to the natural lives you can't deny the natural vibe
On a Mayfield natural high, artificials can abide
I love to see my masses rise
The joy to make your banners hot
The stronger people unite the way we lookin' for a brighter day

Good evening ladies and gents, close and distant fam
Let me break it down for yall exactly who I am (cav)
That brother straight off of myrtle ave
That dude that make the other dude say that's my man, (cav)
It ain't nothin' I want I can't have
The haters know it's real and that's why they mad
They struggle so hard while I just lay back
They sound under pressure, sweaty and straight wack
I rock like this because I ain't that, (cav)
Tell the players I'm taking the game back
Matter fact tell the coaches, the gms, and owners
Shut down the stadiums, it's ova
I make the cat's in the back draw closer
Get the comp choked up like white folks on oprah
Yeah you dope, but (cav) is more doper
Mo skill, mo style than mo folkas
I hit the lab with good shit to smoke up
And tell the sound man where I want to go from
Blow up, skit sheet across the notepad
School em' all from the drop out to post grads
What history book you do or don't have
There's only two eras of rap, pre and post cav
Now you know that
Stop the train, there's no place for the game left to go at

Cav is my name but you can call me, (cav)
It's all the same abbreviated or whole
Shout it out so it don't be a secret to folk it go, (cav)
Short for cave but I'm not from Cali
I'm from the rotten apple, dirty streets and alleys
Bed-stuy Brooklyn doin' it exactly, get at me!

Holla! like missy and ja rule
Ain't a crowd in the world that cav cannot move
Hot dude, cats was thinkin' it's not true
But come front row at show, I got proof
I went from sellin' candy in junior high school
To servin' spoony g for the fiends, to gnaw to
Got sent upstate on bus, (not cool)
In the yard thinkin' damn should've listen to ma duke
Come home in 99, what the fuck I'm gonna do
I won't move bundles, I got a new hustle
I quit pie baking, started rhyme makin'
Buildin' up my rep to be one of the five greatest
And I ain't saying cav the best nigga out there
But until he appear, I'm sittin' in his chair
And I'ma need a few moments just to get in yall ear
To make you forget the duke was eva even here
I got two words for the world, be prepared!
I got three words for your girl, don't be scared!
And when they ask where the real hip-hop, it's ova here!
And when they ask where Brooklyn at, hold ya ear!

Mos Def,"Wooaahh! yeah
On top of the world
Yeah, that's how my seeds got me feeling' right now
On top of the world
Yeah, you ever felt like you could do anything, (Yeah)
On top of the world
I'ma hold y'all down for real, (Gotcha!)

It was 1996, fourth of July, looking off in the sky
Dealing with thoughts inside, when something caught my eye
It was a silhouette of a beautiful woman, bright with life
Carrying my first seed, looking like she gone bear fruit tonight
We at the African street festival, and she walking around
Talking about the midwife said, that bring the baby down
I'm about to be a father, the sights and sounds,
Seem brighter around me
And for starters, I know I'ma work harder, word
We got home at three in the morning, I was beat
Them contractions started coming as soon as I fell asleep
Three oh five, like every five minutes, then the water broke
We on the go, yelling at the cabbie, cause he's sort of slow
You know them hospitals all trying to get paid, no questions
Hear come the doctor's with they drugs, trying to do see-sections
But my baby stay's strong, in labor for yay long
Eight-pound baby boy, to carry my name on, joy!

Huh, yeah
I know how you feel, Kweli I know how you feel
(That's the sound of joy)
See my brother, I know how you feel, Kweli, I know how you feel
(That's the sound of joy)
So when you, have a seed, come in the world, say dog that shit's real
(That's the sound of joy, y'all)
Huh, Kweli, yo I know how you feel, Kweli, yo I know how you feel

My baby girl

June 10th, 1999, I been on the grind
Since the birth of my son, it's been about, way more then rhymes
Baby on the way, my lady glowing today, at least
That's what the midwife said, on the phone
Anyway, the music got me going away
Like everyday, but it's a blessing, so I gotta have patience
And she got pregnant on a Jamaican vacation
So it's all good, this time well have the baby in a house
I went the hospital route, I know what they all about (Never again)
So I'm out on tour, in Baltimore
Get the call around four, when the water hit the floor (Damn!)
I gotta rock my show, but I gotta go
Got second thoughts about her not going, to the hospital
I left the show early, Mos held me down, good looking (No doubt)
Call the car service, like, take me straight to Brooklyn (Uh huh)
Got the news in the car, stayed sorta calm
But I cried tears of joy,
When they put my daughter in my arms, how precious!

Huh, yeah
I know how you feel, Kweli I know how you feel
(That's the sound of joy)
See my brother, I know how you feel, Kweli, I know how you feel
(That's the sound of joy)
So when you, have a seed, come in the world, say dog that shit's real
(That's the sound of joy, y'all)
Huh, Kweli, yo I know how you feel, Kweli, yo I know how you feel

I do it for the seeds y'all,
In they formative years when they need y'all
We gotta believe, in what we conceive y'all, it's deep y'all
I give them the truth,
So they approach the situation, with ammunition
I keep nothing away,
They hear everything, cause they know how to listen
Teach them the game, so they know they position, so they can grow
And make decisions, that change the world, and break old tradition
They put kids in jail, for a life they ain't even get to start
That's murder too, and it's breaking my heart,
It's breaking our nation apart
We gave the youth all the anger, it's just
We ain't taught them, how to express it, and so it's dangerous
You can't talk to them
Unless your language is relating to what they going through
So busy ignoring them, you can't see what they showing you
And you wonder, why we called baby-daddy's and baby-momma's
When we grow up, we can't act like adult mothers and fathers, yo
I'm so blessed to have a boy and a girl,
Everyday they bring joy to my world

Huh, yeah
I know how you feel, Kweli I know how you feel
(That's the sound of joy)
See my brother, I know how you feel, Kweli, I know how you feel
(That's the sound of joy)
So when you, have a seed, come in the world, say dog that shit's real

Mos Def,"My mind compliance like a science
Analyze my data, not a fader on the face of the earth
Can blend rhythms like my will, surreal spinnin'
Ever-movin' like evolution it's retribution
For sellin' roots, lessen futures, I'm steppin' to fuse? ya
Sun rises my subconsciousness culminates constant
Live to see various I-de-ologies, angles like isosceles
Read my auto-b-I-ography
So many stars? to me that vibrantly shine
Velocity's properly thick like mahogany dimes
We findin' beauty in this urban-gritty usually overlooked by many
Movin' through the densely populated city
And soon and eventually 'we gotta get ova'
I document culture closer to the edge
Bolder than a print, open to interpretation, gazin deep into the glitz?
To my people, raise you fists
I know it stays intent, whatever pays your rent, but saves your soul
You know the drill, it go

Tell your whole crew, it's somethin' that you need to know, dude
This is how we go through

Who the poisoned pen?
Mos got the inkwell full of syrum
Prescribed for any emcee claimin' they ill
A small dose'll change the way that they feel
Milligrams in the raw, snow-cut, check how I label the pill
It's MD, the spit-doctor, chant like a witch-doctor
Recite me, and ya whole ailment get proper
I'm the, medicine man, representin' my clan
Mixin' the potion with verse fire and simmer, my man
And stay shoutin' out the home team wherever I am:
It's the B-R-O double akh-K-L-wY-liN out
The cowboys who don't fret to pull they lamas? out
Ironhorse style cab?, hoop-te ville ridin out
No lights, no cam, action, drama'd out
? out, absorb the shit that I'm about
Inner-city Bruno, ghetto folks, holla out
I'm good money, tell the doubters get they wallets out
Hot when the dice is out, they go broke findin' out
Smack ya mojo, caught a half of 'oh no'
Magical vocals, get it down like coastals?

Tell your whole crew, it's somethin' that you need to know, dude
This is how we go through

Exposed to a higher set of variables, as fly as aerial
Definin' stereo components, moments with my master
Remasterin' techniques, havin' some fresh sheets
Damagin' margins with a broader outlook 'we lookin' out, y'all'
Me and Mr. Mighty Mos, we outlaws
Blazin' in the saddle, raisin like the mornin' star, formin majestic
Candescent like the street lamps, I-be-amped to inn-o-vate
Reminiscent of technology, probably just my will to build
To real notions of emotions similar to the seven seas
Steadily sparkin' cables, tables turnin' like the high tide
I'm captive to this music, vastness, into it I skydive
Tumblin' like buildings crumblin' on inner-cities cumbersome
They comin' to run us out, my niggas shout for justice
You wanna link with me, then let me know
This music is like my vessel so we seem to be inseparable
From C-C-town, headed eastbound

Peace, peace whats up y'all this is Mos Def
And this is a message to the people
If you see or hear goodness from me
Then that goodness is from The Creator
You should be thankful to The Creator for all of that
'Cause I'm not the architect of that
I'm only the, the recipient
If you see weakness or shortcoming in me
It's from my own weakness or shortcoming
And I ask The Creator and the people to forgive me for that

I stepped on the field from no league just home team
I Jumped out the stands and I snatched the rock
With the final seconds +one to land+ on the clock
Mos post up to throw up the tie-breakin shot
I put it through the net and let the world's jaw drop
Then fled the arena before they called cops
Tell the players and the coach I wasn't trying to blow spot
But the way they was ballin' made it difficult to watch
I was taught when there's somethin' you can change around
Keep quiet, you got nothin' to complain about
You got work to do, I don't know if that work for you
But that's how Mos work it through
And my work is personal, I'm a working person
I put in work, I work with purpose
I get it there, on the water, air, the surface
You feel the impact? Niggas yeah it's working
Listen God did not make me a fearful person
The only fear I have, Is my failure to ad hear his path
I would love it just to hear this back
On the ghetto streets where y'all at
On the ave's where the Jeep's go past
In the coupes where the seats go back
In the parties where it be so packed
And the atmosphere be so black
And them black things be so phat
If I could I would be so glad
But if not I won't be so mad
I'm still being a man, still feeding my fam'
And even if you don't see it my fam
I believe that I am, truly gifted, truly blessed
I'm yours truly, Brooklyn's own, Mos Def
I'm rocking the hard right, ground zero, to far left
I'm, well balanced, with immense talents
Burn the script, then flip it to keep myself challenged
And that's the mark of a true champ-ine
That's whether I'm in or outside the ring
No fights, no tilte, no crown or reign
Feel my presence even when I'm up out this thing
Just trust, that's what I'm about to be
But until then settle in and rock with me

Ha, that's what its about to be
Ghetto people look alive with me
And say, We 'goin, stop by
Then we just keep moving on

Feel free, we just keep moving on

Pouring liquor on the day you was born

Alright, ok, so, shut-up!
Speak language come straight from the gutter
Observe the terms that we trade with one and other
Like, what's good, what's popping, what's cracking
What it is, how you living, what's happening
Work songs that the slaves sang back then
The playground chants, with little girls clapping

Welcome to soundview projects
Bronx new york, 10473

Intersection action ribs touching
New gutter smacks replacing the whole dutchman
Loose mamis fucking, they definite land mines
Dudes with no right hustle throwing gang signs
Empty in the webbings broke and underpaid
Fighting federal cases with legal aids
The unlit stage tonight performing lime desires to eat
Can get you in a 8 by 5, the corner's younger
I smell feel touch and taste they hunger
Next in line to rep these street signs to they blunder
Under, wiping tears from his eyes facing the felony
These niggas wanna be pistol pete -without the penalty
His last words, promise me this much in death
Don't my boy live to retrace my steps

Minne stay safe move quiet and get it
If you encounter opposition get a inch from they face with it

Later amigo, digest the day to end discreetly
Sex money and boss
My ties to hear me see me
True villain
Face covered, driving gloves
Commit by my lonely when push comes to shove
They say that grown men lay on they prey
Took shorts in the street
Came back and made up for that with that white sheet
Revenge is best served cold
Get it the same way you give it
This ain't fear I just need to get away with it
Son stop over here(?), you looking at me like I'm lame
But I'm looking at y'all like y'all call this the drug game
Grand child hosing sims
Put the heroin in queens
Put pops freeman on in the early seventies
I sat in rooms with money machines
Drugs sitting 3 feet off of the floor
Cover the smell of the raw
Chess moves like barksdale, my connects untimely
King henry from 12th street flooded the bronx in the 90's
03 scene mvp and one accord
Boss makes decision paper wins awards

See me, hear me

Welcome to brooklyn, new york city 11206
Roosevelt projects, wild rose water the plant

Son you know what it is
From the moment that you come over the bridge
And if you don't ride with me
I'm gonna show you some shit
I'ma show you where my niggas stay sure on the mix
I'ma show you where the pain and the poetry is
Ghetto young'ns spend a lot of time alone in the crib
Bet on the screen, walls and posters of big
Hustlers getting dough sitting low on the 6
Blazing up the ambro glow over they wrist
Hop in the game knowing the risk
Still down to load up they clip
Gamblers with hopes of rolling the trip
But when you hear head crack there ain't no rolling again
Snatch the dice and everything you want is going it in
This how it happens, good people, bad habits, diabetics, crack addicts
Asthmatics
Searching for the truth leaping through the holy tablet
The bible, the q uran, or the ten crack commandments
Speak on it god, what's today's mathematics
The five day forecast, the dow jones average
The price of beer, cigarettes, bread, milk and pampers
Life is a test and we all got the answer
The streets keep calling its hard not answer
And on my government-my attribute-my all
So it's only natural I holla black and respond
Brooklyn stand up and make 'em all sit down
We do not fuck around

That's what it is (all day)
That's what is niggas (official, official)
That's how it is niggas

Aha yeah
Throw it up
Ghetto rock with me
Show it up

Born to rock, since my pawn shift rise ?
Rock the booze water on any bully on your block
My flow tighter than a big titties halter top
Doper than a Floyd flake that they bought they pops
Since I bright a con duke of course I'm not
My sharp mind join the dots and blow they plots
A lot of cats talk noise a lot, but then the noise is stopped
When the heavy sound voice in charge
And this is no Limp Bizkit this is jack's fat cock
Loaded up slightly back, ghetto black rock

These the hungry hands that goin' snatch your cash box
I never gave a second what on ""the fuck is with y'all?""
Cause my first thought covered it all
You whack!
And I don't care what you sound since not mumbling y'all
Cause you can't do me nothing at all
Which means, you can't shine my shoes watch my drawers
Clean my cloth walk my dog moan my loan

All I got is hard rhymes and hot spit for them
And yeah, I got the country new (rat) for them
See how dark it can get for them?
Tell their mommas THAT'S IT for them
Get the flowers, they'll sing for them
A sad story how it'll end for them

All the way from the 2-1-5th to Bucktown
Brace yourself, it's about to go down

Runnin one on one and only hip-hop bound
Yo Tariq (whassup) how your micraphone sound

We got to blow up the spot, because they must have forget
We double (trouble) bubble (bubble) bubble (bubblin hot)

Well it's like smack the track up and leave dents in it
The vocalist, bustin this blunt, instrument spit
The magnificent, rapper's run from it
All fly girls, nipples and toes, numb from it
MC's in my circumference, is confronted son
Get your growth stunted from this, you don't want it
(What nigga?)  The Black Thought and M-O-S Def done it
Who the ultimate?  Yo my man speak upon it

Aiyyo I stop fools and drop jewels but never run it
Rock mics so nice I make you stock price plummet
All you high noon riders better rally at the summit
It's me and Tariq and your fleet outnumbered
Cross the membrane barkin big game and get hunted
Eyewitness account, say it happened so sudden
Just slid off to the side, didn't really say nuttin
Then BLAOW, blew away the 1900th

You better get your rest cause the next day comin
Oh yes, and MC's they scared to say sum'tin
Stop frontin, I'm in the cut just onlookin
Your get your kings, your rooks, rings and pawns tooken

Aiyyo, keep your tape rollin so you catch every bar
of the Black Thought and the black man from Black Star
Illadelph and Vietnam we conference, accomplish
Even with stakes inclined, I get mine, regardless

Yo, a lot of Smurfette MC's carry purses
And rock, uniforms, that's made for nurses
I burst your verses, your words is worthless
Only touchin surface, the FUCK's the purpose?

I shot the sherriff, the deputy, and head of bank treasury
So mounties in the county got a BIG bounty stressin me
But tell 'em to hold off, they too short to measure me
Mos and Black Thought blast forth with the weaponry

And make sure beans don't burn in the kitchen

Two to rock rhyme (two to rock rhyme)
From the muscle kid I'm one of the illets of all time
I swing from chandeliers and wall climb
And specialize in warfares of all kind
A lot of MC's said I'm a run it down rhyme
But half the time, they run it down one of mine
Thought suffocatin em with yet another stunnin line
You dumb and blind kid, it's enlarged and underlined

What I memorized leave your whole staff pressurized
Melt down all of your artificial lies
Y'all niggaz is faker than Yellow No. 5
Swine like mono and diglyceride
My vocals got texture, you just texturized
I'm nicer than your writtens even when I'm improvised
Step into my zone get flown like fly
by the b-boy Lazarus who just won't die

Yo, me and Kamal and Leanord Hubbard, ?uestlove and Malik
We go back to dollar hoagies and Tahitian Treat
Or like toast in the oven with government cheese bubblin
Me and Dante like Marvin, The Troublemen travellin
Give me the mic, we on that again

About two young brothers who got so much soul
They takin total control, of the body and brain
Flyin high in the sky, on a lyrical plane

And ask her just one more time

Fall back without recovering time, and time's up

Hold it down for my side of the map

Got a problem with that?
The holler back and the stars is black
We the New Era you just a Starter cap
Find out what happens when the artist in tact
Be sharp as a tack, fall back you smarter than that

Or perhaps you just ain't as smart as you think
Figure 8'n on the thin ice part of the rink
You a vessel that's promised to sink
Terra Firma ain't as hard as you think
Stare down, and you starting to blink

Like 182 this for fellas and the ladies who
Don't need to be spoon fed like baby food

You come on every Wednesday on your lunch brake I think
You always order the special, with the hot chocolate
Look man I mean, I know girls don't usually do this
But I was wonderin'
If maybe we could get together outside the restaurant one day
You know, 'cause I do look a lot different outside my work clothes
Wait a minute, my cell phones breakin' up
Can you hear me now?
Yeah, so what day did you say?

Mos Def,"Memories on the corners with the fo's and the mo's
Walk to the store for the rose, talking straightforward to hoes
Got uncles that smoke, and some put blow up they nose
To cope with the lows, the wind is cold and it blows
In their socks and their soles, niggas holding they rolls
Corners leave souls opened and closed, hoping for mo'
With nowhere to go, niggas rolling in droves
They shoot the wrong way, cause they ain’t knowin' their goals
The streets ain’t safe cause they ain’t knowing the code
By the foes I was told, either focus or fold
Got cousins with flows, hope they open some doors
So we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls
Now I roll in a Olds, with windows that don’t roll
Down the roads where cars get broken and stole
These are the stories told by Stony and Cottage Grove
The world is cold, the block is hot as a stove
On the corners

I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?

We overstated, we underrated, we educated
The corner was our time when time stood still and
Gators and snakeskins and
Yellow and pink and profiles

Street lights and deep nights, cats trying to eat right
Riding no-seat-bikes, with work to feed hypes
So they can get sweet Nike's, they head and they feet right
Desires of street life, cars and weed types
It’s hard to breathe nights, days are thief-like
The beasts roam the streets, the police is Greek-like
Game at its peak, we speak and believe hype
Bang in the streets hats cocked left or deep right
It’s steep life, coming up where niggas is sheep-like
Rappers and hoopers, we strive to be like
G's with three strikes, seeds that need light
Cheese and recite, needs and BE strife
The corner, where struggle and greed fight
We write songs about wrong ‘cause it’s hard to see right
Look to the sky, hoping it will bleed light
Reality's a bitch, and I heard that she bites
The corner

I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?

The corner was our magic, our music, our politics
Fires raised as tribal dances and war cries
Broke out on different corners
Power to the people
Black power
Black is beautiful

Black church services, murderers, Arabs serving burgers
As cats with gold permanents, move they bags as herbalists
The dirt isn’t just fertile, it’s people working and earning this
The curb getters go where the cash flow and the current is
It’s so hot that niggas burn to live
The furnace is, where the money moving, the determined live
We talk shit, play lotto, and buy German beers
It’s so black packed with action that's affirmative
The corners

I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?

Our Taj Mahal, our monument

I was home wishing for a rainy dayyay..(/singing)
I didn't have friends 'cause I barely even spoke
My head was mad out on a ill uni flow
Surrounded outside by thievs and crooks
I found a little peace in stars and books
My outside contact was limited
'cause I was different and heads couldn't get wit it
(singing)i used to get mistaken???? when all I ever really wanted was some
Love
???remember drew back many tears??? that I kept inside for so many years
All but galactic intuition, I learned the skill of being self sufficient
Heads got live, while I took the train
I watched the sky and let the daytime fade(/singing)
Go through whole twenty four hrs is sorrow
Role lay down and do the shit all again tomorrow
Keepin compsure is a way??to burden??
And smiling in your face??while my chess is hurtin'??

If they won't' give it to me I'm taking my respect
And I'm using all means at hand
Because apparently motherfuckas don't understand
They don't know the fury behind the meekness
Mistaking my kindness for weakness well peep this

Coming out the deck with aces and jokers
Flushing whoever comes closest
Sticktly hands over ears when you try to make amends
I've got my pad and pencil who the hell needs friends
You think I'm on some shit, you god damn right

They come through, and they, I guess trying to recover people
And they see this women she's wading through the streets
I guess it'd been some time after the storm
And I guess they were shocked that you know she was alive
And rescue worker said, ""So, oh my God h-how did you survive
How did you do it? Where've you been?""
And she said, ""Where I been? Where you been?""

He got a policy for handling the niggas and trash
And if you poor you black
I laugh a laugh they won't give when you ask
You better off on crack
Dead or in jail, or with a gun in Iraq
And it's as simple as that
No opinion my man it's mathematical fact
Listen, a million poor since 2004
And they got -illions and killions to waste on the war
And make you question what the taxes is for

Ha ha bust it yo
Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
Is the city I live in, is beautiful Brooklyn
Long as I live here believe I'm on fire hey
Cause it's the B-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
L-Y-N is the place where I stay
The B-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
Best in the world and all USA
It's the B-to-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
L-Y-N is the place where I stay
The B-to-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
Place where I rest is on my born day
Bust it, sometimes I sit back and just reflect
Watch the world go by and my thought connect
I think about the time past and the time to come
Reminisce on Bed-Stuy when I was pride and young
I used to try and come, to the neighborhood function
Throw on my Izod, say a little something
When I was just a youngin, before the days of thugging
How me and Charlie Chims (hey yo what?) I'm only bugging
Fast forward, Nine-Now I gotta team my seed
I must proceed at God's speed to perform my deed
Living the now space and time, round the nine to five
For as long as I'm alive, paw I got to strive
I ain't sitting roadside, that ain't harder to plan
I'm out here for my fam doing all that I can
I love my city, sweet and gritty in land to outskirts
Nickname Bucktown cause we grown to outburst
Philosophy redefine us, touch mines I touch back
Walk the streets like a sweet and get beat like drum tracks
Catch no shakes over jakes (boomp-boomp! ) we bust back
Bring the Marty to your face wit no place to run back
I'm from the slums that created the bass that thump back
This ain't a game clown, play ya James Brown and jump back
What you want, Jack? Young cats stash they jums at
Draw they guns back, momma screams where she sons at
Trying to hunt that, recurring dream of high stakes
The fourth largest, first artist, Brooklyn is the place
Settled by the judge many years ago
Three billion strong and here we go

Good morning Vietnam!
Ha (back up back up back up back up back up) [repeated in background]
Yo sometimes I sit back, reflect on the place that I live at
Unlike any place I ever been at
The home of big gats, deep dish hammer rim caps
Have a mishap, push ya wig back
Where you go to get the fresh trim at
Four on the Jake got the Timb rack
Blue collars metro carding it
Thugs mobbing it, form partnership
Increase armorment, street pharmacist
Deep consequence, when you seek sleek ornaments
You get caught, rode the white horse and can't get off
Big dogs that trick off just get sent off
They shoebox stash is all they seeds gotta live off
It's real yo but still yo, it's love here
And it's felt by anybody that come here
Out of towners take the train, plane and bus here
Must be something that they really want here
One year as a resident, deeper sentiment
Shout out ""Go Brooklyn!"", they representing it
Sitting on they front stoop sipping Guinesses
Using native dialect in they sentences
From the treeline blocks to the tenements
To the Mom & Pop local shop menaces
Travel all around the world in great distances
And ain't a place that I know that bear resemblance
That's why we it The Planet
Not a borough or a prov, it's our style that's uncalm
From sun to the? to the Lafayette Gardens
White coff guawinas in they army jacket linings
Yo this goes out to my cats in Coney Isle
Friday night out in front The Himalaya going wild
This goes out to Crown Heights and Smurv Village
The nighties, and all my yarda trenny  Brown's Village
Parkside tennants caught, thirties, forties, and the fifties
The cats out in Starite City getting busy
To the Hook, to the East, to the Stuy
Bushwick and Kanarcy, Farraget, Fullgreen, and Marcy
My Flatbush posse, generals of armies
When it's time to form, just call me
And let this song be, playing loud in Long B
If you love Bucktown strongly!
Raise it up!

Brooklyn my habitat, the place where it happen at
Live sway and the sharp balance of the battle axe
Irons is brandished at, thugs draw they hammer back
It's where you find the news tool crew cameras at
It's where my fam is at, summertime jame is at
They play Big and get you open like a sandal back
Hotter than candle wax, hustling you can't relax
The crack babies trying to find where they mama's at
It's off the handle black, wit big police scandals that
Turn into actions screenplays sold to Miramax
The type of place where they check your appearance at
And cats who know where all the hot 'lo gear is at
The stomping grounds, where you find a pound, smoke is that
Be blazing charm that have your wave cap floating back
The doorstep where the dispossessed posted at
Dope fiends out at Franklin Ave selling zovarax
You big balling better keep your money folded back
Cause once the young guns notice that it's over, black
Brooklyn keep on taking it, worldwide we known for that

Fire from the cold steel
The heat from the brights
The temperature of flesh and the shortness of breath

The aroma of sesamilia dollar superstar
Skama like a new cocaine tobacco leaf
Ecstatic tabernists fire water and freaks
The murder of a teenage chief
My easy speaking is as easy as it seems to be
Hungry belly jamma busts off easily
Balloon bang. pop!
Hot as a bang spot in bangkok
Colder than a pimp glock
Aim shot, the frame drops
Pressure pushed him to the earth like a rain drop
Take not life in vein
And how the preacher was saying
Remember!
Anyways they laid him in a stray box
Dark suit and gray socks
The neighborhood is all distraught
Candles lit the stoop at the park
Where the family and students are
Confused, in awe
They gape into each others arms
It's murder!
New absence from a mothers arm
Even the warmth from the mother's arms
Couldn't keep her son from harm
From standing where the gun was drawn
Over come, done and done. he's gone

Murder!
Shells fell like a bell that rung
Blood bursts, body temperature fell and plunged
And by the time it took the medics to come
The breath eased out of his lungs
And his soul eased out of the slums
And the voice eased out of the drums
The sirens through their ears, they sung
Murder!
Telephone wire, sneakers hung
Murder!
For the black and young
Murder!
And the aves they from
I am from the block the president did not campaign on
Where the dollar that the working poor slave for is made on
Where hustlers stretch the yay long
And hustle hard for an outpost to trade on
Flip it over and make more
Where the blocks are yellow taped off
Where the young blood is trained on obese to the fakesoft
Where the pressure just stays on
But the lights and the heat don't
The place where you witness the true power of street folk
And that's where I'm coming from people

Eighth, o-z, and kilo

Or contemplated murder, robbery, or suicide?

Or taken down a number? For taking up a scheme?

You fantasize as they be living it through
The big home with the beautiful view
You have a swim in the pool, and get fresh
And take a spin in the coupe

You probably want to feel the world in your palm
While hold a gun in your hand
And make 'em know you a star
Tell the truth
And there's those who probably already are
They well known in they zone
Or they town or they block

Then there's the rest who are usually not
And the heavy dose of thug feel like all that they got

Walk to the store for the rose talking straightforward to
Got uncles that smoke it some put blow up they nose
To cope with they lows the wind is cold & it blows
In they socks & they souls holding they rolls
Corners leave souls opened & closed hoping for more
With nowhere to go rolling in droves
They shoot the wrong way cause they ain't knowing they goal
The streets ain't safe cause they ain't knowing he code
By the fours I was told either focus or fold
Got cousins with flows hope they open some doors
So we can cop clothes & roll in a Rolls
Now I roll in a ""Olds"" with windows that don't roll
Down the roads where cars get broke in & stole
These are the stories told by Stony & Cottage Grove
The world is cold the block is hot as a stove
On the corners

[Chorus]
I wish I could give ya this feeling
I wish I could give ya this feeling
On the corners, niggas robbing, killing, dying
Just to make a living (huh)

We underrated, we educated
The corner was our time when times stood still
And gators and snakes gangs and yellow and pink
And colored blue profiles glorifying that

Streetlights & deepnights cats trying to eat right
Riding no seat bikes with work to feed hypes
So they can keep sweet Nikes they head & they feet right
Desires of streetlife cars & weed types
It's hard to breath nights days are thief like
The beast roam the streets the police is Greeklike
Game at it's peak we speak & believe hype
Bang in the streets hats cocked left or deep right
Its steep life coming up where sheeplike
Rappers & hoopers we strive to be like
G's with 3 stripes seeds that need light
Cheese & weaves tight needs & thieves strike
The corner where struggle & greed fight
We write songs about wrong cause it's hard to see right
Look to the sky hoping it will bleed light
Reality's and I heard that she bites
The corner

[Chorus]

The corner was our magic, our music, our politics
Fires raised as tribal dancers and
War cries that broke out on different corners
Power to the people, black power, black is beautiful

Black church services, murderers, Arabs serving burger its
Cats with gold permanents move they bags as herbalist
The dirt isn't just fertile its people working & earning this
The curb-getters go where the cash flow & the current is
It's so hot that burn to live the furnace is
Where the money move & the determined live
We talk play lotto & buy german beers
It's so black packed with action that's affirmative
The corners

The corner was our Rock of Gibraltar, our Stonehenge
Our Taj Mahal, our monument,
Our testimonial to freedom, to peace and to love

Mos Def,"Love rain down on me, on me, down on me

Met him on a Thursday, sunny afternoon
Cumulus clouds, 84 degrees
He was brown, deep
Said he wanted to talk about my mission
Listen to my past lives (Word?)
Took me on long walks to places where butterflies rest easy
Talked about Moses and Mumia
Reparations, blue colors, memories of shell top adidas
He was fresh, like summer peaches
Sweet on my mind like block parties and penny candy
Us was nice and warm, no jacket, no umbrella, just warm
At night we would watch the stars
And he would physically give me each and every one
I felt like cayenne pepper, red, hot, spicy
I felt Dizzy and Sonia, heaven and Miles between my
Thighs
Better than love, we made delicious
He me had, had me he
He had me tongue tied
I could hear his rhythm in my thoughts
I was his sharp, his horn section
His boom and his bop
And he was my love

Love rain down on me, on me, down on me

The rain was fallin and,and slowly and sweetly and stinging 
My
Eyes
And I could not see that he became my voodoo priest
And I was his faithful concubine
Wide open, wide, loose like bowels after collard greens
The mistake was made
Love slipped from my lips
Dripped down my chin and landed in his lap
And us became new
Now me non-clairvoyant and in love
Made the coochie easy and the obvious invisible
The rain was falling
And I couldn't see the season changing
And the vibe slipping off its axis
Our beautiful melody became wildly staccato
The rain was falling and I could not see
That I was to be plowed and sowed and fertilized
And left to drown in his sunny afternoon
Cumulus clouds, 84 degrees, melody

Love rain down on me, on me, down on me (2x)

Wide open wide loose
The mistake was made
Love slipped from my lips
Dripped down my chin and 
Landed in his lap
And us became new
Me not clairvoyant and in love 
Made me the fool
You were never true
If you didn't want me
Ah you should have let me know
All you did was make a mockery of 
Of something so incredible, beautiful

I honestly did love you so.....

Love rain down on me, on me, down on me

(Mos Def:)

I stretch my arms towards the sky like blades of tall grass,
The sun beat between my shoulders like carnival drums.
I sat still and hoped it would help my wings grow
So then I could really be fly.
And then she arrived.
Like daybreak inside a railway tunnel,
Like the new moon,
Like a diamond in the mines,
Like high noon to a junker,
Sudden...
She made my heart beat in the now, now time signature,
Her skin a canvas for ultra violet brush strokes.
She was the sun's painting,
She was a deep cognac color,
Her eyes fall for that lights along the new city,
Her lips purse as if her breath was too sweet and full for her mouth to hold.
I said:
""You are the beautiful distress of mathematics,""
I said:
""For you, I will peal open the clouds like new fruit,
And give you lightning and thunder as a dowry,
I will make the sky shed all of its stars like rain,
And I will cast the constellations across your waste,
And I will make the heavens your keep.
And they will be pleased to cover you,
They will be pleased to cover you,
May I please... cover you...

Five story fire as you came
Love is losing game

One I wished, I never played
Oh, what a mess we made
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game

Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand

Self-professed profound
Till the chips were down
Know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand

Though I battled blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love is a fate resigned

Over futile odds
And laughed at by the gods
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game",Love Is a Losing Game,2007
Mos Def,"I've been gone awhile away from you
And I hope you overstand
That I've got to do what I must do
To be a better man
Cuz if I was to just to act a fool
Do nothing with myself
Then all my blessings would be cursed
My world would crumble in
It's a joy when I sit down and
Think of the good times that we have
And what we do to make it through
When the good turns to the bad
Well I hope you'll find it in your heart
And know these words are true
And please don't fuss
Because I must go do what I must do

Hey baby don't you worry
Even though the road is rocky
I'll be coming home to you again
Cuz if you thought that I was lost
I had to bare my cross
Now I'm free from all these Chains

A time, a space, a different place
How perfect we might be
I would be the wind that blows
You'd be that willow tree
And I could never bare the thought of you not by my side
So I would be the warmth of day
You'd be the cool of night
And everyday I pray to Jah that one day you will see
And overstand the fact I must fulfill my destiny

I hope you'll find it in your heart and know these words are true
And please don't cry
Cuz you know that I must do what I must do


Well and it's not easy
Jah knows how I try, I try
So don't you get weary
Jah knows how I try, I try

God knows
Life is one big road
With alot of signs and turns & twists and curves
Even though the road is rocky
My main thing's to rock and keep on rockin'
From city to city
Backyard to yard
And we be seein' the sights, standin' under the lights
And the spot is hot, it's cold and lonely at night
And I'm feenin' and I'm dreamin' and I'm holding you tight
But hold on, every single road I roll on
Comes to an end and I'm back home again
So baby please don't cry, there's no valley low and there's no mountain high
And our love don't die with the passage of time
It just grows more,
And just keep strong
And even though I'm gone, I am never too far
You're the light through the dark, shining right through my heart
So my journey must start",Hey Baby,2007

Put your head in the toilet and look son,
If you think my shit done changed
My shit is, out of your range, rip you out of your frame
Cop your tape, and the next day, copped an exchange
If you ain't, rockin' raw, what you rockin' for??
Without heat, y'all MC's, ain't hot no more
So for you lame cats tryin' to put your hit out
Try rockin' back and forth

Wackest MC's, we pee on those
No need to impede The High and Mighty mystique
That shit would be as ignorant as Jimmy the Greek
Claimin' they Godzilla's when they really Godzooki
Got a mill' from Charlie Brown, when I kidnapped Snoopy

Rhyme menace, that burst your verbal nuisance
In accordance, with all the laws from the cordless
Starbuck coming through, leavin any pimp whoreless

Speed work through the earth make your motor go scurr!
Tonight at noon watch a bad moon rising
Identities in crisis and conflict diamonds
Blindin' staring at lights till they cryin'

Grapes of wrath in a shapely glass

Does a computer chip have an astrology
And when it fuck up could it give you an apology
Could it
Should it say hello or should it say goodbye

Things are so passionate times are so real
Sometimes I try an chill mellow down blowin smoke
Smile on my face but its really no joke
You feel it in the streets people breathe without hope
They goin' through the motion, they dimmin' down they focus
The focus gettin' clear and the light turn sharp
And the eyes go teary, the mind grow weary
I speak it so clearly sometimes ya don't hear me
I push it past the bass no nations gotta feel me
I feel it in my bones, black, I'm so wide awake
That I hardly ever sleep, my flows forever deep
And its volumes or scriptures when I breath on a beat
My presence speak volumes before I say a word
I'm every where penthouse pavement and curb
Cradle to the grave tall lead you onna shell
Universal ghetto life holla black you know it well

Quiet storm vital form pen pushed it right across
Mind is a vital force, high level right across
Shoulders the lions raw voice is the siren
I swing round ring out and bring down the tyrant
Shocked a small act could knock a giant lopsided
The world is so dangerous there's no need for fightin'
Suttins tryna hide like the struggle won't find 'em
And the sun bust through the clouds to clearly remind him

Forgive me and forget me, make a brand new start
Don't blink your eyes and say goodbye
I know, you know that I know, you know that love is danger

If you are to fall in love
Then where should you stand to begin with?
And when the falling's done
How bad should you plan to get injured?

And if you land on your feet
Do it count as a fall or a jump?
And do it feel like a fall when the hands that pushed you
Were holding you up?

Close encounter, got you wide open
Heartache got your boom box going
Music and vocals, lonely and soulful
You're back in the scene where your sweet dreams are so true

Believe me when I tell you I never meant to break your heart
May God pick up the pieces of dreams that fall apart
Forgive me and forget me, make a brand new start
Don't blink your eyes and say goodbye
Cause I know, you know that I know, you know what love is

Lay the law keep it raw, when I speak it from the core
Get underneath your skin like especially with the claw
Conflicted with the rich 'cause I kick it with the poor
I laugh in the face of adversity
Sound clashed with the bass 'cause it's natural to me
But if you pay attention to the past you will see
Not long ago you black they'd hang your ass from a tree
Certain things things change, while some stay the same
Some are recluse others are lovers of the game

Mos Def,"""We've only just begun""

Oh, yes, indeed, I like this, I like this
Hey, yo, Hi-Tek, do me a favor, man
Speed it up a little bit

From the intro you know I'm so influential 'cause I'm glowing like a candle
The focus is so essential, dog; what you tryna get into?
I steady the flow, ready to blow like snotty tissue
They snitching like Donnie Brasco, I'm counting like Monte Cristo
The ghetto full of betrayal like Iago and Othello
Your fellow neighbor will slay you; they'll smoke you like cigarillos
Police want that info--they'll grill 'em like Portabellos
I'm murdering instrumentals 'cause I rap with the conscience
Of felons, killers, and monsters, so revealing and honest
We're still feeling the promise; some nights I kill 'em with kindness
Hitting like Muhammad Ali; you more like Tatyana
All this is probably Karma: you dishonored the father
Whether it's God almighty or the almighty dollar
We follow the prophets like Islamics or the Dalai Lama
Your bullet points so hollow they could probably pierce body armor
Look in the scope; my people still a target

Smile on my face, tears of a sad clown
Feeling out of place as I whistle a cab down
If I tip extra, can I huff a cig'?
Blow my smoke out the window, dropping ashes on the bridge
Uh, I'm in New York now like Akeem and Semi was
Tryna get the lobby door open from a semi-buzz
I just wanna go to the slum
And throw my money on the floor like the Notorious B-U-M, uh
Build a home, teach a class, start a revolution
Free the mind, heal the body, talking evolution
This that black Elohim, Anunnaki rap
That Farrakhan, Hakeem Olajuwon, Qaddafi rap
I dedicate this to my niggas in New Orleans
Rocking black and gold stocking caps and fleur-de-lis Shockey hats
I'm in the coatroom, screaming ""who that?"" on the double
Serving gumbo with a shovel, dog, I'm on another level
Me and Kweli come together like two pieces of metal
We magnetizing the ghetto

Yeah, now here's the memo
I'm a rebel without a cause, a bezel without no flaws
And, shorty, you straight; bet you look way better without no drawers
Let's sweat out this alcohol; bet I'm about to ball
And never let up; look how I just crept up without applause
Fed up with all the frauds and left y'all without a job
The center of attention; this is clever; I'm Pau Gasol
Really though I'm LeBron, really don't got my mind
On this new school of rappers I will really go Columbine
And throw up the diamond sign; boy, you know I'm-a shine
Flow is in Ramadan 'cause couple years ago the game had they pajamas on
But now they on my dick; man, I should throw a condom on
'Cause a nigga coming raw like I ain't got one on
And I ain't stopping nor copping no pleas; I just lock and load, squeeze
Dog, I'm on a higher level; I'm on top of nosebleeds
Niggas say they sick, but when they rock, they don't sneeze
Like the nigga on the block waving his glock, but won't squeeze
Please

Hold your applause until the ceremony end
Yours truly, truly blessed, yet again a noble planted
Super magic, abracadabra kid
Mysterious master Jim, blacker pen, arrowhead
With the long-barrel stem and his apparel fresh
Harbor lights shining out the black power grid
With the Black Power grip, and pure power don't power trip
Push the cellar ceiling up and make the tower tip
The Gladwell point and Babylon polish
All about nothing where it's all about the dollar
And mansions on the fault line of a shaky market
The Devil at the dance hall thirsty for a partner
Get off him; there is not a parcel or a portion
Or a measure of a fortune more awesome
Gorgeous, the funky Four Horsemen and one more
With Hi-Tek on the score, once more, of course

Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

The night has a thousand eyes
And they're all on you
The night has a thousand ears
Listening to your cries
Let it work its magic
Let it work its magic
The night has a thousand eyes

Verse 1
You, you had to slip away
After all that spark
You, said all that you could say
And slipped into the dark
I could not let you go
Alone into the night
I had to let you know

The magic there, in the night air

And they're all on you

Verse 2
You, somewhere out in the dark
Runs a wounded heart
You, stumbling in the night
In the air of after light
You take along the fears
Did you waste these years,
And did they warn you
Of the night zone all alone

Sometimes it takes a fight
To keep everything on track,
And sometimes it takes a starry night
To bring the magic back
This was the time
And this was the place
With starlight on your face
And the moon on the rise,
The night has a thousand eyes

Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, same old dream

I can't hold the teardrops from my eyes
For at sundown I will lay a-dyin' 
At the door of the Fool's Paradise

Rode into this cattle town this morning 
Left my bearer to check the market price
And I walked into the nearest bar room 
They call it the Fool's Paradise

There the crowd was gay and girls were dancing
And the men were playing cards and dice
So I stepped up to the bar to join them 
What a grand place, this Fool's Paradise

It was then I showed to them your picture 
I passed it around once or twice
Then a man insulted your sweet honor 
At the bar of the Fool's Paradise

So I slapped his face and I told him,I said, 
""You eat them words, Mister, or draw, that's my advice""
And he said, ""Well somebody might get hurt inside,
But I'll be glad to meet you in the street at sundown,
At sundown in front of the Fool's Paradise""

Tesoro, lo sappiamo che piovono bocche

Hey, do you wanna show me?
Do you wanna feel this from the inside?

And I know you can't let go
You won't open up

You can't let go of your heart and soul
Hey do you wanna show me?
Do you wanna feel this from the inside?

I wanna show you
What this feels like
Come in and feel me from the inside

",The Inside,2007
Moses Mayfield,"Watch me, baby, hopeful
'Cause I feel like you could understand
And I feel like you don't belong here
And I know exactly what you mean

(You)
Send me out, send me out
You send me out of here

Hold me, don't let me fall
'Cause I've a fear being alone
And I feel like its been a long year
I wish for you to take me home

(You)
Send me out, send me out
You send me out of here

Don't let the sun go down on your anger
She would say,
""I know you've been right here all the while""
And I would stay

I'm hoping you're the one
That saw me in the moon
Somebody tell me my name
Before I leave here, soon

I find traces of hope along tears
And all the reckless reasons to hold on
I feel like falling when you rise
'Cause I I know there's no point
No reason to fight

But you send me out
Send me out, send me out
You send me out of here

You send me out
Send me out, send me out
Send me out of here

Moses Mayfield,"There's avarice in aggression
The fire it aches with perfection
I don't wanna show you anymore
You're choking on all your regrets
Your violence aches in the cement
I don't wanna show you anymore

And I'm not gonna show you how
Waiting for a sound
I don't wanna believe
In you tonight, tonight

Old mistakes that I have made
I don't want you to know
I guess I'll learn, I'll wait my turn
I'll wait my turn tonight

The open ends of addiction
Desire replaced with affliction
I don't wanna blame you anymore
With focus strong on the feeling
No room for thoughts you're concealing
I don't wanna blame you anymore

And I 'm not gonna show you how
Waiting for a sound
I don't wanna believe
In you tonight, tonight

Old mistakes that I have made
I don't want you to know
I guess I'll learn, I'll wait my turn
I'll wait my turn tonight

Tonight open your eyes
Brace yourself

Always coming back

Moses Pelham,"Selbst wenn ich Solo komm', ihr Nullen, komm' ich in dem Glauben,
Dass Rödelheim die Macht is' und ich euch zerquetsch' wie Trauben.
Fick die Tauben und Blinden, die sich Augen und Ohren verbinden,
Weil se' die Welt, wie ich se' sehen muss, nur zum Weglaufen finden.
Denn in bestimmten Situationen find' ich se' auch net' so besonders,
Aber solang' ich mich noch gegen euch wehren kann, hat se' schon was.
Und wie Congas spiel' ich euch Nullen, euch geht der Mut aus.
Ihr seid Link, aber wir sind im Recht und es sieht gut aus.

1000 Jahre sind ein Tag.
In der Welt, aus der ich herkam, in dem Leben, wie ich's mag.
Glaubt mir, wenn ich sag, dass ich mich manchmal selber frag',
Wie ich eure Art, mit mir und meinen umzugehen, ertrag'.
Doch ich schätz', es is'n bisschen mehr Weitsicht und 'n bisschen mehr Sinn
Für die Blinden und die Tauben, die nicht wissen, wer ich bin,
Denn in wenigen Tagen wird sich einiges erklären,
Und selbst die, die mich nicht ehren, werden sich nicht länger wehren.

Ich hab' gute Aussichten durch weise Voraussichten.
Ihr könnt allen ausrichten, es kommt die Zeit des Mannes mit
Guten Aussichten durch weise Voraussichten.
Ihr könnt allen ausrichten, es ist soweit.

Nur eine Hand voll guter Männer, nicht viel mehr,
Ist alles, was wir sind, doch morgen schon sind wir ein Heer.
Riesengroß, auf dem Weg zu unserem längst verdienten Thron.
Meine Worte sind die Wahrheit und versprechen keine Drohungen.
Doch die, die mich hassen, fühlen sich zu Recht bedroht,
Wenn sie nehmen und nicht geben, denn wir brauchen unser Brot.
Aus Not wächst der Widerstand, Feinde seid gewarnt,
Denn was aussieht wie ein Zufall, ist ein lang gehegter Plan.

Ich hab' gute Aussichten durch weise Voraussichten.
Ihr könnt allen ausrichten, es kommt die Zeit des Mannes mit
Guten Aussichten durch weise Voraussichten.
Ihr könnt allen ausrichten, es ist soweit.

Wenn du der bist, den ich meine, wirst du sehen,
Dass alles, was ich sag', wahr wird und verstehen,
Dass dies Bestimmung ist, ich tu' nur meine Pflicht.
Und wenn ich „ich"" sag', mein' ich nich' nur mich, sondern uns, also auch dich.
Wisch dir die Tränen von den Wangen, denn es kommt
Die Zeit der Erlösung für uns Männer an der Front.
Bald kommt die Wende, heute sind wir arm,
Doch die Armen werden reich sein, ich bin ganz sicher, wir ham' 
Extrem gute Aussichten durch weise Voraussichten.
Ihr könnt allen ausrichten, es kommt die Zeit des Mannes mit
Guten Aussichten durch weise Voraussichten.

Wenn du die Texte kennst, Credo ich lieb mich wie ich bin
Kämpf um die Existenz, Ego der Krieg hier gibt dir
Sinn
Deie reine Panik und sie packt dich, Mann
Hier ist leider gar nix außer nackter Angst
Wege zu leiden und zu hadern und uns aus Neid zu Tode zu hassen

Lass die Spacken, ich höre sie beleidigen mich
Ist alles Latte, nur dieses hier verteidige ich
Das bis aufs Blut man, ich geb' alles her
Mein Hab und Gut, aber das nie mehr

Meine Heimat ist ein Platz mit Licht in der Mitte
Aufgrund dieses Fakts habe ich mich gestritten
Was ein Fehler bleibt und ist
Denn jeder Grund für Streit ist Gegenteil des Lichts (die Dunkelheit)
Ich sag Hochwürden wie er wohnt und wo er lebt

Moses Pelham,"Kann ihr bitte jemand sagen, wie sehr ich sie lieb'?
Und, dass es hier seit Jahr und Tag nichts so herrliches gibt wie sie
Dass, was wir haben, zu tief ist
Und ich sie lieb', solang in diesen Adern Blut fließt
Ich sie schütze mit dem selben bis zum Tod
Und obwohl ich mich zurückziehe zu helfen gelob'
Mit aller Kraft und um jeden Preis
Und ich weiß, dass ich's schaff', auch wenn nur Gott den Weg weiß
Ihr müsst ihr schreiben, dass ich wenn ich keinen Weg find' ein Baum werd'
Und sagt den Heiden, dass ich leb' und für die Frau sterb'
Bitte zeigt ihr, dass es wirklich nicht mehr weit ist
Bis sie bei mir und sie in Sicherheit ist
Könnt ihr ihr sagen, wir kommen irgendwie hier durch

Und es doch jetzt bereits erhalten, dem Allmächtigen sei Dank
Sagt ihr

Wir sind eins
Wir sind eins
Wir sind eins

Sagt ihr nicht, dass wenn mir klar wird
Wo sie wohnt, jetzt ich zu zittern beginn
Und ist's auch hart, ich seit es so ist noch ein bisschen mehr trink'
Nicht wie kaputt es mich macht, das nicht unsere Sache
Wie, dass ich diese Nutte hass' und deren Umfeld verachte
Nicht wie jede ihrer Lügen mein Blut empört
Und wie es mich zu wütend macht, um weiter zuzuhören
Nicht wie es unerträglich ist, noch mehr vom Fehlen zu spüren
Sag nicht, dass wenn ich von ihr red', es mir die Kehle abschnürt
Sagt nicht, dass mir die Tränen kommen und mir die Stimme versagt
Weil mir das Leben genommen wurd' und ich immer noch da bin
Erspart ihr die Details, von denen sie besser nichts weiß
Wie schon der Name mich beleidigt und den hässlichen Scheiß
Könnt ihr ihr sagen, wir kommen irgendwie hier durch
Denn sieh, wir haben zu viel Liebe für die Furcht
Sagt ihr, die Träume tragen weit, beteuert die Erhabenheit
Und singt auf's neue, wenn sonst nichts zu sagen bleibt als

Wir sind eins
Wir sind eins
Wir sind eins
Wir sind eins

Kann ihr bitte einer sagen, dass ich Frieden nicht kenn'?
Bis ich sie in meinem Namen hab' und komm' niederzubrennen
Was uns im Weg steht, was immer uns teilt
Dass ich alles, was geht, geb', sie find' und befrei'
Dass wir etwas in uns tragen, das erst in Krisen erwacht
Und, dass die keinen Schimmer haben von unsrer Widerstandskraft
Sagt ihr, dass black foot stark sind, dass ich sehr bald da bin
Und ausmerzen werde, was auch immer ihr ein Haar krümmt
Sagt ihr, ich arbeit' auf den Tag hin, ich kann es kaum erwarten
Sagt es, ich weiß, dass sie traumatisiert ist
Aber wenn ich sie befreit hab', wieder aufatmen wird
Könnt ihr ihr sagen, wir kommen irgendwie hier durch
Denn sieh, wir haben zu viel Liebe für die Furcht
Sagt ihr, das Ziel ist so nah, ich seh's doch fast schon
Nicht mehr viel bis zum Tag unsrer Reformation, sagt ihr

Direkt aus Rödelheim

Rödelheim mein Land Ecke Clemenstraße 
Is' wo der Shit hier begann
Sollte je mal fragen 
Und vergessen da bin ich Elefant
Und was nullen darüber sprechen is für mich nich' relevant
Mir ist es Wurst was du labberst, du Hoe
Hol' mir 'n Bier, ich hab Durst, es war damals schon so
Das ist meine Liebe und wenn du sie kennst
Dann gebt ihr meine Reminiszenz (you remember)
Pendejos, von den Huren, die es hassen
Zu den Echos, hat alles seine Spuren hinterlassen
Viele sahen die miesen Posen und Kleidungen
Und hielten meine Liebe für 'ne Modeerscheinung
Für 'n Trend, für 'n Witz, für 'n Spaß
Die haben gepennt während ich schwitze, das war's
Ich blieb ihr treu toll, glaub was du willst
Aber heute freuen sich Leute schon beim Auto waschen (you remember)

Mich muss man nicht dran erinnern
Ich sehe diese anderthalb Zimmer (you remember)
Wie der Fernsehen flimmert ohne Ton, irgend 'ne Platte lief immer (you remember)
Und wenn ich mich erinner'
Hör ich plötzlich wieder diese Stimme, sie sagt

Direkt aus Rödelheim

Direkt aus dem Schoss der Familie
Weg mit dein Dreck, wir ham' sehr große Ziele 
Wir ham' gespürt das wir leben, rühten zu Tränen
Und waren bereit dafür was zu geben
Vigan, Ermich, Nego, Johnson, lieber, wenig, Ego, langsam
Guck hart rein, ist nicht nur zum Schein
Morcom, wir schlagen alles kurz und klein, Motherfucker
Dann wieder rumhängen und chillen
Von Unmengen an Depri's zu unbändigen Willen
Bitte gib mir Zettel und Stift
Homie, Gott diktiert, grade da is Rettung in Sicht 
Das ist das Gegenmittel für Negativität 
Man, wenn dieser Neger spittet sind die Hater wiederlegt 
Mit perfektionierten Worten weg vom Blödsinn und Spaß
Und zwar direkt aus diesen Ort hier in dem Goethe schon saß 

Mich muss man nicht dran erinnern
Ich sehe diese anderthalb Zimmer (you remember)
Wie der Fernsehen flimmert ohne Ton, irgend 'ne Platte lief immer (you remember)
Und wenn ich mich erinner'
Hör ich plötzlich wieder diese Stimme, sie sagt

Direkt aus Rödelheim
Und das bin ich für immer

Wir sind durchs Wasser gegangen und neben so durchs Feuer
Was wir schaften zusammen, hat das Game hier erneuert 
Scheiß auf die Bronx, Mann, ich spuck hier zum Beten
Ja, wir haben keine Chance dafür nutzen wir sie
Denn weiter kämpfen ist nicht nur ein Segen 
Aber das is' keine Band, man, das is' 'ne Bewegung 
Ende wie bei Grandmaster Flash,
Ich send und sie erkennen deshalb Message 
Das hält diese Welt hier zusammen
Und steht wie ein Fels in der Brandung 
Wir waren bereit zu tun was Wiege verlangt 
Und das geleitet mich zur Ruhe wie ein Wiegen-Gesang
Der Geist muss immer blitzen und so wühl ich in dem was ich noch weiß mit Fingerspitzengefühl
Erkenn' mein Glück, es geht um Herz, ich schreib uns dieses kleines Stück Unsterblichkeit

Jetzt auf 16 zu 9
Bruder halt kurz die Welt an
Ich dreh' noch ein Joint
Über den Wolken muss die Freiheit wohl grenzenlos sein
Die Zeit steht still wenn sie endlos erscheint
Nichts ist soweit wenn dein Schicksal dich schreibt
Auf dem Weg Richtung Glück ist nur wichtig was bleibt
Bin zur richtigen Zeit am richtigen Ort
Sieh den wolkenfreien Himmel
Werf den Stress über Bord
Gute Laune für dein Ohr
Die Nächte sind lang
Das Leben ist schön
Es lächelt mich an
Und, und, und
Ich lehn' mich zurück
Nur ein kleiner Augenblick auf dem Weg Richtung Glück",Chill Maaa,2015

Als ich's geschafft hab', wollte jeder mein Bro sein
Denn der Vorhang ging auf, es war Showtime
24/7, Dicka, wir waren so high
All eyes on me, ich war online
Mosh-3-6-1-10 mit dem Kreis drum
Eure Rapper haben eh Polizeischutz
Ich war geliebt und gehypt
Aber lernte, Erfolg ist ein Spiel mit der Zeit
Nicht viel, was mir bleibt, doch das Ziel ist nicht weit
Aber Hauptsache, ich bin mit mei'm Spiegel im Reinen
Als ich es geschafft hab', war Eskalation
Doch abgesehen vom Geld, ist der Rest wie gewohnt
Papa war erleichtert, Mama war begeistert
Dass ich mit den Jahren was erreicht hab'
Leben ist wie Fightclub, zwischen Ringen sein
Die Kingheit geht vorbei, Dicka, in time

Es geht von unten nach oben
Ja, wir bunkerten Drogen
Bald schreiben wir hunderte Strophen
Ich nehm' die Jungs mit nach oben

Oben sei es anders

Mosh36,"Ich bereu', wie oft ich meine Mum belogen hab'
Aber diese große Stadt hat uns alle so gemacht
Frag mich nicht, wie oft ich diese ganzen Frauen betrogen hab'
Und auf meinem Highway to Hell nicht abgebogen hab'
Groß gedacht, klein gehandelt, wie oft hat mich Neid verwandelt?
Könnt' ich auf Reset drücken, wär' ich heute einverstanden
Eingebrannte Bilder, die mich heute in den Schlaf verfolgen
Ein blauer, fehlerfreier Himmel wurd' zu schwarzen Wolken
Ich bereu', dass ich ein Einzelgänger bin
Denn alleine wirst du blind auf der Reise nach dem Sinn
Heute weiß ich, wer ich bin, aber leider nicht, wohin
Du müsstest nie alleine sein, aber keiner kann dich zwingen
Ich bereu' vieles, Mum und Dad haben sich getrennt
Mir war's egal, ich war da draußen und hab' nicht gekämpft
Und wenn ich ehrlich bin, bereu' ich die Tattoos
Aber jedes einzelne ist ein Kapitel in mei'm Buch

Wir zeigen Reue, verdammt, ich bereue
Ein Leben ohne Treue führt uns gradewegs ins Feuer
Wir zahlen viel zu teuer für einen Zug Richtung Nix
Aber sehen uns alle wieder auf der Route 66
Wir sehen uns auf der Route 66

Ich hab' mein Ticket für ein' Zug in Richtung Nix gehabt
Und werd' nie bereuen, dass ich die Schule weggeschmissen hab'
Dass ich es noch schaffe, hätten meine Lehrer nicht gedacht
Nicht mal meine Eltern, aber trotzdem hab' ich es gemacht
Werd' nie bereuen, wie ich dir mein Versprechen gab
Ihr seid meine Familie, ich bin mit euch bis zum letzten Tag
Seitdem du bei mir bist, seh' ich, wie der Rest versagt
Mama meint, du wärst die Richtige, und sie hat recht gehabt
Werd' nie vergessen, dass ich eines nie vergessen darf
Jede Sekunde mit euch vieren hat mich komplett gemacht
Ich werde nie bereuen, wie ich die allererste Strophe schrieb
Jeder hat gesehen, wie der Fahrstuhl bis nach oben stieg
Aus einem kleinen Traum wurde dann ein großes Ziel
Ich töte die Vergangenheit mit nur einem Projektil
Ich bereu' kein einziges Kapitel in mei'm Buch
Und brenn' mir die Erfahrung in mein Fleisch wie ein Tattoo

It would sure be nice to back home
Where there's love and affection
And just maybe I can convince time to slow up

Time be my friend

If we should believe the things that we see
Tell us should we run away, should we try and stay?
Or is better just to let things be?

Living here in this brand new world might be a fantasy
But it's taught me to love so it's real to me
And I've learned that we must look inside our hearts to find
A world full of love like yours and mine

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain

I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there

Forget it man, I can't lie 
I'm drunk as a skunk but I'm nothin' funk 
I shoots the game, the gift I spit 
The gift of gab boy, the gift is ripped 
Deal with the skill that makes ya feel it 
Those that don't wanna feel it need to kill it 
Knows that I can giddy go 
When it's time to get on the M-I-C-R-O-P-H-O-N-E 
It's me the hustler 40 
With them raggedy seperaters as if it was funky 
A brother like me don't hang around no suckers that be faulty 
I be puttin' the group up in the boot 
Be puttin' the peas up in the pod 
Left the cookies in the jar, now I'm a rap star 
The rapologist, I pull a 40 out of my ball cap 
Then I bust ya down side of this 
Cause partner ain't never been no punk in this 
I'm so serious brother, I got meals, wheels 
And about seven thousand dollars worth of bills 
Givin' up deals, hills let em' go for a lil' nothin'

Roll em' up in a zag, lick em' stick em' and clown 
I'm fully dig with a dick, my game is on hit 
I got tipped so I tip cause I'm livin' with this 
Game tight with the knack, I'm pullin' in scratch 
They better have a tight grip on they stuff cause I'm bout to snatch 
Your batch if she wants it she'll be mine in the Cutlass 
Puffin' on some of this chronic while I'm gettin' straight laced 
Heard about the drought season, they be lookin' for a reason 
It's like Thanksgiving without the feastin' 

Extra manish how I'm livin' and my name is groupie 
It's Mr. 30-30 givin' up game to all you hoochies 
Bitches always splittin' stick the wood but sometimes wouldn't 
Suckin' and grabbin' my little pecker 
Talkin' about sick on my gold better 

I remember when carts was Barbie cut before I was in junior high 
All they wanted to do is kiss and let me play with they vagina 
I got my freshen up, I put on my chucks, also down with pluck

Get juiced in the parking lot before we go up in the clubs 
Hugs and kisses, gotta make sure we got our gloves 
Hugs and kisses, E-40 can't be on any more 
Hugs and kisses, straight to the bar no time to waste 
Kickin' em' back while they take the place 
Order me a shot of that liquor to taste 
Thinkin' they about to beat my face 
Oh no, I'm nothin' but a professional 
Oh no, we're nothin' but professionals

Mostly Autumn,"Weightlessly you leave the ground
Hanging gently in the breeze,
You lift your head to face the stars
And catch the wind above the trees,
You know you're safe, you know you're there
The night sky rushing through your hair
The shadow cast across the fields
By silver moon that lights the night
Over the mountains over the hills,
The changing horizons, you drift through the valleys
Reaching for distance, floating alone,
Like an eagle at midnight, under the stars.

Through frozen eyes you see the hills
Go rolling by, your spirit fills with wonder
And the freedom to roam the winter sky,
You drift into the fragrance of the forest
Swaying gently down below.

The warm glow of a village sleeping silently,
You rise to meet the bleakness of the mountain
That roll into the distance,
A ghost upon the north wind bound for nowhere,
To meet the rising sun.",The Night Sky,1999
Mostly Autumn,"She knows what it means to be evergreen
She's seen more than some eyes will ever see
Clad with green, gracefully she reaches for winter sun
The lucky one

Spring leaves learning look to the evergreen
Carried on the breeze her tales of snow storms and icicles
With proud yarn she will spin her golden memories into stories

She looks to the sky
She's holding on to yesterday's goodbyes
Goodbye

She knows what it means to be evergreen
She knows how it feels to have loved and lost
She's seen faces change all around her, then moved on

She'll miss hearing wind through now fallen leaves
She'll stand scraping snow-filled skies alone
Her questions, if could be asked, would be left unanswered

Embrace the past, with a forward motion
No fear of looking back

Driven by engines of time

Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb

Okay
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more, ah
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go

There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now

The dream is gone

Summer evenin' birds are calling 
Summer's thunder time of year 
The sound of music in my ears 
Distant bells, new mown grass 
Smells so sweet 
By the river holding hands 
Roll me up and lay me down 
And if you sit don't make a sound 
Pick your feet up off the ground 
And if you hear as the warm night falls 
The silver sound from a time so strange 
Sing to me, sing to me 
When that fat old sun in the sky is falling 
Summer evenin' birds are calling 
Children's laughter in my ears 
The last sunlight disappears 
And if you sit don't make a sound

Mostly Autumn,"Hey you! Out there in the cold
Getting lonely, getting old, can you feel me?
Hey you! Standing in the aisles
With itchy feet and fading smiles, can you feel me?
Hey you! Don't help them to bury the light
Don't give in without a fight

Hey you! Out there on your own
Sitting naked by the phone, would you touch me?
Hey you! With your ear against the wall
Waiting for someone to call out, would you touch me?
Hey you! Would you help me to carry the stone?

Open your heart, I'm coming home

But it was only a fantasy
The wall was too high as you can see
No matter how he tried he could not break free
And the worms ate into his brain

Hey you! Out there on the road
Doing what you're told, can you help me?
Hey you! Out there beyond the wall
Breaking bottles in the hall, can you help me?
Hey you! Don't tell me there's no hope at all

Mostly Autumn,"Hopelessly passing your time in the grassland away
Only dimly aware of a certain unease in the air
You better watch out,
There may be dogs about
I've looked over Jordan, and I have seen
Things are not what they seem

What do you get for pretending the danger's not real
Meek and obedient you follow the leader
Down well trodden corridors into the valley of steel
What a surprise!

A look of terminal shock in your eyes
Now things are really what they seem
No, this is no bad dream

The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want
He makes me down to lie
Through pastures green He leadeth me the silent waters by
With bright knives He releaseth my soul

He maketh me to hang on hooks in high places
He converteth me to lamb cutlets,
For lo, He hath great power, and great hunger
When cometh the day we lowly ones,

Through quiet reflection, and great dedication
Master the art of karate,
Lo, we shall rise up,
And then we'll make the bugger's eyes water

Bleating and babbling we fell on his neck with a scream
Wave upon wave of demented avengers 
March cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream

The dogs are dead

And do as you're told
Get out of the road if you want to grow old",Sheep,2005

With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone

From sleepless Mays to Denver cold

To the blades of their design.
We are armed and ready to commit this crime.

Cause we will lose and we want to stay

The way we've been for far too long.

To the fear of death is why
The pain reminds us that we're still alive.
With our hopes on hold,
And our lack of interest exposed,
All hands damage our determined eyes.

And the red begins to creep
Its way from boredom toward apathy.

days of having lots of lies

and we used to make a smile

wrote down her a letter ""I'll shiver without you tonight""

Bodies, rest and motion fighting night and day

Hello helicopter, will you be my friend?
Will you take me away?

Hello helicopter,have you heard the news?
No one gives a shit about the things they do
We all waste and consume, destroy and ruin everything we touch
It's easy not to think when you're not told that much

I'm not saying anything you haven't heard before
I'm just trying to understand the way we are

Hello helicopter, are you lost out there?
Swimming through the garbage dump that fills the air
In several more years no one will care
They'll be rich and dead
So let somebody else devise a cure for it

Motion City Soundtrack,"I'll get lost, messed up and bored when I'm alone too long
I can't sleep, function or eat when I'm not with someone
Late last fall, she ended it all and moved to who-knows-where
Just like that, she vanished and packed and never even called

Do you feel a certain sense of synergy between yourself and me?
A kind of macabre and somber Wondertwin type of harmony
What if it was you?
You that I needed all along
I felt like a fool,
Kicking and screaming and pretending we were wrong

Let's get wrecked on pop tarts and snacks and see the Taj Mahal
Let's save birds from Prince William Sound and skateboard through the mall
Let's fight crime with mangoes and limes and join the PGA
Let's win big with every spin but hurry, I can't wait

Do you spend a fortune on those late night prepaid television scams
In search of the perfect blender, steak knife and non-stick frying pan?
What if it was you?
You that I needed all along
I felt like a fool
Thinking we were completely wrong
It seemed like a dream
A beautiful scream
That echoed forever
And made us not afraid to feel a thing

And after it ends
We'll try to be friends
They say that what doesn't kill us makes us who we are

All this time and everything's changed but I still feel the same
All good things eventually end and get washed down the drain
What a disaster it would be if you discovered that I cared
A little too much for friends but not enough to share

What if it was you?
You that I needed all along

Things happened in half-time, I'm sick of the bends
My panic research was no help
I sink into myself
Afraid of the fall that never ends
I wait, but I'm too tired to play pretend
I'll suffocate until the end

No time for halfhearted goodbyes,
I turn on the spotlight and flee from the scene
Cheap flights from Paris to Bangkok, I thought it was nonstop
Can't sleep on the KLM again
I haunt the halls of medicine at night
Choking back the urge to fight

Her cat was clawing the floorboards just outside of our door,
The panic begins
I searched the whole damn apartment from ceiling to carpet
No sign of the things she used to own
As autumn turns its back on me again
I climb the walls for oxygen

My body aches, it heaves, it shakes
All somersaults through so-called art
And I still don't know exactly who I am
I never will, amen.

She whispers something in my ear, the message is unclear
She motions outside.
I trail her closely from behind
She tries hard not to cry
She shakes underneath the pouring rain

All dressed up with some medicine for luck

Passed me by and there's nowhere you can hide
From the lessons or the lies that bind them

If there's one thing I've learned
You'll always get burned

Can we count on our conversations
to restore us like energon cubes
Made one wish for a permanent kiss
That would echo through these bones like arsenic

With all my dreams hooked to hospital machines

I've got all these thoughts just floating through my brain
They bump and they collide and cause a flurry of confusion
And it's getting on my nerves

And the atmospheric pressure's calling for rain

And the left side's all upset
Because the right side wants a summer home

I try to mediate between
This constant tug-o-war machine
But wind up in a never ending game of telephone
There's so much going on
And I just need seven minutes to calm myself back down

I'm just begging you to let me get some sleep
I've lied awake for far too long
I get so sick and tired of witnessing the dawn

As summer hangs on the horizon
Desire jumps the fence and hightails to the sea
A subtle tale turns into nightmares
Without the sentence structure 
Nothing functions, no one has a clue
If it's me or if it's you
Was it me or was it you?

As winter strangles at the shoreline
Division locks the door and confiscates the key
All freezerburn and Arctic research
The time has passed for parting glances,
There's no romance, there's no sign
Of the things that used to be
And all those things you promised me

I'm not asking you to leave
I'm just begging you to let me get some sleep

Hold it straight together, man
Hold it straight together, if you can
Little fevers wrapped in medication
All strung out on novelty
Collapse yourself and try to comprehend
An angry island, a bitter bee sting
Severing and shattering
Free the self and fix the in between
It's isolation, mark the earth around you
Guess who's on the waiting list
I'll let you in on something secret

I can disappear
Anytime I want to, time I feel you
Shuffle through my skin
I am with you til the end

First you breathe out
Then you have to breathe in
Lash yourself repeatedly
Until it sticks, until it sticks
Under the eyelids, carry on cadaver
Festering interiors
All hollow breach and vapor silhouette
Need medication, more medication
Coursing through your interstates
All mad and great, confused and counterfeit
Kamikaze, sear the blood inside me
Guess who's got it figured out
I'll let you in on something secret

I can disappear
Anytime I want to, time I feel you
Shuffle through my skin
I am with you til the end

And I can decompose
When it suits me I accelerate it
Wicked on all fours,
I surrender to the storm

Holding out for the big connection

So many things undone

Then in the middle came Motion Man
And at the end of it all it was Kutmasta Kut wit a remix 

One thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme when I was obsessed with time
All I know, time was just slipping way

And I watched it count down till the end of the day
Watched it watch me and the words that I say
The echo of the clock rhythm in my veins
I know that I didn't look out below

And I watched the time go right out the window
Trying to grab hold, trying not to watch
I wasted it all on the hands of the clock
But in the end no matter what I pretend

The journey is more important than the end or the start
And what it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of the time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

Yo one thing, one thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme to explain the due time
All I know, time to so-socialize like the host of the party

All for shake and made eye contact
Party control showing all that
Northeast, Southwest coast
Stand out the window, no opportunity to mingle

I tried to show her, if you could just sense a middle disorder
I brought you back of the thing
Like the imaginary man of your dreams
Well, you would always seem to make it worth it

A pig skin I never nerved you
You felt lever never pleather, real bringing the pleasure
By any means and means of leaving you teens
Holler for teen magazines but I tried so hard

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing I don't know how
It doesn't even matter when you look at it now
Because when I designed this rhyme I was scared of it all
Scared to fall, I hadn't even tried to crawl

And I was forced to run, with you mocking me
Stopping me, back stabbing me constantly
Remembering all those times you fought with me
Watch the clock now chop full of hypocrisy

And now your mouth wishes it could inhale
Every single little thing you said and make it expel
Every single word you sputter just to get your piece, but it really doesn't matter to me
Because from the start to the end no matter what I pretend

The journey is more important than the end or the start
And what it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of the time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard

Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
Or wasted it all just to watch you go

Dr. Octagon paramedic fetus of the East 
With priests I'm from the Church of the Operating Room 
With the strike support scalpels since the holocaust 
I do indeed in greed explore meet the patients 
Back to brooms with the nurse with the voodoo curse 
Holding up office lights standing at huge heights 
Back and forth left wing swing to North 
East and South with blood pouring down your mouth 
I come prepared with the white suit and stethoscope 
Listen to your heartbeat, delete beep beep BEEP 
Your insurance is high, but my price is cheap 
Look at the land... Blue Flowers! 
Drawing by the purple pond, in the purple pastures Blue Flowers! 
Drawing by the purple pond, yellow ink that flows Blue Flowers! 
Drawing by the pond, look, it's raining yellow 
Would you care to listen to me more? Thank you 
Holding bags on down right from the hospital 
It's a patient that's worth to keep the germs off the turf 
Cybernetic microscopes and metal antidote 
Two telescopes that magnify the size of a roach 
Three computers to cup of coffee planted with my hand and 
Astroplanets detached turn on rear foggers 
Cut the light on the kid, and turn the bright on 
Supersonic waves combine and burn as brainwaves 
I see the mascot of Evil he's not Knievel 
Shakespeare's gone don't even think about it 
Yes, as I'm going to the park, I see... Blue Flowers! 
It's raining green, by the pond Blue Flowers! 
It's totally raining green, pouring Blue Flowers! 
I smell the bees and the birds Blue Flowers! 
Different aspects of life, blue flowers

Every morning I wake up lookin' in the mirror 
I am the original black Elvis 
That's right; when you see me with my wig to the side 
Wearin' my short leather jacket 
Marilyn Monroe on my back 
I'm livin' that life 
I'm for real with this 
That's what I think about 
I like to tell my fans 

I got my shades, big rock star compared to Elvis 
Signin' autographs for rappers while girls move they pelvis 
Write songs quickly for Elton John or Lionel Richie 
Call up my butler, get clothes washed by the maid 
Ivory soap; this is clean; feel like Cascade 
I count the bills, roll to Detroit in Sedan De villes
I throw my skully on, big robe like Marvin Gaye 
Step in the front row, prime time; I move your way 
Budweiser Fest sound check, demanding more respect 
I come correct through the Metro and turn y'all petrol 
I'm up here early, bitin' donuts, sippin' on espresso 
While you sleep, I creep, gainin' ground by the week 
Ampex reels, makin' phone calls; I'm closin' deals 
I move with skill, ride through Philly streets in Cherry Hill 
I'm doin' it well, I'm doin' it swell 
Yeah

I talk swift; the rock king, black Romeo 
I pack clubs; promoters put me out in Tokyo 
Damage your area; I'm a launch a fierce missile 
I roll schools, movin' butt like I'm toilet tissue 
What is your issue? You over, man; I don't miss you 
Scottie soft, you play like Jan Van Breda Kolff 
New Jersey Nets real man; you ain't no Donald Hillman 
Bald head like Slick Watts, I run rap like Mayor Koch 
Forward your info while Tony Lou crank the Benzo 
Move out your driveway; white girls look, turn they eye away 
Jealous in fact, tryin' to rip the capes off my back 
I move with calm and potential through instrumentals 
Y'all front on BET with slum gold, drivin' rentals 
I get real dino, runnin' groups like a rhino 
Endin' careers - that's my job; yo, your rap is final 
Cancel your in-stores; your new job is moppin' floors 
Fixin' tiles, stoppin' potholes up on the roof 
You work for service 
No tips, man, I speak the truth

Flying saucers, spaceships move at warp speed 
MTV level three when I fly on BET 
Livin' astro; tell me how you feel 
One two, one two, one two 

Pull your hoods down; I bum rush your after party 
Have your manager scared, the radio station say I'm sorry 
Pack your bags; I move my luggage to the coliseum 
Infinite prime piece with statues in the rock museum 
Changin' my zones, drinkin' cocktails on cellular phones 
I tour with Anthrax through Texas with the Rolling Stones 
Booked by the agency, famous artists payin' me 
Hotels with fly room, with sneakers starin' at the moon 
Mad atmosphere, ridin' first class on British Air 
Lobster and steak while y'all back in time doin' remakes 
I'm futuristic, nine-nine to the year four thousand
I make announcements, drop skills, then I bounce with 
Fly young ladies, AMG kicks, 2000 Mercedes 
Brand new models, only seen one in Colorado 
Light green metallic in the Shark Bar eatin' salad

Step up your wildest spaceship, kid, in the Plymouth Prowler

Fuck all the laws..

What the fuck was in your mind when you rapped on that track?
Who possessed you to do that? Who programmed - that shit sound wack
Unplug your mic
You motherfuckers rap under a bunch of fuckin hype
Programmed by the company, makin somethin cheap
Vocals sound like a nigga with no dough and a promo;
makin asses out of yourselves, tryin to rap solo
Suck my dick when you see me; avoid because you want to be me
why'all niggaz write like slouches puffin blunts on studio couches
What's up you fuckin amateur?
Your engineer'll cue in your bullshit cadence
That shit sounds simple; look at this nigga rhymin to hisself
Wack as fuck, smell like shit for one buck
Big crews don't want it -- why'all get it worse
Which one of why'all motherfuckers is waitin for the mic first?
I hope your bitch is in the audience
Your wife too, that's your fanbase -- plus your DJ's in the place
I'm about to boo you, let it be fair; when you come off-stage
ninety percent of the people that came on your guest list
ain't gon' be there
A big dissapointment when I rub your asshole with a verbal ointment
Rappers actin hard, nervous in the dressin room
with a security guard
Groupies standin round with they fuckin face frowned
Lookin like fuckin Homey the Clown
Put that Spring Water down man, you ain't sweatin
You motherfuckers did a ten minute weak show and you jettin;
your fans are mad - your performance was garbage bag
Look at these videotapes
Walkin back and forth grabbin your nuts like the Planet of the Apes
Supervise it, criticize it, why'all don't realize it
where the real guys at
Who's administrating your budget when you takin 
that high picture for Right On with your ballroom light on
You know the night is kind of special like Lowenbrau
when I escort you to your car, you breakout bastards
Leave the premises and reminisce on your rookie season after you first started
You try to work hard and you never paid no dues like Cold Crush and Afrika Bambaata
You wack nigga, tryin to act large in the video in Nevada
You fuckin pink maggot; I'll take your mic, you can't have it
You niggaz be runnin around with ears open like fuckin bunny rabbits

That's right, Dr. Dooom
All you motherfuckers around the world sittin in studios with your boys
Hypin your shit up
Motherfuckers don't want to tell you that your shit is wack
because they all yes men
Sittin around, carryin your roadie cases
Bein your fuckin cheerleaders
I'ma tell you straight, look in the fuckin mirror, you wack

Some say it was suicide 
But we know 
How the story goes 

With his six string knife 
And his street wise pride 
The boy was a man before his time 
And she knew 
All their dreams would come true 

But ya see Frankie was fast 
Too fast to know 
He wouldn't go slow 
Until his lethal dose 
And she knows 
He'll finally come too close

And she knew

He's paid his dues

She always knew 
This day would come soon

With a switchblade knife

Took Frankie's life

She'd have to pull through

With a wink of an eye 
Said Suzy, listen to me

Awaited them...

My nights and days are gray
If I reached out and touched the rain
It wouldn't feel the same

Without you, I'd be lost
I'd slip down from the top
I'd slide down so low
Girl, you'd never, never know

Without you, without you
A sailor lost at sea
Without you, woman
The world comes down on me

Without you in my life
I'd slowly wilt and die
But with you by my side
You're the reason I'm alive
But with you in my life
You're the reason I'm alive
But without you, without you

Without you, there's no change
My nights and days are gray
If I reached out and touched the rain
It wouldn't feel the same

Without you, without you
I'm a sailor lost at sea
Without you, woman
The world comes down on me

Without you in my life
I'd slowly wilt and die
But with you by my side
You're the reason I'm alive
But with you in my life
You're the reason I'm alive
But without you, without you

I could face a mountain
But I could never climb alone
I could start another day
But how many, I don't know

You're the reason, the sun shines down
And the nights, they don't grow cold
Only you that I'll hold when I'm young
Only you, as we grow old

Without you in my life
I'd slowly wilt and die
But with you by my side
You're the reason I'm alive

Sleeping half the day

If I could find my own way

On a bus to go away

I close my eyes and slowly driftaway 

Never thought I'd make it 
Just from playin' my guitar 
Just a little smile 
Always shelters me from pain 
Everytime I start to slide 
I wish upon a star 
The sun comes out 
And dries up all the rain 

I'm an honest man 
Who refused the shade 
On a hot and lonely day 
I close my eyes and dream my life away 
Now I know that I can stop the rain 
Close my eyes and slowly driftaway

Hate is growing fast 
In a haze cloud of crack 
But it helps us fade away 
Some inner city queen french kisses his disease 
With one foot in the grave 
And the junkyard we call home 
Is primed and ready for another war

Too many things were said
To ever make it feel
Like yesterday did

Seasons must change
Separate paths, separate ways

Let's blame it on the rain

I'd have to write this song

Smilin' through pain
That's alright, that's okay
Let's turn the page
My friends called today
Down from L.A.
They were shooting pool all night
Sleeping half the day
They said I could crash
If I could find my own way
I told them you were leaving
On a bus to go away

That's alright, that's okay
We were two kids in love
Trying to find our way
That's alright, that's okay
Held our dreams in our hands
Let our minds run away
That's alright, that's okay
We were walkin' through some youth
Smilin' through some pain
That's alright, let's turn the page
And remember what I say girl
And it goes this way

Girl, don't go away mad
Girl, just go away
Girl, don't go away mad
Now girl, just go away, (here it go)
Don't go way mad
I don't want you mad
Come on girl
Come on baby
I said one more time
Girl, don't go away mad (don't want you mad)
Girl, just go away 
Girl, don't go away mad
