Chipmunk,"Yeah, Time to get that profit all in,
Won't rest till all my nigga's rocket ballin',
I don't even think I stopped this morning,
I'm that nigga that usually gets them 'what's them called's in,
I'm called when it's time to get the shopping sorted,
Oh this Armani blazer, which I got imported,
Yeah I like that whip, 
'Cause I'm on them grams only reason why I ain't dropped that forty,
All chicks see my on the street stop and call me,
Want me to get my willy out so they can toss it for me,
Got them going topless for me,
When she groped it for me,
Really got me horny,
Record label, contract my lawyers got them it me,
Dotted all the I's and the T's can you cross them for me?
You can try and put your crosses on me,
I watch hate, I got shooters that are watching for me.

I'm heavy, I'm colder,
Better me know, sir,
I can tear apart mc's 
But I'd rather read a book on childcare by Keri Katona,
No nice, 'cause I've run out of it,
Dumb it down a bit,
Ain't something I'm prepared to do,
Well I ain't never gonna run out of lip,
So here's something I prepared for you.
I tried to relax, but being spaced it inspires me back,
When will I be nice, to Katie Price,
The day I see a cage fighter in drag, ah,
I don't wanna tell my rhyme without friction,
Jump in to beat, both feet first,
Make pros eat their words,
And sit and watch 'em swallow their own dick-tion

Uh, Ishi distort that bass,
Man grew up on a raw estate,
Now, every time I draw my dates,
They're like 'how the fuck d'you afford this place?',
First place, first place, first place,
Try and act up and I'ma address that, call it, 
But I fuck up the man in the place,
Champagne, for goodness sake,
I ain't got a queue 'cause they know my face,
Glance at my watch tryin' to wind up on me,
I was like I ain't got time to waste,
Get it,
I ain't got time to waste
Get it,
Try and get hype in my face,
Regret it,
Got a big clipboard 
And I don't remember the last ?

Let me grieve for the beat before I murder it,
Don't know my name by now? 
You shoulda heard of it,
Why? 'cause I'm murdering,
Anybody lurking in, close proximity, circling,
Don't make an example of men when I stride in,
Dev's has got a tiny temper,
I'm observing this, learning,
But know I'm just yearning to burn it,
I'll fight your agenda,
Lock me up, might high risk offender
Make a man turn on his own team, like an Irish defender,
I'm a rhyming inventor 
That's climbing to heights ya' not meant ta',
The game's over, so roll over,
I'm sober, but I'll still kidnap a so called soldier,
In a boat I'll row into dover, 
Yeah it's over, the game's over.

Put up ya' lighters, I clash the Titans,
Fight the fighters, might fight the biters,
Spit on my flow, got tonsillitis,
That's on a Monday mornin', ha
Takin' over, run straight past ya'
No warning that I rule disaster,
Harder, faster, stronger, longer,
This one here was top of the classroom,
Stop the lecture, drop the pressure,
Never say never, but nevertheless I,
Never say no to experiments, 
Whether it's temping in scrubs yards, spitting with eloquents,
Positive syllabus, having a hell of a time and it's evident,
Don't question my relevance, 
I've started on this so I'm back in my element.

Uh, I open my mouth, bitches panic,
The jewel the liabilities, 
Mm, I'm the asset surely?
Underdogs are barking up, shh hush puppy,
My new chain's got red and blue ice man I call it my slush puppy,
Yeah, let me clap them with the reminder flow,
I was best new comer err time ago,
Yeah, you've all passed ya' sell by date to me,
I'm different,
Bitch I sell out when you at the venue and date to me.

Now it's game over,
Kick him out the team, but heard he's snaking, he's a cobra,
Could have lived the dream but now ya' days are done, it's over,
Should have remembered scheming and your looking for a shoulder, 
To lay low, to wipe your tears on, it's over.

They better let me go, let me loose,
I'm frozen cold, my veins are blue,
Hell to home but Satan prove,
Good as gold, my angels flew,
Yo, they can't knock down mine,
Cuffs on flows I lock down lines,
I am not human, real life mutant,
Ask Mick Foley, I'm not mankind,
Yeah, look under my eyelids,
All red, I bleed through the iris,
Like I've been smoking the weed, highest,
Now my brain's on freeze, minus
Yeah I ain't letting it melt,
I'm stark, haze, I'm letting it fill,
Silent this now separate that,
I stay here I ain't laying in jail, ill.",Game Over,2010
Chipmunk,"They say ""Skepta, you must get loads of girls""
The music's picked up now
Tell em like J2k, nah, it's all switched up now
She thinks that if she talks to me they'll call
Her a groupie behind her back now
So she stands far but close enough for her pictures
To have me in the background
I'm kinda used to it now
They say it's all part and parcel
And if it's this much for me
Imagine what's it's like for Curtis and Marshall
I wanna go hard
But my body keeps telling me to take it easy
So I sit here watching a DVD logo bounce around the TV
My life ended ages ago, now it's all a dream
Sitting here, thinking how this thing all started
From What D'Ya Mean, What D'Ya Mean
Now that I'm getting that paper I heard a couple man want me dead
So I went out bought a Gucci hat and put money on my own head
I forever hear people talking like I don't know about street
Fake gangstas must think I spent my music money on chocolate and sweets
You're looking for beef in London? Nah it's not hard to find it
But I'm not scared of a gun, it's all about the man behind it

You wanna make it big
You think you like what you see
You wanna make it big
You saw me go from the bottom to the top
Now you wanna be me

You wanna make it big
This famous life make people wanna wish they were 6 feet under
But not me
See when I made it big
I just wish that I knew what I know now when I was younger
Truss

Sometimes I think that I think too much
I start thinking about thinking
Then I start to get paranoid
I think my windows need tinting
They say why work all this time
To get famous Joseph
Just to wear sunglasses
Cause you don't wanna get noticed
Once in a while I take em off
And I'm like ""arrr, that's too bright""
Because I sleep all day then I wake up at night
Then I phone my girl, see if she wants to link
She said she got work in the morning
So what do I do, I go out for a drink
I spend all my time in clubs
It's starting to feel like home
I don't wanna sit in the VIP but sometimes I just wanna be left alone
I hate when I'm in a bad mood and I see all my supporters vibes'n
And I apologies to anyone I've taking a pic with when I weren't smiling
They say ""don't you remember me I met you at Party In The Park""
Babe, I can't even where I parked my car in the car park
Now she hates me and every time she hears my song she's changing the station
I swear the human brain weren't designed to deal with all this information

You still wanna make it big
You think you like what you see
You wanna make it big
You saw me go from the bottom to the top
Now you wanna be me

You wanna make it big
This famous life can make some people wish they were 6 feet under
But not me
You see when I made it big
I just wish that I knew what I know now when I was younger
Truss

Listen tomorrow isn't promised to us so
You have to enjoy today
Cause the game is like a box of roses
Cause when they're done with the chocolate
The wrapper gets thrown away
I said the wrapper gets thrown away

When you're shooting for your targets
And it's making you a target
You die before you live, I wish you warned me when I started
We're going full hearted, R.I.P the half wits
Cause now we're 6 feet under the top spot fuck a casket
Bastards, don't we make the lifestyle look appealing
Independent names and chains
Skepta are we dreaming?
Nobody could season, this track couldn't reach him
Cause now I'm on the other side of that glass ceiling
The underdogs are off the leash
Eh Joseph, pass the muzzles and the leads
The games full of demons, let's get this arm house on
Everyone wants handouts but I ain't stretch Armstrong
We've come so far as emcee's
Round of applause or bust it off just make it clap please
I'm so past just trying to be the favourite
You're nobody until you got some haters
But you still wanna make it BIG!

You wanna make it big
You think you like what you see
You wanna make it big
You saw me go from the bottom to the top
Now you wanna be me

You wanna make it big
You think you like what you see
You wanna make it big
You saw me go from the bottom to the top
Now you wanna be me",Big,2011

Some people wait there turn
Some people have to fight
Some people give it up

They wanna hold you back, tell ‘em pee off
Whenever they say you can’t, take the T off
I remember when they told me I couldn’t be famous
Now my dream and reality is simultaneous

And work your own way to the top
If they put you on a pedestal they can take you off
And there’s a higher level than the top
You gotta make more, don’t do with what you got

Yeah, so get it in go sunny

Is that the real definition of me now?
I fell off, back on my feet now
Headed to the sky, can’t even see down

Award shows, I poured my heart out
And people still steady trynna point my flaws out
And I’d be lying if I said it ain’t get to me

Couldn’t get a booking
Couldn’t get a push in when you needed a shove
Or your buttons they be pushing
So now they tryna shush him
It’s only you believing in you
They turn you into a bastard than moment you rude
Attitude a little out of tune
But thats how champions move

Chipmunk,"Yeah, from hills high in heaven
To Psalms twenty-seven
This is our gospel
Take my word for it
Uh, check, listen

You see the music business like the devil's games
If you play then you might adopt the devil's ways
It's an eye for an eye, a tooth the same
I'm tired of everybody taking shots up my name

I'm just shooting for my targets
Look if you've been shooting yourself in the foot, don't hold me hostage
Making what doesn't sell
Then you complaining when it doesn't sell

Now with that off my chest I'ma hope for the best
I'm never going back to the press though they wanna see me stress
Counting money and staying relevant
Made me know the difference between family and relatives

I beg the Lord show me a path
Snakes are in my blood line, not in my grass
Not talking to my match, cut my family in half
If you reap what you sow, let me pray my own heart
Come on

(Pray for me)
Yeah, please take me to a level, the heaven is above
(Pray for me)
Yeah, try sitting in my past so Heaven is a must

(Pray for me, yeah)
With the world on my shoulders, I bench-press the cane
(Pray for me, yeah)
You know the Lord is my Shepherd so I can't be afraid

The prayers I need them, the good in me is leaking
I'd only want this pen now so they can see Jesus
To show 'em I believe in, s***'s getting stranger
Little change of maze got them questioning my faith

My visions strange when they negatively name me
I see Lord, does that make me crazy?
Suicidal tweets, can you blame me?
Yeah, look what success did to Amy

They couldn't work out my letters so they hung me
I've been fired alive, how could you burn me?
As I stay afloat, it's titanic for rum
My confidence is made of titanium

I told everybody I'm the savior
Special like I'm born in a manger, manger
Born to succeed, who's as humble as me
As long as I got a number, I wear a heart on my sleeve
Come on

(Pray for me)
Yeah, please take me to a level, the heaven is above
(Pray for me)
Yeah, try sitting in my past so Heaven is a must

(Pray for me, yeah)
With the world on my shoulders, I bench-press the cane
(Pray for me, yeah)
You know the Lord is my Shepherd so I can't be afraid

Looking back like, look what the deal did?
Still with the same circle and I'm still with Chip
That's why who I share the last pound with
Is the same people that I share a mill with

Six zero's in my last mill with
Bread and wine, last supper was some real s***
The prayer's been sent, now we're ready
Old Judas has been removed already
Let's go

(Pray for me)
Yeah, please take me to a level, the heaven is above

Yeah, try sitting in my past so Heaven is a must

Tell my chick, don't leave me now, tell my feet, don't fail me now
It's too late I'm in front of this crowd
When you see me bow
I'll drown in my own sweat before they take me out

Take the jewels, take the fame
Take the buzz, take the name but the talent still remains
And tell the hater change of plan
I tell the label, drop me still on weeks we all run

Piss off, this ain't a big trap
This is seat for a gift wrap, I reply to every diss track
Back from the future, you plums
Fighting in advance for the apologies to come

I'm sick trust me
Eat a plate of fame of vomit, still repping for the hungry
Heads shots with success bullets
More Mobo's, Brits and Grammy's before I pull it

Believe me, the floor's tight but the jeans ain't
You can't compromise these days
I open doors into the blame frame
'Bout time I do me and get paid for it

So f*** a market and plan
I'm light skinned and I can smile, come on, market me, man
Pray for me and play your position
I evidently made a transition",Pray for Me,2011
Chipmunk,"[Chorus]
Never thought id see the day when you wasn't by my side.
Listen I was down for you girl put you first in my world
And I thought you were down too right
It's like you didn't want me to take off, take off, take off.
It's like you didn't want me to take off, take off.
But now I'm leaving.

I keep my life in a lime light, pap lights, award shows, red floors, booji bars
Yes its what I'm meant for
And we ain't quite the same as we used to be
My life's in the public eye, I know you don't want yours to be
Truthfully, 2years in its still new to me
I wouldn't say your comfortable, I would say your used to me
Hense separating doesn't seem real
They tell me chip keep the girl that you had before the deal- Chyeaah.
You can call this my reff flow, could this decision might determine how the game goes
Every time you get use me being here, I go. On that note that's my que to go.

[Chorus]

If it ain't a push forward its a slow down
It's kind of ironic that I slow down,
It's best that I go now rather than later
Before you claim I'm too busy chasing that paper -it's true talk
And to say its over there ain't no good words,
I don't think anybody breaks up on good terms
So I'ma hit the club (yep)
Get my mingle on (yep) get my single on and throw it in a single song- Chyeaah.
And you could call this my reff flow, could this decision might determine how to game goes
Every time you get used to me being here, I go. On that note that's my que to go.

[Chorus]

They always ask me if I'm single in interviews
I was too scared to say I'm into you. moving like a single dude
Didn't ever lie but I skipped the truth
Its past breaks now, fuck it- interlude.
On my own feeling like I've got a point to prove
Hungry but I don't wanna have my cake and eat it too
And it's not that I ain't feelin you
I'm leaving us, I ain't leaving you
And you call this my reff flow , could this decision might determine how the game goes
Every time you get used to me being here, I go. On that note that's my que to go.",Take Off,2011
Chipmunk,"Yeah,
Yeah,
Whats he gonna say?

You wanna be like me son get a change of plan,
I don't hardly see my dawgs, get a hand, pick ma fam
Confused, feelin' used, tryin' to rearrange plans,
'Cause I've got a Rolex but no time on my hands, 
Made a transition from a boy into a man,
Step one never mix ya business and fam,
Haters say I changed,
But I can't disagree,
'Cause the figures damn Skippy ain't the same in the bank, and I just wanna say thanks,
To those tryin' to pull me down,
I was born to be fly I don't like the ground, so don't tell me stay grounded,
I'm good in my town,
And when I was blue you just went around.
I shouldn't know stress at my age,
Money came around me then everybody changed,
Fools say they know me from ya dawgs, 
Stop tryin' to call me by my government name

'Cause it's all chipmunk now,
You can blow after,
It's Chipmunk now,
It's Chipmunk's time,
Chipmunk's in his prime,
And only Chipmunk can take Chipmunk's shine!

I made a transition,
I made a transition.
You can say I made a transition.

I'm feelin' like I found myself but lost my mind,
They wanna take my life I take my time,
I'm hair and flesh but lost my life my privacy went up in the sky,
When I signed I,
Grinned to six figures then I grin teeth airing all the tag alongs like bring me,
I never breaded no one when I was working,
So hate me if you want but don't say I don't deserve it,
Understand the position I played then,
Understand the transition I made then, go and picture me back in the days then,
Look at me now and get mad,
They just wanna get fly although now I'm jet lagged,
Now everybody step back,
I'm on the next ting,
It's not a bless ting,
They're number two,
I'm on some next shit,
First place that's the first base, suicide that's the worst case,
That's when you're whole life time is tryin' to get your dough up,
And then you blow up and blow up,
No escalators, stairs, and I'm still tryin' to step up,
But I think it's tryin' to handle the pressure,
I can't let the game slip away,
When the UK roots for my name,
Shame 

It's all Mr. Monk now,
You can blow after,
It's Mr. Monk now,
It's Mr. Monks Time,
Mr. Monks in his prime,
And only Mr. Monk can take Mr. Monk's shine! 

'Cause it's all chipmunk now,
You can blow after,
It's Chipmunk now,
It's Chipmunk's time,
Chipmunk's in his prime,
And only Chipmunk can take Chipmunk's shine!

I made a transition,
I made a transition,
You can say I made a transition. 

Being successful, that's a gift and a curse,
Being paid or being broke I know what's worse,
And people at the bottom say that,
You forgot your roots but,
That's always the case when you rise from the dirt,
And preparation is the key to elevation,
But them man are too busy hating debating,
If I sound better on some grime shit,
Half of them don't even know what grime is,
It's all timing, even though I blew quicker than your average,
I came through slicker than your average,
'Cause yeah I'm not you're average spitter,
Any tempo or instrumental,
Flows mentors straight jacket worthy, conspiracy they put in to merk me,
If I'm not fire how could you burn me,
Insultin' how could you out me,
I'm so truth how could you doubt me,
Allow me. 

'Cause it's all me now,
You can blow after,
It's all me now,
It's all me time,
It's all me in my prime,
And only I can take my shine!

Que tiemblo a su lado y hasta me sonrojo
Que ella es el motivo que a mi amor despierta

Que en mis noches tristes desiertas de sueño
En loco deseo me siento su dueño

No se da ni cuenta que ya la he gozado
Porque ha sido mía sin haberla amado
Que es su alma fría la que me atormenta
Que ve que me muero y no se da cuenta

Cerrado nunca

Se que pude ver yo echo mas por ti

In their rendition of 'The Cell Block Tango'

Pop! Six! Squish! Uh uh, Cicero, Lipschitz!
Pop! Six! Squish! Uh uh, Cicero, Lipschitz!

He had it coming, he had it coming
He only had himself to blame
If you'd have been there, if you'd have seen it
I betcha you would have done the same

Pop! Six! Squish! Uh Uh, Cicero, Lipschitz!

You know how people have these little habits
That get you down like Ernie
Ernie like to chew gum, no, not chew, Pop

Like, I come home this one day and there's Ernie
Layin' on the couch chewin', no, not chewin', poppin'
So, I said to him, I said
""Ernie, you pop that gum one more time"" and he did

So I took the shotgun off the wall
And I fired two warning shots into his head

He had it coming, he had it coming
He only had himself to blame

I met Ezekiel Young from Salt Lake city about two years ago
And he told me he was single and we hit it off right away
So, we started living together

He'd go to work, he'd come home, I'd fix him a drink, we'd have dinner.
Then I found out, single, my ass
Not only was he married, well, he had six wives
One of those Mormons, you know

So that night, when he came home
I fixed him his drink as usual
You know, some guys just can't hold their arsenic

He had it coming, he had it coming
He took a flower in its prime
And then he used it and he abused it
It was a murder but not a crime

Now, I'm standing in the kitchen
Carvin' up the chicken for dinner
And in storms my husband Wilbrin in a jealous rage
""You been screwin' the milkman""

He says and he kept sayin'
""You been screwin the milkman""
Then he ran into my knife
He ran into my knife ten times

If you'd have been there, if you'd have seen it
I betcha you would have done the same

Mit kersek, en itt? Azt mondjok, hogy a hires
Lakem lefogta a ferjemet en meg lecsaptam a fejet
De nem igaz, en artatlan vagyok
Nem tudom mert mondja Uncle Sam hogy en tettem
Probaltam a rendorsegen megmayarazni de nem ertettek meg

But did you do it?
Uh uh, not guilty

My sister, Veronica and I had this double act
And my husband, Charlie traveled around with us
With the last number in our act
We did 20 acrobatic tricks in our world

One two three four five, splits, spread eagles
Flip flops, back flips, one right after the other
Well, this one night we were in Cicero

The three of us, we were in this hotel room
Boozin' and havin' a few laughs and we ran out of ice
So I went out to get some

I come back, open the door
There's Veronica and Charlie
Doing number seventeen, the spread eagle

Well, I was in such a state of shock, I completely blacked out
I can't remember a thing, it wasn't until later
When I was washing the blood off my hands
I even knew they were dead

They had it coming, they had it coming
They had it coming all along
I didn't do it, in spite if I'd done it
How could you tell me that I was wrong?

I loved Alvin Lipschitz, he was a real artistic guy, sensitive, a painter
But he was always trying to find himself
He go out every night looking for himself
And on the way, he found Ruth, Gladys, Rosemary and Irving

I guess you can say we broke up because of artistic differences
He saw himself as alive and I saw him dead

The dirty bum, bum, bum, bum, bum
The dirty bum, bum, bum, bum, bum

They had it comin', they had it comin'
They had it comin' all along
'Cause if they used us and they abused us
How could they tell us that we were wrong?

He had it coming, he had it coming
He only had himself to blame

My sister and I were headed straight fo the top
My sister and I earned a thou a week at least
Oh, sure!
But my sister is now, unfortunately, deceased

Oh, I know it's sad, of course
But a fact is still a fact
And now all that remains
Is the remains

Roxie, do you know you are exactly the same
Size as my sister? oh, you would fit in her wardrobe

Then she'd (Saxophone!)
Then we'd (Together!)

She'd say,""what's your sister like? ""
I'd say, ""men,""
Yuk, yuk, yuk
She'd say, ""you're the cat's meow""
Then we'd wow the crowd again
When she'd go
I'd go
We'd go

And then those ding-dong daddies started to roar
Whistled, stomped and stamped on the floor
Yelling, sreaming, begging for more.

And we'd say, ""o.k. fellas, keep your socks up.
You ain't seen nothin' yet!""

But I simply cannot do it alone!

Well? what did ya' think? come on, you can say.

O.k., o.k. the first part can always be rewritten.
But the second part was really nifty. watch this.

Then she'd (See, get it, right?)
Then I'd (Then I'd kick really high)
Then we'd,
But I can't do it alone!
She'd say, ""what state's chicago in?""
I'd say, ""ill!""
Did ya' get that?
She'd say, ""turn your motor off""
I can hear 'em cheerin' still
When she'd go,
I'd go,
We'd go (Sideways!)
And then those two-bit johnnies did it up brown
To cheer the best attraction in town
They nearly tore the balcony down

And we'd say. ""o.k. fellas, o.k.,
We're goin' home, but here's a few more partin' shots!""
And this, this we did in perfect unison.

Now, you've seen me goin' through it
It may seem there's nothin' to it
But I simply cannot do it
Alone!

All alone and shaking with fright
With her brand new hubby nowhere in sight

Chitãozinho,"Quanto o tempo o coração, leva pra saber
Que o sinônimo de amar é sofrer
No aroma de amores pode haver espinhos
É como ter mulheres e milhões e ser sozinho
Na solidão de casa, descansar
O sentido da vida, encontrar
Quem pode dizer onde a felicidade está
O amor é feito de paixões
E quando perde a razão

Não sabe quem vai machucar
Quem ama nunca sente medo
De contar o seu segredo
Sinônimo de amor é amar
Quem revelará o mistério que tem a fé
E quantos segredos traz o coração de uma mulher
Como é triste a tristeza mendigando um sorriso
Um cego procurando a luz na imensidão do paraíso

Quem na fraqueza sabe ser bem mais forte

Do amigo Chico Mineiro
Das viage que nois fazia
Era ele meu companheiro

Sinto uma tristeza
Uma vontade de chorar
Alembrando daqueles tempos
Que não mais há de voltar

Apesar de eu ser patrão
Eu tinha no coração
O amigo Chico Mineiro
Caboclo bom decidido
Na viola era dolorido e era o peão dos boiadeiro

Hoje porém com tristeza
Recordando das proeza
Da nossa viage motin

Viajemo mais de dez anos
Vendendo boiada e comprando
Por esse rincão sem fim

Caboclo de nada temia
Mas porém, chegou um dia
Que Chico apartou-se de mim

Fizemos a última viagem
Foi lá pro sertão de Goiás
Fui eu e o Chico Mineiro
Também foi o capataz

Viajamos muitos dias
Pra chegar em Ouro Fino
Aonde nós passemo a noite
Numa festa do Divino

A festa tava tão boa
Mas antes não tivesse ido
O Chico foi baleado
Por um homem desconhecido

Larguei de comprar boiada
Mataram meu companheiro
Acabou-se o som da viola
Acabou-se o Chico Mineiro

Despois daquela tragédia
Fiquei mais aborrecido
Não sabia da nossa amizade
Porque nois dois era unido

Me cortou meu coração
Vim saber que o Chico Mineiro
Era meu legítimo irmão",Chico Mineiro,2006
Chitãozinho,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

And did it my way",A  Minha Vida (Comme D Habitude) (My Way),2006

Ironia nos olhares
Sei que falam de nós dois
O medo me desperta, é madrugada
Você dorme sossegada

Eu não durmo mais, depois
Fico imaginando, na cidade
Quem terá a felicidade
De me substituir
Sinto um calafrio se imagino
Outro alguém te possuindo
Minha vida a me trair

Será que eu sou
Capaz de ver e suportar sua partida
Será que eu sou
Tão forte assim
Pra não morrer na despedida
Só sei que vou
Dizer te amo, a cada dia que amanheça
E vão passar, dez vidas mais
Antes amor, que eu te esqueça

Quanta chance, eu tive de falar
Todo o dia te lembrar
Quanto, quanto eu te queria
Mais a gente nunca sabe bem
A joia rara que se tem
Se é real ou fantasia

Cuide bem o ano inteiro
É preciso dar valor

Corre o risco de um vizinho

Faz de conta que não vai embora
De nós dois quem vai chorar
Ninguém vai poder dizer agora
Amanhã é outro dia
E quem tem essa mania de amar igual a mim
Por maior que seja a queda
No amor jamais se entrega quando chega ao fim

Não vou dizer
Que a tua ausência não vai machucar
Que não vou morrer um pouco ao te perder
Que esse teu adeus não vai me derrubar
Prefiro assim do que ter você aqui nos braços meus
Sonhando com alguém que não sou eu
Amando o que não sou
Querendo outro em meu lugar

Deixe tudo como está
Não precisa arrumar a casa
Vai sem pressa de voltar

Corta as Campinas

Nas lindas lagoas de águas cristalinas

Onde tinham danças e lindas meninas

Estou contrariado, mas não derrotado
Eu sou bem guiado pelas
Mãos divinas

Pra minha mãezinha já telegrafei
E já me cansei de tanto sofrer
Nesta madrugada estarei de partida
Pra terra querida que me viu nascer
Já ouço sonhando o galo cantando
O nhambu piando no escurecer
A lua prateada clareando as estradas
A relva molhada desde o anoitecer

Tenho uma guaiaca ainda perfeita
Caprichada e feita só de couro cru
Do lampião quebrado só resta o pavio

Pra lembrar o frio eu também guardei
Um pelego branco que perdeu o pêlo
Apesar do zelo com que eu cuidei
Também um cachimbo de canudo longo
Quantos pernilongos com ele espantei
Um estribo esquerdo que guardo com jeito
Porque o direito na cerca eu quebrei

Que eu mesmo comprei
Lá em soledade na casa da cinta
Duzentos e trinta na hora paguei

Primeiro ordenado que eu faturei
É a minha tráia num saco amarrado
Num canto encostado que eu sempre guardei

Pra mim representa um belo passado
A lida de gado que eu sempre gostei
Assim enfrentei esse trabalho duro
Que fiz meu futuro sem violar a lei

Se a felicidade não me acompanhar
Adeus, paulistinha do meu coração
Lá pro meu sertão, eu quero voltar
Ver a madrugada, quando a passarada
Fazendo alvorada, começa a cantar
Com satisfação, arreio o burrão
Cortando estradão, saio a galopar
E vou escutando o gado berrando
Sabiá cantando no jequitibá

Por Nossa Senhora
Meu sertão querido
Vivo arrependido por ter deixado
Esta nova vida aqui na cidade
De tanta saudade, eu tenho chorado
Aqui tem alguém, diz
Que me quer bem
Mas não me convém
Eu tenho pensado
Eu fico com pena, mas esta morena
Não sabe o sistema que eu fui criado
To aqui cantando, de longe escutando
Alguém está chorando
Com rádio ligado

Que saudade imensa do
Campo e do mato
Do manso regato que
Corta as Campinas
Aos domingos ia passear de canoa
Nas lindas lagoas de águas cristalinas
Que doce lembrança
Daquelas festanças
Onde tinham danças e lindas meninas
Eu vivo hoje em dia sem Ter alegria
O mundo judia, mas também ensina
Estou contrariado, mas não derrotado
Eu sou bem guiado pelas
Mãos divinas

Pra minha mãezinha já telegrafei
E já me cansei de tanto sofrer
Nesta madrugada estarei de partida
Pra terra querida que me viu nascer
Já ouço sonhando o galo cantando
O inhambu piando no escurecer
A lua prateada clareando as estradas
A relva molhada desde o anoitecer
Eu preciso ir pra ver tudo ali
Foi lá que nasci, lá quero morrer",Saudade Da Minha Terra,

And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop the pain tonight

I remember you
The best friend of the girl I dated
I'm the guy that you forgot you hated
Let's see what's going on

She moved to Montreal
And found religion with some creepy pastor
If you see her could you maybe ask her
About my Vuarnet shirt?

We had lots of fun while you grimaced from the sides
We got good at love and you got good at rolling your eyes
Could it be Christine
They removed more than your spleen

I think of her a lot
I wonder if she thinks about me
Is there a chance that we could remake history?
Well you say probably not

Well that's not too surprising
You thought I knocked her up
But it ain't just me that's bad at swimming
You got a lot of stuff to lose by winning
So you don't even try

We had lots of fun while you grimaced from the sides
We got good at love and you got good at rolling your eyes
Could it be Christine
They removed more than your spleen

Somewhere beyond the sea
Somewhere waiting for me
My lover stands on golden sands
And watches the ships that go sailing

Somewhere beyond the sea
He's there watching for me
If I could fly like birds on high
Then straight to his arms I'd go sailing

It's far beyond the stars
It's near beyond the moon
I know beyond a doubt
My heart will lead me there soon

We'll meet beyond the shore
We'll kiss just like before
Happy we will be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailing

At the hour of half past eight

Brushing her hair in the broad daylight
First she tossed it, then she brushed it
On her lap was a silver comb

Catching a moth in a golden net
When she saw me, then she fled me
Lifting her petticoat over her knee

The women in the meadow making hay,
Just to sit beside the turf fire in a cabin,
And watch the barefoot gosoons as they play.

Are perfumed by the heather as they blow,
And the women in the uplands digging praties,

And they scorned us just for being what we are,
But they might as well go chasin' after moon beams,
Or light a penny candle from a star.

And faith somehow I'm sure there's gonna be,

Eighteen ninety-two,
They opened Ellis Island and they let
The people through.

Of that isle of hope and tears,
Was Annie Moore from Ireland
Who was all of fifteen years.

Isle of hope, isle of tears,
Isle of freedom, isle of fears,
But it's not the isle you left behind.
That isle of hunger, isle of pain,
Isle you'll never see again
But the isle of home is always on your mind.

In a little bag she carried
All her past and history,
And her dreams for the future
In the land of liberty.
And courage is the passport
When your old world disappears
But there's no future in the past
When you're fifteen years

When they closed down Ellis Island
In nineteen forty-three,
Seventeen million people
Had come there for sanctuary.
And in springtime when I came here
And I stepped onto it's piers,
I thought of how it must have been
When you're fifteen years.

Chloé,"Sailing, sailing

Somewhere beyond the sea
Somewhere waiting for me
My lover stands on golden sands
And watches the ships that go sailing

Somewhere beyond the sea
He's there watching for me
If I could fly like birds on high
Then straight to his arms I'd go sailing

It's far beyond the stars
It's near beyond the moon
I know beyond a doubt
My heart will lead me there soon

We'll meet beyond the shore
We'll kiss just like before
Happy we will be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailing

Sailing...

We'll meet, I know we'll meet beyond the shore
We'll kiss just as before

Chloe,"Why are we fighting
Why are we lying
Maybe god come and help me out
But he can't see the damned in this crowd

Did I loose it all
How did I miss the call
Conform me to an image of a doll
Break me up against his wall

I can't look in the mirror
And see myself standing there
All I see is an illusion
Fighting a war against the ones that care
No need for saving just set me free

Can you please forgive me
Words can't say the makings
Buildings crumble down under
And lovers crash at the sound of thunder

I once believed
Honesty was key
But I can't stay and live this way
'Cause every time I stand you take it away

I can't look in the mirror
And see myself standing there
All I see is an illusion
Fighting a war against the ones that care
No need for saving just set me free 

Once I was young now I'm old
To see the truth that hides in me

I can't look in the mirror
And see myself standing there
All I see is an illusion
Fighting a war against the ones that care
No need for saving just set me free

Calling from somewhere
Sometimes it is loud and clear

I am calling you

Sometimes it is in desire
Or in the love we fear
When the call is calling us
'Till the fear will disappear

When we have no dance to dance
The call is in the song
When we have no voice to sing

Open your arms

Hiding it's guiding light, high
Heaven and earth do sleep, still in the dark so deep
I will the darkness sweep

I will the moon to flight, I will the heaven's bright
I will the earth to light
Open your eyes with me, see paradise with me
Awake and arise with me

I am the dawn, I'm the new day begun
I bring you the morning, I bring you the sun
I hold back the night and I open the skies
I give light to the world, I give sight to your eyes

From the first of all time, until time is undone
Forever and ever and ever and ever
And I am the dawn and the sky and the sun
I am one with the one and I am the dawn

Chloë,"
Ahhhhhhhh - (repeats/chorus)

When the light begins to fade,
And shadows fall across the sea,
One bright star in the evening sky,
Your love's light leads me on my way.

There's a dream that will not sleep,
A burning hope that will not die.
So I must go now with the wind,
And leave you waiting on the tide.

Time to fly, time to touch the sky.
One voice alone - a haunting cry.
One song, one star burning bright,
Let it carry me through darkest night.

Rain comes over the grey hills,
And on the air, a soft goodbye.
Hear the song that I sing to you,
When the time has come to fly.

When I leave and take the wing,
And find the land that fate will bring,
The brightest star in the evening sky,
(Is your love far from me)
Is your love waiting far for me.

(oh)Is your love waiting far from me....

We'll find a way of forgiving

We'll kiss just like before

Chloë Agnew,"Sleigh bells ring, are you listening,
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
We're happy tonight,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is the new bird
He sings a love song,
As we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town.

Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,
The plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
Until the other kids knock him down.

No crib for His bed
The little Lord Jesus
Laid down His sweet head

The stars in the bright sky
Looked down where He lay

Asleep on the hay

The cattle are lowing
The Baby awakes
A little Lord Jesus
No crying He makes

I love Thee, Lord Jesus
Look down from the sky
And stay by my side,
'Til morning is nigh.

Be near me, Lord Jesus,
I ask Thee to stay
Close by me forever
And love me I pray

In Thy tender care
And take us to heaven
To live with Thee there",Away in a Manger,2012

That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now am found
T'was blind but now I see

T'was Grace that taught my heart to fear
And Grace, my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers, toils and snares
We have already come.
T'was grace that brought us safe thus far
And grace will lead us home,
And grace will lead us home

That saved a wretch like me

One day, me no even talking to you
Next day, watch me call ya
One minute, you hit me

Esperando que vuelvas
No dudes en regresar amor
Dejo abierta la puerta

No, no, no puedo engañar mi corazón
Las mentiras no le hacen bien
Y ahora no se sabe que es peor
Si mentirle o confesarle

Que desde el día en que te fuiste
Mi teléfono jamás sonó
Esperaba una llamada
Pero veo que no te alcanzo

Y desde el día en que te fuiste
No he vuelto a escuchar tu voz
Esperaba a que llamarás
Pero veo que no te alcanzo

Recostado en mi cama, el celular sonó
A darme la última llamada, cual, la de tu adiós
Me sorprendí al ver tus maletas en la puerta
Y las frases que me decías, para irte de vuelta

A otra casa, cambiando el rumbo nuestro destino
Sabiendo que tu y yo seguíamos el mismo camino
En otra ocasión, otro corazón, en otra relación
Buscando una excusa para enmendar mi error

Creo que ya perdí el camino
No se si seguirte o regresar
Ya no se quien soy
La distancia me va a matar

No, no, no puedo engañar mi corazón

Queriendo escucharte por última vez

Que me diga Goyo, aquí esta tu vieja

Libre como el viento, como el pensamiento
Porque lo que escribo, de verdad lo siento

Dale un poco de agua, a los muchachitos
Para que no se atranquen con el plátano frito
Que prueben un poco, de otros sabores
Para que no se asusten cuando vean otros colores

Y un pedazo de queso, que conozcan lo rico

Tampoco haber estudiado 7 años en Francia
Para aprender sobre la tolerancia

Seria un asunto fácil
Y que aunque fuera de dos
Disfrutaría ambas partes por igual

Pero nadie quiere pagar pasaje

Pero que tal sera el aterrizaje

Anda solo dame un pedacito
Un poquitico de alegría, siempre hay una razón

Aun funciona el avión, aun funciona el avión
Que se acabe la gasolina
Aun funciona el avión, aun funciona el avión

Todos quieren volar bastante alto
Pero no quieren pagar por hacerlo
Tuti, así se siente el amor
Tuti, caricias loca pasión

Un pedacito solo pon de tu parte
Que la turbulencia no valla asustarte
Voy a apretar, al intentar
Como en la pista tu puedes bailar

No se venden pedazos de amor
Nisiquiera en cajas especiales
No hay tiendas de felicidad
Tampoco existen centros comerciales

Ponte de pie, mueve la cintura
Sacude, como debe ser
Para que suene este ritmo de cora

De donde lo sacaste, pregúntale al rolan

Heredado por maestros mi pana

Toda la semana, en cualquier horario
Con funki, ragga, salsa papa
Prendiendo la gozadera, ya esta!

Traiga la tambora, el timbal, la campana
Tarro para los socios, silla para las damas
Todos conectados al compas de lo que suena
Vamos a montar su bunde y sin ninguna pena

Que el ritmo no pare, gozalo

Hay bestias al lado mío
Me acompañas todo el tiempo
Siempre caminas conmigo
Pensar en ti me libera
Y me hace ver el futuro
Me hace amarte con locura
Y que me sienta seguro

Me quedaré a tú lado por siempre, lo juro
Eres mí pasado, mí presente y mí futuro
Un amor tan fuerte que atraviesa barreras y muros
Lo que siento por ti es lo más puro

Es que por ti yo estoy dispuesto a cambiar lo que quieras
Que tengamos una vida casera
Crucemos juntos mares y barreras
Solo para verte feliz

Y es que por ti yo estoy dispuesta a enfrentarme a mil fieras
Levantarte si algún día cayeras
Hacer eterna la primavera
Solo para verte feliz

				",Flagrant,
Choclair,"Um, for all these wild niggas (um, yeah)
Some bullshitters, know what I'm saying (yeah)
Straight runnin' wild (realize) doing their thang, yeah
For all those Nino Brown niggas (yeah)
John Gotti niggas, know what I'm saying (yeah)
Niggas trying to run shit (trying to run the game)
Don't know (Don't know)
It's all a game

Yo, it's like night life, ball fights, brothers getting sliced
Lay niggas, up on the floor, for people acting hardcore (yeah)
And others caught in the crossfire, and dying at age young
They leave .em by their loved ones
People wondering, Toronto Sunday saying, we acting like some savages (savages)
People acting it, pulling triggers and they stabbing kids (stabbing kids)
They pose as bad boys up in club scenes
Keep the grill screwed, leaving blood stains on blue jeans
Then Po-Po, rushes through the entrance, he hits the exits
Hops into his act, wheels spinning on some next shit 
Now we got our G-stripes, bragging rights
Little kids with no direction, look at him right
Cause he got my car to style, Medina robber style
Yeah, he bad now, but remember, what comes around, goes around
(Shh) Who be blind to the future
You need to understand
You need to understand, my man
(Yeah!)

[Chorus]
Peoples get themselves caught up, and then shot up
Bucked to the head for all the shit they done brought up
The situation, got them iller than an AIDS patient
Wild niggas, who be acting like they free-pacing

Now, as time goes by
He's looking out his window, see some people outside
With dark clothes and dark shades
And all around is pure clouds packing rain
He calls his man Jermaine, and tells him that
Shit's going down and meet him at his home, he packs a 4-pound (4-pound)
He waits around, with the sweat dripping from his brow
Where the law be now, nervousness has his head swinging side-to-side
Checks the door, he's see his man up in the ride
He's rolling outside, first looking all around
The sniper fire from the roof, it makes him drop and hit the ground
He makes a mad dash to the car door
Tells his man to move, he slams the pedal on the car floor
Now bullet-proof windows, they be reflecting it
Now he's thinking back up to the party, he's regretting it
But he's deep in it, and there's nothing he can do, but to call his boo
Who be at home, taking care of his one year old 
He says, situation's thick, there's niggas after me
It ain't no stopping them, until they capping me (naw)
Hold the fort down, I.ll be aight, I.ll give you a call in the morn
She says there's two up on my floor, with one kicking down my door
He calls his man Nick, to check the situation (situation)
When he arrives all he sees is an assassination (assassination)
And when they one step ahead, so now an ambush is in the waiting
Understand, you need to understand, my man
(You need to recognize and realize, boy!)

[Chorus: x2]

Now there's vengeance on the mind, time for him to take back what's stolen
He tells Jermaine to meet him at the docks
At 5 o.clock, keep the glocks cocked
I got the blueprints, to run up on these niggas (Word up dog!)
So when the time comes for them to meet
He sees the car, but finds Jermaine slumped in the driver seat (what to do)
People cut themselves off of him, cause if they down they be shot too
His mother's in the rage, face on the front page
Now the man's after him, the clan's after him, mob's after him
He's still at damage son, last thought's killing (uh)
The only thought in his head, now to do is run
Buys his ticket at the International pier son
Not, knowing that there's man
Standing behind .em with, 9-millimeters in hand (He turns around to his surprise)
Feels the burning on the inside, cold on the outside
And the people did the shooting, got away up with his life-time (Ah-yo)

[Chorus: x3]

(You fucking with your life boy)
Yeah, (uh-uh) wild niggas (uh-uh, wild niggas)
You fucking with your life boy 
(You fucking with your life boy)
Uh, You fucking with your life boy
Uh

[Chorus]",Situation 9,1999
Choclair,"Yes sir
When the man wanted to ride, what did he do?
Swing down sweet chariot
He told that sweet chariot to swing on down

And stop, you know what I'm sayin'
So he could get on
Now this is what we do
We playin' we playin' the role of that sweet chariot

And we swingin' down to pick you up
Know what Iim sayin'?
Ridin', for real
Now, it's like, you want to ride with me

You don't even know what ride is, look
If you want to get clean, you want to get dirty
You want to go left, right
This what we do

Well it's the Nocka, The Chiz Rocker
Party while I'm wine drinkin'
My rhymes will bust a hole right through your thinker
Forget your strategies when you battle

International record sales
People try, but they fail
It's the Chizzo, or the Choco
Surround my street like a blocko

Before the shots ring out
People never seen or even heard
But we ran through your HQ's
Like a pack of germs, people swerve from the gamer

Suave player, I'm all black like the Raiders
You wonder how I did it, album anticipated
Well it's the ninth inning
With two outs I hit a home run to left field like Carter did to Philly

Do you understand me? Ha, really?
No MacGyver tactics can stop my theatrics
I'm making ladies back flip
Understand it's all about the sexual heating up your set like it's tropical

Stop it, my UV's will burn your skin, singe your optics
Twenty One years was ground work
People hear me coming, so haters got mad work
But understand it's all about the suave, diggy-dog
Just ride

If you feelin' my vibe then we can all just (Ride)
If you want to get down then we can all just (Ride)
All my people throw your hands up high and just (Ride)
Where you from? Eastside to Westside just (Ride)
All my people from uptown to downtown just (Ride)
From Cali to NY, you know we gon' just (Ride)
From the Florida Keys to BP just (Ride)
All my people worldwide, how you feel, just (Ride)

You see, I flow like an 850, the turbo
Down the lake shore with po-po chasing
Then you be wastin' your time (Swing down sweet chariot, stop)

If you try to check for flaws
'Cause if you bet against Chizz-nocks
Count your loss
See I don't care what you think or say

What you do, I got a crew that run up in your HQ
Dissed by who, six foot one, sleepy eyed
Dark skinned glasses reflecting from the sun, nigga
Check that poster, I lay your girl down like a coaster

Drop my glass, slap that ass
Don't care about a thing
See it's all about the way Chocs makes the bells ring
People talkin' shit but can't do a damn thing

So understand this, it's all about the lyricist
No one can rock a beat just like I
Borough Side representer, see-H the I-Z
Knows how to ride, understand?
Just ride

All my peoples on lock down, you know we can (Ride)
All my peoples on the corner hustlin' just (Ride)
All my girls in tight skirts, you know we gon' just (Ride)
All my people pushin' fat rides with illy rims just (Ride)
If you can feelin' the vibe, then we can all just (Ride)
All my dames in sexy belly chains just (Ride)
All my people from the T-dot O, just (Ride)
All my peoples worldwide, how you feel? just (Ride)

See I like the chiquitas light and dark skinned
Me, I love Senoritas, that's where my hearts been
Now I be chillin' with my boys Paranorm'
Having freaks in the living room suckin' it hard

See I don't care what you think, nigga
Yo, I'm laughing at your bitch-ass
So niggas mind you speech when you talk
All these people gettin' mad and vexed

Sayin' all I talk 'bout sex
Make a fuss 'cause they nuts don't bust
So understand who I is (who you is)
I got an SDS smile, with your girl's got an ass like an E-class

I can drive it like a five-speed, stick shift
Understand the ill shit that I possess, nothin' less
If you stress, you be left blind, so read it up in brail
Hard rock's coming but they always come frail

Collaboration produced by Kardinal
Now if you want to ride, everybody needs to understand
Just ride

All my Paranormal people, how you feel, just (Ride)
All my FOS people how you feel, just (Ride)
All my Circle mother fuckers, are you gonna just (Ride)
All my peoples on Knee-deep, you know we just (Ride)
All my peoples on the hill, how you feel, just (Ride)
All my peoples in Hilltop, you know we gon' just (Ride)
All my peoples from Rexdale, you know we gon' just (Ride)
All my people from the T-dot O just (Ride)

Swing down sweet chariot, stop
Swing down sweet chariot, stop
Swing down sweet chariot, stop

Do you want to get down with this?
You can if you like
Give me a call

Choclair,"T dot O, to the N dot why
That's how we do it
Choclair, Kardinall hooked on my man Guru
And why look, bitch? The fuck

Yo, T dot rocks y'all
We smoke and mix up in your face, you're weeded
So you drop y'all, leaving y'all hired skills depleted
'Cause you locked y'all, Chocs and Guru begin
Can you believe this how we lock y'all

Niggas who be talking how they bigger, how you figure?
You can spark with or talk with this raw artist
You talk heartless but game straight harmless
Snatch your mic out your hand, leave your fingers harmless

We rottweilers, while y'all be the tyres 'cause you need to retire
Fucking with Toronto, get your pink slip, you're fired
Kicked out the Thompson Hall through Apollo doors
Guru be the brethren, bless the man
Slide like the doors on the Caravan

The ill format, the skills all that, twist enemies, Jack
Let's counteract, plus build and all that
In fact, take a flight to Toronto and back
Be over there with Choclair, Kardinall with the track

In the year born, born, suckers have been forewarned
Take you higher than hydro or Moet, Chandon
Word is bond, it's on, in this rap game
I slap mens, mack dames, yes, I'm a fly black king

Stacking paper now, packing flavor now
Hit you dead in the head now, my hunger gotta get fed now
My style's similar to a fierce knuckle hit
Or like hollow points to pierce your whole fucking frame

Ayo, witness the fitness
Who's next on the hitlist?
Rap so exact that you can't do shit

Witness the fitness
Who's next on the hitlist?
Rap so exact, you catch
The shakes like a sickness

Ayo, witness the fitness
Who's next on the hitlist?
Rap so exact that you can't do shit

Witness the fitness
Who's next on the hitlist?
Rap so exact, you catch
The shakes like a sickness

Now it's the skinny man dropping this
Lock your brain, lock your lips
Talking shit? Bust your game
Career flops? I'm to blame

What's the name? Yeah
Guru and the Chocs will reign
Wild like the lion's mane, walking through the rain
Or walking through the pain of critic suffering

Got my eyes on the prize with the red dot locked
Gots to keep it hot
My hungry ass niggas be down for the figures
Green in the jean, cruise like some act figures

You fucking with some raw, suave, dog ass niggas
Look into the eyes of the man
That will be detrimental to career
If they touch the mics stand, nigga 'nuff said

Hear the battle cry
Niggas getting herded like cattle to die
Why? Why?
What the fuck you think? What the fuck you think?

You know they want our type of species to become extinct
Still we multiply, they can't really kill us
They're upset, we're a threat 'cause their kids really feel us
They think we're drug dealers and some of us maybe are

But I be the G you are you of the Gang to the Starr
I'm going far, baby par, pimping in a fly car
Getting eyes from the honeys, parking up at the bar
Always up to par when I spar

And yo, while your protecting your neck
I be like breaking your jaw
Yo Trizzack, your shit's wizzack

I took that shit thizzack
It shouldn't of even been up on the rizzack
Straight like thizzack, motherfuckers

Ayo, witness the fitness
Who's next on the hitlist?
Rap so exact that you can't do shit

Witness the fitness
Who's next on the hitlist?
Rap so exact, you catch
The shakes like a sickness

Ayo, witness the fitness
Who's next on the hitlist?
Rap so exact that you can't do shit

My attitude on the hoes
I wreck the mic like a pimp, pimps hoes
Like a pimp, pimps hoes, pimp, pimps hoes
Let's close

Yo, you see, I like to party
Just as much as the next man
So, you know this one right here
This one's for y'all

Choclair,"INTRO [Choclair]
Uhh, yeah
Now look in the mirror
Tell me what you see
Bomb diggy dogg baby
We be rubbin' tonight (yo)
We be lovin' tonight (right)
Uhh, yeah
Ha ha

[Choclair]
I remember seeing you in spaghetti straps
Nappack held up by you ass back
When I seen it, I was like DAMN!
Girl do you have man
Body look like it was wrapped in seran
Hear me
Told me alone, I was kind of surprise
Really
Out late night, spending mad cash chillin'
See the walk you were walking, open my eyes
And the talk I was talking, parted your thighs
But they ain't nothing wrong
'Cause we both grown
Hitting in the morning until we strong grown
And we strong moan and waking up the block
And getting all confused, not showing from your boyfriend
Don't dwell on these minor details
Let's cruise with the wind blowing, speed the sails
We could rock on, and cruise home
Plus your tight skirt be flashing your thong
Shit's on, oh girl

CHORUS [Saukrates]
You fronting like I ain't 'bout to knock it
I got a rocket in my pocket
Two tickets to your ecstacy
And one for this chick standing next to me
If she with it, I'mma hit it (I'mma hit it)
Baby you is wit it (is you wit it, wit it)
I'mma hit it (I'mma hit it)
I'mma hit it

[Choclair]
See I was peeping your style
You was sitting at the bar with your hand on a Marnier Grand (ha ha)
Now baby to all these people, notice who you are
So they ready try to score
Pulling out their bill folds, buy a red rose to give you
I chill on the humble in my jeans and steel toes
I see your eyes moving in stealth mode
But then you realize, oh shit it's Choc on the side
See moving to my side, and when she walks she glides
Body looking strong like Cadillac designs
She moves close, her finger running up my elbow
And then invites me to her humble abode
Check it, uhh
Now before I get in it, first she walks around naked
Says she loves prospects and talks about her fetish
How she loves dark skinned men, hairy chested
She's hefty breasted, movements fuel injected
She says she's rough at first, but when I start to groan
I be closing every night and taking it straight to the dome
So we could rule the world or you could stay at home
But tonight she be ready to bone, it's on
Oh boy

CHORUS

[Choclair]
See this is for my ladies in open toed shoes
And belly chains that make money and like their sex sweaty
Who like their sex messy and ready to go
And not afraid to say they ready to bone (it's on)
And not afraid to peel of they thong
And not afraid to take it straight to the dome
And for my dogs that make laws and cruise off shore
With five in the pocket, or drop shitty causes
For when it comes to strokes, spring break miss capone(?)
Take no crumb cake to clear out the bars
Watch yourself girl when you're playing it close
'Cause you'll get the strokes and then get ghost
It's on

So chill from the scene
About every hour puff the Al Green
Hop in the car, drive the 3-D
Blow down the windows, raise the P-be's
Parents, they roll up, don't understand we

Y'all can move if ya want to
Yo, yo, picture me just a kid once again
Innocent in this world full of sin
A time, took a pull, pop's head took a spin
Hand came crashing up the side of my chin
A lesson that I learned from him
Rarely remembering him
Even hard to consider him friend
My moms tried to make these ends
We be poor, eviction notice on the door
Will it come to an end?
Pimple head kid in a Pope cardigan
Hoping, the shots don't bust again
Cause I done lost two friends, in the parking lot

When I saw these three people, beat this man honest
Knew the cops would not be on it
Survival of the fittest, now these crew adapt Blue
And outfit in it
Attitudes are well screwed and want to deal with it
Now mommas crying, and babies dying
Earfuls of dudes saying that who's you
Pissed off cause your teen years are through
Newborns 19, you 42
When you get out, you considered old school
And old dogs don't want no new rules
Picture, a new rapper disrespecting Grand Master
Naw, that can't happen
Time to get back in
You call up your soldiers trying to make moves again
You're setting up shop, but your on claimed turf man

[Chorus]

It's still a snap shot in time
When the world knew me and you aligned
Ya, we talked, had dinner, did
All the things that you do in a friendship
A Brass Rail, two G.M.'s, you ale
Three chicks, contract signed, chart rise
My position is, couldn't be better
For a kid in a Sears sweater
Piss coat, uff Tims, no change then (chi-ching)
Straight power moves
But individuals make individual moves
One overseas, other V.P
One got his own, now its just me but it's home
New blood, new heart, but they ain't birth it
And mergers make 'em nervous
But it's the team so it's worth it (we work this shit y'all)
Mad work, mad clubs, got crunk y'all
On tour almost got into two brawls
It's straight love y'all, but I moved on
It's Greenhouse, green baggie, and a green lawn
I'll see y'all when I see y'all

I think one right here... 
Is long over due
All ya'll
All ya'll

[Sticky Fingaz]
To all my sisters all across the world
I applaud you
I know can't nothing can't erase the pain we caused you
I'm sorry sister for all the times we used you
Hurt you, beat you up, bad and abused you
Raped you, took your womanhood, violated you
Betrayed you, you women, we supposed to praise you
Instead we called you hoes and bitches and dissed you
I was thinking ""Damn, what if that was my mother or my sister?""
You never feel it, till it hits home
We abandoned you, left you all alone
With our babies in your hour of need 
Left you all by yourself to raise our seed
And all the times we made you go wild in court
And had to fight us just to get child support
There is only a handful of us that handle our responsibility
I'm from a broken home; know this shit is killing me
How a man can make a woman a mother and a father
If men got it hard, then women got it harder
And I represent every man on earth when I say this:
Sister I'm sorry and I pray for your forgiveness

[Chorus- Choclatt]
Sister I'm sorry
For all the wrong I've done
Sister I'm sorry
I'm telling everyone
Sister I'm sorry
Nothing can change the past
Sister I'm sorry
Your forgiveness is all I ask

[Sticky Fingaz]
I broke a promise, cheated on you, lied to you
I ain't recognize the goddess that is the side of you
I know sorry ain't do it but my acts of faith 
Made me overstay, hope it's not to late
But I don't understand is how we could hit our girl
And how we can bring a bastard kid in this world
I don't want my child being ashamed of me
Like ""Mommy, where's daddy?"" Wonder what became of me
Swear to life I don't know how ya'll made it all these years
Can't even look you in your eyes without mine filling with tears
You my sister, I respect and love you
You woman, men came from you
And he came from she
All men ain't the man that they claim to be
Sister I'm sorry, swear to god, please forgive me

[Chorus]

[Choclatt]
Sister, I'm so sorry
Please forgive me

I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry for hurting you
For mistreating you
For not loving you

We at the Downtown Cabinay, right across the street from the Coca Cobana
We have the midnight roof special going on
We have Choco on the wheels of steel
Slow it down for a minute Choco

We givin' a special tribute to Charlie Parker, here tonight
The midnight rooftop special
We gon' bring it like this, I want all ladies
Who came with their men, come on in
Get into sweety, and drink all night

Bebop, we walk with our hats on tilt
Pink and white silk, made of shoes on stilts
Dressed as the morning milk, plus, like the quilt
When we rock at the club, no blood got spilt
Where dime piece wizes, had they legs in the air
From being sprung by the swings, so they legs in the air
Long dresses, and they silk brassiere
Ya'll unloosen the twist, Rob came in the air

The bud-bud-a-budda-bidda bebop, bebop, somebody don't bopped bopped

Performance, of some of the world's greatest jazz rocker
From bebop to hip hop, back to bebop

To blowin' horns, to walking with the bass up right
To having our crowns polished, and our face up right
To clean our neighborhood's and I play sometin' right

Keepin' the flow poppin' here

When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play
Hey, when face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade

One day my father—he told me,
""Son, don't let it slip away""
He took me in his arms, I heard him say,

""When you get older
Your wild life will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid.""

He said, ""One day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember.""
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the nights that never die
My father told me

When thunder clouds start pouring down
Light a fire they can't put out
Carve your name into those shinning stars
He said, ""Go venture far beyond the shores.
Don't forsake this life of yours.
I'll guide you home no matter where you are.""

About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
but I just had to look
Having read the book.
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

And I stood up and screamed, I'm in love

You gave it to me through the eyes, hatred
Centuries deep and true
I was wrong, graceless and sick
All of the things that I had learned had been wasted

There was no living creature as foul as I
And all of my poems were false
I could feel my soul dropping down through the mattress
I had to leap up before it hit the floor and I'm so alone

Illumination held out in front of my reaching arms
The darker things get the better I say
I'm so alone and so are you
We all live and die that way

You gave it to me through the eyes, hatred
Centuries deep and true
I was wrong, graceless and sick

On a visité la Russie
Mais jamais nous n'avons vu Paris.
On n'a pas eu le temps
D'avoir un printemps
Qui nous sourit.
Nos pauvres amours
Duraient un jour,
Au revoir et merci.
Roulez, roulez tambours.
Dans le petit jour
On s'en allait.
Au son du clairon
Et du canon,
Notre vie dansait.
Nous les grognards, les grenadiers,
On nous a oubliés, oubliés...
Depuis le temps de nos combats,
Il y a eu tant et tant de soldats
Mais, cette nuit, vous nous verrez
Sans grenades, sans fusils ni souliers,
Défiler au pas cadencé
Au milieu de vos Champs-Elysées
Sans grenades...
Sans fusils...
Ni souliers...
A Paris...",Les Grognards,2003

Serait plein de lilas

S'appellerait Jean-François

C'est l'odeur de sa veste

Underneath the mountain,
Right against the forest fence
By Saint Agnes fountain.

Bring me pine logs hither.

When we bear the thither.

Forth they went together
Through the rude wind's wild lament
And the bitter weather.

Sire, the night is darker now,
And the wind blows stronger.

I can go no longer. 
Ark my footsteps my good page,
Tread thou in them boldly:
Thou shalt find the winter's rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly.

In his master's step he trod,
Where the snow lay dented.
Heat was in the very sod
Which the saint had printed.
Therefore, Christian men, be sure,
Wealth or rank possessing,
Ye who now will bless the poor
Shall yourselves find blessing","Good King Wenceslas (Piae Cantiones, 1582)",1999

You cut it out
And everything
Goes back to the beginning

Light is shed not a breath too soon
Darkness rises in all you do
Standing and drawn across the room
Spatial movements are butterflies
Shadows scatter without a fire

There's never been bad, there has always been truth

Choke,"Until this big revue 
I thought I'd figured out
No release from the pressure 
Growing strong 

Confirmation from outside is a luxury 
But without I have to dig for the reasons 
Found to live inject my life with meaning 
Suffering from pains 

I needed a cure placed my attention 
In what could make a difference 
In my life all I wished for before 
Was a reason to go on 

Found in a tune hollow existence 
A grim prospect secured a distance 
And without I'm nothing 
Sometimes I picture a life 

A picture I can't have denied 
It with this therapy 
I use to define identity 
What's lost in me 

To where I realize has how been refined 
Security's no option 
Invested all I had against recourse 
Accepted rejection by decisions 

To ignore average life 
I was always so sure 
That the answer lay beyond the prescribed path 
Refused admission to my escape 

Provided the stage 
I need to realize/confirmed in my eyes",Lifeline,
Choke,"So I find my way home again 
The streets all mine another night 
Of searching for a truth 
In our lies wasting precious time 
Forcing impossible of convincing myself 
It'll work out tomorrow 
Try to follow the outline of what should come 
To be only to find 
I'm overcome by fatigue 
An empty routine created for show 
Has become just another escape from the world 
Fabricating our mock progress 

Faking smiles 
No one has to know the bleakness face to face 
With our undying will to make it just scraping 
Gathering all pieces to complete 
The picture still hoping for confirmation 
That this will never end respond to accusations 
From my thoughts in need of answers

Efforts can't manage to pull out

I'm not tired so far a devotion too strong",Tired,

No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring
No song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day
No April rain
No flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
No summer's high
No warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze
No falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies
No Libra sun
No Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart, of my heart, of my heart
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart, of my heart, baby of my heart",I Just Called to Say I Love You,1991

Choking Victim,"If there was a god, I'm sure he would be hated,
For making bugs, this hell now don't you hate it
Sit on a coat, put on a hat,
I am infested, it happens just like that.
I'm sure I hate 'em, there ain't no maybes,
Bodylice & crabs, headlice & scabies.
You take your pick.
They make me sick.
Well, I'll scratch until I bleed,
So there'll be scabs for me to pick.
It drives me mad as I scratch my body raw,
Sometimes it feels like sex when I'm scratching with my paws.
Sometimes it feels better, when it gets wetter;
Lubed up with puss & blood... but later I'm upsetter.
'Cause of the pain when the rash becomes inflamed,
I simply lost control, the scabies can't be blamed.
Oh yes they can!
I'll go complain to the drop in center clinic,
Hook me up with some lindane!

Oh yes lindane, the stuff for the occasion,
This lotion gives you cancer with too many applications. (3x)

But I must use it. I'll be the tested.
This time it's gone too far my body is infested.
I am infested, I am infested,
This time it's gone too far, my body is infested.
I am infested, I'll be the tested,
This time it's gone too far, my body is infested...

One bug, two bug, three bugs, four,
These bugs just fuck & eat, soon they'll be hundreds more.(to) Infest my head, infest my bed,
These bugs won't stop infesting 'til I kill them all dead.

Then there's the eggs, the fucking catch.
If I don't delouse again, in seven days they'll hatch.
And at this time, I will truly go insane;
My nervous system shot by the use of the lindane.

It is this lotion on my generation tested,
This time it's gone too far, my body is infested.",Infested,1997

But ya, need a ticket for the bullet train

What's up, ah ha, come on
Choppa Style. Jahbo, Playa Will
On the track come on

[Choppa]
Ooh girl you looking good, give lil Choppa a holla
Cause I could take you out that Baby Phat, and put you in Prada
Choppa Style came from nothing, to having some change
Now everybody's in my face, wanting to look at me strange
Now I ain't even got a Range yet, but that's alright baby
Cause I ain't got my change yet, and I ain't nice
And I ain't right, and I ain't flipping chicks
But I ain't really nothing nice, when I'm spitting hits
You feel this shit, then won't you bob your head back and forward
And if you like the way it sound, go to the store and sco' it
You see me, I'm low key, cause I got this
And Choppa style dropping nothing but some hot hits, some hot hits
I can't wait, till I'm living lavage, call me Choppa
Tim Smooth, cause I gotta have it
And this not for a career, its all for fun
And I'm not from St. Louis, but I'm number one, I'm number one

[Chorus: Jahbo - 2X]
Girl you looking good, come and ride with me
Hop in my 6 you looking nice, in them Prada jeans
So won't you drop it, bend it over, touch your toes for me
Bend it, make that booty wiggle wobble out for me

[Choppa]
I got your head board banging, ooh la-la-la
When I ask you who you loving, you say Chop-Chop-Chop
I'm making it hot, coming through and breaking your twat
Don't you worry bout twenty minutes, cause I ain't gonna stop
You say you wanna get served wobble, so I'm gon find you
You say you wanna hot boy, with a condo
How you like it, from the back or your legs in the air
You could ride it, you could dodge it girl, I just don't care
Cause I'ma serve it like I beat it, like I chop it like a dog
I'ma make you touch your toes, sit you down and break you off
To you fat girls, I don't discriminate on y'all
If you can break me with your wiggle, I'll do you like a dog
I want a slim, fine woman, so I could break her cousin
Cause Choppa's like Popeye's chicken, you gotta love him
The next time you think, that you won't get served proper
I got your head board banging, p.s. just love Choppa

[Chorus - 2X]

[Choppa]
I want a slim, fine woman, who as cute as the (what)
Never ever labeled a duck, but always quick to buck
A attitude sometimes, but not a project child
But if needed to bend some piece, she acting project style
And she walk like a model, when she up in them streets
Prada pants, Prada purse, Prada shoes on her feet
She don't hang with messy chickens, cause she say that they sad
They already know the difference, its lust they got it bad
She don't listen to, what you say bout me and them broads
She never listen from the jump, though her head is hard
If she tell me she gon leave me, so my heart ain't gon stop
I get a playa bring a mill, and my woman I'll watch
And oh, tell your baby daddy, he ain't got nothing on me
Going rounds and he gon shoot me, tell him up it and see
Oh, you wonder how she really got that mark on her chest
Ask your girl, she'll probably tell you, but that ain't nothing but mess

[Chorus - 4X]

To rest my eyes in shades of green

Under Dreaming Spires 
To Itchycoo Park, that's where I've been

What did you do there? - I got high 
What did you feel there? - Well I cried
But why the tears there? - I'll tell you why - yyyyy 
It's all too beautiful, It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful, It's all too beautiful

I feel inclined to blow my mind 
Get hung up, feed the ducks with a bun 
They all come out to groove about 
Be nice and have fun in the sun 
I'll tell you what I'll do - What will you do?

I'd like to go there now with you
You can miss out school - Won't that be cool 
Why go to learn the words of fools?

What will we do there? - We'll get high 
What will we touch there? - We'll touch the sky 
But why the tears there? I'll tell you why 
It's all too beautiful, It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful, It's all too beautiful

Chopper,"Met a girl last summer
She was a vir, a virgin girl
Talked a while on the corner
She was high, she was really bye, bye
Had a sandy dress, unshaven legs
But a beauty you could not face
And who am I to say that a beauty goes away
When she smokes the sensi day after day
My integrity does not agree
She calls me in the morning
And says let's go to the ???
??????????????? and if you keep the girl
At least don't eat her keys
She packs the pipe as much as she can fill
She boxes it up, she smokes it up
And says that's good shit
About this time I start feeling just right
I'm trying to drive with the contact high
So pump pump pump pump pump pump 
Pump pump pump pump my brakes
A style in the make of my in-take
So what's it do for ya 
What's it prove for ya 
All that she could up with is this 
What'cha got against 
Why you on defense 
Let me tell you something about him 
It's the healing of the nation 
The food of the gods 
The product of your mother 
Of the know you got me wrong 
So roll it up, roll it up 
Stick it in a bomb 
Even make a Jamaican man sing a happy song 
And I don't know what it means 
When they say go long, go long 
But I own every record by ""Cheech and Chong"" 
It makes me feel so sexy when I'm lying in your arms 
All natural, no need to be alarmed 
When they legalize this shit
I think about your farm",Virgin Girl,1998

The shock value way up close, I'm like a lay-up post
Though I could jay-up most, I like the contact
When we were kings we would sing without a contract
Now we all just a bunch of Linda Ronstadts
When men pass microphones to men
It's like the saints go marchin' in, that's the cipher I be in
I heard Biavians was headed for the Earth
That or Revelations yo, whichever come first
I'ma do it now so how ya like me now? Hate me now?
My art is the Ark of the Covenant, take me down

Life without passion turn volunteer to victim
Bugged right? When I think in terms of off the hook
I think strictly confrontational, meet me at the rhyme book
Or we can shoot a fair one for the ages
I break the mind states equivalent to rib cages
And the fashion would suggest that, there's simply nothin' better to do
But sit around disrespectin' your crew
At the same time it's somethin' that be wonderful or terrible
Between dance steps and tears, life is most bearable

It's said some like it hot but mic handlers
Can't even understand what Grand did to the parameters
This is a family affair, now leave it there neighbor
I'm Grand Agent forces of nature owe me favors
My contacts can't be tapped no phones, no homes
No physical forms, they can't be cloned

This be some dust-minded shit to make you draw blood
And cast the first stone, even wit ya sins and all

Chops,"I run through your veins like James & The Famous Flames
Name is Grand Agent, this is how you play the game
Lay up in the cut like the babies in your nuts
Even though you want to make it born, never rush
Treat it like a trick and cover up your dick and
Feel what you spit and you might write a hit and
Maybe you won't, but I still think you dope
Not the type to hope that a brother drop the soap
Like the kid up in Half Baked, check the second Quest tape
""It's the rap industry and it ain't that cool.""
But worse though it's ignorant, not to make niggas rich
Even Chuck D sell his stuff on the internet
Now you want to get outta ya deal (Fuck you talkin' 'bout?)
Don't let this rhyme change how the way you feel
Naaah, don't be mad 'cause it ain't all good
Believin' everything that you saw in the hood
It goes on and on into show-biz
With the dumb shit, on some ""Yo where you from kid?""
Now you represent that, though it's evident that
You talkin' 'bout places that you ain't never been at
In fact, I'ma say it again
Livin' by the pen is minglin' with mayhem - c'mon

 ""Grand Agent"" - ""Minglin with mayhem""
""Grand, Agent"" - ""North Philly's most wanted!""
 ""Grand Agent"" - ""Minglin with mayhem""

See I write my own rhymes, produce my own hits
And I'm never at a loss for new shit
I take a whole song and rape it
With so much finesse though, brothers can't hate it
And if they do then so what it's all love
What I'm about to say should be dug
Rap is my bitch and your bitch is my bitch and
Some of y'all is rich, but your rhymes ain't shit
So how do you frauds like me now?
I only hit grand slams, never will I foul
Brothers pop fly when they be catchin deals
I step to your crew 'cause I know they think for you
Yo, you can't hustle down this way
""Aiyyo Grand, I heard you moved to LA!""
You gotta know folks, a whole lotta folks
But if they whack, then it don't mean jack man
You better off on your own ock
Doin this for the love of Hip Hop
I gotta thousand rhymes books at the crib
Not for show though, it's just the way I live
See, me I want the show doe, some get no dough
It's up to you though, choose your own path bro
But remember when you live by the pen
Yo kid, you're minglin with mayhem

[Chorus]

Yo, it's deadlier than being truthful
Sometimes when you that and you black then they shoot you
But the norm it's not, if you perform a lot
Make sure it's not warm, but hot
In other words, earn your stardom
Never follow something other than your own calling
Rough and rugged, not for the timid
Inside the North Blunt Illadel city limits
Learned from the greats so the flakes and fakes
Gotta hold tight, yeah they just gotta wait
I'm not speakin to upset ya, I bet the lecture
Will enhance your whole two-bit
Education on this rap shit, you got it ass backwards
Gotta speak truth regardless of the facts kid
Word - but if preferred, you can be a bitch
To get a deal you be a eight-to-one pick
It's in the handle, can you handle your pen?
Yo, you're minglin with mayhem

Chord Overstreet,"Don't stop! Don't stop!

If you wake up and don't want to smile,
If it takes just a little while,
Open your eyes and look at the day,
You'll see things in a different way.

Don't stop, thinking about tomorrow,
Don't stop, it'll soon be here,
It'll be, better than before,
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.

Don't stop! Don't stop!

Why not think about times to come,
And not about the things that you've done,
If your life was bad to you,
Just think what tomorrow will do.

Don't stop, thinking about tomorrow,
Don't stop, it'll soon be here,
It'll be, better than before,
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.

Don't stop! Don't stop!

All I want is to see you smile,
If it takes just a little while,
I know you don't believe that it's true,
I never meant any harm to you.

Don't stop, thinking about tomorrow,
Don't stop, it'll soon be here,
It'll be, better than before,
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.

Chord Overstreet,"I'm gonna make a change, for once in my life

It's gonna feel real good, gonna make a difference

Gonna make it right

As I, turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind

I see the kids in the street, without enough to eat
Who am I, to be blind?
Pretending not to see their needs

A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And one man's soul

They follow each other on the wind ya' know

'Cause they got nowhere to go

That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself, and then make that change

Nanana nanana nana
(Oh, oh)

I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize

There are some with no home,

Not a nickel to loan
Could I be, really mean,

Pretending that they're not alone?

A willow deeply scarred (scarred), somebody's broken heart (heart)
And a washed out dream
(Washed out dream)

They follow the pattern of the wind ya see

'Cause they got no place to be that's why I'm starting with me

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself, and then make that change

(your) mind!

Chord Overstreet,"Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go

So make the best of this test, and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind

Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth it was worth all the while

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life
It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right

I need to get my story straight

My lover he’s waiting for me just across the bar
My seat’s been taken by some sunglasses asking bout a scar, and

I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you’re trying to forget
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies, you know
I’m trying hard to take it back
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I’ll carry you home

So let’s set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

I just thought maybe we could find new ways to fall apart

So let's raise a cup
