Molly Hatchet,"Coming into town at the speed of light
This is Franklin County you got that right
The law is on my trail...babe I gotta git
Around Rafes turn foot down to the floor
400 horses gimme more...more...more
Gotta get back to Hazzard you lnow I can't quit


[Chorus:]
White Lightning... say it with a smile
I'll be half way home across six counties
Before you can blink an eye
White Lightning...say it with a smile
I'll be bumper to bumper passin' on the right side
Feelin' my machine man what a ride...
A hundred miles to go...almost there
Blue lights in my rear view mirror
Hell is at my back...my babys runnin' strong
Road block ahead I had to gear down
through Kelsys woods and eased my way around
Elvis on the radio singing my favorite song

When the weekend gets here baby
They come from near and far
Reverned with a twenty dollar bill
Holds a bible and a mason jar


[Chorus:]
White Lightning... say it with a smile
I'll be half way home across six counties
Before you can blink an eye
White Lightning...say it with a smile
I'll be bumper to bumper passin' on the right side
Feelin' my power man what a ride...White Lightning!!!
Mama & Aunt Queenie get to cookin'
Everything gets right...
We'll all be at church on Sunday
Right now it's Saturday night...


[Chorus:]
White Lightning... say it with a smile
I'll be half way home across six counties
Before you can blink an eye
White Lightning...say it with a smile
I'll be bumper to bumper passin' on the right side
Feelin' my machine man what a ride...
White Lightning... say it with a smile
I'll be half way home across six counties
Before you can blink an eye
White Lightning... say it with a smile
I'll be bumper to bumper passin' on the right side
Feelin' my tension man what a ride...
White Lightning...Yes",White Lightning,2000
Molly Hatchet,"Well.. I've been beatin' the bushes all week long
Can't seem to save a dollar
Apartments empty I'm all alone
Won't you listen to a grown man hollar
The boss man's dead on my case
Keep your mind on the job and stay busy
My mind's been on his secretary
Lord have mercy...make ya dizzy

Why won't you take me home...Baby

Chorus:
Why won't you take me home
Just tell me get back to fishin'
I ain't gonna go for no bait and switchin'
Why won't you take me home
Every man wants his secretary
The woman of his dreams
Monday through Friday nine to five...she's all over me
We get to work and she starts flirtin'
Loves to play her game
I saw her out on Saturday night
She didn't seem to know my name.

Tuesday I'm ready to scream
Wednesday I'm a little less mean
Thursday I'm ready for sin
Friday night let the games begin.

Chorus:
Why won't you take me home...
Why won't you take me home
Be stuck in the middle far too long
Hot diggity dog let's have some fun
Why won't you take me home...

Molly Hatchet,"The Blue Ridge Mountains were turning green
The last time I saw her face
Rose colored glasses can't hide the pain
Neither can your satin and lace

[Chorus:]
I turned my Back on Yesterday
For a better tomorrow
I turned my Back on Yesterday
For a better tomorrow
I tried to keep you warm at night
Through the lonely winter snow
Sayin' your wrong is just not right
That's why I have to go

Our love just got lost along the way
Can't fine our selves eye to eye.

Or face to face

[Chorus]

I turned my Back on Yesterday
For a better tomorrow
I turned my Back on Yesterday
For a better tomorrow Our love got lost along the way.
I know you'd walk through fire for me
You showed me in every way
Now it's time to set you free
The words got in my way

[Chorus]

I turned my Back on Yesterday
For a better tomorrow
I turned my Back on Yesterday

Everybody passed me by. 

Well, I'm going down to Rosedale,

Molly Hatchet,"Was drivin' in my car long about Saturday night
I met a guy in a silver Trans-Am at a traffic light
He said hey, you want to make some dough?
Before I had a chance to say no
He said all you gotta do is take Miss Lucy home

He told me his name was Lou, he took me aside
He said I really gotta go, but my baby, she needs a ride
Well I thought it sounds kinda strange 
But he gave me twenty bucks and some change
And said all you gotta do is take Miss Lucy home

Take Miss Lucy home, take Miss Lucy home
All I gotta do is take Miss Lucy home

I don't know Lou took off 
And left me with this drunk chick
She had purple hair and a mouthful of green lipstick
She said I used to live with Lou
But he's catchin' the next train to Kathmandu
He left me here so I I'll stay with you

Well, now I'm in a mess cause I tried to 
Be a hell of a guy, when he said take her home 
How could I know he meant to 
Take her to her to mine? Not mine!

Drivin' home in my car late last Saturday night
I met a guy in a red corvette at a traffic light
I said hey, you want to make some dough?

Molly Hatchet,"Well she grabbed me and asked me,
If I had a name,
She told me she was interested to see,
If I could play the game,
She said her name was victory,
She didn't want to know the rules,
That's just the way I wanted to play,
In a game designed for fools.

We were beatin' the odds, we were beatin' the odds,
We were beatin' the odds again,
We were gambling with our souls,
We were playing to win,
We were beatin' the odds again.

Well I rolled the dice feelin' cold as ice,
And Victory drew the cards,
We knew that loosin' when the stakes were high,
Could really hit us hard,
I strapped into the drivers seat,
With Miss Victory by my side,
She knew at a glance she was takin' a chance,
By coming along for the ride.

We were beatin' the odds, we were beatin' the odds,
We were beatin' the odds again,

Time and space stood still that day,
With Victory's soul and mine,
We were running a race between heaven and hell,
And we could not find the finish line,
And when it was all over we won it in the end,
We were splittin' the prize when she opened her eyes,
And said Baby let's try it again.

Molly Hatchet,"Seven seas seven skies
Lightning strikes and brave men die
Tatanka great, Tatanka small
When darkness comes they kill them all
Tatanka

You take what you want but you don't ask
You're future doesn't lie with things of the past
The search for freedom will never be found
As long as we stand upon this sacred ground

The curse of the curses upon the land
One day Tatanka will make a stand
Take back the soul of mother nature
Give back the spirit of a world endangered
Tatanka comes, stand and deliver

The souls of the brave lie on forever
The tale of tears is a tale of courage
Tatanka comes from across the river

Chorus repeat

The battles were fought and the damage was done
The wars not over its just begun
The debt that's owed will never be payed
The promised land will never be saved

Their forefathers dreams, hopes, and vision
Through children's eyes has it been forgiven

Molly Hatchet,"It started out baby, just like a dream
Like teenage romance, we were head over heels
I can't read the future to tell what was in store
While I was sleepin', she was all out the door

I can't believe that she said, I was her man
And she was my baby, that's when the trouble began
And trouble follows you around all night and day
Now that I know we'll go our separate ways

Don't let the screen door hit ya or the good Lord split ya
'Cause time keeps tickin' away
Don't let the screen door hit ya or the good Lord split ya
'Cause time keeps tickin' away

What happened to the promise we made
For better, for worse, I think that we both shared
We try to work it out and stay together
Then I found out, it was all spoken mirrors

If you can't stand the heat don't look in my direction
Just leave the keys and take your obsession
While the show you put on, yeah, it's quite a disgrace
Your number's on the bedroom wall, say, who wants a date?

Don't let the screen door hit ya or the good Lord split ya
'Cause time keeps tickin' away
Don't let the screen door hit ya where the good Lord split ya

I maybe crazy, don't mean that I'm a bad man
Broken sails from a wind of change got me broken down
Lose a man from breaking, baby, till you're six feet in the ground

One step forward and two steps back
Living hand to mouth in a shotgun shack
A two time loser in love, yes, it's sink or swim
Ain't nothing gonna owe, but the rent now, baby
While you are drinking your ice cold gin

I was walking with the devil in the bad days of my life
I could not find the sun 'cause it's raining all day and night
Hear the soundtrack to your soul coming from deep inside
Places you don't wanna go 'cause you can't hide

No stranger to the darkness, trouble finds its way to me
I'm facing the danger, but not till eternity

The world is getting bigger, all alone out in the blues
All fingers on the trigger, just tell me who made who
Raised out on the streets since I was born
Have mercy for good fortune 'cause I'm really torn

No stranger to the darkness, trouble finds its way to me
I'll be living the danger from now until eternity
No stranger to the darkness from now until eternity
No stranger to the darkness from now until eternity

Give everything every time

Felt that cold wind blow

Roadhouse boogie, shakin' all night long
All or nothin', playin', shakin' all night long

And we turn the amps to ten
Then you'll understand my friend

Molly Hatchet,"In the beginning, it was love and devotion
All the emotions you missed all your life
I want to show you into my heart
'Cause that's where feelings have to start

And I feel so alive to hold you in my arms
Did not realize the cost
Midnight promises that are broken don't mean a thing
That's how easy love gets lost

Flames are burning and your halo's gone tonight
Live to tell, fight to live another day
While the world's still turning, you got to get on with your life
Live to tell, fight to live another day

And then in a moment, baby, you were gone
And I had just turned my head
My whole world went upside down
'Cause I believed every word you said

Break a heart and tell a lie
Stole a kiss and never said, goodbye

Flames are burning and your halo's gone tonight
Live to tell, fight to live another day
While the world's still turning, you got to get on with your life
Live to tell, fight to live another day, live another day

Break a heart and tell a lie
Stole a kiss and never said, goodbye

Flames are burning and your halo's gone tonight
Live to tell, fight to live another day
While the world's still turning, you got to get on with your life
Live to tell, fight to live another day

Flames are burning and your halo's gone tonight

While the world's still turning, you got to get on with your life

I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door ""y'all remember to wipe your feet""
And then she said ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well Billy Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
'n' Mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

'n' Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece-a apple pie, you know it don't seem right""
""I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge""
""And now ya tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Mama said to me ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?""
""I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite""
""That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today""
""Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way""

When the sun goes down I?m still believing
In the ways of the world, the ways of the heart
Makes me wanna stop. And start all over

The pines and the willows know soon we will part
There's a whisper in the wind of promises unspoken
And a love that will always remain in my heart

My thoughts will return to the sound of your laughter
The magic of moving as one
And a time we'll remember long ever after
The moonlight and music and dancing are done

Will we climb the hills once more?
Will we walk the woods together?
Will I feel you holding me close once again?
Will every song we've sung stay with us forever?
Will you dance in my dreams or my arms until then?

Under the moon the mountains lie sleeping
Over the lake the stars shine
They wonder if you and I will be keeping

Molly Mason,"If you stick with me, baby, I won’t do you wrong
And we’re gonna have some fun
We’re so good together in this crazy world
Where you can’t count on anyone

I’d climb any mountain just to get you free
I would swim the ocean, can you do the same for me?

Got no money lying at the bank
Got no banquet on my table, got no gas in my tank
With my life we’re laying on the line
And I’m saying my prayer
I know you’re gonna be there, be there

(Ooh)
You know that you can lie to me, baby
I will understand
As long as in the end you tell the truth
‘Cause it’s give and it’s take
It’s no piece of cake and I know it works with you

You don’t need no doctor
You don’t need no pills
You don’t need some cozy friends
Running up your bills

(Hey)
Got no money lying at the bank
Got no banquet on my table, got no gas in my tank
With my life we’re laying on the line
And I’m saying my prayer
I know you’re gonna be there, be there

Bah boom, bah boom, bah boom, bah
Bah boom, bah boom, bah boom, bah

(Hey, hey)
Drop my kind of nectar, jam it to the floor
Where my best clothes out at night
And I’ll just give you more

(Oh)
Got no money lying at the bank
Got no banquet on my table got no gas in my tank
With my life we’re laying on the line
And I’m saying my prayer
I know you’re gonna be there, be there

(Oh)
Got no money lying at the bank
Got no banquet on my table got no gas in my tank
With my life we’re laying on the line
And I’m saying my prayer
I know you’re gonna be there, be there

Got no banquet on my table got no gas in my tank

I know you’re gonna be there, be there

Molly Mason,"Ain't nothin' in the world that I like better
Than bacon & lettuce & home grown tomatoes
Up in the mornin' out in the garden
Get you a ripe one don't get a hard one
Plant 'em in the spring eat 'em in the summer
All winter without 'em's a culinary bummer
I forget all about the sweatin' & diggin'
Everytime I go out and pick me a big one

Homegrown tomatoes home grown tomatoes
Wha'd life be without homegrown tomatoes
Only two things money can't buy
That's true love and homegrown tomatoes

I've been out to eat and that's for sure
But it's nothin' a homegrown tomato won't cure
Put 'em in a salad put 'em in a stew
You can make your very own tomato juice
Eat 'em with eggs eat 'em with gravy
Eat 'em with beans pinto or navy
Put 'em on the side put 'em in the middle
Put a home grown tomato on a hotcake griddle

If I's to change this life that I lead
I'd be Johnny tomato seed
Cause I know what this country needs
Homegrown tomatoes in every yard you see
When I die don't bury me
In a box in a cemetery
Out in the garden would be much better
I could be pushin' up homegrown tomatoes

Molly Mason,"Many months have come and gone 
Since I wondered from my home
In the Oklahoma hills where I was born
Many page in life has turned
Many lessons I have learned
Yet I feel that in those hills I still belong

Way down yonder in the Indian nation
I'd ride my pony on the reservation
In the Oklahoma hills where I was born
Way down yonder in the Indian nation
A cowboys life was my occupation
In the Oklahoma hills where I was born

As I'm standing here today 
I am many miles away
From the place I rode my pony through the draw
Where the oak and blackjack trees 
Kiss the playful prairie breeze
In the Oklahoma hills where I was born

As in life I turn a page 
To the land of the ole sage

Where the black oil rolls and flows
And the snow white cotton grows

Molly Nilsson,"Windows 95, you're long gone but I'm still alive
And I've gone so far, not even knowing how
I suppose the world is much smaller now

The plans that you made
When you still had the time
I saved all the things
That you left behind
But by now I guess I'd consider them all mine

Windows 95, is only a metaphor for what I feel inside
And although I'm older now
There's still an emptiness
That's never letting go somehow

Have you ever walked into what seemed
To be somebody else's dream?
And though the time won't let you pass
It keeps you looking through the glass

They call the year the future was to arrive
But back in 1995
We thought we were standing on the threshold
To the end of time
(And we still do)
So what's wrong with living in the past?
It just happens to be the place I saw you last
And what's wrong with living in a dream?
That one day the echo answers
Deep inside of me

Trying to clear our hearts of fear
Sure it's easy to sit around hating
Instead of pulling your loved ones near
When in doubt, do the brave thing
And tell, all the devils no chance in hell

What are they doing all day in L.A.?
I long for the day when we arrive and get to stay
Keep away from shallow junk
Baby went to L.A. and all I got was drunk

Not today Satan, not today

Don't be sad but do get mad
At all the small men who act so tall
In the end they always fall

While we're screwing tonight

Why the Lord took her away.

We'll meet beyond the blue.

Seedlings turn overnight to sunflowers,
Blossoming even as we gaze.

Laden with happiness and tears.

How can I help to ease their way?
Now they must learn from one another,

Just like two newlyweds should be.

Vi måste sluta för att börja om
Bygga nått viktigt, vi är på riktigt
Men vi är bara inte redo än
Vi måste dö nu för att leva sen

Så kan vi va det bästa som har hänt

Or a moody obsession

A shriek of a devil
Or the laugh of a child
A saint's fervent prayer

Moloko,"If you go away on this summer day
Then you might as well take the sun away
All the birds that flew in the summer sky
When our love was new and our hearts were high
When the day was young, and the night was long
And the moon stood still for the nightbird's song
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away 

But if you stay, I'll make you a day
Like no day has been or will be again
We'll sail the sun, we'll ride on the rain
We'll talk to the trees and worship the wind
Then if you go, I'll understand
Leave me just enough love to fill up my hand
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

If you go away, as I know you will
You must tell the world to stop turning 'til
You return again, if you ever do
For what good is love without loving you?
Can I tell you now, as you turn to go
I'll be dying slowly 'til the next hello?
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

But if you stay, I'll make you a night
Like no night has been or will be again
I'll sail on your smile, I'll ride on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes that I love so much
But if you go, go! I won't cry
Though the good is gone from the word goodbye
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

If you go away, as I know you must
There'll be nothing left in the world to trust
Just an empty room, full of empty space
Like the empty look I see on your face
I'd have been the shadow of your shadow
If I thought it might have kept me by your side

(You see, it goes like this)

Momma, don't you turn away
Just because I've gone astray
Out of the fire, into the frying pan, this is the story of a sorry man
I have been known to deviate myself from the path that is set
But let us not forget about the man who decided to dedicate his life to the jetset
He is now just a shadow of his former self
And dark clouds hover overhead
The living dead, move over, you see it goes like this

I could be a mover, I could be a shaker, don't you try to get in my way
I'm the heart breaker, the money maker, this will all be mine one day
Well

I myself do not think that such a raw ambition, his disposition
To be a sin in itself, though
Should we not forget about the mess that he got himself in

Where now stands this meek and empty man, there once was a typhoon
Earthquaking, a phenomena, higher than the rest of us
'Cause he was steppin' on us, steppin' over people
And this is how the story goes, folks

I will go undefeated, I'll be protected
You think you're big time, I'll show you big time
Hollerin' and swallowin' air, crawling in the pit of despair

Once he got his foot in the door,
well you know he was a fast stepper, a bad taste in the mouth kind of guy,
funny fella though, always had a joke or two,
but be careful, the joke could be on you
Did you ever hear the one about the id, the ego, the super ego,
the monumental man sat back to watch his automobile grow
He was a Lamborghini kind of guy, got so high
He would swear he could touch the sky 
But the sky was the limit

He was calling, he was crawling, riddled by the immensities of life,
ladies of the night would call all hours of the day, every day, all day,
calling for his mommy when the day was done
Yes, he was moving, he was shaking, so lonesome tonight,
And his eyes belied his smile awhile,
Calling for his mummy but his mummy didn't come

Pull over to the side of the road, let the bold be bold

Some of you seem to believe you've only just begun
Try a little perjury, get rich quick
My eyes are bigger than my belly is, and it makes me sick

Be my best friend be my baby I'll be there for you maybe,
Don't get on the roller coaster ya burn your fingers on the toasters,
Just a fair weather friend gone when the summer end,
They will look into your eyes tell you pretty perfume lies,
Slinky slimy lotus eaters jeepers creepers get a load of those peepers,
Talking all that mumbo jumbo people pass in solo limbo,
See them slip see them slide but have you seen the nasty side,
With all the smiling and kissing listen to the hiss hiss hissing,
She slip she slide she don't know why she hide,
Dizzy little missy with a twinkle in her eye bye bye,
Finger lickin' good kill you if she could dig it when you're down send in the clown,
Don't let them poke don't let them peek their friendly chat is cheap
You look so fine you look so hip you're styling makes me trip,
Take your place if they could these are the people in your neighbourhood,
She slips she slides she don't know why she hide,
Poking peeking sneaking cheating sniffing sliding,
A running and hiding,
Creeping crawling feeling and mauling,
Fickle little tickles brains like pickles,
She slip she slides she don't know why she hide,
Dizzy little missy with a twinkle in her eye bye bye,

That I've been wondering
Shall we drink a toast to
Absent minded friends
To all who turn the corner and
To those who went round the bend
Everybody raise your glasses
Drink and drown
Melancholy for the masses
Love come down

Well it's a silly thing
That I've been wondering
Maybe you will never
Bbridge the gulf
Baby you are just too sensitive
Are you numb enough?
Can we ever feel this
Impending void?
Have we become what we intended
To avoid?

Have you ever smiled for too long?
Till you're aching
Have you ever laughed till you cried?
Till your heart is breaking.

Have you ever smiled for too long?
Till you're aching
Have you ever laughed till your heart is breaking.
Well it'a a silly thing that I've been wondering.

Love is always riddled with
Selfishness
Few will find joy in their
Big success
From the sublime to the ridiculous in the
Blink of an eye.
Funny all too funny
You're a funny guy

If it'a too much to feel
Come this way my friend
Try to keep it unreal
Feels good to let yourself descend to pretend
We can transcend our everyday existances
No distances
How did we come undone?
Became what we've become

Have you ever smiled for too long?
Till you're aching.
Have you ever laughed till you cried?

On expanding seas
If the shoe fits

I'm half full and my glass is empty
Say so long and wave goodbye.

I've been searching
For new ways to get lost
There's got to be someplace
Somewhere I'll never be found
I can fend for myself
Can pretend to myself
I will play the wild rover
Though my horse may be blind

And you're headed nowhere
Out on the run
Allow this thought to crystallise

It is better in the long run
To never get there
And let the journey decide

In all this doom and this gloom
And pessimistical visions
Came all condemned men
All fatalists in metaphysical fear

Prone to addictions
To users and losers

Cerdo, no me llames cerdo (mueve tu puerco)

Le piachen las pastas se mete tallarines
Debajo de su almohada encontrarás los tin larines
Pasea por los pasillos de los supermercados
Comiendo bocadillos que le ofrecen los empleados
Antes de viajar por cada cachete
El chofer del autobús se lo cobra como flete
Le quita el migajón a todos los bolillos
Para después guardarlo y comerlo de sus bolsillos

Cerdo, no me llames cerdo (mueve tu puerco)

En una ocasión tuvo un encuentro con el loco
Porque mientras el paseaba le grito cintura bachoco
A causa de las memelas y de los ricos pambazos
Este cerdo bofarrón tiene dos potentes brazos
Al loco se lo echó con todos sus huesitos
Por la fuerza que le dan millón y medio de gansitos
Sin embargo era felíz, felíz y muy tranquilo
Porque se seguía comiendo bocadillos de medio kilo
Le gustan submarinos, le gustan choco roles
Les hace agujeritos pa' meterle los frijoles
Mc trios de big mac, mc trios de mc tocino
Le llevan a su casa dotación de ricolino

Y cada que lo veo es una foto diferente
Se mira en el espejo se pone consternado 
Se quita la playera es un tamal mal amarrado

Cerdo, no me llames cerdo (mueve tu puerco)

Le piachen las pastas se mete tallarines 
Debajo de su almohada encontrarás los tin larines
Pasea por los pasillos de los supermercados 
Comiendo bocadillos que le ofrecen los empleados
Antes de viajar por cada cachete
El chofer del autobús se lo cobra como flete
Le quita el migajón a todos los bolillos 
Para después guardarlo y comerlo de sus bolsillos

Cerdo, no me llames cerdo (mueve tu puerco)

En una ocasión tuvo un encuentro con el loco 
Porque mientras el paseaba le grito cintura bachoco
A causa de las memelas y de los ricos pambazos 
Este cerdo bofarrón tiene dos potentes brazos 
Al loco se lo echó con todos sus huesitos 
Por la fuerza que le dan millón y medio de gansitos 
Sin embargo era felíz, felíz y muy tranquilo 
Porque se seguía comiendo bocadillos de medio kilo
Le gustan submarinos, le gustan choco roles
Les hace agujeritos pa' meterle los frijoles
Mc trios de big mac, mc trios de mc tocino
Le llevan a su casa dotación de ricolino

Shit let's see what happens at the end of the millenium 
People's gone crazy getting kinda tribal
Middle-east, world war 3, it's in the bible
Gonna let it flow just like and undertow 

Flow, gotta let it flow, flow 
Keep it down low you're upstream without a row 
Low, low ya gotta let it let go 

Si la tierra esta hecha pa' que el hombre domine
Porque es un pecado cuando entierro mi semilla
Si los compás de jesús eran casi vagabundos 
Porque nos echan mierda caminando por su mundo 
Vamos, hablemos de un gran rey 
Who giveth life to the man, so they can take it away 

It's your life, so live it, esto es para ti so get it
If something is trying to get you down don't let it
There's always gonna be somebody on top
Don't get jealous don't get mad, just give'em their props
Gotta a lot of people who would like to see us stop

Estas en tu casa tan triste y tan sola
Nada que hacer y estas picándote la cola
Yo te recomiendo para tu calentura
Que vayas a la tienda por un bote de pintura
Consigas un mango, el mango de un hacha
Y luego te la ensartes en la cucaracha
Si no te es suficiente y no te prendió la mecha,
Sigues caliente y no quedaste satisfecha
Ve por un mango, el mango de un martillo
Ponle vaselina y metetelo en el fundillo
Si ya se te acabo toda la vaselina
Y vez a un güey de azul parado en una esquina
Que estas esperando pa'pintarlo de rojo
No lo pintes café, que así no me lo cojo

Baila rica nena, sabrosito, baila rica nena, mas pegadito
Me gusta chichi, me gusta chacha, yo quiero que me des
Que me des papaya

No se y no me importa con quien te hayas metido
Pero ese culo parece radioactivo
No quiero ser vh positivo
Por eso me pongo doble preservativo
Y es que me gusta tu pelo rubio
Que a veces contigo me pongo muy duro
Y es que me gusta tanto tus pelos

Quiero comprar boletito para que me baile mas pegadito
Yo quiero comprar la taquilla para que pueda hacerle chichilla
Yo quiero bailar con la rasta, yo quiero bailar con la rasta-mandita

Ella es bella, te vez bella, levanta la cara para que te veya

But hold the cottage cheese
And for dessert we can do the works
I'll put my whip cream in your pie hole

Live my life the way I want to

For real, cuz it's your pain
When you feel it
It's your blood when you bleed it
It's your loss when you lose
Agree or disagree

That's why when you talk it
It's through your own teeth
And when you get to walk it
It's with your own feet

Remember that when it's your grief
And it's you who feels the heat
Infestation of fleas
People itching to critique
About success, they stress
And sneer at your defeats
Don't need no raised eye-brows
Or looks of disbelief
Fuck all the deceit
That they all got up in 'em
When you feel everybody
Wants to see you in the ruin
Don't pay no nevermind
Keep on doing what you're doing

I'm the one who's gonna have to die

It's your skin that you're stranded
No one else has a hand
In what fate has commanded
It's your soul that is crammed in
And your brain is rammed in
Your life, you have to plan it
No one else will do the program
So imagine, why people
Want in your soap opera, improper
How best friends will
Always try to stop ya
Sit back and relax
In your lazy-boy rocker
Make them the ones to ponder
On how they're gonna stop ya

Well it's always a shame
When it's time to pass the blame
You take it frame by frame
When it's time to play the game
And no it's never the same
When it's them thats in the rain
When it's you who gets the cane
It's you who feels the pain
Or the stain
When you are faced down in the grass
So everybody gather around
And raise your glass
Cuz no one's gonna die your death
When it's time to pass
So live like you feel
And tell em to kiss your ass

I'm the one who's gonna die
When it's time for me to die

Pero! ella se entero y me dio un sermón a esa niña la respetas
Yo le dije abuela tu te estas entrometiendo y me metió una
Bofetada que todavía me esta doliendo

Que vaina, no se puede ¿que dirán mis panas cuando se enteren? 

Otro día por la noche yo quería salir y ella me dijo que no
Que estas son horas de dormir
Y así me la pasé en pleno jueves todo el mundo pariciando
Y yo acostado y a las nueve

Pasaron otros días que no me fastidio por que la caja de los
Dientes se le perdió
Y aunque ella regañarme parece que quería todo lo que me
Hablaba nada se le entendía

Entonces pude descansar pero ya las vacaciones se me iban a acabar
Y como ya no encontraba que mas inventar, fingí un dolor
Que me quería matar
Haber si así me hospitalizaba y entonces yo de ahí fácil me escapaba

Pero! se me invirtió la tortilla ella me empezó a dar una medicina
Me aplico a estar en la cama acostado hasta que ella pensara
Que me había recuperado

Mi agüela, you want it? 
Huh-uh
You got it
Mi agüela, you want it? 
Baby
You got it

Mi agüela, you want it? 
You got it
Mi agüela, you want it? 
Baby
You got it

Y así mismo un problema que al rato yo tenía, siete a la
Semanas era un no todos los días
Encontré la solución a todos mis problemas y es que tengo
Que aceptar que soy le nieto de mi abuela

Si total después de tanto protestar cuando llegue a nueva york
Yo me puse a pensar
Que ella no es lo que parece ella es bien buena y todo lo que
Hace es por ponerme en vergüenza

Pero! me recordaba yo de todos los regaños que ella a mí me dio
Y cada ves que yo hubiera querido beber ron me tenia que
Recetarme un tesito de limón

Mi madre no sabia como yo la había pasado se creía que todo
Lo había yo gozado
Se atrevió a preguntarme cuando yo volvía pa'lla

Y yo le dije mira como en treinta años mas
Yo no se si mi abuela tenga mucha resistencia
Yo no puedo soportarla por que no tengo paciencia

Mi agüela, you want it? 
Huh-uh
You got it
Mi agüela, you want it? 
Baby
You got it

Mi agüela, you want it? 
Si, huh-uh

El que fue a ver a la banda

Cuando tocaba manu
Dijo chao y me fui
Y el Cafe Tacvba no me deja dormir
No deja dormir, no deja dormir

Yo no comer Animales de Mar
Y no conocer a Andres Calamar
Cuando tocaba el Tri yo escuchbaa cri-cri
Me hacia pipí y no me dejaban ir

No creo en Santería y nunca vi la Brujería
Y no pudimos ir a lo de Charly García
Porque Los Pericos no nos dejan dormir
No nos dejan dormir, y al cabo que ni quería

Hablo con nadie en medio de la calle

Soy pacifista y no fui a ver a La Guerra
También me perdí el de La Gusana Ciega

En espera con la ceguera, que la justicia los encuentre
Con dos nudos en la garganta, que son huevos seguramente

Si asalta a mano armada, o si roba al contribuyente
Si por hambre acaba en el bote, para mi es más inocente

Breathing slows...no oxygen
The first time seems timeless
Forever follows,
The brave seem weaker than before
Correct my words
These words mean war
Sequence fails me again
With my lines ignored
I'm not sure if all of this exists,
Sometimes it's hard to admit
Becomes a part of me
More than just a memory
No one knows what lies ahead
All things failed and never said
We're passing to poetry
For every moment, for everything

Through all kinds of weather, Lord

Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows

Moms & Dads,"'t was on the Isle of Capri that I found her 
Beneath the shade of an old walnut tree 
Oh, I can still see the flowers blooming round her 
Where we met on the Isle of Capri 

She was as sweet as a rose at the dawning 
But somehow fate hadn't meant her for me 
And though I sailed with the tide in the morning 
Still my heart's on the Isle of Capri 

Summertime was nearly over 
Blue Italian sky above 
I said ""Lady, I'm a rover, 
Can you spare a sweet word of love?"" 

She whispered softly ""It's best not to linger"" 
And then as I kissed her hand I could see 
She wore a lovely meatball on her finger

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day

Momus,"God is a tender pervert and the angels are voyeurs
Watching us forever, their vision never blurs
They make us then forget us for a hundred million years
And then by chance they glance at us and something in them stirs
They find us so provocative, so weak, so full of pride
Our cleverness, our nakedness, fills them with delight
The way we hold our coffee cups, the way we pick our words
God is a tender pervert and his angels
His angels are voyeurs

And when the tender pervert is too busy to admire us
He sends his angels down to pass amongst us and desire us
He gives them little notebooks where they note each quirk and boast
Our foolish pride and pompousness turn him on the most
When we're throwing temper tantrums
When we're giving up the ghost
The pervert keeps his distance
But his angels, his angels move in close

It intoxicates the Spaceman, watching how we thrill ourselves
Not by sex but by devising new ways to kill ourselves
He sees the way we tamper with the things we most depend on
The danger stands his hair on end and gives him a hard-on
He calls his angels down to watch that slut the world get hers
God is a tender pervert and his angels
His angels are voyeurs

The pervert and his angels hide amongst the stars and watch
And as we blow ourselves to bits the angels pump their cocks
Their semen flows across the sky and forms new milky wheys
And somewhere in some galaxy in less than seven days
They make a planet more curvaceous and much sexier than ours
Full of bigger sinners
More worthy of voyeurs",The Angels Are Voyeurs,1988

Momus,"I was born in the town of Paisley in early 1960
And placed in the care of an old eternal bachelor
A strict disciplinarian, a passionate antiquarian
His collection of myths and legends was spectacular

As a younger man he'd been to see Japan
Where a master in a white kimono taught him
In a shining moment the myth of the bishonen
The youthful hero doomed to fall like blossom

And how could I forgive the ugly fugitive
Who brought me up according to a fantasy?
For when the old man stared at me
He drowned in evil beauty
Thinking of the early death in store for me

He taught me to be good with words, he bought me ceremonial swords
And in this way came grace and expertise
The words were to cut down and to kill the muscle-bound
The swords to fell my intellectual enemies

And women should be hated but first impersonated
Charm, he said, is essential to misogyny
He taught me how to woo the girls in order to outdo the girls
And the fun would come when I'd got them to love me

And how could I resist the old misogynist
Who brought me up according to a fantasy?
My softness and fragility
My feminine grace and delicacy
Made death himself afraid for me

And so in time I grew to be blond and beautiful
Pale and frail, with many male admirers
I was promised by my father a retainer for a partner
So loyal that nothing could divide us

Shocked by my suggestion that I'd rather have a woman
My stepfather replied I had no choice
This man would cut his entrails open protecting his bishonen
He informed me in a solemn, trembling voice

How could I disobey that surreptitious gay
Who brought me up according to a fantasy?
For when the old man stared at me
He drowned in evil beauty
Thinking of the early death in store for me

So me and my retainer encountered many dangers
On travels through the North and through the South
We ripped open the bellies of many famous bullies
And our reputation spread by word of mouth

In the mountains of Morocco we stopped and shared a bottle
With a blind old man with a bearded, bandaged face
And though the sun had sunk and the man was very drunk
He seemed to speak with my stepfather's voice

Saying ""How could you forget the ageing martinet
Who brought you up according to a fantasy?
Your softness and fragility
Your feminine grace and delicacy
Will be the death of me""

Surprised at 28 to find myself so late
Changing from a boy into a man
I'm starting to feel guilty that nobody has killed me
Early as my stepfather had planned

I've found myself a girl and stopped roaming the world
My retainer's gone to be a mercenary
Now I work in a merchant bank, I'm well-liked by the senior ranks
Though behind my back the juniors call me fairy

And how can I placate the ugly reprobate
Who brought me up according to a fantasy?
For when the old man stared at me
He drowned in evil beauty
Thinking of the early death in store for me

I stay awake some nights when my wife turns off the lights
And starts breathing regularly next to me
And I think of fallen petals and bodies pierced by metal
And how I'll never now fulfill my destiny

Father spare my shame, let me pass my name
To a boy with greater beauty and more bravery
For if I have a son I'm going to raise him to die young
And lay him in the grave that you prepared for me",Bishonen,1988
Momus,"I was born with the charm of innocence
On my back like a cross
Thorns upon my forehead
Round my neck I wore it
Sometimes a rabbit's claw
Sometimes an albatross

It began at a school that turned boys into gentlemen
Then turned them on to debauchery
I was forced to my knees in front of these gentlemen
If I refused they would torture me
On Sundays I'd stalk the Botanical Garden
And under my uniform something would harden
Whenever I passed a girl of my own age

Or did it begin with au pair girls from Germany
Paid by the hour to look after us?
Did it begin with that first opportunity
To corner a stranger with nakedness?
Maybe the clinical way they undressed me
Stayed with me and deeply distressed me
I think, at heart, I'm something of a prude

I was born with the charm of innocence
On my back like a cross
Thorns upon my forehead
Round my neck I wore it
Sometimes a rabbit's claw
Sometimes an albatross

Then at eighteen I decided I wanted
To be a commercial photographer
I rented a studio down by the docks
Which I shared with a friendly pornographer
I photographed models in fluorescent light
Whose veins were so blue and whose breasts were so white
I assumed, like the moon, women were blue cheese

When I left home I already had five years
Of self abuse under my belt
I found certain women who'd let me try anything
Just to find out how it felt
In some garish hotel room with vile decoration
The wallpaper witnessed my first pollination
The paisley patterns witnessed an abortion

I was born with the charm of innocence
On my back like a cross
Thorns upon my forehead
Round my neck I wore it
Sometimes a rabbit's claw
Sometimes an albatross

In the army they taught me to share the abuse
That I'd kept up 'til then to myself
There's nothing like killing
For coaxing a shy boy of twenty-one out of his shell
In the dark continent with a peace-keeping force
I fell in with a bunch of Algerian whores
And promised them I'd try and keep in touch

We met up again in the eighteenth arrondisement
I remember them well
Their lank stringy hair and their big bulbous noses
Their unmistakable smell
I'd approach all the ugliest, seediest jerks
And ask them to keep a young model in work
Some men, thank Christ, don't discriminate at all

I was born with the charm of innocence
On my back like a cross
Thorns upon my forehead
Round my neck I wore it
Sometimes a rabbit's claw
Sometimes an albatross

I will pass my old age by a pale two-bar fire
Patiently waiting to die
Twitching the lace as the schoolgirls go past
Tracing a page of Bataille
And if you catch sight of my secondhand coat
Leaving behind it a faint whiff of goat
Remember both of us are naked underneath

I thought it would end with the first obscene phone call
The second professional kill
But somehow detached from my actual behavior
This innocence burdens me still
Up in the attic I pick up the brush
Paint in the crow's feet, paint out the blush
The face this portrait is of is still capable of
The face this portrait is supposed to be of is still capable of
The face this portrait is of is still capable of (Paint out the blush of shame)

Momus,"I was a Maoist intellectual in the music industry

I always knew that I could seize the world's imagination
And show the possibilities for transformation
I saw a nation in decay, but also a solution: Permanent cultural revolution
Whenever I played my protest songs the press applauded me
Rolled out the red carpet, parted the Red Sea
But the petit bourgeois philistines stayed away
They preferred their artists to have nothing to say

How did I pass my time on earth? Now it can be revealed:
I was a Maoist intellectual in the entertainment field

I showed the people how they lived and told them it was bad
Showed them the insanity inside the bureaucrat
And the archetypes and stereotypes that were my stock in trade
Toppled all the ivory towers that privilege had made
Though I tried to change your mind I never tried your patience
All I tried to do was to point out your exploitation
But the powers that be took this to be a personal insult
And refused to help me build my personality cult

How did I pass my time an earth, what on earth got into me?
I was a Maoist intellectual in the music industry

I left the normal world behind and started living in
A hinterland between dissolution and self discipline
I burned the midnight oil to build my way of seeing
A miner at the coal face of meaning
The rich despised the songs I wrote which told the poor their worth
Told the shy to speak and told the meek to take the earth
But my downfall came from being three things the working classes hated:
Agitated, organised and over-educated

How did I pass my time on earth, how did I bear witness?
As a Maoist intellectual in the entertainment business
And how was I treated in this world and in this industry?
As a Maoist intellectual in a business would be

I became a hotel doorman, I stood there on the doormat
Clutching my forgotten discs in their forgotten format
Trying to hand them out to all the stars who sauntered in
The ones who hadn't been like me, who hadn't lived in vain
I gave up ideology the day I lost my looks
I never found a publisher for my little red books
When I died the energy released by my frustration
Was nearly enough for re-incarnation

But if I could live my life again the last thing that I'd be
Is a Maoist intellectual in the music industry
No, if I could live my life again I think I'd like to be
The man whose job is to stop the men who think like me
Yeah! If l could live my life again that'd be the thing to be
The man who plots the stumbling blocks
In the lives of the likes of me!",I Was a Maoist Intellectual,1988
Momus,"In the sanatorium
I've booked a private room
Where you can feel at home
Where we can be alone
Just you, the nurse and me
In mountain scenery

All the time that you've been ill
Your face has looked so pale
Drained by the force of will
Drained by the wait until
My treatment makes you well
Or weaker still

Half in love with easeful death
I cloud the mirror with your breath
Half in love with this disease
That keeps you close to me

Your eyes grow heavy as I read

Their most sincere desire
To travel here and share
The treatment you require

Are on the fire

Hanging round the bed
I wake you with the rustling
And you raise your head
And ask again, your voice uncertain

And you'd set up camp with the Greenham Brigades
And the serious papers we offered our story said 'Sorry'
And slammed down the phone

In a feature and letter they titled respectively
'Love on ice' and 'Gay love on Ice'

We execute two perfect figures of eight

Their nation and their sexuality

I notice nothing until we start to kiss
And my hand goes beneath her dress
To the lefthand breast

Downstairs the party's going full swing
The people we came with haven't noticed a thing
As I tease the teat with my teeth
I feel nothing underneath

Rests my head against the righthand breast

Of which I am the fascinated, unwilling witness
I see he couldn't care where her heart might be

Am I just too pure and too proud?""
And as the bed creaks I ask myself aloud
""Could it be that what makes me a freak Is my contempt
for freaks?""

I start to sweat, I feel it approach
Familiar self-hate, familiar self-reproach
And under my guard again it beats so hard

To the baby that could have been mine

Making you feel so low
Though my lawyer says no blame can be apportioned
For circumstances beyond my control
So now I'm all paid up
And absolved from this guilt
I'm going to get another girl in
Under my quilt
And run up
Another massive debt

In a midnight blue school uniform
Lips just a little too full for her face
Distant eyes full of space
In her posture no trace of coquette
No defiance

Crossing her legs where her tights have been torn
Starts as her mother comes into the room
And the afternoon grows still
And her mother feels chill
Shivers and buttons her coat

I gently correct the curve of her back
And open her book in the now-empty flat
At the classical piece I've had her prepare
And her arms are bare as she plays
And I draw back behind her ear
A few strands of hair gone astray

She shows me her bracelet, the lesson is done
I turn it around between finger and thumb
We sit face to face and it seems to me that
Her face is the face of a cat
And touching the place where her breasts will be
I press my hand flat

She comes into my lap, I turn her around
Her hands clasp my neck and her feet skim the ground
Her skirt travels up under my palm
But the pupil sits looking so calm
As if listening to the distant sound
Of a burglar alarm

And she looks at herself with his eye

And the one boy that mattered rejected her
So she shattered the image the mirror threw back at her
Breasts too flat, legs too thin
Skin supernaturally pale
And now nobody sees her, the girl with no body
Dancing in the labyrinth alone

And she stands at the washbasin looking glass
Turns on the tap with a twist
And like Alice in Wonderland, quite unsurprised
Sees the razorblade enter her wrist

Some sort of baptism by sperm?
Like my cock is John the Baptist saying
'One day someone greater than me shall come'
Or some Moses who leads an entire nation across her tongue

Taking the title literally, he spoke four years or so
And I intend to do the same, so make yourself at home
(Pull up a chair, smoke a cigar or something)
Cynthia Plaster Caster once took my cast and showed me
In a penis exhibition in a gallery on Broadway
So many people saw my penis in its glass case
They recognise my penis now before my face

The subject for today: does knowledge elevate or demean us?
Everything you didn't want to know about my penis

A baker has a penis thing for flattening the dough
But stick it in the oven and it rises up, like so
The man who chops the melons up with a long and pointed knife
Has a penis with a mottled skin, I know, I asked his wife
(Very curious)
A priest beneath his cassock has a penis just the same
Some call the hypothalamus the penis of the brain
One man's sport is fly fishing, and the other's, pocket billiards
Congratulations, Watson, on your almost-Freudian brilliance

The comedian from hell always thinks he can entertain us
With everything we didn't want to know about his penis

Like the heather of the Highlands, mine is tipped with flecks of purple
With a head as wise as Solomon, although shaped like a turtle
It wears a flesh-tone roll-neck and the neck goes up and down
It comes out in the evenings and on Friday paints the town
Obsessively, compulsively, it only wants one thing
To fill your chosen orifice with ropes of pearly string
Delivering its message to your womb or to your tongue
And then going slack and flaccid when its pressing work is done

In witty conversation, by drip or intravenus
I drop everything you didn't want to know about my penis
(Some sort of Tourettes Syndrome)

It's a very fine philosopher, debating right and wrong
Shows promise as a songwriter (it writes most of my songs)
Don't bury it in boxer shorts but wear it like a tie
Or avant garde jewellery hanging from your fly
(Very chic!)
Jean Luc Godard once declared, to gales of mystified laughter
That some men wash their hands before they touch it, others after
And if you slot it carefully where the sun will never shine
You'll feel what's mine becoming yours, what's yours becoming mine

Well ladies and hermaphrodites, my tender-hearted readers
Everything you didn't want to know about my penis

There was a bohemian monk
Who went to bed in a bunk
He dreamt that Venus
Was stroking his penis
And woke up all covered in 

Thought for the day: does abstinence dirty us or clean us?
Everything you didn't want to know about my penis

It's a tribute to the power of something otherwise mundane
That waving it under a stranger's nose is said to scar his brain
I'm doing my bit to see the power of taboo remains intact:
I keep a penis on my head but never lift my hat
(I keep a penis on my head but never lift my hat)

And if I've bored you stiff with this riff about my penis
I wouldn't let a little thing like that come between us

And if you can think of another song even more atrocious

Another lonely cowboy
From joining the lonely crowd

There's so many mavericks right off the map
We've redrawn the map to bring them all back
There's so many renegades off the beaten track

They're teaching it now at business school
They're all wild and crazy and one of a kind
Anarchists to a man

Everybody does it like no-one else can
And irony's a kind of sincerity now
With so many milking a once-holy cow
And alienation's a kind of belonging

I came to a bend in the road and I saw
Two cowboys in black guarding two doors
One door leads to heaven, the other to hell, they cried
And one of us always tells truth, the other always lies

I shot them both to hell
And when the cowboys died
I opened them and saw cables

Momus,"Come all ye rounders if you want to hear the tale
Of a tape recorder man
He traveled far and wide through the dusty countryside
The tape recorder man

Collecting songs of love, collecting songs of blood
Sometimes songs of evil men and sometimes songs of good
And sing irie aritty ardie and sing irie arrity anne

He said the age of the machine would make us all the same
The tape recorder man
And we should tape record the songs the old men sing
The tape recorder man

Because when the old were gone, there'd be no more songs
Just mechanical din
And sing irie aritty ardie and sing irie arrity anne

At a music festival he presented to the world some of the folk greats
Then, with a condescending smile, he introduced us all to some electronic fakes
Saying 'The old folks don't need gimmicks to make the music new
But here's a group of college kids who apparently do'
And sing irie aritty ardie and sing irie arrity anne

And he left the stage to seek some nerdy boffin geeks who sounded like the Pogues
Singing like the BeeGees, dancing like freaks, playing modular Moogs
I met him in the dressing room at the end of the show
I said you used to be my hero but tonight you've fallen low
And sing irie aritty ardie and sing irie arrity anne

I said tape recorder man damn your Memorex
What about innovation, man, what about art and sex?
He couldn't share my point of view, and he freely said so
So me and the tape recorder man quickly came to blows
I hit out at his shoulder where his tape recorder hung
It slipped to the floor with a crash, the strap must've been undone
And sing irie aritty ardie and sing irie arrity anne

It exploded like a bomb from the first world war
And seven spools of folk recordings rolled across the floor
A random burst of yodelling rubbed up against the heads
That woozy crazy spool was like John Cage or Varese
I cried 'Tape recorder man, this I won't forget
This is folk music... concrete!'

Mon Laferte,"La casa sin luz, el frío en los pies
Me pongo a pensar, me acuesto al revés
En la cama y se me pasa el tiempo, sólo recordando
Como un alma en pena sigo esperando
Estoy tan falta de cariño de años pasados
De niña queriendo, de grande odiando
Y prefiero hacerme la tonta para no verme tan sola
Solo fluyo como un río, discretamente me sonrío
Me pongo el traje largo, el brillo tapa todo
El miedo borboteando la risa delirando
Y ya estoy como en el cero de mi cuenta al revés

Aunque perdiera un dedo me entrego otra vez
Lo mal que me han parido intento ocultarlo
Que sanen las heridas
Yo vivo esperando
Y me pongo a hacer una lista de tantos, tantos maldecidos
En la patria que me adopta hay tantos desaparecidos
Y tengo tanta pena, tanta rabia en la garganta
De esta humanidad distante, egoísta y que mata
Y para cantar desde adentro no importa de quien sea la voz
Hay tanto que decir, que no me alcanza una canción
No soy muy buena hablando, tampoco escribiendo
Sólo son palabras locas de una loca que se ha muerto",Un  Alma en Pena,2015
Mon Laferte,"No, no hay nada mejor 
Que probar un primer beso, y más de ti

Y aunque no quiero que aparezcas siempre me vienes a ver 
Estás de negro, siempre tan oscuro 
Te veo de lado y creo que me cansé 
No he oído tu voz, no sé ni tu nombre 
Quiero saber por qué te escondes en mi cabeza 

Siento que te amo porque te odio 
Yo sé que te quiero porque te temo 
Y sé que te busco porque me alocas 
Creo que te amo, creo que yo te inventé 

Tanto tiempo ocultando lo que siento por ti 
Es fundamental hacer algo para mí 
Eres como un ángel de la guarda 
Me recuerdas al diablo cuando me cansas 
No he oído tu voz, no sé ni tu nombre

Siento que te amo porque te odio 
Yo sé que te quiero porque te temo 
Y sé que te busco porque me aloca 
Creo que te amo, creo que yo te inventé 

Y cuando me toca me vuelvo loca 
Las mariposas andan en celo 
Y una libélula ninfo-maníaca me roza la boca tan demoníaca 
Fumaba un puro y conversaba con un hombre ciego 
Yo sé que todo sucede allá afuera pero yo tengo un mundo aquí dentro

Y por eso tú podías hacer lo que quisieras

Como te pude amar

Me siento mutilada y tan pequeña

Ven y cuéntame la verdad
Ten piedad
Y dime por qué, no, no no
Cómo fue que me dejaste de amar
Yo no podía soportar tu tanta falta de querer

Hace un mes solía escucharte
Y ser tu cómplice
Pensé que ya no había nadie más que tú
Yo fui tu amiga y fui tu compañera

Ahora dormiré
Muy profundamente para olvidar
Quisiera hasta la muerte para no pensar
Me borro pa' quitarme esta amargura

Ven y cuéntame la verdad
Ten piedad
Y dime por qué, no, no no
Cómo fue que me dejaste de amar

En la hierba va a regresar 
Y mi boca cantará

En la soledad

Tanto, tanto como tú
Y quién me va a aguantar
Así con toda tu quietud

Imagino tu pelo suelto
Te recuerdo sobre mi cuerpo

Pues la verdad no hay otra cosa
Que yo pueda hacer

Tu no cambiaras, no me vas a convencer
De que ahora sí
Todo va a estar bien

Seguirás pensando
Que puedes jugar a pedir
Sin nada dar
Pues ahora
No estaré esperando

Si no quieres regresar
¿Por qué vuelves a buscarme una vez más?
No me pidas que te dé una última noche

Alejarte para luego exigir que te quiera
Como si nada, nada, nada yo sintiera

Las terapias, los amores de mentira
Más mentiras

Y ahora quieres que sea tu amiga
Pues amigo, dime cómo borro esto que siento

Buscando un amor 
Un pedacito de fruta un trocito

Un vendaval 

Como la vida y la muerte 
Como quien no se arrepiente de perder 
Una gota de piedad 
Para esta tempestad que llevo dentro 

Con un mezcal en la mano 
Recuerdo todos esos labios 
Evocando algún amor, fantaseando una pasión

En qué arrabal te me escondiste 
Ven que te quiero besar 

Ay mi vendaval 
¿A dónde fuiste a parar?

Ven que te quiero besar

Me siento como extranjera en mi ciudad

Juraría que estoy algo mal

Me está matando

Y conoces bien mi habilidad de volar
De divagar entre los mundos

It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",That Old Devil Moon,2002

Can you tell me what you're going through
Is it a problem that ya keep holding on to
Lately you've been acting kinda strange

See there's something that we both should understand
Now if we share a life, you be my wife, I be your man
Nothin' can separate us, nothin' stronger than pride
I see it's time to open up wide, release what I feel inside

And take you places that you wanna be
Yo, come with me I'll show you things
That you would wanna see
Afraid of rejection but your affection girl, it's real
Yo, I can write a book on how you make a nigga feel, come on

If you plan to make love to me
You've got to do it good

Get props, runnin' up in weed spots 
Just a little gets to make game (make the game) 
So you put the steam and the jewels in the stash

Cause my click is too dense, it's all about the guns, the ones

And all the while
You keep me holding on

And when life seems so absurd
And everyone has heard

You and me

Torn me apart. You gotta stop trying to change

I'm giving up. Standing on my own steady as
A rock. Gonna take my time till I reach the top.

Chance on making you mine. Do you know what
You're putting me through? What can I do 'cause

Twisting round and round inside my mind.
They take me to a better place.
Where I can watch the world go slowly by.
And I wonder why the tears in my eyes.
Come tumbling down, down, down.
They fall to the earth for what its worth.
Without a sound, sound, sound.
Falls without a sound.


Walking down a busy street.
I'm staring at the people passing by.
I don't care what they think of me.
'cause they don't ever look me in the eyes.
And I wonder why the tears in my eyes.
Come tumbling down, down, down.
They fall to the earth for what its worth.
Without a sound, sound, sound.
Falls without a sound.

You're coming home, coming home.
Suddenly you're not alone.
You're coming home, coming home.
Suddenly you're not alone.

Never can say goodbye

Even though the pain and heartache
Seem to follow me wherever I go
Though I try and try to hide my feelings
They always seem to show,

Then you try to say you're leaving me
And I always have to say no
Tell me why is it so

That I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now
Never can say goodbye

Every time I think I've had enough
And start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
Piercing me right through the core
It says, turn around, you fool
You know you love him more and more
Tell me why is it so

Soon are all gonna work out
But there's that same unhappy feeling
There's that anguish, there's that doubt
It's the same old dizzy hangup
Can't do with you or without
Tell me why is it so
Don't wanna let you go

She makes a vow to stay this very pace
To wait for his return and their embrace

Off to war to fight for righteousness
He must leave there’s faith put on his strength
At their goodbye, the ice begins to break, no

She waits for him while the seasons turn
The flame in her heart it will always burn
Keep falling in love falling in love with a memory

She waits for signs but they never come
Standing her ground for a millennium
Keep falling in love falling in love with a memory

And she’s still standing
Still standing
She’s still standing
Still standing

Many years go by but still she stands
On this spot in bitter broken land
Nothing can be done to set her free, shadow

Now she sinks in to the depths below
Life it fades and ice surrounds her soul
He returns now that the battle's won

She waits for him while the seasons turn
The flame in her heart it will always burn

Moncef Genoud,"I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come what may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life...
From jazz and cocktails.

The boys I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distant gay traces
That used to be there you could see where theyd been washed away
By too many through the day...
Twelve oclock tales.

Then you came along with your siren of song
To tempt me to madness!
I thought for a while that your poignant smile was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me.

Ah yes! I was wrong...
Again,
I was wrong.

Life is lonely again,
And only last year everything seemed so sure.
Now life is awful again,
A troughful of hearts could only be a bore.
A week in paris will ease the bite of it,
All I care is to smile in spite of it.

Ill forget you, I will
While yet you are still burning inside my brain.
Romance is mush,
Stifling those who strive.
Ill live a lush life in some small dive...
And there Ill be, while I rot
With the rest of those whose lives are lonely, too..

Todos tus sentimientos los guardaste en tu equipaje
Quisiste consolarme y me dijiste yo te amo

Desde entonces no supe que sería de tu vida
Desde entonces no supe si algún día regresabas

Llorando dí la espalda y no les pude decir nada

Ayer que regresé a mi pueblo,
Alguien me dijo que ya te casaste
Mírame y dime si ya me olvidaste
Me marcharé con los ojos aguados

Después le pregunté a la luna,
Me dio la espalda e intentó ocultarse,

Hasta la luna sabe que aun me amas.

Que soñaré contigo siempre que cierre mis ojos
Que entonaré por ti mis cantos tristes noche a noche
Que lloraré sin ti cuando recuerde que estoy solo

Si en tu memoria vive aquel amor de tantos años

Que llora porque el amor de su vida se ha casado.

Y en él se va lo mejor de tu vida

Ah ah

No lo vuelvo hacer,
Ah ah ah!!

Hoy te juro que he perdido la razón
Y hasta la noción del tiempo por mi engaño,
Hice de tu vida un calvario eterno
Por pensar que era, absoluto dueño de tu amor.
Vivo entre rejas,
Condenado a estar tirado en un rincón,
Pensando que un dia fuiste hasta mi reina
Y hoy de todo eso ni cenizas quedan
He aprendido que la soledad castiga
Y hoy que no estas tu, voy muriendo en vida
Pido solo de tus labios la piedad
Que me vuelvas amar, perdóname

Ya no siento penas porque mis heridas
Se han cerrado por completo y de tu amor
Queda un sentimiento amargo y obscuro
Del que ya no sueño volver a probar.
Si llegaste para pedir el perdón,
Déjame decirte que no soy de piedra
Tampoco la masa a la cual tu llevas
O voy de mesa en mesa por favor.

Ya no pidas mas, (quiéreme)
Yo he dejado atrás, (perdóname)
Tu amor vano y traicionero no puedo volver jamas.
(merezco de ti), ya no mas

Hoy somos polos opuestos por tu culpa y tu crueldad,
Nunca vi en ti el sol, (si soy tu rey)
Solo obscuridad, (no lo vuelvo hacer)

Quiero comerte como la fiera a su presa
Sin dejarnos en la piel una pulgada y saborearnos

Why can't I see that true freedom comes from You

Why can't I see that true beauty comes from You
So free my mind

I'm still nothing without You

The beauty of my voice it fades

But I'm still nothing next to You
I'm still nothing next to You

Never moving never near
But You hold me as I scream
Wake me from my wicked dream
Something out there waits for me
Hand in hand we wait for it
But I'm still nothing next to You
I'm still nothing without You

And the wonder of it all is I'm still standing
And the wonder of it all is we're still standing

And I wonder where I'll be next year

Will You stand right next to me
Will You hold me faithfully
Should I question all these things
What makes me so deserving
Of something that I've thrown away
Coming back for me today
When I'm still nothing next to You
I'm still nothing next to You
Hearts are broken just to mend
When will my brokenness end
Lending my mind to dreams it seems
Some things are never meant to be
But faith it lingers as I die
Inside surrendering I cry
I'm still nothing next to You
I'm still nothing without You

Time has the endless sting
Time has a world to bring

Their soul direction, the stones they run to fall

Stand when the lines are breaking
Stand when my heart is aching
Stand where you want me, I'll be here

Stand when the storms could rumble
Stand until the walls crumble
Stand where you want me, I'll be here

We fight a never-ending battle
I fear a cataclysmic ending to it all

Here fighting win or losing

Mondo Grosso,"Strolling along country roads with my baby. 
It starts to rain, it begins to pour. 
Without an umbrella we're soaked to the skin. 
I feel a shiver run up my spine.
I feel the warmth of her hand in mine.

Oo, I hear laughter in the rain,
Walking hand in hand with the one I love.
Oo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feel inside. 

After a while we run under a tree. 
I turn to her and she kisses me. 
There with the beat of the rain on the leaves 
Softly she breathes and I close my eyes.
Sharing our love under stormy skies.

Oo, I hear laughter in the rain, 
Walking hand in hand with the one I love.
Oo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feel inside.
I feel the warmth of her hand in mine.

E alcune rose crescono davveero dal cemento
Marcio

A volte mi chiedo come faccio
A un marcio serve un cuore di ghiaccio 
Ho il futuro sulle spalle e tutto il mondo sul cazzo 
Dicono l'amore muove il pianeta, già
La vita non è un gioco ma ti serve la moneta

Cresciuti in quartiere, fratelli acquisiti 
Correndo in giro come cani impazziti 
I figli della city, zero città degli angeli 
Qua solo marci, a fare business a tutti gli angoli

Mi segui, la strada è l'ufficio, i miei colleghi 
Non hanno colletti bianchi ma alzano i contanti 
Non hanno spettrogrammi hanno cento grammi 
Vestono kilo perché non stendono solo i panni

Se c'è una cosa che ho imparato la vita è una ruota 
Un solo credo frà non rimarremo a pancia vuota 
Questi rapper da clichet non lo sanno 
Qua ogni weekend è capodanno

Ho messo da parte il sogno di un mondo migliore 
Faccio quello che devo, tu fattene una ragione

Figlio che non ho ancora avuto, e dirgli è tutto vero

L'unico maggiordomo che abbia mai avuto è E.M.I.L.I.O. 
Cresciuti a pane e inventiva, sputo sangue e saliva 
La vita è una maga ogni tanto qualcuno spariva

Addosso i pantaloni larghi per la refurtiva 
Tratto l'auto blu come fosse radiottiva 
Ogni sera nel club, tra le birre e le risse 
Terrorizzato dalle sirene, l'opposto di Ulisse

Cerco risposte come Dylan, soffio nel vento 
Cacciatore in una giungla di cemento 
Zero foresta di bambù ma mille canne i figli 
Chiudono affari, per pagare Sky alle mamme

Questa è per chi non si è arreso
Sulla  strada per il paradiso guarda quante multe ho preso 
E se non ci aprono le porte del cielo
Ho un amico che mi fa entrare dal retro, mi spiego? 

Ho messo da parte il sogno di un mondo migliore 
Faccio quello che devo, tu fattene una ragione
Ma fra', se avessi una moneta ci farei un impero

A volte sembra che, mi capiscono solo i marziani 
Non so volare ma frà quanto costa un paio di ali 

Perché mamma non sa più a chi accendere i suoi ceri 
E onestamente Pa', un po' mi spiace che non c'eri 
Non hai visto un ragazzino diventare un uomo 
Quindici anni fa mi hai salutato e guarda dove sono

Ma non si torna nel passato, zero macchina del tempo 
Salto in macchina frà non ho tempo 
Ho questi soldi da fare, un destino da cambiare 
Non conta come, io vendo l'acqua al mare

La senti? la rima è delicata, un flow che dilaga, la [?] è emigrata

Non convinci nessuno facendo pena alle persone, 
nemmeno se ti travesti come Lady Gaga

Perchè la vivo tipo festa
Invece che solo di protesta (e che cazzo!)
Nessun prete mi confessa 
Perchè ho la scimmia sulla schiena e il circo in testa
(Uh,uh,uh!) Granate a grappolo come in Worms Armageddon
Cartine a metraggio e grind nel setaccio, frà, nell'armadietto
Piscio sul parlamento, fumo una canna a letto

Tu vieni schiaffeggiato come Romina
Vengo dal basso come i Tremors, racconto solo le mie vendite
Chi sopravvive lo vedremo, io resto in alto, satellite
Qua conoscono tipo Eminem, vogliono il rap semplice
Tutti a guardare Sanremo, tu vota Marcio for President
Volo alto, la fama è una droga, sono fatto, corro un sacco, rimo nero, uomo bianco
Chi se non Mondo Marcio?!
Ti lascio secco, Borotalco, embargo, nuoto al largo
Ti cucino e non sono Cracco, tu fammi gli auguri tipo onomastico
Ti serviranno in questo mare di squali 
Fatti mordere e vedrai che impari
P2, Gladio, nuovi luminari 
Illuminati, sti ragazzini rovinati
Fatti di rap e coi soldi contati, il flow è Garibaldi, ho molti soldati
Buco palloni gonfiati fra fan, è ritornato George Jung

Mondo Marcio,"Uhuh, sì so come ci si sente
Fra', mi sento solo anche in mezzo alla gente
Voglio prendere il volo ma non serve a niente
Qua mi tengono al suolo per usarmi da salvagente
Non lo sapevi, qua non si salva niente
Il mio diavolo guida la strada e non ha la patente
Ho la prigione in testa
Se cercavi una storia dove tutto era okay, beh non è questa

Non devo essere in un carcere per stare in gabbia
Sto costruendo i miei castelli con sogni di sabbia
Fra', quest'Italia lo so che non cambia
Vedo bambini prodigio diventare uomini standard
Sono nato solo e me ne andrò uguale
Mi hanno buttato in questo mondo senza un manuale
Mi renderà più forte, se prima non mi ammazza
Ho raccolto i piatti rotti e ci ho fatto una corazza

Questo cuore ha pianto finché è diventato asciutto
Queste nocche sanguinano, hanno dato tutto
Queste gambe hanno corso fino alla luna
Per mostrare a questi occhi solo quanto è dura
E questo mondo gira solo per inerzia
Ma se stanotte resti qui forse sarà diversa
Queste stelle dicono: guarda ma non toccare
Questo cielo non ci parla ma ci fa gridare

Questa casa è così fredda ora che non ci sei
Se ce li avessi avuti ti avrei presentato i miei
Ma poco male dicono, non ti guardare indietro
Rispetto a me è più empatico Terminator
Così non ci sono nato mi hanno fatto
Stanco di girare per la strada fatto
Dicono che tutto torna è una ruota
Ma la foto che avevo con te adesso è una cornice vuota
Come puoi criticarmi per come sono
Ci ho fatto un disco tutti contro ero solo un uomo
Sono il frutto di un ambiente gelido
È normale che mi trovi freddo e ancora sta scendendo
La temperatura, più salgo in alto
Fra', quando arrivi in cima non ci trovi nessun'altro
Ma preferivo una capanna a un castello
Almeno in quella capanna non era sempre inverno

Questo cuore ha pianto finché è diventato asciutto
Queste nocche sanguinano, hanno dato tutto
Queste gambe hanno corso fino alla luna
Per mostrare a questi occhi solo quanto è dura
E questo mondo gira solo per inerzia
Ma se stanotte resti qui forse sarà diversa
Queste stelle dicono: ""guarda ma non toccare""
Questo cielo non ci parla ma ci fa gridare

Questo mondo non perdona e il cielo non ci guarda
Figli illegittimi, la vita è puttana e bastarda
Ho visto i veri, ho visto i falsi
Avessi un euro per ogni rimpianto sarei Arist' Onassis
Ho lasciato tutte le classi
Preso così tanti voli che ormai non ho più bagagli
Mi vuoi mordere per la rabbia, ci sentiamo unici
Ma siamo polvere nella sabbia
Ordine in questa gabbia

Non vedo come ma potrei sentire la mia voce per sempre dentro a una canzone
Sta diventando freddo anche questo sole
E vive solo il tuo ricordo, il resto muore
Questo cuore

Questo cuore ha pianto finché è diventato asciutto

I'm taking you back
Here's another one

Uh, yeah
I remember being on that nigga's chair, hard
Back in the day in the projects
Chasing after him, a lil' young chick
Seeing him made me go back in my lab
And write this lil' shit like this
Check it out

Here's how it goes
Used to see you when I went to the store
Always watch you play ball from my bedroom window
The places you frequent, the chicks you freaked with
The spot in the grass where you kept your stash

I used to wonder to myself if you felt my eyes
If you ever noticed me and knew I was alive
I tried to draw your attention, wore dresses to my thighs
With hopes to get close to you

Used to dream about you right before I went to sleep
Used to wake up on the morning hugging the sheets
Used to practice what I'd say for the day that we meet
Used to pray every day for the day that we meet

Used to hang with your sis if she only knew
I only hung with that bitch to get closer to you
Wasn't no limit to the things I would do
To give all my love to you, my God

Can't feel myself
Don't want nobody else to ever love you 
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour, day or night
I don't love you 
You're at the top of my list
'cause I'm always thinking of you 
(Take it to the bridge)

(Cause all my love's to you, my girl)
A thousand kisses from you and it wasn't enough
(Right, I'm taking you back, I'm taking you back, with another one)
I just don't want to stop
Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much
(Yeah, uh huh, yeah, Queen Pen take it to the Brooklyn Bridge)

Stop being by yourself, now you hung with the crew
I took the bangs out my hair over the summer, I grew
Me and my friends, all virgins, all learning, 
How to tow that shit, how to throw that shit

Talked about that sex like I was used to it
Lying about how many you used to kiss
In the hallways, all day, 'till it was real
In the staircase, lights out, giving out feels

Put your name in my notebook, we all did that
Lined our names up with numbers to see if they matched
Scared to death 'bout the first time, I knew it would hurt
In your house, on your mother's couch, she was at work

Dead wrong, but head strong, ya had in this broad
The only one I ever loved ever since I was young
Once in a while I even cut school to give all my love to you 
My God

Can't feel myself
Don't want nobody else to ever love you 
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour, day or night

You think you're worth more than you earned
You're nothing, you're worthless, except for these verses

Honesty makes you do the strangest things like act angry
It's your life, your move, your chance to make good of the bad
Can't hide the fact that you still lied to us, you lied to them
Put the past behind, make it good, there's one more thing to say
Say it

Thoughts sway this way and out of my head...she said...

She said it...she said it all
You're too uptight...your perspective is off
She said it all...or something like that

""No hope in love, no hope in waiting""
No hope in hell that I'll stop waiting, that I'll stop loving you.

If you still loved him, you'd wait for him.

Y'all niggas is petty crooks, snatchin' chains and pocket books
Who you been wit? (Jive ass, money-go motherfuckers)
In this ghetto jurisdiction, some niggas are solid, while others are
Science fiction
Well respected, I'm connected to the roots and the trees, me familia's
Thick
Flippin' ki's, dangerous, stay on top of broken ank-les
Kickin' ghetto wit spang-les, so all places new to the game
MVP's down to earth, niggas talkin' 'bout ki's
They gotta grab theirs first while my crew sittin'
Sippin' Cristal, puffin spinach in my villa
Money Boss nigga, bigger than your biggest coke dealer
We be the outspoken, no one hoes like caliber
Metal like Metallica, so cock your Mac 11's if your wit me
You ain't sellin' shit and you ain't doin' shit
You kills me, coke's is steppin' stones to big cars and homes
Impress me and buy a half brick o' D
Uptown NY, makin' MVP's

[Chorus]
If it ain't real, it ain't right
Grown men playing teenage games
Don't gotta say no names
Musicians want to be gangstas
Gangstas want to be musicians
Two sides on all positions
So be what you witness

My everyday, seen a pocket full of green
As the sun beams on the QB and make it gleam
See notes and half Amir's, break off and rubber bands
Jump and touch a class window, blacked out, black era
Is there a common wealth? Twistin' up a 20 for delf
If your AG's then seize my peeps with the wealth
All players, big willies, big spenders and hustlers
Dice game, Five-0 break it up, want to ????
Make some moves with this crab nigga
I knew he was a fake nigga
Got knocks, snitched up, switched up
Started turning state, caught a case
And I thought court offenders make the best story sayers

So you's a hustler, you ain't a hustler, you's a gangsta
I bet'cha, and if you had cash would I sweat'cha?
You're buggin', my street dialect ain't soggin'
Absolute, no jive, aiyo busters start in five
Don't fuck with them and those 'cause they shallow
Chocolate weed be on my breath coppin' Nike Air apparell
Comin' through blocks, rippin' shit up like a vandal
We all can't play, some of us face sport and Kangol
Roll dice, I'm nice, sippin' half pints of courage
I heard, sellin' coke is the only way to flourish
If the God ain't got it, the God ain't spendin
Po' niggas still po', them niggas they livin' splendid

Somebody I can love for them
All this money don't mean shit 
If you ain't got nobody to share it with
Love rules the world, you feel me

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

When it hurt I ease the pain girl, caress your frame
Get them worries off your brain girl, I'm in your corner
Do what you want, it's your thing girl, I persist and try but
We one in the same girl, it ain't a game
So I can't play with you, I wanna lay with you
Stay with you, pray with you, grow old and gray with you
In good and bad times, we'll always make it through
Cause what we got is true, no matter what they say to you
I could straight lace you, not just appearance
Stimulate your mind, strengthen your spirits
Be that voice of reason when you ain't tryna hear it
You want it but you fear it, but you love it when you near it
Sit her on the sofa, get a little closer
Touch you right, do it like a man's suppose to
Knew you was the one, that's why I chose you
Cause you get down for yours and ride like a soldier

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

Your soul ain't a toy, you ain't dealin' with a boy
Feel emptiness inside? I can fill that void
When you spend time with your woman and listen
It shines more than any bagguette diamond can glisten
I can't impress you with the cars and the wealth
Cause any woman with will and drive can get it herself
I'd rather show you it's heartfelt, make your heart melt
And prove to you you're more important than anything else
Worthwhile, special like my first child
When I see your face it's always like the first time
Our eyes met, I knew we'd be together in a tri-jet
I wanna give you things that I didn't buy yet
Hold you, mold you, don't know, let me show you
Ain't no tellin' what we could grow to
Let it be known, I told you
And I'mma be there for whatever you go through, my love's true

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you


Don't let him sing you a sad song No baby
Waiting for love like this too long
You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on him, baby
All that you need I can give you
You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on
I do, satisfy you
You don't have to wait on him

I'm the light when you can't see
I'm that air when you can't breathe
I'm that feeling when you can't leave
Some doubt, some believe, some lie, cheat, and deceive
So it's only you and me
When you weak, I'll make you strong, here's where you belong
I ain't perfect, but I promise I won't do you wrong
Keep you away from harm, my love is protected
I'll wrap you in my arms so you'll never feel neglected 
I'll just make you aware of what we have is rare
In the moment of despair, I'm the courage when you're scared
Loyal, down for you, soon as I saw you
Wanted to be there cause I could hold it down for you
Be around for you, plant seeds in the soil
Make love all night, bending bed coils
You're a queen, therefore I treat you royal
This is all for you, cause I simply adore you

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

It's hard for a nigga just to breathe in the streets
Let alone trying to make cheese in the streets
Nigga's bleeding in the streets
So I don't go, unless I'm chillin' on the low with my middle finger up
And I'm ridin' for Buddy Roe
Cause he jammed in it
My dog got slammed in it
I even lost Bam in it, wait a damn minute
This the street life, cracker think a nigga fadeless
Cause I'm tryin' to make it out the matrix, fuck this nigga
Nigga's life for dope and nigga's die for dope
And nigga's die cause they live on dope
And I remember when I told 'cha Roe
I would've shed blood for ya'
A nigga still got much love for ya'
Nigga, believe that, and yeah Money Mark mean that
Until the day a nigga lean back
This how a nigga show you real love
A dedication to them real thugs
Cause we the last one's livin'

Cause when the crackers catch ya' they'll hide 'cha ass for so long
And they'll ship ya' ass so far
They'll probably (???) turn round duce things in yo' car
Hell, I rather the go to war with 'em
They got guns but my guns skreeting mo' with 'em
Bullets that explode in 'em
Huh, and I don't see no vest
But cha'll know the rest
That rapid fire hit 'em right in the chest
His mammy gotta right 'em a check
For the rose for the dead man
Huh, you understand, nigga it's thug life again

All I need to get on is a few good men with big guns

Thug life nigga fuck nigga's die in thug life
Fuck nigga's ain't gone never be shit, ain't gone never succeed

The game done switched
Niggas who was po' got rich
Niggas who was real turned snitched
Ain't that a bitch?
That's why I get mine on the low
Hustle 'til a nigga can't ball no mo'
Fall to the flo'
Cause the shit don't stop
Shit get real right here, Money Mark
J to the Dot
I make shit hot
I don't even really wanna hear what you got
Just sign me right when I come for my cheese
Ain't too many niggas down like these
Stand right there while I count my be's
If anything missin' get a hole in your knees
Freeze
I might talk low but I don't stutter
Hot ones go right through like butter
If you feel like a big dog, bite don't ball
Hell, you can get it too if I pull your card

I'm fien to seen all means for the dough
Chop a nigga down if my greens don't grow

So niggas stop puttin' up a front
And give a muthafucka what he want
'Fo you end up in the trunk of the dunk witcha hoe
Layin' on my hot ass amps like ""oh""

Remember Money sparks the name
And it ain't no thang to do a nigga 'bout change
See I love money man
If cane involved then nigga you a lost cause
Shit, I'll hit you with my razor blade
Cut off your balls
Sit you in some alcohol

So when the sun hit me they say ""whoa now""
""He done blowed now""
""J.V. outta control now""
And if they didn't bet they know now
And I don't floss but you gotta know it cost
Don't like the boats but you know I'm goin' off
You know who the boss
Who gon' win and who lost
And when it's by J.V. you know I want it all, hmm
Is they in love with the dubs or the lex?
Or do they know I'm just as good as it gets?
You wanna go next?
If so we can hit it
Long as you know J.V. out to get it
'Cause when it's 'bout my cheese - I'ma clown for mine
If it's be's or it's G's - I gets down for mine
Bust rounds for mine
Put you face in the ground for mine

I can really count on you when I rest my head on your shoulder

When the wind is blowing cold, you've got the heat in your home
And if you ever leave me
I just don't have that thought, I just don't have that thought

I can really count on you when I'm feeling blue
I can really count on you when I rest my head on your shoulder

With the hunger of a lion, the strength of a sun
I don't need to sweat it when the competition come
Original style, like an eight of eight drum
So I don't run the track, no, I make the track run
My momma taught me words, my daddy built rockets
I hold 'em both together now, tell me what I got
It's a pretty small weapon, I can shoot it, I can drop it
But learn to respect it 'cause you clearly can't stop it

Like that

It ain't over 'cause the sharks on the left side, the snakes on the right
And anything you do, they wanna get a little bite
It really doesn't matter if you're wrong or if you're right
'Cause once they get their teeth in nothing really fights
And razzle me I do it like I got nothing to lose
And you can run your mouth like you could try to fill my shoes
But steady little soldier, I ain't standing next to you
I can lay it on the ground before you're even in my view

Give me the strength of the rising sun
Give me the truth of the words unsung
And when the last bells ring, the poor men sing
Bring me to kingdom come

This is something for your people on the block to
Blackout and rock to, give you what you need
Like Papa, who shot ya
Seperate the weak from the obsolete
You're meek, I creep hard on impostors
And switch styles on the dime, quick-witted y'all
Quit tripping, I don't have time for your crying
I grind tough, sucka, make your mind up
Are you in the firing squad or are you in the line-up?
Bang, bang, little monkey man playing
With the big guns only get you slain

You ain't got a sliver of a chance
I get ill or I deliver while you quiver in your parents
So shake, shake down, money, here's the break down
You can play the bank, I'ma play the bank take down
And no mistakes now I'm coming to get you
I'm just a Banksy, you're a Brainwash, get the picture?

We swim against the rising waves
That crash against the shore
The body bends until it breaks
The early morning sings no more

So rest your head
It's time to sleep
And dream of what's in store
The body bends until it breaks
And sings again no more
'Cause time has torn the flesh away

I gave myself a stretch up, a morning yawning
Went to the bathroom to wash up
Put on my French-lace panties and my Enyce warm-up
I said, ""Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the baddest bitch of them all?""
There was a quick pause
Then the mirror responded, ""You know you got it locked stop actin' retarded.""
Fa sho, that's why these bitches don't want beef
Cause I, flash the Roley with the all yellow deese
Got the sunflower-yellow on the fingernails
And the yellow Louie bag with the pastels
Yo I'm livin' like a model while my rap sales (Why?)
Cause niggaz love the way my back swells
Plus I show my ladies how to mack males

And my sound's laid down by the Underground.
I drink up all the Hennessey ya got on ya shelf
So just let me introduce myself
My name is Humpty, pronounced with a Umpty.
Yo ladies, oh how I like to funk thee.
And all the rappers in the top ten, please allow me to bump thee.
I'm steppin' tall, y'all,
And just like Humpty Dumpty
You're gonna fall when the stereos pump me.
I like to rhyme,I like my beats funky,
I'm spunky. I like my oatmeal lumpy.
I'm sick wit dis, straight gangsta mack
But sometimes I get ridiculous
I'll eat up all your crackers and your licorice
Hey yo fat girl, come here - are ya ticklish?
Yeah, I called ya fat.
Look at me, I'm skinny
It never stopped me from gettin' busy
I'm a freak
I like the girls with the boom
I once got busy in a Burger King bathroom
I'm crazy.
Allow me to amaze thee.
They say I'm ugly but it just don't faze me.
I'm still gettin' in the girls' pants
And I even got my own dance

[Chorus]
The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doin', doin' the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

People say ""Yo, Humpty, you're really funny lookin'""
That's all right 'cause I get things cookin'
Ya stare, ya glare, ya constantly try to compare me
But ya can't get near me
I give 'em more, see, and on the floor, be,
All the girls they adore me
Oh yes, ladies, I'm really bein' sincere
'Cause in a 69 my humpty nose will tickle ya rear.
My nose is big, uh-uh I'm not ashamed
Big like a pickle, I'm still gettin' paid
I get laid by the ladies, ya know I'm in charge,
Both how I'm livin' and my nose is large
I get stupid, I shoot an arrow like Cupid,
I use a word that don't mean nothin', like looptid
I sang on Doowhutchalike, and if ya missed it,
I'm the one who said just grab 'em in the biscuits
Also told ya that I like to bite
Well, yeah, I guess it's obvious, I also like to write.
All ya had to do was give Humpty a chance
And now I'm gonna do my dance.

[Chorus]

Oh, yeah, that's the break, y'all
Let me hear a little bit of that bass groove right here
Oh, yeah!
Now that I told ya a little bit about myself
Let me tell ya a little bit about this dance
It's real easy to do, check it out

First I limp to the side like my leg was broken
Shakin' and twitchin' kinda like I was smokin'
Crazy wack funky
People say ""Ya look like M.C. Hammer on crack, Humpty!""
That's all right 'cause my body's in motion
It's supposed to look like a fit or a convulsion
Anyone can play this game
This is my dance, y'all, Humpty Hump's my name
No two people will do it the same
Ya got it down when ya appear to be in pain
Humpin', funkin', jumpin',
Jig around, shakin' ya rump,
And when the dude a chump pump points a finger like a stump
Tell him ""Step off, I'm doin' the Hump!""

[Chorus]

Black people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
White people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
Puerto Ricans, do the Humpty Hump, just keep on doin' the hump
Samoans, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

Let's get stupid!

[Chorus]

Oh, yeah, come on and break it down

Once again, the Underground is in the house
I'd like to send a shout out to the whole world,
Keep on doin' the Humpty Dance,
And to the ladies,
Peace and humptiness forever",Rumpty Rump,1996

If you can't take me home with you
Then a lap dance will have to do
If you can't take me home with you..

Anybody got change for twenty?
Mmm, shake it up, shake it up
Yeah, I know it's rough out here, love
But we got your back

[Chorus x2]
Give it up cause she's a man's girl
She's bubbling in a man's world
Give it up cause she's a man's girl
She's struggling in a man's world

[Shock G]
Now tell me, can you tell the difference
Between a fast-tracking, skank-gaming tramp
And a man's girl
Kind of seems the same with just one glance
See, both of them cause erections from afar
But upon closer inspection it becomes clear
Money be	 gonna get you in there

[Money B]
See, a clever girl knows
Not just hoes work them skirts that's mini
Prostitutes that dress this way
Try to imitate most of the uptown bitties
Now we don't really want to speak upon
Those girls who act real slutty
But we will talk about those man's girls
Those are the one we're studying

[Shock G]
She's real secure, pretty toes pedicured
Baby got her own money
She thinks brothers who floss are funny
Ain't afraid to lick that honey off my body
Feminist party issues she don't care about
Understands men well and knows the power of long hair

[Money B]
I doubt
If she'll fall for the type whose pants are tight on
His pookie
Likes her sex fresh and fruity with the light on
That booty

[Chorus]

[Clee]
Oohwee, she popping! Gotta be, got me jocking
Even Nike and Reebok, the girl I'm talking about be rocking
Them pumps with the toes out
Super saucy when we go out
Or with her patnas, she can blow clout
Cause she's the shit, no doubt
She's so about her scrill, that gives it all the more thrill
Can't lie, a little high
Couldn't get a better ride out of an automobile 
Never make it hard to go chill
Let me do my thing, let a brother breathe
But she make it so convenient when she around
I don't ever want to leave

[Shock G]
She's never stressing who
What I'm gon' do, how I've been riding with my crew
She says play on, ain't nothing wrong
As long as eventually I come home
(Money B: Ooh, she cool) When a brother finally do
The joke's on me cause she's gone
Taking care of she instead of worrying about me
(Money B: For shee?) For sheezy, she pleases me
Knowing that I got her back with what's important
Knowing that I'm down and when I clown with my homies
It's a necessity Â­ she gets to me, yes, I confess it
Secure with her intellect
Never afraid of flexing them hoe-ish dresses

[Money B]
Sex appeal drapes her whole vicinity
I'm worked on, those girls that want to get they lurk on
They get into me

[Shock-G (Money B)]
Fingernails long (tummy showing)
Where you going, love
(Can I be down?) Can I be around?
[Shock-G & Money B]
When you gonna freak with the Freaks of the Industry?
[Shock G]
Come on, now
Get up on the table, baby, get on the table
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about
Can I hit that puna? Punana, punana
[Chorus x2]
[Shock G]
And I appreciate it too, love
I love them shoes, love that dress
I love the whole program
I know you can't keep it up everyday
But when you do I'm loving it, just like that
Now take 'em off
You deserve a foot massage
And I'm about to give it you..
Can I get that puna? Punana, punana
Somebody give me change for a twenty
And get up on the table
Oh no, I ain't giving you more than a dollar

I fucked her and fucked on her bestie
And she ain't 'bout shit but she sexy
And get straight to the point when she sext me
I went and pulled up to the dealer
Hopped out the Benz coupe and hopped in the Wraith
And I still drive that V12 Aston Martin, nigga you don't wanna race
I'm tryna duck the feds but at the same time feed my kids
I'm on the road doin' shows now, gotta thank God for the gift
I got a main bitch but at the same time tryna fuck with another bitch
I'm tryna keep focused, at the same time wanna crash like fuck this shit
I'm tryna balance it all out, all out
I'm tryna balance it all out
I'm tryna balance it all out, all out
I'm tryna balance it all out

I was built for the pressure

Get out that water, you don't know how to swim, you bound to drown
Red dot on top of your nose like Bozo, we 'bout to clown
I saw the change coming, all this shit I invented
How you gon' knock a man for making his own decision?
Same nigga, ain't shit really changed but my image
I had to get that bread off the ground like a pigeon
Remember coming up I used to rock the fake ice
Stood on the block them late nights, asking God to get me right
Remember shooting my shot at hoes, them bitches was uptight
Now that they know a nigga worth it, hoes fuck the first night

I made a couple moves, they look at me like I'm wrong
But last time I checked I'm 26, ain't that grown?
And last time I checked my niggas ride right or wrong
Had to hustle just to eat, got my knowledge out the street
All my sons they a beast (all four, I love 'em dearly)
I hope my daughters never ever meet a nigga like me
I ain't shit to your mamas, always took them through that drama
They didn't understand a nigga, I was runnin' up them commas
Booked up for the last two summers, making plays off a bundle

Stay in your place, step out of line and get you buried
You gotta think smart, play your cards solitary
I made sacrifices, went against my hood for CMG
Didn't sell my soul for money, I just saw shit that they didn't see
Rap game wouldn't accept me 'cause I wasn't pretend
I kicked the door down like SWAT 'cause they wouldn't let me in

I wouldn't take the time out my day if I ain't still love you (True)

Fuck a IG story, you're my life story (Then she hit back)
""If your heart really all mine, why I gotta fight for it?"" (Good question, damn)

In her voice, ""Baby, why you gotta thug on me? (Damn, why, babe, why, babe?)
Why you can't just fuckin' love on me?"" (I don't know, I try)
""The fact I show you attention and you don't show it back (Avoid)

I met my favorite rapper, he ain't know he was my favorite rapper (What'd he do?)
He played me to the left (For real), I damn near bitch slapped him (On life)
I'm thinkin' to myself, ""Who the fuck he think he is?""
Look at this shit for what it is, so I kept it concealed (I'm cool)
That's why I stand out, it's hard for me to fit in (It's just me then)
It's only two seats in this car, you can't get in (You can't get in)
I don't work well with niggas, it feel like I'm jobless
When you in the public eye you become a target (For real)
Don't wanna be friends with these niggas
Forced to shake hands with these niggas
Don't wanna be mans with these niggas
Made my folks fans of these niggas (True story, I birthed them)
I just want bags and big figures
Quit tryna act like you with us
Don't try to come stand in my picture (Ay, stay over there)
This whole industry just fake to me (It's fake to Bagg)
I told my niggas, ""Just have faith in me"" (Just pray for me)
Hoes used to pull off, now they wait for me (They stayin' now)
You wanna see me, gotta pay for me (Backends)
This why the hood niggas relate to me (The streets, the hood, the world)

It ain't live as it seems
I ain't really with the mixed signals, we cool or we not? (No back and forth)
All that dick ridin' that you doin', you a nigga or thot? (A nigga or bitch)
You had the drop on him, let him go, you with us or the opps? (Answer me)

Not at all as I used to, oh no
And lately I've been thinking is it them or is it me
Could it be that I've been changing and become what I wasn't before
Was tired of getting nowhere
Ain't tired of that no more

You can't define what happens
It's just time
That you can't stop

I don't have a lot of trouble 
Not at all as I used to, oh no
Lately I've been thinking
Is it all because of me

I've seen it happen to so many other guys
Baby is it happening to me, oh no
Losing touch with my feelings, and getting colder now

Baby, they went down hard on you
You got pictures that prove that it happened
And your friends who were there claimed they saw it
That's bad

Lately, you've been spending a lot of time
In court trying to prove you've been beaten
Eye to eye with the men you've been mistreated by
That's sad

The word is out in the streets that something ain't right
I'm just reading about it baby
They're repeating they were just following orders
While they're waiting for it all to blow over

Maybe if tonight
You've done something wrong
And you don't want that fight 
To go on",Don't Call the Police,2005

Make me suffer endlessly

A quick goodbye it´s over

Seven days is much to long
What´s the point in me returning now

The way this is going there ain´t no ending now

I see it´s really hurting deep inside you
It sure feels funny but if it´s so
I´ll let go

Feels better than it does when we talk 
We cannot win

Oh
Maybe I could leave you but I don't know how
And why should I be lonely ev'ry night
When I can be with you
Oh yes
You make it right
And I don't listen to the guys who say that you're bad for me
And I should turn you away 
'Cause they don't know about us
And they've never heard of love
I get a feeling when I look at you wherever you go now I want to be there too
They say we're crazy but I just don't care

And if they keep on talking
Still they get nowhere

So I don't mind if they don't understand
When I look at you and you hold my hand 
'Cause they don't know about us
And they've never heard of love
Why should it matter to us if they don't approve?
We should just take our chances while we've got nothing to lose
Baby
There's no need for living in the past

Now I've found good loving gonna make it last
I tell the others
Don't bother me
'Cause when they look at you
They don't see what I see

No
I don't listen to their wasted lines

Got my eyes wide open and I see the signs 
'Cause they don't know about us
And they've never heard of love
