Above & Beyond,"There was a time
There was a place
But there was fear inside
A witty lie to save my face
The parachute of pride
To cross the line takes a tiny step
But will this spark cause the bridge to burn
My fear entwined with my regret
I’ll be the path for safe return

So here we are
All just the same
But you will never know
My secret plan
How close we came
To share another role
I haven’t lost my only chance
To tell you how I feel inside
Is it just me
I’d like to know
Or are we all just a little blind?

There’s a thing called love
That we all forget
And it’s a wasted love
That we all regret
You live your life just once
So don’t forget about a thing called love
Don’t forget, forget about a thing called love

There’s a thing called love
That we all forget
And it’s a wasted love
That we all regret
You live your life just once
So don’t forget about a thing called love
Don’t forget, forget about a thing called love",Thing Called Love [Club Mix],2010
Above & Beyond,"Oh when the cold wind blows 
I feel it to the bone 
Oh when you say you know 
I feel I am not alone 

And even though I may return 
To empty places on my own 
Where I remember everything 
You want me to forget

And you provide a parachute 
When I am falling like a stone 
And I remember there's a life 
That I have not lived yet 

You and I, truth and lies 
I've been fooling myself too long 
You and I, breaking ties 
How could we be so right and so wrong?

I hear the words you say 
Your mouth against my skin 
My world just falls away 
You light me from within 

And even though I may return 
To empty places on my own 
Where I remember everything 
You want me to forget

And you provide a parachute

Above & Beyond,"All these words you speak to me
Are from a foreign land
You're telling me that birds don't fly
How can it be that you love her?

You don't have to raise your voice
I still don't understand
There's me and you, and you and me
So how can it be that you love her?

It was alchemy
To sing to me your freedom song
To make love where there was none
Alchemy, now it's all gone
Here's the golden one

Alchemy, now it's all gone
She is the golden one

So what are you saying?
We've got to dismantle it all
Rip off the paper, smash up the walls
How can it be that you love her?

Take all of the things
We so carefully made
Take all of the lies that you've betrayed
How can it be that you love her?

To make love where there was none

Above & Beyond,"It's the same old scene
You've been stuck at the screen for a lifetime
You keep your mind sharp and clean
With a fix of caffeine for the night time

You got a page full of friends
And a world without end, DIKU
But if push comes to shove
You could do without them if they make you

With all this poison inside
It's much too late to decide
You've got your mind made up
You've been living a lie in your white room

For all the hours that you've cried
There's a year of love they denied
So you slip through the door and fall to the floor 
In your black room

You're a black room boy
You're feeling so way down
You're a black room boy
Forget the losses and burn down
You're a black room boy
Fall into city lights
You're a black room boy
Nothing else to be there

You kissed your mommy's hand
Wearing daddy's ring when they left you
And you buried yourself in the pain that they couldn't accept you

You're in a world of your own
Got no cellular phone
They can't track you
But the girl at the store with the sketchy rapport
She will back you

With all this poison inside
It's much too late to decide
You've got your mind made up

Above & Beyond,"Every little beat of your heart
You get a little closer to me
You've never been so happy since I've been around
I don't want to tear your world apart
But that's how it's going to be
Your head's in the sky but I'm on the ground

Words come slow to me
Silence easily
But the world spins round and round
My heart is breaking
The mess I'm making

Every little beat of your heart
You're painting a picture of me
You put me on a pedestal I can't climb down
Every little beat of my own
Takes me further from you
I've run out of heaven and I'm closing down

There's an actor in this town
And he follows you around
He gets his line right every time
But his heart is breaking
He's tired of faking

Above & Beyond,"Follow
The nails blood trail as another falls from scriptures call.
And even beasts bow in defeat at the summons of the fall.
This feeling crushes reason like the dark insight.
While the sun to scared to rise is burning from inside.

Alive, the dark insight. Nothing cannot die.
This time you forced it open, to see ruined our ancient muses.
Nothing can be as sacred as the fight.
For your life in this night vampiric spirits shift in sight.
A darkened gloom pulls down the room but the moon it seems so fucking bright. In my mind the light it binds my sight to visions of forgotten rites.
Where in there was something no one could deny that the flames would burn my soul.
Time takes it's toll, death unfolds.
As a right, as the the light limits that in plain sight.
The coming cold forever yearning to be told amongst the desperate masses cries.
Their gutted lullabies. their meaning has but died.

Now it's dampened the hue you can't see through. When worshipped in two the
daemon's die to. Though the pieces seems alike.
Never enough, never to rough the thrust of the blood, the cut of the touch.
Trapped in dark and sacred pleasures yet nurtured at birth and born of the
Earth.

Wait, I know this pain isn't OK. It reeks of decay but deep in the dirt the
fire still burns.

Bled dreams lost and obscene. Visions of lust and hatred. No one screams
nothing can be when hope and light are wasted. Grow untold a flower of poisoned
laughter knowing not where to find her I succumb to the one feeling burning
inside.",Sweetest Heart,2011

See it was seven o'clock
and the sun had just set
the crew rolled up and said it time to jet
I was kinda hesitatin' cause it was nothing to do
but we always find something to get into
Total-Kaos broke out he said lets go to the movies
he was paying so I wasn't being choosy
jumped in the ride and proceeded to go
""yo what are we goin' to see?""
""yo man I don't know""
but when we got there it was a quarter to nine
to see the main flick it was a long as line
paid to get in and not a second before 
a sucka looked me up and down at the front door 
now I shined on and walked on in 
but he kept on staring again and again
I walked up and said ""what's up""
he said: ""not you""
I turned around and then I looked at my crew
because I know he didn't say what I thought he said
and if he did 
I'm gonna have his head on a platter
the sucka scared out
when we got ill
the brother who tried to front he got his caps pilled
and his homies they got mad 
but they soon broke out
because of what we had

chorus:
because I take out my weapon 
and I quickly start blastin'
I go total loco like a crazy assassin
I look at my posse they say nothings confusin'
why? why? why?
it's just another execution




See it was early 
we was bored uptight
so we rushed up to In-and-Out
to get a bite to eat
I saw a freak I hadn't seen in a while
the one with the crazy eyes and the pretty smile
she was def you know what I mean
the hoe was stacked to the max 
in a skin-tight jean
she sat across the room 
and try to stare at me
then send a note about how she wants to get with me
now I'm wonderin' what has changed
is it that I'm rockin' the house
and that I'm makin' a name for myself
cause when I first met her
all she said I did with her was upset her
I think that sneak she's tryin' to play me down
cause I ain't the one that likes to be clowned
so I told the hoe to leave me alone
I said girl you need to take your stuck up ass home
at this second her boy walked in
I said man do I have to act crazy again
then I grabbed my weapon it's time to get ill
you can say it is cool or you can straight get pilled
with buck shots I mean all over the place
in your back, your side
in your stomach, in your face
cause I don't really care what your girlfriend says
if you keep talkin' shit you get a bullet in your head
so anyway what your beefin' about
if I wanted your hoe she'd  be already turned out
she's jockin me 
she might go with you
now checkin' your girl is what you need to do

Of whatever, cause ain't nothin changed but the weather
KM.G - 187 - yo, we got it together
And in the back - who is that? The men with the mack
Yo, I had to have the homies cause they got the sack
And on the tables - what? The two be cookin
When it comes to rockin, they wrote the book, and
If you don't believe me, hurry, come see our show
You'll see me - KM.G, Total K-oss and Go
What? Ballin while the freaks keep callin
Beggin KM.G to come bump the walls in
The house, but even if she has the spouse
(What's up?) She starts that fiendin (what happens?) she gets turned out
And at our concerts we always do work
For the fags, the hags, the rags and the jerks
Cause we ballin

(I'ma recite a little poetry for y'all
The name of this piece is called) 
Ballin'
(And I want to dedicate this piece to all your players)

[ VERSE 2: Cold 187um & KM.G ]
See, I'm a baller, and I watch my back
And when I'm ballin, yo, I gotta be packed
If I ain't packed homeboy, you could say I'm slippin
But if you try to run up, I'ma say you trippin
Cause I'm a giant, and to you new jacks
Don't come up and start, because you're gonna get smacked
It's the hood, I thought it was understood
Just like Eazy-E said we mobbin Robin Good
We'll take yo shit, because you ain't legit
You got a fucked up style of rap and without the kick
It ain't nothin homie, you be frontin
Rollin down the 'Shaw and you think you be humpin
On laces? He look just like a lacehead
Before you hit my corner, somebody be dead
Cause I'm a baller, and I won't settle for less
Put Lorenzos on my Benzo, so I know it look fresh
A 500 with a convertable top
Just like the homie Amp we like our shit drop
Straight lowrider, yeah, we do a little ???
Smooth check your hoe, even if I don't know her
And as I enter the door, watch the freaks start callin
The simple fact is (what's up) that we ballin

(I'ma recite a little poetry for y'all
The name of this piece is called) 
Ballin'
(And I want to dedicate this piece to all your players
And all you ladies out there)

Since the breakdown was dope, you can't get enough rappin
I know that it's true, because I seen your hands clappin
Toes tappin, the freaks are jockin
All because the way 187 is rockin
All you busters on the scene
I keep my Locs on because I know you on fiend
Like a spectator, you jock what I'm doin
So sit back and learn, cause it's time for some schoolin
And rulin all the busters on the center
Get off my tip, cause I'm about to enter
This phase (what is it?) that I call the finale
I made it ride higher while I'm ballin through Cali
So listen, I'm finna start dissin
All you Eastside rappers, you had to start pissin
Me off, you're soft, you're finna get tossed
By two boss players who's your dope rhyme sayers
K-oss and Go Mack are the wack-deejay-slayers
You got a beep? We gotta go,cause money is callin
The simple fact is - yeah, that we ballin

And you know
It's like that in 90
And it's gon' stay like that
And once again we have to send it to who?

Above the Law,"Yo, what's happenin, man?
Yo, they tryin to come down on the ATL when whe speak
They say we on a negative tip
What's up?

Now I'ma kick a way-out style that's smoother than usual
It's from Above The Law, so see, it's crucial
Hype beats are kickin and rippin, yo, with a funky touch
It's done the Ruthless way, some say it's too much
D-o-p-e, please don't misdefine it
That's the way that I live and, that's the style of my rhyme
That's on time, just like your watch keeps tickin
(KM.G) on my side, so that my knowledge keeps stickin
Now what's really known as a radio cut?
When you can's say (shit) and you can't say (fuck)
I really think you want to hear it
But the radio stations, you see, they still gonna fear it
Yo, I thought this country was based upon freedom of speech
Freedom of press, freedom of your own religion
To make your own decision, now that's baloney
Cause if I gotta play by your rules, I'm bein phoney
Yo, I got to cater to this person or that person
I got to rhyme for the white or the black person?
Why can't it all be equal?
Music is a universal language for all people
I better get off the rebellious tip
Before somebody out there say I'm startin to slip
I ain't trippin, I'm steadily flowin and throwin
Givin you a dope style
Keepin me on top of the pile
Cause ATL'll soon take over the nation
And if you don't want to hear us, well, change the station
Boo! I sneak in your mind your mind
Sink in your mind, creep from behind
So fast that you won't have time
To deny a brother that's from the streets
Tryin to teach, hopin to reach
Yo, 187's not one that's known to preach
But I wish for each to have freedom of speech

(Congress shall make no law
Respecting an establishment of religion
Or prehibiting the free exercise thereof
Or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press)

They'll milk you to make it understood
They make it good, so that it taste real good
To you, so see, you fall right in it
Your minds are small, they feed you like infants
Like children they'll bring you along
They say we're wrong for makin a rap song
But ATL'll hit you straight up jam after jam
Long as we say what we want, make our stamps, we don't give a damn
Those that want to sell out need to get the fuck out the business
Cause they ain't doin nothin but bluffin
Me, I get wild every rhyme I release
Whether I talk about violence or talk about peace
Cause violence is somethin that happens in society
When people are livin low and don't kow where they can go
But peace, I think we all want peace
But it's too much to face, and it's too far to reach
Whether I say my rhymes fast, slow, sloppy or neat
See, I wish when I'm doin, to have freedom of speech

(Congress shall make no law
Respecting an establishment of religion
Or prehibiting the free exercise thereof
Or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press)

Now if they ban me, I don't give a fuck
Chalk it up as experience (yeah, bad luck)
Because I'm ballin with Laylaw's clout
And if he say that it stays, the shit comes out
Cause in the early days when rap first began
Some fool jumped up and said it soon would end
But nowadays I hear song after song
And it proved to me that the fool was wrong
So yo, cut the bullshit, all set aside
It's time for the people to realize
About the things that happen in the ghetto which those try to hide
When they know we just strive to survive
(The homie said he'd have a job, if you'd give him a break)
But when he gets it (he goes by the other man's ways)
Now see, there's just one more thing I have to talk about
'bout how they say rap music is turnin kids out
You got to give your child credit for what he can do
Plus the way that they're raised is really up to you
Rap music, a form of literature
Words and verbs and adjectives
Painted up like a picture
Yo, it's gonna hitcha, yo, it's gonna getcha
And when I'm all finished up, it's gonna fitcha
(Hittin the nation) station to station (heavy rotation)
So strong that it's keepin the pace, and
We will speak out on any situation
But while we're doin
Yo, we gotta have freedom of speech

Yeah - see, that's how we had to do that
Yo, I gotta give it up to all my homeboys

Yo 187, you gotta let em know what's goin on

[ VERSE 1: Cold 187um ]
See, I'm like a psycho, I meditate with a beat
I add a rhyme, to make it sound complete
I go into a state of mind that I very seldom enter
To put it on a black plate of wax with a hole in the center
Understand, I'm not the greatest
Above the Law is always funky fresh and we will never be the latest
Look at that, we're two steps ahead of you
I just simply get up on the mic and do what some MC's are scared to do
Go for the gusto, if so
Yo, I keep my hat cut low
I'm a friend, not a foe
A pro, as a artist 
Give my hardest as the farthest
That'll take it up the ladder
See, it really doesn't matter
Cause oppositions I will scatter
This I call rhymin, yo, not chitter-chatter
Like Malcolm X, see, I be takin a stand
A man with the plan makin you dance
On the dancefloor, more
Of a new style that's worth your while
It's from Pamona
So you know I had to lay this shit on ya
Hit the switch, then rewind this shit
Grab a 40 ounce and go mack to a bitch
Now ladies - please don't be offended
Because my lifestyle is hustlin, and see, I'm in it to win it

I'm like ballin with the untouchable HBC
Real brothers that are down with me
And if I call on em, you're gonna pay the cost
Because they're puttin out contracts for you to get tossed
Muffled, broke on, we throw you in the river
Cement shoes, so that you sink much quicker
Cause me, I gotta have it, one way or the other

So you don't want to slip or trip or maybe go overboard
You can't afford to ignore this style
Above the Law steady housin em, change the dial
I don't smile, I always keep a serious face
So if this beat is that funky, why don't you pump up the bass?
And fall into the groove like you're supposed to
But not too deep, because we got another show to do
This is dedicated to my brothers and sisters
The white, the black, and all the hip-hop listeners
One nation stayin under a groove
Above the Law's pure in it to win it, we don't lose
I'm not a new jack that smoke crack, don't play me like one
87's got the power, if you want to, come get some, son
I think your status is weak, you'll never compete
But I don't have to sweat it, cause my posse's just too deep
Yeah, we kick ass and take names and remain the same
We live large while you sit and complain

But back to the subject of rockin and jockin

Makin you hot, so hot you want to drop to your knees

Goin out to my deejay K-oss and Go Mack",Just Kickin' Lyrics,1990
Above the Law,"experience, so you know it's gonna be some mega shit, so who is that 

(KM.G) 
KM.G will never be a trick 
Step up to the mic like a baller then I pimp this gift 
That only I possess 
I illustrated that way to get the shit off my chest 
I'm ghetto raise to amaze the crowd, it's quite simple 
Km.G has degrees from Unity of South Central 
I'm a graduate and it's all legit 
From the pimping, the ballin' and all that good shit 
I have the mega balls in which I speak in a slang 
While I'm peeking it wit the G's from the Ruthless gang 
Ain't nuttin change but the weather like I said before 
'Cause I'm living like hustlers and I'm checking galore 
Yo, I have to give it up to the D.O.C. 
A Ruthless brother who's down wit the KM.G 
So all hail to the niggas that's turning it out 
And maybe then, I'll take the gun barrel out of your mouth 

Knowledge from one generation to another, perserve 
and then transmitted, get it, done the Ruthless way, 
You know what I'm saying, so what's up Dre 

(Dr. Dre) 
Now I'm a swinger, I'm not a muthafuking singer 
But I bringa melody that always seems to ring a 
Bell as well, let's make it so you can tell 
Yo, it's coming from Compton where the ballers dwell 
'Cause I'm Dre, the muthafuking doctor causing propaganda 
When I'm on the mic, I demand a 
Little bit of time to express myself 
From ?(cedian)? wax, kicking the facts and it's like that 
A nigga wit a muthafuking attitude 
You know the deal, kicking some real shit 
And if a sucker ever thinks he can get some 
Yo, step off, I'm kicking lyrics for the deaf and the dumb 
But any occasion, getting the bitches wit the mega persuasion 
Then my dick starts top make an invasion 
But, yo, I can't go on 
Because this is the end of my part on the last song 

Real G from the streets, villianous when he speaks 
For all you busters who can't deal, give it up for real 

(MC Ren) 
Now when you see me, you're ducking and slipping, yo, then you fell
down 
You fucked up and finally figured who was the cell down 
Pulling the pulls, crotching the bull 
The weak muthafuker was smelling like shit so I guess that they're full 
Of it, and I love it when I dress like a crook 
Wit a ""I don't give a fuck"" look 
The villain was something nuff like a hero 
Jacking all the niggas wit beef, off of relief, I mean the zeros 
The rest of the 100% was sent to do what I say 
NWA and ATL and we don't play 
The DOC is doing it, oh, so correctly 
See, I broke it down for the ones who try to check me 
But I can't be check 'cause I'm the checker 
When you see a nigga wreck believe that I'm the wrecker 
The right and for the fight and the left will attend 
We're doing wrong, MC Ren is on the last song 

From a genius to temporary insanity, the ganster's dream 
The bitches fanasty, Ruthless, so now we've come to the payoff 

(Eazy-E) 
One muthafuking two muthafuking three 
It's the hip-hop thugster Eazy-E 
So I grab the mic and then I clear my throat 
First nigga kicking lyrics in a straightcoat 
It's Eazy for me to come off like this 
So you can kiss my ass where the sun rays miss 
Or just give me the pussy and I'll be straight 
And if you don't, fuck it, I'll masterbate 
(We wanta fuck you Eazy) yea, you bitches scream 
Now bow down and praise the lord for the wing ding 
I got skill to deal and run game on bitches 
You can tell that I'm sick by the triple sixes 
I hear voices in my head for what reason 
But when the talking stops (pow) it's drive by season 
So back the fuck off and give me respect 
Now they're shipping me off 'cause Eazy played wit a half deck 

Criminal in his thoughts, murderous in his lyrics 
The notorious Cold 

(Cold 187um) 
187um, you know I gotta have it 
Now being above the law is an everyday habit 
If you think I drop some pimp shit, I ain't 
Perhaps I'll say a couple rhymes to make the bitches faint 
Now everybody wants to chill, ill 
And bill, now what the fuck is the deal 
You need a nigga like me to get the shit going 
187um has got the ultimate flowing 
Now it's time for me to go off like a maniac 
Run up for cover 'cause I'm on the ?(adidnac)? 
An untouchable player rolled up into one mind 
87 reasons why fools staying in line 
'Cause I ain't the average nigga behind the trigger 
I lay and spray anything in my way 
'Cause I'm a balls player for the streets of South Central 
believe what you want but soon you'll eventually see 
That ATL is straight to mega 
Don't be surprise 'cause we played ya like Sega 
And these bodies keep dropping, you see me keep moving on 
Peace, I'm outta here 'cause this is the last song

Above the Law,"We for breakin backs in the 9-4, time to play a hoe
Like we never did before
Since the prices went up for a piece a ass
See I still get freebies cause I got gap
And when it comes to the question
""What have you done for me lately?""
Yo, G, I make them bitches hate me

So grab ya coat, grab ya hat, cause its like that
Ya try and play the role and ain't nothin but a hood rat
So don't front yeah you're names Terri not Halle
But you sprung like a motherfucker when I
Hit that berry and let a hoe know what's poppin
Cause it comes with the territory when you come a jockey

Everything will be all right
Everything will be all right
Everything will be all right

Yeah I'm in the mood I need a hoe with much aptitude
To creep wicked, to come kick it
With the P-I-M-P, pimp clinic number 1
Ya say I ain't shit but cha sprung
But ya holds the number then folds the number
Then ya crawls to my house for a late night slumber

Yeah cause bitches in the 90s ain't shit
They claim that they a lady steady suckin every other niggaz dick
So now you at my house on my couch screamin out
My name, my status and my motherfuckin clout
""And ya nigga don't know what's goin on""
Cause he always broke and he always gone
Now people might say that I am scandlous
But it ain't my fault if a bitch can't handle this

Now I just had lit a flya show
I bumped up so I gotta spit at the hoe
Yeah she bound to let me smoke but make no mistake
I gotta 8 year bid next day for a rape
Owww, actin like crows
And ya wonder why we call ya bitches and skeezas and hoes

Yeah, she shoulda used the fuckin mase
Tryin to come up on the homie cause the county check was late
Uh, that's the problem with you bitches now-a-days
Since you drop a couple a babies think you kickin it and gettin paid
I waitin for Mr. Timesalt
So he can pull yo fuckin creep up, and pay my fuckin bills off

I only speak of what I've been through best believe I've been around
From the pimp clinic, hip, keep ya veins in ya fuckin mouth
Bitches used to treat me like a bowl of onion soup
Now they gettin tossed on the hood of my Lexus Coupe
I keep clownin as you hoes cause you boos
I got the hat, the nose, and the motherfuckin funny shoes

I clown on the witness I kick this
Bookers in my business, know that I'm attracted to the bomb
And ya know the thing is ones around that like to play
And hit you up with that ass with no delay
Shit, I learned hoes like takin off they clothes
When them 100 dollar bills is on the flo' really doe

Above the Law,"They all are yellin' out freeze
As I'm on these backstreets gettin' mine
Dodgin' the law, dodgin' it sublime
And if you feel me, I'm a keep it real for this episode

Makin' you raw and do some critical overload
What must I do to live in the City of Angels?
Like a fucker, who unclockin' the chamber
'Cause it remains to be the same to me
I gotta be an OG like my daddy and my grand peppy

Don't ever touch mine, don't ever disrespect mine
Better get out to protect in case you ever cross the line
Yo, I'm like the crow, no dumb birdy
As I handle my business and as I take you on the journey

It ain't no City of the Angels, brother Mack
It's just people playin' get back and more get back
Yo, a lotta drama on my block, but I never stress
Because I'm build like a Presidential Rolex

A lotta people got over the red, over the blue
A lotta people hustle 'cause they got to
But if I ever go out before I'm supposed to go
I'm gonna revenge myself like The Crow

L.A. is sure a crazy ass place to stay
Where the riders ride and the players play

L.A. is sure a crazy ass place to stay
Where the riders ride and the players play
I've been around the world and around the way
24-7 like everyday

I see the clock struck half past
I'm movin' fast with a blast
I'm like an angel in the city with the devil's path
And everybody's out to get me
So I quickly stick and move
And if he moves I trip, my fingers itch

I got a vision, I'm on a mission, listen
I can hear 'em, but I can't trust my intuition
I'm wishin' upon that midnight mystical
And through the darkness I'm hopin' for a miracle

I can't holler 'till you hear me
I gotta get me through the madness
Even though I'm guilty
And as I reload I'm all alone, set to explode
Like an unlogical murderer that's in the zone

I know they workin', the spirit's lurkin', I'm hurtin'
The triple six with the kiss got my soul searchin'
Then I woke and I choked on a cloud of smoke
It was a dream and in my dream I'd seen a black crow

Another day in L.A. comes to an end
The dark of the night starts to set in
Lots of deals goin' down under the city lights

Welcome to the city of drag where my pants sag
And the homies still relyin' on the flag
Yeah, life starts to twist and turn
Then they hit you at another angle
Just some more drama in the City of Angels

Violence is brought forth too many years
Fuckin' memories, we cried so many tears
Oh, the devil plays the repo man
And he's suckin' up souls as fast as he can

It's no question, it's in our nature
A .45 brings out the criminal behavior
When the clouds in the sky turn black and gloom
As soon as the smoke starts to fill the room

Your heart starts to beat, it's like a ritual
And the feelin' that you get is somewhat spiritual
I'm a have to let you know how reality go
Learn to fly like The Crow as you slide into limbo

Yeah, we taking our time, ''cause patience is a virtue 
Plus we ain't in a hurry to motherfuckin' hurtcha,P 
We checked in date of 1989 
Intertwined with some chips to sign 
On the little dotted line 
It was lovely and the DeNiro was clean 
Different from the crack money, but green was green 
Fresh on the scene, niggas didn't know the time, we enterprising 
But never realising how the criming and the rhyming would twist 
And make a hell of a mix 
Had the neighbourhood fiending like some junkies before a fix 
Halfa Cali came to get with the source 
They did after we down, players could have they own choice 
Either rap singing, or even street singing, 
It didn't make a difference, long as the funk you're bringing 
Everybody's down with the Pimp Clinic 
But all they wanted was a piece, piece of the streets 
And we be all up in that ass with the quickness, 
The thickness, yeah 
Funkin the set from here to the east 
This is a player thing, this ain't no fucking bullshit 
Because we pull shit 
My name is KMG, I'm from the Clinic and the Park 
You either get glocked in the dark, or get sparked

I put the see in the controversy in the industry

I deal with new jacks on a waayy out basis 
I put it down with the true crew 
We leaving player haters mesmerised when we trip through 
(KMG: ""How many suckas you know?"") 
Well, I know a whole truck full, 
I'm trying to stay two steps ahead of any bullshit they tryin to pull 
Motherfuckers claim they hard, 
And put in half the work, and did half the dirt 
Ain't even from the dirt 
What I would do if I was you is shut your fuckin' mouth 
''cause we be moving keys while you're playin house 
I'm the original rap murderer 
See, I can beat your ass, rock the mic 
Or fuck your girl on a good night

I represent the real niggas, daddy, who ride with me

Now I'm in the twist after goin' on a mission
Gotta spit at my homeys though - you know my peoples
Yeah the ones in the hill plus the folks in the hood - we all equal
I was talkin to my partner the other day
We was sitting in the mall parking lot
He was bout to serve three chicken wings
He said ""shit ain't changed, homey, shit ain't changed""
So uh, strap for strap even though I rap
Ain't know way in the hell I can watch my own back
So I got my brother on the right and my brother on the left
One in a khaki suit, the other one well dressed

Too much caviar, put holes through ya, lick you thorough your radar
See I'm pistol whipping clicks with my lyrics
I'm on a cheddar run so my family benefits

Twelve playas, way, beyond control

Keep trust in God with mob niggas in my enterouge. 
You see that's why could be for broads, 
I learned that from my pops when we used to mob the eldora-do, 
Through the muthafuckin' projects, I guess it's in my blood, 
Sometimes it seems like i'm next, to be a thug. 
And end up selling drugs like my father, 
Or like my partner on the block, man, when I holler, squattin impalas 
Slanging rocks, man, it don't stop,

Above the Law,"Hehehe, these are my words to my first born..

Can you picture, young n****z in a rush to grow
Til hard timers in the pen, had to crush his throat
Probably never even saw it comin', too busy bulls***tin'
Caught him with his mouth runnin' ain't this a b****
They got me twisted in this game
The feds and the punk, po-lice pointin' pistols at my brain
I wonder if I'm wrong cause I'm thugged out
My homies murdered execution style runnin' in the drug house
What was supposed to be a easy hit, now s*** is flipped
Cause n****s died over bulls***, it's not my dream
I'm seein' pictures of a broken man, no witnesses
Only the questions of who smoked the man, young adolescents
In our prime live a life of crime, though it ain't logical
We hobble through these tryin' times, livin' blind
Lord help me with my troubled soul
Why all my homies had to die 'fore they got to grow?
And right before I put my head on the pillow, say a prayer one love
To the thugs in heaven I'll see you there
It's written for the young and dumb that wasn't warned
Help you make it through the storm
My words to my first born, feel me

My words to my first born
My words to my first born

Since my very first day on this earth, I was cursed
So I knew, that the birth of a child would make my life worse
And though it hurt me there was no distortion
Cause wild seeds can't grow, we need more abortions
Quiet your soul, cause you know what you had to do
And so did victims of a world they never came to
I understand it's a better day comin'
Sometimes cats be sleepin' on the dead end
Drivin' with the car runnin' blinded
Ain't no love in the hood only hearts torn
Love letters to the innocent and unborn
All the babies that died up on the table
Wasn't able to breathe, cause the family wasn't able
Can't, blame her I would do the same
All I could give it was my debt and my last name
Cause in the game things change livin' up and down
This hard life got me walkin' with my head down
Flashin' frowns wasn't meant to be, was I wrong?
But I'll never get to know, so I carry on
It's written for the young and dumb that wasn't born
My words to my first born, feel me

My words to my first born
Mm! (Yeah) These are the words to my first born
Hey n**** talk to your born, talk to your seed n****

Two thousand somethin somethin it's a new era
A n****'s too real, now see s*** too clear
See there's more than just this scrilla and this tilt
(What else is it dawg?)
The velvet and the silk, and makin' sure my kittens got they milk
(Hoo!) Gotta fill this mattress, let my kids know I'm at this
Attack this, the Mack must roll, hood stroll
Ain't no question is it? Above the Law hustlers
If it's related to chips, homey we'll handle ya

Yo,
Although we never take advantage though we always into ery'thang
By all means, stack green, gangsta lean
They say money make the world go 'round
So only 'ssociate yourself with paper chasers
And n****z that's truly down, and keep God first
And give thanks for the good times, as well as when it hurts
It's player haters every corner you hit
Touchin their tits, hella thick, tryin to get you for yo' grip
I know you stressed out and fed up
But come out, gun-blazin, and keep yo' head up
You can call it what you want to but it ain't gon' change

And we done lived a long hard life
And we done shed so many tears under these bright lights
Y'all, although we grew up, corrupted and scorned
We still got a lot of wisdom, to give to our first born

What you gon' tell your kids n****?
Who was you? What was you doin? How did you put it down?
These my words to my motherf***in' first born
So they can know, why'knahmean? He he he

Abra Moore,"When the past won't let you, leave behind all your yesterday


Remember times when you never could find that perfect word to say
Now your mind won't forget him,and the latest song just brings you down, down...
Remember your boy from the neighborhood, that sidewalk-smiling run around





You don't know why you're crying, and you don't know why you're dying inside

It seems the past won't let you ever fall in love again
It's time you let him go, for somebody that cares



Does he say he loves you, and does he play to win?

And does he leave a light on, when you're late getting in?




Now you can't keep leaving, trying to run from your feelings again

It seems your mind won't forget that undecided love affair

It's time you let him go, let him go, let him go, for somebody that cares


Does he say he loves you, and does he play to win?

Does he leave the light on when you're late getting in?

Day?



",Somebody That Cares,1995

He don't care
He's got them angels from below, they'll keep his time
Ever true 
Time isn't after you

You can't hold on to it or keep pushing away
Just sitting around in your wishing well
Paint a wish for you, paint a wish for me just the same

She don't care
She's got them angels from below, they'll keep her words
Ever true 
Speak to me in the way that you do
And I could be taken back to the days of that old jacket

Push me in your way, and you hold me down
You hold me, hold me, hold me

The lightning pushes on through the air
We don't care

Sometimes it goes up, sometimes we go down
Sometimes we just don't know what to feel

Tipping the bottle, leaving our heads spinning 
Clinging tight now under the noonday sun 

You won't let me go free

Abracadabra,"They passed me by, all of those great romances
You were, I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances
My picture clear, everything seemed so easy
And so I dealt you the blow
One of us had to go
Now it's different, I want you to know

One of us is crying
One of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
One of us is lonely
One of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all

I saw myself as a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action
Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving
That's how I started the show
One of us had to go
Now I've changed and I want you to know

One of us is crying
One of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
One of us is lonely
One of us is only
Waiting for a call

Abracadabra,"I don't wanna talk about things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me, now it's history
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play
The winner takes it all
The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny
 
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense, building me a fence
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool, playing by the rules
The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here loses someone dear
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you
Does it feel the same when she calls your name
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed
The judges will decide the likes of me abide
Spectators of the show always staying low
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all

And I understand you've come to shake my hand
I apologize if it makes you feel bad seeing me so tense, no self confidence",The Winner Takes It All,1994

I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me

How I hate to spend the evening on my own

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

People care for nothing, no respect for human rights
Evil times are coming, we are in for darker nights""

I said, ""Who are you to talk about impending doom?""
He got kinda wary as he looked around the room
He said, ""I'm a minister, a big shot in the state""
I said, ""I just can't believe it, boy I think it's great

Brother can you tell me what is right and what is wrong?""

Over in the corner I could see this other guy
He was kinda flirty, he was giving me the eye
So I took advantage of the fact that I'm a star
Shook my hair and took a casual stroll up to the bar
And as sure as hell this guy was coming up to me

He said, ""Who am I and who are you and who are we?
What's our situation, do we have some time for us?""
I said I was not exactly waiting for the bus
He said, ""If you're going somewhere can I come along?""

Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
One of us is lonely
One of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all

I saw myself as a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action
Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving

Abraham Burton,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,1997

It's telling me it might be you

Wondering how they met and what makes it last.

If I found the place,
Would I recognize the face?

Yeah, it's telling me it might be you.

So many quiet walks to take
So many dreams to wake
And we've so much love to make

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

Quiero un mundo sin fronteras, sin banderas
Sin soldados disparando en las trincheras 
A otros hombres asustados bajo leyes 
De gobiernos pacifistas disfrazados 
Con oscuras ambiciones y sus cuentos tan baratos
Quiero un mundo sin mentiras 
Que nos cuelan a diario poderosos que permiten 
Que se mueran mientras tanto

Sin escuela, medicinas, alimentos
Desahuciados alimentan la carrera de armamentos con descaro
(quiero un mundo sin prejuicios, sin racismo, más humano
Siendo todos tan iguales, el moreno y el más claro
El que nace en esta tierra o el que llega de otro lado
El que piensa de otra forma siempre a todos respetando
Quiero un mundo dibujado con palomas de picasso
Con canciones de john lennon en la punta de los labios
Con claveles en la boca de fusiles recortados
Con paisajes en los ojos de ese cielo limpio y claro
Quiero un mundo sin los bosques por incendios arrasados 
Por los turbios intereses de unos cuantos desalmados
Sin basura sobre el agua de los ríos 
Que otros cuantos van vertiendo por 
Negocios sin remedio a su paso)

Eres dueño de tu cuerpo 
Y yo sigo siendo el mismo que va en busca de tu amor 
Antes no podía ver 
Ya que me quite las vendas veo que mueres por él 

Y si te vas 
Quien me dará 
Todo lo que siempre soñé 
Quien le dirá al corazón 
Que jamás nunca te tendré 

Quisiera tenerte en cada primavera 
Poder amarte a mi manera 
Y no dormir la noche entera 
Cuidar tus sueños así quisiera 

Obsequiarte cada segundo 
Y a su guión borrar un punto
Para añadirme en él 
Y así por siempre estar juntos 

Cómo explicarte lo que siento 
Me estoy enloqueciendo
El doctor me recetó 
Un poquito de tu afecto y no estás
Eres la cura de mi enfermedad
El caso parece de gravedad
Y venga mi princesa que el tiempo no regresa
Y yo por ti pongo el mundo de cabeza
Rosas, chocolate quiero regalarte
Un millón de besos tengo para darte

Y si te vas 
Quien me dará 
Todo lo que siempre soñé 
Quien le dirá al corazón 
Que jamás nunca te tendré 

Quisiera tenerte en cada primavera 
Poder amarte a mi manera 
Desvelarme la noche entera 
Cuidar tus sueños así quisiera 

Obsequiarte cada segundo 
Y a su guión borrar un punto
Para añadirme en él 
Y así por siempre estar juntos 

Yo tengo una mil y una razón para que no te vayas
Si me dejas voy a anclarte el corazón
Que si yo admiro cada uno de tus besos
Y en la noche entregarte el universo
Todos los días es catorce de febrero
Cada mañana recordarte que te quiero

Y si te vas 
Quien me dará 
Todo lo que siempre soñé 
Quien le dirá al corazón 
Que jamás nunca te tendré 

Quisiera tenerte en cada primavera 
Poder amarte a mi manera 
Desvelarme la noche entera 
Cuidar tus sueños así quisiera

why me siento bien no me quejare vine a celebrar que tu ya te haz marchado pero en realidad vamos a brindar por el gran papel de niña buena que habías jugado.
Why pensar que yo creí en tu amor hoy me he dado cuenta que yo estaba tan equivocado.
Brindo por mi donde quiera que estés, ya no encontrarás quien te haga mujer.
Why hoy levanto mi copa por ti baby (uoo uooo)
Ya no voy a llorar nunca por ti baby (ya no llorare por ti)
Why este trago de olvido es por ti baby (uooaaaaaa uooooaaaaaa)

Levanta la mano si quieres brindar
Que diga su madre por ya no esta
Levanta tu copa para celebrar
Esa traicionera ya no volverá why voy a tomar me voy a embriagar porque ya no tengo que aguantar a quien me este mintiendo si estoy bebiendo porque estoy contento why se que no existe el dolor que hoy siento.

why hoy levanto mi copa por ti baby (uoo uooo)
Ya no voy a llorar nunca por ti baby (ya no llorare por ti)
Why este trago de olvido es por ti baby (uooaaaaaa uooooaaaaaa)

Si lo sabe Dios que lo sepa todo el mundo (Zaaaa)

why hoy levanto mi copa por ti baby (uoo uooo)
Ya no voy a llorar nunca por ti baby (ya no llorare por ti)

the story had never been told until now
as the glory of the kingdom come comes down
disguised as a janitor the washman
i swept and mopped the floors
better yet i was a spook behind the door
w/a perfect view from the bannister
feeling like Lee Harvey
'cept i got a hundred million years in me
first thing i did was aim
lock him in my scope
squeeze
bust his melon open now i'm pleased 
in the name of MC's
already passed the time that they allotted me
the housekeeper spotted me
it was either her or me
click clack
she says i will not say what i see
but i never could have trusted her so i busted her in her chest
then laughed
then headed for the elevator shaft
but it was too late the jig was up
there was pigs all in the building
so i tried to escape to the fire escape from homicide
yeah i killed him
hangin' from the third story ladder 
i dropped and i felt my ankle shatter
no time to lose juice from my bladder
my mission was completed and that was all that mattered
the van was parked a hundred yards from the scene of the crime
but it was hard to run w/a broken foot
just like i thought they blasted
i took one to the gut
i was laying there thinkin' about death
just watchin' my blood spill out
just then the van pulls up and i jump in
and then we pull out (?lickin'?) shouts for the glory

we come for the glory of the be	-boy kingdom
bring them laughter after which bring them tears

i walk in like a normal black
gun peckin' jaw snatching 
slide
they like the way i glide
to the back break out my backpack and stack my shit up
ah it's bulging now
looked around heard a gun shot
pow
i looked down I whipped out my shit
unloaded my clip
jetting by the count i slipped 
tripped out
landed on my hip crawled out
i hit a tuck and roll up and out
into a flip and boned out now i'm zonin'
I'm nine glocks and seven 380's richer

Better watch your table manners boy and give me room
I'm servin' shit constantly tune
And laughin' like a ticklish baboon
On the way to the moon w/a stick and a broom
And the cream of the crop hip hop cause we be
Crackin' the whip on the poppin' be pimpin' the whole punk block
At the junk shop

Sloppin' the side of a pig pen with the grape ape baboon
Wanna see this jack o'lantern panted planted ball that don't bounce
Against the wall like you think
Well thanks but no thanks
Pranks or no pranks

See I engineered it I geared it I steered it
I took it to the whole world and everybody cheered it
I hauled it I yes y'all'ed it and they feared it
I called it I outlawed it and they cleared it
Now I am I and it is it and that's that
But ain't that a bitch

Bumped into my main man Ganjah K

I took a hit and a half and got high and a hey
My coconut was mellow but my vision was gray
Looked on the dance floor and I seen my DJ
Cool hands Kiilu Grand he knows what to play
So we headed for the booth to get the party on the way
Walkin' through the crowd I heard somebody say hey
It was Mikah 9 he said what up double A
Tryin' to make my pay tryin' not to stray
But you know my forte I let a sleepin' dog lay

We on that old missin' link
In between the baboon and the common man
They don't understand tho
They ain't even tryin' to know

I and I echo with old sentiments
Rudimentary tenements
House reverberates
Richochets to small invertebrates
Even all these spineless jellyfish
Rhyme-less bass with no taste jazz
Enthusiastic spastic hemophiliacs
Memorabilia or acting siliac sense(less)milia
Minature expenditures
Spine tingling adventures
Keenly architechtures
Of a lecture
That blockade and bust dental caps and dentures
Hey! let's start a new business venture
No you're not dreaming i'll be the Pincher
The millimeter by millimeter Doberman Bull Mastiff mix
Where Rottweiler while a rhyme of
Graffiti traffic autobiographic
Ethnic cleansing benzing lacing
Culture oscars inch by inch Deans and Costners
Who foster my rhythmic memories
Collectible sacks of my Mossberg and telebeam
Scope enemies with enemas

Which side of me whom you might see 
Be careful what you ask for 
That's no lie sometimes we Just don't know why

Why do I do it like I do 
How come I don't get in trouble like I use to 
Why am I the last thing a girl understands 
I'm just like the rest tryin to get inside her pants 
Why don't I go and blow half the advance 
Buy a couple cars in my mom's minivan 
How come all I want to do is make beats 
And eat like a pig eatin anything with cheese 
How come I don't talk about MC's 
I don't talk about much anyway see 
There ain't a lot to say when you said it all before 
So I'm gonna let the homey's come 
And tell you about some more

[Prevail] 

Yo, We need no introductions mention the relentless 
Why does my foe compare to those swing wrenches 
Why do I believe that you control your own destiny 
Why wreck like psyclonlum my voice tone a sympathy 
Grind down the bones separate the ligaments 
Why do I demonstrate how you could die from ignorance 
Its like drifting through the twilight zone 
I'm'ma highlight the parts that I think you should be shown 
Why you want to know how darkness feels 
I split your carcass in two parts like you ain't real 
I'm beyond that's the law just in grandest scale 
You're my target my hand is steady as hell 
I prevail on scales like betoveen 
The mike in my hand conducts the same ocean 
Why do I slice precise like Jack the ripper 
Trip around dressed in black and slash you quicker

How come I don't use soap I sit in the bath cup of coffee 
Have a couple smokes I don't know any jokes 
All though I heard a ton of them I can't member none of them 
How come ever time I hang out with my friends 
I make fun of them hate the way I act when I'm drunk 
But I drink insensitive invent the tension 
I don't think you couldn't bench press my stress this shit weighs a ton 
You couldn't shock me with a taser gun 
Nothing surprise me my whole tribes lively 
I got anger and confusion standing right beside me 
That's why when I'm alone at home I'm not lonely 
Please do not drop by do not phone me 
Might be crazy but at least I'm not phony 
How come I don't follow trends got my own visions 
How come I don't try and talk to myself I won't listen, 
Why have I absorb this morbid war torpid 
I can't let go of this pain torture torment

And be resourceful, and keep achievin'

It's not a problem that I can't fix
'cause I can do it with my bag of tricks
they're playing for keeps and for kicks
but they're building with popsicle sticks instead of bricks
the time ticks, the atmosphere gets thick
I breathe in, it makes me sick to my stomach
if you got any kind of fix I want it
sometimes I think the attic's haunted
but it's not, it's just me
so I keep strutting and keep pushing my buttons
but I'm not about to be pushed over the edge
I made this pledge
not by you, my brother or by Sister Sledge
now I know that I'm not your boss
and I'm not trying to floss or come across lost
I wipe the frost until the glass is clear
and I exhaust the possibilities of showing fear
'cause the bigger the scare, the heavier the tear
and the wetter the drop and then you flood the crops
and we just don't want to be flooded
we cut it when we can't cut it we strutted we stay budded up
we keep it up and cut it up until we gotta shut up

It ain't a lunch time I like to miss
I ain't a punch line type lyricist
and if you had beef you'd fight with your fists
my people suffer from lack of knowledge and righteousness
streets so wild we developed a frown
and a keen sense for knowing when it's going down
play it cool
say some shit that surprise me, my face don't change
serious 'bout them chips like a poker game
I come frequently like these Oakland trains
I freestyled it in a show and never wrote it the same
Aaron Pointer came to reign and say something
Eddie Hayes stays a little ways from me
the west side combination is legendary
home studios, cause by any means necessary
completed projects is my productivity
gimme food smoke and electricity
and if the power is ever cut off
I got a generator up in the loft
to stay energized, my music finds a way
to survive through the times and with the kinds today
L.A., what a wild place to be
styles by Ab, Mike Troy, and A.C.E.

Mikah 9:
Indeed, indeed, Haiku De Tat what we could do witcha'
men at peace for y'all to call entities 
quicker on the draw the sickest thing that you ever saw
so for all our trees grow and grows in my backyard
remember me, sometimes I like to act hard
that's just it, it's an act but don't confuse that
if you choose to chit chat with a mack fully packed
you're bruised, black, blue and blurple
you'd never get a chance to bust back
I don't have to be rappin' or dancin' in a circle
to make the people react
I could be enjoying the be	-boying
I'm already on the map and made my money living fat
no need to profile and flash stacks
I'm way past that
Master Card and a little cash for snacks
munchies, after partaking from breaking nugs
down out of fat bud stash stacks
ahh, I do my floor work on linoleum
exploring the crevices of my woman's ass crack
I rhymin' in the SF studio on Napoleon
and I really love this jazz track
I'm running game now I'mma win
I'm on my last lap
you want to dance with me?
fast tap chance jacking for ASCAPs, checks, advance
and that's wack, I mash back

do what you do to live life lavish
have this cabbage, heavy baggage

[Aceyalone]
Well I would like to start by saying
life has to be sparked each day
and night, got to be smart don't play
your time, you won't be back
when I speak I slice the words up like a slasher
private party crasher, dasher, rational thinker
sparkle a twinkle, third eye glimmer
sky swimmer
I like to let it simmer 'til the lights get dimmer
and I like talking about dilemma
and come up with a solution for the pollution
my contribution being the superior being at emceeing
and seeing the light love being in the light
but they snatch it like a thief in the night

[Mikah 9]
(right, right, you know what I mean)
I call them the cookie monsters
on the grind for these Entemanns, Chips-A-Hoy
combined with M&Ms, money, main
these be	-Boys prosper posture on top of the roster exposed impostor
send him in, rendering him limb and limb
salted wounded, squeezing a little lemon in
torture sounding from drowning porter subjects surrendering
my tender and remembering the splendor when
I put my first splinter in nail 
cuticle, black male
and you and yo honey giving skully to Clinton insider her cubicle
checks not cash knots
she also gotta keester half this poultry up that twat
the rest will go up to other how's tickling the G-spot
on G.P. you could D.P. the sales manager and the VP
you could smuggle me a key
I best belive that's how it be
just smoke this weed and leave with all the homies

[Abstract Rude]
Out the hotel
ain't we having a car come pick us up?
the life of a star come hook us up
studios, stages and the streets, bomb beats
pages of loose leaf, blazing the keef
courageous, the truth speaks louder than lies
so when they hear you style they be proud of you guys
search from land to land
go from a thousand to a hundred to ten
and couldn't find an honest man
it ain't always what it's promised to be
they don't stop until the thirty third and a third degree
shhh... can you keep a secret? of course
or yell it loud 'til your voice hoarse
out the airport
and we having a plane fly us out
we the truest, they interview us for what we write about
whether we're right or wrong
once again it's on 'til the night is gone
get in a zone from the dome and a tight song

[Aceyalone]
Well life just ain't sugary and buttery, is it?
now what, are we fooling ourselves thinking that it is?
I'm thinking that these kids need to know it from the jump
and be it that I'm a poet trying to get over the hump
I could play it like a trump
make you sicker than the mumps
the days come hella fast and the money comes in clumps
and sometimes it don't come at all
you run you fall come one for all for one
depending on exactly where you from
'cause the only way to be immortalized to be organized
and be able to be mobilized and look over the skies
I speak for an Overise and I stand for the universe
and freedom of man original with the tan
can I expand? can I feel the crowd?
if you don't want me to touch you then, uhh, speak up now
yeah, I keep my eyes on the owl and the sparrow
and the eagle and the hawk
They say why you talk that crazy talk
I tell 'em ""we see what your eyes can't see""
on me, ""we hear what ears can't hear""
poetry we can be what nobody can be
solely the only lonely truly

We came up learned those ways living in a time 
when raps and shows paid trifling days everybody
got to eat but we all need food for thought
caught up in a real live struggle to the grave
some are just sick cause they want to' be saved 
by the preacher man but 
I'm ah reach you men open them up way back when
African we was still rappin and beating on skins
what the people say gotta' shed a little bit of light
my insides is a beauty that is way beyond comparison
and I just want to share it all with you

Let your mind be free let your heart and your soul 
Just grow and let your life succeed as you wind on down the road
and let it be open your eyes so you see
open up your ears and what appears it's something true and clear
and I hear transprojection is love metaphysically here it is
I'll keep it in my soul, so I will show no fear were transmitted
I'm loud and clear as for those who see the light
behind the rhymes of Mikah 9 they know the time
And I see you and you make it through some of you don't hear me
All I can say is it's all love and that's the way it gotta be
Must we rob, rape, and murder one another for eternity?
As concerned to me
I would much rather we try to help each other
Allthe way down the road but almost every time I turn around
I hear the sound of bullet rounds fly through air
I'm well aware we're not prepared to
have conversation with celestial anatomy 
of Hereon and day by day we study in astronomy
and converse in astrology and Hereon
Live my days so let's partake so let's all take flight
We used to love light to guide your way through fright
and all of those spy satellites
It's called love, my friend
I must transcend on wish and waggle will
and this is where my story ends

But when the music changed the plan was rearranged.
He went to dance with someone else.

We started dancing and love put us into a groove.
But now he's with somebody new.
What does love want me to do?

Love said, ""Let the music play. He won't get away.
Just keep the groove and then he'll come back to you again.
Let the music play. He won't get away.
This groove he can't ignore and he won't leave you anymore.""

He's dancing his way back to me

Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
[Chorus]
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town",Santa Claus Is Coming to Town,2005
Abysm,"A couple of years
And I'm gonna know your name
It's like I waited for ya forever
And I know this might sound insane
But it won't be long
'Til we're gonna take this up
I'm talking about our future love

You're so far away
Maybe you're right next door
Got me picturing your face again
Something worth waiting for
I put all the others behind me
They don't live up
I know what I want
What I need to the T

Baby if they asked me
I would say I don't even know you're name
And if they asked me
Does it change?
No, it don't change a thing
'cause there's something about the way you'll love me
There's just something about the way you'll know me
That I can't explain enough
There's just something about our
Future love 
There's just something about our
Future love 

Walking hand in hand
Going for a second date
I can picture what you're wearing
And a kiss I can almost taste
The thought of all the ways we'll meet for the very first time
I can see the place, feel the love
First sight

Oh no
The minute you pull up next to me
We standing there like destiny
When it feels like you're fighting
Just to breathe that's when you know
The minute I pull up next to you
Suddenly I don't know what to do
Everything inside you says that I'm the one",Future Love,2006

Abyss,"Sunday morning, very bright, I read Your book by colored light
That came in through the pretty window picture.

I visited some houses where they said that You were living
And they talked a lot about You
And they spoke about Your giving.
They passed a basket with some envelopes;
I just had time to write a note
And all it said was ""I believe in You.""

Passing conversations where they mentioned Your existence
And the fact that You had been replaced by Your assistants.
The discussion was theology,
And when they smiled and turned to me
All that I could say was ""I believe in You.""

I visited Your house again on Christmas or Thanksgiving
And a balded man said You were dead,
But the house would go on living.
He recited poetry and as he saw me stand to leave
He shook his head and said I'd never find You.

My mother used to dress me up,
And while my dad was sleeping
We would walk down to Your house without speaking.",The Hymn,2001
Abyss,"I can only give you love that lasts forever,
And the promise to be near each time you call,
And the only heart I own is yours and yours alone, that's all, that's all.
I can only give you country walks in springtime,
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.
If you're wond'ring what I'm asking in return, dear,
You'll be glad to know that my demands are small.
Say it's me that you'll adore for now and ever more, that's all, that's all.",I Miss You,2006

I don't need a job and I don't need no friends
People bore me to the end I wish that I were dead
All this stench that fills the air reminds me of the dump
And when I turn on my tv, the fuckin' Brady Bunch
The cluelessness of middle class is what I'm living for
In San Jose there's too many dicks, it's a bore, a bore
My parents are getting stressed, just give my ears a rest
I wake in time to go to school to take another test
No more
It's such a total waste, don't worry about me I'll set my own pace.

I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
No one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""

Labour's waiting, in silent hope
For the promise, it longs to know
What heaven holds

Then the angels, in holy haste
Lift their anthem, Your Saviour lays
In a manger, in humble form
Your King is born

Hail the prince of heaven comes
Angel choirs sound the call
For this babe wrapped in a cloth is
The incarnate word of God
All the kingdom and its power
Resting now in this child
Prince of heaven

King of glory, we gladly greet
Born in wonder and majesty
Forever worthy, the earth will sing
Oh, prince of heaven, we worship Thee

Lay our burdens at Jesus' feet

I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
No one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Bedlam in Belgium,1994

Still remains

People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share

I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
No one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning

I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
No one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

And tenement halls""

I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
No one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""

AC/DC,"Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
No one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Baptism by Fire,1994

Cambiar el aire depende de ti
Te ayudara vale la pena una vez más

Saber que se puede querer que se pueda
Quitarse los miedos sacarlos afuera
Pintarse la cara color esperanza
Tentar al futuro con el corazón

Es mejor perderse que nunca embarcar
Mejor tentarse a dejar de intentar
Aunque ya ves que no es tan fácil empezar

Sé que lo imposible se puede lograr
Que la tristeza algún día se irá
Y así­ será la vida cambia y cambiará

Sentirás que el alma vuela
Por cantar una vez más

Saber que se puede querer que se pueda
Quitarse los miedos sacarlos afuera
Pintarse la cara color esperanza
Tentar al futuro con el corazón

Saber que se puede querer que se pueda
Quitarse los miedos sacarlos afuera

Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories
Facing a dying nation of moving paper fantasy
Listening for the new told lies
With supreme visions of lonely tunes
Somewhere, inside something , there is a rush of greatness
Who knows what stands in front of our lives

Silence tells me secretly ev'rything, ev'rything
Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star

I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Tu ausencia me va a matar
Vicky, tú me haces sufrir
Ya no quiero más llorar

Nada importa la distancia
Te amo con sinceridad
Pues tengo en ti fe y confianza
