Jewel,"When the road gets dark
And you can no longer see
Just let my love throw a spark, baby
Have a little faith in me

When the tears you cry
Are all you can believe
Just give these loving arms a try, baby
Have a little faith in me

Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me

When your secret heart
Cannot speak so easily
Come here darlin'
From a whisper start
To have a little faith in me

When your back's against the wall
Just turn around, you will see
I will catch ya, I will catch your fall
Just have a little faith in me

Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me

Well, I've been loving you for such a long, long time baby
Expecting nothing in return
Just for you to have a little faith in me
You see time, time is our friend for you and me
'Cause for us there is no end
All you gotta do is have a little faith in me
I said I will hold you up, I will hold you up
Your strength gives me enough
So have a little faith in me
Hey baby, oh, baby
All ya gotta do is have a little faith in me
All ya gotta do is have a little faith in me
A little faith in me",Have a Little Faith in Me,1996
Jewel,"Bees are buzzin' in their honey catacomb
All the noise seems to call my head a home
Can't escape the scratchin'
My blood makes a noise
It's hard not to play when there are so many toys
So many toys

Under the water
The total is more than the sum
Under the water
I hear who I'll become

There's a hole inside my head where all the thoughts break out
Sometimes my flesh is filled with forgetfulness and doubt
It's easy to feel separate, no control of the reigns
Innocence ain't lost it just needs to be maintained
It needs to be maintained

Beside me are strange fish, moody and dark
A tapestry of intention that maintains the spark
And there's a tiny light
A flicker within
Forgiveness is the needle that knows how to mend
It knows how to mend

Under the water
The total is more than the sum
Under the water
I hear who I'll become

I've decided to hear who we will become
Want to lay down in the water, go back to where I'm from
Outer space is just a puzzle of stars
Music the mechanics of the human heart
A post that stirs, a shadow that casts
An insatiable thirst drains a martini glass
There's no place sacred, no honest reflection
Our senses made senseless by a lack o' direction
Monks are great with their fists uncurled
But they live in a cave, they know nothin' of the world
I want to live brave, I want to love without fear
But it's hard to navigate when I can't even hear

(Do do do do do do do,
Do do do do)

Bees are buzzin' in their honey catacomb
All the noise seems to call my head a home
Can't escape the scratchin'
My blood makes a noise
It's hard not to play when there are so many toys
There're so many toys

Under the water
The total is more than the sum
Under the water
I hear who I'll become

Under the water
My flesh is filled with stars
Under the water
I hear who we really are

Under the water
I lay my burdens down, down, down
Under the water
All resistance drowns

(Do do do do do do do, do do do do)
(Do do do do do do do, do do do do)
(Do do do do do do do, do do do do)
(Do do do do do do do, do do do do)
(Do do do do do do do, do do do do)

Come on, come down, down, down under go
A-go down on and go down under
Go under the water
I hear who I'll become

Under the water
I lay my problems down
Under the water
All my resistance drowned",Under the Water,1996

Jewel,"See, I can't scare anybody
They come from miles around
To laugh in my face and eat in my field

Said a scarecrow swinging on a pole
To some blackbirds sittin' on a fence
""Oh, the Lord gave me a soul,
But forgot to give me common sense.""

Said the blackbirds, ""Well, well, well.
What the thunder would you do with common sense?""
Said the scarecrow, ""Would be pleasin'
Just to reason out the reason
Of the wishes and the whyness and the whence.""

If I had an once of common sense...
(If he had an ounce of common sense...)

(""Well, what would you do Scarecrow?"")
I would while away the hours
Conferrin' with the flowers
Consultin' with the rain
And my head I'd be scratchin'
While my thoughts were busy hatchin'
If I only had a brain

I'd unravel every riddle
For every individle
In trouble or in pain
With the thoughts I'd be thinkin'
I could be another Lincoln
If I only had a brain

Oh, I could tell you why
The ocean's near the shore
I could think of things I never thought before
Then I'd sit and think some more

I would not be just a nothin'
My head all full of stuffin'
My heart all full of pain
I would dance and by merry
Life would be a dingle derry
If I only had a brain

If I only had a brain...
(If he only had a brain...)

I could tell you why
The ocean's near the shore
I could think of things I never thought before
And then I'd sit and think some more

Yeah, it would be kind of pleasin'
To reason out the reason
For the things I can't explain
Then perhaps I'd deserve you
And be even worthy of you

Jewel,"Lion. Said a lion, poor, neurotic lion. To a miss who'll listen to him rave. ?Oh, the lord made me a lion, but?the lord forgot to make me brave?.

Dorothy. Then his tail began to curl and wave.

Lion. Life?is?sad believe me, Missy, when you're born to be a sissy without the vim and verve. But I could change my habits never more be scared of RABBITS! if I only had the nerve. I'm afraid there's no denying I'm Just a dandelion, a fate I don't deserve. But I could show my prowess be a lion not a mouse if I only had the nerve. Oh, I'd be in my stride, a king down to the core, I could roar the way I never roared before, and then I'd are-are-roof and roar some more. I would show the dinosaurus whose king around the forest a king they'd better serve, why with my regal beezor I could be another Caesar, if I only had the nerve. I'd be brave as a blizzard.

Tin Man. I'd be gentle as a lizard.

Scarecrow. I'd be clever as a gizzard.

Dorothy. If the wizard is a wizard who will serve.

Scarecrow. Then I'm sure to get a brain.

Tin Man. A heart.

Dorothy. A home.

Jewel,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Jewel,"You took your coat off, stood in the rain
You're always crazy like that
And I watched from my window
Always felt I was outside looking in on you
You're always the mysterious one with
Dark eyes and careless hair
You were fashionably sensitive
But too cool to care
You stood in my doorway, with nothing to say
Besides some comment on the weather

Well in case you failed to notice
In case you failed to see
This is my heart bleeding before you
This is me down on my knees, and

These foolish games are tearing me apart
And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart
You're breaking my heart

You're always brilliant in the morning
Smoking your cigarettes and talking over coffee
Your philosophies on art, Baroque moved you
You loved Mozart and you'd speak of your loved ones
As I clumsily strummed my guitar

You'd teach me of honest things
Things that were daring, things that were clean
Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean
I hid my soiled hands behind my back
Somewhere along the line, I must have gone off track with you

Excuse me, guess I've mistaken you for somebody else
Somebody who gave a damn
Somebody more like myself

These foolish games are tearing me
You're tearing me, you're tearing me apart
And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart
You're breaking my heart

And you took your coat off, stood in the rain
You're always crazy like that",Foolish Games [Album Version],1996
Jewel,"I hear the clock, it's six a.m. 
I feel so far from where I've been 
Got my eggs and my pancakes too 
Got my maple syrup, everything but you

Break the yolks, make a smiley face 
I kinda like it in my brand new place 
I wipe the spots off of the mirror 
Don't leave the keys in the door 
Never put wet towels on the floor anymore 'cause

CHORUS
Dreams last for so long 
Even after you're gone 
I know you love me 
And soon you will see 
You were meant for me 
And I was meant for you

Called my momma, she was out for a walk 
Consulted a cup of coffee but it didn't wanna talk 
Picked up a paper, it was more bad news 
More hearts being broken or people being used

Put on my coat in the pouring rain 
Saw a movie it just wasn't the same 
'Cause it was happy and I was sad 
It made me miss you oh so bad

CHORUS

Go about my business, I'm doing fine 
Besides, what would I say if I had you on the line 
Same old story, not much to say 
Hearts are broken every day

Brush my teeth and put the cap back on
I know you hate it when I leave the light on
I pick a book up 
Turn the sheets down 
Take a deep breath and a good look around

Put on my pj's and hop into bed 
I'm half alive but I feel mostly dead
I try and tell myself it'll be all right 
I just shouldn't think anymore tonight

Jewel,"Said, ""angel, do you want a ride?""
Said, ""angel, I'm tired and I'm lonely
And i need somebody by my side""

It's a long road that stretched from Vegas to nowhere
But it'd been an even longer time
Since he found some piece of mind
And he lived off of bubblegum and cigarettes
And got his nourishment from all-night stores
Thought he'd just keep driving
Til he out drove his sorrow

He said, ""angel, oh do you want a ride?""
Said ""angel, I'm tired and I'm lonely
And i need somebody by my side""

Her feet were warm and tired
But as determined as a soul
She left with no regrets
But also no possessions did she own
Her heart was as fragile as her thin, loving arms
She's praying to god to take away her lonely
When he pulled on aside of the road

And he said, ""angel, oh do you want a ride?""
Said, ""angel, I'm tired and I'm lonely
And i need somebody by my side""

The highway goes on forever
I've seen a thousand men like him before
And I've seen a thousand angels that
Got into the car
They're just a couple of lost souls
Looking to rekindle some sort of forgotten dream
I hope they find what they're looking for
In the solace of the road

They said, ""angel, do you want a ride?""
Said, ""angel, I'm tired and I'm lonely
I'm tired and I'm lonely
I'm tired and I'm lonely

Desire grows, more often than not

I'm sorry's a stupid word, a stupid thing to say
Especially considering it's not like I planned it this way

But I'm sorry is all that there is left of me
I'm so sorry this love made me hollow and left you empty

Maybe I could have loved you better
Maybe you should have loved me more
Maybe our hearts were just next in line
Maybe everything breaks sometime
Everything breaks sometime

It's hard to believe it's boiled down to this
It seems so surreal this won't be healed by a kiss
It's hard to stare at you knowing you like I have
I used to feel so close, now I feel so bad

My heart's filled with thunderstorms and I'm ready to burst
And I've lost my favorite harbor and I'll weather for the worst

Neither have I wings to fly
Give me a boat that can carry two
And both shall cross my true love and I
I lean'd my back against an oak
Thinking it was a mighty tree
But first it bent and then it broke
So did my love prove false to me
I put my hand in some soft bush
Thinking the sweetest flow'are to find
I prick'd my finger to the bone
And left the sweetest flow'are behind
O love is handsome and love is kind
Gay as a jewel when it is new
But love grows old and waxes cold
And fades away like the morning dew

that's a face I'd never forget

""How's it goin' ma'am?""
But you're never quite clear if their glares are sincere
Or really only just second hand
To you it's all roses, its a lavender haze
The man is a marvel, but it's a shame about his brains
But that's OK,
They say ""he's got straight teeth and it's good sex"".

You claim innocence and not to understand
Or do you, do you?

He want to take his monkeys to see the kids at the zoo
'Cause the gypsy on the corner said
""Hey, Mister you can't lose.""
And it's your first day at the track
You feel that heat of your back
We all want to find a way to beat the system
Find some rhythem in the madness
Get down on your knees and pray
Say, ""I'll do whatever you want, God
Just let me have my way""
Well will you, will you?
Come on all you merry men
Rally your cry
Dance with the devil for tomorrow we'll surely...
Hey, hey blow the men down
You with all your cigarettes and cool stares, 
Filled with blank glares and loaded regrets. 
Just like the girls today today with nothing to say
No more pigtails and pony rides
They're sophisticated
They sip on lattes
And have their eyes on a bigger prize

We shake our fists and say, ""Well good golly we're mad
That God kills children with our very own hands""

And my pocketbook and my heart
Both just got stolen and the sun acts like
She don't even care the wind blows cold
When you reach the to feels like someones face
Is stuck to the bottom of my shoe
I got a plastic Jesus
And a cordless telephone
For every corner of my room
Got everybody but you
Telling me what to do

But I've been down so long
Oh, it cant be longer still
Ive been down so long
That the end must be drawing near

I look to everybody but me
To answer my prayers
Until I saw an angel
In a bathroom
Who said she saw no one
Worth saving anywhere
And a blind man on the corner
Said, its simple,
Like flipping a coin
Don't matter what side it lands on
If its someone else's dime

But I've been down so long
Oh, it cant be longer still

This restlessness inside of me
And it knows that you're no stranger

Say that you'll stay forever this way
Forever and forever that we'll never have to change

Don't change, don't leave
And promise me
Say you'll stay
Oh, we'll stay this Way

Jewel,"It's leaving time again
I'm headed out
With all my friends
It's a roll of the dice
I've never thought twice
About the way
I've been spending my time
Trying my guts out
For every dime
Working in an
Office building tall
You don't know
Who's next to you at all
But being out here
The blood, the guts, the beer
Is a test
Only time will tell
It brings you close, man
Closer than hell

[Chorus]
We're leaving
Leaving again
Can't recall
Where are we been
I guess we'll just go
Go till we're too old
Or we run out of road

The other day
I talked to Lou
He quit back in 92
Says he misses it bad
Those were the best time
He ever had
He said
""Give it hell to the end
'Cause once you quit
You can't get it back again""

[Chorus]

Expensive cabs
And sh*tty food
Washed down
With cancelled flights
This week endorsement holidays
You miss your boy and wife
Oh the late night drives
The calls
The dawn to strike you
Like a knife
Hey man
This is a beautiful life

We're leaving
Leaving again

Jewel,"Hate you, I love you
Leave, please
Don't go away
Can't decide if
I like your face
Or if I wish
It would stray
You're a child but
You're malicious
You're sweet but
Don't remember my name
And heads you win
And tails I'm lost
And love equals pain

[Chorus]
I am drifting
Without an anchor
Through your ambiguous region
A strange continent
Immune to all reason
And I'm flattered by
Your gray matter

Inside my skin
I feel your tongue
Telling me I'm dirty
And licking my bones
A surge against silence
A knife across a plate
Makes the sound
Of need on hate

[Chorus]

And I do not understand
Why a woman can't
Just love a man

You're amusing
You're a real cool show
With your meat hooks
And barbed wire carnival
You got glitter in your pocket
You got mothballs in your soul
From too many false teeth
And greasy flash bulbs

I hate you",Grey Matter [Live],2001
Jewel,"Lights are bright in the circus
The geeks and the freaks all light cigarettes and laugh at your misery
While the white of the curtain closing crushes your heart
The inertia of loneliness tears your flesh apart

[Chorus]
It's a long slow slide
It's a long slow slide
It's a long slow slide
Down

Once the neon is gone
There's still that golden splinter at your side
His manners are charming
But who are you fooling
You're still nobody's bride
And Bukowski's widow
Haunts each empty seat on the Ferris wheel
As ghoulish lovers collide in a collage of kisses that they steal

[Chorus]

And outside your window you can see the circus it's lurching
with rings of smoke
You laugh halfheartedly at the punchline
Not realizing they've made you the joke
And inside you're heart a war is raging
A region still untamed
The worst fear I can imagine is for the mystery to be named
Is for the mystery to be named

And Aphrodite with
Her neon lamp
Kissed Neptune
They put her face
On a stamp

I used it to mail
A letter to you
I'm sorry I'm glue and
The rest bounces off of you
And I'm sorry not even
This jet's metal wings
Could get across
These simple things
And I'm sorry
If I ever sang
Your name in vain
Oh well
Sometimes it be that way

And Goldilocks
Well she knew three bears
They all ate oatmeal
And tiptoed upstairs
And I'm sorry
I never got to
Find you like this
Sleeping like a baby
And swaddled in bliss
And I'm sorry for
All the times
I forgot to imply something
In between the lines

Its tail in the hall

If my arms to you
Were just empty rooms
I'm sorry
I never could comfort you

St. Petersburg is
A miserable town
And I'm sorry
If I am bringing you down
And I'm sorry
If I caused you pain

And flame licks the air
With its silver tongue
Night has many hands
But I have just one
And I'm sorry
I walked in on you
Unexpectedly
I'm sorry
I never served you
Camomile's tea
And I'm sorry
I didn't always have a match

Maybe my heart's too weak

I need you to hear.
I cannot disappear

That we'd give up
You said we'd had enough
Again and again and again and again

But you, you're always on my mind.
It's like this all the time.
Say it's cause you're mine, all mine

And if you will, I will
Try to let it go.
And if you try, I'll try

'Cause love is here to stay
Just look me in the eye
This is do or die
And I will stay in love
'Till you say enough
There is no giving in
There is no giving up in love.

Walk down the street
Stare at lots of things
The fast and steady streams
Again and again and again and again

Do what I should, try to stay busy
Your face is all I see
Again and again and again and again

But you, you're always on my mind.
It's like this all the time.

And I will stay in love

In the darkness I recall
Feeling the beauty and the pain
And when you call my name
Say you feel the same.

Being alone used to be just fine.
Now life without you is just passing time.

I thought I heard you call my name.
Reached for you're hand, it was in vein.
When you're here, it feels like a hole in my chest.
Get dressed, look in the mirror, say
""You're heart will never be the same.""

The clouds in the sky are blue
I belong with you.

I've made love without love being shown.
I've seen sorrow in a pair of dice,
All things that came in two's made me cry
Until tonight.

Self,
Why are you awake again?
It's one a.m.
Standin' with the fridge wide open, starin'
Such a sight, fluorescent light
The stars are bright
Might make a wish
If I believed in that shit
But as it is I might watch T.V.
Cause it's nice to see
That people can be more messed up more me

I say to myself
As I smile at the wall
Just let myself fall

It's gonna be all right
No matter what they say
It's gonna be a good day
Just wait and see
It's gonna be all right
Cause I'm all right with me
It's gonna be, it's gonna be
It's gotta be

I shiver, shut the door
Can't think standin' here no more
I'm alone, my mind's racing heart breaking
Can you be everything I need you to be?
Can you protect me like a daughter?
Love me like a father?
Can you drink me like water?
Say I'm like the desert
Just way hotter

The point of it all
Is that if I should fall
It's still your name I call

As long as we

Laugh out loud
Laugh like we are mad
Cause this crazy mixed up beauty is all that we have
Because what's love
But an itch we can't scratch,
A joke we can't scratch?
God, but we still laugh.

Get back in bed
Turn off the T.V.
You say it'll be all right, baby

I'm on a flight leaving L.A.
Trying to think about my life
My youth scattered along the highway

Hotel rooms and headlines
I've made a living with a song
Just a guitar as my companion
Wanting desperately to belong

Fame is filled with spoiled children
They grow fat on fantasy
I guess that's why I'm leaving
I crave reality

So goodbye Alice in Wonderland
Goodbye yellow brick road
There is a difference between dreaming and pretending
I did not find paradise
It was only a reflection of my lonely mind searching
For what was missing in my life

I'm embarrassed to say the rest is a rock and roll cliche
I hit the bottom when I reached the top
I never knew it was you who was breaking my heart
I thought you had to love me
You did not

Yes a heart can hallucinate
If it's completely starved for love
Can even make monsters seem like
Angels from above

You forged my love like a weapon
And turned it against me like a knife
You broke my last heart-string
But you opened up my eyes

So goodbye Alice in Wonderland
Goodbye yellow brick road
There is a difference between dreaming and pretending
That was not love in your eyes
It was only a reflection of my lonely mind wanting
What was missing in my life

Dreaming is a good thing cause it brings new things to life
Pretending is an ending that perpetuates a lie
Forgetting what you are
Seeing for what you've been told
And growing up is not the absence of dreaming
It's being able to understand the difference between the ones you can hold
And the ones that you've been sold

Well, truth is stranger than fiction
And this is my chance to get it right
Life is much better without all of your pretty lies

So Goodbye Alice in Wonderland
You can keep your yellow brick road
Cause there is a difference between dreaming and pretending
That was not love in your eyes
It was only a reflection of my lonely mind wanting
It was only a reflection of my lonely mind wishing
That you were what was missing from my life",Goodbye Alice in Wonderland,2006

You hunters of dreams
Look in the alleyways
For what you know is not what it seems
And fame, all you maidens,
It don't exist too long
But at least look behind you
And see your own shadow's gone

You gotta find yourself a cowboy
Or someone to keep you
Warm when it snows

Jewel,"Come here buttercup
Let me fill you up 
Can't you see I'm the blue in your skies

Where you used to be 
It feels like a hole in the middle of me

To have and hold if not obey
Oh, oh, oh say you're still my man

That I want you always to stay 
To wake up with you every single day
But words get in the way

And let's go back to bed

Wonder who you're talking to
Wonder if the sun has risen where you are
It's morning time, I miss your hands on my skin
This bed's too big without you
Oh God, what do I do?
I'm a thousand miles away, and I'm lying next to you
The sun shines golden, and I feel like my car
A little run down, a little beat up, maybe just a little green
Maybe it's my battery, maybe it's my starter
Maybe my heart's too weak
There's just this feeling, thought I had to get going
Got too scary, got too big, got to get out of here
But now I don't know how to get home
Oh God, what do I do?
I'm a thousand miles away, and lying next to you

That I am down on my knees
My heart's in your hand and you squeeze
I want the whole thing 
But you give me a part
It's time you start
So I push and you pull

Stop me, stop me from falling

Then why do you leave me
If you need me 
Then I'll love you only 
When I am the only one too

I just can't make you understand
I want your heart but you hold up your hand
You say space is what you need
But you want me to be true to just you
While you get to do whatever you want to

You'll never stop
It's gotta change
You don't want a lover
You want a world of slaves

Finding comfort in a strangers face,
In some darkened place where no one knew my name

Jewel,"Night with its shattered teeth
Attempts to speak
My pen is present but
Courage left via the sink
And I'm sorry
I snuck up on you
From behind
I'm sorry not all
My love letters did rhyme
And I'm sorry that
Jesus died for my sins
And I swear to God
It won't happen again
And I'm sorry
If it was my swerve that
Tempted you to sway
Oh well
Sometimes it be that way
And Romeo was
A very nice man
He said
""Jewel, I don't think
You quite understand"" 
And I'm sorry if you had
To explain it like this
I'm sorry I was a point
You were destined to miss
And I'm sorry
I spoke to you irreverently
Down in the hollow
By the old olive tree
And I'm sorry
If my heart breaking
Ruined your day 
Oh well
Sometimes It be that way

I said
""Oh well, I got nothing
Left to sell
This love was a bell that
Rang unheard in the air
I was bound to find out
That you didn't care
Oh well
Sometimes it be that way

And Aphrodite with
Her neon lamp
Kissed Neptune
They put her face
On a stamp
And I'm sorry
I used it to mail
A letter to you
I'm sorry I'm glue and
The rest bounces off of you
And I'm sorry not even
This jet's metal wings
Could get across
These simple things
And I'm sorry
If I ever sang
Your name in vain
Oh well
Sometimes it be that way

And Goldilocks
Well she knew three bears
They all ate oatmeal
And tiptoed upstairs
And I'm sorry
I never got to
Find you like this
Sleeping like a baby
And swaddled in bliss
And I'm sorry for
All the times
I forgot to imply something
In between the lines
And I'm sorry
If my heart breaking
Ruined your day
Oh well
Sometimes it be that way

I said
""Oh well, I got nothing
Left to sell
This love was a bell that
Rang unheard in the air
I was bound to find out
That you didn't care
Oh well
Sometimes it be that way

And shadow's long fingers
They dance on the wall
Electricity chases
Its tail in the hall
And I'm sorry
If my arms to you
Were just empty rooms
I'm sorry
I never could comfort you
And I'm sorry
St. Petersburg is
A miserable town
And I'm sorry
If I am bringing you down
And I'm sorry
If I caused you pain
Oh well
Sometimes it be that way

And flame licks the air
With its silver tongue
Night has many hands
But I have just one
And I'm sorry
I walked in on you
Unexpectedly
I'm sorry
I never served you
Camomile tea
And I'm sorry
I didn't always have a match
That could start
A fire big enough
For your heart to catch
And I'm sorry
If it was my swerve that
Tempted you to sway
Oh well

Way up high
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby

Somewhere over that rainbow
All skies are blue, oh
And where dreams
That you dare to dream
Really do come true

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
And troubles mount like lemon drops
Way above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly, oh
If birds can fly over the rainbow
Why, then why can't I?

Someday I'll wake and rub my eyes
And in that land beyond the skies
You'll find me
I'll be a laughing daffodil
And leave the silly cares that
Fill my mind behind me

What I saw took my breath away

Was hoping I would run into

But I know that I am strong
And as the night draws on
Should you ask to take me home
I'm sure that I'll say no

With all your charms

It would end with me crying

Thinking about us maybe
Taking a break was a good thing

'Cause we were just children
Following a feeling
Not knowing love could wither away

But looking back it passed so softly
But common strangers we could not see
Just tired of fighting tired of hanging on

But now that you're gone I can see
That love is a garden if you let it go
It fades away before you know
And love is a garden it needs help to grow
Ours is starving but there's still hope
Come on, baby, and I'll feed ya on kisses
Come on, baby, let's make up for what we've been missing
Come on, baby, baby, come home

Soon we discovered just how tryin' it could be
You'd stay out all night and you'd say I was uptight
And soon we were only fighting

But looking back from this side now
It's hard to imagine wonder how
I thought it was you who was always wrong

Well, tough job, broke car, mean boss,
And our moms all squeeze like weeds they get in the way
Now you're gone and I'm here,

What we needed to do was just make some room for me and you.

He drank enough beer to take the edge off a knife
And she opened the door, looking older than before

Like an apology began to kiss her neck
And he felt much relieved as the ceiling fan tapped out a broken melody

And she said, ""Do you remember when we were younger and angry words were said,
Making up was always your favorite part
Well, I ain't young no more
And I'm sorry will not mend a broken heart.""

He came home threw his things on the floor

From loving a man who always makes it clear

Say that we were made

Say that they know
We're a perfect pair

And the clouds up in the sky
Say they can see it from way up high
We're a perfect pair

And my ways weaken beneath your will
And before you I am trembling and still

All the bees see it

I'll protect you from harm, and you'll wake in my arms

Guardian angels are near, so sleep without fear

Lilies o'er head, lay thee down in thy bed

Lullaby, and good night, you are mother's delight
I'll protect you from harm, and you'll wake in my arms

Lullaby, and sleep tight, my darling sleeping
On sheets white as cream, with the head full of dreams
Sleepyhead, close your eyes, I'm right beside you
Lay thee down now and rest, may you slumber the best

Pleased you'll be with the treasure of your mind
And if you're pleased with the treasure of your mind
Then with you I will always be

So come closer my love, to me
You are closer than you can ever see
You live in my heart
That's where you'll always be

And if you wonder how it is that I love
Just watch the sun set slip away
And as you watch that sun slip away
Know some things are better left unseen
And if you know some things go unseen
Then night shall carry you in her arms
And if you feel I carry you in my arms

But when they cut too deep, I wanna leave it all behind,
I have to count to ten, before I cross that line.

One, I still wanna hate you,
Two, three, I still wanna leave,
Four, I'm searching for that door,
Five, then I look into your eyes,
Six, take a deep breathe,
Seven, take a step back,
Eight, nine, I don't know why, we even started this fight,
By the time I get to ten, I'm right back in your arms again.

You can lose what you're not thankful for,
I don't want that to happen to you and me,
Better count my blessings.

One, you still move me,
Two, three, you send chills right through me,
Four, you keep me wanting more,
Five, when I look into your eye,
Six, you're my best friend,
Seven, that'll never end,
Eight, nine, I don't know why, but thank God it happens every time,
By the time I get to ten,
By the time I get to ten,
I can see how blessed I've been.

Jewel,"I'm driving around town
Kinda bored with the windows rolled down
See a girl on the bus stop bench
Dressed to draw attention

Hoping everyone will stare
If she don't stand out she thinks she'll disappear
Wish I could hold her, tell her, show her
What she wants is already there

A star is a star
It doesn't have to try to shine
Water will fall
A bird just knows how to fly

You don't have to tell a flower how to bloom
Or light how to fill up a room
You already are what you are
And what you are is beautiful

Heard a story the other day
Took place at the local VA
A father talking to his dying son
This was his conversation

""It's not supposed to be like this
You can't go first I can't handle it.""
The boy said ""Dad now don't you cry,
Remember when I was a child what you used to tell me when I'd ask why?""

You'd say gravity is gravity
It doesn't try to pull you down
Stone is stone
It can't help but hold it's ground

The wind just blows, though you can't see
It's everywhere like I'll always be
You already are what you are
And what you are is strong enough

Look in the mirror
Now that's another story to tell
I give love to others
But I give myself hell

I'd have to tell myself
""In every scene there's a perfect plan""
Everything I hoped to be
I already am

A flower is a flower
It doesn't have to try to bloom
And light is light
Just knows how to fill a room

And dark is dark
So the stars have a place to shine
The tide goes out
So it can come back another time

Goodbye makes a love so sweet
And love is love so it can teach us
We already are what we are
And what we are is beautiful

And strong enough
And good enough
And bright enough",What You Are,2010
Jewel,"Shut up, sweetheart, I want you to hear
I can no longer love the same thing I fear
I can no longer let myself stay close
To the one thing that hurts me the most
I will not kiss the thorn
Hearts don't need to bleed to know what they're for
There'll be no more heartaches
There'll be no more heartaches for me

I take back my sweetness
It's overlooked by your lust
My song is unseen
Cause your touch is too tough
I don't think your hands know how to adore
The subtlety of me anymore
I unfasten myself from your side
Slip away, quiet as a sigh
There'll be no more heartaches
There'll be no more heartaches for me

Beds filled with suspicion
Hearts filled with spite
We sleep with thieves
And forego our sights
Too quick to hold
Someone's word over our own
You may be cool
You may know how to flatter

He sings to him sweetly and calls him Sam 
He's happy 
So happy 

And do you see the lady with the long black beard 
Its her pride and joy 
She's been growing it for years 
She's happy 
So happy 

So may I caution you and say beware 
Before you dare judge and stare 

'Cause everybody has to be something 
Its a lot better than just being nothing

And all day long she is giving them baths

In the reflection of everyone else

Instead of just being happy 

I know a lady 
Who dances on her bed 
Only she can hear the music 
'Cause it's in her head 
But she's happy

An amusement park full of delights and 
The best part is they have one in every town 
its your local market where you ride a cart around 

They have stacks of candy in every isle 
And every kind of cereal that goes on for miles 
Flour and milk that can be made 
Into brown gravy for supper Sunday 

They got 50 pound bags of chicken nuggets 
They got yummy yogurt by the bucket. 
Shelves and shelves of home made stuffin’ 
Oh what a treat 

That's what I love about the grocery store 
They have everything that you could want and so much more 
Its so hard to keep my hands inside the cart 
But I better try or mom won't bring me back no more 

They got sweet and sour stir fried rice 
They got Alaskan salmon sitting on ice
They got blue corn chips and bagel bites 
Coconut in a can 

And if your from the south you'll be really pleased 
They have black eyed peas and collared greens 
And if you're from the North there's stuff just for you
Like king crab legs and Eskimo pie, too 

They have lots of veggies so you'll grow up tall 
Beef and chicken so you'll be strong and all 
The dairy to help build unbreakable bones 
Hey, ice cream counts, at least I think so 

They have chocolate chip cookies and pecan snookies 
And pop corn snacks where its says on the back 
You get a toy surprise like x-ray glasses for your eyes
There's croissant rolls, jelly rolls, soda fountains overflow
If I don't get my snow cone my head will explode 

They got barbecue chicken with all the fixings
Sweet buttermilk for buttermilk biscuits
Brownies in a box, just water and mix em’
Oh oh, um um good

Yes, its so hard to keep my hands inside the cart

'Cause of looking at all them parts makes a fight look so small
But I wish he'd just put me and sally in the backseat and
Drive us away
That's when he sits me down
He says he's gonna teach me about life
He said, ""a man needs a car and a boy needs a bike""
I got my first taste of freedom beneath the light of the moon
But if it were me
I'd have the guts to put to test those bolts and nuts
And I'd ride away so fast, so far
Ride away, so fast, so far
Put away our tools
We go back inside
Mom feels left out and now she's starting to cry
I wonder if all girls are crazy this way
I wish pops would just get a spine
I said I know it's kind of small but you can borrow mine
He just smiled and said, ""your mom means well son""
Most times are good it's just some that are lean
But it's love that makes up for those times in beteween
He got a tear in his eye as he took mamma's hand
Said one day I'd understand
But if it were me
I'd have the guts to put to test those bolts and nuts
And I'd ride away so far, so fast
Ride away so fast so far

More than words can say

Your perfection is amend
You're as fragile as your thoughtlessness
As strong as you can bend

Held all your high hopes through a telescope
Lavender haunted you
So I could own your life in yellow 

You have a fire down in genius, subtlety
And you slip through the fingers of ambiguity

Jewel,"Mama, I see your face now in the mirror
It's getting clearer
Daddy, all those things I said I wouldn't do
I've been drawn to 'cause I looked up to you
And I've loved you through this tangled legacy
Tracing the twisted roots of our family tree

I stayed strong like you did
I moved on like you did
And I wound up tough as stone like you did
If I don't learn to bend I know I'm going to break
Like you did

Lover, I must forgive you
I confused you with what I couldn't see inside of me
Dark things pulling, not evolving
It made a puppet out of me
And you came with your own history
Both caught in the branches of our family tree

I stayed strong like you did
I moved on like you did
And I wound up all alone like you did
If I don't learn to bend, I know I'm gonna break just like you did

I love you but I need to look at who we've been
Take the fruit but choose the seeds I scatter in the wind
That's the job of the kid: to do better than our parents did

So I'll stay strong like you did
And I'll move on like you did
But I won't hide from the truth like you did
I'm learning to bend so I won't break
And you can bet I'll teach my child 
that love will always find a way just like you did",Family Tree,2015

Pour a glass and drink with a nigga, you know what I mean?
I ain't tryin' to turn you all niggas into alcohols, alcoholics
I'm just tryin' to turn you into motherfuckin' thugs
So come and get some of this Thug Passion, baby

I could pull out the drink and be good until it's relevant
But I'm a straight soldier
I'll roll up a nigga like it's Heaven sent
Tripping over dead presidents
They got these derelicts
I throw was down with this business
Trying to clown and get a cent
And so rather than stand forever, been thinking
Drinking over a felony
And hell of me and how it will be some other shit
People telling me to cool out
But they ain't feeling me
A motherfucking fool, about
My fucking cheddar cheese
And it pleases, passion of mine
Thugging, hugging plenty of G's
And laughing while I pass through times
And all these bastards be watching
Just keep it plain
And I'mma keep it the same partner, just take it the simple game
I can pinkle with the rain twinkling
Diamonds and things go blinking
Enough to hold me, til I'm old and wrinkling
And these adversaries
They gonna have to be worrying

Turn this Hennessey into a robbery
The Prophecy probably suddenly
Switch and how it supposed to be and dirty money
Can't be evil 'cause it's filling up my tummy
Born in a position, death collision was futuristic
Twisting riches but there is only one way to make more
So I'm standing on the corner
Trying to hustle in the snow and my bigger bro
Couldn't know, but buy a .44, blasting at playa haters wanting more
With a Thug Passion

Control by this Thug's Passion
Unlike them other bustas pistol blasting
I'm asking what happened
To the niggas who kept it real
Like they claim to
That's when I bang, do, see thang true
Travelling this road my poor soul has been consolidated
With all this bullshit that I done tolerated
How I made it can easily stated
It's like my heart be gripped with the Passion
To be the fucking greatest
Load up and take shit

Make it to some high dollar gangsta shit
Jack a stack 'til we got enough bank to split

Creep with me

Thug Passion got you trembling, like Death on the Row
Make your move
So I can throw your mind a curve
While I'll be blowing up the scene
Like my nigga Mr. Herb
Take a toke as your heart goes full arrest

'Cause some of you bitches funny

Licking them lips, you got me about to act a fool quick
Sipping on some Alizé and Cristal
Meanwhile, buy me a drink and get to winking at me

Satisfaction is everlasting
""How does it feel?"" what I'm asking
While I'm rubbing on that ass
""Why you laughing?""

Fuck around and get caught up in a one-eight-seven

Jez Lowe,"When I was young me father said to me, he said to me
He said never take advice when it comes for free
Cause you can have all the riches of the golden kind
But without the riches of your peace of mind
He said you won't make old bones
You won't make old bones
You won't make old bones you'll see

And as the old men sit and curse times slipping sand, 
Slipping sand
I sit and I curse the time upon my hands
And the north wind blows like a song of the sea
The song that it carries comes quite plain to me
And says you won't make old bones... 

Now there is some folks make remarks and me fetals in
Frown, me fetals in frown
And says the only way you can get up is when they turn
You down
Now everybody gives me the same advice
They said go sign up for the soldiers life or

You won't make old bones... 

So I went to the army like everybody told me to do, 
They told me to do
They said we'd love to make a soldier out of you
But before I put me name down on the line
Me fathers words came to me on time, he said
You won't make old bones... 

I said your guns and your drums are not for the likes
Of me, the likes of me
For me future it might look bleaker than bleak can be
'Cause your talk of many owing much to few
When all that I wanted was a job to do, he said
You won't make old bones... 

So you people in power and position I tell you beware, 
I tell you beware
Of your tacts and your figures to tell you what went

Jezzabell Doran,"My rhymes so unspeakable
My dreams so unreachable
Give it a purpose, cause life itself isn't meaningful
Now that's the truth, I'm speaking for the youth
That's aiming for the top but falling from the roof
Here we, here we go again, with my paper and my pen
Summer 2012 its the year of the end, or is it?
Exquisite lyrics, you hear it or do you fear it
Jammin' in my car, smelling like teen spirit
I see a star falling form the sky, should I catch it
I wanna die in my car, should I wreck it

This drug makes you hooked once, should I test it
Yes no maybe so, now its time for me to grow
Outside of my flow, Do I ever get to know
what my real passion is, why am I so imaginative
Adverb, pronoun, noun, verb, adjective
Mouth running, talking shit, cool it with the laxatives
But its time, to recognize Armageddon's signs
Start lootin' stores, kill whoever, I don't mind
If you see me, don't bro me if you don't know me
That goes to you, you, you and all my homeys

Cause nobody knows me, and nobody told me
How to write poetry, this fucking world owes me
Everything I've ever wanted, fuck you and fuck your life
Fuck you everyday, fuck you every night
Look at all the fucks I give I should start a charity
Bitches thinking they in love, bitches starting to scare me
Only love is family, and my lost dog charlie
If you've seen a white English bull dog call me
All I want out of this world is a changed world
All I want is a metaphysical dream girl

To smoke DMT and weed starting at the universe
Trying to figure out how, nothingness is giving birth
To all of reality, if space had gravity
Would we fall forever or will hit the ground
I wanna step outside the Universe and see whats all around
Cause I don't believe in anything, not even myself
Only way to wake up from the dream is through death
But I keep my sanity, or whatevers left
Cause I gotta keep striving, opposite of thriving
Gotta stay alive and, always keep trying",Sleepless,2012

Dropped my pants, held on a plastic bag

And I was standin' on the side of the road
Rain fallin' on my shoes
Heading out for the East Coast
Lord knows I've paid some dues gettin' through,
Tangled up in blue.

She was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam, I guess,
But I used a little too much force.
We drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out West
Split up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best.
She turned around to look at me
As I was walkin' away
I heard her say over my shoulder,
""We'll meet again someday on the avenue,""
Tangled up in blue.

I had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But I never did like it all that much
And one day the ax just fell.
So I drifted down to New Orleans
Where I happened to be employed
Workin' for a while on a fishin' boat
Right outside of Delacroix.
But all the while I was alone
The past was close behind,
I seen a lot of women
But she never escaped my mind, and I just grew
Tangled up in blue.

She was workin' in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer,
I just kept lookin' at the side of her face
In the spotlight so clear.
And later on as the crowd thinned out
I's just about to do the same,
She was standing there in back of my chair
Said to me, ""Don't I know your name?""
I muttered somethin' underneath my breath,
She studied the lines on my face.
I must admit I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Tangled up in blue.

She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe
""I thought you'd never say hello,"" she said
""You look like the silent type.""
Then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century.
And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burnin' coal
Pourin' off of every page
Like it was written in my soul from me to you,
Tangled up in blue.

I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs,
There was music in the cafes at night
And revolution in the air.
Then he started into dealing with slaves
And something inside of him died.
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside.
And when finally the bottom fell out
I became withdrawn,
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keepin' on like a bird that flew,
Tangled up in blue.

So now I'm goin' back again,
I got to get to her somehow.
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now.
Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenter's wives.
Don't know how it all got started,
I don't know what they're doin' with their lives.
But me, I'm still on the road
Headin' for another joint
We always did feel the same,
We just saw it from a different point of view,

You could be my pre-madonna

But I could barely pay attention
I don't even know why I'm signed to a record label with an audience

Man, why this always gotta happen to me?
A song of a siren caught my iris
Slow wind from her island just crashed into the
Coastline and Poseidon attacks the new me
You know she know she bad, Mike Jackson-ily
And she just wanna thrill a man
Then a hand, scribbling off of the wall
Started with:
Dog, really she just wanna kill a man
Hope floats boats
But when Gilligan’s on the wheel again
And he’s fiddling with demonic riddles on that Ritalin
And the minnows in sin
In the wind
Like in the willows and spinning like ceiling fans
You just need to heal her man
Absolutely!
She just wanna share my light, I stole that line from an ab-soul loose leaf
Hold it Gray
I know the pain

Then I sank in the ocean
And can't swim good

Water water all around me
Yet the thirst is real

JGivens,"Fictitious foolies got me on a sick one
I'm still from Tha Side ready to die for the mission
Or meditate it, then I levitated
Elevated, celebrated
You should celebrate it, this is that embedded greatness
Good, good God
I'm a mad man, mathematics, statics
Stealin' the stars
I'm a bad man, bask into battle
I'm a battered mad hatter with the earth on a platter
Meek and mild 'til I get freakin' wild
It's a misconception messin' with your intellect
I reckon it'll be neck and neck
Before I let the deck eject the message
This is not a warning, this is what you wanted on the table
'Crae, let 'em know the lil' homie willin' and able
It's Givez

Vegas, get active
Flippin' your city like gentrification all in the ghetto upon a dirty mattress
Word to that sister actress
Nevada gets it crackin'
It’s hot and J got a jacket
We'll peddle back if you askin' if love's a long practice
Full metal jacket dually known as a banana clip when rappin'
That's a loaded magazine of ammunition
Plan out snippets so these magazines don't go bananas
Over loaded clips or flows floatin'
Only showin' sinkin' ships ten percent of why he's frozen
Let it go, it's hotter than sprinters in Arizona
Juxtapose 'em to a snowman in Nova Scotia
It's rap's Christopher Nolan
Picture me rollin', pistol emoji, blaow
This a misconception triple threat
Did Givens flex?
Still a Christian, yep
Don't need acknowledgement, just respect the conglomerate
Double tap it and follow it
They shocked to see us like Donald Trump up in a taqueria
Watchin' Evita, cryin' over Argentina
Or Maria dominatin' Serena
I'm tryna find a big homie for Slim Jesus
Thesis of a new hope
More hardcore than Star Wars part four rated R
Or Rosa Parks or feet kicked off the bus exitin' starboard
Light saves like a time change
Hands up and down like a sine wave
Gospel be the humble, don't sleep the beast is a mind frame

They told me that rap was stacked
Is it tracks, is it facts?
Is it trap, is it rats?
When metaphors, you ready for the medics stored inside it
Is it similes or violence?
Is it sympathy or similar
The sinner's lord's inside 'em
The problem ain’t wordplay
I get schizophrenic with sittin', straight jackin' the beat
Blood all on it, hashtag
A dracula scheme, trick or treat
It ain’t magic, I'ma vanish when I pass to the team
Thirty-two half that
Grab a 16 and let us shoot
Betty Boop wit the black top
I’m a mascot for the dreaded truth
Locks all in my head, ain’t no chain that I hang from
But He hang from where I came from, that’s death
Guess what, I ain’t done
I'm rappin'
Beneath it is Jesus reachin' for actors
Living halle', add the 'lujah with the asterisk
Correction, then bury the body under the mattress
Livin' my dream while you sleepin' in different caskets

Look, I was created to make a statement
A sentence sent us to earth on this mission
Tryna make a way for my siblings
Brothers and sisters who drinkin'
Out of them cisterns with cracks in 'em
Listen but lack hearin'
Who lookin' but lack vision
Initially made in the Lord's image, dynamic
Nothing lackin', magic couldn't make it happen
Look at us, you hear us rappin'
That ain't complaining but how can they be mad at all?
King dreamed a dream but we seen scenes that'll make us awe
Change the channel, we channel all of this energy
Pretend to be savages, we ravage our so-called enemies
That look like us
But it look like us ain't gon' make it less we shake it
We can't look back much
Turned around to give a helping hand
I'm like, man, they gon' make it, makin' baking soda boiling inside these pans
Now they're wondering, is it rap or is it Gospel?
Look all you need to know is I was dead, now I'm not though
Real recognizing real, and if they don't love me like Pac
They better respect how I'm movin' and that I'm never gon' stop
I hit my pastor on the cell, I said, I'm catching hell
Well, what you think they did to Jesus?
Only time will tell
Can't believe we rap about the faith and people like the sound
We out here workin' in the streets, you better ask around
Tell them other rappers we don't want it, they can have the crown
They have to lay it down when you hear that trumpet sound
We know who got the keys to the kingdom
When the King come, crown Him, and your king dumb if his kingdom ain't bout Him
Say it with your chest, when the bishop is the king and the knight
The queen get the rest
I'm the only pawn that's on one, back in two thousand and one
I was wishin' labels signed me, but now I own one
That ain't braggin', that's just motivation
Get your education, this industry overrated, Satan-saturated
Folk be lyin' to your face, and sayin' they glad you made it
Turn your back and you can hear 'em hatin' in they conversation
Oh, snake face with the same bait
And the same fate, fate, fate, that get your face ate, zero-eight bass
Nah, base like the base plate
How you runnin' home?
You ain’t in that zone, they don’t let it slide
You ain’t safe
Wonder how do we survive in this suicide, do or die jungle?

Demuéstrame que tú y yo somos iguales
Hoy vine para observar lo bien que a ti te sale
Sigue, y que pase, todo lo que no pensaste

Mientras tú vas dejando a todos enamorados, yo aquí
Intentando de que suceda lo nuestro (Mamacita)

Una vez
Aunque quisiera que pasara, mami, cada vez
Que te deseo mucho más de lo que tú lo crees (Yeah)
Hoy no habrá un final (Hah), yo sé

Que cuando empieces a sentir que, y te falte el aire
Relájate y acércate, hagamos balance (Ahh)
Me tienes apreciando una obra de arte
Y cuando te mueves, me da con tocarte

Mañana
Cuando te levantes, sabrás que fuiste mía (Yah)
No pasa nada (Mamá)
Si no quieres involucrarte (Toma)
Aprovecharía y te diría, que

Family behind us
You don't want to see this Mo' Thug clique
To swift to be faded
Just hated by them foes
Throw blows, bow down hoes
Mo' Thug handle this like pros
I'm too cold
Never catch me slippin' muthafucka set up
II Tru to my dyin' day
Rollin' with AJay
Mo' Thug love nigga what
You got your blue suit
You got your nine
But if you pop one time
My trues comin' back uptight and I'm a end mine

Pumpin' in your ear
Fillin' the air with nothin' but potent ass bud smells

Lynch 'em
Head straight for the ditch
Victims say we got a snake to snitch
Goin' to the cut so we can break the bitch
How you want the nigga 
Red on on this blue suit fried
When he died we showed the nigga he could never ride 
Or fuck with the souljahs
That glide on the Clair side
Runnin' with gauges
Flippin' your pages
Fuck the cages
Shoulda known not to fuck with the thugs all militant
Hell yeah we chill but we ill to defence of livin'
Still can't help the way we roll
In the land so cold
Eveybody's singin' the devil's song along the road

[Boogy Nikke]
I'm takin' the lives of all them seargents, lieutenants we pin this
How far are you willing to go
When you test us we test nuts boy
Better part the sea and pin the scriptures we read 'em
Gotta get 'em where it hurt
Gotta get their kids first
Now my subject be the envy in me
I'm wantin' your soul to burn in hell
And dwell and tell the past who put you there
Your family was soon to follow
As I complete my intro on your people
God bless the children though
It was business never personal
Better pray to the Lord for your soul
Run away through the tunnel of the light
Can you see me see me

[Krayzie Bone]
Boy you better believe it
Your people fin to feel it
When the coffin top drop the box lock shut
Toss 'em in the back of the hearse
And I wish I could watch the cop's crooked body rott
And thugs will all in time
Takeover the world
Collect the minds of all the little girls and boys
And pearls to a another dimension
Where really is just us fuck the system
Is ya feelin' me now
'Cause I ain't got time
To be fuckin' with the street weak leakin' mind
You know it's cool to be thuggin' on '99
I parlay break bustas and niggas that's on the grind
Niggas tryin' to creep up on ah come up
But I betcha nigga come my way you sprayed
You knew we was real
We really do smoke blunts
We do all our own stunts
Fuck cops a whole bunch
So they want to die
So we fin to kill 'em
Hit the copper chop 'em up with the M-11 
Now feel the pain
We the T-H-you-G be fuckin' souljah
Niggas is sure we got the real shit for ya
Never respect 'em ready to blow 'em out ya town now
Come on why'all we take a pow pow
That gauge that gauge we spray they lay they lay
What a wonderful day
Get up buck and fuck 'em on up
When they pull you to side and they tryin' to put the cuffs on
That's the perfect time to get it pump
Then you reach up in the glove
Hold your breath then get ya buss on
Let 'em feel the round
Or hear the sound
Of the twelve gauge eruption
Destruction we've made
Now the peelin' is through and we got your pay

Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed,

Santa honey, I want to yacht,
And really that's not a lot,
I've been an angel all year,

Santa cutie, there's one thing that I really need, The deed.
To a plex of my hand,
Santa cutie, and hurry down the chimney tonight.

Santa baby, fill my stocking with a rolex, And checks.
Sign your 'X' on the line,
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight.

Come and trim my Christmas tree,
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's,
I really do believe in you,
Let's see if you believe in me,

When you and I was so happy together every way
But now, reminiscing
I can see the signs was right in front of my face
So I guess, you was right the fault's mine

Say you loved me, whatever
So completely, whatever
I see you was wrong but guess what, baby

I got a smile on my face
Don't trip, didn't take long to get over you
I'm good, ain't got no attitude
Found another on the quick finer than you
And that's the truth, fool, I'm happy for you

Shorty, it was only one mistake
Can you forgive me? No
You and me, we got a special thing
I can't let you go, no

One more time, girl, you know I got chu
You know I'll take care of you
Give you anything, be the man you want me to be
You're everything, you know I love you

Girl, I love you, come on now, girl
Lemme show you, I know I was wrong
Then you shoulda kept a smile on my face

I got a smile on my face
Don't trip, didn't take long to get over you
I'm good, ain't got no attitude
Now I've found another on the quick finer than you
And that's the truth, fool, I'm happy for you

Come on, tell me how does it make you feel
To know I don't need your love? I'm happy for you
Come on, tell me how does it make you feel
To know that he hot? You're not
I'm happy for you, I'm telling you, fool

I got a smile on my face
Don't trip, didn't take long to get over you
I'm good, ain't got no attitude
Found another on the quick finer than you
And that's the truth, fool, I'm happy for you

I am so frustrated like my souls been taken away
Broken promise of everything that I thought you were
Thought you said this would never hurt, that’s what it did that is all

I do not feel the fear of falling
Thought I could fly
It didn’t go well and oh well

I’ve never felt these things before
I’m a feind for sure, please don't go
How could you not need me no more?

You're the only thing that I loved
You’re the only thing that I want
You’re the only reason, the only reason

Praying to a sky all black
Looking at the stars like they finna talk back
Looking at my phone like she finna call back

You stuck around even when the world frowned on me
Kicked me when I was down, and so they clowned on me

Know you was tired like the Michelin man
What if Gina would have listened to Pam?
Now they hate to see us last this long
When they get my album, probably pass this on
Thought they knew me, well
Money can't buy you happiness that's true as hell
The happiness can't buy yo' ass this new SL

I love you like the bad kid love breakin' shit

Now what you crying for?
She says you ain't gon' settle down, what you lyin' for?
She want that old thing back
Things ain't the same, think we both seen that
Love is war, end up on the floor
But baby you only lose when you don't swing back
I say those word hoping that,
You fight for a nigga like I fight for you
Like I fight temptations every night for you
And though I slip, only girl in my life is you

We only need to stay close

Feels as though our world's crashing down
We can't forget to breathe through this now
We live through the ups and the downs
It'll get better

With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that, I'd never make you feel like that

Yeah I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I can take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking a lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
Y'all don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us

Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

Uh, thinking 'bout Texas back when Porsche used to work at Treasures
Or further back then that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we talked about something we disagreed on
Then she started telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in a galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks to the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without trying to prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn’t
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I thought we had it all planned out, guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I’m living I just hope I’m forgiven
It seems like you don’t want this love anymore
I’m acting out in the open it’s hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for, who better for you than the boy, huh?

I love me, I love me enough for the both of us

Every weekend turned to every evening

Jhené Aiko,"Wake up, wake up
Gotta get this paper, get this cake up
Gotta do my hair, gotta put on makeup
Gotta act like I care about this fake stuff
Straight up what a waste of my day
If I had it my way I'd roll out of bed
Say bout 2:30 mid day
Hit the blunt then, hit you up to come over to my place
You show up right away
We make love then and then we fuck
And then you'd give me my space
Hey

What I am trying to say is
The love is ours to make so we should make it
Everything else can wait
The time is ours to take so we should take it

Wake up, wake up, bake up
Gotta heat the vape up
Lets get faded
Gotta call your job tell em' you won't make it
Ain't nobody here baby lets get wasted
We should just get naked
'Cause I be working hard and I know you be on that same shit
Every other day's a different game that you just can't win
I just want to ease your mind and make you feel all right
So go head tell your baby mama you gon be with me tonight
Right

What I am trying to say is
The love is ours to make, so we should make it
Everything else can wait
The time is ours to take so we should take it

It's not love, but it's pretty close
Hot fudge and a little smoke
I didn't mean it means nothing to you
Hands locked on my black couch with nothing to do
Can't stop on cloud 20
Buried in the drugs, but the feels keeps coming
Finally stop crying, but your nose is still running
Wipe it on my shirt, haha I need sleep
You tell me that you wanna do it big
I love it when you say ""guess what?"" (What? What?)
Reading stories to some other nigga kid
And I wonder why I'm all messed up (up up up up)
'Cause we gotta be responsible sometimes
Being a class act nevermind my alumni
I don't wanna be a round a baby so dumb high
I don't see the beauty of a momma on insides
Curled up with my head on your chest
It's the best remedy for the pain and the stress
If the world doesn't change then we'll never get dressed
It will be like this to the kiss of the death
Of my soul, bowl of the blue dream, no
Not a good team, once soul, two halves
No joke, who laughs?
Just us (Just us, just us)

Okay, got this OJ and Jose
Mixed it up with that Rose
We gon' do this our own way
Alright, okay
What is it that your smoking?
Piece it up with this peace and love
And this peace and love like the old days

What I am trying to say is
The love is ours to make so we should make it
Everything else can wait
The time is ours to take so we should take it

We should lay right here

You and I are meant to be
I have waited lifetimes to find you
Now that you're here
I can remind you
Of the things you've been dreamin'
Times two
I promise you
If you just give me 24
Man, all I need is 24 hours
I promise you'll want plenty more
You'll probably be with it forever
So how does it sound
Us on the ground
Giving you my love?
There's no place quite like here
There's no better time than now
You gotta stay ready
There's no place quite like here
There's no better time than now
That's why I stay ready

Tell me find your spot with the warning that I might slip
And when you climb on top that's the ultimate road trip
Ride on my like your Pac got me thinkin' it's 96'
I can rap on some nineties shit, wrap your leggings around my hip
I'm so hip to it tourists want to come speculate
But if I stay monogamous promise this kiss will always taste like candy
And yea, it's obvious momma now probably can't stand me
I'm sure they're tired of this look that you have when you're antsy
We gon' fuck around (Mm) we gon' fuck around
And triple through triplets of babies right now
And that might break the record and no, that don't mean you're fertile
That means we're fucking reckless, plus we don't use protection
I find myself reading old text messages when I'm bored
We find ourselves sexting 'til that connection is restored
I know that sounds immature, but if we never grow up
Then I wish you good luck on the seas that's inside this wall

Come to me
Come, come to me
Look at what you've done to me
You put a gun to me
Then you brought the sun to me

Shine like blood diamonds
Learning to have patience
Only cause you are timeless
The universe energy doesn't lie
And this chemistry is infinity at a million

I wrote a million rhymes to scrabble your

You steady always on the go

But comin' from that pretty mouth
The truth is fitting

Yea you know what I'm talkin' bout

If everything is dipped in gold
Then baby it will never grow
Everything sweet ain't sugar coated

Racing to the sky

Can save us
And take us

The falling from the sky
Just remind of the days when you was crying for attention
I ignored it as a phase until you couldn't
Take the tension
Now I wish you would have stayed
Walking through the smoke and mirrors
I'm burdened, you burning bridges
Memories fading, faded it help you to not remember
The trials and tribulations
Eyes red from crying
The perfect way to disguise it you was
Blinded by our fate
Please don't rain on my parade because this
Float was built for you
Kinda hard to chase you down when you
Floating through the room
All you wanted was the truth and all I wanted was my way

Off the grid and into paradise, her whole life on a ride
Her whole life was on a ride, on a ride, life was on a ride

Sailing through the cosmic seas
Her celestial frequency was needed
To fulfill the prophecy
She was too real to believe in
Though if they would, she could free them
From the truth that they've been told a lie, their whole life
On a ride, yeah whole life was on a ride, on a ride
Life is on a ride, your whole life is on a ride
Your whole life is on a ride

Your whole life is on a ride, always wondered why
Use to be so different you were not this type of guy
Always set aside all your extra pride
Then you started trippin' different bitches on the side
And I am not surprised, no I am not surprised
You always demanded things that I could not supply
And I could not survive

You landed on the window of pain, simple and plain
It's hard for you to fly in the rain
The way love goes is not the way that it came
Come fly, un-die, be born again

Ripped apart and get put back together

Nothing would be what it is, because everything would be what it isn't
And contrary wise, everything what it is, it wouldn't be
And what it wouldn't be, it would

Cats and rabbits would reside in fancy little houses
And be dressed in shoes and hats and trousers
In a world of my own
All the flowers would have very extra special powers
They would sit and talk to me for hours

Good advice to stay where you are until someone finds you
But, but who'd ever think to look for me here
Good advice

I give myself very good advice, but I very seldom follow it
That explains the trouble I'm always in
'Be patient' is very good advice, but the waiting makes me curious
And I love the change, should something strange begin
Well I went along my merry way and I never stopped to reason
I should've know there'd be a price to pay some day
I do give myself very good advice, but I very seldom follow it
Will I ever learn to do the things I should?

You were with your friends
And I still keep thinking about how
Dumb I have been
Did you know that you were just a waste of
Space in my head
And I hate how you keep on showing
Up in my dreams yeah yeah

And my heart says oh
Baby I just wanna be with you
And my mind says no
Leave me I don't wanna be with you
And if I tell you to leave me
It means stay here with me
Now what should I do?

Memory stuck like glue
Her face, her voice
Sail across the seas with you
Can you hear all the angels?

When you feel like you're out there on your own
Know there is someone watching over you
When out at sea, feels love can let go
Oh sailor, we will blow the wind right
But if you die out there, tearing you into two
I hope you know that you could sail right on
I hope you know you got the ocean blue

No sound worse than silence 
A curse that grows 
Big words kept in
Whispers of dreams untold
Just don't fight all the angels

Is that your chain?
'Bout twenty-four inches is how low I let it hang

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
I'm hot, kid
Chain's so low you would think that diamonds never stop it 
And it's funny 'cause you could never stop it
A bunch of rocks on my hand 'n I ain't even on the block yet 
Show 'em white gold, sorta hold 'em like my Tim's 
And a chain hang twenty-four inches like the rims 
Diamonds all blown up, yeah, sorta like a pimp

It starts glistenin' off the Tims (off the Tims)

Imma real big kid 'cause we do it real big

Keep a chick on my arm more than a watch
She started lookin' at my fingers maybe 'cause of the rocks
And now the G's on the block shock like the watch
It's like a car show when I open up my garage
Vipers Maserati's Lamborghini drop tops
Cuty Cuty hydraulics once we drop it like it's hot
It's all on tape matter fact you all are fake
So that four will make ya head alternate
'Cause while I'm stabbin' and jabbin' you get to rappin' and actin'
And try to make it a habit but tricks ain't for silly rabbits
Flawless style will make you shake
Girls cry me a river like Timberlake
That's like the music that's trapped in a stereo wrapped in
A Gift that you rap so you ain't hearin' jack then

They wanna see the T.I.P. of my clip think I betta' get a grip

So all you big babies can keep on ya bibs
Stayin' on tour while my album gettin' shipped
Tryin' to get four picks plain bus car ships
So give it a break and still call Jibbs the great
You need to chill wit ya grill sayin' Jibbs a fake
Cause while you be grillin' ya boy Jibbs be chillin'
I'm tryin' to make me some millions put chandeliers in da ceiling
Do it big I'm tryin' to get more on my plate
While you goin' half crazy I put half on a lake
So sixteen's I spit for sixteen you get
By sixteen I'm livin' like sixteen was millions

Wit them big big chains and we fly big planes
Copter so fly so we flyin' through the rain

Cause I been with it in fact I'm a throw a hit with it
Tried to blow ma mind when she turned around and spent with it

So we could take it on back to the floor ma
If you ain't dancing than you looking at the door ma
And she'll fall if she do a little more ma
Next thing she saw was the Lamborghini doors ha

I'm 'bout to start of shopping, you know them tags we popping
Only the freshest I'm rocking, I'm grabbing new fits
It kind of hard to fall but it?s so easy to ball
When I be hitting the mall to grab a new chick

Steady going telling 'bout the party I'm throwing
I'm already knowing that she feeling the way that I'm flowing
Take the girl from her and I'm a bring her out the Lew
Letting her see the palm trees, showing her how Cali do

From burning one to doing the bounce then we hitting the crunk
As soon as we open them and any doors the party gone jump
As soon as we turn up the music the speakers go bump
And any body sitting down we gone tell ?em get up

Now I think it's just time for you to move
It's time for you to hit a home run like a bat girl
I know you heard this before but I'm a tell you some more
So listen carefully while I put it in fast forward

Either you gon? stretch or either you gon? fold
Either you gon? ride or get rolled on
Which one is it or they pay you a visit?

Comin' up in da hood where the streets are cold
Either you gon? stretch or either you gon? fold
Either you gon? ride or get rolled on
Which one is it or they pay you a visit?

What you gon? do? You gon? ride? You gon? roll?
You gon? stretch? You gon? fold? You gon? keep yo family po?
Comin' up in da hood watchin' my homies take the pressure
That's why I chose to be a mic-checka

What you gon? do? You gon? ball? You gon? fall?
Let 'em knock you into walls? Leave you dead in a hall
Or you gon? keep hanging in the streets with your crew
Don't ask me 'cause I know what I'm a do

But what you gon? do?
Buy the solos with the dodo?s and nogo?s, and fofo?s
In choke holds after getting chased by the po po?s
You gon? ride solo or is you gon? group it?
Or is you gon? think before you start being stupid

Comin' up in da hood where the streets are cold
Either you gon? stretch or either you gon? fold
Either you gon? ride or get rolled on
Which one is it or they pay you a visit?

Comin' up in da hood where the streets are cold
Either you gon? stretch or either you gon? fold
Either you gon? ride or get rolled on
Which one is it or they pay you a visit?

Now what chu gon? do? You gon? rob? You gon? kill?
Buy the drugs or you gon? deal or go out and chase a mil
Or on the other hand get a deal like me
And go and write 48 bars to a beat

Tell me what you gon? do? Be another family failure
Disrespectin' all your elders, go livin' in a shelter
Or you gon? get killed put in jail or be a doctor
And own a big house on the roof a helicopter

Whatchu gon? do?
Stay in the same city, same hood, same block
Same homies changing clothes, wearin' each others socks
Or do you wanna go somewhere a life to try to live
And see about a hundred making money, taking trips

Comin' up in da hood where the streets are cold
Either you gon? stretch or either you gon? fold
Either you gon? ride or get rolled on
Which one is it or they pay you a visit?

Comin' up in da hood where the streets are cold
Either you gon? stretch or either you gon? fold
Either you gon? ride or get rolled on
Which one is it or they pay you a visit?

What you gon? do? Be a fed, be a star, do the dance, hit the bar
Be a face nigga, sharp or go and shop, and stuff
Hit the mall, pop tags, start stuff
Get me red, white and blue like the flag

Jibbs what you gon? do? Gettin' money, stay off the streets
They frontin' man, it ain't funny, I ain't runnin'
Hopin' from place to place like a bunny kinda sunny
Phone on my waist vibrate 'cause it?s comin'
Stay in shape, last in the game is music business funny

For the sake that my hood cats hungry
Tryin' to get a mil deal, bread and bologna
For the sake that my hood cats that are hungry
Tryin' to get a mil deal, bread and bologna

Comin' up in da hood

Jibbs,"You a gold digging, I ain't messin' wit
'Cause I'm a rhino, I'm a rhino
And I ain't no, you can go find yo
And tryin' those, and sign no

Go? on and throw the digits or I ain't messin' with no
'Cause I'm a rhino, I'm a rhino
And I ain't no to go find no
And tryin' those and sign no

Ah, my name is Jibbs but they call me mighty trump
The kid down a house with an outer space flow
Stay waved up, poking madden with a flow
Jag chillin' in the back with girls holla at a chump

Who you know gotta sea with a 3 in double beat
I write my own stuff never will I need a ghost
Spit so cold that you prolly need a coat
And I keep bread 'til I bring about a house

Clownin' on stage but Jibbs is no hoe
Lil? Lewis got ?em hangin' from a rope
All my diamonds real, no gold or glass coat
If you all washed up, don't drop the soap

Beastaz the music don't bang that low
It bring ya feet where you can't feel yo toes
And I'm the hottest, come on keep it on the low
And they mad 'cause I riot and I fly like a crow

You a gold digging, I ain't messin' wit
'Cause I'm a rhino, I'm a rhino
And I ain't no, you can go find yo
And tryin' those, and sign no

Go? on and throw the digits or I ain't messin' with no
'Cause I'm a rhino, I'm a rhino
And I ain't no to go find no
And tryin' those and sign no

Spit one?s rhymes one to me is like fire
That's because I gotta spread around like a high
Jibbs and the whole lil' lewis is a try
And we keep goin' higher 'til we see ourselves fly

Spit punch lines, we hit you in ya ear
When I'm at a concert girls be drawin' tears
Move ?em in the dark no havin' no fears
And callin' me a space ship the way I'm switchin' gears

If you a gold digger, I'm platinum plus
Diamond out bizzle, don't let the platinum rust
Boy perfect timing but I ain't gon' speak with glocks
All up in your speakers, they call me speaker box

You a gold digging, I ain't messin' wit
'Cause I'm a rhino, I'm a rhino
And I ain't no, you can go find yo
And tryin' those, and sign no

Go? on and throw the digits or I ain't messin' with no
'Cause I'm a rhino, I'm a rhino
And I ain't no to go find no
And tryin' those and sign no

People when I see themselves, that Jibbs is a beast
One of me is like 5, so move more than 3
Back for I gotta make my money increase
And 5 is the reason why they lock my the key

So if you ain't throwin' then you need to catch a chorus
Keep switchin' timbs, keep trees like a forest
Deal with the rhymes like my sign is a Taurus
And I'm all about mine, you can keep mindin' yours

Now speak for yourself, I'ma keep goin' high
I'm so above average I don't think you wanna try
I?ma tell the truth that I don't have to lie
And I'm beastin' my peer I don't think you wanna try

You can mess with Jibbs, man, I think you won't know
'Cause this rap thing, I been doin long
So you need to sit down with the thing
'Cause I?ma just make your head spin

You a gold digging, I ain't messin' wit
'Cause I'm a rhino, I'm a rhino
And I ain't no, you can go find yo
And tryin' those, and sign no

Go? on and throw the digits or I ain't messin' with no
'Cause I'm a rhino, I'm a rhino
And I ain't no to go find no
And tryin' those and sign no

You a gold digging, I ain't messin' wit
'Cause I'm a rhino, I'm a rhino
And I ain't no, you can go find yo
And tryin' those, and sign no

Go? on and throw the digits or I ain't messin' with no
'Cause I'm a rhino, I'm a rhino
And I ain't no to go find no

A yo this beat is bananas
A King Kong you can put 'em in the trunk of the McClaren
When we do it they fall off, fall off
When they look at my ride, you see the doors fall off
And the wheels look flat, trunk so heavy in the back
Got the speakers in the front, they be sitting on my lap
Got a bumper to the back, with the trunk weighing it down
Look they think it's a lowrider when they come from my town
That's a King Kong, in the trunk, that's the gorillas behind me
When I'm rolling through your hood anybody can find me
You can hear me from the next block
When I'm on the next block, when I'm headed to the next block
Got you jumping to the next block

I got beats up in the trunk
All the ladies want to chase me when they hear my system bump

Say Jibbs I'm about to head out to the Bruin
Holla at you about fedy, hit my celly soon as you ready
Count this cheese like a deli
They thought I was a lunatic when I pulled up to the telly
I had that candy coated chevy, showing it's grill like it's nelly
And the ladies love me why is that,
They love the way I be getting my lean on
Flip the diamond, and get a multi colored diamond bling on
That King Kong, yea I bet ya this gon' be the theme song
Cause that King Kong will have your ears ringing like a ring tone

Yea, yea, yea, yeah
Them boys is knockin', I got it on lock
Cause I make hits like I'm boxing
Start it up and it sound like a block hit it
Then a hater, hating inside, like don't pop with this

While ya blinking, have ya bopper looking like you been drinking

So when they speaking on it all they gon' speak of is a beaster boy
So don't make me just treat ya to a feast

A beast'll just beat off both of your ear drums

Deep inside you know the truth 
He don't really love you 
Baby, you've gotta face the truth 
You know I'ma keep it real with you 
Let's be real 

I was December in the Chi 
When I saw you walking by 
With the tears in your eyes 
And I walked up to your side 
So I asked you how you feel 
Girl is everything alright 
I want you to keep it real 
Girl you ain't got to lie 
See that dude is a mark 
A predator and a shark 
And I knew that from the start 
He wanted to break your heart 
You ain't got to think twice 
Cause I ain't that type of guy 
I'd rather see you happy 
I don't want to see you cry 
Let's be real, come on now 
Let's be real, he got no love 
Like I have for you, really feeling bad for you 
Out of all of this time he never had love I have for you 

[Chorus]

He disrespect ya, he don't protect ya 
I know it hurts but you got to keep your head up 
He doesn't love ya, but I can treat you better 
That's why I think me and you should be together 
He doesn't need ya, bet I can please ya 
He doesn't trust ya, forever triny to treat ya 
He doesn't look at ya texture 
You should tell him that he really got you messed 
Tell him to beat it, me in your life you need it 

I'm willing to do whatever, you really can't beat it 
I'm your keeper, my words you need to keep it 
Fresher, I could be the reason why you breathing 

[Chorus]

He disrespect ya, he don't protect ya 
When you in need he don't hurry to catch ya 
Hurt and neglect ya, certain to stress ya 
I ain't your daddy girl, you can do whatever 
Let's be for real, come on now, Let's be for real, you know what's 
Up Let's be real, come on now, let's be real, forever ma 

It's best you let him go, or you will never know 
What we could be, why can't you see 
What we could be, why can't you see 
I'm the one for you

Never leave home without my heat or chrome
Strapped like a beeper on my hip
Ready to flip when the heat is on
Hop in the Lac with Axl Foley
Presidential Roley make niggas want to hold me for ransom
And some bitches know me
My niggas told me
Them bitches love holding pockets
Get out a pocket
I'll knock your jaw out your socket
Then squash this
Fold up a little S-see
Best be on my see-H-E-S-T
If niggas test me
Let's see
Which nigga gonna meet Elvis Presley
Best be like what up my niggas let up like a Nestles Crunch
And start to punch niggas
Soon they gonna crunch
Fall on the dance floor
Haul off your ass into my hands slow
Get the show cancelled

You can sit back relax to my ghetto sound
This is for the hoes, niggas

It gets mega trifling when your struggling and your striving
Surviving
I'm stuck to the strip for my grip
Penitentiary chances for my cash advances
What's my stances?
Brings this to your hood late night for the trip gold hund's
I want my fetty in tons
Gangs and guns
Five thousand stash what the sum
A nickel slick nigga and I'm up with the sun
So what you got for me cooking in the kitchen
Two birds hella sift got my motherfucking palms itching
So scandalous and my east coast dunns
Shit foaming and bubbling
For my money and the doubling
Respect that the Yak track got me caught up
All this ""D"" and the scrilla ain't never enough
I pop my title like cash I'm in this game for a Franklin
Serious rap shit got a young nigga banking
Street stanking

Plastered to the wall I'm behind the scenes

Started off that Crystal and budded

I'm never above it
I stays true to it
Better flew in like fluid
I'm knowing how to do it
And partner I've been through it
Sure I'm improving I'm the coldest thing moving
I had some confrontation with some cocky-ass Cuban
He said some black squabbling for some cheddar
And then he had to deepen and dict the vendetta
Well anyway I gave my baby mamma my Buretta
And told her that some Cubans might try to come get her
But meanwhile I'm a try to peel them first
But if they invade let your heater disperse
Cock it back bang, bang and do your thing girl
Let them know what's going down in your world
I want a woman with smarts
I want a woman with heart
That won't hesitate to blow your buster ass apart

Pack heat like a sauna
My bang bang clears your whole corner

My red laser beam make you do the running man
A hundred miles an hour top speed you shouldn't of fucked with
The shorty lunatic
And fuck who you with
You should have came with your whole army
Now your duct taped buck naked walking home with no car keys
Yeah you're swoll like Lou Ferigno
But all that shine like glitter it ain't gold
See my crew laced in the finest
Matching Lamborghini and diamonds
I pack the jam
Make niggas say oh damn
Jiboh so cool

Jida,"ขอบคุณที่เธอรับรู้
ขอบคุณที่เธอคอยปลอบกัน
ให้พออย่าร้อง ไม่ต้องไปเสียใจ
ที่เธอคอยปลอบคอยย้ำ
ให้ฉันได้ฟังได้ข่มใจ
แต่ความจริงนั้น
ไม่มีเลยทางใด
ที่จะปิดดวงดาวให้มืดลง
หรือจะสั่งท้องฟ้าเมฆฝนให้สดใส
จะหยุดให้โลกที่ร้อน เย็นลงอย่างไร
ไม่มีทางจะหยุด
น้ำตาของความเสียใจ
ฉันไม่เป็นอะไร
ร้องครวญครางบอกความในใจ
เสียน้ำตาคราวนี้ออกไป
ฉันเสียใจ ยังข่มอารมณ์ไม่ไหว
ฉันไม่เป็นอะไร
รู้ตัวดีต้องทำยังไง
แม้น้ำตายิ่งห้ามยิ่งไหล
ฉันรู้ แค่ไม่นาน ทุกๆอย่าง
จะผ่านไป
ขอบคุณทุกอย่างวันนี้
ถ้อยคำที่ดี ที่ห่วงใย
แค่เธอเท่านั้น เมื่อฉันไม่เหลือใคร
กับความเสียใจเพียงครั้ง
อาจทำให้ฉันนั้นเปลี่ยนไป
แต่หากไม่ร้องก็ไม่ทางใด
ที่จะปิดดวงดาวให้มืดลง
หรือจะสั่งท้องฟ้าเมฆฝนให้สดใส
จะหยุดให้โลกที่ร้อน
เย็นลงอย่างไร
ไม่มีทางจะหยุด
น้ำตาของความเสียใจ
ฉันไม่เป็นอะไร
ร้องครวญครางบอกความในใจ
เสียน้ำตาคราวนี้ออกไป
ฉันเสียใจ ยังข่มอารมณ์ไม่ไหว
ฉันไม่เป็นอะไร รู้ตัวดีต้องทำยังไง
แม้น้ำตายิ่งห้ามยิ่งไหล

Oh Lord I’d stretch you out and in, oh Lord now you should tell a friend

While I dreamt about the places that I would go
We would go door to door to door all day
We were begging 'em to lay up in the foyer
I was sittin' with the hookers in a motel hallway
Waiting on a blind audition like it's Broadway
Now these Madams looking like a fleet of foxes
Rat Pack chief of staff like Sinatra

I'm with the Dalai Lama's homies in the sky lounge
Cocktails got me loosenin' my tie now

You dealing with a king, not a kong out here
You a pawn, but we can get along out here

We know you foul—nigga, two free throws

I don’t understand you, o
Your Auntie and I warned you not to come during election season
But you would not listen

You know I like to drink palm wine, yes
So, all I’m saying is Jidenna, look:
The cow that is in the hurry to go to America will come back here as corned beef

Although we are brothers, your uncle, you know Magnus
Will be the one to make the first move on your life

So heavy is the head of he that wears the ring

And I’ve come to bury him in the jungle
It’s where we were from so a nigga stayed humble

Shot ​me in the foot put a bullet through my armor
I’mma kill ‘em when I see ‘em again

AKs on they back shining like swords
Pops would say “Once you’re bitten by a snake
The paranoia make you pop a lizard in the face”

The village hear the guns firing
A salute and a siren, Chief’s arriving
I walk by the choir and drummers vibin’
The parade so alive you wouldn’t think someone died
They shoutin’ “Our chief is with us”
Strangers claim they my cuz
They plottin’ to take all my land
They must forgot who the fuck dat I am
I greet my uncles with a case of gifts
From the thrift, they treat it like Saks Fifth
He greet me with a dish
I’ve weighed the risk
Paid the cater to switch plates in case it’s a hit
These muh’fuckas wanna poison my soup
I wish I could trust ‘em like the boys in blue, but uh
In the villa, never eat what they give ya
You’re with your fam but your fam may not be wit ya

They lower him in the ground
I shovel dirt on the mound
Darkness falling, I can’t stick around
No time to grieve, one hour the flight leaves
I feel thieves and witches within the trees
Hop in a Jeep and on dirt road we speed
Someone chasing us, Hummers chasing us
A runaway train, I ain’t taking no breaks in this

White Niggas, white nigga
White Niggas, white nigga

They found you out
They surround your house
They caught you while you were knocked, down for the count
And now they coming for ya, make sure you hide your daughter
Her skin is light, her eyes are bluer plus her hair is blonder
They known for killing those children, and they'll just get acquitted
Claiming the girl is armed, though they know damn well she isn't
That's why some girls are picking up the heat
And that leads to all the white-on-white crime flooding the streets
Suddenly there's a

“Columbia Police search warrant!
Columbia Police search warrant!”

“Kick it open”
They kick in the door, knocking over your golf clubs
Poppin' your dog up in the mug, spilling your Napa Valley
Wine all over all your Persian rugs, now her blood is boiling
They rush her while she flushing all her drugs down the toilet

When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,

Ahora paso contento todos los dias
Caminando por la calle como si ella mia
Solamente mia y de nadie mas
Si me da mucho me enloquezco no soy capaz
Si me busca me encuentra
No vivo en la tienda
Ando con toy selecta de feria en feria
El con su chica y yo contigo
Tu eres mas feliz cuando estas conmigo
Al diablo tus amigos
Solo los dos
Me fascina tu sonrisa cuando escucha mi voz
Tirados en el parque mirando las nubes
Escuchando unas rolas de los angeles azules

There's the reference, the understood preference is that I'm biased
To black shh, black shh to keep me more hype
Seasoned trees get minus disposed right there
Mixed it the ten piece, divide my share
Amongst niggas to overrun it, it's a long climb to the summit
On the lazy afternoon, on the boom oh how I love it
So I does it but imagine if I wasn't, fascinated
Wit the sense of heat that stressin me, fled to frustrated
Ticked off, pissed off, tried to get my dick off
I'm savin a little money, twenty dollars ain't shit
I'm still hungry, and thirsty

Defeat the purpose of the circus, guess who the animals (guess who)

We stompin black holes in space
If you tore this wicked system down, what would you build in its place?
You gotta plan then we rollin (come on), don't waste my time (please)
There is land that is stolen which is rightfully mine
What if slavery never happened and we was never colonized?
What if governments never lied and white folks apologized?
Or if the environment didn't create the context for the art
When niggas celebrate the death and breakin black mommas hearts
What part, would a MC like me play wit my positive talents play
If there was no negativity to keep the balance?

What if eighty seven never happened?
No innovative hip-hop, no crack kingpin, no park hand-clappin
Damn, one to his chest, the tool jam
He tried to flash a black casket, his son's a bastard
What if the guns was gone soon as your sons was born?

Rapidly tappin the frequency and get dissed by chemist

Crushin the globe on a quest for your long lost souls
What if I catch the red-eye flight to J-A

So what you if tried to spit my brain's a pit, throw em in
Shake a watchness up and stitch his lips to the opening

Demanded, the day da county dazzlely degenerate

Deep thought wit Shadow Man in Miami we do things
Like sellin rap nigga's hoes to y'all for weddin rings
Wit more mysteries than conspiracies wit change links
We're strangely spittin thoughts by my lonely
After all this close contact you still don't know me

What if? to me is the same question I've asked myself
Exactly twenty years I just blew the penitentiary
Imagine if disease, prejudice didn't exist
Materialistic dreams of purchasing that Lexus would be deaded
What if we remained primitive depended on natural resources?
To live and didn't have technology to abort our kids
How about if there was no rated-are flicks to corrupt our minds?
Or if world wars ain't take place and didn't interrupt our times?
What if this free world shit didn't have us hypnotized?
Or cannibalism was a permanent state of mind?
The death rate, grows faster than we can produce yellow tape
The main suspect is society for committing this mistake
Categorizing everything, I sit back and dig up some more ""what if's""

Are you ready for this action
Does it give you satisfaction
Are you hip to what I'm sayin'
If you are then let's start swayin'

Jilian Nershi,"Well, one of these days I'm sure to wake up dead
No one gets out alive, I've heard it said
I'll reach to the sky and find a hole in the middle
Or look straight down and see Hell's hot griddle
Leapin' the moon with a hey, diddle, diddle

Chorus
Just passin' through
Just passin' through
And there ain't a damned thing about it you can do

It's a sweet, short ride through a beautiful place
If ya can't dig it, it's a real disgrace
It's a miracle and it's commonplace, and hey
It's gonna happen anyway

Precious Dear, take a good close look at me
You never know if it's the last time you will see
This transitory piece of celestial matter
This little ol' morsel of God's sweet batter
I once was former. I'll soon be latter

[chorus]

Well, it seems to me that a bad rap's laid on death
As though you're weak to breath your own last breath
Well, it ain't as if I don't really love livin'
Not a little bit sick of the taking and the giving
But when I go, it'll all be forgiven

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

I feel about you
anymore. Mm hm.
I can't hold the hurt inside,

anymore. Mm hm.

My mind keeps recreating
a love with you alone
And I'm tired of pretending
I don't love you anymore.

Let me make one last appeal
to show you how I feel
about you.  Mm hm.
'Cause there's no one else I swear
holds a candle anywhere
next to you.  Mm hm

My heart can't take the beating
not having you to hold.
A small voice keeps repeating
deep inside my soul.
It says I can't keep pretending
I don't love you anymore.

I've got to take the chance
or let it pass by
if I expect to get on with my life.

She wonders if he's taller than his father was
Does he drive a car by now, has he been in love

She knows things turn out the way they should be
But she just can't help but ask herself

I keep looking for your face
The passengers can see my pain

Drive until you find me here
We'll have pillow fights, movie nights
A fire just for you, inside

Hide in my kaleidoscope tonight

I wear your sweaters into bed
I end the book you read
I think I'll read it once again
The chapter never ends

I got a nice room with a view
It's waiting just for you
I hope that you've been waiting too
Don't let go

When you feel the world shake from the words that are said

And private eyes solve marriage lies cause we don't talk for years
And football teams are kissing Queens
And losing sight of having dreams
In a world that what we want is only what we want until it's ours

Called 'Boulder to Birmingham'""

And I know there's life below me
But all that you can show me 
Is the prairie and the sky

I don't want to hear your sad stories
About heartache and desire
The last time I felt like this
I was in the wilderness
And the canyon was on fire
And I stood on the mountain, in the night
And I watched it burn, I watched it burn
I watched it burn

And I'd rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham
I'd hold my life in his saving grace 
I'd walk all the way from Boulder to Birmingham 
If I thought I could see, I could see your face

Well, you really got me this time 
And the hardest part is knowing I'll survive 
I've come to listen for the sound 
Of the trucks as they rolled on
Out on Highway 95
Pretending it's the ocean 
Coming down to wash me clean, to wash me clean 
You know what I mean

And I'd rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham
I'd hold my life in his saving grace

Before the tears of innocence like a hard rain would desend

My people heard the thundering as the iron horse crossed the land
Its echoes drowning out the cries of those who could not understand
My people watched the buffalo dying in the sun
While those tracks of steal lead to the sea, their will be done

Now their blood flows through these rivers and then into our veins
And their hearts are beating louder then all the years of shame
And their blood flows through these rivers just like an endless rain
And their hearts are beating louder then all the years of shame

Their shadows cast on sacred ground for all enturnity

And you can't leave the past behind

You know that's something I have always loved you for
Katie-Lynn, this one has brought you to the ground
And Katie-Lynn, we all feel we've let you down

Katie-Lynn, I am unsure of what to say
'Cause you and I both know it's been too long
Katie-Lynn, it finally came to me today
Katie-Lynn, I didn't take the time to pray

So all the words you heard were bouncing, bouncing off of you
And all the lines drawn in to save you were just getting in the way of love
And did you ever believe what we were saying? And can I blame you?
'Cause how transparent was I, were you looking at me?

Katie-Lynn, you've always had those dancing gypsy eyes
And a spirit that longed to try its wings
Petite ouseau, you flew into a clouded sky
How could you see your good intentions wouldn't get you by

But you could rise upon the wings of the eagles
If you would only choose to leave the empty way you live
And could you see, could you see, you don't have to prove yourself to me
Let it go, let your pain finally slide off your back down at His feet

'Cause all the love he shows is just bouncing
And all the hands we're reaching out are just getting in the way
And if it's gonna take more to hold you, to show you're loved in spite of you
How transparent am I when you're looking at me?

So you can see I know you've chosen your own way
And it's hard but it's the road you've traveled on
And I pray my life more than these words
Will clearly say that Jesus loves you, He's loved you all along

It's a sure sign of a wrong turn

Waited by all the baggage you are holding 
Clutching it tight with all of your might

To dutifully further your facade

This is the time when I find what's inside of me 
This is the time when I decide what I believe

You stripped me down to basics 
You left my heart exposed 
There is no pride in times like this

No one said it was fair 
But nobody's happy when it is

When the house I built comes crashing down

And start fighting back to gain control 
And this is how it feels to let freedom in 
And break these chains that enslave my soul

I refuse to be locked up in here like a prison cell 
Where all I ever get is a meal and four walls 
I used to be just fine in here but not anymore 
Gonna break through these steel bars

And you find yourself at the losing end 
Tell me how it feels, you're not welcome here

Where all I ever get is a meal and four walls 
I used to be just fine in here but not anymore 
Gonna break through these steel bars",Steel Bars,1999
Jill Phillips,"Well you came just like they said you would 
Like you always have from what I've seen and heard 
And you took our dreams and future plans 
Crushed them all like grains of sand 

Even still, even still 
You have no power, you never will 
And even still, even still 
You have no power and you never will 

Easy to say, but it's hard to live 
When life itself is near the end 
Because that fear resides in every soul 
When it shows its face, it's good to know 

So when the hourglass is empty 
And there's knocking at my door 
I don't want my fear to grip me 
So I'll sing this 'till I'm sure",Even Still,2003
Jill Phillips,"When you start to doubt if you exist 
God believes in you 
Confounded by the evidence 
God believes in you 

When your light burns so dim 
When your chances seem so slim 
And you swear you don't believe in Him 

God believes in you 
When you rise up just to fall again 
God believes in you 
Deserted by your closest friends 
God believes in you 

When you're betrayed with a kiss 
And you turn your cheek to another fist 
It doesn't have to end like this 
God believes in you 

Everything matters if anything matters at all 
Everything matters no matter how big 
No matter how small 
God believes in you 

Oh God believes in you 
When you're so ashamed that you could die 
God believes in you 
And you can't to right even though you try 
God believes in you 

Blessed are the ones who grieve 
The ones who mourn and the ones who bleed 
In sorrow you sow but in joy you'll reap 
God believes in you 

Oh blessed are the ones who grieve 
The ones who mourn and the ones who grieve 
In sorrow you sow but in joy you'll reap 
God believes in you 
Oh God believes in you",God Believes in You,2003
Jill Phillips,"All the weary, tired souls full of hunger 
Needing something that fills 
All the thirsty that heard about living water 

Need a way to the well 
It's a strange crowd 
But still somehow 
The lost have been found 
By the One in whose Name we come 

Grace and peace to you through our Lord Jesus 
Times like these we need that kind of love 
To take these things coming in between us 
And wash us clean with the body and the blood 
Early that night just before he was taken 

He broke of the bread 
So we could taste that He has died, He is risen 
He is coming again 
And it's much more 
Than we could ask for 
To be made pure 
By the One in whose Name we come",Grace and Peace,2003
Jill Phillips,"I knew it all along that this day was coming 
Even though I knew it doesn't hurt any less 
But somehow the suffering draws me to You 
I could start running in anger 
But then what's the point of a Savior 

I feel the pain but it still doesn't change who You are 
Nothing I feel is outside of the reach of Your arms 
My whole world could crumble but all of the pieces remain 
In Your hands that are waiting to put them together again 

Just like I know You will in Your own time, in Your own wisdom 
One day I'll look back and see the grand design 
Maybe it will make sense then, these questions I have 

But with it all here front and center 
Sometimes it's hard to remember 
I could start running in anger 
But then what's the point of a Savior",Grand Design,2003
Jill Phillips,"The weight I fastened on trying to make my world run 
Almost pinned me to the floor 

I could not orchestrate one solitary day 
And the more I worked I found my efforts all in vain 
I believe that I need to let go of these things 

To be free 
So help me stop this hanging on 
All my worry got was more of what I did not want 
A love of power and control 

Every hour running kept me in my starting place 
When I finally rested I began to win this race 
There is only so much I can do with these two hands 
Precious is the freedom when I finally understand 
That I need to let go of these things",Hanging On,2003
Jill Phillips,"I've got so much on my mind
I have to get it off my chest
Have to open up my mouth and speak the truth
I let the little words out right
But leave the biggest stone unturned
It's like I'm trying to keep the light from taking root

But I'm never gonna' clean this slate
At the rate I'm going
Have to dig in to find the strength
To follow through
I've shown forgiving myself is something I can't do
So I'll leave it up, leave it up to you
I'll leave it up to you

'Cause if it were up to me
To pull myself out of this place
A failure's what I'd be without your grace

'Cause it's never gonna' wash me clean
This muddy water
Your river is the only thing
To make me new
I've shown forgiving myself is something I can't do
So I'll leave it up, leave it up to you
I'll leave it up to you 

The God of a million second chances
'Cause the chances are
That I'll return and take the wheel
A million times or more",Leave It Up to You,2003
Jill Phillips,"It's the cliched writing on the wall 
Funny how it's been there all along 
And all the while you've listened to 
Anyone who had a point of view on what you should do 

The liars in your head are growing loud 
They say you're in too deep to turn back now 
And answers seem so hard to find 
You wonder if you still can change your mind change your mind 

There's something to be said for patience 
So hold on to what you know is sacred 
Don't let your only dream be taken 
And cashed in for everything you've hated 

You have something there that can't be sold 
A lifetime full of secrets to be told 
And it is not too late to choose 
The narrow winding way that few men do so few men do",Sacred,2003
Jill Phillips,"When the storm clouds dark and gray threaten to rain 
Still is my soul, 
Still is my soul 
When the waves come crashing in to wash me away 
Still is my soul, 
Still is my soul 
When the winter wind starts blowing in 

Freezing over every stream 
There's a peace that passes understanding 
Flowing like a current beneath 
Still is my soul, 
Still is my soul, 
Still is my soul 
Even when the whole world turns against me 
And there's nowhere to hide 

Still is my soul, 
Still is my soul 
I know the greatest treasures aren't found in this life 
Still is my soul, 
Still is my soul 
When the trials of this world rise against me 
I will face them all unafraid 
There's a peace that passes understanding 
Coursing through the blood in my veins 
Still is my soul, 
Still is my soul, 
Still is my soul 

When these lungs take in their last breath it won't be goodbye 
Still is my soul, Still is my soul 
Though my time on earth is over my love is alive

Jill Phillips,"The water rose above my head 
The next thing I remember I was carried down the stream 
Left me washed up on that shore 
But the power of the flood still burned inside of me 

It's the way of the fire 
It's the way of the fire 
I took the first step without fear 
I didn't see the danger of what the stream could do 

Then I felt the undertow 
Of all the things I asked for coming true 
It's the way of the fire 
(Just one step into the flame) 
It's the way of the fire 
(He starts consuming everything) 
And it's all gonna' burn 
(I'm refined and strengthened by) 
The way of the fire 

I don't know how long I have been 
Lying in the stillness staring up at blue 
But I hear the voice within 

Say ""Come back in the water"", and I do 
And the river's rise is a scary thing 
But it always runs downstream 
The way of the fire",The Way of the Fire,2003
Jill Phillips,"Humble yourself before the Almighty 
That's where you find true wisdom 
Make it your first step, make it your last thought 
Lying in bed when the day's done 

Hear it calling out your name 
In the busy streets in the center of town 
Who will turn their face to truth and then live it out 

Wisdom is greater than any fleeting 
Pleasure that money brings you 
Answers will come to those who pursue 
The pathway to life that few choose 

Hear it calling out your name 
In the busy streets in the center of town 
Who will turn their face to truth and then live it out 

Knowledge awaits you filling your arms 
With more than they ever could grasp 
Blessed are you who hunger for truth 
And keep your eyes fixed on what lasts

Who will turn their face to truth and then live it out",Wisdom,2003
Jill Phillips,"Just when my tears were falling deep enough to drown
Down in the valley of the shadow of a doubt
When I gave up that's when 
He came to lift me out and set me high

When I saw it as a gift of matchless worth
I started thinking it was something I deserved
He pulled the rug from underneath 
Without a word and left me dry

Piece together these little mysteries
It isn't hard to see the writing on the wall
Triumph and tragedy, only God can be
Both the builder and the wrecking ball

He gave them freedom and a fertile promise land
They took for granted their deliverance at hand
Thirty-nine years later 
They're still walking through that sand

Wondering why
And He builds it up
And He knocks it down
Just to build it up even stronger",Wrecking Ball,2003

I been or who I saw or

Baby don't worry you know that you got me

If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby don't worry you know that you got me

Somebody told me that this planet was small
We use to live in the same building on the same floor
And never met before
Until I'm overseas on tour
And peep this Ethiopian queen from Philly
Taking classes abroad
She studying film and photo flash focus record
Said she workin on a flick and
Could my click do the score
She said she loved my show in Paris
At Elysee Montmartre
And that I stepped off the stage
And took a piece of her heart
We knew from the start that
Things fall apart, intentions shatter
She like that shit don't matter
When I get home get at her
Through letter, phone, whatever
Let's link, let's get together
Shit you think not, think the Thought went home and forgot
Time passed, we back in Philly now she up in my spot
Tellin me the things I'm tellin her is makin her hot
Startin buildin with her constantly round the clock
Now she in my world like hip-hop
And keep tellin me

If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby don't worry you know that you got me

If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby don't worry you know that you got me

Yo, I'm the type that's always catchin a flight
And sometimes I gotta be out at the height of the night
And that's when she flip and get on some 'ol
Another lonely night
Seems like I'm on the side you only loving your mic
I know you gotta get that paper daddy keep that shit tight
But yo I need some sort of love in my life, you dig me
While politicin with my sister from New York City
She said she know this ball player and he think I'm pretty
Psych, I'm playin boo, you know it's just wit you I'm stayin boo
And when cats be poppin game I don't hear what they sayin boo
When you out there in the world, I'm still your girl
With all my classes I don't have the time for life's thrills
So when you sweatin on stage think of me when you rhyme
And don't be listenin to your homies they be leavin you blind

Yeah, so what you sayin I can trust you?
Is you crazy, you my king for real
But sometimes relationships get ill
No doubt

If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby don't worry you know that you got me

If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby don't worry you know that you got me

That snake could be that chick
And that rat could be that cool cat
That's whispering ""she tryin to play you for the fool Black""
If something's on your chest then let it be known
See I'm not your every five minutes all on the phone
And on the topic of trust, it's just a matter of fact
That people bite back and fracture what's intact
And they'll forever be I ain't on some ""oh I'm a celebrity""
I deal with the real so if it's artificial let it be
I've seen people caught in love like whirlwinds
Listening to they squads and listening to girlfriends
That's exactly the point where they whole world ends

Oh baby now how we gonna get through? (I don't know) 
Can't go left (uh uh) can't go right (uh uh) 
Don't know how we made it through the night (c'mon c'mon c'mon) 
7 minutes to sunrise 
Oh baby now, what are we gonna do? (Do it, do it..) 

It was once said by Black Thought that ""Things Fall Apart"" 
Knew I shouldn't have been messin' with dude's girl from start 
But I pimp from the heart, the art of it made it interestin'
Plus me and sister blend before we got intimate 
Friend or no friend, my man caught wind 
This chick is payin' me, it'll either cost me or cost him 
Told her she should f lost him (when?) a while ago 
Cause dude'll drink a pile of Mo' and defile her yo 
I ain't here to start on this (nigga) for me to wreck his broad 
You could tell what I thought of this (nigga) 
Nickname was Smoke, don't know if that was cause of cigarettes 
(or what?) or guns he tote, he called shots on the deck 
So I wasn't tryin' to call his bluff, by his persona 
You could see, he think he tough!

I'm hittin' rum straight, thinkin' of a route to truncate 
The streets is watchin', out is one way I put myself in his Nike's 
His position is, ""Aight man, somebody bonin' my lady"" 
Probably snap like Rod-man 
My plan was to meet at this bar called the Tiki (when?) 
'round four, when she was comin' she would beep me 
I sat deep in the corner, drinkin' zombies, becomin' one by now 
Wonderin' if my style would support her and her child 
Out the corner of my eye saw this stud I recognized (who?) 
One of Smoke's guys, to stay out of sight I tried 
Told Jill Scott to meet we coulda picked a better spot 
On some ""Nobody's Supposed to Be Here"" (shit) like Deborah Cox

Not that I'm spooked of dude, I could whup him 
But he was on the horn informin' the rest of them hoodlums (aight) 
Usually I wouldn't fight over a woman, old girl had a sun-shine 
Was messed up, on Smoke's payroll was one-time 
My pager went off, it read one line: ""Come get me 
From Halsted,"" I'm thinkin' this is monkey bar [shit] 
Went to the phone quick, called her (what happened?) Her line was busy 
Situation number nine, got my mind dizzy 
Wondered if this plan was designed to get me

Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, 
Hello

Mmm, this morning my man exclusively introduced me 
To some good extra loving 
He was licking, and sucking on everything, just the way he should 
This morning's extra loving was good 
We lay there sweaty, sex funky, happy as we want to be 
Loving exclusively, my man and me all night all morning 
So our stomachs were growling, hungrily 
So I jumped up and rushed to the store 
In hopes of coming back and getting a little more of 
This morning's good extra loving

At the market the people were pushing and shoving 
Trying to be the next in line, the turn was mine 
The new girl at the counter was cute, but not as fine as me 
Was this some kind of woman's intuition, some kind of insecurity 
Nah, 'cause my man is happy at home loving me exclusively 
So I shook my head, ""whats up?""
""Hello,""she smiled as she rung me up 

Orange juice $3.29, Croissants $4.85 
She sniffed, Butter 89 cents 
She sniffed, Strawberries $1.50 a pint 
She sniffed, and sniffed, and sniffed, and sniffed again 
And then replied, ""Raheem, right?"" 
""Right.""",Exclusively,2000

Jill Scott,"Love rain down on me, on me, down on me
Love rain down on me, on me, down on me
Love rain down on me, on me, down on me
Love rain down on me, on me, down on me

Met him on a Thursday, sunny afternoon
Cumulus clouds, eighty-four degrees
He was brown, deep
Said he wanted to talk about my mission
Listen to my past lives (Word?)
Took me on long walks to places where butterflies rest easy
Talked about Moses and Mumia
Reparations, blue colors, memories of shell-topped Adidas

He was fresh like summer peaches
Sweet on my mind like block parties and penny candy
Us was nice and warm, no jacket, no umbrella, just warm
At night we would watch the stars
And he would physically give me each and every one
I felt like cayenne pepper, red, hot, spicy
I felt dizzy and so near the heavens and miles between my thighs
Better than love, we made delicious
He me had, had me he
He had me tongue-tied
I could hear his rhythm in my thoughts
I was his sharp, his horn section
His boom and his bip
And he was my love

Love rain down on me, on me, down on me

The rain was fallin' and, and slowly and sweetly and stinging my eyes
And I could not see that he became my voodoo priest
And I was his faithful concubine
Wide open, wide, loose like bowels after collard greens
The mistake was made
Love slipped from my lips
Dripped down my chin and landed in his lap
And us became new
Now me non-clairvoyant and in love
Made the coochie easy and the obvious, invisible

The rain was falling
And I couldn't see the season changing
And the vibe slipping off its axis
Our beautiful melody became wildly staccato
The rain was falling and I could not see
That I was to be plowed and sowed and fertilized
And left to drown in his sunny afternoon
Cumulus clouds, eighty-four degrees, melody

Love rain down on me, on me, down on me
Love rain down on me, on me, down on me

Wide open, wide loose
The mistake was made
Love slipped from my lips, my chin, and landed in his lap
And us became new, me non clairvoyant and in love me
Me the fool
You were never true
If you didn't want me, ah, you should have let me know
All you was make a mockery of something so incredible and beautiful
I honestly in love

Jill Scott,"Love rain down on me, on me, down on me

Met him on a Thursday, sunny afternoon
Cumulus clouds, 84 degrees
He was brown, deep
Said he wanted to talk about my mission
Listen to my past lives (Word?)
Took me on long walks to places where butterflies rest easy
Talked about Moses and Mumia
Reparations, blue colors, memories of shell top adidas
He was fresh, like summer peaches
Sweet on my mind like block parties and penny candy
Us was nice and warm, no jacket, no umbrella, just warm
At night we would watch the stars
And he would physically give me each and every one
I felt like cayenne pepper, red, hot, spicy
I felt Dizzy and Sonia, heaven and Miles between my
Thighs
Better than love, we made delicious
He me had, had me he
He had me tongue tied
I could hear his rhythm in my thoughts
I was his sharp, his horn section
His boom and his bop
And he was my love

Love rain down on me, on me, down on me

The rain was fallin and,and slowly and sweetly and stinging 
My
Eyes
And I could not see that he became my voodoo priest
And I was his faithful concubine
Wide open, wide, loose like bowels after collard greens
The mistake was made
Love slipped from my lips
Dripped down my chin and landed in his lap
And us became new
Now me non-clairvoyant and in love
Made the coochie easy and the obvious invisible
The rain was falling
And I couldn't see the season changing
And the vibe slipping off its axis
Our beautiful melody became wildly staccato
The rain was falling and I could not see
That I was to be plowed and sowed and fertilized
And left to drown in his sunny afternoon
Cumulus clouds, 84 degrees, melody

Love rain down on me, on me, down on me (2x)

Wide open wide loose
The mistake was made
Love slipped from my lips
Dripped down my chin and 
Landed in his lap
And us became new
Me not clairvoyant and in love 
Made me the fool
You were never true
If you didn't want me
Ah you should have let me know
All you did was make a mockery of 
Of something so incredible, beautiful

I honestly did love you so.....

Love rain down on me, on me, down on me

(Mos Def:)

I stretch my arms towards the sky like blades of tall grass,
The sun beat between my shoulders like carnival drums.
I sat still and hoped it would help my wings grow
So then I could really be fly.
And then she arrived.
Like daybreak inside a railway tunnel,
Like the new moon,
Like a diamond in the mines,
Like high noon to a junker,
Sudden...
She made my heart beat in the now, now time signature,
Her skin a canvas for ultra violet brush strokes.
She was the sun's painting,
She was a deep cognac color,
Her eyes fall for that lights along the new city,
Her lips purse as if her breath was too sweet and full for her mouth to hold.
I said:
""You are the beautiful distress of mathematics,""
I said:
""For you, I will peal open the clouds like new fruit,
And give you lightning and thunder as a dowry,
I will make the sky shed all of its stars like rain,
And I will cast the constellations across your waste,
And I will make the heavens your keep.
And they will be pleased to cover you,
They will be pleased to cover you,
May I please... cover you...

Jill Scott,"Phone rang, screen said caller ID said blocked
But for some reason I decided to answer it
On the other end was a French accent
He told me we needed to rap quick
Cause he had did some bad shit
And would be gone for years, spending these last two days
With his momma and his kids
When he spoke I wasn't trying to hear it ,cause
I knew he was a real good person
And this didn't seem like it was in his spirit
He couldn't believe as much as I couldn't, what he done
He said now its time for him to turn himself in
No longer could he run, from life, from God
Start thinkin', why is doing right is so hard
I got back to him when we was in London discussin' the new testament
And how our lives related to it, and how we could make the best of it
My voice became destined, so I asked him why you gotta go
He said you know turn to Matthew twenty-four
He said no one knows the hour, nor do they know the day
But the kingdom is near, don't let anything lead you to stray
As long as God is with you, everything will be okay
So right about then, we decided to pray

Just lyin' back makin' the smoke disperse a ray
Deep into clouds
It's makin' things appear to me so clearly
Deep in the clouds

Your time
Is a terrible to waste
For it's
Not one of the possessions that you can bring to space, yeah, it don't matter
Its a challenge
But the chance of seeing, is quite a dream to chase, yes it is
I hope
I remind God of him when he sees my face
He goin' see it

The feeling just keeps on lifting me higher
And its ever flowing it's, ever flowing
When every thing, puts a smile on my face
And I recognize the strong goal
But I keep on going, I keep on going
I keep on going on

Hey mighty love
Watching over me
A smile, brilliant
All over, constantly
Warm, comforting
Perfect, like nothing
No hate, no confusion, no strain
Simply peace, simply
Simply, simply, simply

No fear! Heaven is to me
No fear of destruction
Understanding who he is
His name is Christ
Heaven, heaven is to me
Wisdom, understanding, knowledge

Streets of gold and pearly gates
Halos wings all dressed in white
Angels sing and cymbals glare
No one's rich no one's poor
People dreaming they live free
Making love while they in love
Wonderful dream wake me when you're home

Heaven, heaven is being pops
Heaven is spending the day with your grandchildren
Listenin' to they voices when and they laughing and play
And then at the end of the day we hug we kiss and slowly they walk away
And then suddenly they turn and rush back to me and hug me round the knees
Yeah, that's heaven to me",Heaven Somewhere,2002

Because of this I must say
I, I, I appreciate what you give to me, yeah
I, I appreciate what you give to me, yeah

People say I got soul, look at all the records I hold
The lives I've affected, connect and control
With me in your basement your mama got blown
I provide the vibe to keep the strippers on poles
Through me the black experience is glorious told
From a school that's old, bold, so I rock gold
And platinum, some cats I hold notes and cash for them
On streets I rap with them, in ghettos I blast for them
Mash with them, at the party and all
Be the universal language that's embodying all
Put the Billie Holiday, Bob Marley in y'all
Y'all feel most high when I be in y'all
System, with the rhythm I up jump the boogie
Shame I rely on record labels to push me
Since the bush, I been y'all way to escape
Through eight-tracks, wax, CD's and tapes
I am music

You can feel me all over alive, I help culture survive, I opened the eyes of many
Styles y'all wrote in the skies, with your lows and highs, open your mind to hear me
In the streets I beat cops and obsolete
On every station it's hot, you can't stop my heat
I taught Jay and Dre how to rock the beat
On what's going on today, yo, I gots to speak
I take the stand, yo, you could feel me bam
Whether in Larry Graham or Steely Dan
Live I be killing it man
For how long I survived yo I'm realer than man
Got a soft side but I'm still a man
For me women cry and children dance, I'm trying to eat
I could'a got a mil and ran
But like Sly for the fam still I stand

Beginning of time, yo, beginning of time
Deep in the mind of the ancient ones
Everybody love me like they do the sun
I shine at times, yo, at times I'm dark
You can't categorize me, my mind's a art
Inside my heart, it ain't about climbing charts
I'm the one you roll with when you're riding smart
The change that came, the change that comes
I change with chords and I kick it with drums
Get blow with horns and did it on the one
Riffed for guitars, for the Lord I sung
Spun around the world at parties and weddings
Wherever I go, I create the setting
You know me from lessons or your pop's collection
Whether whole or half stepping, I'm a blessing

Something in the way of things
Something that will quit and won't start
Something you know but can't stand
Can't know get along with
Like death
Riding on top of the car peering through the windshield for his cue
Something entirely fictitious and true
That creeps across your path hallowing your evil ways
Like they were yourself passing yourself not smiling
The dead guy you saw me talking to is your boss
I tried to put a spell on him but his spirit is illiterate

I know things you know and nothing you don't know
'cept I saw something in the way of things
Something grinning at me and I wanted to know, was it funny?
Was it so funny it followed me down the street
Greeting everybody like the good humor man
But an they got the taste of good humor but no ice cream
It was like dat
Me talking across people into the houses
And not seeing the beings crowding around me with ice picks
You could see them
But they looked like important Negroes on the way to your funeral
Looked like important jiggaboos on the way to your auction
And let them chant the number and use an ivory pointer to count your teeth
Remember Steppen Fetchit
Remember Steppen Fetchit how we laughed
An all your Sunday school images giving flesh and giggling
With the ice pick high off his head
Made ya laugh anyway

I can see something in the way of our selves
I can see something in the way of our selves
That's why I say the things I do, you know it
But its something else to you

Like that job
This morning when you got there and it was quiet
And the machines were yearning soft behind you
Yearning for that nigga to come and give up his life
Standin' there bein' dissed and broke and troubled

My mistake is I kept sayin' ""that was proof that God didn't exist""
And you told me, ""nah, it was proof that the devil do""
But still, its like I see something I hear things
I saw words in the white boy's lying rag

Said he was gonna die poor and frustrated
That them dreams walk which you 'cross town
S'gonna die from over work
There's garbage on the street that's tellin' you you ain't shit

And you almost believe it
Broke and mistaken all the time
You know some of the words but they ain't the right ones
Your cable back on but ain't nothin' you can see

But I see something in the way of things
Something to make us stumble
Something get us drunk from noise and addicted to sadness
I see something and feel something stalking us

Like and ugly thing floating at our back calling us names
You see it and hear it too
But you say it got a right to exist just like you and if God made it
But then we got to argue

And the light gon' come down around us
Even though we remember where the (light or mic??) is
Remember the Negro squinting at us through the cage
You seen what I see too?

The smile that ain't a smile but teeth flying against our necks
You see something too but can't call its name

Ain't it too bad why'all said
Ain't it too bad, such a nice boy always kind to his motha
Always say good morning to everybody on his way to work
But that last time before he got locked up and hurt, real bad

I seen him walkin' toward his house and he wasn't smiling
And he didn't even say hello
But I knew he'd seen something
Something in the way of things that it worked on him like it do in will

And he kept marching faster and faster away from us
And never even muttered a word
Then the next day he was gone
You want to know what

You want to know what I'm talkin' about
Sayin' ""I seen something in the way of things""
And how the boys face looked that day just before they took him away
The is? in that face and remember now, remember all them other faces

And all the many places you've seen him or the sister with his child
Wandering up the street
Remember what you seen in your own mirror and didn't for a second recognize
The face, your own face

Straining to get out from behind the glass
Open your mouth like you was gon' say somethin'
Close your eyes and remember what you saw and what it made you feel like
Now, don't you see something else

Something cold and ugly
Not invisible but blended with the shadow criss-crossing the old man
Squatting by the drug store at the corner
With is head resting uneasily on his folded arms
And the boy that smiled and the girl he went with

And in my eyes too
A waving craziness splitting them into the jet stream of a black bird
Wit his ass on fire
Or the solomNOTness of where we go to know we gonna be happy

I seen something
I SEEN something
And you seen it too
You seen it too
You just can't call it's name name name name name name name",Something in the Way of Things (In Town),2002
Jill Scott,"[Chorus: x2]
I've been wondering about the complexity
Of what we have it shouldn't be
More
Just can't see
More

You're physically in this, but how could we tell
If we was meant to be in bliss if you're not mentally as well?
This energy you're sending me is tricky as hell
Usually it's like a 50/50, we could take a L
Before we start things, at this point being apart brings
The feeling of somebody plucking at your heart strings
I know it probably shouldn't feel like this
But any other woman I see is in your likeness
It's from your cheekbones
Yo your lips, to your curves, to your deep moans
To that walk, to your words
You love feeling like a breakdown on the verge
First we on good terms, then you on my last nerves
Got my back just aching, my shoes is all tight
It's too complex when we choose to do it right
It's wrong, one minute you a soldier strong
Then you trying a route talking about it's over and gone

[Chorus]

When your boyfriend's in town, it's bound to be trouble, Love
His name Black, and he known to be a lover of
Getting it on with my smoker's jacket on
Eyes racing back and forth listening to Chaka Khan
Trying to figure the cause why you always acting off
like I'm slacking off
Maybe our signal's getting crossed
For the case Love, you feel like you making a waste of
Your precious time you need to get a taste of
Some space to breathe, a moment as friends
We should've felt ourselves slipping into it again
'Cause it's like off and on, on and off
Passion, lost and found, found and lost
Clashing, asking for nothing but understanding
Your hearts made of glass, use care when handling
Girl, all in all I never leave you stranded
'Cause my respect you commanded, you figure it out

[Chorus]

I used to come into the party and stand around
'Cause I was kinda too shy to really get down
I used to play the corner and watch the scene
Deep down knowing I wanted to find me a queen
And I could feel that in my stomach and up in my chest
Because I knew a lot of women, and some was fresh
But then I found you girl, and just like me
You had a heart that was yearning to be set free
Now listen, see you and me we need to take the time
To erase any doubt that's inside your mind
It's not a mountain that I'm ever too tired to climb
And who's counting, but I know at least a thousand times
I let you know I'm here for you, care for you, and confide in you
Break bread, share with you, and provide for you
And that's full time, it's no 9 to 5 with you
That's why I'm trying to work it out with you, it's gonna work

It's beyond me 
I can't control it or force it to be, you know, what I want it to be

Jill Scott,"His name was Rasool
Caramel completed boy from the 22
Rough on the outside
But on the inside he was cool

Rasool was a king
But also a fool
Back on the block again with the same crew
Tariq from the west side

Little John form the avenue
Always seen um bout a quarter to two
Shaking hands with everybody
But at the same time sharing the blues

And oh how he passed it on
Shaking hands till what was in his pockets was gone
He'd be outside in the cold with his bubble goose on
But inside

I knew he wasn't warm
Around 10:30 on that dreary night
His bowaz said they were hungry they were hungry
Wanted to get a bite

But they didn't send a runner
Rasool knew it wasn't right
But he stayed anyway to get the chain he liked
And oh how the shots rang in the streets

Hitting everybody in the surrounding vicinity
Children of the children
One young father to be
And Rasool lay dead in my north Philly Street

At fifteen years old
It was the first death I'd seen
But the game ain't designed for no kind of winning
And oh this is a friend of Rasool

Just recline

I fell asleep beneath the flowers
For a couple of hours
On a beautiful day
Daydream
I dream of you amid the flowers
For a couple of hours
Such a beautiful day

As I spy from behind my giant robot's eyes
I keep him happy 'cause I might fall out if he cries
Scared of heights so I might pass out if he flies
Keep him on autopilot 'cause I can't drive
Room enough for one I tell my homies they can't ride
Unless they sittin on the shoulders but that's way too high
Let's try not to step on the children
The news cameras filmin
This walkin project buildin
Now there's hoes sellin hoes like right around the toes
And the crackheads beg at about the lower leg
There's crooked police that's stationed at the knees
And they do drive-bys like up and down the thighs
And there's a car chase goin on at the waist
Keep a vest on my chest
I'm sittin in my room as I'm lookin out the face
Somethin to write about
I still got some damage from fightin the whitehouse, just a

We need a few more half naked women up in the pool
And hold this MAC-10 that's all covered in jewels
And can you please put your titties closer to the 22s?
And where's the champagne? We need champagne
Now look as hard as you can with this blunt in your hand
And now hold up your chain slow motion through the flames
Now cue the smoke machines and the simulated rain
But not too loud 'cause the baby's sleepin
I wonder if it knows what the world is keepin
Up both sleeves while he lay there dreamin
Me and my robot tip-toe 'round creepin
I had to turn my back on what got you paid
I couldn't see half the hood on me like Abu Ghraib
But I'd like to thank the streets that drove me crazy
And all the televisions out there that raised me, I was

As I spy from behind my giant robot's eyes
I keep 'em happy cause I might fall out if he cries
Scared of heights, so I might pass out if he flies
Keep 'em on autopilot cause I can't drive
Room enough for one, I tell my homies they can't ride
Unless they sittin' on the shoulders but that's way too high
Let's try, not to step on the children,
The news camera's filmin', this walkin', project building
Now there's hoes selling hoes, like right around the toes
And the crack heads beg, at about the lower leg
There's crooked police, that's stationed at the knees
And they do drive-bys like up and down the thighs
And there's car chase, going on at the waist
Keep a vest on my chest
I'm sitting in my room, as I'm looking out the face

Jill Scott,"[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby don't worry you know that you got me

Somebody told me that this planet was small
We use to live in the same building on the same floor
And never met before
Until I'm overseas on tour 
And peep this ethiopian queen from philly 
Taking classes abroad
She studying film and photo flash focus record
Said she workin on a flick and
Could my click do the score
She said she loved my show in paris
At Elysee Montmartre
And that I stepped off the stage
And took a piece of her heart
We knew from the start that
Things fall apart, intentions shatter
She like that shit don't matter 
When I get home get at her
Through letter, phone, whatever
Let's link, let's get together
Shit you think not, think the thought went home and forgot
Time passed, we back in philly now she up in my spa
Tellin me the things I'm tellin her is makin her hot
Startin buildin' with her constantly round the clock
Now she in my world like hip-hop 
And keep tellin me

[Chorus:]

Yo, I'm the type that's always catchin' a flight
And sometimes I gotta be out at the height of the night
And that's when she flip and get on some 'ol

Another lonely night
Seems like I'm on the side you only loving your mic
I know you gotta get that paper daddy keep that shit tight
But yo I need some sort of love in my life, you dig me
While politicin with my sister from New York City
She said she know this ball player and he think I'm pretty
Psych, I'm playin boo, you know it's just wit you I'm stayin boo 
And when cats be poppin' game I don't hear what they sayin boo
When you out there in the world, I'm still your girl
With all my classes I don't have the time for life's thrills
So when you sweatin' on stage think of me when you rhyme
And don't be listenin' to your homies they be leavin you blind

Yeah, so what you sayin' I can trust you?
Is you crazy, you my king for real
But sometimes relationships get ill
No doubt

[Chorus:]

The snake could be that chick 
And that rat could be that cool cat
That's whispering ""she tryin' to play you for the fool Black""
If something's on your chest then let it be known
See I'm not your every five minutes all on the phone
And on the topic of trust, it's just a matter of fact
That people bite back and fracture what's intact
And they'll forever be I ain't on some ""oh I'm a celebrity""
I deal with the real so if it's artificial let it be
I've seen people caught in love like whirlwinds
Listening to they squads and listening to girlfriends
That's exactly the point where they whole world ends
Lies come in, that's where that drama begins, she like

Jill Scott,"I set the fire ablaze
Lit it from far away
Found it out yesterday
Called it a big mistake
A wake up call for me
Figured it would be
That the story of this man
Never was a plan
Incompatible worlds we can't control
But that's the way it's always been
Circumstantial human beings
By the way I'll be ok
So why aren't you the first to say
Today I'm born again
Call it a big mistake
To see it fade away
But the problem's not with me
So now I'm twenty two
Feeling kind of blue
Because the same thing's happening
Instead it's now my friends
The choices we all make
Could prove life long mistakes
But I don't want to see your life fall right on through your hands
By the way I'll be ok
So why aren't you the first to say
I wish this never happened
I wonder what my life would be like now
If things just kind of went my way
Today you're born again
So now you're twenty-one
With no worries
Now you're twenty-one
With no worries

The little rain drops fallin' down on me
But I can't seem to feel it, feel it
Feel it coming over me

The rain gon' come through the window; pain will come
Black, white, rich, poor; it's the same old drum
Rainy days like the war, use wisdom as a weapon
Hold your head up, dry your clothes and keep steppin'
Let the children feel the rain, 'cause if they feel the rain
From the wetness, they stand to gain
I came into the game; it felt like the middle of June
Music was warm; artists, like flowers: they bloom
Then boom; I shook the room, many felt the thunder
My time to shine; did it like summer
I wondered if the sun would shine forever
Pops said, 'rain gon' come.' to him I said, 'never'
Cheddar in the genes, face on screens
Got a benz wit' the sheen, but what did it all mean?
I earned money and burned money, credit cards smokin'
Platinum, Grammys, famous, but still broke and
Not having cash put me in check
Yo, the road to the riches is slippery when wet
Amongst the fall is where you truly find yourself
Ever since then, the rain I never felt
Deal wit' it

[Chorus]

At age seventeen, the worst pain: a hurricane
Her first name still conjures the rain
Vowed to never let nobody ever get me wet
Lest we forget, love is a four season concept
Many say the rain they can't stand
Never let the weather determine the man
God has a plan; from it I never ran
Follow my heart through the storm, my umbrella in hand
I'm Noah, life's my arc
Forty days and forty nights; still can't take my heart
Seen the fallen man
To dope and liquor brands
The devil'll dance to make it rain
Bringing the pain
Walk through the puddles of struggle on flooded streets
Soakin' wet, but mastered the art of peace
Through grey skies I grew wise, on bended knees I knelt
Since then, the rain I never felt 
What's wit' it?

[Chorus]

Sometimes I sit in my room, stuff on my mind
Stress, can't rest, so I open the blinds
See kids in the streets, runnin' around
It wasn't touchin' 'em, but the rain was comin' down
I wondered how, with my mouth wide
Reminisce of the key, said I want to go outside
In the rain, to see if the same would happen to me
'Bout that time God started rappin' to me
He said, 'pain is the mother of change, the rain must flow 
So the seeds of joy might grow
Don't be afraid, find shelter in me
The road to greatness through the valley of adversity.'
I felt the light as He proceeded to drop the gem
These little children; the world we must receive like them
I just smiled, and thanked Him for the cards He dealt
And since then, the rain I never felt
What's wit' it?

On a silver platter
Would even matter? You'd still be mad at me

Jill Scott,"You're going to? 
That your skies are finite and limited? 
That your growth is an impossible dream, that your future is inhibited. 
Oh please! They have been shoveling them lies since the 50s, 
Can't nobody decide what your life can move through! This is YOUR time and your challenge. What is it that you want to do? Sit and be still and not shine the way your life was meant to?
Oh, I pray that ain't true! I pray that ain't true!
Oh please, don't fall in the abyss because something negative once ruled you. 
Please! Understand I'm from where you are and I've got to fight my demons too. 
Please! Don't give up because somebody broke your heart or some things fell through.
This is life. You owe it. Life does not owe you.

An obstacle is a thing that impedes or blocks one's way. 
You can climb over, you can dig under you can chip through it, 
You can go around it, you can move it. You can ignore it!

You never find what you seek

You destroy the earth, make possibilities bleak
Your lies are your destruction
Your justice stinks
Your pride is maniacal
You are the bearer of grief
Your win is shallow
Your truth is oblique
Your patriotism is garbage
It rots and it reeks of death in the wind
The foul stench of men basking in their cruelty
Rejoicing in their sin
You give up and give over so easily to the darker side
Because of your pride
You risk all of humanity
You send my children to murder human beings
Families they do not yet know
People they have never seen
You send my children to war
Without exasperating dialogue to get to the meat
An equal understanding, as if there isn't even a possibility for peace
But there is always a possibility for peace
As un-perfect as we are, we should in all ways reach deep
Deep down in our beings

Everything I went through would be beautiful
When I wake up
And I will wake up
It's gonna be beautiful

Down to to my left side (Last cry)
Feeling I could fly (Feeling I could fly)
All day, up high.
Sweeter than the sugar on a cinnamon treat
Or an ice cream
That was me

But I'm feeling like I'm in a nightmare
Fear of loving somebody, everywhere
Oh Lord, I need this confirmation, this affirmation
That when I wake up
When I wake up
Everything I went through will be beautiful
When I wake up
Everything I went through will be beautiful
Gotta wake up

Jill Scott,"Clearly I am not a fat ass
I am active brain
And lip smacking peach deep
Sometimes too aggressive in its honesty
And heart sweet
That loves wholly and completely
Whom it may choose
Whom ever it may choose

I am not gonna lie and pacify
I am arms to hold
I am lips to speak
I am a muthafucking ""G""

Or out of a money green Phantom comfortably
Knees that bend to pray
Clean from Ajax washings
Hair that is thick and soft
Thigh that be-twixt
An amazing all expense grand prize

I am eyes that sing
Smile that brightens
Touch that rings
And supply euphoric release
I am a Grand Dame Queen Beast

I am war
I am peace
From the roads of Botswana to 23rd Street
From the inside third eye
Ever watching this wicked wicked system of things
I do see

I am friend to pen
And a lover of strong women
A diamond to men
I am curious and interested like children
I welcome the wise to teach
Appreciator of my culture
Thick not just from bone dense and eat

I have a rhythm in my ways
And a practice in my seek
And yes I do crave the rhythm of my space
With a man that rejoices in God's grace

With faith I do hear to listen
Two hands that fist
When forced pushes to shove
And your ego won't submit

I am all of this

About twelve years old, in a grown up world
She liked fancy cars, fancy rings
She wanted the life that only money could bring
I could tell that she, by the look in her eyes
Would do anything, to get that life
Didn't talk down to her, didn't make her cry

I was sittin' here trippin', 'bout half of the night
'Cause the song that I was working on was bringing me strife
Don't wanna give up, 'cause it's just that nice

Let me stop tryna force the issue
I been getting all the right lines
But I ain't been paying attention
Must be trippin' off of what them 
Records executives mention
Want me to be what they want me to be
But that ain't really my vision

I'm scorching hot like fire
So let me stop all this trippin'
Forgin' to my own funky fantastic dimension
Let me do what a sister like me do
And put some funk in the kitchen
Let me stop all this trippin' and listen

Our dance to a new moon's tune

Make beautiful love

Couldn't be more perfect if we planned it
Hand in hand we walk, so romantic

Aw baby, there's no place I'd rather be
Than your chocolate covered coated honey d
And baby, making love, just ain't making love to me, no

Wouldn't change a thing, this is magic

Now you're looking at me with faces
'Cause I went two different places
You're thinking it's a new beginning

We ended our time for a reason
Our trouble was never pleasing
Each other we got the right seeds done
That ain't enough to plant our dreams in
Oh I want some sugar in my bowl
A deeper connection baby
Don't you want more?
I think it's time that we move forward
I've hurted like a kid turned on you wrong
This is the last time I hope you enjoyed
Now would you mind leaving out the back door?

Don't be expecting no breakfast baby
You got all you gon' get
This is it, this is closure
This is closure, this is closure, this is closure, told ya

Look homie
There will be no more homemade waffles, okay?
With the fresh strawberries, you know the ones I put the agave in
There will be no more quiche and no more sausages
And don't even think about my pepper jack grits
Or my grandma's buttermilk biscuits (told ya)

Hungry?
You want something to eat?
You want some of my time? You want some of affection?

Gave you my heart and then you ran away
Either I'm stupid, I'm foolish, or you're playing me
But it seems, we were never really meant to be

So I thought I would try something new
I wanted to find out if I could live happy without you
And it turned out I wasn't living at all
I'd rather never known if you had just played along

I was living the dream believing things that just ain't true
Oh I can't believe I ever believed in you
You had me chasing fool's gold
I was chasing fool's gold

So I did die inside knowing you weren't right

On my way I realized
I didn’t have a gift for you
So I racked my mind on what it is now
That I am supposed to do
Then it hit me I kissed the love in the air
Hugged rain before it falls down
Put infinity into a melody
And see how it sounds

Sounds like
Jahraymecofasola
Sounds like jahraymecofasola

Oh almost there now, oh
Just a million miles to go oh
And still I can contain
How you make me glow, oh you make me glow

Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

She is cold I agree

I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me

I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

And you find it hard to live in your guise
Time has not been very kind
You can't hide it anymore
Hide it anymore

Its comfort must lie somewhat thin
Hopeful lovers linger only so long
While you hide what lies within

Do you still like being a mystery

From an idol above understanding
To a loner who's tragically real

Go back to school
But maybe I'm just in a bad mood

We sell to the rich on Madison Avenue
I come in late from Brooklyn on the F train
Karen says ""honey, make this your last time""
But we like her, she's firm but approachable
Dresses in style, pretty conservative
We ask her, ""hey, come out with us after work""
Karen she always declines

And we talk about
Karen by night
We imagine she must lead a very dull life
With just a cat and a book by her side
We know her by day but we don't know

In the stockroom searching for a 9B
I overheard Karen whisper on the phone
She said, ""Meet me at the club
There's a shipment coming in
And I can't pull this one off alone""
Well, I didn't know what to think
Was my mind playing tricks?
Was there more to this Karen then realized?
I had to know so I followed her home
I could not believe my eyes

Karen by night
The leather comes out under the moonlight
Takes off her Chanel and hops on her bike
Looking like young Marlon Brando
Karen by night

Saw her leaning on the bar with a drink in hand
And a cigarette dangling from her bright red lips
She looked like she was looking for someone
Like she was looking for a fight
Then a young blonde buck walked in
She grabbed him by the collar
Kissed him hard on the mouth
And slapped him on the cheek
Then I thought she spied me in the corner of her eye
So I ran outside, but all night all I could think about was

And very young girls

I know everyone's a good person inside
Everyone wants just to be loved inside
So whenever I think what a dick, what a liar,
I try to remember the good things inside

Well, your smile is as wide as Montana
And your eyes as deep as the Caspian Sea
Well, I guess these don't count as the things from inside
But these are the things that made me blind
These are the things that made me blind

What was I thinking? I wasn't thinking at all
If I knew what I did today, would I make the same mistake?
Probably.

'cause your hands are as big as Montana
And your lips as sweet as red vines
Well I guess these don't count as the things from inside
But these are the things that made me blind

You're as sharp as a tack, you're as loyal as a cat

You made me weak at the knees, gave me no disease

Jill Sobule,"Mom got drunk and Dad got drunk at our Christmas party
We were drinking champagne punch and homemade eggnog
Little sister brought her new boyfriend
He was a Mexican
We didn't know what to think of him until he sang
Feliz Navidad, Feliz Navidad

Brother Ken brought his kids with him
The three from his first wife Lynn
And the two identical twins from his second wife Mary Neil
Of course he brought his new wife Kay

Turn the ball game on

Fred and Rita drove from Harlingen
I can't remember how I'm kin to them
But when they tried to plug their motor home in
They blew our Christmas lights
Cousin David knew just what went wrong
So we all waited out on our front lawn
He threw a breaker and the lights came on
And we sang Silent Night, Silent Night, Oh Silent Night

A slit in the blinds
A hole in the fence

Whatever that might be
They go on about their business
Too wrapped up to see
In the shadows,
My unblinking eye,
I love the secretive life

I hide in the park
Behind the bushes
I see runners and skaters
And a half naked man
Showing off his tattoos

And I see old Mr. Gray
With his bad toupee
With some dumb girl about half his age

People doing (definitely not his wife) people things
Uncalling out to me
They're so funny I could almost cry
I love the Secretive Life

There's Johnny's dad
On his third martini
And his nose is getting bigger
As I watch through the kitchen window
They really oughta close those blinds

And under my coat
I got a micro-recorder,
A pad, and a pencil,
And a picture of you
I can't believe you did that

I see two love birds walking by
With that sick and dreamy
Look in their eye

And there's a big fat cop
With a Magnum mustache
Trying so hard to look mean

People doing
(Bet he doesn't see that man across the street)
People things
(Stealing a bicycle)

They may look in my direction
But they never see
In the shadows my unblinking eye

You're the guy who doesn't get it

Don't you know my life's a quiet hell?
I'm a black hole, I'm an empty shell
Does it occur to you I might need help?
You're the guy who doesn't get it

Say I'm in the tub with a razor blade
You'd walk in and ask me ""How was your day?""
Then you'd lather up and start to shave
As I bleed on the new tile floor

I'm sure that you really care for me
And your heart's as big as Germany
But you're as blind as they were back in '33
You're the guy who doesn't get it

Say the car exhaust engulfs my brain
The Nebutol is racing through my veins
You'd come in and ask ""Are you okay?""
As I close my eyes forever

Can't you tell that I am dying inside?
Can't you hear my muffled cry?
What's going on in those lost, vacant eyes?
You're the guy who doesn't get it",Guy Who Doesn't Get It,2000
Jill Sobule,"Why are all our heroes so imperfect
Why do they always bring me down
Why are all our heroes so imperfect
The statue in the park has lost his crown

William Faulkner drunk and depressed
Dorothy Parker mean, drunk and depressed
And that guy in Seven Years in Tibet turned out to be a nazi
The founding fathers all had slaves, the explorers slaughtered the braves,
The Old Testament God can be so petty

Paul McCartney jealous of John, even more so now that he's gone
Dylan was so mean to Donovan in that movie
Pablo Picasso cruel to his wives
My favorite poets took their own lives
Orson Welles peaked at 25, ballooned before our eyes
And he sold bad wine

Lewis Carroll I'm sure did Alice

Jill Sobule,"It used to be a motel
Now they serve biscuits and t-shirts
I bring my own tea bag
I don't trust the coffee
But the biscuits are delicious
They come eight to a plate with a big block of butter
and homemade peach preserves

And I wish you were here, my arrogant lover
I'd make you eat grits and the red-eyed gravy
I'd make you sit down with the southern ladies and
their blue pantsuits
I'd talk about Jesus
Talk about the weather
Watch you squirm as I told them we were married with two girls

I'd say you were in trucking
And I was a teacher
In a Christian school where the kids are good
And they don't do drugs and they save themselves
before they're married
I wouldn't tell them you had a wife
That wasn't me and we just had sex
And they wouldn't be impressed if I told them you knew Lou Reed

And the stars upon the walls look down at me like gods
There's Ernest Borgnine and Billy Ray Cyrus and my favorite Minnie Pearl

So I go for the coffee
It's not bad just a little weak
And I ask the waitress for another plate of the famous biscuits
She said you must have a bottomless pit
I said you don't know the half of it
Lately I've been so hungry

And the stars upon the wall look down at me like gods

Jill Sobule,"Lucy at the gym
She's there every time I go,
And I don't go that often, so she must live at the gym
I stare at her ribs they show through the spandex
Her little legs are working, she's going somewhere
She's climbing up the stairs
And when she reaches the top her dreams will be there

Lucy at the gym
Lucy on the scale for the third time
Through thick and thin, Lucy's at the gym
She's staring at the clock and like the 2nd hand she never stops
She's Lucy at the gym

When she takes a shower, after all the hours
Does she have a place to go
Is there someone waiting
Or is Lucy all alone

I'm at the gym and Lucy's not there
It's got me kinda worried so I imagine the worst
She's made it up to heaven
And when she met her maker, he said ""come right in""

Thinks no one understands

A fallen angel who visits your dreams
And in those dreams I'd blow you a message that says
You really want me

Sometimes I wish that I was a wrestler
A Mexican wrestler in a red vinyl mask
And I might grab you, body slam you, and maybe cause
Physical harm
But when we would land
I might take pity on you
I can crack all your ribs
But I can't break your heart

You will never love me
And this I can't forgive
That you will never love me
As long as I will live

Sometimes I wish that I was a beauty
A beautiful girl who was still 21
And I'd turn your head as well as your buddies
And I could afford to play hard to get
We'd go to parties and you'd show me off
And I'd go home with someone else

You will never love me
And this I can't forgive
And it will always bug me

One of these days when I fall in love,
it won't fall apart like it always does

Jill Sobule,"I have a friend, swear she saw Jesus
Hovering above her lonely bed
She said it changed her life forever
"" Whatever works"" I said
I sit with her changing channels
It's so hard to concentrate
I laugh at her, but I'm pretty sure
She's having a better day

So I will lay on the highway somewhere in New Mexico
And wait for a strange light to come and take me home
Or I will stand by the statue and wait for her to cry
To see real tears that seem sincere once before I die

The other night I talked to an old flame
Who finally said why he moved on
He said I didn't have faith in anything
I knew he wasn't wrong
I saw two lovers in the park
With that dreamy look of lust in their eyes
The whole world smiled as they passed by
They just make me mad

So I will lay on the highway somewhere in New Mexico
And wait for a strange light to come and take me home
Or I will stand by the statue and wait for her to cry
Take this jaded heart, blow it all apart, once before I die

I'll get down on my knees, something I don't believe
Somebody help me please, I'm starting to repeat myself

Jill Sobule,"When everyone wore loafers
I needed more support
I'd always hide when we take a drive
To that awful store
I had a choice of black or blue
The biggest ugliest ass shoes
But what could I do
My feet they came out funny

Mary McKay she had Mary Janes
With that patent leather shine
She was known as Tinker Bell
And I was Frankenstein

Big shoes before they were big
Big shoes I'll never forgive
My mother made me wear big shoes

In my school when Spring came
Sandals they were all the rage
With plastic beads on straps to match
Their painted nails
Heavy-footed in the hall
What I wanted most of all
Was red ball jets
So I could get over the schoolyard fence

Kip O'Neil she had high heels
She went all the way
By the time I got up to bat
They called off the game

Big shoes everyday
You can hear them coming a mile away
Outside you hear them say
Here comes Big Shoes

And when I could go to the real shoe store
On the shelves I looked in horror
On display were combat boots and platforms
Here comes Big Shoes

Big shoes before they were cool
Wanted feet so minuscule
I even wore them at the swimming pool

To show their respect and their sorrow
Here in Spain, so simple is our life

We get your TV shows

Beneath my feet

Taking me to places

Thick with strange perfume
Is this the middle of the night
Or the middle of the afternoon

Although we'll never keep it
We make it anyhow
Knowing it will vanish
