With all my heart an' soul, I care 
With every dream I dream, I love you

Perry Como,"Talk to her please Mister Sun, speak to her Mister Rainbow 
And take her under your branches, Mister Tree! 
Whisper to her, Mister Wind, sing to her Mister Robin 
And Mrs Moonlight put in a word for me! 

Tell her how I feel, it shouldn't end this way 
Since you all are her friends, she'll listen to whatever you have to say 
Babble to her Mister Brook, kiss her for me Miss Raindrops 
And watch to see they all do please Mister Sun!

Perry Como,"It was a lucky April shower 
It was the most convenient door 
I found a million dollar baby 
In a five an' ten cent store! 
 
The rain continued for an' hour 
I hung around for three or four 
Around a million dollar baby 
In a five an' ten cent store! 
 
She was sellin' china 
An' when she made those eyes 
I kept buyin' china 
Until the crowd got wise! 
 
Incidentally . . . 
If you should run into a shower 
Just step inside my cottage door 
An' meet the million dollar baby 
From a five an' ten cent store! 
 
She was sellin' china

Perry Como,"You went away, I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind

Still the magic if the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind
The sky was blue and high above
The moon was new and so was love

This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover, where can you be?
You came at last, love had its day
That day is past, you've gone away

This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover, come back to me
When I remember every little thing
You used to do, I'm so lonely

Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely
The sky is blue, the night is cold
The moon is new but love is old

And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover, come back to me
When I remember every little thing
You used to do, I grow lonely

Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely
The sky is blue, the night is cold
The moon is new but love is old

And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover, come back to me","Lover, Come Back to Me",2003
Perry Como,"Another bride, another June
Another sunny honeymoon
Another season, another reason
For makin' whoopee

It's really killin' that he's so willin'
To make whoopee

Picture a little love nest
Down where the roses cling
Picture the same sweet love nest
And think what a year can bring

Perry Como,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2003
Perry Como,"[Chorus]
Weave, weave, weave me the sunshine 
Outta the fallin' rain! 
Weave me the hope of a new tomorrow 
An' fill my cup again! 
 
Well, I've seen the steel an' the concrete crumble 
Shine on me again! 
The proud and the mighty all have stumbled 
Shine on me again! 
 
They say that the tree of lovin' 
Shine on me again! 
Grows on the bank of the river of sufferance 
Shine on me again!

If only I could heal your sorrow 
Shine on me again! 
I'd help you to find a new tomorrow

Perry Como,"If the hands of time
Were hands that I could hold,
I'd keep them warm and in my hands
They'd not turn cold.

Hand in hand we'd choose
The moments that should last.
The lovely moments that
Should have no future and no past.

The summer from the top of the swing,
The comfort in the sound of a lullaby,
The innocence of leaves in the spring,
But most of all the moment
When love first touched me!

Would never learn to fly,
Until the hands of time
Would choose to wave Goodbye.",The Hands Of Time,2004

It was mighty smoky over Tokyo
A friend of mine in a B-29 dropped another load for luck
As he flew away, he was heard to say
A hubba-hubba-hubba, yuk yuk

Well, I gotta go fishin'

Well you're lookin' mighty purdy Miss Curly Locks
I'm the grand old girly of the bobby socks

Hmm yuttata yuttata yuttaton, you talk big
Well, I'm the fresh tomato you can't dig
Let's have a heart to heart and you'll decide
I'm a chick what's really on the solid side

You knock me flat, you're the kind of a cat
Makes me wanta blow my top 'til the end of time

And if you feel that way, tell me what you say?
A hubba-hubba-hubba, muk muk
Well now you're really talkin', you're no square
You can't be from Weehawken, hmm hmm, Delaware

You got a line of jive that's really zoo
Well I'll dig you later, baby you're all root

You're the kind of cat, wears a sharp cravat
And you really know your stuff
If you feel that way, tell me what you say?

A getta long a little mousy with the great big eyes
But if you're lookin' for a spousey
Why you’re just my size

Mister how you love to blubber
With that knock out squawk
Seems your lips are made of rubber
Every time you talk

Oh no, no, no, hubba-hubba

'see' is for the Christ child, born upon this day
'H' for herald angels in the night
'are' means our Redeemer
'I' means Israel 
'S' is for the star that shone so bright 
'T' is for three wise men, they who travelled far 
'M' is for the manger where He lay

Perry Como,"'Twas the night before Christmas, 
When all through the house, 
Not a creature was stirring, 
Not even a mouse! 
 
The stockings all hung 
By the chimney with care, 
In hopes that St. Nicholas 
Soon would be there! 
 
The children were nestled 
All safe in their beds, 
While visions of sugarplums 
Danced in their heads! 
 
And Mom in her kerchief 
And I in my cap, 
Had just settled down 
For a long winter's nap! 
 
When out on the lawn 
There arose such a clatter, 
I sprang from my bed 
To see what was the matter! 
 
Away to the window 
I flew like a flash, 
Tore open the shutters 
And threw up the sash! 
 
The moon on the breast 
Of the new fallen snow, 
Gave the lustre of midday 
To object below! 
 
When what to my wandering eyes 
Should appear, 
But a miniature sleigh 
And eight tiny reindeer! 
 
With a little ol' driver 
So lively and quick, 
I knew in a moment 
It must be St. Nick! 
 
More rapid than eagles 
His courses they came, 
As he whistled and shouted 
And called them by name: 
 
""Now Dasher, 
Now Dancer, 
Now Prancer, 
Now Vixen, 
On Comet, 
On Cupid, 
On Doner 
An' Blitzen!"" 
 
To the top of the porch, 
To the top of the wall, 
Now dash-away, dash-away, 
Dash-away all! 
 
As dry leaves 
Before the wild hurricane fly, 
When they meet with an obstacle 
Mount to the sky. 
 
So, up to the housetop 
The courses they flew, 
With a sleigh full of toys 
And St. Nicholas too! 
 
And then in a twinkling 
I heard on the roof, 
The prancing and pawing 
Of each little hoof! 
 
As I drew in my head 
And was turning around, 
Down the chimney St. Nicholas 
Came with a bound! 
 
He was dressed all in fur 
From his head to his foot, 
And his clothes were all tarnished 
With ashes and soot! 
 
A bundle of toys 
He had flung on his back, 
And he looked like a peddler 
Just opening his pack! 
 
His eyes how they twinkled, 
His dimples how merry, 
His cheeks were like roses, 
His nose like a cherry! 
 
His drawl little mouth 
Was drawn up like a bow, 
And the beard of his chin 
Was a white as the snow! 
 
The stump of his pipe 
He held tight in his teeth, 
And the smoke it encircled his head 
Like a wreath! 
 
He had a broad face 
And a round little belly, 
That shook when he laughed 
Like a bowl full of jelly! 
 
He was chubby and plump, 
A right jolly old elf, 
I laughed when I saw him 
In spite of myself! 
 
A wink of his eye 
And a twist of his head, 
Soon gave me to know 
I had nothing to dread! 
 
He spoke not a word 
But went straight to his work, 
And filled all the stockings, 
Then turned with a jerk! 
 
An' laying a finger 
Along side his nose, 
An' giving a nod, 
Up the chimney he rose! 
 
He sprang to his sleigh, 
To his team gave a whistle, 
An' away they all flew 
Like the down of a thistle. 
 
But I heard him exclaim 
As he drove out of sight, 
""Happy Christmas to All, 
And to all a Goodnight!""",Twas the Night Before Christmas,2007

Is a fairytale, they say.
He was made of snow, 
But the children know 
How he came to life one day. 
 
There must have been some magic in 
That old silk they found,
For when they placed it on his head, 
He began to dance around! 
 
Oh, Frosty, the Snowman, 
Was alive as he could be;
And the children say 
He could laugh and play,
Just the same as you and me. 
 
Frosty, clumsy as he can be 
See him lopping along!
Off he goes on an icicle spree 
With a happy song! 
 
Frosty the Snowman, 
Knew the sun was hot that day,
So he said, ""Let`s run, and we`ll have some fun, 
Now, before I melt away."" 
 
Down to the village, 
With a broomstick in his hand,
Runnin` here and there, 
All around the square,
Sayin`, ""Catch me if you can."" 
 
He led them down the streets of town, 
Right to the traffic cop . . .
And only paused a moment, 
When he heard him holler, ""Stop!"" 
 
Hmm, Frosty the Snowman, 
Had to hurry on his way,
But he waved goodbye, sayin` ""Don`t you cry, 
I`ll be back again some day.""

And you were just another sheep
And when we finally fell apart
You were left holding the cart
Though you thought I'd said I'd push it

Great nectar of the gods, spews rock from Pinutabo, 
Mixed with a woman's sweat, makes the lava we know. 
Oh, baby, every time that we kiss, hot lava! 
And every time that we make love, that's lava, hot lava! 
It's lava so hot it makes me sweat, 
And lava so warm and red and wet! 
Burning through the forest, where red hot lava flow, 
Rolls down the island's body, and into the ocean below! 
When it meets the cool cool water, here's your main sludge of living rich 
Magma flowing into a subaqueous environment produces pillar lava 
Hydrostatic pressure of sea water tends to inhibit the vesicle size of the basalt! 
Oh, baby, every time that we kiss, hot lava! 
And every time that we make love, that's lava, hot lava! 
It's lava so hot it makes me sweat, 
And lava so warm and red and wet! 
And after the eruption, 
You lay dormant for a while.. 
Let's just hold each other and talk. 
For now, Pele sleeps..
Oh, baby, every time that we kiss, hot lava! 
And every time that we make love, that's lava, hot lava! 
It's lava so hot it makes me sweat, 
And lava so warm and red and wet!",Hot Lava,1998

And in this crowded room
There's only one I see
One who makes my fire burn
Her eyes reach out to me

When you're someone
Who meets someone?

Like the clouds
Meet the mountains
And they sing out snowy notes

Cherubs turn away their blushing faces
Leaving us aroused and bare
In your garden, everything is there

Sing out snowy notes!

I wish I could have seen the stone that went a rollin' away when they looked inside the door to where the grave clothes lay

Within the realms unseen

Deformed beyond recognition
Remains of bodies burned

Swallowed by depths of darkness

You've passed, now dwell in madness

Flames of eternity
Burn in immortality
Skin melts so horribly
Revealed surreality

Breathing blackened air

Open the book of life
To die a second death
Burn in the lake of fire
Next to the false prophet
Face the thrones of judgment
Decide who lives who dies
Glorify the priests of unholyness
Bring forth your lies
Die in your sin, weakling
End in sight by his might

No power over the sacred ones
Kings of a thousand years
Heavenly fires waste those
Who failed to see or hear

Hear and remember, the incantations I recite
Reveal the power, no longer known by man
Possess, before the ancients rule the earth once again

Beneath the seas and skies of the human mind
The abyss yawns wide before me
Uncertain what truth of lies I will find
Appear and share my wisdom, for I know thee

Descend into the foul places of death
I fear for my flesh, for I have seen my epitaph
The price I pay on this lonely journey
Is softened and I hope the gods will have mercy

From a time before a time a cold voice has spoken
From a land beyond the stars I evoke thee
In exchange for wisdom, what evil have I woken
What terrible faith shall consume me?

I've seen the future
I've seen the past
I've seen the sight of whom causeth horror
I've seen my place of rest

I've traveled on spheres, I've seen things
Beyond imagination
The things I have learned are the most pure revelation
Obliterated are the lines of my life
My blood cries out as I make my last sacrifice

I cannot see, I cannot move, 'cause sight is failing me
Knowing that the beasts of the spaces claim my blood
My blood turns black but frightened I cannot be

A threat of distant thunder,

Turned ev'ry head

I was to blame,

Still wanting more,

Do you play to win or are you just a bad loser?

The cars in slow formation
Not far away
A final destination

One mother's son
His father's distant gaze, regretting
Where they went wrong
He always found it too upsetting

Me and my friend
We lived our lives completely
From start to end
You and your friend, so sweetly

With strength and pride
In spite of everything, and swimming
Against the tide
To obstinately hope of winning

And at the end
Your funny uncle staring
At all your friends
With military bearing

And stopped to stand
To smile and speak of you directly
Goodbye, shake hands
Like you did everything correctly

To wipe away the tears
No more pain, no fear
No sorrow or dying
No waiting or crying
These former things have passed away
Another life begins today",Your Funny Uncle,1989

I wanna take shelter from the poison rain

Pet Shop Boys,"Floods of tears and doors slamming
Stamping feet across the landing
Because of your obligation
To stay home and fight
Sitting down to a composition
Test the limits of your inhibition
If the phone hasn't rung by midnight
It's over tonight

If someone tried, you'd realise
It's just a boy or a girl
It's not the end of the world

Piles of toast and broken promises
Among the books and pens and reading glasses
It seems there's no escape from the humdrum
It's over and done

If someone tried, you'd realise
It's just a boy or a girl
It's not the end of the world
If someone cried, you'd sympathise
It's just a boy or a girl
It's not the end of the world

At midnight in desperation
Imagine total teenage destruction

The Prophets all predicted extinction
The Virgin spoke in apparitions
And if it all came to pass now
You feel we'd all deserve it somehow

But if someone tried (you'd realise)
You'd realise (and sympathize)
It's just a boy or a girl

Pet Shop Boys,"So much confusion
When autumn comes around
What to do about October
How to smile behind a frown?
It's hard to settle down

It's so bemusing
Will they cancel the parade?
We marched each October
Now they say we were never even saved
We must be very brave

Shall I rewrite or revise
My October symphony?
Or as an indication
Change the dedication
From revolution to revelation?

So we're all drinking
As leaves fall to the ground
Because we've been thinking
How October's let us down
Then and now

Shall we remember
December instead?
Or worry about February?
Mourn our war-torn dead
Never seeing red?

Shall I rewrite or revise
My October symphony?
Or as an indication
Change the dedication
From revolution to revelation?

Are never quite at ease, and neither am I

Oh, we'll talk about it all some night

From the start I approved of you
Right from the moment you turned to face me

With a nervous laugh and a concentrated frown
I spoke too fast with watchful eyes
Of a recent past and some nostalgic surprise

Someone's dustbin lid playing havoc with the peace
There's nobody hiding behind a locked door
And no one's been lying, 'cause we don't lie any more

It's only the wind, how it takes you by surprise
Suddenly begins, then before you know it dies
My hands are not shaking, I don't touch a drop
You must be mistaken, I know when to stop

When life is karma, I have no doubt
No angry drama, a storm blows itself out

The trouble that it brings haunts us like a curse

Pet Shop Boys,"I came across a cache of old photos
And invitations to teenage parties
""Dress in white"" one said, with quotations
From someone's wife, a famous writer
In the nineteen-twenties
When you're young you find inspiration
In anyone who's ever gone
And opened up a closing door
She said: ""We were never feeling bored

'Cause we were never being boring
We had too much time to find for ourselves
And we were never being boring
We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends""
And we were never holding back or worried that
Time would come to an end""

When I went I left from the station
With a haversack and some trepidation
Someone said: ""If you're not careful
You'll have nothing left and nothing to care for
In the nineteen-seventies""
But I sat back and looking forward
My shoes were high and I had scored
I'd bolted through a closing door
I would never find myself feeling bored

'Cause we were never being boring
We had too much time to find for ourselves
And we were never being boring
We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends""
And we were never holding back or worried that
Time would come to an end
We were always hoping that, looking back
You could always rely on a friend

Now I sit with different faces
In rented rooms and foreign places
All the people I was kissing
Some are here and some are missing
In the nineteen-nineties
I never dreamt that I would get to be
The creature that I always meant to be
But I thought in spite of dreams
You'd be sitting somewhere here with me

'Cause we were never being boring
We had too much time to find for ourselves
And we were never being boring
We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends""
And we were never holding back or worried that
Time would come to an end
We were always hoping that, looking back
You could always rely on a friend

As slow as Pinter
Synchronise your watches
There's still time to kill
Up against it
Drinking this swill to sweeten the pill
Up against it
The more that it hurts 
The less that it works
Wrapped in nostalgia to queue for a show
Back to Trafalgar one kiss then I'll go
So deep in quicklime
The bones of an old crime
I knew a man who raked them over
He's still suffering

Buried so deep
It gives me the creeps

Phone up a friend, who's a party animal
Turn on the news and drink some tea 
Maybe if you're with me we'll do some shopping

Stick with the gang, if you want to belong

I was a lonely boy, no strength, no joy
In a world of my own at the back of the garden

Would I write a book? Or should I take to the stage?

Che Guevara and De'bussy to a disco beat

It's not a crime when you look the way you do
The way I like to picture you
When I get home, it's late at night
I pour a drink and watch the fight

Turn off the TV, look at a book
Pick up the phone, fix some food
Maybe I'll sit up all night and day
Waiting for the minute I hear you say

I could leave you, say goodbye

You'll never have a bored day
Cause you're a New York
City boy
Where Seventh Avenue
Meets Broadway

The street is amazing
The hoochies unreal
Check out all the hardware
At the latest deal
Hear a song
That's the bomb!
If you don't get the mix
It's gone eighty-six
You feel the deal is real
You're in New York City

New York City boy
You'll never have a bored day
Cause you're a New York
City boy
Where Seventh Avenue
Meets Broadway
New York City boy
This is your reward day
Cause you're a New York
City boy
Where Seventh Avenue
Meets Broadway

Then as the evening falls
You can return its calls

You feel the deal is real
You're a New York City boy
So young, so run

Too late to sleep, too soon to rise
You're short of breath, is it a heart attack?
Hot and feverish you face the fact

You're in love, and it feels like shame
Because she's gone and made a fool of you in public again
You're in love, and it feels like pain
Because you know there's too much truth in everything she claims

So ask yourself now, can you forgive her
If she wants you to?
Ask yourself, can you even deliver
What she demands of you?

You drift into the strangest dreams
Of youthful follies and changing teams
Admit you're wrong, oh, no, not yet
Then you wake up and remember that you can't forget

She's made you some kind of laughing stock
Because you dance to disco, and you don't like rock
She'd make fun of you, and even in bed
Said she was gonna go and get herself a real man instead

So ask yourself now, can you forgive her
If she begs you to?
Ask yourself, can you even deliver
What she demands of you?

Or do you want revenge?
But that's childish, so childish!

Behind the cricket pavilion and the bicycle shed
Trembling as your dreams came true
You looked right into those blue eyes and knew

You've forgotten all the promises of that first friend
It's bad enough, she knows how you feel
But she's not prepared to share you with the memory

Has one thing in common, too

Everywhere I'm going to

So pure in thought and word and deed
They didn't quite succeed

Turned over a new leaf, then tore right through it

She'll soon be in the dock, and in the papers once again
Vicki's got her story about the mirror and the cane

Stephen's in his dressing-gown now, breakfasting alone
Too sick to eat, he's on his feet and to the telephone

Now Stephen's in the dock for spending money that was earned
By Christine, and the prosecution says that money burned
A hole in Stephen's pocket, for expensive sins he yearned
It may be false, it may be true

Even Mandy's looking worried, Christine's pale and drawn

Last night he wrote these words to his friend:
""Sorry about the mess""
""I'm guilty 'til proved innocent in the public eye and press""

Through a velvet drape

Came as a shock
He finds himself
A laughing stock
His ageing fate

What he will write
Will recall the bite
Of his wit and legendary appetite

Of his sexual vocation

I walked into the room 
Imagine my surprise 
You were sitting close to him 
Staring in each other's eyes 

Each of you looked up 
But no one said a word 
I felt I should apologise 
For what I hadn't heard 

A silence filled the room 
Awkward as an elephant 
In the crowded court of your love 
I was now a supplicant 

And clumsy as I felt 
At stumbling on this theft 
To save further embarrassment 
I made my excuses and left 

So long ago 
I felt like such a fool 
For crying

Is when you feel inside 
You're dying

Oh-oh, I'm with Stupid

Call you every day 
Fly across the ocean 
Just to let you get your way

Where I'm coming from 
Why would I be with someone 
who's obviously so dumb? 
Love comes 
Love grows 
every time you rise to meet me 
take my hand to greet me 
Love comes 
Love grows 
and power can give a man 
much more than anybody knows

Before we ever met 
I thought like everybody did 
you were just a moron 
a billion-dollar kid 
You flew up all the way 
like a hawk chasing a dove 
I never thought that I would be 
a sacrifice in love 
It comes 
It grows 
and now we're tied together

Is stupid really stupid 
or a different kind of smart? 
Do we really have a relationship 
so special in your heart?

Pet Shop Boys,"We're the Pet Shop Boys
Suburbia's a slipstream
To a memory
Of a time when you were
Close to me
I pretend
I'm there again
I close my eyes and see you
Better than before
Then I feel you touch me
And it's 1984
I know what you will say
Before you start
In my heart

We're the Pet Shop Boys
We're the Pet Shop Boys

Every thought's a fashion
Or a crime
And every boy is just
A waste of time
But I pretend
It was different then
Maybe it's a habit
Maybe it's a sin
But I find out
When I try it on
It crawls beneath my skin
Once it gets inside me
It won't go
Now I know

We're the Pet Shop Boys
We're the Pet Shop Boys

Rent
Shopping
Being boring
It's alright
It's a sin
I'm not scared
In denial
I want a dog
I want a lover
Can you forgive her?
Do I have to?
What have I? What have I?
What have I done to deserve this?

How do we deal with the fallout 
Of the age we used to call space?

Living in peace and freedom from fear

Come closer, tonight I'm lonely
Come here with me

So much time has passed I'd still meet you anywhere
Water under bridge, evening after day
What is left of love? Here that didn't drift away

I can remember days of sun, we knew our lives had just begun
We could do anything, we're fearless when we're young
Under the moon, address unknown, I can remember nights in Rome
I thought that love would last a promise set in stone

I'd survive with only memories
If I could change the way I feel
But I want more than only memories
A human touch to make them real

Another day, another dream, over the bridge an empty scene
We'd spend the weekend lost in bed and float upstream
I don't know why we moved away, lost in the here and now we strayed
Into a New York zone, our promise was betrayed

I was there caught on Tenth Avenue
You elsewhere with Culver City blues
Then and there I knew that I'd lost you

To make up for all the big mistakes

You might need an extra rhyme

I’ve been hanging as a fairy trif raf 
Somewhere along the go hobrose 
I don’t think it’s gonna be much longer

Love is a bourgeois construct 
So I’ve given up on the bourgeoisie

You made me see reality

It’s a blame turn to fallacy

I’ll explore the outer limits of boredom 
Moaning periodically 
Drift a far time, lonely lay about 
That’s me 

When you walked out you did me a favor 
It’s absolutely clear to me 
That love is a bourgeois construct 
Just like they said at university 

I’ve been taking my time for a long time 
With all the shadow and forever its cost 
Calculating what you’ve lost 

Now I’m digging through my student paper bags 
Flicking through Karl Marx again 
Searching for the soul of England 
Drinking tea like Tony Benn

Telling me your bad news, am I blind?
Am I just a boy in your bed?

I'm just tryna see the poise in your step

Show me yours, I'll show you mine

We don't wanna fight
We're just gonna waste time
They got no clue 'bout what we're doing
So till then we ain't gonna lie
They call us foolish, but we fooled them
And maybe that's why, why, why
I can be your go-to guy

Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,2003

All the stones inside my head
Were carefully removed
By the doctor's perfumed scarlet hands
She delved in deep for your savage teeth
That sparkled diamonds fire blue
Eating me and thrilling you
The voices have now gone
I'm looking forward to living alone

Now it's time to say goodbye
I won't stay around to be hurt by careless words
So here's the jar of your hate
Returned complete, sincerely yours, fully restored

But peace perfect peace
Could belong to me I'd bottle it
For love's like the sea
They're hungry gods with careless hands
That wrap themselves around our lives
So hard to resist
They swallowed me, you swallowed me
I closed my eyes, I disappeared

Now it's time to say goodbye
I won't stay around to be hurt by careless words

No, I suppose it's colder when you're dead
Your violent gift, I bottled it
Now it's gone, I'm in bloom

Give me strength give me hope
Give me no-one new to hold
If I saw you lately what would I say?
Give me peace please walk away
You have nothing new to say
If I saw you falling how wide could I smile?",Now It's Time to Say Goodbye,2003
Pete Bartlett,"Hide him away from the backhand of angry
He'll sit quietly as the fizzyness flows around
Never seen wars before, never been to a party
He says ""they laugh like balloons, they dance like baboons
They're so different when it's dark""
Hiding away as the noise gets louder
Watching the people loose in the corridor
Too many questions
He can't stay long, this is not his world
""Why are their lips even redder than
The bad one in Snow White
Why do they shout so, are they in pain
I don't understand
Can't stay much longer, I must tame my fox
So this is what goes on when you grow old.""

Hiding away in memory now sits my Prince laughing
He had to go, we all have to go, there's too much I didn't ask
Like ""what happens when you know the answer
But they're so used to you being wrong?
And why this cover when caught inside
We're heavy hearted, too close to the knives
Our hearts are closing like hammer horror walls
Fingermarked skin, hurt to the bone

We'll draw ourselves a new world.""

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody

Precious time we have together
With a stone in my heart I looked up and she was gone.

And it makes me stronger, makes me wiser

Pete Christlieb,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree

And I like it, how about you?",How About You? [#][*],1978

I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud

I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty, and too much in love

I'm too misty, and too much in love",Misty,2008
Pete Delisser,"I can only give you love that lasts forever,
And the promise to be near each time you call,
And the only heart I own is yours and yours alone, that's all, that's all.
I can only give you country walks in springtime,
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.
If you're wond'ring what I'm asking in return, dear,
You'll be glad to know that my demands are small.
Say it's me that you'll adore for now and ever more, that's all, that's all.",That's All,2008

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1964

Moon in all your splendor know only my heart

Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
