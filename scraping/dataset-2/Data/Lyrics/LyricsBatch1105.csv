The Connells,"Pawns for a pauper's son 
Handouts for everyone 
Please release me with your smile 

Ashes to dust again 
Save that for mortal men 
Please release me with your smile 

And when I rise 
And when you fall 
That's the part 
That weighs me down 
The part that weighs me down 

You are your own worst fears 
Save them throughout the years 
Please deceive me 
With your smile 

Anxious to understand 
Who has the upper hand 
Please believe me 
If it takes awhile",Pawns,1987
The Connells,"So surprised, 
I fought windmills. 
So surprised, 
I saw angels. 
I know my place in this

So surprised, 
I had visions. 
So surprised, 
You were in them. 
I found my place in this world. 

It's you I swear, 
it's you I swear, 
I delight in your despair. 
(I'll wait for you) 
It's you I swear, 
it's you I swear, 
Giving me the right 
(I'll wait for you) 
It's you who lied, 
it's you who lied 
When you had to swallow pride 
(I'll wait for you) 
It's you I swear, 
it's you I swear

So surprised, 
Thoughts escaped me. 
So surprised, 
Words escaped me. 
I know my place in this",Scotty's Lament,1987
The Connells,"So wouldn't you like to try? 
You're so alive and unusual. 
I really don't think you'd mind. 
It's not too dear, 
It's not too difficult. 

Think of this for awhile. 
You might decide 
It's not for you at all. 
But if you should feel confined, 
Then take the step and 
You could leave it all.",Try,1987
The Connells,"You better open your eyes wide, it's all here
You been too long on the inside
Time to try some fine tuning, focus in if you can
You better open your eyes now

Better seen as they say, there's just no way
I'm falling for all of that
Just leave your things at the door and nothing more
But take what you can

The sun better open your eyes wide 'cause it's all clear
You been too long on the inside
Time to try some fine tuning, focus in if you can
You better open your eyes now

Better seen as they say, there's just no way
I'm falling for all of that
Just leave your things at the door and nothing more
But take what you can

There's one small problem I see, I disagree
Falling for all of that
Just leave your brain at the door and nothing more
But take what you can

Better seen as they say, there's just no way
I'm falling for all of that
There's just one problem I see, I disagree
Better before you're fine [unverified]

The Connells,"Is the sun out, 
Has the wind died, 
Or is this stillness here the calm between my ears? 
And I know now why they put me here. 

Things were clear once 
'Til the clouds came, 
Now I don't know when they'll fall
No, I couldn't say at all. 

And I know now why they've kept me here. 
I've been paralyzed by a choice that lies 
Well inside of me
Which world to hold me now 

And I believe I'm drifting
Hey, the mist surrounds me more and more 
Hey, wow. It swirls and it rains here. 
Hey wow. And I have known this all before. 

Hey wow. And nothing's very 
Are the stars out, 
Is the sun down, 
Or is the darkness here the calm between my ears? 

And I know now why they've left me here. 
I've been mesmerized by a voice that cries 
Well inside of me 
Too loud to hold it down. 

And I believe I'm drifting
Hey, the mist surrounds me more and more. 
Hey, wow. It swirls and it rains here. 
Hey wow. And I have known this all before. 

Hey wow. And nothing's very clear.",Hey Wow,1989
The Connells,"Inside my head I hurt a lot 
'Cause I'm thinking about me 
And what I did to you 

I can't imagine what I have lost 
I'm not bold enough to be 
Man enough for you 

There's no way to save 
The dream that's dead 
The water has passed beneath us 
On a bridge reaching down fro you. 

Would you have been a movie star 
Or would you have been like me 
Nothing but a fool 

I can cry and hide and pray a lot 
But there's nothing I can do 
To save the dream for me 

There's no way to save 
The dream that's dead 
The water has passed beneath us 
On a bridge reaching down fro you. 

Inside my head I hurt a lot

And what I did to you 

My home is just not big enough 
To start a life for three 
But I wish I could for you",Inside My Head,1989
The Connells,"Sing to me sweetly as I turn sour 
Lay me down, remembering 
That the wind and the rain 
Played a part in that dreadful hour 

And so as I pass, I too feel the power 
Laying here under the trees 
Where three days before 
I danced in a summer shower 

And she said",Lay Me Down,1989
The Connells,"There isn't room in the Inn 
The keeper wouldn't be my friend 
I could tell in his eye 
He'd never change his mind 

So, I'm left to walk in the cold 
The light of day is growing old 
But who's to blame 
Neither rain nor shine 

That's why this is the best of me 
Giving up... 
This is the rest of me 
And I've had quite enough 
This is the best of me 
Giving up... 
You've seen enough of me 
To know that it's tough 

That is me in a scene 
Father, he is tall ans so serene 
I said I'd believe 
I declare a proven sigh 

Then I'm alone facing the snow 
The rain falls hard and is blowing cold 
I said I'd believe 
When hell had frozen over 

That's why this is the best of me 
Giving up... 
This is the rest of me 
And I've had quite enough 
This is the best of me 
Giving up... 
You've seen enough of me 
To know that it's tough 

But who's to believe 
That what I've seen really isn't true

And boy you love to have a ball 
Must be great with all the ladies 
Watch it Sal, don't you fall. 

You can cry like a loser, like a clown 
But it doesn't seem to help at all 
Oh, you and I aren't used to what we've found 
Love like rain will fall. 

She left you but you still love her 
You thought she was the easy part 
She smelled a lie and the luck of the winner 
Left you standing in the dark 

You can cry like a loser, like a clown 
But it doesn't seem to help at all 
Oh, you and I aren't used to what we've found

For a day there's no alcohol

The Connells,"Oh, you never learned the 'Whens' and 'Wheres' and 'Whys'
And I still believe that you were dying to be everything
To everyone and for all time
Ah, the golden boy did you stop trying?

Did it turn out stale, or did it simply lose its wonder?
Could you hold it up from out and under?
Does the distance seem to dim-dumb-dim your memory?
Does the distance seem to fell the hunger?

So, you're left with your thoughts and where do you go
Out the window or an open door
And once you believed they could keep you awake
It's so deceiving

So, you talk to yourself and what do you know
You answer back with a, ""Don't say so""
And once you believed you had something to say
It's so deceiving

So, you never learned the way to hold a crowd
And it turns out now that you were dying to be everything
To everyone and for all time
Ah, the golden boy did you stop trying?

So you're left with your thoughts and where do you go
Out the window or an open door
And once you believed they could keep you awake
It's so deceiving

So you talk to yourself and what do you know
You answer back with a, ""Don't say so""
And once you believed you had something to say

The Connells,"All alone, you sit by the hour 
You're waiting for the sun to rise 
In the night you sit by the fire 
You're waiting for the will to fight 

But I won't see you there 
Ten pins down 
No I won't see you there 
Ten pins down 

And you know that lines get me down 
I'm waiting for the sun to rise 
In the night we'll sit for awhile

The Connells,"Well the steel in his strings 
Cuts into his fingers 
And the lines that are left 
He knows so well 

And the words that he screams 
Sift through the smoke and sweat 
While his wandering mind 
Tries to tell... 

To tell him he's uninspired 
In some weary, absent way 
To tell him he's simply tired... 

Then the sound rolls in 
And lifts him up and in to the place he should've been 
Then the sound rolls in, and lifts him up and in 

And when all has been drained 
He wrestles with the feeling 
Of an unfelt refrain that he knew too well 

And the words that he hears, 
Because they compliment 
Are the words that he fears, 
Because they tell... 

They tell him he's uninspired 
In some weary absent way 
They tell him he's simply hired here.

Try talking? 
First I'll try to hum 
It's just that my sum isn't adding up. 

Oh, let me state my case 
I do as I am told 
Keep within the keep, feed within the fold 
As I brush away the flies. It's so hard. 

Don't ask me, I don't seem to know. 
I'm a bit slow, yeah 
Try walking? 
I'll just take the bus 
It's not worth the fuss--well, is anything? 

Oh let me stat my case

Any day now, they'll have you down any way that they please,
Sayin' just about everything.
Any day now, 'cause I hear your voice, but it's not the same sound.
All the luck, just in time to see it all come and go,
There goes another one.
Everyday now, I fear the noise, it's not the same sound.
Take you by the hand and pull you around.
I hear your voice, and they watered you down.
As if anything were different in here.
All I know's I'd like to shake it off forever.

If I cat-walk this, I walk, I can fly this
Bitch and I'm fly, and it's tied to the side
That's the flag that I'm flyin', add to the fact
That it all coincides with these wheels that I'm ridin'

And got class 'til later so, open garage""
And I don't really know which way to go, I ain't tryna skate it though
And my bike's illegal, so they send for the law
But I don't care Joe (nah), I just keep on pedalin'
Ride past shorty light-skinned with no melanin
Shirt look like somebody stuffed two melons in
Had to stop, so I could preach like Reverend
I grip on the handbrake and say, ""Waddup?""
I skip on the handshakes, I'm straight, what else?
I got two pegs on the back
And you got two legs under your skirt, so hop, we head
To the Dope Pedal Headquarters (c'mon)
You would be there if you could
Chuck got the red wheels and the white mags, but it's all good
Got the gold hundred spokes like ""Boyz N the Hood""
Wit the lime green frame (uh), dollars on the bike
Seat, handlebar grips, is the same as my Nikes
In the mold, the gold I use for my spokes
And the frame, the same as I use for my chain, out!

When the tip of your finger hits the switch
So,
With a little bit of Gold (gold)

Fresh haircut clean shave with the razor
It's a sickness but god is my witness
Blessed with this gift since the day before Christmas
I'm tryin'
I am
Nice with the science on how to stay king of the jungle just like lions
I gotta stay humble and move just like a bumble bee

But I don't brush my shoulders off
So much in the past months 
They looked polished

I'm just being honest
I'm putting on a clinic
niggas dropping out of college
Just do it like we did it

If you tossin' out bird seeds
I'm in a lions den
With a steak they can't touch me

Sucka's they want to fight me

Because their girl friends 
Want a guy just like me

Did it, done it
Kick it and punt it

However you put it
I'm a 100 dollar bill
In the hay stack cousin

Want it
You can have as long as  
You stop the frontin'

I be tryin' to pay MC's to behave
But they don't co-operate with me

And lately
They been impatient
They don't like waiting
And that's why they hate on me

So damn
But their party is always lame
They never had a hand like kings of Ordain

So I'm sitting on the couch holding the remote
Flipping channels, I'm a rebel eating a bowl
Of them fruity pebble, fruity pebbles, fruity pebbles
How gangsta is that. not gangsta' at all?
Aw you judging me dog, please you shop at the mall
Me I shop at boutiques, limited quantity sneaks
Where do these quantities be maybe they all on my feet
But I don't get it tho, about year ago you said my gear is wack
Nigga now my gear is dope, I guess it goes full circle like a cheerio
Cause you rocking what I was rocking like a year ago!
You said my chain was lame then you go and get a rope
You clown jokesters pose for poser posters
Told you when I woke up hold it like holsters
And Stop! While fold the rest of my clothes up
Love the hypocrites hating until you make it
Wack swagga jackers but my styles ain't for the taking

[Chorus:]
(Nigga you still playing sega?) I'm cooler then that guy
(No red monkeys with the bapesters?) I'm cooler then that guy
(What you riding on that bike for?) I'm cooler then that guy
(does that belt say star wars?) I'm cooler then that guy
(Why your jeans ain't sagging?) I'm cooler then that guy
(You ain't smoking on the dro cause?) I'm cooler then that guy
(Where your stunna shades at dog?) I'm cooler then that guy
(Man ya'll niggas ain't got no?) I'm cooler then those guys

[Verse 2:]
I'm in the crib Saturday night with my Sega thats right
Playing a game of that street fighter, street fighter, street fighter
I guess that makes you think you cooler then me
But any girl you can pull I can pull em with ease
Like the letter after D not X to Z, It's easy to me yes yes indeed
It's hard to believe but swallow it
So much game I that I could put it in a bottle and sell it too lames
And getting graphics in ya fade was fresh in the day
But it was jacked by the losers I'm bout too say screw it and
Grow a jerry curl wear a diaper like cupid or something else stupid
And see if people do it and if they do it then that proves it
People are just losers and they'll anything if someone cool do it
But they won't do it first so I guess they not cool
And it's the end of the verse so I'm chucking that deuce

I'm on the phone with a bone of another kind
So hold on we could roll to the other side
Side of my dome is the zone you could never find
Quick hands? you might need assistance
Try to find where you are inside of my head
Stay in line single file if you can
Then, we can kick it like kickstands and,
You know I peddle to the chainslip
So fly propellers propel us to the angels
Re-pellin the fellas that's jealous of the name
It's Repellin to rappers as soon as I stage hit

Then instantly the dames start flockin'
And if you'll show me to the stage
I rock.
Yea
Yes that song request, all I need is a mic and English
Drop the beat all right I proceed to spit
Me and the beat start fightin' with the snares and kicks
Now it's a riot on the track
Reason why is cause I'm fire and I'm hired to do that
And I'm fire cause I'm liver then the wire that was tired
Bought back from the dead
Let it rest on ya head.

Take a trip to the grocery store cause the bread is low and

The chicken I was eatin' with the mash potatoes need 
(a little bit of gold) 
Opps wrong song lyric man a little bit of pepper stepped
Out the crib with the bear claw slippers robe tied tight chest
No chest hair store close at four 
So I gotta get there cause it's like 3:50 and

I'm just wakin' up and it take five minutes just to get to the front now
I'm standin' in long lines lady with the baby probably buyin' some

I can't hold it cause it's hot put it down then. I left ma kids at

Tryin' spend all I got 5 dollars so u broke man I thought I had
10 dollars so you broke then t.v dinner on the counter warm
It up then, warm it up man, warm it up then

Come get some you little bums I got a lot and you can't get None 
That ice cream truck just left if you run you can catch
But it's out cause I got the last one 
But I got a box of combs that I'm willin' to sell 
I'll sell the ice cream too, two scoops for a bill 

I could build a sand castle without bringin' a pale 
And go cat fish fishin' and come up with a whale 
But but you know what that was easy as hell 
Well maybe not the line about me catchin' a whale 

But if I did it then it's nothin' then I did it as well 
Probably easy as it is to move slow for a snail 
Did you know I made this beat with my mouth and a bell

The Cool Kids,"How dare you say that my behavior is unacceptable
So condescending unnecessarily critical
I have the tendency of getting very physical
So watch your step 'cause if I do you'll need a miracle

You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here
The double vision I was seeing is finally clear
You want to stay but you know very well I want you gone
Not fit to fuckin' tread the ground I'm walking on

When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
You should know better you never listened to a word I said
Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat
Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did

When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

Does it kill
Does it burn
Is it painful to learn
That it's me that has all the control

Does it thrill
Does it sting
When you feel what I bring
And you wish that you had me to hold

When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams

Full of faces
Some laugh some salivate
Whats in your alleyway
Recycling bins or bullet cases

Its not equal
Its not fair
Were different people
But were not scared
We ain't never scared
To pave a new path
Make a new street
Build a new bridge

Say can you see by the dawns early light
Free slaves running
Songs words weren't right
Now a new days coming
The few stay stunning while the many are handsome
Your soul is alive but they want it for ransom
The base drumming is the anthem
We step to the heartbeats of our granddaughters and grandsons
And

Rise together
We rise together

Lost hope and found need
Grounded by our surroundings
Did the walls scream universities
Or you and I verse the tees
React automatic and we burst when squeezed
And make 9-11 each emergency
Urgency amber to red like the turning leaves
Oh please let the hurting cease
Don't let apathy police the populace
We will march across
Those stereotypes that were marked for us
The answers obvious
We switch the consonants
Change the sword to words and lift continents

Rise together
We rise together

And it's boomin' scooters, ATVs
Out in the white parasail, jet skis
Watching sexy little spicy mamacitas I see ya
Cash bar only, no need for the Visas
A lot of girls walk around here in bikinis
Ay, yeah we do this all day
Hot tub on the boat, rolling joints by the lake
Ay, tell her bring the papers
Twist up the Grape Ape
Down there, from here put your hands in the air
Yeah it's our year great view up here?
And it's looking like I might wanna move around here

Showboating, now I'm all in the mix
Only toasting purp weed. Degrees in the high 80's

Said I seen you on Collins, The car you was driving
The lights turned on like eyelids
Then the light turned green
And a scene from Ice Cream Man popped up into my head
When P had the white Lexus, Silkk had the headband
You and your man's looked like them
Right then my right hand reached my cell phone
And I needed her right name to type in
First name, Mike man, write on the white sand

Surround you with my long limbs
My dear, let me grow in the shade
In the sands by the bank of your river
Let I drink from your streams
The cool breeze fill my leaves

Water over the pebbles
And I'll be by your side forever

I wish I was a weeping willow tree
I wish I was a weeping willow tree

I wish I was a weeping willow tree
Sweet river caress how softly
Stir my searching roots
Shading the sun in the summers heat
Let I cool you
We have been dancing so long
In the winters freeze and the summers drought
We survive
We belong

Water over the pebbles
And I'll be by your side forever

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Looking for a cripple and a thief
A black man and a woman and a lonesome guy like me
Just trying to raise the stakes so we can be free
The dustballs were blowing the sun it cracked the ground
Where could a crime like this ever be found
Good people of the town said to sheriff John Brown
Go and shoot those invalids right down 

I said Sheriff 
No don't you be cruel 
It could happen to you now 

What exactly have they done said sheriff John Brown
For me to shoot those poor old bastards down
Then outstepped the preacher with his hand upon his heart
Can't you see that I've been chosen by god
And I tell you this for nothing
That crowd ain't no good
They're standing out just like a sore thumb
But yes I do agree said the lawyer on the left
I'd kill them now if it were up to me 

But I said sheriff 
Don't be cruel 
It could happen to you now 

Out into the wilderness the sheriff he did ride
Heading for the river bridge the laws you must abide
Two hours became three, I knew he would come for me
The day grew long and I began to tire
John Brown's face appeared from behind the fire
Boys and girls whatcho doing gonna be so free
The people of the town talk dissapprovingly
Don't want to take you in, that's not up to me 

But I said sheriff 
Don't be cruel 
It could happen to you now 

But guilt and doubt they cloud his mind
He thought what exactly is the law
He didn't even know what it stood for
And who pays the cost for all that is lost
Seems to me an impossibility
And who says what's right and who says what's wrong
Who benefits it sure ain't me
And outstepped the woman saying we mean you no harm
Come closer and I will read your palm 

But I said sheriff 
Don't be cruel 
It could happen to you now 

That night he left a long road came back without a rest
Knowingly he questionned ??? lawyer on the left
Bet you've gone and set them sinners free
Well yes replied the sheriff they done nothing wrong
My god why can't you people see
And the preacher shot him down and his head it hit the ground
The last you'll ever see of poor John Brown 

And the moral of this tale it is simple it is plain
People always need someone to blame

With his routine glass of gin

And waits in for the meter man

I don't need no second look

Sleep beneath the sun
With daffodils and dragonflies

Though it's hurting me, now it's history.
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too,
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.
The winner takes it all,
The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.
 
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there,
I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,
But I was a fool, playing by the rules.
The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice, 
And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
The judges will decide the likes of me abide,
Spectators of the show always staying low.
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend,
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.

Wondering why my mind plays tricks
And fools me into thinking you are there

The Corrs,"Wondering, waiting for the day to fade away
So I can hold you once again and chase the fears away

Lie with me
Show me how you feel
I'm falling for you deeper everyday

When the night turns over
I'll lie with you
When the morning wakes you
I'm there by you
When the daylight takes you
I'll miss you
Til you come back home to me
And I can make you mine oh mine

Wanting you
Every waking moment I'm on fire (I'm on fire)
Always needing you
I'm aching for you only I'll never tire

Promise me
This is how we'll be
I'm falling deeper everyday

When the night turns over I'll lie with you
When the morning wakes you
I'm there by you
When the daylight takes you
I'll miss you til you come back home to me
When you come back home to me

I'll break you
I'll chase you
You'll find that you can't stand to be away
Not for a day (not for a day...)
Oh and when life defies you
I'll be the soul
You'll never go astray...
And you'll be mine, mine, mine, mine, mine...

(Fly with me, loose reality)
I'm falling deeper everyday
So when the night turns over
I'll lie with you
And when the morning wakes you
I'm there for you
When the daylight takes you
I'll miss you
Til you come back home to me
And I can make you mine
When the night turns over
I'll lie with you
When the morning wakes you

I wish that day would soon come
When he and I can be as one

For satisfied I never sleep

Oh Bríd O'Malley
You have left my heart breaking 
You've sent the death pangs
Of sorrow to pierce my heart sore
A hundred men are craving
For your breathtaking beauty
You're the fairest of maidens
In Oriel for sure
 
No spectacle is fairer
Than moonbeams on the harbour
Or the sweet scented blossoms
Of the sloe on the thorn
But my love shines much brighter
In looks and in stature
That honey-lipped beauty
Who never said wrong
 
I'm a handsome young fellow
Who is thinking of wedlock
But my life will be shortened
If I don't get my dear
My love and my darling
Prepare now to meet me
On next sunday evening
On the road to Drum Slieve
 
'Tis sadly and lonely
I pass the time on Sunday
My head bowed in sorrow
My sights heavy with woe
As I gaze upon the byways
That my true love walks over
Now she's wed to another
And left me forlorn",Brid Og Ni Mhaille,2005

Translation
I'm a boy from Ireland and I could charm a nice young girl
I would not ask for her wealth as I am rich enough myself
I own a good part of Cork, two sides of the glen in Tyrone
And not to repeat mysel I'm the heir of County Mayo
 
I will go tomorrow to make ale in the wood
Without a cot without a boat without a pinch of gruel with me 
But leaves of the branches as bedclothes over my head
And think well done for you as you watch me from over there
 
A cowherd, my pet, I've never been accustomed to be
Instead of playing and drinking with the nice young women
on the mountain side
If I lost my riches I probarbly didn't loose my senses
And your kiss is no more to me now than a shoe worn for a year",Buachaill on Eirne,2005

You know just where I keep my better side

What days have come to keep us far apart
A broken promise or a broken heart
Now all the bonnie birds have wheeled away
And I need you at the dimming of the day

Come the night you're only what I want
Come the night you could be my confidant

I see you on the street in company

That lie near the Moorlough Shore
Your vines that blow by Borden's grove
Will I ever see you more
 
Where the primrose glows
And the violet grows
Where the trout and salmon play
With my line and hook delight i took
To spend my youthful days
Last night I went to see my love
And to hear what she might say
 
To see if she'd take pity on me
Lest I might go away
She said, ""I loved an Irish lad,
And he was my only joy,
and ever since I saw his face
I have loved that soldier boy""
 
Perhaps your soldier lad is lost
Sailing over the sea of Maine
Or perhaps he's gone with some other one

When twilight gleam is in her eyes

No life have I, no liberty
With love is lord of all

And sometimes when the beetles horn
Hath lulled the eve to sleep
I steal unto her shieling low
And through her dooreen peep
There on the cricket's singing stone
She stirs the bog wood fire

And hums in soft sweet undertones
The song of heart's desire

Her welcome like her love for me
Is from her heart within
Her warm kiss is felicity
That knows no taint of sin",My Lagan Love,2005

My heart lies smothered in my breast
But it's not for you to
let the world know it

It was my fancy

For when I'm drinking
I'm always thinking

I wish I was in

Where womankind cannot be found
Where little birds sing
upon the branches
And every moment
has a different sound

The Corrs,"Last night as I lay dreaming
Of pleasant days gone by
My mind being bent on rambling 
To Ireland I did fly
I stepped on board a vision 
And followed with the wind
Till next I came to anchor at the cross near Spancill Hill

It was on the 23rd June
The day before the fair
When Ireland's sons and daughters
And friends assembled there

The young ,the old, the brave, the bold came their duty to fill
At the parish church at Cluney
Just a mile from Spancill Hill

I went to see my neighbours
To hear what they might say
The old ones were all dead and gone
The young one's turning grey
I met the tailor Quigley
He's bold as ever still
Sure he used to mend my britches
When I lived at Spancill Hill

I paid a flying visit
To my first and only love
She's fair as any lily
And gentle as a dove
She threw her arms around me saying ""Johnny I love you still”
She was Meg the farmers daughter
And the pride of Spancill Hill
She was Meg the farmers daughter
And the pride of Spancill Hill",Spancill Hill,2005

About their daughter's disappearance

It only took my little fingers to blow you away

The Costello Show,"Outside in New Orleans the heat was almost frightening
But my hotel room as usual was freezing and unkind
On TV they prosecute anyone who's exciting
So I put on my overcoat and went down to find

In Revlon and crimpelene they captured my heart
To the strain of a piano and a cocktail murderess
She was singing that ""It's Too Late"", I agreed with that part
For two English girls who had changed their address

One had been a beauty queen and the other was her friend
They had known rogues and rascals and showbiz impresarios
While the boys were licking Hitler they had something to defend
From men armed with chewing gum and fine nylon hose
By a bicycle factory as they sounded the siren
And returned into the dance hall she knew he was the one
Though he wasn't tall or handsome she laughed when he told her
""I'm the Sheriff of Nottingham and this is Little John""

Oh it seems we've been crying for years and for years
Now I don't speak any English, just American without tears

The Costello Show,"Oh well I had a little feeling to have a big night
And I woke up feeling small and not so brave and not quite right
Had to face of who am I, where is she, what did I do
Worst of all I had to face the big light

'Cause the big light came through my window and it opened up my eyelids
And it snapped them up like roller blinds and told me things that I did
I can't face another day and night of good ideas and complications
And I'm thankful that I didn't open another bottle of inspiration, well

With the hangover this morning had a personality
And I cast my shattered mind over selected memories
I didn't even touch the light switch so I knew I'd never see
The haggard face that would be staring back at me

'Cause the big light came through my window and it opened up my eyelids
But it snapped them up like roller blinds and told me things that I did
I can't face another day and night of good ideas and complications
And I'm thankful that I didn't open another bottle of inspiration

I had a little feeling to have a big time
And I woke up to alarm bells like a big church chime
I had to face the who am I, who is she, what did I do
First of all I had to face the big light

And watch this hurtin' feeling disappear
Like it was common sense
It was a fine idea at the time
Now it's a brilliant mistake

She said that she was working for the ABC News
It was as much of the alphabet as she knew how to use
Her perfume was unspeakable
It lingered in the air
Like her artificial laughter
Her mementos of affairs
""Oh"" I said ""I see you know him""
""Isn't that very fortunate for you""
And she showed me his calling card
He came third or fourth and there were more than one or two
He was a fine idea at the time
Now he's a brilliant mistake

He thought he was the King of America
But it was just a boulevard of broken dreams
A trick they do with mirrors and with chemicals

And the acts of love in screams

To be the love of one true heart
Or the jack of all parades

You won't know who to thank
You won't know who to blame
It's just a part of the murdering game
'Cause down in the fleshpots
Where they pay you in pounds

And baying like bloodhounds

That looked so much like Judy Garland
That people would stop and give her money
And everybody was Frankie, Jimmy or Bobby
Not the jack, not the jack of all parades,
Oh the jack, the jack of all parades,
Oh the jack, of all parades.

Well the way that I feel is no longer news
You know my love and how to refuse it
'Cause you know where the door is
And how to use it
Oh you know you do

From my checkered past
To this shattered terrace
Where you can't keep your mind off
The crimes of Paris
And you can't keep your peace
Try to forget it
And I can't forgive you
For things you haven't done yet

I was anybody's boy
But soon that thrill just fades
To be the love of one true heart
Or the jack of all parades

When we first met I didn't know what to do
My old love lines were all worn out on you
And the world walked 'round my mouth
I didn't mean to say it
I just blurted it out
And you pretended not to notice
Or be taken aback
And I loved you there and then

That he twists with nicotine fingers
As he drops his cigarette ash
And someone comes and sweeps it up
And then he doffs his cap
And there's a rat in someone's bedroom
And they're shutting someone's trap
And they'll soon be pulling down the little palaces

And the doors swing back and forward, from the past into the present
And the bedside crucifixion turns from wood to phosphorescent
And they're moving problem families from the South up to the North,
Mother's crying over some soft soap opera divorce,
And you say you didn't do it, but you know you did of course,
And they'll soon be pulling down the little palaces

It's like shouting in a matchbox, filled with plasterboard and hope,
Like a picture of Prince William in the arms of John the Pope
There's a world of good intentions, and pity in their eyes,
The sedated homes of England, are theirs to vandalize

So you knock the kids about a bit, because they've got your name,
And you knock the kids about a bit, until they feel the same
And they feel like knocking down the little palaces

You're the twinkle in your daddy's eye, a name you spray and scribble,
You made the girls all turn their heads, and in turn they made you miserable

Rid me of the problem, do all that you can
Keep me in a daydream, keep me goin' strong
You don't wanna save me, sad is my song 
When you believe in things that you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way, yeh, yeh 

Very superstitious, nothin' more to say
Very superstitious, the devil's on his way
Thirteen month old baby, broke the lookin' glass
Seven years of bad luck, good things in your past
When you believe in things that you don't understand
Then you suffer, superstition ain't the way, no, no, no",Superstition [Live],1997

I'll begin to reach my prime

All I can spend is just my time

But I'm afraid that when he's cooled off
And maybe I'm ruled off his list
I'll never be missed

Kicking the gong around?""

Their old familiar carols play,
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth, good will to men.

The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along the unbroken song
Of peace on earth, good will to men.

The world revolved from night to day,
A voice, a chime, a chant sublime
Of peace on earth, good will to men.

And in despair I bowed my head
“There is no peace on earth,” I said,
“For hate is strong and mocks the song
Of peace on earth, good will to men.”

The wrong shall fail, the right prevail
With peace on earth, good will to men.”",I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day,2002

The Countdown Kids,"[Chorus]
Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee
Little Jackie Paper loved that rascal Puff,
and brought him strings and sealing wax and other fancy stuff. Oh

[Chorus: x2]

Together they would travel on a boat with billowed sail
Jackie kept a lookout perched on Puff's gigantic tail,
Noble kings and princes would bow whene'er they came,
Pirate ships would lower their flag when Puff roared out his name. Oh

[Chorus]

A dragon lives forever but not so little boys
Painted wings and giant rings make way for other toys.
One grey night it happened, Jackie Paper came no more
And Puff that mighty dragon, he ceased his fearless roar.

His head was bent in sorrow, green scales fell like rain,
Puff no longer went to play along the cherry lane.
Without his life-long friend, Puff could not be brave,
So Puff that mighty dragon sadly slipped into his cave. Oh

like a clown I pretend to be glad

the tears of a clown, when there's no one around
Oh yeah, baby,
 
Now if I appear to be carefree, 
it's only to camouflage my sadness
in order to shield my pride 
I try to cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But Don't let my show convince you 
that I've been happy since you decided to go,
I need you so, I'm hurt and I want you to know
but for others I put on a show

Baby, everything is all right, uptight, out of sight

The only shirt I own is hangin' on my back
But I'm the envy of every single guy 
Since I'm the apple of my girl's eye
When we go out stepping on the town for a while 
My money's low and my suit's out of style
But it's all right if my clothes aren't new 
Out of sight because my heart is true
She says baby everything is alright, uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight
I'm a pearl of a girl, I guess that's what you might say
I guess her folks brought her up that way
The right side of the tracks, she was born and raised 
In a great big old house, full of butlers and maids
No one is better than I, I know I'm just an average guy
No football hero or smooth Don Juan
Got empty pockets, you see I'm a poorman's son
She says give her the things that money can buy 
But I'll never, never make my baby cry

My eyes adored you like a million miles away from me

Carried your books from school
Playin' make believe you're married to me
You were fifth grade, I was sixth when we came to be
Walkin' home ev'ry day over Bonnicut Bridge and Bay
Till we grew into the me and you who went our separate ways

My eyes adored you though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you like a million miles away from me
You couldn't see how I adored you
So close, so close and yet so far
Headed for city lights, climbed the ladder up to fortune and fame
I worked my fingers to the bone made myself a name
Funny I seemed to find that no matter how the years unwind
Still I reminisce 'bout the girl I miss and the love I left behind

My eyes adored you though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you like a million miles away from me
You couldn't see how I adored you
So close, so close and yet so far

All my life I will remember how warm and tender we were way back then

Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free

To the California sun

Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine

Dreams that should have lasted
Moments, hours, slipping by as we
Told each other secrets

Somehow I'll never let go of the memories
Something always seems to remind me
Of how it was, of what it was
What it was, all there was

Laughter, love songs, footsteps that I hear
Make me think you're near me
Poems, pictures, letters never mailed
Boats that never sailed

Remember that even though we can't be together
We're more for having loved one another
We shared the sky, we learned to fly

Someday when someone else's arms are around us
When time has put some distance between us
The years will kindly show, how memories come and go
They ebb and flow like the tides

There are quiet, places in my heart
Ever since we've parted
Gentle, tender, traces of a song
Places that belong to you

On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

The girls in Aruba doing belly-dancings 
Spent half of my advancing 
Jaws from branson 
I make it through my circumstances 
But u know I'm wiser now 
Move like kaiser now 
gotta butter soft cover just to hide my pound 
gotta house in the valley 
Come and find me now 
Got enough dough to buy the town 
So I might give a 6 to my chick 
Benz to my mom 
Crib so big it look like the Sinigon 
Give a couch just to spill henny on
And Benadon since Lados and Benaton 

Some people say that I'm not the same girl 
They say that I think I'm in my own world 
What makes them think that I have changed 
A little dough cannot erase my problems

How is it to be down with me with me 
Afraid to express myself always me and someone else 
I need to be free but its not that easy

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted

It's late September and
I really should be back at school.
I know I keep you amused,
But I feel I'm being used.
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone.
You stole my heart, and that's what really hurts.

The morning sun, when it's in your face,
Really shows your age.
But that don't worry me none.
In my eyes, you're everything.
I laughed at all of your jokes.
My love you didn't need to coax.
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone.
You stole my soul, and that's a pain I can do without.

All I needed was a friend
To lend a guiding hand.
But you turned into a lover, and, mother, what a lover!
You wore me out.
All you did was wreck my bed,
And, in the morning, kick me in the head
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
'Cause you didn't want to be alone.
You stole my heart. I couldn't leave you if I tried.

I suppose I could collect my books
And get on back to school.
Or steal my daddy's cue
And make a living out of playing pool.
Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band
That needs a helping hand.

There was a Buffalo Soldier
In the heart of America
Stolen from Africa, brought to America
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival

I mean it, when I analyze the stench
To me, it makes a lot of sense
How the Dreadlock Rasta was the Buffalo Soldier
And he was taken from Africa, brought to America
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival

Said he was a Buffalo Soldier, Dreadlock Rasta

Then you would know where you coming from
Then you wouldn't have to ask me
Who the heck do I think I am

I'm just a Buffalo Soldier

The more I learn, the less I know about before

Digging deep for clues on higher ground

Moon and stars sit way up high
Earth and trees beneath them lie
The wind blows fragrant lullaby
To cool the night for you and I
On the wing the birds fly free
Leviathan tames angry sea
The flower waits for honeybee
The sunrise wakes new life in me

And every hour of every day I'm learning more
The more I learn, the less I know about before
The less I know, the more I want to look around
Digging deep for clues on higher ground

The fishes swim while rivers run
Through fields to feast my eyes upon
Intoxicated drinking from
The loving cup of burning sun
In dreams I'll crave familiar taste
Of whispered rain on weary face
Of kisses sweet and warm embrace
Another time another place

But all the praying just ain't helping at all, 
'Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble.
So, he goes out and he makes his money the best way he know how,
Another body laying cold in the gutter.

But he just can't see.

But he doesn't recognize his own face.
His health is fading and he doesn't know why.

I pray all ten fade away
Seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like his promise is true
Only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew
To bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes
No more lonely cries
My only bleedin' hope
Is for the folk who can't cope
Wit such an endurin' pain
That it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame
For tootin' caine in your own vein
What a shame
You shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane
And name this day in time
For fallin prey to crime
I say the system got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations
In hopes of comin' true
Believe in yourself
The rest is up to me and you

I stood alone in the cold gray dawn

But you don't find roses growin' on stalks of clover

Well if sweet-talkin' you could make it come true
I would give you the world right now on a silver platter
But what would it matter
So smile for a while and let's be jolly
Love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can

But if that's what it takes to hold you
I'd just as soon let you go
But there's one thing I want you to know
You better look before you leap, still waters run deep
And there won't always be someone there to pull you out

The Countdown Singers,"I have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the skies
Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies
Turning on the world, the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes
 
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
Coming close together
With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time
She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
 
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I""ve been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend

And you took them all apart

All through their high school days
Both members of the 4H club, both active in the FFA
After graduation 
Mary Anne went out lookin' for a bright new world
Wanda looked all around this town and all she found was Earl

It wasn't two weeks after she got married that 
Wanda started gettin' abused
She'd put on dark glasses or long sleeved blouses 
Or make-up to cover a bruise
Well she finally got the nerve to file for divorce 
And she let the law take it from there
But Earl walked right through that restraining order 
And put her in intensive care

Right away Mary Anne flew in from Atlanta 
On a red eye midnight flight
She held Wanda's hand as they worked out a plan 
And it didn't take 'em long to decide

That Earl had to die, goodbye Earl
Those black-eyed peas, they tasted alright to me, Earl
You're feelin' weak? Why don't you lay down and sleep, Earl
Ain't it dark wrapped up in that tarp, Earl

The cops came by to bring Earl in
They searched the house high and low
Then they tipped their hats and said, thank you ladies
If you hear from him let us know
Well the weeks went by and spring turned to summer 
And summer faded into fall
And it turns out he was a missing person who nobody missed at all

So the girls bought some land and a roadside stand 
Out on highway 109
They sell Tennessee ham and strawberry jam 
And they don't lose any sleep at night, 'cause

So I made up my mind, it must come to an end
Look at me now, will I ever learn?
I don't know how but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything 

[Chorus]
Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again
My my, just how much I've missed you?

Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go 
I've been angry and sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you ""we're through""
And when you go, when you slam the door
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything

Yes, I've been brokenhearted

We are undercover passion on the run 
Chasing love up against the sun 
We are strangers by day, lovers by night 
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right
I've got something that I must tell 
Last night someone rang our doorbell 
And it was not you my part-time lover 
And then a man called our exchange 
But didn't want to leave his name 
I guess that two can play the game 
Of part-time lovers 
You and me, part-time lovers 
But, she and he, part-time lovers

The Countdown Singers,"I heard he was gonna marry some girl from Denver
Then my sister came over, had the Sunday paper with her
There was the girl on the social page
Lookin' in love and all engaged
We decided she don't take a very good picture

It may be my family's redneck nature
Rubbin' off, bringin' out unlady-like behavior
It sure ain't Christian to judge a stranger
But I don't like her
She may be an angel who spends all winter
Bringin' the homeless blankets and dinner
A regular Nobel Peace Prize winner
But I really hate her
I'll think of a reason later

I drew horns and blacked out her tooth with a marker
Childish, yes, but she made such a thin little target
I couldn't be happier on my own
But I've got the slightest of a jealous bone
And seein' her with him tends to enlarge it

It may be my family's redneck nature
Rubbin' off, bringin' out unlady-like behavior
It sure ain't Christian to judge a stranger
But I don't like her
She may be an angel who spends all winter
Bringin' the homeless blankets and dinner
A regular Nobel Peace Prize winner
But I really hate her
I'll think of a reason later

Inside her head may lay all the answers
For curin' diseases from baldness to cancer
Salt of the earth and a real good dancer
But I really hate her
I'll think of a reason later

Well, it was just one tooth
Did I mention I don't particularly care for her?
She makes me sick",I'll Think of a Reason Later [Instrumental],2003

No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring
No song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day
No April rain
No flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
No summer's high
No warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze
No falling leaves

No Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do

Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind

Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me

And buddy, that was good enough for me

Tomorrow morning I know there'll be hell to pay

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

The Country Dance Kings,"Well, I woke up this morning, stumbled out of my rack.
I opened up the paper to the page in the back.
It only took me a minute for my finger to find 
my daily dose of destiny under my sigh.
My eyes just about popped out-a my head. 
It said,""The starts are stacked against you, girl. Get back in bed.""
 
I feel lucky,
I feel lucky, Yeah.
No Professor Doom gonna stand in my way.
Mm, I feel lucky today.
 
Well, I strolled down to the corner, gave my numbers to the clerk.
The pot's eleven million, so I called in sick to work.
I bought a pack of Camels, a burrito and a Barq's 
crossed against the light made a beeline for the park.
The sky began to thunder, the wind began to moan.
I heard a voice above me sayin', ""Girl, you'd better get back home.""
 
I feel lucky, 
I feel lucky, yeah.
No tropical depression gonna steal my sun away.
Mm, I feel lucky today.
 
Now Eleven million later, I was sittin' at the bar.
I bought the house a double, then the waitress a new car.
Dwight Yoakim's in the corner, try'n' to catch my eye.
Lyle Lovett's right beside me with his hand upon my thigh.
The moral of this story, it's simple but it's true:
Hey, the stars might lie, but the numbers never do.
 
I feel lucky, 
I feel lucky, yeah.
Hey Dwight, hey Lyle, boys, you don't have to fight.
Hot dog, I feel lucky tonight.
 
I feel lucky, 
I feel lucky.

The Country Dance Kings,"They were farm kids way down in Dixie 
They met in high school in the 'sixties.
Everyone knew it was love from the start.
One July in the midnight hour, 
They climbed upon the water tower,
Stood on the rail and painted a ten foot heart 
In John Deere green, on a hot summer night.
He wrote Billy Bob loves Charlene in letters three foot high,
And the whole town said that he should've use red 
But it looked good to Charlene in John Deere Green.
 
They settled down on eighty acres,
Raising sweet corn, kids and tomatoes,
They went together like a hand and a glove.
On a clear day, from their front yard,
If you look and know what to look for,
Off to the east you can still read his words of love
 
He wrote Billy Bob loves Charlene in letters three foot high,
And the whole town said that he should've use red 
But it looked good to Charlene in John Deere Green.
 
Now more than once the town has discovered 
Painting over it ain't no use.
There ain't no paint in the world that'll cover it, 
The heart keeps showing through.

The Country Dance Kings,"I was goin' through the closet
Back in my old home
Found my letterman's jacket, so I slipped it on
Deep in the pocket, still folded up tight
Was the letter you wrote to tell me goodbye
The minute I saw it I just had to smile
It smelled like old leather, as smooth as a child
I took a deep breath, then put it away
There was no need to read, I knew just what it would say

[Chorus]
I know the words by heart, I know every line
From ""this ain't easy"" to ""you'll get along just fine""
I know every comma, every question mark
No, I don't have to look, I know the words by heart

Scenes like home movies flash through my head
The homecoming game, that night on my bed
The words that you wrote still cut me in two
How you said you still cared but that we were through

[Chorus]

Ain't it funny how a memory 
Can play tricks on your mind
I don't remember a thing from my classes
But I can quote you every line

I took off my jacket and put it away
With your note in the pocket 
Like I found it that day
Poured me a beer, then pictured your face
And drank a silent toast to things that time can't erase

And when them chicken fried steaks arrived
She said ""I like livin' like this"".

Have some onion rings and watch TV""

Those hearts that have no scars to show
The ones that never do let go
And risk it the tables being turned

Who have to dance within the flame
Who chance the sorrow and the shame

But you got to be tough when consumed by desire
'Cause it's not enough just to stand outside the fire
We call them strong
Those who can face this world alone
Who seem to get by on their own
Those who will never take the fall

We call them weak
Who are unable to resist

And for that forsake it all

They're so hell bent on giving, walking a wire
Convinced it's not living if you stand outside the fire

A teardrop rolled down Bubba's nose

Just like somebody kicked him

Said it played a sad song it made him cry

Remember when old ones died and new were born
And life was changed, disassembled, rearranged
We came together, fell apart
And broke each other's hearts
Remember when

Remember when the sound of little feet
Was the music we danced to week to week
Brought back the love, we found trust
Vowed we'd never give it up
Remember when

Remember when thirty seemed so old
Now lookin' back, it's just a steppin' stone
To where we are, where we've been
Said we'd do it all again
Remember when

Remember when we said when we turned gray
When the children grow up and move away
We won't be sad, we'll be glad
For all the life we've had
And we'll remember when

The Country Dance Kings,"Where were you when the world stopped turnin'
That September day?
Out in the yard with your wife and children
Or workin' on some stage in L.A.?
Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke
Risin' against that blue sky?
Did you shout out in anger, in fear for your neighbor,
Or did you just sit down and cry?

Did you weep for the children, they lost their dear loved ones,
Pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?
Did you burst out in pride for the red, white, and blue
And heroes who died just doin' what they do?
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
And look at yourself and what really matters?

In a crowded room did you feel alone?
Did you call up your mother and tell her you love her?
Did you dust off that Bible at home?

Did you open your eyes and hope it never happened,
Close your eyes and not go to sleep?
Did you notice the sunset for the first time in ages
And speak to some stranger on the street?
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow,
Go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watchin'
And turn on """"I Love Lucy"""" reruns?
Did you go to a church and hold hands with some stranger,
Stand in line to give your own blood?
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your fam'ly,
Thank God you had somebody to love?

As she took the stage
But she was convinced if she got up there
That she'd be discovered some day
So she belted it
She hit the high notes fearlessly
Oh, she melted them
She brought them to their feet

She was a big star
At Banana Joe's Bar
Where she sang karaoke every night
She said if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight
She was a big star

She made the local cable shows
Where the camera fell in love with her face
After a couple of weekends
The groupies were crawling all over the place
And she signed autographs
Like she was Garth Brooks in a skirt
And in the aftermath
That small time town was hers

She was a big star
At Banana Joe's Bar
Where she sang karaoke every night
She said if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight
She was a big star

Hey, she doesn't care anymore
That her high school girlfriends cut her down
The only thought she entertains is where they aren't
And where she is now

A few old neighbors swear they are certain
She slept her way to the top
She knows you don't get where you're goin'
Unless you got something they ain't got
So she sings tonight
To twenty thousand plus
And the young girls scream out loud
Man that could be us

She eats caviar
Just before she performs every night
She says if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight

As we all sang along

And we sang Life's a Highway

Pull your hat down tight, and just LeDoux it

And them pickup-men are at your side

Took the whole world on, and he turned us on

These days you don't really need it thanks to reality shows
Can't wait to date a supermodel, can't wait to sue my dad
Can't wait to wreck a Ferrari on my way to rehab

'Cause when you're a celebrity
It's adios reality
You can act just like a fool
People think you're cool
Just 'cause you're on TV
I can throw a major fit
When my latte isn't just how I like it
When they say I've gone insane
I'll blame it on the fame
And the pressures that go with
Being a celebrity

I'll get to cry to Barbara Walters when things don't go my way
And I'll get community service no matter which law I break
I'll make the supermarket tabloids, they'll write some awful stuff
But the more they run my name down the more my price goes up

When they go down the drain
I'll blame it on the fame

The Country Dance Kings,"When a single mom goes out on a date with somebody new
It always winds up feeling more like a job interview
My mama used to wonder if she'd ever meet someone
Who wouldn't find out about me and then turn around and run

I met the man I call my dad when I was five years old
He took my mom out to a movie and for once I got to go
A few months later I remember lying there in bed
I overheard him pop the question and I prayed that she'd say yes

And then all of a sudden
Ah it seemed so strange to me
How we went from something's missing
To a family
Lookin' back all I can say
About all the things he did for me
Is I hope I'm at least half the dad
That he didn't have to be

I met the girl who's now my wife about three years ago
We had the perfect marriage but we wanted somethin' more
Now here I stand surrounded by our family and friends
Crowded 'round the nursery window as they bring the baby in

And then all of a sudden
Ah it seemed so strange to me
How we went from something's missing
To a family
Lookin' through the glass I think about the man
That's standing next to me

Going home to see her mama and her daddy with the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go, and she was running low on faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind, and she didn't pay attention
She was going way too fast
Before she knew it she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
And save me from this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel

It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said, ""I'm sorry for the way
I've been living my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight

Oh, it seemed like a holy place, protected by amazing grace 
And we would sing right out loud, the things we could not say 
We thought we could change this world with words like ""love"" and ""freedom"" 
We were part of the lonely crowd Inside the Sad Cafe 
Oh, expecting to fly, we would meet on that shore in the sweet by and by

And some of the stayed behind inside the Sad Cafe.

Now I look at the years gone by, and wonder at the powers that be. 
I don't know why fortune smiles on some and let's the rest go free 
Maybe the time has drawn the faces I recall 
But things in this life change very slowly, if they ever change at all 
There's no use in asking why, it just turned out that way

Ooh, would it make a difference if she'd say, if she'd say

Buy me a rose
Call me from work
Open the door for me what would it hurt?
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things
I need the most in my life

And the more that he lives
The less that he tries
To show her the love that he holds inside
And the more that she gives
The more that he sees
This is the story of you
And me

So I bought you a rose
On the way home from work
To open the door to a heart that I hurt
And I hoped you noticed this look in my eyes
'Cause I'm gonna make things right
For the rest of your life (rest of your life)
I'm gonna hold you tonight, tonight
Do all those little things
For the rest of your life
For your life, ooh",Buy Me a Rose,2011
