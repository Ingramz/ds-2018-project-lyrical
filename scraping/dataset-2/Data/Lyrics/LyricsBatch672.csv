Army of Freshmen,"When I was only a kid, I hid in the pyramids
Archeologists came so I just changed my name
I had years still to go, they were moving too slow
I was here from the start, now it's the end of the show
Forever, I never thought that this day would come
She's been my everything, not anything or anyone
Could kill the time and wait in line for a sign
Textbooks they don't mention me, forgotten over centuries

Last call that's on me, here's to eternity

10,000 years, now she's finally here
If the words come out wrong, I'll disappear

Now that I'm older than sin
I think the heavens caught wind
They send a postcard from home
They wanna throw me back in
But I am Omega Man, I am out on the lam
I think it's well understood that they don't understand
Me, myself, and I, we're hiding out in history
A specific hieroglyphic message sent to me
To kill the time, wait in line, for a sign
Final hour, nevermore, tonight's the night I've waited for

Last call that's on me, here's to eternity
And I know she's right for me, just the wrong century

10,000 years, now she's finally here
If the words come out wrong, I'll disappear
To the stars in the sky shining down on the girl
From the beginning of time, till the end of the world","10,000 Years",2006
Army of Freshmen,"Don't scream, don't cry, there's too many tears

like a lake around this place after all these years

we've been through more than our fair share

but we're both here, still standing there

we've made it this far and there's more to come

from the beat of my heart to the beat of the drum

and the shoe box of memories means more to me 

than any argument that could ever be



at the end of the day am I what you've waited for

how can I say that I need you more and more and more and more

years go by and it's just the same old war

what we have is still worth fighting for, what are we fighting for



don't walk, just run, come over to me

everything that we were, we still could be

tear down the walls that are in the way

we can start all over, it's a brand new day

when the sun comes up, we'll look back and laugh

nevermind the numbers I can do the math

multiply everyone that I've ever known

you're the only one that feels like home



I painted a picture of a boy that was trying

and a girl that was smiling and she looked just like you



at the end of the day am I what you've waited for

how can I say that I need you more and more and more and more

years go by and it's just the same old war

what we have is still worth fighting for, what are we fighting for



never look back on what we had, just try to believe in what we have

just think this out and take your time, it's not your fault and it's not mine

never look back on what we had, just try to believe in what we have

just listen close to the beat of my heart, it's yours for the taking



at the end of the day am I what you've waited for

how can I say that I need you more and more and more and more

years go by and it's just the same old war

what we have is still worth fighting for, what are we fighting for



at the end of the day am I what you've waited for

how can I say that I need you more and more and more and more

years go by and it's just the same old war

what we have is still worth fighting for, what are we fighting for



I painted a picture of a boy that was trying

and a girl that was smiling and she looked just like you

Army of Freshmen,"Summer come please tell me what you've waited for
It's been so cold, I can't take it anymore
It's been years but I've been here before
Waiting for you here down at the shore

Message in a bottle frozen
I know he's the one you've chosen
Over me, it used to be
Summer nights, warm wind blowing
All the crowds coming down to the boardwalk
Hide from fall, when we had it all

[Chorus x1]

Carved initials on a lifeguard stand
Under the pier we were hand and hand
Were younger then, way back when
Now I'm older, sun setting
Throwing rocks off the docks, regretting
What could I do, I was wrong for you

Moonlight and the smell of the ocean air
Close my eyes and I almost see you there

[Chorus x2]

Message in a bottle buried
Under the sand, there's no hurry
They'll find it when, summer comes again

[Chorus x1]



",Down at the Shore,2006
Army of Freshmen,"She's an angel in the hallway, in the stands, and at the mall
I see her everywhere I go, she don't see me at all
I serenade her cell phone but I never hit send
I'd ask for some advice, but I don't have any friends
I am the one on I'm with the thirty seven names
Tonight its Captain Elvis. Lately he's been on his game
I'm taking up karate and I'm saving for a tat
'Cause anyone who's anyone knows girls are into that

[Chorus:]
She's so cold, freezing like disco
Outlook is so-so, romeo
I'm burning, covered in blisters
Wish I could kiss her, Juliet, Juliet

She's the picture of perfection, I'm a legend in my mind
They say that only fools rush in. Well, I'm the first in line
I'm working on my battle plan and wishing on a star
But I doubt that she'd go out with me 'cause I don't have a car
That I can drive around in circles
Does she love me, does she not?
Either way it doesn't matter 'cause I'm giving it a shot
It's not like if she shoots me down, it's headline breaking news
'Cause I may be a loser, but I don't have much to lose

Wide-eyed, tongue-tied, drama like Shakespeare

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

I know who she is, and I know who I'm not
And I know what it takes and it's not what I got
But if you start from the heart and you end with a smile
Miracles happen every once and while

She's so cold, freezing like disco
Outlook is so-so

[Chorus:]

Wide-eyed, tongue-tied, drama like Shakespeare",Juliet,2006
Army of Freshmen,"They're calling for snow
It's 40 below the weather when she had it together
Steering wheel's cold, she knows she's not old
To be feeling fairy tales have a ceiling
Land locked and alone, she picks up the phone that keeps ringing
The Beach Boys keep singing
""God Only Knows"", here comes the snow
She feels like the weather just keeps her forever

somewhere maybe in the Midwest, she sits waiting in a prom dress
Snowstorms and cold dorms and frozen boys who
Melt like snow in December, she can't help to remember
Map on the wall that somebody else calls home

land locked and alone, she hangs up the phone
A wrong number in search of the summer
That someone else lives in, she's starting to give in
To habits like splitting she just isn't fitting
In the with the crowd or the oncoming clouds
That tear through the winter, slowly they splinter
The dreams that she had, she wanted so bad
Before the weather kept her forever

the forecast is calling for outcasts

somewhere maybe in the Midwest, she sits waiting in a prom dress
Snowstorms and cold dorms and frozen boys who
Melt like snow in December, she can't help to remember
Map on the wall that somebody else calls home

as the snow globe on the dashboard crashes down against the ground
The ballerina that was trapped inside is free forever now

somewhere maybe in the Midwest, she sits waiting in a prom dress
Snowstorms and cold dorms and frozen boys who
Melt like snow in December, she can't help to remember
Map on the wall that somebody else calls home

somewhere maybe in the Midwest, she sits waiting in a prom dress
Snowstorms and cold dorms and frozen boys who
Melt like snow in December, she can't help to remember
Map on the wall that somebody else calls home

Army of Freshmen,"Saturday night and the rain keeps pouring
Down to wash away this boring
Town where no one left is scoring
That's how the story goes
Voices in my head start screaming
Seeing stars but I'm not dreaming
Sinking in this empty feeling
That's how the story goes 

Here comes the weekend, here comes the same old song
We keep singing but we get it wrong
At a party with more faces then friends
If the fun never starts then the fun never ends
But the weight of the town it just dragged us down
We know every street but we're lost not found
Screaming inside but we make no sound
Gearing up for the weekend let down

Saturday night and the rain keeps pouring
Down to wash away this boring
Town where no one left is scoring
That's how the story goes
Voices in my head start screaming
Seeing stars but I'm not dreaming
Sinking in this empty feeling
That's how the story goes

In a small town well the word spreads fast
And the great nights have long since passed
And the future is whatever dad does
What you are isn't far from what he was
Cashed and crashed as the party winds down
The place is trashed but the sorrows drowned
And in the morning when I'm not around
For at least one night I'll be the talk of the town

For every drunken promise past, this time I'll make it last

Saturday night and the rain keeps pouring
Down to wash away this boring
Town where no one left is scoring
That's how the story goes
Voices in my head start screaming
Seeing stars but I'm not dreaming
Sinking in this empty feeling
That's how the story goes

Same faces never seemed so old, same stories always being told
I'll add one last chapter to mine, out where the sun still shines

There goes the weekend, there goes the same old song
We kept singing but we got it wrong

Saturday night and the rain keeps pouring
Down to wash away this boring
Town where no one left is scoring
That's how the story goes
Voices in my head start screaming
Seeing stars but I'm not dreaming
Sinking in this empty feeling
That's how the story goes",Talk of the Town,2006
Army of Freshmen,"The courtship stars out, where romance plays out
Over at my house, I'm on the couch
You're on the TV, not here with me
That's a problem, we can figure out
Sabotage fame, we need a scandal bad
So you can exit red carpet, enter drug rehab
When your looks go down the drain
And your career is through
Then I'll be there for you and you'll be there too.

Hollywood lights in my backyard
Your movie's great, my life is hard
Why can't you see through the screen

You came from nowhere and I still live there
They say life's not fair but I don't care
If there's a problem with my master plan
Fate can take it up with somebody who gives a damn
'Cause I got a lot to offer you minus the rent
It's another clear reason why you're heaven sent
And I know I'm not the one that you've been waiting for
But I want you more than anyone before

Hollywood lights in my backyard
Your movie's great, my life is hard
Why can't you see through the screen
Baby blue jean submarine
Your big shot just broke my dreams
Why can't you see through the screen

Suffer through the tabloids seeing you and Mr. Right
Living out your picture perfect life
Gold up in the hills while this loneliness just kills
Staring up into your name that's on the sign

Hollywood lights in my backyard
Your movie's great, my life is hard, is hard
Baby blue jean submarine
Your big shot just broke my dreams, my dreams

I could write a screenplay of a single perfect night
Soundtrack of Sinatra by moonlight
Masterpiece of prose with just one single red rose

Army of Freshmen,"Lucky you look down do you notice me
Do you remember, the way it used to be
Some summer, much younger
Way over the under pass
I thought those days would last

I'll travel time, flashback and make you mine, before your star shined

I'll go back and find you and somehow remind you
The way that we were in the days far behind you
A wrinkle in time way back when you were mine

throwing wishes in well, no parachute
You were half way hot and I was kinda cute
Together forever till time came and severed
What ever we had then is coming round again

stone age 2nd round, Big Ben falling down, Model T turnaround, back in time
Long lost looking glass, afghan covered past, HG wouldn't last, back in time

I'll travel time, flashback and make you mine, before your star shined

I'll go back and find you and somehow remind you
The way that we were in the days far behind you
A wrinkle in time way back when you were mine

stone age 2nd round, Big Ben falling down, Model T turnaround, back in time
Long lost looking glass, afghan covered past, HG wouldn't last, back in time
Concrete buried deep, cobblestone back street, quantum physic leap, back in time
Crash land planet ape, rewind, great escape, I've got shotgun, back in time

I'll travel time, flashback and make you mine, before your star shined
And I rode the bench on life's sideline, count down 3, 2, 1

I'll go back and find you and somehow remind you
The way that we were in the days far behind you
A wrinkle in time way back when you were mine

I'll go back and find you and somehow remind you
The way that we were in the days far behind you
A wrinkle in time way back when you were mine

Staying here makes me insane
All the nights that I've been through
Thinking how get over you

I can, I can, I can stand for myself

You were always full of greed
You supplied the luxury
But this heart was not impressed
I'll be happy left with less

I'll be fine out on my own
I can face the world alone
Once a trophy on the shelf
Now I stand up for myself

I've got a life to live
I've got to give myself a chance
I'm leaving you behind today

I'm still walking out that door
It's pathetic how you try
Makes me laugh to see you cry

Here's the boy that you deceived
See him pack his bags and leave
I no longer need your help
I can stand up for myself

You're so conservative
You pride yourself with tolerance
Still can't accept I walk away

I've got a life to live
I've got to give myself a chance
I'm leaving you behind today

Don't you dare to cause a scene
All those quarrels are routine
I'm as happy as could be
I have walked away I'm free

Que gostava de política em mil novecentos e sessenta e seis
E hoje dança no frenetic Dancin' Days
Ela me conta que era atriz e trabalhou no Hair
Com alguns homens foi feliz, com outros foi mulher
Que tem muito ódio no coração, que tem dado muito amor
E espalhado muito prazer e muita dor

Mas ela ao mesmo tempo diz que tudo vai mudar
Porque ela vai ser o que quis inventando um lugar
Onde a gente e a natureza feliz
Vivam sempre em comunhão
E a tigresa possa mais do que o leão

Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots

Remain to love until they droop and die

Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under

I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!

Arnett Cobb & The Muse All Stars,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid

I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street,1978
Arnheim,"I remember other days how I used to weep 
Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning

I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1999

For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Beware my foolish heart

Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

In spite of all my pride
In spite of little things you said

Are you someone I'll forever miss
I believed your love I can feel your love
And that's all that I wanted
I sleep your love I salute your love

The sound is heavy on me

Under the spell I wanna be under your touch
Under the spell I wanna be under the rush

Into many empty words
And I'm amazed and so astounded
That I won't get what I deserve
Whatever lies I've lived for
I have finally found the truth
I know my place, my place is with you

You are my treasure forever
The one dream I've searched for

I've not been given my tomorrow
I'm only certain of today

I know we will be together

Here's the song my heart keeps singin': 

Dinah, 
Is there anyone finer 
In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her! 

Dinah, 
With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

Came up to Harlem,
Saw everybody Truckin'.

Before the high-hats were doing it,
'Park Avenuing' it,
All over town,
You see them shufflin', shufflin', shufflin' down.

It spread like a forest blaze,
Became a craze,
Thanks to Harlem now,
Everybody's Truckin'.

When you see a fire burning inside your minds eye
Breathe the meaning of the flames before you let them die
Let them burn you through until you know that you can fly
Twisting, turning, falling, burning
Roaring balls of fire
Eyes that see them have no need
Of guides to span the wire
Let the flames burn you right through
To low the burns through higher

Come and see
Come and buy

I can sell you the love
I can buy you the morning sun

You can buy sun from the morning
From suns to the set in the morning for tea
Pockets of love but nothing to buy
Crystals of beauty, the mountain, the sea
Something that ain't through a mind full of pride
Going hands with the sun and set yourself free
Come and see
Come and buy
Come and buy, buy my love

Sleeping sunsets sweat their beauty
Melting at your feet
Take your mind through sacred fire
Leaving you complete

Let the flames burn you so hard
There can be no re-treat
Floating, drooping, looping, turning
Roaring balls of fire
Light the pathway you must take
To drag you from the mire
Sooth the darkness from your feet
Burn down your funeral pyre

Come and see
Come and buy

I can sell you the love
I can sell you the morning sun

You can buy sun from the morning
From suns to the set in the morning for tea
Pockets of love but nothing to buy
Crystals of beauty, the mountain, the sea
Something that ain't through a mind full of pride
Going hands with the sun and set yourself free

Come and see
Come and buy
Buy my fire
Buy my fire

Eyes are glaring on your face
Watching you below
Take the sun that sweats at midnight
Burning you below

See the sun as it sweats with beauty
Burning through the fire
Feeding on your soul, so deep
Fire
Come and buy my
Fire
Come and buy my fire
Come and buy
Buy my fire

Why is it so cold down here?
So cold

Arnold Klos Trio,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,

Arnold McCuller Band,"Honey you do me wrong but still I'm crazy about you
Stay away too long and I can't do without you
Every chance you get you seem to hurt me more and more
But each hurt makes my love stronger than before
I know flowers go through rain
But how can love go through pain

Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar-arity
Ain't that peculiar baby
Peculiar as can be

You tell me lies that should be obvious to me
I've been so much in love with you baby til I don't want to see
That things you do and say are designed to make me blue
It's a doggone shame my love for you makes all
Your lies seem true
But if the truth makes love last longer
Why do lies make my love stronger

Ain't that peculiar
Peculiar as can be
Ain't that peculiar baby
A peculiar-arity

I cried so much just like a child that's lost its home
Maybe baby you think these tears I cry are tears of joy
A child can cry so much until you do everything they say
But unlike a child my tears don't help me to get my way
I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears

Of sentimental verse,
Nothing in my purse,
And chuckles

For better or for worse,
How lovely it was.

Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,

Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

That never did come true?

Aron Friedman,"Take me where the sun don't shine no more
And the moon echoes where once was light
The wind is howling but it has no face
I know that we will rise again
We will fly from this city of the dead
Even if our ship flies a pirate sail
Underneath a bruised and broken sky
I know that we will rise again
There are skies of scarlet and skies of grey
I'll keep them in my heart always
Like the sea loves the land
I know that we will rise again",Rise Again,1999
Aron Wright,"He made his way to the border
In the shadow under the trees
Down by a stream in a hollow
Turn your head feel the breeze

And the red Queen was waiting for the news
For the white King to move
And the balance hung upon the head of one who tried
To stay within the shadows
And keep his undercover secret tight

They let him in by a back way
Into a chamber reserved for the Queen
She took the note that he gave her
Opened it slowly and started to read

Run to the treasury and bring me back some gold
Give it to the pawn who came, she cried
He says the white King thinks the game of chess is wrong
And all the courtiers crowded her
And this is what she told the gathered round

Go to the store by the dungeon
Take all the red paint take all the white
Make up a newborn color
Cover your neighbor we'll be all right

There will be no game today, she cried across the board
Everyday will be a holiday
And all the pieces cheered as tidings spread abroad
And the Pink Queen sat
And smiled at the cat who smiled back.",To the Country,

All these beauties, which one will I choose?
Could it be her? Or maybe her?
I just don't know who it should be  

So, I'll take them home to mama and let her decide for me.
In Spain I met Maria; full of fire
What Latin style
In France it was Elisa; such a teaser

That made me smile
The English girl was pretty what a pity
She was so shy, I wonder why?
And Lorna from California I should warn ya

Was free and wild, and I mean wild!
Mama Mia, what a mess I'm in!
Endless choices, where do I begin?

As valiant a man as ever left home
And he had been much reduced
Which caused great confusion
And that was the reason he started to roam

In Yorkshire near Rotherham, he had been on the ramble
Weary of traveling, he sat down to rest
By the foot of yon' mountain
Lays a clear flowing fountain
With bread and cold water he himself did refresh

With the night fast approaching, to the woods he resorted
With woodbine and ivy his bed for to make
But he dreamt about sighing
Lamenting and crying
Go home to your family and rambling forsake

'Twas the fifth day of November, I've reason to remember
When first he arrived home to his family and friends
And they did stand so astounded
Surprised and dumbfounded
To see such a stranger once more in their sight

And his children come around him with their prittle prattling stories
With their prittle prattling stories to drive care away
And he's as happy as those
As have thousands of riches
Contented he'll remain and not ramble away

Yeah, the dread symbolizes the natural growth
Of not just the hair, but also of the mind
And also the bond that keeps us in love
The struggle enhances that bond, throughout time

Arrested Development,"Lately I've been in a life like limbo
Looking out of a smudged up window
We're not sure where our lives are going
Friends, it's summer outside but yet we're snowed in
Don't know where our next dollar's coming from
Living the life of a poor musician
Headliner's strong so he keeps his 9 to 5
Cutting brothers' hair as a means of staying alive
If it wasn't for the rhythm
I think we would have given up by now
This system has gotten the best of me
Now I pray for God to invest in me
My dignity, invest his glory
Give me the strength so I can finish the story
Keep on searching for the right way to go out
Coz going out is what it's all about
Huh! You can't be passive, gotta be active
Can't go with what looks attractive
Gotta learn all I can while I'm able
Headliner expresses his feeling on those turntables
When we get our chance
To make a good living of the music we program
We don't sell out just to be sold out
Brothers and sisters, do you know what I'm yapping about
Coz if they take away our contract
We still got talent and we still got contacts
Coz we're worked real hard to get this far
We were catching the bus before we bought the car

Need to learn how to correctly shoot'em

But I tell you: Ain't no room for gangstaz
Coz ganstaz do dirty work and get pimped by mobsters
Some fat Italian eating pasta 'n lobster
Brothers getting jailed and mobsters own the coppers
So you you want out of the ghetto
First the political prisoners must be let go
And you must let go of your power master
You'll never get out without much discipline
Raise your fist but also raise your children
So when you die the movement moves on
Coz with no revolution, ain't no future in front o' y'all
Haha yeah direct your anger, love
Nothing's ever built on hate, instead love
Love your life, tackle the government

I got faith and your baby renewed this
Faith that everything will be fine
Now an adult, no more youth time

Wanna get loose, attack the dance floor
Cool, I'll hold her, you have a good time
I'll keep your baby awake so baby sleeps after nine
This is reality, we need to turn our minds
Brothers talking revolution but leave their babies behind
Well sister, he's a sucker, just leave'em be
The revolution is now up to brothers like me
To step in cause your man stepped out
The goal To raise the children, no doubt
So let's go to it and possibly
Bring a generation of nat's in the future, see

Words of wisdom should be ways of wisdom
That's exactly how you must walk
Life's too short, your mission's too dire
Nurture another mind before yours expires
Pass it on, push it along

In fact, no brotherman here, have two
Two dollars means a snack for me

Be strong, serve God only
Know that if you do, beautiful heaven awaits
That's the poem I wrote for the first time
I saw a man with no clothes, no money, no plate
Mr. Wendal, that's his name
No one ever knew his name cause he's a no-one
Never thought twice about spending on a ol' bum
Until I had the chance to really get to know one
Now that I know him, to give him money isn't charity
He gives me some knowledge, I buy him some shoes
And to think blacks spend all that money on big colleges
Still most of y'all come out confused

Go ahead, Mr. Wendal 

Mr. Wendal has freedom
A free that you and I think is dumb
Free to be without the worries of a quick to diss society
For Mr. Wendal's a bum
His only worries are sickness
And an occasional harassment by the police and their chase
Uncivilized we call him
But I just saw him eat off the food we waste
Civilization, are we really civilized, yes or no
Who are we to judge
When thousands of innocent men could be brutally enslaved
And killed over a racist grudge
Mr. Wendal has tried to warn us about our ways
But we don't hear him talk
Is it his fault when we've gone too far
And we got too far, cause on him we walk
Mr. Wendal, a man, a human in flesh
But not by law

Realize that all in all you stand tall

But in a way that's fine with me

Holding hands 'till we touch each and every finger
As the ocean water wets us both
In the center of the crossroads

Well Let's drive to the city
And walk among the lights of the city streets

All you've been is very natural
That's why I'm scared to fall in love with you

Although I am black and proud, problems got me pessimistic
Brothers and sisters keep messin' up, why does it have to be so damn tuff?
I don't know where I can go to let these ghosts out of my skull
My grandma past my brother's gone, I never at once felt so alone
I know you're supposed to be my steering wheel, not just my spare tire

(Home!) to be my guiding force and truth
(Home!) For some strange reason it had to be

Make me forget all that hurts me, let me understand your plan

Make me forget all that hurts me, let me understand your plan

Lord it's obvious we got a relationship
Talkin' to each other every night and day
Although you're superior over me
We talk to each other in a friendship way
Then outta nowhere you tell me to break
Outta the country and into more country
Past Dyesburg and Ripley
Where the ghost of childhood haunts me
Walk the roads my forefathers walked
Climb the trees my forefathers hung from
Ask those trees for all their wisdom
They tell me my ears are so young (Home)
Go back, from whence you came (Home)
My family tree, my family name (Home)

Now I see the importance of history
Why my people be in the mess that they be
Many journeys to freedom made in vain
By brothers on the corner playin' ghetto games
I ask you, Lord why you enlightened me
Without the enlightenment of all my folks
He said, cuz I set myself on a quest for truth
And he was there to quench my thirst
But I am still thirsty
The Lord allowed me to drink some more
He said what I am searching for are
The answers to all which are in front of me
The ultimate truth started to get blurry

It was all a dream about Tennessee

Sand grain by sand grain
Shore turns to sea
Shore turns to ocean
Serpent creates the high tides
To assure all good is floating
Good and righteousness is not intellectual
And the fabric that's good cannot be proven
And so that fabric is washed away
Far from the shore from which it was woven
The shore is a place where persons live
Sowing fabrics that's a tangent of the real one
Not wearable to most of the persons on shore
In fact, it's only wearable to the person of one
One person under an oath
An oath to a serpent, an evil snake
In search for being as powerful as God
And all God's good he'll try to take

He'll try to take
He'll try to take
Good being washed away
Love being washed away

Most of the persons follow the serpent
Cause the serpent preaches all for self
But why follow someone in search of something
When you'll get nothing
Serpent's all for self
Some are dumb, some know no better
Some believe there is no Lord
The serpent uses this knowledge to help him
And wash away more of the shore
Serpent knows once shores are gone
There's nothing left but ocean and sea
A few persons trying to save the shore
Some of those persons are A.D
Saving the shores means saving the faith
The faith that there is a mighty someone
Someone much more mighty than the serpent
In fact there's someone that created everyone
Up the ocean without a paddle
Is the fabric of God, the righteous clothing
And you wear non-righteous clothes of the serpent

We can stop being washed away

Why we let them wash it away
Why are we allowing them to take what's good
Why don't we teach our children what's good
Why don't we collect and save what is real
Look very hard and swim the ocean
We must find what needs to be found
Look all around and find a wise man
To feed us the truth and keep us sound
All of us must swim the seas
Coz our path's been washed away
All of us must swim the seas
Cause our path's been washed away
My only purpose is to swim the seas
Find the truth and spread it around
Give it to the children that know how to listen
So they can pass it after I drown

They're praising a God that watches you weep
And doesn't want you to do a damn thing about it

Does shouting bring about change ? I doubt it
All shouting does is make you lose your voice

Naively so I give it another go

Just pray so you can see the pearly gates so white
The lady prays and prays and prays and prays
And prays and prays and prays and prays it's everlasting
""There's nothing wrong with praying ?"" It's what she's asking
She's asking the Lord to let her cope
So one day she can see the golden ropes
What you pray for God will give
To be able to cope in this world we live
The word ""cope"" and the word ""change""
Is directly opposite, not the same
She should have been praying to change her woes
But pastor said ""Pray to cope with those""

Africas's a bolling over flowing inside of me
I used to sport a curl made by Jerry
A Jerry curl
but as time passed it didn't last
after my curl I never combed my doo.
I used to sport a cap but the naps kept shining through.
Shining!
My sista got a brand new perm
my boys says she looks pretty fine body real firm
folds at her job loves her new touch up
I can tell her white boss gets a kick when she's all done up.
My sista loves her blackness
but the US. says that her perm is her attractiveness.
But Africa keeps coming stronger-we found out
it ain't a perm it's a temporary
Don't heve sash to go to the music school
no money for the guitar or the violin or the tuba
my moms had a record player and the 45's
I put the needle on the record and I kicked it crazy live
scratching it up catching the breaks
spirits within me had me do what it takes
Grammy's I win & one again like my Egyptian kin
it's Africa within makin' something outta nothing!

CHORUS: (x2)
Africa's inside me
taking back her child
she's giving me my pride
and setting me free.

What's that land across those waters?
what's that spirit makin'love to my daughter
telling her not to eat he mama's ham hocks
allowing her the choice to twist her hair & make it lock.
yo I don't like it, I just don't like it.
Papa may say buy my soul is a boilin'
and sooner or later Africa's glory and toil
will teach an old dog new tricks
Why and the world can't everybody
recognize that Africa's in everybody?
we all ask why can't we be sista's and brothers
but first we gotta accept who is our mother
Rather embracer of the jungle
or ghetto melanin dwells but could stop growth
and developments Arrested for nothing
Gumbo's within' soulful H20 men be droppin'
Happenin's like Homosapians Hustlins
within' to exist as afro USA...men
residing in Fulani was once Christian.

you fool your subconscious into accepting it.
I ain't accepting it.  I keep my focus. I keep my focus.
I ain't accepting it. Give me a face pencil to draw a smile on me
and say my prayer to give my earthlybody inner peace.
And say my prayer to give my earthly body inner, inner peace

Talkin' to each other every night and day

Climb the trees my forefathers hung from

Why my people be in the mess that they be
Many journeys to freedom made in vain
By brothers on the corner playin' ghetto games
I ask you, Lord why you enlightened me
Without the enlightenment of all my folks
He said, cuz I set myself on a quest for truth
And he was there to quench my thirst
But I am still thirsty
The Lord allowed me to drink some more
He said what I am searching for are
The answers to all which are in front of me

Finding themselves with out you bringin' racism

Just to bring peace do I have to get a piece?
And in the break of dawn I guess I'll pray to the east
'Cause I'm not the one to get slapped on the cheek
Without my fist curling up to hit you back in your teeth, yo

Free yourself
Free yourself
Freedom

Is what we want not a fight
Waving confederate flags and gun toting is your type

Will clear my brain while he clears where I dwell
I call on the natural forces that be
To help to free me, to free me

Business as I kick up the treble tone.
On my radio tape player box right?
Just loud enough so folks could hear it's hype see?
Outta no where comes the woman I'm dating.
Investigation maybe she was demonstrating.
But never the less I was pleased.
My day was going great and my soul was at ease...
Until a group of brothers started buggin' out.
Drinkin' the 40 oz. going the nigga route!
Disrespecting my black queen.
Holding their crotches & being obscene.
At first I ignored em cuz see I know their type,
They got drunk & got guns & they wanna fight.
& they C A young couple having a time that is good.
Now their egos wanna test a brothers manhood!
So they came to test speech cuz of my hair doo.
And the loud bright colors that I wear boo.
I was a target cause I'm a fashion misfit.
And the outfit that I'm wearing brothers dissin' it.
Well I stay calm & pray the niggas leave me be.
But they're squeezin' parts of my dates anatomy.
Why Lord do brothers have to drill me?
Cause if I start to hit this man they'll have to kill me!
 
I am Ev'ry Day People.

I am Ev'ry Day People.
Whoa, I.
Whoa, I.
Whoa, I.

I told the niggas please let us pass friend.
I said please cause I don't like killing Africans.
But he wouldn't stop & I ain't ice cube.
But I had to take the brother out for being rude!
And like I said before I was mad by then.
It took 3 or 4 cops to pull me off of him.
But that's the story yaw'll of a black man.
Acting like a nigga and get stomped by an African!

Arrested Development,"It's been years since we blessed stages 
Together, we covered bases together and whether
We all agreed or not 20/20 vision is hindsight, and
Now we got that so we done got back.
Some of our soldiers have fallen so many years of toiling
Touring tears falling naw pouring jaded from the industries
Jabs a lil slower like Muhammad Ali but still we able to last so
We go in the studio it felt new but yet in a good way it felt old
Routines we did came back so lucid we was boosted we juiced it
And came up with some tracks that's stupid and people responded
To em, heads on the blocks wit locks and baggie jeans the whole
Scene was fond to em and how we got the labels kissin'
Our hind parts we desired art and never sold out for the igh chart positions

And thus they detach their roots from the soil that kept them
Loose and made what they delivered so true 
There's a desert waste land of past artists that's so cruel feeling thrown out like
Woody in toy story two and yo we felt that but let me tell you Satan 
He dealt that I think it's time to give him his deck back.

'Til the Lord came down with his holy frown and said:
â??Iâ??m gonna show you how I mad you.â??
Well I didnâ??t get it, at the moment, and before I knew it, I owned it,

A couple of keys, vertical body, dirty words and a cool head.

Put it away before we borrow it the bad way.

Sheâ??s taking your rockets, pointy and long, flip â??m around
Tickle her bong, while sheâ??s saving the world.

What to know, watch it glow, let it be blown.

Making it bigger than it is like Wordsworth
Feeding you like food, to a pool of Zulus
Singing the blues, sippinâ?? the booze, taking a bloodbath.

Iâ??m up at my own path
This is the new blues

I knew that you would understand

In my eyes
Blood drops look like roses on white lace
They won't wash away
In my mind they're roses on white lace
Straight from the heart
So dead upon the bed, still searching for your head

They're never gonna find your face
It's hidden away
I found a very special place for you used to play
In my own way, I lovingly kiss the bride
With your ring in your hand
Your eyes and your mouth open wide

In my eyes
Blood drops look like roses on white lace
They won't wash away

WITHIN MY INTRICATE
WEAVE OF BRAIN CELLS
I WITHHOLD THE MAIN SPELL
TO CAST UPON YOU DEMONS PLOTTIN' AND SCHEMIN', DREAMIN' ABOUT
THINGS THAT WILL NEVER OCCUR
IN THIS DIMENSION, FAR BEYOND YOUR WILDEST IMAGINATION, THE ILLUSTRATION'S SUSPENDED ANIMATION
I PUT YOU ON PAUSE 'CAUSE YOU'RE
TOO BUSY BENDIN' RULES WHILE I'M BREAKIN' LAWS OF GRAVITY
DON'T GIVE A DAMN IF YOU'RE MAD AT ME
FILLIN' JAWS WITH CAVITIES
IF YOU'RE STILL BREATHIN' YOU SHOULD BE GLAD TO BE ALIVE, SOME DON'T SURVIVE OR LIVE TO SEE THE NEXT DAY
YOU CAN'T RESET AND AIN'T NO FREEBIE IN THE GAME THAT YOU PLAY
YOU SLITHER SKILLFULLY AND WILLFULLY ALL OVER MY TRUST
THEN IT'S A MUST THAT YOU BITE THE DUST, YOU MIGHT HAVE TO GET BUST
OR PERSECUTED, EXECUTED, LYRICALLY DEGRADED
MENTALLY DECAPITATED, MAKIN' SURE YOU NEVER MADE IT
'CAUSE I'M FED UP WITH YOU'RE MISSION, STUPID NIGGAS NEVER LISTEN, TALKIN' 'BOUT THEY'RE NEVER DISSIN', ON THEIR OWN PEOPLE THEY'RE PISSIN'
THE HISSIN'S AT A TONE
UNDETECTABLE BY EARS
THE ADVANTAGE IS HIS OWN IF YOU HAVE NEGLECTABLE FEARS
SLIDIN' THROUGH CRACKS AND CREVICES, NO MATTER HOW TIGHT
SHOW FRIGHT,
AND PREY GETS SWALLOWED UP IN ONE BITE...

WORD... ALL JOKES ASIDE
THIS MATTER CAN BE COMPLICATED
YOU COULD
FAIL IN UNVEILIN' THE ONES WHO PERPETRATE, KID
THEIR CLOAK AND DAGGER HIDES THEIR DESIRE TO USE THE NEXT KIN
IT'S HEREDITARY AND NECESSARY TO SHED SKIN
IT TENDS TO BURN WHEN YOU'RE TOUCHED BY THE HOLY SPIRIT
PRESENTED WITH THE WORD OF GOD AND YOU DON'T WANNA HEAR IT
YOU CAN'T BE NEAR IT, YOU FEAR IT, IT ALWAYS FOILS YOUR PLANS
YOU DEAL WITH GREED AND ALWAYS FEEDIN' OF THE BLOOD OF MAN
IT'S ALL A HOAX, YOU TRY TO COAX WHEN YOU'RE UP IN MY CENTER
YOU ENTER BUT THE TEMPTOR'S NOT MY MENTOR
IT'S MY BELIEF WITHIN THE CHEMISTRY, I PREACH MY MINISTRY
GOT MY SEAL OF AUTHENTICITY, THAT'S WHY YOU'RE ALWAYS DISSIN' ME
INTERFERENCE WITH SIGNAL'S THE THING I ALWAYS TRY TO PREVENT
SLIPPERY SERPENTS
YOU NEED TO REPENT
AND AIN'T NO REPTILE WITH FANGS LONG ENOUGH TO TAKE MY SHIT
FROM TIME TO TIME I PRAY AND STAY AWAY FROM DEEP SNAKE PITS

Rock Steady was a B-boy crew, but to me it's all about hip hop,
So, rock steady is a hip hop crew now.  Its about all four elements, And we 
represent those lovely, sratch pickers, arsonists,
All the b-boys that are down with us, the b-girls, we have some dope 
B-girls, and you know, we got graf artists like East and Zero T,
Its just straight up on skills, this is Crazy Legs from the Rock Steady 
Crew, I'm out

Hip-Hop was breaking, spray paintin' full train cars
DJ's cutting emcess presents the ghetto stars
I was the skinny shorty wop, with the bop in my step
Shams the bear and teloids, playboys and I was set
Running through the streets of the boogie with a bang
Pops was kinda strict, so at times I couldn't hang
But whateva the case, I stuck close to my hip-hop
Somethin' in my soul just kept that, on lock

And oppurtunity never knocked, but we was still open
Saying ish like fresh, like def (dope in)
And crack was on the corner rumblin' the dry goods
With something I decided never to persue in my hood
I was, too busy in the middle of the streets playing skelly
With Ray and Big Lou, listenin' to Flash and Melly
And rockin' block parties, seemed to be my route
But I had to give that up, they always ended in shoot outs

Hip-Hop was rhyming, hard timin', radio hits
No dats, so the D.J's was still in the mix
Grafitti and breaking took a back seat
Cuz the A&R's couldn't figure how to make they ends meet
I was the high school rapper to the girls in the hall
While my nigga Clarence Greer was slammin' with a basketball
Tune my radio on a saturday night
Daydreamin' 'bout grippin' mikes and being in the spotlight
Fat rope chains in a pair of A.J's in the p.j's frontin' like I had status
(what) who's the baddest?
The brotha on swinten ave, though fresh out the lab
You just couldn't tell Q-Unique what he couldn't have

It all started in Bushwick, defacin' the community
Around the way, all you saw was nothin' but graffiti
As a shorty I was poppin' never could I ever stand still
Always battlin' cuz it was all about the skills
Never learned windmills, but my boogie took me places
When I started emceeing, I kept it fat like my laces
Wrestlin' was the bomb, kept me from doing my homework
Radio was my thing, when red alert went bezerk

Yes yes y'all, let me get some
Cuz we, never forgot where we came from",Flashback,1999

that contain a trillion bombs of head nod

pilot pens and compositions
Hand out the the cigars

blingin and dancin

we took to embrionic state

but that was a doctor's honest mistake

Call for the legal assistance
to push through the contract-tions

You cry into a chorus
Cut the umbilical from the mic
and take the first steps with a cordless

I slipped a little something into your drink
A potion, more like a poision
I tell you as you drive on

Brake lights shine through black
They reveal the burial plot
One last kiss before your final send-off

You take my final breaths
Thrust them into the ocean
Cement shoes, I shall become one with death

The air bubbles start to surface
A sensation of satisfaction sweeps over my entire body
Content with the done deal
The taste of this victory is almost to much for me

Don't you forget I killed you
With my death that I home-brewed
As I sink down I remember what the sea king said
""You die here""

The chemicals begin to mix
Vision begins to blur
I fall to my knees
I am my own victim

I was meant this way, either way
You tapped my phones, I made the setup
It was meant to be neptune's plan
No fate involved",Shoeshine for Neptune,2007

Oh! {*laughing}
It's club but it's still sexy
Hey! life is good
Yea, uh, uh, uh, yo

[Verse: Angie Martinez]
What's that sound?
If you outside the club, and your joint see'mon
You just pop the truck
Pull the car up and the line is packed, and you far

You tired a' waiting, you better be catch a charge like
""Move bitch, get out the way"", flash the bouncer to get out a payin'
And that sound make you want to get on stage
Oh, you gotta' ""move dem thangs""

Beat change, it's a Cool-a-Dre thing
That'll move your thang thang, remove your ring change the sound
Get your jewels all sweated up, the booze is deaded up
Anything goes bring it back, if you just catchin' up

The sound coming outta' the club - that's wassup!
And they let you up, finally, dancing it up
Movin' aroung, DJ Keith - I need that sound (da-mn)

[Chorus: Angie and Missy]
That new shit, that hot shit
Make you move shit - what's that sound?
That move crowds, that new sound
Make you can kick down - who's that chick?
That's Angie, them bambi's
Screamin' Angie - what's that sound?

Haters 'n haters you better be clear
Or you'll be kissin' my pussy on the rear

What I'm talking 'bout, with my filthy mouth, from the Dirty South
Is a drug-drop, see'mon check me out
Ain't nobody does it easy-seezy
And ain't nobody got the dick to sling me (owwww!)

God damn, what's that sound?
Didn't I tell you I'm about to shake it down
I'm no punk, but a killa like Cam
Get on the flo', yes yes mam

When I show up the club get cram
Insecure bitch watch yo man!

I don't mean to boast, but we do

I need that - yeah

[Chorus]

[Verse: Angie Martinez]
Hello-oh? oh that's my ears ringing
I'm sitting here thinking that sound is still bangin'
As we leavin' the spot I'm still drinking
Gotta' leave cause the cops are still waiting

So we circle the block, as we workin' to blot
Then purposely watch - we so blingin'
And the truck is bright, light up the night
Blinking, as we stuck in the chair feel like we sinking

That sound still drowned the air waves
The echo in my head feel like a bear cave
So I sit back to the sound of this track
Playin' on my way home - I can't forget that

That beat when you hear from the street
Make you want to get on the floor and don't even speak
Cause it don't even matter who be around

Art,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?

Art Alexakis,"5 AM on a Sunday morning
Walking uptown
With the rain in the snow
When I saw you
It came without a warning
A face I had never seen
A feeling I had never known

Moving slow in the early morning
Making love in the quiet of the day
The world was waiting to take us to a new place
We knew that we were changing
We knew that we would never be the same

I know
I would do it all over again
At the end of the day
When we are alone
I get that feeling when I see your face
And I know
You'll be there at the end of the day

Two years later we are living together
We built our dream house on a hill by the sea
We could see the shadows that were growing in the distance
We were hiding
We were blind to what we did not want to see

I know
I would do it all over again
At the end of the day
When we are alone
I get that feeling when I see your face
And I know
We will be together

5 years gone by, we have turned into strangers
We never talk since you went away
Now I find myself walking in circles
I keep looking for you everywhere
Keep waiting for the end of the day

I know
I would do it all again
At the end of the day
When I'm all alone
I get a feeling that I can't explain
If I knew then what I know now
Wouldn't change a thing, if I could somehow
I would do it all over
Over and over again
I hope and I pray
We can do it all over again
I know
We will be together someday
At the end of the day
We will be together
At the end of the day
We will be together someday
At the end of the day
We will be together",At the End of the Day,2007
Art Blakey,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree

And I like it, how about you?",How About You?,1953

A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

With nothing fancy
Nothing much

I get no kick from champagne.
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all.
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you?

Some, they may go for cocaine.
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
It would bore me terrifically, too.
Yet I get a kick out of you.

I get a kick every time I see
You standing there before me.
I get a kick though it's clear to see
You obviously do not adore me.

I get no kick in a plane.

Is my idea of nothing to do.

There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it
Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""

There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me, melody, haunting me

Alone with the tide was he,
I looked and I thought as I watched him go by:
There but for you go I.
Lonely men around me trying not to cry;
Till the day you found me, there among them was I.
I saw a man who had never known a love that was all his own.
I thought as I thanked all the stars in the sky:
There but for you go I.
I saw a man with his head bowed low
His heard had no place to go,
I looked and I thought to myself with a sigh:
There but for you go I.

Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

Why would you want to sound like U2?
Just press record and play it straight through
They call it lo-fi, if you say so

I love the sound of background noise
I wanna hear the crack in the singer's voice
Fingers moving on the fret board
Every time he plays a new chord
I hear his friends hanging around
I hear him play an instrument he just found
I hear a low buzzing sound
I hear his parents hanging around
I hear his parents saying ""turn it down""
I hear his parents saying ""turn it down""
I hear his parents saying ""turn it down!""

Art Brut,"Double shifts and early starts
I spent the morning hiding in the carpark
Oh yeah, I'm so laissez-faire
Sometimes I'm not even there
If you want me sober and straight
I'm afraid I'm gonna be a little bit late

In the stockroom, I feel like an anthropologist
I know exactly what to do
There's just one cure for the summertime blues;

I can't shake it, it won't go away

Who've I got in my corner? Axl Rose!

No one's gonna tell me what to do 
I'm gonna do what the hell I want to!

With the exception of my favorite lead singer!

Art Company,"We sit together on the sofa
With the music way down low
Waited so long for this moment
It's hard to think it's really so
The door is locked there's no one home
They've all gone out we're all alone
Su-sanna, Su-sanna
Su-sanna I'm crazy loving you
I put my arm aroud her shoulder
Run my fingers through her hair
It's a dream I can't believe it
It took so long it's only fair
And then the phone begins to ring
And a strangers voice on the other end of the line
Says oh, wrong number, sorry to waste your time
And I think to myself,
Why now,
Why me,
Why
Su-sanna, su-sanna,
Su-sanna, I'm crazy loving you
Su-sanna, Su-sanna,
Su-sanna, I'm crazy loving you
Again I sit myself beside her
Try to take her hand in mine
The moment's gone, the feeling's over
She looks around to find the time
Then she says could we just sit and chat
And I think well that's that
Susanna, Susannna,
Susanna, I'm crazy loving you
Still we sit here on the sofa
With the stereo on ten
The magic's gone, it's a disaster
There seems no point to start again
She says I think I'd better go
She says goodbye and I say... NO!
Su-sanna, Su-sanna,
Su-sanna, I'm crazy loving you
Su-sanna, Su-sanna,
Su-sanna, I'm crazy loving you
I'm so crazy loving you",Suzanna,1994

It's not a joke, kid, it's a curse.
My luck is changing, it's gotten from 
simply rotten to something worse
Who knows, some day I will win too. 
I'll begin to reach my prime.

Now though I see what our end is,
All I can spend is just my time.

I can't give you anything but love, baby.
That's the only thing I've plenty of,baby.

You have to pay, kid, for what you get.
But I am willing to wait, dear, 
Your little mate, dear, will not forget.

You have a lifetime before you.
I'll adore you, come what may.

Please don't be blue for the present, 
When it's so pleasant to hear you say

How did I guess that the long loneliness was past.
I merely looked at you and I knew that I knew.

It's you or no one for me
I'm sure of this each time we kiss
Now and forever and when forever's done
You'll find that you are still the one

Art Davis,"You stepped out of a dream
You are too wonderful to be what you seem!
Could there be eyes like yours, 
Could there be lips like yours
Could there be smiles like yours, 
Honest and truly?
You stepped out of a cloud
I want to take you away, away from the crowd
And have you all to myself, 
Alone and apart out of a dream, 
Safe in my heart
