Peter Rauhofer,"I know that I don't understand
The way my feelings roam
I've got to look outside again
And wonder where I've gone

I looked into someone's eyes again
And it's been all so long
I never wanted to talk again
I tried to silence you

You keep comin' back again 
You keep comin' back some more 

And then you come back and roam my mind
You try to make me look good
You know I just didn't have the time
I've never understood

Peter Rebhuhn,"Pardon me boy, is that the Chattanooga Choo Choo?
Track twenty nine, boy you can gimme a shine
I can afford to board a Chattanooga Choo Choo
I've got my fare and just a trifle to spare
 
You leave the Pennsylvania station 'bout a quarter to four
Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore
Dinner in the diner, nothing could be finer
Than to have your ham 'n' eggs in Carolina
 
When you hear the whistle blowin' eight to the bar
Then you know that Tennessee is not very far
Shovel all the coal in, gotta keep it rollin'
Woo, woo, Chattanooga, there you are
 
There's gonna be a certain party at the station
Satin and lace, I used to call funny face
She's gonna cry until I tell her that I'll never roam",Chattanooga Choo Choo II (KÃ¶tschenbroda-Express),1999
Peter Reese,"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.

Still live in my heart all alone

Peter Reese,"When you move in right up close to me
That's when I get the shakes all over me
Quivers down my back bone
I've got the shakes down the kneebone
Yeah havin' the tremors in the thighbone
Shakin' all over
 
Just the way you say goodnight to me
Brings that feeling on inside of me
Quivers down my back bone
I've got the quivers down the thighbone

Peter Reitmeier,"Girl, I can't help myself
I'm stuck on the view
I like the way you do
The tricks that you do

You're flirting with the music
Like it's your boo
Got me lost in my fantasy
Picturing you and me

It's been a while and I still wonder
If I'll take your hand, take over
Control your body just for the night

Let me bless your hips just like you want to
Every step I share is with you
Let me do it right, do it right

You give me reason to party
I'll probably spend all my money
The way you dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance

Got your spell on everybody
Girl, you're an artist in naughty
The way you dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance

And I don't see why I should stop
'Cause all we gotta do tonight is
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance

I feel the ice is melting
Because of you
This drink could never ever
Compete with you

The way you make me feel
It's hard to be true
I'm so drunk on the energy you
Putting inside of me

It's been a while and I still wonder
If I'll take your hand, take over
Control your body just for the night

Let me bless your hips just like you want to
Every step I share is with you
Let me do it right, do it right

You give me reason to party

'Cause all we gotta do tonight is

Ey Mr. DJ, please do me a favor
Turn it up a little bit
I wanna do this number

See, I got this little shorty
Acting like she really want it
And for sure she gonna get it
And she give me, give me, give me

You give me reason to party
I'll probably spend all my money
The way you dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance

Got your spell on everybody
Girl, you're an artist in naughty
The way you dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance

And I don't see why I should stop
'Cause all we gotta do tonight is
Dance, dance, dance, dance

There's nothin' you can say
You're talkin' to the sky girl

Got to hear the wind song
Singin' in my ear
Got to get it on girl
And I'll never make it here

'Cause the wind was my mother
The highway is my brother
I was born to wander
And it's time for movin' on
I was born to wander
Turn around and I'll be gone, gone, gone

I'm just followin' my heart girl
And it's followin' the sun
Lookin' for an answer
I know may never come
But I gotta chase my dreams girl
Like a river to the sea
Got to find a rainbow
That's waitin' there for me

Ice is forming on the river
The barges are held in tow
Cold grey dawn, chilling to the bone

Must be ten below
Somehow you feel lost and alone out there
Feeling like you ought to leave
Such hard living in the cold cold world

People its time to believe
Sounds tear through the morning
You pull yourself from your bed
Try so hard to quiet your mind

Dodging thoughts of that lies dead ahead
A chance to be dashed on the rocks
Fooled by friendly lights
Shining solely to decieve

Such hard living in this cold cold world

Peter Rowan,"Casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walking down
The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below
Following their footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors
Of silent desperation, never speakin' to a soul
The poison air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dying
'Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain
But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
Of the clickin' of the turnstiles and the rattle of his chains

""Oh!"" she said, ""Casey it's been so long since I've seen you!""
""Here"" she said, ""just a kiss to make a body smile!""
""See"" she said, ""I've put on new stockings just to please you!""
""Lord!"" she said, ""Casey can you only stay a while?""

Casey leaves the under-ground and stops inside the Golden Crown
For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bone
Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
Who reach for any thing they can to keep from goin' home
Standin' in the corner Casey drinks his pint of bitter
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by
Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason
Is the beer that's in his belly, or the tear that's in his eye

""Oh!"" she said, ""I suppose you seldom think about me
""Now"" she said, ""now that you've a fam'ly of your own""
""Still"" she said, ""it's so blessed good to feel your body!""

Suzanne, don't you go on and cry
I said, oh, Susannah
Now, don't you cry for me

And singin' through the night
We watched the morning sun come up and not a raincloud in sight

I knew if I didn't make some weather and see them storm clouds gather
I'd be run out of town when the sun went down
Covered up in tar and feathers
I was on my knees and I raised my hands to the Heaven's high
I felt this rain like a sigh of relief come pourin' from the sky

I don't blame myself; I'm sure I can't blame you.
There was something had to happen, and it happened somehow.
I don't worry 'cause it makes no diff'rence now.

Let things happen as they will, and I'll get by somehow.

Letting in the sunshine and the rain
And the only friend I've got now is that good old dog of mine
And that little old log cabin in the lane

Oh the paths have all grown up that led around the hill
The fences have all gone to decay
And the creeks have all dried up where we used to go to mill
And things have changed their course another way

Peter Rowan,"It was midnight on the stormy deep
My solitary watch I'd keep
And think of her I'd left behind
And ask if she'd be true and kind

I never shall forget the day
That I was forced to go away
In silence there my head she'd rest
And pressed me to her loving breast

Oh Willy don't go back to sea
There's other girls as good as me
But none can love you true as I
Pray don't go where the bullets fly

The deep deep sea may us divide
And I may be some other's bride
But still my thoughts will sometime times stray
To thee when thou art far away

Memories that make my heart grow cold

And my blue moon again will turn to gold

When my blue moon turns to gold again
And the rainbow turns the clouds away
When my blue moon turns to gold again
You'll be back within my arms to stay

The castles we built of dreams together
Are the sweetest stories ever told
But in my dreams they live again, sweetheart
And my blue moon again will turn to gold

Blackberry blossom when the summertime came?
The blackberry blossom, oh the last time I saw one
Was down in the bramble where I rambled in the spring
The bramble was wild I was torn by the briars
My love he wooed me as I lie there
With a flower in my hair and my cheeks all flashy 
Was the blackberry blossom from the blackberry bush 

When I picked the berry I didn't miss the blossom 
The blackberry blossom was white as the snow 
But the berry that it brings is sweeter than molasses 
And black as the wings of the Arkansas crow 
The Arkansas crow is a devil and a demon 
Known for his cackling and his screaming 
Driving away the swallow and the thrush 
From the blackberry blossom and the blackberry bush  

I was picking berries when that crow flew above me 
Carrying my lover so far away 
Now each spring I lay a blackberry blossom 
By a cold gravestone on the Arkansas clay 
The Arkansas clay is rocky and hard 
With weeds growing over in the old graveyard 
And the day settles down to an evening hush  
Over the blackberry blossom and the blackberry bush",Blackberry Blossom,2002

He can't write his name or read a book
To fool the people is his only thought
And though he's slippery, he still gets caught

You may grow up to be a fish

A love like I ain't never felt before
She's like my destiny calling
And she's lying there all naked on the floor

And suddenly out of blue, she's singing

Oh baby, let my loving ease your pain
Bring your burning skin to my river once again
I'll give you life
Ooh baby let my loving ease your pain, tonight

Like an angel come from Heaven in the night

You get an even suntan on your back, and on your legs

Both touched with a burning ambition

Then go and forget me forever

The town is sound asleep
Like omens underneath the moon
The waves crash on the beach

The restless clouds are circling
Like birds of pray in flight
And nature lifts an angry hand
Posed and set to strike

And every man will know the power
That marked the planets birth
The hurricane, the hurricane
Returns us to the earth

No man made shelter strong enough
To stop the raging tide
The storm relentless in its quest
To conquer and divide

What has stood a hundred years
Awakens to the roar
As the waves come pounding down
Like hammers on the shore

And every man will know the power
That marked the planets birth
The hurricane, the hurricane
Returns us to the earth

The harbor lights have long gone out
Submerged beneath the waves
The moon attends the final rites
Above the ocean grave

While restless clouds still circle 'round
Like birds of prey in flight
Natures hand all quiet and still
Retreats before the light

The hurricane is over now
The storm has finally past
While on the sand a child walks
And kicks at bits of glass

A fair maid I did meet,
She asked me to see her home--
She lived in Bleecker Street.
Chorus:
And away you santy, my dear honey,
O you New York girls, can't you dance the polka?
And when we got to Bleecker Street,
We stopped at forty-four,
Her mother and her sister there,
To meet her at the door.
Chorus:
And when I got inside the house,
The drinks were passed around,
The liquor was so awful strong,
My head went round and round.
Chorus:
And then we had another drink,
Before we sat to eat,
The liquor was so awful strong,
I quickly fell asleep.
Chorus:

I had an aching head,
There was I, Jack all alone,
Stark naked in me bed.
Chorus:
My gold watch and my pocketbook
And lady friend were gone;
And there was I, Jack all alone,
Stark naked in the room.
Chorus:
On looking round this little room,
There's nothing I could see,
But a woman's shift and apron
That were no use to me.

With a flour barrel for a suit of clothes,
Down Cherry Street forlorn,
There Martin Churchill took me in,
And sent me 'round Cape Horn.

I went out, strolling round about.
A crowd of kiddies followed me and they began to shout,

I saw the mayor of London there. That's who I went to see.
He came along in a carriage and a pair.
I shouted, ""come on, boys! All throw your hats up in the air.""
Just then the mayor, he began to smile,
Pointed to my face and said, ""Lor Lummy, what a dial!""
Started Lord-a-mayoring, and then to my dismay,
He pointed to my watch and chain and shouted to me, ""Hey,

I shan't forget the day I married Miss Elisa Brown.

I arrived in a carriage called a hack,

Watching tv in the den
If I could bring you back
And talk about everything
If I could bring you back again.

I lost my faith in the world 
When you disappeared
Now I've finally found my feet again
And I wish 
You were here

And turn the radio off

I'd play you a little song

Back up in the woods, on top of a hill
There stood an old hut made of earth and wood
There lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode

But he could play his guitar like ringing a bell, yell

And said, ""Go, go Johnny, Johnny B. Goode tonight,"" yeah
And said, ""Go, go Johnny, Johnny B. Goode""

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Sitting in a tree in the railroad track
Old engineer in the train sitting in the shade
Strummin' with the rhythm that them drivers made

People passing by would stop and say
Oh my, oh my, what the boy can play

I said, ""Oh, go Johnny, Johnny B. Goode tonight,"" yeah
Said, ""Oh oh, go Johnny, Johnny B. Goode""

Mama said: Son, you gotta be a man (go out, be a man)
You gotta be the leader of a reggae band
People coming in from miles around
To hear you play until the sun goes down

Boy, someday, your name will be in the lights
Saying: Johnny, Johnny B. Goode tonight

I said, ""Oh, go Johnny, Johnny B. Goode tonight,"" yeah
Said, ""Oh oh, go Johnny, Johnny you better be good""

Peter Tosh,"Childhood part of my life, it wasn't very pretty.
You see, I was born and raised in the slums of the city,
It was a one room shack that slept ten other children besides me.
We hardly had enough food or room to sleep.
It was hard times,
Needed something to ease my troubled mind.
Listen!  my father didn't know the meaning of work,
He disrespected mama, and treated us like dirt.
I left home, seekin' a job that I never did find,
Depressed and downhearted I took to cloud nine,
I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.
Listen one more time I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.
Folks down there tell me,
They say, ""give yourself a chance son, don't let life pass you by"".
But the world of reality is a rat race where only the strongest survive,
It's a dog eat dog world, and that ain't no lie.
Listen!  it ain't even safe no more to walk the streets at night,
I'm doin' fine, on cloud nine.
Let me tell you about cloud nine.

Cloud nine, you can be what you wanna be
(cloud nine) you ain't got no responsibility,
And ev'ry man, ev'ry man is free
(cloud nine)  and you're a million miles from reality.
I wanna say I love the life I live,
And I'm gonna live the life I love up here on cloud nine.
I'm riding high
On cloud nine, you're as free as a bird in flight
(cloud nine)  there's no diff'rence between day and night
(cloud nine)  it's a world of love and harmony

Peter von Poehl,"A red line drawn upon the scene, indifference echoing through the screen. Blinded by profanity, it's a sin.

A gun shot is heard, but no-one sees. Using a veil for immunity. Deception used by numbers out of greed.

You believe that you can see, that the humans are not really free. A global 
conspiracy, the same as you and me.

it was clear as daylight that he was nowhere near his goal.

The fights are going down
The gypsy armies of the evening
Have lit their fires across
The nether side of town
They will not pass this way again
So here in the night
Leave your home it's time for running
Out of the light

I see the hosts of Mohammed coming
The Holy Sister bars her doors against the East
Her house has stood too long divided
The uninvited guests are breaking up the feast
She may not bid them leave again
So here in the night
Leave your home it's time for running
Out of the light

I see the hosts of Mohammed coming
I dreamed I stood like this before
And I'm sure the words that I heard then
Were much the same
It's just an old Greek tragedy they're acting here
Held over by popular acclaim

In a kingdom lost in time.
And in the forests of evening the archer is bending a bow,

And bent you to their will.
And the murmurous fade of the ancients and all that they had,
But the magic lingers round you still.

Peter White,"Before the phone hits the receiver
You're halfway to the door
The voice said 'get out while you can,
There's just 1O minutes, nothing more'

Time only for the essentials
Better gather them and run
The false name inside the passport,
The gold bars and the gun

And once again they've come out of the past
And though your mind is cool your heart is beating fast
You've been through it all before
Each time you wish a little more that you could ask

""What do you want from me?
What do you need from me?
There's no rest for the running man

From the sweeping northern plains
To the outcrops of the jungle
Bowed beneath the tropic rains

In the customs hall the officer
Takes you to one side
And his eyes reveal no feeling
As you hand over the bribe

And once again you've bought a little time
And once again you're fading out of sight
Still the fox is growing older
As he calls over his shoulder to the night:

""What do you want from me?
What do you need from me?
There's no rest for the running man
Why can't you let him be?""

One by one they've nailed the others
But you always got away
What it is that keeps you just that step ahead

No one can say
In one last raid the agents
Of the dawn break down the door
Of a house where you were standing

Maybe just an hour before
And still the thread continues to unwind
You take the hidden roads that only you can find
And should they come upon your tracks

There's just a question hanging back you left behind

Looks like they headed into stormy weather.

Don't know why you should feel
That there's something to learn
It's just a game that you play

Well the picture is changing
Now you're part of a crowd
They're laughing at something
And the music's loud
A girl comes towards you
You once used to know
You reach out your hand
But you're all alone, in those
Time passages
I know you're in there, you're just out of sight

Peter White,"On a morning from a Bogart movie
In a country where they turn back time
You go strolling through the crowd like Peter Lorre
Contemplating a crime
She comes out of the sun in a silk dress running
Like a watercolor in the rain
Don't bother asking for explanations
She'll just tell you that she came
In the year of the cat

She doesn't give you time for questions
As she locks up your arm in hers
And you follow 'till your sense of which direction
Completely disappears
By the blue tiled walls near the market stalls
There's a hidden door she leads you to
These days, she says, I feel my life
Just like a river running through
The year of the cat

While she looks at you so cooly
And her eyes shine like the moon in the sea
She comes in incense and patchouli
So you take her, to find what's waiting inside
The year of the cat

Well morning comes and you're still with her
And the bus and the tourists are gone
And you've thrown away your choice you've lost your ticket
So you have to stay on
But the drum-beat strains of the night remain
In the rhythm of the new-born day
You know sometime you're bound to leave her
But for now you're going to stay
In the year of the cat

Peter White,"You told the man in the Broadway Hotel
Nothing was stranger than being yourself
And he replied, with a tear in his eye
Love was a rollaway
Just a cajole away
Mist on a summer's day
Nothing was clear
Love was a smile away
Just a defile away
I sought it every way
No one came near.

You asked the man for a room with a view
Nothing was said as he stared at his shoe
Then he replied as he gave you the key
Love was a rollaway
Just an unfold away
That's all there is to say
No one came near.

Alone in your room you hide
As the night rolls by
In the street outside
And you feel over the words he said
Till they turn to rain all around your head

You're seeking a hideaway
Where the light of day
Doesn't touch your face
And a door sign keeps the world away
Behind the shades
Of your silent day.

You made your home in the Broadway Hotel
Room service came at the push of a bell
And the man said as he put down the tray
Love was a stealaway
Just a reveal away
I tried to find a way
Nothing was clear
Then as he turned away
You asked the man to stay
He was there all the day
No-one came near",Broadway Hotel,1992
Peter White,"With your photographs of Kitty Hawk
And the biplanes on your wall
You were always Amy Johnson
From the time that you were small
No schoolroom kept you grounded
While your thoughts could get away
You were taking off in Tiger Moths
Your wings against the brush-strokes of the day
Are you there
On the tarmac with the winter in your hair
By the empty hangar doors you stop and stare
Leave the oil-drums behind you, they won't care
Oh, are you there

Oh, you wrapped me up in a leather coat
And you took me for a ride
We were drifting with the tail-wind
When the runway came in sight
The clouds came up to gather us
And the cockpit turned to white
When I looked the sky was empty
I suppose you never saw the landing-lights
Are you there
In your jacket with the grease-stain and the tear
Caught up in the slipstream of dare
The compass roads will guide you anywhere
Oh, are you there

The sun comes up on Icarus as the night-birds sail away
And lights the maps and diagrams
That Leonardo makes
You can see Faith, Hope and Charity
As they bank above the fields
You can join the flying circus
You can touch the morning air against your wheels
Are you there
Do you have a thought for me that you can share
Oh I never thought you'd take me unawares
Just call me if you ever need repairs
Oh, are you there",Flying Sorcery,1992
Peter White,"In the east the wind is blowing the boats across the sea
And their sails will fill the morning and their cries ring out to me

Oh, the more it changes, the more it stays the same
And the hand just re-arranges the players in the game

Oh, I had a dream
It seemed I stood alone
And the veil of all the years
Goes sinking from my eyes like a stone

A king shall fall and put to death by the English parliament shall be
Fire and plague to London come in the year of six and twenties three
An emperor of France shall rise who will be born near Italy 
His rule cost his empire dear, Napoleon his name shall be

From Castile does Franco come and the Government driven out shall be 
An English king seeks divorce, and from his throne cast down is he
One named Hister shall become a captain of Greater Germanie
No law does this man observe and bloody his rise and fall shall be

In the new lands of America three brothers now shall come to power
Two alone are born to rule but all must die before their hour
Two great men yet brothers not make the north united stand
Its power be seen to grow, and fear possess the eastern lands

Three leagues from the gates of Rome a Pope named Pol is doomed to die
A great wall that divides a city at this time is cast aside
These are the signs I bring to you 
to show you when the time is nigh

Man, man, your time is sand, your ways are leaves upon the sea
I am the eyes of Nostradamus, all your ways are known to me

Peter White,"The fishing boats go out across the evening water
Smuggling guns and arms across the Spanish border
The wind whips up the waves so loud
The ghost moon sails among the clouds
Turns the rifles into silver on the border

On my wall the colours of the maps are running
From Africa the winds they talk of changes coming
The torches flare up in the night
The hand that sets the farms alight
Has spread the word to those who're waiting on the border

In the village where I grew up
Nothing seems the same
Still you never see the change from day to day
And no-one notices the customs slip away

Late last night the rain was knocking at my window
I moved across the darkened room and in the lampglow
I thought I saw down in the street
The spirit of the century
Telling us that we're all standing on the border

In the islands where I grew up
Nothing seems the same
It's just the patterns that remain
An empty shell
But there's a strangeness in the air you feel too well

The fishing boats go out across the evening water
Smuggling guns and arms across the Spanish border

Peter White,"Rainstorm, brainstorm, faces in the maelstrom
Huddle by the puddles in the shadows where the drains run
Hot dogs, wet clogs clicking up the sidewalk

show
Pin ball, sin hall, minds in free fall
Chocolate-colored ladies making eyes through the smoke-pall

I'm alone on your streets on a Friday evening
I've been here all of the day

I'm alone on your streets on a Friday evening

Disenchanted, downstream in the night
Soho hears the lies, the twisted cries, the lonely sighs
Till she seems lost in dreams
The sun goes down on a neon eon
Though you'd have a job explaining it to Richard Coeur de Lion

I just don't want to be a fool. (Don't want to be a fool.)
Said I don't want to be a fool ever again.

Whenever a fool's in love he doesn't know he's to blame.
He's caught in the game. It all ends up the same.
He doesn't feel the shame. He looks at love in a diff'rent way.
It breaks his heart ev'rytime they all turn out strange.

But he'll never change. He's never gonna change.
Next time around I'll tell myself it'll be better than before
I won't look back.

I've been passing time watching trains go by,
All of my life
Lying on the sand, watching seabirds fly
Wishing there would be
Someone waiting home for me

Somethings telling me it might be you
Its telling me it might be you
All of my life

Looking back as lovers go walking past
All of my life
Wondering how they met and what makes it last
If I found the place
Would I recognize the face?

Somethings telling me it might be you
Its telling me it might be you
All of my life

So many quiet walks to take
So many dreams to wake
And we've so much love to make
I think were gonna need some time
Maybe all we need is time
And its telling me it might be you
All of my life

I've been saving love songs and lullabies
And there's so much more
No ones ever heard before

Peter White,"I heard the bells on Christmas Day
Their old familiar carols play
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of Peace on earth, good will to men
I thought how as the day had come
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along the unbroken song
Of Peace on earth, good will to men
And in despair, I bowed my head
There is no peace on earth, I said
For hate is strong and mocks the song
Of Peace on earth, good will to men
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep
God is not dead, nor doth He sleep
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail
With Peace on earth, good will to men

The snow is falling and I'm feeling fine
I've got my stocking and the mistletoe
And Santa baby's on the radio

I've got my wreath, I've got my tree
Got Jimmy Stewart smiling at me
I've got my home baked apple pie
Feels good to be in tonight

And I, I can't wait for Christmas
No I, I can't wait for Christmas

The mood is right and the lights are low
I make my angels in the snow
I've got the star at the top of the tree
It's shining brightly down on me

The gifts are wrapped, the bows are tied
The Christmas lights, they shine outside
I know the time is drawing near
It's my favorite time of the year

And I, I can't wait for Christmas
No I, I can't wait for Christmas

Dearest the shadows 
I live with are numberless

If I thought of joining you?

Let them know that I'm glad to go

For in death I'm caressing you 
With the last breath of my soul 

I'll be blessing you

In a country where they turn back time
You go strolling through the crowd like Peter Lorre
Contemplating a crime
She comes out of the sun in a silk dress running
Like a watercolor in the rain
Don't bother asking for explanations
She'll just tell you that she came
In the year of the cat

She doesn't give you time for questions
As she locks up your arm in hers
And you follow 'till your sense of which direction
Completely disappears
By the blue tiled walls near the market stalls
There's a hidden door she leads you to
These days, she says, I feel my life
Just like a river running through
The year of the cat

While she looks at you so cooly
And her eyes shine like the moon in the sea
She comes in incense and patchouli
So you take her, to find what's waiting inside
The year of the cat

Well morning comes and you're still with her
And the bus and the tourists are gone
And you've thrown away your choice you've lost your ticket
So you have to stay on
But the drum-beat strains of the night remain
In the rhythm of the new-born day
You know sometime you're bound to leave her
But for now you're going to stay

And he slept with a mermaid one fine night
From this union there came three
A porpoise and a porgy and the other was me

Yo ho ho
The wind blows free
Oh for the life on the rolling sea

One day as I was a-trimmin' the glim
Humming a tune from the evening hymn
A voice from the starboard shouted, ""Ahoy""
And there was me mother a-sittin' on the buoy

Yo ho ho
The wind blows free
Oh for the life on the rolling sea

Oh what has become of me children three?
Me mother then she asked of me
One was exhibited as a talking fish
The other was served in a chafing dish

Yo ho ho

Oh for the life on the rolling sea

Then the phosphorus flashed in her seaweed hair
I looked again, but me mother wasn't there
But I heard her voice echoing back through the night
The devil take the keeper of the eddystone light

Yo ho ho
The wind blows free
Oh for the life on the rolling sea

Oh, the moral of the story you'll learn when you find
To leave God's creatures for what nature had in mind
For fishes are for cookin', mermaids are for tales
Seaweed is for sushi and protecting is for whales

Someone warm them from below 'til the rain comes tumbling down

Pullin' weeds and pickin' stones, we are made of dreams and bones
I feel the need to grow my own 'cause the time is close at hand

Peter Yarrow,"I've seen a thousand people kneel in silence
And I've seen them face the rifles with their songs
I always thought that we could end the killing
But now I live in fear that I was wrong

The killer and the cynic waltz together
Their eyes are turned into their skulls
They do not feel the bullets in the bodies
They do not hear the dolphins or the gulls

If we do these things in the greenwood,
What will happen in the dry?

If we don't stop there'll come a time when women
With barren wombs will bitterly rejoice
With breasts that dry and never fill with promise
Gladly they'll not suckle one more life

Is this then the whimper and the ending?
The impotence of people raised on fear,
A fear that blinds the sense of common oneness
Common love and life or death are here

If we do these things in the greenwood,
What will happen in the dry?

Will no one light the candle in the darkness
Will no one be my guide, not let me fall
I've lost the sense that tells me where the path is
I feel the chill of winter in my soul

There's no way I can say the words more plainly
There's no one left to point at anymore
It's you and me and we must make the choice now
And not destroy the life we're living for

What will happen in the dry?

To find where it flows to the sea.
I looked in the eyes of the cold and the hungry
And I saw I was looking at me.
I wanted to know if life had a purpose
And what it all means in the end.
In the silence I listened to voices inside me
And they told me again and again.

The is only one river. There is only one sea.
And it flows through you, and it flows through me.
There is only one people. We are one and the same.
We are all one spirit. We are all one name.
We are the father, mother, daughter and son.
From the dawn of creation, we are one.
We are one.

Every drop in the sea

Men whose names are great, I don't want to do that
I am not on earth to kill miserable mankind......

Messieurs qu'on nomme grand, je vous fais une lettre
Que vous lirez peut-Ã­tre si vous avez le temps
Je viens de recevoir mes papiers militaires
Pour aller Ã  la guerre avant mercredi soir
Messieurs qu'on nomme grand je ne veux pas la faire
Je ne suis pas sur terre pour tuer les pauvres gens
Il n'faut pas vous fÃ¢cher mais il faut que je vous dise
Les guerres sont des bÃ­tises le monde en a assez

Depuis que je suis nÃ© j'ai vu mourir des frÃ¨res
J'ai vu partir des pÃ¨res et les enfants pleurer
Les mÃ¨res ont trop souffert quand d'autres se gobergent
Et vivant Ã  leur aise malgrÃ© la boue de sang
Il why'a les prisoniers on a volÃ© leurs Ã¢mes
On a volÃ© leurs femmes et tout le cher passÃ©
Demain de bon matin je fermerai la porte
Au nez des annÃ©es mortes j'irai par les chemins

Je mendierai ma vie sur la terre et sur l'onde
Do vieux au nouveau monde et je dirai aux gens
Profitez de la vie eloignez la misÃ¨re
Les hommes sont tous des frÃ¨res gens de tous les pays
S'il faut verser le sang allez verser le vÃ´tre
Messieurs les bons apÃ´tres messieurs qu'on nomme grand
Si vous me poursuivez prÃ©venez vos gendarmes
Que je serai sans armes et qu'ils pourront tirer
Et qu'ils pourront tirer

I fell asleep for to take my rest
I dreamed a dream that made me sad
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had

With half damp eyes I stared to the room
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon
Where we together weathered many a storm
Laughin' and singin' 'til the early hours of the morn

By the old wooden stove where our hats were hung
Our words were told and our songs were sung
We longed for nothin' and were satisfied
Talkin' and a jokin' about the world outside

With haunted hearts through the heat and cold
We never thought we could get very old
We thought we could sit forever in fun
Though our chances really were a million to one

As easy it was to tell black from white
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right
Our choices were few and the thought never hit
That the road we traveled would ever shatter and split

How many a year has passed and gone
Many a gamble has been lost and won
And many a road taken by many a first friend
And each one of them I've never seen again

I wish, I wish, I wish in vain
That we could sit simply in that room once again
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that

While riding on a train goin' west
I fell asleep for to take my rest
I dreamed a dream that made me sad
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had

I need a home, but my boots keep goin' 
Healing and peace that a fire could provide. 
A place to unburden my brain of its sorrow; 
First things first when you get to the fire. 
A rich man eats when he wishes; a poor man whenever he can. 
I need a song, but the spring is for sowing 
A word to the wise that the earth must provide. 
A tune to untangle the riddle of growing; 
First things first when you get to the land. 
A rich man eats when he wishes; a poor man whenever he can. 
I need the moon, but the landlord needs money 
A field of wildflowers that the stars could provide. 
A bird for my shoulder to fly through the rainbow;

Close beside an open door;
Flung on her flimsy doorstep
Lies a corpse upon the floor.

In the ashes by the hearthstone;

Let its voice be soft and feelin'

Outside standing, a lonely boy-child
Cold and shivering in the night

On the street every window
Save but one was gleaming bright
And to this window walked the boy-child
Peeking in, saw candlelight

Through other windows he had looked at turkeys
And ducks and geese and cherry pies
But through this window saw a gray-haired lady
Table bare and tears in her eyes

Into his coat reached the boy-child
Knowing well there was little there
He took from his pocket his own Christmas dinner
A bit of cheese, some bread to share

His outstretched hands held the food
And they trembled, as the door it opened wide
Said he ""Would you share with me Christmas Dinner""
And gently she said, ""Come inside""

Some glasses to their last drop of wine
Said she ""Here's a toast to everyone's Christmas

Who sipped no sup and who craved no crumb
As he sighed for the love of a lady

He sipped no sup and he craved no crumb
As he sighed for the love of a lady

Who loved with a love life-long-o
It's a song of a merry maid pearly proud
Who loved a Lord and who laughed aloud

At the moan of the merry man moping mum
Whose soul was sad and his glance was glum
Who sipped no sup and who craved no crumb

And a doleful dirge ding-dong O

At the humble merry maid pearly proud

For it tells of a righted wrong-o
It's a song of the merry maid once so gay
Who turned on her heel and tripped away

From the peacock popinjay bravely born
Who turned up his noble nose with scorn
At the humble heart that he did not prize
So she begged on her knees with downcast eyes

For the love of the merry man moping mum
Whose soul was sad and his glance was glum
Who sipped no sup and who craved no crumb
As he sighed for the love of a lady

Hey-di, hey-di, misery me, lack-a-day-de

For he lived in the love of a lady

And why each one feels no different from the last
And you say that you are fearful for the future

Have abandoned us or we abandoned them
And you cast about and try to find new meaning
So that you can feel that closeness once again.

For everything that matters carry on.

When we all had to care or all was lost
But now you see believers turn to cynics
And you wonder was the struggle worth the cost
Then you see someone too young to know the difference
And a veil of isolation in their eyes
And inside you know you've got to leave them something
Or the hope for something better slowly dies.

"Peter, Paul and Mary","Chorus:
Music speaks louder than words
It's the only thing that the whole world listens to.
Music speaks louder than words,
When you sing, people understand.

Sometimes the love that you feel inside
Gets lost between your heart and your mind
And the words don't really say the things you wanted them to.
But then you feel in someone's song
What you'd been trying to say all along
And somehow with the magic of music the message comes through.

(chorus)

The longer I live the more I find that people seldom take the time
To really get to know a stranger and make him a friend.
But the power of a simple song can make everybody feel they belong.
Maybe singin' and playin' can bring us together again.
Singin' and playin' can bring us together again.

Solitude complete
The stillness clear
And close as heaven's door

The earth beats out its rhythm
In slow and perfect time
Counterpoint and harmonies
Life's melodies entwine

And we fight the battle here
Where there's time to fall in step
The secrets are still known here
But the secrets never kept

Wild places, somewhere
We can see the Father's hand
Wild places, somewhere
We can be alone with you
We need a promised land

Maybe we'll be wounded in the healing
It's to be broken to be sure
Can we embrace
This strange awakening together?

Is wisdom carved into creation?
The old relationships defined
As forbidding as her truth may be
We'll learn her ways with time

We'll learn to take it as it comes
We can't change faster than we can
Already we're a long way
From the children we began

Wild places, somewhere
We can see the Father's hand

We can be alone with you
We need a promised land

Wood smoke rising
Faces alive in the firelight
Forsaking the road
And making it home to be there tonight

The young making good what they found
In the wood, what they learned of a land
Putting dreams back together
Talking it through, reaching out for the hand

There's a moment caught suspended
Communion born between our eyes
Our vision clears
Its golden flight ascending

And we have seen what we have come for
And we will some day see again
But we have climbed into the mountains
So we must climb back down 'til then

But we'll take it as it is crazy
With love and disbelief
And the magic of your morning
The wilderness, the peace

"Peter, Paul and Mary","'Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care
In the hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there
The children were nestled all snug in their beds
While visions of sugar plums danced in their heads.
Mom in her kerchief and I in my cap
Had just settled down for a long winter's nap.
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter
I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter
Away to the window I flew with a flash
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash
The moon on the breast of the new fallen snow
Gave a luster of mid-day to objects below.
When what to my wondering eyes should appear
But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer
With a little old driver so lively and quick
Well I knew in a moment, it must be St. Nick
More rapid than eagles, his coursers they came
And he whistled and he shouted and he called them by name
""On Dasher, on Dancer, on Prancer and Vixen
On Comet, on Cupid, on Donner and Blitzen!
To the top of the porch, to the top of the wall
Now, dash away, dash away, dash away all!""
As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly
When they meet to an obstacle mount to the sky
So up to the rooftop the coursers they flew
With a sleigh full of toys and St. Nicholas too.
And then in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing, the pawing of each little hoof
As I drew in my head and was turning around
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound
He was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back
And he looked like a peddler just op'ning his pack
His eyes, how they twinkled, his dimples, how merry
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry
His droll little mouth was drawn up in a bow
And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow
The stump of a pipe, he held tight in his teeth
And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath
He had a broad face and a little round belly
That shook when laughed (ho, ho, ho, ho) like a bowl full of jelly (ho, ho, ho, ho)
He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf
And I laughed when I saw him in spite of myself
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread
He spoke not a word but went straight to his work
And filled all the stockings and turned with a jerk
And laying a finger to the side of his nose
And giving a nod up the chimney he rose
He sprang to his sleigh, and to his team gave a whistle
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle
But I heard him exclaim as he drove out of sight
""Merry Christmas to all and to all..goodnight
Goodnight.""",'Twas the Night Before Christmas,1988

Then up spoke baby Jesus, from out Mary's womb
""Bow down ye tallest tree that my mother might have some
Bow down ye tallest tree that my mother might have some""

"Peter, Paul and Mary","Saturday summers, when I was a kid
We'd run to the schoolyard and here's what we did
We'd pick out the captains and we'd choose up the teams
It was always a measure of my self esteem

'Cause the fastest, the strongest, played shortstop and first
The last ones they picked were the worst
I never needed to ask, it was sealed,
I just took up my place in right field.

Playing...

[Chorus]
Right field, it's easy, you know.
You can be awkward and you can be slow
That's why I'm here in right field
Just watching the dandelions grow

Playing right field can be lonely and dull
Little Leagues never have lefties that pull
I'd dream of the day they'd hit one my way
They never did, but still I would pray
That I'd make a fantastic catch on the run
And not lose the ball in the sun
And then I'd awake from this long reverie
And pray that the ball never came out to me
Here in...

[Chorus]

Off in the distance, the game's dragging on,
There's strikes on the batter, some runners are on.
I don't know the inning, I've forgotten the score.
The whole team is yelling and I don't know what for.

Then suddenly everyone's looking at me
My mind has been wandering; what could it be?
They point at the sky and I look up above
And a baseball falls into my glove!

Here in right field, it's important you know.
You gotta know how to catch, you gotta know how to throw,
That's why I'm here in right field, just watching the dandelions grow!",Right Field,1990

All the sushi bars were shuttered, dark cantinas too
And I stood there in the darkness,as an empty cab rolled by
Then all at once I heard the sound of yuppies in the sky

Then the herd came down Columbus, for as far as I could see
All the men were wearing Polo, and the women wore Esprit
Each yuppie had a walk-man and as each one passed me by
I saw their sad expressions and I heard their mournful cry

Chorus:
Condos for sale, condos to buy, yuppies in the sky

Each one was wearing running shoes upon the ghostly deck
And each one had a cotton sweater wrapped around the neck
They all held out their credit cards and tried in vain to buy
But not a store was open to the yuppies in the sky.

(Chorus)

(The yuppie-I-o)
I've seen them in commercials sailin' boats and playin' ball
Pourin' beer for one another cryin', ""Why not have it all?""
Now I saw the ghostly progress as the winds around me blew
Till I, I felt the urge to purchase a BMW

(Chorus)

All the salad bars were empty, all the Quiche Lorraine was gone
I heard the yuppies crying as they vanished in the dawn
Calling brand names to each other, as they faded from my view
They'll be networking forever down Columbus Avenue

To leave God's creatures for what nature had in mind

Late at night in the empty big top I'm 
All alone on the high wire
Look, he's working without a net this time
He's a real death-daffier
 
I'm the kid who always looked out the window
Failing tests in geography
But I've seen things far beyond just the schoolyard
Distant shores of exotic lands
They're the spires of the Turkish empire
It's six months since we made landfall
Riding love with the spice of India
Through Gibraltar, we're rich men all
 
I'm the kid who thought we'd someday be lovers
Always held out that time would tell
Time was talking, I guess I just wasn't listening
No surprise if you know me well
And as we're walking toward the train station
There's a whispering rainfall
'Cross the boulevard you slip your hand in mine
In the distance the train calls
 
I'm the kid who has this habit of dreaming
Sometimes gets me in trouble too
But the truth is I could no more stop dreaming
Than I could make them all come true
",The Kid,1995
"Peter, Paul and Mary","(
Lately I've been picking up strange vibrations
I hear my music now on oldies stations
""Put out a CD called ""the best of what I was""
My picture's on the cover and no one knows
Just when you think you've got the wisdom of the ages
Nobody seems to want to turn your pages
I used to think I was the cat's pajamas
Now I'm about as hip as Fernando Lamas
(cause I'm) Old enough
Old enough to be your father
Old enough
Old enough (and then some)
And now my kids are taking me to the shows
There's hip-hop, rap, grunge music I don't know
I like to think I'm still part of the crowd
But, how can they hear the lyrics
When the music is so loud?!
I dig rock and roll music
(I been saying that for a while)
But I wonder if you knew
That rhythm & blues begat the rock and roll style?
And just like that, way before rap,
Woody Guthrie spread the news
He told it straight, let us relate
This Talking Union Blues:
Well if you want higher wages, let me tell you what to do
You've got to talk to the workers in the shop with you
You got to build you a union, got to make it strong
But if you all stick together, boys, it won't be long
You get shorter hours, better working conditions
Vacations with pay, take the kids to the seashore
Well I remember I was seventeen
I was a Birmingham High School rock and roll king
The paper talked about how I'd strut my stuff
I'd like to read it, but my arms aren't long enough
I kinda like my new senior status
I don't even care what the latest fad is
My g-generation's rediscovered me
And now I'm on the cover of modern maturity",Old Enough (Ode to an Aging Rocker),1995
"Peter, Paul and Mary","(Maxwell AndersonKurt Weill)
When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game.
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old earth take a couple of twirls
And I'd ply her with tears instead of pearls
And as time came around, she came my way
As time came around, she came

But it's a long, long while from May to December
And the days grow short when you reach September.
The autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
And I haven't got the time for the waiting game.

Oh, the days dwindle down to precious few;
September, November.
And these few precious days I'll spend with you.
These precious days I'll spend with you.
",September Song,1995
"Peter, Paul and Mary","There's a little girl playing in the garden
She thinks that she's alone and no one sees
But the beauty of it all
As the daisy petals fall
Is the wish she's made that's whispered in the breeze
There's the wish in the breeze
[Chorus:]
Won't you take the chance
And let your tears start falling
And ignore the fearful warning of your mind
Let your heart for once do all the talking
And believe that you deserve for the sun to shine
Believe that you deserve for the sun to shine
There's an old woman sitting in the doorway
And she greets the people each one as they pass
Sometimes they hover 'round her for her wisdom
Sometimes so she'll remind them how to laugh
They know that she'll remind them how to laugh
[Chorus]
Now on a hill there stands a cross above a graveyard
And the simple word carved in it says ""forgive""
No war or killing anger can match the force it carries
It can heal the generations so that other ones can live
It can heal us, so we can live
[Chorus]
Now there's a moment between forward and retreating
When you're just not sure which path you ought to choose
Then the sun shines brightly on the golden meadow
And suddenly, you're not at all confused
Suddenly, you're not confused
That's when you take the chance
And let your tears start falling
And ignore the fearful warnings of your mind
And you let your heart for once do all the talking
And believe that you deserve for the sun to shine
You always did deserve for the sun to shine
I love you, and I want the sun to shine.",Take the Chance,1995
"Peter, Paul and Mary","Inch by inch, row by row, I'm gonna make this garden grow
All it takes is a rake and a hoe and a piece of fertile ground
Inch by inch, row by row, someone bless these seeds I sow
Someone warm them from below 'til the rain comes tumbling down

Pullin' weeds and pickin' stones, we are made of dreams and bones
I feel the need to grow my own 'cause the time is close at hand
Grain for grain, sun and rain, I'll find my way in nature's chain
I tune my body and my brain to the music of the land

Inch by inch, row by row, I'm gonna make this garden grow
All it takes is a rake and a hoe and a piece of fertile ground
Inch by inch, row by row, someone bless these seeds I sow
Someone warm them from below 'til the rain comes tumbling down

So plant your rows straight and long, temper them with prayer and song
Mother earth can keep you strong if you give her love and care
Now an old crow watching hungrily from his perch in yonder tree
In my garden I'm as free as that feathered thief up there

Inch by inch, row by row, I'm gonna make this garden grow
All it takes is a rake and a hoe and a piece of fertile ground
Inch by inch, row by row, someone bless these seeds I sow
Someone warm them from below 'til the rain comes tumbling

Someone warm them from below 'til the rain comes tumbling down

And then, oh lord, she gave me her hand.

Workin' hand in hand to make a good life.

They all had sweethearts knockin' at the door.

"Peter, Paul and Mary","When I was just a wee little lad
Full of health and joy
My father homeward came one night
And gave to me a toy

A wonder to behold it was
With many colors bright
And the moment I laid eyes on it
It became my heart's delight

It went ""Zip"" when it moved
And ""Bop"" when it stopped
And ""Whirrr"" when it stood still
I never knew just what it was and I guess I never will

The first time that I picked it up
I had a big surprise
'Cause right on the bottom were two big buttons
That looked like big green eyes

I first pushed one and then the other
Then I twisted its lid
And when I set it down again
Here is what it did

It went ""Zip"" when it moved
And ""Bop"" when it stopped
And ""Whirrr"" when it stood still
I never knew just what it was and I guess I never will

It first marched left and then marched right
Then marched under a chair
And when I looked where it had gone
It wasn't even there

I started to cry, but my daddy laughed
'Cause he knew that I would find
When I turned around my marvelous toy
Would be chugging from behind

""Zip"" when it moved
And ""Bop"" when it stopped
And ""Whirrr"" when it stood still
I never knew just what it was and I guess I never will

Whirr, whirr, whirr

The years have gone by too quickly it seems
I have my own little boy
And yesterday I gave to him
My marvelous little toy

His eyes nearly popped right out of his head
And he gave a squeal of glee
Neither one of us knows just what it is
But he loves it just like me

It still goes ""Zip"" when it moves
And ""Bop"" when it stops
And ""Whirrr"" when it standsstill
I never knew just what it was and I guess I never will

I've slept on the ground in the light of your moon
On the edge of your city you've seen us and then
We come with the dust and we go with the wind

Then north up to oregon to gather your hogs
Pull the beets from your ground, cut the grapes from your vine
To set on your table your light, sparkling wine

From the grand coulee dam where the water runs down
Every state in this union us migrants have been
We'll work in your fight and we'll fight til we win

Well it's always we ramble that river and I
All along your green valley I'll work til I die

Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet

One day she left without a word. She took away the sun.
And in the dark she left behind, I knew what she had done.
She'd left me for another, it's a common tale but true.

Where the bullfrog croaks and the hippopotamus
Moans and groans with a big to do

The melody with the high voice ringing
The hoot owl hollers over everything
And the jaybird disagrees

The ghetto's not a place, it don't matter what color you are
You can be white as chalk or as black as tar
And it really don't matter how much money you have
(You can live on Fifth Ave. and be ghetto fab)
You know you ghetto when your soap is the size of Chiclet
Run into the kitchen wet for dishwashin' liquid
The water cold cause they shut off all your power
(You know you ghetto if you pee in the shower)
No toilet paper, somebody used the last you had
No problem, just get a Daily News or a paper bag
Ball it up and crumble it, make it soft in your ass
(But when you flush, the toilet always gets stopped up)
And if you got the money, the landlord never get it
We never pay the rent, yo we almost got evicted
If this shit is funny or offendin' you
(Chances are, it's because you're ghetto too)

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Can you be rich and be ghetto [Repeat x3] 
And if you gotta ask then you'll probably never know 
Ghetto 
East Coast is the ghetto 
West Coast is the ghetto 
South Side is the ghetto 
Everywhere is the ghetto
The ghetto 
The ghetto 
The ghetto 
I'll probably die, in the ghetto",Ghetto,2000

This Petey Pablo
April the ninth, nineteen two thousand
Diary of a sinner, huh, 1st entry

Dear diary, this the 1st time
I had a chance to sit and just think with a clear mind
Has a homeboy stressed out for a little while, few things ain't work out
Could somebody come out or it's about three twenty-nine, I'll give it about another hour
I'm over here at your man house
On your man couch, just puttin' these thoughts down
Maybe this right here one day will be worth something
Before we start messin' up
You know you get big when you leave, it's a damn shame
But that's the way that it gotta be huh,
Look at Malcolm X, Martin Luther King
Marvin Gaye, Tupac, B-I-G and Big Pun damn this pen messy

[Chorus]
A motherfucker had thought
And I had to write em down
It's the diary, of a sinner
A motherfucker had thought
Then I had to write em down
Liven life as a born loser
Liven in a world that I didn't see oh

Damn, I'm back, I had to change pen, I done got ink everywhere
All over my hand, and on my pant and how in the hell I get it way down there
Just can't get it right
Seem that everything I do just fall on one side
But I can say one thing, I don't always get mine, and I don't ever stop tryin'
Feel like I was here before my time
People say when they hear my rhyme
People see it when they look in my eye it's like
Like thirty-five years on a twenty-six year life
I done walk so many miles in these shoes
I'm surprise that the bottom ain't wore out
I'm about to go take a walk right now

[Chorus]

It was good ta me, a little walk
Just what I needed, cool breeze, nobody on the street with me
My own little world of peace
But reality gotta be what it gotta be
And nuttin' in the book said, life will to be sweet
I'm pleased with the life that was given to me
I could of still been sleep
On my way so please when none this here will matter to me
'Cause, know when I messed up, several times
I just done something tonight
And I know I know right from wrong
And that's what kill me
I still do the wrong thing
Am I crazy, can't believe I got a damn diary

[Chorus]

Oh oh oh ooh
Livin' life, livin' life
Oh a diary, a diary oh
And it's written on paper oh
Can't you just see it
All of my life oh,
All of my life oh,
All of my life

All of, all of, all of
All of my life oh alright
Oh it's the diary of a sinner

There it is, my life
Right there, right in your face
The diary, I want to thank everybody that went out and picked up the album
Got the album, and got a chance to understand who, who I'm is
Know what I'm sayin', everything I gave y'all was the truth
Damn I ran out of time",Diary of a Sinner,2001
Petey Pablo,"[Intro]
Aiyyo check this verse out
My platinum chains, my big willy, my Mercedes-Benz
That's right? {*laughing*}

[Verse 1]
Are you a gun busting nigga? (Buh-Buh-Buh-Buh)
Are you a bitch baggin nigga? (Whu-Whu-Whu-Whu)
You got ice and ya chain and ya chong wit your Rolly on
Not just any Rolly but you bought the most expensive one.
Hey take ya car keys*Jingle Jingle* to ya class E
Big body be for your CD- I mean, DVD
For ya T.V in ya head beats, in ya back seat
Haha, y'all think I'm mean
Runnin round talking bout the shit that you be talking bout
How you the drug game sold up and locked down
John Gotti got life and I'm sure he never told nobody
Boy lets put on an album so the fuckin feds could buy it
You shouldn't be shouting out them bodies you buried
Nine millimeters and Techs and them AK47's
Illegal weapons you talking bout you snucked in the club
You got so many guns
Tell me why you rappers steady getting robbed
I got two more verses for you (huh)
this ain't just to an individual person
These questions here for all of ya

[Hook]
I can write a song without ice, bitches, and cars
can you mutha fuckas do dat? (DO DAT?!)
I can blaze a track without bustin a gat at a cat
can you mutha fuckas do dat? (DO DAT?!)

[Chorus 2x]
Yoouuu gon' have to change up all yo shit in a little bit
When the radios in the club get to pumpin this
And they start to finding out what what rappin really is

[Verse 2]
Verse 2, now that you know what the song's about
y'all probably cussin me out
You gonna listen to it anyhow
Lets talk about somebody like Eskimo
Rentin they jewelry from Jacob and don't think we know
You got a platinum piece but your chain is plain white gold
After the video it got to go back to the store
That's Crazy, talkin bout some shit you don't own
Oughta be ashamed of yourself
Yo, don't they call that frontin, holmes?
You ain't Jigga, Nigga
Nor can you spin like Puff
And got a cash money deal
So what's your Big Willy talk for?
I get so excited man, your track got me leapin
Then you start rhyming and *Yawn* I get sleepy

[Chorus]

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It's a sad situation, record labels buggin out
'cause they star artist done ran out of shit to talk about (Whoa!)
Yeah that's crazy and you think about it baby
Only thing that changed in yo rhyme was ya date ""2000""
Oh that shit is hot, put that on the album
You heard it with my man kick that shit (??)
Loud and proud, nigga swear he be throwin down
Arthur lose his voice every time he opens his mouth
I oughta hold up a signs and boycott they ass right
No more muthafuckin sound alikes!
Sound-a-like (Mobb Deep!) Sound-a-like (Jay-Z!) Sound-a-like (B.I.G.!)
And we don't need no more please!

man, I was sure I had Ms. Perfect
I was settling down
through fuckin' round
most the time I stayed at her house
spent all my time, with her when we stayed in the town
thought this shit right here was really bout to work out
quickly found out, that wasn't her intentions
shorty phone used to ring e're five seconds
ain't pay attention 
she would always take her calls in the kitchen
go to the sink, runnin' water like she washin' dishes
ain't tryin' a listen
I know how them shorties is
always in somebody business
gossipin', shootin' bullshit with her girlfriend
one day feelin like a joker 
told her I wasn't comin over
Jive got me on the last flight out to Arizona, what I told her
went over unexpected
rung the bell (ding dong!) Domino's (just a second!)
opened the door with the robe on
she only put on, when she naked as the day she was born
I'm just standin' there with crossed arms
then her baby car came out
lookin' at me like (""Nigga wha's wrong?!"")
Wha's wrong?!?

He use to have this book he carried around with him all the time
He use to call it a diary, He use to take it everwhere he went
One day he took it to church when we went to Sunday school
And the pastor asked him ""Boy, what's that you got in your hand""
And he said this is my diary
And the pastor told him that sinners couldn't have no diary (sinner)
My brother said he was lying, And my brother said if he couldn't have a diary
And he was a sinner, he would just call it a diary of a sinner (diary)

Petey Pablo," 

with no hopes 
and my will to live 
barely a care in this world to me
I found a way 
kidnapped and confined
within a system designed
to destroy the inncocent child that I use to be
it stripped me mentally naked
embarrassing my mommas first born
did I deserve that kind of fate?
Was all that was happening to me
really written in the powerful and allmighty book of life?
I don't think so
My tears would soak the pages that I write upon
if I couldn't close the windows to my soul
and stand strong in the midst of these storms
Maybe my story is
in some way or another fimilar with yours
is that why this ain't even a song 
but yet you still.. you want to here this once more
I play this everytime I want to reflect from 
which I've come from
to help me see were it is I'm trying to go
and even though grandma and our sisters
left me some time ago
I still go by and sit on the front porch as if I don't even know
but I'm getting better

my two sisters...ebony and tanya

and those that love me regardless

Land of the free, home of the brave, it's the land I love
I had to bring it up, ask Petey Brown If I could change it up
Now I really got the whole world raisin up, come on

Cause if we don't stand for somethin, we're bound to fall for anything at all
Here reporting live from the front lines
Sending lots of love and prayers out to everybody from every corner of the Earth

It won't until i was dead broke and about to go crazy 
Half a tank of gas, two cigerattes
scraping up change in an ashtray.
Had a voice said,
it's only a test of my faith.
It was only..............

    (Verse 1)

Damn,
this song for dat nigga south,
that I was tellin y'all bout.
y'all check dis nigga shit out
Remember the song i told you came on sound like,
how he was at a point on his own,
and the promblems seem to be takin a toll 
that he been fightin for so long.
Seemed like erthang he did went wrong,
But he found the strength to keep on goin.
And wrote  songs about it later on.
You know that shit hit me home,
especially when he would talk about the money he owed.
How he took the bills andhe  payed somethin on each one.
Like he put sometin on his light bill,
somethin on his phone.
He'll get a lil money,
and he'd pay a lil mo.
He ain't have a lot so he just payed what he could on it.
And somehow he just managed to keep all this stuff goin.
It won't nothin but the grace of the Lord,
'cause I remember 
I was............

    (Verse 2)

So it seemed ertime he got himself off the ground,
somethin'd come and knock him right back down.
Sometimes he wanted to just lay on out for the count,
fustrated and tired,
but he got on up anyhow.
And wit a smile I'm talkin bout.
Make you ask yourself ""How?""
And then 'cause just  broke it down for me he said....

(Singing and Pablo talkin in the background)
I ain't neva been dis happy in my life.
Ain't got a dime more then i had.
But everything seems alright.
And they say he ain't know...
Havin the joy of a piece of mind
is more than any problem i ever had at the time.
And now I know and I'm so glad.

It was only
a sign of the tide.
It was only
askin me why should i cry.
It was only
Singing be glad your alive today.
Only a test of my faith.

    (Pablo)

Man that boy can sing that song.
Play this shit ermorning,
just ta get my lil day goin.
You just don't know how this had touched my soul to find out i won't da only 
one that been through somethin.
Almost the exact same somethin,
was eatin me up.
Knew what it was, 
just could'nt put it in words.
I ain't neva been the type to really talk to nobody
so all the problems that i had,
I just kept em all inside.
y'all had enough of ya own
 to worry bout,
the lil situation i had goin on.
But you know God won't let you suffer too long.
I ain't even had da radio on,
I was out on the porche,
den Boom.
From the Heavens above,
just when I was at that point,
when I was just about to mess up,
Man Buda played this song fo me 'cause and i just shook my head like 
""uh uh uh""

Ya heard me

[Petey]
Since the tender age (since the tender age)
I been running wild (I been running wild)
I seen all those things (all those things)
You don't show to a child 
It wasn't love I was missing (lord knows)
My folks cared for me
I had a stubborn ass attitude (did what I want to do)
And y'all couldn't talk to me
Tried often the strait and narrow
But every time I would stumble and fall
Fell so hard one time I fucked around and stayed down
I don't want to try no more
I was getting a little older
Those mistakes were a part of my life
And my only regret is that I only get one chance to get it right

[Chorus]
And I want to tell the world the truth about me (2x)
(listen to the song...)

[Petey]
I caused more unnecessary stress to my mama than the word allow
Old sister of mine
I had once upon a time 
We ain't spoke in a while
Life's been hard on me 
But I found a way to keep standing it
And holding on (holding on)
Pressing on (good God almighty)
Standing in jail someday I'll break the monotony
Cause Petey wasn't doing that well
And I can behold a way that the world christened me
... If anybody give a damn to know
What really went on in my life I wrote a song

All inmates are asked to get on your assigned bunks and 
Remain there until count time is made....count time...

Man I was just one of the ones
That always wounded up in the midst of something
Stayed in trouble if I won't fuckin' up
I love ( I love) to bring the pain
Growing up in Greenville, North Carolina outside of Rocky Mount

just incase you were one of the ones who wanted to come and ask somethin stupid
(What you think you doin?) What it look like?
Puttin it down for my niggaz in the south side
North Carolina, South Carolina
And all my little bity overlooked hick towns
We gonna hit why'all asses, ain't nothin but a T.T. blast
that we got comin atcha, (beat) slammin, (first) classic
(Gold for this) What's after platinum?
(Baby you don't want the bomb) And I don't meant to scare ya
but I'm about to bring it home
Blow these valleys, these hills, these streams and N.C. outta the water
How's it feel to look a motherfucker dead in the grill
and tell 'em - ""I told ya!""

[Chorus]

[David Nevermind]
Uhh, af-after seeing this
I-I have no other questions, I, I mean I
Hey look, this is David Nevermind
I'm signing off, but before I'm outta here, remember
If I'm ever caught with anything I'm not supposed to have it's Nevermind
North Carolina and V.A. are definitely at the front of the line
You have my vote of support, over and out
