Demi Lovato,"I can make the rain stop if I wanna,
Just like my attitude
I can take my laptop record a snapshot
And change your point of view

I just entered this brand new world
And I'm so open hearted
I know I've got a long way to go but I
I'm I'm just getting started

I'm over my head, and I know it, I know it
I'm doing my best not to show it, to show it
Whatever it takes to be what I was meant to be, I'm going to try
'Cause I'm living the dream and I know it, I know it
I'm trying my best not to blow it, to blow it
And I know everything will be fine
With me, myself and time.

I go where life takes me,
But some days it makes me want to change my direction
Sometimes it gets lonely,
But I know that it's only a matter of my perception
I just entered this brand new world
And I'm so open hearted
I know I've got a long way to go but I'm
I'm just getting started

I'm over my head, and I know it, I know it
I'm doing my best not to show it, to show it
Whatever it takes to be what I was meant to be, I'm going to try
'Cause I'm living the dream and I know it, I know it
I'm trying my best not to blow it, to blow it
And I know everything will be fine
With me, myself and time.

And baby there is nothing like this moment
To just be real and let the truth be spoken
Whatever's broke I can make it unbroken
Turn the lead in my hand into something golden
Just try more love, if I try more love then I'll find
Myself and time.

I'm over my head, and I know it, I know it
I'm doing my best not to show it, to show it
Whatever it takes to be, what I was meant to be, I'm going to try

I'm over my head, and I know it, I know it
I'm doing my best not to show it, to show it
Whatever it takes to be, what I was meant to be, I'm going to try
'Cause I'm living the dream and I know it, I know it
I'm trying my best not to blow it, to blow it
And I know everything will be fine
With me, myself and time.

I'll find myself in time,
I know I'll find myself in time","Me, Myself and Time",
Demi Lovato,"La la da, ta da!

The mood is right, the spirit's up
We're here tonight and that's enough

Simply having a wonderful Christmas time

The party's on, the feeling's here
That only comes this time of year

They practiced all year long!

How do I know, he's mine?

Don't wanna be nowhere

But tonight
We'll leave it on the line

Never would've said forever
If we knew it ends so fast
Why did you say I love you
If you knew that it wouldn't last?

Baby, I just can't hear what you're saying

You mean the world to me even though you might be crazy,
And you said we wouldn't make it, but look how far we've come,
For so long my heart was breaking,
But now we're standing strong,
The things you say, made me fall harder each day.
Your a train wreck, but I wouldn't love you if you changed.

Yeah

I shook your hand and you pulled it right away,
Yeah,
You asked me to dance, instead I said no way.
Inside I was dying, to give it a try, you beg me so I stay.
I knew you were different from the way I caved;

Demi Lovato,"She was given the world
So much that she couldn't see
And she needed someone to show her,
Who she could be.
And she tried to survive
Wearing her heart on her sleeve
And I needed you to believe

You had your dreams, I had mine.
You had your fears, I was fine.
You showed me what I couldn't find,
When two different worlds collide.

She was scared of it all, watching from far away.
She was given a role, never knew just when to play.
And she tried to survive
Living her life on her own
Always afraid of the throne
You give me strength to find hope.

You had your dreams, I had mine.
You had your fears, I was fine.
You showed me what I couldn't find,
When two different worlds collide.

She was scared
Unprepared.
Lost in the dark.
Falling apart,
I can survive,
With you by my side.
We're gonna be alright.

Kiss me quick but make it last
So I can see how badly this will hurt me when you say goodbye

Keep it sweet
Keep it slow
Let the future pass but don't let go
But tonight I could fall too soon into this beautiful moonlight

But you're so hypnotizing
You've got me laughing while I sing
You've got me smiling in my sleep
And I can see this unraveling
Your love is where I'm falling
So please don't catch me

See this heart won't settle down
Like a child running scared from a clown
I'm terrified of what you do
My stomach screams just when I look at you

Run far away so I can breathe
Even though you're far from suffocating me
But I can't get my hopes too high
'Cause every hello ends with a goodbye

You're not worth the time that this is taking

I knew better than to let you break my heart
This soul you'll never see again, won't be showing scars

The truth is all that I can hear every time you lie

Every time you lie
Every time you lie

I woke up the next morning with a smile on my face
And a long list of gentlemen, happy to take your place
Less trashier, much classier then who you prove to be
How long's it gonna take before you see that she's no me, oh no

I knew better than to let you break my heart
This soul you'll never see again, won't be showing scars, oh no no

I won't be sleeping 'til morning breaks

Can't believe that I put up with all this pain

I would never fall again

The words that had me trapped inside your misery
But now I know
The reason why I couldn't breathe

Cause all I want is everything you're not
So go ahead and slam the door
Cause you can't shut me out
And no I don't, I don't care what you say
Cause all I really, all I really want
Is everything you're not

Everything you're not not not

Your darkness was my weakness but it turns out
That it only went so deep
A meaningless diversion that is all that you
Ever meant to me

And I am done with your twisted symphony
The words that had me sound like stolen poetry
I tore the pages and I can finally breathe

Cause all I want is everything you're not
So go ahead and slam the door
Cause you can't shut me out
And no I don't, I don't care what you say
Cause all I really, all I really want
Is everything you're not

I want a gentleman who treats me like a queen
I need respect, I need love
Nothing in between

I will not spell it out for you if you can't see
Cause you're not worthy, you don't deserve me

A separation coming on

Just prove that there is nothing left to try

Please remember, remember December
We were so in love back then
Are you listening
To what they say?
Don't go that way
Remember, remember, December
Please remember

Don't surrender

You said, you wouldn't let them change your mind
'Cause when we're together fire melts the ice
Our hearts are both on overdrive
Come with me let's run tonight
Don't let
These memories be left behind

Don't surrender, surrender, surrender
Please remember, remember December
We were so in love back then
Are you listening
To what they say?
Don't go that way
Remember, remember, December
Please remember

I remember, us together
With the promise, of forever
We can do this
Fight the pressure
Please remember December

Don't surrender

Don't surrender, surrender, surrender
Please remember, remember December
We were so in love back then
Are you listening
To what they say?
Don't go that way

Demi Lovato,"Summer came and took me by surprise
California sunshine in my eyes
Driving with the top down
We sing along
To our favorite song
Nothing could go wrong

Laughing as we gazed under the moon
You kissed me and it never felt too soon
Hard to believe that anything
Could tear us apart
I won't let you break my heart

Now I know who you are
You got nothin' on me
I see I should have known it from the start
You cant tell me lies don't even try
Cause this is goodbye

Goodbye

Caught you from the corner of my eye
You smiled at a girl while passing by
Thought you had me fooled but you were wrong
I know what's going on
And it didn't take me long

It wasn't hard to read between the lines
The necklace in your car that wasn't mine
Nothing left for you to do or say
Now I'm on my way
Now it's too late

Now I know who you are
You got nothin' on me
I see I should have known it from the start
You cant tell me lies don't even try
Cause this is goodbye

Say goodbye to broken promises
Time to face your carelessness
Don't bore me with apologies
And come crawling back on your knees

You got nothin' on me
You got nothin' on me
You got nothin' on me

I know who you are
Now I see I should have known it from the start

You cant tell me lies, don't even try

Chances that you're burning through.

I've got a paper and pen
I go to write a goodbye

And oh It's been too hard to say
We're falling off the edge again

You know you can paint it anyway you want it

You can make it anything that you want it to be
If you follow your heart, life is a work of art

You're never too young or too old to dream
You can make your fantasy into a reality
Cause you're creating your own masterpiece
Close your eyes and dream it, seeing is believing

Why are we acting like lovers?
We don't know each other

Why are you singing me love songs?

'Cause I don’t wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I’d have a heart attack

Never put my love out on the line
Never said yes to the right guy
Never had trouble getting what I want
But when it comes to you, I’m never good enough
When I don’t care, I can play 'em like a Ken doll
Won’t wash my hair, then make 'em bounce like a basketball

But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear high heels, yes you
Make me so nervous, that I just can’t hold your hand

You make me glow,
But I cover up, won’t let it show,
So I’m puttin’ my defenses up
'Cause I don’t wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I’d have a heart attack
I think I’d have a heart attack

Never break a sweat for the other guys

And every time I try to be myself
It comes out wrong like a cry for help
It’s just not fair
Pain’s more trouble than love is worth
I gasp for air
It feels so good, but you know it hurts

But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear perfume, for you,
Make me so nervous, that I just can’t hold your hand

If I ever did that, I think I’d have a heart attack
I think I’d have a heart attack
I think I’d have a heart attack

The feelings got lost in my lungs
They’re burning, I’d rather be numb
And there’s no one else to blame
So scared I take off and I run
I’m flying too close to the sun
And I burst into flames

You make me glow,
But I cover up, won’t let it show,

Flame so bright make the daylight look dark

You'll never catch a bloom without seeds

You know family matters what'as Carl without Harriot?
Inseparable like Mary Kate and Ashley?
Incredible, I'm ready if you ask me
To ride on them feminine chicks, you feel me?

Waiting for the moon to rise

Just hold me, I'm lonely

And daddy, please forgive me for the drinks spilled on the floor
To the ones who never left me
We've been down this road before
I'm so sorry, I'm not sober anymore

I'm sorry to my future love
For the man that left my bed
For making love the way I saved for you inside my head
And I'm sorry for the fans I lost
Who watched me fall again

Beloved replied: I have died to myself and I live for you.

Come settle with me, let us be neighbours to the stars. 
You have been hiding so long, endlessly drifting in the sea of my love. 
Even so, you have always been connected to me. 
Concealed, revealed, in the unknown, in the un-manifest.

Each name reminds me of a smile,
A part of me I left behind,
The times I said goodbye,
The way love always dies,
But then again, I loved so many times.

Each name reminds me of a song,
The nights that fell apart at dawn,
When I had more to give than just a life to live,
But then again, I've had my share and even more.

The sound of every first hello,
The words I didn't know,
I learned with time the rhymes to every line.
And when I think of all the names,
The tender games I played,
I wonder if they still remember mine.

Each name reminds me of the past,
The memories that didn't last,
The one that counted more 
than all I had before,
That went away one day to let me love again.

I’ll sail off the rocks 
Which are trying 
To whisk us on locks of the dyin’

I’ll carve down the words
Of our love",My Blue Ship's A-Sailin',1974

Rebecca, breathe me the old song,
It makes me feel right in a world so wrong. 
Rebecca, breathe me the old land, 
With pentecost cakes in our hand. 
Rebecca, help me to your star, 
It shines right away, where ever you are. 
Rebecca, let your mind no more, 
Run over stars shaking your door.

We would play at separate yards, 
And then deep in the same haze, 
We met up with faceless guards.

He spoke of love and mostly of justice
And never even pointed to blame

the secret wish that we tenderly share,

echoes of words that you say when we're near.

begins a bright new day.

a love fulfilled by the old wishing well,

Shadows of a thousand faces keep on turning in your mind,
Forgotten names and places never really left behind.
Is it here imagination seeking shelter from the rain,
or a long self conversation once again.

Shadows never point a finger at the things you say or do,
silently they seem to linger anywhere you may run to.
Sharing every joy or torment, every laughter or despair,
facing you at any moment if you dare.

Gentle hearts that once surrendered what you didn't understand,
conquest of the night that ended holding you with trembling hands.
In a book a fall leaf-clover marks the day you said hello,
till she found that it was over long ago.
Little things have lost their meaning leaving only emptiness,
tender words and simple feelings never eased your hungriness.
Yesterdays remain so certain and tomorrow’s round the bend,
can you read the line that darkens on your hand.

Both ends of a candle burning shine so brightly for a while,
wrinkles of a life reflecting in your smile.

Shadows never point a finger at the things you say or do,
silently they seem to linger anywhere you may run to.
Sharing every joy or torment, every laughter or despair,
facing you at any moment if you dare.",Shadows,1988

If I tried to explain
I’d be trying in vain this I know
Need I love very far
To find my lucky star 
Shining brightly up above
‘cause when I look into your eyes
I know I’m gonna fall in love

Must you try and resist
Shall I have to insist for a moment
‘cause I know very well
There’s a sweet magic spell in the air
Something tells me that you
Feel the same way I do
And I know I can’t be wrong
‘cause when I look into your eyes 
I know I’m gonna fall in love 

You came into my heart
And I know from the you were sunshine

I know I’m gonna fall in love",I'm Gonna Fall in Love,1995

Querré que estés allí
Sé que tanto amor
Me ayudará a descender
Al más allá

Sin miedo why sin dolor

Reviviré los años de felicidad

Para cruzar el umbral
No deseo nada más

Acariciado por tu voz
Morir al lado de mi amor
Me dormiré mirándote El tiempo que pasó
Jamás nos separó
El nos unirá
En un rincón profundo de la eternidad

A la hora del final
Solo quiero tu mirar
Con tu perfume alrededor

With words so true, your coloured blue the clear sky of tomorrow
I touched your hand once again you gently sayYou need me
You’re more than spring, my love you bring is laughter everyday

only because you are near

For what you say 
in your way 
can fill my heart with sunshine
Somehow i know

and that you'll always be mine
The morning new 
can talk to you
When you awake each morning
The friendly wind 
will stop and sing

Someday, Somewhere
You said hello and walked into my life
Painted all my words in blue
Made my life a dream come true
Someday, Somewhere
I held your hand and suddenly I knew
That your love
Could show the way
To my rainbow's end


You gave my heart eternity 
Chained my wild imaginings
Time for us was sunshine never ending
Each morning was a symphony
Simple words and harmony
And you were all my eyes could wish to see

Someday, Somewhere
You said hello and walked into my life
all so unexpectedly
all so very tenderly
I held your hand and suddenly I knew
That your love 
Could show the way
To my rainbow's end

You gave my heart a song to sing
Chained my wild imaginings
Time for us was sunshine never ending
Each morning was a melody
Simple words and harmony
And you were all my eyes could wish to see

Someday, Somewhere
Our song went by and left us standing there

Demis Roussos,"You ask me if I love you
And I choke on my reply,
I'd rather hurt you honestly
Than mislead you with a lie.

For who am I to judge you,
In what you say or do,
I'm only just beginning
To see the real you.

And sometimes when we touch,
The honesty's too much,
And I have to close my eyes and hide.
I want to hold you till I die,
Till we both break down and cry.
I want to hold you till the fear in me subsides.

Romance with honest strategy
Leaves me battling with my pride,
But through the insecurity
Some tenderness survives.
I'm just another writer,
Still trapped within my truth,
A hesitant prize-fighter,
Still trapped within my youth.

And sometimes when we touch,
The honesty's too much,
And I have to close my eyes and hide.
I want to hold you till I die,
Till we both break down and cry.
I want to hold you till the fear in me subsides.
	
At times I'd like to break you,
And drive you to your knees.
At times I'd like to break through,
And hold you endlessly.
	
At times I understand you,
And I know how hard you try.
I've watched while love commands you,
I've watched love pass you by.
At times I think we're drifters,
Still searching for a friend,
A brother or a sister
But then the passion flares again.

And sometimes when we touch,
The honesty's too much,
And I have to close my eyes and hide.
I want to hold you till I die,
Till we both break down and cry.

Bottle of milk on the shelf
She’s gone I feed the dog myself
I do the cookin’ and pick up the wood
Our watchdog barks clear and cold
For the old man’s getting old
He thinks you will show up any day now

You see now that good days have gone
Good days have gone I’m alone
You see now that good days have gone
Good days have gone I’m alone

That’s what he said pointing at me
I’m just a no good son of farm
Ain’t a man hip and tidy

CHORUS",Good Days Have Gone,1999
Demis Roussos,"MIDNIGHT IS THE TIME I NEED YOU




I’ve been trough every kind of night
But I could never find
Someone that could understand
The way to pacify my mind
I’m afraid of darkness and I just get through the day
I know I can take it better if you tell me you will stay
I could find the words I never really said before
‘cause you’ve got the love I need and this time I know for sure

Midnight is the time/ Oh I need you baby

More than words can say/ Come on baby just feel it now

Midnight is the time/ The time I wanna feel you

Till the break of day /Come on come on come on baby

Take me through the night with you I know I can be strong
If you stay beside the girl I know that nothing can go wrong
All I need is you when silence crawls upon the walls
When the sun just dies away and shadows catch me as they fall
You can touch my soul with every tender word you say
Girl I know that only you could chase my lonely fears away


Midnight is the time/ Oh I need you baby

More than words can say/ Come on baby just feel it now

Midnight is the time/ The time I wanna feel you

Till the break of day /Come on come on come on baby


Instrumental solo

Midnight is the time/ yes, that’s the time I need you baby

More than words can say/ I’m feeling all right

Midnight is the time/ That’s the only time I need you

Turned to trouble

And everybody's ill yea illegal
People steal cars we steal people
We eat like dogs but we're still people
And even when your lost trouble still see you
And even if your dead broke we are still equal

And just the other day my nigga Chris killed himself
I pray to god that I never feel the way he felt
Where do we go when theres no help
He figured heaven so he went left
Ya'll know that ain't right
Plus he was high as a plane on that same night
Shit I probably been on that same flight
Shit I probably had that same fight
I just kept swinging
Twelve rounds come and bells ringing
(i run to trouble, trouble)
Introduced to the game when I was just a child
Mama know the drug dealers straight quit her job
He took his life and along with him I died
And she died
We died...
Then came my daughter to my bedside
Told me, ""daddy, don't cry, I'm alive""
I look her in the eyes and see me with no sins
But this is how the note ends

I have walked a bitter line
Chosen second over the 1
Still I look for better times
I run with trouble, trouble...

Just kicking back

I am carter

And everyone is going to turn their backs.
I want to take them down,
And strike them down and leave them struck down.
Its like I'm made to fail with everything I gain.
Just an infected piece in a defective game.

If nothing ever changes, I'm breaking down, giving up.
Burn it out, let it go, break it all, lose control,
Force it out, bring it through, pass it down, make it new.

I see all my pieces catch ablaze

And with every step the walls give way
And in the shadow of deceit I can see you fade
I've seen all those dreams we try to hide
And the sound of honesty's reply
But I'm not that man you've seen inside

I know what lies beyond this life for me is already won
No one can take away the blood that covers over my fall
Without the blood of perfect life I know I'm nothing at all
So now I reign forever hallowed in eternity's hand
No man can shake me from the everlasting ground that I stand
When this season ends

One final heart-break
And blinding lights will guide our way
Free us our blind state
They will call us by our name
Undying

We are the ones who will still remain when all is laid to waste
We are the ones who, when angels cry, will see them face to face
We are the ones
When this season ends

One final heart-break
And blinding lights will guide our way
Free us our blind state
They will call us by our name

Demon Hunter,"If you see me losing ground
Don't be afraid to lie
I know the pain inside my heart
Can't break the fear inside of yours
And if you see me losing faith in what it means to die
Don't let me leave before I know what lies beyond the stained-glass doors

Save sorrow for the souls in doubt
Bleed every care out

Will you carry me down the aisle that final day
With your tears and bones shaking from the weight?
When you lower me down beneath that sky of grey
Let the rain fall down and wash away your pain

For every word we never spoke,
We have a tear to cry
For every silence's like a wall between a better you and I
So if you see me losing sight of all the death and life
Find the peace in every time I fail to see the death in mine

Let all the fear inside you drown
Tear out the blade that let you down
Save sorrow for the souls in doubt
Bleed every care out

Will you carry me down the aisle that final day
With your tears and bones shaking from the weight?
When you lower me down beneath that sky of grey
Let the rain fall down and wash away your pain

Oh all the blood is rushing out
Oh I'm better off without
Oh the walls are closing in
Oh sing for me again

Will you carry me down the aisle that final day
With your tears and bones shaking from the weight?
When you lower me down beneath that sky of grey
Let the rain fall down and wash away your pain

Losing the will to resume this hell
When every breath is a dying wish

Is deep in the sorrow that I have sewn
And I can't erase what is in my heart
I wanted to finish before it starts

My own solution insufficient again
No false illusion, this devouring threat
I break the vessel, giving air to its red

And open my fate to the darkened sky

I've been fading away
I've been waiting on a call to reach my veins
Ready or not
No attention to waist
Every sorrow of the soul will reap my name
When I cease to exist

So, now I've come to a final sleep
I pray that forgiveness is mine to keep
I know it's hard to forgive this man
Driving the failure into your hands

Every careless shallow breath, corruption of our minds

The weight of a wicked world embodied on a thankless, crucifix
Embodied on a blood soaked, crucifix, crucifix

The sacrament is broken, and all I see is red
The idols of humanity they tower overhead
Now weep for the life that you've lead
The gates have severed open, setting death upon this place
Compelling us to hope in a revolting human race
Now pay for the hell that you praise

Still chasing me

And it won't let me out
A treacherous leaf
And a secret unsealed
It will cause deadly wounds

Roam to the ghostly realms at nights
To cleanse the dark shades of my night
Leave the mortal world behind
Float to the endless streams of time
An eternal ray of light
Leave my mortal shape behind

Que si alguna vez
Sentiste algo lindo por mi
Perdoname, Perdoname

Que si alguna vez
Sentiste algo lindo por mi
Perdoname, Perdoname bebe

Como quieres que te perdone
Si te fuiste de mi lado
Sin dejarme ninguna explicacion
No te importo si yo comia, o sufria
O se partia en dos mi corazon
Ahora me vienes a confesar

Que estas arepentido
Que hay mucha herida
Que sanar y enti ya no confio
Yo pense que solamente tu eras mio
Ya te lo di todo malagresido

Come back to me, miss, I'm sorry
Si tu no estas conmigo, mami, I am lonely
Cuando estamos en la camita
Baby, we are burning, te lo hago toda la noche
Tambien in the morning

Okay, tu dices que no siento amor
Ven y tocame siente como late el corazon
Te pido perdon por lo que paso
Baby, tenme compasion

y si alguna vez
Sentiste algo lindo por mi
Perdoname, Perdoname

Si alguna vez
Sentiste algo lindo por mi
Perdoname, Perdoname bebe

Voy a darte una segunda oportunidad
Quiero confesarte que yo nunca deje de amar
De mi parte deseguro no te voy a fallar
No te pagare con la misma moneda yo si se amarte
Vamos a darnos lo mucho amor

Quiero vivir en la felicidad
Pero sin temor que tu nuca me vallas a dejar
Yo te amo tu me amas y eso toda la realidad
Vamos a prender esta llama
Vamos a amarnos de verdad

Demrick,"[Chorus]
I'm sorry I met you
I'm sorry I hurt you
I'm sorry I killed you
I'm sorry I murked you
Because I'm all alone now nobody is with me
Nobody to threaten that they about come get me
I wish I could go back to where we began
I wish you was alive so I could kill you again
I wish we had more paths to cross
Nobody even cares if they survive my loss
My killer's remorse

For me we are the same should be laughed at
Could be the very fame shit to get your bitch ass clacked
You fell slick next now drowning in your own pool out back
I kick the cats and dog tube the shit I don't count that
You're my angel of death I strangle till there's no breath
I kill the kill kill till there ain't nobody left
My conscience don't inhibit me I kill deliberately
Just wanna be like God, cause God kills indiscriminately
I'm so christian I'm so muslim
Super size on your mom trigger get push up
I'm parallel to hell I'm ready so Satan what's cooking
And rappers running their mouth they don't know how close their bitch ass is coked
To get turned in ghosts nigga I will kill you
Don't get it cross memories fade just as blood washes off
I said memories fade just as blood washes off
Hope to see you soon

[Chorus]

I feel so guilty my hands are filthy
From decorating your face all over the building
I'm staying sincere if I ain't making it clear
I'm writing on the wall with the blood man I wished you were here
But you moved on at your funeral I beat you with slam
I hugged your mom tell your sister and her kids to be clam
I will tell 'em you gone you just sleep in a dream and all c'est la vie
We smoked you like the weed in the bong

Have you ever seen the bloodstain
And know that person has returned from every once came
Regret is such an ugly thing only if you let it fuck with your brain
But it ain't gonna change a fucking thing
What's done is done chop that shit up to the game
You're still dead when I'm still alive
And I never got the chance to utilize my best alibi

[Chorus]

Started the bullshit escalated to violence
In result of the violence infinite permanent silence
Now I feel empty not even existing
My worst enemy is no longer against me
I remember the hatred and how it consumed me
And you felt the same thing but never could move me
A shot to the face is nothing like in the movies
The back of your brain is out the body keeps moving
So I should rejoice now because you are past tense
The last of my enemies the last of you bastards
The dirt on your casket
I'm so alone now you were the reason to carry my danger my chrome out
And I just sold out and wait for the contact
And life for the combat and now we be on that
And I'd take it all back if I knew what I knew now
What's a shooter without somebody to shoot down

[Chorus]",Killer's Remorse,2012
Demrick,"Maybe it's time I change religions on you turning Christians
To a Muslim, turn a Buddhist to a Christian
Tell 'em catholic Ronnie been it
Sipping red wine inside the pentagon
Writing sinister lines till all the ink inside my pen is gone
Jeremy Lin got the world watching ESPN
My sick porno obsession got me watching these lesbians
Explain I'm a sick fucking psychotic master
The mic is my sword the booth is your casket
I'm sitting inside the classic 6 4 with the ratchet
Throwing up west side is my worst fucking habit
Only snap backs and egos eyes looking through peep holes
Is why I don't trust no one except God and Tim Tebow
Living my destiny poppin' pills high as fuck
Fucking bitches in the club holding my space bottle up
I think it's time you salute me or shoot me
Either way I'm the star of this motherfucking booth

They say I got a suicidal tendency murdering my enemies verse
It ain't no questioning thunder under my shirt
Fuck around and you'll be up under the dirt
This automatic will turn your home into a hearse
Worse case scenario pipe bound your burial
They gonna have to bury your twice
The scary cat on this night life
The golf stream vibing what the weed is top flight
My PO already know I'm a motherfucking flight risk
Heavy chain light risk pay cash for everything that white bitch
She got it, she got it, that's my words the oriental
Sixty two minutes they got it looking like murder all
I'm leaning hard in that flat back turbo charge
Coupe on twenty fours pedal to the floor
Hundred shots of that nigga still got plenty more
Slim the mobster am I is really made Uzi
We turn your block to a motherfucking movie

Lights, cameras, action niggas ready to shoot you
But these ain't lights ain't cameras pointed at you
Blocked off the scene cause your scenes don't move me
Will turn your block into a motherfucking movie

Rap boy we were kids we were the Lord of the Rings
Rep in the full train smoke in solely green
I know other case burst scenes there's no more men of honor
I might made my super armor running from karma
The good die young no country for old men
There will be blood deeper than leviathan
And my platoon full of bad lieutenants
X-men, expendables, bad company, criminals
Crush goons with a kanga, surfing in the rainbow
48 hours to kill Bill, Cash and Tango
Brave heart, battleship, devil's out to kill with the
Passion of Christ, it's a wonderful life
Miami Vice what to get right
It's midnight in the garden the good and evil are crashing
Ordinary people, lethal weapon without 4 sequels
Above the hunger games
The gods must be crazy ricochet through the purple ring
Because the devil wears prada
The dead presidents can turn a goodfella to a godfather
Animal house, standing to live with the case speech
Leonardo DiCaprio on the beach
Oceans Eleven, if all dogs go to heaven
The silence of the lambs, son of sam 7, I am legend
Fuck this new jack city I'm on the midnight express
With this American History X

Off the dome and I'm talking slick as petroleum
Because I don't fuck with pens unless I'm rolling on some eulogium
Niggas preaching hate from Napoleon nigga slowly throwing salt on my game
Like fluorine or sodium on a door
But holy I'm only in it for the cash part
Thinking fuck the world something like a pornstar with a passport
With officer walking and my side mirror in
He don't like me cause I'm dark as an nigerian
Rocking alot of juries smart as a librarian
In the look in the american eyes said I'd bury him
I said it before don't ignore it again too
Hands on the 9 like you couldn't attend due
Life's a hooker the hall raised me
This poor baby was born crazy
Put in the middle of drug wars
Thug lord and judges tryin' to call case me
Lord save me it's gone Swayze the movie

Lights, cameras, action niggas ready to shoot you
But these ain't lights ain't cameras pointed at you
Blocked off the scene cause your scenes don't move me

Demrick,"I spit ferocious fireballs, the kids are all excited
I pour petroleum on your linoleum and light it
On a podium, I'm causing pandemonium
Sodium and nitrate, second greatest rapper in the white race
Might've been the spider venom, might've been the snake bite
Fuck with me and find out what a metal pipe will taste like
I'm explosive like a molotov cocktail
Lyrics get around the kids quick like fuckin' hotmail
Involuntarily, solitary confinement
I've no one to confide in, quiet in my environment
Mentally, I'm way off balance and off kilter
Brains, we ought to wack, that's why I rap without a filter
Perverted matador, I tackle bulls and try to mount 'em
So many personalities, don't bother trying to count 'em
My life is a crazy rollercoaster, call me magic mountain
I'm throwing boulders, they're exploding, mouth's a fuckin' fountain

I'm mental
That's just the way that it goes, dog
Canadian but you could keep the rain and the snowballs
I love palm trees, sitting in the sunshine
Learning quick, my rhymes, they are ridiculously sublime
Stupid shit, but the way that I combine
My wordplay, smartest rapper out with a dumb mind
Sometimes I kind of miss the clouds and the rain
'Cause that's what helped me get the blues, madchild is proudly insane

I went from backpack, to snapbacks, to lab rats on acid
Spit anthrax, the band's back, this man's raps are massive
Completely gone bananas, whipping up within bonanza
Short like Dan Devito, still the boss like Tony Danza
Now stick your damn hands up, this here is a robbery
Hobblin' like a goblin and my brain is a little wobbly
I'm probably the height of a hobbit that's hobnobbin' in Oz
With a couple wonderful wizards, I've got problems
The plot thickens, I'm stuck up in the mud again
Utterly disgusting when I'm muttering my foot up in your anal hole
It's unexplainable 'cause I'm the awesomest
Blossom from a possum, stick my cock down your esophagus
Narcissist, I'm also an arsonist from an orphanage
Cock is way too big for my body, it's unproportionate
Morph into a profitable author, mad's a novelist
Of course I'm still a mess and I'm depressed, it's probably obvious

I'm fuckin' mental
That's just the way that it goes, dog
Canadian but you could keep the rain and the snowballs

Stupid shit, but the way that I combine
My wordplay, smartest rapper out with a dumb mind
Sometimes I kind of miss the clouds and the rain
'Cause that's what helps me get the blues, madchild is proudly insane

I lost my mind a long time ago
Hot with the rhyming though
Fall in line like dominos
Light it up, vamanos
My flow is all kind of dope
Something like a line of coke
Streets is cold, go and grab my heater, that's my kind of coat
Rain, hail, sleet, or snow
Shit you never know but to each his own
Pops back from prison, guess the preach is on
Watch your tone, Battleaxe Warriors are not alone
Smoke a zone, to the dome
I can't leave this life alone
Murder on this microphone
Living in a Cali daze
Get familiar, this serial killer is in his final phase
And my path ain't paved, every brick is laid
Fuck it, I'm paid
Light a j and just fade away
Fuck what they say, I ain't listening
Son, I'm like a christening
Keep it rolling like Michelin
You don't know shit about positions that I've been up in
Then again, grind for the benefit
You want to see the end of it

Was rhyming spitting flames the first day I started talkin'

Then I slapped her on her ass she said I beg your pardon

One of these days I'm gonna rock the world
Just give me a crayon and give me an A on
Everything I do with a ground to play on

Give me ball caps and sneakers, fresh in some jeans and t-shirt
Still got them children dance, looking like they having seizures

It's like tears doesn't matter to you, it's like you laughed at my pain

Put me in a position to pick up a pistol, and I'll blast in the game
I'm going crazy, being murdered by the hands of cancer

Auntie asked if I wanted to die, but couldn't understand my answer

See it's fucked up when you loving, they don't love you in return

Fuck around and wait till you get on your feet, and slug you till it burn

Niggas is flies yeah they over rise, but I hide in the dark

Cause where the fuck was these niggas at, when I resided in parks

Bitch I slept on the bench, ten feet away from the bullet proof fence

But at least, I ain't have to pay no rent

I'm thinking of espree, damn near positive that you regret me

But I pray to God, you'll never forget me, remember me

I represented for the both of us, how could you love me

And not trust me, somewhere hated now there's no more us plus

Sammy Lee it was a tragedy, your boo was found dead

Here's my shoulder for you my nigga, rest your head



[Chorus - 2x]

This is where they all fall down

Putting burners to they brain, till it bang

There's no way for the real, to maintain

This is where they all fall down

Pay your dues, cause you owe

When it's your time, God'll give you the go

I sit back and put my thoughts, on paper and rhymes

Tripping on the situations, that I'm facing in life

All this shifeness around me, but I still prevail

Get caught some shit we done together, and I'm making your bail

Cut your tail, while you fall down homie

Plus I'm in the kitchen cooking, so your family won't come hold me

Fuck that phony shit, that these fake niggas on

I get that pony bitch, then I get that hustle on

Staying strong like ammonia, as I bleed the block

Leaving that bitch swollen up, like I beat the cops

Going rock for rock, breaking down every zone

95 hundred woofing, where these niggas be strong

Staying alone to my own, with my baby and wife

Plus I'm keeping the bread a nine, cause I'm guarding my life

Ain't no slipping in my game, doing a dance to make it rain

Put a pistol to your head, and ease your pain



[Chorus - 2x]



[Z-Ro]

I feel like I invented pain, might go any minute mayn, starting a bit of

robbery

Homicide and lean on they destiny, in an attempt to get the pain

Constant strain, here we go again another day in the life

If I'm blessed, can I just get one successful day in my life

My life is the prime example, of a good nigga gon wrong

And I trust no one plus I'm not friendly, so leave me alone

See I don't need a click of yes men, when I walk the block

My retaliation is only, when I chalk the block

I stay in a sweet leaf, each time I meditate on how to live

Nothing but negative everywhere I turn, ain't no more positive

Nothing but drama, cause drama makes the world go round

But pretty soon, it'll make the world go down

Just get a weapon of situation, if you starving then you hungry right now

I can't wait a whole pay period, I need money right now

So when I bleed the block I'm not gon bleed a lot, just enough to keep

The bills paid, and enough to keep some fiddles in a pot



[Chorus - 2x]

[Z-Ro]
I thought I had a lot of partnas, but I've only got some
Since I can't depend on my niggaz, I put my faith up in my shotgun
Rolling around in my '78, reminiscing on the past
16 years old trying to get into Boomerang, smelling all our lil cash
Now it's like we never knew eachother, motherfuckers act strange
It's like they got intentions, on putting bullets up in my brain
Why they can't look me in my eyes no mo'
Even though I miss my T. Jones, at least mama ain't gotta to cry no mo'
I done seen my nigga get rich, leave the hood, make a lot of rich friends
But try to come back to the po' partnas, when all the richness end
Tell him to come watch me perform, but they don't go, and if I'm
Stranded and I need a ride, they say they coming but they don't show
Picture me walking down the feeter, everybody masking me up
Oh good it's that nigga from the hood, chunking a deuce passing me up
That's alright though, I gotta make a top flight hoe, smoking and thinking
When I get I want no nobody, but a Benjamin Franklin cause uh

[Hook - 2x]
Friends just ain't friends no more
Ain't no love, cause money is all we adore
Friends just ain't friends no more
I don't need you motherfuckers round me

[Cl'Che]
Most of these hoes say they your friend, but they really ain't down
Cause when you broke and got no ends, them same hoes don't come round
The main hoes that talk down, most friends turn to foes
That's just the way it go down, that's why I stay blowing pounds
Cause Mary Jane don't change she stay the same, help maintain
And ease the pain, stay free from the bullshit people bring
Cause the world is full of evil mayn
That's why I stay one deep, fuck these niggaz and these hoes
I be solo on my creep, no one in the passenger seat

[Den Den]
First he's riding high, now he busting Mack 10's
Watch you go from homie to foe, then try to come back again
There ain't no returning with the fuck shit, that's why I murder with one click
These fake ass G's I'm done with, selling my shit for one sill
But claiming you down to the ground bitch, bitch you ain't down with
Just another fake friend, trying to chop the Benz
Helping to plead my ends, looking for a win
Lying with a grin, trying to sneak back in

[Hook - 2x]
[Z-Ro]
Remember back in '97, we was living it up
If they had it and we wanted it, they was giving it up
Through it wrong together, I think we wrote our first song together
Matter of fact, we smoked our first zone together
Look at you now oh you a rich nigga, thinking that you running thangs
But you ain't running a damn thang but your mouth, cause you's a bitch nigga
Going against the grain, cause you done made a lil change
But I can't flip the script want to get rich, I gotta remain the same
I had visions of us balling together, pulling up at the Past at New Orleans
Together, everyday all day shot calling together, but now I'm only rolling solo
Don't get it twisted I still got love for my niggaz, but I don't fuck with em no mo'
Cause everybody want me to do, what they want me to do
And they want me to do it, but I'd rather stay full of embalming fluid
But you know what you can do for me, give me a whole lot of leave me alone
Cause the only partna I got left, got 17 partnas of his own and uh

Sliding through Mo Town, distributing contraband
Slipping and sliding like a snake, stacking my feddy like a bank
Moving slow like a tortoise, cause I'm tipsy from the drink
Hitting the dank and I pass it, roll on glass and a casket

While you linger in my arms, my lips will sigh ""I love you so"" 
Dream the sweetest dream will ever know
Tonight the moon is high, the lamp Is low
",Lamp Is Low,2002
Dena DeRose,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,2002
Dena DeRose,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Dena DeRose,"When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he loves you, all the way
Happy to be near you 
When you need someone to cheer you, all the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue see is
That's how deep it goes, if its real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you, all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in between years, come what may

Who know where the road will lead us

It's for sure I'm gonna love you, all the way

Dena DeRose,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate On You,2005

No hell below us
Above us only sky

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger

Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine

Hoping the water could buy me fate
For all of my mistakes
That I have made

Laid out memories by the lake
Hoping that they could sail away
Away from my mind
There's a piece of you left behind

I still see you there, out in the lake
Right in the middle where, it’s all faint
The less I care the more that you’ll fade
I still see you there out in the lake

Laid a letter by the lake
With all the worlds I want to say
And I know they’ll be no reply
But I’d still want you to know why

I still see you there, out in the lake
Right in the middle where, it’s all faint
The less I care the more that you’ll fade
I still see you there out in the lake, lake

You’re sinking down, like a pebble in the lake
Like the ghosts of my past, that's faded away
And now I’m left with nothing but a memory

An hourglass without sand
Suspended within space and time
I walk a thin line
Amongst the masses all alone
A furnished house with no one home
I see through walls that’s hard to climb
I’m losing my mind

No medicaid, no medication
Thinking you're better off dead
Instead should have been dedicated to education
I spin, the cylinder on my revolver
I spin, the cylinder
Would someone explain who’d leave a dick in charge of a bush
Of a colon I’m screwed, saw more war than Warsaw Poland, viewed
An infant’s insides, outside of his body
Inside of a place of worship, ungodly
Out cries tears “Dear God, where are we?”
That’s what I scream towards the skyline but probably
No one can hear a word of what I was saying
Insurgents surged in the temple where I was praying
Now flashbacks wake me abruptly when police pass by
Lights flash, if i could only put the past on a flash drive I’d
For peace of mind, install an external drive
So I’d be more driven internally to survive I’m

A clock without a minute hand
An hourglass without sand
(So I suspend, the cylinder on my revolver
I spin, the cylinder on my revolver)
Amongst the masses all alone
A furnished house with no one home
(So I spin, the cylinder on my revolver
I suspend, the cylinder on my revolver)

My family customs were not accustomed to dealing with mental health
It was more or less an issue for white families with wealth
Void, I defected, employed self annoyed
Went independent, enjoyed stealth
Now doctors prescribed sedatives and Prozac
The rent’s cheaper in the ghetto but you can’t go back
So I, suspend the cylinder on my revolver
Then, maybe let it draw blood like Chupacabra
And dissolve into the abyss, without evolving
Instead of revolving around the habitual problem solver
Research like, George Washington Carver
But no answer so my mantra is to deal with it in and chart then
Part, instead of being incredibly defiant
Peddle through revenue issues I’ll do it for medical science
It’s better to be level-headed than to regret it and pious
Settling for life without sun-shine, never vibrant, I’m

A clock without a minute hand
An hourglass without sand
Suspended within space and time

Denaun,"Hey look let me tell y'all somethin' alright?
What I do, I do
Straight like that
So ain't no sense in y'all troublin' yourselves over that
'Cause man the way I feel right now today

I came up on the wrong side of the fence
I gave my family pain and strife and asked them all for strength
But hell in my defence
And I got too much way too fast
My mama told me it won't last
Now I'm back down on the bottom
Wishin' that I took another bath
I should've listened
But my mind was gone
My temper too quick so when my fuse get lit so when it's on, it's on
Yeah, everybody wrong
Yeah, and I'm always right
Yeah, ain't nobody to blame now
It's me vs. Me, man, this my fight

So don't look at me like I am the same person I was before
We all deserve a second chance and this time I think I can do more
I'm better

Yeah I put that on my family, all you gotta do is give me the chance
And I can show you that I'm worthy of the trust that you require
Put it all on my shoulders, I'm a fighter, I won't get tired
When I'm back up in this corner, back up in this corner, tryna get out
Back up in this corner, back up in this corner, gotta get out

You think I got none but I got all kind of sense
Stop judgin' my book by the cover
Maybe you should do a little recounting since
I ain't tryna vent, this ain't what was me
It's nothing owed to me
Get the swan song, I don't need an ode to me
Shit hopefully holdin' this rosary'll keep me out of close calls with the O police
I said I'm tryna be a whole new me
I ain't tryna do the same old thing
I'm tryna prove to my family that I will not bring
No more trouble around, I ain't gotta do nothing
But stay out of shit, I ain't gotta be up in the chaotic
Prolly 'cause it's my redemption that I'm entrenched in
And I won't let anybody deny my vision, it's my decision
But y'all ain't listenin'

So don't look at me like I am the same person I was before
We all deserve a second chance and this time I think I can do more
I'm better

Yeah I put that on my family, all you gotta do is give me the chance
And I can show you that I'm worthy of the trust that you require
Put it all on my shoulders, I'm a fighter, I won't get tired
When I'm back up in this corner, back up in this corner, tryna get out
Back up in this corner, back up in this corner, gotta get out

It's my gameplan now
To get in this ring and show that I'm a changed man and how
I won't blow another chance to make you proud
Even though you got the right to hate me now
I know you lost your hope in me
But hopefully I can restore it back where it's supposed to be
I just want my daughter back, this fight means much more than that
I'm tryna think before I react, I ain't get the message at first
I tried to ignore the facts
But I'm much older, she's my soldier, I told you
I'd go to war for that
I said your boy is the truth and it's no lie in him
All he needs is his family with him
Y'all want him 'til it's no room given
I'ma hit him 'til the ref come and get him

Dendemann,"Das ist hier die Session
Jungs, seid ihr bereit für die Session? (Auf jeden Fall)
Aha, ja! Ich bin bereit für die Session
Gib mir mal jemand 'n Joint
Dann bin ich auch breit für die Session
Seid ihr bereit für die Session? (Wir sind bereit für die Session)
Ich fang mal so an (ja, fang mal so an)
Hier kommen vier von Deutschlands großen MCs
Augen sind rot, Hosen hängen tief
Samy, Dendemann, Illo und Nico am Mikro
Mit Niveau und viel Flow, kapito, Amigo?

Die gelbe Trikotfarbe gehört nur Nico Suave
Schon klar, dass ich spontan bei dem Beat zusage
Jetzt Spaß beiseite, ich bring phasenweise Texte
So effektiv, dass Wack-MCs die Straßenseite wechseln

Jungs, ich setzt euch 'ne Deadline
Auf drei müsst ihr weg sein
Eins, drei - Pech gehabt! Ich bin halt 'n Dreckschwein
Feilen an Textzeilen
Bis sie glatt sind wie Speckstein
Rhyme fresh fresh Rhymes
So auf Flash kann nur Ress sein

Hey, check mein', ich bleibe, auch wenn ich hier nur störe
Um so zu tun, als ob das ganze Land nur mir gehöre
Denn wir vier Tenöre plus Joni Rewind
Sagen: „Lass dein' Scheiß doch da, wo die Sonne nicht scheint!“
Seid ihr bereit für die Session?

Ich bin bereit für die Session
Nico, bereit für die Session?

Ich bin bereit für die Session
Dende, bereit für die Session?

Ja, ich bin bereit für die Session
Und wenn ihr's nicht glaubt
Kann ich das Mic ein zweites Mal testen:
Wenn du wie ich Reime kickst
Und dafür Scheine kriegst
Gehörten diese vorher meist großen und kleinen Kids
Und jeder der denkt, dafür braucht man keine Tricks
Ist leider noch schiefer gewickelt als meine Sticks

Sticks und ich schreibe Hits, während ich auf Klo beim Scheißen sitz'
Rhyme deluxe, weil die Muse mich küsst und mir einen wichst
Heißt eigentlich gibt's zum Meckern hier kaum'n Grund
Bring's auf'n Punkt, und MCs hören dies mit dem Daumen im Mund

Ich sehe nur nen Haufen Schund, schau mich um, glaub' es kaum:
Nur tausend Clowns - von mir gibt's ne Faust frei Haus exakt aufs Auge drauf
Unsere Gigs sind ausverkauft, ihr seid da nie aufgetaucht
Und wenn doch?
Habt ihr euch nie zu uns da oben raufgetraut

Ich hab auch geglaubt, dass die Jungs keinen Mumm haben
Du kannst liebend gern rumfragen
Den Typen fehlen Grundlagen
Wie zum Beispiel Micdisziplin
Es wird Zeit, dass wir Ihnen zeigen
Beim Zeilen Schreiben
Dass wir tight sind im Team
Seid ihr bereit für 'ne Session?

Ich bin bereit für 'ne Session
Dende, bereit für 'ne Session?

Ich bin bereit für die Session
Sam, bereit für 'ne Session?

Bin ich bereit für 'ne Session?
Ich bin nicht nur bereit, ich besteh' drauf weiterzurappen:
Ich könnt wetten, dass hier bald jeder von euch Deppen kapiert
Dass ihr scheiße ausseht wie benutztes Toilettenpapier
Nachdem ich euch in alter Battle-Manier
Die Fresse polier'
Und wieder echten Rap etablier', Sam Semi!

Und jetzt hätten wir auch schon 'n triftigen Grund
Auf dass wir den Stift nehmen und dann die Schrift in den Mund
Kauen sie gut durch und spucken sie wieder aus
Und bringen dann bestenfalls die Reste als sowas wie Lieder raus

Yo, der Beat erlaubt's, ich attackier mit smoothem Rap
Junge träum schön weiter vom Plattendeal bei Groove Attack
Ich appelliere für'n guten Zweck an die wahre Szene
Und plakatier': „Steckt Wannabes in Quarantäne“

Da klappern Zähne reihenweise, vor allem wenn ich mich einschalte
Euch Lappen die Klamotten klau' und meine Jungs neu einkleide
Wenn ich euch jetzt einheize und ans nackte Bein scheiße
Gleicht das einem Fallschirmsprung mit gekappter Reißleine
Bereit für die Session?

Ich bin bereit für die Session
Und selbst bereit für die Session?

Ich bin bereit für die Session

Ist noch einer von den drei Gästen bereit für die Session?

Jawohl, ich bin so weit bereit und geb' noch einen zum Besten:
Vorsicht! Es gibt ein bisschen Action am Mic
Die Session zu viert hat den meisten jetzt schon gereicht
Ich schick' dir im Nu drei Jungs vorbei, wenn du mit Kontra gibst
Glaub ja nicht, es sei 'was Besonderes, wovon du sprichst

Ich bin hart am Platz wie Zahnersatz, ein Labersack
Der Partner hat, sich gerade macht mit drei MCs
Die wissen wie der Hase tanzt
Verpassen euch 'n Wadenkrampf
Stecken voller Tatendrang
Das Instrumental in Brand
Und richten im Land Schaden an

Ey, Warte Mann, ich hab zwar schon ganze Shows verpennt
Bloß wer denkt, ich sei deshalb nicht schneller als ein Toaster brennt
Der hat jetzt mehr zu verlieren als Hopfen und Malz
Ich hau' euch mit brutalen Ritualen den Kopf in den Hals

Wir sind für's Rauchen und Saufen und Klauen statt Kaufen bekannt
Hängen auf'n Haufen zusammen und labern Mist am laufenden Band
Erfinden Geschichten, weil eh alles falsch nach außen gelangt
Freestylen schon und vertauschen die Namen
Und verkaufen den Kram
Ja, ich denk das war's mit der Session

Ich denk das war's mit der Session
Suave, du noch Bock zu flashen?

Ne, keine Lust
Illo, hast du noch Bock zu rappen?

Ne, Jungs ich bin bedient
Ich hab Bock auf 'was zu Essen",Session,2001
Dendemann,"Ja, Ja, Jawoll, ihr kennt die Leier
Immer das Gleiche mit diesem Dendemeier
Wenn ich mal wieder durch's Gelände eier
Und mich dabei als lebende Legende feier'
Als Selbstläufer, als Einzelgänger
Und ""Guten Abend"" brüll' wie 100 Mainzelmänner
Ich bin kein Rapper, nur ein Blues-Sänger auf Abwegen
Bin kein Rebell, nur ein Fußgänger auf Radwegen
Bin kein hartnäckiger Wadenbeißer
Bin kein Freischwimmer, ich bin Bademeister
Ja, schau mir das Geschehen vom Beckenrand an
Bis ich, sagen wir mal, zu checken anfang'
Denn manche schwimmen mit, manche gegen den Strom
Doch ich frag`:""Schwimmen wir noch, oder leben wir schon?""
Ich bin durch damit, es hat sich ausgeschwommen
Könnt' ich dafür endlich mal'n Applaus bekommen?

Es ist jetzt so weit, ich schwimmte, schwamm und schwomm
Endlich, endlich hab' ich wieder Land gewonnen
Endlich, endlich bin ich angekommen
Endlich, endlich Nichtschwimmer, schmeiß' an den Song

Es ist jetzt so weit, ich schwimmte, schwamm und schwomm
Endlich, endlich hab' ich wieder Land gewonnen
Endlich, endlich bin ich angekommen
Endlich, endlich Nichtschwimmer, schmeiß' an den Song

In diesem Freibad, dass sie Leben nenn'
Lernt man als Bademeister praktisch jeden kenn'
Bevorzugte Stile sind Brust oder Kraul
Doch auch dafür sind viele zu lustlos und faul
Machen die Boje, lassen sich treiben
Würden bis sie schrumplig sind im Nassen drin bleiben
Ich hol sie gerne raus, doch kann das nicht entscheiden
Außerdem kommt noch dazu, kann ich Wasser nicht leiden
Und sollt' ich doch einmal ins Becken springen
Dann nur, um dich aus dem Schlamassel weg zu bringen
Ich hab unterm rechten Arm 'nen Rettungsring
Und mit dem Linken mach ich ein' auf Schmetterling
Egal wie fett es klingt, es is' 'ne starke Droge
Und davon los zu kommen bleibt 'ne harte Probe
Ich schwimm' nicht mehr, check' meine Garderobe
Da findest du alles, nur keine Badehose

Endlich, endlich bin ich angekommen

(Schabadabadu) Jansen & Kowalski sind am Start
(Schabadabadu) Digidendemüller hat die Tracks Parat
(Schabadabadu) Ich frag euch:""Leute, was? Was geht ab?
(Schabadabadu) Seid ihr da? Ja, ja, ja!""

Man könnte meinen, ich hätt's erst gerade entdeckt
Doch Chlorwasser hat immer schon so fade geschmeckt
Ich sitz' auf meinem Turm, hab die Lage gecheckt
Und fühl' mich damit wohl, wie die Made im Speck
Ich sag' es direkt - auch ich hing im Wasser 'rum
Es klingt unfassbar dumm, doch bestimmt ist das der Grund
Dass mir die Sache heute stinkt wie'n nasser Hund

All of the ladies in the house tonight

Wenn eure Mundwinkel hoch geht
Dann ist die Welt wieder so schön
Und dann ist alles, was ist und was war
Auf einmal so vollkommen egal

Ja!
Für alle Töchter, alle Mütter, alle Omas
Von der Elbe bis runter zum Amazonas
Egal, ob fromme Zeuginnen Jehovas
Kassiererin des Jahres oder Playmate des Monats
In Bagdad mit Highheels auf'm Klapprad
Oder in Cottbus im Porsche mit Kopftuch
Für all meine Diven mit 'nem Drama
Engel in Kik oder Teufel in Prada
Kernphysik- oder Straßenabitur
Die Welt verändern wollen oder nur die Frisur
Das ist für all die zauberhaften vier Milliarden
Denn euer Lächeln, das ist alles, was wir haben

Und wenn eure Mundwinkel hochgehen
Dann ist die Welt wieder so schön
Und dann ist alles, was ist und was war
Auf einmal so vollkommen egal
Ja, wenn die Mundwinkel hochgehen

Und dann ist alles, was ist und was war
Auf einmal so vollkommen egal

Für die Mami mit dem Schreihals in der Babykarre
Und für die Mami mit der dreihalsigen E-Gitarre
Die mit dem Lachen, dreckig schön wie Schlammschlachten
Und den großen Funkplatten in den kleinen Handtaschen
Für all die Füchsinnen und Dende-Frauen
Aus „Diese Party ist noch lange nicht zu Ende!“-Town
Erster Mai - Molotov Cocktail klein
Westberlin, feminin, ock auf Streit
Schwarzer Gürtel, roter Lippenstift
Und im Lächeln im Gesicht hängt 'n dicker Spliff
Irgendwo ist sie und du findest sie bestimmt
Und die hat's dann in sich, und zwar doppelt mit'm Kind

Und wenn eure Mundwinkel hochgehen
Dann ist die Welt wieder so schön
Und dann ist alles, was ist und was war
Auf einmal so vollkommen egal
Ja, wenn die Mundwinkel hochgehen

Für all die ganzen besseren Hälften
Lieblingsmenschen, Hexen und Elfen
Babys und Schatzis, Musen und Nymphen
Für Ladies, die Nazis als „Husos“ beschimpfen
Die ihre Frau stehen, no matter der Aussehen
Mit Battlerap gegen „Hätte, hätt'“-Ausreden
Ja, das ist für alle Doppel-,X‘en
Die dicken Obelixen und die schicken Model-Chicksen
Alle, die blind vor Liebe sind und deshalb mit dem Herzen sehen
Die lächeln, auch wenn's besser ist, sie ernst zu nehmen
Das ist für Prinzessinnen, die Erbsen zählen
Und alle meine Schwestern, die grad deswegen die derbsten sind

Deneen Lowe,"Extremeties excite pulses and in turn different entities
Won't break bread or split the peas
But in the soup the mixture of several racial groups
Minority troops flavors the broth of Wall Street suits
Armani or maybe Versace
Monetary gain can't stop the White House frolics
Judicial alcoholics
Cover up versions of death in the Persian
Now a right angle equals eighty degrees
The Haitians brought the AIDS disease -- NEGATIVE
The scapegoat becomes a raging rhinoceros
Bush is steady watching us
How can we kill their Asiatic crew
Ahh develop a harsh addictive brew
Flood their beighborhood and let their leaders debate it
Part one of the hatred

The sequel the birth of many Uncle Tom's
I myself I can't stay calm
I shake in Bensonhurst rest in Bedford-Stuy
School in Sheepshead Bay, move to strong LI
But my self inner-self breaks North
And like Moses I'm judged by the cloth
Of my heritage who will bring forth the people
In all people there lies that certain evil
The enemy within spreads to the next of kin
A baby's no longer cute, here comes David Duke
Bring a halt and with a wound sprinkle salt
To the black -- lock them in a St. Ide's vault
Burp up the progress, the agony, the pain
Put down the brew have a brain
The freedom ice is thin and we're the first ones to shake
Then comes the real hate

Why should you hate me?  What have I done?
We all have eight fingers and two thumbs
To feel the oppression so every studio session
I try to kick a positive lesson
U.S. coverups are neat like Tony Randall
Brotherly love is melting like a candle
Humanity without human beings
They even said Chubb was against Koreans
I just wanted to state the facts
It seems that no one is against Blacks
Uhh, what should we do?  Should we run?
Uhh, if we run we'll succumb
They're mad so don't you know they're scared of the dark so
And the dark so rule the bank so
So you know that they're mad so
This style developed by Shabba Ranks so
And with that I want to give thanks so
To the temperament of the strength of Miss Parks
But even now in the nineties we will spark and respark
The hatred",The Hatred,1992
Deneen Lowe,"I walk down the street, yo pick any one
I see a little ruffneck kid with a gun
I said, ""Little homeboy what's up with the glock 19?""
He said a damn crack fiend just went and took his mama's life
And now the kid's over there smoking the pipe
I said, ""Guilt will let him know what he did
and you don't need to go to jail, you're just a kid.
Give me the gun little G, just cool it down.
You've got a lot to live for you're college bound.""
And so he screams and cries, we start huggin
On the corner in Ft. Greene, we're buggin
Tears drip as we walk to the crib
And I'ma try to be there to comfort the kid
I woke up it's a brand new day
Little man blew himself away
And I'm scorned, an emotional thorn
And I'm lost in the storm

Well back in the hood, understood, I mean understand
The conspiracy upon the first man
Death to the Klan pump the fists that's connected
To the elbow joined by cartilage to the dark hand
And the plan to conserve this confused violent land
Different races, faces share the same spaces
Sewed by arrogant laces
Taste t his peace is real sweet
Extra reasoning seasoning to the weak
Will be done before the sun starts to nova
Or we'll be over
Reveal the passion button now hit it
Cause no one is born a bigot
Delete what you have engraved in your mind
And throw up the peace sign
And maybe be reborn or be lost in the storm

Well it's ninety-two we will make it to ninety-three
With no P-E, A-see-E
It won't happen so stop your damn finger tappin
Find the music of peace and start rappin
The answer lies in your hearts then your minds
And maybe then we can save human kind
Put away the guns and have fun was a strong motto in ninety-one
But a Woodstock ninety-two the many join the few to delete the racist crew
Without death cause that will be illogical
Peace will cover every newspaper article
So now then, where do we start
Everybody knows they have to play a part
Open your minds and clear your minds
And throw up the peace signs
Cause to scorn, be reborn, everybody let's be reborn
Or be lost in the storm",Lost in the Storm,1992

And then I'm going to freeze you
So that you can think
Of all the ways you hurt me

I'll let you crawl out
Crawl out from your cave

So bright I had to close my eyes to see

Deniece Williams,"Sometimes, lonely nights turn into sunny days
I never thought I'd feel this way
I never knew that you and I were meant to be in love

Oh, darling, you've always been around to see me through.
How was I to know you'd make my dreams come true?
Time and time again before, always on our own
But now we're friends in love

Hoping that we'll always still be friends in love
It's dawn and we're together
Darling, now we got forever and day
Don't you go away

Remember every time you cried, you came to me
Much to my surprise, I found someone to see
Even nights of loneliness you were always there for me
We're friends in love

Hoping that we'll always still be friends in love
It's dawn and we're together
Darling, now we got forever and day
Don't you go away

You turned around, looked my way
I can't say that it hasn't crossed my mind
I've loved you all along
Ah, now we're leavin' yesterday behind
We'll never be alone, we're friends in love

Hoping that we'll always still be friends in love
It's dawn and we're together

Don't you go away

Deniece Williams,"Free like the river 
Flowin' freely through infinity 
Free to be sure of 
What I am and who I need not be 
Free from all worries 
Worries prey on oneself's troubled mind 
Freer than the clock's hands 
Tickin' way the times 
Freer than the meaning of free that man defines 
Life running through me 
Till I feel my father God has called 
Me having nothin' 
But possessing riches more than all 
And I'm free 
To be nowhere 
But in every place I need to be 
Freer than a sunbeam 
Shinning through my soul 
Free from feelin' heat or knowing bitter cold 
Free from conceiving the beginning 
For that's the infinite start 
I'm gone - gone but still living 
Life goes on without a beating heart 
Free like a vision 
That the mind of only you can see 
Freer than a raindrop 
Falling from the sky 
Freer than a smile in a baby's sleepin' eyes 
I'm free like a river 
Flowin' freely to infinity 
I'm free to be sure of what 
I am and who I need not be 
I'm much freer - like the meaning of the word free that

With his name painted clearly on each;
But since he omitted to mention the fact,
They were all left behind on the beach.

And it drove the poor Bellman half mad-
He could only bake Bridecake -for which, I may state,
No materials were to be had.

Deniece Williams,"Gina, Gina, I kissed you once and then
I felt so wonderful, so very wonderful
Let's do it over again

Gina, Gina, I can't remember when
I've ever felt a kiss that made me feel like this
Let's do it over again

Look at you, oh, look at you
So warm, so sweet, so shy
Look at me, oh, look at me
I can't believe that I'm such a lucky guy
To have Gina, Gina all for my very own
It's much too wonderful, so very wonderful
To know that Gina is mine alone

Deniece Williams,"A time for us, some day there'll be
When chains are torn by courage born of a love that's free
A time when dreams so long denied
Can flourish as we unveil the love we now must hide

A time for us, at last to see
A life worthwhile for you and me

And with our love, through tears and thorns
We will endure as we pass surely through every storm
A time for us, some day there'll be a new world
A world of shining hope for you and me

For you and me

And with our love, through tears and thorns
We will endure as we pass surely through every storm

I know that I shouldn't stay

Deniece Williams,"When Sunny gets blue, her eyes get gray and cloudy
Then the rain begins to fall
Pitter-patter, pitter-patter, love is gone so what can matter?
No sweet lovin' man comes to call

When Sunny gets blue, she breathes a sigh of sadness
Like the wind that stirs the trees
Wind that sets the leaves to swayin' like some violins are playin'
Weird and haunting melodies

People used to love to-o-o hear her laugh, see her smile
That's how she got her name
Since that sad affair she's lost her smile, changed her style
Somehow she's not the same

But mem'ries will fade and pretty dreams will rise up
Where her other dreams fell through
Hurry, new love, hurry here to kiss away each lonely tear
And hold her near when Sunny gets blue

Hurry, new love, hurry here to kiss away each lonely tear
And hold her near   when Sunny    gets blue",When Sunny Gets Blue,1992
Deniece Williams,"Like the sweet morning dew, 
I took one look at you,
And it was plain to see you were my destiny.
With my arms open wide, I threw away my pride.
I'll sacrifice for you dedicate my life for you.
I will go where you lead always there in time of need.
And when I lose my will you'll be there to push me up the hill.
There's no, no looking back for us, we got love sure 'nough, that's enough.
You're all, you're all I need to get by.
 
Like an eagle protects his nest for you I'll do my best, 
Stand by you like a tree, dare anybody to try and move me.
Darlin' in you I found strength where I was torn down
Don't know what's in store but together we can open any door.
Just to do what's good for you and inspire you a little higher.
I know you can make a man out of a soul that didn't have a goal.
'Cause we, we got the right foundation and with love and determination.
You're all, you're all I want to strive for and do a little more.
All, all the joys under the sun wrapp'd up into one.",You're All I Need to Get By,1992
Deniece Williams,"Now that we have gotten through 
One more fall
I can just admit I've got it all
Cause I do 
Cause I've got you 
We've crossed these battle lines to many times
It passes through the heart
But it never leaves a mark

Cause Your love just keeps on healing me
No matter how I bruise
If I just trust You
Your love just keeps on healing me
One more clue
One more chance that wasn't there before
In your arms
No pain can harm the way I'm feeling
Lord I know that Your love is healing

I've kicked around those lines in my head
But I've never listened to the words that You said
See where its lead
Well I know I have it now
Cause You showed me how
And all I had to do
Was just to keep my eyes on You

Cause Your love just keeps on healing me
No matter how I bruise
If I just trust You

After all that we've been through
I can't seem to face the fact that boy I'm losing you

I never thought I'd feel this way
I never knew that you and I were meant to be in love

Oh, darling, you've always been around to see me through.
How was I to know you'd make my dreams come true?
Time and time again before, always on our own
But now we're friends in love

Hoping that we'll always still be friends in love
It's dawn and we're together
Darling, now we got forever and day
Don't you go away

Remember every time you cried, you came to me
Much to my surprise, I found someone to see
Even nights of loneliness you were always there for me
We're friends in love

Hoping that we'll always still be friends in love
It's dawn and we're together
Darling, now we got forever and day
Don't you go away

You turned around, looked my way
I can't say that it hasn't crossed my mind
I've loved you all along
Ah, now we're leavin' yesterday behind
We'll never be alone, we're friends in love

Hoping that we'll always still be friends in love

Unloadin' there's somethin' in my way
They'll never take me alive
I got somethin' on the way
I'ma survive I'ma try to do straight
Try to make it alive, be around for that due date
But it's hard, niggaz hatin' em hard
That loss hurt to the heart
But still they say it's they fault, we blame y'all
Nigga how, nigga please
It's still on baby
Tell them niggaz had they still off safety
What about them other fake dudes that he grew up wit
Elementary middle school up wit
Man them niggaz was there ain't move yet
I'm startin' to think they had somethin' to do wit it
I used to think them niggaz was scared

Everyday we reminisce about that three day trip
Same night that we left, got a call you hit
Thought you was still wit us, aimed at me that he flipped
Got a call from my peaches found out where you was hit
Three hit himself who missed him and you just a couple inches
You don't know how much you miss him, bullshittin' in the kitchen
Ninety percent fist fights leadin' to them slammers
But lil' Drake ain't understand until one of them niggaz vanish
This rap shit is crazy but believe me I'ma try
Whether happened or not homie I got lil' five
And with the real ones I'ma slice my pies
As you would of wanted, man I'm so sick to my stomach
That you ain't around enjoyin' the fruits of our labors
Shit's about to get major, and these niggaz really hate us
Around for nothin' givin' me teeth and palms
Man I don't pay 'em no mind, just try to focus and rhyme ya know

I'm peaches that's where you can reach us
Cook out every other til' they took a nigga brother
Love ya like a brother so I try to take ya brother
And he be on some other shit, I be tryin' to tell 'em man
I seen how you feel
He had intentions on killin' my big brother
Just to let me see how he feel
Tellin' me his life over fuckin' cops
They know they after, run before they catch him he got people to kill
That boy crazy, he got people for real
He gone wind up layin' somewhere peaceful for real
Like he the only one goin' through the pain
Like his mom and our peaches ain't goin' through the same
Cool one minute, then he goin' through a change

So I separate myself, I look better wit myself

One of the first niggaz you let in your crib
Moms treated me like a son since day one
Thinkin 'bout how she talking bout she can't wait til that day come

And I came into this game on your back and your game ain't intact
And I'm tryin to do my thang
All I want to know is if you tryin to do the same
I feel like I could do without you, at the same time I can't

'Cause at the same time it'll hurt
Ain't no shame in our game but our moms'll be hurt
Dreams of being stars, a lotta niggaz ??
If you can't do it for us, do it for Ms. Kim

Plus we promised both our mommas that we would
You know if we break that promise, it'll break they little hearts

But you hatas gonna make me snap, cock back and red dot ya
Face it, ya basic...you can't tie my laces
Now I got the game mapped, plus I want my spot back

We together forever, these niggaz can't stop that
Do it for who? I do it for you!
Let's be for real homeboy, they not our crew
And since we talkin facts, it's really just us two (Whoo)

And I know you feel the same when you're signed
But you couldn't even ride 'cause I wasn't on my job
Don't never ever think I left your side
Never T-mac and Carter see, Man you a part of me

Brother from another, even though my momma loved you like her own
Let's do this rap shit and just move on
I just thought I was passin a baton, lettin you kill them songs
Now I feel I'm all wrong

God forbid this rap shit'll don't even work out
Still know the Coke route, still get our moms out
And that's a promise we could never break

Room start spinning, you beginning to get paranoid, start hearing noises

Can't forget about the Chitown 'dro
That's why they say it's the windy city
Ladies could blow
Got a connect everywhere I go, never catch me with less than an O, you know

[Chorus]
You got stress in your life then we smoking tonight
My ladies gimme a light 
My ladies gimme a light
My ladies gimme a light
Niggas twist something up if you don't give a fuck if the Cali Kush
Got you stuck
My niggas gimme a light
My niggas gimme a light

You got your baby's momma beefing with you, better have that reefer with you
When she finish let the leaf remove you
I inhale it deep like the chief of voodoo
Handcuffing these beats like police will do you, that's how it works for me

Puffing on the purple, hit the booth with my eyes burgundy
I spit the truth on how the earth be
And all the bullshit I go through like dirt weed
And how I always come through like birth, be

Ten pounds, eight ounces of herb, be
I take two to the chest for all my niggaz that left
I blow it out, let them live through my breath

And everybody got a way to relax like everybody gotta pay their tax
If you live where I live everybody gotta blaze their gat
So everybody blaze up a sack, let's go

[Chorus]

It's been heavy on my mind, now I gotta leave it all behind
Smoke the pain away, chase the rain away
See the sun is gonna shine 'till the night
Smoke the pain away, chase the rain away

The president, he gotta legalize it
The governor, he gotta legalize it
Mayor, mayor gotta legalize it
Let all my niggas lead their lives as they see fit, 
That's how I see it
God damn, I'm a genius when I'm lit

Man fuck this shit man, Gu, twist something up
I'm gonna come out there, let the bridge ride on 'em

It's been heavy on my mind, now I gotta leave it all behind
Smoke the pain away, chase the rain away
See the sun is gonna shine 'till the night
Smoke the pain away, chase the rain away

Get low always smoking that la la la
You know Bleek always smoking that la la la
Young Proof always smoking that la la la
My nigga Cali always smoking that la la la
Sheik Breezy always smoking that la la la
Murder One's always smoking that la la la

You felt you had to test me

Just you and I and the stars above

But now I've found
You've been lying from the start
All these tears i have cried in vain
My heart was full of love
Now its full of shame

I hear your voice whisper in the dark sometimes
I toss & turn, my body misses you so

When I know you feel like loving me too

Où le cœur sans espoir
Je pleurais en attendant

Me fait du mal me fait du bien

Quand les jeunesses débarquent

De ma jeunesse 
Que reste-t-il des billets doux 
Des mois d' avril, des rendez-vous 
Un souvenir qui me poursuit 
Sans cesse",Que reste-t-il de nos amours?,2015
Denis Benarrosh,"Ils s'aimaient depuis deux jours à peine 
Y a parfois du bonheur dans la peine 
Mais depuis qu'ils étaient amoureux 
Leur destin n'était plus malheureux, 
Ils vivaient avec un rêve étrange 
Et ce rêve était bleu comme les anges 
Leur amour était un vrai printemps, oui 
Aussi pur que leurs tendres vingt ans 

C'est la romance de Paris 
Au coin des rues, elle fleurit 
Ça met au cœur des amoureux 
Un peu de rêve et de ciel bleu 
Ce doux refrain de nos faubourgs 
Parle si gentiment d'amour 
Que tout le monde en est épris 
C'est la romance de Paris 

La banlieue était leur vrai domaine

Ils partaient à la fin de la semaine 
Dans les bois pour cueillir le muguet 
Ou sur un bateau pour naviguer 
Ils buvaient aussi dans les guinguettes 
Du vin blanc qui fait tourner la tête 
Et quand ils se donnaient un baiser, oui 
Tous les couples en dansant se disaient 

C'est la romance de Paris 
Au coin des rues, elle fleurit 
Ça met au cœur des amoureux 
Un peu de rêve et de ciel bleu 
Ce doux refrain de nos faubourgs 
Parle si gentiment d'amour 
Que tout le monde en est épris 
C'est la romance de Paris 

C'est ici que s'arrête mon histoire 
Aurez-vous de la peine à me croire? 
Si je vous dis qu'il s'aimèrent chaque jour 
Qu'ils vieillirent avec leur tendre amour 
Qu'ils fondèrent une famille admirable 
Et qu'ils eurent des enfants adorables 
Qu'ils moururent gentiment, inconnus, oui 
En partant comme ils étaient venus

Sans même me dire bonsoir
Donnez-moi un peu d'espoir ce soir
J'ai tant de peine
Vous, dont je guette un regard
Pour quelle raison, ce soir passez-vous sans me voir
Un mot, je vais le dire  ""je vous aime""

Vous, qui passez sans me voir
Me donnerez-vous ce soir

De larmes, de fleurs, de baisers

Denis Colin,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Wanting tragic ends
Though they do pretend
They won't go when I go

All those bleeding hearts
With sorrows to impart
Were right here from the start
And they won't go when I go

And I'll go where I've longed
To go so long
Away from tears
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Gone from painful cries
Away from saddened eyes
Along with him I'll bide
And they won't go when I go

Weak ones standing tall
I will watch them fall
'Cause they won't go when I go
And I'll go where I've longed
To go so long
Away from tears
Unclean minds mislead the pure
The innocent will leave for sure
For them there is a resting place
People sinning just for fun
They will never see the sun
For they can never show their faces
There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner
Who will take more than he will give
He'll give, he'll give
He ain't hardly gonna give, oh yeah

Far away from me
And my soul will be free

Some find it pleasant dining on pheasant.
Those things roll off my knife,
Just serve me tomatoes, and mashed potatoes,
Give me the simple life.

Not one that's spacious and wide.
A house that rings with joy and laughter

Folks, I'd like to sing a song about the American Dream. About me. About you. 
The way our American hearts beat down in the bottom of our chests. 
About the special feeling we get in the cockles of our hearts,

Maybe in the liver. Maybe in the kidneys. Maybe even in the colon,
We don't know.

I'm just a regular Joe with a regular job
I'm your average white suburbanite slob
I like football and porno and books about war
I've got an average house with a nic hardwood floor

My feet on my table, and a Cuban cigar

But sometimes that just ain't enough to keep a man like me interested

Denis Leary,"I love to smoke, I smoke seven thousand packs a day, okay?
And I am never fucking quitting I don't care how many laws they make
What's the law now? You can only smoke in your apartment
Under a blanket, with all the lights out? Is that the rule now, huh?

The cops are outside, ""We know you have the cigarettes
Come out of the house with the cigarettes above your head""
""You'll never get me copper! I'm never coming out, you hear?
I got a cigarette machine right here in my bedroom, yeah! Say yeah!""

Know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna get one of those tracheotomies
So I can smoke two cigarettes at the same time
I'm gonna get nine tracheotomies, all the way around my neck
I'll be tracheotomie man!
""He can smoke a pack at a time! He's tracheotomie man!

I'm looking forward to cancer, man, I want that throat cancer
That's the best kind, you know why?
You get that throat cancer, you get that voice box thing
Know what I'm talking about?

Sure it's scary, but you can make a lot of money with a voice box
Get a voice box, walking around the streets of Manhattan
""You got any spare change?""
""Ahh! Here's my whole wallet, get away from me!""

Imagine a whole family with voice boxes, that'd be creepy, wouldn't it?
They'd be out in that backyard everyday during the summer
""Dad, can we go to the beach?"", ""Yes, get your mother and the dog""
""We'll leave right now, Sparky, come here""

Or the ultimate irony, a guy with a voice box pulling up to the drive
Through window at Mcdonald's, that has to suck, huh?
""Can I help you?"", ""Big Mac and a large order of fries""
""Stop making fun of me"", ""I'm not making fun of you""
""I'm getting the manager"", ""Get the fucking manager, I don't care""

I can remember a time in this country
When men were proud to get cancer, God dammit!
When it was a sign of manhood! John Wayne had cancer twice
Second time, they took out one of his lungs, he said, ""Take 'em both!
'Cuz I don't fuckin' need 'em! I'll grow gills and breathe like a fish!""

Babe Ruth, greatest baseball player to ever play the game
He had a voice box, he was the first American to have a voice box
Yeah!, ""This is Babe Ruth
The Sultan of Swat, the Bambino""

I smoke twenty-five goddamn Black Cuban cigars a day
I had meat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner
I fucked eighteen prostitutes a night!
'Course, I'm dead now

I'm up here in Heaven, Lou Gehrig is up Here with me
God love Lou Gehrig, Jesus Christ, poor Lou Gehrig
Died of Lou Gehrig's disease
How the Hell did he not see that coming?

We used to tell him, Lou, there's a disease
With your name all over it, pal!
There ain't no Babe Ruth disease, I'll tell you that much right now
Have a hot dog and a Hummer, go ahead, it's on me""

I don't know, personally, I think Billy Martin said it best when he said
""Hey! I can drive!"", because we tried to be nice to you non-smokers
We fucking tried, okay?
You wanted your own sections in the restaurants, we gave you that

But that wasn't enough for you, then you wanted the airplanes
We gave you the whole God damn plane! You happy now?
You own the fucking plane! I'd like an explanation about that one folks
Because I will guarantee you if the plane is going down
The first announcement you're gonna hear is

""Folks, this is your Captain speaking, look, uhm, light 'em up
'Cause we're going down, okay, I got a carton of Camels non-filters
I'll see you on the ground, take it easy""
Actually, it'd be more like this, ""This is your Captain speaking""
""Smoke 'em if ya got 'em""

The filters the best part, that's where they put the heroine
Only us real good smokers know that fucking secret
Yeah, we tried to be nice to you non-smokers
But you just fucking badger us, you know? You won't leave us alone

You got all your little speeches you're always giving to us
All these little facts that you dig out of a newspaper or pamphlet
And you store that little nugget in your little fucking head
And we light up and you spew 'em out at us, don't ya?
I love these little facts, these little facts

""Well you know, smoking takes ten years off your life""
Well it's the ten worst years, isn't it folks?
It's the ones at the end! It's the wheelchair, dialysis fucking years
You can have those years! We don't want 'em, alright!?

And I guarantee if I'm still alive then I'll be smoking then
I'll be in my wheelchair, with my adult diapers on
And my twenty-five year old non-smoking born again
Christian son behind me

I'll be going, ""Hey! Make sure you wipe this time
I was itching all week for Christ's sake!
And get me some more wippets
I'm almost out, you fucking pussy! Come on!""

Because you're always telling us
""You know, if you quit smoking now
Every cigarette takes three minutes off your life
If you quit now you can live an extra ten years
If you quit now, you can live an extra twenty years""

Hey, I got two words for you, okay, Jim Fix, remember Jim Fix?
The big famous jogging guy? Jogged fifteen miles a day
Did a jogging book, did a jogging video
And dropped out of a heart attack when?
When he was fucking jogging, that's when!

What do you wanna bet it was two smokers
Who found the body the next morning and went
""Hey! That's Jim Fix, isn't it?"" ""Wow, what a fucking tragedy
Come on, lets go buy some buds""

It's always the yogurt sprout eating mother fuckers
Who get run over by a bus drive by a guy
Who smokes three and a half packs a day
""Sorry officer, I didn't see him, I was too busy smoking!""

He was famous in proverb and famous in rhyme

And his numerous progeny prospers and thrives
And the village is proud of him in his decline
At the sight of that placid and bland physiognomy
When he sits in the sun on the vicarage wall
The oldest inhabitant croaks

Denis Solee,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

To kids from one to ninety-two

Old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine
Same old tingle that I feel inside
Then the elevator starts it ride

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for 
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in

I never knew that you and I were meant to be in love

Of a sermon that no one will hear

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold

Ages ago last night?

On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? That didn't last

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again
I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
A tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you

Uh uh, not guilty!

(He had it coming)
My sister, Veronica and I had this double act
And my husband, Charlie, traveled round with us.
Now, for the last number in our act, 
We did these 20 acrobatic tricks in a row
One, two, three, four, five, splits, spread eagles,
Back flips, flip flops,
One right after the other.
So this one night before the show we are down at the Hotel Cicero,
The three of us, boozin' 
Havin' a few laughs
And we run out of ice
So I go out to get some
I come back, open the door
And there's Veronica and Charlie 
Doing Number Seventeen
The spread eagle
Well, I was in such a state of shock, 
I completely blacked out, I can't remember a thing 
It wasn't until later, 
When I was washing the blood off my hands
I even knew they were dead

They had it coming (they had it coming)
They had it coming (they had it coming)
They had it coming all along
I didn't do it
But if I'd done it
How could you tell me that I was wrong?

They had it coming (they had it coming)
They had it coming (they had it coming)
They had it coming all along (they took a flower in its prime)
I didn't do it (and then they used it)
But if I'd done it
How could you tell me 
That I was wrong?

I loved Al Lipschitz
More than I can possibly say.
He was a real artistic guy...
Sensitive... A painter.
But he was always trying to find himself.
He'd go out every night looking for himself
And on the way
He found Ruth,
Gladys,
Rosemary and Irving
I guess you could say we broke up
Because of artistic differences.
He saw himself as alive
And I saw him dead.

The dirty bum, bum, bum, bum, bum
The dirty bum, bum, bum, bum, bum

They had it coming (they had it coming)
They had it coming (they had it coming)
They had it coming all along
'Cause if they used us ('cause if they used us)
And they abused us (and they abused us)

How could you tell us that we were wrong?

He had it coming (he had it coming)
He had it coming (he had it coming)
He only had himself to blame (he only had himself to blame)
If you'd have been there (if you'd have been there)
If you'd have seen it (if you'd have seen it)
I betcha you would have done the same!

You pop that gum one more time! Single my ass
Ten times! Miert csukott Uncle Same bortonbe

But we just can't stay together; don't you feel it too?
Still I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it. (we can't make it)
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

It's too late baby, it's too late now darling

Denise LaSalle,"Dont mess with my Toot Toot
Dont mess with my Toot Toot
I know you have another woman
So dont mess with my Toot Toot

When I was born in my birth suit
The doctor slap her behind
He said: Youre gonna be special
You sweet little Toot Toot?

So you can look as much
But if you much as touch
Youre gonna have yourself a case
Im gonna break your face

So dont mess with my Toot Toot
Dont mess with my Toot Toot
I know you have another woman
So dont mess with my Toot Toot

Dont mess with my Toot Toot
Dont mess with my Toot Toot

So dont mess with my Toot Toot
