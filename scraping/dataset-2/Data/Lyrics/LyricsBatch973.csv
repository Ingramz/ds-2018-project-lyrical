Sam Moore,"Bright light city gonna set my soul
Gonna set my soul on fire
Got a whole lot of money that's ready to burn,
So get those stakes up higher
There's a thousand pretty women waitin' out there
And they're all livin' devil may care
And I'm just the devil with love to spare
Viva Las Vegas, Viva Las Vegas
How I wish that there were more
Than the twenty-four hours in the day
'Cause even if there were forty more
I wouldn't sleep a minute away
Oh, there's black jack and poker and the roulette wheel
A fortune won and lost on ev'ry deal
All you need's a strong heart and a nerve of steel
Viva Las Vegas, Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas with you neon flashin'
And your one armbandits crashin'
All those hopes down the drain
Viva Las Vegas turnin' day into nighttime
Turnin' night into daytime
If you see it once
You'll never be the same again
I'm gonna keep on the run
I'm gonna have me some fun
If it costs me my very last dime
If I wind up broke up well
I'll always remember that I had a swingin' time
I'm gonna give it ev'rything I've got
Lady luck please let the dice stay hot
Let me shout a seven with ev'ry shot
Viva Las Vegas, Viva Las Vegas,
Viva, Viva Las Vegas",Viva Las Vegas,1997

Sam Moore,"I can't stand the pain of love
When you get all the love
I can't stand the pain of life
I can't even stand the shock. 
But when I hear you say
That you will go away
And leave me someday
I can't stand itI can't stand it
I can't stand itI can't stand it
When you stand close to me
You makes me kind of weak
And when you hold me tight
My poor heart skips a beat
And when I hear you say
That you will go away
And leave me someday
I can't stand it 
When you're standin' close to me
You make me kinda weak
And when you hold me tight
My poor heart skips a beat
And when I hear you say
That you will go away
And leave me someday
I can't stand it

Sam Moore,"When I became of age my mother called me to her side,
She said,""Son, you're growing up now pretty soon you'll take a bride.
And then she said, ""Just because you've become a young man now,
There's still somethings that you don't understand now,
Before you ask some girl for her hand now
Keep your freedom for as long as you can now.""

My mama told me, ""You better shop around, (shop, shop)
Oh yeah, you better shop around."" (shop, shop around)

Ah, there's somethings that I want you to know now.
Just as sure as the winds gonna blow now
The women come and the women gonna go now
Before you tell em that you love em so now.

My mama told me, ""You better shop around, (shop, shop)
Oh yeah, you better shop around."" (shop, shop around)

A-try to get yourself a bargain son.
Don't be sold on the very first one.
A-pretty girls come a dime a dozen,
A-try to find one who's gonna give you true lovin'

Before you take a girl and say I do, now,
Make sure she's in love with-a you now.
My mama told me, ""You better shop around.""

Ooh yeah, a-try to get yourself a bargain son.
Don't be sold on the very first one.
A-pretty girls come a dime a dozen,
A-try to find one who's gonna give you true lovin'.

Before you take a girl and say I do, now,
Make sure she's in love with-a you now.
Make sure that her love is true now.
I hate to see you feelin' sad and blue now.""

My mama told me, ""You better shop around (shop, shop)
Don't let the first one get you
Oh no cause I don't want to see her with you
Before you let her hold you tight, ah yeah make sure shes alright
Before you let her take your hand my son
Understand my son, be a man my son I know you can I love you""",Shop Around,2002
Sam Moore,"Stop, baby can't you see that I can't take it no more 
Stop, if you keep it up I'm gonna go through floor 
Never knew how good love could be 
Love's gonna make a fool of me 
Everything is hazy 
One more kiss could drive me crazy 

Stop, hold it just a minute, ‘cause I got to catch my breath 
Stop, every time you squeeze me you scare my heart half to death 
Thought I was the captain of my ship 
But your love has made me lose my grip 
Everything is hazy 
One more kiss could drive me crazy 

I never knew how good a love could be 
Love's gonna make a fool of me 
Everything is hazy 
One more kiss could drive me crazy 

Stop, I think you're trying to take advantage of poor ol' me 
Stop, when you touch my hand I'm helpless as I can be 
Tell me baby, what are you made of? 
What you do to me sure must be made of love 
Everything is hazy 
One more kiss could drive me crazy 
Yes, it will 

Stop, stop, stop",Stop,2002
Sam Moore,"There's a spot in my heart,
Which no colleen may own.
There's a depth in my soul,
Never sounded or known;

There's a place in my mem'ry,
My life, that you fill,
No other can take it,
No one ever will.

[Chorus]
Sure, I love the dear silver
That shines in your hair,
And the brow that's all furrowed,
And wrinkled with care.
I kiss the dear fingers,
So toil-worn for me,
Oh, God bless you and keep you,
Mother Machree.

Ev'ry sorrow or care
In the dear days gone by,
Was made bright by the light
Of the smile in your eye,

Like a candle that's set
In the window at night,
Your fond love has cheered me
And guided me right.

[Chorus]

You're bringing back sweet memories
Hey, window pain do you remember
How sweet it used to be

Sam Moore,"This ain't comin' from no prophet,
Just an ordinary man.
When I close my eyes,
I see the way this world shall be
When we all walk hand in hand.
When the last child cries for a crust of bread,
When the last man dies for just words that he said,
When there's shelter over the poorest head,
We shall be free.
When the last thing we notice is the color of the skin,
And the first thing we look for is the beauty within;
When the skies and the oceans are clean again,
Then we shall be free.
We shall be free, we shall be free.
Stand straight, walk proud,
'Cause we shall be free.
When we're free to love anyone we choose,
When this world's big enough for all different views,
When we all can worship from our own kind of pew,
Then we shall be free.
We shall be free, we shall be free
Have a little faith, hold out,
'Cause we shall be free.
And when money talks for the very last time,
And nobody walks a step behind;
When there's only one race,
And that's mankind, then we shall be free.
We shall be free ,we shall be free
Stand straight, (walk proud,)
Have a little faith, (hold out;)
We shall be free.
We shall be free, we shall be free,
(Stand straight,) stand straight,
(Have a little faith,) walk proud,
'Cause we shall be free.",We Shall Be Free,2006

On one cold and cloudy day

Hymns of faith that made us strong

Sam Moore,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Sam Most,"In my imagination, I'm finding consolation
Somewhere along the Rio Grande
Sadly I'm reminiscing, madly again I'm kissing
Someone along the Rio Grande
 
It happened in Monterey, a long time ago
I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I'm afraid that it was mine
It happened in Monterey
Without thinking twice
I left her and threw away the key to paradise
My indiscreet heart, longs for the sweetheart 
That I left in old Monterey
 
Making believe I'm merry
In ev'ry glass of sherry
I see the sparkle of her eye
And when I hear the cello
Tender and sweet and mellow
I hear the music of her sigh

It happened in Monterey, a long time ago
I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I'm afraid that it was mine
It happened in Monterey

Sam Most,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

It might as well be spring",It Might as Well Be Spring,1976
Sam Most,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

When we were young last night",Last Night When We Were Young,1976
Sam Most,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

Sam Most,"In my solitude
You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

I sit in my chair
And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love
I sit in my chair

Filled with despair
There's no one, no one
No onecould be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

Come on and trade in your old dreams for new
Your new dreams for old
I know where they're bought

Midnight, you've got to get there at midnight
And you'll be met there by others like you
Brothers as blue
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams

On the street of dreams

All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure

Midnight, look at the steeple, it's midnight
Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer

I feel your lips, so warm and tender,

Sam Outlaw,"She was driving last Friday on her way to Cincinnati on a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her mama and her daddy with the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go, and she was running low on faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind, and she didn't pay attention
She was going way too fast
Before she knew it she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
And save me from this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel

It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said, ""I'm sorry for the way
I've been living my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight

Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
And save me from this road I'm on.""

Oh, Jesus, take the wheel

Oh, I'm letting go
So give me one more chance

And a worn out man living on an old barstool
He lost everything, but he ain't no fool

There's a love that haunts him like the holy ghost
He can tune it out, but it still comes through
'Cause he's got a tenderheart beating for you
There's a tenderheart beating for you

There's a tenderheart beating for you
Never loved another, never was untrue

Do you let it move you to a tenderheart beating for you?

If the day made me heavy and gravity won
If I was the red and you were the blue
I could just fade into you
If you were a window and I was the rain
I’d pour myself out and wash off the pain
I’d fall like a tear so your light could shine through
Then I’d just fade into you

In your heart in your head in your
Arms in your bed under your skin

Til there’s no way to know where
You end and where I begin

If I was a shadow and you were a
Street

The cobblestone midnight is where
We first meet

Til the lights flickered out, we
Dance with the moon

Then I’d just fade into you

In your heart in your head in your
Arms in your bed under your skin

Til there’s no way to know where
You end and where I begin

I wanna melt in I wanna soak through
I only wanna move when you move

I wanna breathe out when you
Breathe in then I wanna fade into you

If I was just ashes and you were
The ground

And under your willow they laid me
Down

There’ll be no trace that one was
Once two

I use my blindfold to dry my tears

But when I do the fan dance
I'm all the red in China
I'm dialing life up on my telescope
Fringe and mathematics
Shaking down the curtain
To find the dragon parade

When I do the fan dance
Searchlights answer gunfire
Angels escort falling mercies
Hearts shut off like streetlights
But even in the blackout
I'll find my balcony rose

I use my blindfold to dry the tears
The stage is empty and tired of light

When I do the fan dance

I burn with no trace up in the cold sky
I am broken open, waiting for inventions
Of light that see through to love

I'll be in your dark streets
To keep the lantern burning
Until your new world begins

You like to watch me and I like to disappear

How much can you loose?

Bought himself a little property

His rose-coloured glasses cut through the fog

And for sixty days I knew no other road
And through the maelstrom, which turned in time with the kick drum

And I've spent seven years and a sea of fears in this broken mirror of a city

And I remember feeling alright
And I saw black clouds and Turin shrouds and it smelled of a faded empire
It's all concrete and steel, we're asleep at the wheel, and the mayor's just a gun for hire

Listen to the sound there's a time bomb ticking in the city

Outside the gate is everything

Deep down to my soul
You try to keep the wheel steady now
Easy as she goes
I can hear on the wind a tale that needs to be told again
The horizon bends at either end and the sea can't tell a foe from a friend

I know it was only a dream
As delicate as a dragonfly wing

I was never satisfied with any life 'til she called my name
The air on the high ground was rarefied, every day the same
And old fears were always near but when we set sail they disappeared
There are those who fear the deep but the world don't wait when your faith won't leap

And I know it was only a dream
As delicate as a dragonfly wing

Then we watched as the Southern Cross led the sailors home, constellation borne
We set sail in a heavy gale and to the sea many of us thrown
And there were times when my courage failed but I never bowed to the storm
Whatever path you choose to walk, in the end, you walk alone

Ooh, it's got me mystified heavy now
Tongue-tied to the anchor chain
You try to keep your hand steady now
But it slips again
And landfall surprised us all and she broke on the rocks like a china doll
You can hear the siren call for the last dance at Poseidon's Ball

I never did what I was told
That old fire rages on

It only takes one soul to make a change
It takes two young hearts to make it beat again

That there's nothing more beautiful
Than a face as it starts to fade

Led me to concede that I'd been losing sleep
And I'm tired and frayed at the seams
And things are changing in me
It's been two hard months since I could call you my own
It cuts to the bone

But I was always the thorn to your rose
Some doors are better left closed

You move like a rolling wave
One that don't fade when it's gone
Beyond a doubt it gets so hard that a stone would cry out

I know there's a lesson in here
But it's so hard to find
I've been searching my mind
A little pearl of wisdom for the later years
When the thread of this life starts to unwind
I never had to fight for my love
But that's over I know
It's just how it goes
I never had to fight for my love

Sam Roberts,"I went walking at street level
Feeling strange and disheveled
Past the abattoir and the glory holes
Like a film noire in the starring role

To the side streets, kept my nose clean
Tasted beautiful, tasted obscene
Singing, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

This is Detroit, see the skyline
A commotion on the assembly line
Raise a glass to the ambassador
As she's moving you to the dance floor

Does anyone here tonight
Remember those times?
Can anyone here tonight
Just tell me what they felt like?

So many years, so many lives
These are the streets where they collide
From Jimmy Hoffa to Cadillac
Some look ahead, I'm going back
'Cause I'm just looking for some sounds
To ease the vice that squeezes us every day

This was Motown, this was New France
Where the Chippewa did the fire dance
That was long ago, this is here and now
But the memory still remains somehow
Singing, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I can't tell you how this old story ends
I can't touch you now, like they did back then
Past the child's play with the jump rope
Hear the gun play, it's a tightrope

Does anyone here tonight
Remember those times?
Can anyone here tonight
Just tell me what they felt like?

Does anyone here tonight
Remember those times?
Somebody call the riot police
There's trouble down on 12th Street

Sam Roberts,"Witness the end of the empire, the Romans of our time
Start little fires then they get too high
You fan the flames and they still remain
Long after you lose desire

Then a breakdown turns to a heart attack
And it's far too late, you'll never bring it back
You can take what you want from me
But you better believe that I can see you

Watch the sun set on the empire
One last round as it goes down
Start a little fire in your best attire
You can blame the gin for the mess you're in
Take a pension and retire

Then a breakdown turns to a heart attack
And it's far too late, you'll never bring it back
You can take what you want from me
But you better believe that I can see you

Stick to your guns when the bullets fly
Stick to the wall when the light sweeps by
Stick in the mud over one in the eye

One part breaks it was made defective

Six feet down being resurrected

Brace for the aftermath

Sam Roberts Band,"I went walking at street level
Feeling strange and disheveled
Past the abattoir and the glory holes
Like a film noire in the starring role

To the side streets, kept my nose clean
Tasted beautiful, tasted obscene
Singing, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

This is Detroit, see the skyline
A commotion on the assembly line
Raise a glass to the ambassador
As she's moving you to the dance floor

Does anyone here tonight
Remember those times?
Can anyone here tonight
Just tell me what they felt like?

So many years, so many lives
These are the streets where they collide
From Jimmy Hoffa to Cadillac
Some look ahead, I'm going back
'Cause I'm just looking for some sounds
To ease the vice that squeezes us every day

This was Motown, this was New France
Where the Chippewa did the fire dance
That was long ago, this is here and now
But the memory still remains somehow
Singing, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I can't tell you how this old story ends
I can't touch you now, like they did back then
Past the child's play with the jump rope
Hear the gun play, it's a tightrope

Does anyone here tonight
Remember those times?
Can anyone here tonight
Just tell me what they felt like?

Does anyone here tonight
Remember those times?
Somebody call the riot police
There's trouble down on 12th Street

Start little fires then they get too high
You fan the flames and they still remain
Long after you lose desire

Then a breakdown turns to a heart attack
And it's far too late, you'll never bring it back
You can take what you want from me
But you better believe that I can see you

Watch the sun set on the empire
One last round as it goes down
Start a little fire in your best attire
You can blame the gin for the mess you're in
Take a pension and retire

Then a breakdown turns to a heart attack
And it's far too late, you'll never bring it back
You can take what you want from me
But you better believe that I can see you

You can run but you can't hide
From that feeling buried deep inside

Hold your lover and your secrets tight

Stick to your guns when the bullets fly
Stick to the wall when the light sweeps by
Stick in the mud over one in the eye

Sam Roberts Band,"These words don't come easy
They spit from my lips
Then we never had it easy
It slipped from our fingertips

When we met, you laughed at me
And stole my last cigarette
Said you wanted to share a past with me
Tomorrow's the day to forget
And you said

Just give me a reason
To carry on, to carry on
Just give me a reason
To carry on, to carry on

Now I've come unhinged
I'm a door in a frame
Well, I'm never quite closed
But I ain't open to change

So my knuckles are bruised
From knocking on wood
Well, it's a trick that I've used
Perhaps more than I should
And I said

Just give me a reason
To carry on, to carry on
Just give me a reason
To carry on, to carry on

?Cause a heart is just a heart
It can break and fall apart
It can bleed and stop and start
?Cause a heart is just a heart

Mix your words with fire
I'll let them burn me down
Let them ring in the air
Like the bells of an old mining town

Just give me a reason
To carry on, to carry on
Just give me a reason
To carry on, to carry on

Just give me a reason
To carry on, to carry on
Just give me a reason
To carry on, to carry on

Just give me a reason
To carry on, to carry on
Just give me a reason
To carry on, to carry on

Just give me a reason
To carry on, to carry on
I just want a reason
To carry on, to carry on

Let it break the fever, and relieve the strain

No one ever told me it would be like this
Sundown til the morning rise
Starting my day with a moonlight kiss
And I was born on a precipice
Between salvation and the great abyss
I don't think I can go on like this
Putting in time on the graveyard shift

I go to work at sundown
Pick-axe digging into common ground
Night falls but it makes no sound
Duty's calling from the underground

Time to dig down and see what side you're on
Until the dawn the dawn you're soldiering on
Every sundown you gotta be reborn
Come away, come away, come away

Come sit by me and see what I see
When I close my eyes at the edge of sleep
And we dream on the blade of a knife
Following the trail of the afterlife

Now here they come
The night commuters
The midnight hoard
The dawn refuters
They're all here to settle a score
With the phantom limbs and the ghosts of war

Here it come it comes

Handed me a bag of money

I still need you in my life for real
See I'm all alone, the silence in the telephone
Hasn't reached out to touch me lately
Girl, it hurts me so, you just let me go
And I'm slowly losing my mind

Everytime a car drives by I see that look in your eye
Tellin' me that you're gonna be home soon
Everytime a car drives by I see that look in your eye
Tellin' me that you're on your way
Girl, I'm dyin' inside, will you return from your ride
And make everything okay
Till then when a car drives by with that look in your eye
I'll be slowly losin' my mind

Even though I already know you won't be comin' home
Girl, I have to try and stay and fight
For the love I must call my own
I'm still holding on though I know you're gone
I'll probably never hold you close again
Now and then I remember where and when
Girl, I'm slowly losin' my mind

Everytime a car drives by I see that look in your eye
Tellin' me that you're gonna be home soon
Everytime a car drives by I see that look in your eye
Tellin' me that you're on your way
Girl I'm dyin' inside, will you return from your ride
And make everything okay
Till then when a car drives by with that look in your eye
I'll be slowly losin' my mind

Any two doors will do, there's no need for complication
I can't help but feel you, I'm trying to be patient
But every time I'm at my window
The tears fall, the rain falls, my heart calls out
Louder and louder to you

Everytime a car drives by I see that look in your eye
Tellin' me that you're gonna be home soon
Everytime a car drives by I see that look in your eye
Tellin' me that you're on your way
Girl I'm dyin' inside, will you return from your ride
And make everything okay
Till then, when a car drives by with that look in your eye
I'll be slowly losin' my mind

I want my baby, oh yeah, oh baby

Loving girls and taking no names baby

You're driving me crazy, driving me crazy

Now I don't do the things I used to do
I can't explain it but I got a thing for you
Twenty four seven, girl, I'm into my baby

And you can take my car, I ain't trippin'
You can have it all, just give me my baby, give me my baby

And you can have the house that I live in
And you can take all the other women
And you can have it all, just give me my baby, give my my baby

Now take away all my diamond rings
Cause I don't need material things
As long as I've got you
Just me and my baby, me and my baby, yeah

I'll write a song that says I love you
And pray to God that I'll always keep you
You're the one that I want
Just me and you baby, me and you baby

Oh baby, here we go
I wanna be the one at night you hold, babe
Tell your roommate, you're not coming home
There's no need to wait up by the phone

Cause tonight is our night
And everything is gonna be alright
I'm with you and I need you
And baby I just want you to know, know, know

(Verse 1) 
It came unexpected
The birth of your child
Now you've been forced
To provide a way
For you and your baby
You go to work from 9 to 5
You're up at night when the baby cries
Girl, I don't care
Why he left you 
All I know is I love you and your child

I love you both
I'll turn this house into a home
I love you both

I love you both

I love you both
Girl, you need to get with me

(Verse 2) 
The baby has your eyes
Yeah, the baby has your smile
So how can I not love you both
I need you in my life
I'll never walk away from you
I'm here to help you
See this through
What's mine is yours
What's yours is mine
Girl, take it all
'Cause I love you and your child

If it were the real me and you
This wouldn't be the right thing to do
Now the room is all hazy
We're too lost in the fumes
I feel like it's just me and you
Yeah we got nothing to lose

It's too late to run away from it all
It's too late to get away from it all
I'm done with running so I give it to you

Resulting in a reattachment
Will you take me to nirvana?
I don't think this will last
But you're here in my arms

Oh baby, oh baby, oh
We both feel the same
I'm not gonna give you my name
And I don't think you want that to change
We're in this together
We don't know who we are
Even if it's moving too fast
Maybe we should take it too far

It's too late to run away from it all
It's too late to get away from it all

Will you take me to nirvana?
I don't think this will last

You, you enchant me even when you're not around

I feel we're close enough
Could I lock in your love?

Now I’ve got you in my space
I won’t let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I’m latching on to you

I’m so en-captured, got me wrapped up in your touch
Feel so enamored, hold me tight within your clutch
How do you do it, got me losing every breath
What did you give me to make my heart beat out my chest?

That one day I will be, where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, and the stars, are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain, the way I’m missing you
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I’m inside
These tears, they tell their own story

You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling’s overwhelming, it's much too strong
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you’re alright
I’ll take care of you,
And I don’t want to be here if I can’t be with you tonight

I’m reaching out to you
Can you hear my call? (Who's to say you won't hear me?)
This hurt that I’ve been through
I’m missing you, missing you like crazy

I had a dream in a panic you came running out
For a moment you were sure I'd die on you
For a moment I believed you loved me too
But life is never like this, and you're never strong

Too much of a good thing won't be good for long
Although you made my heart sing, to stay with you would be wrong
Too much of a good thing won't be good anymore

We'd talk maybe 20 times a day
And still I never say what I want to say
I thought I wouldn't need to
I guess I read you wrong

Too much of a good thing won't be good for long
Although you made my heart sing, to stay with you would be wrong
Too much of a good thing won't be good anymore
Watch where I tread before I fall

You refuse to see this, don't see it anymore

I'm hitting harder than Berry Boss so check the golden child,
throwing it to your ear-hole, got you going buck wild.
But truck-tracks, rhymes all day, breaking off niggaz proper,
did dirt, did West cause I clown coppers (yeah).
Do hip-hop, rap, compose 'em most, I couldn't see me,
mad advanced and my skills are all about the dollar bills.
From Pittsburgh to Cali dropping bombs like that,
was on the D.L. with the squad so I couldn't hold it back.
Black, I regulate I buzz a big gate figure,
mobbing with the ill nigga, with his finger on a bigger trigger.
Serving all (saps), hitting sevens on the (simps),
making do', eating shrimps, locing with some real pimps (yeah).
So peep game, best believe I love my peeps
that's why I make the type of music you can pump in your jeeps
(that's right).

From napalms to Uzi's I made G's (say what?),
them build up enough Luther by keys.
No gang affiliation, yo I stood on my own to pulling capers
I'm a sneaky slick nigga, I never had to pull the trigger (right).
I mack, and on top and that I'm used to staying wicked with just 24-7,
you can ask my ex-hooker.
But now I'm on some new improved shit,
making hits, stacking chips, now everything's legitimate.
I flipped the scrip a long time ago, on the five-o,
when I had to scope with this new way to make my cash flow (uhm).
Yes indeedy, I wasn't greedy, got my niggaz out the gutter,
now they're rolling with the Sam Sneezy.

And suckers be popping at those idiotic egosytible type of flimflam,

Playing with the hustlers never dealing with the knucklehead bollers,

Ice ice baby
Ice ice baby
All right stop
Collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Then I flow that a harpoon daily and nightly
Will it ever stop?
Yo, I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle

Dance
Bum rush the speaker that booms
I'm killin' your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly, when I play a dope melody
Anything less that the best is a felony
Love it or leave it
You better gain way
You better hit bull's eye 
The kid don't play

Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in, the fingers are pumpin'
Quick to the point, to the point no faking
I'm cooking MC's like a pound of bacon
Burning them if they're not quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo
Rollin in my 5.0
With my ragtop down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby
Waving just to say hi
Did you stop?
No, I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
That block was dead

Yo so I continued to a1a Beachfront Ave
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rock man lovers driving Lamborghini
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps are acting ill because they're so full of eight balls
Gunshots ranged out like a bell
I grabbed my nine
All I heard were shells
Fallin' on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm tryin' to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene
You know what I mean
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem 
Yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla

Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town, that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed
This is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step with this
Shay plays on the fade, slice it like a ninja
Cut like a razor blade so fast
Other DJ's say, ""damn""
If my rhyme was a drug
I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice

Do you remember the times you said to me,
There was nobody else you would ever need?

I cried all of those tears.
What was it that just made our love fade away?

I met a friend of mine just the other day
She was really sorry, I said: ""I'm okay!""
But then she told me 'bout a boy who looked like you
On your harley-d, you were talking to:

Another woman
Another woman

I'm not the kind of girl who would take advice
I'm a self-made lady of my own device
I let the people say what the people want
But I'm asking you, are they right or wrong

Another woman
Another woman

Too many people walk out in the rain
You saved her from drowning
There's no-one to blame
And if I cry me a river

My life stays the same
Got nothing to live for
I'm losing the game
She has got the best of me, my man

Now I believe that water turns to red, red wine
I'd buy every story from you every time
You could even tell me that the world is flat
But I never thought that you would ever have

So I call you up because I'm missing you
I dial your number, baby

What does it mean to dream
Is it staying alive or to fall or rise
So take it to the limit and lets dream on, dream on

I wake up, to find you
To find you next to me
I reach out, yeah
You're there like a vision of ecstasy

But when I wake up
I realise, I'm holding on to a dream

As your, as your shadow moves away

I need you

And if I had to leave this sacred place
I would leave my soul behind
You search your heart and you will find
The answer has been there all the time

Close your eyes and you'll hear my call
Through every high and through every low

And I've been waiting for this moment
For all my life and I'll never let it go

Samantha Moore - Replace You


Taking it day to day

Living without your face

Looking for easy ways

To fill my head

Losing you in a crowd

Keeping the feelings down

So I forget

Where do I go from here


I tried to, tried to replace you

With everything, but nothing seemed to fit

I want to, but I can't replace you

This emptiness is all you've left me with

All this emptiness


Memories start to fade

I'm thinking I'll be okay

Chasing the pain away

But is it gone

All the familiar signs

Are hiding behind my eyes


But I can't move on

Where do I go from here


I tried to, tried to replace you

With everything, but nothing seemed to fit

I want to, but I can't replace you

This emptiness is all you've left me with

All this emptiness


How long will I know this

Feeling I'm broke with

Pretending I'm alright

Cause I'm done with hiding

I wanna get back to life

I wanna get back to life


I tried to, tried to replace you

With everything, but nothing seemed to fit

I want to, but I can't replace you

This emptiness is all you've left me with

All this emptiness

A special feelin' just burst inside

And baby, you're the one for me

But now that I have got you all alone
After all this talkin' on the phone
I should be strong, there's nothing wrong

Like the wind was blowing it apart. 
Had you spinning like a merry-go-round. 
Indications of a storm touching down. 
I wish that I could weather any storm. 
But I guess it was heartbreak from the norm. 
It was a day that I will always remember. 
The saddest day in November.

Lately I've been watching you. 
Been thinking about you baby. 
And everything you do. 
Just sittin' away watching the days go by.

If loving you is right I don't ever want to be wrong.

I realize that my trust ain't coming back no more.

When you really love someone?
When you really care?
It's hard to walk away when I really want to stay with you.
Does anybody know what tears you up inside?
When you try to decide between what's wrong and right? 
Gotta know for sure my trust ain't coming back no more.

But in my mind I know they will still live on and on
But how do you thank someone who has taken you from crayons to perfume?
It isn't easy, but I'll try

If you wanted the sky I would write across the sky in letters
That would soar a thousand feet high 'To Sir, With Love'

The time has come for closing books and long last looks must end
And as I leave I know that I am leaving my best friend
A friend who taught me right from wrong and weak from strong
That's a lot to learn, but what can I give you in return?

But I would rather you let me give my heart 'To Sir, With Love'",To Sir With Love,2002

Tender kiss that never took place?
Feels so good,it's almost real to me.

I just know where we belong

I anticipate the moment that it's gonna be.


No,I can't wait,I need your loving.
And from this day,we'll be together.

I won't let this moment go past,
Am I moving too fast?

So long since I held you tight,
I've been waiting for this moment,and tonight's the night.
Hold on,let's just take our time,

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place you'll feel
There's no hurt or sorrow

There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make it a better place
For you and for me

If you want to know why
There's love that cannot lie
Love is strong
It only cares of joyful giving
If we try we shall see
In this bliss we cannot feel
Fear of dread
We stop existing and start living

The it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing

If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

And the dream we were conceived in
Will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in
Will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this earth, crucify its soul
Though it's plain to see
This world is heavenly
Be god's glow

We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together we cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares

We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place

Well that's fine by me
