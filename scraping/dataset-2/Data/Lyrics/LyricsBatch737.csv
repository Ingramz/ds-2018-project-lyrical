Mind in a Box,"There was this empty shell
And I called it my life
Sometimes it felt like hell
But it was easy to survive

Time was like a drain
That didn't flush me down
There was no room for pain
And not one chance to drown

I want to cut off all my ties
I need to break through all the ice
I want it to evaporate
And cease to be a surrogate

I want to raise a thunderstorm
I want to bring down all the rain
I want to be the flood that cleans
I want to know what my life means

I want to cut off all my ties
I need to break through all the ice
I want it to evaporate
And cease to be a surrogate

I want to find the strength I need
To truly follow my own lead
I want to find my destiny
And know my own identity

Identity, identity
Identity, identity
Identity, identity
Identity, identity

I got up every day
To do as I was told
I felt like a piece of clay
For someone else to mold

My suit fit me just fine
And my shirt was always clean
My thoughts, they were never mine
But there was no need to scream

I looked left and right
And they were all the same
I lay awake at night
And tried to recall my name

I got up the next day
And took a long last look
There was no time to stay
On the first page of this book

I want to cut off all my ties
I need to break through all the ice
I want it to evaporate
And cease to be a surrogate

I want to raise a thunderstorm
I want to bring down all the rain
I want to be the flood that cleans
I want to know what my life means

I want to cut off all my ties
I need to break through all the ice
I want it to evaporate
And cease to be a surrogate

I want to find the strength I need
To truly follow my own lead
I want to find my destiny

Hey, you know a place called ""The Pie""?
No, I know but I can't remember

No, I didn't destroy your door
Yeah, right, I've started already

Is that guy a regular?
Yeah, I'm sure I've seen him before
Who's he talking to?

So you remember
The night when I was following this girl?
What happened that night?
No, I don't know any of the bands on this list
Sleepwalkers? Never heard of, what are they?

I will never believe
How bright it can be

Mind in a Box,"Two days ago I woke up underwater

They were watching me from outside
And somehow I now knew their names
Night and the friend just smiled at me
And then the glass shattered

I awoke in an empty flat that told me nothing
And I knew that I had to get away
White had tried to erase my identity
But the sleepwalkers had saved my mind

Mind in a Box,"I will stay out here tonight
Looking at the starry sky
I haven't been here in a long time
But this place was always there

Whatever happened in the meantime
All the things that just passed it by
I never thought I would come back here
For it to tell me who I am

I could feel it reaching out to me
I might just as well close my eyes now
And feel this place inside myself

And whoever I was
It doesn't matter anymore, I know
All these memories
Hidden deep down below

Though somewhere on the way before
All those things got lost
I know there will be new things
Wherever I may go

So whatever it was
I don't care for it anymore, I know
No time for mourning
'Cause there are new things to sow

And though I thought I knew who I was
It must have been someone else
I don't care what I knew
But I know now it's time to go

And whoever I was
It doesn't matter anymore, I know
All these memories
Hidden deep down below

Mind in a Box,"I look back, so much time

Now it's fine, now it's fine

To find out who I am
And to build a new self, a new self

I look back, so far back
And I know it's all gone
I'm so glad, I'm so glad

I have found a new life
There's a line in my past
Cuts it off like a knife, like a knife

I will kill the machine
Because it has to be done
Get over what I have been
And then never need to run

I will realize my dream
With all the blood in my veins
To fight the machine
Until none of it remains

And everything
Somehow led me to a fresh new start
So little and so much to cure
My pain and to redefine who I am

Now everything is
Leading me right into the future
All the worries of my past are gone
And never coming back again

I look back, so much time
What once was, now it's gone
Now it's fine, now it's fine

I had to find myself
To become who I am
To define my new self, my new self

You used to buy all that sells

To have regrets before you die

But you have to start with a clean slate
You will snap out of your reverie
And you will know it is not too late

You are dreaming of what used to be
You snap out of your reverie

Our capsules barely meet

Like living black numbers

Joined in sweet fury
To anoint the decay
Fragile and reddened in lifelost array",Still Moving Sinews,1997
Mind's I,"Come death of dearling
the claws of the raven hold fast
Enticed and starving
a lustful revenge to the last

Unlight flood the seeker's eye
Come flame or false hope
gifted in spirit as I
Forced upon freedom
Let impulse nor stillness be spared

Fierce tidal tantrum
nourishing rapture within

Come feast or fire
repellent in forceful defence
Unchained, forgiving to none
solemn in swirling embrace",Tidal Tantrum,1997
Mind's I,"Tongues, lost in me
Yours be the sharp and the vile
Glide neath my skin
Storm through my nerves

I bury the nomad years
Hours in the earth
Couldn't exorcise these searing, pecking tongues
Immune you say
Yet venom strikes in strangest guises
As the viper in our eyes
Tongue, throat, tongue
Slayer of the word and stealer of wisdom

A monumental reign of terrors
Throats slit up to stain the target
We're food for the hounds of trauma,
Prey to the crows of stress

No power left to retrieve my stolen language
Filtered through the illiterate fingers of death

Flies
Let sickness be poured
From the cupped hands of bedlam

On account of their brightness
I made friends with the word and the moon
Went with the tide and left for the sound
Of dead instruments thrown out of tune

The red square patterns, dragonrise and
Evenclaw
Decoying from pandemonic symmetry

Let ring
A dissonant note in the music of the spheres
The streak of promise in the nuclear sky
These whipping black tongues
Aching to lick me back to life
To inject their truths within me",Tongues,1997
Mind's I,"Crown the impulse that deliberately fall

Zodiackyl light

Cross the sharpest void
Deride the embers of his faith
The bringer that on million horses ride

Waiting for the call within the spark of sin
Ever reminiscent of the coming of storm
Can you see the cosmic face in which disorder lies

Burning of oppression
The inventor
Is the killing hand
Be that of the darkest sin
To frustrate hope and love

I shall not be blinded
I shall not be forced

Resistance
Feasting on debris from celestial wars

Burning in the sky
Beyond the realm of time
Sequence of the nucleus
The glowing dust in flight

And they ride, they ride
The drama takes the lead
The beast of heaven their guide

Racing through the vastness
Constellation disarray

That bares no witness to the light

Perpetually pronge through interior vaults
So seamless
Joints of time cannot shackle the beast

And you need some discipline
But, lately you've been trying real hard
And giving me your best
And, you give me the most gorgeous sleep
That I've ever had
And when it's really bad
I guess it's not that bad

Tossing and turning, my love 
Wanna kiss you, wanna hold you real tight 
Ooo but I wonder love whether you know or not 
You just hurry away, leaving me laying there in shock 

I just wanna be the one that you wanna see 
I just wanna have you near me 
But you fly away almost everyday 
You work a lot but you never stop to love 

Stop, I love you so stop 
Come home from the road 
Gotta stop to love 
And let's celebrate, celebrate the love we got, stop 
Say you're coming home 

You say my love has always been on your mind 
But how can I ever love you, when you keep working overtime? 
Too many empty nights, can make almost any guy roam 
to look for the love he don't get whenever he's at home alone. 

Awaiting the day that you're coming to stay 
I hate to see you go away, but you couldn't rest 
Had to do your best to reach the top 
But you did not stop to love 

Stop, I love you so stop 
Come home from the road 
Gotta stop to love 
And let's celebrate, celebrate the love we got, stop 
Say you're coming home

And one day you'll discover I'm the one who love ya 
Gotta stop to love 
No one loves you better 
Can't you stay forever? 
Stop to love 
I can hardly stand the loneliness 
Come on home, that's what it's all about 
You really turn me out

I've got my stocking and the mistletoe
And Santa baby's on the radio

Got Jimmy Stewart smiling at me
I've got my home baked apple pie
Feels good to be in tonight

And I, I can't wait for Christmas
No I, I can't wait for Christmas

The mood is right and the lights are low
I make my angels in the snow
I've got the star at the top of the tree

The Christmas lights, they shine outside
I know the time is drawing near
It's my favorite time of the year

Mindi Abair and The Boneshakers ,"By the fire with a glass of wine
The snow is falling and I'm feeling fine
I've got my stocking and the mistletoe
And Santa baby's on the radio

I've got my wreath, I've got my tree
Got Jimmy Stewart smiling at me
I've got my home baked apple pie
Feels good to be in tonight

And I, I can't wait for Christmas
No I, I can't wait for Christmas

The mood is right and the lights are low
I make my angels in the snow
I've got the star at the top of the tree
It's shining brightly down on me

The gifts are wrapped, the bows are tied
The Christmas lights, they shine outside
I know the time is drawing near
It's my favorite time of the year

And I, I can't wait for Christmas
No I, I can't wait for Christmas

And I, I can't wait for Christmas
No I, I can't wait for Christmas

And I, I can't wait, no I, I can't wait
I, I can't wait for Christmas, for Christmas
I can't wait for Christmas, for Christmas

Mindi Brizendine,"Now you say you're lonely
You cried the whole night through
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Go on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river............over you

I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me

I found a heart just a little bit truer

Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me

Come on along and listen to, the lullaby of Broadway
The hip hooray and ballyhoo, the lullaby of Broadway
The rumble of a subway train, the rattle of the taxis
The daffydils who entertain, at Angelo's and Maxi's
When a Broadway baby says good night, it's early in the morning
Manhattan babies don't sleep tight until the dawn:

Good night, baby
Good night, milkman's on his way
Sleep tight, baby
Sleep tight, let's call it a day. Hey!

You rock-a-bye your baby round, 'til everything gets hazy
Hush-a-bye I'll buy you this and that, you hear a daddy saying

Then she closes her eyes and drifts into a dream

Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas

Children laughing, people passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you hear

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them sing
Soon it will be Christmas day

Strings of street lights, even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures

Hear the snow crunch, see the kids bunch
This is Santa's big scene
And above all this bustle you hear

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them sing
Soon it will be Christmas day

But I wait by the phone for her call

Precipitates no change at all

Hiding away his tears
And when the guns are set to go
Death whispers in his ear - nada

Gates of the heaven sealed

Tuesday I am fading
And By Wednesday I can't sleep
Then the phone rings I hear you
And the darkness is a clear view
Cause you've come to rescue me

Fall, with you I fall so fast
I can hardly catch my breath
I hope it lasts

It seems like I can finally
Rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels
It's as if you know me better
Than I ever knew myself
I love how you can tell
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me

I am moody and messy
I get restless and it's senseless
How you never seem to care

When I'm angry, you listen
Make me happy, its your mission
And you won't stop till I'm there.

Fall, sometimes I fall so fast
When I hit that bottom crash
You're all I have

It seems like I can finally
Rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels
It's as if you know me better
Than I ever knew myself
I love how you can tell
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me

How do you know?
Everything I'm about to say
Am I that obvious?
And if it's written on my face
I hope it never goes away
Yea

On a Monday I am waiting
By Tuesday I am fading
Into your arms
So I can breathe

It seems like I can finally
Rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels

Wish I could say the save the world, like I was super girl
The real me is to laugh all night lying in the grass just talking about love
But lately I've been jaded life got so complicated

I'm still thinking about it almost forgot what it was like
Do you know what it feels like?
'Cause with you
I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground
With nothing but a T-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby as I do now
Now that I'm with you
With you
Now that I'm with you

You speak and it's like a song
And just like that all my walls come down
It's like a private joke just meant for us to know
I relate to you naturally

Just knowing you found me

Running down in the maze of the day

This is a new phase
Don't be commercial or sell out
Or get the hell out of this business
But I won't be caught in that net of suckers
And glass people
Weak, beaten down and feeble

Society probably wants me to give up
Society probably wants me to give up
As I live up to be my best
In a test, a fight for death
As I fight for my very last breath

Gotta be strong but wait a minute
Now, could I be better? Now, could I be better?
Well, only I know
Well, what about you? Or do you have a clue?

Could?ve, would?ve, should've, it?s too late
Could?ve, would?ve, should've, it?s too late
Why you waiting, laying? Sit there, move

Be your own person
Be your own person
Be your own person
Be your own person

Wake up, make up your mind
Seek the knowledge that you will find
Be your own person

Wait for it from the weak
'cause they make the people level
And with you, make a team
So believe and be your best
'cause this is a test

Go for the top chart, rock with all your heart
Non- stop, stay up, go
Deal with what's going on in this crazy world

Man, woman, child, boy, girl, insane to the playing
Love music power pain, be what you gotta do
Get the knowing attitude 'cause this is the test
That we suggest

Be your own person
Be your own person
Be your own person
Be your own person

'cause this is, this is, this is, this is, this is
This is, this is a test, test, test, test, test, test
Test, test, test

'cause we all know who is the real victim
Society does not want them picked on
Labeled or staked, don't raise his guilt
But don't miss your boot and kick them

Faceless in the morning in their urban plight
Felt like a symbol with every situation
Any one tour already overcrowded
Project nation, more inflation

Better your damn situation
But how can you better your situation
If you have no occupation?

Ten of us said, watch the Rolodex center
See how many different schools you can enter
They're out turning in the pit but life?s a bitch
The world?s unconcerned, I?ll tell you why it stuck in a ditch
You own the key to the damn city but it?s a damn pity

Waist-high
Can't clean it
I mean it
We get what we deserve
Rainy mornings
Dry evenings
It's growing
On my nerves
Just gases
You fascists
You get what you deserve
You get what you deserve
You get instead the isle of man
The isle of man

This letter
So no one
Will forget
Some future

Will find these notes an isle of man

Far into the deeper water 
Show me how, show me how 
For I have longed to love deep water 

I was washed up on the shore 
You take me out in the water once more 

Slowly, I cannot swim fast 
And I know, neither can you 
We'll float, let all the clouds pass by 
You and I, you and I 
You and I, you and I

Did she bring you out here too

How does it go down, when you're the biggest kid in your own playground 
And how do you see me, how do I fit in your hierarchy? 
Oh you tell the girls line up in single file, just gotta rearrange my denial 
So I can play with you, and now I see, all the shit that isn't me 
I'm too relieved to be mad, relieved and sad 

I misplaced my mind, thought it was lost 
But now I find, you were just very, very unkind

And coming back down to earth?

Not drowning in somebody's wake
Not smiling for somebody's sake

It beats me why you disappear, honey

Still up all night 'til break of day
You dance me across the kitchen floor
You still got one eye on the door

How you love me with them halfway eyes
And when I think there's nothing left
I think of love and all the time it buys

In a million years seems to last all night

Last time you fell in love

You're askin' the wrong kind of questions
The wrong kind of questions will keep
You askin' me, askin' me for love

You askin' me, askin' me for love
You askin' me, askin' me for love
You askin' me, askin' me for love

If love is the answer you seek
You're asking the wrong kind of questions
If love is the answer you seek
You're asking the wrong kind of questions

If love is the answer you seek
You're asking the wrong kind of questions
If love is the answer you seek
You're asking the wrong kind of questions

Minnie Riperton,"Blowing softly through a meadow 
Laughing like a baby, breeze tapping 
lightly at the treetops, whispering among the leaves 

You hear the magic song, that ancient poets sing 
It's sweet as morning dew and sounds a lot like springtime 
When you close your eyes 
You feel your heat go there 
So close your eyes and you may find that 
Fireflies were as bright as stars; 
Close your eyes and remember 
Summertime lingered on and on 
Close your eyes and remember 
Your first love made the world stand still 
Close your eyes and remember 
Close your eyes and remembers when 
The moon was made of cheese 

Racing swiftly through the mountains 
Bubbling along the stream 
Sighing sweetly through the hollow 
Gentle as an infant's dream",Close Your Eyes and Remember,1970
Minnie Riperton,"(c. stepney)

Sail out of the dawn glide past the day
Drift into the mist float far away
Lift up the latch
Squeaks of the past, dull lighted patch
Sail sideways to morning backwards till noon

Climb into your head, look where you dare
Sit on every snowflake kissing air
Roam deep in the canyons beyond time
Reach through every curtain clouding mind

Greet each blinking dot before your eyes
Weep with tender rose petals sighs
Slip under the crack beneath your door
Stepl over the line where sky meets shore
",Memory Band,1970
Minnie Riperton,"(C. Stepney - R. Rudolph)

Only in the time it takes to tell you
For not to tell, but to know is wrong
Only in the time it takes to want you
I've known it all by myself to long
Only in the time it takes to tease you
Don't be dismayed by my subtle ways
Only in the time it takes to kiss you
I've wasted so may precious days
I've known too long
This can't go on

Now that I have found a way it's up to me
Oh, by the way
Oh, by the way
Oh, by the way

Minnie Riperton,"(m. riperton r. rudolph)

The ripples run into the sun
And your smile blends with the clouds that flutter by me
As I sit on the edge of a dream
What do I see? what do I see?

I see the children playing in the sun
And there is love enough for each and everyone
As I sit on the edge of a dream
That's what I see! that's what I see!

Things that might be, if we look we just might see
Paint the world so brightly, let our freedom ring

Merry-go-round without a sound
I hear your song in the breeze that rock-a-byes me
As I sit on the edge of a dream
What do I see? what do I see?

I see the lord inside of everyone
Can it be my dream will really come
As I sit on the edge of a dream
That's what I see! that's what I see!

Things that might be, if we look we just might see
Paint the world so brightly, let our freedom ring

And here comes the morning sun
I wonder if my dream will really come
As I site on the edge of a dream
That's what I see! that's what I see!

Minnie Riperton,"The reasons for my life are in a million faces
Like aching promises I feel them in my bones
Slipping through my fingers to dance upon the road
The reasons for my life are more than I can hold
But oh, the sweet delight to sing with all my might
To spark the inner light of wonder burning bright
You're not alone
You're not alone

The reasons for my life are buried in deep places
Words once could awaken them
These seeds that I have sown
Ringing through the madness to crash against the cold
The reasons for my life cannot be bought or sold

The reasons for my life are filling all my spaces
Like rushing waters flow, they carry me along
Twisting through my memory to pull free from the load
The reasons for my life are more than I was told",Reasons,1974

Watch the fire die
See the snowflakes fly
Hear the geese out honking' on the bay
Feel the fire's flame
Do they sigh your name
Think of you, my love, so far away

Once I never moved without you
I held on to you all the time
But now that I'm three days without you
I feel a lot like cryin'

And I search the skies
For a sign of you thinking of me

Crystal bells I love to hear ring,

Just like two birds of a feather do;
Life's such a pleasure with you.

Wand we will ride stormy through;
Until each grey sky turns blue.

Though no riches to speak of,
We possess the world's most priceless: love.
Heaven sent us something special from above.

Happiness is layin' by your side;
And there's still so many dreams we've yet to try.

Minnie Riperton,"They call it stormy Monday
Lord, but Tuesday's just as bad
I heard somebody call it stormy Monday
I'm here to let you hear that tuesday's just as bad

Now the eagle flies on friday (that's right)
Each and every Saturday I go out to play
The eagle flies on Friday
Each and every Saturday I go out to play
Not one but every, hey

Not three but every Sunday morning I go to church get down on my knees and pray

Though I'm tryin' and tryin' to find my baby
Won't someone please send her home to me",Stormy Monday,1997
Minnie Riperton,"You thought the leaden winter would bring you down forever
But you rode upon a steamer to the violence of the sun

And the colors of the sea blind your eyes with trembling mermaids
And you touch the distant beaches with tales of brave Ulysses
How his naked ears were tortured by the sirens sweetly singing
For the sparkling waves are calling you to kiss their white laced lips

And you see a girl's brown body dancing through the turquoise
And her footprints make you follow where the sky loves the sea
And when your fingers find her, she drowns you in her body
Carving deep blue ripples in the tissues of your mind

The tiny purple fishes run laughing through your fingers
And you want to take her with you to the hard land of the winter

Her name is Aphrodite and she rides a crimson shell
And you know you cannot leave her for you touched the distant sands
With tales of brave Ulysses, how his naked ears were tortured
By the sirens sweetly singing

The tiny purple fishes run lauging through your fingers
And you want to take her with you to the hard land of the winter",Tales of Brave Ulysses,1997
Minnie Riperton,"Things I say and do may not come clear through
My words may not convey just what I'm feelin'
But I, I hope hope you'll recognize what's right before your eyes
Oh, your heart should realize from where I'm dealin'

Baby, I'm tryin' to show you that I love you
Baby, I'm tryin' to show you that I care
Baby, I'm tryin' to tell you that I, I need you
Baby, I'm tryin' to tell you that I care

Oh, you may not understand just why I show my hand
The method to my madness you inspire
Perception is the key, it's evident, you see
What this is all about is love entire

Baby, I'm tryin' to show you that I love you
Baby, I'm tryin' to show you that I care
Baby, I'm tryin' to tell you that I, I need you
Baby, I'm tryin' to tell you that I care

And all I know is true
Is this love I have for you
And all I know is true is

Baby, I'm tryin' to show you that I love you
Baby, I'm tryin' to show you that I care
Baby, I'm tryin' to tell you that I, I need you
Baby, I'm tryin' to tell you that I care

And all I know is true
Is this love I have for you
And all I know is true
Is this love I have for you
And all I know is true is

My cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine
In a cafe or sometimes on a crowded street
I've been near you, but you never noticed me
My cherie amour, won't you tell me how could you ignore
That behind that little smile I wore
How I wish that you were mine

Then suddenly you're crossed 
You're so moody, you get to me 
Still can't turn you off 
You're fascinating, more fascinating 
Than the dark side of the moon 
You're so exciting, that I'm re-writing 
The book of love called ""You""

Minnie Tee,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
 
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee",Me and Bobby McGee,2000
Minnie Tee,"Of things I should be thankful for I've had a goodly share 
And as I sit here in the comfort of my cozy chair 
My fancy takes me to a humble eastside tenement 
Three flights up in the rear to where my childhood days were spent 
It wasn't much like Paradise but 'mid the dirt and all 
There sat the sweetest angel, one that I fondly call 

My yiddishe momme I need her more then ever now 
My yiddishe momme I'd like to kiss that wrinkled brow 
I long to hold her hands once more as in days gone by 
And ask her to forgive me for things I did that made her cry 
How few were her pleasures, she never cared for fashion's styles 
Her jewels and treasures she found them in her baby's smiles 
Oh I know that I owe what I am today 
To that dear little lady so old and gray 
To that wonderful yiddishe momme of mine 

My yiddishe momme I need her more then ever now 
My yiddishe momme I'd like to kiss that wrinkled brow 
I long to hold her hands once more as in days gone by 
And ask her to forgive me for things I did that made her cry 
How few were her pleasures, she never cared for fashion's styles 
Her jewels and treasures she found them in her baby's smiles

To that wonderful yiddishe momme of mine",My Yiddishe Momme,2000
Minnie Tee,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues,2000
Mino,"Je n'ai appris qu'à perdre, qu'à mettre les mains dans la merde 
Qu'à n'être rien dans ma tête, qu'à faire la guerre qu'à mes frères 
Qu'à voir ma mère dans les dettes, qu'ils aillent se faire mettre, mec, t’inquiètes 
Le petit nègre sera riche avant qu'on l'enterre 
Je n'ai qu'un seul maître, qu'un seul modèle, pour être loin de votre matériel 
Et prêt de l'amour maternel, moi ma guerre à l'heure où on te parle qu'en modem, 
C'est niquer le système où on t'apprend à vivre au singulier mais plus au pluriel 
Plus rien sur terre m'attire, on s'écoute que quand ça tire 
La colombe ici s'enterre et les corbeaux s'en tirent 
La paix est une cause militaire qui sauve des vies pétrolières 
Car je ne vois tomber que des missiles de leur canadair 
Entre crises alimentaires et bavures policières 
Normal qu'avec tous ces poulets, les blocks aient la grippe aviaire 
Je déteste Marine comme Diam's mais encore pire son père 
Car je suis Tookie Williams et lui Schwarzenegger 
Aujourd'hui ils nous parlent tous des bienfaits des colonies 
Dès qu'on leur dit qu'on est français, ils nous disent d'arrêter nos calomnies 
Ils nous ont mis loin de leur économie
Et puis s'étonnent que nos petits ne veulent que le RMI 
He ouais l'ami, je rappe comme un coup de gun venu de ces coups de gueule 
Où les paliers sont des plateaux télé de Jerry Springer 
Un rap qui vient du cœur, un rap de prolétaire, 
Dis toi que pour eux je serai au rap ce que Bruel est au pocker 

Tant que Dieu me donne la chance de vivre, 
Tant que Dieu me donne la force d'être libre, 
Je rappe le ghetto 

Tant que Dieu me donne la chance de vivre, 
Tant que Dieu me donne la force d'être libre, 
Je rappe le ghetto 

Je rappe la noiceur de mon épiderme 
La famine d'un frigidaire 
Le silence d'un solitaire 
La lame d'un suicidaire 
L'histoire changée au cutter 
Les larmes d'un jugé à tort 
Celles de nos miradors 
La sueur de mes disques d'or 
La poésie du mesquine 
La poésie du Uzi 
La poésie de Mesrine 
La poésie anti skin 
Les dés pipés de l’État 
La fin des temps et ses signes 
L'état des frères m'guettah 
Nos pères tués à l'usine 
L'énorme manque de caille 
L'énorme manque de médailles 
La marque sur le dos du bétail 
La sincérité de Chiens de Paille

Tu veux savoir, dans l'idéal, mec, je rappe la persévérance 
Partage mes errances, en gras, marque ma différence. 
Je rappe par déférence. Hommage à mes référents. 
Capte, Mormeck, frappe dans le sac, moi dans la page blanche. 
Je rappe au nom des miens. Pas le droit que dans le son y'ait rien 
Mate dans mes calepins, c'est plein de Blap-Blap, je descends les chiens 
Au mic, défends les miens. Clap-clap quand je me sens bien 
Je te mets à l'aise, c'est juste du rap. Je nargue comme Hugo Chavez. 
Oh! L'humour est noir car l'humeur du Métèque est mate. 
Chill, c'est à toi, place l'échec et mat. 

On donne grâce et courage, la France rage et nous brade 
Les flics sur le terrain frappent, et les gradés nous parlent 
Bordel, on est des hommes, y'en a marre de jouer les coupables 
Y'a beau mettre les formes mais ces cons nous passent des dourags 
Qu'on se nomme Brad ou Mourad, le passé nous parle 
On tire la paix hors de la guerre, en étudiant les vers et Sourates 
Avec le plastic, le C4, ces cavés nous casent 
Trop de pression dans ce bled et nos fesses jouent les soupapes 
Si je voulais manipuler l'or, je serais député ou pape 
Qu'ils soient dégoûtes ou pas, ma vie est vouée au rap 
Rimes en XTRA large en déboutant les coulées pou-raves 
Assis comme un bouddha, écoute moi livrer des bouts d'âme 

Tant que Dieu me donne la chance de vivre, 
Tant que Dieu me donne la force d'être libre, 
Je rappe le ghetto 

Tant que Dieu me donne la chance de vivre, 
Tant que Dieu me donne la force d'être libre, 
Je rappe le ghetto",Tant Que Dieu [Remix],2007
Mino Cinelu,"And now I know 
Spanish Harlem are not just pretty words to say 
I thought I knew 
But now I know that rose trees never grow in New York City 

Until you've seen this trash can dream come true 
You stand at the edge while people run you through 
And I thank the Lord there's people out there like you 
I thank the Lord there's people out there like you 

While Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters 
Sons of bankers, sons of lawyers 
Turn around and say good morning to the night 
For unless they see the sky 
But they can't and that is why 
They know not if it's dark outside or light 

This Broadway's got 
It's got a lot of songs to sing 
If I knew the tunes I might join in 
I'll go my way alone 
Grow my own, my own seeds shall be sown in New York City 

Subway's no way for a good man to go down 
Rich man can ride and the hobo he can drown 
And I thank the Lord for the people I have found 
I thank the Lord for the people I have found",Mona Lisas (And Mad Hatters),1994

[Seven swans a-swimming,]
Six geese a-laying,
[Five golden rings.] Five golden rings
[Four calling birds,]
Three French hens,
[Two turtledoves]
And a partridge in a pear tree.

[On the tenth day of Christmas, my true love sent to me]
[Ten lords a-leaping,]
Nine ladies dancing,
[Eight maids a-milking,]

Six geese a-laying,
[Five golden rings.] Five golden rings
[Four calling birds,]
Three French hens,

And a partridge in a pear tree.

On the eleventh day of Christmas, my true love sent to me
[I sent eleven pipers piping,]
Ten lords a-leaping,
Nine ladies dancing,
[Eight maids a-milking,]
Seven swans a-swimming,
Six geese a-laying,
[Five golden rings.] Five golden rings
[Four calling birds,]
Three French hens,
[Two turtledoves]
And a partridge in a pear tree.

[On the twelfth day of Christmas, my true love sent to me]
Twelve drummers drumming,
Eleven pipers piping,
Ten lords a-leaping,]
Nine ladies dancing,
[Eight maids a-milking,
Seven swans a-swimming,]
Six geese a-laying,
[Five golden rings.] Five golden rings
[Four calling birds,]
Three French hens,

And a partridge in a pear tree.
And a partridge in a pear tree.

But you can't make it out
There's a noise in the hall
But there's no one about
So you sneak out of bed
Hoping you'll catch Angeline

As you fold out your heart, Angeline

There's a crack in the window
Some snow on the floor
There's a wind out there howling
But you want to make sure
As you light up a candle
She knocks on your door, Angeline
Your face is growing pale 
As you spell out her name, Angeline

Angeline, you've got nothing to fear
It's only me, you're in for a treat
Angeline, I wish you'd see
The other me, the one you're about to release

You've heard all about her
But you haven't seen her face

When she enters your room
You're no longer afraid
'cause you know that if you'll die
You'll die with a smile, Angeline
So you just stare for a while
When closing your eyes, you believe

Angeline, you've got nothing to fear
It's only me, you're in for a treat
Angeline, I wish you'd see
The other me, the one you're about to release

Her hair is untidy 
But her eyes they look mild
She's got a rope hanging around her
It was made for a child
As she unfolds her gown 
You see her shoulders, they're burnt from the sun
You stretch out your hand, 
Just to see if you can, but then she's gone

She came in around dawn 
Took her coat off 
Burdened down by the Russian winter 
Felt the warmth of the hearth 
Bathed a while naked in hot water 
Wash away imminent disaster 
Thinking through her today 
And the murder 
Of the bailiff and the landowner 
Felt no shame 
Only gain 

Cleansed the pike 
Peeled all the potatoes 
Beetroots ripe for bellies of gigolos 
Served it up for her son and her daughter

And what kind of girl would you be
If you did the same

And you don't need a reason to lie

It won't justify throwin' love aside

Love, love is for fools
Why, we do what we do
Love is for fools

Love when it falls apart
And it breaks your heart
Into a thousand pieces
Time take these blues away
If it's love you say
Please be sure you mean it

[Chorus:]
Cause love is for fools
Love is for fools
Why do we do
The things that we do
Cause love is for fools

Tears, falling from these eyes
Oh it's not surprise
While sitting in the dark
I think of love
Why must you burden me
With insecurity
For all I feel is pain and broken heart

Everything you do just isn't right
And peace of mind you cannot find
Don't fear, for there will be another day
See when all is gone astray
Oh and you can't stand the rain
And didn't know it would be that way
Sometimes you gotta say

[Chorus:]
Well I guess that's just the way it be
Be that way sometimes, life can blow your mind
Can knock you right up off your feet
I guess that's just the way life can be
So when it's just one of those days
When things don't seem to want to go your way
It'll be alright if you just say
Be like that sometimes

It's a hard knock life
Bad news at every door
Do you know, this life what it's all for
And just when you can't take no more
A tonne of bricks will fall, but you can make it
Life's a mystery but you can change it
Sometimes the game is tough but you must play it
But first you must believe that you can take it

Problems with your man's infidelity
The same thing happened to me and my lady
So I left you with my card anonymously

'Cause I know how you feel, call me
Fax me, baby here's my number
Eight, two, five, four, two, sixty-three, just call me

So you made up your mind to make this visit
Checkin' up on people is my business
You needed confirmation for suspicion
That left you crying over a thousand minutes
Now suddenly I feel the plot thickening
I find myself having to atone
This situation has my mind just spinning
'Cause now I really want you for my own, my own

Why I would do the things I do, just to be with you

Listen

I'm trying to man up see whats really good with you
Gentleman's approach, not bring it hood to you
Same things that you hear everyday like
""Hey ma, hey boo, baby whats your name""
Please pull up a seat, I'm so glad you came
My mother call me Thomas you can do the same
Damn its so refreshing when you calling out my name
Been Pooh for so long it doesn't sound the same
My occupation rap and I make a little change
I see you not impressed with what this life brings
Finished school, got a job, girl do your thing
It's a lot of independent women wanna be claimed
Marry into money or marry into fame, or at least give birth to a check
With all due respect lets two-step in the name of like
Who says we gotta do the waltz all day and all night, it's like

[Chorus]
If love is not enough
We don't have to rush
Come around, I'll slow it down just you
Lady you should be
Right here next to me
Come around, I'll slow it down just for you

We can go to the movies
I'll take you to the park and promise to have you home before the lights go out
Steady asking you questions what your life about
Oh and me, mine's everything I scribe about
No doubt this my life and
Dedicated to this witting sacrificing everything for it
Wasted time I can't afford
So if it ain't you/then you know I'm cooped up to the record

I'll scoop you up in me Porsche, sike
You know I got a Nissan
That I'm still paying for, still got a lease on
But it don't matter 'cause that ain't my aim to get you
I got fame, but you know that just ain't the issue
Because you're looking like a woman of virtue
So well-rounded, no wonder your're in my circle
And normally you probably wouldn't give me the time of day
'Cause Tay got rhymes, but no he ain't got time to waste

Sometimes I think I'm from another world (preach)
When I'm tryin'a tell a woman just exactly where I stand that (aight)
I want a girl, when I want a girl
And when I don't want a girl, I want a girl who understands that
And that's some hard shit to explain
To a woman that's in love with you, it's a pitiful thing
Until I had to figure
That I don't wanna play around, but I don't wanna settle down
And that's a man's dilemma, 'cause every man remembers
How his daddy and his uncles did it
'Cause more than likely that's the way they're gonna do it
I know it sound f**ked up and most wont admit it
But yo, I gotta face it 'cause I know I'm living through it
'Cause when the party stops and niggas get old
And the chain and the cars and the houses get sold, and that
Other side of the bed gets cold, you don't wanna be alone

Okay, okay

Niggas like y'all talk too much, scared to buck, like to fuck
Here I am, here I go, defeat me, hell no
Try though, watch yo', you'll see, die slow
Give a fuck what you know, who you know, how you know
I do though want to know, do you got it, where it grow
I stay blowed, Optimo, Elbro, (?), dry bud, pepper weed
And I'm crunk, hydro
Shit, give me a leaf,fuck swisher sweet 
Your Louisi-Anna, I'm Texas Pete
Fuck obsolete, nigga too discrete
Sit back and pastor when the 'Port chief
Nigga fuck peace, love beef, dinner time, let's eat
I'm the only one on the seat, ohh no that's me
Who dare test me, show yourself, be ready to bleed

Been here, been real, know the facts, see the deal
My only goal, to rip a mill', my only fear is what I kill

Help me, misery, nightmares, agony
This the pain I see, make it stop, make it leave
Georgia Boys, Real McCoy, Miracle with Pastor Troy
Ain't no Tonka toy, nuclear, we'll destroy
Ain't no stopping me, the only way, kill me
And either way, best to believe, every nigga gonna feel me
Bump this shit when they bury, and leave the funeral smokin' weed
That's how we mourn in the A-you-G, oh no it's DSGB
A nigga like me love to ball, never fall, stand tall
I done came out the south, had my back againt the wall
Fuck the buck, a hundred fall, shot this nigga in the fall
Label me above the law, money is my only cause
Yeah, I'm a real nigga, fuck the Tommy Hilfiger
Glen Hill made nigga, red eyed dope dealer
Punk me out, bitch I stick this pistol in your mouth

I'm a Cougar not Puma
Fucking mice and not nice
I blazed my motherfucking writing so they couldn't read my mind
I was bad as a kid, thank the Lord for filthy kids
And I never got the thanking for shit that I did
I was more than willing unfortunantly not that able
y'all niggas sporting that Polo, I sport that Knight Of The Round Table
Took my partner in school, ran that bitch up my sleeve
Told the teacher ""Bitch, fuck you, I'll listen when I please!""
A nigga can't bother flexin', ain't nothin' but shit in my hood
I push a motherfucking Honda, but that bitch run good
My Ho' takes me where I need to go, rain, sleet, hail, snow
In the winter, see the bed, in the summer slow hoe
What you know about them gold triple D's hundred spoke
Window down, system pumping, puffin' on an Optimo
Hell, I'm blowed, head to toe, 'bout to let y'all niggas know

How much can a man take? 
Before his soul fuckin' break 
And he think bein born is his worst fuckin' mistake 
Stick to milds 'cause he brown 
Never smile always frown 
Keep his head down low 
Don't know where he want to go 
So he turned to the blow 
Now that's all that he know 
Tell me what's his breakin point 
Every time he let go 
Should I fear for my life 
When I go out at night 
Why they take away my rights 
Give me no money to fight 
Am I that damn right 
Am I high as a kite 
I ain't puffin at the mouth 
Y'all know I'm fuckin' right

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

I need to find, find someone to call mine,
But mama said you can't hurry love,
No you just have to wait,
She said love don't come easy,
It's a game of give and take.
You can't hurry love,
No, you just have to wait,
You gotta trust, give it time,
No matter how long it takes;
But how many heartaches must I stand
Before I find a love to let me live again.
Right now the only thing that keeps me hanging on,
When I feel my strength, yeah, it's almost gone,
I remember mama said,

You can't hurry love,
No you just have to wait,
She said love don't come easy,
It's a game of give and take.
How long must I wait how much more can I take,
Before loneliness will 'cause my heart, heart to break?
No, I can't bear to live my life alone.
I grow impatient for a love to call my own,
But when I feel that I, I can't go on,
These precious words keeps me hanging on,

Soft voice to talk to me at night,
For some tender arms to hold me tight.

But it ain't easy, it ain't easy when mama said

You can't hurry love no,
