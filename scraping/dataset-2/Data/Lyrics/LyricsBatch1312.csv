Billy Vaughn,"Blue Spanish eyes
Teardrops are falling from your Spanish eyes
Please, please don't cry

This is just adios and not goodbye
Soon I'll return
Bringing you all the love your heart can hold
Please say ""Si, si""
Say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me

Blue Spanish eyes
Prettiest eyes in all of Mexico
True Spanish eyes

Please smile at me once more before I go
Soon I'll return
Bringing you all the love your heart can hold
Please say ""Si, si""
Say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me
Say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me",Moon Over Naples (Spanish Eyes),1965
Billy Vaughn,"The hills are alive with the sound of music
With songs they have sung for a thousand years
The hills fill my heart with the sound of music
My heart wants to sing every song it hears

My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds
that rise from the lake to the trees
My heart wants to sigh like a chime that flies
from a church on a breeze
To laugh like a brook when it trips and falls over
stones on its way
To sing through the night like a lark who is learning to pray

I go to the hills when my heart is lonely
I know I will hear what I've heard before
My heart will be blessed with the sound of music
And I'll sing once more",The Sound of Music,1965
Billy Vaughn,"This is the moment
I've waited for
I can hear my heart singing
Soon bells will be ringing

This is the moment
love sweet Aloha
I will love you longer than forever
Promise me that you will leave me never

Here I am now dear, 
You're my love, 
I know dear
Promise me that you will leave me never

I will love you longer than forever
Now that we are one
Clouds won't hide the sun
Blue skies of Hawaii will smile

On this, our wedding day
I do love you with all my heart",Hawaiian Wedding Song,1984
Billy Vaughn,"Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away 
Now it looks as though they're here to stay 
Oh, I believe in yesterday. 
Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be, 

There's a shadow hanging over me. 
Oh, yesterday came suddenly. 
Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say. 
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday. 

Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play. 
Now I need a place to hide away. 
Oh, I believe in yesterday. 
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm",Yesterday Once More,1984
Billy Vaughn,"(Fascination turned to love)

It was fascination, I know
And it might have ended right there at the start
Just a passing glance, just a brief romance
And I might have gone on my way empty-hearted

It was fascination, I know
Seeing you alone with the moonlight above
Then I touched your hand and next moment I kissed you
Fascination turned to love

It was fascination, I know
Seeing you alone with the moonlight above
Then I touched your hand and next moment I kissed you
Fascination turned to love

(It was fascination)",Fascination,1988
Billy Vaughn,"For all we know we may never meet again
Before you go make this moment sweet again
We won't say ""Good night"" until the last minute
I'll hold out my hand and my heart will be in it

For all we know this may only be a dream
We come and go like a ripple on a stream
So love me tonight; tomorrow was made for some
Tomorrow may never come for all we know

So love me tonight; tomorrow was made for some
Tomorrow may never come for all we know",For All We Know,1988
Billy Vaughn,"I saw the harbor lights
They only told me we were parting
The same old harbor lights that once brought you to me
I watched the harbor lights
How could I help if tears were starting
Goodbye to tender nights beside the silvery sea

I long to hold you near and kiss you just once more
But you were on the ship and I was on the shore

Now I know lonely nights
For all the while my heart is whispering
Some other harbor lights will steal your love from me

I long to hold you near and kiss you just once more
But you were on the ship and I was on the shore

Now I know lonely nights
For all the while my heart is whispering
Some other harbor lights will steal your love from me",Harbor Lights,1988
Billy Vaughn,"There's a sunny little funny little melody
That was started by a native down in Waikiki
He would gather a crowd down beside the sea
And they'd play his gay Hawaiian chant
Soon the other little natives started singin' it
And the hula hula maidens started swingin' it
Like a tropical storm that's the way it hit
Funny little gay Hawaiian Chant
Ow way tah tualan Me big bad fightin' man
Tho it started on an island down Hawaii way
It's as popular in Tennessee or Ioway
If you wander into any cabaret
You will hear this gay Hawaiian Chant",Hawaiian War Chant,1988
Billy Vaughn,"I'll see you in my dreams
And I'll hold you in my dreams
Someone took you right out of my arms
Still I feel the thrill of your charms

Lips that once were mine
Tender eyes that shine
They will light my way tonight
I'll see you in my dreams

Oh, someone took you right out of my arms
Still I feel the thrill of your charms

Lips that once were mine
Tender eyes that shine
They will light my way tonight
I'll see you in my dreams",I'll See You in My Dreams,1988
Billy Vaughn,"'t was on the Isle of Capri that I found her 
Beneath the shade of an old walnut tree 
Oh, I can still see the flowers blooming round her 
Where we met on the Isle of Capri 

She was as sweet as a rose at the dawning 
But somehow fate hadn't meant her for me 
And though I sailed with the tide in the morning 
Still my heart's on the Isle of Capri 

Summertime was nearly over 
Blue Italian sky above 
I said ""Lady, I'm a rover, 
Can you spare a sweet word of love?"" 

She whispered softly ""It's best not to linger"" 
And then as I kissed her hand I could see 
She wore a lovely meatball on her finger 
't was goodbye at the villa Capri 

Summertime was nearly over 
Blue Italian sky above 
I said ""Lady, I'm a rover, 
Can you spare a fine word of love?"" 

She whispered softly ""It's best not to linger""

She wore a plain golden ring on her finger 
't was goodbye on the Isle of Capri
't was goodbye on the Isle of Capri
't was goodbye on the Isle of Capri",Isle of Capri,1988
Billy Vaughn,"I am dreaming Dear of you, Day by day
Dreaming when the skies are blue, When they're gray;
When the silvery moonlight gleams, Still I wander on in dreams,
In a land of love, it seems, Just with you.

Let me call you ""Sweetheart,"" I'm in love with you.
Let me hear you whisper that you love me too.
Keep the love-light glowing in your eyes so true.
Let me call you ""Sweetheart,"" I'm in love with you.

Longing for you all the while, More and more;
Longing for the sunny smile, I adore;
Birds are singing far and near, Roses blooming ev'rywhere
You, alone, my heart can cheer; You, just you.

Let me call you ""Sweetheart,"" I'm in love with you.
Let me hear you whisper that you love me too.
Keep the love-light glowing in your eyes so true.
Let me call you ""Sweetheart,"" I'm in love with you.",Let Me Call You Sweetheart,1988
Billy Vaughn,"We were sailing along on Moonlight Bay
We could hear the voices ringing
They seemed to say
""You have stolen her heart""
""Now don't go 'way""
As we sang love's old sweet song on Moonlight Bay

(We were sailing along on Moonlight Bay)
(We could hear the voices ringing)

""You have stolen her heart""
""Now don't go 'way""

Billy Vaughn,"Pearly shells from the ocean
Shining in the sun
Covering the shore
When I see them
My heart tells me that I love you
More than all the little pearly shells

For every grain of sand upon the beach
I've got a kiss for you
And I've got more left over 
For each star that twinkles in the blue

Pearly shells
Shining in the sun
Covering the shore
When I see them
My heart tells me that I love you
More than all the little pearly shells

Billy Vaughn,"'Twas down where fisher folk gather,
I wandered far from the throng
I heard a fisher girl singing
And this refrain was her song:

Red sails in the sunset
'Way out on the sea
Oh! carry my loved one
Home safely to me.
He sailed at the dawning
All day I've been blue
Red sails in the sunset
I'm trusting in you
Swift wings you must borrow
Make straight for the shore
We marry tomorrow
And he goes sailing no more.
Red sails in the sunset
'Way out on the sea
Oh! carry my loved one
Home safely to me.

Red sails, the night wind is blowing
And clouds are hiding the moon
Above no bright stars are glowing
It means the storm's coming soon.",Red Sails in the Sunset,1988
Billy Vaughn,"When marimba rhythms start to play 
Dance with me, make me sway 
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore 
Hold me close, sway me more 

Like a flower bending in the breeze 
Bend with me, sway with ease 
When we dance you have a way with me 
Stay with me, sway with me 

Other dancers may be on the floor 
Dear, but my eyes will see only you 
Only you have the magic technique 
When we sway I go weak 

I can hear the sounds of violins 
Long before it begins 
Make me thrill as only you know how 
Sway me smooth, sway me now 

Other dancers may be on the floor 
Dear, but my eyes will see only you 
Only you have the magic technique 
When we sway I go weak 

I can hear the sounds of violins 
Long before it begins 
Make me thrill as only you know how 
Sway me smooth, sway me now 
You know how 
Sway me smooth, sway me now",Sway,1988
Billy Vaughn,"Almost heaven, West Virginia,
Blue Ridge Mountains
Shenandoah River.
Life is old there,
Older than the trees,
Younger than the mountains
Growing like a breeze. 

Country roads, take me home
To the place where I belong:
West Virginia, mountain mom,
Take me home, country roads.

All my memories gathered 'round her, 
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water.
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky,
Misty taste of moonshine,
Teardrop in my eye.

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong:
West Virginia, mountain momma,
Take me home, country roads.

I hear her voice, in the morning hour she calls me,
Radio reminds me of my home far away 
And driving down the road I get a feeling
I should have been home yesterday, yesterday

Country roads, take me home
To the place where I belong:
West Virginia, mountain momma,
Take me home, country roads.","Take Me Home, Country Roads",1988
Billy Vaughn,"There's a summer place
Where it may rain or storm
Yet I'm safe and warm
For within that summer place
Your arms reach out to me
And my heart is free from all care
For it knows

There are no gloomy skies
When seen through the eyes
Of those who are blessed with love

And the sweet secret of
A summer place
Is that it's anywhere
When two people share
All their hopes
All their dreams
All their love

There's a summer place
Where it may rain or storm
Yet I'm safe and warm
In your arms, in your arms
In your arms, in your arms
In your arms, in your arms","Theme from ""A Summer Place""",1988
Billy Vaughn,"Tiny bubbles in the wine,
Make me happy, make me feel fine,
Tiny bubbles make me warm all over
With a feeling that I'm gonna Love you 'til the end of time.

So here's to the golden moon,
And here's to the silver sea,
But most of all a toast to you and me

Tiny bubbles in the wine,
Make me happy, make me feel fine,
Tiny bubbles make me warm all over
With a feeling that I'm gonna Love you 'til the end of time.

So here's to the ginger lei
I give to you today
And here's a kiss that will not fade away.

Billy Vaughn,"Stars hang suspended above a floating yellow moon
Two hearts were blended while angels sang a lovers tune
And so we kissed not knowing if our hearts could pay the price
But heaven welcomed us to paradise blessing our love

Then came the sunrise fading the moon and stars from sight
Recalling always our wonderland by night

Billy Vaughn,"What's it all about, Alfie?
Is it just for the moment we live?
What's it all about when you sort it out, Alfie?
Are we meant to take more than we give or are we meant to be kind?

And if only fools are kind, Alfie,
Then I guess it's wise to be cruel.
And if life belongs only to the strong, Alfie,
What will you lend on an old golden rule?

As sure as I believe there's a heaven above, Alfie,
I know there's something much more,
Something even non-believers can believe in.
I believe in love, Alfie.

Without true love we just exist, Alfie.
Until you find the love you've missed you're nothing, Alfie.
When you walk let your heart lead the way
And you'll find love any day, Alfie, Alfie.",Alfie,1990
Billy Vaughn,"Danke schoen, darling, danke schoen, 
Thank you for all the joy and pain.
Picture shows, second balcony, was the place we'd meet, 
Second seat, go Dutch treat, you were sweet.

Danke schoen, darling, danke schoen, 
Thank you for funny cards from Spain.
I recall Central Park and all, 
How you tore your dress, what a mess, I confess, that's not all.

Danke schoen, darling, danke schoen, 
Thank you for walks down Lover's Lane,
I can see hearts carved on a tree, 
Letters intertwined for all time yours and mine, that was fine.

Danke schoen, darling, danke schoen, 
Thank you for seeing me again.
Though we go on our separate ways, 
Still the memory stays for always, 
My heart says, danke schoen, auf weidersehn, danke schoen.",Danke Schoen,1990
Billy Vaughn,"And I wake up in the mornin' 
With my hair down in my eyes and she says ""Hi"" 
And I stumble to the breakfast table 
While the kids are goin' off to school goodbye 
And she reaches out 'n' takes my hand 
And squeezes it 'n' says ""How ya feelin', hon?"" 
And I look across at smilin' lips 
That warm my heart and see my mornin' sun 
 
And if that's not lovin' me 
Then all I've got to say 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime 
And there's no such thing as Doctor Seuss 
Or Disneyland, and Mother Goose, no nursery rhyme 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime 
And when my self is feelin' low 
I think about her face aglow and ease my mind 
 
Sometimes I call her up at home knowin' she's busy 
And ask her if she could get away and meet me 
And maybe we could grab a bite to eat 
And she drops what she's doin' and she hurries down to meet me 
And I'm always late 
But she sits waitin' patiently and smiles when she first sees me 
'cause she's made that way 
 
And if that ain't lovin' me 
Then all I've got to say 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't snow in Minneapolis when the winter comes 
And there's no such thing as make-believe 
Puppy dogs, autumn leaves 'n' BB guns 
 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't rain in Indianapolis",Little Green Apples,1990
Billy Vaughn,"You see this guy, this guy's in love with you
Yes I'm in love who looks at you the way I do
When you smile I can tell it know each other very well

How can I show you I'm glad I got to know you 'cause
I've heard some talk they say you think I'm fine
This guy's in love and what I'd do to make you mine
Tell me now is it so don't let me be the last to know

Billy Vaughn,"There was a man, a lonely man
Who lost his love through his indifference
A heart that cared, that went unchecked
Until it died in his silence

And solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him, takes him down
And by himself, it's easy to pretend
He'll never love again

And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire

Another day, a lonely day
So much to say that goes unspoken
And through the night, his sleepless nights
His eyes are closed, his heart is broken

And solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him, takes him down
And by himself it's easy to pretend
She's coming back again

And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire

A little hope, goes up in smoke
Just how it goes, goes without saying
Solitaire
And by himself it's easy to pretend 
He'll never love again
Ohhh

And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire
Solitaire, solitaire",Solitaire,1991

Billy Vaughn,"I'm a roaming cowboy riding all day long,
Tumbleweeds around me sing their lonely song.
Nights underneath the prairie moon,
I ride along and sing this tune.

See them tumbling down
Pledging their love to the ground
Lonely but free I'll be found
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds.

Cares of the past are behind
Nowhere to go but I'll find
Just where the trail will wind
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds.

I know when night has gone
That a new world's born at dawn.

I'll keep rolling along
Deep in my heart is a song
Here on the range I belong
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds.",Tumbling Tumbleweeds,1992

The green leaves of Summer are callin' me home.
'Twas so good to be young then, in a season of plenty,
When the catfish were jumpin' as high as the sky.

A time just for plantin', a time just for ploughin'.
A time to be courtin' a girl of your own.
'Twas so good to be young then, to be close to the earth,
And to stand by your wife at the moment of birth.

A time to be reapin', a time to be sowin'.
The green leaves of Summer are callin' me home.
'Twas so good to be young then, with the sweet smell of apples,
And the owl in the pine tree a-winkin' his eye.

A time just for plantin', a time just for ploughin'.
A time just for livin', a place for to die.
'Twas so good to be young then, to be close to the earth,

Beside an apple tree did grow
And there a boy once met his bride to be
Long long ago

The boy looked into her eyes, it was a sight to enthrall
The breezes joined in their sighs, the blossoms started to fall
And as they gently caressed, the lovers looked up to find
The branches of the two trees were intertwined,

If there's a new moon bright above

Billy Vaughn,"Con este tango que es burlón y compadrito
Se ató dos alas la ambición de mi suburbio
Con este tango nació el tango, y como un grito
Salió del sórdido barrial buscando el cielo
Conjuro extraño de un amor hecho cadencia
Que abrió caminos sin más ley que la esperanza
Mezcla de rabia, de dolor, de fe, de ausencia
Llorando en la inocencia de un ritmo juguetón

Por tu milagro de notas agoreras
Nacieron, sin pensarlo, las paisas y las grelas
Luna de charcos, canyengue en las caderas
Y un ansia fiera en la manera de querer

Al evocarte, tango querido
Siento que tiemblan las baldosas de un bailongo
Y oigo el rezongo de mi pasado
Hoy, que no tengo más a mi madre
Siento que llega en punta 'e pie para besarme
Cuando tu canto nace al son de un bandoneón

Carancanfunfa se hizo al mar con tu bandera
Y en un pernó mezcló a París con Puente Alsina
Triste compadre del gavión y de la mina
Y hasta comadre del bacán y la pebeta

And the plentiful waste of time of day

For the moon refused to shine. 
Couple sitting underneath a willow tree, 
For love they did pine, 
Little maid was kinda 'fraid of darkness

Boy began to sigh, looked up at the sky, 
Told the moon his little tale of woe: 

""Oh, shine on, shine on harvest moon up in the sky. 
I ain't had no lovin' since January, February, June or July 
Snowtime ain't no time to stay outdoors and spoon, 
So shine on, shine on harvest moon - for me and my gal !""

When by his side is the girl he loves so true, 
All he has to say is: 
""Won't you be my bride, 
For I love you, 
Why should I be telling you this secret, 
When I know that you can guess?,""

Shine on all the while,

At the close of day
When the joys of the day fade away and the memories sweet

He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!

His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.

With all our hearts we praise His holy name.

I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

Billy Vaughn,"Once there were green fields kissed by the sun 
Once there were valleys where rivers used to run 
Once there was blue sky with white clouds high above 
Once they were part of an everlasting love 
We were the lovers who strolled through green fields 

Green fields are gone now, parched by the sun 
Gone from the valleys where rivers used to run 
Gone with the cold wind that swept into my heart 
Gone with the lovers who let their dreams depart 
Where are the green fields that we used to roam?

I'll never know what made you run away 
How can I keep searching when dark clouds hide the day?
I only know there's nothing here for me
Nothing in this wide world left for me to see 

But I'll keep on waitin' 'til you return 
I'll keep on waiting until the day you learn

You can't be happy until you bring it home

Que abrió caminos sin más ley que la esperanza

Siento que llega en punta 'e pie para besarme

Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon

Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space

Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel

From the queen of flowing mountains to the south bells by the moor
She's mighty tall and handsome and known quite well by all
She's the combination on the Wabash Cannonball

She came down from Birmingham one cold December day
As she pulled into the station you could hear all the people say
There's a gal from Tennessee she's long and she's tall
She came down from Birmingham on the Wabash Cannonball

Listen to the jingle the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodlands through the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear that lonesome hobo's call
Traveling through the Dixie on the Wabash Cannonball

Our eastern states are dandy so the people always say
From New York to St Louis and Chicago by the way
From the hills of Minnesota where the rippling waters fall
No changes can be taken on the Wabash Cannonball

So here's to daddy Claxton may his name forever stand
And always be remembered in the ports of Alabama
His earthly race is over and the curtains round him fall
We'll carry him home to Victory on the Wabash Cannonball

Street corner you'll hear

Ring-a-ling, hear them sing
Soon it will be christmas day

Strings of street lights
Even stoplights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home
With their treasures
Hear the snow crunch
See the kids bunch
This is santa's big scene
And above all
This bustle you'll here

Ring-a-ling, hear them sing
Soon it will be christmas day

Billy Walker,"I'd like to be in Charlie's shoes, that's what I always said
'Cause he had you and everything tied with a golden thread
Then Charlie left and went away and when I got the news
It wasn't long till I was walking 'round in Charlie's shoes

Now I'm wearing out the shoes that Charlie wore
Walking back and forth across the floor
The troubles that drove him away, I've got for company
These nights in Charlie's shoes are killing me

The greener grass that turned my head so swiftly did turn brown
'Cause every little dream I've built she's always tearing down
I never knew old Charlie's shoes could have so many tacks
Of disappointing sorrows and I wish he had 'em back

'Cause I'm wearing out the shoes that Charlie wore
Walking back and forth across the floor
The troubles that drove him away, I've got for company
These nights in Charlie's shoes are killing me",Charlie's Shoes,1991

My it's been a long long time
How am I doin'
Well I guess I'm doin' fine

How's your new love
I hope that he's doin' fine

Billy Walker,"I'm just driftwood on the river floating down the tide
I don't care where this old river carries me
I keep drifting just because my heart is broken inside
And I'm tired of wishing for what cannot be
(I may meet some little driftwood lost as same as I
Share a handshake and a tender tear or two)
But it's always good luck how we got to say goodbye
I must wander on to keep my rendezvous

Though I drift through town and city I can never stay
For I find no place to call my home sweet home
I don't ask for help or pitty I just go my way
All I'm praying for is peace to dream alone
(I'm just driftwood on the river and I'm drifting on
Till this weary river meets the deep blue sea)
Where the deep blue sea may help me to forget someone
Yes the careless one who has forgotten me
In my heart I don't feel bitter over what has been
I feel sorry for the one I must forget
And instead of being someone with the world to win
I'm just driftwood on the river of regret",Driftwood on the River,1992

For it's only three more miles to Mary Anne yes it's only three more miles to Mary Anne
Dan get up your ornery cuss or you'll be the death of us
And I'm so weary but I'll help you if I can

All right Dan perhaps it's best that we'll stop awhile and rest

Waiting for a train
A thousand miles away from home

I'll see that you don't walk

Not a penny can I show

Billy Wells,"For awhile, to love was all we could do 
We were young and we knew 
In our eyes were alive 
Deep inside we knew our love was true 
For awhile, we paid no mind to the past 
We knew love would last 
Every night, something right 
Would invite us to begin the day 
Something happened along the way 
What used to be happy was sad 
Something happened along the way 
And yesterday was all we had 
And, oh, after the love has gone 
How could you lead me on 
And not let me stay around  
Oh, oh, oh, after the love has gone 
What used to be right is wrong 
Can love that's lost be found ? 
For awhile, to love each other with all 
We would ever need 
Love was strong for so long 
Never knew that what was 
Wrong, oh, baby, wasn't right 
We tried to find what we had 
Till sadness was all we shared 
We were scared 
This affair would lead our love into

Who got Bugs Bunny money, I'll give you some time
To get more carrots every time I rhyme
Can a mouse write this
Does he have long furry ears like this (oh brotha)
Can he make hits like this (ha-ha-ha-ha)
No, it's like Jordan at the plate, you're likely to miss
Warner Brothers Inc. got bank, keep countin'
Rule from here to The Moron Mountain
Here's the game plan, listen up Toon Squad
Number one objective, beat The Monstars
Shouldn't be hard, them guys ain't too smart
But to be sure snatch Jordan playin' golf
Even though he tends to be a ball hog
Hey Michael, over here superstar (whoo-hoo)
Who says the Bunny can't play above the rim
Wait till they get a load of me, that's buggin'

Who says the bunny can't rhyme, you're buggin'
If Bugs don't make you hop, you're buggin'
Take this Space Jam, don't stop, you're buggin'
Eh, you'll be buggin'
Who says the Bunny can't jam, you're buggin'
If you all don't know who I am, you're buggin'
Bugs ain't the coolest in the land, you're buggin
Eh, you'll be buggin'

Got a gi-url-friend Lola, she's a fox
Ain't no bunny like the one I've got (that's true)
He-he-he-eh, what's Up, Doc
Bugs got more props than the Warner Brother's lot (twuee)
More money that any rapper's voice (twue)
Fits bay one hand, his and her first
Like Trump's wife, up to my ears in carats/carrots
Not even the botha can fade the rabbit (so what)
See, it's all good, cause Bugs got props
I'm a bunny, right, all we do is Hip-Hop
Get around, (uh-huh) underground, (uh-huh)
Keep it real, how do ya like me now
The bunny got glow, but when he got dough
On top of the world, Me and my honey, Lo
So from now and 'til the record stops, (what)
You guys can bank, hit, bounce, or do the bunny hop

Who says the bunny can't rhyme, you're buggin'
If Bugs don't make you hop, you're buggin'

(The less, the better) I'm the coolest rabbit, Doc Holiday
I'll Be Your Huckle-bunny, unmatched wit
I'm too legit, 2 Legit 2 Quit
Beat Swackhammer, eh, what's his gimmick
Try to rule the world and every-ting in it
Run with the Toon Stars, show us love
Peace to Lola, Daffy, Elmer Fudd
The Road Runner, to rub a dust off
Peace to Wile E. Coyote and Foghorn Leghorn
Sylvester, Tweety, the rest of the gang (that's right)
On tree, the Toon Squad got the best game
And after it's over, we'll need a plan
What type of Mickey Mouse organization goes to Disney Land
(Hm, I don't know) Bugs for president, when I got your vote
Time to keep partyin'
A-blee-bleet-blee-That's All Folks

I stopped off at the North Pole to spend the holiday
I called on old dear Santa Claus to see what I could see
He took me to his workshop and told his plans to me

Now Santa is a busy man, he has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas Day
You better write your letter now and mail it right away
Because he's getting ready his reindeer's and his sleigh

You better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's making a list and checkin' it twice
He's gonna find out who's naughty or nice

He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

Oh, you better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why

Santa Claus is coming to town

Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Curly head dolls that cuddle and coo
Elephants, boats and kiddie cars too

The kids in girl and boy land
Will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a toy land

Billy White,"Everyone considered him the coward of the county
He'd never stood one single time to prove the county wrong
His mama named him Tommy, but folks just called him Yellow
Something always told me, they were reading Tommy wrong

He was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison
I looked after Tommy, 'cause he was my brother's son
I still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy
""Son, my life is over, but yours has just begun""

""Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man""

There's someone for everyone and Tommy's love was Becky
In her arms, he didn't have to prove he was a man
One day while he was working, the Gatlin boys came calling
They took turns at Becky an' there was three of them

Tommy opened up the door and saw Becky crying
The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand
He reached above the fireplace and took down his daddy's picture
As his tears fell on his daddy's face, he heard these words again

""Promise me, Son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man""

The Gatlin boys just laughed at him when he walked into the bar room
One of them got up and met him half way cross the floor
When Tommy turned around they said, ""Hey look! Old Yellow's leaving""
But you could've heard a pin drop
When Tommy stopped and locked the door

Twenty years of crawling were bottled up inside him
He wasn't holding nothing back, he let 'em have it all
When Tommy left the bar room, not a Gatlin boy was standing
He said, ""This one's for Becky, as he watched the last one fall
An? I heard him say

""I promised you, Dad, not to do the things you've done
I walk away from trouble when I can
Now please don't think I'm weak, I didn't turn the other cheek
And Papa, I should hope you understand
Sometimes you gotta fight when you're a man""

Billy Yates,"I grew up in what I thought was domestic bliss
 I had a daddy and a mama and a brother and a sis
 Never knew nothing 'bout the Finer things
 We were livin' on weenies, beenies, and dreams
 Daddy used to take alot of business trips
 Promisin' us all a better life than this
 Said it was a sacrifice he had to make
 Right about then, mama dropped another plate

 Well it turned out daddy wasn't nothin' but a snake
 He had a half a dozen women, in a half a dozen states
 Mama grew wiser as the years went by
 She never said a word, kept it all inside
 Well they found him face down in a motel room
 Smellin' like liquor and a lover's perfume
 Standing by the gravesite, mama was a wreck
 Till the State-Farm man, handed her a fat check

 Daddy had a cardiac
 Mama got a Cadillac
 All of us kids done throwed away the tater sacks
 Look at us now
 Living that life
 Daddy always promised us that he'd provide
 Daddy's on a shady hill
 Mama's in a Coupe Deville
 Never have to worry 'bout another bill
 Daddy died smiling
 But mama got the last laugh
 Daddy had a cardiac
 Mama got a Cadillac

 Well it's been awhile now since it all went down
 Mama's still a hero all over town
 When the  preacher does a serom about those who wait
 Mama slips a hundred in the offerin' plate
 Now, each and every year on the day he died
 Mama dresses up for a Midnight Drive
 Where she ever goes, she never does say
 But, there's a Fresh set of tire track on daddy's grave

 Daddy had a cardiac

Billy Zane,"Two hopeful hearts two lands apart
Together there's no end
To what a dream can start
Like two eagles soar as one
Upon the river of the wind
With the promise of forever
We will take the past and learn how to begin
And we'll build a bridge of love
Between two worlds

With every kiss we'll promise this
We'll find a way to light
The dawn of all we wish
Across the stream of stars we'll reach
An island in the sky
With the moon to guide our way I know
That we can find a home for you and I
And we'll build a bridge of love
Between two worlds

Miles and miles away
Though the journey takes us far
Our love has found a place to stay
If we believe, if we believe
There is no sea, there is no sea
That's wide enough
To keep us from our destiny

Like the snows of every winter melt
And blossom into spring
As the seasons pass, we'll live as one
No what the years ahead may bring
No night is long enough
To end this light that shines on us
We have built a bridge of love
Between two worlds
Yes, we have built a love
Between two worlds",Between Two Worlds (End Title),2009
Billy Zane,"Have no fear, we're all right
You've got me, dear, to see that you're a lady tonight
What seems strange, is just new
People change everyday 'til they find their own way, so can you
And wait 'til he sees you after your dressed
I think the king will be very impressed
Wait 'til he sees you walking with ease
He'll be so pleased you came down from the trees
You'll be fine, I can tell
It's a very good sign that you're doing so well
One more tuck, one more bow
Don't get stuck on that clasp, Johnny's lucky they asked you to go
'Cause wait 'til he sees you, he'll be so proud
Maybe he'll smile if he thinks he's allowed
Wait 'til he sees you there in your curls
John's always had such a fondness for girls with curls

And wait, wait 'til you're out on the floor
Show them what dancing is for
Music is all you need
See where a dance can lead

You two might come to see you were meant to be so much more
Wait 'til he sees you, wait 'til tonight
Fate has a way of arranging what's right
After he sees you in your new clothes
A lady of grace from your head to your toes
Pretty and pink as the roses he grows
Who knows, who knows, I can't wait",Wait 'Til He Sees You,2009
Billy Zoom,"In a police car I feel so very small
I see my lover's face and I watch her teardrops fall
And I try to figure out where I'd fallen off the track
Well,  I sold my soul to the devil and then I stole it back

And in the end, you know a dope fiend ain't got no friends
And a junkie is a junkie to the bitter end
Hope to die now, 'cause you know I'm better off dead
Hey brother, won't you lend me a helpin' hand?

I tie myself off, shoot it in my veins
I feel like Marlon Brando and I've hid another day's pain
I'm goin' back where it's safe, goin' back to the womb
I find my mother's comfort, here in a needle and spoon

And Christmas for a dope fiend ain't no fun
Waiting for good times that seem to never come
Goin' out now, gonna get myself a gun
Please stop me, don't you know I'm on the run?

Aren't you tired of the detox and the places in the mind?
Aren't you tired of the misery, aren't you tired of doin' time?
And I try to figure out where I'd fallen off the track
You know I sold my soul to the devil and then I stole it back

I'm a dope fiend, I'm a liar, a cheat and a thief
At my funeral, won't you bring me a red rose wreath?
Dress in black now, show everyone your grief
Well, I'm gone now, you can all feel relief!",Dope Fiend Blues,
Billy Zoom,"Your heart's been broken, you don't want to open up to me
But can't you see
All that you're needing is someone to believe in you
And when you are no longer afraid
Darlin' I'll be just one word away

Say when, I'll be there by your side
For a day, for a year, for the rest of my life
I know you're not ready
But someday your heart's gonna mend
I'll give you love without end
Say when

Could be tomorrow, maybe a little farther down the road
Your heart will know
My love is timeless and you're gonna find it's true
And no matter how long it takes
If it means holding you I can wait

Say when, I'll be there by your side
For a day, for a year, for the rest of my life
I know you're not ready

Why al abrir los ojos
Solo lagrimas caen en mi cama
Me levanto perdido
Todo confundido
Sudando
Pensando porque te has ido
Oye Bimbo solo quiere amarte
Mi corazon quiero regalarte
Todo lo mejor de mi quiero darte
Por favor mami no te marches
Al contrario quiero demostrarte
Que despues de la tormenta
El sol vuelve a asomarse
Quiero que sepas
Que si hoy eh de marcharme
Por siempre eh de amarte
For real baby.

You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

I'd like to know if your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again

Send it's melody by a love bird

They saw my face now they want to kill me
But bitch recognize I'm a reckless G

The risk is live it to your life, and live this
The dreams oversees the world is yours to for
Take what you can get and pass that on to more people

That we must part, you and I

Nights are long since you went away

Is it Eddy, is it Freddy? no, no no!
It is Heart, is it Shaptler, is it Mosteres

Talkin' 'bout Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer
(Oh, him)
Had a very shiny nose
(So I heard
They say if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows.)
Like a hot rasie.

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
(Rudolph is a red nose
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games.)

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say,
""Hey Rudolph, I say Rudolph, with your nose so bright,
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""

(Then how the reindeer's loved him
And they shouted out with glee,
Rudolph, Rudolph, Rudolph)
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer,
You'll go down in history!

His snarl snoot
His tuba that glow like a light-ta-root
With his pink kazoo, he guided the sleigh
He's a hero) why, Rudolph saved the day.

In the reign deer hall of fame)

Of the little reign deer days.

Rides around in Santa's sleigh)

Smoking a cigar all day.

Anyone can plainly see)

For the G.I. Josephs who were in the war
But for generals things were not so grand
And it's not so hard to understand

What can you do with a general
When he stops being a general?
Oh, what can you do with a general who retires?

Who's got a job for a general
When he stops being a general?
They all get a job but a general no one hires

They fill his chest with medals while he's across the foam
And they spread the crimson carpet when he comes marching home
The next day someone hollers when he comes into view
""Here comes the general"" and they all say ""General who?""
They're delighted that he came
But they can't recall his name

Just what I need for Christmas

I got some jungle gym pajamas and some Alpine hats
Some real Parisian painted neckwear that they call cravats

Found some doeskin spats

It's not what you bought it's the Yuletide thought

Was the thought you were thinking of me

I would say that you've been twice as busy as a Christmas Elf
I'll bet that personally you have emptied every modern shelf

Bing Crosby,"Now, gather 'round while I elucidate
On what happens outside when it gets late
'Long about midnight the ghosts and banshees
Get together for their nightly jamborees
There's ghosts with horns and saucer eyes
And some with fangs about this size
Some short and fat, some tall and thin
And some don't even bother to wear their skin
I'm tellin' you brother, it's a frightful sight
To see what goes on in the night

When the spooks have a midnight jamboree
They break it up with fiendish glee
Ghosts are bad, but the one that's cursed
Is the Headless Horseman, he's the worst
When he goes a-joggin' 'cross the land
Holdin' a noggin in his hand
Demons take one look and groan
And hit the road for parts unknown
And there's no wraith like a spook that's spurned
They don't like him, and he's really burned
He swears to the longest day he's dead
He'll show them that he can get a head

So close all the windows, lock the doors
Unless you're careful, he'll get yours
Don't think he'll hesitate a bit
'Cause he'll flip your top if it'll fit
And he likes 'em little, likes 'em big
Part in the middle, or a wig
Black or white or even red
The Headless Horseman needs a head
With a hip-hip and a clippity-clop
He's out lookin' for a top to chop
So don't stop to figure out a plan
You can't reason with a headless man

So after dark, you kids be good
Stay at home, the way that you should
'Cause right outside, and waitin' there
Is the Headless horseman

(Har the shillelagh. 
You know we call it the Tipperary rifle. 
You never have to reload it.)

This bronco-busting Irishman 
From the heart of Erin's Isle it was after living peaceful, like
He always wore a smile.
But when the smile was leaving him
In a fight he'd 
Come unwound Bad cess for any crossing him
They'd wind up on the ground.

Two Shillelagh O'Sullivan
He'd give any man a go.

(Why he was so strong was Sullivan, 
He could put his right hand in his own left pocket, 
And hold himself out at arm's
Length. No man could do that. 
It's O'Sullivan I'm talking 
About. Oh, well he could.)

At throwing the rope for branding calf
He was a mighty man
At throwing his two shillelaghs now
The fastest in the land.
T'would be a sad mistake me boys
To reach for a 44
Before you could get the hammer cocked
He'd have you on 
The floor.
O yippee ki yi oh, me bucko
B'gorrah an yippee ki yo
Two Shillelagh O'Sullivan
He'd give any man a go.

(Did you know O'Sullivan played the Irish Harp? 
No. Oh, sure, and he did. 
He put 75 strings on his two shillelaghs,
He'd stretch them out 24 feet,and he had four leprechauns
Dancing on them to make the music. 
Oh, the wonder of it. Sure and he would charm the coyotes out of the hills)

Across the range from morn 'til night
He rode for days
And days
A'fixin' fences here and there
And a picking 
Up the strays.

A cattle spread he really built
As big as Ireland
Where he could range a million head
And a 
Shamrock be his brand.
O yippee ki yi oh, me bucko
B'gorrah an yippee ki yo
Two Shillelagh O'Sullivan
He'd give any man a go.

A bit of his lip, he back of his hand, 
And the toe of his shoe to boot. 
Oh, Two Shillelagh O'Sullivan.

(Now if you're ever riding through the sagebrush wilderness,
And you suddenly come upon acres and acres of shamrock sprinkled with stardust, 
Well, you'll be after knowing,
That you've just arrived at the O Sullivan spread,
Known has the Lazy Leprachauns. 
Stop in, won't you? 
Sure, and they'll give you a belt of Bushmill's.)",Two-Shillelagh O'Sullivan,1952

You've got that something in your voice
So right for selling cheese (hustle a lot of the stuff)

You know, I think your jokes are great (really?)
It's just that folks are hard to please (they're just snobs, that all)

Your face could make a fortune
Just your nose should make a lot (how do you siphon?)
I like the way you wear those gaudy-colored shirts you've got, boy!
The only time a rainbow ever covered up a pot
You're such a perfect square (oh-oh, is that on the paper?)
(where?, where?)

Shall we dance?
Sorry, I have my heavy underwear on
Oh, just to once around, to the adrenalin, huh?
Well, OK, if I lead

Companions, confederates, chums to the end
Like meat and potatoes, or salt and tomatoes

Don't put it on the air (I'll finish it)
Don't put it in your pipe

Leave your name with the girl when you go out
We may get to you for some crowd noises

It's a shame it rained today.""

We will be happy, Nellie,

Down Lover's Lane we'll wander, 
Sweethearts you and I. 
Wait till the sun shines, Nellie,

Just to show my brand new gown.""

(You're all I want for Christmas)

Bing Crosby,"On a Christmas Eve a happy snowman
Stood and dreamed beside a cottage door
How the children loved their friend the snowman
And the funny fedora he wore

When they said goodnight they told the snowman
That a gift for him was on the tree
So he called himself a lucky snowman
Just like one of the family was he

The cottage porch looked beautiful and bright
The holly wreath was turned on for the night
When all at once it caught on fire and fell
He couldn't knock, he couldn't ring the bell
He couldn't run for help, he couldn't call
But then he had to save the children after all

He knew he'd melt away, and yet the snowman
Threw himself across the burning floor
How the children missed their friend the snowman
But they'll always remember him for
A heart that was brave and the joy that he gave
And the funny fedora he wore",The Snowman,1958
Bing Crosby,"Oh, the shark has pretty teeth dear
And he shows 'em, pearly white
Just a jack knife has Macheath dear
And he keeps it way out of sight

When that shark bites with his teeth, dear
Scarlet billows they begin to spread
Fancy white gloves has Macheath dear
So there's never, never a trace of red

On the sidewalk, one Sunday morning
Lies a body, oozin' life
Someone's sneaking 'round the corner
Could that someone perhaps, per chance be Mack the Knife

From a tugboat, on the river going slow
A cement bag is dropping down 
You know that cement is for the weight dear
You can make a large bet Macheath's in town

My man Louis Miller, he split the scene babe
After drawing out all the bread from his stash
Now Macheath spends like a sailor
Do you suppose this guy, he did something rash

Old Satchmo, Louis Armstrong, Bobby Darrin
They did this song nice, Lady Ella too
They all sang it, with so much feeling
That Old Blue Eyes, he ain't gonna add nothing new

But with this big, fat band, jumping behind me
Swinging hard, Jack, I know I can't lose
When I tell you, all about Mack the Knife babe
It's an offer, you can never refuse

We got Patrick Williams, Bill Miller playing that piano
And this wonderful, great big band, bringing up the rear
All these bad cats, in this band now 
They make the greatest sounds, you're ever gonna hear

Oh Sookie Taudry, Jenny Diver, Polly Peachum, Old Miss Lulu Brown

Hey the line forms, on the right dear
Now that Macheath,that bum is back in town
You'd better lock your doors, and call the law
Because Mackie's back in town",Sugar (That Sugar Baby O' Mine),1960
Bing Crosby,"I know a friend of mine
And his business is writing songs
It's a kind of a gift and I get a big lift
From his melodies and diphthongs

We got to talk him once
I was curious as could be
To explain what to do, let him tell it to you
Just the way it was told to me

First you write a little ol' tune, real easy
Not as hard to play as let's say part cheesy
Real simple chords in the key of C
A melody you can groove

Next you add some little ol' words on to it
Try to get some people who'll sing to do it
Then if they say, ?My have you got a hit?
You act non committal and say, ?Just a little ol' tune?

Now record your little ol' tune, just hum it
Could you try to fancy it up? Far from it
Dub in some top tenor harmony
Just me, me, me, as you groove

Yes, next you sing a baritone part from way back
Add a zoom, zoom, bass and then start the playback
And when they say, ?Ma, he's singing forte?
You act non committal and say, ?Just a little ol' tune?
You act non committal and say, ?Just a little, just a little ol' tune?",Little Ol' Tune,1960
Bing Crosby,"I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill
On Blueberry Hill where I found you
The moon stood still on Blueberry Hill
And lingered till my dreams came true

The wind in the willow played
Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows we made
Were never to be

Tho' we're apart you're part of me still
For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill

Bing Crosby,"Let me tell you a tale that is often told
In the great Celestial Hall
All about an angel only four years old
The littlest angel of all

How all day he would play with a little box
That to others had no words
Oh, but there were treasures in this little box
The treasures he brought from Earth

Just a butterfly with golden wings
A little piece of a hollow log
Two shiny stones from a river bank
And the worn out strap of his faithful dog

Then the angels all heard that the holy child
Would be born in Bethlehem
And they all brought present for the holy child
And each gift was a heavenly gem

Then the littlest angel put his little box
With the presents fine and wrapped
And the littlest angel sat alone and cried
For his gift was so meager and bad

Just a butterfly with golden wings
A little piece of a hollow log
Two shiny stones from a river bank
And the worn out strap of his faithful dog

But the Lord chose the gift of the little box
That the child had blessed with love
And it started glowing that very night
It became the star up above

When you see that star as it shines on high
In the great Celestial Hall
You will know the proudest angel in the sky
Is the littlest angel of all

With his butterfly with golden wings
A little piece of a hollow log
Two shiny stones from a river bank
And the worn out strap of his faithful dog",The Littlest Angel,1962

Every child must be made to care
Care enough for his fellow man
To give all the love that he can

In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird

It was the most convenient door
I found a million dollar baby
In a five and ten cent store.
The rain continued for an hour.
I hung around for three or four.
Around a million dollar baby
In a five and ten cent store.

She was selling china
And when she made those eyes,
I kept buying china 
Until the crowd got wise.

If you should run into a shower,
Just step inside my cottage door,
And meet the million-dollar baby
From the five and ten cent store.

Spring or fall.
Say, you'll never know when it may say hello
In a very unexpected place.
For example, take my case.

Your castles may tumble
That's fate after all
Life's really funny that way

Just smile as they fall

Just remember that sunshine 
Always follows the rain

And dream your troubles away",Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams (And Dream Your Troubles Away),1972

Ain't no someone yearnin', wonderin' where I be,
I'm gone, but no one's missin' me,
Ain't no light a-burnin' ev'ry night for me,
I'm like a bird that's flyin' free.

I'm just breezin' along with the breeze,
Trailin' the rails, roamin' the seas.

Like the birdies that sing in the trees,
Pleasin' to live, livin' to please.

An' when it all comes down
I hope it doesn't land on you.

When I woke up this mornin'
I fell out of my bed
I burnt my toast an' coffee
An' bumped my achin' head.

To what he really said.

I hope it will be true to you.""

A drop of a precious year
But when your best days are yester
The rest is twice as dear
What good is a field 
On a fine summer night

Or a succulent pear
That with each bite you take
You spit out a tooth with the seed
Before it's to late
Stop trying to wait for fortune
And fake you're secure of
For there's one thing to be sure of
There ain't nothing to be sure of
Oh! It's time to start living
Time to take a little 
From the world we're given
Time to take time 
For Spring will turn to Fall
In just no time at all
So when the drearies do attack
Or a siege of the sads begins
I throw these regal shoulders back
And I lift these double chins
Now here is a secret I never have told
Maybe you'll understand why
I believe if I refuse to grow old
I shall be young till I die
Now I've had my fears
And seventy years
I've had troubles and tears by the score
But the only thing I'd trade them for
Is seventy more

Who could foresee?

I'd come to feel about you

And as I glance back through the pages
I see the chances, I often took

The hills you climb
Often lead no where
Of ups and downs
I've had my share
That's what life is all about

I've known success
Some mild acclaim
And thinking of it gives me pleasure
And I've had some stress
The scars remain
When Lady Luck gave me short measure

When things went wrong
I'd fake a smile
But that's my style
'Cause I've been around
And having been being around, I've found
That's what life is all about

It's been a joy, I can't deny
Though some may think 
I took things lightly
But man and boy, I look on High
And never fail to thank Him nightly

When I look back, I can't forget

Just a jack knife has Macheath dear

Fancy white gloves has Macheath dear
So there's never, never a trace of red

Lies a body, oozin' life
Someone's sneaking 'round the corner

A cement bag is dropping down 
You know that cement is for the weight dear
You can make a large bet Macheath's in town

They all sang it, with so much feeling

When I'd be held under your thumb
I'm like a pawn in your hand

Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I'm weak, maybe I'm strong

Maybe I'll live a life of regret, 
And maybe I'll give much more than I get
But nevertheless, I'm in love with you

In spite of all I could do
I went ahead falling for you

I made my bed, that's where I'll lie

Bing Crosby,"The night is young and you're so beautiful,
Here among the shadows, beautiful lady, open you heart.
The scene is set, the breezes sing of it,
Can't you get into the swing of it, lady, when do we start?

When the lady is kissable and the evening is cool,
Any dream is permissible in the heart of a fool.
The moon is high and you're so glamorous,
And if I seem over amorous, lady, what can I do?
The night is young and I'm in love with you.",The Night Is Young and You're So Beautiful,1976
Bing Crosby,"I've sung about the birds and bees
The daffydown dillies and the shady trees
I've covered mother nature inside out.
There's the old ox road, the old millstream
Pennies from heaven and darn that dream
Nothin that I haven't sung about.

I've sung some songs of sacrifice
I've even sung a few that offered good advice.
I've covered all emotions there's no doubt.
Like a fine romance, learn to croon
Sing you sinners, and love in bloom.
Nothing that I haven't sung about.

There's many a chorus
I've sang of Delores.
Remember Marquita, and sweet Riorita?
There's Mary and Sally, and Rose Mexicali.
From Emiline to Clementine
They all got equal time.

Yes, musically I've been around
I've covered almost every town
I've always been a vocal gadabout.
From the Swanee River, to Galway Bay,
Atchison Topeka and the Santa Fe
There's nothing that I haven't sung about.

I found a million dollar baby in a ten cent store
A pockeful of dreams and plenty more
Since anything goes I pick Sweet Sue
Spose that's the natural thing to do.

We began the beguine and I could feel it start
I said please be careful that's my heart!
In the cool of the evening 'neath the autumn leaves
We call for music, maestro please!

There's a great temptation as we cuddle near
And I whispered I surrender dear.
The bells of St Mary's rang in the steeple
For all the dear friends and gentle kind of people.

I said babe I got you under my skin
It had to be you 'cause love walked in.
From here on in you'll be going my way
Til the blue of the night meets the gold of the day.

I've sung about Dolly, my Rosie of Tralee
I've sung of Chicago, and that song from Zhivago.
The old Mississippi and Tintipitipi.
The winter, summer, spring and fall
I've covered one and all
And I love 'em one and all!

I've tried to sing these modern songs
I just can't figure where that style belongs
The mad rock, acid rock, country, western, soul.
But when I try to sing 'em I ain't nowhere
I ain't got the clothes and I ain't got the hair
But I'll keep tryin' til there is no doubt
There ain't nothing, really nothing,
That I haven't sung about!

This day and age we're living in 
Gives cause for apprehension, 
With speed and new invention 
And things like fourth dimension. 
Yet we get a trifle weary 
With mr. einstein's theory, 
So we must get down to earth at times: 
Relax, relieve the tension. 
And no matter what the progress 
Or what may yet be proved, 
The simple facts of life are such 
They cannot be removed. 
Refrain 
You must remember this, 
A kiss is still a kiss, 
A sigh is just a sigh; 
The fundamental things apply, 
As time goes by. 

And when two lovers woo, 
They still say, ""I love you,"" 
On that you can rely; 
No matter what the future brings, 
As time goes by. 

Moonlight and love songs never out of date, 
Hearts full of passion, jealousy, and hate; 
Woman needs man and man must have his mate, 
That no one can deny. 

It's still the same old story, 
A fight for love and glory, 
A case of do or die; 
The world will always welcome lovers, 
As time goes by.",As Time Goes By [*],1977

As time came around, she came

Give the blues a chase, 
Find a sunny place, 
Go and change your face

With sunshine! 
Pay your doctor bills, 
Throw away his pills, 
You can cure your ills

Hang them up out in the sun, 
And they'll evaporate!

Pounding at your heart, 
Trouble will depart

He can't write his name or read a book
To fool the people is his only thought
And though he's slippery, he still gets caught
But then if that sort of life is what you wish
You may grow up to be a fish

A new kind of jumped up slippery fish

Come smilin' by and does she walk away

Honey, here's the way it's goin' to be:
You will set behind a team of snow white horses,
In the slickest gig you ever see!

Chicks and ducks and geese better scurry
When I take you out in the surrey,
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top!
Watch that fringe and see how it flutters
When I drive them high steppin' strutters.

Nosey pokes'll peek thru' their shutters and their eyes will pop!
The wheels are yeller, the upholstery's brown,
The dashboard's genuine leather,
With isinglass curtains y' can roll right down,
In case there's a change in the weather.

Two bright sidelight's winkin' and blinkin',
Ain't no finer rig I'm a-thinkin'
You c'n keep your rig if you're thinkin' 'at I'd keer to swap
Fer that shiny, little surrey with the fringe on the top! Did you say 

the fringe was made of silk
Wouldn't have no other kind but silk
Does it really have a team of snow white horses
One's like snow, the other's more like milk

All the world'll fly in a flurry
When I take you out in the surrey,
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top!
When we hit that road, hell fer leather,
Cats and dogs'll dance in the heather,
Birds and frogs'll sing all together and the toads will hop!

The wind'll whistle as we rattle along,
The cows'll moo in the clover,
The river will ripple out a whispered song,
And whisper it over and over:
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever?
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever?

Don't you wisht y'd go on forever and ud never stop
In that shiny, little surrey with the fringe on the top!
I can see the stars gettin' blurry,
When we drive back home in the surrey,
Drivin' slowly home in the surrey with the fringe on top!
I can feel the day gettin' older,
Feel a sleepy head on my shoulder,
Noddin', droppin' close to my shoulder, till it falls kerplop!

The sun is swimmin' on the rim of a hill,
The moon is takin' a header,
And jist as I'm thinkin' all the earth is still,
A lark'll wake up in the medder.
Hush, you bird, my baby's a-sleepin'!

So I grabs him by the tail and what happens
He flips his tail
I lands on his head
He flips his head
I lands on his tail

I gets an idea
I starts singing ""South Of The Border Down Mexico Way""
And what happens
The bull starts crying
But even regardless I keeps on singin'
This time with the castanets
That's too much for the bull and he collapses.

That linger in my heart

Georgia on my mind.

Bing Crosby,"Oh! they say some people long ago
Were searching for a diff'rent tune,
One that they could croon 
As only they can.

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro.
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began:

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues.

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail,
And they played that 
As part of the blues.

From a whippoorwill out on a hill,
They took a new note,
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note.

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it,
And gave out the news
That the south land 
Gave birth to the blues!",The Birth of the Blues,1991
Bing Crosby,"I used to think I could live without you,
But I admit that I changed my mind.
I go to sleep and I dream about you,
And through the day you can always find me,

There was a time I was jolly,
You know the reason I'm melancholy!

Blue and oh, so lonely,
True, I want you only.
We made a blunder,
And lots of times I wonder, dear,
If you're blue too.

But now she's gone and left me
She done turn me down

And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step

Bing Crosby,"When Madam Pompadour was on a ballroom floor
Said all the gentlemen ""Obviously,""
""The madam has the cutest personality""

And think of all the books about do Barry's looks
What was it made her the toast of Paree?
She had a well-developed personality

What did Romeo see in Juliet?
Or Figaro in Figarette?
Or Jupiter in Juno?
You know!

And when Salome danced and had the boys entranced
No doubt it must have been easy to see
That she knew how to use her personality

A girl can learn to spell and take dictation well
And never sit on the boss's left knee
Unless she's got a perfect personality

A girl can get somewhere in spite of stringy hair
Or even just a bit bowed at the knee
If she can show a faultless personality

Why are certain girls offered certain things
Like sable coats and wedding rings?
By men who wear their spats right?

With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And eyes made out of coal

Frosty, the snowman is a fairy tale, they say
He was made of snow but the children know
That he came to life one day

There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Oh Frosty, the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Look at Frosty go, thumpetty thump thump

So he said, ""Let's run and we'll have some fun
Now, before I melt away""

Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
Runnin' here and there, all around the square
Sayin', ""Catch me if you can""

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
He only paused a moment
When he heard him holler, ""Stop""

Because ol' Frosty, the snowman, he had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye sayin', ""Don't you cry

I'll be back again some day""",Frosty the Snowman,1991

I adore you when you touch me
Pin the tail upon the donkey, you will surely win
And if you don't say may I, then I'll pass the cake around
And I won't give you any, but you won't make a sound
You don't eat soap, anyhow

Red light, green light, blue light, yellow light
You can take three giant steps or a baby step will do
But if you don't say may I, then I'll march you out the door
Where you'll be contemplating the numbers one to four
I hope you're keeping score

Cause if you don't say may I, then I'll get you with the hose
And spoil your Sunday clothes Will it please you if I tease you
While you're at the spindry, I'll pass the pie around

Bing Crosby,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic 
That I always have found it best, 
Instead of getting 'em off my chest, 
To let 'em rest unexpressed, 
I hate parading my serenading 
As I'll probably miss a bar, 
But if this ditty is not so pretty 
At least it'll tell you 
How great you are. 

You're the top! 
You're the Coliseum. 
You're the top!

You're a Bendel bonnet, 
A Shakespeare's sonnet, 
You're Mickey Mouse.

You're the Tower of Pisa, 
You're the smile on the Mona Lisa 
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop, 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom you're the top! 

Your words poetic are not pathetic. 
On the other hand, babe, you shine, 
And I can feel after every line 
A thrill divine 
Down my spine. 
Now gifted humans like Vincent Youmans 
Might think that your song is bad, 
But I got a notion 
I'll second the motion 
And this is what I'm going to add; 

You're the top! 
You're Mahatma Gandhi. 
You're the top! 
You're Napoleon Brandy. 
You're the purple light 
Of a summer night in Spain, 
You're the National Gallery

You're cellophane. 
You're sublime, 
You're turkey dinner, 
You're the time, the time of a Derby winner 
I'm a toy balloon that's fated soon to pop 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top! 

You're the top! 
You're an arrow collar

You're a rose, 
You're Inferno's Dante,

You're the steppes of Russia,

What is that hauntering frame that I hear in air?
Here and there, everywhere
It's just a beautiful strain that keeps caught in my brain constantly
It's my melody, it's my symphony
Ink a dinka do, a dinka dee, a dinka doo
Oh what a tune, what a tune or crooning
Ink a dinka do, a dinka dee, a dinka doo
It's got the whole world spooning
Eskimo bells up in Iceland are ringing
They've made there own there own paradiseland singing
Ink adinka do, a dinka dee, a dinka doo
Simply means Ink a dinka dee, a dinka doo

Listen to that melody!
Listen to that melody!
Why I would add class to any concerts
You know I resent them playing my symphony in jazz 
I resent it
But they're paying me for this
So I'm helpless, really helpless
But if that's what the world wants
I'm your slave, so here it is

Ink a dinka do, a dinka dee, a dinka doo
Bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-boo
Just a crooning!
Just a crooning!
Ink a dinka do, a dinka dee, a dinka doo
[whistles inka dinka do]
Hahahahahaha
There's a little bit of Bing Crosby and me
Hahahahahaha
Eskimo bells up in Iceland are ringing
Come on Jimmy, here comes the finish, lap it up, hit it!
A dinka dee, a dinka doooo, what a voice!
What a voice, simply means
Ink, a dinka doo, a dinka dee
Goodnight folks, signin' off",Inka Dinka Doo,1993
Bing Crosby,"Must you dance every dance with the same fortunate man? 
You have danced with him since the music began.
Won't you change partners and dance with me?
Must you dance quite so close with your lips touching his face? 
Can't you see
I'm longing to be in his place?
Won't you change partners and dance with me?

Ask him to sit this one out. 
While you're alone, 
I'll tell the waiter to tell
Him he's wanted on the telephone.

You've been locked in his arms ever since heaven knows when.
Won't you change partners and then, 
You may never want to change partners again.",Change Partners,1993
Bing Crosby,"In us you see a couple of song and dance men
I'm the song
I'm the dance

For laughter, joy and happiness, we're advance men
With a song
And a dance

I sing for my supper
I dance for my lunch
I croon when the landlord comes around

For miles around the women and children pass out cold
When my voice hits the air
And my feet hit the ground

Last night
Out in the moonlight
I came to serenade
A very pretty maid
I sang her to sleep with ""Asleep in the Deep""
That always makes them collapse
I saw her eyes close, then she started to doze
But she arose when I sounded taps

Which goes to show what women will do when we're around
And my voice hits the air
And my feet hit the ground",A Couple of Song and Dance Men,1993
Bing Crosby,"

She's the luckiest one

Satin on my shoulder and a smile on my lips
How lucky can you get
Money in my pocket right at my fingertips

Every night a party where the fun never ends
You can circle the globe with my circle of friends
Someone I am crazy for is crazy for me
I'm his personal pet
Wow how lucky can you get
See her diamonds are gleam her life is a dream
Wrap it up and charge it that's my is my favorite phrase
How lucky can you get
When I see the chauffeur think I'll give him a raise
How lucky can you get
Weekends in the country with the baron of course
And a wardrobe to shock Mrs. Asters pet horse
Making merry music with the one that I love
We're a perfect duet
Gee how lucky can you
Wee how lucky can you
Wow how lucky can you get

Ain't she got fun

How lucky
When I see the chauffeur think I'll give him a raise
How lucky
Life's a bed of roses whirling perfume on me
You can spare me the blues I don't sing in that key
And if there's a man who'd leave me I am happy to say
I haven't run into him yet

Gee wee wow
How lucky, how lucky can you get!

Bing Crosby,"Please teacher, teach me something,
Nice teacher, teach me something.
I'm as awkward as a camel, that's not the worst,
My two feet haven't met yet,
But I'll be teacher's pet yet,
'Cause I'm gonna learn to dance or burst.

Nothing's impossible I have found,
For when my chin is on the ground,
I pick myself up,
Dust myself off,
Start all over again.

Don't lose your confidence if you slip,
Be grateful for a pleasant trip,
And pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

Work like a soul inspired,
Till the battle of the day is won.
You may be sick and tired,
But you'll be a man, my son!

Will you remember the famous men,
Who had to fall to rise again?
So take a deep breath,
Pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

I'll get some self assurance
If your endurance is great.
I'll learn by easy stages
If you're courageous and wait.

To feel the strength I want to,
I must hang on to your hand,
Maybe by the time I'm fifty
I'll get up and do a nifty.

Sing out loud, sing out strong
Sing of good things not bad

Bing Crosby,"Well now, the barnyard is busy, in a regular tizzy
And the obvious reason is because of the season
Ma Nature's lyrical with her yearly miracle
Spring, Spring, Spring

All the henfolk are hatchin', while their menfolk are scratchin'
To ensure the survival of each brand new arrival
Each nest is twittering, they're all babysittering
Spring, Spring, Spring

Why, it's a beehive of budding son and daughter life
Every family has plans in view
Even down in the brook, the underwater life
Is forever blowin' bubbles too

Little skylarks are larking, see them all double-parking
Cuddled up, playin'possum, they're behind ev'ry blossom
Even the bubble-ink  
Is merrily wobble-ink
Spring, Spring, Spring

In his hole, though the gopher seems a bit of a loafer
The industrious beaver puts it down to Spring fever
While there's no antelope who feels that he can't elope
Spring, Spring, Spring

Each cocoon has a tenant, so they hung out a penant
Don't disturb please, keep waiting, we're evacuating
This home's my Mama's isle, soon have my own domicile
Spring, Spring, Spring

Even out in Australia, the kangaroos
Lay off butter fat and all French fries

If their offspring are large, it might be dan-ga-roos
Why, they've just got to keep them pocket-size

Even though, to detract, Spring is more like a habit
Not withstanding, the fact is they endulge in the practice
Why, each day is Mother's Day 
The next day some other's day
Spring, Spring, Spring

To itself, each amoeba softly glows ?
While the proud little termite fills his life as a worm might
Old papa dragonfly is makin' his wagon fly
It's Spring, Spring, Spring

And from his eerie, the eagle with his eagle eye
Gazes down across his eagle beak
And a-fixing his lady with a legal eye
Screams, ""Suppose we set the date this week""

Ah, yes siree, Spring discloses, if it's all one supposes
Wagging tails, rubbing noses, but it's no bed of roses
And if for the stork you pine, consider the porcupine
Who longs to cling
Keeping comp'ny is tricky, it can get pretty sticky
In the Spring, Spring, Spring","Spring, Spring, Spring",1993
Bing Crosby,"(No Other Love)
No other love have I, 
Only my love for you! 
Only the dream we knew, 
No other love!

Wishing that you could be, 
Watching the night with me, 
Into the night I cry! 

Hurry home, 
Come home to me! 
Set me free, 
Free from doubt, 
And free from longing!

Now you'll hear
Something new
Someone's playing
The music in you

Now you're living

Bing Crosby,"On the first of May, it is moving day,
Spring is here, so blow your job,
Throw your job away!
Now's the time to trust,
To your wanderlust,
In the city's dust you wait, must you wait
Just you wait!

In a mountain greenery,
Where God paints the scenery
Just two crazy people together.
While you love your lover,
Let blue skies, be your coverlet,
When it rains we'll laugh at the weather.
And if you're good, I'll search for wood,
So you can cook... while I stand looking
Beans could get no keener reception in a beanery
Bless our mountain greenery home!

Simple cooking means
More than French Cuisines
I've a banquet planned which is
Sandwiches and beans
Coffee's just as grand
With a little sand
Eat and you'll grow fatter, boy
'smatter boy? Huh, huh! 'Atta boy.

In a mountain greenery,
Where God paints the scenery
Just two crazy people together.
How-how-how-how-how we love sequestering
Where no pests are pestering
No dear momma holds us in tether
Mosquitoes here,
Won't bite you dear,
I'll let them sting, me on the finger!

Far from life's machinery

Bing Crosby,"I wander today to the hill Maggie to watch the scene below

The creek and the creeking old mill Maggie where we sat in long long ago
The green grove is gone from the hill Maggie where first the daisies sprung

That creeking old mill is still Maggie since you and I were young
Oh they say that m feeble with age Maggie my steps are my slower that then

My face is a well written page Maggie and time all alone was the pen
They say we have our different time Maggie as they hear our song that we sung
But to me you're the same as you were Maggie when you and I were young

Bing Crosby,"We've played the game of 'stay away'
But it costs more than I can pay
Without you I can't make my way
I surrender, dear

Little mean things we were doin'
Must have been part of the game
Lending a spice to the wound
Oh, but I don't care who's to blame

When stars appear and shadows fall
Why then you'll hear my poor heart call
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear
