Useless ID,"Take a good look at your conscience now and tell me what you see,
â??Cause I'm still trying to understand the word ""companionship""
This patriotic scene of life doesn't suit me here at all!
Remember how it started: truth and friendship, nothing more

And I'm still searching for that truth,
Searching for gone youth that you have lost so long agoâ?¦
Somehow I don't know what really goes inside your mind
And who has passed the line of being wrongâ?¦
Somehow, I don't knowâ?¦

And you can't even show some dignity
No, you can't show respect!
I never criticized your way of life
But you are just trying to show me how
I'm so wrong and what to doâ?¦
Well, I don't like you point of view,
So why do we have to compete?
Why can't we just let it go and be?
Become friends once again?
I know that you can understand
That there is no, there is no one to blame
Man, if you'll just understand
That there is no point in hating so much,
There is no point in being lost!
No matter how you look, there is always two sides to the coin
You'll choose which way is better for you,
For someone else it's worst than being told how to behave,
Than feeling so much lost
Yes, so much lost",Lost Once Again,2000
Useless ID,"I can wait for hours
I can watch you from behind
You can go but I will be waiting 
Until you will come around
No one else to trust 
And there is nothing we can't do
You might say that it's a trap
But we can hold hands and break through
Break through the dreams we ever had
Nothing can divide us
Everything can change
Except from what we want
Except from how we are bond
Sometimes I can close my eyes 
And I feel I lost something inside
All the memories from our past
Keep on hitting strike by strike 
And even in the darkest tunnel 
I will always see a light
If there is somehow you can see it 
Then come hold my hand
And run run through 
The dreams we ever had
Nothing can divide us
Everything can change
Except from what we want
Except from how we want
Except from what we want
Except from how we are bond",Run,2000
Useless ID,"It's time to open up your eyes
I think it's really time to understand it can't
You see you are the only one who is playing
I don't really think that you want to use a sharp knife to cut off your standards
But I feel you know it's time to do it
So take, take the blame
Don't try to run away
A different game you have got to try it anyway
You have got nothing to lose
Don't be so confused
And still you want to give up
Cause you can't take it anymore
Feel safer on higher ground
What's been lost can't be found again.
You think you fall straight to where you belong,
It's an illusion but you are to dumb to know it
Maybe someday you will learn your lesson
Maybe some day you will wake up find you are wrong,
Hold your breath and do it!",Time to Move On,2000
Useless ID,"got out of bed today
I'm alive, what can I say?
I'm really happy to be
somewhere with someone who makes me happy.

I took the bus downtown.
all day long I walked around
I looked at all the sights
and thought about how lucky I am now.

I was sick of feeling down.
so I gave it all away.
2000 miles from all I know
and so much better off today.
I'm still waiting for the world.
to come crashing down again.
and I'm still waiting for someone
to call me up and tell me your dead.
sometimes I wonder what was
going through your head
I don't know but I won't go there again.

you make me smile so wide
when I look into your eyes.
when your not around
you know your somewhere stuck inside my mind.

Useless ID,"Knowledge is key.
You can never know too much.
Open your books aim to the stars 
Well I won't let them
Keep me from learning all I can.
Public schools just stand up.
The system feeds our minds.

Did the system tell you about democracy?
The same system that supported slavery?
And doesn't it seem strange that 
When we try to make a change
To lock us up and throw away the key.

I won't let you
Play me for a fool
Set me free to go to church
But I can't pray in school.
Make a decision for yourself
Don't bother with any trends
Open up a book
And share the knowledge with your friends.

Useless ID,"Frankie died just the other night.
Some say it was suicide,
But we know
How the story goes.

With his six string knife
And his street wise pride
The boy was a man before his time,
And she knew
All their dreams would come true.

But ya see, Frankie was fast,
Too fast to know.
He wouldn't go slow
Until his lethal dose.
And she knows
He'll finally come too close.

Well, on with the show.
Going on with the show.
Come on baby
No, no, no.
Oh my, my, my 

He was bad.
He was never good.
But one thing that he understood.
And she knew
All those lies would come true.

The time has come and
He's paid his dues.
Suzy finally got the news.
She always knew
This day would come soon.

[Chorus: x2]

He was stopped on a dime
With a switchblade knife.
Some damn punk went and
Took Frankie's life.
And she knew
She'd have to pull through.
Broken down, with his broken dreams,
With a wink of an eye
Said ""Suzy, listen to me
You must go
On with the show.""

Useless ID,"Last night I had a dream that we went to Disneyland,
Went on all the rides, didn't have to wait in line.
I drove you to your house where we stared up at the stars
I listened to your heartbeat as I held you in my arms.

We hung out at the rainbow where we drank til' half past two.
Nothing could go wrong anytime that I'm with you.
Like crashing a hotel room or leading up to that first kiss
Or searching for a high school that you know doesn't exist

These are the things that make me free
I feel like I'm stuck in ""stand by me""
This night was too good to be true.

Today I woke up alone wishing you were here with me,
I wanted us to be something that we'd probably never be.
Today you called me up and said you'd see me at our show,
But now I'm stuck debating if I even want to go.

Whitney, don't you understand here what I say is true?
I just want you to know I have a major crush on you.
I'd drive you to Las Vegas and do the things you want to do
I'd even have Wayne Newton dedicate a song to you.

I only wish that this could be
Just dump your boyfriend and go out with me
I swear I'd treat you like a queen.",San Dimas High School Football Rules,2000
Useless ID,"Today I made you a mix tape
And I decorated it with lots of stars.
It had all my favorite songs.
There was jawbreaker and armchair martain
Built to spill and the descendents.
Hell I even put one of ours on it.

Falling for you was the easy thing to do.
If only somehow I could make you hang around.

Today I made you a mix tape
To say exactly how I feel inside
And make you feel it to.
These are the songs that make me smile
And cry myself to sleep at night
When I'm lying without you.

I love you more than I ever loved anyone before.
Hey silly girl I'm begging you.

All of these songs they remind me of you
I hope that you like this song.

Do you fell the pain inside
They way that it hurts me?

I hope you'll be singing along.
And make me a tape of your favorite songs.",Song For a Mix Tape,2000

I'll ask you, ""what have you done yesterday""

Got rid of problems but they 
Just keep on getting big
I'm falling into this situation 
I've been through
I hope it won't be that way with you

A good thing to be 
Remembering if it were true

A secret to be kept inside

This time you are up against yourself
Do you wonder why?

Useless ID,"Would I worry if I wouldn't care at all
It is 3 AM here, waiting for your call
Yet another day has gone by 
And I haven't heard from you
Thursday's got me so confused

It is really odd that things are going great
One foot in the worst, the other for the best
My mind has signed a petition 
That is going all to you
It feels like a dream 
Although it's true

Wrong turn today, 
We can't find our destination
One hour late, 
Empty beds and still I'm missing you

A timing questioned for this brand new start

Useless ID,"Another endless day, I could't find a way
To spend some time on writing songs with stupid meanings
I can't find a way to make some sense
My mind is such a mess, my girlfriend says I really suck
And that my thoughts I can't express

Another sunny day, still I can't find a way
How to describe just what I feel
Maybe my brain is holding still
If there's a better way for me to sing and play
It must be silence, I'm so poor
But there's one thing I know for sure

Can't be wrong
Can't belong to what I thought that I once were
Can't be right
Cannot fight for something that's not worth it
Who's to blame
What a shame I don't really care at all

Another rainy day, I can't find a better way
To give a meaning to it all

I know tomorrow will be the same
It's only me I have to blame",Day by Day,2001

You did, a line torn right between us
Repeated glance in your eyes
Can't stand it, soon I'm going on

So for now I know as far as friendship goes

In two months I'm gone, I'll be writing you a lot
Hoping it will get through to you

The story ended here, a new one comes in clear
I never thought you'd win my best hand
Ace of hearts I fold, this win is truly yours
I hope you understand

It means a lot the soft words
You've left with me after the show
Wish you could've stayed some more
You're great too bad you had to go

You think it was such a right thing
What has been going on half a year
Still sincere to someone

And dreaming that I could hold your hand.

And I would write your name in the sand.

But I've got a bad case of broken heart.
And you're the only one who's got the cure.
And I can't live another day without seeing you smile.

All the time I think of you
Holding on to someone new
Don't make me lose my mind
Seems like I been here before
Baby I can't take no more
Of you trying to play me out baby

I feel so strange thinking about you
After all the wrong you've done to me
I can't go on feeling like I do
Cause my heart loves you
I'm so confused

All the time I think of you
Holding on to someone new
Don't make me lose my mind

Of you trying to play me out baby

Don't waste my time
Cause someone like me you'll never find
I thought we had a good thing
But I was wrong and now I must move on

To another love one that I can trust
With my heart I know she'll never run away
Just can't talk no more
So I'm out the door
Talk to me
Why you wanna play love games

That I love you so (and I'll never let you go oh-no)

You make me (you make me) you make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you

Before anything began between us
You were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to
When me and my girl was having problems
You used to say it'll be ok
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I go home at night and lay my head down
Last thing I think about was you
And how

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you

I think about a ring and all the things that come along with you

Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
I think about a ring and all the things that come along with you

Now what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up
Knowing it should have been you
What's sad is that I love her but I'm falling for you
What should I do
Should I tell my baby bye-bye
Should I do exactly what I feel inside
Could I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do

At this point the situation's out of control
I never meant to hurt her
But I gotta let her go
And she may not understand it
While all of this is going on
I tried, I tried to fight it
But the feeling's just too strong

You make me wanna
You make me wanna
You make me wanna

You make me wanna

I'll freak you wherever you want

Caressing you so nice and slow
Oh how I want you
Girl there's something I want you to know

Whenever I'm near you
My love just comes down
Whenever I see you
I just want you around
Cause I want to feel you
All through the day and the night
Whenever I'm near you
It feels like bedtime

Do you get lonely?
(I get so lonely)
Thinking about me
(thinking about you)

Am I the only
(girl I think of or dream of at all)
Are you into ,out your mind for me? Say you can't go a day without me
(girl I need you and I want you girl I need you I need you I need you)

Whenever I'm near you
My love just comes down
Whenever I see you
I just want you around
Cause I want to feel you

Before anything began between us
You were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to
When me and my girl was having problems
You used to say it'll be OK
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I go home at night and lay my head down
Last thing I think about was you
And how

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you

Now what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up
Knowing it should have been you
What's sad is that I love her but I'm falling for you
What should I do
Should I tell my baby bye-bye
Should I do exactly what I feel inside
Could I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together

At this point the situation's out of control
I never meant to hurt her
But I gotta let her go
And she may not understand it
While all of this is going on
I tried, I tried to fight it
But the feeling's just too strong
You make me, make me

You make me wanna

I knew you were the man

The magic in your eyes, made me realize
That everything I feel, has got to be real

'Cause I got a dime and a girl who love me 
And when we alone she ain't all lovey dovey 
Smacks me on the ass and says fast nigga fuck me 

And uh I don't do nothing for my baby girl to not trust me 
I don't do nothing for her to bust me 
I would love her if her rings were rusty
Feet were crusty and arms were musty 

'Cause ain't nobody gettin' that just me 
And ain't nobody hittin' that just me 
If I cheat I know that she will bust me, crush me 
'Cause she know how many girls lust me 

Back in the day they wouldn't even touch me 
Now they say they don't want nobody but me 
To tell the truth, them girls just disgust me 
'Cause I already found the one that love me

It's all good lovin' somebody 
As long as somebody loves you back 

Mess with her? I ain't have to 
But player I was glad to brown skin dove 
But her love won't pass you promised her a ring 
Along with a shine never stressin' my rhyme 

All she wanted is time, where you find her at 
'Cause you a grimy cat 
Puffin' dime sacks to see where my mind be at 
And I told my other niggas that I told her yo 

I don't always have to hit the twat 
Just to get you hot you don't believe me 
Then pick a spot but remember, I lick a lot 
Ayyo she likes to trick a lot just to get a bigger knot 

Loves to see her nigga hot worries if I'm jigged or not 
And her stuff hot and divine 
And the things she cops top of the line 
Baby is hot and divine always poppin' some wine 
And then she told me Cam, I got a rock on my mind

It feels good when you love em' 
And they lovin you back go tit for tat 
Never scratch your back 
Matter of fact she touches and grabs 

Not to lust you bad just to get you mad 
When we alone she screams and moans 
She don't front on me 'cause she don't want to be alone 
Come on everybody needs somebody 

Ay Papi, take her out 
Uh-huh no doubt 
Then we lace her out 
Uh-huh no doubt 
Then we ski her out 

Ski her out 

Then we eat her out 

Eat her out 

Come on, where your man at? 
Where's your plans at?

Don't check me
It was your girl who let me
Take it this far then, ooh wee
She had to have every chance that she could get

Say whatever you want but she still gon' give it up
Cause she likes it..

I told my man I'm having a barbecue
So grab some folks and won't you slide right through
He brought this shorty that I used to know
It brought me back to when I was in school
She said, ""Usher where have you been?
We used to kick it every now and then
Remember when I used to call your phone
And tell you come on 'cause my mama's gone
How about them times I had to throw a rock at your window
To let you know
To come downstairs and open the door?
And after that, baby, it was on, fa sho""

Now, honey got my head spinning around, for real
'Cause I'm thinking 'bout how good you used to feel

Now, she's asking me to take her
On a tour around my house so we can catch up
For all the time lost since I blew up
And became the man that drops his pants and every girl around the world is dying to love
Break the beat down, let me tell you what I'm talking about
If you're not careful, it'll turn you out
It's that way she used to go when you want it nice and slow
Even though you can't, the memory will make you want some more
She used to understand me, touch me, hold me
Taught me how to be a man
She used to kiss me, all them things she used to show me
Damn, I wish that I could do it again

Honey got my head spinning around, for real
Cause I'm thinking ‘bout how good you used to feel
But I got a girl now and, yo, she's right upstairs

Ain't nothing like some good old ghetto (good old ghetto)

Never had somebody that's so bad
Somebody with a whole lot of body
Attitude that'll make you wanna leave the one you with
'Cause you know how good it is
Not a prissy, little missy, baby, talk that slang
I used to love how she kissed me when she popped that thing
She was a friend of the fam, hot without the glam, not
When I be tripping, she didn't really give a damn, stop
It's what I need to do 'cause I know what this is leading to
If I keep on thinking about that back and I'm gonna be right back in it

Usher,"Yeah, ay yo
2000 it's us
Yo, it's time to u-turn
Ya heard me?
You're either with us, or against us, yo

It's been some years now
Since we hit the floor to get down
We always had a step to go with the sound
Now everybody want to sit around, drink and ball
Remember, the snake
And how the floor used to clear
And everybody would break
What's crunk now used to be called getting to it
We're bringing it all back
This is how we do it, just

Put your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, get down with me
Oh come on, come on
It's not hard to learn
Come on, come on
It's called the u-turn

Put your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, get down with me
Oh come on, come on
It's not hard to learn
Come on, come on
It's called the u-turn

In the 80s, fresh was the talk
MJ had everybody doing the moonwalk
In the 90s, I had a high flat top
Doing the wop, Pee Wee to the Reebok
I can't forget about my high school days
The sound was Bobby Brown
The dance was the running man
Now everybody want to push Bentley's
The year is two, everybody do the u-turn

Put your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, get down with me
Oh come on, come on
It's not hard to learn
Come on, come on
It's called the u-turn

Put your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, get down with me
Oh come on, come on
It's not hard to learn
Come on, come on
It's called the u-turn

All you need to do is let go
Let the tempo take over you
I came to have a good time
Let the rhythm deep inside your soul
Let it lead you to the floor, whoa

Put your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, get down with me
Oh come on, come on
It's not hard to learn
Come on, come on
It's called the u-turn",U-Turn,2000

You were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to
When me and my girl was having problems
You used to say it'll be OK
Suggest little nice things I should do

Now what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up
Knowing it should have been you
What's sad is that I love her but I'm falling for you
What should I do
Should I tell my baby bye-bye
Should I do exactly what I feel inside
'Cause I, I don't want to go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together

Spinning around in the crowd cause she found me
And when she started moving closer and closer
Does she know that i want her, I want her

I've never had a loss for words

Tucked in my pant leg in the tongue of my Timbs

It's been some years now
Since we hit the floor to get down
We always had a step to go with the sound
Now everybody want to sit around, drink and ball
Remember, the snake
And how the floor used to clear
And everybody would break
What's crunk now used to be called getting to it
We're bringing it all back
This is how we do it, just

MJ had everybody doing the moonwalk
In the 90s, I had a high flat top
Doing the wop, Pee Wee to the Reebok

The sound was Bobby Brown
The dance was the running man
Now everybody want to push Bentley's
The year is 2 - everybody do the you-Turn

I met her back in high school, used to dig out her homies
She never snitched on me 'cause baby was in love
I was all she would dream of all she would think of
She worked nine to five, I rolled up smokin bud
Independent baby loved to live life exqist
From Atlanta G.A. and plus she new how to kick it
She wan't an erotic stripper
Dancin that's where I first met
Sayin' to myself ""I gots to go get her""
Waved a hundred doller bill in the air
Said come here baby pulled up a chair
Got you shakin my very dear
That's when I said baby you the one work it the best
I say you the bomb and stuck a five down her chest
Buzzin lovin the scean was all what it seem
For me to get inside her world was all aplayers dream
She picked me up in a six hundreed 
Music bangin and thumpin and the only thing she had to say ha ha

How you make me want to leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you 
This is what you do
Thinkin bout her and the thangs that come long ways
You make me you make me

Girl, cheack it out

At this point a situation I controlled
I never ment to hurt her 
but I, gotta let her go (gotta let her go)
and she may not understand
While all of this is going on
I try I try to fight but the feelings just to strong

She said you Daz what's your fantsay
but you ain't ever had a pieace of pieace of ass like me
and when you get it once baby you can laugh at me
and then she worked it on a player so drastically
Baby got nasty when we least expected
The one who get so drunk and get butt naked
We don't be trippin when we walk inside the club
Chillin like a villain sayin what you thinkin of

Hey, what's up?
That's you
Yeah listen

Baby I know we said it's best we don't talk no more
But I got to get this off my chest about all the shit I've been hearing babe I
I thought you were that ride or die
You will never leave my side
I even made you out to be the woman that I will be with for life 
I took in your kids did everything that you wanted me too
Heard about frontin' on radio and the fuse
Don't make me feel good to lie, even though you make me wanna cry
Hey, if you gonna tell anything, then you should have told everything
Instead of making me the bad guy
If you got nothing good to say then don't say nothing
'Cause if I really start talking it'll be something
So you cheated, I cheated

Had it made, sorry for the ricochet
But I'd be in the grave if I didn't let it spray

So so Def

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side, said she got one on the way
These are my confessions, man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all (all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (call)
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions (if you got something to confess too right now, step to the mic, Twista)

I confess about the incident when I was with a shorty in the Lexus coupe
Ya homie said she saw me but she didn't have proof
But I knew I really should've just been tellin' you the truth
And I confess about the days I was rollin' my Seville with the custom gold grill
I was in the field still lookin' for a thrill
And I knew it was bogus I should've kept it real
And I confess that, just when I thought I could really try to get away
While having other women on the side
But I never knew that it would catch up wit' a nigga one day
You gotta hear me girl, I done learned a lesson'
If you stay with me then it'll be a blessin', no stressing
It'll never be no guessin'
'Cause I pulled one out my heart and these are my confessions

I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions 

Man, how did she bring it up? How did she break it down?
Man, you at the clinic? Dog, slow down that's your child
But if you keep it, then you gotta tell your girl you was cheatin'
And you went raw dog when you beat it
That's when she gon' tell you to beat it
You know it ain't y'all little secret, you famous you can't go nowhere
Cause everytime you go there, it's hoes there
So basically you and your girl over
I know when she broke the news you told her ""Man, don't say that""
Matter fact like Pat don't say jack
Everytime a nigga sittin' on pay stacks
Things come up from way, way, way back

Way back, way back, way way back

And this by far is the hardest thing I think that I ever had to do

I really made you out to be the woman that I would be with for life

I tooked in your kids, Did everything that you wanted me to
Now I see you frontin on radio interviews
Do It make you feel good to lie even though I know you wanna cry
Hey if you were gonna tell them You should of told them everything, Instead of Makein me the bad guy

'Cause if I really start talkin it will be somthin,
So you cheated, I cheated so be it,we need to Leave it alone, Move on
{You got real shit}

Hello, you have a collect call from the Clinton correctional facility, 
Will you accept the charges.
Yes, I'll accept it, whats up?

Sittin in my cell, HEAD ABOUT TO BURST
Wouldnt be alive if I didn't shoot first
Had it made, sorry for the ricochet
But I'll be in da grave if I didn't let it spray

I never said that I was perfect
Nobody walkin on this earth is
That night, I would've gotten murdered
If I ain't grab the ratchet and let them cowards have it

Uh, listen up listen up listen up world
Listen up listen up listen up world, uh, I gotta confess
This the hottest remix I ever did in my life so so def

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side, said she got one on the way {Way}
These are my confessions, man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta keep part 2 of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all, (all yeah, yeah)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (call)
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to keep part 2 of my confessions

If you got something to confess to right now step to the mic Twista

I confess about the incident when I was with a shorty in the Lexus coupe
Ya homie said she saw me but she didn't have proof
But I knew I really should've just been tellin' you the truth (uh, oh)
And I confess about the days I was rollin' my Seville with the custom gold grill
I was in the field still lookin' for a thrill

And I knew it was bogus I should've kept it real
And I confess that, just when I thought I could really try to get away
While havin other women on the side
But I never knew that it would catch up wit' a nigga one day

You gotta hear me girl, I done learned a lesson'
If you stay with me then it'll be a blessin', no stressing
It'll never be no guessin'
'Cause I'm pouring out my heart and these are my confessions

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side, said she got one on the way {Way}

Man you at the clinic, dawg slow down that's yo child
But if you keep it, then you gotta tell your girl you was cheatin

And you went raw dog when you beat it
That's when she gon' tell you to beat it
You know it ain't y'all little secret
You famous you can't go nowhere 'cause everytime you go there

There's hoes there so basiclly you and your girl over
I know when she broke the news you told her ""man don't say that""
Matter fact like Pat don't say,matter fact dont say jack,
Everytime a nigga sittin on paystacks
Things come up from way way way back way back way back way way back

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say

Hope that 'cha fine, wanna know what you got in mind, and I'm,
Got me fiendin' like Jodeci, girl, I can't leave you alone,
Take a shot of this here Patron' and it's gon' be on,
V.I.P. done got way too crowded,
I'm about to end up callin' it a night,
You should holla at your girl, tell her you shakin' the scene,
Pull off, beep-beep, shotgun in the GT with me
She said, ""Ohhh-ohhh, I'm ready to ride, yeah""

Don't mean to sound impatient, but you gotta promise, baby, ohh

Sometimes wanna be your lover,
Sometimes wanna be your friend,
Sometimes wanna hug ya,
Hold hands, slow-dance while the record spins,
Opened up your heart 'cause you said I made you feel so comfortable,
Used to play back then, now you all grown-up like Rudy Huxtable,
I could be your Bud, you could beat me up,
Play-fight in the dark, then we both make love,
I'd do anything just to feel your butt,
Why you got me so messed up?
I don't know, but you gotta stop trippin',
Be a good girl now, turn around, and get these whippings,
You know you like it like that,
You don't have to fight back,
Here's a pillow-fight that,
And I'll be settin' separate plays,
So on all these separate days,
Your legs can go they separate ways

Tell me again (Tell me again, my baby)
That we'll be Lovers and Friends (Oh, it's a good look baby)
Tell me again (Tell me over and over and over again)

But you ain't been nuttin' but a friend to me (shawty),
And a nigga never ever dreamed we'd be (shawty),
Up in here, kissin', huggin', squeezin', touchin' (shawty),
Up in the bathtub, rub-a-dubbin' (shawty),
Are you sure you wanna go this route? (shawty),
Let a nigga know before I pull it out (shawty),
I would never ever cross the line (shawty),
Shawty, let me hear ya tell me one mo' time one mo' time

Now I'm wishing I could throw me back
To that exact spot where we fell L-O-V-E at
Lose some then I lose again, when am I gonna win some?
I said a lot of things out of anger, but I meant some
I brought a lot of things to the table, besides income
I just want things to go back how they use to be
I was use to you, and I thought you were use to me
Time was against me
You never miss something 'till it's gone
That's my word ma, you convinced me
It might not happen, but I'm still hopin'
And my heart is broken, but the door is still open
Pillow still soakin', your boy still loakin'
Dutch still lit, and a bottle still open
And if I don't get another chance
It might be hard to get focused

Welcome, today, to the wonderful world of you
Now, check it, you have two options:
You can eat it or throw it away

See, it's a shame that when you're working hard and doing well 
People hate you
Buying nothing else but the best for yourself
They really hate you
You gotta live for you and no one else
Don't let them make you feel
Like you're not being real
Just live how you wanna live
You gotta do for you

(Dig that)
If you work hard, play hard (dig that)
And do what you wanna do (dig that)
Just pop your collar, don't let what people say bother you (dig that)
You perpetrators, I got something to say (dig that)
You can eat it or throw it away (picture that)
You're just mad 'cause you're following in my trap
But can you dig that?

Hey, ladies (yeah)
Hey, fellas (yeah)
You know you're doing good 'cause they're jealous
They only hate you cause you're a go-getter
Pop your collar, don't let them sweat you

Hey, fellas (yeah)
You know you're doing good 'cause they're jealous
They only hate you cause you're a go-getter
Pop your collar, don't let them sweat you

You can see me every week
Hanging out with a different girl sitting next to me
'Cause I'm not about to settle down right now
I gotta be free
Some of y'all fellas might be jealous
But y'all know that don't phase me
I just pop my collar, tip my hat
And turn my back on the ones that hated me

(Dig that)
Never going home alone (dig that)
If she follows, then you know it's on (dig that)
She use the pager, not the cellular phone (dig that)
I let her know I won't be around for long (dig that)
To all you haters, I got something to say (what's that?)
You can eat it or throw it away (picture that)
Stop hating, wishing, waiting
Anticipating for my heat to fade

You know you're doing good 'cause they're jealous
They only hate you 'cause you're a go-getter
Pop your collar, don't let them sweat you

I break my neck for the things I get
So much sweat, just so I can get that check
And I'm not gonna let nobody bring me down
Nobody's gonna steal the crown
Because I eat good, I live good
I rock good, my life good
If you got a lot and you're working for it
Pop your collar, don't be afraid to show it

You get beat dead, that means you dead meat

You'll get ripped apart, that's it with darts, you kids ain't smart
Pop, pop, pop, I lit the dark ??? come get some heart
That's courage and brain, 'caine on several strips
Not from Houston, but shit, call me *Lil' Flip*

When I flip coke and flip boats, come live a little
And you best be knowin', pussy still is the best thang goin'

But I clap that boy, kidnap and wrap that boy
Clap, ""We reeeeeeadddy"" I'ma mastered boy like Pastor Troy
But I'm stoned sucka, with my nigga Bone Crusher
Baby, we like to bone, all our chicks are bone crushers
We got guns in coupes, in case our sun'll roof
No basketball, when we talkin', run and shoot

[Chorus x2] 

Aiyyo, the 40 cal' is full and I'm waitin'
No matter what county I'm in, ???
Muah baby, you know who it is, the kiss of death
If the world was sucka free, it just be me and my niggaz left
I ain't neva scared, I got big hammers everywhere
In places where you need yo passport at, I'm heavy there
It's time we get even here, when I put the game back
In it's proper perspective, this time leave it there
You can think whachu want, til I blow the back of yo brains out
and see if you can think with yo front
Like a new single, make sure you leak for a month
Treat yo face like a buffet, and tell my niggaz ""Eat whachu want""
You'ono nuthin' about puttin' a couple hundred thousand on the table
And tell yo niggaz ""Keep whachu want""
It's usually hate or somethin' stupid that a nigga die for
So whachu think we outside for?

[Chorus x2]

You turned my Maybach back seat
Into the Hotel De'Paris
I ain't gotta go
Down to the go-go
You got a private show that's like magic city
I got stacks of fifties
I got piles of hundreds
That's role play
Act like you want it

You throw that body

Got no 1's got no 5's

See I met her at this party in Atlanta
Well I met her at this party in Chicago

I said do you got a man she said no, with no hesitation
Well it must be a music thing cause she said the same to me
At a party all in my face, when I'm laughin' and buyin' her drinks

She whispered in my ear and said can you take me home

So won't you come sit and talk to me
And tell me how we're gonna be together always
Hope you know that when this late at night
I hold on to a pillow tight
I think about how you promised me forever
I never thought that anyone could make me feel this way
Now that you're here boy all I want is just a chance to say

Get out (leave) right now
It's the end of you and me
It's too late (now) and I can't wait for you to be gone

And I wonder (why) how I bought all the lies
You said that you would treat me right
But you were just a waste of time (waste of time)

Tell me why you looking so confused
When I'm the one that didn't know the truth
How could you ever be so cold?
You go behind my back and call my friend
Boy you must've fall and bumped your head
'Cause you left your number on her phone
So now that after all that you've said and done
Maybe I'm the one to blame but
To think that you could be the one

Promise I'll leave her moanin'
Now she zonin'
Tellin' me she's all alone and
Love the dark chocolate tone and
Ahead of my time, I live what's said in my rhymes
The cars and the chedda is mine

Cash all in my holsters
Burn more bread than toasters

Back on the track again, that's what's happenin'

I can make the bitches grin
Cause I get money and run with the richest men
Knockin' at ya door it's Curry again
Been down since the jump off begin
You know who I am

Get the cash to my hands be all blistered up
We can pick it up, we can drop it low
Recognize what it is when I come through the door

Usher,"Last month I spent two weeks on a vacation
I had a dream that I was inside of my PlayStation
Did you ever lay down, take a nap and loose it?
I dreamt I was stuck in this game called Rap Music
I started off underground in a dark room
With a freestyle, a sawed-off pump and a harpoon
That transform to a pen in case of a words war
And opened the first door that led to the first floor
I got attacked by a couple of rap acts
They wore dreads, these army pants and these backpacks
I hit one over the head with a broken verb
The muthafucka tried to hit me with some spoken word
But it didn't work, and I finished him and his boys
And disappeared from the scene without makin' a noise
I used up four bars but I earned a punchline
And proceeded to Level 2: Land of the Unsigned

[Chorus]
We don't play those games
Would you listen here?
What I'm doin he're?
Get me outta here

We don't play those games
This is gettin' wild
Can you tell me how?
Let me out now

We don't play those games
How'd I get in here?
Let me outta here
What I'm doin' here?

We don't play those games
This is no fun
Got me on the run
Rap 2K1

I got attacked right away when I walked in
By a four-foot manager with a contract and a pen
I put up my force shield to block any attempt
At this shrimp drainin' my life twenty percent
The floor opened up and I almost fell inside
But I used my mic right, I swung to the other side
And just when I thought I avoided the booby trap
I got slapped by a female MC with a doobie rag
And this chick was tryin' to be herd like she raised cattle
But I remembered somethin' I seen on the Blaze Battle
Whoever sold you them shoes, they fooled you
I killed her with a verse about her fucked up weave and her fake FUBU
A record exec then appeared in a black limo
And started to attack with a bag full of wack demos
And I will admit: it was hard as hell to kill
So I stabbed him with an invoice and a studio bill

[Chorus]

I made it to the next level: Above Ground
My soundscanner then picks up on this bug sound
I pull out the sawed-off pump and I get it cocked
And that's when this A&R crawled from under a rock
And start shootin' opinions, I stop, drop and I roll
Cause if they was to hit me, they'd penetrate to my soul
I hid behind some trees and I held my weapon tightly
His street team was up on the roof tryin' to snipe me
It took a while to finish em all but I finally did it
Then out comes this powerful beast known as the critic
With a fully loaded magazine and mad drama
My harpoon shots just bounced off of his armor
Now I wish I would've stayed down in the dark caves
I'm runnin' towards these big-ass fans with these sharp blades
But he was right behind me holdin' a flame thrower
So I jumped through the blades and I died, game over

Scandalous partners whose grammar hammers the hard shit
Into your heart with content, yo, who wanna start with?

MC's get stuck, head first back in they mother's womb
This shit is written, in my eyes I'm the illest MC spittin'
Leaving all of you cats shitting kittens
I gotta diss you, my niggas be cocking pistols
Shot and split you, fuck splitting the profits with you
Six percent of y'all niggas is just pretend
Cliques with clits, pussy niggas stink with dicks
Niggas act bully and blast for the fast penny
My auto is fully, plenty of niggas packing semi
Speak darts; yo, you get paid?
Rhyming about it is the sweet part
You can't be street smart with a cheap heart
5'9"", a street nigga with deep feeling
I keep illing, my steez willing to keep killing
Fuck rap! A lot of y'all all is just acts
Trust that, you rhyme all wack on rough tracks
Bust and then we all black when you get bust back at
Fuck that, you get blast at, you get laughed at
And I'ma spit thunder, stick to my guns
Niggas is finished before they gimmicks; one-hit wonders
What? Big balls, that's why when I spit, your clique stalls
I'm a pitbull, I'm just dog, I'm just raw
Split y'all, holler, ""It's on!"", then I diss y'all
All of y'all niggas get pissed on claiming you pissed off

You can jump right out of the screen and barely move me
We hard-hittin', directing and starring in it

That'll drive off of the Grand Canyon
Hop out of a Grand Am and land in it handstandin'
Any man plannin' to battle will get snatched outta his clothes
So fast it'll look like an invisible man standin'
I'm headed for Hell, I'd rather be dead or in jail
Bill Clinton, hit this – and you better inhale!
‘Cause any MC that chooses to go against me
Is getting taking advantage of like Monica Lewinsky
Came home in a frenzy
Pushing a ten speed, screaming to Aunt Peg
With three spokes sticking outta my pant leg
Fuck a headache! Give me a migraine, damn it, I like pain
You should be anywhere that a mic ain't
You rap knowing you wack
You act up and I'm throwing you down a flight of steps
Then I'm throwing you back up them
If they don't like the track, fuck 'em! The rap struck 'em
Harder than getting hit by a Mack truck and then backed up on
And any half-assed known rapper to trespass
Better be ready for the second Celebrity Deathmatch
So tell the medic to bring the medication and quickly
I'm sicker than a 2Pac dedication to Biggie
I'm free-falling feet first out of a damn tree
To stampede your chest 'til you can't breathe
And when I'm down to my last breath
I'ma climb the Empire State Building
And get to the last step and still have half left

Usher,"Usher Usher, yeah man, true story,
Real G's wit me on this one, ya, ya, ya, ya

[Verse 1]
Wifey home, wedding band I'm a lucky man,
You'd think I'd be satisfied and truthfully yes I am,
But lately, only late at night I find it hard to sleep,
Stay struggling with the part of me that wants to run the streets,
My Mac is in my backpack, I'm surfing on the sites,
I'm chatting, this ain't cheating, just telling myself a lie,
And it's almost like I'm caught up and living another life,
Man I'm hungry for something, I need to feed this appetite

[Chorus]
Tempted I must confess, but I better not make a mess,
Better give my girl my best put my b.s. under arrest,
Cause I love my lady,
Fellas if ya love your girl fight that appetite for the ladies, appetite for the ladies,
Could'a picked up the phone, could of ended up doing wrong,
Man I miss home, but I ate my dinner at home, cause I love my lady,
Fellas if ya love your girl fight that appetite for the ladies, appetite for the ladies,

[Verse 2]
I'm not trying to be late, rush through security gates,
With weather in Atlanta, all out going flights delayed,
No rooms left in the Mandarin, I gotta figure out a play,
Sparked up some conversation, she was going the same way,
We started talking business, she handed me a card,
We exchanged information, I rented me a car,
While I'm driving she calling, I'm thinking this is how it starts,
Fine as hell but I don't wanna break my baby?s heart, no no no.

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
They call me U.S.H.E.R R.A.Y.M.O.N.D,
And I just wanna do right by my lady,
But lately I been slippin' up, fantasies bout dimes on the side,
Dark tint on my ride, I gotta 10 in ride, I can hide,
I can't lie lie, but ever since I put that band on my hand,
More and more chicks trying to get at me,
Then I don't know what to do,
Just trying to handle my grown man B.I,
Got a girl I don't want to lose, I don't want to lose,
Break her heart, I do want to do, I don't want to be that fool,
Make that move,
Bend them a bit, but never break the rules, bend a bit but never break the rules

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
She got the door locked, and the lock don't fit, your key,
Yeah you punching up her numbers in the ADT,
You'll be wondering how the hell I let this happen to me,
Better not feed feed feed that appetite,
Now your baby's gone, you putting out an APB
And some other brother, been tossing up your PYT
Get caught slippin' you gone wish you would of listened to me,
Brother don't feed feed feed that appetite.

Usher,"Woah woah wooah yeeah yeeah
Saw you for you yeah

Remember

You changed my life in so many ways
I just think back to, how I used to be
And how you dealt with me
Just want to thank you

Just in case I never see your face again (face again)
Just in case the worst was meant to happen (happen)
Just in case tomorrow never come there is something you should know (should know)
I've given you every bit of the man I am (of the man I am)
I know at times it wasn't pretty but it was all I had
I never held back not one lil' bit and the world can attest to this
And baby you flipped my program upside down (listen to me now)

I was a hustler and player girl before I met you
I'd drink a lil' something then hit a lil' something
But how you made a difference, look what I've been missing
You got my life together and I thank you forever
I really used to throw a lot
But I do one every night and sometimes I had two
But all that done changed my game my frame of mind you got it right
And I love you life girl I love you for life

There was so many times I wasn't there for you
And for everyone of those times I hated myself for
The way I went about it the ups and the downs one foot in while the other foots out
Loving on you loving on another and I ain't no different from any of the brothers
What I did to you right here right now in this here place
In this here space as my heart pour out as I state my case as I break it down
To tell you where I'm coming from so you've seen the good you've done
So you've feel the change you've made stay with me everyday

I was a hustler and player girl before I met you
I'd drink a lil' something then hit a lil' something
But how you made a difference, look what I've been missing
You got my life together and I thank you forever
I really used to throw a lot
But I do one every night and sometimes I had two
But all that done changed my game my frame of mind you got it right
And I love you life girl I love you for life

Girl if I died tonight before I wake
Know that you touched my life in oh so many ways
And sugar this song is this I had to give would you remember
Remember my heart remember it was good remember that I tried as long as I could
Remember that I gave till I had nothing else remember my voice

I was a hustler and player girl before I met you
I'd drink a lil' something then hit a lil' something
But how you made a difference, look what I've been missing
You got my life together and I thank you forever
I really used to throw a lot
But I do one every night and sometimes I had two
But all that done changed my game my frame of mind you got it right

Usher,"I mean usher is this what it come to man
This is how we gon' do it
I mean I making grass grow baby, ya know
Seeds become plants
Boys become men
Want we gon' do

Wrapped around our girls like pashminas
Whats my demeanor
The grass is always greener on the other side
To think of I cant give her a ring up
I couldn't give a fuck
I could I give a finger
Let alone half baths and closets
So claustrophobic if there were close objects
Now its sort of like two door garages
Its like two broads minagin'
Your the best mama!

Is there any chance
That you remember me being any more than just a horrible man
And would you consider
Pullin' this trigger
And taking a second shot at romance
Oh Babe,
I want the days when you were my girl
And I was your man,
Know I took you for granted,
But it wasn't until now I see how much I miss you
Girl I'm sorry that I ran the streets acting like a damn fool, yeah
But for once, here goes the truth

I can't be fake I can't be phonie
Acting all hard thats the niggas thats lonely
I tried to flex but I confess that when you left you took the very best thing
The best things that ever happened to me
You took my best thing,
The best thing that I ever seen
You took the best thing that I ever seen
You took the, the best thing that I ever had
And now all I feel is stress cause when you left you took the very best

Remember Mimi or Vita, remember Isha or Eva
I ain't got em no more, hey yes
Niomi or Jenny, the same outcome is chillin'
Girl, I let em all go
No more trickin' and kissin' miscellaneous chicks
Acting like a jerk, woman I been to church
And I talked to the bishop and he wanted me to share this with ya
How much I miss you

I'm so sorry that I ran the streets acting like a damn fool

I can't be fake I can't be phonie

You took the best thing that I ever seen
You took the, the best thing that I ever had

Mama tried t o told me
Hovie Hov better slow it down
You gon' lose your best thing
If you keep gettin' round
Like PAC needed pot
When you old to hold you down
Ma forever young was forever numb
Sorry states are sorry done
Your million and all of them
All of em was funny time
It wasn't you it was him
School me once school me twice
Three times and I was dumb
Now its so plant the seed in me
I got the one

Usher,"Do I remind you of the pain
That he put you through, girl
Is that the reason I'm to blame
Before I do it...

Is it because he, treated you badly
I always stand accused
Protecting yourself, from somebody else
I'm not who's hurting you girl

And it's killing me girl knowing you compare me to him
Always guilty before the sin
I can't win, I can't win no
I'll do anything to prove I love you
Baby girl but I refuse to
Pay for something I didn't do
I love you, girl
But I refuse to stay
Paying for his mistakes

He left a scar across your heart
I understand, girl
Don't let his wrongs tear us apart
Cause girl I'm your man

Just because he did
You swear I'm cheating
You think I just don't care
Why must I do time
For another man's crime
Girl you know that ain't fair

And it's killing me girl knowing you compare me to him
Always guilty before the sin
I can't win, I can't win no
I'll do anything to prove I love you
Baby girl but I refuse to
Pay for something I didn't do
I love you, girl
But I refuse to stay
Paying for his mistakes

I know he did you wrong
But tell me what does that have to do with me
Trying to show you something real
Figure out what is going on
Before you look up and I'll be gone...

I'll do anything to prove I love you
Baby girl but I refuse
To pay for something I didn't do, girl
I love you, and I love you I love you

In the month of June
Beautiful like the moons
Reflection when its passing off your skin

It's been a long time
I say OK k k k
Don't worry I got you
Then you say!
How bout some foreplay
I got that got plenty
I got you
Then you say,
Play some slow whine
Got that Sade, Al Green, and Marvin Gaye to

To love you gently
Let me love you gently

Lay back relax
Girl I'ma be
Light as a feather
Hard as a rock
Cause daddy know just what you like

Gonna love you
Gently
Light as a feather
But hard as a rock

See I know just when to finish
And I know just wen to start
And I be lovin' your reaction
Every time I hit that spot
Gently but it's soft like leather
Gently but the top is hard
Whisper your pleasures
And then do my job

Make it rain intense
Girl let me do what I do
I don't know whats echoing louder
The music or you

Gently I supposed to be done yet
But you gettin' real warm
Like the comin' of thunder
Right after the storm

You say you say
Do you say girl

Gonna push you to the limit
Its yours its yours
See I can place and win the race
I'ma be your number one
To the sunshine

Here comes the sun
Lets try to touch the moon again
Forevermore

Let me touch you
Gently thats the sound of love
Take them shades off the wall

But hard as rock

This might not be in the bedroom
But I'ma love you girl

Light as a feather
But hard a s rock

Let me touch you,

But hard as a rock

Now, now she loved me, shawty I loved her
Used to jump up in the Maybach and roll out
Used to care, she used to share
The love that she used to give me can't be found
I lost my way, she said she'd stay
And lately I've been sleeping with a ghost
My stock is down and out, I used to be worth my weight in gold
That was before a great depression kicked in and rocked us
And that was before the hurricane came, came in and stopped us
I told you to leave, but you lied to me
When you said that, ""baby no worries I promise to get us back"".

Her heart is obliterated, I'm trying to travel through

We rarely even ever say a word
I really want to give her everything she deserves
But the bad took away the good
She thinks that I'm full of it, arguments, always pissed, man I'm tired
Every kiss that I miss, girl you know I'm trying
You never believe when I say, and I never believe it when you say
I love you, and I shouldn't complain about it
I should take it like a man and walk up out it
Cause we will never be the same, oh
I've been standing in gas, and you have been the flame

I know sorries just wouldn't do it
Her heart is obliterated, I'm trying to get through

It feels so wrong, I'm barely holdin' on

See no matter what it takes, I've gotta get it together (baby yea)

And these hills that I'm travelin' up
She ain't showin' me love
I'm down on my love

We both know that I've been running so long

Someone tell me
What's a man to do
When he's loving two.
And he don't wanna lie
But he can't tell the truth
What's a man to do
When he's loving two.
But he can't keep his heart
In two different places (in two different places)

I know you feel it cause you stayed
There is much more to the story
But I'd be a fool to say I trust it and I´m always gonna love her
You know that you don't wanna hear
How I'm livin' on the edge, baby
So I just say ""Yeah, baby""
She ain't nothing,

That I ain't playin' games

To shine, when you were around
And I always thought that I'd 
Never find that one..
To make me feel Forever Young..

But If I had one wish, my life to share 
Would be with you and no one else 
If I had open arms..
Would you have a heart to spare? 
If ever you want me near..
I'll be there to run and say I'm there 
Givin' you someone that understands
And a love that will never end 
I can be all that you need and more..

See I think It's love, I've fallen in..
And I can't figure It out, the way 
It's amazing how you surround me,
By the touch of your hand, If I could..
Everything I'd write, and the blue skies
Form me In your eyes to see..

Your mama and my mama want some grand babies tonight
Want you to be with me a lifetime

I used to think it was hopeless and I should just give it up. 
But I couldn't stop until I found myself a good girl to be in love. 
I checked every state and city and looked all around the world. 
And I'm proud to say that my search ends here. 
Cause your one in a million to me and I can't let you go.

Seasons are truly meant to chance
However love can be the reason you fall
And when you find that spacial someone
You will be willing to give them a lifetime
I love you and I choose you
Follow me

Some only come in your life for a season, and stay a while, 
Giving you a reason to take temporary and think that it's forever.

Pain of finding fault, revolving back to pain
And we need to stop

Just like a revolver babe, but I'd rather resolve it babe
Just like a revolver babe, just like a revolver

I don't even care just how much you take
Bitten and it?s potent, you hate it and I know it

Step on up kid and place your bet
Round and round is the route we choose
Play that game man, we all gonna lose

To be with Daddy out in public without all the interruptions
When the lies and gossip's published I'm the topic of discussion
And I stay in trouble just to show these suckers I ain't lost it
And I'd do it all again that's the funny thing about it
I ain't playing, boy I'm 'bout it
Will I change, boy I doubt it
I done been a lot of things, I ain't never been a coward
See the paparazzi crowded all around me now
Same niggas who was dissing want a pound like I'm senile (fuck nigga)
Showered with support from my adoring fans
They hear T.I.'s arrested they're like here we go again

My life, your entertainment
You watch it while I live it (live it)
I walk they follow (ay)
I talk they holler (ay)
Just here for your amusement (my life)
My life, your entertainment (entertainment)
You watch it while I live it (live it) (whoa)
You waiting for me to lose it (whoa)
I guess I'm just here for your amusement (yeah)

You've seen it all before, guys know how the story goes
It's like 2Pac never died, sit back, enjoy the show
You see the shit that scares you senseless, I done lived through it
Knew the risks and the consequences and I still do it
And then I'm so fresh, them niggas mildew it
Not just a actor by profession, pimp, I live movies
That's why they whisper when they see me point and stare at me
Cause they just wanna live through me vicariously (vicariously)
Fashion weekend, Paris week, party like a rock star
Get blown by a top model till she catch lockjaw
Got the dough you get a year, stashed in my sock drawer
Showed you the troubles and the struggles of an outlaw
Top dog would not fall, I am not y'all (niggas)
Couple pages out the calendar and I'm out y'all
Kid listen, pay attention, you don't wanna be me
It's safer to watch it on T.V.

My life, your entertainment (entertainment)
You watch it while I live it (live it)
I walk they follow (ay)
I talk they holler (ay)
Just here for your amusement 
My life, your entertainment 
You watch it while I live it (live it) 
You waiting for me to lose it (lose it)
I guess I'm just here for your amusement (yeah)

See I don't think it would even matter (to me)
Working a nine to (five) would it be better
I mean be honest, would you care to gossip about me ('bout me)
Not likely
I guess that's just the way that it goes (the way that it goes)
('Cause I know) See I can be somewhere out keeping it cool
(And get told) Almost anything instead of the truth
Y'all know more than I do, it's breaking news to me too
Easy killer y'all know that ain't how I move (ooh)
He said and she said (what) I did what, with they (who)
No not me I said (not me) she gave me no head (ooh)
Won't get me again (hey) I pleaded the fifth (hey)
I know better than to ever talk during the film
Man them flashing lights can blind your eyesight
To when you can't see what's wrong from right
Well shorty 'til you walk a mile in my shoes
And understand this is who I am

Usher I completely concur
Life would be such a blur, obviously we prefer
Our privacy but instead we endure
Yes sir, don't expect nothing less of me
Cause this going probably be this way until the death of me
But for the hustle and the lady on my arm now
Plus all my kids and my mom's I'm a calm down
And yo, we doing just fine, and the time's just flying
Live one headline at a time
Ya dig

Hush


Everyday he wakes up in his million dollar home
His life is like a video, the only reality he knows
He jumps inside of his hundred thousand dollar car
Cruising up the boulevard
Driving pass people living hard
Complains about the gas prices but still supports the war
He complains about his 6-figure salary, tax to feed the poor
He doesn't understand the homeless, doesn't think its genocide
**That millions die from three lethal letters
He does shit to make it better
**And I'm thinking of you

[Chorus]
Everyone wants to touch the sky
Nobody wants to reach back
For the ones who are scared to fly
Everybody wants heaven
If you don't want to sacrifice
Don't say nothing, don't say nothing
Oooooo-Hush
Don't say nothing
Oooooo-Hush
Don't say nothing

[Verse 2]
She watches television full of fabricated show
Thinks the world is just a joke, but oh little does she know
That there is a real life drama happening right outside her door
'Cause She continues to ignore, but she's like the TV - the story repeats
She's searching through the channels
Skipping pass the news, she's more entertained by lies and gossip
'Cause it hurts to see the truth
She complains about the nation
Think it's a waste of time to vote
She says the one that has been corrupted forever
No one tries to make it better
**And I'm thinking who

[Chorus]
Everyone wants to touch the sky (Oh-ho)
Nobody wants to reach back
For the ones who are scared to fly (Scared to fly)
Everybody wants heaven (Heaven)
If you don't want to sacrifice (Oh)
Don't say nothing, don't say nothing
Oooooo-Hush
Don't say nothing (My hand to my brother)
Oooooo-Hush (Hand to my sister)
Don't say nothing
Oooooo-Hush
Don't say nothing
Oooooo-Hush
Don't say nothing

Usher,"It's your chance take her hand to the floor (when I walk to the floor)
Girl if you see something you like then let him know
'Cause you only got one chance, for your first dance
Yeah you never forget your first dance
So take advantage of the slow dance

When I close my eyes I see me and you at the prom,
We've both been waiting so long
For this day to come
Now that it's here lets make it special
I can't deny
There's so many thoughts in my mind
The DJ's playing my favorite song ain't no chaperon's this could be
The night of our dreams

Only if you give, give the first dance to me
Girl I promise I'll be gentle, I know we gotta do it slowly
If you give, give your first dance to me
I'm gonna cherish every moment,
It only happens once, once in a life time

I couldn't ask for more, we're rockin' back and forth
Under the disco ball, we're the only ones on the floor
(I can't deny), so many thoughts in my mind
The DJ's playing my favorite song, now we're all alone, here's the opportunity

Only if you give, give the first dance to me
Girl I promise I'll be gentle, I know we gotta do it slowly
If you give, give your first dance to me
I'm gonna cherish every moment,
It only happens once, once in a lifetime

Everybody says that we look cute together lets make this a night
The two us remember, no teachers around to see us dancin' close
I'm tellin' you our parents will never know
Before the lights go up and the music turns off
Now's the perfect time for me to taste your lip gloss,
Your glass slippers in my hand right here, we'll
Make it before the clock strikes nine

If you just give, give the first dance to me
Girl I promise I'll be gentle but we gotta do it slowly
If you give, give the first dance to me we'll cherish every moment,
It only happens once, once in a lifetime

Girl if you see something you like then let him know
'Cause you only got one chance for your first dance
Yeah you never forget your first dance

Usher,"I know I vowed to never do this again but
I guess this seems to be the only thing I'm good at

Got something that you need to know
Either really should I never roll
Cant hold it gotta let it go
Though that I knew you'll never know

Yea yea
Listen babe

Let me start by saying that
The way I feel for you is never once changed
And the games that we played, mistakes I made
Leave me sorrier than you'll ever know

We got in problem babe I cant lie
Cause lately I realize that I
Never knew that we was on the same (playing field)
Knew that there was wrong but we (let it be)
And I know you never knew when you say I do
That you would have to face all the (pain you feel)

And its killin' me girl
That you have to live with this
Live with the lies I tell
Live with the pain you feel
Knowing the man you love is fooling around

Oh baby said its killin' me girl
Said I just don't understand
Why you wanna be with this kind of man oh ho
Why would you love a fool with all the things I do
I know its hard for you
Hard for you to live with him

Trail memories from moments
Treat love to be lonely
Guess that's just the man in me
Blaming onto liberty
When the nights off feel like the right time
And its spotlight feel like the white light
But its really just my fears
And still don't dry your tears,
When I say she ain't true when I really love you more
When you say if its true
What you do it for and I
I really don't know there's no excuse
I break your heart make you cry
I just wanna say goodbye

Its killin' me girl that you have to live with these
Live with the lies I tell
Live with the pain you feel
Knowing the man you love is fooling around
Oh baby said its killin' me girl
Said I just don't understand
Why you wanna be with this kind of man oh ho
Why would you love a fool with all the things I do
I know its hard for you
Hard for you to live with him

What a feel I don't even gotta right it
Its like poisons in my body
And there's no way to deny
That my heart is a time bomb
With seconds left to explode
But I gotta let you know before it blows

That it ain't on you
Its my fault
All the gossip n' talkin'
Behind your back when you walkin'
By the time you will know
Before long you'll see, that you deserve more
You deserve more
You deserve so much more
Than what I'll ever be

And its killin' me girl that you have to live with these
Live with the lies I tell
Live with the pain you feel
Knowing the man you love is fooling around ('round)
Oh baby said its killin' me girl
Said I just don't understand
Why you wanna be with this kind of man oh ho
Why would you love a fool with all the things I do
I know its hard for you
Hard for you to live with him
Live with him
Can you live with him

I didn't know that it was killin' her slow
And, and, your honor she can't say I ain't love her
Can't say I ain't tried
But I guess my love wasn't good enough

I guess I'm guilty for wantin' to be up in the club

Right hand to the sky
Strike me down if I lie
If she saying she the victim in this case then
What am I?
If I hurt her I ain't try to,
In the club I may decide to
Ride through
She got proof
Well I got alibi's to
Couple million dollar worth of bags and full of shoes
Seven carrot solitaire, Caribbean water blue
Range Rover, Porsche Panamera and the Bentley coupe
All the shit I did for her and this who you gon' listen to
Her life I submit to you is evidence
I never been on bullshit
She ain't caught me on no Tiger Woods shit
Knew what I expected when she met me
Should have left me then
Balling against the law shorty go on arrest me then

Caught in a love affair with feminine narcotic style
So fine, you got good taste
But I hate to see your pretty body go to waste
Before I see you in the bare necessities

Get me aroused in that intimate attire

Lady in the street, in bed hos and me
Wearin' Cosabella with nothin' but a trench coat

You can have a lot of fun

Wearing a teddy and a thong with the high-strung lace
Sew on that garter, if you wanna make me go harder, 
Do G strings and pumps
A sheer baby doll, put it on
Is it up to her

Girl, you're a goddess
So when you sip that ? on,
Stop, your sexy silhouette
On the wall turns me on, oh
Good god, your bod, and my bod
Keep deep, don't mope when I say
Nice but nasty, I wanna tell your man
I do what I say

She stole my head and let’s go play the dream again
Uh, uh, to find a girl like you
(Only you and me around)
I look into your eyes
I might see a universe, you and I are intertwined
I look into your eyes
I might see a universe,
Love is pure, so divine

Oh, oh, oh
Say the words that you know I won’t hear
Put your heart up close to my ear
We don't need to know the time
We could stay till the days turns to night

Say the words that you know I won’t hear

Spinning what's left of it on the floor
Have another round and just enjoy this party

Got it feeling different in here, yeah
She took my breath away
On to some fancy ship
Into another place
Such an expensive trip
But she didn’t make me pay for it with my money

What happened to you yeah
From the beginning I knew what I was getting
But I was with it, and I'll admit that
She was clear it was a kinda thing
It wouldn't be easy for me to let it go
For my time I got money, but money don't buy time
I got a head, some got left behind
The world is yours, just sign this dotted line

And in no time, I hear, money, clothes, fancy cars
Big old cribs, platinum on the wall, seven Grammys
Sold out concerts, damn I've been working hard
Private jets to France, many women
I didn't have a ball
You can say I've made it
But I've faded 'cause I miss you
Can we go back
But the issue is time we can't get back
What happened to you, yeah, come back
'Cause I miss you, can we go back
What happened to you

Did what I wanted, freaked all the honeys
I stayed only mine, mind was on the money
Had whatever, whenever, heart throb forever
Black, young, and clever

When you give it up, you get it on
Love would be the only reason to look back
And once you turn it on, you can't turn it off
But picture me complaining with all this

Usher,"If you live for somethin'
You're not alone my friend
So fill up your cup and lift your lighter
A toast to life

They say what don't kill me can make me stronger
So two drinks a night should help me live longer
I blow some smoke to give my lungs a test
'Cause why tip-toe through life to arrive safely at death
I'm on a journey yeah I'm on a roll
Sometimes I gotta close my eyes just to open my soul
And tonight is the night I gotta feeling I'm about to act a fool
So if you go fix some drinks me and Usher 'bout to break some rules

That's somewhere to go, but the world is moving slow
I was born for the fast life
I go for broke, a lesson I can't afford
But for what it's worth I'm ready to pay
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life

Na na hey, oh
Na na hey, oh
Na na hey, oh
Na na hey, for the rest of my life

If I got one life to live, I'mma party 'til I'm dead
What the hell is a life worth living if it's not on the edge
Trying to keep my balance, I'm twisted so just in case I fall
Written on my tombstone should say ""Women, Weed, and Alcohol""

That's somewhere to go, but the world is moving slow
I was born for the fast life
I go for broke, a lesson I can't afford

You're not alone my friend

I'm stuck in this moment, freeze the hands of time
'Cause I feel inner peace when I'm out of my mind

They don’t know how to play it cool you know
Mean it’s a time and place for everything
Been thinking bout you all day
Right now, is about that time
Look how you turn me on baby (They like when you talk to em)
(If you saying something)
Seeing is believing (Ursher baby) turn the lights on

She kissing on me, biting on my bottom lip (Huh)
In the gallery all I get is buy me this
Conversations on the phone until the break of dawn
Combination to her home, I gotta make her moan
Mean hustle got me chasing all this fast money
Balenciaga sneakers, now she touching cash money
So sexy in them all black Giuseppe heels
50 stacks in her bag so she know it’s real
Top off the Ferrari now we thugged out
Smoking on that Cali' bumping 2Pac
It’s me against the world now what’s your phone number?
Jumping in that range rover and I’m coming over

(Fuck’n you) Been thinking 'bout you all day
Still can’t get my mind off your body
I’m day dreaming bout (Fuck’n you)
Look how you turn me on baby
'Cause nobody compares to your body
Every time you let me touch (Fuck’n you)
And every time you let me
Nobody compares to your body, yeah

I think I wanna put a ring on it
I think I wanna tat her name on me (tat tat tatted up)
I had a lot of sexy women, but this is not the same for me
Bounce, love it how she always make it bounce!
Rose petals on her bed, I walk in unannounced
I love it when she speak a different language
I touch her in so many different angles
Born stunna and my baby so stunnin'
Niggas want her, but she find them so funny
I’m getting money, living like the most wanted
She all I ever needed, now Usher sing it

(Fuck’n you) Been thinking 'bout you all day

Day dreaming bout (Fuck’n you)
Look how you turn me on baby
Nobody compares to your body
Every time you let me touch (Fuck’n you)
Let me and every time you let me
Nobody compares to your body, touch

Pink champagne for my dime piece
In the sheets you know I flip her like a 9 piece
In the streets you know I’m eating like a lion feast
Lick a nipple tryna tickle all the finer things
Keys to the crib, keep it trill, time to handle biz'
Big dreamer, new beamer, just the realest nigga
Cover of the source, owner of the Porsche
Killing all haters, showing no remorse
Knocking at the door, she recognize the voice
I’m not them other boys, she know I shine the most
She modeling a lot I know she on the go
Another bottle of Ciroc, baby let’s have a toast

(Fuck’n you) Been thinking 'bout you all day
Still can’t get my mind off your body

Usher,"If we look to the stars, you'll find that you're not far from them
And if you follow your heart, you'll find that you'll be one of them
And not long, and not long, and not long, and not long, and not long

Long days half sober nights
Unsigned, performing at every open mic
God is all I needed to believe in me
Haters I tuned them out they were on another frequency
My momma never winded my decision
And all the bright lights never blinded out my vision
Music was my passion and my first crush
I'm just tryna ride the waves baby surfs up
When I'm down music gets me worked up
Plus at all my shows, gets women to pull they shirts up
What can I say I'm turnt up
I'm on fire these other rappers is burnt up

If we look to the stars, you'll find that you're not far from them
And if you follow your heart, you'll find that you'll be one of them
And not long, and not long, and not long, and not long, and not long

Yeah what an imagination
I'm a dreamer losing my concentration
Head in the clouds to trace my observations
Just connect the dots to all of the constellations
Looking for signs that's astrological
And I don't dream big, my dreams are astronomical
So when critics write articles of my chronicles
I wonder if my hunger is felt in they abdominal
Hiding from life's daily distraction
Where thoughts become things from the power of attraction
And I'm attracted to money and beautiful women
Ha and toasting to new beginnings, yeah

If we look to the stars, you'll find that you're not far from them
And if you follow your heart, you'll find that you'll be one of them
And not long, and not long, and not long, and not long, and not long

Look it's not long 'til the fights over
But turbulence is non stop till the flights over
So when passengers panic just stay silent
And realize its never too late to become the pilot
I fly higher take control of my destiny
The first step I needed me to invest in me
It's still a every day struggle for wealth
But rather struggle working for me than working for someone else
And I'm steady tryna ease the stress
So I open up all the doors with the key to success
If it hasn't been done then I'mma do it first
'Cause I'm the master of the Ludaverse

If we look to the stars, you'll find that you're not far from them
And if you follow your heart, you'll find that you'll be one of them
And not long, and not long, and not long, and not long, and not lon",Not Long,2015

Baby, I've been making plans, oh love
Baby, I've been making plans for you
Baby, I've been making plans
Baby, I've been making plans for you

(My sincerest apologies, I mean it)

I'll admit it, all be it pathetic
That I'm in my late 20s still never been to a wedding
Guess the idea of that lobby empty, do not sit with me well
It’s not your fault they try get me, cause I'ma need the sales
Cause I'm selfish, and I need you to myself
Tryna see you afloat but don't wanna see you on sale
Cause I failed and see you bout to cry
Cause when I enter they city they leave without they pride
I'm sorry, and you starin' at my comments
Fearin' it's gone always be you sharin' me with all them
Wrong, how dare I say ignore them
Preparing for that day, I leave you here and switch you for them
It's hard, you know temptation and all
Bitches out here tryna see if my relationship's strong
Get a place in the charts or runaway from your heart
Gave this music my all, nothing is sacred no more I'm wrong

But I'm promisin' you better though
And your friends sayin' let him go
And we ain't gettin' any younger
I can give up now but I can promise you forever though

I’ll admit it, let me be hypothetic
The day I find a woman I prolly be scared to share it
The idea of me finding love would run somebody off
And true my wall could use some plaques but still I gotta floss
Brush you off, see I'm kinda lost
Now I'm up in the club with a couple of Move Ons
And dark, good nigga troubled heart
Went from fallin' in love to drunk and fallin' apart
This is hard, tryna find some time to move on
Cause when we lost our baby, I got shady shit got too dark
Soft, and I thank you baby, you strong
My ex before you married to, you solo I say so long
Nah, good terms how that ended
But it surely put a dent on how I worry about this business
Off white picket fences, on flights with the children
On site stealin' kisses on off nights my intentions but

But I plan to do it better though
But you still sayin' let it go
We ain't gettin' any younger
Women love me now but in your eyes we forever though

If there's a question of my heart, you've got it
It don't belong to anyone but you
If there's a question of my love, you've got it

Usher,"Fresh from a bible belt town
That's what she's givin' up
Not really livin', just flesh comin' off a Greyhound
That's what he think of her
Right at a blink of an eye he provides her with charm
Hides that he is a shark
Suggests a few apartments, never hints to the home
That's what he wanna do
She just wanna new zip code for an old dream
Lost in an appetite now the big apple might
Find her habit of a queen
Feel the negro that's filled with an equal match road
Destination unknown
She's Little Bow Peep
And her and her whole sheep gonna have their wool unsewn
Now the wolf give a push
Now watch her jump in with two feet
Blue heat don't know how to swim through the limbs
Everyone huggin' her, tuggin' her
Ride on the merry-go-round of four drinks and two white lines
Go fast with the fast life so she needs more
One fun fix, now a daily chore
Provide the score, written and produced so perverse
He's a pro well versed
Told her that the purse that she want
With the shoes that she love and the rent that she need paid
She can earn with speed in a day
Escort on the high class side
Champagne glass rides
White snow waterfalls, oh how time flies
When you're flyin', crash and burn
She learned that her soul was dyin'
That's worth savin'
She's cravin' that bible belt town
So she crawls back on the Greyhound

Fresh new Gucci belt, bound
Fast to the city scape
Dash to deliver fate
Stashed in this duffel bag, proud
He's no scaredy cat
Life always spared in thy name
That the gamblers fold
No chips if the scramble got cold
But them warm cushions and them soft bus seats
Push that second thought along
Beneath the roof of a Super 8, he sleeps 'til it's night time
Then connects in the streets like a pipe line
In dark shades he supplies dark brigades
Of lost souls with his chemical morsels
He's no lab tech
He was born into a legacy stretched from Aztecs and beyond
Assets he was drawn to
Had him spinnin' the wool over his mother's eye
He's the black sheep
His pops career driven, he's the backseat
The man on the wheel that cruises on sunrise
That the man bought eyes to his pay per view
The kind of paper make a fool shoot a staple through
And take the label too
Until he's campaign
Unitl a pancake pocket change the landscape
Take a short visit home in the town
It's time to re-up, it's back on the Greyhound

Holding pieces of dying ember

Aren't we all hiding pieces of broken anger
I'm just trying to remember who I can call

I don't cry, I wonder if you're alright
Late at night, I think about you sometimes
Wonder why I wonder if you're alright
Thinking of the love we made
Ran around, out of town, now you're back again
Confusing true love and pain
Threw it down, now I'm back on my feet again

Are you asleep
Or are you still afraid of the dark
Hugs and Kisses, pictures and romances
Things that I wish I could do without

How many nights did I wander in the dark
Counting secrets of my heart
Now and then I wonder 'bout
Who's eating, sleeping with you now
How many times did I kiss you in the dark
Watching memories depart
Then again I wonder 'bout
But I don't give a damn about you

Take a bite; the pleasure is all mine
Keep in mind I'll think about you sometimes
I'm alright; I'll think about you and I'll
Turn this plight into a singer's delight
Living in a house of pain
Ran away, and I'm glad that I ran away
Rather be out in the rain
Now I understand why my mother ran away

No use asking
When did I start acting like such a jerk (you too)
Washing dishes, birthday wishes, watching baseball matches
The other future that I wonder 'bout
So many things I wish I didn't wonder 'bout

How many nights did I wander in the dark
Counting secrets of my heart
Now and then I wonder 'bout
Who's eating, sleeping with you now
How many times did I kiss you in the dark
Watching memories depart
Now and then I wonder but I betcha
I betcha don't give a damn about

How many nights did I wander in the dark
Counting secrets of my heart

Wabash Cannonball

I was headed for Tolono on the Wabash Cannonball
Norfolk and Western all the way
St. Louis down the line, Detroit somewhere behind
I thought I heard that old conductor say

No round trip ticket, you're on the final run
This Cannonball is never comin' back
Tomorrow she'll just be another memory
And an echo down a rusty railroad track

I got off at Tolono, just below Champagne
A flagstop on the edge of yesterday
The whistle blew a song, I whispered ""So long""
Waved my hand and slowly walked away

No round trip ticket, you're on the final run
This Cannonball is never comin' back
Tomorrow she'll just be another memory
And an echo down a rusty railroad track

I think about tomorrow, wonder why it is
We give up all the things we love the most
Goodbye, you old hog. I'll have to ride the Dog
Till they build a subway coast to coast

But no round trip ticket, you're on the final run
This Cannonball is never comin' back
Tomorrow she'll just be another memory
And an echo down a rusty railroad track


",Wabash Cannonball/Tolono,1973
Utah Phillips,"I look at my brown suitcase
And think of all the places that I've been,
Railroad yards and prison guards,
All the dumpy little towns along the stem
And the whispering of the people
As they watch every move that I go through;
I remember all those things,
Mostly I remember loving you.

cho: I remember loving you,
Back when the world was new,
And I think you loved me too,
I remember loving you,

The buckskin smells so the people tell
As we huddled in the boxcar from the rain;
Flashing lights that cut the night,
The railroad bull that pulled us off the train,
When the winter's cold and the Norther blows
I'm huddled in the corner 'til I'm blue;
I remember all these things,
Mostly I remember loving you.

Winter streets where the frozen sleet
Comes soaking through the cardboard in my shoes,
Where the promised land might be a place
Where a man could find free cigarettes and booze,
And the alleyways full of ragged strays,
The doorway wine I tell my troubles to,
I remember all these things,
Mostly I remember loving you.

",I Remember Loving You,1987
Utah Phillips,"I went down to the railroad yard, watch that train come by, 
Knew the train would roll that day, but I did not know what time. 

I did not know what time, boys, did not know what time. 
Knew the train would roll that day but I did not know what time. 

Good morning Mister Railroad Man, what time does your train roll by? 
Nine-sixteen and two-forty-four, twenty-five minutes 'til five. 

At nine-sixteen, two-forty-four, twenty-five minutes 'til five. 
Thank you Mister Railroad Man, I want to watch your train roll by. 

Standing on the platform, smoking a big cigar, 
Waitin' for some old freight train that carries an empty car. 

I rode her down to Danville Town, got stuck on a Danville girl, 
Bet your life she was a pearl, she wore that Danville curl. 

She wore her hat on the back of her head like high-tone people all do, 
Very next train come down that track, I bid that girl adieu. 

I bid that girl adieu, poor boys, I bid that girl adieu, 
The very next train come down that track, I bid that girl adieu.

Utah Phillips,"Too old to wrangle or ride on the swing,
You beat the triangle and you curse everything.
If dirt was a kingdom, they you'd be the king.

On the Goodnight Trail, on the Loving Trail,
Our Old Woman's lonesome tonight.
Your French harp blows like the low bawling calf.
It's a wonder the wind don't tear off your skin.
Get in there and blow out the light.

With your snake oil and herbs and your liniments, too,
You can do anything that a doctor can do,
Except find a cure for your own god damned stew

The campfire's gone out and the coffee's all gone,
The boys are all up and they're raising the dawn.
You're still sitting there, lost in a song.

I know that some day I'll be just the same,
Wearing an apron instead of a name.

Easy to look like an old torn out page,
Faded and cracked with the colors of age.

through a small western town

to the preacher's back door
where he knew there was refuge and room for the poor
he knocked and  then waitind for the precher to come
with just a kind word for a broken down  bum
the preacher arrived
and looked out in dismay
with a few angry words he drove him away
ofyou won't offer me something to eat
may i sit here a moment and rest my poor feet

i'm weary and sore
and stay up in heaven is there room for the poor

Of the wild, windy places locked in timeless snow,
And the wide, crimson deserts where the muddy rivers flow.
It's sad, but the telling takes me home.

Come along with me to some places that I've been
Where people all look back and they still remember when,
And the quicksilver legends, like sunlight, turn and bend
It's sad, but the telling takes me home.

Walk along some wagon road, down the iron rail,
Past the rusty Cadillacs that mark the boom town trail,
Where dreamers never win and doers never fail,
It's sad, but the telling takes me home.

I'll sing of my amigos, come from down below,
Whisper in their loving tongue the songs of Mexico.
They work their stolen Eden, lost so long ago.
It's sad, but the telling takes me home.

I'll tell you all some lies, just made up for fun,
And the loudest, meanest brag, it can beat the fastest gun.
I'll show you all some graves that tell where the West was won.
It's sad, but the telling takes me home.

And I'll sing about an emptiness the East has never known,
Where coyotes don't pay taxes and a man can live alone,
And you've got to walk forever just to find a telephone.
It's sad, but the telling takes me home.

Let me sing to you all those songs I know
Of the wild, windy places locked in timeless snow,

Check it
I first studied my kung fu in the Brakalak
In the center of ( ? )
This had to be about ten years back
Before I ever even heard of a 24 track
Talkin about you was an MC was not the move
Cause if you said you had skill, well then you had to show and prove
And if there ever was a party, son yo, I would set it
And tell the DJ run the beat from (Ultra-magnetic)
I grab the mic and then I leave the party buzzin
Tellin all the honeys I was Slick Rick's cousin
When they knew I wasn't, but I had no shame
Pa, you know the name, the Mos always had game
Back in the day of the Rap Attack
When brothers knew how to act, before glocks and crack
And Vandy see was doin radio shows
And 'crossover' meant that you wore your mom's clothes
When Sweet G was talkin about the games that people play
I used to sit back and say: yeah indeed, someday
And as I grew older my kung fu grew better
Instead of shootin the humbles I was shootin ( ? )
And now my time has come
And now hip-hop's an industry polluted by bums
Posin with guns, they're puffin mad blunts
Aiyo, brothers just started rhymin last month
They gettin fat deals on any major label
When they only seen other people hold the mic cable
Five years ago when we was dancin house
When the DJ played hip-hop, then you walked out
But now you're hard, talkin about you paid mad dues
I used to see your ass abused wearin platform shoes
I ain't confused, who you think you're foolin with that get-up?
You ain't genuine, so don't waste your time
Riffin over here cause there ain't no chance 
That you could break the sound, son, you ain't that advanced
Times are gettin critical across the land
Don't provide the be	-boy, introduce the be	-man - understand?

At the age of 18 made a little money
And I needed some advice on how to live my life
Was goin through strife, people couldn't understand
That I was comin into my own, becomin a man
I had to have a plan cause I know what I'm here for
So I can't waste time, y'all
Gotta be on the ball and represent for my peeps
(Where?) In the streets!
I make beats and kick facts over fat tracks
It's all of that from the Brakalak
Goin through problems as a adolescent
A lot of troubles and turmoils, there was persistence
And I know that I stutter
But it don't matter cause I'm a bad -
I flip a verse either backwards, sideways

Bump it in the Benzi and get your head together
Strollin down the F.D.R.
Playin the microphone star
Deep in your car
With the thump-diddy-thump-da-thump-da-thump-thump
Pop up the trunk and let the bass bump
If you ain't got a ride, well, that's alright
Let the you keep you company on your hike
Trekin down the ave with your headphones on
Take em off for a sec, you still feel gone
You're pressin rewind, many, many times
I must rock the mic cause it's only right
Comin right up off of Eastern ground
This is how you get down, I hope you like the sound

Ever since I was small I played the wall
The loner type, even as a little tike
While the other little kids were out at play
I was home wishing for a rainy day
I didn't have friends cause I barely even spoke
My head was mad out on a ( ? ) float
Surrounded all sides by thieves and crooks
I found a little peace in stars and books
My outside contact was limited
Cause I was different and heads couldn't get with it
I used to get mistaken for the stove
But all I really ever wanted was some love
Remember many ( ? ) many tears
That I kept inside for so many years
All the galactic intuition
I learned the skill of bein self-sufficient
Heads got live while I took the jay
I watched the sky and let the daytime fade
Go through a whole 24 hours of sorrow
Lay down and do the shit all again tomorrow
Keepin composure is a way ( ? )
I'm smilin in your face, all my chest is hurtin
I want to be nice but that shit ain't workin
Turn off the light and draw the curtain
Will I find peace, son, I'm not certain
In dark, quiet places feelings go
Beatin you down all hard and slow
Oh-oh-oh-oh... oh

The night brings courage and solutions
Images and dramatic conclusions
I play back a hundred thousand scenes
Cut the proper sneer and practice bein mean
I've taken too many a loss
Man, fuck patience, it's time to excercise force
It's the last thing heads would expect
If they won't give it to me, I'm takin my respect
And I'm usin all means at hand
Cause apparently muthafuckas don't understand
They don't know the fury behind the meekness
Mistakin my kindness for weakness
Well peep this: It's a bright new day
And we gon' do it this way
Call me MD with revenge prognosis
I'm handin out justice in powerful doses
Comin out the deck with aces and jokers
Flushing whoever comes closest
Strictly hands over ears when you try to make amends
I got my pad and pen, so who the hell needs friends?
You think I'm on some shit? You're goddamn right
My area of peace is like mad airtight
Attempt to trespass my radius, and we gon' have to fight
My heart is too heavy for you to take me light

Layin' on the couch chewin', no, not chewin', poppin'
So, I said to him, I said

Then I found out, single, my ass
Not only was he married, well, he had six wives
One of those Mormons, you know

So that night, when he came home
I fixed him his drink as usual
You know, some guys just can't hold their arsenic

He had it coming, he had it coming
He took a flower in its prime
And then he used it and he abused it
It was a murder but not a crime

Ute Lemper,"My sister and I had an act that couldn't flop
My sister and I were headed straight fo the top
My sister and I earned a thou a week at least
Oh, sure!
But my sister is now, unfortunately, deceased

Oh, I know it's sad, of course
But a fact is still a fact
And now all that remains
Is the remains
Of a perfect double act!

Roxie, do you know you are exactly the same
Size as my sister? oh, you would fit in her wardrobe
Perfectly. look, why don't I just show you some of
The act, huh? watch this.

Now you have to imagine
This with two people.
It's swell with two people.

First I'd (Drums!)
Then she'd (Saxophone!)
Then we'd (Together!)
But I can't do it alone!
Then she'd
Then I'd
Then we
But I can't do it alone!

She'd say,""what's your sister like? ""
I'd say, ""men,""
Yuk, yuk, yuk
She'd say, ""you're the cat's meow""
Then we'd wow the crowd again
When she'd go
I'd go
We'd go

And then those ding-dong daddies started to roar
Whistled, stomped and stamped on the floor
Yelling, sreaming, begging for more.

And we'd say, ""o.k. fellas, keep your socks up.
You ain't seen nothin' yet!""

But I simply cannot do it alone!

Well? what did ya' think? come on, you can say.

O.k., o.k. the first part can always be rewritten.
But the second part was really nifty. watch this.

Then she'd (See, get it, right?)
Then I'd (Then I'd kick really high)
Then we'd,
But I can't do it alone!
She'd say, ""what state's chicago in?""
I'd say, ""ill!""
Did ya' get that?
She'd say, ""turn your motor off""
I can hear 'em cheerin' still
When she'd go,
I'd go,
We'd go (Sideways!)
And then those two-bit johnnies did it up brown
To cheer the best attraction in town
They nearly tore the balcony down

And we'd say. ""o.k. fellas, o.k.,
We're goin' home, but here's a few more partin' shots!""
And this, this we did in perfect unison.

Now, you've seen me goin' through it
It may seem there's nothin' to it
But I simply cannot do it
Alone!

All alone and shaking with fright
With her brand new hubby nowhere in sight

But they were scratchin' my back
'Cause I was scratchin' theirs

And trusting too
That's only for fools

When I make the rules
And rule number one
From here to the end
Is I am my own best friend

I am my own best friend

Who never said die
Are standing here this minute

The weapon was a phone call in the dead of night
You know I never really thought you had it in you

The suspect was a cruel self-motivated man
He held the victim's heart in the palm of his hand
The motive is a mystery I'll never understand
The final cut went deep down to the very sinew
The case continues

Why did the blood-stained sheets that burned turn quite so cold
My only crime was passion wild and uncontrolled
If sex were an Olympic sport we'd' have won the gold
Oh tell me that there's still a little love left in you

Ute Lemper,"There was a time when men were kind 
When their voices were soft 
And their words inviting 
There was a time when love was blind
And the world was a song
And the song was exciting
There was a time
Then it all went wrong

I dreamed a dream in time gone by
When hope was high
And life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving
Then I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used and wasted
There was no ransom to be paid
No song unsung
No wine untasted

But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hopes apart
As they turn your dreams to shame

He slept a summer by my side
He filled my days with endless wonder
He took my childhood in his stride
But he was gone when autumn came

And I still dream he'll come to me
That we will live the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be
And there are storms we cannot weather!

So different from this hell I'm living
So different now, from what it seemed
Now life has killed the dream I dreamed",I Dreamed a Dream [From Les Misarables],2001
Ute Lemper,"In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who sings
Of the dreams that he brings from the wide open sea
In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who sleeps
While the river-bank weeps to the old willow tree

In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who dies
Full of beer, full of cries, in a drunken down fight
But in the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who's born
On a muggy hot morn, by the dawn's early light

In the port of Amsterdam, where the sailors all meet
There's a sailor who eats only fish-heads and -tails
And he'll show you his teeth that have rotted too soon
That can drink down the moon, that can haul up the sails

And he turns to the cook, with his arms open wide
""Bring me more fish, put it down by my side""
And he wants so to belch, but he's too full to try
So he gets up and he laughs, and he zips up his fly

In the port of Amsterdam, you can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants, grinding women to paunch
They've forgotten the tune that their whiskey-voice croaks
Splitting the night with the roar of their jokes

And they turn and they dance and they laugh and they lust
Til the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
And it's into the night with their pride in their pants
And the slut that they tow underneath the streetlamps

In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who drinks
And he drinks, and he drinks, and he drinks once again
He drinks to the health of the whores of Amsterdam
Who have promised their love to a thousand other men

They have bargained their bodies, their virtues all gone
For a few dirty coins, and when he can't go on
He puts his nose in the air, and he wipes it up above
And he pisses like I cry for an unfaithful love

Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low (One Touch of Venus),2002

I'll need a volunteer
How about you with the eyes
Come on down to the front and sit right here and don't be shy
So come one, come all and see the show tonight
Prepare to be astounded, no ghosts or poltergeists
You know I'm no Pinocchio I never told lie
They called me mister magic man
I'm floating cloud nine

I've got the magic in me
(I've got the magic baby)
Every time I touch that track it turns into gold
(turns to gold)
Now everybody knows I've got the magic
Magic magic magic
(So clap your hands, come on)
Magic magic magic
(So clap your hands, come on)
Magic magic magic
(everybody clap your hands, come on. so clap your hands, come on)
(everybody clap your hands)
I've got the magic in me","Trebles Finals: Bright Lights, Bigger City/Magic",2012
