Rosenstolz,"Ich bin verändert

Ich bin verändert
Irgendwie
Hab ich aufgehört
Nach dir zu suchen
Ich schreck nicht mehr hoch
Mitten in der Nacht
Ich wache nicht mehr auf
Denk du stehst vor mir

Ich lauf, ich laufe weiter
Halt ich an bleib ich nur stehen
Und ich muss an dir vorüber gehen
Ich muss an dir vorüber gehen

Und ich bin anders
Irgendwie
Hat damit angefangen
Dass ich für mich nur denk
Ich mach das nicht bewusst
Doch es ging nicht mehr
Ob es besser ist
Weiß ich hinterher

Ich lauf, ich laufe weiter
Halt ich an bleib ich nur stehen
Und ich muss an dir vorüber gehen
Ich muss an dir vorüber gehen

Ich hab aufgehört
Mir deine Stimme zu denken
Deine Augen aus dem Sinn
Doch ich weiß noch wie sie waren
Ich hab aufgehört
Mir deine Liebe zu denken
Ich hab aufgehört
Mir meine Liebe zu schenken

Ich bin verändert
Irgendwie
Ich bin verändert
Irgendwie

Ich schreck nicht mehr hoch
Mitten in der Nacht
Ich wach nicht mehr auf
Denk du stehst vor mir

Ich lauf, ich laufe weiter
Halt ich an bleib ich nur stehen
Und ich muss an dir vorüber gehen
Ich muss an dir vorüber gehen",Ich Bin Verändert,2006
Rosenstolz,"Manchmal sind die Dinge gar nicht so
Wie man sich's vorgestellt hat
Sondern besser
Manchmal ist das Einzige was zählt
Dass ich nicht nachdenke
Sondern vergesse
Mach die lichter an

Ich geh in Flammen auf
Kann auf Wasser gehen
Ich schrei's hinaus
Ich geh in Flammen auf
Kann jetzt fliegen
Über's Meer hinaus

Halt dich fest ab mir
Weil der Wind sich jetzt dreht
Es wird ein stürmischer Tag
Unser Leben wird wahr
Ist der Frühling vorbei
Fängt der Sommer erst an
Unser Leben lang
Unser Leben lang

Wahrheit ist doch nur was für Idioten
Lass uns lügen
Nur einen Tag lang
Wenn ich mich fangen lass
Dann nur vom Leben
Wär ich Pilot würden wir
Niemals landen
Schalt die Motoren an

Ich geh in Flammen auf
Kann auf Wasser gehen

Rosenstolz,"Ich verstecke dich vor deinem schlimmsten Traum
Und wärme dich, wenn du an dir erfrierst
Ich küsse dich, wenn dich keiner küssen mag
Und liebe dich, wenn du dich wieder verlierst

Ich hab genauso Angst wie du
Meine Flügel sind aus Blei
Und bist du verrückt, bin ich's um so mehr
Vom Fliegen sind wir noch ganz schwer

Ich denke mir für dich einen Himmel aus
Und glaub für dich, wenn du selbst nicht glaubst
Ich denk für dich die Sonne neu
Und klau sie dir, wenn du Feuer brauchst

Ich hab genauso Angst wie du
Meine Flügel sind aus Blei
Und bist du verrückt, bin ich's um so mehr
Vom Fliegen sind wir noch ganz schwer

Ich hatte schon immer Schwierigkeiten mit dem Leben
Und hatte schon immer Schwierigkeiten das auch zuzugeben
Ich wollte schon immer schneller laufen, höher fliegen
Und wollte schon immer höher hinaus und bin doch drunter geblieben

Ich hab genauso Angst wie du
Meine Flügel sind aus Blei
Und bist du verrückt, bin ich's um so mehr
Vom Fliegen sind wir noch ganz schwer

Ich hab genauso Angst wie du",Ich Hab Genauso Angst Wie Du,2006
Rosenstolz,"Warum kann ich nach Hause gehen
Warum musste das passieren
Was ist das
Es tut mir leid

Warum hab ich mich so gut gefühlt So schön in deinem Arm
Was ist das
Es tut mir leid

Jetzt seh ich nur noch deinen blick
Wie langsam so´n Verstand doch ist

Du tust mir nicht gut
tust mir nur weh
Trittst in mein Herz bis es schreit
Du tust mir nicht gut
Machst mich kaputt
Doch nichts von alledem tut mir leid
Nichts von alledem tut mir leid

Komm lüg mich bitte nochmal an
Küss mich bis ich´s besser kann
Was ist das
Es tut mir leid

Komm sag schon was ich hören will
Daß deine Welt in meine will
Was ist das
Es tut mir leid

Jetzt seh ich nur noch deinen blick
Wie langsam so´n Verstand doch ist

Du tust mir nicht gut
Tust mir nur weh
Trittst in mein Herz bis ich schrei
Du tust mir nicht gut
Machst mich kaputt
Doch nichts von alledem tut mir leid
Nichts von alledem tut mir leid

Du tust mir nicht gut
Machst mich kaputt
Doch nichts von alledem tut mir leid
Doch nichts von alledem
Nichts von alledem tut mir leid

Es tut mir leid",Nichts von Alledem (Tut Mir Leid),2006
Rosenstolz,"Woran hält sich die Liebe 

Woran hält sich die Liebe 
Wenn da keiner mehr ist 
Woran soll ich nur glauben
Wenn sie mich nicht vermisst

Woran halten sich Träume
Wenn der Tag sie uns nimmt 
Warum musst du versprechen
Wenn das Ende nicht stimmt 

Woran hält sich denn Liebe
Vom Leben ganz matt 
Woran soll sie sich halten
Wenn sie dich nicht mehr hat 

Woran hält sich 'n Krieger
Der den Krieg nicht vergisst
Woran glauben Besiegte
Wenn sie keiner vermisst 

Woran hält sich die Liebe
Vom Lieben ganz taub
Woran soll ich mich halten
Wenn du an mich nicht mehr glaubst 

Woran soll ich mich halten
Wenn meine Welt schneller dreht 
Soviel Gedanken, zum Denken
Nur denken kann ich nicht mehr
Woran soll ich mich halten
Wenn meine Welt schneller dreht 
Soviel Gedanken, vom Denken 
Bin ich ganz schwer

Woran hält sich mein Leben
Wenn es ohne dich lebt 
Warum muss ich verstehen
Wenn es doch weitergeht 
Woran hält sich die Liebe
Vom Lieben ganz matt 
Woran soll sie sich halten
Wenn sie dich nicht mehr hat 
Woran hält sich die Liebe
Vom Lieben ganz taub 
Woran soll ich mich halten
Wenn du an mich nicht mehr glaubst",Woran Hält Sich Die Liebe,2006
Rosenstolz,"Krieg den Schlaf nicht aus den Augen
Selbst der Kaffee schmeckt nach Nacht
Hab wieder schlecht geschlafen
Irgendwas raubt mir die Kraft

Kommt 'n Zug, lieg ich auf den Gleisen
Irgendwie spring ich noch auf
Muss dringend mal verreisen
Muss dringend mal hier raus

Vielleicht liegt das Glück doch auf der Straße
Hat's da irgendwer gesucht?
Im tiefen Schmutz werd ich jetzt graben
Damit ich mich nicht so sehr verfluch'
Nein, du kannst mich jetzt nicht halten
Was ich such, gibt's hier nicht mehr
Nein, du kannst mich nicht behalten
Heute hält mich keiner mehr
Nein, du kannst mich nicht behalten

Wenn ich das Feuer seh', will ich da hin
Und wenn ich ins Wasser geh, bis ich verschwind'
Bis ich ein Teil vom Meer nur bin
Will ich dahin
Alles was ich hab, lass ich jetzt liegen
Alles was ich war, nehm' ich nicht mit
Was ich nich mehr brauch, sind meine Lügen
Nehm' sie nich mit

Vielleicht liegt das Glück doch auf der Straße
Hat's da irgendwer gesucht?
Im tiefen Schmutz werd ich jetzt graben

Ab und zu lieg ich auf den Gleisen
Irgendwie spring ich noch auf

Rosenstolz,"Die Nacht hat den Tag langsam umgebracht 
Und alte Katzen grau gemacht 
Ich kühle am Fenster mein Gesicht 
Wo bist du? Wo bist du? Warum kommst du nicht?

Die Straße schickt lockend ein Lachen herauf 
Ich will es nicht und werf's wieder raus 
In meinen Tränen schwimmt Kerzenlicht 
Wo bist du? Wo bist du? Warum kommst du nicht?

Eine Fliege ertrinkt in meinem Wein 
Es ist totenstill, ich hör sie Hilfe schrei'n 
Ich seh ihr zu und sehe mich 
Wo bist du? Wo bist du? Warum kommst du nicht?

Babe, Babe wenn du kommst 
Brennt in der Minibar noch Licht 
Da steht ein Bittermandel-Shake 
Den überlebst du nicht, den überlebst du nicht

Die Nacht hat den Tag langsam umgebracht 
Und alle Weiber so wunderschön gemacht 
Ich heule,ich heule und ich hasse dich

Rosenstolz,"Mein Zimmer mit verschloss'nen Fenstern
Die Türen abgesperrt
Du nahmst mich in Gefangenschaft
Hab es selbst gewühlt
Schwarze Fesseln schimmern matt
Auf verglühter Haut
Sperrst mich in dein Leben ein
Schreie sterben laut

Lebend erwacht, doch nichts erlebt

Kurz bevor die Nacht verschwand

In dem Moment als du gingst

Als gäb's niemals ein Ende
Warum kann ich nicht weinen?

Wollen es Stück für Stück studieren
Blättern vorwärts und zurück
Sind mal schüchtern, mal verrückt

Es gibt Sehnsucht und auch Gier
Wir halten fest, wir lassen los
Sind mal klein, dann wieder groß

That you must keep liaisonic
Are better bets

Rosetta Stone,"Love is a stranger
In an open car
To tempt you in
And drive you far away

And I want you
And I want you
And I want you so
Its an obsession

Love is a danger
Of a different kind
To take you away
And leave you far behind
And love love love
Is a dangerous drug
You have to receive it
And you still cant
Get enough of the stuff

Its savage and its cruel
And it shines like destruction
Comes in like the flood
And it seems like religion
Its noble and its brutal
It distorts and deranges
And it wrenches you up
And youre left like a zombie

And I want you
And I want you
And I want you so
Its an obsession

Its guilt edged
Glamorous and sleek by design
You know its jealous by nature
False and unkind
Its hard and restrained
And its totally cool
It touches and it teases
As you stumble in the debris

And I want you
And I want you
And I want you so
Its an obsession

My mind erased, 
And I let the moment slip away. 

Another night, got me sitting here 
All on my own . 
Picking up the phone, 
But I can't get passed the dial tone. 
Wracking my brain, going insane,

I can't keep going this way.

And your fingertips and the warmest touch 
That I've always missed. 
Crushed by the softest hands I never held. 
Probably never tell, 
You're the strongest love that I've ever felt. 
Crushed that I haven't  ever let you know, 
How it always goes, cause I lose my nerve 
Whenever you get close. 
And so I'm left,short-of-breath, with that heavy feeling in my chest. 
Baby I'm so crushed. 

So I told myself, that tomorrow's going to be the day. 
And I keep on telling myself that I'm going to find a way. 
And I won't be afraid just like yesterday, 
Won't walk away. 
Never gonna let another chance slip away. 
'Cause I gotta know, whichever way it's gonna go. 
Risk my heart and soul because there can never be no more.

I want to feel like I've never felt in this life
I want something I've never seen through these eyes

When you look at me, why not try to see yourself
I want something that won't force my ears to listen
Because even the truest love, is still gonna have something missing

I want something I can depend on
And watch it grow
And watch it grow

Set me free, I never want to feel fear again
Please Pardon me, as I never meant to hurt anyone
Let me be, stronger for everyone

Where I can write alone, words for my mother
And how I came through, kicking and screaming
Smack that little ass doctor, make sure baby feels it

Daddy wonders if she'll ever wake from her dream of
Big bright stars, and she wants to be the biggest one
Look at our baby there, up on the stage
Come back baby come, back home to me

If I could I'd tell you when I'm coming back again
I wish I could tell you, I was coming back again
If I could I'd tell you when I'm coming back again
I wish I could tell you I was coming
If I can ever come back again

Dirty child, cover your black eyes
We'll feed you water and fix you up inside
We'll hide you here and get you out of that dirty business
Those damn fools they nearly took our baby from us

Daddy wonders if she'll ever wake from her dreams of
Big bright stars, and she wants to be the biggest one
Look at our baby there, up on the stage
Come back baby come, back home to me

If I could tell you I was coming back again
I wish I could tell you I'm coming back again
If I could I'd tell you when I'm coming back again
I wish I could tell you I'm coming
If I can ever come back again

You can't make it go, you can't make it stop
And you can't put out a fire, if it's burning hot!

Daddy tell me, if I'll ever wake from this dream of
Big bright stars and I wanna to be the biggest
Take a look at your baby, ain't she pretty on the stage
Come back baby, come back home to me

I wish I could come back again
Mamma, poppa, you'll never know how bad
If I could tell you I'm coming back again
I would tell you I'm coming back
If I am ever coming back again

And don't look for me, cause I'll be gone....

Every effort without no gain

Rosie Flores,"Carlos Zaragoza left his home in Casas Grandes when the moon was full
No money in his pocket, just a locket of his sister framed in gold
He rode into El Sueco, stole a rooster called Gallo Del Cielo
Then he swam the Rio Grande with that fighter nestled
Deep beneath his arm.

El Gallo Del Cielo was a rooster born in heaven so the legends say
His wings they had been broken, he had one eye
Rollin' crazy in his head
And he'd fought a hundred fights, and the legends say
That one night near El Sueco
They'd fought Gallo seven times, and seven times he'd
Left brave roosters dead.

Hola, my Theresa, I am thinking of you now in San Antonio
I have 27 dollars and the good luck of your picture
Framed in gold
Tonight I'll put it all on the fighting spurs of Gallo Del Cielo
And then I'll return to buy the land Villa stole
From father long ago.

Outside of San Diego, in the onion fields of Paco Monteverde
The Pride of San Diego lay sleeping on a fancy bed of silk
And they laughed when Zaragoza pulled the one-eyed
Del Cielo from beneath his coat
But they cried when Zaragoza walked away with a
Thousand dollar bill.

Hola, my Theresa, I am thinking of you now in Santa Barbara
I have fifteen hundred dollars and the good luck of
Your picture framed in gold
Tonight I'll put it all on the fighting spurs of Gallo Del Cielo
And then I'll return to buy the land Villa stole
From father long ago.

Now the moon has gone to hiding and the lantern light
Spills shadows on a fighting sand
Where a wicked black named Zorro faces Gallo del Cielo in the night
But Carlos Zaragoza fears the tiny crack that runs across his rooster's beak
And he fears he has lost the fifty thousand dollars riding on the fight.

Hola, my Theresa, I am thinking of you now in Santa Clara
Yes, the money's on the table, I am holding to
Your good luck framed in gold
And everything we've dreamed of is riding on the spurs of Del Cielo
I pray that I'll return to buy the land Villa stole from father long ago.

Then the signal it was given, and the cocks rose
Together far above the sand
El Gallo del Cielo sunk a gaff into Zorro's shiny breast
They were separated quickly but they rose and fought
Each other thirty seven times
And the legends say that everyone agreed that del Cielo fought the best.

Then the screams of Zaragoza filled the night outside
The town of Santa Clara
As the beak of del Cielo lay broken like a shell within his hand
And they say that Zaragoza screamed a curse upon the
Bones of Pancho Villa
When Zorro rose up one last time and drove del
Cielo through the sand.

Hola, my Theresa, I am thinking of you now in
San Francisco
I have no money in my pocket, I no longer have
Your good luck framed in gold
I buried it last evening with the bones of my
Beloved Del Cielo
And I'll not return to buy the land Villa stole from
Father long ago.

Do the rivers still run muddy outside of my beloved
Casas Grandes?

Oes the scar upon my brother's face turn red when
He hears mention of my name?
Do the people of El Sueco curse the theft of Gallo del Cielo?
Well, tell my family not to worry, I will not return
To cause them shame.",El  Gallo del Cielo,1994

Rosie O'Donnell,"Until tonight
My heart was just half full
I'd never known the fruit which fed the soul
But now I see what may put to rest my longing

[Chorus]
For I have seen, the face of love
The grace of God, the face of love
   
In silence I feared my heart
Would remain words unheard
Inside a separate mess of skin
But now I know that the skin just veils the soul
   
[Chorus]
   
So take my hand and knowing
With it I also give my heart
Wanting to never be separate again
Let eternity begin
   
If you were flame
I'd allow myself to be consumed completely
Were you wind I'd wish you to pass through me
But now I know that the skin just veils the soul

Rosie O'Donnell,"In the middle of a forest 
There's a clearing by a stream 
Where a mother holds her newborn 
And the child begins to dream 

And he dreams of hopes unspoken 
When the tears of man will cease 
And his mother holds him closer 
For he is the Prince of peace 

And the moon is looking downward 
Casting shadows through the trees 
And the stars are shining brighter 
As they whisper what they see 

How the emperor and the pauper 
With the lion and the lamb 
Kneel down before the infant 
For his peace they understand 

Hark, the herald angels sing 
Glory to the newborn king 
Peace on earth and mercy mild 
God and sinners reconciled 
Glory all ye nations rise 
Join the triumph of the skies 

With the heavenly host proclaim 
Christ is born in Bethlehem 
Hark, the herald angels sing 
Glory to the newborn king 

Let the bells ring out these tidings 
Let it echo across the land 
That a king is born in Bethlehem 
And his kingdom is at hand 

Let the world rejoice together 
As it looks upon the stars 
Knowing every man's our brother 
And that every child is ours 

As he flew o'er Sarajevo 
There were scars upon the land 
There were scars upon the people 
It was hard to understand 

And the deepest scars of all 
Which to humans are unseen 
But the angel could see clearly 
Were the scars upon the dreams 

Like Belfast and Burundi 
Rwanda, Palestine 
The only decorations here 
Had been awarded for their crimes 

And in gardens where the children played 
Now soldiers only trod 
And stranger still, he heard some say 
That they were killing for their god 

Now the angel heard god speak many times 
And he had always paid attention 
But this killing of ones neighbor 
Was something the Lord had never mentioned 

But as he neared the earth 
Of a recent battleground 
From among the ruins 
He once more heard the sound 

It was a single cello playing 
A forgotten Christmas song 
And even on that battlefield 
The song somehow belonged 

And as he flew away 
The angel did take note 
That where he found this music played 
One always could find hope",The Prince of Peace,2000

it comes back when all the days turn into one.
I'm in a coat and hat,
and I'm standing on the coast of England.
With a castle and cathedral on the sand,
I reached down to touch the water with my hand.
Then you turn and say to me,
""You've been talking in your sleep,
What did you see? What does it mean?""

of our daytrip from the window of a train.
The one we cut in half.
I kept mine and made a bookmark on a page.
It fell out today as I was getting packed.

we kept our details underneath,
once made of stone, we went for broke.

Convince you to never want to go away
Hmm...

I'll leave you notes in the morning
And get you ready for your day
Kiss your lips before you leave me
Make you see my love for you will never change

Be closer to our families

We can take my station wagon
And fill it to the brim
And wave goodbye to all our lovely friends
Never to return again

You could write for picture shows
And I could get a job
Waiting tables at a restaurant
Where famous people like to go

We could buy old overcoats
And walk through the snow
All the way around Central Park

We could take the subway home
And stare at our reflections
In the window panes of the train
And see how much New York has changed us

We sat side by side and held hands for some time
We saluted the Statue of Liberty

I should just kick my heels together and go home
But I'm not sure where that is anymore

Oh, how I wish I could go back in time
To the night when I heard my mother cry
She held me in her arms and we talked for some time
And I sang a song her mother sang to her and it goes

Something about paper dolls and what men prefer
Something about the cross and how her Jesus died for her
Something about love and how the truth fighting for
I wonder does love like that exist anymore?

And I, I have much farther to go
And I, I'm so confused I know
I should just kick my heels together and go home

Roslyn Kind,"How do you keep
The music playing?
How do you make it last
How do keep
The song from fading
Too fast

How do you lose yourself
To someone
And never lose your way
How do you not run
Out of new things
To say

And since you know
We're always changing
How can it be the same
And tell me how
Year after year
You're sure your heart
Will fall apart
Each time
You hear her name

I know the way
I feel for you
Is now or never
The more
I love the more
There I'm afraid
That in yours eyes
I may not see forever

Ross Landon,"Lord Elderley, Lrd Borrowmere,
Lord Sickert and Lord Camp,
With every virtue, every grace,
Ah what avails the sceptred race,
Here you see-the four of us,
And there are so many more of us
Eldest sons that must succeed.
We know how Caesar conquered Gaul
And how to whack a cricket ball;
Apart from this, our education lacks co-ordination.
Though we're young and tentative
And rather rip-representative,
Scions of a noble breed,
We are the products of those homes serene and stately
Which only lately
Seem to have run to seed!
 
The Stately Homes of England,
How beautiful they stand,
To prove the upper classes
Have still the upper hand;
Though the fact that they have to be rebuilt
And frequently mortgaged to the hilt
Is inclined to take the gilt
Off the gingerbread,
And certainly damps the fun
Of the eldest son-
But still we won't be beaten,
We'll scrimp and scrape and save,
The playing fields of Eton
Have made us frightfully brave-
And though if the Van Dycks have to go
And we pawn the Bechstein Grand,
We'll stand
By the Stately Homes of England.
 
Here you see
The pick of us,
You may be heartily sick of us,
Still with sense
We're all imbued.
Our homes command extensive views
And with assistance from the Jews
We have been able to dispose of
Rows and rows and rows of
Gainsboroughs and Lawrences,
Some sporting prints of Aunt Florence's,
Some of which were rather rude.
Although we sometimes flaunt our family conventions,
Our good intentions
Mustn't be misconstrued.
 
The Stately Homes of England
We proudly represent,
We only keep them up for
Americans to rent,
Though the pipes that supply the bathroom burst
And the lavatory makes you fear the worst,
It was used by Charles the First
Quite informally,
And later by George the Fourth
On a journey north.
The State Apartments keep their
Historical renown,
It's wiser not to sleep there
In case they tumble down'
But still if they ever catch on fire
Which, with any luck, they might
We'll fight
For the Stately Homes  of England
 
The Stately Homes of England,
Though rather in the lurch,
Provide a lot of chances
For Psychical Research-
There's the ghost of a crazy younger son
Who murdered, in thirteen fifty-one,
An extremely rowdy Nun
Who resented it,
And people who come to call
Meet her in the hall.
The baby in the guest wing,
Who crouches by the grate,
Was walled up in the west wing
In fourteen twenty-eight.
If anyone spots
The Queen of Scots
In a hand-embroidered shroud
We're proud
Of the Stately Homes of England.
 
Lord Elderley, Lord Borrowmere,
Lord Sickert and Lord Camp,
Behold us in our hours of ease,
Uncertain, coy and hard to please.
Reading in Debrett of us,
This fine Patrician quartette of us,
We can feel extremely proud,
Our ancient lineage we trace
Back to the cradle of the Race
Before those beastly Roman bowmen
Bitched our local Yeomen.
Through the new democracy
May pain the old Aristocarcy
We've not winced nor cried aloud,
Under the bludgeonings of chance what will be- will be.
Our heads will still be
Bloody but quite unbowed!
 
The Stately Homes of England
In valley, dale and glen
Produce a race of charming,
Innocuous young men.
Though our mental equipment may be slight
And we barely distinguish left from right,
We are quite prepared to fight
For our principles,
Though none of us know so far
What they really are.
Our duty to the nation,
It's only fair to state,
Lies not I pro-creation
But what we pro-create;
And so we can cry
With kindling eye
As to married like we go,
What ho!
For the Stately Homes of England!
 
The Stately Homes of England,
Although a trifle bleak,
Historically speaking,
Are more or less unique.
We've a cousin who won the Golden Fleece
And a very peculiar fowling-piece
Which was sent to Cromwell's niece,
Who detested it,
And rapidly sent it back
With a dirty crack.
A note we have from Chaucer
Contains a bawdy joke.
We also have a saucer
That Bloody Mary broke.
We've two pairs of tights
King Arthur's Knights
Had completely worn away.
Sing Hey!
For the Stately Homes of England.
 
The Stately Homes of England,
Tho' rather on the blink
Provide a lot of reasons
For what we do and think.
Tho' we freely admit we may be wrong,
Our conviction that we are right is strong
Tho' it may not be for long,
We'll hold on to it
We might as well hold the bat
Till they knock us flat
Our dignity of race may
Retire into its shell
Our Minister of Grace may
Defend us none too well
But still if a child
Becomes too wild

Si colorerà

È un ponte di luce che
Un arco di luce che ipnotizza la città
È un tetto di musica
In cielo, una virgola che sorridere ci fa
Oro e argento
Oro e argento
Il sole nella pioggia
È un incontro che si accende nel cuore di ogni goccia
Sembra un gioco dentro noi
Acqua e fuoco, nero e bianco, sempre e mai
Come un gioco finirà
E resterà solo luce che
Come un arcobaleno, in noi, si colorerà

Oro e argento
Oro e argento
I colori di bambini
Nel silenzio di un istante disegnano i destini
Blu di notte, di marea
Una nave lascia indietro la sua scia
Rosa è l'alba che verrà

Come un arcobaleno in noi si colorerà",Arcobaleno,2004

Remember that with every piece of you
Hm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die

Hm, we keep this love in this photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone

And if you hurt me
That's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won’t ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh, you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul

And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won’t ever let you go

When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
""Wait for me to come home""",Maxwell's silver hammer,2016

I walked from noon until the night
I changed my crowd, I ditched my tie
I watched the sparks fly off the fire
I found your house, I didn't even try
They'd closed the shutters, they'd pulled the blinds
My eyes were red, the streets were bright
Those ancient years were black and white

Rostam,"My ginger voice was raw with smoke
They hid their smiles when I stood and spoke
Some sunny lawn, some Saturday
A face was flushed when I went to sing

Wild Mountain Thyme
But I was crying before the second line
The strawberry stripes across my ruddy cheeks got em giggling
My eyes are red and wild and white
As I choked up over another line
For years and year I disappeared
Tonight I'm here and I'm giving my best
It's all I have

And my teeth are chipped, my beard is gray

From the corner of my eye
When they threw me off the stage

No need to wander around
I live in a nameless town
In a black out

Many friends have said goodbye
Paraded out in one proud line
I say they all just lost their minds

Midnight where we used to dance
Underneath the ugly halogen lamps
Oh, it all went away so fast
In a black out

We’ll wait for the year
When the tide comes
Rolling over the rails
From here 'til the end
Of the island
Washing away

I rent a room with all our stuff
When you come home I’d lift you up

Where could I go? What could I do?
Put in the state, my lips and eyes give me away
And now there’'s nothing, I can say. no
I'm pulled away, I see another of myself
Who's found true love and happiness
To sit and smoke there on the chair for

Two boys, one to kiss your neck
And one to bring you breakfast
Get you out of bed when
You're sore from the night before
From knocking on my door
Your head against the floor boards
Two boys, one to love you sweetly
One does so discreetly
Never will he meet me
But I'm sure that you'll catch your breath
You'll sleep into the day
To wake up with sunlight across your room

Before I leave I want to try to go back in time
To just that moment in my life where I should have spoke up but I lied
As I sat there with my jaw open and I smiled
He pulled his sweater off and tried to explain he'd all but given up on love
I'm pulled away, I see another of myself who's found true love and happiness
To sit and smoke there on the chair
Beside the bed I read this past week's New Yorker
And I watch him paint Antarctica, and watch him paint Antarctica

Your face against the glass
Across 11th Ave

They all wait for something

Roster McCabe,"Girl stands at her window
While fleets of ships and angels float by
Heavy footsteps lead her down the hall and to the edge
She says she'll jump before she learns to fly

A rose and a crow are the same in her mind
Thoughts of self destruction brings her to her knees

When white fades to grey 
Tell me tell me won't you, find the words to say

She stares down streets that are seemingly bare
New life comes from wiping dark tears off her eyes
Wherever she turns now there's nowhere left to hide

Just because they know a thing or two.

Walkin' up and down Broadway,
Telling of the wonders they can do.
There's con men and there's boosters,
Card sharks and crap-shooters.
They congregate around the Metropole.
They wear fancy ties and laces,
But where do they get their aces?
They all have got an ace down in the hole!

Some of them write to the old folks for coin,
And that is their ace in the hole,
And others have friends on the old Tenderloin;
That's their old ace in the hole.

From Florida to the North Pole.

The bubbles under will not erupt
Too late to regret, it is done now

But all this filth just makes it so unreal
Someone needs to clean up this mess
Causing my head to explode (to explode)
I'm all alone, can't tell to anyone
But the voices in me are just as real
This burden is getting too heavy to cope
It's time to end the pain, and let myself go

This decision

It's workin', It's workin'
Party people if you're ready to rock let me hear you scream!

I play for keeps, sidewalks and streets, we reign and we pop, and daily
routine sweeps.
It's the fanatic, can't kick the habit, so there you have it, I'm a addict.
When I'm near the mike I gots to grab it. 
Rip the system to shreds, grab the braids in my head.
Everybody get lifted, remember the rhyme said. 
This is your introduction to the new episode.
With the Double I countin' down to explode.
Naughty kicked in the door, here come 235 more, livin' rotten to the core
everybody to the right, cause all I got left is my flow. 
I'm floatin' with Boogie Beat fishin' in a record ocean. 
Uh oh, I guess it's going' down, not now, right now.
So I got down with the git down for Illtown.  
Figure it's the fine fanny,
I miss my mammy.
And you could ask my uncle Randy, 
I'm grateful for my granny nanny that's my mother's mammy.  
Two tittle brothers with different fathers but we're still family. 
Forget how rough I had it, let's see how smooth it gets. 
'cause I might wind
up doing that same old cruddy shit.
Like clockin', sellin' rocks in my neighborhood.  
Back cockin', buckshottin', your ass is shot.

I'm the soldier rarely seen from the block of 118
I'm a fanatic, can't help bein a hip-hop fiend
Embedded in my enzymes before I tipped my nine
At birth the world knew I was one of a kind
It's all about the music, that's all I know
That's all I heard growin up in E.O.
But yo, let's not dabble in the past
A look at what the future got in store, so I gotta watch my ass
Can my music be the saviour of my grace?
Cause you see reality written on my face
Just a taste of my flavor make you savor for more

It's done when I do mine, for fun when I do mine
It's mine, mine, all mine
The rhyme and the rhythm, I get it from the mind
And put it in the body and soul and then I roll
Steppin on my stroll, I got total control

Hold up, boy, you're ready? Here it comes
Feel the bass from the drums as I expand lyrics from my lungs

Keep a limp in my strut when I walk talkin much
Tell you what, huh, tell me what's really goin on?
Everything's the same, everywhere I go, come on
Go on, so forth and so on, I throw on
A brand new style while I freestyle, me and Lovechild
Reakin, what is it I'm seakin?
I'm always a little tipsy, rip, see, is how I gets busy

Influencing your choice of your listening pleasure
Lyrics are more than a treasure, on wax to remain forever
Clever in my ways, I amaze audiences from the stage
Build up anger, releasin physical rage
Once the spotlight shines it captivated your mind
Eye contacts sendin chills up opponents' spines
This is my place of business, where I'm most relaxed
So many crews stepped up and them fools collapsed

Light up the place like we spark these herbs
Love watch the way that she gwan
When a big tune a play pon the dance-hall set
Selector rewind every chance them get
The rhythm design fi she dance and sweat
All when morning ashine she nuh start dance yet
Man clear the line when she walk and step
But she nah pay no mind to remarks them mek
Always on time take a chance and bet
She's a fine piece of mind with right mindset

She said, ""Junior you're a genius
You think with you're mind and not you're peanuts
Your gang of Jamaican Al Pacinos
Drinking Blue Mountain cappuccinos.""
I say, ""Baby you're the cleanest
The true definition of what my queen is
Nothing could've ever really come between us
Share the same room and Jah will feed us.""

Hey girl!
The way you make me feel
I know your love is real
You satisfy my every want and need

Hey boy!
You're always on my mind
We need to spend more time
Cause no one else can touch my heart inside

So boom!
Animal you never know from you born
Places you only see when travel channel tun on
Our means of trans-p is when the camel run on
Camouflage and fatigue is our style and fashion
""Fliminitti"" weh she have and that is the attraction
What she want is what she get and that is satisfaction
Well she want it all night and not just fi a fraction
Well too much long talking now a time fi action
Well she love fi spend money but she rather spend time

And if mi gone fi ten minute, She call me ten time
If mi nuh pick up then she panic
Then she call mi friend line
Cause she want the veteran fi come and bend up her spine
A substantial amount of African fly squat
I have to sip a roots and bun a one night cap
And she love the veteran, him always hit the right spot
And the way she feel so good
I have to bounce right back

Hey girl!
The way you make me feel
I know your love is real
You satisfy my every want and need

Hey boy!
You're always on my mind
We need to spend more time
Cause no one else can touch my heart inside",Hey Girl,2005

The situation's come and taken over me
Who would've thought it
And my head keeps spinning round and round
Once again you steal the words right out my mouth
Like you had planned it.
The coldest of hearts seem to fall apart.
Cause everything I see
Has got me thinking
This don't look like me

Talking on the phone for hours
Making breakfast in bed
Never see me wanting flowers
Are the words that I said.
I can't believe I'm writing letters
Spell your name out in red

Joke is I'm missin' you
You left at one and now it's half
Past two
Look how you changed me
And why the hell am I calling you baby
It's running of my lips the word escapes me
Lately
And have I now become
Everything I'm not
Or have you made me see
What I always was in reality

Making breakfast in bed
Never see me wanting flowers

I can't believe I'm writing letters

I think that it's time
To swallow all my pride

You could leave something so good

It seems the less you speak
The more I want you here with me

So I pretend as though I never cared
And forget those times that we both have shared

She was walking down the street so I said ""Hello
I'm Kangol from UTFO."" And she said ""So?""
And I said ""So?!? Baby don't you know?
I can sing, rap, and dance in just one show
Cause I'm Kangol, Mr. Sophisticata
As far as I'm concerned ain't nobody greater
From beginning to end and, to beginning
I never lose because I'm all about winning
But if I were to lose, I wouldn't be upset
Cause I'm not a gambler, I don't bet
I don't be in no casino, and baby while you knizzow
The izzi is the grizzeat Kizzangizzo.""
I thought she'd be impress by my devious rap
I thought I had her caught cause I'm a sinister trap
I thought it'd be a piece of cake but it was nothing like that
I guess that's what I get for thinking, ain't that right, black?
Then crizzi to gizzone and seen number izzone
Crizzin ricking tizza of mizzac mic dizza
With the bang bang, brother I feel bad
But I ain't comitting suicide for no crab
But calling her a crab is just a figure of speech
Cause she's an apple, a pear, a plum, and a peach
I thought I had it in the palm of my hand
But man oh man, if I was grand I'd bang Roxanne

Roxanne, Roxanne, can't you understand?
Roxanne, Roxanne, I wanna be your man

Yo Kangol, I don't think that you're dense
Buy you went about the matter with no experience
You should know, she doesn't need a guy like you
She needs a guy like me, with a high IQ
And she'll take to my rap, cause my rap's the best
The educated rapper MD will never fess
So when I met her, I wasted no time
But stuck up Roxanne paid me no mind
She thought my name was Barry, I told her it was Gary
She said she didn't like it so she chose to call me Barry
She said she'd love to marry, my baby she would carry
And if she had a baby, she'd name the baby Harry
Her mother's name is Baby, which is really quite contrary
Her face is really hairy, and you can say it's scary
So isn't not every, her father's a fairy
His job is secondary, in some military
He throws them to an ?electric camp? that wasn't voluntary
His daughter's name is Sherry, his sons are Tom and Jerry
Jerry had the flu but it was only temporary
Back in January, or was it February?
But everytime I say this rhyme it makes me kinda weary
It's only customary to give this commentary
Some say it's bad, some say it's legendary
You can search all you want, try your local library
You'll never find a rhyme like this in any dictionary
But do you know, after all that
All I received was a pat on the back
That's what you get, it happened to me
Ain't that right Mixmaster I-C-E

Roxanne, Roxanne, can't you understand?
Roxanne, Roxanne, I wanna be your man

You thought you had a rose, you thought you was Cupid
But EMD, your rap was plain stupid
I know you're educated, but when will you learn?
Not all girls want to be involved with bookworms
You gotta be strong in a way she can't resist
So educated rapper, huh, bust this...
Since she's a new girl on the block
I had to let her know that I'm the debonoir Doc
I said ""I'd like to speak to you if I can
And if I'm correct your name is Roxanne.""
She said ""How'd you know my name?"" I said ""It's getting around
Right now baby you're the talk of the town
Please let me walk you to the corner, my rap will be brief.""
She said ""I've seen you before, you look like a thief.""
I said ""Me? The Doc? A hood, a rock?
Running around the street robbing people on the block?
Nah, that's not my style, that crime I'm not related
As far as I'm concerned I'm too sophisticated.""
Then it seemed I got busy cause she cracked a smile
That let me know my rap was worth her while
She said ""You call yourself a doctor?"" I said ""This is true.""
She said ""Explain to me really what doctors must do.""
I said ""This is very rare because I don't say this every day
There's a million medical skills a doctor displays
Dermatology is treatment of the skin
Infected and you'll see me and you'll know you're again
There's enthesiology, opthomology
Internal medicine and plastic surgery
Orpedic surgery and pathology
A disease involves a change of the body.""
She said ""Ooooh, that's very unique.""

Save all the drama
Cause here comes the Big Mama
Any bitch who rip Shanny, I bomb her
Cause y'all weak-ass hoes got me fed up 
So hookers, get your gloves, and yo, let's got head up
Wall to wall y'all all will fall
I don't stall cause in this brawl it's winner takes all
A title bout for all the clout
Any hooker tryin to step to this, it's lights out
One hit, your head split, throat slit
Think you're Miss It, but I started this shit
At 14 years old I was goin gold
While I was on tour, you was tourin the hoe stroll
Suckin dicks and turnin tricks to get a quick fix
While I was puttin dope hits in the mix
Rippin shows with Kane and Biz Markie
Fuckin up Roxanne and takin out Sparky
Niggas came in flocks from blocks and blocks 
To watch the Rox knock bitches out the box
And every place I played, I headlined
Striclty big names on the topic read mine
The q-you-double e-n
Queen of emceein
Whenever I flow it's poetry in
Motion, so you can save all the drama
And get the fuck out the way, here comes the Big Mama

	(Mama - mama - Aww!)
	(I gave birth to most of them MC's)

Rhymes are deadly, so hooker, write out your will
Here comes the queen foot-first to your grill
Recitin poems that hit like boulders
Smackin your head dead off your muthafuckin shoulders
So nip all the talk in a bud
This ain't no Game Boy, I came to draw blood
At any hag thinkin that she can last with me 
It only takes one blast, and that ass'll be
Wrecked, ruined, damaged, ripped
Cross my path, your ass'll get whipped
Cause Shanté ain't about no games
Matter of fact, yo, I'ma start callin off names
First up there's Latifah
You roll up, and I'ma smoke that ass like reefer
Cause you ain't never in life been a star to me
Sold the fuck out tryin to go R&B
Now that shit is shady
You say ladies first, well I'm the first lady
And all y'all hoes are phoney
Try to get flippid, I'ma rip you and your girl Monie
You're illegitimate, tryin to get a little bit
And I'm about sick of that 'Monie-in-the-middle'-shit
Your album cold garbage
Had one good jam, now you think you a star, bitch
Breakin your neck tryin to be in the limelight
But give you a mic, and you can't even rhyme right
So get the fuck off the scene
Cause I got a M-16 that says 'Shanny's the queen'
And all you bitches got your style from me
The capital S-h-a-n-t-é
Used to go to my show, analyze how the sound flow
On the down low, fuck around, lay around, hoe

Whenever I come, yo, I come correct
And niggas give me the utmost due respect
And any hag that try to last
'll cold get smoked like marihuana cause her ass is grass
I dig ditches for you bitches
While I collect riches and give you a head full of stitches
Cause in a beef I don't sleep or lollygag
Sendin you hags off-stage in a bodybag
Cause Shanté is a rebel
You say you're lyte as a rock, you get crushed like a pebble
One word, and I'ma bag her
Watch the bitch stagger, cause I don't dig the bulldagger
To me a wush don't deserve a mic in hand
Somebody tell her to stop actin like a man
She needs somethin real thick to help her out quick
(What?) And that's a good piece of dick
Now as for that West Coast slut
With fake-ass hair, contacts, and a patted butt
Instead of stompin to the 90s, use your brain
And stomp your ass down to Jack Lelane
You better hurry and hop on a diet plan
And keep the pork chops out the fryin pan
Yeah, I said it, so what?
You roll up, slut, you get a fuckin gumbut to your gut
I'm bringin tears to all my peers
I ain't new, I been doin this shit for 10 years
Bring any hoe, and I wreck her
I rip the nicest, from Isis down to Salt-N-Pepa
And now you know that I'm the star of the show, hoe 
While I get dough, you're givin up the yo-yo
You say a nigga can't play with it
You got another job? Well bitch, you better stay with it
Cause you ain't shit in this here
Shanté's the queen, and I'm makin it clear
Kickin flavors the way it's supposed to be
That's why no other MC's comin close to me
I leave em all in the dust

Take your ass downtown on 10th Avenue
Because a sister like me is not havin you
Player, go around tellin other brothers that you laid her
So I guess I'll see your ass later
Some brothers approach you while you're shoppin
Their girl's not around, so they're goin hoe-hoppin

You turn your head for a minute, he's tryin to kick it to your mother
Stop smilin, I know all you want to do is hit
And I really don't give a shit
They get mad, cause I always look serious
So they slam on my muthafuckin period
I'm not impressed by the jewelry and the mink, dummy
Why don't you put some of your money in the bank, sonny?
And if I hurt your feelings, I meant to
Cause these here pants you can't get into

With all these muthafuckas hawkin 
With that dumb-lookin grin
Bitch gets in the car that was carryin three men
I know the whole game well
They spend a little money, you end up at a hotel
Well, that's how they planned it
She didn't want to screw, so they left her ass stranded
That's what she gets for wildin
Cold left the dumb bitch somewhere out in Long Island
Next time she'll act decent
And her moms won't have to come and get her ass from a precint
Remember Shanté told you
Drugs is not the only thing a girl can say no to
You gotta watch every move that you make on the street
Word up, cause talk ain't that cheap
It may become a bad habit
You see a brother with a little bit of dough, you want to grab it
I get approached by a man, sometimes I throw a fit
Word, cause brothers ain't shit

Brothers ain't shit
So don't honk your horn, keep rollin
No, I don't want to ride, cause the shit might be stolen
Anyway, I know your number
You got a 'gas, grass or ass'-sticker on your bumper
Go ahead and say I'm stuck up
Cause I ain't doin nothin that will make my rep fucked up
Cause it happens to the best of us
Fuck the rest of us
Niggas keep testin us
A man could make you want to kill him
Or late at night make you want to thrill him
He'll give you money, you can even be fly
But he still has to cheat, and you want to know why?
That's the dog in him - woof, woof!
That makes him get up in the middle of the night and go 'poof!'
You say, ""Yo, yo, where you goin?""
He's cheatin and he's skeezin and you're not even knowin
But this is what they usually do
Suck on the thing, and they make you go ""Whoo...""
And then he hits the door
And for the rest of the night you don't see him no more
He's got shit at your house? Here's what you do
You should do some voodoo

Make him see spiders on the wall
Then make him throw a fit

Roxanne Shanté,"Well, my name is Roxanne, a-don't ya know
I just a-cold rock a party, and I do this show
I said I met these three guys, and you know it's true
A-let me tell you and explain them all to you:
I met this dude with the name of a hat
I didn't even walk away, I didn't give him no rap
But then he got real mad, and he got a little tired
If he worked for me, you know he would be fired
He wears a Kangol, and that is true
But he ain't got money, and he ain't got the loot
And every time that I see him, he's always a-beggin'
And all the other girls that he's always tryin' to leggin'
Every time that I see him, he says a rhyme
But compared to me, they're weak compared to mine
Every time I know that I am sayin' somethin' fresher
In any category I'm considered the best
And every time that I say it there ain't nothin' less
And everybody knows I will win the contest
Then after that came the Educated Rapper
His fingers started snappin', and my hands start to clappin'
Every time that I see him, everything he say
He rock-a to the beat and then he come up this way:
He said-a, ""Yeah, you know your mother's name is Mary,""
And from what I heard, your father is a fairy
Every time that I see him, he's sayin' somethin' new
But let me explain to him what he should do:
He should be like me, a fly MC
Don't never have to bite, we're always right
I have the freshest rhymes that I do recite
And after that, and you know it's true
Well, let me tell you somethin' else about the Doctor, too:
He ain't really cute, and he ain't great
He don't even know how to operate
He came up to me with some crabish rap
But let me tell you somethin' 'cause you know it was wack
So when he came up to me, I told him to step back
He said, ""You call yourself an MC?"" I said, ""This is true,""
He said, ""Explain to me really what MCs must do""
I said, ""Listen very close 'cause I don't say this every day:
My name is Roxanne, and they call me Shanté""
But every time-a I say a rhyme-a just-a like-a this-a
It is something you MCs can't miss-a
So Kangol if you think you're cute, you think it's all right
That's why you said it in a language so you wouldn't have to bite
You started talkin' Pig Latin, didn't make no sense
You thought you was cute, yeah, you thought you was a prince
You're walkin' down the block, yeah around when you're gonna clock
But everybody knows that you're all on my yacht
I'm just the devastatin', always rockin', always have the niggas clockin'
Everybody knows it's me, yeah, the R-O-X-A-N-N-E
Everyone knows I am fresher, any category best
So every time I start to write-a, everyone assists or to bite-a
Every time I do it, yeah, you know it is-a me-a
Rockin' on the beat-a that you can see
So, the UTFO crew, you know what you can do
Lemme tell you one for me, and then I'll tell you one for you
Every time you sayin', rhymin' just-a like-a this-a
It ain't nothin' that I don't want to miss-a
And if you're thinkin' right, and I'm bitin' your beat
Well, then you just better know, and a-listen to me
Because my name is Roxanne-a, and I came to say
I'm rockin' to the beat-a, and I do it this way
I'm conceited, never beated, never heard of defeated
I'm rockin' to the beat-a, and you know it is-a me-a:
The R-O-X-A-N-N-E-a
And if you want to play a little game for me
Lemme show you what you can do, baby
'Cause with a twist of my cheek, and a twist of my wrist
I have all the guys droppin' down like this
Yeah, I am fly, that I must admit
But everybody knows I don't go for it
So, if you're tryin' to be cute and you're tryin' to be fine
You need to cut it out 'cause it's all in your mind
Tryin' to be like me, yeah, is very hard
You think you are God, but you do eat lard
Tryin' to be cute, and you're tryin' to be fly
Don't you know you wish you could be my guy?
So I can take you home, make you relax
And everybody knows that you're out there, tryin' to tax
Like corn-on-the-cob, you're always tryin' to rob
You need to be out there, lookin' for a job
Yeah, you're tryin' to be, and talk about Roxanne
But lemme let ya know, you're not a real man
'Cause a Roxanne needs a man, and yes:
Someone fresh who always dress
Someone, yeah, who will never fess
And then I'll say, yeah, the rest
You gotta be cute and you're tryna be fly
But all you wanna be is Roxanne's guy
Because I turned you down without a frown
Embarrassed you in front of your friends, made you look like a clown
And all you do is get real mad
And you talk about me, and make me look bad?
And everybody knows how the story goes
There's no ifs, no ands, no buts, or suppose
No coke up your nose, no dope in your vein
And then it won't cause no kind of pain

From beginning to end and, to beginning
I never lose because I'm all about winning
But if I were to lose, I wouldn't be upset
Cause I'm not a gambler, I don't bet
I don't be in no casino, and baby while you knizzow
The izzi is the grizzeat Kizzangizzo.""
I thought she'd be impress by my devious rap
I thought I had her caught cause I'm a sinister trap
I thought it'd be a piece of cake but it was nothing like that
I guess that's what I get for thinking, ain't that right, black?
Then crizzi to gizzone and seen number izzone
Crizzin ricking tizza of mizzac mic dizza
With the bang bang, brother I feel bad
But I ain't comitting suicide for no crab
But calling her a crab is just a figure of speech
Cause she's an apple, a pear, a plum, and a peach
I thought I had it in the palm of my hand
But man oh man, if I was grand I'd bang Roxanne

Roxanne, Roxanne, can't you understand?
Roxanne, Roxanne, I wanna be your man

Yo Kangol, I don't think that you're dense
Buy you went about the matter with no experience
You should know, she doesn't need a guy like you
She needs a guy like me, with a high IQ
And she'll take to my rap, cause my rap's the best
The educated rapper MD will never fess
So when I met her, I wasted no time
But stuck up Roxanne paid me no mind
She thought my name was Barry, I told her it was Gary
She said she didn't like it so she chose to call me Barry
She said she'd love to marry, my baby she would carry
And if she had a baby, she'd name the baby Harry
Her mother's name is Baby, which is really quite contrary
Her face is really hairy, and you can say it's scary
So isn't not every, her father's a fairy
His job is secondary, in some military
He throws them to an ?electric camp? that wasn't voluntary
His daughter's name is Sherry, his sons are Tom and Jerry
Jerry had the flu but it was only temporary
Back in January, or was it February?
But everytime I say this rhyme it makes me kinda weary
It's only customary to give this commentary
Some say it's bad, some say it's legendary
You can search all you want, try your local library
You'll never find a rhyme like this in any dictionary
But do you know, after all that
All I received was a pat on the back
That's what you get, it happened to me
Ain't that right Mixmaster I-C-E

Roxanne, Roxanne, can't you understand?
Roxanne, Roxanne, I wanna be your man

You thought you had a rose, you thought you was Cupid
But EMD, your rap was plain stupid
I know you're educated, but when will you learn?
Not all girls want to be involved with bookworms
You gotta be strong in a way she can't resist
So educated rapper, huh, bust this...
Since she's a new girl on the block
I had to let her know that I'm the debonoir Doc
I said ""I'd like to speak to you if I can
And if I'm correct your name is Roxanne.""
She said ""How'd you know my name?"" I said ""It's getting around
Right now baby you're the talk of the town
Please let me walk you to the corner, my rap will be brief.""
She said ""I've seen you before, you look like a thief.""
I said ""Me? The Doc? A hood, a rock?
Running around the street robbing people on the block?
Nah, that's not my style, that crime I'm not related
As far as I'm concerned I'm too sophisticated.""
Then it seemed I got busy cause she cracked a smile
That let me know my rap was worth her while
She said ""You call yourself a doctor?"" I said ""This is true.""
She said ""Explain to me really what doctors must do.""
I said ""This is very rare because I don't say this every day
There's a million medical skills a doctor displays
Dermatology is treatment of the skin
Infected and you'll see me and you'll know you're again
There's enthesiology, opthomology
Internal medicine and plastic surgery
Orpedic surgery and pathology
A disease involves a change of the body.""
She said ""Ooooh, that's very unique.""
Gave me her number and kissed me on the cheek
She said she had to go but be back by 8
So to call her at 9 to arrange a date",Roxanne Roxanne (The New Chapter),2014
Roxanne Tataei,"This city, everywhere I go, I see faces I know
All in their different zones
As we're flying through this world underground
And my eyes are wide shut, I'm not hearing a sound

Time standing still
Surrounded by sad hearts unfulfilled
Empty places for the disenchanted
Pass and fade away

Distant dreams, where I go
Distant dreams, when I'm low
As they echo in my head

Distant dreams, how they flow
Distant dreams, moving slow
As I'm falling out of time
I still have distant dreams here in my mind

Faces distorted by pressure
Everyone forced together
Spilling out through the doors

No more spaces
It's a dog-eat-dog world
And a mad free-for-all
Maybe room for one more

Time standing still
Surrounded by sad hearts unfulfilled
Empty places for the disenchanted
Pass and fade away

Distant dreams, where I go
Distant dreams, when I'm low
As they echo in my head

Distant dreams, how they flow
Distant dreams, moving slow
As I'm falling out of time
I still have distant dreams here in my mind

Distant dreams, where I go
Distant dreams, when I'm low
As they echo, echo in my head

Distant dreams, how they flow
Distant dreams, moving slow
As heartbreak surrounds me
And heartache has found me

Distant dreams, where I go
Distant dreams, when I'm low
As they echo in my head

Distant dreams, how they flow
Distant dreams, moving slow
As I'm falling out of time
I still have distant dreams here in my mind

There was a girl on Cinnamon Street, the same age as me, we shared the curiosity. I won her heart 'cause I could play guitar. I promised her heaven at once and later all the stars. But it all remained the same 'cause things can never change on Cinnamon Street.

I can hear my heartbeat the very first time we made love, life was a lazy rest in the sun. Later we went dancing, staying up all night long - playing all our favourite songs, Cinnamon songs: Oh oh na na na na na.

I say goodbye to Cinnamon Street. Springtime is here and the air is so dry and sweet. I walk in a cloud, the smell of cinnamon bread, it's in my blood since the day I was born 'til I wake up... dead. And the sun is smiling gently, a funny shade of red, Cinnamon Street.

In a time where the sun descends alone,

I will try,
I just need a little time
To get your face right out of my mind,
To see the world through different eyes

Every time you leave the room
I feel I'm fading like a flower

When I reach out there's nothing to find,
When I sleep I break down and cry

Anyone who ever stood in the light
Needs no explaining
But everything more or less appears so meaningless
Blue and cold
Walking alone through the afternoon traffic
I miss you so

Anyone who felt like I do
Anyone who wasn't ready to fall
Anyone who loved like I do
Knows it never really happens at all
It's over when it's over
What can I do about it
Now that it's over

Everything more or less is looking so meaningless
And fades to grey
Lying awake in an ocean of teardrops
I float away

Anyone who ever felt like I do
Anyone who wasn't ready to fall
Anyone who loved like I do
Knows it never really happens at all
It's over when it's over
What can I do about it

Roxette,"My girl came home to me
Just the other day acting okay
I was reading alone
In my favourite room the TV was on

May I be excused 
For not telling the truth

Cause she's gone
She said she's better off on her own
She turned her head 
Much better off on her own

My girl knocked on the door
To the place I usually refer to as home
I died surely some tied
She looked in my eyes
Small and surprised

And God closed every gates
The moon fell into the lake

Boy she's gone, adrift
She's better off on her own
She closed, then she left
Much better off on her own

Sitting naked by the window sill
Watching cars upon the hill
Am I sleeping? I was dreaming
For just a moment time stood still

Better off on her own
Better off on her own

Now she's gone, she said
She's better off on her own
She turned her head
Much better off on her own

She's gone, she sighed
She's better off on her own
The tears I cry
Much better off on her own

I sat up all night
Just to watch your smile

Is there a better place to be?
