Maxine Sullivan,"Goodnight my love, the tired old moon is descending
Goodnight my love, my moment with you now is ending
It was so heavenly, holding you, close to me
It will be heavenly to hold you again in a dream
The stars above have promised to meet us tomorrow
Till then my love, how dreary the new day will seem
So for the present, dear, we'll have to part
Sleep tight, my love, goodnight, my love
Remember that you're mine sweetheart
 
Goodnight my love, your mommy is kneeling beside you
Goodnight my love, to dreamland the sandman will guide you
Come now you sleepyhead, close your eyes, and go to bed
My precious sleepyhead, you mustn't play peek-a-boo
Goodnight my love, your little Dutch dolly is yawning
Goodnight my love, your teddy bear called it a day
Your doggy's fast asleep, my but he's smart
Sleep tight, my love, goodnight my love
",Goodnight My Love,1997
Maxine Sullivan,"I'll be seeing you;
In all the old, familiar places;
That this heart of mine embraces;
All day through.

In that small cafe;
The park across the way;
The children's carousel;
The chestnut tree;
The wishing well.

I'll be seeing you;
In every lovely, summers day;
And everything that's bright and gay;
I'll always think of you that way;
I'll find you in the morning sun;
And when the night is new;
I'll be looking at the moon;
But I'll be seeing you.",I'll Be Seeing You,1997
Maxine Sullivan,"I'm thru with love,
I'll never fall again.
Said I do to love,
Don't ever call again.
For I must have you
Or no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.

I've locked my heart.
I keep my feelings there.
I have stopped my heart
Like an icy frigidaire.
For I need to care for no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.

Why did you leave me
To think that you cared.
You didn't need me.
You have your share
of slaves around you
To hound you and swear
Their deep devotion.
Emotion.

Did you good by the spring 
And all it meant to me
a good neighbor 
The things that used to be.
For I must have you or no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.
That's why I'm thru with love.",I'm Through With Love,1997
Maxine Sullivan,"You are a picture no artist could paint
But you're a mixture of devil and saint
I just sigh and dream and try to figure you out!
Love is in season, the moon's  up above
Tho' it be treason to question your love
Ev'rytime I look at you My heart's in doubt
 
I've got a feelin' you're foolin'
I've got a feelin' you're havin' fun
I'll get a goby when you are done foolin' with me
I've got a feelin' you're foolin'
I've got a notion it's make believe
I think you're laughin' right up  your sleeve 
Foolin' with me
Life is worth living while you are giving moments of paradise
You're such a stand out 
But how you handout that hokus, pokus from your eyes
I've got a feelin' you're foolin'
I've got a feelin' it's all a frame
It's just the well known old army game foolin' with you
 
I've got a feelin' you're foolin'
I've got a feelin' you're havin' fun
I'll get a goby when you are done foolin' with me

Maxine Sullivan,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love [#],1997
Maxine Sullivan,"It's very clear
Our love is here to stay
Not for a year
But ever and a day
The radio and the telephone
And the movies that we know
May be passing fancies
And in time may go
But oh my dear
Our love is here to stay
Together we're
Goin' a long, long way
In time
The Rockies may crumble
Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here
Oh Our love is here
But our love is here to stay.",Love Is Here to Stay [#],1997
Maxine Sullivan,"I've been around the world in a plane
Settled revolutions in Spain
The North Pole I have charted
But can't get started with you
And at the golf course I'm under par
Metro-Goldwyn wants me to star
I've got a house and a show place
But can't get no place with you

You're so supreme
The lyrics I write of you
Dream, dream, day and night of you
Scheme just for the sight of you
Baby but what good dose it do
I've been consulted by Franklin D.
Even Gable had me to tea
But now I'm broken hearted
Can't get started with you

You're so supreme

Dream, dream, day and night of you
Scheme just for the sight of you

Maxine Sullivan,"Don't want my mammy
I don't need a friend
My heart is broken, it won't ever mend
I ain't much carin' 
Just where I will end
I must have that man

I'm like an oven
That's cryin' for heat
He treats me awful
Each time we meet
It's just unlawful
How that boy can cheat
But I must have that man

He's hot as Hades
A lady's not safe in his arms when she's kissed
But I'm afraid that when he's cooled off
And maybe I'm ruled off his list
I'll never be missed
I need that person much worse 'n just bad
I'm half alive 'n he's drivin' me mad
He's only human if he's to be had
I must have that man

I must have that man",I Must Have That Man!,1997
Maxine Sullivan,"Mad about the boy
I know it's stupid to be mad about the boy
I'm so ashamed of it but must admit
The sleepless nights I've had about the boy

On the silver screen
He melts my foolish heart in every single scene
Although I'm quite aware that here and there
Are traces of the cad, about the boy

Lord knows I'm not a fool girl
I really shouldn't care
Lord knows I'm not a school girl
In the fury of her first affair

Will it ever cloy
This odd diversity of misery and joy?
I'm feeling quite insane and young again
And all because I'm mad about the boy

So if I could employ
A little magic that will finally destroy
This dream that pains me and enchains me
But I can't because I'm mad, I'm mad about the boy",Mad About the Boy,1997
Maxine Sullivan,"When you're alone, who cares for starlit skies
When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies
At break of dawn, there is no sunrise
When your lover has gone

What lonely hours, the evening shadows bring
What lonely hours with memories lingering
Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything
When your lover has gone

Maxine Sullivan,"I'm gonna' love you, like nobody's loved you
Come rain or come shine
High as a mountain, deep as a river
Come rain or come shine

I guess when you met me
It was just one of those things
But don't you ever bet me
Cause' I'm gonna' be true if you let me

You're gonna' love me, like nobody's loved me
Come rain or come shine
We'll be happy together, unhappy together
Now won't that be fine

The days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in or out of the money
But I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine",Come Rain or Come Shine,1998
Maxine Sullivan,"Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today, madam.
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today.
She is sorry to be delayed
But last evening down at Lover's Lane she strayed, madam.
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today.

When she woke up and found
That her dream of love had gone, madam,
She ran to the man
Who had led her so far astray

And from under her velvet gown
She drew a gun and shot her lover down.
Madam, Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today.

When the mob came and got her
And dragged her from the jail, madam,
They strung her up
On the old willow across the way.
And the moment before she died
She lifted up her lovely head and cried, madam.
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today.
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today.",Miss Otis Regrets,1998
Maxine Sullivan,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Won't you lead me there?",Skylark,1998
Maxine Sullivan,"My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
And dear, I wonder if you find love
An optical illusion, too?

Are the stars out tonight?
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
Cause I only have eyes for you, dear
The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
Cause I only have eyes for you.

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue
You are here, so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you",I Only Have Eyes for You [#],1999
Maxine Sullivan,"I got my man now I got Porgy
My baby understands now I got my Porgy
I'm through with bymays his way is may way forever more
Lord when i feel his arms around me
Knowing he can't go on without me
I wants to beg for a chance to camp at his door

Say he's not much for to look and see
He's lazy and no count as he can be
He's got the kind of a love for me
So I'm changing my style my way of living
Glad I've stopped taking and started giving

Maxine Sullivan,"Here I go again, I hear those trumpets blow again.
All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again.
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.",Taking a Chance on Love,1999
Maxine Sullivan,"Some say that love is sweet as a rose,
Some say it's honey and the bee,
Well sit right down and let me tell you
What my love is to me.

Because I'm sweet on ""Candy""
And ""Candy"" is sweet on me

Those April Fool days brought me loveless joys
I read my Plato, love, I thought a sin
But since your kiss I'm reading Missus Glyn

I took one look at you, that's all I meant to do
And then my heart stood still
My feet could step and walk, my lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken I could tell you knew
That unfelt clasp of hands told me so well you knew
I never lived at all until that thrill of that moment when my heart stood still

Is lonely and silent, the shades are all drawn,
And my heart is heavy as I gaze upon

The lawn we were proud of is waving in hay,
Our beautiful garden has withered away,
Where you planted roses,the weeds seem to say,
A cottage for sale.

From every single window, I see your face,
But when I reach a window, there's empty space.
The key's in the mail box the same as before,
But no one is waiting any more,

Brought the sun and the flowers where there use to be rain
Umm, my yesterdays were blue dear
Today I'm a part of you dear
Yes, my lonely nights are through dear

Maxine Sullivan,"Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger 
The longer I stay away

Miss the moss-covered vines, tall sugar pines
Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

The moonlight on the bayou
A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

Maxine Sullivan,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows

Maybe I can't give you diamonds and things like I want to,
But I can promise you, baby, I'm gonna want to as long as I live.

I never cared, but now I'm scared, I won't live long enough.
That's why I wear my rubbers when it rains 
And eat an apple every day then see
The doctor anyway.

What if I can't live to love you as long as I want to.
Long as I promise you, baby, I'm gonna love you as long I live.

And I'm realizing that 
You're not coming back

With another love 
In someone else's arms 
And all my dreams were shattered all at once

Brightened someone else's day 
She took your smile away 
And left me with just memories all at once

Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow
If I fail, if I succeed 
At least I lived as I believe 
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all inside of me
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself, it is the greatest love of all

Auf der Fahne steht 187
Wir können sagen wir habens riskiert
Immer grade, egal was passiert
Dicken Wagen und Bares kassieren
Wir machen Alarm bis die Lage eskaliert",Bis die Lage eskaliert,2015
Maxwell,"187, wir lassen es laufen
Der Bass viel zu laut, doch es macht mir nichts aus
Ey das Studio steht, wir habens geschafft
Die Lage ist krass, zum schlafen ist Platz
Wir sind Promis, he. Klappstuhl, Blick auf die Sterne
Strom abgestellt, unser Licht ist ne Kerze
Samstag ist Flohmarkt und ich bin der Erste
Mein Leben bis jetzt wie im Lotto ein Sechser
Jeden Tag high, auf die Knochen mein Bester
Meine Familie, meine Gang
Keine weiße Weste nur ein weißes Hemd
Nike TN, guck ich lebe den Scheiß
Digga immer noch kein Loch, meine Zähne sind weiß
Eure Mukke war gestern, seht es doch ein
Wer nicht mit der Zeit geht, geht mit der Zeit

Digga so high man, wir rasieren euch weg im Vorbeifahren
Vorbei fahren, ratatat aus dem Kleinwagen
Ganz einfach, wir fegen euch weg im Vorbeifahren
Vorbei fahren, Fenster runter, kein Spaß

Bald ist morgen schon gestern
Die Leute sind Non-Stop am Lästern
Wollen Stress haben
Kein Problem! Man sieht sich demnächst in der S-Bahn
Gib ein fick auf die Presse, ich presse beim scheißen
Was für ein Rücken? Vertrau nur meinem Eisen
Krokos die beißen, die meinen das ernst!
Gib uns was ab, man, der Scheiß war kein Scherz
Kohlefilter, Pur gebaut
Auf den Papers ist mein Foto drauf
Die Klamotten gefälscht, doch die Treter sind echt
Trag mein eigenes Merch, Dr. Fly , Mr. Fresh
Ich weiß wo du Sport machst, weiß wo du fickst
Ich weiß auch wo deine Oma's Altersheim ist
Und roll direkt vor deinen Bunker, die Heckscheibe runter
Ratatatata, was?!

Acht Zeilen schreiben, ne Kleinigkeit
Maxwell, ein weiterer Meilenstein
Rapper sein ist geil, ich bleib dabei
Der heißeste Nigga hier weit und breit
Arbeitsamt stellt seine Leistung ein
Kein Eigenheim, doch ich steiger mein Hype
Bin bereit für Streit! Bist du bereit für Streit?
Ratatata macht der Motherfucker
Mach das mal nach was der Macker da macht
Sag das nochmal, man wir scheißen auf Hundert
Hier draußen wirds heiß, besser bleib in deinem Bunker
Fenster geht runter: Automatik
Ich höre erst auf wenn das Auto Gas gibt
Lauf aus Platin, bitte fuckt mich nicht ab
Ratatatat macht die Nachbarschaft wach

Weil wir Weed konsumiern' auf dem Streetball-Turnier
Hamburg West ist mein Nest, Digga jeden Tag ein Überfall
Ich bin der Hahn im Korb, deutscher Rap ein Hühnerstall
Bonez - Das bin ich, meine Jordans sind frisch
Und das Schwein auf meinem Teller ist gestorben für mich
5 Liter Bierfass, aus dem Gefrierfach
Besser halt den Ball flach, sonst passiert was
Warum ich das preisgebe? Weil ich diesen Scheiß lebe

Führerschein yok, ich hab wieder kein Job
Doch Dealer am Block, der Nigga fühlt sich top
Erster im Monat, Kofi und einkleiden
3 Streifen, Nike-Zeichen
Ich bin ein krasser Macker, ein echter Motherfucker
Hast du Tabak da? Dann bastel ich ein krassen Baba
Du machst auf Hipster mit Jacke von Starter?
Zack, zapzarap man, ich schnapp mir dein Fahrrad
Ab zum Iraner, Hackspieß mit Reis
Digga mach kein Palaber, ich hab keine Zeit
Money over chicken, fick die Radiocharts

Da geht's um Essen und um alles Digga, verstehst du?
Da geht's um wo ich penn und so, verstehst du was ich meine?
Das ist 187!

Erst wenn das letzte Pape gerollt ist, pack ich hier ein
Ich wollte den Scheiß also soll's jetzt so sein
Verfolgst dus allein? Nein!
Meine Beute wird geteilt, der Erfolg bringt den Neid
Therapeuten suchen Streit, sagen du bist Soziopath
Doch der Hurensohn von Staat kriegt 'ne Kugel in seinen Arsch
Ich blute für mein Schnapp, ich hafte für die Gang
Verteidige die Fam, es macht alles einen Sinn
Reingehen, rauskommen, Feinde ausknocken
Hatte mir was vorgenommen, doch hab schon wieder Post bekommen
Du Fotzensohn, fick deine Mama jetzt
Jeder weiß du petzt, wenn du in der Scheiße steckst
Hab keinen Respekt vor Ratten die das Schiff verlassen (Schiff verlassen)
Bring sie ran und ich fick die Spasten (fick die Spasten)
187 wir sind Hits am machen (Hits am machen)
Und darauf kannst du dich verlassen (dich verlassen)

Erst wenn das letzte Pape gerollt ist, dann pack ein
Nur wenn das beste Haze im Joint, dann werd ich high
Ich mach's nochmal deutlich, meine Mannschaft die geilste
Niemals alleine, Angst hab ich keine

Seit 2012 Digga drei Mal auf Tour
Ich bleib in der Spur, es ist Zeit für 'ne Uhr
Weiterhin stur, das ist meine Natur
Rein in die Bufo, schick Feinde auf Kur
Meine Masche zu krass, hab 'ne Maske im Sack
Bis die Kasse bei mir platzt lass ich's krachen in der Nacht, was?
Leb nach meinen Regeln, fick diesen Staat
Und bis Scheine regnen dreht der Nigga richtig am Rad
Mit den Flittchen im Park wird der Rahmen gesprengt
High sein vor Eiweis, der Hase am brennen
187 Ich mache mich grade für die Gang
Fahre keinen Benz aber hab tausende von Fans
Shisha mit Eisschlauch, Fifa und ein' bauen
High rauchen, mit Lilanen einkaufen
So geil aussehen, dass die Weiber heiß laufen
Mein scheiß Outfit kostet circa eintausend

Hast du Gras? Warst du Knast?“
Sie will Foto, ich mach Schnapp
Zur Belohnung gibts meinen Schwanz

Deine Barbie geht dir fremd
Durch meinen Gaunergang mach ich dir V-Mann Angst

Meid den Blickkontakt, sonst ist gleich Schicht im Schacht
Mitternacht in der Stadt, Schicksalsschlag, Gitterstab

Handy klackt, Text verkackt, Polizei hängt am Sack
Meine Schlampe lenkt nicht ab, 3 Uhr nachts dein Fenster kracht
Gangster machen schnapp schnapp, du bist ein Verlierer
Tu nicht so auf Dealer, deine Schuhe sind von Fila
Wir leben auf einem Planeten voll Affen
Bewegen die Massen, die Mädels angaffen
Geschäfte laufen, Hunde verkaufen
Funkelnde Augen, 'ne Runde verschnaufen
Ja wenn du das suckst, dann weiter so machst, dann
Dann rappe vom Benz, man, fahre mit Mazda
Egal ob mit Glatze oder mit Rasta, hundertmal krasser

Richter legen uns in Ketten, aus Stacheldraht
Kinder schlafen in Zellen wegen Tatverdacht
Immer Fragen stellen - LKA, zu abgefuckt, der verkackte Staat

Das ist meine Lieblingszahl, ich sag' es mir jeden Tag
Fick deine Phrasen, ich verteil Haken
Will Richter bestrafen, doch sitz und muss warten
Eins Acht Sieben überall, und das hält ein Leben lang
Knast hat mich abgestumpft, Quellen werden abgepumpt
Komm' um mein Schnapp zu holen, lenk jetzt nicht ab du Hund

Bei mir dreht es sich um Scheine kassieren, Weiber poussieren
Und weiter mein' Hals tätowieren
Kein' interessierts hier, was du Fotze für Spaß hast
Kapuze auf, Nacht's raus auf den Parkplatz - Schwarzmarkt startklar
Ein Nigger aus der Hafenstadt, Tash macht wach, der Hase macht mich platt - krass
Zur Unterwelt hab ich ein cooles Verhältnis
Was willst du tun in einer Welt wo das Geld spricht
Man gibt Alles doch erhält Nichts
Deshalb fick ich diesen Staat, bis er mich in 'ne Zelle schickt
Wenn ich fick, digga, dann aber richtig, mein Standard ist top - Tarantelspinn' giftig

Trotzdem hab ich über sieben Jahre Knast in der Gang
Kassen zu stehlen um dann haften zu gehen

Helf dir auf und sag nett ': ""lauf lieber weg!""

You can walk, you can do what you want
But if the smallest seed of feeling is left in you
You will see you were wrong

With your crimes you convicted me
As you swore so convincingly
You played the game of Gods
You played the game of Gods
Oh in this game, the game
You blow off

I lay myself on the floor
Give it up, threw my hands through the door
How could I give you what you can't accept?
How can I make you more present?
All I can do is come through and be more than you are
Whip out the phone but I'm sure you'll ignore your response

As you lied so convincingly
And you swore so religiously
You played the game of Gods
You played the games of Gods
You played the game of Gods
Oh in this game, the game
You blow off

I wanna get close
Wanna rock, wanna lie, wanna roll
Baby I'll give you all your happiness
Sometimes I feel like I'm losing it
How can I do unto you when you use everyone?
Sometimes I feel like I'm losing it
Without the truth there's no room, there's no room anymore
Sometimes I feel like I'm losing it

As you fight so judiciously
And you swore so convincingly
You played the game of Gods

A simple music lesson, think about it

Everybody thinks to MC tough
Your lyrics must be about negative stuff
Go raving, no-one's skanking
Turn around I bet you some-one's shanking
Jus 'coz we come from the gutter
We know about scraping the bottom of the butter
Don't mean we have to be sinners
Major labels don't want killers
Think
Who's gonna sign a guy with a shank
Or a guy with a nine mil
All you're gonna get is a three figure deal
You'll MC at a rave and get a bill
But that bill ain't gonna last
It will go fast
And it might be the last shubs for a while
So you won't have no dough for a while
Serious

To the beat
Jus bop your head to the beat
If you don't wanna dance to the beat
Just bop your head to the beat
If you don't wanna dance or Lean Back
Then bop your head to the beat
If you dont wanna dance to beat
Just bop your head to the beat

You're not serious
Don't say serious
'Cause I say serious
You wanna get serious
Let's get serious
You can't act serious
So don't say serious
About serious

You're not serious
Don't say serious
'Cause I say serious
You wanna get serious
Let's get serious
You can't act serious
So don't say serious
About serious

Everbody says, that garage should top
'Cause it's cheap like calipso or tip-top
MC's turn UK Hip-Hop
Scared their debut album will flop
I'm floggin food like a chip-shop
So I'll fall back on that If this flops
Plus I go uni so if shit pops off with the cops
Trust me I've got it locked
How comes, Every single MC is vexed
It's like the whole point of MC-ing nowadays is to get a reload on the decks
Man will go to radio on Thursday
Even though it's his birthday
He'll spit lyrics like it's the worst day in his life
It's not serious
Serious

Everybody knows you're some goody-goody
That screw-face and that Roca-Wear hoody
Just ain't workin
Sorry Bredrin
I'm buzz lightyear and you come like Woody

Look at my man biggin up his chest
Looks like he's tryin to grow some breast
Stop that, before you get an arch-back
I don't know who my man's tryin to impress

Everybody know's that I shot Os
And I make P, shot Q's like Kano
Under my toungue is were they go
Shottin' since Wiley had cane-rows

To make dough you need sense
I still dont throw away five pence
One cat thought I was dense
Owed me a lump some and he tried jump some fence

Maxxtone,"Twice upon a time in the valley of tear
The auctioneer is bidding for a box of fading years
And the elephants are dancing on the graves of squealing mice.
Anyone for tennis, wouldn't that be nice?

And the ice creams are all melting on the streets of bloody beer
While beggars stain the pavement with fluorescent Christmas cheer
And the Bentley driving guru is putting up his price.
Anyone for tennis, wouldn't that be nice?

And the prophets in the boutiques give out messages of hope
With jingle bells and fairy tales and blind colliding scopes
And you can tell they're all the same underneath the pretty lies.
Anyone for tennis, wouldn't that be nice?

The yellow Buddhist monk is burning brightly at the zoo
You can bring a bowl of rice and a glass of water too
And fate is setting up the chessboard while death rolls out the dice.

From way out in the west
She wants somebody, who's workin' all day

One of the beautiful people 
Now that you know who you are 
What do you want to be 
And have you traveled very far 
Far as the eye can see 

How does it feel to be 
One of the beautiful people 
How often have you been there 
Often enough to know 
What did you see when you were there 
Nothing that doesn't show

May May Ali,"I am Posdnous 
I be the new generation of slaves 
Here to make papes to buy a record exec rakes 
The pile of revenue I create 

But I guess I don't get a cut 'cause my rent's a month late 
Product of a North Carolina cat 
Who scratched the back of a pretty woman named Hattie 
Who departed life just a little too soon 

And didn't see me grab the Plug Tune fame 
As we go a little somethin' like this 
Look ma, no protection 
Now I got a daughter named Ayana Monay 

And I can play the cowboy to rustle in the dough 
So the scenery is healthy where her eyes lay 
I am an early bird but the feathers are black 
So the apples that I catch are usually all worms 

But it's a must to decipher one's queen 
From a worm who plays groupie and spread around the bad germ 
I cherish the twilight 
I maximize, my soul is the right size 

I watch for the power to run out on the moon 
(And that'll be sometime soon) 
Faker than a fist of kids 
Speakin' that they're black 

When they're just niggas trying to be Greek 
Or some tongues who lied 
And said ""We'll be natives to the end"" 
Nowadays we don't even speak 

I guess we got our own life to live 
Or is it because we want our own kingdom to rule? 
Every now and then I step to the now 
For now I see back then I might have acted like a fool 

Now I won't apologize for it 
This is not a bunch of Bradys 
But a bunch of black man's pride 
Yet I can safely say 

I've never played a sister by touching where her private parts reside 
I've always walked the right side of the road 
If I wasn't making song I wouldn't be a thug selling drugs 
But a man with a plan 

And if I was a rug cleaner 
Betcha Pos'd have the cleanest rugs I am.  
The Plug Two brand with the flavour 
In the flute watch the sniffin' 

So a sack of shows in demand 
I read the diction from the second page 
I got the one-two gauge 
Baritone to the izm fan 

Trees fall so I can play ground with my ink 
So let me need ya to my ems go 
I push the infinite and carry it 
My carrier's the three over one 

So my pluggins already know 
Lick shots with moo 
Catch the boo 
From a ghost in the heckling crowd 

If I give a foot 
Jack Ville caught a spill 
When a still came from my mouth 
I brought a head down south 

I don't check for the noose and the neck 
So I never tell my ems 
That finesse is knocking at my door 
I choose to run from the rays of the burning sun 

And dodge a needle washing up upon a sandy shore 
I bring the element H with the 2 
So ya owe me what's coming when I'm raining on your new parade 
It's just mind over matter 

And what matters is 
That the mind isn't guided by the punished shade 
I keep the walking on the right side 
But I won't judge the next who handles walking on the wrong 

'Cause that's how he wants to be 
No difference, see 
I want to be like the name of this song I am 
I am Posdnous 

I be the new generation of slaves 
Here to make papes to buy a record exec rakes 
The pile of revenue I create 
But I guess I don't get a cut 'cause my rent's a month late 

The deeds of a natural 
Are seeds that are no longer planted 
So the famine in the mind is strong 
Tactics of another plane is now proven sane 

Sane enough to let you know from within this song 
I stabilize many cableized viewers 
So my occupation's known 
But not why I occupy 

And that is to bring the peace 
Not in the flower but the As-Salaam Alaikum in the third I am",I Am I Be,1993

I never wink back at fireflies
But now that the stars are in your eyes

I never went in for afterglow
Or candlelight on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low
I'm beginning to see the light

Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark
That's a four-alarm fire now

I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine

Soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight
Love-making in a park
Summer night city

In the sun I feel like sleeping
I can't take it for too long
My impatience slowly creeping
Up my spine and growing strong
I know what's waiting there for me
Tonight I'm loose and fancy-free

When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo

Time to breath and time to live

We don't miss them when they're gone
I love the feeling in the air

I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction

You stepped into my life

Before you came my way
I always checked this out;
So much pain in love
And so alone inside.
I never thought
That I'd believe in love so much.
But darling when you came close to me,
Suddenly, suddenly

You will never know 
What you have done, my love.
You gave me so much more
My love is worthy of.

Close to me.

This time before you run to her

Worth more than my love and affection?

And rush off to her charms

And they ain't got no problem spraying your ass, like disinfectant
So if I feel disrespected, I promise you family
Your body gon' be hollow tip infested
I come from the slums of the 212
H-Dub, Lennox Ave, fuck you gon' do?
We got wild clips duke, with things that'll hit you
And leave a hole so big your moms could put a whole wrist through
Homes, you don't want to push me there
To the point, I gotta leave you in a bush somewhere
Nah, you don't want to push me there
It ain't worth it, dog, homeboy you better - better, huh
Before I aim in you -- huh, it's real
You heard Millz real, and better believe it stupid 'cause --
Nah, come on, Slay you know who to holla at
I'm heavy ever where from Harlem to the bottom where the rude boys and shottas sat
Hell is what I'm giving em, fuck hurtin', I'm killing em
Got legends ready to pick back up they pen and spit again

I nurture the track, the perfect of rap
Its nonsense how the don, get curved it, to clap
You miss me, simply, I asserted the track
Kay classic, the same game, dog, with packs
Mobsters with the arms up, feel the game wit me
Bomb up, as I conduct, this is Ang' furry, huh
I made berry, the whole league in Jones Beach
And bake berry, the H jerry's is so sweet
So brief, aim's gone, in the building
O.G.'s ain't honor the brilliant, except for the minds
That push the breathe, for the best to colide
Better yet, I put the X in define
Never fret, when it's beef, I put the pep' in the nine
From your brain to my watch, you be ahead of my time
Aim/shift, your brain wrist, the gate aimed to lift
The game will keep going because Angelous exists, bitch

We in hoods like the jam in '86, hello
You know what that means? Ya'll the rap queen

And after this there won't be no more
You dudes, is full of hype, that's what TV's for
So, get it through your head, or the nine'll leave, eight holes in your head
Think I'm playing, nigga? I have my peeps pop out my the van
And you lookin like, a soldier out of Pakistan
Ask them dudes on this track, they'll tell you Cash the man
Whatever he doing, trust me, I know I can

Hustle hard, nigga, we get you, whatever drugs
Bet you none of ya'll seen, machine guns rattle
So I let off, and let you feel the heat off the barrel
My dogs rocked up, and got you when you hit the gravel
Been a hard hitter, before the Mets signed Darryl
I'm your reaper, when I blast the street sweeper
You bitch niggaz'll crack up like cheap sneakers

Rest assured, we getting festive in Miami now

Getting Johnny Cash old white folks know me now
Standing close to the mic like I'm Kobe now
We celebrate the (?), they hate because we got love
It's the pop life, a lot of faces pop up
Known to tear the club and the block up
Going through the airport with more lie than an opera
Knew crooks who move books like Harry Potter
Get cleaners to get it cleaner
A legend like John, Lennon, I'm a dreamer
Tried to fuck the world she only let me finger
Mind trips to Medina to visit the redeemer
A hero, I'll drop out like Hiroshima
Off sangria with two broads at La Esquina
Still opening Rose for (?)
I'm a dreamer

It's for the world world world world world
Dream on

We take, uh, we make, uh, paper
And build skyscrapers
Walking on water, building my faith up
Niggas with no heart, I'm the pace maker
Get the beat from No I, feel the pulse of the Chi
Survival of the fit with hope in they eye
Taking notes from the sky to fly above understanding
They notes from the most high, so I gotta land them
Career ain't random, make anthems, streets chant them
Rock roles like a phantom
Mad hoes like they throwing tantrums
I tell them I need space like Richard Branson
Dancing, with (?) and stars getting full at bars
And then pass out like a pamphlet
Never taking Grants for granted
It's Common, I'm high above standard
Fly nigga, keep my feet planted
To rock the planet, I don't stop for panic
Maybe I'm a hopeless hip-hop romantic
I'm a dreamer

It's for the world world world world world
Dream on

He introduced me, I stepped to the podium
Said peace, gave thanks to the holy one
Put my water up, thought about my daughter for a second
The youth, the living resurrection
Reflections of the sun glaring through the window
Now the audience staring at my mental
Feeling like the world, the world is at my fingers
'Bout to speak to an auditorium full of dreamers
Kinda took me back to when I first had a dream
To be like the king that sang Billie Jean
Now it's gold records, and I'm on silver screens
At the mountaintop, you still gotta dream
To the dreamers

If I dream you're here
And you dream I'm there
We'll be no where near
You should just come here
If I wake you up
Only difference is
You can live the dream
Just believe in it",The Dreamer,2011

Une sorte de greluche
Teint plâtre et robe sang
Entrouvre la peluche
D’un rideau de beuglant
L’auditoire s’explose
C’est enfin le moment
Où la divine chose
Va cracher son talent

Refrain :
Vas-y vas-y, chante, beuglante, vas-y chante

En effet elle entame
En entrant dans l’arène
Un affolant ramdam
En pur polystyrène
Sa voix rauque ou suave
Revue et corrigée
Se contorsionne et bave
Sur le client pâmé

Elle vomit des mots tocs
Sur des airs comme il faut

En palpant ses lolos
L’atmosphère très hot
Monte de vingt degrés
Quand elle saisit les notes 
Perchées comme un trophée

Tired moments into pleasure.
Say the word and we'll be
Well upon our way.

Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine

And maybe if the melody's just right
I hope tonight it will find you
It will remind you

But what's holding me back is the thought of time we never had
My world's hanging by three words that I can't bear to say

When you hear this chorus
Do you miss the way the world was spinning for us?
Do you hurt the way that I do?
After all this time you leave me broken
This song is every word I left unspoken
When you hear this, girl, I'm hoping that you'll think of us
That you'll think of us

Baby, I told myself that I'll be fine but it's a lie
I don't wanna talk about it
Memories, oh they cut like knives
Deep inside I'm falling
Baby, catch me if you can

What's holding me back is the thought of time we never had
My world's hanging by three words that I can't bear to say

Do you miss the way the world was spinning for us?

Mayday Parade,"I look back to the one and only summer time
And my girl was the envy of every friend of mine
She slept safely in my arms
We were so young and invincible

Closed lips, she was never one to kiss and tell
Those trips in the summer never went so well
Young love was such dumb love
Call it what you want it was still enough

And you're still out of my reach
And you're still all of the things
That I want in my life
How could I ask you to leave me?

And we were just kids in love
The summer was full of mistakes we wouldn't learn from
The first kiss stole the breath from my lips
Why did the last one tear us apart?

Our breath smelled of cigarettes and alcohol
We'd walk down the beach counting every star
Our hearts beat inside our chest
Leaving us gasping for every breath

Her smile with the wind blowing through her hair
Was so contagious in the air
So satisfying and I'm still smiling

And you're still out of my reach
And you're still all of the things
That I want in my life
How could I ask you to leave me?


And we were just kids in love
The summer was full of mistakes we wouldn't learn from
The first kiss stole the breath from my lips
Why did the last one tear us apart

We're falling down, can we pick up the pieces?
We're at an all time low, how do we get it back?
We're falling down, can we pick up the pieces?

We're falling down, can we pick up the pieces now?

And we were just kids in love
The summer was full of mistakes we wouldn't learn from
The first kiss stole the breath from my lips
Why did the last one tear us

We were just kids in love
The summer was full of mistakes we wouldn't learn from
The first kiss stole the breath from my lips
Why did the last one tear us apart?

Lost in everything she trusts,

You said you'd never, ever play, to crowds

It's Murs, 9th Wonder
Murs 3:16, the 9th Edition
Shut your fat mouth, and listen

[Verse 1]
Anticipation got the deck stacked against me since the outset
9th got 'em fiending for an instrumental version of an album that ain't out yet
But now it's my outlet, and it feels so good to them punk fans
When I'm still so hood, so good it's ridiculous, still iniculous
That means three times doper than your favorite mc riding round with a chauffeur
These niggas need Jesus, fuck it, niggas need Oprah
All this killing and this pimping and these foul ways of living
See, everyone's forgetting that the struggle's not over
I got sober, then got drunk again
Got my boy from Carolina, picked up the pen
Threw my nuts on the finish line, I +cum+ to win
While you nothin' to lose, I'll shake you out your shoes
with ease, with moves parallel to those and other three
Couldn't wait for George to make the new Star Wars scene
So I made my own episode 3:16
To answer all the rumors that been shooting through your group
Yes 9th really does make these beats on Fruity Loops
But what does that matter?, this is more than music
By buying this disc you have bought into a movement
Not a revolutionary, nothing but the truth I carry
change if you want to change, that karma is for you to carry
All I'm trying to do is lighten your load
So in between I'm getting faded, some of y'all getting blowed
But I couldn't fall off and lose sight of my goals
So I got sober, got drunk again

Well Hello love
If you been wondering to why we ain't been talking it's been minutes but I'd love
Just to let you know that nobody is fucking with ya you were like a drug
Fuck the silly shit I just wanna get rid of it and get into an ummn
I don't really know how to say this without being offensive
I'mma kill being apprehensive
And grab your senses with a bag of tensions
My bad for mentioning the rash intentions
But I gotta let you ask your questions
I don't really know why it's been so long, what the fuck went wrong
It was something strong we  Should bury the 
hatchet and just marry the racket and let the bygones just be bygones
Wrong is nothing but a state of mind
I see your girls talk shit but they the hating kind
Fake and blind it's safe to relay that I'm another 
mother fucker they just wanna take in time
Come around and get that old thing back I'll be 
happy to make ya smile like the cole king nat
Never letting ya get through me like a cul-de-sac

Fell in lust with the madness
You're the Goose to my Maverick
Had to lock it down quick
Had to get rid of the cheap magic tricks
I was a hustler, you were opposite
Rock with this, let me get this off my chest
Gotta clean this mess, add bleach to the stress
Maybe I'm crazy, but we the best
Find me no less, in a tiny dress
Knife in the purse, Glock in the bed
Still fell for a young knucklehead
Probably is blessed, so I make a fresh attempt
Let me turn it up once again
(Word) Let me burn it up at both ends
(Yeah) Let me get it close with my lens
(Woo) Let me try to heighten all sense
With no test, no game, I ain't tryna play offense
I'm a new man, brand new me
Look like money, but to you, I'm free
But I'm dodging reality, can't you see?
So let's try to live a fantasy

Hurt like Percy Harvin for it
Got a full beard like James Harden for it
Tickle lil’ bit when you ride my face
Kiss a lil’ bit say you like the taste
Been a lil’ while since I seen your face
Like it wasn’t no good but that ain’t the case
Say you mad at me (Why you mad?)
Like you don’t miss miss me

Lame ass fuck nigga saying he ain't feeling me
That shit just made me stronger
So keep on shooting bitch you ain't killing me
I still wake up worried like fuck it
Any minute everything could come crashing
And it's back to them bullshit 9 to 5s
And them niggas behind your back laughing
Like, where the fuck did I go wrong
Fight suicide thoughts like hold on
I don't ever wanna go back when I felt insecure
And so low y'all, I went so strong
Too much pain I need an oxicodone
Left for dead in the corner, no coat on
Brain was so gone, that was so long
Couldn't get a break no Turbo Ozone
Same old slow song we out there too
Some die young, didn't get a chance to
Live their dreams, just a bullet from a 9 millimeter
Going in your head like shampoo
Get going, still fight the same for you
Don't let this fear paralyze and keep holding you
One day you wake up today through shit
Tomorrow these unloyal fucks will get over ya
Live great for my kid's sake
Spit pain over mixtapes
And you find out who your real friend
Cause when shit gets tough and them niggas turn away then that shit's fake
Last year I had to shed a few tears
Lost a good friend, had to pour a few beers
Why when everything goes right
Niggas find a way to fuck it up, still waking up with new fears

And every time you hear me I'm trying just to wind the clock back and keep my 15 minutes of fame
Knowing every second that the clock ticks a million other people trying to take my spot and get in the game
This is all I've ever wanted and it's all I know so I gotta hold on
I gotta do it for my family, I can't let them down, I'm so afraid to fail, but they think I'm so strong

And I don't know why I'm so afraid

Break down when the clock stops
Hot on the downhill movement
What the mother fuck have I been doin
Everybody got their own illusion
Stop watch as my life fades
Hopscotch and run tyrades
Till the lock pops and I fly straight
I'ma stock shots and run sideways
I'm made in the ice age
Don't cross blades on an off day
Cause I rock stages, not cosplay
These fake fucks are off broadway
Stock shades on my face of course
Time melts into the base [?]
To the great divorce and I pray for more
Than just a countdown faster than [?] was

Why these bitches standing in line for their new phones
I'm scheming and plotting and working my objects and learning my new wrongs
Repping the fam and cooking the ham we hotter than two songs
They know who I am but the fans that'll have me on record broke out of the group homes
With some new [?] in Miami the Cadillac's two toned
No time to be wasting, my homies are famous
We never look back, we been too [?]
The music is strange and the singers are dangerous
I'll never grow old and the clock will be painted
I'm feeling immortal and popping like Orville

The Cyclops, X-Men, for you dumber kids
I read them funny books, they got the pictures in them
Still pull the thickest chick in the sickest denim
Then I spit this venom, like Eddie Brock does
Had the crowd raising eyebrows like The Rock does
Blood, Cuhs, it's all in the same gang
Just brothers in different colors, we need to change things
And this is Strange gang, talking 'bout my chain again
Mine's fine, I got it shined by my Asian friend
At the swap meet in the wrong hood
I'm the bad member but still make the song good

Gun is out, everybody running out
Hearing people scream and shout (""OH MY GOD HE'S GOT A GUN!!"")
'Cause they run their mouth, 
they throwing this tongue about like having some candy clout (It's negros, we better run)
He'on't want (he'ont want it)
He'on't need it (he'on't need it)

I’ve been planning the great escape
Somebody come pick me up at a quarter to 8
Come and take me away
Need a minute to get me straight
Been working up in the lab on an order for Mr. Yates
Been goin' insane
Lucid dreaming while I’m awake
My head in a daze
Now I start to hallucinate
Just practice up in the whip and let's hit up the fucking mall
And light up a couple spliffs 'til it’s thick as a fucking fog
Just right up and down the strip playing Mayday 'til it’s dawn
And hit up a couple chicks, throw a party back at the home
Whatever yo, I don’t care, I need something to get me right

At the end of the evening
I can tell that you're feelin'
Like you don't want it to be
It's getting late
And we're here at your doorstep
But you feel you don't know yet
If you can go there with me

Something's going on inside of you
(You don't know what to do)
This much I can tell

So here we are
And the tension is building
Your defenses are wilting
As every moment goes by
I don't wanna wait
No, and it's not how we planned it
But you can't finally stand it
We oughta give it a try

Something's going on inside of you

I'm hooked ridin' back on you

You never talk to me

I went down to your favorite department store

Swimsuit girls at the pool, beach
Legs in the water get the sand off her feet
In town from L.A., So cold in the D
Went to school in Atlanta, in Chicago for the week
Friends and their friends can get in SWAT team
Hot things, hot dames, sunbathe, brastrings
Hotel beach babes man, I lost both keys
? Chuck's? room 313
And it's boomin' scooters, ATVs
Out in the white parasail, jet skis
Watching sexy little spicy mamacitas I see ya
Cash bar only, no need for the Visas
A lot of girls walk around here in bikinis
Ay, yeah we do this all day
Hot tub on the boat, rolling joints by the lake
Ay, tell her bring the papers
Twist up the Grape Ape
Down there, from here put your hands in the air
Yeah it's our year great view up here?
And it's looking like I might wanna move around here

Hey! I see you flashing me your taillights
Babe, we can do anything you feel like
No need to contemplate, put on your swimsuit
You know I want to babe
To take a swim with you

Two straws is pokin' out the coconut, I gave her a sip
Showboating, now I'm all in the mix
Only toasting purp weed. Degrees in the high 80's
'Fore I even said ""Hi ladies""
Said I seen you on Collins, The car you was driving
The lights turned on like eyelids
Then the light turned green
And a scene from Ice Cream Man popped up into my head
When P had the white Lexus, Silkk had the headband
You and your man's looked like them
Right then my right hand reached my cell phone
And I needed her right name to type in
First name, Mike man, write on the white sand
That's where you can find me
I be in the Bahamas
Your girl wanna chill and I drill when I wanna
The real on the real nigga, keep it a hundo
With a Cubano finna Mambo
You see the trunk from the front like Dumbo
Good drinks, good view from the condo
Say that ain't a good combo?

And you'll be mine 

I shoulda told you you're the only one for me 
How could I ever be so blind 
I should have never let you find another guy 
There'll never be another time for you and me 
I should've held on to you tight 
Now we'll forever be ships passing in the night

Pour up another shot of Hennessy my tendency to start the party with
Probably hit that Bob Marley I ain't with that Molly shit
Represent my nigga bang your hood
Bloods and Crips in the same building it’s all good
I’m looking at this pretty fine thing rolling with her friend
Hoping I can make her mind change jump inside my Benz
Let me get it crackin’
Conversation turn to plenty sexual frustration
Fuck-faces lookin’ at her hard to not to be impatient
O really though
You Drink?
You Smoke?
Get a case
Get a 1/8
Fly high not coach
G5 sit back
I’ll drive let me know
On the couch
On the bed
On the floor
Say go
Say when
In the wind we go
We toast to the game
No games
We both really grown
I’m sayin’ you playin’
I mean I dance
To my own beat to the beat now flip your hands and
Let the smoke burn
Lets the smoke burn in your vein
When it’s your turn hit it twice then say my name
Say my name say my name
Mind game like Candyman
Dark chocolate vanilla
I tell you this is Candy Land
This is candid camera there’s no pauses allowed
They don’t understand us because we wont turn it down
Middle fingers in the air
This is truth and double dare
300 drunk muthafuckas in the holding cell

Whoa

Mayer Hawthorne,"Friday night at the scene is bright at Avalon
Walked straight to the bar in her party dress, yes
Told the bartender pour her a shot
And make it strong
Because she needed cheering up
She proceeded to get drunk
You could see it tearing up in her eyes

But when she gets home, she puts her headphones on
She plays her favorite song and fades away
And when the musics on she can do no wrong
And she feels safe and calm and it's okay
And she says, ba ba dum ba dee ah dum ba
Ba ba dum ba dee ah dum ba
The world keeps turning, life goes on
Yeah she says, ba ba dum ba dee ah dum ba
Ba ba dum ba dee ah dum ba
The world keeps turning, life goes on

Night before had a date with a boy from Highland Park
Said he'd meet her at the diner at nine o'clock
Leather boots, eyeliner laid on extra dark
She got a table set for two
But he never made it through
And she tried to play it cool, as she cried

But when she gets home, she puts her headphones on
She plays her favorite song and fades away
And when the musics on she can do no wrong
And she feels safe and calm and it's okay
And she says, ba ba dum ba dee ah dum ba

Mayfair D.O.,"In tropical climes there are certain times of day
When all the citizens retire
To tear their clothes off and perspire
It's one of those rules that the greatest fools obey
Because the sun is much too sultry
And one must avoid its ultra violet ray

The native grieve when the white 
Men leave their huts, because
They're obviously definitely nuts!
 
Mad dogs and Englishmen
Go out in the midday sun
The Japanese don't care to
The Chinese wouldn't dare to
Hindoos and Argentines sleep 
Firmly from twelve to one
But Englishmen detest a siesta
In the Philippines
There are lovely screens

To protect you from the glare
In the Malay States
There are hats like plates
Which the Britishers won't wear
At twelve noon the natives swoon
And no further work is done
But mad dogs and Englishmen
Go out in the midday sun
 
It's such a surprise for the Eastern eyes to see
That though the English are effete
They're quite impervious to heat
When the white man rides every native hides in glee
Because the simple creatures hope he
Will impale his solar topee on a tree

Habaninny habaninny habaninny haa

When the English claim
The earth that they give rise to 
Such hilarity and mirth

Mad dogs and Englishmen
Go out in the midday sun.
The toughest Burmese bandit
Can never understand it
In Rangoon the heat of noon
Is just what the natives shun
They put their Scotch or Rye down
And lie down in a jungle town

Where the sun beats down
To the rage of man and beast
The English garb
Of the English sahib
Merely gets a bit more creased
In Bangkok
At twelve o'clock
They foam at the mouth and run
Slut mad dogs and Englishmen
Go out in the midday sun
 
Mad dogs and Englishmen
Go out in the midday sun.
The smallest Malay rabbit
Deplores this stupid habit in Hongkong
They strike a gong and
Fire off a noonday gun
To reprimand each inmate
Who's in late

In the mangrove swamps
Where the python romps
There is peace from twelve till two
Even caribous
Lie around and snooze
For there's nothing else 
To do in Bengal to move 
At all is seldom, if ever done
But mad dogs and Englishmen
Go out in the midday sun",Mad Dogs and Englishmen,1999

Maynard Ferguson,"Once I was a sentimental thing
Throw my heart away each Spring
Now a Spring romance
Hasn't got a chance
Promised my first dance to Winter
All I've got to show's a splinter
For my little fling

Spring, this year has got me feeling like a horse
That never left the post
I lay in my room
Starring up at the ceiling
Spring can really hang you up the most

Morning kiss wakes trees and flower
And to them my life
To drink a toast I walk in the park
Just to kill those lonely hours
Spring can really hang you up the most

All afternoon
Those birds tweet-a-tweet I know their tune
This is love this is it
Heard it before
And I know the score
And I decide that love is a bore

Now it's April

Love is just a ghost

There's no mistaken
Robins build their nest from coast to coast
My heart tries the same
So they won't hear it breaking

Tender passion there it grows
But I'm on the shelf with last years easter bonnet

Love came my way
I'm holding the last
We had our day
Now that's all in the past
Spring came along
A season of song
For love's sweet promise
But something went wrong
Doctor's once prescribed a tonic
Sulfur and molasses was the dose
Didn't help me a bit
My condition must be chronic

For snow to hide the clover

For to tell you the truth
I've had quite a day too

Guess who I saw today, my dear?
I went in town to shop around for something new
And thought I'd stop and have a bite
When I was through

I looked around for someplace near
And it occurred to me where I had parked the car
There was a most attractive French cafe and bar
It really wasn't very far

The waiter showed me to a dark, secluded corner
And as my eyes became accustomed to the gloom
I saw two people at the bar who were so in love
That even I could spot it clear across the room

Maynard Ferguson,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,1993
Maynard Ferguson,"She was too good to me
How can I get along now?
So close she stood to me
Everything seems all wrong now
She would have brought me the sun
Making me smile, that was her fun

If I was mean to her
She'd never say go away now
I was a king to her
Who's gonna light my way now?
It's only natural I'm so blue
She was too good to be true

Maynard Ferguson,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Maynard Ferguson,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love,1996
Maynard Ferguson,"Dream beside me in the midnight glow, the lamp Is low
Dream and watch the shadows came and go, the lamp Is low
While you linger in my arms, my lips will sigh ""I love you so""

Tonight the moon is high, the lamp Is low

Maynard Ferguson,"Love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing
But night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

I intend to be independently blue
I want your love but I don't want to borrow
I have it today and give back tomorrow
For my love is your love but there's no love for nobody else",Love Me or Leave Me,1996
Maynard Ferguson,"We were so in love the day love started
Who would think that we would soon be parted
I just can't believe it's true
I make this appeal to you

Can't we talk it over, 
Let's talk it over
Before you tell me you're through
Can't we sit together
And figure whether
This is the right thing to do

I hate the thought of spending nights all alone
Missing the thrill of nights that we've known

Can't we talk it over
Before it's over
Before you whisper
Goodbye for ever
Let's talk it over dear.

Maynard Ferguson,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again
Seems like pretending it isn't the ending
Two friends drifting apart
Two friends, but one broken heart
We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died",Just Friends,1998
Maynard Ferguson,"Midnight, you heavy laden, it's midnight
Come on and trade in your old dreams for new
Your new dreams for old
I know where they're bought
I know where they're sold
Midnight, you've got to get there at midnight
And you'll be met there by others like you
Brothers as blue
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
 
Midnight, look at the steeple, it's midnight
Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near
Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
Things will be brighter the moment you find
More of your kind
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams

Maynard Ferguson,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Seem to be happening again

Maynard Ferguson,"I knew the time had to come
When I'd be held under your thumb
I'm like a pawn in your hand
Moved and compelled, at your command
Whether it's for bad or for good
I would never change it if I could

Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I'm weak, maybe I'm strong
But nevertheless I'm in love with you
Maybe I'll win, maybe I'll lose
And maybe I'm in for crying the blues
But nevertheless I'm in love with you

Somehow, I know at a glance, the terrible chances I'm taking
Fine at the start, then left with a heart that is breaking

Maybe I'll live a life of regret, 
And maybe I'll give much more than I get
But nevertheless, I'm in love with you

In spite of all I could do
I went ahead falling for you
So if I laugh or I cry
I made my bed, that's where I'll lie

I put my own head in the noose",Nevertheless I'm in Love With You,2001

On gossamer wings

If we'd thought a bit of the end of it
When we started painting the town
We'd have been aware that our love affair
Was too hot, not to cool down

The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend

I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,2006

Mayol,"Un Espagnol sévère
D'une ouvrière,
Au Moulin d' la Galette
Fit la conquête
Il dit à sa compagne
Comme en Espagne :
Je m'en vais vous montrer
Un pas à la mod' qui va vous charmer
Amoureusement
Laissez-vous conduir' gentiment.

REFRAIN
C'est la danse nouvelle,
Mademoiselle,
Ainsi qu'une Espagnole
Lascive et folle
Il faut cambrer la taille
D'un air canaille
Cett' dans' qui nous aguiche
C'est la Mattchiche !...

ad lib :
Allons douc'ment...
Ne pressons pas l' mouv'ment
C'est palpitant
Et ça dur' plus longtemps...

Chez lui, son amoureuse,
Très langoureuse,
Par la danse charmée
Semblait pâmée...
Je lui dis : ma mignonne,
A Barcelone
Ca se danse en corset
Pour que les oranges soient toujours au frais
C'est bien plus joli ;
Car les yeux aussi sont ravis...

REFRAIN
Otez votre dentelle,
Mademoiselle,
De vos nichons qui pointent
J'admir' les pointes.
Sous votre jupe blanche
Jaillit la hanche.
J'vois qu'il n'y'a rien d' postiche,
Viv' la Mattchiche !...

ad lib :
Beaux nichonox!
Superbes grenados
Quel déliros
J'en ai des frissons!

Adorant qu'on la frôle,
S' sentant tout drôle,
La jolie Montmartroise
D'humeur grivoise
Se faisant plus câline,
Tendre et féline,
Dit à son hidalgo :
Je suis fatiguée, allons au dodo...
Ils s' réveillèrent en ch'mis' de nuit.

REFRAIN
Puis, redoublant de zèle,
La demoiselle
Dit : cett' danse est un rêve,
Faut que j' me lève...
Elle est bien plus exquise
Quand, en chemise,
On saut' comme une biche...
Viv' la Mattchiche !...

ad lib :
O mon trésor!
Ma petit' gueule en or...
Encor! encor!
Je t'en prie serr' moi fort.

Les amants s'adorèrent,
Puis s'épousèrent.
Tout' la Butte sacrée
Fut invitée...
La Mattchich' fut d' la fête.
Chaqu' midinette
Avait pour cavalier
Un jeune Espagnol pour la fair' danser
Et tous murmuraient
Voyant les coupl's qui s'enlaçaient

REFRAIN
Il n'y a plus d' Pyrénées
D'puis c't' hyménée !
Mais y a d'jolies montagnes
Comme en Espagne...
Car les poitrines rondes,
Les croupes blondes
Bondissent de leurs niches
Pour la Mattchiche !...

ad lib :
Tout doux, tout doux!
Agitant vos frous frous
Tortillez-vous!...
Sous les yeux andaloux!...

Depuis lors, les p'tit's femm's
Chaqu' soir se pâment
Pour cett' danse espagnole
Qui les rend folles.
La Mattchiche prenante
Et délirante
Maintenant fait fureur
Et mieux qu' le cake-walk met l'amour au coeur
Dit's à vos amants
De vous la montrer rapid'ment

REFRAIN
C'est la danse nouvelle,
Mesdemoiselles,
Dans les bras d'un homme tendre
Il faut l'apprendre
J' vous souhait' jusqu'à l'aurore
D' danser encore
Cett' dans' qui nous aguiche
Viv' la Mattchiche !...

ad lib :
Tout doucement
Sans presser le mouv'ment
Ce s'ra charmant
Car l'amour vous attend!",La Mattchiche,1996
Mayol,"1ERE VERSION :

Autrefois, ma cousine Hortense
Arrivait de temps en temps chez mes parents ;
Ell' venait passer ses vacances 
Dans notre petit' maison près de Toulon.
C'était dans l'programme quand nous recevions le télégramme,
Le bonheur dans l'âme, à la gar' je courais comme un fou
Mais le train arrivait tout à coup.
En la voyant je criais : Zou !...

Cousine, cousine,
T'es fraîch' comme une praline,
Cousine, cousine ,
Coquin de sort, qué bonn' mine !

(Parlé) Et qué bonne mine tu as cousine ça fait plaisir à voir
(parlé)t'as bien dormi dans le train hé j'espère que tu avais un coin au moins hum ?...

Cousine, cousine,
Embrasse ton cousin germain !

Le matin courant vers la grève,
Pour nous baigner tous deux dans les flots bleus,
On s'déshabillait quel beau rêve
Sous l'ombrage hospitalier des oliviers.
Rouge comme une cerise,elle me cachait sa gorge exquise,
En ramenant sa chemise,
Mais comme y'avait de la dentelle partout
Souvent, je voyais par un trou un sein qui montrait son petit bout.

Oh Cousine, oh cousine,
Qu'est-c' que j'vois sur ta poitrine ?
Cousine, cousine,
On dirait deux mandarines...
Hé hé t' as les mandarines, peuchère,
mais ne crois surtout pas que j'exagère hum 
Cousine, cousine,
C'est moi qui ai le pépin !

Ell' m'écrivit l'autre année :
"" Cher cousin, je n'viendrai pas, excuse moi
Depuis huit jours, je suis mariée,
Et pour plaire à mon mari J'reste à Paris. ""
La méchante lettre en moi quel chagrin elle fit naître !
Du fond de mon être monta comme un frisson de rancoeur ;
J'interrogeai dans ma douleur
Les arbres, la grève, les fleurs.

Cousine, cousine,
Si gentille, si câline,
Cousine, cousine,
C'est mon coeur qu'elle piétine.

(parlé) Je rêvais de l'épouser au printemps,
Et moi je suis là comme un fada té j'attends...

That I can be the girl of your dreams

Oh, you know you can understand why
I love the way your mind thinks
It's because we're incredibly in synch

Simpatico
Suddenly as lovely as your eyes, there's no surprise
You simply mesmerize me
Simpatico
(the) heavens above they've truly shine upon your face
We're, we're in simpatico
We're in simpatico


You're as fine as fine can be
Your touch, it sets me free
I think I'll stick around
Your love just seems to be the best I've ever found

Oh, I know you can understand why
You love the way my mind thinks
It's because we're incredibly in synch

Suddenly as lovely as your eyes, there's no surprise
You simply mesmerize me

Maywood,"This is my alphabet.
Because time goes on
and things are changing in my world
here is a new alphabet
for the children of my generation.
Of course all these words have a meaning for me
but other generations might find a different mood to their world.

My alphabet goes like this:

A stands for anything
and B for bionic and Bach
C stands for claustrophobia
and D for dirty old man
E stands for everyone
F is full frontal and friends
G of course, stands for getting a divorce
H now stands for hijacking
and I for a king size ego

J now stands for jukebox and junkies
K is for those who kiss and tell
and leading lady stars with L
Naturally M is for me
and N is for never again
O is for that famous story, mmm
and P for pain and poverty
Q stands for quality which is better than quantity
R stands for rock and roll fan
S is sexy and sad
T drives them totally mad
and U are everything to me
V stands for little voodoo
and W for where and when
X sounds extremely mysterious
Y is a question I keep asking
and Z dear child, for the zero you will get if you don't learn my alphabet.",Alphabet (Prelude in C by J.S. Bach),1977

Seems the things that turn you on turn you around

I shot a nigga did a bid nigga all of that
So now I kick back and get paid for raw rap
Nigga 'Pone ain't home not yet (not yet?)
Yo it don't matter 'cause we's all on the same set
Me and ??? kick it on the here and there
The really head to tough but the love is there
My pops died on July 3rd, '98
So now a nigga need mad herb
'cause my pops is here yo he loved his son
Matter of fact my pops the one that showed me a gun
And said Popi, you gotta protect ya moms
Even if that means that you gotta strap up arms
He used to make me hit the punching bag
My dad, he was a boxer god
And he really was glad yo the boxing the golden glove
He just a thug and I love him yo
So I'ma spread that love

I cock and pop 3 in the air for my niggas not here
Locked it wit me, your legacy live on with me continuously
Tremendously I blow weed deep in my memory
You still breathe, your face show through your seeds
And who know it that you go so quick
We all felt hopeless, through blunt smoke
My pen spittin and I show this
I swore an oath you would notice
I go to lengths with my rap strengths
When I think about my past friends K-Rock and D-zo
Primo from the same block as me since we was shorties
The pain and project glory
I get touched it all absorb me like a weed head rush
Keepin the thorough for my passed he-ro, I must
All my peoples street and physical
I still see you featured in my heart sometimes it might wrinkle
Much drinkin when I'm thinkin, its like I feel a hush over the skies
Touched by dead guys speakin

Hit-Hard Todd and Smiley, T-Bone too
And plus, my nigga Raheem, from ?
You know I poured out beer for Fernando too
And I still smoke my bogeys in the rest of the crew
Yo ain't nothin changed still play ball the same
I like to cheat a little bit just to run in my game
But y'all niggas ain't here, can't believe this shit
Thought you'd always be here, though we'd always be clique!
But y'all niggas not here no more, it ain't fair no more

But I maintain still holdin' in the pain

I got the left arm, stay in the game like Montan' 
My thug charm is everywhere now, dot com 
Hear me anytime, you can access it 
W dot Nore, yo, suck my dick 
Peep me with Akinyele, yo, fuckin for free 
On some thug shit, my thugs stay fuckin with me 
What! 

Yo, every battle 
Nigga I got your gat, so let me splatter 
Into smithereens 
Throw some bullets in his jeans 
Another thug story, I bust my gun for Nore 
Snap a nigga neck, now the law lookin for me 
I'm thugged out, bugged out, blow your fucking mug out 
No di-doubt, I see you can't eat what you dish out 
Watch, I reach in your soul, nigga and pull the bitch out 
Watch my tech rise, feel the shells that it spit out 
I'm warning you, send twenty niggaz deep to corner you 
Dressed in black 
From Brook' to I-raq 
Blastin Mack 10's, I be killin ya Benz 
Live coverage at ten, on CNN

What,what!","The Assignment [feat. Busta Rhymes, Spliff Star and Maze]",1998
Maze,"It was four in the mornin' got a call on the cell 
What the hell you niggaz just shot at? 
Yo they missed her blazed most fired pistols 
Now it's our turn to play calypsos 
Yo me and you meet me by the two 
A war goin' on that's involvin' the crews 
Bring both your arms Rel and Moose down in St. John's 
I wish my nigga was home the black Fonz 
Yo we rock charms as big as Vegas 
Different crews of different size try to player hate us 
Top of the league like Bulls and y'all cats is Lakers 
Trash since Magic left, but he was the greatest 
Aiyyo we call Shan, yo Shan peace God 
You and Maze got the info? 
Them cats that tried to shoot Moose's hitmen yo? 
A nigga named Ricky, from the Bronx, cold wop city 
Thugged out, shoot his gat mad sickly 
I laid low, called Big Pun and Fat Joe 
Them niggaz my click, we three amigos -- they said 
that they knew the cat, exactly where he live at 
And when I get there, just blaze God and don't look back 
Cause Ricky got no kids and no wifey 
So when I get there God it's like more than likely 
There's Ricky like Ricardo, plus Renaldo 
So when I get there, take the coat, plus the cargo, what? 
 
We strong-arm, blazin firearm long kong 
When the beef come niggaz storm on 

We strong-arm, blazin firearm long kong 
When the beef come niggaz storm on 

Yo like a day pass, I'm bandana'd up with a mask 
Just shot up the whole spot, crib to grass 
Pissed in his toilet, on his walls, in his halls 
Cut Ricky from his neck to his balls 
Anyone can bust a gun and stab a nigga is real 
Cause you gotta have the guts for the way that it feels 
Word got back, them niggaz said Ricky a rat 
All that, coke we took yea we cooked the crack 
The police don't really want us, they want the coke back 
It's impossible, just ask the word by the hospital 
Across from the mall right in Hoffman Park 
It's in tennis bags, guarded by a hundred Iraqs 
Yo we swerve low, beside the Jake, there go, Roberto 
The brother of Ricky, he 'posed to be wild, it's gettin deep 
How he knew where I'm at, how he knew how I eat? 
The fools pulled out, no doubt, Roberto grabbed the sick ? 
We hit the spot, then we hopped in the whips 
Now it's a chase on the highway, the L-I-E's 
Yo them fools ?, niggaz drive by me 
Iraq banner, not he, ? aqui 

We strong-arm, blazin firearm long kong 
When the beef come niggaz storm on 

Aiyyo we just crashed into the pole, now we roll 
another Dutchie, calm down and stroll 
on foot, my whole click, got control 
of the whole output, now we roll 
Yo any nigga be a man for a minute why'know 
Then he, turn around once he know you got dough 
It's like a cycle, that read psycho, man in the mirror 
like Michael, my whole click down to snipe you 
Since then, Roberto had beef, with melanin men 
Every nigga he hate, was darker than him 
Older niggaz than him, stay buggin on him 
Tellin him he weak, he ain't touch my skin 
But once again CNN prevail, tho-rough 
Cause even the G-est don't really understand Hell 
I did this, from Iraq, to livin the cell 
So y'all niggaz know, what? Meet you back in Hell what?
