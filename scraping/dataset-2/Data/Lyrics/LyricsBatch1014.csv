Ski Beatz,"And I, and I, need to be with you tonight
Tell a broad get with me at the speed of light
Neo-soul flow, Jill-Scott overload
Tour bus, fifty cities, meet me on the road
PYT count max, on overload
Gorgeous girls all around, don't overdose
I need a real girlfriend, baby hope you know
We can make love all night, in slow mo'
You don't even know
Take it back to the hip hop Summer nights
Tribe Called Quest, MC Lyte
Put me on the mic
For the love of my heart, you could break-dance in the park
Need a b-girl with a killer arch
Play the lead role in my life, such a killer part
And if we ever grow apart, which is never
Cause' forever we will have hip hop
So let's rock

Hip hop and love
I remember the first time we hooked up
Can't remember the last time we broke up
Hip hop and love
I remember the first time we hooked up
Can't remember the last time we broke up

She the one, to my two-step
Perfect sixteen, that I ain't get to do yet
New J's, no hoody just a crew-neck
Then I got with you, when I knew that I was too fresh
She swag me the hell out
Knew Public Enemy ain't ever gonna' sell out
Cause what we got is priceless
Mary J, real love Spike couldn't write this
Watching brown sugar with the lights off
Used to sleep over on your nights off
Used to call me your sugar bear
Listening to 2Pac, you would let me pull your hair
Throwing that D'Angelo and slow up
The type of love to make a b-boy grow up
You know the type of love that never stops
So put this ring on your finger, baby girl, and let's rock

Hip hop and love
I remember the first time we hooked up
Can't remember the last time we broke up
Hip hop and love
I remember the first time we hooked up
Can't remember the last time we broke up

Used to listen to the Fugees The Score
Nowadays we don't talk no more
Before you hooked up with your new thing
We was bumpin' that Wu Tang
Blasting Outkast, and the Roots
Those were our favorite groups
I remember music we would listen to
When I'm reminiscing over you, my god, so let's rock

Hip hop and love
I remember the first time we hooked up
Can't remember the last time we broke up
Hip hop and love
I remember the first time we hooked up
Can't remember the last time we broke up",Hip-Hop & Love,2010
Ski Beatz,"Welcome to my little party in your honor 
The guest list has been compiled so that you go out in style
You don't mind if my friends introduce themselves, do you Leroy? 
Then let the games begin!

Ha! Back up in the booth and my ""V"" is for Vendetta
Fuck the last rhyme, to tell you the truth I got 10 better
I bend letters over 'til they look like ""n's""
And then offend so many men with them, they look like fems
I'm a feminine rebel, forever cleverer than your shit
Never be level with niggas' shit, my flow can float bitch
Figure out the dosage to administer vaccines
Sickness I invoke in close considered the Black Jean
It's Blakroc, it's Blacksmith
Miss Grae and I'm back, bitch
Hulk-smash harass a motherfucker most passionate 
Fashion plate, magistrate
Fascinating lady, grab your Vaseline and masturbate
Emasculate your manhood, possibly damn good
Dismantle all your posse turn them pussy with tan hoods
Don't push me, I don't land good
Liable to fly up off the handle like a pan would
And ""swoosh,"" hit. Mrs. Woods

Salt rivers flowing out my eyeballs
Pierced side, broke legs, bearing my cross
The old heads told me life wasn't a game
But mine steady feeling like pinball, dodgeball
Chasing freedom, establish a kingdom
And build a stone castle out of thinwall, drywall
I'm a keep going 'til God call or the sky fall
Or they blast me on a grassy knoll and try to blame Oswald
Average Joe Blow, mastering my mojo
Cinder block, karate chop
Practice in the dojo (uh)
If it's so-so, I'll probably be a no show
Shootin' the willy bobo out on Nostrand with the po' folks (uh)
Black dragon rap, flames out the nostrils
From Crown Fried to Roscoe's I'm spreading the gospel
I overcame like the Saints done the Falcons
Like Hoover did to Malcolm

Yaowa!
Y'all know what the fuck I do
Bubble gum buster, so easy to fuckin' chew
Lyrics I blow bubbles to
Unoriginal, it's easy to make another you
Finding my telly keys the only way you'll get a W
Niggas ain't grizzly, y'all all soft and huggable
I came up in the gutter, you came up like all the Huxtables
You don't want me to black-belt-to-death you
Karate chop your pops, Liu Kang kick your nephew
Hi yaowa! To hell is where I send 'em
Y'all just learned the art
I been tighter than your denims
I'll ""Ryu"" or ""Ken"" 'em
I'm classic with the pen
Give me five minutes I'll show you I'm deadly with the venom
Poison with the darts
See your boys be in the park
My boy be in the park
Yeah, annoyin' all the narcs
We two different types, see, you spit what you write
What I spit is the truth and truth comes to the light

Bang bang, tobacco roller, smoke show, mofo sensei
Blue cloak, red stripe, get right head shot
Bass bang, necks crane, fresh construction when
Ski percussion, black hour, bad Boogie Man
Brought all my cousins again
Sisters and brothers and 'em
Bey's they center edge, overs and unders of them
Ain't no fuckin' with them
Ain't nan suckers within
Never closed, hella flows
Ice cold, never froze
Me and the exceptionals
Too high to get over on
A blue Jabbar, sittin 'til it's game point
Pick and roll, give and go
No ordinary miracle
Freedom fighters' spiritual
Eagle eye aerials
Sun spot, mountain top
Fresh water fountain drop
Open our dreams
Fresh green, quartz counter top
The ashtray, that 3rd water Kings county rock
Black heed powerhouse
Can't shut the power out
Tell 'em quit wildin' out
Show ya what I'm bout about
Tune in, senator
This how you turn a party out
She get fresh, yes, to help her stretch your body out
Get live and hurricane black don will air your body out
Cash and carry then I'm outty out

And keeping you alive?
An empty shotgun shooting your mouth off
Something's on your mind
The cheap messiah of persecution
Is alive and doing fine

Sometimes crawl, fall, but I stand up cause I'm afraid to sleep
And open my eyes to a new day, with all new problems 4. and all new pain
All the faces are filled with so much anger
Losing our dignity and hope from fear of danger
After all the wars, after settling the scores, at the break of dawn we will be deaf to the answers

There's so much bigotry, misunderstanding and fear
With eyes squinted and fists clinched we reach out for what is dear
We want it we want
We want a reason to live

We're on a pilgrimage
A crusade for hope
'Cause in our hearts and minds and souls we know
We need it we need
We need more than this

Going through this life looking for angels
People passing by looking for angels

Walking down the streets looking for angels
Everyone I meet looking for angels

So many nations with so many hungry people
So many homeless scrounging around for dirty needles
On the rise, teen suicide, when we will realize
We've been desensitized by the lies of the world

We're oppressed and impressed by the greedy
Whose hands squeeze the life out of the needy
When will we learn that wars, threats,
And regrets are the cause and effect of living in fear

Who can help protect the innocence of our children
Stolen on the internet with images they can't forget
We want it we want
We want a reason to live

We represent a generation that wants to turn back a nation
To let love be our light and salvation
We need it we need

We need more than this
I became a savior to some kids I'll never meet
Sent a check in the mail to buy them something to eat
What will you do to make a difference, to make a change?

What will you do to help someone along the way?

Pray for your enemies, humble yourself, love's staring back at me
In the midst of the most painful faces
Angels show up in the strangest of places",Looking for Angels,2006

The older I get
Will I get over it?

I didn't know then it would hurt like this, but I think
The older I get
Maybe I'll get over it
It's been way too long for the times we missed
I can't believe it still hurts like this

The time between
Those cutting words
Built up our defenses never made no sense, it just made me hurt
Do you believe
That time heals all wounds?
It started getting better, but it's easy not to fight when I'm not with you

What was I waiting for?
I should have taken less and given you more
I should have weathered the storm

It hurts but I'm giving you my word
I hope that you're always
Happy like we were

And if you a hater, exit the door
Rap is a set up, just a lot of games
A lot of suckers with colorful names
I'm so and so, I'm this, I'm that

What you think, you sound better with a wife beater and a bandana?

Come on nigga, you know sample tapes don't count
Real quick out the stash, been flippin' at dash
Bruise me with two feet when I'm kicking yo' ass
And you never catch me in the club leaving a skirt
If I don't get brains then the meter get jerk
why'all them fools in the club with a Smedian shirt
Rent a car in your hometown just to see if it work

I wreck shows lovely cause I got nine personalities
I kick the real on ear woundin' tracks

And I don't joke when it's time to go to work
Wack MC's play like Pee Wee Herman and get jerked
In the cypha, Mad Skillz gets hyper
More heads show up, and now the shit's gettin tighter
Huh, I find it hard to breathe, bassline strummin
Money it's gettin hot but the lyrics keep - comin
Feel like I'm trapped inside my mother's womb
Adrenaline's flowin - it's bound to be a battle sound
Peep it - this is our secret garden
Niggaz are representin and nuff heads are noddin
on the corners, without the mics
Inside the clubs, without the spotlight
Packed in tight like we were all doin a bid
Fuck where you're from, it's time to shoot your lyrics kid
Yo flip the script if you're wack time will tell
Aww shit, my man lit up the L
So you go for yours, I'ma go for mine
Rapper after rapper, rhyme after rhyme
Hardcore punchlines and then come the riddles
It's like gettin high when I'm standin in the middle
So freestyle fanatics and you bad-ass writers
Your shit ain't real unless it's real in the cypha, uhh

Minus the static, and some batteries for your radio, cause yo
Skills are vital if you enter
I seen niggaz lose titles just for standin in the, center
Can you feel it?  Can you feel the vibes?
It looks like we beefin to them people walkin, by
The feel is real and ain't nobody fake
So go acapella while my man flips the, tape
I close my eyes and think for a while

Yeah, who's next to flex?  Yeah, you know the deal

Keep shit funky with the funky sensations
So step up kid, c'mon kid step up front
And peep out my man while he's rhymin with the blunt (true)
Some kids bring the funk, some kids bring the dissin
Some kids are just wack (right) but everybody's listenin
Yeah you gotta give respect money when respect is due
Fuck the bullshit - in the cypha, shit is true
The rhymes get spit and the 40's get tapped
Some niggaz don't have jack, some niggaz got contracts

Rappers came with their styles and I left with their heads
Their crews became victim of the body-snatchin dread
The world is now mine, the world belongs to me
I carefully planned the extinction of all wack MC's
Now innocents must prepare for my slaughter
My style will inherit the world, just like water
Cover it like sauce, think about who lost
Niggaz minds was the reason for the MC holocaust
I'll be the first to admit, I'm on some next shit
Two rappers stepped up and left bullemic, and anorexic
I told humans I'd conquer and bomb shit
Now I stand alone and take care of my continents
A&R's used to ignore me (yep) realized I was nice
Now it's no one left here to write my life story
Ninety-five rappers shelled like pearls
Hit by genocide, I inherited the world

Slit my own wrists, and bleedin out microphones
Consider me the MC who lives forever
Rainin hemlock on niggaz, yes, the God of the weather
The end of time as you know it without a shotty
In the simple game of freeze tag, I touched EVERYBODY
Man's worst creation like the bomb
Just exist in life form, then I'm leavin town tomorrow
If I hadn't done it, the world wouldn't be clean
Now I memorize rhymes, work on my time machine
Nothin shall breathe, or be conceived
They shoulda known, now it's on and the world's on it's knees
I feel relieved, free from their directions
Now I battle my reflection, ask rhetorical questions (uh-huh)
My actions, they might make mortals earl
I won't have that problem, I inherited the world

Now put thought to the word one
Cause now I got Mad time to think about what I done
It's too quiet here, I'm losin my mentality
I'm actually alone and I'm startin to see reality
No more hip-hop -- what was I thinkin of?
No more fat tracks and no family to love
No incidents makin black people tighter
No more real MC's doin time in the cypher
No wreckin shows, no more gettin biz
I fantasize and hear voices sayin, ""Yo that shit was fat kid""
Nothin to look forward to, day after day
So why write rhymes - who's gonna hear what I have to say?
And if I do, who's gonna appreciate it?
Humanity terminated, I'm alone and I hate it
I lost it all, my crew and my girl
All because I had to inherit the world..

Which occurs everytime that the mic hits my hand
Now understand, me not makin MC's sweat
is like seein a brother sellin the Final Call chillin in the short set
Check the drill when you see me write your will
Makin cheese like grill, here to test a nigga's mic skills
When I rhyme REAL heads get the shivers
Here comes that nigga name Shakwan, signed sealed and delivered
to your tape deck, CD's and crossfaders
Beats be hard like blowin bubbles with Now or Laters
Don't front, like you don't know who I am
Fully equipped to mic rip, brother here comes the jam

[Chorus]
When the mic hits my hand, you know I'm gonna slam
Money you'll be like, oh shit!  That's the jam
When the mic hits my hand, you know I'm gonna slam
Kid you'll be like, oh shit!  That's the jam
When the mic hits my hand, you know I'm gonna slam
Yo you'll be like, oh shit!  That's the jam
When the mic hits my hand, you know I'm gonna slam
And you'll be like, oh shit!  That's the jam

[Mad Skillz]
Now if you want to play around don't play with me
You can play with AIDS, I'm puttin H's in your IV's
Bum raps over drum taps; rappers jumpin up in my face
like the ground was covered with thumbtacks
I'm in your face like mace, take a taste
Make a crowd vibrate, like a device on my waist
Skillz Mad, will he be bad?  Ask your dad
Don't front, he know about the skills that I had
Or should I say got cause my mic still hot
Back up it's Shakwan I'm lettin off verb shots
I take MC's, wake 'em up out they sleep
Pour ammonia in they face, slap 'em with some microphone techniques
After that, niggaz retire, cause I'm iller
and my lyrics are thicker than Richard Pryor
One time for my crew, two times for the fam
Givin crews sun tans, make way for the jam

[Chorus]
When the mic hits my hand, you know I'm gonna slam
Yo you'll be like, oh shit!  That's the jam
When the mic hits my hand, you know I'm gonna slam
Money you'll be like, oh shit!  That's the jam
When the mic hits my hand, you know I'm gonna slam
You'll be like, oh shit!  That's the jam
When the mic hits my hand, you know I'm gonna slam
Yeah you'll be like, oh shit!  That's the jam

[Mad Skillz]
Yeah, the jam has arrived so all that garbage can walk
before I personally interact with that ass like Box Talk
So pass the steel when I flex on the reels
You know the deal that nigga Skillz be up in dips like Massengil
douche, ass toosh, who get loose
Funk money times five gettin live call a truce
From Compton to Maine I tear, niggaz out the frame
I don't battle I show niggaz how to play the cryin game
Like last November, when your man got dismembered
It was me I ate his meat, and it lasted through the winter
So enter, cause yo I been, bombin since
ninety-one when I started destroyin MC's confidence
So peace, to the real MC's
Kalonji the Mindbenda and my man Lonnie be	
Javon, Little Rock, Big Street my man
Fuckin 'round with Skillz you get caught up in the jam

[Chorus]
When the mic hits my hand, you know I'm gonna slam
You'll be like, oh shit!  That's the jam
When the mic hits my hand, you know I'm gonna slam
Yo you'll be like, oh shit!  That's the jam
When the mic hits my hand, you know I'm gonna slam
You'll be like, oh shit!  That's the jam
When the mic hits my hand, you know I'm gonna slam
You'll be like, oh shit!  That's the jam
When the mic hits my hand, you know I'm gonna slam
You'll be like, oh shit!  That's the jam
When the mic hits my hand, you know I'm gonna slam
Yeah you'll be like, oh shit!  That's the jam
When the mic hits my hand, you know I'm gonna slam
And you'll be like, oh shit!  That's the jam
When the mic hits my hand, you know I'm gonna slam
You'll be like, oh shit!  That's the jam",The Jam,1995
Skillz,"On the real, I freak techniques and beats in my sleep
The mack back in action show skills when I speak
Watch my - leak when I bring it to your face
I still corner dimes, but in the nine I'm on a paper chase
Glass rocks, mega tops, Tims on your block
Holding heat like crock pots and keeping g's in my socks
(So, what's up, hopps?)
I got to keep it tight like seams
'Cause ain't no fiends
Coming in between me and my dreams
See what I mean, black?
I keep it real like that
F a ""word is bond""
I need stocks and bonds from these ill raps
Rappers won't see me with contacts, friend
So, please act you've got a Siamese twin and think again
'Cause in the end I start off with flavor
Next to bless your chest with freestyle fantasia
Smooth behavior
Seeing rappers as illusions
Meaning they disappear but I'm hear to keep you moving

chorus:
Everybody, move ya body!
Everybody, move ya body!
Everybody, move ya body!
I don't think twice, kid
You know I bring it to ya live
(repeat)

See, I don't get writer's block
Yo, I block other writers
And there's been nights I had to wear sniper attire for biters
Don't make that same mistake and get scarred, retard
I see that tape you listening to got you thinking that you hard
But dig this...
Cut your hair and get your name on your stomach
I still find ways to make your whole rap career plummet
Maintain
I steal mics out of the frame
But now people think they know me 'cause they know my real name
While I stay same
Doing shows and tours
Somewhere in a phat crib(?) playing Sega in the dashboard
Styles of sword(?) and flowing steadily
Trapping MCs in mazes forever like Frankie Beverly
You know the steeze
I'm bringing beats to they knees
Holacausting MCs and sees some g's before I breath
That's how it be
It's no doubt that I
Got to bring it to your chest as I bring it to ya live

chorus

So, from this point on until the day that they bury me
I'll still be on a hunt trying to snatch this currency
Putting my peeps on while friends turn fake
They get pissed thinking I be in Switzerland checking some real estate
Dropping LPs every year
Somewhere in a mansion with a butler named Vincent Jeffrey Belvadere
I'm rare
But, rappers ain't trying to hear
The reason why their girl freestyled her number in my ear
It's my year, son, and I ain't trying to slip
I'm trying to collect props and get not(?) to stretch money clips
Honey-dips
I keep 'em on like low end
So, f five-o
Illegal, so we don't got to go there
It's so unfair
How I do wack crews shady
They want to be next up
Their style sucks like a new baby
They can't faze me
Mics and man fusion
Beats I keep bruising
Do your thing and keep moving

Yo, where I reside fake niggaz run and hide (what?)
The streets be wicked, keep that biscuit by yo' side
What the fuck?  Who the next crew to get run amuck?
It's all real over here, on the streets you get stuck
for fakin jacks don't max cause the block stay hot
Watch your back for the jeal' niggaz tryin to get what you got (true)
Count your dough slow, never flash your ends
Always keep a stash spot and never make new friends
Commit your sins (right) confess on your own time kid
Never think that you too nice to do a fuckin bid
Don't nobody but you want to see, you gettin bigger (uh-huh)
So for every loyal nigga (what?) it's two spoiled niggaz (true)
Midnight to six cliques pullin sweet vicks (uhh)
Fulfullin cream dreams, takin niggaz out the mix
Nine-pound locked down by you and yo' crew
But watch yo' back nigga (why?) because the streets don't have to

[Chorus] - 2X

Yo, fuck gettin high, I need high dough
And when you high all you seein is yo' money movin slow
So scratch the itch, don't slip and don't snitch
Leavin?  c'mon, this ain't ""Superfly"" bitch
Ask black, the kid with the wide-body Ac'
Put a freeze on your cheese and you're workin 'til he stack
Nuff bills to chill, sniff lines and shit
'til some niggaz hit crib on some tec-9 shit
I numb gums like coke when you take a taste
You in the wrong motherfuckin place tryin to be Scarface
Niggaz be schemin and slippin on Henny demon
Tryin to outlast the next ass, cash got him fiendin
to rock on the wrong blocks and don't know the tactics
In God we trust, mad deep like Sounds of Blackness
Locked in the rule of no sharin, it might seem
I'm selfish but I'm for delf I can't spend whipped cream

[Chorus] - 2X

[Mad Skillz]
Break it down
The man is so hot niggaz is catchin suntans
Makin plans to jam after they bag up this next gram
Brothers gettin laced, I caught a new case
But if they want me, they got to kill me twice like Screwface
Excess players I got no time for rest man
Keep that dough flowin, motherFUCK owin the next man
Neighborhood villain, hoodie glock no smile
When I see you it's gon' be, executioner style
What nigga?  Check the stee', yeah you know how it get
Out here some ol' (?) Columbian blindfold shit (true)
Dou-ble go to club chill drink holder (uhh)
Discrete down to low cabbage gettin street soldiers (hah)
Duckin guys 'til heads recognize the real
Lettin lead fly, but instead I maintain and chill (uh-huh)
You know the deal, kids get ill don't sleep
You get your card pulled quick fuckin around in these streets

Death to wack MC's 
First up is my nigga Lonnie be	 
First up to make it liver  I catch wreck like drunk drivers 
Been through many battles but I left no survivors 
So WHASSUP? Those that want a beef nigga bring it on 
Cause when I'm done  it'll be my dick that you're swingin on 
From the way I say my rap clear 
I make people more excited than a faggot that got a pap smear 
The crooked truth rap sensation, I ain't to be fucked with 
You better off practicin masturbation 
Line after line I bring excitement like a hooker 
So put rubbers on your ears, then diaphragms on your woofer

(SOUTHSIDE!) The place where I dwell so

Just like that little girl that got shot in +Fresh+ 
Word to momma, I'm hotter than that nigga with the bomber 
leather pants on, in hell holdin hands with Jeffrey Dahmer 
Yo, let me make this clear - I ain't the baddest rapper out there 
but I'ma take his place until he get here 



The sun shitter, hoarse all-star spitter 
More ? and asteroid transfixer 
Upchucks the medicine, chest of anguish 
In a fantasy, holy sign language 
I hit worlds, and my strange sperm gives birth 
to septuplet lady plants 
Check my tympanic titanic time pulse 
By the grace of the Immortal One 
I am the poisonous priest of fifty until the ?m'salaam? 
So every naked ape on Earth bow down in silence 
to the slumlord, of all universe reality 
Ironic supalism sodomizes your mentality 
Science super-mystics and futuristics join in wedlock 
So my freon cyrogenics make your head rot pop then bust 
from galactic cryathallic mechany mal ?? 


Preposterous, ice in my drop, yeah that's niggaz

Malopropism is none, when I cerebrum wash in your brain pan 
Mixin ooze, your state of bein and attitude 
Petuitary shrinks, accepts it when 
I bite then flatten your head 
Richencypholic surgeon of my cosmorama, astrophysical 
Invades one, individual stands 
and uses cosmic radiation as a cosmetic 
to beautify inner fantastic, gory flow 
So, writing weak rhymes to your boomin system is no mo'

Breakin mo' grounds than aftershocks from the earthquakes in San Fran' 
More determination than a bull, seein Redman

Competition say I gotta be display em in a photo album 
Disorganized has the other file 
Bein flamboyant like ? herbal user, slash, barracuda 
with key maneuvers like silent troopers of styles

Started chewin on the Milky Way, thought it was the candy bar 
You get the gong cause we niggaz do wrong 
and if you're young, and in love, do the moves of Michael Evens 
singin songs, big up to my peoples Northside 
Show the brotherhood, how I recognize

Madness and wisdom accelerates my pendulum 
No attackin my forces of life, cause I got ten of em 
Dangerous, disciple killin images 
My warfare dreads be just like Nemesis

In it to survive, so enlist, in strategies

Don't misinterpret my threats as just talk

Yo, it's the Mad child layin verses like tile 
Niggaz go impotent, when I kick these potent ass freestyles 
Wack MC's get mad and look at me hard 
Cause they used to be the shit, like McDonald's on Broad 
It's odd, how niggaz try to bomb 
Then I be fadin more motherfuckers than AIDS story harvest 
Throwin niggaz away like apple cores - I don't want to see shit

I'm rippin tapes, niggaz still makin SHIT cakes 
Slippin down to fall off dudes tryin to get they shit straight 
I'm tryin to get paid troop -- I want more G's

Niggaz think they hype, but they ain't touchin these 
Their styles plaid out like stripe cuffed Lee's 
Please! In ninety-five, I'ma be straight 
Stealin MC's like DJ's be stealin milk crates 
Ask Dre, can't nobody hack it, they ill Dre? 
You get beheaded with a motherfuckin hatchet 
Haste makes waste and taste the bass

Skillz,"[Verse one: Mad Skillz]
It`s time to bring it down, don`t front on the sound
Check your thunderpound, it be Skillz blowing up from the underground
Now, don`t waste your time and try to taste mine
I`m killing MC`s and going low-key like baselines
Be hesitant, VA residents ain`t friendly
Diss and I`ll walk on your back like Mr. Benny
When my shit drop, all this wack shit`ll stop
Till Janet stops, rockin` Planet Rock
Keepin` it real hot
I specialize in microphone satisfaction
Hackin` MC`s who think Skillz be relaxin`
Straight from punchline ave, metaphor metropolis
I`m shockin` MC`s like seeing their grandmothers topless
Watch this, check for my sequal
I make raps and niggas vanish like the Village People
Hey, you checkin` for me check ?round my way
They say Skillz don`t play when he`s representin` VA

Chorus 4x: [Mad Skillz]
Virginia`s in the house [I said it]
V-A [so what you gotta say?]

[Verse two: Mad Skillz]
Yo, niggas get pissed, MC`s cease to exist 
As I persist, to drill mics and fill glock clips
Don`t sleep, like Mobb Deep, I`m leaving brothers shook
While you debatin` I`m urinatin` on your rap book
I be Skillz see, the ill East Coast MC
All my peeps down in VA, this one`s for you be	
So don`t give me nothin` I`m takin` my props
And I ain`t stoppin` till my face is on the side of a lunchbox
The wack fold, ?cause they been told
Their rhymes used to be worth something like Mr. T`s gold
Now I`m in, so watch me Kline like Calvin
I`m the Dread Man, you fucked up by lettin` me make an album (huh)
The outcome is ill, when I grip the steel
Don`t be mad at me (why?), if you ain`t got no skill
No questions, no second guessin` without a doubt
Niggas know my name and they know who`s in the house

[Chorus 4x]
[Verse three: Mad Skillz]
Is VA up in here? (HELL YEAH!!!)
Then here`s a jam for you to spread across the state like welfare
I`m a special dread, that still be tactics
Doing MC`s anytime, anyplace like Janet Jackson
It ain`t about dirt roads and corn bread
Niggas be MC`ing, G`ing, war deeds and dread
After this pack it up, I`ll tell you my plan
I`m on a VA tour with Kalonji my man
Check it, hittin` city to city like a horny trucker
This year, it`s East Coast like a motherfucker
Misconceptions are coming back like reflections
Niggas who dissed, are now checkin` for my section
They want to be down, they makes me laugh
That`s like Brandy gettin` dropped and then you askin` for her autograph
You know the steelo and Skillz be in ya

So I can practice checkin that neck and got set

Put your tool on the shelf
And just go for self
Get help... get da drink and get the hidin
Get your groove on

Before he get gis glock and gat up the party like Gotti
I`m runnin thangs from the inside
Rap better wait because your style done died
And let you corny-spiderman Mc`s sayin nuthin

Put your clothes on backwards if you feel like frontin
I'm huntin for beats/on point like cleets
Wit da brand new sound
You can pump in ya jeeps..It be the Nod Factor

Rollin hard like tecs

Bringin it to you somethin stank

Skillz,"Mad Skillz, nigga, I'm known to crush an MC or two
Niggas try to step and get reps, but who the fuck are you?
Around this part of town we are the niggas who don't play
Supafriendz be the mens that are holding down VA
Flatten niggas like tires, what I do with 'em?
Get in their ass so they hype men when I get through with 'em
Hope you don't mess up cause on the mic I don't slip
You playa hate, I show you how to eat a fucking brick
Danja, what you think? (Please, no one can serve us)
Niggas popping shit get shook, scared, and nervous
Playa haters, this is for all of y'all
Nigga what, you can get these motherfucking nuts, lick the balls!

Now everytime I grab the mic you know I'm ripping it
Put your taste buds on the sack and start licking it
Quan's taking a classic Slick Rick flipping it
Clowns could fuck around, I be spitting shit
Now here they come looking trife, you know how niggas bite
Sewing they assholes up, trying to keep they shit tight
Stay in your place, beats get blazed and laced
You're wack, you deserved to get smacked right in your fucking face
Get your weight up, we do an MC should
y'all niggas couldn't sell a tape in your neighborhood
Got the gall to want to see a nigga fall
Try to keep it on the low, but while you down there yo, lick the balls!

Sucker ass MC's, talking all this shit, niggas don't want it, nawmean?
MC's get sliced, every fucking thing I say is nice
Swell it if you like, I put your ass on ice
That's right, in VA we be grooving shit
Put your ass in our way and we be moving it
Who's getting done this year, nigga? I bet your crew knows
Cocking .44's, sticking niggas for they school clothes
Shock the spot, shivers when I rock the stud mic
It's aiight, get bone nigga, I cold fuck your wife
Friends Super, from now to the fucking ending
Ain't nothing sweet, mad deep is how we all living
So who stands gossiping behind the walls?
You can't do shit for my motherfucking click, lick the balls!

Go Mad Skillz! Give it to me! That's what the hoes say
While you set, I put bets to blow your whole scene
Pulling dimes I don't want, now that's my game plan
Shit on motherfuckers and I tell 'em who the fuck I am
My name is Skillz and now you know who's getting ill
Fuck the world for real, we 'bout these stacks of mils
Get off the dick, the shit talkers get served
""From Where???"" was the best album your ass ever heard
I eat you up and give your whole crew a bowl of puppy chow
Don't say shit, bust you with a sign language freestyle
So those that hate me, guess what, I hate y'all
y'all niggas can't compare, don't even come up for air, lick the balls!

I'm back these rap cats is wildin'
Got 'em in the studio poppin' Valiums, remasterin' they album
I'm about to re-up and restructure the case
You stuck, you about to get rearranged and replaced
I got plans for this rap game (uh-huh)
Put your head in the toilet and look son,
If you think my shit done changed
My shit is, out of your range, rip you out of your frame
Cop your tape, and the next day, copped an exchange
If you ain't, rockin' raw, what you rockin' for??
Without heat, y'all MC's, ain't hot no more
So for you lame cats tryin' to put your hit out
Try rockin' back and forth
It might be easier to get your shit out!

I'm Jedi Master, Mase Windu, what you been through
Keep MC's heads wrapped like Erykah Ba-do
Hip-Hop's Cleon Jones, when Eon Jones
Wackest MC's, we pee on those
No need to impede The High and Mighty mystique
That shit would be as ignorant as Jimmy the Greek
Claimin' they Godzilla's when they really Godzooki
Got a mill' from Charlie Brown, when I kidnapped Snoopy
Eon, sale or performance, in any ordinance
Rhyme menace, that burst your verbal nuisance
In accordance, with all the laws from the cordless
Starbuck coming through, leavin any pimp whoreless
Stereo stompin' defeatin' me is like

Real quick out the stash, been flippin' at dash
Bruise me with two feet when I'm kicking yo' ass
And you never catch me in the club leaving a skirt
If I don't get brains then the meter get jerk

Rent a car in your hometown just to see if it work

You can put me on a plane or put me on a train

They understand my pain and how I took over the game

Pull it back now one time dreadlocks
Become me no you want the original 
Play the B-side this instrumental
Beg you a piece of the version

Selector, we don't come again now man
Selector, play the tune again

Selector, selector
You got to pull it up, got to pull it up
Selector, selector
I like to pick it up, you gotta put it up 

Move to the decks and try to take up the mike
And show the people in the place you've got the skills to excite
You get blanked like your not even there
Even though in all them face you just constantly stare

Jack it again I want to ride the rhythm
I want to rock the rhythm
Now pull it up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up
Murder the tune now with a subsonic boom
That's how we rock out the room
Now pull it up, up

It ain't no time for resting or taking naps
I got to have something so I'm counting all paper stacks
I got dreams and aspirations of ballin' big

Skinnay Ennis,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic 
That I always have found it best, 
Instead of getting 'em off my chest, 
To let 'em rest unexpressed, 
I hate parading my serenading 
As I'll probably miss a bar, 
But if this ditty is not so pretty 
At least it'll tell you 
How great you are. 

You're the top! 
You're the Coliseum. 
You're the top! 
You're the Louver Museum. 
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss 
You're a Bendel bonnet, 
A Shakespeare's sonnet, 
You're Mickey Mouse. 
You're the Nile, 
You're the Tower of Pisa, 
You're the smile on the Mona Lisa 
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop, 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom you're the top! 

Your words poetic are not pathetic. 
On the other hand, babe, you shine, 
And I can feel after every line 
A thrill divine 
Down my spine. 
Now gifted humans like Vincent Youmans 
Might think that your song is bad, 
But I got a notion 
I'll second the motion 
And this is what I'm going to add; 

You're the top! 
You're Mahatma Gandhi. 
You're the top! 
You're Napoleon Brandy. 
You're the purple light 
Of a summer night in Spain, 
You're the National Gallery 
You're Garbo's salary, 
You're cellophane. 
You're sublime, 
You're turkey dinner, 
You're the time, the time of a Derby winner 
I'm a toy balloon that's fated soon to pop 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top! 

You're the top! 
You're an arrow collar 
You're the top! 
You're a Coolidge dollar, 
You're the nimble tread 
Of the feet of Fred Astaire, 
You're an O'Neill drama, 

You're Whistler's mama! 

You're camembert. 

You're a rose, 
You're Inferno's Dante, 

You're the nose 
On the great Durante. 
I'm just in a way, 
As the French would say, ""de trop"". 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top! 

You're the top! 
You're a dance in Bali. 
You're the top! 
You're a hot tamale. 
You're an angel, you, 
Simply too, too, too diveen, 
You're a Boticcelli, 
You're Keats, 
You're Shelly! 

You're Ovaltine! 
You're a boom, 
You're the dam at Boulder, 
You're the moon, 
Over Mae West's shoulder, 
I'm the nominee of the G.O.P. 

Or GOP! 

But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top! 

You're the top! 
You're a Waldorf salad. 
You're the top! 
You're a Berlin ballad. 
You're the boats that glide 
On the sleepy Zuider Zee, 
You're an old Dutch master, 

You're Lady Astor, 
You're broccoli! 
You're romance, 
You're the steppes of Russia, 
You're the pants, on a Roxy usher, 
I'm a broken doll, a fol-de-rol, a blop,

I can see the sun, though we're out in the rain, when I'm with you.
To lose you would be tragic, here is my heart unfurled,
You have the certain magic, you are the seven wonders of the world.
Snow is on the ground but the leaves are on the trees when I'm with you,
Flowers sing a love song, there's music in the breeze when I'm with you.
Hmm, mm mm mm. Please let me make this confession,
You are my magnificent obsession.

With plenty of money and you.
In spite of the worry that money brings.
Just a little filthy looker buys a lot of things.
And I could take you to places that you would like to go.
But outside of that, I've no use for dough.
It's the root of all evil,
Of strife and upheaval.
But I'm certain, honey, that life would be sunny
With plenty of money and you.

So many people happy now that we back
Nappys on the track and we lovin' this feedback
Still your verse was cold like Kobe on game night
I appreciate that love, thanks for spelling my name right
Sometimes I'm unsure and insecure, then the sight of your face
Helps me endure
That's why we go hard when we out on tour
Be sure to buy the cd when it's out in stores
Cause what I'm sayin' is
Uh uh

Dear fans out in cope cod
Big sky Montana, to Atlanta out on boulevard
The hurricane just missed us
We in Baton Rouge now with kids takin' pictures
Last night we did Cheyenne
It was cold, didn't see Yellowstone is was closed
Well the albums coming soon, matter fact June
Hit my page, give me your thoughts on the tunes
and remember

World Champions

Look, straight from my heart to yours
One love to each and all
Support good music, this movement gonna reach you all
Cause Nappy'll come runnin' when the peoples call
Keep it real, keep it raw, cause we need you all
I need that love, keep my above all the hatred
Give me the strength to make it

Kicking) as they kicked away the chair... They fed it strychnine! We kept
On staring, sick and sordid, as you pulled another bullet from my belt and
Fired! Count to nine... (ninety nine)... count to nine.
I caught it in my teeth, I licked it clean, I chewed it, I chewed it, struck a
Match... I flew a dozen stories to my stool behind a widow. Sure I'm small,
But big enough (I'm big enough), to send a bullet through your head. A
Bullet through the center of your head! I'll send a bullet through the center
Of your head. Center bullet... Rent a bullet...

[1:32] I must leave you know. See you later gentlemen. Meditate while awaiting your turn, for it would be extremely difficult for you to get away from here, unless of course you have wings, like a bat.

With hopefulness in my heart, I told you then that with Lucifer's aid we might look forward to a more succulent occasion. Cast back your mind.

I'm the pimp motherf***er, baby
Ice cold, stories so high 
I pimp the whole village twice
So tight fold crease right on the president's nose

Pimp clothes, drinkin straight Henney'and Buckstrum
Touch toed, hoes take a centerfold pose
Break a treat, make 'em pay to enter those 
Pros, slam those

Game tied tight like bows, we never close
Three-sixty-five, twenty-four
Hand chose bithces a la mode, gettin' sold
Plus a load of killer, as Chronic gettin' blowed

Keep it froze, tucked up in a Tupperware bowl
Stick of gold, somethin' from the school of the old
Forever flows, I take it down as deep as it can go
Burn rolls, braids tight, blazed afros 

We're pushin' hoes
Dicks get erect like poles, pay the toll 
MJG is in control

Up in the morning in the court, it's 'bout to go down
There's no remorse now, better expose rounds

I represent it to the end, the same s***

All you see is your boys and reeboks

A thin hat to the back with a strap too
Willin' to bust a n**** a** if he had to
If you feel the same my n*****, you's a hot boy
Blocka, blocka, blocka

Better get up off the block, boy

You ever had corns on your fingers from squeezing the mack to much
Nigga be rhyming the dice game where me and lil wack grew up
Tripping stolen strip cars for a living
Stayed away from home when ever they was bitchin
We used to rush the customers for sales when they pull up in cars
Until undercovers started putting us behind bars
Menace to society is all we watch
In the back seat straped with the throw away glocks
I got some partners in the business never seeing the light
Your people would gota cocking if your cheese be right
You know I've been holding it down playa you a dog
I'm a real nigga I ain't gonna stop accepting your phone call
I'm a blow and toss a hoe for you, like I'm supposed to do
I'm serious and focused to you, know I am over do
The first nigga to park a Rolls Royce in the bricks
While I fly private jet out of town by a bitch

Long as I breathe ain't nothin in this world that they can't be

Started tweakin and broke in them people house next do'
Shot a nigga for smokin rocks on my mom back porch
Damn near graduated and got on that dope
My, work is an art, I am better than smart
Homey I hustle with a strategy that's never been taught
I can make the coke flip, I can make a hoe strip, I can spray the whole clip, 
I take nothing from no bitch
I got the money in the case, 45 in the waist
Pitbulls in the yard so stay away from my gate
Could you believe a nigga feelin like he still ain't ate?
Huh, y'all don't understand you shoulda seen my plate
Would love to give you some credit, but even you said it
Be serious about your money and right now I'm tryin to get it

Saw death and crime for the first same time
Them rims don't shine just a vision of mine
Put this shit back together cause I stay on the grind
Nigga know I gets me I stunt all the time
For the dead and the gone, the young and the grown
O.G. mother fuckers who be getting it on
Niggaz stunting and they shining bling blingin all the timin

I can't live without you girl, come back to me

Oh, I know there's still a place for me in your heart
And oh, every moment I spend without you, girl, is tearing me apart

But that don't mean Skipper won't pop it
Ain't that that dude with the H2 and the nice wallet?
And I got four words, stay off my dick
You wanna make it to where Skip ain't got shit
So you could ride around town and spread your gossip
Make up stories like ""U.T.P. done dropped Skip""
""Juve' used the man, paid him and then got rich""
C'mon stop it, you're makin' it up
Damn, how much hate is enough, boy you faker than fuck

With a dime piece, smilin', gettin' head in the truck

Open my eyes when the sun rise, blazin'
First nigga on the strip, even if my block's hotter than Cajun
I cop them Haitan, Jamaicans, Cubans and Yanks
Program with every race, now I cuts my own steak
Known to take G trips to a town like Wimbleton
Get a bust' down spot and be servin' like Wimbledon
Black John McEnroe, my rap flows are clapped (uh-hu)
Supposed to be hot as Tabasco, look at them assholes now
Homie, when I'm seen there's a crowd
With head bustas off the streets talkin' loud, ready to wild
Get respect for a few things
Deranged, the chopper spit
And the first off the block to cop a new Range
Life is fast, I get cash and write about it
At night it ain't safe in the South, we bout it bout it
Doubt it and get bodied 'cause the shotty will lift,
Your big muscleman bodyguard off his shit

[Chorus: x2]

Who lil' daddy with the fitted cap turned back?
Know some of these niggas got respect, he tryin' to earn that
Hopefully one of these niggas with yayo will see that
And put him in the right position he tryin' to be at
They talkin' in the wind but they no better than the play though
They could make a carton or a t-shirt in a day though
I ain't tryin' to flex my power bitch but I got say so
And I could make a million; American, yen or peso
They say I got a attitude, that's not the issue at all
Don't get involved when I'm doin' what I have to do
I'm suttle now but I could turn into an animal
Blow it out of proportion and I ain't understandin' you
Not in it for the short, I want the long term
Fuck the government, I'm a take care of my own children
You gon' have to zip your lip up, before a nigga flip up
I don't think they understandin' me, holler at 'em Skipper

Tongue-kissin' a hoe a nigga know she a doctor
Hoe can make a nigga think she a queen
She standin' there, smellin' like potpourri, I bet she stank in them jeans

Need to shake it, wash it, rinse it, squeeze it and douche it
Call a time-out, freeze, at ease that pussy
They comin' out the woodworks, ain't no pride
They don't get tired, play they vibe and they'll shake it 'til they foot hurt

Say she dressin' for time, she got a lot of that
She ain't no nickel and dime, she got a dollar back
When she step her ass bounce two times
The wobble, wobble, make it hard for her to walk straight lines

Gotta add the soldiers on when you standin' behind her
You might get stuck in there and need a camera to find her
Gotta hold on to them handlebars 'cause you don't want that broad
Goin' tellin' your dawgs you got handled boy

Let's get a room somewhere deep on the outskirts
Give me head 'til yo' muh'fuckin' mouth hurts
Go tell your friends 'bout the suite up at the W
About the view and all the freaky shit I done to you

Now, when she see me, when you're not around
She be in my face, tryin' to see what I'm about
Here, take my number, maybe you can take me out
Take you somewhere and put some dick up in your mouth

I remember when you bitches wasn't so nice
Before the rings and the watches got a coat of ice
Same nigga, different day, we forever say
Money over bitches, U.T.P., Eight way

Oh, I like the way you move it to the right, girl
No, I like the way you shake it to the left, girl
No, I like it when you bend it, when you step girl
Now, touch your toes while you hold your breath girl

And I ain't come here to ruin your night
I'm tryin' to put somethin' new in your life
Just by doin' you right, we can go somewhere for two if you like
Use the stars and the moon for the light 'cause you movin' it right

See, I'm really tryin' to do you tonight
If you dyke, bring your crew if you like
If any, um, booty is like, your booty is like
Call your whole crew booty delight, we make it 'Nolia Clap'

Don't hold it back, touch the flo' with that

This is the year of the you, watch how I get on track
A young black Peyton manning in the rap gettin' his snaps
And also, he only rides in the year that he's in
'Cause he don't feel the year's bigger than him, so, let the boy be

He off the meter with tennis shoes and a white tee
Bitches watchin' him thinkin', ""What if he wife me?""
And it's a certain kind of swagger you get
Especially when you're used to bein' the shit, that's if you're older right

All of my boss bitches know the type
When a nigga hug all on ya and he be smellin' like a motorbike
A nice fit and video on the TV'll
Get her to come out of them B.B.'s, believe me

Ladies know when I hit they corner my slabs'll make 'em faint

Honies love the way I talk, love the way I walk
Love the way I lean, they say that I'm so clean

I got a lot of cars, many colors and lots of types

Comin' down on choppers single file with all the trunk poppers

Gettin' money's my only task, stack up paper and count cash
I'm ridin' on that pull over silver, the same color as a bad rash

Do you know the rules when you got beef with a fool
Can you stick and move and do you sleep with the tool
You in the camp you bout to make you an examp
So when they see the stamp they goin 'respect it like a champ
You light in the ass but kind of heavy with the cash
Be rollin' the grass you still totin' the solider rag
You been out there on the grind spendin' most of ya time
In a section full of nobody's so you gotta shine
Will you bust a head, know how to do it-how to play it
Bet a hundred in the field and parlay
Can you flip a Z, go back and get a Quater ki
When you rid of that call Rico up and order three
Put ya people in it cause that's the way you gotta see it

You hate checks, you just come home on a case
Can you make a name-will you be patient in the game
Can you state ya claim, and reputation stay the same
Will you hold it down when ya lil'homies ain't around
Will you hold ya ground like you the only one in town
Is you feelin' this, you listen to it when you creep
You real in the streets all in the hood with the heat
You ain't tryna joke gotta be real for ya folks
Is ya people broke they aggravate you on the porch
Do you sell weed and you don't never make a profit
Do you blow big until it hurt you in ya pocket

You from the East, you from the West, you from the South

They take dick in they ass, they take dick in the throat
They take dick in they ear, they take dick in they nose
They take a dick, anywhere your dick can go
But look, it ain't nothin' like my bitch out the St. Bernard
A gangsta broad, get Wacko gangsta hard
She said we might could run a train if I pursue my G
If not I got it poppin' off on Music Street
Last week I had to do about two of them freaks
But them niggaz through there be trippin' so bring two of them heats

We got quarters, ounces, and halfs and birds of smack
Ever since Soulja got killed I keep a murder gats
Stand on the middle of my projects where the murders at
And every nigga, every bitch who ain't heard of Wack
I bang women, bang children, bang them murder cats
I bang blocks, bang cribs, bang the Burban Lac'
I bang anything in sight without the murda tats
I'm just the hit to represent where I was born and raised
And every nigga in my section love to roam with K's

Knock off your face, taste, waist, take arms and legs
Drop off your neck, wrist, toes, hair, palms, and head

To blame for all the wrong that you have done
The day that you walked out and left, didn't say goodbye
Who was home alone to sit and cry?
It was I, it was I-I-I-I-I

I gave you all the love I ever had
The only things I got from you were bad
The times you didn't show up, the times you didn't call
Who was left alone through it all?
It was I, it was I-I-I-I-I

My love was always yours to treasure and to hold
But when you let a love grow idle it will soon grow cold
Temptation is too strong to hide, are you really satisfied
With my love the way it is? Let me tell you how it is

Skip Gorman,"Spanish is the loving tongue 
Soft as music, light as spray; 
'Twas a girl I learned it from 
Living down Sonora way. 
I don't look much like a lover, 
Yet I say her love words over. 
Often when I'm all alone 
""Mi amor, mi corazon"" 

Nights when she knew where I'd ride 
She would listen for my spurs, 
Fling the big door open wide, 
Raise them laughing eyes of hers. 
And my heart would nigh stop beating 
When I heard her tender greeting, 
Whispered soft for me alone --- 
""Mi amor, mi corazon"" 

Moonlight on the patio, 
Old senora nodding near, 
Me and Juana talking low 
So the Madre couldn't hear. 
How the hours would go a-flyin! 
And too soon i'd hear her sighin' 
In her little sorry tone --- 
""Adios, mi corazon."" 

But one time I had to fly 
For a foolish gamblin' fight, 
And we said a swift goodbye 
In that black unlucky night. 
When I'd loosed her arms from clingin' 
With her words the hoofs kept ringin', 
As I galloped north alone --- 
""Adios, mi corazon."" 

Never seen her since that night, 
I can't cross the line, you know. 
I am wanted for gambling debt; 
Like as not it's better so. 
Yet I've always sort of missed her 
Since that last wild night I kissed her; 
Left her heart and lost my own 
""Adios, mi corazon.""

Skip Gorman," In the lobby of a big hotel in [C] Ney York town one [G] day
 Sat a bunch of fellows telling yarns to [A7] pass the time a[D]way

[C] Some preferred Chi[G]cago town while [D7] others New [D] Orleans

I can [C] see the campfires smokin at the [G] breaking of the [D] dawn
I can [G] hear the bronco's [G7] neighing I can [C] hear the cowboy sing
I'd [G] like to be in Texas for the [D7] round-up in the [G] spring.


(Verse 2)
In a corner in an old armchair sat a man whose hair was gray
He listened to them eagerly to what they had to say
They asked him where he'd like to be his clear old voice did ring
I'd like to be in Texas for the round-up in the spring


(Chorus)


(Verse 3)
They sat and listened carefully to each word he had to say
They knew the old man sitting there had been a top hand in his day
They asked him for a story of his life out on the plains
Slowly he removed his hat then quietly began.


I've seen  em stampede o'er the hills till you'd think they'd never stop
I've seen  em run for miles and miles until their leader dropped
I was a foreman of a cow ranch the calling of a king
I'd like to be in Texas for the round-up in the spring.


(Chorus)


(Final Verse)
I'd like to sleep my last long sleep with mother earth for bed

Way back down in Texas for the round-up in the spring.  ",I'd Like to Be in Texas,1996
Skip Haynes,"There's a road I'd like to tell you about, lives in my home town
Lake Shore Drive the road is called and it'll take you up or down
From rags on up to riches fifteen minutes you can fly
Pretty blue lights along the way, help you right on by
And the blue lights shining with a heavenly grace, help you right on by

And there ain't no road just like it
Anywhere I found
Running south on Lake Shore Drive heading into town
Just slippin' on by on LSD, Friday night trouble bound

And it starts up north from Hollywood, water on the driving side
Concrete mountains rearing up, throwing shadows just about five
Sometimes you can smell the green if your mind is feeling fine
There ain't no finer place to be, than running Lake Shore Drive
And there's no peace of mind, or place you see, than riding on Lake Shore Drive

And there ain't no road just like it
Anywhere I found
Running south on Lake Shore drive heading into town
Just slicking on by on LSD, Friday night trouble bound

And it's Friday night and you're looking clean
Too early to start the rounds
A ten minute ride from the Gold Coast back make sure you're pleasure bound
And it's four o'clock in the morning and all of the people have gone away
Just you and your mind and Lake Shore Drive, tomorrow is another day
And the sunshine's fine in the morning time, tomorrow is another day

And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said

But how can you walk if first you don't crawl
But through it all you keep blessing me
While people keep on pressin' me and stressin' me
Because they never hear a preacher flow
Let's come together with one heart, one mind
Until we see the sunshine

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings

I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

Natives kneel in prayer by their caravans.

There, silhouetted under and eastern star,
I see my long lost blossom of shalimar

You, Misirlou, Are the moon and the sun, fairest one.

Old temple bells are calling across the sand.
We'll find our Kismet, answering love's command.

You, Misirlou, are a dream of delight in the night.

Heaven will guide us, Allah will bless our love.",Misirlou,2003

You stuck on this title shit, talking David Bridals and shit
What you want from a nigga?
Never give it up but still love to flaunt for a nigga
Good lord, would love to fuck you on tour
But you too stuck on bullshit and fall in love with the lord
And all these fuck niggas showing up, slow to adjust
Late to the party, I get it
You chose to sleep in, no need to see if he's sorry
Apologies for the brash demeanor

You can't see that I'm the one you're looking for
I can't take the games you play
When you look the other way
I'm not sure if I can take this anymore
Can't you see?

Look at me and laugh, she say ""you ain't copped the Beamer yet?""
Selling records now, ain't you supposed to flex more?
Playing in like 16 countries on my next tour
She said ""I get it but at least could send a text more
If you got time for the music, what's the rest for?""
Everything in due time, patience is a virtue

You damn right that I'm doing it for the niggas 
Who sittin' and ain't snitchin',
And all the niggas who gone, I ain't forget you, 
I'm still here waitin' cause you still my nigga.

Hold up, ay, 
I just sent another kite, to my people that's locked, 
They say he had another fight (again),
They say he got 30 days in the hole for beatin 
A niggas ass for tryin' him like a hoe (that's my nigga),
Treetum gone, all over coke, hit him with conspiracy cause he was on the boat, 
They say he'll do 15 at the most,
We prayin for an appeal, but it is what it is, 
My uncle real, my uncle ain't snitchin',
That's why I got a free lou shirt with his picture, 
Rich ass niggas nuts cross on a nigga,
Well fuck how they feel nigga I still miss you

And anybody else behind bars cause they hustle.

And them niggas on the corner every morning gettin' money,
Yes sir, and those who died by the gun, 
And now they dead and gone, 
I'm doin' this one for the deaf, the crippled, and blind,
For those who went strong, and they lost they mind, 
I'm doin this one for the low income, the slaws,
The homies, the basers, and bongs,
For the good, they got to suffer with the bad, 
And for the mother of the child with the dead beat dad,
For my lil brother who was just in the crash, 
Now he can't feel his arms or his legs, man,
I'm doin this one for the tears that were shed, 
For all the niggas that was sentenced to the state or the feds,
To all the does who was givin' they bows 
After talkin' to the door while they homeboys told

Listen bra I know you waitin' on that day to jump, 
But keep ya head up boy because its soon to come,
Cause you know the streets miss you they ask about you errday, 
So you gotta maintain,
Get up out this okay, though I know you hot 
Cause your homeboys shittin' on ya, fuck them niggas tho,
You don't need em on the real homie, real, real, 
You already know what it is, bein' locked up niggas don't give a fuck,
Only real niggas gon keep it treal with you, 
And you know I'm blood, what you need I'm a get you,
'cause ima hold it down on some real shit nigga, 
Bein' caged in the pen ain't for a real nigga,

And them niggas stood on the block and watched that money double, 
And the ones who stood up to cops and ain't said nothin',
Look, ain't that many alive, but I know plenty ridin, 
My lil' brother locked up, doin 25,
And when I get some change ima try and change that, 
And just to think about the niggas I can't bring back,
And can we please have a moment of silence, 
For all the niggas that's no longer around us,
For all the niggas that pro-longed in the county 
And metro-s and T-G-K and star-k, nigga we block raised,
Cops couldnt stop pay, we got rocks so we open up shop today,

Why that shit got a young nigga Velcro stuck
Why your bitch go down when the cess go up

Yeah this what we gon' do, we gon' fall through the hood
Scoop up the lil' homies and hit the motherfuckin' party, bang out
Dig what I'm saying, we gon let them niggaz get, they walk on
We gon' get our ride on and leave with a couple of bitches
And rep this Dub S thang to the fullest West side, like that

When the music is bumpin' and the homies give it somethin'
All the hoes is comin' and you know they all fuckin'
Got the Henny in glass, big puffin' on somethin'
And the niggaz outside and these bitches wanna fight
Then them niggaz pulled up and they deuces all wired
And you know we banged out when the homies come around
One times always turning it up because we bangin' at the party

We come through on that 22 shoe
In that SL500 chappell hill light blue
In cal-aye, we hit the valet
You ain't got it like that, park in the alley, nigga
Get in line while we spit the line for ya
Get inside where we gettin' high
On the dance floor with a big behind
Nigga, don't get mad 'cause your dick ain't mind

So when you see the west side up in V.I.P
Don't bring your ass up there and try to be Ali
I'll beat your ass back down just to be on TV
We know bad publicity'll sell another CD
Fuck with that, fuck with this and I fuck with the crys
Only fuck with the dough, never fuck with you marks
And if you're just getting in, motherfucker you 'tarded
'Cause we bangin' at the party

When the music is bumpin' and the homies give it somethin'
All the hoes is comin' and you know they all fuckin'
Got the Henny in glass, big puffin' on somethin'
And the niggaz outside and these bitches wanna fight
Then them niggaz pulled up and they deuces all wired
And you know we banged out when the homies come around
One times always turning it up because we bangin' at the party

Yeah, you know it's a white tee occasion
We in G formation, reppin' a G nation
I pull up three wheels, swangin' a rag fo'
Hop out with the sag low, strapped with the mag fo'
It's cash flow, thick money rolls and thick hoes

We got those and it's a party on the block loc
And it's a party on the block dawg
You know it's packed full of hogs
That's active and hard on hoes
Handcuffin' your broad is a negative
The twenty-third letter, I'm an O G and reppin' this

Believe, Skoop never nervous to crack a hoe
Plus I got them sets on deck, servin' like McEnroe
K Mac fa sho, I'll give you what you askin' fo'
Why treat a bitch like a bitch and let a hoe be a hoe
It's a Dub S see thang, Soprano the name
H double O bang with the connect gang, nigga

Let 'em walk, walk, let 'em walk
(If you're down with the connect then, ya)
Walk, walk, walk
(If you're strapped with a tech then, ya)
Walk, walk, walk
(If you represent your set then, ya)
Walk, walk, walk
(If you a neighborhood vet then, ya)

Walk, walk, walk
(If the bitch won't fuck then, ya)
Walk, walk, walk
(Outline them niggaz with the chalk then, ya)
Walk, walk, walk
(If you're sippin' on that dark then, ya)
Walk, walk, walk

Skrape,"Don't you cut me down
Unsaid noise I've found
You said you'd be cruel
Our conversation hurt you

As you speak, its obvious
But in the end, its all words

Speak the way you feel
But spoken words don't heal
You can't change this now
I've learned that this is how

As you speak, its obvious
But in the end, its all words

We fall apart, we all fall apart
You fall apart, we all fall apart

I can't see the obvious
'Cause in the end, you know its all your turn
And nothing heals the words we live
But actions speak louder then words",In the End,2003
Skrape,"Hey Hey, fuck you! and all the bitches made
Once again, I fit it in
And fuck it up again
And you think what?
A motherfucker abusing rake
In the face of hate
I stay in shape, I push it to an escapade

There goes my life
And now it seems
That I'm drowning
This is my life

I'm counting dirty money

You was posting on the 'Gram
Now I'm balling like I'm Zinedine Zidane

I'm staying 'round the money like a rubber band
The feds are trying to sabotage my plan
So I keep a duffle bag full of grams 
'Case if shit hits the fan
I'm just praying that my line forever bangs
My nigga stay fly and my burner never jams
Me and Nina popping bottles with some models
Mixing up the Gushers with Gelato
We've got a couple sticks fully loaded 
Rubber grips 'round the handle
Whip it out and make the steel bangle
And lately, I been bored of counting money
I'm the type to pay someone to count it for me
And I can never give away my line 
Because the hustlers are counting on me

I let a slut walk like Amber Rose
Can't believe that we're all stars 
From spitting bars
Putting bras on the cars 
Screaming ""Harlesden is ours""
All because of rap 
And these drug deals the flows priceless
So, I ain't signed a pub deal

Could be in jail or be dead 
But I'm a legend instead
Bearly ever go bed without getting some head
Where I'm from I ain't ordinary
Just to go see my plug quick 
I caught a ferry
Broke rappers talking stacks 
I just think it's funny
Louis XIII in my bladder

But you can't fight a tank with a stick
And you want to fight back, but the future is black
And the killing is making you sick

Not a man or a woman is spared
And then you wonder why, no help does arrive
The world doesn't seem to care

You've formed a small resistance, you've got a few guns
You plan a small ambush, but you end up on the run
You're running through the foothills, but you'll never make yourcave

Skrillex, Bare Noize, Foreign Beggars.

L.A., London, Dubai
'Bout to get rowdy right now.
Yeah. I'm an all time factor, I make the next guy look like an actor.
So the mandam wail like they matter, when I touch mic I see the men scatter,
And they wanna talk big, but when it comes to big it they bout to get splatter,
So I tell them to relax yourself, go home to your mom and stop being a catta
Many guys wanna parr, many guys lookin to take this thing far
Many guys lookin to be some big star, but soon enough them man about to get slappa
So there's no need for chatter, no need for anything cheap and that's that
Anybody making a ting to get smacked up, back up, fam no need to sound back

When I touch mic I see the men scatta
Scatta, as if I had a clutch on a magnum

You're just another pawn in my game, another god figure pour in the rain,
I'm a raw one, too much of a force to contain,
And I'm forced to repay all the thoughts of the brain,
By any means I ain't putting pure spits to shame,
What I depict on scripts too much for the mandem,
And I keep calm when more shits a spray,
And when I'm letting off as if I had a clutch on a magnum.
See you making at me in the fashion,
Most of these mc's are straight gassin,
Yeah they getting paid on the JSA,
Like its something like guy got draper from Mad Men.
Bagging up while I'm racking hits by the minute,
I'm sick with the lyrics, so you best be backin up
Chatta with a little more flex,
doesn't matta cos when I ratatat bars watch the bare man scatta

When I touch mic I see the men scatta
Scatta, as if I had a clutch on a magnum",Scatta,2010

And I ain't going away
I ain't going away

Standing tall, head high, doing what I wanna do
If I fall, I get up, I done came too far to lose
Pushing through, pick it up, even when my body's tired
I got enough drive inside to set the fuckin world on fire

What can I do for me now
Used to the enemy shooting me down
But truthfully how
Could you try to stop me when truth can be found?
And knowing that life is a lesson
Don't question what you can be now
We let this aggression take over and over and over

Ain’t no one to clear the road, it’s on you to pave the way
Get your dreams tatted up, never let em fade away

What you think I ain’t been down on my luck?
I’m dealing with shit on the daily, it’s driving me crazy

Until I D-I-E and that's no L-I-E 

So bitch get off me before I spit some shit 

And break your ass off with a 45 and a extra clip 

They call me see-murder cause I put on in your dome 

I come to your set and leave you laying at home 

I hang with killers and dealers, weed smokers and G's 

No limit niggas don't fall off so fuck my enemies

If I come from around the corner I'm a knock up your head

Most niggas might think I'm crazy when I tell em this 
(Yeah G) 
But you know what most nigga look up to like Presidents
Niggas that's in sports
All this type of shit as heroes
They might look at motherfuckin Muhammed Ali
Yah know Sugar Ray Leanord, Mike Tyson, but me..

[Master P]

Air Jordan ain't no motherfuckin hero G
My heroes is niggas in the ghetto that slang D
That right on chrome and triple gold and pimp hoes
And take any nigga in the click to the Super Bowl
And party like it ain't nothin
But most of my homies they done died over drug money
Like Bizzy Bob and Sam Skutty but I still love em
Air full of motherfucker and I still want to hug em
Big Dave, my nigga gone to the battle field
Dandon and Levi, damn guard ya grill
'cause where ya goin you gotta watch your back

My lil brother Kevin Miller rest in peace
Elbraud, Nextditch, and Big Leaf
Lil Girl, and Boo, and Anguard
Big Pepper, God damn what y'all thinkin about
They gone, I mean they soldiers
But thets the type of cal i live up and hold to

I could start from New Orleans and go back to California
To lil Tony,to dime P
Seritz,Burnell,can't believe
That he's gone, the Scarface
Dank,Loot,and Meathead
And what about Kenny Sep
And all my niggas that dead and gone that got caught in the rep
And my other heroes still livin
But they locked up behind bars, caught up in some pigeons
Like my lil cousin Jimmy,lil Horgel
Randall,Marlow,Pee Wee damn
Another mission complete
Took off the streets locked up by the police
Meatball, and Nap, La Crowe   
Pac, jinte, the gats go pow
But my homies got caught up
Even though they had no way out the ghetto but the come up
Off the streets in the hood money
that's why my heroes live for drug money

What you mean I need a hero
A hero is a zero to me
The only hero that I know is them niggas in my hood G
They gave me the game so I enhanced the gat
Than I took the game, and ripped it out the frame
I tried and told ya
A hero can't be ya lucky rabbit's foot or ya 4-leaf clover
It all be a myth in ya mind
A hero ain't about shit if they ain't about dying
You know who was a hero to me
that nigga MoXs on the Howard J G

And y'all other niggas that's still livin
That want to be a hero but can't be givin
Yo life up for these streets
But this goin out to my homies out there slangin D
That still hustlin in the game tryin to make it
But y'all niggas better realize you can't fake it
You either in or out ain't no halfway in
'cause when you die in the end you go to the pen
And its realer than you real niggas feel me

It's your nigga Skull Duggery.
Me and you together, we bout to tell em about the set up and the trap.

I'm the evolution of the Lord, the Lord made me in his own image
What, I'm gonna ball never fall
See, I'm tryin to elevate the mind rate
I'm a man, I'm tired of this shit, I'm tryin to get some ends in this situation that I'm in
Black women don't even know a black man
They gonna make it from am to am, cause we hustlin
Tryin to do it but the police they are bustin in
It's just a set up


It's a set up, a trap
That's why we act the way we act
They see us in Lexuses, Town houses, Benzes and Navs
Mama Mia, what you think of that

Naaah, they don't like that
Naaah, they don't like that

I'm all by myself tryin to raise my family
Knowing wasn't easy being both mommy and daddy
But I got down on my knees, and I prayed father please
Lift this weight up off my shoulders, whey them devils tryin to hold us down
Cause they want to playa haters crown since the beginning
Travel on gods earth with the intention of sinning
Spilling innocent blood and conquering all the land
But most of all trying to kill the black women and man
Separation keeps the household in disarray
That's been in effect since the days of slavery
Now all my sisters tryin to hold their head
And all my brothers locked down tryin to count their days
And all our babies wonderin around tryin to find their way
And everybodys gotta hustle cause we tryin to get paid
But for every cheddar knocked there's a road block
When it's goin stop, y'all we gotta keep fightin for the top
I want the pot of gold and the rainbow, I'm lettin my people know
Hold your ground firm through the setup don't let go

Another black man strugglin, it's somethin strange or I'm wonderin
To me, how a black man can kill another black on these city streets
I imagine, how you do it, will you kill me
Feel me, I'm not scared, check it
Do you close your eyes when you scream
Do you hollar up the hallway, I'm comin nigga
It's somethin, I wonder how you play hard
Makin coke and heroin substance, yo God
Now check it, little girls see you smokin, the boys want to be you
Why you want to tell this shit to me, what you want to do
I see niggas like you every day
Fallin prey to your own way, it's just a setup

I must watch every rectangle triangle my front sides and back 
Niggas try to take me on a ride and leave me stranded black 
Leave me in spots where I can't fly jack 
Ain't that some shit how niggas come and fuck the game up quick 
I was there when G got popped uh dead in the neck 
Around the corner when Melvin got teked up in the chest 
I was up the block when my compadre Coolie Black got shot 
All up on Second and Clara Blocks now check it 
New change was burnin inside motherfuckers like hell 
The only precautionary measure was to take care of self 
And that's the only way you can survive in the game 
And enhance in the game but lord I really must say 
Everything has got a message and a meaning to it 
A purpose, if you don't believe then your day is coming

In 1970 a hoodlum was born on this earth 
Didn't ask to come here but when I landed it sure did hurt 
It was a trip to see my life split in half 
>From the drug game on the street to the love I showed my mom and dad 
The pain run deep, ha, nigga can't you tell 
Look at the expression on my face, nigga it hurts like hell 
I have a testimony to tell, this life I will never forget 
Let me hit this life boy, rearrange my whole shit 
Look, I was riding up Third Street as usual 
I was gonna bust a left buck I'm on a cell but I left shampoo hotel 
Man it hurts me, scene it horrified me 
I seen a group of little kids having fun ya dig 
nobody botherin them see 
Until this chump drove up with his big shot gun 
And he shot a round of kids, I say boy 
what this nigga did (what this nigga did) 
And the little kid that he shot boy on the block, end his life 
And the kid's name was James ??? right, and that's my testimony

Now see in my life, it ain't never been what it's supposed to be 
Sometimes my tank dogs feel like they losing me 
Sometimes I just feel they don't understand me 
Cause in my life you never tell me life will bring so much harm 
I never thought to see my homie ??? die with needles in his arm 
And like my homie Derrell Fuller, he never got to see his twins born 
And by the way they couldn't see it because they bullets they took 
they couldn't take it 
And you couldn't tell me that these days in my life 
That I believe in the things that I saw

Bring it where the dirt lies cause I was seeking it to destroy
Under twenty five and I caused a killer to die and I'm unemployed
I takes no joy up in another mans pain
But in my mind somehow I hate to find the word called strain
Obtain machan' before you place me in the game
I'm a survivor, watch they holler when I let loose this thang
And I'm swamp and gumbo living
So if y'all niggas coming with 'em, 'fore I rid 'em
Y'all better talk some senses in 'em
Cause new orleans niggas don't yap where I'm from
Bust backs with a gun, up in the club, get to clapping and swung
And my bullets don't hum, they burn
And it ain't no aftermath if you catch a nigga ak'n bad
I make this loud shit sound good, knock on wood
Who am I, little nigga up to no good, out the hood
Watch me show you what I could, I got with a spatch' and a half
Look at my lyrical habit for cabbage, bitch you see me ak'n bad

I'm out in front of the track, bustin like a forty five gun on the track
Y'all know what I know y'all better step aside and let the best come in
And y'all niggas that talkin that shit y'all really better catch some wind
You fuckin with fiend, you fuckin with skull, you fuckin with me
I'll fuck you up the same time I fuck up the beat
You can't stop ak'n bad, ak'n bad

I gets paid a lotta cash, lotta cash
Oh ah ah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Bitch I'm hard and I will roll, I'm still cold
Twenty eight years old (got plenty more) got plenty more
Bitch I'm the man, cars hanging out the garage,
Lights on top of flashing pads

And what about Kenny Sep
And all my niggas that dead and gone that got caught in the rep
And my other heroes still livin
But they locked up behind bars, caught up in some pigeons
Like my lil cousin Jimmy,lil Horgel
Randall,Marlow,Pee Wee damn
Another mission complete
Took off the streets locked up by the police
Meatball, and Nap, La Crowe

Even though they had no way out the ghetto but the come up
Off the streets in the hood money

A hero can't be ya lucky rabbit's foot or ya 4-leaf clover
It all be a myth in ya mind
A hero ain't about shit if they ain't about dying
You know who was a hero to me

Keep a shank in my sock and bullet in my mouth
So don't doubt the angel like voice, come across
Get your cucumber sliced and you messy hoe tossed, boss bitch
I keep em sick from the way I kick my shit
And KLC got em scared cause he's back whisperin' it, anotha hit
No Limit niggas in the house, plus on niggette
With that pimpstress clout, now what they talkin' bout
Beaucoup hustlas, and thugstas, murderers, and dope fiends
Fel a taste from drame scenes
Infared beams aimin' at your forehead
Ain't no fuckin' country boys
Soldiers bringin' noise, leave you lyin' in red
Puddles froma fuckin' ????
Now who will be the next to get they fuckin' shoes took off
I really can't call it, cause once the gumbo be grieven
A nigga start ballin'
Strike up the second line band
And put your black gear on cause we gonna stay bout it, understood

Yo los, take us to a commercial

Y'all check out the young guns, ya heard me?

Check this out..
If you have four ounces and you fronted your boy two
And he gave a half to his boy
And the police raided the spot then he flushed one and a half
And he ask you for one mo'
What should you do if you was in that position?

[young guns]
Nigga fuck that! I ain't bout to let the shit slide
It's time to ride, time for these niggaz to die
We don't just rap - everything we say is for real
Time to let the gauge discharge, and murder that kill
Nigga fuck that! I ain't bout to let the shit slide

We don't just rap - everything we say is for real

Tell them bitch niggaz - they can keep from around
This is family now, I give a fuck about you clowns
Young guns holdin it down, quick to bust a few rounds

They'll drop in the storm, tell them boys it's on
And these niggaz gettin they ass torn, fuck bein warned
This is a street ? ? , I promise to die violent
Now I start wildin, until you bitch niggaz are silent

Nigga fuck that! I'm bout to send these niggaz life back
They talkin shit about my fam and I don't like that
You know how I react, so why you wanna beef?
It's time for me to say my prayers, and hit the streets
Bullets about to hum, bitch niggaz gon' get numb

Next thing you that nigga was on the ground, shakin like dice

Bullets at you busters please, don't try to test these
Pistol packin niggaz in our town
