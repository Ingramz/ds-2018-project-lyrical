The Autumn Offering,"A sudden gasp for life, will this be our last?
Will we sit back and watch fate destroy us?
Come and take my hand, we can ride off
And watch the world die as we breathe our last breath

[Incomprehensible]
[Incomprehensible]

The darkened skies are now falling overhead
Will this be the end or just another dream?
Angels falling from burning skies
Hell has opened up its doors for us

Dying world
Dying world

Now can you feel the end?
Now can you see the end?
Now do you want the end?
Now do you think your God cares?

A mass suicide for all, all mankind
This is all our fault, no one will be saved
Time is running thin as I look towards the skies
I see now that this is truly the end

A mass suicide for all, all mankind
This is all our fault, no one will be saved
Time is running thin as I look towards the skies

",Beginning's End,2004
The Autumn Offering,"Where'd those days go when I thought I knew you?
What happened to the person, I once loved?
Desolate thoughts are all I think of now
It's killing my mind and now I want to kill you

I see you now and stare into those whore stained eyes
And wonder how I could let you lead me to
Believe that you were someone good for me, you weren't
You're just another blood sucking leech

Violence breaks out, in my head
Passive thoughts are now, now thrown away

Go

Despise and disgust are all I see in you now
I wish things could have been right between us
I wish you were the person you had appeared to be
But now my thoughts are gone and thrown away

But now my hate is buried in me
Left for new seeds to grow from this

How long will it be
Until you notice there is nothing left for us?

Spoken infidelities will never see our daylight again
So where does this all lead us to now?
I'll never be able to look at you again
But maybe that is for the best now we'll see
Death is now near my dear, we must part our ways

One thousand cries now die
",Bonds in Which We Break,2004
The Autumn Offering,"Five hundred and fifteen days and nights later
The generation is still doomed to watch its fate
Flash on a screen, inevitable blinding horizon
On high alert for terror this has to be a dream

Have you ever wondered what it's like
To feel the earth crash into you?
Have you ever wondered what it would be like to feel
There's nothing you could do?

This sky can't hold us all, so just set it ablaze, no
Swallowed by the fire
Laid to rest in the bowels of humanity
Winters coming, please tear me away from this

Just let them keep itching each others trigger finger
It's all a matter of who will blink first
When it's all over where will we go?
When it's all over where will we go?

When it's all over where will we go?
When it's all over where will we go?
When it's all over where will we go?
When it's all over where will we go?
",Calm After the Storm,2004
The Autumn Offering,"Every fuckin day I sacrifice myself
Making up for a dime the company can't afford
A professional button pusher
Craving the most valued resource we have
In a single serving

Leave dinner on the table, cause daddys comin home
Corruption ain't so bad after all
Routine self gratification
This parade has got to end
This parade has got to end

She bought a one way ticket
On a bullet train
Guess who will be waiting at the end of the line
This is just a test
This is just a test to prove you worthy

Witness the feast
As a lie here dying of starvation
Just sneak a lil taste
No one will ever notice

As I lean over the edge of this dock
I find myself wishing I knew how to swim
These waiting room walls are closing in
But the sweet smell of a rose
Helps me fight this urge

Untouched, sealed up in mint condition
A pretty pre-wrapped package waiting to be torn apart
Innocence is lost, it was overrated anyway
Let me enlighten you with my touch

Leave it on the table, cause daddys comin home
It ain't so bad after all
Routine self gratification
This parade has got to end

",Deflowered,2004
The Autumn Offering,"It begins, from the sky comes a king of terror
The sky will burn at forty five degrees
Fire approaches the great new city
Who will be saved?

Twin brothers torn apart by chaos
While the fortress endures
Great leader will succumb
He'll be the death of us all

We are not a nation, we are doomed generation
We are not a nation, we are doomed generation
War, war

A new holy war, prophesied for hundreds of years
Spawns from the deaths of the attacks
Solider raining fire and aid on innocence
If only we could be aware

Never will we see the day
When decency will prevail
God have mercy on our souls
We've always been destined to fail

We are not a nation, we are doomed generation
We are not a nation, we are doomed generation
Now, now

As I look around I see our world begin to crumble apart
As poison rains from the skies
And our flesh begins to burn
I look around and realize there's nowhere to turn

In the city of God there will be a great thunder
Twin brothers torn apart by chaos
While the fortress endures
Our great leader will succumb

And the third great war will begin
When the great city is burning
And the world will end soon after

The Autumn Offering,"And I won't sit back and watch anymore
While all the fallacies and lies become to much to handle
You're on a train that's heading off its tracks
Back up, sit back and watch the flames dance

Through the times that we were friends
Truth has been skin deep like glass in the wounds
One and the same, so save that precious breath
Before you shatter like the rest

I'll, I'll watch you choke on this
Watch you choke on all the promises
After all the hallowed words you spoke
Many are blind to see the reality of what is happening

I'll watch you choke, I'll watch you choke
Before it has a chance to be fed to someone else
I'll watch you choke, I'll watch you choke
Take a deep breath, it will be your last

Burn me

From here on out our lives reflect the shattered glass
Just another painful reminder of a distant hateful past
Fly away with the fire, with the fire
Fly away with the fire

So shut your mouth, look in the mirror
And bite your forked tongue, before the ink begins to dry
After all the trials we have fought amongst ourselves
The time has come to sit back and watch you fall

Through the times that we were friends
Truth has been skin deep like glass in the wounds
One and the same, so save that precious breath
Before you shatter like the rest

The Autumn Offering,"There's no coming home, when you're on the way to the end
Say our last goodbyes, holding in all that we can
And we both know that I'm scared of leaving
There's no need to show it, just set me on my way

Here I kneel, screaming for an answer
While God, just turns his other cheek
As I move from this world
Realizing what was meant to be

Point me in the right direction
Let me wander until I find my reason
If you don't hear from me by this time tomorrow
Don't worry, 'cause it's all over

I'll have known what I died for
With hope, you will find your way without me
But don't give up until you find that reason
I'll be watching over you all, with a deaf ear to your cries

There's no coming home, when you're on the way to the end
Say our last goodbyes, holding in all that we can
And we both know that I'm scared of leaving
There's no need to show it, just set me on my way

",Last Desperado,2004
The Autumn Offering,"Tragic
Is the world and it's ever pressing changing ways
Distorted melodies and drug influenced dreams
All of my miseries
Area changing me
Wrap me up inside of everything
What I want to be I can never be
I just want to satisfy you
And be the way you want me to
Lullabies and candy canes
A stagnant flow of error
Nothing can be done to satisfy everyone
But in a world of precious pain and beautiful memory
Can you see me in the way
Of everyone and everything
Wrap me up inside of you
What I want to be I can never be
I just want to satisfy your precious heart
And be the person I don't feel I could ever be
Such a small little voice
I mean nothing to you
My existence so vulnerable ( you know it's true )
Terror, malice, fear, and inflammatory hate
Nothing compares to the feelings I hold for you
The world is so full of deceit and lies that I can't seem to sympathize
With all these fucked up people and their ways
Your so beautiful and sensitive
Nothing seems so perfect in my eyes
And nothing seems so right
Wrap me up inside of you
What I want to be I can never be
I just want to satisfy your precious heart
And be the person I don't feel I could ever be
Can you feel my love
Reaching out to you
Can you feel the pain
Of what I've been through
I've seen so many people treat my feelings like a play thing
Tearing me apart with their words
As this faithful day has come
I speak to you and you won't seem to
And it's just another day to me
Constant affliction gets to me
I don't know what I want to be
I can't tell you what I mean
You mean everything to me
I don't mean shit to me
Wrap me up inside of you
What I want to be I can never be
I just want to satisfy your precious heart
And be the person I don't feel I could ever be
Drug induced dreams
Narcotic hallucinations ease the pain
Isolate me
Isolate me from everything
Wrap me up inside of you
What I want to be I can never be
I just want to satisfy your precious heart
And be the person I don't feel I could ever be

The Autumn Offering,"Time after time, I've been deflected from your life
Now the time has come to end your reign
Time after time, I've let myself be stepped on
Calling forth, I scream out, my cries go unheard

Anguish and agony, brought on now through all I know
Intangible, it seems, but I'll find my way

You were never there for me to pick me up when I fell
I was never the one to think of you for help
In the end, we'll never see eye to eye
This is how it will be, no matter what you say

Shadows fall over us but I am left reflecting
I'm lost, so fucking lost
Running, trying to find the light at the end
Make it through this world, I'll make it through this world

Anguish and agony, brought on now through all I know
Intangible, it seems, but I'll find my way

You were never there for me to pick me up when I fell
I was never the one to think of you for help
In the end, we'll never see eye to eye
This is how it will be, no matter what you say

This life is all I know
Hide in myself

Choking upon this guilty deed of mine
Home on the floor, you can hit me once more
Will power is dead and gone

Confined
This guilty deed of mine
My life, I'll decay before my time
Confined

Just sit back and watch it all
I can't be what you want from me
Regret has set
And sank its teeth in me

Into the skin, not knowing when I will win
Bruised body is all I hold
It's not my choice, I have no grip on this
Blinded by light, always losing my fight
Just crumble and lose it all

You know, you know what I mean
Can you, can you, save me now?
Help me from falling down

Embrace the gutter, cut up another
These little white pills won't kill you now

These little white pills won't kill you now

I'll try so hard to change from day to day.
Falling back is all I know.
This book is broken upon, the time of death is chosen.
Falling down, no turning back now.
I've tried so hard through the years, I tried so hard but only failed.

It all repeats the same.

The crying, screaming, loss for words
Your money remains.
All I ask for is a piece of mind.

You play your part,
The victim at heart
Once more repeats the same
The yearning keeps burning

That cut me to the bone?

To drown in my own fears
Darkness cover me tonight
I'm trapped in your shadows
I'm broken by sorrow

love will be denied to me
We're at the ending of our travels
Her bitter words I bleed
The grains of our spent lives
The sands are shifting downward
Killing what I cannot have

let me melt away the lies
Let me take away your soul
I can't make you real

Know enough

Just like the waves
Are you feeling, feeling, feeling like I'm, feeling
Like I'm floating, floating, up above that big blue ocean
Sand beneath our feet, big blue sky above our heads
No need to keep the stressing from our everyday life on our minds
We have got to leave all that behind

Well, I have got a sister
And she has got a baby with brand new eyes
And her daddy is an engineer
And they just took her to the sea for the first time
Now they're under, under, underneath a big umbrella
Summer, summer, summer time to help us forget, nine to fives
We have got to leave all that behind

I have worries to give to the sea
We can walk dear the pier is farther than it seems

Midnight at the shoreline, fireworks above us
A screaming bloom
They're sent by some teenager and kid whoever you are

The Avett Brothers,"November came and went, 
Like a summer that I spent, 
With a no name girl that walked in jelly shoes. 
I returned to my home, 
With a heart part made of stone, 
And I cried all night for a girl I never knew. 
From the east it comes, 
Her love and the rising sun, 
And I pray each time they come, it's not the last. 
You see I've got strong, 
I made it through what came along, 
But I can't move on for the beauty of the past. 

Came across a pretty girl, 
For about a month she was my world, 
And I held her hand, and swore we'd never part. 
I moved on, she stayed behind, 
I said I'd call, she said she'd write, 
We lost touch the moment I drove off. 
I left town like a gambler with, 
The sense of cashin' all the chips, 
Before I lost them all on a bad deal. 
I made believe I was in a race, 
Drove ten thousand miles in seven days, 
While writing a book called ""Being A Free Man"". 
Met more people than the president, 
The good times came and the good times went, 
And I learned how to ignore my hunger pangs. 
I looked ahead to the open road, thought about the people and what they know, 
And wrote a book called ""People Don't Know Nothin"". 
(no matter what they tell ya, man) 

Once I spent my last dime, 
And counted the ratio of miles to time, 
I looked up to my disdain and my surprise. 
I had driven my car around the world, 
Ended back in the town with the girl, 
So I wrote a book called ""Life in Prison"". 
(Volume. 1) 
I see that girl every now and then, 
And we drink to having such good friends, 
And apologize for the way it did not last. 
Funny thing that it's all true, 
And I'll always love November Blue, 
But I turned her down for the beauty of the past.

Oh how I wish that was enough to have made me want to stay
See I'm as true as I want to be and I must say my girl
I tried the best to give to you all of the truest in the world

But when I left your house that morning in that ragged Thunderbird
I tried so hard to fight the voices from the devil's that I heard
See there's a highway to the right of us I took it a year ago
And since a year ago can't drive past, without turning down that road

And I knew it,
I never should have turned the wheel
And I knew it,
The voices calling me were real
I knew it
Listen to the song they sing
I knew I was wrong
And I knew I was wrong

So give me a try at describing just how difficult it is

Stumble away from your stairway with your perfume on my clothes

And I knew it,
I never should have turned the wheel
And I knew it,
The voices calling me were real

And if I could gather up the damage that I rendered in my life

Readin' and writin' and readin' and thinkin' 
And searching for reasons and missing the seasons.

Up with caffeine and down with a shot.

Remember one time I got raging drunk with you 

Now, I can recall a time when we made the city
Streets our playground, kissing in the fountains
Filled with cigarettes and bottles
Sped through Italian city streets of cobblestone

Because we had to
Because I loved you
Because the damned alcohol
Because what ever at all

Now I've grown to aware of my mortality
To let go and forget about dying
Long enough to drop the hammer down
And let the indolence go wild and flying through

""No one here cares if you go or you stay
I barely even noticed that you were away
I'll see you or I won't, whatever""

Love sings a song as she sails through the sky
The water looks bluer through her pretty eyes
And everyone knows it whenever she flies
And also when she comes down

Hate keeps his head up and walks through these streets
Every stranger and drifter he greets
And shakes hands with every loner he meets
With a serious look on his face

Love arrives safely with suitcase in tow
Carrying with her the good things we know
A reason to live and a reason to grow
To trust and to hold and to care

Hate sits alone on the hood of his car
Without much regard to the moon or the stars
Lazily killing the last of a jar
Of the strongest stuff you can drink

Love takes a taxi, a young man drives
As soon he sees her hope fills his eyes
But tears follow after at the end of the ride
Because he might never see her again

Patience, patience, patience

Hate gets home lucky to still be alive
He screams over the sidewalk and into the drive
The clock in the kitchen says 2:55
And the clock in the kitchen is slow

Love has been waiting patient and kind
Just wanting a phone call or some kind of sign
That the one that she cares for who's out of his mind
Will make it back safe to her arms

Hate stumbles forward and leans in the door
Weary head hung down, eyes to the floor
He says, ""Love, I'm sorry,"" and she says, ""What for?

She was a level headed dancer on the road to alcohol
And I was just a soldier on the way to Montreal
Well, she pressed her chest against me
About the time the jukebox broke
She gave me a peck on the back of the neck
And these are the words she spoke

Blow up your T.V., throw away your paper
Move to the country, build you a home
Plant a little garden, eat a lot of peaches
Try to find Jesus on your own

So I sat there at the table and I acted real naive
'Cause I knew that topless lady
Had something up her sleeve
Well, she danced around the bar room
And she did the hoochy-coo
She sang her song all night long, tellin' me what to do

Blow up your T.V., throw away your paper
Move to the country, build you a home
Plant a little garden, eat a lot of peaches
Try to find Jesus on your own

Well, I was young and hungry and about to leave that place
When just as I was leavin', well she looked me in the face
I said, \""You must have the answer\""
\""She said, \""No but I'll give it a try\""
And to this very day we've been livin' our way
And here is the reason why

We blew up our T.V., threw away our paper
Moved to the country, built us a home
Had a lot of children, fed 'em on peaches
They all found Jesus on their own

I was almost there when I found you.
Sooner then my fate was wrote
Perfectly it slit my throat
And beads of lust released into the air.
When I awoke you were standing there.

The sky around was anything but blue.
I found as I regained my feet
A wound across my memory
That no amount of stitches would repair.

There's no returning to the spoils
Once you've spoiled the thought of them.

My trust has dwindled down
And I can leave here just as abruptly as I came here.

The Awakening,"Hello darkness my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dares
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools,"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",The Sounds of Silence (Splintered Version 2002),2006

The Aztecs,"I told the brook
That runs down through the valley
A secret my best friend never knew
The brook told the trees
And the trees told the breeze
That I was in love with you
The breeze told the clouds
Hiding there by a hill top
The clouds told the moon
That shone above
So angry and blue 
When they found out
That you and and your god
Had another love
The brook became angry
And changed to a river
Rushing so madly along
A soft summer breeze 
That played tag with the trees
Became so wild and so strong
The bashful white clouds 
Hiding there by a hill top
Dark and the rain 
Came falling down
There hearts couldn't hide
All the tears that were cried
And he tossed them upon the ground
The storm passed on over
There's sunshine again
The change that held 
Me are now gone
The trees wave hello
As I stand here below
And the brook 
Sings the sweetest song

Are once again by the hilltop

Are still my friends

Be no more heartaches for me

I gotta free my mind, free my mind
Yeah? I gotta free my mind, free my mind

From sand docks to auction blocks to R&B
From hip-hop, how many rappers flip-flop to get props?
Signed the dotted line but didn't read through the costs
(When your album sits on the desk) ""That's when ya lost!""
Followed your label's notion no promotion now you're audi
And that's the type of moves that make an artist act rowdy
Emcees fallin victim to financial, seduction
Then watchin creative weight extracted, like liposuction
Your A and R like see'n'are got many styles to suit ya
But if it's false to me I've never been an ass smoocher
Since I don't brainwash minds, with talkin nines and
How I shoot ya, it seems no multi million dollar contract's
In my future, I could swallow the bait and get gassed
Like petroleum, but contracts break like Rock Steady
On linoleum, no wackin in my format, no Grammy awards
Rap over break loops and samples, no R&B chords
On a mission from God, to make the conscious souls nod
When I'm rhyming, I take tracks of coal and then
Compress em to a diamond, I'm in the mind state
To escalate, when all rappers participate
It's fate for rap to elevate

You're goin, downtown to leave your mark on the biz
You reminisce, you and your A&R was first friends
You got talent and you ain't afraid to splurge hip-hop
Better thrills than Jordan alley-oops the pill but still
Got verbals like murder, so call on Perry Mason
Twenty-five to life, is what I'm facing, for this fate's in
The element of fine print I've read it and overseen
By judgmental pompous ass phonetics, the critic
I'm still the rapper for the rhymes that he expresses
Or manifests, no frontin, I wrote the shit while blunted
Take control, don't be a fuckin fish on a pole
Label's will leave you murdered in a river with no soul
It's true, for what you say is what you do with the flow
For labels MC's come and they go, but B.U.M.S.
We leave our mark for hip-hop's devastation
In our strive to stay alive for my record's elevation

Yo, I had dreams but financially didn't have the means
Wore dirty jeans and bought hot sneaks from dopefiends
I know it's hard but three bucks (?) is real
Out here gats kill sellin crack stackin money to chill
And 57th in the summer's like a hand grenade
Taps on that ass because my block stay paid
I'm not afraid, after money's made I parlay
Uptown burk after work at the arcade
Addicted, to cash like kids to cotton candy
And had many ways to slide papes to my phalanges
Even in high school my teachers knew the half
Cause if I wasn't in class, I'm the restroom playin craps
Keepin my game on tight like menstraul cramps
Sellin twenty rocks for sixty knocks of food stamps
But now I'm on the up, no time to live foul
Concentrate on stayin straight, cause now I got a child
All the while, King Tech, put it in effect
Engineered it all the ears and produced by Fredwreck
for a sec, use your mind to process the data
My sound hits hard like a real Oakland Raider
Never been a playa hater or a Phi Kappa Beta
But if you, front on me now E-Vo' attack that ass later
Until my dyin day I make papes and parlay
I've traveled around the world but make my home in the Bay..

I was raised on this Eastside, the poor side of hell
Where all the crackfiends all dwell
Where the brothers sell knocks of twenty knocks on all spots
And get hemmed by track star Oakland (?) cops
I ran with a wild pack
Hard like Yukon trucks, with straps like backpacks
Stackin cash for the fun
I was nasty with my knucks cause I was taught when I was young
But shit, it's ninety-four ain't no fightin no more
I see blood all over the walls and niggaz on the floor
I'm mad dog - I'm tryin to make a leap like a frog
I wanted to do some new shit, write rhymes become a hit
I started off at CMT but that's another story G
A misconception of words, I had to cross to All City
Word life, now D-Wyze is stakin on the wife
I work hard for what I've gotten but I'm, still a little trife
Despite, the dope and violence, I love what I've done

Slapped myself out and started doin' the do

Cookin' that pork and I seen the mouse

You better be prepared 'cause I know I will

Before I let go

Since I'm pimping everybody wants my riches
And I can't keep my god for buying weed acting every time
I smoke constantly and can't flinch me
From committing the murders so I chill and puff the herb
Who gots my back nobody
If little giant gaudy laying niggas down at the homey's party
Always be goin crazy I guess we are being who we are
Really say the nigga gotta be a star
I gots to get mine and if I'm blasting its my destiny
If I die then it was meant to be intentionally
Worry stressing no guessing your profession
When the murder take place set yourself a tech 9

Told myself I'd get by without love

Could be wrong but it sure feels right

So happy that you're here with me

The Bachelors,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,1997

Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

The Bachelors,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",Sound of Silence,2008

Pablo: We only bring the best for her.
Tasha: Why? 'Cause I deserve it! 

Tyrone: We even come to fan her when she wants a gentle breeze, 
Austin: But she never says thank you and she never ever says please.
 
Tasha: I ask for snacks, 
My servants bring them.
I ask for drinks,

Austin: If she wants songs we'll even sing them.
Tasha: I've got the best servants in the kingdom.

You met the porpoise and me
No right, no wrong, selling a song
A name, whisper game

You better make up something quick
You're gonna burn, burn, burn, burn
Burn it to the wick, ooh, Barracuda

Swam without looking back
Made for the western pools

To hide from the dawn
The Rock-Olas fire
Burns on and on

And lifts her veil
With a voice like running water
She tells them her tale

The patrons all break down at the sight
Standing in the presence of Our Lady of Electric Light

Tiny plastic sabers
Piled high to my knees
Though the war rages on
I still find no enemies
They draw back the curtain
Are blinded by the dawn
And the shining Rock-Ola
Spins on and on

Better put me to the test

Someone called your name
In the streets I heard children laughing
They all sound the same

Wonder, could you ever know me
Know the reason why I live
Is there nothing you can show me
Life seems so little to give

Once I climbed up the face of a mountain
And ate the wild fruit there
Fell asleep until the moonlight woke me
And I could taste your hair

Isn't everybody dreaming
Then the voice I hear is real
Out of all the idle scheming
Can't we have something to feel

Once upon a time they used me indeed
Tomorrow never came
I could sing the sound of your laughter
Still I don't know your name

Must be some way to repay you
Out of all the good you gave
If a rumor should delay you

The Band,"Darkness at the break of noon
Shadows even the silver spoon
The handmade blade, the child's balloon
Eclipses both the sun and moon
To understand you know too soon
There is no sense in trying

Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
Suicide remarks are torn
From the fool's gold mouthpiece
The hollow horn plays wasted words
Proves to warn that he not busy being born
Is busy dying

Temptation's page flies out the door
You follow, find yourself at war
Watch waterfalls of pity roar
You feel to moan but unlike before
You discover that you'd just be
One more person crying

So don't fear if you hear
A foreign sound to your ear
It's alright, Ma, I'm only sighing

As some warn victory, some downfall
Private reasons great or small
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
To make all that should be killed to crawl
While others say don't hate nothing at all
Except hatred

Disillusioned words like bullets bark
As human gods aim for their mark
Made everything from toy guns that spark
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark
It's easy to see without looking too far
That not much is really sacred

While preachers preach of evil fates
Teachers teach that knowledge waits
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates
Goodness hides behind its gates
But even the president of the United States
Sometimes must have to stand naked

An' though the rules of the road have been lodged
It's only people's games that you got to dodge
And it's alright, Ma, I can make it

Advertising signs that con you
Into thinking you're the one
That can do what's never been done
That can win what's never been won
Meantime life outside goes on
All around you

You lose yourself, you reappear
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear
Alone you stand with nobody near
When a trembling distant voice, unclear
Startles your sleeping ears to hear
That somebody thinks they really found you

A question in your nerves is lit
Yet you know there is no answer fit to satisfy
Insure you not to quit
To keep it in your mind and not fergit
That it is not he or she or them or it
That you belong to

Although the masters make the rules
For the wise men and the fools
I got nothing, Ma, to live up to

For them that must obey authority
That they do not respect in any degree
Who despise their jobs, their destinies
Speak jealously of them that are free
Do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in

While some on principles baptized
To strict party platform ties
Social clubs in drag disguise
Outsiders they can freely criticize
Tell nothing except who to idolize
And then say God bless him

While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Gargles in the rat race choir
Bent out of shape from society's pliers
Cares not to come up any higher
But rather get you down in the hole that he's in

But I mean no harm nor put fault
On anyone that lives in a vault
But it's alright, Ma, if I can't please him

Old lady judges watch people in pairs
Limited in sex, they dare
To push fake morals, insult and stare
While money doesn't talk, it swears
Obscenity, who really cares
Propaganda, all is phony

While them that defend what they cannot see
With a killer's pride, security
It blows the minds most bitterly
For them that think death's honesty
Won't fall upon them naturally
Life sometimes must get lonely

My eyes collide head-on with stuffed graveyards
False gods, I scuff
At pettiness which plays so rough
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs
Kick my legs to crash it off
Say okay, I have had enough
What else can you show me

And if my thought-dreams could be seen
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine
But it's alright, Ma, it's life, and life only","It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)",1974

She rocked me kinda slow and easy

It's a long trip to Mexico

Eliza wait by the door
I can't stay here anymore, no, no

Then she took a pill
She washed her feet in the mud
She said look out son
You know, I just ordered a flood
For forty days and forty nights

Then I dropped my shoes
Eliza called my name
She said it looked to her

Like it's gonna rain
Then the cotton king
Came in chokin'
And the widow laughed and said
I ain't jokin'
Take once for all
She said now don't ya tease me
I just fell in love, boy
So rock me kinda slow and kinda easy
All day and all night

Sweet William said
With a drunken head
if I had a boat
I'd help why'all float

A shepherd on a hillside, while over my flock I bide
Oh a cold winter night a band of angels sing
In a dream I heard a voice saying ""fear not, come rejoice
It's the end of the beginning, praise the new born king""

Right below the star that shines on high

And other eyes have smiles tenderly
But still in peaceful dreams I see
That the road, the road leads back to you

Oh hey Georgia, ooh Georgia, no peace, no peace I find

Loved-ones forsaken,
They didn't give a damn.

End up an enemy
Over what went down on the Plains of Abraham.

Daniel, Daniel and the sacred harp,
Dancing through the clover.
Daniel, Daniel would you mind,
If I look it over.

I heard of this famous harp years ago back in my home town
But I sure never thought old Daniel be the one to come and bring it around
Tell me Daniel how the harp came into your possession.
Are you one of the chosen few who will march in the the procession?

And Daniel said,
The sacred harp was handed down, from father unto son,
And me not being related, I could never be the one.
So I saved up all my silver, and took it to a man,
Who said he could deliver the harp, straight into my hand.

Three years I waited patiently,
Till he returned with the harp from the sea of Galilee.
He said there is one more thing I must ask,
But not of personal greed.
But I wouldn't listen I just grabbed the harp,
And said take what you may need.

Now Daniel looked quite satisfied, and the harp it seemed to glow.
But the price that Daniel had really paid, he did not even know.
Back to his brother he took his troubled mind.
And he said dear brother I'm in a bind.
But the brother would not hear his tale,
He said Old Daniel's gonna land in jail.
So to his father Daniel did run,
And he said oh father what have I done.
His father said son you've given in, you know you won your harp,
But you lost in sin.

Then Daniel took the harp and went high on the hill,
And he blew across the meadow like a whippoorwill.
He played out his heart just the time to pass,
But as he looked to the ground, he noticed no shadow did he cast.

As true as the love

These old love letters
Well, I just can't keep
Cause like the gambler says
Read 'em and weep
And the dawn don't rescue me no more

Without your love I'm nothing at all
Like an empty hall it's a lonely fall
Since you've gone it's a losing battle
Stampeding cattle
They rattle the walls

And pretty soon a carnival on the edge of town

Our horse Jethro, well he went mad

To the Gulf of Mexico

And she told me just to come on by
If there's anything she could do

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Good luck had just stung me
To the race track I did go
She bet on one horse to win
And I bet on another to show

Odds were in my favor
I had him five to one
When that nag came around the track
Sure enough we had won

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

I took up all of my winnings
And I gave my little Bessie half
And she tore it up and blew it in my face
Just for a laugh

Now there's one thing in the whole wide world
I sure would like to see
That's when that little love of mine
Dips her doughnut in my tea

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Now me and my mate were back at the shack
We had Spike Jones on the box
She said, ""I can't take the way he sings
But I love to hear him talk""

To the bottom of my feet

And up north it's freezing cold
And this living off the road
Is getting pretty old

Tell her I'll be rolling in

Locals were up kicking and shaking on the floor
And the next thing I know
That Coyote's at my door
He pins me in a corner and he won't take ""No!""

He drags me out on the dance floor
And we're dancing close and slow
Now he's got a woman at home
He's got another woman down the hall
He seems to want me anyway
Why'd you have to get so drunk
And lead me on that way
You just picked up a hitcher
A prisoner of the white lines of the freeway

I looked a Coyote right in the face
On the road to Baljennie near my old home town
He went running through the whisker wheat
Chasing some prize down
And a hawk was playing with him
Coyote was jumping straight up and making passes
He had those same eyes - just like yours
Under your dark glasses
Privately probing the public rooms
And peeking through keyholes in numbered doors
Where the players lick their wounds
And take their temporary lovers
And their pills and powders to get them through this passion play

No regrets, Coyote
I just get off up aways
You just picked up a hitcher
A prisoner of the white lines on the freeway

Coyote's in the coffee shop
He's staring a hole in his scrambled eggs
He picks up my scent on his fingers
While he's watching the waitresses' legs
He's too fat from the Bay of Fundy
From Appaloosas and Eagles and tides
And the air conditioned cubicles
And the carbon ribbon rides
Are spelling it out so clear
Either he's going to have to stand and fight
Or take off out of here
I tried to run away myself
To run away and wrestle with my ego
And with this flame
You put here in this Eskimo
In this hitcher
In this prisoner
Of the fine white lines
Of the white lines on the free, free way",Coyote,1978

An' left me here facing the wall.
I'd sure like t' know
Why she did go,
But I can't get close t' her at all.

She said she would never forget.
But now mornin's clear,

Like some mystery,
It could even be like a myth.
Yet it's hard t' think on,
That she's the same one
That last night I was with.
From darkness, dreams're deserted,
Am I still dreamin' yet?
I wish she'd unlock
Her voice once an' talk,
'Stead of acting like we never have met.

If she ain't feelin' well,
Then why don't she tell
'Stead of turnin' her back t' my face?
Without any doubt,
She seems too far out
For me t' return t' her chase.
Though the night ran swirling an' whirling,
I remember her whispering yet.
But evidently she don't
An' evidently she won't,

I'd gladly confess
T' anything I might've tried.

I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run an' hide.

The Band,"Old Beale Street is coming down
Sweeties' Snack Bar, boarded up now
And Eagles The Tailor and the Shine Boy's gone
Faded out with ragtime blues
Handy's cast in bronze
And he's standing in a little park
With a trumpet in his hand
Like he's listening back to the good old bands
And the click of high heeled shoes
Old Furry sings the blues
Propped up in his bed
With his dentures and his leg removed
And Ginny's there
For her kindness and Furry's beer
She's the old man's angel overseer

Pawn shops glitter like gold tooth caps
In the gray decay
They chew the last few dollars off
Old Beale Street's carcass
Carrion and mercy
Blue and silver sparkling drums
Cheap guitars, eye shades and guns
Aimed at the hot blood of being no one
Down and out in Memphis Tennessee
Old Furry sings the blues
You bring him smoke and drink and he'll play for you
It's mostly muttering now and sideshow spiel
But there was one song he played
I could really feel

There's a double bill murder at the New Daisy
The old girl's silent across the street
She's silent, waiting for the wrecker's beat
Silent, staring are her stolen name
Diamond boys and satin dolls
Bourbon laughter, ghosts, history falls
To parking lots and shopping malls
As they tear down old Beale Street
Old Furry sings the blues
He points a bony finger at you and
""I don't like you""
Everybody laughs as if it's the old man's standard joke
But it's true
We're only welcome for our drink and smoke

W.C. Handy I'm rich and I'm fay
And I'm not familiar with what you played
But I get such strong impressions of your hey day
Looking up and down old Beale Street
Ghosts of the darktown society
Come right out of the bricks at me
Like it's a Saturday night
They're in their finery
Dancing it up and making deals
Furry sings the blues
Why should I expect that old guy to give it to me true
Fallen to hard luck
And time and other thieves
While our limo is shining on his shanty street

Then why don't she tell
'Stead of turnin' her back t' my face?

Make a man want to leave the only home he's known
Sailing out of the gulf headin' for Saint Pierre
Nothin' to declare

All we had was gone
Broke down along the coast
But what hurt the most
When the people there said

""You better keep movin' on""
Everlasting summer filled with ill-content
This government had us walkin' in chains
This isn't my turf

This ain't my season
Can't think of one good reason to remain
I've worked in the sugar fields up from New Orleans
It was ever green up until the floods

Points ya where you're goin'
Set my compass north

For a rusty tanker leaking oil, and the burning sun was on my back

And in the reddenin' twilight, I wondered would I ever return.

Ridin' on a river of dreams,
Broken dreams.
I'm ridin' on a river of dreams.
Amazon, Amazon,
Is it heaven or hell?
Amazon.

An eagle flew above us, I felt the breezes blow.
Fish with teeth like ivory, waited down below.
On shore they cut and hammered, and fenced them in with wire.
While ancient fires in the jungle, burned our souls like fire.

Ridin' on a river of dreams,
Somebody's dreams.
I'm ridin' on a river of dreams.
Amazon, Amazon,
Is it Heaven or hell ?
Amazon.

What kind of creature's gonna rise up from these ashes?
What's gonna fly in the moonlight feathers aglow?
What kind of rain could come in from these sorrows?
Nobody knows, nobody knows.

At dawn we crossed the rapids, a place where few men go.
I felt the desolation, where nothing seemed to grow.
When I got my wages, I hung my head and cried.
I could not stop these visions, that swept in like the tide.

Ridin' on a river of dreams,
Broken dreams.
I'm ridin' on a river of dreams.

Is it Heaven or hell ?

I'm just goin' down the road t' see Bessie Smith

Where it is you're really comin' from

Now in my day I've made some foolish moves
But back then, I didn't worry 'bout a thing
And now again I still wonder to myself
Was it her sweet love or the way that she could sing

And promised to return before the moon struck one

Julie came running through the pasture, she was screaming at the sky
She fell down to her knees and the tears did fly
Little John was stung by a snake over by the lake
And it looked like he s really, really hurt, he was lying in the dirt
Who, we went it as fast as we could run
But we lost little John as the moon struck one

Poison it or dam it
Fish in it and wash in it
Swim in it and you can die in it
Run, you river, run

No crystal mirror can show it clear, come over here instead
Son, you ain't never eased yourself

Don't you raise the sails anymore.

And I'm pushin' age seventy three;

Oh, to be home again,

Down in old Virginny,
With my very best friend,
They call him Ragtime Willie.
We're gonna soothe away the rest of our years,
We're gonna put away all of our tears,
That big Rockin' Chair won't go nowhere.

Slow down, Willie Boy,
Your heart's gonna give right out on you
It's true, and I believe I know what we should do.
Turn the stern and point to shore,
The seven seas won't carry us no more.

Down in old Virginny,
With my very best friend,
They call him Ragtime Willie.

Dip'n snuff, I won't have no care,

Hear the sound, Willie Boy,
The Flyin' Dutchman's on the reef.
It's my belief
We've used up all our time,
This hill's to steep to climb,
And the days that remain ain't worth a dime.
Oh, to be home again,
Down in old Virginny,
With my very best friend,
They call him Ragtime Willie.
Would-a-been nice just t'see the folks,
Listen once again to the stale jokes,
That big Rockin' Chair won't go nowhere.
I can hear something calling on me

And you know where I want to be
Oh Willie don't you hear that sound

Oh to be home again down in old Virginny
I just want to get my feet back on the ground

Called to me in a voice so soft and low

And then she faded like a rainbow

Her golden spaceship with the mother of the earth
Carved in stone, the queen of avatars
Where seventy children were given birth
She then returned back to the stars

The judge said, son, what is your alibi
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die
I spoke not a word, although it meant my life
I had been in the arms of my best friend's wife

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave where the night winds wail
Nobody knows, no, and nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

The sky froze high and eternity neared
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But sometimes at night when the cold wind moans
In a long black veil she cries over my bones

How the faithful was gathered to sing

Still down in a mournful rain.

I'll search for the one above me

He was in a bind
Cause he was way behind
And he was willin' to make a deal

Sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the devil jumped
Up on a hickory stump
And said boy let me tell you what

I guess you didn't know it
But I'm a fiddle player too
And if you care to take a dare I'll make a bet with you

Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy
But give the devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold
Against your soul
Cause I think I'm better than you

The boy said my name's Johnny
And it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet
And you're gonna regret
Cause I'm the best there's ever been

Johnny rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard
Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia and the devil deals the cards
And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose the devil gets your soul.

And he said I'll start this show
And fire flew from his fingertips
As he rosined up his bow

Then he pulled the bow across the strings
And it made a [sic] evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in
And it sounded something like this

When the devil finished
Johnny said well you're pretty good old son
Just sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done

Granny does your dog bite

Because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle
On the ground at Johnny's feet

If you ever want to try again
I done told you once you son of a gun

Sweeties' Snack Bar, boarded up now
And Eagles The Tailor and the Shine Boy's gone
Faded out with ragtime blues
Handy's cast in bronze
And he's standing in a little park
With a trumpet in his hand
Like he's listening back to the good old bands
And the click of high heeled shoes
Old Furry sings the blues
Propped up in his bed
With his dentures and his leg removed
And Ginny's there
For her kindness and Furry's beer
She's the old man's angel overseer

Pawn shops glitter like gold tooth caps
In the gray decay
They chew the last few dollars off
Old Beale Street's carcass
Carrion and mercy
Blue and silver sparkling drums
Cheap guitars, eye shades and guns
Aimed at the hot blood of being no one
Down and out in Memphis Tennessee
Old Furry sings the blues
You bring him smoke and drink and he'll play for you
It's mostly muttering now and sideshow spiel
But there was one song he played
I could really feel

There's a double bill murder at the New Daisy
The old girl's silent across the street
She's silent, waiting for the wrecker's beat
Silent, staring are her stolen name
Diamond boys and satin dolls
Bourbon laughter, ghosts, history falls
To parking lots and shopping malls
As they tear down old Beale Street
Old Furry sings the blues
He points a bony finger at you and
""I don't like you""
Everybody laughs as if it's the old man's standard joke
But it's true
We're only welcome for our drink and smoke

W.C. Handy I'm rich and I'm fay
And I'm not familiar with what you played
But I get such strong impressions of your hey day

Fallen to hard luck

The Band,"Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're tryin' to be so quiet?
We sit here stranded, though we're all doin' our best to deny it
And Louise holds a handful of rain, temptin' you to defy it
Lights flicker from the opposite loft
In this room the heat pipes just cough
The country music station plays soft
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind

In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key chain
And the all-night girls they whisper of escapades out on the ""D"" train
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight
Ask himself if it's him or them that's insane
Louise, she's all right, she's just near
She's delicate and seems like the mirror
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
That Johanna's not here
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place

Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously
And when bringing her name up
He speaks of a farewell kiss to me
He's sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all
Muttering small talk at the wall while I'm in the hall
How can I explain?
It's so hard to get on
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn

Inside the museums, infinity goes up on trial
Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues
You can tell by the way she smiles
See the primitive wallflower freeze
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze
Hear the one with the mustache say, ""Jeez, I can't find my knees""
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel

The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him
Sayin', ""Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him""
But like Louise always says
""Ya can't look at much, can ya man?""
As she, herself, prepares for him
And Madonna, she still has not showed
We see this empty cage now corrode
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
The fiddler, he now steps to the road
He writes ev'rything's been returned which was owed
On the back of the fish truck that loads
While my conscience explodes
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain",Visions of Johanna,2005

You know where I want to go
Straight down the Mississippi river
To the Gulf of Mexico
To Lake Charles Louisiana
Little Bessie, girl that I once knew
She told me just to come on by
If there's anything that she could do

Up on Cripple Creek, she sends me
If I spring a leak, she mends me
I don't have to speak, as she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Good luck had just stung me
To the race track I did go
She bet on one horse to win
And I bet on another to show
The odds were in my favor
I had 'em five to one
When that nag to win came around the track
Sure enough we had won

Up on Cripple Creek, as she sends me
If I spring a leak, as she mends me
I don't have to speak, as she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

I took up all of my winnings
And I gave my little Bessie half
And she tore it up and threw it in my face
Just for a laugh
Now there's one thing in the whole wide world
I sure would like to see
That's when that little love of mine
Dips her doughnut in my tea

Up on Cripple Creek, as she sends me
If I spring a leak, as she mends me
I don't have to speak, as she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Now me and my mate were back at the shack
We had Spike Jones on the box
She said, ""I can't take the way he sings
But I love to hear him talk""
Now that just gave my heart a throb
To the bottom of my feet
And I swore as I took another pull
My Bessie can't be beat

Up on Cripple Creek, as she sends me
If I spring a leak, as she mends me
I don't have to speak, as she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

As there's a flood out in California
And up North it's freezing cold
And this living on the road
Is getting pretty old
So I guess, I'll call up my big mama
Tell her I'll be rolling in
But you know, deep down
I'm kind of tempted
To go and see my Bessie again

If I spring a leak, she mends me

'Til Stoneman's cavalry came and tore up the tracks again
In the winter of '65, we were hungry, just barely alive
By May the tenth, Richmond had fell
It's a time I remember, oh so well

The night they drove old Dixie down
And the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the people were singing
They went, ""La, la, la""

Back with my wife in Tennessee, when one day she called to me
""Virgil, quick, come see, there go the Robert E.Lee""
Now I don't mind choppin' wood, and I don't care if the money's no good
Ya take what ya need and ya leave the rest
But they should never have taken the very best

And the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singing
They went, ""La, la, la""

Like my father before me, I will work the land
And like my brother above me, who took a rebel stand
He was just eighteen, proud and brave, but a Yankee laid him in his grave
I swear by the mud below my feet
You can't raise a Caine back up when he's in defeat

The night they drove old Dixie down
And the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singing
They went, ""Na, na, na""

No more walking the floor with that burning inside
Just to think it could be, time has opened the door
And at last I am free, I don't hurt anymore

No use to deny, I wanted to die the day you said we were through
But now that I find you're out of my mind I can't believe that it's true
I've forgotten somehow that I cared so before
And it's wonderful now, I don't hurt anymore

The Band,"They say ev'rything can be replaced,
Yet ev'ry distance is not near.
So I remember ev'ry face
Of ev'ry man who put me here.
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east.
Any day now, any day now,
I shall be released.

They say ev'ry man needs protection,
They say ev'ry man must fall.
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Some place so high above this wall.
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east.
Any day now, any day now,
I shall be released.

Standing next to me in this lonely crowd,
Is a man who swears he's not to blame.
All day long I hear him shout so loud,
Crying out that he was framed.
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east.
Any day now, any day now,
I shall be released.",I Shall Be Released [Restored Version] [Version],2014
The Band,"Everybody's building
The big ships and the boats
Some are building monuments
Others are jotting down notes

Everybody's in despair
Every girl and boy
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here
Everybody jump for joy

Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn

Now I like to dude, just like the rest
I left my sugar sweet
But darning fumes and making haste
It ain't my cup of meat

Everybody's just standin' around 'neath the trees
Feeding pigeons on a limb
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here
Then pigeons will go to him

Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn

[Incomprehensible]
I can recite 'em all
Just tell me where it hurts
And I'll tell you who to call

Nobody can get in his sleep
There's someone on everybody's toes
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here
Everybody's gonna doze

The Band,"Nothing was delivered
And I tell this truth to you
Not out of spite or anger
But simply because it's true
Now, I hope you won't object to this
Giving back all what you owe
The fewer words you have to waste on this
The sooner you can go.

Nothing is better, nothing is best
Take heed of this and get plenty of rest.

Nothing was delivered
But I can't say I sympathize
With what your fate is going to be
Yes, for telling all those lies
Now you must provide some answers
For what you sold has not been received
And the sooner you come up with them
The sooner you can leave.

Nothing is better, nothing is best
Take heed of this and get plenty of rest.

Now you know
Nothing was delivered
And it's up to you to say
Just what you had in mind
When you made ev'rybody pay
No, nothing was delivered
Yes, 'n' someone must explain
That as long as it takes to do this
Then that's how long that you'll remain
Nothing is better, nothing is best
Take heed of this and get plenty of rest.
