Lords of Acid,"Possess me

Disgrace me

These special moments

Convulsions

Agonising pain


Abuse me 

Mislise me

My soul is breaking

And aching

Good parental care

",Special Moments,1994
Lords of Acid,"Young Boys, charming and innocent
Adolescent fun
My toys, spectral virginity
I wanna watch them come
Hey boys, I'm a candybar
A tidbit for your tongue
Those boys with your chastity
I wanna be your very first one

Young boys, dressed up in leatherettes
I wanna make 'em shine
Come down to my special route
Number sixty-nine
My boy, shock me and thrill me
You know what I desire
You're hot, nasty and spicy
You'll have to quench my fire


Chorus :
Young boys, I want you to be my toys
I'm begging you please
Young boys, I'm down on my knees
Young boys, I'll take you to heaven
Boys


Young boys, soft and so kissable
I'm waiting for their touch
They're rough, that's why I like them
I wanna taste their fudge
Horny boys, youthful and healthy
Lovegun never stops
They come, it's unbelievable
Squeeze you till you drop

Young boys, part of a family
It's me that you can trust
Right now, give me physically
A boy to dim my lust
Their dads don't like it
They wan't me to themselves
Sweet boys, tasty and horny
I'll peel away their shell

",Young Boys,1994
Lords of Acid,"I'm all alone in my room
Just me & myself - me & my gorgeous body
And my fucked up brain...
We're thinking about all the precious moments we've had together
Thinking about the places we've been, the people we've met
The lovers that wandered in & out of our lives...
The ones we used and abused and then dumped, 'cause they don't understand us the way we do
No one can rip us apart... .

Let's face it girl, we don't need nobody else
We can do it all by ourselves
We're 2 in 1 in flesh & in blood
We share everything - everything we've got
We'll stay together - forever, forever & ever & ever!!
I know what you feel - I know what you
like, I know what to do to drive you wild. 
The more you want the more you
get, we're the same - we like it wet ! !
Oh yeah - oh ! ! !

We're all alone in the room
Just me & myself - me & my hungry body
And my lusty brain
We're thinking about what we want to do together
And before you know it we're doing stuff you can only Imagine ... & dream

Let's face it girl, we don't need nobody else
We can do it all by ourselves
We're 2 in 1 in flesh & in blood

Martians don't give me the kicks 
There's just no kick 
With a little dick

Horny sex machines 
In their dildo ship 
That looked really hip and cool 
But I'm no fool 
They showed their tools ha ha ha

She stares at the ceiling when she's in her bed
She empties a bottle and dreams away
About her childhood in the good ol' days

Lords of Acid,"When I was a kid I was a lazy child
Always skipping school, I was really wild
My poor old dad, he went insane
'cause of his little bitch and her love with pain
So my daddy, he spanked my butt
He turned me into his super spanky slut
I begged him for his mercy with tears in my eyes
He didn't know that he just showed me paradise
Then I met my boyfriend, he was almost 85
Crawling on the floor he knew all about life
I was feeling horny and just couldn't resist
I had to have him beat me with his manly fist
I started bleeding badly, love at first strike
Since that romantic moment I crawled by his side
But just the other day I hit him right back
The poor old bastard got himself a heartattack
Now I'm a little older and addicted to the whip
When I'm chained to the wall I feel mighty hip
Rings in my nipples, metal in my cheeck
I'm the queen of the club, I look really chique

Some good ol'fashioned beating, can't get enough
I still beg my dad on my two bare knees
Oh cruel daddy, come and spank me please

That our love would last forever, forever 
Last night I went insane 
When I heard you call her name
If you'd go away baby

I could never stand the pain

Weird thoughts running through my brain
My blood is pumping through my vains
And there she sits, she looks at me
Her skin is pale, her mind is free
She smiles and says: how do you do?
Come with me or should I go with you?
Hey baby, you'd better watch out
You don't know what you're doing
When you're out and about
Hey baby, now listen to me
Things are never ever quite as they seem
She asks me for a cigarette
Her eyes are bright, her hair is red
Dressed like a whore, but one with style
A fantasy, I realise
This is no fiction, it's insane
Her make-up shows she knows the game
And who am I to tell her no
So I grab her coat and say let's go
Hey baby, you'd better watch out
You don't know what you're doing
When you're out and about
Hey baby, now listen to me
Things are never ever quite as they seem
She takes me to her penthouse bed
To relax my body and feed my head
With stories I never heard before
I'm waiting 'cause I know there's more
She takes off all her clothes and see
This girl has hairy legs like me
This may sound a little rude
I want sex but not with a dude

But I feel these vibrations and it's feeling so nice
The warmth of his body, the heat of the flesh
I'm fighting against it while I strip off my dress
I want you inside of me (x2)
I can visualise what you're feeling inside
As I'm touching your spine, I can make you unwind
Feel the glow from my hands, it's the heat that I send
With the oil that I blend, let's go straight, let's go to the end
Come through the mirror I want you to rock me
I'll give you the power, the will to be horny
I need you to fill me with your glistening treasures
My body is moist and it's a palace of pleasure
Lay down beside me, then torture and please me
Let's have a party all over my body
Let's come together like the pearl in the oyster
You can whip me and bite me cause that's how I want ya
I want you inside of me (x2)
(x2)
I'm your teacher tonight, witches' power delight
There's no use for your fight, let me strengthen your might
Oh now come over here, 'cause your climax is near
There's no use for your fear 'cause your master, your master is here

Now hold it let me choose, couldn't be the booze
No it's the shoes (the shoes) It's gotta be the shoes!
'Cause girlies, they clock, they stand around and jock
so I say boom shaka lak, grab the microphone then rock
To tell you the truth, when on the mic
I'll say anything that sounds good
Like jump and a grump and sound over some uh?
The Cat in the Hat and the mouse ran up the stairs
""That doesn't make no sense!"" c'mon who cares?
See even without the gift there's yours so don't be tryin' to knock me
I say what I want to say, as long it sounds funk

And now I got the flav to make the crowd go wild

I'm nearly knocking boots, but if not I'll knock teeth
Wahh! Gaga, ooh cries the baby
Smacked on the ass now the Doitall's crazy
No rattles or playpens, the crowds what I'm rapping
And yes I do Reruns, as if this boy was happening
Now January 14th has birthed the funk one
The D-Day for Dupree and yes I'm funk-ay
I got you bobbing to the funky style

Here to kick my funky style, funky this and funky that
You can work kid you know, you could practice all your life
But I still take the show and then I go home with the wife
Oh my God, funky with the style, Lord have mercy

Watch me flip the script, let me show you what the funk do
Make you call me uncle (What?) Uncle (What?) Uncle (Who?)

Now it's time to get buckwild
And watch my funky brothers freak the underground
In a second, or minute, in no times flat
(Flatline noise) Bring it back
And go grab the album to give the Lords money
Take it home to mom to say ""Ain't they funky?""

They didn't affect me, I said ""So what?"" I kept on writing rhymes
I keep my funky style perfected so no one can stop my flow
I fear no man, cause if it's on fool, then it's on (And it's on)
Don't worry not for other crews selling out
As long as Lords of the Underground stay underground
The brothers of LOTUG will keep the lyrical fitness
Don't worry about me selling out, mind your business

We're hit when we dry crawl and hit rock 'n' roller
I'm caught in the swinging, hear no ties by the Pendulum
Just? so this is how I'm killing them
K is on the M.P., Jazz is on the Technique
Marley's on the mix and now the Lords have a hit like POW
Now it's time to get buckwild
And watch my funky brothers freak the underground
In a second, or minute, in no times flat
(Flat line noise) Bring it back
And go grab the album to give the Lords money
Take it home to mom to say ""Ain't they funky?""

We gone psycho and everybody thought they did was styles
They didn't affect me, I said ""So what?"" I kept on writing rhymes
I keep my funky style perfected so no one can stop my flow
I fear no man, cause if it's on fool, then it's on (And it's on)
Don't worry not for other crews selling out
As long as Lords of the Underground stay underground
The brothers of Lotug will keep the lyrical fitness
Don't worry about me selling out, mind your business
You might say ""Damn, Mr. Funkee's throwing out""
But if you listen to the words then you'll know what I'm about
Any props you receive are the props that you earn
I'm off till the funky child returns",Psycho,1993
Lords of the Underground,"Verse One:

Well, I'm gonna creep through your area with steps that are slowly
Camoflauged and in black so niggas they don't know that
While niggas givin hi's I'm givin goodbye's
I'm still shooting persons out the corners of my eyes
But brothers know nothin and ain't seen nothin
But best yet the fest when I leave knots in their stomachs
So who want to have a little shindig with me?
Well, bro, you got it, until the return of Funky
'cause I'm that brother who was born in the under
And if you don't believe that then go ask my mutha
'cause when it gets hot I ignite what I got
Just to let you know that I blow up the spot

[CHORUS]

Verse 2:

I have an attitude that's shitty but don't need no pity
'cause all I want to do is get down to the nitty
So watch every move as I step up on this groove
My voice is filled with madness, and not ment to sooth
Say the name Doitall, say it backwards [llatiod]
Say it one more time and I'll appear by your side
My voice'll drop a measure and your ears'll feel the pleasure
You'll here my tongue lashing because my tongue is like leather
Now I be from the land where the crooks be grand
And the boys grow up to be the Stickyfinger man
Now I got you straight from the block known to rock you
But just like I got you some day you want the Do
I smell a sniff, can it be the Funkyman approachin?
Well I'ma keep roastin on behalf of the Lords
I swear to my G, I have unity, my crew have unity and this is me
Now who be I when I be that fly guy from NJ?
Some say Doitall, but my real name is Dupre
The ghetto type heart is sparked by the horror
I creep at the corner while you search for tomorrow
Tomorrow, tomorrow, they love me tomorrow 
Words I usually hear 'cause I have hip-hop by the collar
Underground the meaning:  below, beneath
That's what they think of us rhymin on these beats
Rap music - can't hear it, peep it, or speak it
That's why a Grammy, I'll probably never see it
So who in the public does the Doitall trust?
The Lords, the Lord, until my heart busts
So remember, L.O.T.U.G. is forever
You dis one, you dis the other
You dis the other, you dis the under
And you don't ever want to dis the under.

[CHORUS]",Steam from da Knot,1994
Lords of the Underground,"Tic toc, this is how we rock

Tic toc, this is how we rock
We're those same (um) brothers that brought you ""chief rock""
Now, um, underground's my style
To this I have vows
And I swear to my god
I'll always rock a crowd
So (um) peace to my area, n.w.k.
Which is scarier
So if your on the deals,
Who cares, the more the merrier
Now right off south orange
On the block of one-nine
Of course, thirteenth ave
Is my stomping grounds
I open up my chest
And to my 'hood give my heart
'cause without the heart
Then your 'hood falls apart
So respect to the cement
The park called ""the corner""
'cause that's where the doitall two was performing
Runnin' from the cops
I couldn't be stopped
'cause I was jumpin' big gates that connected the blocks
Now before making records
The 'hood was my savior
But now I'm making tunes to make you jam wit 'cha neighbor

Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and do it for your block (um)

Throw your hands in the air and please don't stop (um)

Well, I be the funk-ular
Ultra-funk-ular
Gamma-funk-ular
Half you rappers out there couldn't see me with binoculars
Anyone who thinks he'll take me out is just a dreamer
If you think you're the bomb, then I'm hiroshima
When I die,
I hope they're making records up in heaven
On a scale of one to ten
I'm like 100-5th-11
And sticks-and-stones-may-break-my-bones
But if you ever try to dis the lords, then it's on
I go on beat
Off beat
Then jump right back on time
I drop another rhyme
And talk about your fat ugly mama
M.c.'s cannot rock me
I'm stone-proof
Me grabbin' the mic
Is like superman running to a phone booth
Straight from martin luther king boulevard
In the heart of newark, new jersey
Make you say ""lord have mercy""
If you step up in my face
Then it's do or die
And I'm gonna make you cry!

Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and do it for your block (um)
Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and please don't stop (um)
Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and represent your block (um)
Tic toc, this is how we rock
(tic toc, you don't stop)

Well, times have changed
Not only for the urban
But also for suburban
We get props, we're deservin'
From black kids, to white kids
I see them bob their heads,
From the blond hair, to redhead
I even seen a dread
So now it doesn't matter
As the clock winds down
With the tic and the toc
Because they love the sound
But people 'round your area
Say you sell out
Because you sell a million copies
And your tour goes baow
So do it for yourself
And do it for the 'hood
But do it from the heart
'cause that's when it's good
Now tell me what's gonna happen
After the rappin'
When the clock  ticks away
And ain't nothin' happenin'

I remember way back in the days on my block
When the kids used to meet up in the hallway and rock
On martin luther king's boulevard
With p.c., wise, easy ed, and my brother hard bernard
Used to hit the ill rhymes from the head
While I'd hit the beat on the wall until my hands turned red
You had the shorty two m.c.'s
The educated three
I have to give them props for helping me be me
Now I'm the one who's educated
I suffered but I made it
I only write rhymes that will be appreciated
No matter how large I get
The fire still burns
'cause from the 'hood I came
And to the 'hood I must return

Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and do it for your block (um)

Throw your hands in the air and please don't stop (um)

And Orange Krush became amazed over me
Took me inside of his Cadillac
The chauffeur drove off and we never came back

And now they got me rockin' on the microphone
Then takin' autographs, and here's the laugh
Champagne caviar, and bubble bath

Lordz of Brooklyn," 

[Verse One: performed by ADMoney]
Listen up here's a tale about a white kid
That had to make some cash
Dropped out of school ain't never went to class
Sold a little grass, robbed a couple cars
Had a name around the neighborhood for fightin' in the bars
Had a chip on his shoulder
He's a chip off the block
When he drinks, he drinks alone
Grabbed the whiskey took a swig
Heard the fiddle didn't jig
Cause he's watchin' everybody round him blowin' up gettin' big
So he picks out a ride, slim jims the door
Now he's runnin' red lights and beatin' stop signs
Cops are on his ass and he's runnin' out of time
So he hits the chop shop, makes drop, cause he's sick of bein' poor
He's white trash and he's knockin' on your door

[Pre Chorus]
Somebody's knockin' at my door, somebody's ringin' my bell

[Chorus]
I'm white trash and I'm knockin' on your door
White Trash and I'm knockin' on your door
White Trash and I'm knockin' on your door
I know you hear me knockin' so what you hidin' for

[Verse Two: performed by ADMoney]
He ain't never joined the, he ain't no altar boy
He's an angel with a dirty face like Pretty Boy Floyd
He's the kind a kid sittin' in the park if you want to cop a lid
And if he got popped he wouldn't rat he do the bid
Cause he's tuff like rugby down right ugly
If you owe him money you'll be black and blue and bloody
From his tenement slum right down to the gutter
He might run a number, sell some iron to the brothers
Cause the cops beat him down and it doesn't make the news
But to him that's payin' dues when you're walkin' in his shoes

[Pre Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: performed by ADMoney]
It's just another night in the old gin mill
He got a pocket of old dirty dollar bills
He buys his boys a round, they toast it up, they shoot it down
They're gettin' stared at by some off duty cops sittin' down
So what you lookin' at you want to catch a smack
He finishes his beer and his boys take his back
And they mix it up, they're brawlin' on the ground
The cop pulls his pistol and fires off a round
Yo he should of got a job, should of went to class
Now he's layin' all alone, still poor white trash

Nine months and better
He fairly won my heart
Wrote me a letter
With his hammer in his hand
He looked quite clever
And if I was with my love
I'd live forever.

But where is my love gone
With his cheeks like roses
And his good black Billycock on
Decked round with primroses
I'm afraid the scorching sun
Will shine and burn his beauty
And if I was with my love
I'd do my duty.

Strange news is coming to town
Strange news is carried
Strange mews flies up and down
That my love is married.
I wish them both much joy
Though they can't hear me
And may God reward him well
For the slighting of me.

Don't you remember when
You lay beside me
And you said you'd marry me
And not deny me
If I said I'd marry you
It was only for to try you
So bring your witness love
And I'll not deny you.

No witness have I none
Save God Almighty
And may he reward you well
For the slighting of me

It made a poor heart tremble
To think she loved a one
And be proved deceitful.

But one has a sorrow
That never was said

That my true love came in

To the waters and the wild
With a faery hand in hand
For the world's more full of weeping
Than you can understand

Where the wave of moonlight glosses
The dim grey sands with light
By far off furthest roses
We foot it all the night
Weaving olden dances
Mingling hands and mingling glances
Till the moon has taken flight
To and fro we leap
And chase the frothy bubbles
Whilst the world is full of troubles
And is anxious in its sleep.

[Chorus]

Where the wandering water gushes
From the hills above glen car
In pools among the rushes
That scarce could bathe a star
We seek for slumbering trout
And whispering in their ears
Give them unquiet dreams
Leaning softly out
From ferns that drop their tears
Over the young streams

[Chorus]

Away with us he's going
The solemned eyed
He'll hear no more the lowing
Of the calves on the warm hillside
Or the kettle on the hob
Sing peace unto his breast
Or see the brown mice bob
Round and round the oatmeal chest.

[Chorus]

For he comes, the human child
To the waters and the wild
With a faery hand in hand
For the world's more full of weeping
Than you can understand.",Stolen Child,1985

By your leave we shall sing, concerning our King. 

Our King is well-dressed in silks of the best
In ribbons so rare no king can compare. 

We have traveled many miles over hedges and stiles,
In search of our King unto you we bring.

We have cannon and ball to conquer them all.

Loreena McKennitt,"Come all you lads and lasses, I'd have you give attention
To these few lines I'm about to write here,
Tis of the four seasons of the year that I shall mention,
The beauty of all things doth appear.
And now you are young and all in your prosperity,
Come cheer up your hearts and revive like the spring
Join off in pairs like the birds in February
That St. Valentines D'ay it forth do bring.

Then cometh Spring, which all the land doth nourish;
The fields are beginning to be decked with green,
The trees put forth their buds and the blossoms they doflourish,
And the tender blades of corn on the earth are to be seen.
Don't you see the little lambs by the dams a-playing?
The cuckoo is singing in the shady grove.
The flowers they are springing, the maids they go a-Maying,
In love all hearts seem now to move.

Next cometh Autumn with the sun so hot and piercing;
The sportsman goes forth with his dog and his gun
To fetch down the woodcock, the partridge and the pheasant,
For health and for profit as well as for fun.
Behold, with loaded apple-trees the farmer is befriended,
They will fill up his casks that have long laid dry.
All nature seems to weary now, her task is nearly ended,
And more of the seasons will come by and by.

When night comes on with song and tale we pass the wintryhours;
By keeping up a cheerful heart we hope for better days.
We tend the cattle, sow the seed, give work unto the ploughers,
With patience wait till winter yields before the sun's fairrays.
And so the world goes round and round, and every time andseason
With pleasure and with profit crowns the passage of the year,
And so through every time of life, to him who acts with reason,
The beauty of all things doth appear.",The Seasons,1987
Loreena McKennitt,"Good people all, this Christmas-time,
Consider well and bear in mind
What our good God for us has done
In sending his beloved Son.
With Mary holy we should pray
To God with love this Christmas day;
In Bethlehem upon that morn
There was a blessed Messiah born.

The night before that happy tide
The noble Virgin and her guide
Were long time seeking up and down
To find a lodging in the town.
But mark how all things came to pass;
From every door repelled alas!
As long foretold, their refuge all
Was but an humble ox's stall.

There were three wise men from afar
Directed by a glorious star,
And on they wandered night and day
Until they came where Jesus lay,
And when they came unto that place
Where our beloved Messiah was,
They humbly cast them at his feet,
With gifts of gold and incense sweet.

Near Bethlehem did shepherds keep
Their flocks of lambs and feeding sheep;
To whom God's angels did appear,
Which put the shepherds in great fear.
'Prepare and go', the angles said.
'To Bethlehem, be not afraid:
For there you'll find, this happy morn,
A princely babe, sweet Jesus born.

With thankful heart and joyful mind,
The shepherds went the babe to find,
And as God's angel had foretold,
They did our saviour Christ behold.
Within a manger he was laid,
And by his side the virgin maid,
Attending on the Lord of life,
Who came on earth to end all strife.",The Wexford Carol,1987
Loreena McKennitt,"Alas my love you do me wrong
To cast me off discourteously;
And I have loved you oh so long
Delighting in your company.

Greensleeves was my delight,
Greensleeves my heart of gold
Greensleeves was my heart of joy
And who but my lady Greensleeves.

I have been ready at your hand
To grant whatever thou would'st crave;
I have waged both life and land
Your love and goodwill for to have.

Greensleeves was my delight,
Greensleeves my heart of gold
Greensleeves was my heart of joy
And who but my lady Greensleeves.

Thy petticoat of slender white
With gold embroidered gorgeously;
Thy petticoat of silk and white
And these I bought gladly.

Greensleeves was my delight,
Greensleeves my heart of gold
Greensleeves was my heart of joy
And who but my lady Greensleeves.",Greensleeves,1991
Loreena McKennitt,"O bonny Portmore, I am sorry to see
Such a woeful destruction of your ornament tree
For it stood on your shore for many's the long day
Till the long boats from Antrim came to float it away.

O bonny Portmore, you shine where you stand
And the more I think on you the more I think long
If I had you now as I had once before
All the lords in Old England would not purchase Portmore.

All the birds in the forest they bitterly weep
Saying, ""Where will we shelter or shall we sleep?""
For the Oak and the Ash, they are all cutten down
And the walls of bonny Portmore are all down to the ground.

O bonny Portmore, you shine where you stand
And the more I think on you the more I think long
If I had you now as I had once before
All the Lords of Old England would not purchase Portmore.",Bonny Portmore,1993
Loreena McKennitt,"On either side of the river lie
Long fields of barley and of rye,
That clothe the world and meet the sky;
And thro' the field the road run by
To many-towered Camelot;
And up and down the people go,
Gazing where the lilies blow
Round an island there below,
The island of Shalott.

Willows whiten, aspens quiver,
Little breezes dusk and shiver
Thro' the wave that runs for ever
By the island in the river
Flowing down to Camelot.
Four grey walls, and four grey towers,
Overlook a space of flowers,
And the silent isle imbowers
The Lady of Shalott.

Only reapers, reaping early,
In among the bearded barley
Hear a song that echoes cheerly
From the river winding clearly
Down to tower'd Camelot; 
And by the moon the reaper weary,
Piling sheaves in uplands airy,
Listening, whispers ""'tis the fairy
The Lady of Shalott.""

There she weaves by night and day
A magic web with colours gay,
She has heard a whisper say,
A curse is on her if she stay
To look down to Camelot.
She knows not what the curse may be,
And so she weaveth steadily,
And little other care hath she,
The Lady of Shalott.

And moving through a mirror clear
That hangs before her all the year,
Shadows of the world appear.
There she sees the highway near
Winding down to Camelot;
And sometimes thro' the mirror blue
The Knights come riding two and two.
She hath no loyal Knight and true,
The Lady Of Shalott.

But in her web she still delights
To weave the mirror's magic sights,
For often thro' the silent nights
A funeral, with plumes and lights
And music, went to Camelot;
Or when the Moon was overhead,
Came two young lovers lately wed.
""I am half sick of shadows,"" said
The Lady Of Shalott.

A bow-shot from her bower-eaves,
He rode between the barley sheaves,
The sun came dazzling thro' the leaves,
And flamed upon the brazen greaves
Of bold Sir Lancelot.
A red-cross knight for ever kneel'd
To a lady in his shield,
That sparkled on the yellow field,
Beside remote Shalott.

His broad clear brow in sunlight glow'd;
On burnish'd hooves his war-horse trode;
From underneath his helmet flow'd
His coal-black curls as on he rode,
As he rode back to Camelot.
From the bank and from the river
he flashed into the crystal mirror,
""Tirra Lirra,"" by the river
Sang Sir Lancelot.

She left the web, she left the loom,
She made three paces taro' the room,
She saw the water-lily bloom,
She saw the helmet and the plume,
She looked down to Camelot.
Out flew the web and floated wide;
The mirror cracked from side to side; 
""The curse is come upon me,"" cried
The Lady of Shalott.

In the stormy east-wind straining,
The pale yellow woods were waning,
The broad stream in his banks complaining.
Heavily the low sky raining
Over towered Camelot;
Down she came and found a boat
Beneath a willow left afloat,
And round about the prow she wrote
The Lady of Shalott

And down the river's dim expanse
Like some bold seer in a trance,
Seeing all his own mischance - 
With a glassy countenance
Did she look to Camelot.
And at the closing of the day
She loosed the chain and down she lay;
The broad stream bore her far away,
The Lady of Shalott.

Heard a carol, mournful, holy,
Chanted loudly, chanted lowly,
Till her blood was frozen slowly,
And her eyes were darkened wholly,
Turn'd to towered Camelot.
For ere she reach'd upon the tide
The first house by the water-side,
Singing in her song she died,
The Lady of Shalott.

Under tower and balcony,
By garden-wall and gallery,
A gleaming shape she floated by,
Dead-pale between the houses high,
Silent into Camelot.
Out upon the wharfs they came,
Knight and Burgher, Lord and Dame,
And round the prow they read her name,
The Lady of Shalott.

Who is this? And what is here?
And in the lighted palace near
Died the sound of royal cheer;
And they crossed themselves for fear,
All the Knights at Camelot;
But Lancelot mused a little space
He said, ""She has a lovely face;
God in his mercy lend her grace,
The Lady of Shalott.""",The Lady of Shalott,1994
Loreena McKennitt,"I sowed the seeds of love
I sowed them in the spring
I gathered them up in the morning so clear
When the small birds so sweetly sing
When the small birds so sweetly sing

The gardener was standing by
I asked him to choose for me
He chose for me the violet, the lily and the pink
But those I refused all three
But those I refused all three

The violet I did not like
Because it bloomed so soon
The lily and the pink I really over-think
So I thought I would wait till June
So I thought I would wait till June

In June there was a red rose bud
That is the flower for me

O tidings of comfort and joy!

Loreena McKennitt,"Good King Wenceslas looked out
On the Feast of Stephen
When the snow lay 'round about
Deep and crisp and even
Brightly shone the moon that night
Though the frost was cruel
When a poor man came in sight
Gath'ring winter fuel
""Hither, page, and stand by me,
If thou know'st it, telling
Yonder peasant, who is he?
Where and what his dwelling?""
""Sire, he lives a good league hence,
Underneath the mountain
Right against the forest fence
By Saint Agnes' fountain.""
""Bring me flesh and bring me wine
Bring me pine-logs hither
Thou and I shall see him dine
When we bear them thither.""
Page and monarch, forth they went
Forth they went together
Through the rude wind's wild lament
And the bitter weather.
""Sire, the night is darker now
And the wind blows stronger
Fails my heart, I know not how
I can go no longer.""
""Mark my footsteps, good my page
Tread thou in them boldly
Thou shall find the winter's rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly.""
In his master's step he trod
Where the snow lay dinted
Heat was in the very sod
Which the Saint had printed
Therefore, Christian men, be sure
Wealth or rank possessing
Ye, who now will bless the poor
Shall yourselves find blessing.",Good King Wenceslas,1995
Loreena McKennitt,"The wind was a torrent of darkness
Among the gusty trees
The moon was a ghostly galleon
Tossed upon the cloudy seas
The road was a ribbon of moonlight
Over the purple moor
When the highwayman came riding
Riding, riding,
The highwayman came riding 
Up to the old inn door

He'd a french cocked hat at his forehead
A bunch of lace at his chin
A coat of claret velvet
And breeches of brown doe-skin
They fitted with nary a wrinkle
His boots were up to the thigh
And he rode with a jeweled twinkle
His pistol butts a-twinkle
His rapier hilt a-twinkle
Under the jeweled sky

And over cobbles he clattered
And clashed in the dark inn-yard
And he tapped with his whip on the shutters
But all was locked and barred
He whistled a tune to the window
And who should be waiting there
But the landlord's black-eyed daughter
Bess, the landlord's daughter
Plaiting a dark red love knot 
Into her long black hair

""One kiss my bonny sweetheart
I'm after a prize tonight

Before the morning light
Yet if they press me sharply
And harry me through the day

He rose up right in the stirrups
He scarce could reach her hand
But she loosened her hair in the casement
His face burned like a brand
As a black cascade of perfume
Came tumbling over his breast
And he kissed its waves in the moonlight
Oh, sweet waves in the moonlight
He tugged at his rein in the moonlight
And galloped away to the west

He did not come at the dawning 
He did not come at noon
And out of the tawny sunset
Before the rise of the moon
When the road was a gypsy's ribbon
Looping the purple moor
A redcoat troop came marching
Marching, marching
King George's men came marching
Up to the old inn door

They said no word to the landlord
They drank his ale instead
But they gagged his daughter and bound her
To the foot of her narrow bed
Two of them knelt at the casement
With muskets at their side
There was death at every window
Hell at one dark window
For Bess could see through the casement
The road that he would ride

They had tied her up to attention
With many a sniggering jest
They had bound a musket beside her
With the barrel beneath her breast
""Now keep good watch"" and they kissed her
She heard the dead man say
""Look for me by the moonlight
Watch for me by the moonlight
I'll come to thee by the moonlight
Though hell should bar the way.""

She twisted her hands behind her
But all the knots held good!
But she writhed her hands 'til her fingers
Were wet with sweat or blood
They stretched and strained in the darkness
And the hours crawled by like years
Till now on the stroke of midnight
Cold on the stroke of midnight
The tip of her finger touched it

Tot-a-lot in the echoing night
Nearer he came and nearer
Her face was like a light
Her eyes grew wide for a moment
She drew a last deep breath
Then her finger moved in the moonlight
Her musket shattered the moonlight
Shattered her breast in the moonlight
And warned him with her death

He turned, he spurred to the west
He did not know she stood 
Bowed with her head o'er musket
Drenched with her own red blood
Not till the dawn he heard it 
His face grew grey to hear
How Bess the landlord's daughter
The landlord's black-eyed daughter
Had watched for her love in the moonlight
And died in the darkness there

And back he spurred like a madman
Shrieking a curse to the sky!
With the white road smoking behind him
And his rapier brandished high!

Loreena McKennitt,"On either side of the river lie 
Long fields of barley and of rye, 
That clothe the world and meet the sky; 
And thro' the field the road run by 

To many-towered Camelot; 

And up and down the people go, 
Gazing where the lilies blow 
Round an island there below, 
The island of Shalott. 

Willows whiten, aspens quiver, 
Little breezes dusk and shiver 
Thro' the wave that runs for ever 
By the island in the river 

Flowing down to Camelot. 

Four grey walls, and four grey towers, 
Overlook a space of flowers, 
And the silent isle imbowers 
The Lady of Shalott. 

Only reapers, reaping early, 
In among the bearded barley 
Hear a song that echoes cheerly 
From the river winding clearly 

Down to tower'd Camelot; 

And by the moon the reaper weary, 
Piling sheaves in uplands airy, 
Listening, whispers ""'tis the fairy 
The Lady of Shalott."" 

There she weaves by night and day 
A magic web with colours gay, 
She has heard a whisper say, 
A curse is on her if she stay 

To look down to Camelot. 

She knows not what the curse may be, 
And so she weaveth steadily, 
And little other care hath she, 
The Lady of Shalott. 

And moving through a mirror clear 
That hangs before her all the year, 
Shadows of the world appear. 
There she sees the highway near 

Winding down to Camelot; 

And sometimes thro' the mirror blue 
The Knights come riding two and two. 
She hath no loyal Knight and true, 
The Lady Of Shalott. 

But in her web she still delights 
To weave the mirror's magic sights, 
For often thro' the silent nights 
A funeral, with plumes and lights 

And music, went to Camelot; 

Or when the Moon was overhead, 
Came two young lovers lately wed. 
""I am half sick of shadows,"" said 
The Lady Of Shalott. 

A bow-shot from her bower-eaves, 
He rode between the barley sheaves, 
The sun came dazzling thro' the leaves, 
And flamed upon the brazen greaves 

Of bold Sir Lancelot. 

A red-cross knight for ever kneel'd 
To a lady in his shield, 
That sparkled on the yellow field, 
Beside remote Shalott. 

His broad clear brow in sunlight glow'd; 
On burnish'd hooves his war-horse trode; 
From underneath his helmet flow'd 
His coal-black curls as on he rode, 

As he rode back to Camelot. 

From the bank and from the river 
He flashed into the crystal mirror, 
""Tirra Lirra,"" by the river 
Sang Sir Lancelot. 

She left the web, she left the loom, 
She made three paces taro' the room, 
She saw the water-lily bloom, 
She saw the helmet and the plume, 

She looked down to Camelot. 

Out flew the web and floated wide; 
The mirror cracked from side to side; 
""The curse is come upon me,"" cried 
The Lady of Shalott. 

In the stormy east-wind straining, 
The pale yellow woods were waning, 
The broad stream in his banks complaining. 
Heavily the low sky raining 

Over towered Camelot; 

Down she came and found a boat 
Beneath a willow left afloat, 
And round about the prow she wrote 
The Lady of Shalott 

And down the river's dim expanse 
Like some bold seer in a trance, 
Seeing all his own mischance - 
With a glassy countenance 

Did she look to Camelot. 

And at the closing of the day 
She loosed the chain and down she lay; 
The broad stream bore her far away, 
The Lady of Shalott. 

Heard a carol, mournful, holy, 
Chanted loudly, chanted lowly, 
Till her blood was frozen slowly, 
And her eyes were darkened wholly, 

Turn'd to towered Camelot. 

For ere she reach'd upon the tide 
The first house by the water-side, 
Singing in her song she died, 
The Lady of Shalott. 

Under tower and balcony, 
By garden-wall and gallery, 
A gleaming shape she floated by, 
Dead-pale between the houses high, 

Silent into Camelot. 

Out upon the wharfs they came, 
Knight and Burgher, Lord and Dame, 
And round the prow they read her name, 
The Lady of Shalott. 

Who is this? And what is here? 
And in the lighted palace near 
Died the sound of royal cheer; 
And they crossed themselves for fear, 

All the Knights at Camelot; 

But Lancelot mused a little space 
He said, ""She has a lovely face; 
God in his mercy lend her grace, 
The Lady of Shalott.""",The Lady of Shalott [Live][*],2005
Loreena McKennitt,"Where dips the rocky highland
Of sleuth wood in the lake
There lies a leafy island
Where flapping herons wake
The drowsy water rats
There we've hid our fairy vats
Full of berries
And of reddest stolen cherries.

Come away oh human child
To the waters and the wild
With a faery hand in hand
For the world's more full of weeping
Than you can understand

Where the wave of moonlight glosses
The dim grey sands with light
By far off furthest rosses
We foot it all the night
Weaving olden dances
Mingling hands and mingling glances
Till the moon has taken flight
To and fro we leap
And chase the frothy bubbles
Whilst the world is full of troubles
And is anxious in its sleep.

Come away oh human child
To the waters and the wild
With a faery hand in hand
For the world's more full of weeping
Than you can understand

Where the wandering water gushes
From the hills above glen car
In pools among the rushes
That scarce could bathe a star
We seek for slumbering trout
And whispering in their ears
Give them unquiet dreams
Leaning softly out
From ferns that drop their tears
Over the young streams

Come away oh human child
To the waters and the wild
With a faery hand in hand
For the world's more full of weeping
Than you can understand

Away with us he's going
The solemned eyed
He'll hear no more the lowing
Of the calves on the warm hillside
Or the kettle on the hob
Sing peace unto his breast
Or see the brown mice bob
Round and round the oatmeal chest.

Come away oh human child
To the waters and the wild
With a faery hand in hand
For the world's more full of weeping
Than you can understand

For he comes, the human child
To the waters and the wild
With a faery hand in hand

Came out the wild wood ringing

In life's young spring so early
And all upon my breast she died
While soft winds shook the barley

I bore her to some mountain stream
And many's the summer blossom
I placed with branches soft and green
About her gore-stained bosom
I wept and kissed her clay-cold corpse
Then rushed o'er vale and valley
My vengeance on the foe to wreak
While soft winds shook the barley

I took at Oulart Hollow

Lorenzo,"Proprio come un albero che vive in mezzo agli alberi 
Mi sento quando giro per il mondo cerco di far si che 
Il vento non mi butti gi√π e di affondar le mie radici 
Nel profondo, prendo il sole in faccia per far si che 
Le mie foglie stiano bene appiccicate lungo questi rami 
Ospito tra le mie braccia nidi di uccellini e do rifugio
Nel mio fusto a molti sciami

Proprio come un albero mi spoglio e mi rivesto a seconda 
Se c'√® freddo o c'√® calore dentro la genetica la mappa 
Delle cellule descrive a quale genere appartengo se sono 
Una quercia oppure un salice piangente oppure un baobab od 
Un saggio di pianura quello che √® importante √® che al mondo 
Ci sia spazio per qualsiasi espressione di natura
Prendo il sole in faccia bevo molta pioggia io non ho 

Problemi a convivere con gli altri sono pronto ad accettare 
La mia sorte sono consapevole del fatto che pi√π o meno presto 
O tardi ci sar√† per me la morte quella che tot√≤ ha definito 
La livella e che alla fine ci livella tutti uguali alberi 
Bestiole re profeti presidenti calciatori poveretti ed animali
Quello che io penso come albero parlante √® che la vita sia 
Questione di radici pi√π sono profonde pi√π ti puoi portar lontano 

Incontrando gente conquistando amici perch√© io ho scoperto che 
Le mie radici in fondo sono l√¨ per procurarmi le risorse 
Cosicch√© con le mie foglie io possa affrontare venti forti e 
Possa farmi delle corse prendo il sole in faccia bevo molta pioggia 
Andare di qua e di l√† sconfinare allegramente farmi un p√≤ ogni tipo 
Di esperienza incontrare gente allargare le vedute e allenare pure 
Un po' l'intelligenza senza mai scordare cosa sono da dove vengo 

E pure dove voglio andare con le mie radici belle salde nel terreno 
Io coi rami io mi posso allontanare perch√© c'ho bisogno della terra 
Sotto I piedi dove dare fondamenta alla speranza proprio come un 
Albero mi adatto un poco a tutto basta solo un po' di clima di 
Accoglienza no no no alla violenza non rivendico nessuna appartenenza 
Tranne quella al mondo degli esseri viventi col diritto di affondare 
Le radici sogno un universo dove ogni differenza sia la base per poter 

Essere amici prendo il sole in faccia bevo molta pioggia proprio 
Come un albero mi colloco nel mezzo tra la terra e il cielo proprio

Libera l'anima da, da tutti i limiti
Che condizionano te ed i tuoi simili
Lascia la carica scorrere nelle tue vene
Forse lasciandoti andare magari conviene
Io dico che ti conviene e certamente
Libera l'anima, il corpo e anche la mente
Cerca di guardare il mondo con gli occhi pi√π aperti
Cerca di fare qualcosa, se ti diverti

Lorenzo,"Mi sono svegliato e ho visto le mie mani in fondo alle mie
Braccia
I piedi miei dalla parte opposta della faccia
Ho visto che per camminare devo mettere una gamba avanti e
L'altra indietro
E anche se mi sforzo posso volare in alto circa un metro
Per un secondo, e poi una strana forza mi riporta appiccicato al
Mondo la chiamano gravit√†
Mi sono svegliato ed ho capito che che non c'√® libert√†
E non c'√® libert√† che non c'√® libert√† e non c'√® libert√†
Mi sono svegliato ed ho creduto di essermi svegliato
E invece poi mi sono accorto di essere ancora addormentato
I miei pensieri, le mie parole, I gesti il mio rapporto con la
Realt√†
Soltanto meccanicit√† niente volont√†
Il frutto inconsapevole di una catena di eventi precedenti
A me al mio presente

Mi son svegliato ed ho creduto di essere cosciente
E invece niente imprigionato si meccanismi chimici nella mia
Mente
Sbattuto di qua sbattuto di l√†
Come una palla dentro al flipper dell'eternit√†
Mi sono svegliato ed ho capito che che non c'√® libert√†
E non c'√® libert√† che non c'√® libert√† e non c'√® libert√†
Mi sono svegliato e ho visto sofferenza intorno a me
E poi mi sono tagliato col rasoio mentre mi radevo
E tutta la sofferenza intorno a me √® sparita
Ero da solo con la mia ferita
Soffrivo solo io mi sono accorto che dal mio stato fisico e
Mentale
Dipende anche il mio rapporto con la realt√†
Mi sono svegliato ed ho pensato che, ho pensato che

Lorenzo,"Tempo,
Tempo comunque vadano le cose lui passa 
E se ne frega se qualcuno √® in ritardo 
Puoi chiamarlo bastardo 
Ma tanto √® gi√† andato 
E fino adesso niente lo ha mai fermato 
E tutt'al pi√π forse lo hai misurato 
Con i tuoi orologi di ogni marca e modello


Ma tanto il tempo resta sempre lui quello 
L'unica cosa che ci √® data di fare 
√à avere il tempo da poter organizzare 
Si da organizzare 
Da dividere in passi 
Cassa rullante la mia voce 
Ed i bassi bassi medi e alti 
Per fare salti per far ballare il pubblico sugli spalti 
E non m'annoio e no che non m'annoio 
Non m'annoio 
Io no che non m'annoio 
Non m'annoio no che non m'annoio 
No che non m'annoio 

Tempo 109 battute al minuto 
Quando finisce forse ti sar√† piaciuto 
La chiave per capire questo genere di suono 
Che a molte orecchie pu√≤ sembrare frastuono 
E liberare la tua parte migliore chiudere 
Gli occhi aprire bene il cuore 
Che non c'√® musica che vale di pi√π 
Di quella musica che vuoi sentire tu 
E non mi stanco 
E no che non mi stanco non mi stanco 
Io no che non mi stanco 
Non mi stanco no che non mi stanco 
No che non mi stanco 

Sono passate 1000 generazioni 
Dai rockabilli punk e capelloni 
I metallari i paninari e sorcini 
E ogni volta gli stessi casini 
Perch√© i ragazzi non si fanno vedere 
Sono sfuggenti come le pantere 
E quando li cattura una definizione 
Il mondo √® pronto a una nuova generazione 
E non m'annoio e no che non m'annoio 
Non m'annoio 
Io no che non m'annoio 
Non m'annoio no che non m'annoio 
No che non m'annoio 

Tempo 
Prezioso 
Conosco un modo per rimanere a galla 
Non abboccare a questa grande balla 
Del tempo che ti fa cambiare che ti modella
E pi√π vai avanti pi√π la vita √® meno bella 
Sfuggi dal gruppo e pensa con la tua testa 
E stare insieme sar√† sempre una festa 
Se riuscirai a sopravvivere lontano dal branco 
Non c'√® noia non sarai mai stanco 
Sfuggi dal gruppo e non lasciarti fregare 
E non m'annoio io continuo a ballare 
E non mi rompo 
No che non mi rompo non mi rompo 
Io no che non mi rompo 
Non mi rompo no che non mi rompo 
No che non mi rompo

Tempo quando stai bene lui va via come un lampo 
Quando ti annoi un attimo sembra eterno 
Il paradiso pu√≤ diventare inferno tempo
Ti frego con il ritmo ti cattura 
E ti chiudo in una ritmica di aspetto molto duro 
E ti organizzo in battute in quattro quarti 
All'ora non avrai tempo di liberarti
E con le gambe muovo anche il cervello 
E allora il tempo sar√† mio fratello 
E come lui mi dar√† sempre una mano 
Mi dar√† tempo per andare lontano 
E come Ulisse cercher√≤ di ritrovare 
Quella mia isola ma tanto viaggiare 
Sar√† piacevole sar√† indispensabile 
Anche se l'isola sar√† irraggiungibile (ahaaaaa) 
E non m'annoio e no che non m'annoio 
Non m'annoio 
Io no che non m'annoio 
Non m'annoio no che non m'annoio 
No che non m'annoio 
E non mi stanco 
E no che non mi stanco non mi stanco 
Io no che non mi stanco 
Non mi stanco no che non mi stanco 
No che non mi stanco 
E non mi rompo 
No che non mi rompo non mi rompo 
Io no che non mi rompo 
Non mi rompo no che non mi rompo 
No che non mi rompo

E quelle foglie che ti sembravan morte
Ripopolano I rami un'altra volta

No me atrevo a mirarte a los ojos
Y aunque suene imposible

Sentir√≠as al baterista de una banda de metal pesado
Y hoy por eso estoy aqu√≠ parado
Porque me sale mucho m√°s f√°cil con una de mis canciones
Para lograr que sientan hasta muros y platones

Y para no telefonear te digo todo cara a cara

Me gusta tu nariz en sinfon√≠a con el mundo
Me gusta tu trasero, casi redondo
Que torna en un sat√©lite a cada ser viviente
Me gustas por que eres, inteligente

Se ve muy claro en tus manos como las mueves
Y haces que hasta los sentimientos siempre me renueves

Dos almas de repente se generan un destino
Palacios, ruido, smog son como un jard√≠n divino
Personas entregadas intercambian un anillo
En un departamento que sera como un castillo

Tus caderas son los andes y tus pechos los volcanes
Me gusta tu buen gusto en la ropa con que sales
Que est√° muy por encima de la moda del momento

Col giradischi e col microfono
Insieme al mio complesso
Per cantarti il sentimento
E se tu mi vorrai baciare
Saro¬¥ contento
E questa serenata
E¬¥ la mia sfida col destino
Vorrei che per la vita
Noi due fossimo vicino
Una serenata rap
Per dirti che di te
Mi piaci come mi guardi
Mi piace come sei con me

Mettiti con me

Di passioni da copione
Di cinema romanzi
E che ne so di una canzone

Amore solamente amore
Solo solo quello

Guardando il sole 
Che fa spazio all'imbrunire
In questa terra 
Lontana da casa
Lontana da te 
Che sei la mia casa
Ovunque tu sia 
Tu sei l'anima mia
Sei un campo di malinconia
Quando non sono da te 
Sei un campo di frutti dolcissimi
Quando sei qui con me 
Contadino del cuore
La mia gioia mi costa sudore
Io ti amo e fuggo lontano 
La misura di quanto ti amo 
√à il pianeta
Di ogni viaggio lontano 
Da te sei la meta

Io re magio, tu stella cometa
Io re magio, tu stella cometa
 
Mi devo allontanare da te 
Per vederti tutta intera
Devo far finta che non ci sei 
Per scoprire che sei vera
Questa sera la signora dell'albergo 
Ha cucinato le patate
Come le fai tu 
Arrosto
Un po' croccanti fuori 
E morbide nel cuore
Proprio come le fai te
Proprio come te 
Proprio come te

Mangiandole mangiavo te 
Come una comunione 
E son scappato via perch√© 
Da troppo amore 
Non so respirare 
Amore amore amore amore
Questa parola vista da lontano 
Mi fa sentire un pellegrino 
Un penitente
Un cavaliere errante 
Un mezzo deficiente

Io ti amo e fuggo lontano 
La misura di quanto ti amo 
√à il pianeta
Di ogni viaggio lontano da te 
Sei la meta

Io re magio, tu stella cometa

Adesso la luce del sole 
√â sparita
La foresta si popola

E hanno come idoli denaro e padroni
E valutano l'uomo in base a ""quanti milioni""

Confuso nel discernere la virt√π dai vizi

Ti obbliga a pensare a quello che dovrai dire

La carica ti scarica pi√π forte che puoi
√à l'energia del sole per quanto ce ne resta
Che muove le tue gambe e accende la tua testa
Riempi la riserva e vai a manetta
E quando il tuo sudore bagner√† la tua maglietta
Ricordati che tu sei unico al mondo
E non esiste primo e non esiste secondo
Esiste una trib√π, esistono i fratelli
Che pi√π sono diversi e pi√π sono fratelli
Ognuno ha la sua storia e le sue tradizioni
Ognuno il suo colore e le sue religioni

Sempre pi√π al centro 
Sempre pi√π in mezzo fino a che non lo distingui pi√π il confine 
Tra la tua pelle e il cielo 
Tra quello che √® a pezzi √® quello che √® intero 
La notte ha mille occhi 
Credi di guardare e sei guardato 
Sono tempi ""rock'n roll"" 
Che si resta senza fiato 
Cadono I record alle olimpiadi 
Tutto si supera in un secondo 
E in ogni mondo c'√® dentro un mondo 
Che ha dentro un mondo che ha dentro un mondo 

Ci sono armi nei supermercati 
E mettono I ""beep"" nei vaffanculo 
Ci dicono continuamente che nessuno √® al sicuro 
Ma questo lo sapevo gi√† 
E non √® mai stata una buona scusa 
Per barricarmi dentro casa 
La tele accessa e la porta chiusa 

Safari 
Dentro la mia testa 
Ci sono pi√π bestie che nella foresta 

La terra vista dallo spazio √® una palla 
Azzurra e silenziosa 
Ma se ci vivi ti rendi conto 
Che √® tutta un'altra cosa 
Niente combacia ci sono crepe 
E dalle crepe passa un po' di luce 
Che si espande nell'universo 
Prendi tutto quello che ti piace 
Ho"" diamanti sotto ai miei piedi"" 
Ho un oceano dentro alle vene 
Ognuno danza col suo demone 
E ogni storia finisce bene 

Safari 
Dentro la mia testa 
Ci sono pi√π bestie che nella foresta 

Fuoco 
Acqua 
Elettricit√† 

Le scimmie saltano di ramo in ramo 
Assaggio la notte, 
La notte che passa pi√π svelta 
Su lente lenzuola di corpi 
Sudati si chiudono gli occhi 
Si spegne l'insegna dell'ultima vita di luce 
Rubate si finge il silenzio perfetto 
L'esterno ti sembra di pace 
La notte d'estate 
Intanto il ruomore 
Nel buio dell'anima mia 
Che corre a gambe levate 
Sbattendo con forza 
Su muri di pelle e di ossa 
Un paio di ali al vento 
Un paio di ali al vento al vento",Safari,2008
Lorenzo,"A te che sei l'unica al mondo
L'unica ragione per arrivare fino in fondo
Ad ogni mio respiro
Quando ti guardo
Dopo un giorno pieno di parole
Senza che tu mi dica niente
Tutto si fa chiaro
A te che mi hai trovato

All'angolo coi pugni chiusi
Con le mie spalle contro il muro
Pronto a difendermi
Con gli occhi bassi
Stavo in fila
Con I disillusi
Tu mi hai raccolto come un gatto
E mi hai portato con te

A te io canto una canzone
Perche non ho altro
Niente di meglio da offrirti
Di tutto quello che ho

Prendi il mio tempo
E la magia
Che con un solo salto
Ci fa volare dentro l'aria

Come bollicine
A te che sei
Semplicemente sei
Sostanza dei giorni miei
Sostanza dei giorni miei

A te che sei il mio grande amore
Ed il mio amore grande
A te che hai preso la mia vita
E ne hai fatto molto di pi?

A te che hai dato senso al tempo
Senza misurarlo
A te che sei il mio amore grande
Ed il mio grande amore

A te che io
Ti ho visto piangere nella mia mano
Fragile che potevo ucciderti
Stringendoti un po'

E poi ti ho visto
Con la forza di un aeroplano
Prendere in mano la tua vita
E trascinarla in salvo

A te che mi hai insegnato I sogni
E l'arte dell'avventura
A te che credi nel coraggio
E anche nella paura

A te che sei la miglior cosa
Che mi sia successa
A te che cambi tutti I giorni
E resti sempre la stessa
A te che sei

Semplicemente sei
Sostanza dei giorni miei
Sostanza dei sogni miei
A te che sei
Essenzialmente sei

Sostanza dei sogni miei
Sostanza dei giorni miei
A te che non ti piaci mai
E sei una meraviglia

Le forze della natura si concentrano in te
Che sei una roccia sei una pianta sei un uragano
Sei l'orizzonte che mi accoglie quando mi allontano
A te che sei l'unica amica

Che Io posso avere
L'unico amore che vorrei
Se io non ti avessi con me
A te che hai reso la mia vita
Bella da morire

Che riesci a render la fatica
Un immenso piacere

L'orecchio non pu√≤ sentire quello che il cuore sente 
Le mani non sanno dare quello che il cuore da 
C'√® un temporale in arrivo 
C'√® un temporale in arrivo senti l'elettricit√† 
C'√® un temporale in arriuvo sulla mia citt√† 
Porta novit√† porta novit√† 
Il lupo perde il pelo io perdo le occasioni 
Ma non so perdere il vizio delle emozioni 

La vita √® pi√π interessante delle definizioni 
E tutto quello che arriva da qualche parte va 
Gerusalemme √® divisa sotto ad un solo cielo 
E la mia mente √® divisa dentro ad un corpo solo 
Un meridiano per forza incrocia un parallelo 
Determinando la sorte di molta umanit√† 
E tutto quello che sappiamo non √® vero 
E tutto quello che sappiamo non √® vero 
Si perdono le origini nel buco del tempo 
Ma tutto si conserva nelle profondit√† 

Sia l'elefante che il topo non avranno scampo 
La legge della savana li governer√† 
Non si pu√≤ scegliere un sogno non si pu√≤ scegliere 
Quando ti arriva ti arriva non c'√® niente da fare 
Le previsioni del tempo si posson prevedere 
Ma un temporale che arriva non lo puoi fermare 
Si danza per invocare la fertilit√† 
Si danza prima del sesso o di un combattimento 
Si danza per riscaldarsi dal freddo che fa 
Si danza per imitare il lavoro del vento

Quando io ho sete nessuno pu√≤ bere al posto mio 

Anche gli automi hanno un cuore di alluminio puro 
Pronto per farci passare l'amore del futuro 
Abramo lascia la casa senza sapere niente 
Si mette in strada lasciando quel che sapeva gi√† 
E il trapezista si gioca tutto continuamente 
Per pochi soldi ed per un brivido di libert√† 
L'autista di scuolabus ha in mano la nazione 
Pi√π di un ministro di un Papa o di un'autorit√† 
E c'√® una terra di mezzo tra il torto e la ragione 
La maggior parte del mondo la puoi trovare l√† 

Lavori in corso ci dispiace per l'inconveniente 
Hanno scoperto una casa dell'antichit√† 
Due scheletri abbracciati qualche osso poco o niente 
Ma il loro bacio va avanti per l'eternit√† 
C'√® un temporale in arrivo 
C'√® un temporale in arrivo senti l'elettricit√† 
C'√® un temporale in arrivo sulla mia citt√† 
Porta novit√† porta novit√† 
L'antico impero cinese accolse Marco Polo 
Perch√® era un giovane mercante di immaginazione 

Non servono grandi ali per spiccare il volo 
La vita √® molto pi√π vasta di una definizione 
E stanno tutti aspettando che succeda qualcosa 
Che tolga il velo di polvere dalla realt√† 
E stanno tutti aspettando che arrivi la sposa 
Coi fiori in mano e una promessa di felicit√† 
Problemi di digestione ispirano romanzi 
Rivelazioni che nascono nell'acidit√† 
Un p√≤ di bicarbonato dopo certi pranzi 

Si eviterebbe lo scontro delle civilt√† 
Gli uccelli volano bassi e sfiorano l'asfalto 
E I cani stanno in silenzio con aria d'attesa 
La foto sulla parete mi segue con lo sguardo 
Nessun allarme per ora nessuna sorpresa 
C'√® un temporale in arrivo 
C'√® un temporale in arrivo senti l'elettricit√† 
C'√® un temporale in arrivo sulla mia citt√† 
Porta novit√† porta novit√†

Ma quello che anche se perde non √® vinto mai 
L'intelligenza √® nel corpo il sapere nel cuore 
Se pensi sempre ad un muro un muro troverai 
Mi son trovato memorie che non sono mie 
Ho un solo nome ma almeno cento identit√† 
E' naturale preferire le belle bugie 
Alla durezza di ghiaccio di certe verit√† 

Viviamo comodi dentro alle nostre virgolette 
Ma il mondo √® molto pi√π grande pi√π grande di cos√¨ 
Se uno ha imparato a contare fino a sette

What you could truly be

Shining star come in to view
Shine its watchful light on you
Give you strength to carry on
Make your body big and strong

Saw your work had just begun

Found I had to stand alone
Bless it now I've got my own

Why don't you listen to these words and heed
Be you giant or grain of sand
Words of wisdom are ?Yes I can?

Non pigiare stop
Qua si fa l'appello, raga

√à tornato il prof

Suona Jacopo DJ

Siamo in camerino

Se Jacopo ci va si balla tipo al Super Bowl

Fammi solo un'acqua tonica
Merda zio, imprevisto

Dice che la matematica non serve a niente
Dice che la fisica non serve proprio a niente
Modellizziamo Jacopo in un punto materiale
Lo scalino qua come un'altezza da scalare
Poniamo per esempio che abbia massa m
Poggiato su di un piano

Alziamola da terra
Fino a un'altezza h
La massa √® molto grossa, professore
Porca vacca quanto pesa
Sorpresa?
E invece no √® banale
Mg con g accelerazione gravitazionale
E la forza peso frate in questo caso ti √® nemica
Ti schiaccia a terra quasi come fossi una formica

Vorrei andare alla console

Si balla tipo Super Bowl
(Ci vuole pazienza)
Vorrei andare alla console
Si balla tipo Super Bowl

Mi mettono pressione
Ma senza soluzione
E Jacopo DJ non pu√≤ suonare la sua canzone
Ma inchinatevi alla scienza
Il momento √® arrivato
Le mani al cielo raga, per il piano inclinato
Sia alfa angolo minore di 90
L'angolo famoso di cui la paura √® tanta
E il motivo si sa
Domandare √® inopportuno
Che il seno di alfa √® pi√π piccolo di uno
Se scompongo il peso nelle due direzioni
Tangente, normale, come fanno i campioni
Seno di alfa per m per g
Bella zio, anche mio nonno ci riesce cos√¨

Jacopino alla console
Si balla tipo al Super Bowl
Jacopino alla console
(Ragazzi aprite bene le orecchie)
Si balla tipo al Super Bowl
(Che Jacopino ha qualcosa da dirvi)

Scale uguale, corsa a ostacoli
Tipo piovra che ti blocca con i suoi tentacoli
Che non ti molla
Mamma mia s'incolla
Ma col piano inclinato
Bella zio, si decolla
E altrimenti non mi sento libero di fare
Tutto quello che √® semplice
Roba normale
Tutti in pista su le mani
Di una cosa son sicuro
Che un mondo pi√π accessibile
Fa rima con futuro

Per uno meno uno

Quattro meno uno tre

Meno tre fa zero

Sei il re degli algebristi
Un, due, tre, bella te che c'√®

Si te encuentro en la calle
No me atrevo ni hablarte
Se bloquean mis palabras
No me atrevo a mirarte a los ojos
Y aunque suene imposible
Si pudiera amplificar el latir del coraz√≥n
Sentir√≠as al baterista de una banda de metal pesado
Y hoy por eso estoy aqu√≠ parado
Porque me sale mucho m√°s f√°cil con una de mis canciones
Para lograr que sientan hasta muros y platones

Y para no telefonear te digo todo cara a cara

Es que esta serenata es mi cita con el destino
Pues quiero que en la vida estemos
Tu y yo siempre unidos
Una serenata rap para decir a ti
Me gusta como miras y lo que piensas de m√≠
Me gusta tu nariz en sinfon√≠a con el mundo
Me gusta tu trasero, casi redondo
Que torna en un sat√©lite a cada ser viviente
Me gustas por que eres, inteligente

Se ve muy claro en tus manos como las mueves
Y haces que hasta los sentimientos siempre me renueves

Quiz√°s porqu√©

De cine de romances solo falsas ilusiones

Amor que nadie ama se resigna a no lograrlo
Lo escribe en los muros
Y luego en el subterr√°neo de esta ciudad
Millones de habitantes que van d√≠a con d√≠a
Ignor√°ndose hacia delante
Y despu√©s no s√© porqu√©
Porqu√©, qui√©n sabe c√≥mo

Dos almas de repente se generan un destino
Palacios, ruido, smog son como un jard√≠n divino
Personas entregadas intercambian un anillo
En un departamento que sera como un castillo

You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,

Steals across the meadows of my heart

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

Perd√≠ lo que mas quer√≠a
Era una medalla de oro
Que me dio mi madre un d√≠a
La cambie por un tequila
Malagrada suerte m√≠a.

Un domingo en la ma√±ana
Un amigo me avisaba
Que la mujer que yo amaba
Con otro hombre se casaba
Me diriji a una cantina
A ver si hay la olvidaba.

Serian las 11 o las 12
O las dos de la ma√±ana
Borracho y ya sin dinero
La sinfo no la tocaba
Me desprend√≠ la medalla
Era lo que me quedaba.
Dicen que yo llegue al baile
Cuando mi Aurora rayaba
Al ver en brazos de otro hombre
A la mujer que yo amaba
Le descargue la pistola
Cuando de mi se burlaba
Por eso tras de las rejas
Al cielo perd√≥n imploro
Matarla no me arrepiento
Aunque fue mi gran tesoro

Es la medallita de oro.",La Medallita de Oro,1988

Un emigrante gritaba

El faro de una patrulla
Se vio volar por el aire

Los otros tres del gobierno

Al o√≠do y te pongo un cubata""
""Con una condici√≥n
Que me dejes abierto el balc√≥n de tus ojos de gata""
Loco por conocer

Esa noche cant√©
Al piano del amanecer todo mi repertorio
Los clientes del bar
Uno a uno se fueron marchando
T√∫ saliste a cerrar

""Cuidado, chaval, te estas enamorando""

De la barra del otro verano

Me encontr√© una sucursal del banco hispano americano

A pedradas contra los cristales

Ma non √® mai azzurro
Mi accorgo, mi accorgo
Che hai rubato tutto

Sai
Quanto vorrei
Dirti che in amore vince solo chi resta
E mai
Mai ti direi
Che ti ho cercato in un'altra
Che la vita ci inganna
Che non so pi√π chi sei

Lorenzo Fragola,"Ever since you let go
I can't hear your echo, oh no
Every word you said
Replaying in my head now, now
I know I let you down
A thousands times or so
Honey, I'm screaming loud
But all I hear is echo

When I feel alone, put the radio on
But I don't really listen
Oh baby I know what I did, it was wrong
And I'm hoping that you miss me

Honey, you are all that I need
Records on and is playing and playing on repeat
The echo, and echo again
Since you're gone I feel like I'm drunk
And you're not in my bed
But you keep coming back around here
And echoes, and echoes, again
And echo, and echo, again
And echo, echo, again

You are like a shadow
That I want to follow
And I keep on chasing
Ooh, like a melody
Singing what to me
But I can't escape it

When I feel alone, put the radio on
But I don't really listen
Oh you made me cry like a waterfall
And I'm hoping that you miss me

Honey, you are all that I need
Records on and is playing and playing on repeat
The echo, and echo again
Since you're gone I feel like I'm drunk
And you're not in my bed

And echoes, and echoes, again
Again, again, again, again, again, again

Risin' against that blue sky?
Did you shout out in anger, in fear for your neighbor,
Or did you just sit down and cry?

Did you weep for the children, they lost their dear loved ones,
Pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?
Did you burst out in pride for the red, white, and blue

Did you dust off that Bible at home?

Did you open your eyes and hope it never happened,
Close your eyes and not go to sleep?
Did you notice the sunset for the first time in ages
And speak to some stranger on the street?
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow,
Go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watchin'
And turn on """"I Love Lucy"""" reruns?
Did you go to a church and hold hands with some stranger,
Stand in line to give your own blood?
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your fam'ly,
Thank God you had somebody to love?

Loretta Goggi,"Mi solletica certo l'idea
Di sapere il tuo letto che cosa racconta
Ma perch√© quest‚Äôidea che mi stuzzica,
Pizzica, mi eccita tanto di te

Sorriso smagliante, perfetta criniera
Mi chiedo che tattica scegli stasera
Con una che ha l'aria un po' fredda, un po' dura
Non crederci non e' paura

Tu che sai piacere un po' a tutti e a nessuno
Chiss√† se davvero ti senti qualcuno
Per essere buono sei troppo gentile
Mi sento infantile per√≤

Mi solletica il cuore l'idea di passare una notte con te
A svegliare le strade, a frustare De Sade, a parlare di te
E' al mattino dividere il pane croccante, biscotti e caff√®
Seduttore di ghiaccio ti abbraccio ma forse non faccio per te

Vedi essendo un poco miope ti vedo cos√¨ bl√π
Che mi piaci suppergi√π, per cui
Mi solletica certo l'idea di sapere il tuo letto che cosa racconta
Ma mi solletica il cuore l'idea
Di lasciarci una lunga e indelebile impronta

Ma certo tesoro, scherzavo un pochino
Se ho detto stanotte che voglio un bambino
Se avessi I miei muscoli ed il tuo cervello
Non credo verrebbe un modello

Ma no, √® troppo facile prenderti in giro
In fondo √® soltanto al tuo cuore che miro
Per dirla sul serio, per dirtela tutta
Mi sento un po' matta per√≤

Mi solletica il cuore l'idea di passare una vita con te
A tentare altre strade a bruciare De Sade, a cambiare con te
E al mattino dividere un bacio leggero che sa di caff√®
Seduttore di ghiaccio ti abbraccio per√≤ non lo faccio perch√©

C'√® che al buio anche miope io non ti vedo pi√π
E mi piaci a tu per tu per cui

Mi solletica certo l'idea di un amore che resta un amore che conta
Ma mi solletica I sensi l'idea di una notte di quelle che un uomo racconta

C'√® che al buio anche miope con te ci vedo blu
E mi piaci sempre pi√π per cui
Mi solletica sempre l'idea di lasciarti se non √® un amore che conta
Ma mi solletica il cuore l'idea di tornare da te quando il sole tramonta

Loretta Holloway,"At last, my love has come along
my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

Loretta Holloway,"I learned the truth at seventeen
That love was meant for beauty queens
And high school girls with clear skinned smiles
Who married young and then retired
The valentines I never knew
The Friday night charades of youth
Were spent on one more beautiful
At seventeen I learned the truth

And those of us with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social graces
Desperately remained at home
Inventing lovers on the phone
Who called to say - come dance with me
And murmured vague obscenities
It isn't all it seems at seventeen

A brown eyed girl in hand me downs
Whose name I never could pronounce
Said - pity please the ones who serve
They only get what they deserve
The rich relationed hometown queen
Marries into what she needs
With a guarantee of company
And haven for the elderly

So remember those who win the game
Lose the love they sought to gain
In debentures of quality and dubious integrity
Their small-town eyes will gape at you
In dull surprise when payment due
Exceeds accounts received at seventeen

To those of us who knew the pain
Of valentines that never came
And those whose names were never called
When choosing sides for basketball
It was long ago and far away
The world was younger than today
When dreams were all they gave for free
To ugly duckling girls like me

We all play the game, and when we dare
We cheat ourselves at solitaire
Inventing lovers on the phone
Repenting other lives unknown
That call and say - come on, dance with me
And murmur vague obscenities
At ugly girls like me, at seventeen",At Seventeen,1996
Loretta Holloway,"Hey lady, you, lady, cursin' at your life
You're a discontented mother and a rich inventive wife
I've no doubt you dream about the things you'll never do
But I wish someone had a talked to me like I wanna talk to you

Ooh I've been to Georgia and California, oh, anywhere I could run
Took the hand of a preacher man and we made love in the sun
But I ran out of places and friendly faces because I had to be free
I've been to paradise, but I've never been to me

Please lady, please, lady, don't just walk away
Cause I have this need to tell you why I'm all alone today
I can see so much of me still living in your eyes
Won't you share a part of a weary heart that has lived a million lies

Oh I've been to Nice and the isle of Greece
While I sipped champagne on a yacht
I moved like Harlow in Monte Carlo and showed 'em what I've got
I've been undressed by kings and I've seen some things
That a woman ain't s'posed to see
I've been to paradise, but I've never been to me

Hey, you know what paradise is? It's a lie. A fantasy we create about
People and places as we'd like them to be. But you know what truth is?
It's that little baby you're holding, and it's that man you fought with
This morning, the same one you're going to make love with tonight.
That's truth, that's love

Sometimes I've been to cryin' for unborn children
That might have made me complete
But I, I took the sweet life and never knew I'd be bitter from the sweet
I spent my life exploring the subtle whoring that cost too much to be free

Everywhere you go
Take a look at the five and ten, glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring, is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing, people passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you see

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling
Hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer's really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

Oh, you better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I am telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

You may not believe this but
He is making a list and checking it twice
Going to find out who is naughty and who is nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Your town and my town

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you are wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I am telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Believe me I'm ready for him

Loretta Lynn,"He put flowers on the hills your cup he gladly fills
How can you turn around and say God is dead
But when your stories have all been told there's one thing I'd like to know
If God is dead who's this living for my soul
He gives us shelter from life's stormy weather gives us love to keep us together
When life gets like a ship on a raging sea
And when the stage of life grows cold somebody helps us to play our role
If God is dead who's this living for my soul
If my soul had windows I'd leave them open so the world could see
The ugly scars upon those hands that cleft for you and me
There's the bridge you can cross if you will the toll was paid on Golgota's hill

The radio is playing some old song that baby used to sing to me
And in between my heartbeats Lord I think about the way it used to be

Passing my world to his and gave my heart the cause
I believed him everything is sad I thought that how it was

It puts a clear in your eyes
Somehow I could never do
You wanna lean on the jukebox, sip on a cool one
And hang around a place
Where you just might find one

It dawned on me
What sundown does to you

Now honey you know, sundown falls on everyone
When I say everyone, well that includes me too
So tonight when that old moon comes out
You can bet, I'll be cut out too

It just dawned on me
What sundown does to you?
It just dawned on me
Well, it dawned on me
What sundown does to you?

Loretta Lynn,"Before you first made love to me
You called me, your wife-to-be
And after that, I saw the devil in your eyes
With your sweet smooth talkin' ways
You turned a flame into a blaze
The night I let you hang my wings upon your horns

Don't tell me that I'm no saint
I'm the first to know I ain't
There's a little thing called love
And that's what changed me
)From an innocent country girl
To a woman of the world
The night I let you hang my wings upon your horns

You hung my wings upon your horns
And turned my halo into thorns
And turned me into a woman I can't stand
You're the first to ever make me
Fall in love and then not take me
The night I let you hang my wings upon your horns

You hung my wings upon your horns
And turned my halo into thorns
And turned me into a woman I can't stand
You're the first to ever make me
Fall in love and then not take me

It's this and so much more that makes me love you

They said I learned to walk while holdin' on to just one finger
On the hand of a man that stands at six-foot-three

Not old enough to understand the meaning of depression
Just something people talked about a lot
My daddy wasn't one that tried to make no big impressions
Just one heck of a man that worked for what he got

They don't make men like my daddy anymore
Guess they've thrown away the pattern through the years
In a great big land of freedom at a time we really need 'em
They don't make 'em like my daddy anymore

From the Johnson County coal camps to the hills of West Virginia
My daddy hauled the timber for the mines
Education didn't count so much as what you had born in you
Like the will to live and a dream of better times

Daddy never took a handout we ate pinto beans a bacon
But he worked to keep the wolf back from the door
And it only proves one thing to me when folks start belly achin'

For we no longer care enough to even disagree
Everybody envies us and the way we get along

He was made of snow but the children know how he came to life one day
There must have been some magic in that old silk that they found
For when they placed it on his head he began to dance around
Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play just the same as you and me

So he said let's run and we'll have some fun before I melt away
Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square saying catch me if you can
Led them down the streets of town right to the traffic cop

Comparing the value, appraising each pair

From Monday until Friday at school we'd learn and play

Well, that's just my way of saying, ""I love you""
I'm always walking after midnight searching for you

I stop to see a weeping willow crying on his pillow
Maybe he's crying for me and as the skies turn
Gloomy night winds whisper to me, I'm lonesome as I can be

I go out walking after midnight
Out in the starlight just hoping you may be
Somewhere a walking after midnight searching for me

I stop to see a weeping willow crying on his pillow
Maybe he's crying for me and as the skies turn
Gloomy night winds whisper to me, I'm lonesome as I can be

I go out walking after midnight
Out in the starlight just hoping you may be
Somewhere a walking after midnight searching for me

He tells me over and over that he loves me so
He gives me love that I never got from you
He loves me too his love is true why can't he be you

And I'm lucky to have such a guy I hear it all the time
And he does all the things that you would never do
He loves me too his love is true why can't he be you
No he's not the one who dominates my mind and soul

But his kisses leave me cold
He sends me flowers calls on the hour just to prove his love

Loretta Lynn,"Well, I was borned a coal miner's daughter
In a cabin, on a hill in Butcher Holler
We were poor but we had love
That's the one thing that daddy made sure of
He shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar

My daddy worked all night in the Van Lear coal mines
All day long in the field a hoin' corn
Mommy rocked the babies at night
And read the Bible by the coal oil light
And ever' thing would start all over come break of morn

Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay
Mommy scrubbed our clothes on a washboard ever' day
Why I've seen her fingers bleed
To complain, there was no need
She'd smile in mommy's understanding way

In the summertime we didn't have shoes to wear
But in the wintertime we'd all get a brand new pair
From a mail order catalog
Money made from selling a hog
Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere

Yeah, I'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter
I remember well, the well where I drew water
The work we done was hard
At night we'd sleep 'cause we were tired
I never thought of ever leaving Butcher Holler

Well a lot of things have changed since a way back then
And it's so good to be back home again
Not much left but the floor, nothing lives here anymore
Except the memory of a coal miner's daughter",Coal Miner's Daughter (Live Version),1993
Loretta Lynn,"There's a storm across the valley, clouds are rollin' in
The afternoon is heavy on your shoulders
There's a truck out on the four lane, a mile or more away
The whinin' of his wheels just makes it colder

He's an hour away from ridin' on your prayers up in the sky
Ten days on the road are barely gone
There's a fire softly burnin', suppers on the stove
It's the light in your eyes that makes him warm

Hey, it's good to be back home again
Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend
Yes, and hey, it's good to be back home again

There's all the news to tell him, how'd you spend your time
What's the latest thing the neighbors say?
And your mother called last Friday, sunshine made her cry
You felt the baby move just yesterday

Hey, it's good to be back home again
Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend
Yes, and hey, it's good to be back home again

Oh, the time that I can lay this tired old body down
Feel your fingers feather soft upon me
The kisses that I live for, the love that lights my way
The happiness that livin' with you brings me

It's the sweetest thing I know of, just spending time with you
It's the little things that make a house a home

When he touches me, I can't feel you anymore

When he touches me, I can't feel you anymore
He touches me with so much love, I never felt before

Goodbye's on the tip of my tongue
And now that leaving you has come
And when he touches me, I can't feel you anymore

Sweet, sweet scenes of once upon a time
I can't picture myself with anyone else

He paid the preacher after we said I do

And it hurts me because that you were right
I tell myself that I'll begin to try and forgive you but then
I go and cry myself to sleep at night
But somethin' that my mama said keeps goin' around inside my head
And if I only knew that it was cool
The time and tears will wash away this hurt I'm still in night and day
And I know that I'll get over you
Mama said one thing for certain it'll feel good when it quits hurtin'
And you know that mamas always right
And if this hurt will go away then I'll feel good again someday
And I won't ever want you in my side

And now you're spread all around just how you tore my playhouse down
And that's because you broke my heart in two
You think that love was fun and game and you don't even feel the shame
But someday it may all come home to you
And now you think you're flyin' high and you don't care how much I try
What goes up will come back down someday
And if my mama's words are true but then I won't be lovin' you
And I'll be glad I heard my mama say
Mama said one thing for certain...

Yes it's hard to sit here by myself each night

Cause our hearts are holding hands across the miles

Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free

And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine

With a place right where you wanted and the ones to fill it to
But some blows break the spell
That it hits you every day until you need to hit as well

Like a garden in the forest that the world will never see
You have no thought of answers only questions to be filled
And it feels like hell

Till the struggle of ambition turned in violence upon you
Sometimes a landslide comes
If you're hiding in that avalanche you need a place to run

I know there is enough for everyone

And there's never been a hand

If it really was the truth
Why are faces filled with anger that should only shine with youth
