Lords of Acid,"Possess me

Disgrace me

These special moments

Convulsions

Agonising pain


Abuse me 

Mislise me

My soul is breaking

And aching

Good parental care

",Special Moments,1994
Lords of Acid,"Young Boys, charming and innocent
Adolescent fun
My toys, spectral virginity
I wanna watch them come
Hey boys, I'm a candybar
A tidbit for your tongue
Those boys with your chastity
I wanna be your very first one

Young boys, dressed up in leatherettes
I wanna make 'em shine
Come down to my special route
Number sixty-nine
My boy, shock me and thrill me
You know what I desire
You're hot, nasty and spicy
You'll have to quench my fire


Chorus :
Young boys, I want you to be my toys
I'm begging you please
Young boys, I'm down on my knees
Young boys, I'll take you to heaven
Boys


Young boys, soft and so kissable
I'm waiting for their touch
They're rough, that's why I like them
I wanna taste their fudge
Horny boys, youthful and healthy
Lovegun never stops
They come, it's unbelievable
Squeeze you till you drop

Young boys, part of a family
It's me that you can trust
Right now, give me physically
A boy to dim my lust
Their dads don't like it
They wan't me to themselves
Sweet boys, tasty and horny
I'll peel away their shell

",Young Boys,1994
Lords of Acid,"I'm all alone in my room
Just me & myself - me & my gorgeous body
And my fucked up brain...
We're thinking about all the precious moments we've had together
Thinking about the places we've been, the people we've met
The lovers that wandered in & out of our lives...
The ones we used and abused and then dumped, 'cause they don't understand us the way we do
No one can rip us apart... .

Let's face it girl, we don't need nobody else
We can do it all by ourselves
We're 2 in 1 in flesh & in blood
We share everything - everything we've got
We'll stay together - forever, forever & ever & ever!!
I know what you feel - I know what you
like, I know what to do to drive you wild. 
The more you want the more you
get, we're the same - we like it wet ! !
Oh yeah - oh ! ! !

We're all alone in the room
Just me & myself - me & my hungry body
And my lusty brain
We're thinking about what we want to do together
And before you know it we're doing stuff you can only Imagine ... & dream

Let's face it girl, we don't need nobody else
We can do it all by ourselves
We're 2 in 1 in flesh & in blood

Just doing it because

But aliens are not my piece of cake

Martians don't give me the kicks 
There's just no kick 
With a little dick 

They were rotten little mean 
Horny sex machines 
In their dildo ship 
That looked really hip and cool 
But I'm no fool 
They showed their tools ha ha ha

There she goes [Repeat x3], nobody knows
About her feelings hidden deep inside

She stares at the ceiling when she's in her bed
She empties a bottle and dreams away
About her childhood in the good ol' days

Lords of Acid,"When I was a kid I was a lazy child
Always skipping school, I was really wild
My poor old dad, he went insane
'cause of his little bitch and her love with pain
So my daddy, he spanked my butt
He turned me into his super spanky slut
I begged him for his mercy with tears in my eyes
He didn't know that he just showed me paradise
Then I met my boyfriend, he was almost 85
Crawling on the floor he knew all about life
I was feeling horny and just couldn't resist
I had to have him beat me with his manly fist
I started bleeding badly, love at first strike
Since that romantic moment I crawled by his side
But just the other day I hit him right back
The poor old bastard got himself a heartattack
Now I'm a little older and addicted to the whip
When I'm chained to the wall I feel mighty hip
Rings in my nipples, metal in my cheeck
I'm the queen of the club, I look really chique
III need to be whupped, mmm, I love that stuff
Some good ol'fashioned beating, can't get enough
I still beg my dad on my two bare knees
Oh cruel daddy, come and spank me please

That you never would forget
That our love would last forever, forever 
Last night I went insane 
When I heard you call her name
If you'd go away baby

I could never stand the pain

Weird thoughts running through my brain
My blood is pumping through my vains
And there she sits, she looks at me
Her skin is pale, her mind is free
She smiles and says: how do you do?
Come with me or should I go with you?
Hey baby, you'd better watch out
You don't know what you're doing
When you're out and about
Hey baby, now listen to me
Things are never ever quite as they seem
She asks me for a cigarette
Her eyes are bright, her hair is red
Dressed like a whore, but one with style
A fantasy, I realise
This is no fiction, it's insane
Her make-up shows she knows the game
And who am I to tell her no
So I grab her coat and say let's go
Hey baby, you'd better watch out
You don't know what you're doing
When you're out and about
Hey baby, now listen to me
Things are never ever quite as they seem
She takes me to her penthouse bed
To relax my body and feed my head
With stories I never heard before
I'm waiting 'cause I know there's more
She takes off all her clothes and see
This girl has hairy legs like me
This may sound a little rude
I want sex but not with a dude

But I feel these vibrations and it's feeling so nice
The warmth of his body, the heat of the flesh
I'm fighting against it while I strip off my dress
I want you inside of me (x2)
I can visualise what you're feeling inside
As I'm touching your spine, I can make you unwind
Feel the glow from my hands, it's the heat that I send
With the oil that I blend, let's go straight, let's go to the end
Come through the mirror I want you to rock me
I'll give you the power, the will to be horny
I need you to fill me with your glistening treasures
My body is moist and it's a palace of pleasure
Lay down beside me, then torture and please me
Let's have a party all over my body
Let's come together like the pearl in the oyster
You can whip me and bite me cause that's how I want ya
I want you inside of me (x2)
(x2)
I'm your teacher tonight, witches' power delight
There's no use for your fight, let me strengthen your might
Oh now come over here, 'cause your climax is near
There's no use for your fear 'cause your master, your master is here

Now hold it let me choose, couldn't be the booze
No it's the shoes (the shoes) It's gotta be the shoes!
'Cause girlies, they clock, they stand around and jock
so I say boom shaka lak, grab the microphone then rock
To tell you the truth, when on the mic
I'll say anything that sounds good
Like jump and a grump and sound over some uh?
The Cat in the Hat and the mouse ran up the stairs
""That doesn't make no sense!"" c'mon who cares?
See even without the gift there's yours so don't be tryin' to knock me
I say what I want to say, as long it sounds funk

And now I got the flav to make the crowd go wild

I'm nearly knocking boots, but if not I'll knock teeth
Wahh! Gaga, ooh cries the baby
Smacked on the ass now the Doitall's crazy
No rattles or playpens, the crowds what I'm rapping
And yes I do Reruns, as if this boy was happening
Now January 14th has birthed the funk one
The D-Day for Dupree and yes I'm funk-ay
I got you bobbing to the funky style

Here to kick my funky style, funky this and funky that
You can work kid you know, you could practice all your life
But I still take the show and then I go home with the wife
Oh my God, funky with the style, Lord have mercy

Watch me flip the script, let me show you what the funk do
Make you call me uncle (What?) Uncle (What?) Uncle (Who?)

Now it's time to get buckwild
And watch my funky brothers freak the underground
In a second, or minute, in no times flat
(Flatline noise) Bring it back
And go grab the album to give the Lords money
Take it home to mom to say ""Ain't they funky?""

They didn't affect me, I said ""So what?"" I kept on writing rhymes
I keep my funky style perfected so no one can stop my flow
I fear no man, cause if it's on fool, then it's on (And it's on)
Don't worry not for other crews selling out
As long as Lords of the Underground stay underground
The brothers of LOTUG will keep the lyrical fitness
Don't worry about me selling out, mind your business

We're hit when we dry crawl and hit rock 'n' roller
I'm caught in the swinging, hear no ties by the Pendulum
Just? so this is how I'm killing them
K is on the M.P., Jazz is on the Technique
Marley's on the mix and now the Lords have a hit like POW
Now it's time to get buckwild
And watch my funky brothers freak the underground
In a second, or minute, in no times flat
(Flat line noise) Bring it back
And go grab the album to give the Lords money
Take it home to mom to say ""Ain't they funky?""

We gone psycho and everybody thought they did was styles
They didn't affect me, I said ""So what?"" I kept on writing rhymes
I keep my funky style perfected so no one can stop my flow
I fear no man, cause if it's on fool, then it's on (And it's on)
Don't worry not for other crews selling out
As long as Lords of the Underground stay underground
The brothers of Lotug will keep the lyrical fitness
Don't worry about me selling out, mind your business
You might say ""Damn, Mr. Funkee's throwing out""
But if you listen to the words then you'll know what I'm about
Any props you receive are the props that you earn
I'm off till the funky child returns",Psycho,1993
Lords of the Underground,"Verse One:

Well, I'm gonna creep through your area with steps that are slowly
Camoflauged and in black so niggas they don't know that
While niggas givin hi's I'm givin goodbye's
I'm still shooting persons out the corners of my eyes
But brothers know nothin and ain't seen nothin
But best yet the fest when I leave knots in their stomachs
So who want to have a little shindig with me?
Well, bro, you got it, until the return of Funky
'cause I'm that brother who was born in the under
And if you don't believe that then go ask my mutha
'cause when it gets hot I ignite what I got
Just to let you know that I blow up the spot

[CHORUS]

Verse 2:

I have an attitude that's shitty but don't need no pity
'cause all I want to do is get down to the nitty
So watch every move as I step up on this groove
My voice is filled with madness, and not ment to sooth
Say the name Doitall, say it backwards [llatiod]
Say it one more time and I'll appear by your side
My voice'll drop a measure and your ears'll feel the pleasure
You'll here my tongue lashing because my tongue is like leather
Now I be from the land where the crooks be grand
And the boys grow up to be the Stickyfinger man
Now I got you straight from the block known to rock you
But just like I got you some day you want the Do
I smell a sniff, can it be the Funkyman approachin?
Well I'ma keep roastin on behalf of the Lords
I swear to my G, I have unity, my crew have unity and this is me
Now who be I when I be that fly guy from NJ?
Some say Doitall, but my real name is Dupre
The ghetto type heart is sparked by the horror
I creep at the corner while you search for tomorrow
Tomorrow, tomorrow, they love me tomorrow 
Words I usually hear 'cause I have hip-hop by the collar
Underground the meaning:  below, beneath
That's what they think of us rhymin on these beats
Rap music - can't hear it, peep it, or speak it
That's why a Grammy, I'll probably never see it
So who in the public does the Doitall trust?
The Lords, the Lord, until my heart busts
So remember, L.O.T.U.G. is forever
You dis one, you dis the other
You dis the other, you dis the under
And you don't ever want to dis the under.

[CHORUS]",Steam from da Knot,1994
Lords of the Underground,"Tic toc, this is how we rock

Tic toc, this is how we rock
We're those same (um) brothers that brought you ""chief rock""
Now, um, underground's my style
To this I have vows
And I swear to my god
I'll always rock a crowd
So (um) peace to my area, n.w.k.
Which is scarier
So if your on the deals,
Who cares, the more the merrier
Now right off south orange
On the block of one-nine
Of course, thirteenth ave
Is my stomping grounds
I open up my chest
And to my 'hood give my heart
'cause without the heart
Then your 'hood falls apart
So respect to the cement
The park called ""the corner""
'cause that's where the doitall two was performing
Runnin' from the cops
I couldn't be stopped
'cause I was jumpin' big gates that connected the blocks
Now before making records
The 'hood was my savior
But now I'm making tunes to make you jam wit 'cha neighbor

Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and do it for your block (um)

Throw your hands in the air and please don't stop (um)

Well, I be the funk-ular
Ultra-funk-ular
Gamma-funk-ular
Half you rappers out there couldn't see me with binoculars
Anyone who thinks he'll take me out is just a dreamer
If you think you're the bomb, then I'm hiroshima
When I die,
I hope they're making records up in heaven
On a scale of one to ten
I'm like 100-5th-11
And sticks-and-stones-may-break-my-bones
But if you ever try to dis the lords, then it's on
I go on beat
Off beat
Then jump right back on time
I drop another rhyme
And talk about your fat ugly mama
M.c.'s cannot rock me
I'm stone-proof
Me grabbin' the mic
Is like superman running to a phone booth
Straight from martin luther king boulevard
In the heart of newark, new jersey
Make you say ""lord have mercy""
If you step up in my face
Then it's do or die
And I'm gonna make you cry!

Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and do it for your block (um)
Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and please don't stop (um)
Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and represent your block (um)
Tic toc, this is how we rock
(tic toc, you don't stop)

Well, times have changed
Not only for the urban
But also for suburban
We get props, we're deservin'
From black kids, to white kids
I see them bob their heads,
From the blond hair, to redhead
I even seen a dread
So now it doesn't matter
As the clock winds down
With the tic and the toc
Because they love the sound
But people 'round your area
Say you sell out
Because you sell a million copies
And your tour goes baow
So do it for yourself
And do it for the 'hood
But do it from the heart
'cause that's when it's good
Now tell me what's gonna happen
After the rappin'
When the clock  ticks away
And ain't nothin' happenin'

I remember way back in the days on my block
When the kids used to meet up in the hallway and rock
On martin luther king's boulevard
With p.c., wise, easy ed, and my brother hard bernard
Used to hit the ill rhymes from the head
While I'd hit the beat on the wall until my hands turned red
You had the shorty two m.c.'s
The educated three
I have to give them props for helping me be me
Now I'm the one who's educated
I suffered but I made it
I only write rhymes that will be appreciated
No matter how large I get
The fire still burns
'cause from the 'hood I came
And to the 'hood I must return

Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and do it for your block (um)

Throw your hands in the air and please don't stop (um)

And Orange Krush became amazed over me
Took me inside of his Cadillac
The chauffeur drove off and we never came back

And now they got me rockin' on the microphone
Then takin' autographs, and here's the laugh
Champagne caviar, and bubble bath

Lordz of Brooklyn," 

[Verse One: performed by ADMoney]
Listen up here's a tale about a white kid
That had to make some cash
Dropped out of school ain't never went to class
Sold a little grass, robbed a couple cars
Had a name around the neighborhood for fightin' in the bars
Had a chip on his shoulder
He's a chip off the block
When he drinks, he drinks alone
Grabbed the whiskey took a swig
Heard the fiddle didn't jig
Cause he's watchin' everybody round him blowin' up gettin' big
So he picks out a ride, slim jims the door
Now he's runnin' red lights and beatin' stop signs
Cops are on his ass and he's runnin' out of time
So he hits the chop shop, makes drop, cause he's sick of bein' poor
He's white trash and he's knockin' on your door

[Pre Chorus]
Somebody's knockin' at my door, somebody's ringin' my bell

[Chorus]
I'm white trash and I'm knockin' on your door
White Trash and I'm knockin' on your door
White Trash and I'm knockin' on your door
I know you hear me knockin' so what you hidin' for

[Verse Two: performed by ADMoney]
He ain't never joined the, he ain't no altar boy
He's an angel with a dirty face like Pretty Boy Floyd
He's the kind a kid sittin' in the park if you want to cop a lid
And if he got popped he wouldn't rat he do the bid
Cause he's tuff like rugby down right ugly
If you owe him money you'll be black and blue and bloody
From his tenement slum right down to the gutter
He might run a number, sell some iron to the brothers
Cause the cops beat him down and it doesn't make the news
But to him that's payin' dues when you're walkin' in his shoes

[Pre Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: performed by ADMoney]
It's just another night in the old gin mill
He got a pocket of old dirty dollar bills
He buys his boys a round, they toast it up, they shoot it down
They're gettin' stared at by some off duty cops sittin' down
So what you lookin' at you want to catch a smack
He finishes his beer and his boys take his back
And they mix it up, they're brawlin' on the ground
The cop pulls his pistol and fires off a round
Yo he should of got a job, should of went to class
Now he's layin' all alone, still poor white trash

Che mi faccio compagnia
Io che gioco con la mente
Che non sono intelligente

Io amici non ne ho uh 
Io amici non ne ho
Con la foto di Guevara
Vado a letto la mattina
Incazzata come prima
Sparo in cuffia regolare
Solo l'internazionale
Per sognare sul finale
Io amici non ne ho
E non ci sto più
A guardare le stelle nel cielo
Io non credo più
Che si vince soltanto col cuore perché
Amici non ne ho
È opinione generale
Quella che non so cantare
E che vesto sempre male
Per la stampa nazionale
Mi suicido per campare
Come sponsor l'ospedale
Amici non ne ho
Io non ci sto più
A guardare le stelle nel cielo
Anche se quel blu
Alla notte da meno colore
Io non ci sto più

Ai balordi come me

A chi non ho incontrato

Ai dimenticati 
Ai playboy finiti

A chi si guarda nello specchio e da tempo non si vede più
A chi non ha uno specchio e comunque non per questo non ce la fa più
A chi a ha lavorato
A chi è stato troppo solo e va sempre più giù

A chi ha cercato la maniera
E non l'ha trovata mai
Alla faccia che ho stasera
Dedicato a chi ha paura e a chi sta nei guai
Dedicato ai cattivi
Che poi così cattivi non sono mai

Per chi ti vuole una volta sola
E poi non ti cerca più
Dedicato a che capisce quando il gioco finisce e non si butta giù
Ai miei pensieri
A come ero ieri
E anche per me

Loredana Bertè,"Il mare d'inverno
È solo un film in bianco e nero
Visto alla TV
E verso l'interno
Qualche nuvola
Dal cielo

Sabbia bagnata

Che il vento
Stà portando via
Punti invisibili
Rincorsi dai cani
Stanche parabole
Di vecchi gabbiani

Si colorerà

E una musica

Discoteche illuminate
Piene di bugie

Uno strano concerto
E un ombrellone
Che rimane aperto

Vissuti di già

Che hai un'altra storia
Che quando sei con lei, poi l'abbracci
E la stringi

Amo solo te
A cosa serve l'amore, se ti spezza il cuore
Se fa solo male, se ti fa impazzire
Dal dolore
Avrei pernsato di chiamarti

Con gli occhi dolci quanto basta
Per farmi dire sempre
""Sono ancora tua""

Quando si addormentava sul mio seno
E lo scaldavo al fuoco umano della gelosia

Che strano uomo avevo io
Mi teneva sotto braccio
E se cercavo di essere seria
Per lui ero solo un pagliaccio

E poi mi diceva sempre
""Non vali che un po' più di niente""
Io mi vestivo di ricordi
Per affrontare il presente

E ripensavo ai primi tempi
Quando ero innocente
A quando avevo nei capelli
La luce rossa dei coralli

Quando ambiziosa come nessuna
Mi specchiavo nella luna
E lo obbligavo a dirmi sempre

""Sei bellissima, sei bellissima""
Accecato d'amore mi stava a guardare
""Sei bellissima, sei bellissima""

Chiudono troppo presto, sì, oh

Nine months and better
He fairly won my heart
Wrote me a letter
With his hammer in his hand
He looked quite clever
And if I was with my love
I'd live forever.

But where is my love gone
With his cheeks like roses
And his good black Billycock on
Decked round with primroses
I'm afraid the scorching sun
Will shine and burn his beauty
And if I was with my love
I'd do my duty.

Strange news is coming to town
Strange news is carried
Strange mews flies up and down
That my love is married.
I wish them both much joy
Though they can't hear me
And may God reward him well
For the slighting of me.

Don't you remember when
You lay beside me
And you said you'd marry me
And not deny me
If I said I'd marry you
It was only for to try you
So bring your witness love
And I'll not deny you.

No witness have I none
Save God Almighty
And may he reward you well
For the slighting of me

And be proved deceitful.

The dim grey sands with light
By far off furthest roses
We foot it all the night
Weaving olden dances
Mingling hands and mingling glances
Till the moon has taken flight
To and fro we leap
And chase the frothy bubbles
Whilst the world is full of troubles
And is anxious in its sleep.

Where the wandering water gushes
From the hills above glen car
In pools among the rushes
That scarce could bathe a star

And whispering in their ears
Give them unquiet dreams
Leaning softly out
From ferns that drop their tears
Over the young streams

Away with us he's going
The solemned eyed
He'll hear no more the lowing
Of the calves on the warm hillside
Or the kettle on the hob
Sing peace unto his breast
Or see the brown mice bob
Round and round the oatmeal chest.

Loreena McKennitt,"Health, love and peace be all here in this place
By your leave we shall sing, concerning our King. 

Our King is well-dressed in silks of the best
In ribbons so rare no king can compare. 

We have traveled many miles over hedges and stiles,
In search of our King unto you we bring. 

We have powder and shot to conquer the lot,
We have cannon and ball to conquer them all. 

Old Christmas is past, twelve tide is the last
And we bid you adieu, great joy to the new",The King,1987
Loreena McKennitt,"Come all you lads and lasses, I'd have you give attention
To these few lines I'm about to write here,
Tis of the four seasons of the year that I shall mention,
The beauty of all things doth appear.
And now you are young and all in your prosperity,
Come cheer up your hearts and revive like the spring
Join off in pairs like the birds in February
That St. Valentines D'ay it forth do bring.

Then cometh Spring, which all the land doth nourish;
The fields are beginning to be decked with green,
The trees put forth their buds and the blossoms they doflourish,
And the tender blades of corn on the earth are to be seen.
Don't you see the little lambs by the dams a-playing?
The cuckoo is singing in the shady grove.
The flowers they are springing, the maids they go a-Maying,
In love all hearts seem now to move.

Next cometh Autumn with the sun so hot and piercing;
The sportsman goes forth with his dog and his gun
To fetch down the woodcock, the partridge and the pheasant,
For health and for profit as well as for fun.
Behold, with loaded apple-trees the farmer is befriended,
They will fill up his casks that have long laid dry.
All nature seems to weary now, her task is nearly ended,
And more of the seasons will come by and by.

When night comes on with song and tale we pass the wintryhours;
By keeping up a cheerful heart we hope for better days.
We tend the cattle, sow the seed, give work unto the ploughers,
With patience wait till winter yields before the sun's fairrays.
And so the world goes round and round, and every time andseason
With pleasure and with profit crowns the passage of the year,
And so through every time of life, to him who acts with reason,
The beauty of all things doth appear.",The Seasons,1987
Loreena McKennitt,"Good people all, this Christmas-time,
Consider well and bear in mind
What our good God for us has done
In sending his beloved Son.
With Mary holy we should pray
To God with love this Christmas day;
In Bethlehem upon that morn
There was a blessed Messiah born.

The night before that happy tide
The noble Virgin and her guide
Were long time seeking up and down
To find a lodging in the town.
But mark how all things came to pass;
From every door repelled alas!
As long foretold, their refuge all
Was but an humble ox's stall.

There were three wise men from afar
Directed by a glorious star,
And on they wandered night and day
Until they came where Jesus lay,
And when they came unto that place
Where our beloved Messiah was,
They humbly cast them at his feet,
With gifts of gold and incense sweet.

Near Bethlehem did shepherds keep
Their flocks of lambs and feeding sheep;
To whom God's angels did appear,
Which put the shepherds in great fear.
'Prepare and go', the angles said.
'To Bethlehem, be not afraid:
For there you'll find, this happy morn,
A princely babe, sweet Jesus born.

With thankful heart and joyful mind,
The shepherds went the babe to find,
And as God's angel had foretold,
They did our saviour Christ behold.
Within a manger he was laid,
And by his side the virgin maid,
Attending on the Lord of life,
Who came on earth to end all strife.",The Wexford Carol,1987
Loreena McKennitt,"Alas my love you do me wrong
To cast me off discourteously;
And I have loved you oh so long
Delighting in your company.

Greensleeves was my delight,
Greensleeves my heart of gold
Greensleeves was my heart of joy
And who but my lady Greensleeves.

I have been ready at your hand
To grant whatever thou would'st crave;
I have waged both life and land
Your love and goodwill for to have.

Greensleeves was my delight,
Greensleeves my heart of gold
Greensleeves was my heart of joy
And who but my lady Greensleeves.

Thy petticoat of slender white
With gold embroidered gorgeously;
Thy petticoat of silk and white
And these I bought gladly.

And who but my lady Greensleeves.",Greensleeves,1991
Loreena McKennitt,"O bonny Portmore, I am sorry to see
Such a woeful destruction of your ornament tree
For it stood on your shore for many's the long day
Till the long boats from Antrim came to float it away.

O bonny Portmore, you shine where you stand
And the more I think on you the more I think long
If I had you now as I had once before
All the lords in Old England would not purchase Portmore.

All the birds in the forest they bitterly weep
Saying, ""Where will we shelter or shall we sleep?""
For the Oak and the Ash, they are all cutten down
And the walls of bonny Portmore are all down to the ground.

Loreena McKennitt,"On either side of the river lie
Long fields of barley and of rye,
That clothe the world and meet the sky;
And thro' the field the road run by
To many-towered Camelot;
And up and down the people go,
Gazing where the lilies blow
Round an island there below,
The island of Shalott.

Willows whiten, aspens quiver,
Little breezes dusk and shiver
Thro' the wave that runs for ever
By the island in the river
Flowing down to Camelot.
Four grey walls, and four grey towers,
Overlook a space of flowers,
And the silent isle imbowers
The Lady of Shalott.

Only reapers, reaping early,
In among the bearded barley
Hear a song that echoes cheerly
From the river winding clearly
Down to tower'd Camelot; 
And by the moon the reaper weary,
Piling sheaves in uplands airy,
Listening, whispers ""'tis the fairy
The Lady of Shalott.""

There she weaves by night and day
A magic web with colours gay,
She has heard a whisper say,
A curse is on her if she stay
To look down to Camelot.
She knows not what the curse may be,
And so she weaveth steadily,
And little other care hath she,
The Lady of Shalott.

And moving through a mirror clear
That hangs before her all the year,
Shadows of the world appear.
There she sees the highway near
Winding down to Camelot;
And sometimes thro' the mirror blue
The Knights come riding two and two.
She hath no loyal Knight and true,
The Lady Of Shalott.

But in her web she still delights
To weave the mirror's magic sights,
For often thro' the silent nights
A funeral, with plumes and lights
And music, went to Camelot;
Or when the Moon was overhead,
Came two young lovers lately wed.
""I am half sick of shadows,"" said
The Lady Of Shalott.

A bow-shot from her bower-eaves,
He rode between the barley sheaves,
The sun came dazzling thro' the leaves,
And flamed upon the brazen greaves
Of bold Sir Lancelot.
A red-cross knight for ever kneel'd
To a lady in his shield,
That sparkled on the yellow field,
Beside remote Shalott.

His broad clear brow in sunlight glow'd;
On burnish'd hooves his war-horse trode;
From underneath his helmet flow'd
His coal-black curls as on he rode,
As he rode back to Camelot.
From the bank and from the river
he flashed into the crystal mirror,
""Tirra Lirra,"" by the river
Sang Sir Lancelot.

She left the web, she left the loom,
She made three paces taro' the room,
She saw the water-lily bloom,
She saw the helmet and the plume,
She looked down to Camelot.
Out flew the web and floated wide;
The mirror cracked from side to side; 
""The curse is come upon me,"" cried
The Lady of Shalott.

In the stormy east-wind straining,
The pale yellow woods were waning,
The broad stream in his banks complaining.
Heavily the low sky raining
Over towered Camelot;
Down she came and found a boat
Beneath a willow left afloat,
And round about the prow she wrote
The Lady of Shalott

And down the river's dim expanse
Like some bold seer in a trance,
Seeing all his own mischance - 
With a glassy countenance
Did she look to Camelot.
And at the closing of the day
She loosed the chain and down she lay;
The broad stream bore her far away,
The Lady of Shalott.

Heard a carol, mournful, holy,
Chanted loudly, chanted lowly,
Till her blood was frozen slowly,
And her eyes were darkened wholly,
Turn'd to towered Camelot.
For ere she reach'd upon the tide
The first house by the water-side,
Singing in her song she died,
The Lady of Shalott.

Under tower and balcony,
By garden-wall and gallery,
A gleaming shape she floated by,
Dead-pale between the houses high,
Silent into Camelot.
Out upon the wharfs they came,
Knight and Burgher, Lord and Dame,
And round the prow they read her name,
The Lady of Shalott.

Who is this? And what is here?
And in the lighted palace near
Died the sound of royal cheer;
And they crossed themselves for fear,
All the Knights at Camelot;
But Lancelot mused a little space
He said, ""She has a lovely face;
God in his mercy lend her grace,
The Lady of Shalott.""",The Lady of Shalott,1994

On the Feast of Stephen
When the snow lay 'round about
Deep and crisp and even
Brightly shone the moon that night
Though the frost was cruel
When a poor man came in sight
Gath'ring winter fuel
""Hither, page, and stand by me,
If thou know'st it, telling
Yonder peasant, who is he?
Where and what his dwelling?""
""Sire, he lives a good league hence,
Underneath the mountain
Right against the forest fence
By Saint Agnes' fountain.""
""Bring me flesh and bring me wine
Bring me pine-logs hither
Thou and I shall see him dine
When we bear them thither.""
Page and monarch, forth they went
Forth they went together
Through the rude wind's wild lament
And the bitter weather.
""Sire, the night is darker now
And the wind blows stronger
Fails my heart, I know not how
I can go no longer.""
""Mark my footsteps, good my page
Tread thou in them boldly
Thou shall find the winter's rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly.""
In his master's step he trod
Where the snow lay dinted

Which the Saint had printed

Wealth or rank possessing
Ye, who now will bless the poor
Shall yourselves find blessing.",Good King Wenceslas,1995
Loreena McKennitt,"The wind was a torrent of darkness
Among the gusty trees

Tossed upon the cloudy seas
The road was a ribbon of moonlight
Over the purple moor
When the highwayman came riding
Riding, riding,
The highwayman came riding 
Up to the old inn door

He'd a french cocked hat at his forehead
A bunch of lace at his chin
A coat of claret velvet
And breeches of brown doe-skin
They fitted with nary a wrinkle
His boots were up to the thigh
And he rode with a jeweled twinkle
His pistol butts a-twinkle
His rapier hilt a-twinkle
Under the jeweled sky

And over cobbles he clattered
And clashed in the dark inn-yard
And he tapped with his whip on the shutters
But all was locked and barred
He whistled a tune to the window
And who should be waiting there
But the landlord's black-eyed daughter
Bess, the landlord's daughter
Plaiting a dark red love knot 
Into her long black hair

""One kiss my bonny sweetheart

He scarce could reach her hand
But she loosened her hair in the casement

As a black cascade of perfume
Came tumbling over his breast

He did not come at the dawning 
He did not come at noon
And out of the tawny sunset
Before the rise of the moon
When the road was a gypsy's ribbon
Looping the purple moor

Marching, marching
King George's men came marching
Up to the old inn door

They said no word to the landlord
They drank his ale instead
But they gagged his daughter and bound her
To the foot of her narrow bed

With muskets at their side
There was death at every window
Hell at one dark window

The road that he would ride

With many a sniggering jest
They had bound a musket beside her
With the barrel beneath her breast
""Now keep good watch"" and they kissed her

""Look for me by the moonlight
Watch for me by the moonlight
I'll come to thee by the moonlight

Her eyes grew wide for a moment
She drew a last deep breath
Then her finger moved in the moonlight
Her musket shattered the moonlight
Shattered her breast in the moonlight
And warned him with her death

He turned, he spurred to the west
He did not know she stood 
Bowed with her head o'er musket
Drenched with her own red blood
Not till the dawn he heard it 
His face grew grey to hear

She hath no loyal Knight and true, 
The Lady Of Shalott. 

But in her web she still delights 
To weave the mirror's magic sights, 
For often thro' the silent nights 
A funeral, with plumes and lights 

And music, went to Camelot; 

Or when the Moon was overhead, 
Came two young lovers lately wed. 
""I am half sick of shadows,"" said 
The Lady Of Shalott. 

A bow-shot from her bower-eaves, 
He rode between the barley sheaves, 
The sun came dazzling thro' the leaves, 
And flamed upon the brazen greaves 

Of bold Sir Lancelot. 

A red-cross knight for ever kneel'd 
To a lady in his shield, 
That sparkled on the yellow field, 
Beside remote Shalott. 

His broad clear brow in sunlight glow'd; 
On burnish'd hooves his war-horse trode; 
From underneath his helmet flow'd 
His coal-black curls as on he rode, 

As he rode back to Camelot. 

From the bank and from the river 
He flashed into the crystal mirror, 
""Tirra Lirra,"" by the river 
Sang Sir Lancelot. 

She left the web, she left the loom, 
She made three paces taro' the room, 
She saw the water-lily bloom, 
She saw the helmet and the plume, 

She looked down to Camelot. 

Out flew the web and floated wide; 
The mirror cracked from side to side; 
""The curse is come upon me,"" cried 
The Lady of Shalott. 

In the stormy east-wind straining, 
The pale yellow woods were waning, 
The broad stream in his banks complaining. 
Heavily the low sky raining 

Over towered Camelot; 

Down she came and found a boat 
Beneath a willow left afloat, 
And round about the prow she wrote 
The Lady of Shalott 

And down the river's dim expanse 
Like some bold seer in a trance, 
Seeing all his own mischance - 
With a glassy countenance 

Did she look to Camelot. 

And at the closing of the day 
She loosed the chain and down she lay; 
The broad stream bore her far away, 
The Lady of Shalott. 

Heard a carol, mournful, holy, 
Chanted loudly, chanted lowly, 
Till her blood was frozen slowly, 
And her eyes were darkened wholly, 

Turn'd to towered Camelot. 

For ere she reach'd upon the tide 
The first house by the water-side, 
Singing in her song she died, 
The Lady of Shalott. 

Under tower and balcony, 
By garden-wall and gallery, 
A gleaming shape she floated by, 
Dead-pale between the houses high, 

Silent into Camelot. 

Out upon the wharfs they came, 
Knight and Burgher, Lord and Dame, 
And round the prow they read her name, 
The Lady of Shalott. 

Who is this? And what is here? 
And in the lighted palace near 
Died the sound of royal cheer; 
And they crossed themselves for fear, 

All the Knights at Camelot; 

But Lancelot mused a little space 
He said, ""She has a lovely face; 
God in his mercy lend her grace, 
The Lady of Shalott.""",The Lady of Shalott [Live][*],2005
Loreena McKennitt,"Where dips the rocky highland
Of sleuth wood in the lake
There lies a leafy island
Where flapping herons wake
The drowsy water rats
There we've hid our fairy vats
Full of berries
And of reddest stolen cherries.

Come away oh human child
To the waters and the wild
With a faery hand in hand
For the world's more full of weeping
Than you can understand

Where the wave of moonlight glosses
The dim grey sands with light
By far off furthest rosses
We foot it all the night
Weaving olden dances
Mingling hands and mingling glances
Till the moon has taken flight
To and fro we leap
And chase the frothy bubbles
Whilst the world is full of troubles
And is anxious in its sleep.

Come away oh human child
To the waters and the wild
With a faery hand in hand
For the world's more full of weeping
Than you can understand

Where the wandering water gushes
From the hills above glen car
In pools among the rushes
That scarce could bathe a star
We seek for slumbering trout
And whispering in their ears
Give them unquiet dreams
Leaning softly out
From ferns that drop their tears
Over the young streams

Come away oh human child
To the waters and the wild
With a faery hand in hand
For the world's more full of weeping
Than you can understand

Away with us he's going
The solemned eyed
He'll hear no more the lowing
Of the calves on the warm hillside
Or the kettle on the hob
Sing peace unto his breast
Or see the brown mice bob
Round and round the oatmeal chest.

Come away oh human child
To the waters and the wild
With a faery hand in hand
For the world's more full of weeping
Than you can understand

For he comes, the human child
To the waters and the wild
With a faery hand in hand

I sat there with my true love
My heart strove to choose between
The old love and the new love

While soft the wind blew down the glade

Of foreign chains around us

I'll seek at morning early
And join the brave United Men
While soft winds shook the barley""

'Twas sad I kissed away her tears
Her arms around me clinging
When to my ears the fateful shot
Came out the wild wood ringing
The bullet pierced my true love's breast
In life's young spring so early
And all upon my breast she died
While soft winds shook the barley

I bore her to some mountain stream
And many's the summer blossom
I placed with branches soft and green
About her gore-stained bosom
I wept and kissed her clay-cold corpse
Then rushed o'er vale and valley
My vengeance on the foe to wreak
While soft winds shook the barley

'Twas blood for blood without remorse
I took at Oulart Hollow
I placed my true love's clay-cold corpse

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

And when Linekar scored
Bobby belting the ball

Share together

Lorenzo,"Proprio come un albero che vive in mezzo agli alberi 
Mi sento quando giro per il mondo cerco di far si che 
Il vento non mi butti giù e di affondar le mie radici 
Nel profondo, prendo il sole in faccia per far si che 
Le mie foglie stiano bene appiccicate lungo questi rami 
Ospito tra le mie braccia nidi di uccellini e do rifugio
Nel mio fusto a molti sciami

Proprio come un albero mi spoglio e mi rivesto a seconda 
Se c'è freddo o c'è calore dentro la genetica la mappa 
Delle cellule descrive a quale genere appartengo se sono 
Una quercia oppure un salice piangente oppure un baobab od 
Un saggio di pianura quello che è importante è che al mondo 
Ci sia spazio per qualsiasi espressione di natura
Prendo il sole in faccia bevo molta pioggia io non ho 

Problemi a convivere con gli altri sono pronto ad accettare 
La mia sorte sono consapevole del fatto che più o meno presto 
O tardi ci sarà per me la morte quella che totò ha definito 
La livella e che alla fine ci livella tutti uguali alberi 
Bestiole re profeti presidenti calciatori poveretti ed animali
Quello che io penso come albero parlante è che la vita sia 
Questione di radici più sono profonde più ti puoi portar lontano 

Incontrando gente conquistando amici perché io ho scoperto che 
Le mie radici in fondo sono lì per procurarmi le risorse 
Cosicché con le mie foglie io possa affrontare venti forti e 
Possa farmi delle corse prendo il sole in faccia bevo molta pioggia 
Andare di qua e di là sconfinare allegramente farmi un pò ogni tipo 
Di esperienza incontrare gente allargare le vedute e allenare pure 
Un po' l'intelligenza senza mai scordare cosa sono da dove vengo 

E pure dove voglio andare con le mie radici belle salde nel terreno 
Io coi rami io mi posso allontanare perché c'ho bisogno della terra 
Sotto I piedi dove dare fondamenta alla speranza proprio come un 
Albero mi adatto un poco a tutto basta solo un po' di clima di 
Accoglienza no no no alla violenza non rivendico nessuna appartenenza 
Tranne quella al mondo degli esseri viventi col diritto di affondare 
Le radici sogno un universo dove ogni differenza sia la base per poter 

Essere amici prendo il sole in faccia bevo molta pioggia proprio 
Come un albero mi colloco nel mezzo tra la terra e il cielo proprio

Sostanza ed energia",L' Albero (La Band),2000

Per la prima volta nella vita mia mi trovo a saper 
Quello che lascio e a non saper immaginar quello che 
Trovo mi offrono un incarico di responsabilità portare 
Questa nave verso una rotta che nessuno sa è la mia età 
A mezz'aria in questa condizione di stabilità precaria
Ipnotizzato dalle pale di un ventilatore sul soffitto
Mi giro e mi rigiro sul mio letto mi muovo col passo 
Pesante in questa stanza umida di un porto che non 
Ricordo il nome il fondo del caffè confonde il dove 

E il come e per la prima volta so cos'è la nostalgia 
La commozione nel mio bagaglio panni sporchi di 
Navigazione per ogni strappo un porto per ogni porto 
In testa una canzone è dolce stare in mare quando son
Gli altri a far la direzione senza preoccupazione 
Soltanto fare ciò che c'è da fare e cullati dall'onda 
Notturna sognare la mamma il mare
Mi offrono un incarico di responsabilità mi hanno detto
Che una nave c'ha bisogno di un comandante mi hanno 
Detto che la paga è interessante e che il carico è segreto

Ed importante il pensiero della responsabilità si è fatto 
Grosso è come dover saltare al di là di un fosso che mi 
Divide dai tempi spensierati di un passato che è passato 
Saltare verso il tempo indefinito dell'essere adulto di 
Fronte a me la nebbia mi nasconde la risposta alla mia 
Paura cosa sarò dove mi condurrà la mia natura? la faccia
Di mio padre prende forma sullo specchio lui giovane io 
Vecchio le sue parole che rimbombano dentro al mio orecchio

Accorgerai e mi dirai se ho ragione"" arriva il giorno in 

Cui bisogna prendere una decisione e adesso è questo giorno 
Di monsone col vento che non ha una direzione guardando il 
Cielo un senso di oppressione ma è la mia età dove si sa come 
Si era e non si sa dove si va, cosa si sarà che responsabilità
Si hanno nei confronti degli esseri umani che ti vivono 
Accanto e attraverso questo vetro vedo il mondo come una 
Scacchiera dove ogni mossa che io faccio può cambiare la 
Partita intera ed ho paura di essere mangiato ed ho paura 
Pure di mangiare mi perdo nelle letture, I libri dello zen 

Ed il vangelo l'astrologia che mi racconta il cielo galleggio
Alla ricerca di un me stesso con il quale poter dialogare ma 
Questa linea d'ombra non me la fa incontrare. mi offrono un 
Incarico di responsabilità non so cos'è il coraggio se prendere
E mollare tutto se scegliere la fuga od affrontare questa realtà
Difficile da interpretare ma bella da esplorare provare a 
Immaginare cosa sarò quando avrò attraversato il mare portato
Questo carico importante a destinazione dove sarò al riparo 

Dal prossimo monsone mi offrono un incarico di responsabilità 
Domani andrò giù al porto e gli dirò che sono pronto a partire
Getterò I bagagli in mare studierò le carte e aspetterò di 
Sapere per dove si parte quando si parte e quando passerà il

L'unica cosa che ci è data di fare 
È avere il tempo da poter organizzare 
Si da organizzare 
Da dividere in passi 
Cassa rullante la mia voce 
Ed i bassi bassi medi e alti 
Per fare salti per far ballare il pubblico sugli spalti 
E non m'annoio e no che non m'annoio 
Non m'annoio 
Io no che non m'annoio 
Non m'annoio no che non m'annoio 
No che non m'annoio 

Tempo 109 battute al minuto 
Quando finisce forse ti sarà piaciuto 
La chiave per capire questo genere di suono 
Che a molte orecchie può sembrare frastuono 
E liberare la tua parte migliore chiudere 
Gli occhi aprire bene il cuore 
Che non c'è musica che vale di più 
Di quella musica che vuoi sentire tu 
E non mi stanco 
E no che non mi stanco non mi stanco 
Io no che non mi stanco 
Non mi stanco no che non mi stanco 
No che non mi stanco 

Sono passate 1000 generazioni 
Dai rockabilli punk e capelloni 
I metallari i paninari e sorcini 
E ogni volta gli stessi casini 
Perché i ragazzi non si fanno vedere 
Sono sfuggenti come le pantere 
E quando li cattura una definizione 
Il mondo è pronto a una nuova generazione 
E non m'annoio e no che non m'annoio 
Non m'annoio 
Io no che non m'annoio 
Non m'annoio no che non m'annoio 
No che non m'annoio 

Tempo 
Prezioso 
Conosco un modo per rimanere a galla 
Non abboccare a questa grande balla 
Del tempo che ti fa cambiare che ti modella
E più vai avanti più la vita è meno bella 
Sfuggi dal gruppo e pensa con la tua testa 
E stare insieme sarà sempre una festa 
Se riuscirai a sopravvivere lontano dal branco 
Non c'è noia non sarai mai stanco 
Sfuggi dal gruppo e non lasciarti fregare 
E non m'annoio io continuo a ballare 
E non mi rompo 
No che non mi rompo non mi rompo 
Io no che non mi rompo 
Non mi rompo no che non mi rompo 
No che non mi rompo

Tempo quando stai bene lui va via come un lampo 
Quando ti annoi un attimo sembra eterno 
Il paradiso può diventare inferno tempo
Ti frego con il ritmo ti cattura 
E ti chiudo in una ritmica di aspetto molto duro 
E ti organizzo in battute in quattro quarti 
All'ora non avrai tempo di liberarti
E con le gambe muovo anche il cervello 
E allora il tempo sarà mio fratello 
E come lui mi darà sempre una mano 
Mi darà tempo per andare lontano 
E come Ulisse cercherò di ritrovare 
Quella mia isola ma tanto viaggiare 
Sarà piacevole sarà indispensabile 
Anche se l'isola sarà irraggiungibile (ahaaaaa) 
E non m'annoio e no che non m'annoio 
Non m'annoio 
Io no che non m'annoio 
Non m'annoio no che non m'annoio 
No che non m'annoio 
E non mi stanco 
E no che non mi stanco non mi stanco 
Io no che non mi stanco 
Non mi stanco no che non mi stanco 
No che non mi stanco 
E non mi rompo 
No che non mi rompo non mi rompo 
Io no che non mi rompo 
Non mi rompo no che non mi rompo 
No che non mi rompo

Dove la vita si fa preziosa e il nostro amore diventa azioni
Dove le regole non esistono esistono solo le eccezioni

E un buddha sereno sopra il comodino
Conosco a memoria il cantico delle creature

Del corano see'ho pure un talismano

Di ciò che è conformismo di ogni moralismo yeahhh

Cancelli dogane e facce scure

Di uomini di donne di occhi e di voci
Il gallo che canta e la città si sveglia
Ed un pensiero vola giù alla mia famiglia
E poi si allarga fino al mondo intero
E poi su vola alto fino al cielo
Il sole la luna e marte e giove
Saturno coi suoi anelli e poi le stelle nuove
E quelle anziane piene di memoria

Che con la loro luce hanno fatto la storia
Gloria a tutta l'energia che see'è nell'aria

la respiro per un po'
e poi vado nel posto vogliono acqua

un giorno ho visto un bambino che correva per strada
gli ho chiesto scusa dove corri bambino
mi ha detto sto inseguendo la mia ombra
così come tu segui il destino
e se la prendo poi me la tengo

sarò un capitano sopra una nave

gli ho chiesto scusa cosa stai facendo
mi ha detto lo pulisco così vale di più
lo compro poi lo lavo e lo vendo
ma scusa cento lire sono sempre le stesse,
pulite o sporche valgono uguale
lei mi ha guardato un poco stupita
e poi ha continuato a lavare
la sera ho aperto il salvadanaio
e di monete io ne avevo un bel po'
e in bagno ho cominciato a lavare

un giorno ho visto uno che leggeva al contrario
gli ho chiesto scusa che cosa stai facendo

Porque me sale mucho más fácil con una de mis canciones
Para lograr que sientan hasta muros y platones

Para decirte que desde que te vi siempre es mayo

Y está lleno de colores
Y todavía en los árboles

Tarde que temprano van a
Derramar su fruto
Y dime cómo estas

Me gusta tu trasero, casi redondo
Que torna en un satélite a cada ser viviente
Me gustas por que eres, inteligente

Se ve muy claro en tus manos como las mueves
Y haces que hasta los sentimientos siempre me renueves
Tus caderas son los andes y tus pechos los volcanes
Me gusta tu buen gusto en la ropa con que sales
Que está muy por encima de la moda del momento

Aquí estaré cada mañana
No debes creer las cosas que otros te digan de mí

De cine de romances solo falsas ilusiones
Yo te ofrezco la verdad, cuerpo, alma y un cerebro

Ignorándose hacia delante
Y después no sé porqué
Porqué, quién sabe cómo
Después no sé porqué
Porqué quien sabe cómo
Dos almas de repente se generan un destino
Palacios, ruido, smog son como un jardín divino
Personas entregadas intercambian un anillo
En un departamento que sera como un castillo

E son scappato via perché 
Da troppo amore 
Non so respirare

Mi fa sentire un pellegrino 
Un penitente
Un cavaliere errante 
Un mezzo deficiente

È una tribù che balla oheo

È una tribù che balla ohoh
È una tribù che balla oheo

È una tribù che balla al ritmo di un tamburo
Che picchia nella mente a chi si sente sicuro
Rinchiuso in un castello fatto di pregiudizi
Confuso nel discernere la virtù dai vizi
La musica è uno sparo, impedisce di parlare
Ti obbliga a pensare a quello che dovrai dire
Nel momento in cui sul piatto finirà questa canzone
Sarai un uomo pronto per la rivoluzione
Senza nessuna bomba, ma con tanto rumore
La musica finisce, ma rimane l'amore

È una tribù che balla ohoh
È una tribù che balla oheo
È una tribù che balla oho
È una tribù che balla oheo

È una tribù che balla e la pace sia con voi
La carica ti scarica più forte che puoi
È l'energia del sole per quanto ce ne resta
Che muove le tue gambe e accende la tua testa
Riempi la riserva e vai a manetta
E quando il tuo sudore bagnerà la tua maglietta
Ricordati che tu sei unico al mondo
E non esiste primo e non esiste secondo
Esiste una tribù, esistono i fratelli
Che più sono diversi e più sono fratelli
Ognuno ha la sua storia e le sue tradizioni
Ognuno il suo colore e le sue religioni
Ma il battito del cuore è lo stesso per tutti
La musica, la musica fa muovere tutti
Ma il battito del cuore è per tutti lo stesso
La musica, la musica e il resto nel cesso

È una tribù che balla oheo

Tra I colpevoli le vittime e I superstiti 
Un cane abbaia alla luna 
Un uomo guarda la sua mano 
Sembra quella di suo padre

Lo prendeva come niente e lo sollevava su 
Era bello il panorama visto dall'alto 
Si gettava sulle cose prima del pensiero 
La sua mano era piccina ma afferrava il mondo intero 
Ora la città è un film straniero senza sottotitoli 
Le scale da salire sono scivoli, scivoli, scivoli 
Il ghiaccio sulle cose 
La tele dice che le strade son pericolose 
Ma l'unico pericolo che sento veramente 
È quello di non riuscire più a sentire niente 
Il profumo dei fiori l'odore della città 
Il suono dei motorini il sapore della pizza 
Le lacrime di una mamma le idee di uno studente 
Gli incroci possibili in una piazza 
Di stare con le antenne alzate verso il cielo

E allora ci si vede 
Ci si sente soli dalla parte del bersaglio 
E diventi un appestato quando fai uno sbaglio 
Un cartello di sei metri dice tutto è intorno a te 
Ma ti guardi intorno e invece non c'è niente 
Un mondo vecchio che sta insieme solo grazie a quelli che 
Hanno ancora il coraggio di innamorarsi 
E una musica che pompa sangue nelle vene 
E che fa venire voglia di svegliarsi e di alzarsi 
Smettere di lamentarsi 
Che l'unico pericolo che senti veramente 
È quello di non riuscire più a sentire niente 
Di non riuscire più a sentire niente

L'appetito la sete l'evoluzione in atto 
L'energia che si scatena in un contatto

Dentro a una giungla sopra a un tetto di Parigi 
Mentre ammiravo le tue ali di farfalla 
Abbiamo immaginato di essere felici 
Come due bimbi proprietari di una stella 

In una febbre tropicale al polo sud 
Sognai I miei vecchi sorridenti in riva al mare 
Mentre guardavano la mia barca andare via 
Benedicendo la mia rotta dentro al cuore

Perchè ogni giorno porta dentro un pò d'amore

E tutto quello che sappiamo non è vero 
Si perdono le origini nel buco del tempo 
Ma tutto si conserva nelle profondità 

Sia l'elefante che il topo non avranno scampo 
La legge della savana li governerà 
Non si può scegliere un sogno non si può scegliere 
Quando ti arriva ti arriva non c'è niente da fare 
Le previsioni del tempo si posson prevedere 
Ma un temporale che arriva non lo puoi fermare 
Si danza per invocare la fertilità 
Si danza prima del sesso o di un combattimento 
Si danza per riscaldarsi dal freddo che fa 
Si danza per imitare il lavoro del vento 

Quando non so dove sono io mi sento a casa 
Quando non so con chi sono mi sento in compagnia 
Quando c'è troppa virtù il cuore mi si intasa 
La cura è spesso nascosta dentro alla malattia 
C'è un temporale in arrivo 
C'è un temporale in arrivo senti l'elettricità 
C'è un temporale in arrivo sulla mia città 
Porta novità porta novità 
Quando tu hai fame nessuno può mangiare per te 
Quando io ho sete nessuno può bere al posto mio 

Anche gli automi hanno un cuore di alluminio puro 
Pronto per farci passare l'amore del futuro 
Abramo lascia la casa senza sapere niente 
Si mette in strada lasciando quel che sapeva già 
E il trapezista si gioca tutto continuamente 
Per pochi soldi ed per un brivido di libertà 
L'autista di scuolabus ha in mano la nazione 
Più di un ministro di un Papa o di un'autorità 
E c'è una terra di mezzo tra il torto e la ragione 
La maggior parte del mondo la puoi trovare là 

Lavori in corso ci dispiace per l'inconveniente 
Hanno scoperto una casa dell'antichità 
Due scheletri abbracciati qualche osso poco o niente 
Ma il loro bacio va avanti per l'eternità 
C'è un temporale in arrivo 
C'è un temporale in arrivo senti l'elettricità 
C'è un temporale in arrivo sulla mia città 
Porta novità porta novità 
L'antico impero cinese accolse Marco Polo 
Perchè era un giovane mercante di immaginazione 

Non servono grandi ali per spiccare il volo 
La vita è molto più vasta di una definizione 
E stanno tutti aspettando che succeda qualcosa 
Che tolga il velo di polvere dalla realtà 
E stanno tutti aspettando che arrivi la sposa 
Coi fiori in mano e una promessa di felicità 
Problemi di digestione ispirano romanzi 
Rivelazioni che nascono nell'acidità 
Un pò di bicarbonato dopo certi pranzi 

Si eviterebbe lo scontro delle civiltà 
Gli uccelli volano bassi e sfiorano l'asfalto 
E I cani stanno in silenzio con aria d'attesa 
La foto sulla parete mi segue con lo sguardo 
Nessun allarme per ora nessuna sorpresa 
C'è un temporale in arrivo 
C'è un temporale in arrivo senti l'elettricità 
C'è un temporale in arrivo sulla mia città 
Porta novità porta novità 
E l'invincibile non è quello che vince sempre 

Ma quello che anche se perde non è vinto mai 
L'intelligenza è nel corpo il sapere nel cuore 
Se pensi sempre ad un muro un muro troverai 
Mi son trovato memorie che non sono mie 
Ho un solo nome ma almeno cento identità 
E' naturale preferire le belle bugie 
Alla durezza di ghiaccio di certe verità 

Viviamo comodi dentro alle nostre virgolette 
Ma il mondo è molto più grande più grande di così 
Se uno ha imparato a contare fino a sette 
Vuol mica dire che l'otto non possa esserci 
Senti l'elettricità senti l'elettricità 
C'è un temporale in arrivo 
Porta novità porta novità",Temporale,2008

Derrière la maison, je me suis levée hein
Tu m'as dis tu le vois encore, t'as même insisté, j'ai dis ""oui je le vois encore""
Lundi, vers minuit, des jeunes de Frans ont pu filmer l'engin quelques instants au caméscope
Une énorme masse se déplaçant à 400-600 mètres d'altitude
D'après le responsable du centre d'étude OVNI France

Che è molto educativo
Gerundio, imperativo
Infinito, indicativo

E si usa per eventi che non sono reali
È relativo a ciò che è soggettivo
E a differenza di altri modi verbali
E adesso che lo sai anche tu

Que torna en un satélite a cada ser viviente
Me gustas por que eres, inteligente

Se ve muy claro en tus manos como las mueves
Y haces que hasta los sentimientos siempre me renueves
Tus caderas son los andes y tus pechos los volcanes
Me gusta tu buen gusto en la ropa con que sales
Que está muy por encima de la moda del momento
Una flor que así creció entre el asfalto y el cemento

Asómate a la ventana amore mío
Asómate a la ventana amore mío
Asómate a la ventana amore mío
Asómate a la ventana amore mío

Serenata rap, serenata metropolitana
Confía un poco en mí
Aquí estaré cada mañana
No debes creer las cosas que otros te digan de mí
Es que son muy envidiosos
Quizás porqué
Yo no te prometo historias de pasión como de guiones
De cine de romances solo falsas ilusiones
Yo te ofrezco la verdad, cuerpo, alma y un cerebro
Amor es solamente amor
Es solo solo eso

Asómate a la ventana amore mío
Asómate a la ventana amore mío
Asómate a la ventana amore mío
Asómate a la ventana amore mío

Amor que nadie ama se resigna a no lograrlo
Lo escribe en los muros
Y luego en el subterráneo de esta ciudad
Millones de habitantes que van día con día
Ignorándose hacia delante
Y después no sé porqué
Porqué, quién sabe cómo
Después no sé porqué
Porqué quien sabe cómo
Dos almas de repente se generan un destino
Palacios, ruido, smog son como un jardín divino
Personas entregadas intercambian un anillo
En un departamento que sera como un castillo
Asómate a la ventana amore mío

Tus caderas son los andes y tus pechos los volcanes
Me gusta tu buen gusto en la ropa con que sales
Que está muy por encima de la moda del momento

Affacciati al balcone
Rispondimi al citofono
Sono venuto qui
Col giradischi e col microfono
Insieme al mio complesso
Per cantarti il sentimento
E se tu mi vorrai baciare
Saro´ contento
E questa serenata
E´ la mia sfida col destino
Vorrei che per la vita
Noi due fossimo vicino
Una serenata rap
Per dirti che di te
Mi piaci come mi guardi
Mi piace come sei con me

Serenata metropolitana
Mettiti con me
Non saro´ un figlio di puttana
Non ci credere alle cose
Che ti dicono di me
Sono tutti un po´ invidiosi
Chissa´ perche´

Di passioni da copione
Di cinema romanzi
E che ne so di una canzone

Solo solo quello

Lorenzo Cherubini,"E te lo dico in faccia ciò che penso di te
Quello che penso di chi pensa solamente per sé
E pensa che col grano puoi comprare la gente
Cambiargli il pensiero ed annullare la mente
La mia generazione forse è senza ideali
Magari senza palle con gli istinti animali
Cresciuti a sentire i discorsi dei padri
Barricati dietro muri in questo mondo di ladri
E hanno come idoli denaro e padroni
E valutano l'uomo in base a ""quanti milioni""
Milioni di cazzate, miliardi di miliardi
E noi saremo scemi ma non siamo bugiardi
E te lo dico in faccia, non c'è problema
Perché sotto i miei piedi il pavimento trema
E non è un terremoto, non è un'epidemia
Neanche una bufera neanche una carestia


È una tribù che balla ohoh
È una tribù che balla oheo
È una tribù che balla oho
È una tribù che balla oheo

È una tribù che balla e cerca una ragione
Perché ci sia una terra e ci sia una nazione
Formata dai ragazzi e dalla gente
Di credo, di colore e di cultura differente
Perché è l'unica strada ed è l'unica certezza
Perché nei nostri cuori finisca l'amarezza

È una tribù che balla ohoh
È una tribù che balla oheo

È una tribù che balla ohoh
È una tribù che balla oheo

È una tribù che balla al ritmo di un tamburo
Che picchia nella mente a chi si sente sicuro
Rinchiuso in un castello fatto di pregiudizi
Confuso nel discernere la virtù dai vizi
La musica è uno sparo, impedisce di parlare
Ti obbliga a pensare a quello che dovrai dire
Nel momento in cui sul piatto finirà questa canzone
Sarai un uomo pronto per la rivoluzione
Senza nessuna bomba, ma con tanto rumore
La musica finisce, ma rimane l'amore

È una tribù che balla ohoh
È una tribù che balla oheo
È una tribù che balla oho
È una tribù che balla oheo

È una tribù che balla e la pace sia con voi
La carica ti scarica più forte che puoi
È l'energia del sole per quanto ce ne resta
Che muove le tue gambe e accende la tua testa
Riempi la riserva e vai a manetta
E quando il tuo sudore bagnerà la tua maglietta
Ricordati che tu sei unico al mondo
E non esiste primo e non esiste secondo
Esiste una tribù, esistono i fratelli
Che più sono diversi e più sono fratelli
Ognuno ha la sua storia e le sue tradizioni
Ognuno il suo colore e le sue religioni
Ma il battito del cuore è lo stesso per tutti
La musica, la musica fa muovere tutti
Ma il battito del cuore è per tutti lo stesso
La musica, la musica e il resto nel cesso

Lorenzo Conte,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Lorenzo Conte,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2005

You said you would always stay

You don't have to say you love me just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever I will understand
Believe me, believe me I can't help but love you
But believe me I'll never tie you down
Left alone with just a memory
Life seems dead and quite unreal
All that's left is loneliness there's nothing left to feel

You don't have to say you love me just be close at hand

Los secretos de su dormitorio
Esa noche canté
Al piano del amanecer todo mi repertorio
Los clientes del bar
Uno a uno se fueron marchando
Tú saliste a cerrar
Yo me dije

""Cuidado, chaval, te estas enamorando""
Luego todo pasó
De repente, su dedo en mi espalda
Dibujo un corazón
Y mi mano le correspondió debajo de tu falda
Caminito al hostal
Nos besamos en cada farola
Era un pueblo con mar

Yo quería dormir contigo y tú no querías dormir sola
Y nos dieron las diez y las once, las doce y la una
Y las dos y las tres
Y desnudos al amanecer nos encontró la luna
Nos dijimos adiós
Ojalá que volvamos a vernos
El verano acabó
El otoño duró lo que tarda en llegar el invierno

Y a tu pueblo el azar
Otra vez el verano siguiente
Me llevó, y al final
Del concierto me puse a buscar tu cara entre la gente
Y no halle quien de ti
Me dijera ni media palabra
Parecía como si
Me quisiera gastar el destino una broma macabra

No había nadie detrás
De la barra del otro verano
Y en lugar de tu bar
Me encontré una sucursal del banco hispano americano
Tu memoria vengué
A pedradas contra los cristales
""Se que no lo soñé""
Protestaba mientras me esposaban los municipales

En mi declaración
Alegué que llevaba tres copas
Y empecé esta canción
En el cuarto donde aquella vez te quitaba la ropa
Y nos dieron las diez y las once, las doce y la una
Y las dos y las tres
Y desnudos al amanecer nos encontró la luna",Y Nos Dieron Las Diez,2008
Lorenzo de Monteclaro,"Me voy en ese tren
Que va con rumbo al sur
Y quiero que esta noche
Tú me des mi despedida

Muy pronto volveré
Primeramente Dios
Deséame buena suerte
Pedacito de mi vida

Llegando a la estación
Del pueblo a donde voy
Te mando un telegrama
Pa' que sepas mi destino

También la dirección
Y calle donde este
Y así nos escribimos
Aunque sea cada Domingo

Jamás me vayas a olvidar
Así me tarde yo en volver
El día que vuelva por aquí
Si voy por otras tierras
También te llevare

Abrázate de mí
Y bésame otra vez
Para llevar recuerdos
En mi pecho bien grabados

Me marcho más feliz
Llevando tu calor
Y el dulce de tu boca
Saboreando entre mis labios
Jamás me vayas a olvidar
Así me

Gracias, gracias, gracias

Tra il sapore dei miei baci e del caffè
Noi distesi sopra un letto di parole

È un'estate da vivere

I ray-ban, la vodka e l'odore del mare
# fuori c'è il sole
Lo vuoi condividere?

Sulla sabbia a rincorrere un pallone
Come se la spiaggia fosse un privè
E le notti passate a fare cazzate
Un film dell'orrore e quattro risate
Non sai che fortuna passarle con te
Oh dimmi che
Un'estate da vivere

E forse torneremo, ad amarci

Siamo uguali in fondo
E forse cercherai, le mie mani
Solo per un giorno
Non scappare dai miei sguardi
Non possono inseguirti, non voltarti dai
E forse capirai, quanto vali
Potrei darti il mondo
Ma griderai, sul silenzio della pioggia
E' rancore e mal di testa, su una base un po' distorta
Ti dirò, siamo uguali come vedi
Perché senza piedistalli, non riusciamo a stare in piedi
Ed è già tardi e vuoi far piano
Il cuore è il tuo bagaglio a mano perché hai tutti i pregi che odio
E quei difetti che io amo
E schegge di una voce rotta, mi hanno ferito un'altra volta

A far l’amore senza amore
A far l’amore senza amore
Chi siamo noi per dirci addio

Infinite volte ho detto
Che non avrei più vissuto
Nessun altro amore che non sia tu
Altre mille volte ho perso
Questa guerra con me stesso
Ma non è bastato a non pensarti più

E adesso resta ancora un po
Ci sono cose da dimenticare
Da rivivere
Ma forse adesso sparirò
Per che anche scriverti è inutile
Stanotte il tuo silenzio dice cose stupide

Infinite volte ho detto
Che non avrei più vissuto
Nessun altro amore che non sia tu
Altre mille volte ho perso
Questa guerra con me stesso
Ma non è bastato a non pensarti più

I passi che hai fatto, l'amore che hai dato, la sete che hai spento e ricambia

Che da ogni ferita c'è luce che entra

Di fronte ai sempre o ai mai

Più forte che posso

E svegliarmi la mattina averti a fianco a me

Non senti come trema
E no, non ha paura di sbagliare

That September day?
Out in the yard with your wife and children
Or workin' on some stage in L.A.?
Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke
Risin' against that blue sky?
Did you shout out in anger, in fear for your neighbor,
Or did you just sit down and cry?

Did you weep for the children, they lost their dear loved ones,
Pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?
Did you burst out in pride for the red, white, and blue
And heroes who died just doin' what they do?
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
And look at yourself and what really matters?

I'm just a singer of simple songs.
I'm not a real political man.
I watch CNN, but I'm not sure I can tell you
The diff'rence in Iraq and Iran.
But I know Jesus and I talk to God,
And I remember this from when I was young:
Faith, hope, and love are some good things He gave us
And the greatest is love.

Where were you when the world stopped turnin'
That September day?
Teachin' a class full of innocent children
Or drivin' on some cold interstate?
Did you feel guilty 'cause you're a survivor?
In a crowded room did you feel alone?
Did you call up your mother and tell her you love her?
Did you dust off that Bible at home?

Did you open your eyes and hope it never happened,

Did you notice the sunset for the first time in ages
And speak to some stranger on the street?
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow,
Go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watchin'
And turn on """"I Love Lucy"""" reruns?
Did you go to a church and hold hands with some stranger,
Stand in line to give your own blood?
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your fam'ly,
Thank God you had somebody to love?

Loretta Goggi,"Mi solletica certo l'idea
Di sapere il tuo letto che cosa racconta
Ma perché quest’idea che mi stuzzica,
Pizzica, mi eccita tanto di te

Sorriso smagliante, perfetta criniera
Mi chiedo che tattica scegli stasera
Con una che ha l'aria un po' fredda, un po' dura
Non crederci non e' paura

Tu che sai piacere un po' a tutti e a nessuno
Chissà se davvero ti senti qualcuno
Per essere buono sei troppo gentile
Mi sento infantile però

Mi solletica il cuore l'idea di passare una notte con te
A svegliare le strade, a frustare De Sade, a parlare di te
E' al mattino dividere il pane croccante, biscotti e caffè
Seduttore di ghiaccio ti abbraccio ma forse non faccio per te

Vedi essendo un poco miope ti vedo così blù
Che mi piaci suppergiù, per cui
Mi solletica certo l'idea di sapere il tuo letto che cosa racconta
Ma mi solletica il cuore l'idea
Di lasciarci una lunga e indelebile impronta

Ma certo tesoro, scherzavo un pochino
Se ho detto stanotte che voglio un bambino
Se avessi I miei muscoli ed il tuo cervello
Non credo verrebbe un modello

Ma no, è troppo facile prenderti in giro
In fondo è soltanto al tuo cuore che miro
Per dirla sul serio, per dirtela tutta
Mi sento un po' matta però

Mi solletica il cuore l'idea di passare una vita con te
A tentare altre strade a bruciare De Sade, a cambiare con te
E al mattino dividere un bacio leggero che sa di caffè
Seduttore di ghiaccio ti abbraccio però non lo faccio perché

C'è che al buio anche miope io non ti vedo più
E mi piaci a tu per tu per cui

Mi solletica certo l'idea di un amore che resta un amore che conta
Ma mi solletica I sensi l'idea di una notte di quelle che un uomo racconta

C'è che al buio anche miope con te ci vedo blu
E mi piaci sempre più per cui
Mi solletica sempre l'idea di lasciarti se non è un amore che conta
Ma mi solletica il cuore l'idea di tornare da te quando il sole tramonta

Ma chissà se l'idea che mi stuzzica,
Pizzica ed eccita un poco anche te",Mi solletica l'idea,2005

my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

Loretta Holloway,"I learned the truth at seventeen
That love was meant for beauty queens
And high school girls with clear skinned smiles
Who married young and then retired
The valentines I never knew
The Friday night charades of youth
Were spent on one more beautiful
At seventeen I learned the truth

And those of us with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social graces
Desperately remained at home
Inventing lovers on the phone
Who called to say - come dance with me
And murmured vague obscenities
It isn't all it seems at seventeen

A brown eyed girl in hand me downs
Whose name I never could pronounce
Said - pity please the ones who serve
They only get what they deserve
The rich relationed hometown queen
Marries into what she needs
With a guarantee of company
And haven for the elderly

So remember those who win the game
Lose the love they sought to gain
In debentures of quality and dubious integrity
Their small-town eyes will gape at you
In dull surprise when payment due
Exceeds accounts received at seventeen

To those of us who knew the pain
Of valentines that never came
And those whose names were never called
When choosing sides for basketball
It was long ago and far away
The world was younger than today
When dreams were all they gave for free
To ugly duckling girls like me

We all play the game, and when we dare
We cheat ourselves at solitaire
Inventing lovers on the phone
Repenting other lives unknown
That call and say - come on, dance with me
And murmur vague obscenities
At ugly girls like me, at seventeen",At Seventeen,1996

People and places as we'd like them to be. But you know what truth is?

This morning, the same one you're going to make love with tonight.

Going to find out who is naughty and who is nice

Your town and my town

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you are wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I am telling you why

Believe me I'm ready for him

Those four letters spelled his name

But the next part of the story
Is the part Elmo likes best
What happened next is Elmo put his writing to the test

Yes, Elmo took that writing 
And he put it to the test

Would the word that Elmo written
Work for anyone who read
Would each and every reader know what Elmo's writing said?

Yes! Elmo

And now Elmo has the answer
And now Elmo feels so proud
For each and every reader
Read Elmo's name out loud

Yes, all who've tried have read it
They read it right out loud
They read, Elmo, Elmo, Elmo

And Elmo feels so proud

When we first fell in love the sun shined bright above
And everything we ever did was right
Love was all we ever knew clouds above were always blue
And all the time we never had a fight
But time together made a change the love we have is not the same
It seems that we keep goin' round and round
We try so hard to build our love and make it just the way it was
But everytime we build it up it all falls down
Yes it falls down our love gets halfway to heaven then falls to the ground
Yes it falls down it's so hard to make love strong

And everytime we build it up it all falls down

Chasin' pretty butterflies in the lane
The world's a mess and they wonder why
Oh, what a pretty blue, blue sky
Gee, ain't it funny, now, ain't it funny?

The kids all say grown ups are strange and aren't they?
They teach their kids not to do as I do but as I say

While you had all your fun
And every year that's gone by
Another babys come
There's a gonna be some changes made
Right here on nursery hill
You've set this chicken your last time
'Cause now I've got the pill

This old maternity dress I've got
Is goin' in the garbage
The clothes I'm wearin' from now on
Won't take up so much yardage
Miniskirts, hot pants and a few little fancy frills
Yeah I'm makin' up for all those years
Since I've got the pill

I'm tired of all your crowin'
How you and your hens play
While holdin' a couple in my arms
Another's on the way
This chicken's done tore up her nest
And I'm ready to make a deal
And ya can't afford to turn it down
'Cause you know I've got the pill

This incubator is overused
Because you've kept it filled
The feelin' good comes easy now
Since I've got the pill

In a cabin, on a hill in Butcher Holler.
We were poor but we had love, 
That's the one thing that daddy made sure of,
He shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar.

My daddy worked all night in the Van Lear coal mines.
All day long in the field a hoin' corn.
Mommy rocked the babies at night,
And read the Bible by the coal oil light,
And ever' thing would start all over come break of morn.

Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay.
Mommy scrubbed our clothes on a washboard ever' day.  
Why I've seen her fingers bleed, 
To complain, there was no need,
She'd smile in mommy's understanding way.

In the summertime we didn't have shoes to wear.
But in the wintertime we'd all get a brand new pair.
From a mail order catalog
Money made from selling a hog,
Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere.

Yeah, I'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter,
I remember well, the well where I drew water.
The work we done was hard,
At night we'd sleep 'cause we were tired
I never thought of ever leaving Butcher Holler.

As you said in the words of your song
Too many times married men 
Think they're still single
That has caused many a good girl to go wrong

It's a shame that all the blame is on us women
It's not true that only you men feel the same
From the start 
Most every heart that's ever broken
Was because there always was a man to blame

They bound the hands of Jesus in the garden where he pray
They led him through the street in shame
They spat upon the Saviour so pure and free from sin
They said crucify him he's to blame
He could have called ten thousand angels to destroy the world and set him free
He could have called ten thousand angels but he died alone for you and me

They laughed and said behold the king
They struck him and they cursed him and mocked his holy name
And all alone he suffered everything
He could have caught",Ten Thousand Angels,1990
Loretta Lynn,"In our little one room country school it's where I learned to pray
A church without a steeple that's where I learned to pray
Every Sunday morning about the hour of ten
The door would open to our school the preacher did walk in
He'd smile and say good morning how everything today
We'd bow our heads and close our eyes and then he'd say let's pray
In our little one room country school it's where I learned to pray
Our church that had no steeple is no longer there today
From Monday until Friday at school we'd learn and play
Then back at school on Sunday that's where I learned to pray

Our clothes were clean but faded sometimes our feet were bare
But no one noticed anything except the Lord was there
We'd come from all directions searching for the way
Harmonizes at school on Sunday that's where I learned to pray

In a cabin, on a hill in Butcher Holler
We were poor but we had love
That's the one thing that daddy made sure of
He shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar

My daddy worked all night in the Van Lear coal mines
All day long in the field a hoin' corn
Mommy rocked the babies at night
And read the Bible by the coal oil light
And ever' thing would start all over come break of morn

Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay
Mommy scrubbed our clothes on a washboard ever' day
Why I've seen her fingers bleed
To complain, there was no need
She'd smile in mommy's understanding way

In the summertime we didn't have shoes to wear
But in the wintertime we'd all get a brand new pair
From a mail order catalog
Money made from selling a hog
Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere

Yeah, I'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter
I remember well, the well where I drew water
The work we done was hard
At night we'd sleep 'cause we were tired
I never thought of ever leaving Butcher Holler

And was playing soft

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
[Chorus]
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town",Santa Claus Is Coming to Town,1995
Loretta Lynn,"Silver bells silver bells it's Christmas time in the city
Ring a ling hear them ring soon it will be Christmas Day
City sidewalks busy sidewalks dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas

Children laughing people passing meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you hear
Silver bells silver bells...

(Silver bells) silver bells (silver bells)
Silver bells soon it will be Christmas Day",Silver Bells,1995
Loretta Lynn,"On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross the emblem of suffering and shame
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross and exchange it some day for a crown
[ piano ]
Oh that old rugged cross so despised by the world is a wonderous attraction for me
For the dear lamb of God left this glory above to bare it to dark calvary
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross...",The Old Rugged Cross,1995
Loretta Lynn,"You think you're smart
You broke my heart
Left me to cry here alone but you'll return
One day you'll learn
The heart you break may be your own

You promised me
Your love would be
A kind I'd never known tho' you weren't fair
You're unaware
The heart you break maybe your own

You used my heart for a plaything
You'll be sorry, just wait and see
One day you'll find you are lonely
And the first one you'll think of is me

You'll look around
And when you've found
That you are all alone then you'll get wise
And realize
The heart you break may be your own

You used my heart for a plaything
You'll be sorry, just wait and see
One day you'll find you are lonely
And the first one you'll think of is me

You'll look around
And when you've found
That you are all alone then you'll get wise
And realize
The heart you break may be your own
",May God Bless America Again,1995
Loretta Lynn,"You left me for the bright lights of the town
A country boy set out to see the world
Remember when those city lights shine down
That big old moon shines on your Kentucky girl

I swear I love you by the moon above you
How bright is it shinin' in your world
Some mornings when you wake up all alone
Just come on home to your blue Kentucky girl

Don't wait to bring great riches home to me
I need no diamond rings or fancy pearls
Just bring yourself you're all I'll ever need
That's good enough for this blue Kentucky girl

I swear I love you by the moon above you
How bright is it shinin' in your world
Some mornings when you wake up all alone
Just come on home to your blue Kentucky girl",Blue Kentucky Girl,1995
Loretta Lynn,"I told you that I'd never come around again but here I am again here I am again
I said I'd never let you get me down again here I am again here I am
Here I am here we are the story's gettin' old
I know I can't go on to you but worse than bad I can't let go

I said words I swore I'd never speak but again here I am again here I am again
I thought I could stay strong but I got weak again and here I am again here I am
Here I am here we are...
And oh the nights're cold and I could use a friend so here I am again here I am again




",Here I Am Again,1996
Loretta Lynn,"You've come to tell me something you say I ought to know
That he don't love me anymore and I'll have to let him go
You say you're gonna take him oh but I don't think you can
'Cause you ain't woman enough to take my man

Women like you they're a dime a dozen you can buy 'em anywhere
For you to get to him I'd have to move over
And I'm gonna stand right here
It'll be over my dead body so get out while you can
'Cause you ain't woman enough to take my man

Sometimes a man start lookin' at things that he don't need
He took a second look at you but he's in love with me
Well I don't know where they leave you oh but I know where I'll stand
And you ain't woman enough to take my man

Women like you they're a dime a dozen you can buy 'em anywhere
For you to get to him I'd have to move over
And I'm gonna stand right here
It'll be over my dead body so get out while you can
'Cause you ain't woman enough to take my man
No, you ain't woman enough to take my man",You Ain't Woman Enough (To Take My Man) [*],1996
Loretta Lynn,"Amazing grace!
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost, but now am found,
Was blind, but now I see.

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved.
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed.

Through many dangers, toils and snares I have already come;
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home.

The Lord has promised good to me
His word my hope secures;
He will my shield and portion be,
As long as life endures.

Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail, and mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess within the veil,
A life of joy and peace.

When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun,
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we've first begun",Amazing Grace,1998
