Josie & the Pussycats,"Well he looks at me with those Innocent eyes,
And says it looks like we're wearing some kind of disguise,
Because your hair sticks up and your shoes are untied,
And I hope you got that shirt at half price,
And every word I say falls flat on the floor,
I try to tell a joke but he's heard it before,
And I don't think I can take it no more,
Cause he's driving me right out of my front door,

Why do you do what you do to me baby,
You're shaking my confidence you're driving me crazy,
You know if I could I'd do anything for you,
Please don't ignore me cause you know I adore you,

Can't you just pretend to be nice,
Can you at least pretend to be nice,
If you could just pretend to be nice,
Everything in my life would be alright,

Oooh wee....
Oooh wee....

And I try so hard just to figure him out,
But he won't tell me what he's thinking about,
And then he falls asleep on the living room couch,
With his sunglasses on and his tongue hanging out,
And then he disappears for a week at a time,
And then he just shows up just like everything's fine,
And I don't get what goes on in his mind,
But I'm tired of hearing the same stupid line,

Why do you do what you do to me baby,
You're shaking my confidence making me crazy,
You know if I could I'd do anything for you,
I don't mean to bore you cause you know I adore you,

But can't you just pretend to be nice,
Can you at least pretend to be nice,
If you could just pretend to be nice,
Everything in my life would be alright,

 That saved a wretch like me. 
 I once was lost but now I'm found, 
 Was blind but now I see.

 And grace my fear relieved 
 How precious did that grace appear, 
 The hour I first believed.

 We have already come 
 T'was grace that brought us safe thus far

Because I'm easy come, easy go
A little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth

Et, pour la bouche gourmande

Le beau, le joli métier!

Un écureuil en jupon
Dans un bond
Vint me dire ""Je suis gourmande
Et mes lèvres sentent bon
Et, si tu me donnes une amande
Je te donne un baiser fripon!""

""Grimpe aussi haut que tu veux
Que tu peux et tu croques, et tu picores
Puis tu grignotes, et puis tu
Redescends plus vite encore
Me donner le baiser dû!""

Tout mangé

A pleine bouche quand les
Nigauds seront pourvus d'ailes
Et que tu sauras voler!""

Mais dis-toi que, si tu tombes
Je n'aurais pas la larme à l'œil
Dis-toi que, si tu succombes
Je ne porterai pas le deuil!""

Joss Stone,"What's it all about, Alfie?
Is it just for the moment we live?
What's it all about when you sort it out, Alfie?
Are we meant to take more than we give
Or are we meant to be kind?
And if only fools are kind, Alfie,
Then I guess it's wise to be cruel.
And if life belongs only to the strong, Alfie,
What will you lend on an old golden rule?
As sure as I believe there's a heaven above, Alfie,
I know there's something much more,
Something even non-believers can believe in.
I believe in love, Alfie.
Without true love we just exist, Alfie.
Until you find the love you've missed you're nothing, Alfie.
When you walk let your heart lead the way
And you'll find love any day, Alfie, Alfie",Alfie,2004

You lost me
You're wasted

I don't want you here messing with my mind

Spitting in my eyes and I still see
Tried to keep me down
I'm breaking free
I don't want no part in your next fix
Someone needs to tell you this is it

Hey listen you'll be missin'
Out on all my love and my kissing
Make your mistakes on your own time
When you come down you're just no good to have around
Instead of making money you took mine

You had me
You lost me
You're wasted
You cost me
I don't want you here messing with my mind
I've realized in time
That my eyes are not blind
I've seen it before
I'm taking back my life

You tried to trade on my naivete
But the things you do and say embarrass me
See once upon a time I was your fool
But the one I leave behind is you

Hey listen you'll be missin'
Out on all my love and my kissing
Make your mistakes on your own time
When you come down you're just no good to have around
Instead of making money you took mine

You're sniffing on snow when you're feeling low

But it didn't take long for me to see the light
You swore you had control of it
But when I stepped back you slipped on your supply

Taking it back I'm taking it back
Taking back my life

Reminiscing bout you and me
Thinking how it used to be
It's plain and clear I treated you bad
But girl you know that I care
Every relation have wear and tear
Just draw near girl and try to hear and listen what my heart says

Many days and many nights
Many heartbreaks, many fights
Many wrongs but so many rights
So girl don't let this love die
Never meant to cause you no pain,
Girl I never meant to treat you lame.
Gimme one more chance rewind come back again.
Don't let this love die.

Just cry baby cry (Don't cry no more)
'Cause every tear that flows falls into the ocean
And rises to the sky
And then the rain will come
Right before the sun shines

Can you feel me reaching out to you girl, can you hear my open thoughts
Never want disrespect you girl don't let this come break us apart.
'Cause I know I would die without you, my girl can you hear my broken heart.
It's calling out to the good times that we had back at the start.

Baby (Don't call me baby)
You know I need you in my life daily (You know you played me)
I was a player but now your love changed me (Dead wrong)
I'm going crazy (I'm gone)
Never thought losing you would be so hard

It's your turn to cry baby cry (Don't cry no more)
'Cause every tear that flows falls into the ocean
And rises to the sky
And then the rain will come
Right before the sun shines

So let go
And move on
What we were
Is now undone
My tears have all dried

You're losing your love and your trust for me girl
And you know, I would go to the ends of the world.
If you wanted, just like we started.
Girl 'cause I don't want to fight no more.

Sitting here waiting for your voice on the phone 
Fever turns to cold cold sweat 
Thinking about things we ain't done yet 
Tell me now 
I've gotta know, do you feel the same 
Do you just light up at the mention of my name

Don't worry baby 
Ain't nothin' new

If your whole world is shakin' 
And you feel like I do 
That's just love sneakin' up on you 

Nowhere on earth for your heart to hide 
Once love comes sneaking up on your blind side 
And you might as well try and stop the rain 
Or stand in the track of a runaway train

Spread it thick and lay the biggest lies

[Yas] Wait, no you wouldn't.-
[Bobby] Don't Listen to him, he only cares about himself.-
[Yas] alright -
[Bobby] See I would be there through thick and thin,
in sickness and in health, from beginning to end.
You gotta decide, me or him, Erica, tell me I'm curious.
[Yas] Bobby, I didn't mean to cut you off but are you really being serious?
You sound delirious, I can't believe I'm hearing this,
Erica's my girl, she always has been, period.
She hates you, what makes you think she would date you?
You got a new girl, like every week, at least I'm faithful.
[Bobby] Erica, take my advice, like how long have you known me?
I know Yas, he's the kind that'd leave you stranded and lonely.
Why are you lying to me?
So don't come crying to me.

### just me,
and all I want is a chance,
but you can't make up your mind.

never knowing who was mine.
Now I hear your heart is broken.

I ain't afraid of commitment, but Yas is,
trust me, he'd be gone in an instant.
[Yas] Bobby's obsessive, he sleeps next to your pictures.
Now, let me go get Justin to cry you one more river.
- Cry me a river.
### big on pleasing but he acts like he mastered it.
I heard two minutes and he's sexually inadequate.
[Bobby] Okay, Yas, he's a loser, and I don't see the attraction,
all those pickup lines he uses, he read 'em in the last Maxim.
And ask him about how he likes to flirt with strangers.
He'd drop you in a second to watch the Indiana Pacers.
[Yas] Bobby, come on, you and Erica are dead wrong,
you'd have better luck hooking up with Stifler's Mom.
[Bobby] Listen, Erica's my soulmate, my fate, my world,
so get that through your head and go chase some other girl.
[Yas] Now Erica's my dream, my Billie Jean, my life.
Now is it him or is it me? You shouldn't have to think twice.

I was happy at the time,
never knowing who was mine.
Now I hear your heart is broken.

[Yas] Yo, you need to - pay me a listen, and -uh- follow my vision,
and -uh- stop playing mind games and make a decision.
[Bobby] Listen up, Erica, this whole charade feels senseless.
Never knew a girl could come between friendships.

I never meant for this to grow so far,
I'm waiting to find out who you are.

Joss Stone,"I've been running around, and
I gotta slow down and spend time with my man
From city to city
Pleasing the world but neglecting him
Living on the road is so damn tough
Talking on the phone is never enough
I gotta get back to the place that I'm used to

[Chorus:]
And I
Felt like I need to be in the arms of my baby
And I
Gotta find my way back to my baby now

I've been lacking affection
Craving for the touch of his gentle hands
So much love and devotion
No matter what I go through, he understands
He sends me flowers, but they don't compare
To how he runs his fingers through my head
I gotta get back to the place that I'm used to

Feel like I need my baby

Oh, I, I'm the kind that needs to be in the arms of my baby

(Oh, I, I gotta find my way back to the arms of my baby, now)

Baby, can't you see?
Baby, baby, baby
Tell me, do you love me now?

I can't wait to see your face everyday
I can't explain the way I feel when I'm around you
There's a space in my heart that belongs to only you

Do you understand what I'm saying?
Do you understand me?
Got a thing for you, and I'm not playing
It's something I need to know

I can't imagine how my life would be without you
I don't know if I'd survive another day
No pressure, but I'd love to keep you safely
Promise me it's real
And that you would never fake it

You're my bad habit; no, somehow I don't wanna be rid of you
(But it's no use; you know there's no use)

It's obvious to me; your kiss is lethal
Your drug of choice is love, and I can't come down

You could be everyone, but I still want you bad (want you bad)
Some say it's sad (say it's sad)

Always got someone out lookin' for you
And sometimes I just wanna knock you out
You'd say I'd lost half of my brain
Clinically I'm insane
'Cause I fiend for you bad (for you bad)
You're the best I ever had (ever had)

You do me so wrong
But you love me so right
There's more than one reason
Why you shouldn't be in me life
To tell you I don't want you no more would be a lie
I gotta step back and accept the fact that
You're my, you're my bad habit

Joss Stone,"You see I know change
I see is change 
I embody change
All we do is change
Yea, I know change
We're born to change
We sometimes regard it as a metaphor
That reflects the way we want things to be
In fact, change takes time
It exceeds all expectations
It requires both now and then
See, although the players change,
The song remains the same
And the truth is,
You gotta have the balls to change

Higher vibration
Energizing entire lands with

Harmony, melodies, even riffs can be
Disguised human essence
Sonically bottled ecstasy
Or melancholy
Agony blues angst
Exercising anxieties
Fueling entire societies
Making economies
Stimulating, generating
Inspiration synonymously
Entertaining expression
Intangible, invisible, but undeniable
Plays the language of excitement on survival
Some call it tribal
But perspective is everything
Connected to everything
Some say collectively everything

Is it just for the moment we live?
What's it all about when you sort it out, Alfie?
Are we meant to take more than we give
Or are we meant to be kind?
And if only fools are kind, Alfie,
Then I guess it's wise to be cruel.
And if life belongs only to the strong, Alfie,
What will you lend on an old golden rule?
As sure as I believe there's a heaven above, Alfie,
I know there's something much more,
Something even non-believers can believe in.
I believe in love, Alfie.
Without true love we just exist, Alfie.

And the world was bruised?

See, everybody's taking care of themselves
Not looking out of the widest window
Somehow everybody's taking care of themselves

We're stomping our love

Everybody walk hand in hand
Get hold of your leg, push together, yeah 
Now everybody get over, hey!
You turned up too late that trick's over

What happened to this morning when we woke up hung over?
Like it's only forever
What happened to that day when the people walked hand in hand
Together, man

What happened to this morning?

Joss Stone,"I suddenly noticed the body of a parson lying on the ground in a ruined churchyard
I felt unable to leave him to the mercy of the red weed, and decided to bury him, decently

Nathaniel! Nathaniel!

The parson's eyes flickered open
He was alive!

Nathaniel, I saw the church burst into flame, are you all right?

Don't touch me!

But it's me, Beth! Your wife!

No! You're one of them - a devil!

He's delirious!

Lies! I saw the devil's sign!

What are you saying?

The green flash in the sky
His demons were here all along, in our hearts and souls
Just waiting for a sign from Him
And now they're destroying our world!

But they're not devils, they're Martians

We must leave here!

Look, a house still standing, come Nathaniel, quickly

We took shelter in a cottage, and black smoke spread, hemming us in
Then a fighting machine came across the field
Spraying jets of steam that turned the smoke into thick, black dust

Ulla!

Dear God, help us!

The voice of the Devil is heard in our land!

Listen, do you hear them drawing near
In their search for the sinners?
Feeding on the power of our fear
And the evil within us?
Incarnation of Satan's creation of all that we dread
When the demons arrive those alive would be better off dead!

There must be something worth living for
There must be something worth trying for
Even some things worth dying for!
And if one man can stand tall
There must be hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

Once there was a time when I believed
Without hesitation
That the power of love and truth could conquer all
In the name of salvation
Tell me what kind of weapon is love when it comes to the fight?
And just how much protection is truth against all Satan's might?

There must be something worth living for
There must be something worth trying for
Even some things worth dying for
And if one man can stand tall
There must be some hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

People loved you, and trusted you, came to you for help

Didn't I warn them this would happen?
Be on your guard, I said, for the Evil One never rests
I said exorcise the devil!
But no, they wouldn't listen, the demons inside them grew and grew
Until Satan gave his signal and destroyed the world we knew!

No Nathaniel, oh no, Nathaniel
No Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the love we used to know
(No) Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the light that we have lost

Now darkness has descended on our land
And all your prayers cannot save us
Like fools we've let the devil take command
Of the souls that God gave us
To the altar of evil like lambs to the slaughter were led
When the demons arrive the survivors will envy the dead!

There must be something worth living for
(No, there is nothing!)
There must be something worth trying for
(I don't believe it's so!)
Even some things worth dying for
If just one man could stand tall
There would be some hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

Forget about goodness and mercy, they're gone!

Didn't I warn them? Pray, I said! Destroy the devil, I said!
They wouldn't listen! I could have saved the world!
But now it's too late, too late!

No Nathaniel, oh no, Nathaniel
No Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the love we used to know
(No) Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the light that we have lost

Dear God!
A cylinder's landed on the house
And we are underneath it, in the pit!

The Martians spent the night making a new machine
It was a squat, metallic spider with huge, articulated claws
But it, too, had a hood in which a Martian sat
I watched it pursuing some people across a field
It caught them nimbly and tossed them into a great metal basket upon its back

Beth! She's dead! Buried under the rubble Why?
Satan! Why did you take one of your own?

There is a curse on Mankind
We may as well be resigned
To let the devil, the devil take the spirit of man

As time passed in our dark and dusty prison
The Parson wrestled endlessly with his doubts
His outcries invited death for us both - and yet, I pitied him",The Spirit of Man,2012

Why we wasting our time
To me you're nothing at all

Please don't think I'll forget ya
Nothing in the world could move
All the scars you gave me
Memories I just can't lose
If I had a chance to show ya
How it feels you know I would do
My best to test just how
Heartless you really are
To me you're nothing at all
To me you're nothing at all
At all, all 

Baby can't you hear this sound
All the arguments are screaming out
This ain't love that we've found at all, at all
Baby won't you realize
You know that I'm not your prize
Why we wasting our time
To me you're nothing at all
To me you're nothing at all

Why don't ya, why don't ya
Leave me
Go get out
Turn around
'Cause I got a mouth that'll knock you down
And when it's over you won't know what hit you
'Cause you'll be looking up at me from the ground

Won't you take the time to lay it all out on the table and figure this out
Reality is staring us right in the face
I'm in a place I can't seem to turn around
Something's gotta give
We can start to live without having to shout so loud
Relationship's a trip with a lack of light
It's the time we need to get out

Get out 
Get out 
We need to get out

Baby can't you hear this sound
All the arguments are screaming out
This ain't love
This ain't love
This ain't love

Baby won't you realize
You know that I'm not your prize
Why we wasting our time
To me you're nothing at all

And this ain't love
This ain't love that we've found

See, I know love don't look like this
And I know love don't taste
Nothing like this, nothing at all
'Cause I've had enough
I've had enough of your lack of love
I've had enough of this bad taste
Had enough of you wasting my time
To me you're nothing at all

Let your eyes be your mind and lady
This is a room where your people can fake it
So boy let your hair fall down
The world's overpopulating
You can feel free, it's love we're making
You'd be a fool to refuse to take it

Like the sun shinin' through the rain
Sounds never complicated
Just don't think too tough, that's enough
To the echo of a smile that saved me
Walk the shortest of miles to crazy
Left a note that you won't lay me
Down, so you cease good now

I can imagine it'd be much more than
A turn of the tables so you can be able
To feel the heat of the every beat
Let go, let go, leave those cufflinks on the street
It's an itch you got to scratch, yeah burn your mail, mail
???
No hot, you got to match, you can stay or you can bail
I hold a lighter, hope you cash, hope you dash
We dim the brightness, you relax, you relax
I wanna see what you look like when you leave but will you leave?
Will you feel lovely as you smoke the breeze?
Boy to nature by the trees

Jossie Esteban,"Era una noche extrana tambien silenciosa
La nieve caia se veia hermosa
Quien diria que yo tambien pienso en hermosura
why que creo en el amor why eso si es preciosura
Estaba yo hablando sin saber
Que me podia pasar con esta mujer
Era tan bella que ni tan siguiera parecia humana
Hable con ella hasta por la manana, why
Desde ese dia me puse a pensar
why una planta de amor queria cosechar
Pa que creciera, subiera why tocara el sielo
Estar con ella es todo lo que anhelo, pero
Tenia miedo cometer un error
Tenia miedo, de estar jugando con el amor
Porque el amor es una objecto con que nunca se juega
why a la misma vez tampoco se niega 
Algo yo tenia que hacer, man!
Pero nada podia conseguir
Pero una noche por telefono me llamo
why con su voz agradable me confeso
Que me queria, que era mucho amor lo que sentia
Que me necesitaba por la noche why por el dia
De amor es lo que hablo why eso fue lo que ohiste
Asi que escuchame, porque el amor existe

Asi que escuchame, porque el amor existe

Estaba confundido no podia hablar
why el telefono lo tuve que enganchar
Todo el cuerpo me tenblaba estaba lleno de sudor
why antes, que yo no creia en el amor
Pero ahora si
Hay muchas cosas que precientos
Que estaran jugando con mis sentimientos
Si hay tantas cosasa por descubrir
Hay tantas cosas que se tienen que construir
Completamente, la cosa seria se exterminan
why mas cunado dos deres humanos se combinan
why, formar una familia que mantener
Encarinar amar why compadecer
Todas esas cosas en la cabeza ya se me habia metido
Esa mujer me habia convencido
why te lo juro Dios fue el unico testigo
De lo que estaba pasando con migo why
Todavia no sabia que hacer
Porque el amor es un problema sin resolver
why si tu trata de arrancarlo de tu corrazan
Es como si quisiera escapar de una prision
Es sufrimiento, pero tambien es ternura
why tu conciensa se siente segura 
De que hay una persona que te quiere sin chiste
Asi que creeme, porque el amor existe

Asi que creeme, porque el amor existe

Me llamo una vez dos veces why mas
Estaba tan confundido que no era capaz
De contestar el telefono why hablar con ella
De vino me tome como cuatro botellas
Me puse a pensar, planear, meditar
Como es que todo lo hiba a solucionar
Pero pense why me invente una buena idea
why te la voy a contar pa que tu me creas
Escribi una carta que decia asi:
Para Siomara con carino de Vico-see
Rapidamente en el buson la introduci
why asi decia, la carta que yo construi:
Hola, ?como estas? yo me siento bien
why espero que te sientas como yo tambien
Asi felices seremos de noche why de dia
why preparate para que leas esta poesia
Yo soy el mar why tu eres el pez
Yo te ofresco la vida why el amor a la vez
why donde quiera que tu nada siempre estas en mi
Con las olas que yo hago te persigo a ti
Yo te beso, te abraso, tambien te acaricio
Mi amor por ti es como si fuera un vicio
Un vicio que lo siento en el corazon
why lo mantengo besandote con mucha pasion
Porque yo soy el arbol why tu eres el fruto
Tu no te alejas de mi ni tan siquiera un minuto
Si te caes, en me tu vuelves a crecer
why nuestro amor jamas ni nunca lo podran vencer
La gente dice que yo siempre te amo en exeso
Yo digo, que todavia estoy en proceso
Te sobo la espalda, te abraso why te beso
why entre aguas why las plantas why amarte why empiezo
Tu acaricias el rabo en mi cabello
Me quitas la camisa, me besas el cuello
Hacemos el amor, pero sin protestar
Sin comentario why sin nadie que nos pueda parar
Yo pongo musica suave
why es indudable, al bailar con tigo es bien amable
Sentirte en mis brazos why en mi pecho tambien 
Tu eres la mercancia yo soy el almacen
Trabajando, viviendo, gozando, unidos
why de vez en cuando mas que atrevidos
Hay muchas gentes que me quiere felicitar
Por tu promesa que me amas why me quiere vesar
Siempre te veo, why siento una gran emocion
Por eso quiero que hoigas esta cancion
Que el amor es embuste fue lo que tu digiste
Estas esquivocada, porque el amor existe

Porque el amor existe
Porque el amor existe

Donde quiera que estes
Piensa why este segura
Que yo te amo
why solamente por lo que dice esta cancion

Jossie Esteban,"He aqui mi presencia
Pues he prometido que venia a verte aunque estubiera fligido
Cogiste el camino de la separacion
why tu no sabes como eso afecta mi corazon
Dios mio ayudame, why nunca permita
Que mi alma se destroce con esta visita
Mi mujer no me escucha, estando ahi acostada
No me mira no me abraza no me dice nada
Culpa tengo yo por no cumplir con mis promesas
Haciendote pasar muchos dias de tristeza
Por que no me di cuenta que yo actuaba muy mal
Ahora el remordimiento me quiere matar
Hombre al fin donde quiera que me paro
Las lenguas me persiguen cuando formo mi relajo
why asi sucesivamente pude perder
La gente habla sin parar sin tan siquiera saber
Pero ya es tarde
Ya escogiste tu decision, me abandonaste why asi cumpliste con tu mision
Pero yo lucho para que unque sea pueda sentir
why se muy bien que es imposible pero voy a seguir
Mi sentimientos hoy, se inclinan a tu vida
Manana buscare un camino a la salida, pues
Esto me encierra en un circulo vicioso 
Que me aparta de lo que pudo ser tan hermoso

Coro (2X):
Me acuerdo cuando te entregaste a mi
Me acuerdo como me aferraba yo a ti
Me acuerdo los dos sonando en una noche de pasion
No me escuchas, no me miras, se remuelde mi corazon

Te noto bien palida 
No eres la misma
Te falta la sonrisa que dibuja tu carisma
Te siento muy fria tus labios resecos
Hinutil te ves, why sin faltarte al respecto pero
Eso no importa te amo como eres
why nunca sentire lo mismo con otras mujeres
Dios me creo para quererte a ti
Yo maldigo el momento en que te perdi
why esta perdida es indudablemente eterna
Quisiera inventarme una luz moderna
Que alumbrara el camino de la felicidad
Porque sinseramente no acepto la realidad
Un ser humano no es capaz de aguantar este peso
Yo sufro me remueldo why lloro en exeso
Si crees que exagero pues lo hago por ti
Porque demuestro lo que tu significas para mi

Coro (2X)

Me acuerdo de la brisa que nos acarisiaba
Pues el viento a nuestra relacion apreciaba
Tu pecho junto al mio el calor provocaba
why asi por el estilo nuesras almas se entregaban
Me acuerdo de la noche en que tu me conocistes
Todas las caricias agradables que me hicistes
Me acuerdo de todas las palabras que digistes
Diciendome en secreto que el amor si existe
Pero con el tiempo el libreto cambio
Pues la malicia como siempre pasa se involucro
why yo un ser humano como los demas seres
Adopte el punto debil del hombre, mujeres
Ya en ese tiempo no pensaba muy bien 
De la pasion por exeso parecia un reen
Te ahogabas en tus lagrimas why en tus sufrimientos
Yo no se lo que pasaba con mi sentimientos
Luego escuche a todo el mundo decir
Que por mi la vida te ibas a destuir
Yo no crei en tus palabras te ignore como a un perro
why mirate ahora manana es tu entierro
Metida en esa caja sin poderte mover
Todos te lloran why me culpan sin poder comprender
Que fue un error no tina los ojos bien abiertos
Mi amor perdoname aunque hayas muerto

Jossie Esteban,"Sali un dia con mi amigo why su dinero a buscar diversion
Tenia un carro del ano ropa moderna why en su cuello un cadenon
Me presento sus amitadas profesionales de alta posicion
why yo solo aparentaba tener dinero para formar mas union
Conoci una muchacha de ojos azules why cuerpo fenomenal
Dije que era el hijo de un doctor para poderle interesar
La invite a salir why me miro de arriba a abajo hasta que quizo aceptar
why no sabia que estaba formando parte del mundo artificial

Mundo artificial
Mundo artificial

Al llegar a mi casa me puse la mejor ropa que tenia
Era la cita mas cara de mi vida asi que vacie mi alcancia
Cogi el carro de mi tio prestado why sin decir hacia donde iba
Conduci a la casa de la chica why era un palacio desde abajo hasta arriba
Toque la puerta, abrio el papa why pregunto, ""?Tines Dinero?""
why yo le dije usted despreocupese que eso para mi es lo primero
Me invito a pasar me invito a senar pero para ser bien sincero
Me sntia como un simple guzano en el medio de un gallinero
Por fin salimos, fuimos al cine why gozamos sin descanzar
Todo lo que ella tocara con la vista yo lo tenia que comprar
Pero, que importa, nos hicimos novios why nos fuimos a celebrar
why mi mente no comprendia que ella estaba en el mundo artificial

Mundo artificial
Mundo de fantasia

Mi situacion economica empeoro de la noche al amanecer
En esos dias tuve que trabajar duro hasta mas no poder
why todo ese lo hacia para que mis panas ricos pudieran ver
Que a cualquier senorita de cualquier posicion la podia complacer
Su supuesto amor que sentia por mi la hizo pensar en la boda
why yo me dije a mi mismo ""Dios mio pero quien me salva ahora""
why solamente para que todos me dijeran ""Vico-see el casanova""
Decidi complacerla why convertirla para siempre en mi senora
Conclui en que mi pobreza ya no la tenia que negar
Ella decia juraba why aseguraba que siempre me iba a adorar
La lleve a mi casa para que se pudiera familiarizar
why ahi comenzo la tragedia hecha por el mundo artificial

Mundo artificial

Al mirar los humildes muebles que adornaban mi apartamento
Se mostro extranada why se fue, sin tan siquiera tomar asiento
why yo, que no comprendia lo que pasaba en esos momentos
Decidi perseguirla, pero mis pasos fueron demasiado lentos
Me llamo why me confeso que fue una gran desilucion
why yo afectado le dije que queria una simple explicacion
Me dijo que habiamos terminado sin la minima compasion
why colgo el telefono, why esa fue su ultima decision
Decidi salir a buscarla pues yo no podia aceptar
Que me dejara asi porque si con todas mis dudas sin aclarar
Al llegar a su casa mis lagrimas se empezaron a derramar
Cuando la vi con amigo el rico

Jossie Esteban,"Habro los ojos, me levanto leo el vocero
why el porciento de la paz es zero
Crimenes violaciones, mucha malicia
why no me entero de la buena noticia
La culpa es de nosotros el bajo mundo
El paraiso el senor bagabundo
Que suena sin trabajar con mucha ambicion
Pero le falta mucha proteccion
La clase alta tambien tiene culpa de los actos, ?por que?
Por la corruption, excacto
Matan la gente sin pena, esa es su mision
Asi es que viven ganando dinero a monton
No lo interrogue fiscal no busque pista
Ponte a pensar hay que ser realista
El rico invierte dinero de inmediato
Despues el pobre se da el arrebato
Siempre los mismo, es como un drama
Es como una pelicula de fama
Siempre lo mismo why entre comillas
Es como una planta pero sin semillas
Dinero puede controlar hasta la corte
Tanto en el sur como alla en el norte
Creen que lo lujoso es la salvacion
why ahi es que el corrupto entra en accion
Aplastando, abusando, asesinando
Con el dinero poniendose al mando
El pobre siempre se siente esperar
Que se haga justicia aqui en la recta final

Yo no planto bandera pues yo no soy Cristobal Colon
Yo soy del haja casa sien por siento de corazon
De nin caserio yo me quiero hacer dueno
No soy un extranjero soy puertoriqueno
Lo guapos se creen que son conquistadores
why quieren aduenarse de todos los sectores
Ahi es que empiezan a reglar el asunto al tratar
De desaspareserlo del punto
Entonces bienen los tiros why punaladas
La vida del guapeton esta destrozada
La gente lo vio la policia llego
El asesino al bravo asi que nadie hablo
Asi es la ley del asesinato aqui en borinquen
Dejan que los criminales afinquen
Si esto sigue asi escucha bien mi hermano
Los ninos creceran con un canon en la mano
Nuestros futuros, se borraraon
Los tiroteos, se mantendran
Los inocentes, se quejaran
Pues no tienen la culpa de estar como estan
Cerrando sus casas con mil serraduras
Asi sus vidas estaran mas seguras
Pero para tener una vida mas pura
Creer en Cristo es la mejor cura
Yo siento pasar las valas por mi cara
Ese para mi no es una cosa bien rara
El mundo es asi why hay que aceptar
Que donde estamos viviendo es en la recta final

Donde estamo viviendo es en la recta final

La envidia
Otro objecto que asesina
Si te deja llevar te extermina, te busca te agita
Te hare sentir bien mal
Ahi es que el envidioso empieza a matar
why tratar de encontrar la manera de vencer
Dinero why fama no se puede tener
El envidioso vigila todos los pasos que da
Tu hecha pa lante why el te hecha pa tras
La envidia se ve dentro de la gente plastica
Que por encima se ven bien fantastica
Pero algun dia la espalda le da
Te apuntan why *POW* no vives mas
El sexo, cuando se hare por abuso
Que mal se debe sentir el intruso
Violando una nina sin piedad alguna
Violando ninos sacados de la cuna
El hombre que sabe se comporta diferente
Usa la labia inmediatamente
why cuando estan para chusparse los dedos
Convencen las senorita con todo why miedo
La monta, la lleva, la vesa la soba
Le hare promesas, la coje de boda
why de repente la deja atras
Al ver que le ha quidado la virginidad
Las senoritas tienen novios why con tal de conservarlo
Tienden a desnudarse why amarlos
Su padres sufren why tendran que luchar 
Contra el abuso del sexo aqui en la recta final

Contra el abuso del sexo aqui en la recta final

Enfermedades
Tanto el AIDS como el cancer
En todo el mundo hacen un balance
De vida why muerte, paz why sufrimiento

Que la prostitucion lo deja danados
Tambien la giringuilla que ha sido usada
Te deja el cuerpo why las venas danadas
Syphillis hitrofia moscular why herpes
Son integrante del grupo de la muerte
Lo digo bien claro por que asi es que es
Si no te quida el proximo va ser usted
La droga
Quimica extra-peligrosa
Causante de la perdida de vidas hermosas
Es una plaga mundial no culaquier cosa
Un mal de sangre why el diablo se lo goza
La S-I-N-S-E ?la probaste? aja, dime ?como te fue?
Te figaste por el piso como un bum de callejon
Tus amigos te tenian en un vacilon
A cada santo le devia una vela de la cara
La marijuana esa te dejo sin nada
why una noche testigo yo fue
Gritaron !Aguaaa! why te cojieron a ti
En la prision el jefe te dio par de detalles
Tenia una carta recivida de la calle
Que decia que a ti no te gustaba pagar
Asi que fuiste una victima de la recta final

El mundo sigue dando vuelta
why el ser humano se arrastra con el
Pero para todo hay una salida
why en la recta final hay una salida
Es una puerta por donde pocos entraran why muchos se quedaran
Esto no ha sido una simple opinion
Sino lo que yo siento why vivo en tono la verdad de la vida
why para todos ustedes
Hasta siempre

No ten confianza no seas pesimista
De corazon hay que ser optimista
Yo se que mi tema ha penetrado en ti

Wanneer ik pull up op die stage, die hele club in vuur en vlam
M'n hele gang binnen en m'n hele gang fam, Hella Cash
Rubber bands, we racen door heel het land nu
Die rappers begrijpen delen van m'n hele plan nu
Kijk en leer, we flikken het weer
2017 was leuk maar in '18 willen we meer
Terwijl die schapen roepen minder, minder, minder
Was ik op straat aan het rennen met cilinder
Nu ben ik rapper en wiep ik jullie vriendinnen
Zo veel money, weet niet waar ik moet beginnen
Hella cash, maar deze dagen kan ik pinnen

Money komt, money gaat
Maar gelukkig wordt er elke dag weer nieuwe gemaakt
Ik doe niet anders, ik doe niet anders
Ik hossel voor die euro elke dag in de la

Schenk m'n glas, ik feest en ik lach
Vermenigvuldig als ik slaap terwijl ik stack op de pas
In de P.C. Hooftstraat en gaan weg met een volle bak
M'n hele kofferbak gevuld met nieuwe shit voor m'n kast
Was een irritante jongen toen ik zat in de klas
En elke leraar haatte mij dus ik was vaak op de gang
Ben ik bijna miljonair, self-made in Nederland
Geen diploma's in de zakken, geen stress, ik kom d'r aan, mayne
Champagne, honderd flessen in de club, mayne
Maar ik wil Hennessy, baby, show me je energy
Zwaai met m'n middelste vinger naar al m'n enemies
Met m'n ballen op die punk ass haters
Ik heb een hele rare get met izjen big ass laser
Weet die bitches die zijn leuk maar mijne net iets beter
Hoor die rappertjes praten terwijl ze echt niets weten
Ik zie rappers opscheppen maar ze echt niets eten, nah

Teus cabelos tentaram esconder mas vi tua boca feliz

Tua alma leve como as fadas
Que bailavam no teu peito
Tua pele clara como a paz que existe em todo sonho bom
Quis matar os seus desejos
Ver a cor dos teus segredos, baby
E contar pra todo mundo
O beijo que eu nunca esqueci

Sea, sex and sun

Um fim de semana livre
Sair daqui, sair de mim
Uma tarde pela areia
Tudo me faz lembrar você
Descer montanhas
As curvas da estrada
Cenas fortes de paixão e traição
Pelo espelho, a se perder na contramão
Tudo me faz lembrar você
Um perfume bom
Propagandas de batom
Fantasias pra usar no carnaval
Desatinos, corpos quentes, vendaval
Tudo me faz lembrar você

Sea, sex and sun
Tudo me faz lembrar você

Cigarros e lábios, labirintos átonos
Mudanças de tom, refrões de amor
Verdades e segredos
Reflexos e canteiros de girassóis
Se confundem com você o tempo inteiro
E até hoje não houve um só dia
Em que eu não me lembrasse
Daqueles nossos dias
E até hoje não houve um só dia
Em que eu não me lembrasse de você

Sea, sex and sun
Tudo me faz lembrar você",Tudo Me Faz Lembrar Você,2008
Jota Quest,"Basta olhar no fundo dos meus olhos
Pra ver que já não sou como era antes

De alguns instantes

Em um destino forte e implacável
E tudo que nós temos pra viver
É muito mais do que sonhamos

Eu vejo isso por cima de um muro
De hipocrisia que insiste em nos rodear
Eu vejo a vida mais clara e farta
Repleta de toda a satisfação
Que se tem direito do firmamento ao chão

Que não há tempo que volte amor

Que realizar a força que tem uma paixão

De gente fina, elegante e sincera
Com habilidade pra dizer mais sim do que não

Uma maré tranquila ou luar
Foi quando a vida que só me dizia não, não
Veio e me abriu as portas do teu coração

Como é bom morrer de amor
E continuar a viver

É se afastar da dor

Energias cinzas de lembrar
E daqueles tempos só de escuridão
Você abriu as portas do meu coração
