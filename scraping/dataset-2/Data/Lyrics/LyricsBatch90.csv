Is what you gave to me
You got me going
You got me going

How could such a simple thing
Get so out of control
You let me down again
You let me down againI know my place inside your heart

The painted figure that glows in the dark
No you're not mysterious now
I don't worship that sacred cow
In my head

In my head
In my head
You'd never know it
You'd never know it

I went home in a jealous rage
You were rolling on the glass in a younger age
You know what's good for me
I know you're too good for me
'Cause I have seen inside your heart

Religious figures that glow in the dark
No you're not too precious now
And I don't worship that sacred cow
Go and try as you may

To get a sharp shift on Judgment Day
You let me down again
You let me down again
I know my place inside your heart

Tear down the fence that you sit upon
It was good while it lasted but now it has gone
So face up to what you have done
For time immemorial, time immemorial, time

A glorious contest to find the invincible one
And I will know everything there is
Goodbye to you and your money
And I will go anywhere you say if you take away all the cameras
The house that we live in is falling apart
There's no guarantee cause we got it for free
And all the pretenders to somebody's throne
Are finding it out on their own
For time immemorial, time immemorial, time

Will go on a mission to find the invincible one
And I will know everything there is
Goodbye to you and your public
And I will go everywhere you say if you don't charge admission
Okay we're lucky but then again

Will go on a mission to find the invincible one

Crowded House,"One step ahead of you
stay in motion, keep an open mind
Love is a race won by two
Your emotion, my solitude
If I stop I could lose my head
So I'm losing you instead
Either way I'm confused
You slow me down, what can I do?
There's one particular way I have to choose

One step ahead of you
Always someone makes it hard to move
She says, Boy I want you to stay
But I save it all for another day
If I stop I could lose my head
But I'm ready for romance
Either way I'm confused
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
I can only stay
One step ahead of you

Crowded House,"Can you imagine that?
An itch too sensitive to scratch
The light that falls through the cracks
An insect too delicate to catch

I hear the endless murmur

And I can't look back
Fingers of love move down

There is time yet, fall by the way
From the cradle to the grave
To the palace, to the gutter
Beneath the dying waves of the sun
Lie the fingers of love

Through waves of joy and clarity

Laughing while the mad dog sleeps

And I can't look up

Had a blind date with destiny
And the sound of te awamutu

I could not escape
A plea from the heart
You know what it means to me
She said don't walk away
I'm down on my knees
So please don't be mean to me

So I talked to you for an hour
In the bar of a small town hotel
You asked me what I was thinking
I was thinking of a padded cell
With a black and white t.v.
To stop us from getting lonely

I could not escape
A plea from the heart
You know what it means to me
She said don't walk away
I'm down on my knees
So please don't be mean to me
No, I could not escape
A plea from the heart
Mysterious sympathy
I couldn't wait for a chance
To walk out the door

Has ended up in tears on a stormy night
'Cause you can't follow my directions home

I can't tell what's right in front of us
But I hang on every word
And don't stop now
No, don't stop now
You give me something I can write about

You get fooled by the lightning every time

And you turn the wrong way 'round
Well, don't stop now
No, don't stop now
You give me something I can write about
You give me something I can cry about

In a church house ten miles out of town
Is the devil gonna track me down?
And travel through a tunnel in the trees
Just remember that's how you get to me

There's no number on the house
The birds are heading south
Sometimes you have to turn
The wrong way 'round
Sometimes you get too close to nowhere now

This is helpful in the silence

And all I want is something I can write about
All I want is something I can cry about

Crowded House,"English trees in my garden
We planted seeds in a faraway land
In between the palms and the succulent grove

And so hard to climb

I want to keep your hopes alive

To help you believe again
Makers of secret planes
Keepers of our last remains
Dream of a holy state
In a nightmare time

The stories left to write
The ebb and flow of my life
To justify the end
I'll do everything I can
And its a dangerous game
I heard you tell someone that you don't care
But I don't believe the message
And when you sing about love
What are you thinking of

Even a child knows you don't waste it
As long as the world is waking up
And there is no doubt that changes have begun
Even a child knows you don't fake it
A promise is only given once
You are free now to go wherever you want
There's nothing like waking up in some foreign town

Wailing out of speakers in the market place
The first time, even a child
Even a child knows you don't waste it

Am I afraid? No not afraid

Saw the barman wink as he poured his brandy

Is the place where my purpose was found
I'm taking control of my life
And I'm raising an army from hell
And I'm burning this place to the ground

First I'll take the things he loves
Make him feel defeated, make him feel defeated
Then I'll take his fucking heart
Make him watch you eat it, make them watch you eat it
I can't remain here, I'm taking control
So string 'em out, and bare his bones

You think you can hide?

I destroy everything you built
Corner you with nowhere to run
Then I tear your black heart straight out of your chest

Crown Twister,"I don't wanna talk about things we've gone through,
Though it's hurting me, now it's history.
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too,
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.
The winner takes it all,
The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.
 
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there,
I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,
But I was a fool, playing by the rules.
The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice, 
And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
The judges will decide the likes of me abide,
Spectators of the show always staying low.
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend,
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.

Loungin with my Cru, above Meck and Harmony
Bringin like 13 other niggas, at least
Took them for some action, cuz we love to party
The Double Agent, Biggie Smalls and B.D.P.
So um, walked up in the spot, pisses
Hugs, frowns, hugs, disses
Walkin thru the crowd I bumped into Russell Russ
Huggin me some love, you rich motha fuck
Everyone was there, representin
Just a good shit, Funk Flex, representin
All of a sudden I thought shit gettin thin
Wu-tang actin up with their group from Shaolin
Erick Sermon tried to representin his Island
He said ""Hey"", niggas joked him
Redman seen this nigga, uh nuh that's his brother
Jumped over the bar like he was Soopaman Lova
Jersey had his back, that's a fact
But B.D.P. was out to hit this nigg' with they classic traps
Six minutes, KRS you're on
The bridge is over, South Bron drop the bomb
Nas and his boys were in there livin ""Kill that boy""

First to bust off, Fat Joe from P-Long
Black Moon caught mad brooms and they done
Method Man, murdered by the same gun
Kool G. Rap lickin shot and KRS
But he didn't die fast cuz the brother had a vest
Ooh, nigga took Kool G. with him
Both dead from head wounds when the lead hit him
Everybody going buck nuggy, word life
Rakim throwed slit by Eric B's knife
Damn, three kisses gettin iller than I thought
Playin the back on the law, so I won't get caught
Wonder where Yogi is at in this piece

And let them know how the title king is all mine again
If he start to fake jacks, he better make tracks

No doubt I'm goin for mine, and mine is all that matters

is dedicated
to the infamous, late great
Donald  Goines
word life, see-are-you, Cru representaion

""Black Girl Lost"" her pop is ""Daddy Cool""
Former ""Dopefiend"" now a pimp, damn fool
He's a ""Black Gangster"", ""Inner City Hoodlum""
Phat prankster, must admit a pretty good one
But little do he know he on a ""Death List"" and shit
This'll be ""Kenyatta's Escape"", ""Kenyatta's Last Hit""
""Crime Partners"" he and Ken' was
Till one day they spark that traum up and got a buzz
Said he heard Kenyatta had phoned his wife
So, he shot him over this rumor, tried to take his life
Promised Kenyatta would ""Never Die Alone""
So he went home, and shot his wife while she was on the phone
Shot her in the head and then she lay dead
Pimp jeted in his ""Eldorado Red""
Kenyatta didn't die he would ""Cry Revenge""
Wouldn't stop till he saw the pimp's dead end
Pimp went to whore house to see his ""Street Players""
Collect all the doe cause yo that's what the game is
Pimps called ""Swamp Man"" cause he's like a Munster
Violent in the street ever since he was a youngster
See you was a ""Whoreson"", son of a whore
And from this the violent mental scars we wore
Forgot about Kenyatta thought Kenyatta was ghost
While doin what he gotta tryin to make the most
And for those two shootins, he never got caught
Smart man ended up in the new house he bought
Ken' found out with the quickness where he lived
Written the address then went up the crib
Ooze and vest he ain't fest
Sprayed his rest, shit is best to put that pimp to the test
Six months later Ken' was back
Instead of an ooze this time he had a mack in his backpack
Yawnin, in the wee hours of the mornin
Pimps' known to leave his whorehouse at dawnin
There he is, suddenly appears
Nuthin in his hand except a six-pack of Heiniken beers
Steps out the bushes, the trigger he pushes
Hits up ""Swamp Man"" and mad blood gu-she's
Fills him with lead, puts the last in his head
Then slides, ""Swamp Man"" lay dead
Runs up a few blocks there go the cops
They must have heard the RAT-A-TAT-pops of the shots
His mind's racin wonderin what he should
Give up or say, ""Fuck It!"", and spray the cops too
Stops in his tracks and bends down to kneel

Aiyo surprise nigga, I'm on the rise nigga
Loungin while you didn't catch up on my fries nigga

While him and stars talkin bout better

Check ya condition, I got ya prescriptions
I am the arrow and Chad is the crossbow
Say somethin now

[Chadeeo]
Thought so
Flows articulis, ridiculous
Roam the streets, inconspicuous
How many MC's gotta get wet, many more 'cause these
niggas don't seem to know yet
Blow you out the sky like a teeba
747 Street soldier, like Sleeba
Defiance, runnin with a how alliance
Jumps pop shit, but yo they know the science
Read they style like a final call
So they all fall like the Berlin Wall
Create a rivers, more complex then prisms
Got shit locked like prisons
Non faction, indicted no conviction
Beg description with a paper addiction

Then I bring the fire to that ass
Rhythm Blunt goin strong and they burnin kinda fast
Rhythm Blunt, see are you whatever
All my ghetto dwellas boyakah together
Peace to the Gods, the G is the seven
Hittin harder then a ? eleven
And Y.O., you know
Comin through ya block like Hurricane Yugo

[Chadeeo]
You know, it's either rhymes or the straps
Make sure you want it 'cause there's no turn back
The gun ain't my God, but without one it's hard
To get ahead, see the lead, left the niggas scarred
Taught ya soul, in the street without a dime
Had to resort to the heat and petty crime
Then it got deep, some peeps laid to rest
Nine Millie short but partners got blessed
Force to the gun, some people got done
Now we try to channel thoughts into a pun

[Yogi]
Done, increase the peace
When my piece increase
Only act increase, when the gat release
Come play like Jeru, ya prophet resolves my shit
True, Rhythm Blunt comes through with the Illz

Nah  chill.....it was December

Partied through the New Year 

January third he slid 

Up until then  yo  L had it swell 

Called him Sweet Pea like his name was Pernell 

He did the job  money came with ease 

Blowing outta town  moving bricks and ki's 

Him and his chick  in forty G rides 

Holding down fort like they Bonnie N Clyde

Now out to budget 

With a movie star chick from outta Edenwald Projects 

Nice job, took prison camp drives 

While he promised up and down to live a civilized lifestyle 

The seat off the brow was soon on garment 

Both worked 

Got themselves a two-bedroom apartment 

Great statement, without delayment, away and went 

Saved to get a house on one of them low down payments 

But an idea concocted his stock 

Why don't we try and turn this money over on the drug tip 

So he gave his man a shriek and excitement 

Didn't know his peeps were under secret indictment 

Sick of the path that'll get you hung by the neck

And now she's gone, ain't no sun
Shine meaning she's gone

It's the Mighty Ha drinkin' Mo' at the bar
Bakee after bakee, blunt after blunt
Smoke a bag of buhdah and became bitche's with the skunk
Nat ""King"" Cole was a merry old soul
Made you move that ab, drop shit from your whole
Grab a budjock and lick shot from the glock
You were told to swing off a tree from a jump
Run up in attics and Elvis, now I'm gone
Back on the streets in the heart of P Long
Man oh man lick shots if I have to
Submit to me as your lord and master
It's the Mighty Ha, I'm a street Bronx, I
Deliver the real like Walter Chronkite
God I'm a destiny, black man
Devil's in the rain receive the backhand

Yesterday, my trouble seems so far away
So help me Wanda, help, help, me Wanda

Be a none beast known and the why-O-G
Make your moon walk, spin walk grab your ti-ty
Hit you in the head with the broom to the back
Sport a pair of Balley's and a Mighty Ha hat
Comin from the Bronx like KRS-One
Electrify the crowd like they shooting stone guns
rhythm Blunt Cru, Violator, Def Jam
Known for tricken lyrics and smackin mad hands
Ahh, don't give a uh
Caught for the cause 17 to the shot
It's the Mighty Ha with the mic and the glock
My style's buck naughty what day is it ack?
Type of situation pops from uptown
You can lick balls cause I front to be down
Til I lie rep a dollar kickin the Willies to the Hiedy
rhythm Blunt Cru, ""Baby"" Chris Lighty

Ponies never ran before
Rain never fell
Til I met you
And I can't get enough of your love, babe

What!?
Chim, chim, chiminie chim, chim, che-ree
Comin from the top, ah, it's the Migh-ty
Hit you with the felony and a misdemeanor
Hit a hundred push-ups and I got the spray Alenor
Got mad buttocks, ass cheeks, yo stop
Got more charges than a Nicachew pac
I'm the maker, owner, cream of the crop
Felicha you erection to the top
I can't seem to get rid of these fuckin chickenheads
Word to the mother drop dead brest fed
You better duck down when I draw my 8 luger
Scoop that ass quickie, better skin bag of booty

With the drop town down, with the funky sounds
Chillin with my peoples, and tomorrow there's gonna be a sequel

Beautiful ladies callin out cross pimpin
Blastin phone numbers, baggin off to the other
Findin out later that's ya man baby mother
Sippin henecy, everyone lookin jiggy
Buy a bag of smoke, hydro, get the fitty
want to roller skate, ring style, extra glide
Hit it to the bounce, say ride (where we at?)
The Cru on the desert, Mecca, Medina
(Hum do love) Oh you never heard of Nina
Gotta a lotta things he end up doin, baby
Nuff to make a nuh, go crazy
Take a minute, pause for a group flick
Cru and the Gucci don called Mark Pitts
And the whole fleet of uptowns
Harlem Nights, Bronx Bombers and a bunch of four pounders
I like how it feels, I like how it keeps it sureal, for real
And yo how I like how I put shit together

Back of my building, the park green benches
Nails bein chewed by the white clean dentures
Shh, No kid is him in the ears
Warm my lap, a head with no hair
Beats freestylin, but all we can talk
Rhymin with force, till the jokes get corpsed
Tools on my waist, and a frown on my face
Just in case the enemy tries to bring a base
The kid to be a waste, after a taste
Of the hot lid, which is mercury laced
In the neighborhood, so far, so good
Somebody gotta be up to no good
Shots fired on Watson Avenue
Where they won't hesitate, shoot me, stabbin you (True)
That's aight, every night they be blowin
Keep their glock hot while we keep the cash flowin
It's another Cru, that's two in the system
Thinkin of E and Squirrel, how much is missed 'em
But I'mma stay sounded, my peeps is around
'cause of them I keeps my feet on solid ground

Hey good looking? What you got cookin?, nuthin
But you got my baby in the oven
You bring the knowledge to my brain, sooth my pain
Make me the man that I am, keep me sane
I travel through my mind, through time and found you
Right at the very essence, there was your presence
Came out your womb, made you my wife
Then came around to complete the cipha, I gave you life
I heard you was the mother of the earth, (TRUE)
And I respect that for what it's worth, boo
This is how we do, you scratch my back I scratch yours
Wipe your blood and sweat when they drip out your pores
You wouldn't let the fame and the money get to me
I won't go out like O.J, even though he free, and we
Can rise eternally, up above

But that ain't my steez, I ain't fuckin with slum bitches
I'm talkin everlovin', the real from the fake
Then one that will bend, but then again that won't break
Often imitated and simulated but never duplicated
10-rated, keeping their wears up-dated, Ain't it?
By the fact their personality work, a dime piece
That's small, cool, and hurt make me go bezerk
And if you got it she's yours, and yours only
Never leavin a man ever lonely, she keeps it to the grave
Cause dealin on a flame when it's needed

Get down, get down with the rhythm in your ear
And peep out the sound from here

Keep my jail ceasar, instead of a nasty tight lock

That leaves niggas strung
By the flip of a lip, by the flung
Of a tongue
Couldn't care less if the world blew up
But I wanna blow up before it blows
Thru flows
Of persistance
Which make a difference
In my everyday existence
Causin me to go the long distance
But back to a simple style and type format
As I stomp on comp just like a doormat
This type stuff's under lock and key (key)
Chad is a ruff as ruff can be (be)
Now how ruff can that be, well let's go figa
Ruffa than son of sam with a slam trigga
Ruffa than a criminal takin a liquor swigga
Ruffa than the voice on that kid Lord Digga
So toodaloo, ta-ta, cheerio
This here shit is type Pronto

Pronto, nigga gimme yours
All a bitch could do for me is
Eat dick and drop her drawers
Pronto, nigga gimme yours
All a bitch could do for me is
Eat dick and drop her drawers

All a bitch could do for me is

Yo it's the Island were Urban Knights dwell
Few blocks from the number six train 'L'
Can be a good stay in the hood way
Or the fun can turn to guns and it could spray

Walk humble, ya be ready to gun bumble
'cause it's real like that, all around
And the same thing applies when ya come to my town

Bring more noise to chip ??

In the Bronx, L.I.P. back to rocks
Bounce to the ash, like the Atlantic ??

Better keep that head down.
Pick a bigger strap, better come equip
And don't trip cause I'm bout to let it loose.
Pullin' out a pocket knife
Will get you snyped
And you know niggas is gonna have to shoot.
Could it be that I had the loot 
In a mood for bustin' chickens
Nigga thought he had him a sweet vic
But he had him a schizophrenic.
Better have that itchy for the homicide
Ain't no love, I'ma let it ride
Now it's gonna be a showdown.
On the lowdown,
Better stay inside
Trippin' cause a nigga gonna die
If Billy Joe didn't tell that lie
He would still be in the barn.
Instead, he got buckshots in his right side.

Head for the hills

Get ready,
Set trip,
I'm comin' wit a nine millimeter motherfucker
Block bam,

Cause when I come this time

Not just my hood, but town from town
Making motherfuckers recognize the flavor
Coming from Chi-Town.
Yee-Haw!
Be quick to draw 
Pick a nigga meat up out with a chainsaw.
Make a nigga see what he never saw.
Crucial Conflict comin' at you raw
For a showdown,
We don't play around.
Motherfuckers gone die
We gone kill 'em up pal.
Motherfuckers playing these damn games,
Kill 'em up in the showdown.

Cold Hard, WildStyle, Kilo & Neverless
You all are being charged with
Kidnapping, aggravated assault,
Armed robbery, money laundering,
Dope slanging and gang banging
And all that other type a shit
That I can't believe
Tell me, do you think you're guilty

Verse 1: WildStyle

Look here your honor
My life was full of broken dreams
I had to hustle on the corner
Selling crack to the fiends
Dope slanger, gang banger,
Shit, had to be it
Give the hoes a break up quick.
A PIMP I was born to be
The hoes was bringing me liquor
And the fiends was calling me God
My connection was the government
They gave me the job
I was slanging on the block
Two for ten, after dark
Pump blasted two springs dead
All you heard was BLOWS BARRED
We was slanging them automatics
Fuck them niggas that tried to jack
Rags to riches told the bitches
Motherfucker I'm a maniac
My case is a nowhere
Cause my lawyer's got a grudge
Fuck it, I'm guilty
Suck my dick judge

Verse 2: Cold Hard

Hey I'm sorry to become
What a motherfucker became
It was the way that I was raised
In this motherfucking game
Try to tame myself
But it wasn't no help
Hell yeah a nigga snapped
Had to keep my fucking rep
Making gosh darn niggas step
Always trying ta test me
Cause I'm a big old shorty
When I upped her thing
It weren't no game
Playing wid this shit's got me horny
When I was just a little boy
Played wid hoes instead of toys
Fuck what a motherfucker say
I'm going to drink my banging choice
Cause I wasn't one a them ones bitch
I grew up a lunatic
Had to have my snap so I jack
So I roll wid a big ol' ass clik
Know how WildStyle, Kilo, Never
Beat the system did it clever
All this shit that we endured
Tryin' to tell it to the judge

Hook 2x:

Coming up in this game
Was a bogus generation
Living life just to bang
Just to slang's my occupation
Tryin' to make it some way
And it don't matter cause my attitude
And visions the same
So you can tell it to the judge dude

Verse 3: Never

Now as a young buck in the hood
It was hard to get by hard to make it
Had to make a way anyway I could
So I had to take it
And it drove me to a point
That I had my mind on bustin'
Caught up in the lifestyle of a thug
Guess it was up in the blood
Niggas try to play me bogus shit
Nigga roll you know I'm slick
Rolling wid a bogus clik
So nigga just kill that shit
Ran up in the nigga's crib
Didn't think that he was gonna live
Pull the trig, heard him scream
But he didn't die cause he was a fiend
Strung on dope
And the nigga ran his mouth
And now I'm locked up
Looking up out the window
Ain't no window
And it's fucked up
Could it be that I had a grudge
Couldn't show him no fucking love
Caught a case, face to face
Had to tell it to the judge

Verse 4: Kilo

Yeah you caught me now
But I already went to hell and back
For my life as a gang banger
Standing out in the cold
And I can't slanga
Never thought I'd live this long
Went to sit in a room by myself
Having thoughts of all the things
That I've lost in the world
Thinking I'm getting close to death
But now I'm having flashbacks
And I can't get no freedom
Never had no pot to piss in
Nobody to help me out, so a nigga sin
Robbing bitches broke and dumb
Couldn't read and write to one
Gats you never trust
Snatching chains from the back of the bus
And it ain't no thing for me to pop a bitch
I broke my shit to the left and killed
Arms, legs, legs, arms, head
Forgive me for my damn sin
Now I'm facing double life
But life ain't long enough punk
Cause that's to the bodies in my trunk
Now I got to face the judge

Hook 2x

Specially when I come to shoot

Should've broke it to the left man

Could it be that a nigga want to play game,
And the game done already been played,
Trying to get with this gangbangalistic shit
for your homies in they grave,
Had to think about murder but you couldn't go deep,
So get ready for tha street sweeper, going to be a cold creeper
When you told the playa pimp ill beat ya
and a nigga like me was always in the game
'cause I kept my shit tight,niggas talkin bout we used to fight
Nigga used to get they ass (???), and its still the same up in the CHI
that's where my nigga rose dwell, bustin butts up in they face,
On the murder case, bring they bullet proofs wit mace,
And you we was all good, comin up, getting paid
Smokin on a fat sack, gat to the left

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree

The way we planned, it didn't make sense 
But then again, I'm probably wrong for you my dear
See her in the magazine 
How's everything on her scene 
Read her in the Interview 
It wasn't half bad she said 
It's late now I'm in bed and tired 
Not quite drunk enough, forced to think for a while 
Of why I never wrote or called 
Or why I never did anything at all
Lie here in my bed alone 
Try and block out the drone 
Of that salad dressing month we had 
She was right, it wasn't half bad
And somehow it just might make sense 
I think I get it, I think I understand
Still I wonder I'll 
I wonder

And now she's coasting over me
She's over me
I told you so, the vim is gone
I wonder what went wrong
And now I know I'm in between
I've come to grips with what that means
I stop, did I miss my turn
What didn't I learn was I not around when roll was called
I stop, did I miss my turn
Another round when boredom becomes fear
Just give me something I can use
But with the knowledge it might be abused
I just sit in my room
I just stare at these walls
And now recall it doesn't help me at all

I'm caught thinking towards the days
When summaries didn't cloud
And everything I did made my mother proud

Where did I get those winter ways

With my hands in my pockets
With my mouth on the ground

It's not just those that I despise
But your lack of attention
It's just a problem you need
Swing
Did you ever get that letter that I wrote you
Said I hope you feel better soon
Maybe by then we could comprehend
How to work things out, how not to shout
When we sit down late
Mourning for the death of your ever-present pout

Happened to me now, man

I let this nigga come out my house and he fucked my bitch
But I'm gone kill him when he get off work tonight though
Man, fuck dat hoe man, you can't be tryin' to save that bitch
My nigga and them housed the hoe on Brown and Frayser

Man, I spent cheese on her and everything
And I bought rangs and some mo' shit
I'mma kill that nigga dat I'm goin' marry
You can't turn a hoe into a house wife man

I love her man, I love her man
Quit lying man, I love her man
I gotta marry her man
I'mma marry her

Don't save her she don't wanna be saved

I'mma introduce me, Project Pat, I keep it real
I'mma introduce you, you's a sucka faking deals
If you gonna let these freaky hoes run yo life
I don't understand how you turn a freak into a wife

I don't even get why you be eating out her draws
You done bought the bitch a phone
Now you screening in all the calls
It's about 4 a.m., she ain't nowhere to be found

Somewhere wit her friend, dick in face and turned to ground
But you best save it last and you know that she'll go
Suckin' dick, chewin' cat, and I hear she on that blow
Did a line maybe two now she down to do the dew

Took her to the studio so she down to do the crew
I know just what to do, you can ask the hoe to leave
Once the bitch pack her shit, hurry up and run them streets
Two things I ain't never in my life done seen before
It's a U.F.O. or a hoe that wouldn't go

Don't save her she don't wanna be saved

You be tryna, save a sweater but you need the fuckin' letter
Be the bitch she really is-a, suck my dick, you goin' kiss her
Hating hoes, try to dis her every nigga wanna hit her
Get her in the bed lay her down boots wanna fell

Call her up there, nig man there's a way-a
She the star of the foota pussy wet real gooda
Camcorder caught on tape, did I stutter man
I should of fucked her in her mouth fast, she be taking all cash

Keep my tank from Florida she pay for my gas
Ass for my nigga drop-a somewhere tryna watch her
Pregnant by another man but you wanna be the papa
Nut, come, but she crave-a backseat misbehava
You'll never get the bitch 'cause she wit that West Haven

Stop saving these hoes let another nigga get 'em

That you can no longer fall

Crüxshadows,"It was many and many a year ago
In a kingdom by the sea
That a maiden there lived whom you may know
By the name of Annabel Lee
And this maiden she lived with no other thought
Than to love and be loved by me

I was a child and she was a child
In this kingdom by the sea
But we loved with a love that was more than love
I and my Annabel Lee
With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
Coveted her and me

And this was the reason that long ago
In this kingdom by the sea
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
My beautiful Annabel Lee
So that her highborn kinsman came
And bore her away from me
To shut her up in a sepulcher
In this kingdom by the sea

The angels, not half so happy in heaven
Went envying her and me
Yes, that was the reason
(As all men know in this kingdom by the sea)
That the wind came out of the cloud by night
Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee

But our love, it was stronger by far than the love
Of those who were older than we
Of many far wiser than we
And neither the angels in heaven above
Nor the demons down under the sea
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee

For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee
And the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee
And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side
Of my darling, my darling, my life and my bride
In the sepulcher there by the sea
In her tomb by the sounding sea

",Annabel Lee [Spoken],2000
Crüxshadows,"dreams lie shattered shards endure now the wraiths her mind possess
like shells of precious flowers dried out and hung with love
making eyes into frozen temples that stale you in her gaze
so pale so cold so beautiful if not clinically insane

now the decades pass unanswered and she prays with silent lips
sometimes she talks to angels when she has her little fits
but you must believe in something - sometime that something's real
sometimes our motivations are tied up in what we feel

so elegant her poetry falls from her pallid lips
she flows like icy roadways when the wheels start to slip
and if her course lays waste to this i pray away to your design
her minions shall dance your dreaming eyes and sing her fragile rhymes

Around and around

Swims; the forest of my dreams
Swims; the essence I call me

Come bringing back now can't explain
The measures swept away in pain 
Hatred, will I escape your grasp?
Buried feelings let me pass

I cannot kill this final flame
The fire that once consumed my heart

And Chance must keep this fire

Crüxshadows,"Hear the voice of the unremembered heart
Hear the silence between each word
Black and white divided grays that cut between us
Filled with broken shards of promised days

I'm standing far ahead
Always looking backwards
I'm standing far behind
With eyes fixed on tomorrow

Breathe in deep, and open your heart again
The fire burns where the embers fall
So love, in spite of the pain you feel
For the lives we live - follow after all

Where are the artists and the prophets?
Lost below the wheels of this machine..
Because money drives the vanity of human culture

They dance upon the fire
They dance upon the stony ground

My memories play out of tune

You can't undo the hearts you break
You can't erase the poet's fate
Not even if you try

With deeper sadder eyes
The only thing she said
No one hears Cassandra cry
Because the earth is standing still
And the truth becomes a lie
A choice profound is bittersweet
No one hears Cassandra cry

A heartfelt sorrow I believe
Offered this for passion's crime
A crippled satellite trapped in orbit

The listless price of my descension
Where emptiness has pulled me down
Cascading from my divagation

As serpents rigid in the cold
Waiting for the warmth of Sunday
Before the cruelty of growing old

Fall before the rains
A vanguard to approaching war
Is borne upon the sea
The icy breath of cyclones bent
On waging our destruction
Drills hard against the hearts of heroes
Called here to defend

I see storms on the horizon
I see the tempest at the gates
I see storms on the horizon
And a citadel alone
Clinging brave defying fate
And I will stand here at the gates to face the onslaught fighting
Without surrender or defeat
With Troy besieged by tyrants' greed - (tyranny)
In Hector's memory, God willing
We shall save this victory
Without surrender or defeat

Sudden silence - I realize
Breaking teardrops in the rain
With every breathing moment
The pillars are sustained
Waking hands attached to nothing
Tightly clutching close
Each sleeping vision speaks unheard
And heaven only knows (exactly why)

With yellow feathers in her hair and a dress cut down to there 
She would merengue and do the cha-cha 
And while she tried to be a star 
Tony always tended bar

They were young and they had each other 
Who could ask for more?

He wore a diamond 
He was escorted to his chair, he saw Lola dancing there 
And when she finished,he called her over 
But Rico went a bit to far 
Tony sailed across the bar 
And then the punches flew and chairs were smashed in two 
There was blood and a single gun shot 
But just who shot who? 

At the copa she lost her love 

Her name is Lola, she was a showgirl, 
But that was 30 years ago, when they used to have a show 
Now it's a disco, but not for Lola,

Faded feathers in her hair

She lost her youth and she lost her Tony 
Now she's lost her mind

You have known the kiss of sorrows
Doors that would not take you in
Outcast and a stranger
You have come by way of sorrow you have come by way of tears
But you'll reach your destiny meant to find you all these years
Meant to find you all these years
You have drunk a bitter wine with none to be your comfort
You who once were left behind will be welcome at love's tables
You have come by way of sorrow you have come by way of tears
But you'll reach your destiny 
Meant to find you all these years
Meant to find you all these years

You will one day come to know
You will one day come to know
All the nights that joy has slept will awake to days of laughter
Eone the tears that you have wept
You'll dance in freedom ever after
You have come by way of sorrow you have come by way of tears
But you'll reach your destiny

Cry Cry Cry,"My name is Dodge  but then you know that


It's written on the chart there at the foot end of the of the bed
  
They think I'm blind that I can't read it
I've read it every word and every word it says is death
So confession Is that the reason that you came
  

Get it off my chest before I check out of the game
Since you mention it well there's thirteen things I'll name
Thirteen crosses high above the cold Missouri waters
August 49 North Montana

The hottest day on record the forest tinder dry
  
Lightning strikes in the mountains
I was crew chief at the jump base
I prepared the boys to fly
         
Pick the drop zone C47 comes in low
Feel the tap upon your leg that tells you go
See the circle of the fire down below

Fifteen of us dropped above the cold Missouri waters

Gauged the fire I'd seen bigger

So I ordered them to side hill we'd fight it from below

We'd have our backs to the river
       
We'd have it licked by morning even if we took it slow
   
But the fire crowned jumped the valley just ahead
       
There was no way down headed for the ridge instead
   
Too big to fight it we'd have to fight that slope instead

Flames one step behind above the cold Missouri waters
Sky had turned red smoke was boiling

Two hundred yards to saftey
         
Death was fifty yards behind
    
I don't know why I just thought it

I struck a match to waist high grass running out of time
        
Tried to tell them step into this fire I've set
       
We can't make it this is the only chance you'll get
   
But they cursed me
    
Ran for the rocks above instead

I lay face down and prayed above the cold Missouri waters

Then when I rose like the phoenix

In that world reduced to ashes
     
There was none but two survived

I stayed that night and one day after

Carried bodies to the river

Wondering how I stayed alive   
Thirteen stations of the cross to mark their fall
                         
I've had my say I'll confess to nothing more

I'll join them now those that they left me long before

Cry Cry Cry,"There's a problem, feathers, iron
Bargain buildings, weights and pulleys
Feathers hit the ground before the weight can leave the air
Buy the sky and sell the sky and tell the sky and tell the sky

Don't fall on me (what is it up in the air for?) (it's gonna fall)
Fall on me (if it's there for long) (it's gonna fall)
Fall on me (it's over, it's over me) (it's gonna fall)

There's the progress we have found (when the rain)
A way to talk around the problem (when the children reign)
Building towered foresight (keep your conscience in the dark)
Isn't anything at all (melt the statues in the park)
Buy the sky and sell the sky and bleed the sky and tell the sky

Don't fall on me  (what is it up in the air for?) (it's gonna fall)
Fall on me (if it's there for long) (it's gonna fall)
Fall on me (it's over, it's over me) (it's gonna fall)

Don't fall on me

Well, I could keep it above
But then it wouldn't be sky anymore
So if I send it to you, you've got to promise to keep it whole

Buy the sky and sell the sky and lift your arms up to the sky
And ask the sky and ask the sky

Don't fall on me (what is it up in the air for?) (it's gonna fall)

Cry Cry Cry,"I'm the kid who ran away with the circus
Now I'm watering elephants
But sometimes I lie awake in the sawdust
Dreaming I'm in a suit of light
Late at night in the empty big top I'm 
All alone on the high wire
Look, he's working without a net this time
He's a real death-daffier
 
I'm the kid who always looked out the window
Failing tests in geography
But I've seen things far beyond just the schoolyard
Distant shores of exotic lands
They're the spires of the Turkish empire
It's six months since we made landfall
Riding love with the spice of India
Through Gibraltar, we're rich men all
 
I'm the kid who thought we'd someday be lovers
Always held out that time would tell
Time was talking, I guess I just wasn't listening
No surprise if you know me well
And as we're walking toward the train station
There's a whispering rainfall
'Cross the boulevard you slip your hand in mine
In the distance the train calls
 
I'm the kid who has this habit of dreaming
Sometimes gets me in trouble too
But the truth is I could no more stop dreaming
Than I could make them all come true
",The Kid,1998
Cry Cry Cry,"We made Oklahoma a little after three
Randy, his brother Bob, and my old GFC
We had some moonshine whiskey and some of Bob's homegrown
We were so messed up we didn't know if we were drunk or stoned

Randy was a sad sack - tall, kinda frail
Bob was a raving maniac, crazier than hell
We been kicked out of high school several years ago
For kicking over port-o-cans at the 4-H rodeo

Since they done the little dance right outside the law
Popped twice in Oklahoma and once in Arkansas
And I don't know what possessed me to want to tag along
'Cause I was raised a Christian, and I knew right from wrong

[Chorus]
Right or wrong, black or white
Cross the line, you're gonna pay
Into the dawn before the light
Live or die by shades of gray

We stole two Charolais heifers 
From Randy's sweetheart's pa
And sold them at the livestock sale outside of Wichita
We got nine hundred dollars and never did suspect
The world of hurt we'd be in once we cashed that check

Next day we heard the story on the local radio
And made our plans that very night to go to Mexico
And I swear we would've made it if it wasn't for the shine
I got sick about the time we crossed that Kansas line

[Chorus]

I was lying in the bar ditch, praying I would die
When a light came on above us
And a voice called from the sky
A half dozen unmarked cars came screeching to a halt

They grabbed Bob, he started screaming that it was my fault
There were men and dogs and helicopters flying all around
They had the brothers on the pickup hood
And me on the ground

Then Bob flew all to pieces, but Randy - he held tight
When a black man in a suit and tie stepped into the light

He told his men to turn us loose
And they put down their guns
He said these are just some sorry kids
They ain't the ones

[Chorus]

They left us by the roadside downhearted and alone
Randy got behind the wheel, said, ""Boys, I'm going home.""
So we turned 'round and faced our fate, hung over but alive
On that morning Oklahoma, late April ninety-five",Shades of Gray,1998

There is something about You
I need to know more of

When I fall on my knees
It's in my prayer, oh God
Take me beyond the veil
Give me more of You, You

Oh Lord, and if it's not too much to ask
I want a deeper relationship with You
I want the oil of God to flow in me
Through and through

Here I am on bended knees
With outstretched arms crying Lord
Not my will, but Your will
Less of me, and more of You
I need more, I need more

As I go before Your throne
I give the praise to You alone
I lift my hands and give You worship
For You are God alone

Let Your glory fill this place
Show Your hand of mercy
I can't speak right until You come, Lord
Let Your presence fall on me

Here I am, accept my words
Accept my praise
I'm broken, I'm thirsty
Let Your blood flow through my veins
I desire more of You

Here I am, accept my words
I'm broken, I'm thirsty
Let Your blood flow through my veins
I want more, must have more
I gotta have more, I need more

I need more to lean right
I need more to walk right
I must sing for more, sing it for more
Many more

Here I am Lord
Yes, I'm here waiting on You
I need Your hand to be stretched
Down upon me, yes Lord
I need more of You, Lord
I need more of You, Lord

What will I be without You?
What can I do without You?
I'm yearning for You, I'm addicted for You

Want to stay in this moment forever
I'm gonna give you all the love that I've got

You're the only one I'll ever desire
Turn the lights down low, make the world go slow

Nothing moves me like you do when you tease me
And to rush would be a crime

Just a childish fantasy

Prayin' for a miracle to let him sleep

He's got a woman back home and a woman in the city
Both of them sittin' by the phone and he can't stand it
How could such a simple man be in so deep

When he believes in the miracle of love
And she believes the same
And he believes that the woman that shares his love
Should share his name, should share his name

Well, his head's sayin' no and his heart's sayin' maybe
Torn between the places he's been sleepin'
Prayin' for a miracle that he won't get caught

He's just an old-fashioned man with a modem day problem
Weighted down by the secrets he's been keepin'
The things he didn't think about and the things he thought

When he believes in the miracle of love
And she believes the same
And he dozed off thinkin' that the woman that bears his child
Should bear his name, should bear his name

There's a page turned down in the family Bible
God never wrote what it said in there
It's the name and the number of a woman
In Memphis, Tennessee

Not a chapter away from the crossin' of the Jordan
Pain that only she can bear
She's got the same full name as a woman in Memphis

But you get colder every day
Every night you turn away
You couldn't say it
Any plainer if you tried

'Cause there's nothing colder
Than your old cold shoulder
And it's gettin' colder
Like every kiss

You say it's not over
Over and over
But your old cold shoulder
Tells me it is

But your old cold shoulder
Tells me it is

Crystal Gayle,"I'll never let you see
The way my broken heart is hurting me
I've got my pride and I know how to hide
All the sorrow and pain
I'll do my crying in the rain

If I wait for cloudy skies
You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes
You'll never know that I still love you
So though the heartaches remain
I'll do my crying in the rain

Raindrops falling from heaven
Will never wash away my misery
But since we're not together
I'll wait for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see

Someday when my crying's done
I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun
I may be a fool
But till then, darling, you'll never see me complain

Crystal Gayle,"It takes all the faith that's in you
Takes your heart and it takes mine
It takes love to be forgiven
Living in these troubled times

When it rains on the range
And it snows in the Spring
You're reminded again

It's just a march of the dying
Living in these troubled times

Brings you down to buy a paper
If you read between the lines
No one seems to have the answer
To living in these troubled times

Still you try and you try
And you do what you must do
It's the march of the dying
Living in these troubled times
Loving in these troubled times

It takes a man, it takes a woman
It took your heart and it took mine
It takes love to be forgiven
Living in these troubled times

It's the march of the dying

You stayed to see it through.
You never gave up on me when I was making

Did not understand the moods,
All those long and sleepless nights I put us through,

Gave me love everyday
And now there's nothing,
In this world I wouldn't do for you.

Where nobody's right and nobody was wrong

And the misery entwine you

Whenever a new love never turns out like it seems

Told me you were through with me and

But how can you tell,
You never get inside my head.
The times we talk, we never speak,

Rivers with no end,
Flowing on the other side of me.

You know I like to spend my morning time

What you've seen is what I've been

And there is nothing I can hide from you

You see me better than I can

Out on the road that lies before me now

There are some turns where I will spin

I only hope that you can hold me now

Til I can gain control again

No matter what seas I've been sailing on

I'll always roll your way again

Crystal Johnson,"Word up, son, I heard they got you on the run
For a body - now it's time to stash the guns
They probably got the phones tapped so I won't speak long
Gimme a hot second, and I'mma put you on
It's all messed up somebody snitchin on the crew
And word is on the street is they got pictures of you
Homicide came to the crib last night, six deep
Askin' on your whereabouts and where d'you sleep
They said they just wanna question you, but me and you know
That once they catch you, all they do is just arrest you
Then arraign you, hang you, I don't think so
It's a good thing you bounced for now just stay low
Once in a blue I check to see how you're doin
I know you need loot, so I send it through Western Union
They probably knock down the door
In the middle of the night, sometimes around four
Hopin to find who they lookin for but they won't succeed
All they gonna find is mad empty bags of weed
But word son, you got the projects hotter than hell
Harder for brothers, to get they thug on but oh well
Son they know too much, even the hoodrat chicks
Oh you heard who did what, no I don't know who did shit!
So stop askin, then I know I'm not goin crazy
From windows, I see lights flashin and maybe
Somebody's takin' pictures - you know who that be
Police lovers, and neighborhood snitches
They put up your sheet so everybody's pointin fingers
And lyin, aiyyo son, the temp is risin

The temperature's risin, no there's nothin surprisin
The temperature's risin, huh and ain't nothin surprisin
The temperature's risin, huh and ain't nothin surprisin
The temperature's risin (There's nothin surprisin)

What up black? Hold your head wherever you at
On the flow from the cops with wings on your back
That snitch nigga - gave police your location
We'll chop his body up in six degrees of separation
Killer listen, shit ain't the same without you at home
Phony niggas walk around tryin to be your clone
They really fear you, when you was at home they was pale
That's why they wanna see you either dead or in jail
By the time you hear this rhyme you'll probably be locked up
Tried to hide somewhere along the lines your plans slipped up
Got caught up in a crime that you can't take back
Reminisce on how I used to pick you up in the Ac
Years ago when we was younger seemed the hood took us under very deep
Wonderin who snitched it got me losin lots of sleep
At night, you know my mouth is tight
I never sang to the cops cause that shit ain't right
Sometimes I stroll past the scene of the crime and backtrack
Damn - why the situation go down like dat?
It'll be a long time before the heat dies down
And a - couple of years 'fore we see you around
Butt 'til then maintain and keep your story the same
The cops is grabbin wrong niggas, lookin for someone to blame
They harrassin, strugglin to find the truth
There's a chance ya case'll get thrown out, cause they ain't got no proof
To say you're guilty, your fingerprints filthy
Deliver - me the gun, I'll tie it to a brick and throw it in the river
Make sure it sinks to the bottom
Outsmart police, snuck you out the projects, we got 'em
But still, but still, but still

愛を信じるのは
自分にも負けないこと
夢が叶う日まで
笑顔のまま星を見て祈り捧げ
ここにいるから
私は君にとっての空でいたい
哀しみまでも包み込んで
いつでも見上げるときは
ひとりじゃないと
遠くで思えるように
帰る場所であるように

君がいない街で
相変わらずに元気で過ごしてる
それが今私に
できること そう思うから
どんな出来事にも
隠れてる意味があるの
夢が消えかけても
自分らしくいてほしい
どんなときもここにいるから
涙失くすほど強くなくてもいい
疲れた心休ませてね
素敵な明日を願い眠りについて
小さな子供のように
この広い世界はつながってる
白い雲は流れ風になって
君のもとへ
私の声は届きますか?
あふれる気持ち言えなかった
私は君にとっての空でいたい
哀しみまでも包み込んで
いつでも見上げるときは
ひとりじゃないと
遠くで思えるように
帰る場所であるように

I know that I'll be alright
一つ一つ 大切な出会い

強がりだった 素直じゃなかった
でも共に輝いてた

忘れないよ サヨナラ
あの日交わした 君と別れ際に
今も響くよ 「10年後も笑おう」
一つ一つ 自分の光信じて
確かなことわかった気がした
胸が痛くて とても苦しくて
逃げ出しそうになった時
一人じゃないって
手を伸ばしてくれた
涙が止まらなかった

Si je m'en sors c'est parce que j'ai du flair

Sur cette planète obscure, j'dois protéger mes frères

S-Croums t'inquiète on f'ra mal comme le kho de Mekra
Quand j'vois mon père, j'ai rien à lui dire j'aimerais l'prendre dans mes bras
Ou peut-être que j'ai trop à lui dire, mais trop de pudeur
J'l'ai jamais vu s'plaindre, même quand il travaillait jusqu'à plus d'heure
Ma mère m'a élevé à la dure, une éducation stricte
Elle m'a dit : ""Les enfants gâtés sont des petits garçons tristes"", hein
Et c'est maintenant que j'aperçois ces vérités
J'remercierai jamais assez maman pour sa sévérité, ça c'est d'l'amour
Grâce à elle, j'me contente de peu
Un couché de soleil et je contemple Dieu
J'ai rien zappé maman
J'me souviens qu'à cette époque je t'aimais tellement que je cassais tes clopes
Et Dieu m'est témoin, mon père c'est mon exemple
J'met les bouchées double, fidèle au bushido
Un peu de rap pour bercer mon exode
J'avais la dalle d'un jeune rom, j'inventais des jeux d'rôles
Maintenant je vis mes rêves comme si j'avais invoqué Shenron
Choisis bien ton chemin, sans chômer
Putain c'est chan-mé, j'me voyais pas devenir show-man
Je vis ma vie comme un shōnen
Les vaines souffrances humaines, t'emmènent de longues semaines au lit
On veut même s'ouvrir les veines, mais vaut mieux jamais le dire
Et bien souvent, la peine rappelle de belles mélodies
Les souvenirs qu'on aime et qui pêle-mêle, se mêlent au disque
Et même mes ennemis s'en apercevront

On l'accompagne le cœur gros pour son départ carcéral
Soudé avec mes queurs-cro, on s'tape des barres car c'est rare
Les gars de l'équipe voyagent dans toutes sortes d’embarcations
Paye plus par cash que par carte, vêtu d'une parka sombre
Grandir sans démarcation, éduqué par Cassel dans La Haine
D'humeur cassante, face aux manoeuvres des marcassins
Trop de regards glaçants, sur scène tu remarques la synchro
S-Croums, des reufs pas des zinc', donc on débarque à cinq, kho

Dans la lumière aussi, sans concessions

Hoping that you'll hear me and you'll save me from my shame

I shall live forever

The shelter of your wings

Than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
But wholly trust in Jesus' Name.

All other ground is sinking sand;
All other ground is sinking sand.

When darkness seems to hide His face,
I rest on His unchanging grace.
In every high and stormy gale,
My anchor holds within the veil.

His oath, His covenant, His blood,
Support me in the whelming flood.
When all around my soul gives way,
He then is all my Hope and Stay.

When He shall come with trumpet sound,
Oh may I then in Him be found.
Dressed in His righteousness alone,
Faultless to stand before the throne.

He'll give you life abundantly

The Lord will calm the sea
So whatever you have
The Lord has so much more
So what do you have to give

Oh if you were like me
You didn't have a lot of gold
Position or money
You didn't own wealth untold
But I'm glad He didn't look on the things that I had
But he looked and gave me all, all that I need

Oh for in return He gave me joy
That could never be told
And in return He gave me love
That was more precious, more precious than gold
In return of a torn life
He gave me life abundantly
And in return of a raging storm
The Lord will calm the sea
So what do you have to give ",In Return,1996
Crystal Lewis,"Who is he?
Who's the mightiest of all?
Who is he?
Creation trembles at his call.
Who is he?
The lowly sacrifice.
Who paid a victim's price,
His name is Jesus.

Jesus, from the father's own right hand.
Jesus, son of God and son of man.
Jesus, who died and rose again.
Jesus, he's the lion and the lamb.

Who is he?
With the power none can tame.
Who is he?
That every foe would fear his name.
Who is he?
Who was humbly led away,
to suffer that dark day?
His name is Jesus.

He's the lion and the lamb.

He's the lamb that was slain.
He's the lion that reigns.

There's a song, sets me free
Like a rhythm over me

There's a chain, a chain of voices
Looking for a harmony
There's a sound like a trumpet
Blowing out across the sea

There's a beat from the center of the wind
With the heat from the keeper of the flame
There's a breath moving sweetly
Like a rhythm over me

With the pack nippin' at your heels
Would you spring into action for the final push
Or stop for a rest on the field.

Fall in sin and be left behind
Or dig down deep for the will to compete
And hear the Father say, Well done as you cross that finish line you'd better

You'd better Jump! Just do it!!

As you freeze at the window sill.
Would you leap to your rescue waiting down below

Well, this is my advice on what you should do
Cast it on Jesus because He knows
Like before we know
How our lives should go
So don't worry be happy just like the song
There's always joy at the end of a storm
Be reborn into Jesus and expect a squeeze
But the battles like fought down on your knees
So would you please

You gotta walk by faith and not by sight
From dusk to dawn your name will be exalted

Crystal Lewis,"Complacency can kill as a liar and a thief 
Whisp'ring thoughts of nagging 
Tomorrow's just beyond my reach 
It's ever always subtleties seem harmless for the moment 
It's venom is most bitter every time I give in 
Complacency is danger in its purest form 
It talks me into things to which I would otherwise conform 
Given my ability to give in to the easy way 
No wonder why my spirit hates my flesh 

Tomorrow is much easier to deal with than today 
But when tomorrow comes I still don't wanna change 
Why am I willing to replace a wealth of wonder 
With a life of sure uncertainty 
Tomorrow may not ever even be 

How can I combat a complacent state of mind 
I need a constant reminder of the wrong and wasted time 
I need to train my heart in ways of seeing heaven as my home 
I need to take the power given as my own 

Tomorrow is much easier to deal with than today 
But when tomorrow comes I still don't wanna change

I was so fragile 
By myself not worth that much

I found faith enough for flying 
And an endless source of freedom 
For my wings 

fearless in the face of danger 
Fearless though sometimes a stranger 
I'm not afraid to tell you what I found 
I'm fearless all around 

I am not ashamed 
I am satisfied 
For to me to die is gain 
And to live is Christ 

I am not afraid 
I am not alone 
For my hope is held in this 
My God is in control 

though the wind is cold and biting 
I can see the sun is shining 
Though the clouds bring rain for ruin 
I see clear sky 

yet amidst my fear of dying 
I've found faith enough of flying 
And an endless source of freedom 
For my wings 

so I fan to flame a fire 
The gift of God now my desire 
And I watch the word inspire

And every mother's child is gonna spy

Really know how to fly

Jackie had a dad who didn't have Jesus
He had no hope, no reason to live
One day she told him of the peace He brings us
The freedom God so freely gives

For fifteen years, eight of those were Jackie's
He wouldn't hear and he wouldn't see
Then before he died he asked Jackie
Who's this man who'll set me free?

ooh little Jackie...ooh little Jackie

He's the man who gave His life for me
Not just a man, in fact a King
The blind see His mercy, the deaf hear His voice

I know Him she said, and He wants to know you

Jackie saw her dad go home to see Jesus
Now she watches a dying world
So much in need of hope and of rest
So much in need of the peace she knows

ooh little Jackie...ooh little Jackie

The world despises, the foolish reign
They mock the Word of God we live
Even though they love to hate Him
He loves them so...that's who Jesus is

That fountain in his day;

Wash all my sins away
Wash all my sins away
Wash all my sins away;

And there may I, tho' vile as he,
Wash all my sins away.
E'er since, by faith, I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply,

Crystal Lewis,"So many different religions
And so many different churches
And if God really loves me
Then why does life keep hurting me?
Have you ever asked any of these questions?
Well my friend I've got the answer just listen

You have the power
To make the seasons change
The river flows for you
The wind whispers Your name
For me you left Your throne
And traded crown for thorns instead
I'm safe within not by Your skin
But because Your blood was red

Some say You're black, you're white
They question if you're real
We treat you like we treat ourselves
I wonder how you feel
To see your children fight in spite
of the tears for us you've shed
Doesn't matter what color you are
As long as your blood was red

For it's strong enough to wash away my sins
And it's pure enough to cleanse me deep within
And it's real enough to find me when I'm lost
Great enough to die upon the cross
It doesn't matter what color you are
As long as your blood was red

We may be different but
The God we serve's the same
Yet every Sunday we separate
And bring the Father pain
Your name is higher than any other
Yet You took my place instead
And now my sins are washed away
Because Your blood was red

For it's strong enough to wash away my sins
And it's pure enough to cleanse me deep within
And it's real enough to find me when I'm lost
Great enough to die upon the cross
It doesn't matter what color you are
As long as your blood was red

Oh precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Doesn't matter what color you are

Doesn't matter what color you are

Doesn't matter what color I am

Had dreams of living like a gypsy
Made a few friends
Fell head over for a delinquent, yeah

I guess a lot of things go down and up in smoke
I stayed up town, been dead broke
Made a living, paid my dues and rent
And started again

When it's all said and done, I want to say
I had a good ride, some good times and love someone
I might seem like I'm running but I'm solid as a rock

Wild child, I was seventeen
Born again when I heard Patsy sing
Just a little piece of a good thing
My evolution, my evolution

Heart broken by a green eyed jerk
Temporary glitch but it still works
Just another day in the life of
My evolution, my evolution
Goes on and on and on

I never could hold down your average nine to five
Wouldn't pour the decaf, couldn't stand the politics
I'd do it all again money don't make me who I am
Who I am

I wasn't blessed with much self discipline
Get out of line and I tend to step in
I'm no high maintenance
I'd give you the shirt off my back
I'd never hold back

When it's all said and done
I wanna say it was a good
Go a good try, I loved someone
Never found any gold at the end of any rainbow
But searching was so much fun

Wild child, I was twenty three born again
When I heard Aretha sing
Just a little piece of a good thing
My evolution, my evolution

Heart stolen by a blue eyed punk
Respect is still
One of my favorite songs
Just another day in the life of my evolution.

We all get stuck, tough love, baby

As I remember I tremble from the strain
Forever your love'll be locked in my brain

I'm taking your heart, so don't you fight

Let them not weep, let them know that I'm glad to go

With the last breath of my heart I'll be blessing you

Waiting for someone to find him out

Hard to tell fear from happiness

To be one of the hive

Chorus

I am a truthful man from this land of palm trees
Before dying I want to share these poems of my soul
My verses are light green
But they are also flaming red

(the next verse says,)
I cultivate a rose in June and in January
For the sincere friend who gives me his hand
And for the cruel one who would tear out this
heart with which I live
I do not cultivate thistles nor nettles
I cultivate a white rose

Cultivo la rosa blanca
En junio como en enero
Qultivo la rosa blanca
En junio como en enero
Para el amigo sincero
Que me da su mano franca

Chorus

Y para el cruel que me arranca
El corazon con que vivo
Y para el cruel que me arranca
El corazon con que vivo
Cardo ni ortiga cultivo
Cultivo la rosa blanca

Chorus

Con los pobres de la tierra
Quiero yo mi suerte echar
Con los pobres de la tierra
Quiero yo mi suerte echar
El arroyo de la sierra
Me complace mas que el mar

Cuba L.A.,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Amor, amor que malo eres
Quien iba a imaginar que una mentira
Tuviera cabida en un madrigal

No quieres saber quien soy
Despues de darte lo que tienes
Ahora para ti soy vagabundo

Por haber querido tanto
Es mi desesperacion
La vaz del corazon llegara
A tu conciencia como una maldicion

Un dia calleron en la humillacion, en la humillacion

Y no te puedo hallar

And Pun's got a big nine, respect crime but not when it reflect mine
The shit I'm on is wrong but it lasts long
Pull a fast one, then Pun'll wake up, with the stash gone
I'm mad strong, and my cream is fast
Smoke the greenest grass, my bitch got the meanest ass
And a taste legit, I don't have to waste a whole case of Crist'
All it takes is my pretty face and my gangsta wit
Lace the click, cause we all share
It's all fair like love and war, thug galore with the long hair
Big Pun, Pun the name that makes the kids run
Like spelling murder reverse it deliver redrum
Come one, come all, if you wanna brawl
I'm the mighty Thor clothes lining motherfuckers like Steven Segall
Cause all you gonna get, is your ass kicked or up in a casket
That's it (that's it?) That's it

Punisher bash it, at last it's, rappers that really blast shit
Cats getting Big Willie niggas like Billy Bathgate
Up in Jimmy's Cafe, havin caviar
Crackin' Cristal at the bar, smokin' cigars, livin' large
We rob and steal, run with the mob, doin' jobs for bills

I can tell you lots of things that'll make you believe

Your career's on life support, and I'ma pull the plug
And have every thug shootin' that Beatnut drug
In they blood, no escapin 'this
Niggas is goin' over their favorite shit (for what?) 
To be tapin' this
World premier, loud and clear
Lye and beer, get the dough, blow up the show
Dissapear, jump in the Cavalier
Feelin' marvelous, street pharmacist, twist arboles
For pleasure, bring your territory sever
Keep my workers under pressure got em sayin' ""fuck Lester""
But that's aight Duke-o, my heart nowadays too cold
Don't give a fuck where you been what you done
Where you go, you know, peep this favorite
In black shades like a secret, agent
We're night thieves, roll up on you sleeves
We light trees, bust these and stack cheese

Lose the ice, 100 mil kid, money, money, money, mo
Platinum status, yeah, what up, what up?
(Big Punisher) Stick around

Yo, I plan to live a life a-glamour
Like my man Tony Montana
Stand and pose in front of cameras
With my golden silk pajamas on
Smoking havanas, drinking Don P
Thinking beyond deeper than Ghandi, while I'm in the Diamante
Counting my G's, I'm out to be a millionaire
Dipped in gear, flickin' hundred dollar bills in the air
Oh yeah, Cuban Link is into getting benjamins
'Cause if doesn't make dollars, then it doesn't make sense
I represent, I'm in to be the king of New York
Went from living in tenements to up in house resorts
I'm the latino, that'll take you to war like Al Pacino
Even De Niro know not to gamble in my casino
Vino wanna rock, slaps, to dinners with mobsters
I got shit locked from Prospect Ave. to the tropics
Sitting on top of the world like the sun
A living legend from the Bronx, second to none, unless it's Pun

[Chorus]
It's the glamour life, blow up the kids and the wife
Players who ain't half as nice swear to, but they sacrifice
Bottle the rock, freeze the ice, stash the dope and rice
And get ready for the glamour life

Ripped off from the Infiniti
Dump the body an' the shottie down the lake, leaving no identity
Just the memory, a casualty as I casually make move on my rivalries
All eyes I be, on the quest for loot
Pushing a Lexus coupe, to pursuit them troops, against the big-joker
Sipping alimoca, playing poker with some chocha
Heard an approacher, must be fam', but damn I had to smoke Pun
(Get the motherfucking gun)
Since ? become the one wanted for a lump sum of G's
Dirty rats pack gats for cheese
Bullets of breeze at light speed
Taking your pretty wife life and sacrificing your seeds
Indeed, we let him bleed for 50 G's
Ship his body to the states, filled with 50 keys
Please, no remorse for your two face
Inside a symbol, my life throughout the motherfucking suitcase
You about to take who's place? Not Seis
Your body'll be laced, and left without a trace

The glamour life, the glamour life, yo

[Chorus]

Yo, It's the motherfucking Don Cartagena
The leader, Terror Squad cleaner
Leave your family crying for you like Argentina, mira
Sweet dreamer like Nas, my entourage is thick
Camouflaging this bitch, so God forbid you start some shit
My squad's equipped with an arsenal of ammunition
Hollow tips an', cop killers with the ?
Accounts in Switzerland for rainy days
Nigga I'm staying paid, you's a joke
Always broke with your lazy ways
Anyway, back to the subject, in the bub-Lex
In the back seat, having rough sex
I love this glamorous life I live, having the ice and shit
Think twice, I give Christ your kids
I live life for gifts, keep the five burning while the tires turning
I blaze an L and seek a higher learning
Kaiser's learnin' everything illegally
We could de friend for years, cross me once that's theivity 

[Chorus]

Yo, the dough, the rap, the audience, party heavy till the 40's in
Ill like the Yakuza run the Orient
Take all the rent, and no man wept the path his daughter went
Dicks with the fallopian, wide as auditorium
She fuck for dough for opium, prostitute emporium
500 Benz, 500 friends sell Cambodian
8's cup of vodka, four cup of juice for sodium
Money, money, sweet as the smell of magnolia
It's get you down, but you spitting image of Appalonia
Now how can I go broke, pumping twenties of coke
Plus songs I wrote, milkin' dumb honeys I poke
The young blood sat on the bench in Vant Courtland, slingin'
Singing how he trying to get cash for Jordans
Another cat toss his Beamer to get the insurance
Currency's gonna murder me, it's never enough
Breakin' my ass gettin' it, just as fast as I spend the stuff
Calling Uncle Sam's bluff dun, taxes don't bite us, bite us

My life
My life

The glamour life, play precise, defense is tight
I'm out to settle the score, let's do it right
Enough for looking at grave, It's paying back tonight
Yo Twin pass the lah, pass the light
The glamour life, this life I live is trife as shit
Least my wife and kid got somewhere nice to live
I used to live in the gutter, me and my mother
Now she's fifty years old, pushing a hummer
The glamour life, hand me a knife I'll slice and dice 
Mini-mize, send them to Christ in the after life
Pass the mic down the line, let them hear it 
Let them fear it, send it screaming to the Holy Spirit

New World Order, I only flow wit the real horror
Chrome C4 to ya door and Pearl Harbor
We can bring it back, gats on the holsters of mini macs
Gats on the holsters strapped to the shoulders of maniacs
Where we at the projects, why don't you get the closet
Ahh, shit killa clacks, could've brought back ya prostate

Buyacka got bullets big enough to move ya car
Land cruisers 18 wheelers we do it tied
Just let it happen, I prefer violence instead of rappin'
Fuckin' wit this Latin assassin, better get ya head examined
My shit be slammin' like Onyx and Wrestle Mania
You really want it, you philly blounted in Pennsylvania
I'm aimin' the mac right at ya hat, better watch ya back black
I ain't sayin' you wack but you's a copy cat

I'm like a Triple Threat
Double dare you to try to rip my neck
The way you click spit techs will leave you wet from dick to neck
I know you ain't forget the way you squad niggaz rep
Comin' at me from the sideline like you intend to step

I'm like a Triple Threat
Double dare you to try to rip my neck
The way you click spit techs will leave you wet from dick to neck
I know you ain't forget the way you squad niggaz rep
Comin' at me from the sideline like you intend to step

Yo, now who the fuck wanna battle this
You garbage pail rappers would get ya cabbage split
Got a habit of brandin' ammitur nigguz like cattle hips
So watch ya lips 'cause what you fuckin' is hazardous
Shut up and catch a clip, I roll wit more dogz than St. Lazorous
What happened is ya raps ain't accurate, you claim you packin' it
But when the action hits you rather switch into a faggot bitch
I'm hardcore, it's not my fault ya softer than cardboard
Ya started to battle so I'mma turn into the God four

Switch to southpaw like De La Hoya golden boy
I put it on you polaroid finish, left you as red as Sonya
I been a soulja all my life, fought for stripes all most saw the light
Talk to Christ, he told me that my songs so nice
And for the right price I might just body you
Chop ya ass into particles and read about you in newspaper articles
I'm sick and tired talkin' shit, got beef wit me then so be it
I'll rush you like the Soviet Union and leave you soakin' wet

I'm like a Triple Threat
Double dare you to try to rip my neck
The way you click spit techs will leave you wet from dick to neck
I know you ain't forget the way you squad niggaz rep
Comin' at me from the sideline like you intend to step

I'm like a Triple Threat
Double dare you to try to rip my neck

Cuban Link,"Man, what the fuck is we gone do, man?
Shit, man, I can't believe this shit, man
Them motherfuckers done killed him
We got to ride for this nigga
On them old hoe ass niggas
I say we ride over right there, right now
That's what I'm talking about, let's roll

As we delve through the mud and rain
Straight shots of tongue ease the pain
As we put to rest one of my niggas
That got cut up and lost half his brain
Shit, ain't the same niggas is dangerous
Buckin' like it's the thang to bust
When I looked at my nigga fucked up
I couldn't help thinking this could've been aimed for us

Niggas do hate like that, nigga, you never know
He say a friend but I smell foe
So I sit back and wait for the day niggas try to kick in my door
So I sleep with the big fo-fo
But what if I fuck up and pull it too slow
You know what they say, gotta go, gotta go
What if I be the one breathing no more, oh well
When I die I want all my motherfuckers to ride
(For me)

On the niggas that did me killed, me committed my homicide
Gather up after the funeral and pull out all the big guns
(Posse up)
Go through every hood poppin' till somebody tell you somethin'
How in the fuck can I rest in peace when I wasn't ready to die
So I'm begging my niggas to get my revenge
And do it the same night they put me under
Now I'm gone but this thug shit gone live on
Just write on my tombstone he was that thuggish ruggish bone

Murda mo, niggas, gone kill some more
(Nigga, you never know when you gone die)
Murda mo, niggas, gone kill some more
(Say never know when it could be you)

Murda mo, niggas, gone kill some more
(They leave yo house and don't come back)
Murda mo niggas gone kill some more
(This shit is real and oh, so true)

Murda mo, niggas, gone kill some more
(Nigga, you never know when you gone die)
Murda mo, niggas, gone kill some more
(Say never know when it could be you)

Murda mo, niggas, gone kill some more
(They leave yo house and don't come back)
Murda mo niggas gone kill some more
(This shit is real and oh, so true)

When I die I wanna see about a hundred niggas cryin'
Lying, talkin' 'bout they all love Ryan
And Joey too, you should've seen me at the funeral
Sporting the top hat tuxedo was royal blue murder who
Nigger, I died in the car chase shot
The place like the last scene in Scarface
Now I'm in the far place chillin' in the whites of the sky
Terror Squad till the day I die

I'ma thug, I'ma die high O.D. off the la-la
Niggas tell me get off that weed, I'ma keep smoking on that thai
Nigga, fuck that, I'ma keep hittin' that
(Puff puff)
Till my lung collapse, what's wrong with that?
You hypocrite, just a little bit you know you down with it

It's all good in your hood having laughs
Puff weed to clear my cataracts
Never thought I'd see the inside of an ambulance
But now I'm there too many dead brain cells
Runnin' 'round inside my head
That's when I died my eyes were blood shot red

Now picture me dead, still getting head in the coffin flossin'
Bitches fightin', cryin', tryin' to get a bigger portion
My niggas talkin', figuring how to get my fortune
While I'm lost in space waiting for Satan and his horseman
Walkin' through fire sparkin' my lighter cloud the sky up
Rising higher and higher, eye to eye with my messiah
Viya Con Dios as I cross the gates of hell
I faced the devil with a shovel and told him brace yourself

Reporters steady ask why KB be talkin' 'bout murder on all the songs
I say 'cause I could step out the door, somebody could pop and I'm gone
Then they wanna know why I pack chrome for one I'm paranoid
Smoking too much of that weed, what's that I just heard a noise
Get the 12 gauge and I call my boys
Motherfuckers is plottin' to get me, I know when I'm dreaming this
So that's the meaning of this

Nine millimeter heater strapped with infrared beams and shit
So nigga don't trip the reaper, seem to be getting closer
So I'm running from that motherfucker swervin' and duckin' murder
Pistol grip pump protected by the gauge
Mr Sawed-Off Leatherface reload the clip and into the crowd I spray
Murder murder, mo murder, murder, kill, kill, kill

Shit, it's selling but what they ain't telling niggas is that it's real
But you better realize for it be you in the casket dropped
Better get you ass a shotgun and go get a plastic glock
Nigga, don't take murder for no joke, that's like slittin' your own throat
But I tell you what'll help for sure is if you bust back at them hoes

Murda mo, niggas, gone kill some more
(Nigga, you never know when you gone die)
Murda mo, niggas, gone kill some more
(Say never know when it could be you)

Murda mo, niggas, gone kill some more

[Cuban Link] 
(verse one) 
Yeah, yo, bori, shorty's a naughty one, 
All she wants is a forty and a blunt, 
As naughty as a front, just to get the party crunk, 
So rump, shake and reggaeton, and some puerto rican rum, 
A thong and a pair of pumps to freak it when she's drunk, 
And it's done- I got it all recorded by the tons, 
Even caught it in her buns for the right amount of funds, 
She stunts just for the fun of it, her story's just to front- 
For the chumps, I'm the one who taught her how to hump, 
How to pump, how to bump 'n grind, no frontin from behind, 
How to become a dime, she had to be one of a kind, 
Now she's something fine, sweeter than Dunkin Hines, 
Try to pump your mind up to sign on the dotted line, 
And I ain't having it, she's only for the bagging it, 
And stabbing it, the broad seen more draws than a cabinet, 
To put a cap in it, she tapped the whole hood- 
Like any ho would, I tell ya, she no good 

(Chorus) 
Scandalous (2x), so bad for me (2x), 
Dile que voy a pensar que me puede matar el no verla aqui(no verla aqui), 
Scandalous(2x), I can't handle it(cant handle it), she's more than me(shes more than me), dile que voy a pensar que me pueden matar en no verla aqui (el no verla aqui)) x5 

(verse two) 
Yo god, you part of my fam, you my man, 
Understand nigga, handle this, 
The word in los angeles is she banging in sandwiches, 
I'm in and she ran the triz, she's taking a gang of dicks, 
Far from them amateurs, I start with a scandalous nature, 
Ain't nothing you can do about it, cause you already knew about it 
Before you even started, and you're still tryin to change her, 
I'll turn in your lawyer, goddess don't be modest, 
Whatever she wanted she got it, but she still went on and played ya, 
And now you want to pout about it, thought that she was bout it bout it, 
Gave her your heart, but she just wanted your paper, 
I told you you could do without it, you was just a fool who doubt it, 
But you went at it, don't worry about it, 

dile voy a pensar que me puede matar el no verla aqui, 
Jamas podria aguantar el que si ella se va( tenga que morir)x2 

(Chorus) 
Scandalous (2x), so bad for me (2x), 
Dile que voy a pensar que me puede matar el no verla aqui(no verla aqui), 
Scandalous(2x), I can't handle it(cant handle it), she's more than me(shes more than me), dile que voy a pensar que me pueden matar en no verla aqui (el no verla aqui))x5 

(verse three) 
I'm pretty sure I seen her face before, 
In a different place before, 
And it's not deja vu, 
Could have sworn that we blazed before, 
Back in the days on tour, 
Shorty I know you, 
Now I knew I seen her face before, 
She was that crazy broad, 
Who went and blazed the whole crew, 
I don't have to trace her face no more, 
I rest my case I'm sure, girl you know it's true

'Cause I'm be a player for life (cause I want you to be my sugar daddy)

Ah-yo excuse me miss, how do you do, you're probably used to this,
'Cause mami chula you're the bomb and your fuse is lit,
Me-I'm coola than the farms, cause I'm smooth and swift,
The type to pull up in to your prom in a brand new 6,

I'm old school, I use the charm to seduce the chicks,
You'll introduce me to ya moms as your future pick,
Your like benita applebalm, or some exclusive shit,
Waiting for you to put me on cause I refuse to quit,

And the truth is- you make a nigga lose his grip,
'Cause I just can't resist the way you move them hips,
The way you walk and you talk with them beautiful lips,
Got a New York train of thought, so you think you the shit,

A suitable fit, you even keep your cuticles ?clipped?,
Fully equipped, heavy duty boo, you truly a gift,
You a cuty with a mind, not a groupie or trick,
Rich in beauty cause you shine without jewelry and chips

[Chorus]
Papi, please be my sugar daddy,
I want you to rule my world,
Dry kisses that taste like candy,
Can I be your sugar girl,
Just put some ice on my pinky ring,
And fly me around the world,
I owe it to papi, I need my sugar daddy,
And I'll be your sugar girl

Yeah yo yo,
Mami you sweet like licorice, deep and articulate,
Baby you look delicious from your feet to your fingertips,
Unique and conspicuous, plus your body's ridiculous,

Make me want to lick my lips and lick you where you ticklish,
Picture this- Lamborghini's, mansions and yachts, 
Trips to Tahiti instead of standing on the block,
Baby I can be your genie man and grant you them rocks,

Ice up your watch, and freeze the hands on your glock,
We can dance till we drop, in the sands of the trops,
Romance is so hot-you'll catch a tan on the spot,
Anxious to shop, I just hand you a knot,

And make you say (ain't no nigga like the one I got)

[Chorus]

Yo, now baby I'm a thug, plus a player by blood,
But we can lay in the tub, play with the bubbles while I'm rubbing ya butt,
Hugging you tight, like I'm cuffing the mic, loving you right,
So light up the candlelights, because we crushing tonight,

It's such a sight- touch you where you like it, hush and feel the tight grip,
'Cause I'm the type of private dancer that'll work the nightshift,
This kid will make you scream my name out, to let the pain out,
Once I hopped in the train I never came out,

The same wild individual from the playhouse,
Who stayed out all day at the bar, till' they said â??get outâ??,
I'm straight out the player's club,
Rocking gators with leather gloves,

Tailor-made tux showing the ladies love,
I'm way above average, I know you love Paris,
But we can ride our horse and carriage through the bronx traffic,
24 Karats Cuban Link, I do my thing, (I want you to be my sugar daddy)
You can bring it if you think you can hang, I bang bang baby

Damn, it can't get no worse than this cause I done hit rock bottom

I'm goin' in circles man, goin' in circles man
Sometimes I feel like, feel like I'm goin' in circles man

Damn, if you a man put some muthafuckin' food on the table
That's what she said but still a nigga wasn't able
To get up some bread for the rent, lights, and cable
The gas and water
She actin like I'm tryna starve her
And I know the baby growin' and her belly gotta eat too
Only thing I got left is this gun on my belt, If I can't feed myself how I'mma feed you?
How I'mma ride with this tank on empty, sellin yola hoping that the jakes dont get me
Cause when I leave the crib man that thang go wit' me
My nigga from the jets got stained for a 50
Sack of the hard
Tryna match you a broad
Got 'em shot up in his car by a muthafuckin' dope fiend
A bitch tryna get a fix, put my nigga in a ditch, we been hittin them licks since we was 14
Now they say you in a calmer place
I couldn't tell by the looks on yo' momma face
Now everytime she look at me I see a look of disgrace
She disappointed by the dreams we was lookin' to chase
Cause we was cookin' the base and we was flippin' the spinach
And if a nigga violated then we handled our business
We never knew one day the street shit would catch up with us
And I don't roll with many niggas, you was one of the realest
I'm like

Damn, open my mailbox and all I get to see is bill after bill
Shit kinda slow ain't no real money be comin' in but yo, I still got ten on the kil'
Ten on the drank, a nigga be on ten when I'm sober to get me over keep me full of the poison
My nigga Rich doin' a bid they sent the boys in, to get him if I would've been wit' him I woulda joined him
And now I'm out here lurkin' the streets wit' no work feelin' like my throat been cut wit' no plug
You know just what I mean if you ever done sold drugs, finna rob me a nigga cause I ain't got no love
And I ain't got no qualification for no career move, people up in corporate america probably fear dude
Gettin' shine off of my rhyme for like a year or two, still got the police lights up in my rearview
Damn, as I sit behind a tint, in a car full of smoke
Hopin' this officer don't do nothin' to make me have to hurt him cause it's over if I get caught up with this dope
Give me a coal, might aswell hang me from a rope
Cause the government lynchin' niggas more than ever before
Sort of like the slavery days but if we ? the change, then how the fuck is we supposed to grow?

Y esa zona que te quiero morder
Sabes que me vuelves loco
Con tus gritos y tus arañazos de mujer

Y dibujas patrones sobre mí
Y la manera que amas
Entre llamas y me consumo pero ya lo viví

Alrededor de este mundo
Anda entre muchos placeres
Anda entre muchos placeres
Pero no es suyo ninguno

Soy como pájaro en jaula
Preso y hundido en tu amor
Y aunque la jaula sea de oro
Y aunque la jaula sea de oro
No deja de ser prisión

Háblenme montes y valles
Grítenme piedras del campo
Cuándo habían visto en la vida
Querer como estoy queriendo
Llorar como estoy llorando
Morir como estoy muriendo

A veces me siento un sol
Y el mundo me importa nada
Luego despierto y me río
Luego despierto y me río
Soy mucho menos que nada

En fin soy en este mundo
Como la pluma en el aire
Sin rumbo voy por la vida
Sin rumbo voy por la vida
Y de eso tu eres culpable

Háblenme montes y valles",Gritenme Piedras del Campo,1995
Cuco Sánchez,"Guitarras lloren guitarras
Violines lloren igual
No dejen que yo me valla
Con el silencio de su cantar

Gritemos a pecho abierto
Un canto q haga temblar
Al mundo q se le q sean purto
Donde unos llegan y otros se van

Ahora me toca a mi dejarlas
Ahora me toca a mi marchar
Guitarras lloren gutarras","Guitarras, Lloren Guitarras",1995
Cuco Sánchez,"Mientras haya vida en este mundo
Mientras Dios nos dé la luz del día
Mientras haya amor en esta vida
Te amaré, vida mía

Mientras haya pájaros que canten
al rayar la aurora en cada día
Mientras den perfume las gardenias
Te amaré, vida mía

Y verás, que serás
lo que nadie en mi vida antes fué
porque tú para mí
eres mi alma mi amor y mi fé

Mientras haya la última esperanza
y haya ser que goce esa alegría
mientras haya música en mi alma
Te amaré, vida mía

Mientras pueda respirar el aire
mientras corra sangre por mis venas
mientras mi cerebro tenga vida
Te amaré vida mía",Te Amare Vida Mia,1995
Cuco Sánchez,"Te acuerdas cuando eramos felices?
Que nada en este mundo nos podia separar
Te acuerdas que nos quisimos tanto?
Que cada beso nuestro al cielo iba a parar

Mas tarde no se por que te fuiste
Después por todo el mundo feliz ibas pasando
No!!, ya no me quiero acordar
Hasta el rezo que es de Dios me sabe amargo

Lograste hundir hasta el final
Y estoy hasta onde ya, ya no se puede
Jugué mi vida y la perdí
Maldito sea tu amor que aún que hiere

Ahora te atreves a pedirme
Que pase el trago amargo de mirarnos las caras
No!! no se te ocurra volver
Porque si te vuelvo a ver
Te parto, te parto el alma",Te Parto el Alma,1995
