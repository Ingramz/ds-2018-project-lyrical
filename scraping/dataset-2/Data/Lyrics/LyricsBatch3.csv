A-P,"J'porte pas d'gants car j'compte laisser mes empreintes
Depuis l'époque des freestyle racailles j'descends la pente sans frein
Enfreins les lois de manière discrète
Pendant qu'certains cherchent à monter leurs buzz
Où complotent sur l'net
Mon flow t'laisse un goût amer, j'reste sincère
Pour t'faire du mal pas besoin d'jurer sur la vie d'ma mère
L'intelligence s'mesure pas au temps passé à l'école
Parce que la vie est hardcore, j'suis sans gêne et sans remords
Originaire des dom-toms, j'suis v'nu marquer mon territoire
J'crie jamais victoire, c'est qu'le début d'l'histoire
A travers mes récits, j'rappe comme j'parle mec de Vitry
J'écris toujours pour les braves
J'rappe pour le nord, sud, est, ouest
Les jeunes se reconnaissent
S'entraîne la pièce maîtresse
Les mecs sont habitués à crosser aux gros seins au procès
Les pages sont plus légères que nos casier
J'suis un black solide à la Joe Frase
On a l'vécu et l'phrasé
Profites-en avant qu'ils rasent nos cités
Envers nous l'état a des dettes
J'marche pas la tête baissée comme dit Kerry relève la tête
Pour l'district ma horde sauvage
On a nos codes nos manies et notre langage
Code 94400 Vitry
Ici c'est que l'intro, l'album c'est un micro Uzi",Intro,2009
A-P,"Refrain
Je suis libre,
Et quoiqu'ils disent personne m'empêchera de vivre,
Ça c'est pour les gens comme toi, Hey, Hey,
Ça c'est pour les gens comme toi, Hey, Hey,
J’brille comme la capitale scintille, comme le boulevard Pigalle,
Toujours aussi radical, toujours en finale, toujours on fait mal,
Toujours dans l'pénal, en cavale, A.P, j'suis libre comme Betancourt
Ma musique c'est des coups de tambours,
J'ai grandi ma p'tite, ton soutif faut qu'tu l'rembourres,
C'qu'on a commencé faut qu'on l'termine,
J'arrive avec ma vermine,
Imagine-nous en berline, destination les Bermudes,
J'viens des îles ravagées par le crack,
J'ai grandi où regarde mes plaques, 9.4,
On disparaît comme par magie,
J'suis un black, une black machine
Ma vie est faite de suspens et de moments tragiques,
La vie c'est dur, du Nord au Sud, OK,
Un séjour s'impose, un bouquet plein de bouts de rockets,
Les beaux jours s'arrosent, par une partie de poker,
On reste libre, tant qu'on perd pas nos repères.
Refrain X2
Rien à foutre de la crise, moi moi j'suis libre,
La liberté n'a pas de prix,
Pourquoi veux-tu que j'me prive ?
J'habite de l'autre côté d'la street,
De l'autre côté d'la rive,
J'suis dans ma matrix comme Keanu Reeves
J’suis pire, tu m'vois pas normal,
J'ai teinté les vitres,
J’suis speed, gros j’gamberge vite
Juste le fait de voir la daronne,
J'me sens libre, j'ai qu'une parole,
Entre le bien, le mal, je slalome,
J'gravis les étapes, une à une,
J'ai commencé par le troc, parce que j'avais pas de tunes,
La vie c'est dure,
J'souris même quand j'ai des points de suture,
C'est de nature, quand le coeur a des fractures,
Ou qu'le cerveau sature,
J'suis libre, sur mon album,
J'me livre, j'suis sur l'front,
J'prends des risques, mais mais j'résiste,
1-1-3 ma clique
Floqué son drapeau,
Si t'es libre comme moi, lève le bras bien haut !
Refrain
Qu’tu sois libre ou libéral
Peut-être immeuble vertical
Que tu viennes d’en bas ou des quartiers hauts
Qu’tu sois libre ou libéral
Lève ta main, serre le point bien haut
Ouais lève le bien
Refrain",Je Suis Libre,2009
A-P,"Parlé : vos messages aujourd’hui à 17h29 :
Hesbo ah ouais gros c’est Habeb ben vas-y rappelle-moi
faut qu’on s’capte ce soir sur Paris !
Ok frérot vas-y Ciao !
Quand le soleil se couche et fait place à la lune,
Le bon citoyen s’couche, évite le monde de la nuit
Et quand le jour éclaire la ville, le bandit s’couche
S’il savait, il aurait pu y laisser sa vie
Quand j’bouge la nuit, c’est l’euphorie
Démarre la charrette, roule en bolide
Fait chauffer le moteur le temps que j’me roule un joint de weed
La nuit les mauvais esprits se rencontrent
On rentre tous dans le même circuit sans s’rendre compte
Abassi prend 1ère à droite, j’ai 2/3 mecs à voir à Place d’Aligre
D’vant le café d’Omar dans l’obscurité un tox m’aguiche
J’ai plus rien à vendre j’me suis recyclé dans les ventes de disques
1 heure du mat, 22, 22 contrôle de routine
Bonsoir messieurs, encore un corrompu, un frère des îles
J’repare en balle Châtelet, Rivoli m’voilà sur les Champs
J’suis venu m’rincer l’oeil en tant que touriste qu’avant
Hé gros, j’suis garé en planque devant la banque
Parlé : J’enquille la A86 j’serais là avant 1h30
La nuit vite fait tu t’fais entourer
Méfie-toi du bon citoyen, il peut être mauvais, refrè
Refrain :
La nuit les rues sombres sont laissées aux bandits
Hé c’est la nuit que les billets fatchs passent le mieux
Hé prostitution, armes, fausse monnaie
On fait nos tunes, baise des broutilles
Vitry nocturne
La nuit les rues sombres sont laissées aux bandits
C’est la nuit que ton poto Bess taffe le mieux
Hé trahison, complots, extorsion de fonds
J’vends pas d’carte postale aux poulets d’la tour Eiffel
Cache les s’beu
Au fond du canal de l’Ourcq y’a des yoop pas réglos
La police rattrape la violence par les couilles
On démarre au pont Bondy dans l’Audi
On est pauvre, on est off, on est beau pour chasser d’la chatte
Place Charles de Gaulle

Sur la RN3, tu verras du sang sur le sol
C’est pas d’la violence gratuite PD c’est les soldes
Y’a un taxi baskets à Sevran, ça s’péfra aux Bosquets
Ça défroit les 3 keus
J’dépose un pote à Rosny2 pour un film
Récupérer une plaque 76, 93 est trop cramé par les schmidts
J’attache ma tasspé d’my space, GRT… m’a pris en masqué
Parlé : Hé donne ta position poto
J’suis à porte de la Chapelle,
Et là y’a un chlat qui se fait chlaté
Une main qu’a l’Banner
Récupère leur oseille, direct dans le pool des tapazs
La nuit les juifs sont au top,
les mecs s’affichent dans les nights clubs
Les rebeus d’la pègre récupèrent des enveloppes
Refrain
2h l’heure tourne sur l’cadran
Y’en a qui dérapent dans la vie ou freinent du frein avant
Le marché parallèle fait tourner le marché porte de Clicli
Vendeurs de came s’font dorer la pilule à Complipi
On continue la ballade
3 h : Le monde de la night
Sale temps pour un portier, suffit d’une balle
Un client névrosé,
Un coup d’féraille à la ceinture abdominale
La night, quand tu parles de maille,
Tu parles de mal entre banlieusards
Nos regards s’enregistrent, les tunes tournent
Comme une chatte dans un club échangiste
Les nuits et les rues parisiennes sont malsaines
J’passe le salem aux équipes de nuit
D’Evry et Montfermeil,
J’attends d’la Tour Montparnasse
On est les bêtes noires des grands axes éclairés
Et d’leur gros Palaces
C’est le mot d’la fin rue d’la santé
Parloir sauvage c’est pour mes frères pris en otage
Refrain",La Nuit,2009
A-P,"J’ai passé tous les crashs test, j’encaisse
Roue de secours, l’aiguille vire au rouge
Mais j’garde quand même le sourire
J’encaisse roue de secours, si tu m’crois j’te dirais gros
J’suis pas un américain d’gangster, ni un Hussler
J’sors du ventre de ma mère et j’ai grandi sans père
J’suis ni un cocaïnomane, aucune overdose
La frime j’laisse ça aux autres
J’rappe que pour la bonne cause
Desserre moi les noeuds, j’suis un révolutionnaire
J’suis la voix du peuple et d’l’économie souterraine
J’fais un cours de frappe
Et verse une larme aux frères qui sont partis
Une pensée aux familles de Villiers et d’Clichy
Comme HAMZA j’milite pour la Palestine
Fuck la NASA, j’suis avec mes frères d’anti
94400 union d’faire des sous aux comicos
On garde le silence ou on les insulte
Arrête de pleurer sur ton sort on n’a pas tous le même parcours
Combien vivent face à la mort sans issue de secours
Le pouvoir d’achat baisse et la violence augmente
Les gens caisse veulent nous voir à genoux avec rien dans le ventre
Refrain
Et puis j’ai fait mon trou sans appeler au secours
Le tour de la France, j’l’ai fait sur une roue d’secours
J’t’avoue j’ai pris des coups, j’en ai mis en retour
Vu qu’la vie est courte j’accélère mon parcours
X2
J’suis calciné le rap m’a grillé
Toujours 2/3 douilles dans l’barillet
Mon rap t'agresse et c’est la vérité
Moi j’ai les yeux ouverts frère sur la réalité
Centralise bien tes portes à chaque porte du périph
J'suis d'la banlieue proche au sud de Paris
J’suis pour aucun parti, ma voix ils l’auront pas
J’aime pas leur politique, dans ma tête c’est frénésie
Le label c’est Frenesik
La vie c’est un aller simple,
La mort ni tu l’esquives ni tu la feins
Me fais pas d'l'oeil, tu pues l’vice à plein nez
Porte tes couilles sur ton dos et va charbonner, Hé
J’arrive en roue arrière sur les autoroutes de France
J’suis venu récupérer mon gain après 5 vengeances
113, mon gang, mon clan, mon armée
J’dors tranquille, qui veut teste le Prince de la ville
Refrain
J’viens d’la ville où la plupart ont l’symptôme du braco
Comme dirait mon saint Jaco « Hé poto c’est carbo »
J’suis beur noir, ouais j’viens du ghetto
Hé gros j’suis comme toi, le vice j’l’ai compris trop tôt
Garde espoir te laisse pas abattre,
A chacun son heure de gloire, à chacun son retour de flamme
Accusé à la barre, la justice s’attarde sur les petites histoires
Laisse filer les bâtards
Moi j’suis tout terrain, j’mène une vie à part
Déjà en cours j’étais mis à l’écart
Mon rap sent la poudre des canons d’Afrique
Mafia africaine pour la cause on milite
Peu importe tes origines, t’inquiète j’roule avec toi
Peu importe d’où tu viens du moment qu’tu m’trahis pas
Tête brûlée, j’suis d’la mauvaise graine, une vraie pourriture
J’suis un pur produit d’ma ville pas une caricature
Refrain",Roue de Secours,2009
A-P,"Hey, hey, viens voir toi
Qui, moi ?
Non l’autre d’à côté, vas-y viens là toi
Couplet (Dry) :
Tempérament 9.4, les saules, là où le sol tremble
Où silencieux se joue les gammes, nos vies sont à vendre
Nos âmes en sursis, ça chiffre près des terrains vagues
L’amour du risque, compte le biff, dans les caravanes
Opère au 11.43, deux roues, cagoulés
Rafales sur un drive by, même sur les champs allumés
Poussent les forces de l’ordre à bout
Le système, on le met à genou
Drogue, traque l’oseille, jamais ne veille
Et le rho lui nous tient debout
SAMP 3287
Tempérament un peu violent
Rends-moi les gênes de Brazza
Le soleil rend insolent
Une massa qui clope la frappe
Fuck ton classa, y’a rien que des anti-brassards
Qu’ont connu que la hass la
Négro, des fois le tempérament meurtrier trop grillé
Met les nerfs à bout
J’ai peur de tirer, surtout de les faire crier
C’est genre triade, mon style vient du Val-de-Marne
Y’a plus d’amour dans les querelles
Juste un goût pour les âmes
Refrain :
Tempéraments, tempéraments nonchalants, souvent violents, violents
Mais dérangeants, putain d’talent, putain d’talent
Pètent des talons, pètent des talons,
Frères au ballon, représentants
Tempéraments, des mecs comme nous, t’en vois rarement
(2 fois)
Couplet (OGB) :
Tempéraments de dingue, j’tempère
Sinon j’massacre j’en perds
De vue mes zincs pour m’taire
Y’a qu’la salade j’ramène
9.4 leur scène ressent
Le son j’t’enseigne tu sens
Le sang d’l’oseille, c’est juste
Le son qu’on sème élargi possibilité d’y croire
Business trop restreint
Tu peux rêver tout seul d’gérer le boulevard
Mais pleure tes défunts
Cagoule, mallette, déter, brolik
T’as choisis d’être teug
Poucave ta gueule ouverte pour rien
T’as choisis les teuh…
Pour l’instant t’as stocké, planqué, associé
T’as croisé, crossé, recherché, t’as osé, osé
Cherché à te poser, poser
Ta vie explosée, plosée
Va te faire arroser, roser
T’as voulu t’imposer, poser
Miser, miser, causer, causer du tort
Aux autres de la vie tu connais quoi ?
Tu fuck la vie d’tes potes
Et ton meilleure ami c’est toi
D’en bas de la poste j’observe ce qui se passe
En tou cha voix le manque
De ahhh y’a trop de mecs touchas
(Refrain)
Couplet (AP) :
Tempérament, Vitry 9.4, casse bélier
Ceux qui partent au casse-pipe ou trafiquent pour de la monnaie
Les chiens de la casse on les connaît
Pour les poucaves 1.3.5.7 chromé
De caractère dur j’ai les plombs qu’ont cramé
Instinct de chacal normal, j’ai la couleur de la misère
Mais combien d’nos frères et soeurs s’font bloquer à la frontière
Tempérament, t’empoches 9.3 un doigt sur la drapeau tricolore
Sur l’avenue, on fait crier les Raptors
Tests de juges et leurs lois, tempérament hors-la-loi
Pour ceux qui tournent en promenade et qui font les cent pas
Tempérament, ramoneur, charboneur
J’suis de l’époque de Ramon Dekker
Crois pas que je me suis ramolli
Dans le rap y’a trop d’amateurs
J’ai mis du sucre dans leurs moteurs
Pendant que mon flow prend de l’ampleur
J’me fais rare comme Naceri, un killer
Refais le monde et y’a des choses sur lesquelles on n’est pas d’accord
On est trop nerveux, tempérament gladiator
(Refrain)",Temperaments,2009
A-P,"Tout peut basculer (3 fois)
Couplet 1 :
L’histoire commence sur le périph’ par une course poursuite
Deux jeunes cagoulés à grande vitesse dans une berline
Ils s’font flasher merlisch, jettent un sac du côté passager
La vie de voyou blairling passe de la première à la dernière ligne
Un coup de sang-froid, le chauffeur a dû s’faire une ligne, immatriculée en Belgique
Sur les lèvres du passager on peut lire :
Si on rejoint l’autoroute à 4 voies, on est libre
Sans clignotants nos deux malfrats zigzaguent entre les voitures
Pied au plancher, ils veulent pas se rendre, ça s’voit à leur allure
Ça s’entend aussi au bruit du moteur
Ne leur demande pas c’qu’ils ont à part
Sûrement les clés du bonheur
Refrain 2 fois :
Tout peut basculer d’une minute à l’autre
À toi d’être vif et réfléchir, c’est la course contre la montre
À l’échelle du monde on est des merdes
Y’en a qui crient famine et d’autres qui font la guerre pour un bout de terre
Couplet 2 :
Parfois on s’dit on a la poisse
Un pied dans la banque et j’suis bloqué dans le sas
J’ai posé ma candidature, on m’a dit y’avait plus de place
Tout peut basculer, à toi de faire face
C’est rare de voir un rescapé après un naufrage
Dans le quartier tout a basculé
La mort est venu faucher un jeune d’une balle perdue
L’histoire commence dans une atmosphère chaude et tendue
On veut venger sa mort car il y a eu un malentendu
Histoire de drogues dures, de terrain
C’est après qu’tu réfléchis aux conséquences quand tu perds un des tiens,
Voir sa famille pleurer, en deuil
Sache que l’argent sale rime souvent avec le mauvais oeil
Au bout un cercueil, des larmes, paix à son âme
Qui commettra la faute ? L’adrénaline monte
Dans ce milieu d’autant de vie est millimétré
Comme rouler sans casque sans la compère
Mais il te manque un mètre
(Refrain 2 fois)
Couplet 3 :
L’histoire commence en banlieue dans une salle de boxe
Un fils d’immigré à qui la vie n’a pas laissé d’chance
N’a qu’une idée en tête, s’en sortir à travers le sport
Vu que le monde du travail lui a fermé ses portes
Il évacue sa rage à travers le sac, gauche droite
Gauche, il veut prouver de quoi il est capable
Monter sur le ring ça l’excite, ça l’excite
Parfois un soupçon de peur, il a le coeur qui palpite
Aujourd’hui, c’est son premier combat,
Ses premiers contacts avec le ring
Son adversaire est juste là, le gong est donné
C’est le moment de vérité
Un uppercut bien placé et tout, et
(Refrain 2 fois)
Frère, à toi d’être vif, gros
Hey, tout peut basculer, hein tout peut basculer, gros
D’une minute à l’autre, frère",Tout Peut Basculer,2009
A-P,"Un conseil : investis
arrete les soirées festives
ils veulent nous voir en chien
dans une épaisse fumée nocive
déconseille aux petits frères d'aller voler
ca pas fait tant d'un homme d'avoir une rolex chromé
y'a des petites frappes et les gros bonnets
ceux qu'on de la morve aux nez
mais ont de la casse comme george clooney
y'a peu de money
les billets on aimerait les cloner
ceux qui jettent l'argent par les fenêtres
on aimerait les cogner
un bolide un frigo vide
pendant que tu fais de l'argent sale vite
pour payer ta zibolie
tu fais croire à tout le monde que l'argent c'est rien
tu dépenses sans compter tu crois tenir le monde entre tes mains
tu crois être malin
aveuglé par les chiffres pense à mettre à gauche vite fait
tu peux tomber dans le vice dans l'engrenage le vice du biff
tu me diras c'est donnant donnant
ici frérot rien n'est gratuit
que des crapules pour la petite coupure te torturent
combien vont bruler leur oseille sur la côte d'azur
grossiste ou cadre supérieur bête du sur le moteur
petite liasse dans la poche plus de cinéma qu'un acteur
amateur flambeur de billets
investis dans ton bled ou dans l'immobilier
t'es grillé l'oseille t'a calciné le cerveau
avant les gens disaient de toi que t'étais un cerveau


Refrain :
Tu veux du zeille zeille ?
vas y garde tes conseils
c'est pas en faisant la barre de fer
qu'on les conserve
tu veux du zeille zeille ?
le tout dernier bolide est à zeb
j'connais des mecs qui s'vont pas priver
pour te la mettre
le fric fait touner la tête
y'a ceux qui s'enrichissent et ceux qui s'endettent
certains sont prêt à trahir mais qu'est ce que tu fais de ton zeille frère
si t'es atteint d'une grave maladie
mets la famille à l'abri et rapide
quand ça rentre tu dépenses
c'est la loi du liquide
certains sont prêts à tout
c'est peut etre ton dernier coup
t'as une chance sur 1000
de suivre ton numéro d'écrou
on rêve tous du coup à refaire
vider le coffre faire le casse du siècle
si t'es honnête ou fais pleurer le tiroir-caisse
mets de coté pour pas finir en feux de détresse
on vit à une époque où pour du fric on peut t'éliminer
un jour ou l'autre pense quand même à te ranger
pense aussi à ceux qu'ont rien à manger
prennent des risques pour quelques euros
et se mettent en danger
mon vieux les tunes c'est un cercle vicieux
vaut mieux rester dans l'ombre ou tu feras des envieux
tu peux y laisser ta peau juste par instinct de survie
y'en a qui passent à table juste pour quelques llets-bi
qui sait ta peut etre la financière sur le dos
t'es dans l'excès même à tes frères tu leur tourne le dos
certains font pas de tarots un euro c'est un euro
c'est la devise qui nous divise nous rend malheureux
les femmes aussi c'est dangereux
fait attention aux michtonneuses
rend plutôt la mama heureuse
salis pas ton nom de famille
te travestis pas pour quelques centimes
accroche toi même si c'est dur dur
y'en a pour s'en sortir bicrave la pure pure
c'est malheureux mais on en veut toujours plus plus
du fric quitte à laisser trainer en justice


Selim Du 94 :


Danger sur le terre-terre
Si tu veux banquer
si t'as besoin de quoi que ce soit

Chest all hanging out, everybody screaming out

Cross the whole game like my verses do the track
Push the pen like a pack and let it work through the trap (Snyp!)

Ich bin kein Pop-Rapper, ich bin der Top Rapper, mit Hauptschulabschluss 
In der Tasche ist mein Job Rapper.
Ich mach' mir Sorgen, Deine Freundin ist seltsam, 
Sie bläst dicks wie eine Hure und will nicht einmal Geld haben.
Hobby-Hoe, Du bist im Fick-Business, mach' big Business. 
Ich krieg' Pussy ohne Ende, ich muss nicht mehr wichsen.
Ich flow' besser als Perish damals auf diesem Beat 
und mir geht's besser heute ohne Deal bei Put da Needle.
Was Ihr macht, ist kein Rap, des ist Ambient. 
Ich bin kein normaler Rapper mehr, ich bin der Champion.
Manchmal fühl' ich mich, als wenn ich jemand ermorden will, doch chille, spitte, bringe Rapper zum weinen wie Lauryn Hill, oh!

Ja, geweint hat er dann auch immer, einfach so, ohne jeden Grund.
Aber Du tröstest mich, Savas, Du machst meine Welt schöner,
Du machst Hip Hop schöner. Du bist wunderschön! Mach' weiter so, bitte!

Bitte fuck mich ab, ich brauch einen Grund zum schreiben. 
Mein Flow ist dirty und nasty wie ein Mund voll Scheiße.
Ich komm' zum Battle, spit' einen Vers, fick' Dich im Nu. 
Deine Freundin bläst hart wie auf Didgeridoos.
Du machst komische Moves, weil Du glaubst, Fame ist geil. 
Ich mach's wie Jada.
Gib Money, kiss the game, goodbye!
Tut mir leid, ich bin der King, 
Bin der Boss, bin der Champ, bin der Chef, 
Mein schwächster Vers ist Dein bester Vers.

Trauer, mein Flow ist für Euch nicht nachzuvollziehen, 
Ich versuch nur härter als hart zu spitten und hart zu verdienen.
Ich geb' keinen Fick, ich bin selber mein favourite Rapper. 
Ich bin ein Idol für die Jugend wie H.P. Baxter.
Ich bin nicht Hollywood, greif' mir nicht in's Steuer, mein Freund. 
Ich geb' hier die Richtung an, mein Flow straight Feuer für Euch.
Ich burn' Dich, ich kill' Euch, leg' 
Euch zwischen zwei Sandwich-Hälften. 
Deine Karriere, guck', Dir kann kein Mensch mehr helfen.
Rap', Du Loser, Du brauchst einen exactly Co-Producer. 
Schreib', was Du willst, doch Dein Text ist der letzte Dreck wie die U-Bahn.
Ich spiel' das Game wie Ego-Shooter, allein gegen Euch. 
Du willst nicht mein Feind sein, mein Feund, Homie!

Ja, exactly, Du produzierst das Stichwort, Mann. 
Du weißt, wie's ist, Savas, und 
Du sagst, wie's ist, sehr schön!
Mir geht s schon viel besser! 
Change that beat a one more time, 
Katch Money, tu' was für unseren Clan!
Let s go! S A V! Komm', komm'! 

Sieh', der Mac ist back, ich rippe Mics, spitte Lines. 
Respekt ist was schönes, doch ich will von Euch Fickern keinen.
Ihr hört mein Album und liebt es wie Billy Jean und Beat it. 
Ich komm' und splatter' jeden Rapper am Mikro, meet the Fible.
//Guck', der Beat ist aus Cash-Sampler, ich rap' länger, bring' 
Euch Rap-Banger, F-d-s-Wämmer, des ist Set-Anger.
Spit' so schizo, rhyme so psycho, ich geh' in's Studio, 
Mach' irgendwas, schlag' die Zeit tot,
schlag' Dich wie Eis tot, schlag' Dich am Mic tot. 
Ich bin fame, mein Name ist jeden Tag in der Zeitung.
Ich rap' nicht, ich red' nur, ich bin, wie ich bin, ich kling', wie ich kling'. 
Du klingst, wie ich kling', ich kling' wie der King, ah.
Du bist DJ, ruf' mich an, ich spitt' für ein paar Hundert, 
Laufe durch die Stadt wie der Prinz von Zamunda.
Ihr seid verwundert, fragt dies und das. 
Du bist ein Hater, weil Du zu viel redest, zu viel hasst, oh!

You are never lot, homie, Du bist eine Inspiration, 
Eine Motivation zugleich, Du hast mich gerade inspiriert.
Du motivierst mich dazu nächsten Sommer Geteiltes Leid zwo zu droppen. 
Und was motiviert Dich, mein Freund?

Bitte fuck' mich ab, des ist meine Motivation, wegen 
Euch Idioten mach' ich bald meine erste Million.
Ihr guckt mich an, als wär ich Alien, wie 
Vom anderen Planeten, seit dem Cometen fangen 
Leute an mit mir anders zu reden.
Sie sind alle so nice, so höflich und nett, 
Ich geh' an's Mic und ruf' Fotze und Schwanz, als hätt' ich Durett.
Ich bin der einzige Rapper, den ich kenn', 
Der was kann, der was ist, der was liebt, der was will, 
Der was macht und es sich holt.
Guck', Du bist so stumpf, dass Du nichts mehr merkst. 
Ich spit' wie Bartman, fick' unfassbar pervers.
Ich bin kein Freestyler, ich rappe einen Part und over. 

Wenn ich komme, ist für euch Party over. Go home!
Ich sag' in einfachen Worten, was Ihr im Studium lernt. 
Mein Flow ist Killer doch Ihr seid meine Kugeln nicht wert.
Du läufst verzweifelt umher und suchst nach dem Sinn der Sachen, 
Während ich gerad' dabei bin Deiner Frau ein Kind zu machen.
Ich komm' in ihr und auf ihr, komm', wann ich will, 
Wie ich will, wo ich will, komm' in ihr Face auf Klo, wenn ich will.
Egal, ich hab' Dir nichts mehr zu sagen, Du Punk. 
Merk' Dir einfach nur meinen Namen, du Punk! S A!
Ja, A du mi!",Transatlantic,2002

To you and yours
Ah

I'm a be	-boy, I'm the real McCoy
I'm chocolate all over like an Almond Joy

What's up party people in the place to be
Gather round for a minute and check the MC
I really don't know what you expectin from me
But I was born and raised to rock over the beat
See, me and my homies got some tight-ass raps
It is time we put the hometeam back on the map
All you radio stations play a whole lotta crap
It's like I'm hungry at the table and you feedin me scrap
So this one's for the people who can ride the wave
And go into the battle and come out unscathed
See, my only regret is that I probably never gave
Enough back to hip-hop for the life it saved
So ride along with us as we lick this shot
For anybody who put it down, we never forgot
See, we give it all we got, cause it's how we was taught
And it only takes a second just to blow up the spot

We keep it lit like weed, indeed the rare breed
They barely did enough of us for their needs
Our fans, some r&b, most hip-hop and rave
I'm dark-skinned, baby, and I get you sun-bathed
Once the track's laid that Jissm made
I become a slave to the beat, don't know how to behave
We kept it true, what else did you expect us to do?
Now I'm beggin you to come and spin a record or two
I'm on the prowl in the here and now I'll be cold
 
To you so-called MC's who want to get bold
You'll be showed in the worst ways
I'm seasoned for battle cause of Project Blowed Thursdays
I'm a wordsmith, now that we've settled into two thou
(Two thou) we gotta represent somehow (somehow)
It's talent in the ghetto that we'll have to employ
With melanin in em they'll seek to destroy

Cause we was at the party when the jam was live
And it really wasn't poppin until we arrived
We was hangin out at the club before we can drive
With big afros like the Jackson Five
Comin out the house late, makin it home safe
be	-boys in the place, just had to show my face
Soon after that I discovered my instrument
As soon as I picked her up we got intimate
Big up to my homeboys who know this tune
Microphone Mike and my man T-Spoon (Heavyweight)
Aceyalone just stepped in the room
Now we know the flavor's in here the party resumes

And be resourceful, and keep achievin'

Choose one or be a treat
By seven I'm in a spell, bumpin' a beat
Somethin' comes from deep within me
Talkin' sickly, stictly, talkin' to me
So possibly I could be goin' insane
Snortin' this cane
Stressed out like a muthafucka flowin' his pain
Misunderstood by most
Few people considered close
It's a very thin line between foes and folks
Slide up [?] and spokes, bangin' the curb
Stumblin' out the driver side tamin' the Burg
Mumblin' words, ready to reach
Dawg I'm deadly wit heat
Hold it steady I'll be
A fuckin' nut, patna what
Run up and get touched
Sent him on a journey stretched out on a gurney
I'm turnin' more savage as the days go by
Think I'm headed for the flames
Dawg, I ain't gon' lie
It's a cold world full a sin
What the fuck, what the fuck
What the fuck are you supposed to do
They after you and they want yo soul
But it ain't nothin' you can do

And I simply love nothin' but this kill I blaze

From these battlefields in the streets
I was born a fighter
And unlike many others
I've been through this shit
I've held a homie's hand
Till he died and lost grip
Homie rip, rest in peace
Things we used to say but fuck that!
That ain't enough I'm gonna ride to my grave
Think I'm gonna pay for the actions that you make
I'm way beyond the point of wonder why I'm [?] trait
This goes to all my enemies
Big or small, your up in the fault
I got nothin' to loose

Floss and flash, cop and blow a zip wit Bash

I'm across the finish line, tell me where's the flags?
Brought my rag top, should have brought the Jag

Give you game and secrets that I know you'll pass
To the next playa hater and he'll break like glass

So I choose to floss 'cause who's the boss, let's ink it
It's Richie Rich for those who thought re-think it
Some yell it and tell it, I blow it and smoke it and smell it

me arrodille para besarte 
why asÃ­ entregarte toda mi vida. 
Amores habras tenido muchos amores 
Maria Bonita, MarÃ­a del alma; 
pero ninguno tan bueno ni tan honrado 
como el que hiciste que en mi brotara 
Lo traigo lleno de flores 
como una ofrenda 
para deajarla bajo tus plantas, 
recibelo emocionada  
why jurame que no mientes 
porque te sientes idolatrada.",Maria Bonita,1997
A. Bocelli & J. Weiss,"Vivo per lei da quando sai 
La prima volta l'ho incontrata
Non mi ricordo come ma 
Mi è entrata dentro e c'è restata 
Vivo per lei perchè mi fa 
Vibrare forte l'anima
Vivo per lei e non è un peso

Vivo per lei anch'io lo sai 
E tu non esserne geloso
Lei è di tutti quelli che 
Hanno un bisogno sempre acceso
Come uno stereo in camera
Di chi è da solo e adesso sa 
Che è anche per lui, per questo 
Io vivo per lei

È una musa che ci invita 
A sfiorarla con le dita
Attraverso un pianoforte 
La morte è lontana
Io vivo per lei 

Vivo per lei che spesso sa 
Essere dolce e sensuale 
A volte picchia in testa ma 
È un puguo che non fa mai male

Vivo per lei, lo so mi fa 
Girare di città in città
Soffrire un po', ma almeno io vivo

È un dolore quando parte
(Vivo per lei dentro gli hotels)
Con piacere estremo cresce
(Vivo per lei nel vortice)
Attraverso la mia voce 
Si espande e amore produce

Vivo per lei, nient'altro ho 
E quanti altri incontrerò 
Che come me hanno scritto in viso
Io vivo per lei
Io vivo per lei 
Sopra un palco o contro un muro 
(Vivo per lei al limite)
Anche in un domani duro 
(Vivo per lei al margine)
Ogni giorno 
Una conquista
La protagonista 
Sarà sempre lei

Vivo per lei perchè oramai 
Io non ho altra via d'uscita
Perchè la musica, lo sai 
Davvero non l'ho mai tradita 

Vivo per lei perchè mi dà 
Pause e note in libertà 
Ci fosse un'altra vita la vivo
La vivo per lei

Vivo per lei la musica
Io vivo per lei
(Vivo per lei è unica)
Io vivo per lei
Io vivo per lei
Io vivo 
Per lei",Vivo Per Lei,2006

A. Domínguez,"Some time ago
I wandered down into old Mexico
While I was there
I felt romance everywhere
Moon was shining bright
And I could hear laughing voices in the night
Everyone was gay
This was the start of their holiday
It was fiesta down in Mexico
And so I stopped a while to see the show
I knew that frenesí meant ""Please love me""
And I could say frenesí
A lovely señorita caught my eye
I stood enchanted as she wandered by
And never knowing that it come from me
I gently sighed frenesí
She stopped and raised her eyes to mine
Her lips just pleaded to be kissed
Her eyes were soft as candle-shine
So how was I to resist?
And now without a heart to call my own
A greater happiness I've never known
Because her kisses are for me alone
Who wouldn't say frenesí?

Bésame tu a mí
Bésame igual que mi boca te besó
Dame el frenesí
Qui mi locura te dió
Quien si no fui yo
Pudo enseñarte el camino del amor
Muerto mi altivez
Cuando mi orgullo rodo a tus pies
Quiero que vivas solo para mí
Why que tu vayas por donde yo voy
Para que mi alma sea no mas de ti
Bésame con frenesí
Dame la luz que tiene tu mirar
Why la ansiedad que entre tus labios vi
Esa locura de vivir why amar
Que es mas que amor frenesí
Hay en el beso que te di
Alma, piedad, corazón
Dime que sabes tu sentir
Lo mismo que siento yo
Quiero que vivas solo para mí
Why que tu vayas por donde yo voy
Para que mi alma sea no mas de ti
Bésame con frenesí",Frenesi [From Radio Days],2002
A. Droid,"Well you never flew the colours
And I never saw you bend a knee
To any man
But you were never short of brothers
There was always someone
Holding out a helping hand
Well, I remember the summer
We were riding to a show
And our road went on forever
So we were riding nice and slow
And then I heard the band play
And the sun broke through the sky
It was a fine day for a funeral ya
But I never wanted you to die
No one ever wanted you to die
We were watching at the crossroads
When I saw you wiping out
Some metal box just slipped down
Right into the side of you
I was screaming
I was screaming
I was screaming
But nothing was coming out
They always said you were
A dark horse
Because you rode the land alone
But you know I think the real reason
That you were always riding home
And your road goes on forever
The sun will always shine
One day we'll be together
When we cross the final line
When we cross the line
If I turn to you and call you a friend
When all is said and all is done
Will you meet me on the other side

A. Fischer,"Mother hold me. I think I need to cry
Father help me. I have to get things right
Sorry son, sorry honey. Ain't got time to worry
Was afraid of these answers. I fell into a stare
Today I'm standing at the house where I grew up
Mother's dead. Father too
The fear is still here
And I look up the tree in front of me
Watching the treehouse father built for me
I'm climbing in
The fear just flies away
All my senses obey
Lovely creatures guide my way
They teach me how to cry
How to get all things right
How you learn to love the night

I wonder how it comes. Is this my second chance
Tell me am I dreaming or lost inside time
I pass the parts of life. It really cuts me like knife
I see my life in ruins. The world around me turns
Surrounded by angels I reach a special point
Above me my parents I look at with delight
Suddenly I see so clear
Hate just turns to understanding
Sweat on my skin as I awake from my dream
Through the dust I see the treehouse
And memories are coming back again

Now I stand here at their grave. I'm crying
I've learned to forgive and to love
I'm watching sunset's beautiful horizon
The evil's lost the good has won tonight
Seasons change and tides have turned
No one can deny his own changes
When I'm down I know a place
To wash away the sins I've perpetrated

I've learned to forgive and to love",Treehouse,2000
A. Human,"On the first part of the journey 
I was looking at all the life 
There were plants and birds and rocks and things 
There was sand and hills and rings 
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz 
And the sky with no clouds 
The heat was hot and the ground was dry 
But the air was full of sound 

I've been through the desert on a horse with no name 
It felt good to be out of the rain 
In the desert you can remember your name 
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain 
La, la

After two days in the desert sun 
My skin began to turn red 
After three days in the desert fun 
I was looking at a river bed 
And the story it told of a river that flowed 
Made me sad to think it was dead 

You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name 
It felt good to be out of the rain 
In the desert you can remember your name 
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain 
La, la 

After nine days I let the horse run free 
'Cause the desert had turned to sea 
There were plants and birds and rocks and things 
there was sand and hills and rings 
The ocean is a desert with it's life underground 
And a perfect disguise above 
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground 
But the humans will give no love 

You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name

The kids that only deal wit that type of nonsense
You can't get wit, D.K.S. self evident
Adolescence, reign the supreme court, in any, every, meant

The time was approximately eleven forty three
When the D called me, and told me, we must be
Lyrically, the best that he says, the
K N O see K, and S and K, it's spray
Comin away, the B.T.J., it be they
I'mma hold it down, wit sounds
Like clowns, walk the trey pound
Now in the underground, B.T.J. just entered
Remember, the S comes last like December
Once shit cock it's time to Rock like the Monsta
In reality, B.T.J., is lyrically responsible for all difficulties

My lyrics oppose a threat to the best M.C. yet

They need to think about what they talk about

Walkin down the street, some niggas stepped to me
Said are you Lil are-you-T-I-Z
He said I heard you nice on the muthafuckin M-I-see
Battle me, battle right here, and let's see
So we kicked a verse that didn't hurt
So I hit 'em worst, to let him know I don't play those games
Save 'em for the jerks, D. Verbs said ""Son, let me get some""
I said ""No, 'cause he's a victim, and he probably in my premises
You know when I open my book wit my lyrics I'm endin this""
(No question) All this shit he poppin in my ears
Fuckin ejected, he can't hang wit my style
Look now, here's man fillin it, back to like what I was sayin
I start extortin, I'm not playin
You want Lil Knock? I come on your block
Cock and then start sprayin, lyrics
So don't start what you can't finish
'cause I will be sure to end whatever you created

Physically you dead wit the push of this button
Explosion be corruptin, from the expert of execution
I met Lil Knock at the junction
He was talkin about walkin, to the tree spot
We took the L to New Rox, we got stopped by two cops
Talkin about ""Where the two glocks?"", we doo wops
How was I two glocks? Man, it's too hot
And I'm cold, so let me go, I never hold
Whoever told you, that I do la?
Lil Sha, fuck a do or die
Nigga die, because of what they do
I do what I do wit my crew
Po-po was hype, they was like ""You bite, stick wit the mic device""
Drivin off, said ""Have a good night""

A. Turner,"Let's begin at the beginning:
We're lovers and we're losers,
We're heroes and we're pioneers,
And we're beggars and we're choosers.
We're skirting round the edges
Of the ideal demographic.
We're almost on the guestlist,
But we're always stuck in traffic.

We've watched our close associates
Up and play their parts;
They're chatting up the it girls,
And they're tearing up the charts,
While we were paying with coppers
To get our round in at the bar.
We're the see-Team, we're the almost famous
Old friends of the stars.

Justin is the last
Of the great romantic poets,
And he's the only one among us
Who is ever going to make it.
We planned a revolution
From a cheap Southampton bistro.
I don't remember details
But there were English boys with banjos.

Jay is our St George, and he's standing on a wooden chair,
And he sings songs and he slays dragons, and he's losing all his hair.
Adam is the resurrected spirit of Gram Parsons, In plaid instead of rhinestone and living in South London.
And no one's really clear about Tommy's job description,
But it's pretty clear he's vital to the whole damn operation.
Dave Danger smiles at strangers, Tre's the safest girl I know,
Zo and Harps will skamper up to victory in the city we call home.

We won't change our ways, we will proud remain when the glory fades.

I am sick and tired of people
Who are living on the be-list.
They're waiting to be famous
And they're wondering why they do this.

And I know I'm not the one who is habitually optimistic,
But I'm the one who's got the microphone here so just remember this:

Life is about love, last minutes and lost evenings,
About fire in our bellies and furtive little feelings,
And the aching amplitudes that set our needles all a-flickering,
And help us with remembering that the only thing that's left to do is live.

After all the loving and the losing,
For the heroes and the pioneers,
The only thing that's left to do
Is get another round in at the bar.",I Knew Prufrock Before He Got Famous,2008

Somewhere in the City
Three days no sleeping, 
Not eating, not feeling good anymore
Drenched in sweat and self-pity now, 
It's not a pretty sight

What to say in my defense, I was imperfect tense
Used to have such balance, but I don't know where it went
So won't you be my present sense

Breaking, I'm shaking, it's taking a long long time
To come down off this murderous medication
Trying to remember, my reasons for running myself 
Into the ground with such dedication

Used to have such balance, but I don't know where it went
So won't you be my present sense, sense

So mermaids sing to me

Like the diamonds in the Mediterranean sea
Or the beatings and sleeping and times that I took
And of washing the drink and the drugs from my blood

Drinking while we wait for your plane
Feeling kinda bad
Wondering which one of us has changed
Cos we used to be slick
Subtle young hips, romantic young kissable lips
Unbearably sharp, unbreakable heart
With wide eyes and faith
That life could never pull apart if we were OK
But distance kills the best of intentions
And never intended it to be this way

Yeah my friend Lex was lying in the hospital
She'd been pretty sick for about half a year
But it seems liked this time the end was drawing near
So dropped my plans and jumped the next London train
I found her laid up and in a lot of pain
Her eyes met mine and then I understood
That her weather forecast wasn't looking too good
So I sat and spun her stories for a little while
Tried to raise her mood and tried to raise a smile
But she silenced all my rambling with a shake of her head
Drew me close and listen this is what she said now

""You'll live to dance another day, 
It's just now you'll have to dance, 
For the two of us, so stop looking so damn depressed 
And sing with all your heart that the Queen is dead""

Yeah she told me she was sick of all the hospital food
And of doctors, distant relatives, draining her blood
She said ""I know I'm dying,
But I'm not finished just yet, 
I am dying for a drink and for a cigarette""
So we hatched a plan to book ourselves a cheap hotel
In the centre of the City and to raise some Hell
They waste to all the clubs 
And then when everyone else is long asleep
We know we're good and done

""You'll live to dance another day
It's just now you'll have to dance
For the two of us, 
So stop looking so damn depressed 
And sing with all your heart that the Queen is dead""
And South London's not the same anymore
The Queen is dead, 
And the last of the great has finally gone to bed

She said that Lex had gone asleep and wasn't waking up
And even though I knew that there was nothing to be done
I felt bad for not being there and now, well, she was gone
So I tried to think what Lex would want me to do
At times like this when I was feeling blue
So I gathered up some friends to spread the sad sad news
And we headed to the City for a drink or two
And we sang

""We live to dance another day, 
It's just now we have to dance for one more of us, 
So stop looking so damn depressed, 
And sing with all our hearts, long live the Queen""",Long Live the Queen,2008
A. Turner,"Well a teacher of mine once told me
That life was just a list of disappoints and defeats
And you could only do your best,
And I said ""That's a fucking cop-out, 
you're just washed up and your tired, 
and when I get to your age I won't be such a coward""
But these day I sit at home, known to shout at my TV
And Punk Rock didn't live up to what I hoped that it could be
And all the things that I believed with all my heart when I was young
Are just coasters for beers and clean surfaces for drugs
And I packed all my pamphlets with my bibles at the back of the shelf

Well it was bad enough the feeling, and the first time it hit
When you realized your parents had let the world all go to shit
And that the values and ideals for which many had fought and died
Had been killed off in the committees and left to die by the wayside
But it was worse when we turned to the kids on the left
And got let down again by some poor excuse for protest
Yeah by idiot fucking hippies in 50 different factions
Who are locked inside some kind of 60's battle re-enactment
And I hung-up my banner in disgust and I head for the door

Oh but once we were young, and we were crass enough to care
But I guess you live and learn, we won't make that mistake again, no
Oh but surely just for one day, we could fight and we could win
And if only for a little while, we could insist on the impossible

Well we've been a good few hours drinking
So I'm going to say what everyone's thinking
If we're stuck on this ship and it's sinking
Then we might as well have a parade
Cos if it's still going to hurt in the morning
And a better plan's set to get forming
Then where's the harm spending an evening
In manning the old barricades, 
So come on old friends to the streets
Let's be 1905 but not 1917, 
Let's be heroes, let's be martyrs, let's be radical thinkers
Who never have to test drive the least of their dreams
Let's divide up the world into the damned and safe
And then ride to the valleys like the old life brigade
And straighten our backs and we won't be afraid
And they'll celebrate our deaths with a national parade

So come on let's be young, let's be crass enough to care
Let's refuse to live and learn, let's make all our mistakes again yes
And then darling, just for one day, we can fight and we can win
And if only for a little while, we could insist on the impossible
Leave the mourning the to the morning
Yeah pain can be killed
With aspirin tablets and vitamin pills
But memories of hope, and glorious defeat
Are a little bit harder to beat",Love Ire and Song,2008
A. Turner,"Rise in the morning at sunrise
Strangers around me sleep soundly at rest
Phones and computers become me
Signals stretch back to the lands that I've left
Oh in the quiet times
Count up the things that I love
Slip through the road lights
The trail of wandering back

Left you while you were sleeping
Left you the warmth in the bed, where I lay
You left me a love worth keeping
You left me a diary to count off the days
And so in the quiet times
I saver the things that I've lost
And slip through the road lights
And wonder how I came to this

I guess you never know
Lost until you have something to lose
Choice until you have something to choose
Choose

So give me my quiet times
To mourn for the things that I've lost
And find me on the road lights
Counting the miles and the cost
So I never knew
Lost cos I had nothing to lose
Choice cos I had nothing to choose
But all the things you do
The way that you close your door
The way that you guard your shore
Darling, I'm coming home soon",A Love Worth Keeping,2008
A. Turner,"Well I guess I should confess that I am starting to get old
All the latest music fads all passed me by and left me cold
All the kids are talking slang I won't pretend to understand
All my friends are getting married, mortagages and pension plans
And it's obvious my angry adolescent days are done
And I'm happy and I'm settled in the person I've become
But that doesn't mean I'm settled up and sitting out the game
Time may change a lot but some things may stay the same

And I won't sit down
And I won't shut up
And most of all I will not grow up
And I won't sit down
And I won't shut up
And most of all I yeah I won't grow up

Oh maturity's a wrapped up package deal so it seems
And ditching teenage fantasy means ditching all your dreams
All your friends and peers and family solemnly tell you you will
Have to grow up be an adult yeah be bored and unfulfilled
Oh when no ones yet explained to me exactly what's so great
About slaving 50 years away on something that you hate
Look I'm meekly shuffling down the path of mediocrity
Well if that's your road then take it but it's not the road for me

And I won't sit down
And I won't shut up
And most of all I will not grow up
And I won't sit down
And I won't shut up
And most of all I yeah I won't grow up
And I won't sit down
And I won't shut up
And most of all I will not grow up

And if all you ever do with your life
Is photosynthesize
Then you deserve every hour of these sleepless nights
That you waste wondering when you're gonna die

Now I'll play and you sing
The perfect way for the evening to begin
Now I'll play and you sing
The perfect way for the evening to begin

And I won't sit down

But saying that I can still see through her heirs and graces 
I bet she's scared her life won't leave any traces 
Caught up like everyone else

A. Turner,"Monday morning, comes a crawling in
From another weekend choked with cigarettes and sin
I've been busy, so much lately
That every time I get some time to spend
I end up drunk or sleeping in
And I miss you, you're busy too
We call each other up, when we're messed up
And say we'll meet in the New Year
But it's perfectly clear we'll do no such thing
Come the spring

When the evening casts it's shadows on the corners of my days
And I am old and I am settled in the place where I will stay
When my wandering meanderings have finally reached their end
Yeah whatever else maybe I will not forget my friends

Friday evening, barely even begins
Before my phone begins to ring with people asking where I am
And I can't suppress a smile, we talk a while
The chances are that I am far away and so I'm phased out of the plan
And that's how I miss out, on another night
The kind of night where nothing really happens
Yeah but everything goes down
And at the end I'm just a promise to pick up the phone
When I'm in town

When the evening casts it's shadows on the corners of my days
And I am old and I am settled in the place where I will stay
When my wandering meanderings have finally reached their end
Yeah whatever else maybe may my friends remember me",St. Christopher Is Coming Home,2008
A. Turner,"The first girl that I fell for was a fair and faithful fighter
She smoldered with a will to save the world
I did my best to help her, yeah I stood shoulder to shoulder
On the front lines with my visionary girl

I wish that she had cared for me
But in the end her ideologies
Occupied the fortress of her heart
I wrote her 15 songs, but still we had to part

And if music was the food of love
Then I'd be a fat romantic slob
Well music, it's my substitute for love

The last girl that I loved she was a low and lusty liar
She set my heart on fire, but made me choke
Her beauty was a sight to see, but she didn't save it all for me
I found other fires by following the smoke

I wish that she had either cared for me or
Let me be
But she chased me from mind and from my home
I wrote her 16 songs, but I ended up alone

And if love is really all that we need
Then even all my singing is never gonna save me
Music it's my substitute for love

Well I've had many different girls inside my bed
But only one or two inside my head
These days I cuddle up to my guitar instead
But oh, what I would give, not to stumble but to really fall in love
And I could substitute my singing for the sound of someone sleeping next to me",Substitute,2008
A. Turner,"I come from the land of the Wessex downs
From the Hampshire hills near Winchester town
In the country where the soft South rivers flow down
To English channel I roam, this is where I call home
I sing for my supper and I'm pretty well fed
My cross is silent and I make my bed
Where I can find a crown and somewhere to lay my head
And the traveling day is done, 
And all my songs have been sung

But honey I was lonely on the road, 
I was all on my own
Hanging outside at the back of a death metal show
I saw you standing there with your hair down low
A kink in your step that made me want to know
If you would like to take me home
Who'd of thought that a French kiss 
From a Parisian girl could capture an English boy

She comes from the channels of a distant shore
From the land of revolution and of Agincourt
From the Kings blood stain on a tricolour
And the culture a little too high, 
For an English boy like me
She doesn't know the Island I grew up upon
The valleys and the hills that I've roamed along
And she doesn't like my clothes 
And she doesn't like my songs
But she's still my Mademoiselle 
And it goes to show you never can tell

Cos she was a quiet one
She was a shy one
She was the prettier at the show
She crept up so slowly
She crept up behind me
But still she pretended that she didn't know
But all that she thinks of me, and she kissed me
And she's yet to let me go though I'm far away
Across of sea I'm singing for the hope 
That she would ever remember me

So honey when you're lonely on the road, 
You're all on your own
Hanging outside at the back of the country show
Picture me there with hat down low
A smile upon my face to let you know
That I would like to take you home
That I would like to take you home, 
To the hills that I know
I would like to take you home, to the places I go
I would like to take you home

From an English boy can capture a Parisian girl",To Take You Home,2008

This is my curse
This is denial

And admit once and for all
That without me you cannot live this life

Is to die tonight

Is to give my life to you

Quit tryin' to play me for a fool

You're here one minute and the next you're gone
I'm not blind, baby

You don't love me

You called me on the phone
Sayin' you'll be late comin' home
You say your boss is making you work late
But I don't believe it
'Cause when I called your office
So that I could speak to you
Ya know what they told me?
They told me that you quit last week

And how can you explain
That when we make love
You're callin' out somebody else's name
And when we kiss
Your eyes are open wide
And they can't hide what you feel inside, baby

Chorus
I saw you on the street
At the place we were supposed to meet
But you were with another man
I couldn't believe it
So I asked your friends
Who the hell was he?
Ya know what they told me?
There was a guy that you met last week

And now I can explain
Why when we make love
You're callin' out somebody else's name
And when we kiss
Your eyes are open wide
And they can't hide what you feel inside, baby

No conocia la soledad
Hoy solamente tengo tristeza y miedo
No tengo fuerzas para aceptar
Me sobran lágrimas para llorar
Ahora yo vivo tan sólo de tu recuerdo

Tan injusto ha sido el cielo
Por no llevarme a mí
Tan injusta fué la vida 
Por engañarme así

Tan injusto ha sido el cielo
Por no llevarme a mí

From the very first time
I looked into your eyes I couldnt deny
Those hips those thighs
Make me wanna eat you up like my mama's pie 
I'd be like 40 days and 40 nights just to make you my queen
You make a fool of a man turn him straight when you hit the scene
I'm like a voter girl you got me rock hard
Ide be like a baby boy with a brand new toy tear you hard
You got me slobbering, drewling
Thinking X rated
You always on my mind and oohh I just hate it
You butt nakid with water glistening all over your body
Visoins of us ice crust getting naughty
Heavenly father forgive me for theses type of sins
But this girl that I feel is under my skin

I feel you under my skin
This time I sink you in

Mami ven aqi wit yo big o butt
Looking at me strange in a be like huh
Looking at me weird like you want some
When I was young nobody paid attention
Look at me now I'm making millions
Split my style 'cause you know its different
Tell me girl what's really going on
Body so good got me feeling
You know I never be teasing
Baby back it up in my direction
Give it to me to have our own session
Like R.kelly put my key in your ignitoin
Sex on the beach is my prediction
Got me dreaming, sceaming
Lets get this hott tub steaming
Don't know the reason its open season
So cold I'm freazing but I'm not seasing
So go ahead and give me your pleasing
Come on girl tell me what your feeling
Like Marvin Gay, I got that huh I got that what

O girl you looking at me

Girl I've been feeling you
Ever since the time I see you
Give me the time of day
And I'll be quick to be there
So fast so quick in a hurry
So sweet like a flurry
Lets come together in one room like a grand jury
Come on, cause I have gotto keep it real
To show you how I feel
My secrets' bout to be revealed
I got to break it down

It hurt so bad that they ended our relationship
I can't believe it
Four years go down the drain

How I wish things would have happened so differently
I tried to say this many times but still you couldn't see
You kept insisting and resisting
That you would not fall again
And now you're trying to tell me that you're sorry
And you're trying to come back home
You're telling me you really need me
Crying begging both knees on the floor
But baby, I

Don't want to try
Don't want to try
Don't want to try no more
You keep insisting
When you know our love is out the door

Don't want to try
Don't want to try cause all we do is fight
And say the things that we want to hold back?
To where we both begin to cry

Don't want to try
Don't want to try about your sadden love
It's been a rough road
Baby just let it go

Don't want to try
Don't want to try
Don't want to try no more
Tell me what's the use of holding on
When all we do is hurt our love

You've died? in many conversations on the telephone
Talks about one day of having a place of our own
Wake up in the morning and have breakfast ready on the table

But all of that seems so far away from me
Had to wake up face reality
It all just seemed to good to be true
After all you put me through

And now you're trying to tell me that you're sorry
And you're trying to come back home
You're telling me you really need me
Crying begging both knees on the floor
But baby, I

Don't want to try

Perdoname si yo te lastime al final 
Si alguna vez te hice llorar, perdoname..

Yo se que es tonto pedirte perdon 
Si no fui yo quien cometo el error 
Si fuiste tu quien la espalda me dio 
La que nunca escucho la que todo mato 

me arrepenti de aver vivido asi 
Que no pudieras confiar nunca en mi
Hasta que un dia me fui hoy me 
Culpas a mi, pero nunca me fui 
Que te lo adverti 

why llore tanto por ti 
Al pensar que yo te heri 
No es solo tu o solo yo

Dia senti, pero hay tanto dolor 
Que me gana el amor 

Me duele tanto que pienses asi 
Why que no veas lo mucho que di

Que conoci la noche aquella

Subi y baje miles de enquestas 
Mas continentes no me quedan 
(y no la encuentro, no se donde se a ido) 

Y llegue hasta el final donde el norte es el sur 
Donde el cielo se invierte y no queda luz 
Y busque en el desierto en el mar mas azul 
(y no pude encontrarla, y nadie la visto) 

[Chorus] 

Me pasaria la vida entera 
Buscandola por donde fuera 
Me tardaria una primavera 
(debo encontrarla, sin ella no es lo mismo) 

Yo entregaria lo que fuera 
A quien me llevara hasta ella 
Porque esta soledad me quema 
(porque sin ella nada tiene sentido) 

Y busque en el oriente y no la encontre 
Donde el sol amence y no la pude ver 
Y busque entre la gente y no se lla hacer 
(se a escondido, se a perdido, pero no la olvido) 

[Chorus] 

Esa mujer no es tan facil de encontrar 
Ya no la sigas buscando porque nada va a pasa 
Ya que si ella te quiere ella sola volvera 
El corazon de una mujer nadie puede controlar 
Deja solo tu camino que ella aperecera 
Si ella esta en tu destino solita ella volvera 
Tienes que pensar tambien que tu tienes que parar 
Porque si ella te esta buscando no te va poder encontrar 

Y llegue hasta el final dodnde el norte es el sur 
Donde el cielo se invierte y no queda luz 
Y busque en el desierto en el mar mas azul 
(y no pude encontrarla y nadie la visto)

A.B. Quintanilla III,"I wish that I could take away the pain,
That's very deep inside my heart.
I wish we didn't have to play these games,
That's tearing all this love apart.
I wish the love we had would have never ever changed,
Cause girl, you know we're both to blame
I wish that I could turn my back
And walk away,
Just walk away.

I wish that I could tell my eyes to stop crying,
I wish that you would tell your friends to stop lying,
I gave you everything a man could give a woman,
Like fancy cars, and diamond rings,
And all the things that money brings,
My time, my heart, and soul
Were happy on someone on who
And it wasn't good enough
How could you be so blind?

[Chorus]
I wish, I wish
I didn't feel this emptiness, oh
And I wish, I wish
It didn't have to end like this, oh
I wish that you and I would be a family,
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
But wishing is all I have

I wish that I could turn the hands of time,
Go back to the night that we went wrong.
I wish you knew the things you put me through,
I've got to get you off my mind.
I wish that you would just pick up the phone,
To tell you baby, please come home.
And I wish that I could take away the things I said.
Though you said some messed up things too.

I wish that I could tell my eyes to stop crying,
I wish that you would tell your friends to stop lying.
I gave you everything a man could give a woman,
Like fancy cars, and diamond rings,
And all the things that money brings.
My time, my heart, my soul
Were happy with someone on who
And it wasn't good enough,
How could you be so blind?

No matter what I do,
You're always on my mind,
And though you're gone I find,
I'm still in love with you. 

Shadows fall, and I recall,
The love that you once had for me.
Miss you so, when lights are low,
I think of things that use to be. 

You're always in my heart,
Although you're out of sight,
Lonely teardrops burn,
As I toss and turn,

La forma de un día pedirle
Perdón a papá pues no lo

No cuido el dinero
Que siempre venía dispuesto a

Ayudar con dinero a todos los demás
Hasta que a mí me fue mal

Y no me acuerdo si esta es mi cama
O si otra vez me desperté fue en la sala

Me duele todo, estoy sin ganas
Y lo peor es que ni estoy en mi casa

Loco, me debí guardar algo pa' después
Loco me pase de copas otra vez
Loco que ahora alguien me diga que voy a hacer

Sólo recuerdo que celebraba
En una fiesta a la que todos llegaban
Muchas mujeres me presentaban
Así estaría que a todas veía guapas

Ocho tequilas, diez margaritas
Y de mi nombre yo ya ni me acordaba
Y no me agarren, que no hace falta
Que no soy yo, lo que se mueve es la casa

Loco me pase de copas otra vez
Loco, me debí guardar algo pa' después
Loco me pase de copas otra vez
Loco que ahora alguien me diga que voy a hacer

Y el cuerpo tengo ahora que no lo aguanto
No sé si estar en cama o sé si me levanto
Oye Diosito mío si hoy sobrevivo
Yo te prometo que desde ahora
No beberé más nunca otra gota

Y pa' que veas que no estoy mintiendo
Y que en el alma lo estoy sintiendo
Y que me estoy arrepintiendo

Yo se que te vas acercando a mi
Aunque sea largo el camino te voy a esperar
Siempre aquí

Vuelve, que yo te sigo esperando
Vuelve, para quedarte a mi lado
Vuelve, que todo sigue en su sitio
Vuelve, verás que nada ha cambiado

Vuelve, que todavía te espero
Vuelve, para quedarte a mi lado
Vuelve, por favor vuelve
Que estoy esperando que vengas a mí

Es hora de pensar en un cuerpo real
Que no desaparezca entre mis manos
Que yo pueda sentir, que yo pueda tocar
Como la melodía de un piano

Si quieres, vamos, nos cojemos
Nos tiramos, nos merecemos
Nos maltratamos
Sin lavarnos las manos, cariño
A veces no basta con que queramos

Digo tu nombre de nuevo
Y a veces creo, que estoy perdiendo la calma, la calma
Y cada noche despierto cuando siento
Tu voz que siempre me llama, me llama

Paso tras paso
Yo se que te vas acercando a mí
Aunque sea largo el camino te voy a esperar
Siempre aquí

Vuelve, que yo te sigo esperando
Vuelve, para quedarte a mi lado
Vuelve, que todo sigue en su sitio
Vuelve, verás que nada ha cambiado

Vuelve, que todavía te espero
Vuelve, para quedarte a mi lado
Vuelve, por favor vuelve
Que estoy esperando que vengas a mí

Un beso flotando en el aire nos quedara
Mi amor, te pienso
No me dejes de pensar

En cada radio del barrio, suena mi canción
Quiero que llegue a tu casa y tu corazón
Vuelve, que todavía te espero
Vuelve, para quedarte a mi lado

Vuelve, que todo sigue en su sitio
Vuelve, verás que nada ha cambiado
Vuelve, vuelve
(Que todavía te espero)
Vuelve
Por favor vuelve que estoy esperando que vengas a mí

A.B. Quintanilla III,"Nunca en la vida había querido tanto 
Hay vida mía tú no sabes cuánto 
Yo te extrañaba desde que te fuiste
Y no me has perdonado 
Y día a día me paso buscando 
Miles de formas de estar a tu lado 
Y tu silencio es una trampa cruel
De la que no he escapado 
Cayó una estrella y yo con ella 
Sigo pidiendo en mis deseos que estés bien 
Que me comprendas, que aún me quieras

Oh, uh, oh, uh, oh nuestro amor 
No es blanco y negro 
Tiene millones de colores 
Como los pétalos de flores 
Que hoy no se han abierto 
Porque ahora viven prisioneros 
De tu orgullo y de mi miedo
Uh oh uh oh no es blanco y negro nuestro amor

Y es que daría lo que más soñaba
Yo borraría todo mi pasado 
Y cada una de mis tonterías 
Que te han lastimado
Y día a día me paso buscando 
Miles de formas de estar a tu lado 
Y tu silencio es una trampa cruel

When suddenly my heart started feeling 
Stares of love that were burning 
Building walls, building walls 
Closing all my doors to love

Will this nightmare end 
How many tears will I have to cry 
Till her heart does change

I gave my heart to you 
How could you just leave me crying 

Why did you break my hear 
And say your goodbye 
Why did you break my heart 
And leave me with tears in my eyes 
How could you say you left me 
When all your words were true 
Let me say you really fooled me 
My heart just didn't see it coming 

Tell me baby 
Why did you have to leave 
Just tell me baby 
I'm begging you, begging you please 

How could you leave 
Without a word to say to me baby 
And how could you think 
That all my life without you here would be the same 
When you went away 
I can't believe the emptiness just hit me baby 
My heart was crying so loud 
I just could not believe it 
Oh I surrendered my heart 
But you just tore it apart 
How could you leave me so lonely, lonely 
I gave my heart to you 
How could you just leave me crying 

Why did you break my hear 
And say your goodbye

Let's get lifted, queens is you wit me
Niggas' shifty, I turn around, a kid tried to hit me
I back him down wit the 50-50
It had to been the thug in me, ya tunnel bang and come and get me
The first five hundred bitches free
He kid with the God jewel and let all my gods come through
Live niggas on this side of the bar, you get smacked, boo
And fucked too, shit on me? well then, fuck you
Gone wit your high class ass if you want to
Outta state you be suckin me off and breakin off
Weed bitch stinks of stallion but my dick went soft
My mobb got in lock wit masterlock, het getcha locks picked
Run up in your spot, mask-n-glove shit
Queens niggas involved with thug shit, you get lumpded
Crank, we in the bathroom thumpin

To the three-time losers, alcohol abusers
Big money spenders and the ebineezer scroogers
Thugs holdin fort wit the sixteen shot rugers
The cream that I redeem will bring a lex and landcruiser
Dominant chapter, assassinin' the obsolete
And my mobb comes deep to put the wind beneath your feet
My heart's harder than concrete, and nervous streets
Be walked offbeat but still thugs carry heats
I get deeper than skin, paragraphs from within
Dear lord, my life is trife, please forgive for me sins
My kin stay my kin, ain't no room for extra friends
One love to my thugs up north in the pens
Be a prophet to raise, beat my speech on stage
Nemesis renegade, breakin down barricades
These days are gettin rough, 'nother brother handcuffed
Fallen victim to the gameis like style's corrupt

I just might make it

I wish I could do this for the rest of my life
For the rest of my life, the rest of my life
My pops used to tell me, sometimes you got to do
What you have to do, in order to do what you
Want to do
(I wish I could do this for the rest of my life)
He also said that no matter what decision you make in life
At one point, whether it was good or bad
Your going to feel like you made the wrong one
So until then

I'ma do it on my momma' name
Cause I'm all in tonight and you know it
(Jump off, jump off, jump off the roof)
Damn, Damn (jump off, jump off)
Cause I don't know what's going to happen
If this don't work out
(Don't make me do it)
I don't know whats going to happen if this don't work out
(I Just might do it)
I don't want to know whats going to happen
If this don't work out

A.D. Scott,"I never thought it would end like this
Spending time reminiscing on
All the ""just friends"" i kissed
Thinking ""why we couldn't get along?""
I just wanted my time, my time, just to grind for the
Lime light, trying to get signed right?
No life, cause you know I got to get this shit to sound right
Cause if it sound right then I'm Riding
If it sound right then you'll like it
When the lights was off you stood by me
Now the boy is 23 with no wifey
Trading food stamps for my Nike's
Flipped them and bought some Adidas
And I'm not ashamed of my ways
Put that on my momma name, its Anita
This shit is my boggling, your self esteem became my problem
So i kept the dreams in my mind bobbin back in forth
Back in forth, your, adamant to kiss and make up
Then its back to war, nigga hang in, praying
That i be careful what i'm asking for, Amen
A man, awe dang-it Adrian's changing
""yea bitch you guessed it!""
Well remember to count your scars with your blessing
Stay read and bow your head if you don't do nothing else
And give em hell, and always be yourself

Just let me be myself
Cause I'm the Man, Dammit I'm the man
Shout out to Gambino

Now It's cool to be myself
Cause I'm the Man
And chance showed me how to do it
Shout out to Gambino

Ever since a little kid, i always dreamed I'd Be significant
To somebody, If not everybody then somebody but
This illmatic, and I'm still at it, lane changed but I'm still rappin'
Mike jack the boy still bad and I'm still braggin'
I'm the king of the Absolute Dopamine
Kid's say ""what the fuck is that supposed to mean?""
At this rate, it can mean what you want it to mean
I just said it on a record, what you want from me?!
Cause I'm 5 foot 8, and my shit sound great
But they judge and they hate, cause I talk this way
But, I was inspired from a little child, nigga, do you mind?
You on your grind, so am I, Do yours and I'll do mine
Now you feel the fear of god, he's on my side
So one more time, Let get it jumping like

To get away from their pops because they just don't get along

Still Try out but they pray they don't make it
Or the artist that grew up poor, had so much skill but
Can't afford to record
I do it for the guy with so much on his plate
That gets a text from his ex of her saying shes late
The same girl that's knocked up from all the creepin'
Who has to give it up because she can't afford to keep it
Can't ignore these secrets, some kids have dreams
Sometimes, same kids never see sixteen, so I do it

And for that girl who never makes a sound
Cause she fails to be noticed but truly wants to be found
And for the grad just trying to make it
It never works out, so he smiles, fakes it
And for my brothers overseas, playing in the sand
Cause they can't afford a degree, I do it for the
For the father, that gets laid off so
Now that light bill never gets paid off
Or that mother with no time for her kids
Because she works three jobs and can't afford to quit

The reason why god decides to keep him here

Date a few sluts then y'all start running your lips a little too much
My whole crew wild, thick as new now
We go to clubs, hit the bar, and trip two thou
Other emcees ain't got a chance at all
'Cause Big L Corleone is too advanced for y'all
Chicks can never walk away 'cause they like the sex
Flamboyant is the label that writes the checks
I'm a pimped-out nigga that walks with canes
Talk with slang, ball from New York to Spain

'Cause I'm V.I.P. till I D-I-E, what?

I spark light with the pen, drink O.J. with gin
Rock Tims with my laces untied
Cruise in the city on seventeen inches; ride past wenches
Past the projects, thugs chilling on the benches
Profile low as if I had an ill vengeance
Life on Earth is just a death sentence
Fuck it, alpha omega, arm, lega, lega, arm
With cold steel if you pose a threat to my neighbor
D-I double G I-N, I-N T-H-E Crates; lock shit times ten
Dive in, become part of a cliche; that art of an expert
Your honor from New York to Florida

Besides rolling thick my whole crew be marvelous

Got the whole club leanin' wit' it, and body rockin'
Drunk drivin' in my Cut, dawg; I got my truck parked
Seventy Two Tennessee Titan, like what up y'all?
I'm home, boy, holla at ya homeboy
Better come quick; once I get it then it's gone, boy
First come, first serve; fuck what ya heard
I'm piecin' out my pack till I come up on a bird
Blow the smoke out my nose, pimpin' on these hos
They know me at the bank, love me at the jewelry stores
I play it how it goes; the butterfly doors
On them old school vogues with the chrome on the toes

She ran her mouth and she caused a fight
Heading for the exit door
I never made it off the floor

More a lover than the fighting type
I never claimed to be the great white hype
Oh no, I'd rather have a broken heart
Than have my body torn apart

I believe, I believe, I believe in something
I believe, I believe, I believe in running
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run

I remember back in school
I always had to play the fool
Whenever there was choosing sides
I would always be denied

When I was waiting for the bus
There always seemed to be a fuss
I could never walk alone
'Cause I was in a danger zone

But I believe, I believe, I believe in something
I believe, I believe, I believe in running
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run

Daddy always said believe in something
And I believe in staying alive
But when it comes to blows I ain't worth nothing

'Cause I believe in love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love

Fast forward, almost twenty years
Found a girl that was so sincere
Wouldn't trade me for another guy
Never leave and I'll tell you why

You see, it happened on a Friday night
She ran her mouth and she caused a fight
Started swinging and she cleared the floor
Ran away with her forever more

It?s only human that we question
All the world around, we are so much the same
Needing others love and confirmation, the only game

As hard as you might try, you cannot let me down
'Cause I'm already lying on the ground

No need for pomp, bring on the circumstance
I can take the tension, not to mention lack of your romance

As hard as you might try, you cannot let me down
'Cause I'm already lying on the ground

Just another rainy day in London

I remember how beautiful
I used to think you are

I should have let you go

It was over in your eyes(it was over in your eyes)

To get rid of you(rid of you)

Now I missed the sun

A.J. Teshin,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.","Speak Low, song for voice & piano (from ""One Touch of Venus"")",2008

A.L. Lloyd,"The Coast of Peru
Come all ye young fellows that's bound after sperm
Come all ye young fellows that's rounded the Horn
Our captain has told us, and we hope it will come true
That there's plenty of sperm whales on the coast of Peru.
We have weathered the Horn, and are now on Peru,
We are all of one mind and endeavor to do,
Our boats are all rigged and our masthead all manned,
Our riggin' rove right and our signals all planned.
The first whale we saw, it was late in the day
The captain come up and these words he did say:
""Get into your hammocks and quiet there be
We'll see him in the morning close under our lee.""
Next morning at daybreak about five o'clock,
The man at the masthead cried ""Yonder she spouts!
Where away does she lay?"" and the answer from aloft
""Two points on our lee bow and about three miles off.""
Then it's call up all hands, and be of good cheer;
Put your tubs in your boats, boys, have your bow lines all clear.
Sway up your boats now, jump in you boat's crew
Lower away now lower away, my brave fellows, do.
Our waist boat got down and of course got the start,
Lay on, captain Bunker, I'm hell for to dart.
Now bend to your oars, boys, and make your boat fly
But one thing we dread of, be clear of his eye.
Now the chief mate he struck him, and the whale he went down
And the captain pulled up and he tried to bend on,
But the whale began to vomit and blood for to spout,
And in less than ten minutes we had him fin out.
We towed him alongside,and with many a shout
We soon cut him in, and began to try out.
Now our whale she is tried and likeways stowed down
She is better to us boys than five hundred pounds.
Here's a health to all whalemen, boys, drink it down, do
Likewise to the Bengal and our whaleship's crew.
All you that want money, I would have you to go
On the coast of Peru where the sperm whales do blow.

A.L. Lloyd,"When I was a bachelor I lived all alone
I worked at the weaver's trade
And the only, only thing I did that was wrong
Was to woo a fair young maid

I wooed her in the winter time some of the summer too
And the only, only thing I did that was wrong
Was to keep her from the foggy, foggy dew

One night she knelt down by my side
When I was fast asleep
She threw her arms around my neck
And then began to weep

She wept, she cried, she tore her hair
Ah me, what could I do
So all night long I held her in my arms
To keep her from the foggy, foggy dew

All in the first part of that night
We rolled in sport and play
And in the latter part of that night
She in my arms did lay
And when broad daylight did appear
She cried: ""I am undone""
""Oh, hold your tongue, you silly young girl
For the foggy dew is gone, gone, gone
For the foggy dew is gone.""

Got my bread and didn't do what the fuck I was supposed to do

Hear me out, put a bullet in your mind

[Prodigy]
Yo son they caught me from the blind side me the Pee
The one who spread love, me I never shit on my peeps
I never left my dogs out in the cold
I extended my hand with compassion, you extended yours in war
Cool fuck it, why y'all snakey mother fuckers
Gonna learn how this nigga rock quiet storm niggas
Leave you shot for dead, nigga I'll rot your flesh
By myself come for delf and just pop your head
Now have a good night you snake skin bastard
See you at the crossroads fagot
And in the mean time and in between time
Pee will be laid up with more shines, more dollars for more nines
More boxes of talons to put in your spine
You cross me nigga you lost your mind
Scratch that you never knew from the start
So I forgive you, after you die skirmish, shots burneth

[Chorus: Prodigy]
Son the get back, is so sweet
The taste of revenge your blood on the street
It's called payback for that shit you pulled
I don't respect your gangsta my guns explode
Son the get back (yeah), is so sweet
The taste of revenge your blood on the street
It's called payback for that shit you did
Two wrongs don't make it right, it make it even bitch!

Son we chose life fast, and niggas kept stunting
Had to show our ass straight up explode right fast
It sounds cold but we roll like that
Ripping rats finished off our path, we was close like that
All them nights that we threw back yak
Who would thought he do me like that straight leave me flat
Niggas ain't never feed me black, want to see me clap
Blood filling up the cement crack
Straight snakes and I resent that I fall back try to prevent that
Try not to be bent at, foul atmosphere
Stunning what's happening here
Got me 'bout to dumb out dumping out Macs in here
Niggas catch a hot one, fucking with Am this year
Wet every man in here vengeance lost my senses
why y'all start quarrels I end it
And show up at your wake full of sorrow pretending
To blend in

Yo I blow holes in moschinos, splash niggas in they mink ?stoles?
Down to their Kenneth Coles, fuck model bitches center fold
Never love a hoe, you got guns let it go my nigga let it blow
And what had killed you is what you don't know
It's two-five goodfellas getting dough
Yo my mom chose dope made love to the needle
I caught 'em fucking numerous times and turned evil
Back in '89 you can say I'm trapped in time
Still thirsty like a little nigga dying to shine
Baby moms said I got issues, too many problems
I rock timbs 'til my socks turn orange
Do a nigga dirty, relate to the unworthy
A young G with Q-T and black shirty
I've been nice since lee pin stripes and British knights
Fore' building razor tag and sword fights
Niggas see the light when they start losing pints
You can die by the gun or the knife
And I'm nice with both, coming at me with the wrong approach
Don't make me Arab neck tie your throat, you bitch nigga!

It's like Attica '67 when they, closed the jail
Be careful, but promote yo'selves that's what they told me
Involved but unconcerned fuck beef when it dissolve it does not return
I don't leave, stagnate nor move off-beat
So discrete very rarely do I move on feet
I rough-ride twin rugers on the sides of my seats
Drive-by's, bodies left on both sides of the streets
I blacks out never blind by the size of the image
No disguise, homocide don't rely forensic
Homes's finished, scrambling caught in the scrimmage

Got a female lawyer and she fucking the judge

He has proven untrue to you

He's gone to seek him another bride
And he cares no more for me

Oh, bury me under the weeping willow

A.S.A.P.,"I can still hear them crying for mercy
Screaming in anger
I can still see the face in the darkness
Mirror their pain
It was not their fault
But they suffer anyway

Life's cheap so they say when the time comes
To pay you'll be waiting the voice of a lost generation the cost
Is a crime
And history screams out but they do it anyway

Let the video roll cause you're burning
My soul with your message
The sound and the vision bring pictures
(Into my home)
And the children they cry; but life goes on anyway

Let the video roll cause you're burning
My soul with your message
The sound and the vision bring pictures
(Into my home)
And the children they cry; but life goes on anyway

You can see the thunder in her eyes
Even though the blood runs so cold
Keep a fire burning in your heart
After the storm
You can see the fire in her eyes
Soon the day will come when we will rise
Till then you'll have to tow the line
After the storm

I can still hear them crying for mercy
Screaming in pain
You're just a man with your head in the sand
Not to to blame
You're such a long way from here
Such a long way from here

If I ever get out of here
Fall to my knees and say a prayer
If I ever get out of this place
Fall to my knees accept my fate

You can see the thunder in her eyes
Even though the blood runs so cold
Keep a fire burning in your heart
After the storm
You can see the fire in her eyes
Soon the day will come when we will rise
Till then you'll have to tow the line

A.S.A.P.,"Blood on the ocean
There's a scar upon the world
And the population is falling to the point of no return
What will I tell my children
What will I tell my god

What happened to the world we knew
We could not read the writing on the wall

Blood upon the ocean
Washing red onto the shore
Wash my hands in desperation
But they stained for evermore
Your cry is growing fainter
I strained my ears to hear your song

What happened to the world we knew
We could not read the writing on the wall

There burns a flame, I'll hold it high
And shout your name
The people turn, a change has just begun
What happened to the world we knew
We could not read the writing on the wall",Blood on the Ocean,1989
A.S.A.P.,"Hearts on fire cause down the wire
Comes a voice from my past
My eyes ablaze I have no espace
It's a need I've got to ask

Believe right from the start
Hold on to what you've got
Have faith in someone
Down the wire
Pure in spirit, strong at heart
Long in truth but short of the mark
I know you time will come one day

Down the wire comes my heart
Worlds apart but you're next to me
Down the wire all the days
You been gone but you promised me
You can cross me a river, and you see what I do
Down the wire
Hearts on fire cause down the wire
Comes a voice from my past
Would I miss your touch, would I miss my own sight
There's a heart that's beating down the line tonight

Believe right from the start
Hold on to what you've got
Have faith in someone
Down the wire

A.S.A.P.,"Heart of a lion fight to the end
Run like the wind
Champion of champions, best in the land, you always win

Don't fade away, don't fade away
Run with your dream right to the end
Your spirit flies on eagle wings
Never coming down

Fallen heroes no more worship
Where have all the good times gone
Once I stood atop this mountain
Glory days set like the sun
Sitting all alone staring at the screen, thinking the past
Living in a land of faded memories
Realise that nothing lasts

Don't fade away, don't fade away
Reach out to you but you're not there
Your soul was never meant to be
Tied to the ground
Fallen heroes no more worship
Where have all the good times gone
Once I stood atop this mountain
Glory days set like the sun
Took away my fame and fortune
Left me with no place to go

Still part of me and part of you
Would love to be a hero too",Fallen Heroes,1989
A.S.A.P.,"He waits every evening outside schoolyard gates
Dealing death whoever wants to pay
Hide your tears act much older than your years
Can't you see it's building up this way?
Just another kid gone astray

Hey mamma, did you know just where your baby's gone
Do you know she walks the streets at night
Emergency, but you can't believe just what you see
Read the news it happens every day
Just another kid gone astray

Don't bite the helping hand
That reaches out to understand
We all need a little time
To put the reason to the rhyme
Everbody has their day
But sooner or later we're all gonna stray
Gone astray
Just like a loaded gun, finger on the trigger
And having fun
Nobody'd gonna stand in my way

Don't lose touch, slip through my hands
And out of reach
Come onn back, we'll work it out someway
The stakes are high, but you can't gamble with your life
Can't you see I need you here today
Just another kid gone astray",Kid Gone Astray,1989
A.S.A.P.,"Late at night
Rain falling down
Sets my mind wandering
Took a drive on a highway
I saw you standing in the rain
Destiny was calling me
I would never be the same

You said you said your heart was aching, you were sad
I saw you cry, the night you lied to me, oh no!
You took my hand then faded with the light
They said you died out on the road that night

I'm in a cold cold sweat
Knuckles white upon the wheel
Danger flies on silent wings
I can't fight and I can't feel
Now I'm standing in the daylight
And it seems just like dream
If only I could touch you girl
But you're not there for real!

You said you said your heart was aching, you were sad
I saw you cry, the night you lied to me, oh no!
You took my hand then faded with the light
They said you died out on the road that night",The Lion,1989
A.S.A.P.,"In his mind, he's been to hell and back again
Left a trail of broken dreams
The smile you wear just hides your fear

On the edge of the night
You can't tell what's wrong from right
What went wrong with my mind
I've been bad, mistreated, they don't understand
Never make a diamond from a grain of sand
Out on my own nobody, I'd change if I could
I'm not a bad man, I'm just misunderstood...

Life's unkind, so hard upon an only child
Took it all out on the world
Don't you know two wrongs don't make a right
Look into my eyes
See the pain of a lifetime

I've been bad, mistreated, they don't understand
Never make a diamond from a grain of sand
Out on my own nobody, I'd change if I could
I'm not a bad man, I'm just misunderstood...

A.S.A.P.,"Darkness descending
Night coming down in the city
She walks the streets in search of fortune
Down in a doorway a man with no hope or pride
He can't go on, he can't survive
Out in the jungle called the city
You'll never make it on your own
You got to have that

Silver and gold see you grow old
Turn with your back to the wall
Silver and gold out in the cold
Run but there's nowhere to go

He's got no future, all just because of his past
He's got a gun he's tired of talking
Hole in your pocket hole in your shoe
Chip on your shoulder you got that too
You steal a ride you're tired of talking

Out in the cold, cold winter city
You'll never make it on your own",Silver and Gold,1989
A.S.A.P.,"Locked up, banged up, can't think for yourself
Twenty four hours in a teen foot cell
Rights of a prisoner, needs of a dog
Stare at a ceiling, make your peace with god

Night falls, my heart calls
Hours turn to days
Daybreak heartache, looking down in disbelief

I see myself it can't be wishing your life away,
Pray that that tomorrow comes
Cry your tears today, yesterday will never come, well, well...

Backed up, jacked up, it's worse than you think
Thirty long days for one little drink
No hand on the wheel, no foot on the floor
Just walls and a ceiling and a slamming of a cell door

Lights out, the nights shout
The days drag on and on
Day breaks my heart aches
No way out there's no space
I think this time I'm going crazy
Whishing your life away
Pray that tomorrow comes

Yesterday is dead and gone",Wishing Your Life Away,1989
A.S.A.P.,"Memories in my mind, of another time
Now I feel it's right to share
The rebel in my soul is yours to tame
Life is not a cross we bear

Time flows like a river she goes
Make the best of what you've got
When a man is born into the earth he's thrown
Make this your paradise

You could be a king but it don't mean a thing
If what's sin our heart remains unspoken
Look for the truth before it looks for you
Your heart strong and never broken

There's a city in the sky built for you and I
Keeps us dreaming on and on, on and on
Now I search my soul, looking for a sign
Show you right where I went wrong

Hit her good, have her screamin' high notes like Mariah

I love that little attitude and the way you talk

Lookin' at the moon while you tell me how you feel

What is time? Time is when a man is trying to make time with your
woman,
but your doing time behind bars and your time is standing still. Yo
Frost, kick it to these people for real you know what I'm saying?
[verse 1 - Frost]
Time, sits through the hour glass, through night and day
and I watch as the games people play
It's like do unto others than split
and if you can't back up what you say then you ain't shit (yeah)
I've seen the manifestations of the street
so why can't I confess what I see on a drumbeat
like just last night (yo what happened)
I watched these two vatos get in a crazy fight
one of them was quick to pull a knife
he stabbed him in the heart and now he's doing life
in prison at the age of 21 (yeah)
living on death row cause he couldn't let go
caught in the web of violence (damn)
roll deep when they creep, and move in silence of the lambs (yo)
a tattooed tear dropped as the iron gates slam

Damn, damn ain't that a shame?
you're lost so take the caution don't play the game
should've listen to the Frost when I was trying to come across to you
but no you didn't think (sucker)
you just keep getting yourself more deep until you sink
so there's no one else to thank but yourself
so go ahead take bow for a job well done
but you'll never see the day of the sunshine or the fun times
just the old days and your old ways
corrupt and wicked
out there doing dirt, instead of just kicking it
pow pow bang bang and all that noise (yeah)
yeah you and all your homeboys
take time to read between the lines
cause ain't no sunshine
[chorus]
[verse 3 - Frost]
(yo kid) I know about being macho
callin' the shots the big time head honcho (yeah)
but here's something even more gacho
one of my homeboys is your old lady Sancho
yo shit happens
I know the lights of all these people right as I'm rapping
while you sit in a cell writing a letter
saying when you get out, your things will be better (right)
but man she couldn't wait
so she's going out on a date
with every Tom, Dick, and Harry
and if you ask me, your shit's getting scary
so how you gonna handle this
when your home's in Los Angeles
acting so scandalous
yo, you can't blame her you didn't take the time
and now, ain't no sunshine

Nique ta mère Clara Morgane et arrache toi de ma bécane,
Y a de l'arabe et de la hagra et de la lance-ba dans les parages,
Je suis pressé je lâche un couplet parce que les keufs peuvent débouler,
Le hall quatre super soudé Chabodo baise les condés,
Les PD m'ont testé je sais que ça va mal terminer, (Léo La Grange)
C'est mon quartier, y parait qu'on veut me fumer dans la capitale du crime,
Certains mecs sont super cramés.

Ils sont obsédé je suis aussi dar que le rap bombara
Encore plus excitant qu'une petite tas-pé qui bouge son Bombala,
Ce mec est chaud-chaud, ce mec sort du placard,
Ce mec a tout balance alors en fait c'est un gros bâtard. 
Nique sa mère, sept-huit soldat militaire,
Pour Bamako, Léo la jungle soldat des terres.
La ramène pas, on s'en bat tu vends des quettes-pla,
T'inquiète pas, le flow est lourd donc ça vient bien de quelque part.

C'est maintenant ou jamais, négro on sort d'l'arène 
Pourquoi maintenant ? Parce que le bon vent nous amène, (bla).

Tu veux savoir si on bicrav,
De quoi je me mêle?
Moi je dérape pour les vraies cailles,

Avec libido ou avec Pascal Obispo,
Remballe ton style,

J'ai (j'ai) du mal à rire, du mal à dire les choses,
Du mal à vivre dans le commun des autres, du mal à fuir les nôtres,
Blessés on se referme sur soi même,
Du mal à faire confiance aux autres alors on finit souvent blasés,
On aime se cacher derrière le regard des nôtres,
Confondre mensonge et vérité devient malaise désespéré,
Pour les nôtres, on espère un futur clean sans tâches,
Car je me rend compte que les wagons du passé a présent se détachent.

En temps de crise, mec on fait nos bails,
On tape des barres, laisse les taper des rails,
On tient les murs, ils font tomber leurs srabs,

Step Eleven
Ah get turned on by you,and in turn being turned on by you
Step Twelve
I know you're ready to become a disci disciple,a lonely little reverend
making his way day by day,in the congregation
Hustling a dollar here, a dollar there, selling pictures of The King
to bring back to the coffers of the all powerful all holy Reverend Doctor D.W.A.Y.N.E
Love first Reverend of The First Presleytarian Church Of Elvis The Divine.

If you see me standing on the corner, money in mah hand

33 minutes down till you lose the misery

Hey baby theres no need to go under, just ring

D.Wayne is on the mainline, tell him what you want

She spends too much time with herself every night
Fooling around with her fears.
In the morning she mourns the decline of her mind
Drowning in a bottle of beer.
It's too dangerous just to think about what she might have been
If she'd sung for salvation, if she'd danced on her dreams.

But there's gonna be peace in the valley tomorrow
Lord, 'cos tonight she's gonna blow it all away
She feels so twisted, she ain't ever gonna fix it,
She's just waiting for the light to shine on a brand new day.

He don't know if he's a communist, a hedonist or a whore
Spent too much time ridin' on a white line to find the door
If he did and he opened it, he'd find those letters in the hall
He's too blind to read between the lines
'Cos the writing's on the wall.

But there's gonna be peace in the valley tomorrow
Lord, 'cos tonight he's gonna blow it all away
He feels so twisted, he ain't ever gonna fix it,
He's just waiting for the light to shine on a brand new day.

(Let that light shine awhile)

I got Ecstasy, but I need some company
You got that mystery; I need a plan
Lord, all I got is a compromise and a bag full of alibis
as empty as the bottle of whiskey in my shaking hands.

But there's gonna be peace in the valley tomorrow
Lord, 'cos tonight we're gonna blow it all away
We feel so fuckin' twisted, we ain't ever gonna fix it,
We're just waiting for the light to shine on a brand new day.",Peace in the Valley,1997
A3,"I believe I'm gonna
Shut down my chakras, shift Shiva offa my shelf
Take down my tie dyes, my Tibetan bells
Cool down my karma with a can of O.P.T.
Ain't no call for Casteneda in my frontline library.

There's one thing I know, Lord above,
I ain't gonna go,
I ain't goin' to Goa, Ain't goin' to Goa now
Ain't goin' to Goa, Ain't gonna Goa now.

Ain't dancin' trance, no thanx, no chance to tranquilize me.
Ain't sippin' no smart bar drinks, you, that don't satisfy me.
Dosing up my dharma, with a drop of gasoline,
I ain't down with Mr. McKenna, tantric mantra talkin' don't move me.

I don't need no freaky, deeky, fractal geometry, crystal silicon chip.
I ain't walking on lay lines, reading no High Times put me on another bad trip.
Timothy Leary, just check out this theory,
He sold acid for the F.B.I.
Well, he ain't no website wonder, the guru just went under,
You can keep your California Sunshine.

'Cause the righteous truth is, there ain't nothing worse than
Some fool lying on some Third World beach wearing
Spandex, psychedelic trousers, smoking damn dope
Pretending he gettin' consciousness expansion. I want
Consciousness expansion, I go to my local tabernacle

A3,"Well, you woke up this morning
Got yourself a gun
Your mama always said you'd be the chosen one

She said, you're one in a million, you've got to burn to shine
But you were born under a bad sign with a blue moon in your eyes

And you woke up this morning
All that love had gone
Your papa never told you about right and wrong

But you're looking good, baby
I believe you're feeling fine (shame about it)
Born under a bad sign with a blue moon in your eyes

Because you woke up this morning 
Got a blue moon in your eyes
Woke up this morning 
You got a blue moon in your eyes

Well, you woke up this morning
The world turned upside down
Lord above, thing's ain't been the same since Howlin' Wolf walked into your town
But you're one in a million, you've got that shotgun shine
Born under a bad sign with a blue moon in your eyes
You woke up this morning 
You got a blue moon in your eyes
Woke up this morning 
You got a blue moon in your eyes

When you woke up this morning everything was gone 
By half past ten your head was going ding-dong
Ringing like a bell from your head down to your toes,
Like a voice trying to tell you there's something you should know 
Last night you were flying but today you're so low
Ain't it times like these that make you wonder if you'll ever know 
The meaning of things as they appear to the others 
Wives, mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers 
Don't you wish you didn't function, don't you wish you didn't think beyond the next paycheck 
And the next little drink? 
Well, you do, so make up your mind to go on 'cause when you woke up this morning 
Everything you had was gone, everything you had was gone

Woke up this morning
Woke up this morning
Woke up this morning, you want to be, you want to be the chosen one tonight
Yes, you know, because you just get help yourself

My two little cousins got shot selling rock

Tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do
Now what's next
Tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do
Now what's next

Caught up in the middle
My life's a riddle
Don't let it get ya
I wanna be legal
But it's this hustle that get me richer
One love to my peoples makin' money
I can see you bubblin'
Avoid all trouble
Beware of devils continue strugglin'
Nothin's impossible if there's a will there's a way
So get your mind on official business
You can be great
And it's been this way from the cradle to the grave
So get paid
My niggaz do this every fuckin' day
We parlay
Through politics and conversation
This information to my thug niggaz in the congregation
Watch and bare witness to the pleasures of participation
Separation is self destruction
What's needed is unification
Cause the world ain't hardly scared
If not prepared
Be sure to be bummy and be no longer there
But no one cares it's there to share
All we get is stares
Because of fear we'll evaporate
Say your prayers

And what's next

Hard livin' got me goin' insane
But I'm addicted to the hustle I'm trapped in the game
Whatz next
I'm goin' crazy
Tell me tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do
Whatz next

Hard livin' got me goin' insane
But I'm addicted to the hustle I'm trapped in the game

(Aye its on A3)
Makaveli tried to warn us
But niggaz ain't listen to Pac
Naw (listen listen) nigga really listen to Pac
Shit yean got it yet (no)
Then you won't get it
Might as well measure 'em up
And have his ass fitted
Why
Caught slippin' dog trippin' didn't soak game
Got his wig split like dem shutters on the airplane
Never will change niggaz wit' no name no shame
Might open ya head foe mess broke change
I stay posted like a flag (flag)
Starin' through my rear view ballin' in a jag (jag)
Bounce wit me Cali body rock down in H-Town
We gon' put these artificial bustas in they place now
Time foe a change
Real niggaz rollin' wit' me
Money makin' swift decision we controllin' the streets
Side track by the broads and the frauds
Ain't it strange
It's the reason so many niggaz get scarred in the game

Whatz next

Hard livin' got me goin' insane
But I'm addicted to the hustle I'm trapped in the game
Whatz next
I'm goin' crazy
Tell me tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do

That money gotta make it
What I gotta do to make it
Do I really gotta take it
Put this mack up to you face it
Doin' what we gotta do to survive
Just ask Kweli doin' what we do to get by
Some niggaz stick to the crime
Pitchin' nickel and dimes
What the fuck we s'pose to do
Who gon' give us a job
So I tried and tried
Tried to get out the grind
But the block kept on callin' me back
Fiends kept on callin' for crack
So I supply 'em wit' that
Gave 'em a reasonable fee
Nigga don't blame it on me
Shit just look where I'm at
Niggaz in gardens
LAPD is the target
Niggaz is heartless hustle regardless
Look that dope spot use to be an apartment
But now it's just a place to hide the guns in the closet
Watch ya step shift the grams under the carpet
We just tryin' hard not to see that coffin

Whatz next

Hard livin' got me goin' insane
But I'm addicted to the hustle I'm trapped in the game
Whatz next
I'm goin' crazy
Tell me tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do

Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie

Words I won't except
I thought I lost you

Cause the man I thought I knew
Wouldn't do me no harm

I held my pillow tight
Now trust me when I say
You have been told
I'm telling you never to touch me no more

When you called me out my name
I stooped to your level
Replied you the same
Know here we are again
You at my throat

That I did before
I walk away from you
At the drop of a dime
So often this treatment
Is way out of line
And that ran through my mind, over and over again
Promised my self you wouldn't put your hands on my again

Cause I just don't know
Where to run, what to say
Stay out your way, or get in your face

It ain't what you think,

We thought it was special,
When we always stayed down,
No matter where we went you'd stay in touch,

Two people that were just so in love,
Now you probably ain't feelin' much,
Like things ain't really been the way they used to be,
And you say it seems like I changed,
But I'm still the same.

Said that on Tuesday,
I'd be home,

Left a message on your voicemail
Sayin' I'd call you later,
To inform you I'm alright,
Now you callin',

Just to tell me that you heard,
I was seen in a Bentley with my girls,
So I'm on my way to a spot where people hang,
But nothing's changed.

Say I hurt your hear, ask how could I smile?

You wanna lay up in the sheets of presidential suites
Like I'll massage you while you massage me, mami
But can you hang with a young man who's doing his thing?
Speak up, I wanna know if you can keep up

Baggy sweatsuits, mystery what's underneath them

I've been working too hard, finally I get my break
I must say it's a good day
But I got, been doing this forever
And now it’s coming together
I must say it's a good day
Now I'm on my celebration flow

I'm on my celebration flow, yeah

So high is my pride, it's above the sky
You know it's about to go down tonight
We gonn let the good times roll
I'm letting go, not letting no dramas kill my life
Nothing can fade me, I'm in my zone
Except for my cup filled with alcohol
I'm here to party and lose control
I'm celebrating, this is celebration flow

[Chorus]

See the future like palm readers
Where the leaders live in a house of a lie like Don Chito
That's now, and still see non believers
And I hear what's great of covers affair for dying divas, what?
What kind of celebrating do you like to do?
A right to passage or the flashing lights that's blinding you
Haters you, wanna bring you down cause you trying to
Have a good day like O’Shea back in ‘92
Giving myself a minus to, bounce like the beat I'm rhyming to
If I see you got the devil up inside of you
Name another rider who, will provide you with the truth
Or keep tighter than the bodies do
That's why they try to take him out like Chinese food
Cause of the special delivery, it’s a sign of the fertility, dead like shvelry
Is it over your head? The way you feeling it?
Celebrating my God-given ability

For someone else's selfish gain
Here there is no choosing
Working the clay
Wearing their anger like a ball and chain.

Underneath a blazing sun

And freedom was a song
I heard them singing when the day was done
Singing to the holy One.

Lead me on
To a place where the river runs
Into your keeping, oh.
Lead me on

Comforts the seeking, lead on.

Labeled with a golden star
Heavy hearted boarding
Whispers in the dark

In chambers made for sleeping, forever
Voices like thunder in a mighty roar

That works so well for how we are
Cause neither of us has the heart to fall in love all over again

Is that you're always so cool and comfortable whenever I'm around
You're some one that I can talk too
No matter what I'm going through I call on you
'Cause I know you'll always be down
See what we have is so incredible
That we'll never find in anyone else
This thing that we share is so unbelievable
That I want you all to myself

Even though I'm not your man and I know you're not my girl
But let's just act like it's that way tonight
Now I know u got your friends and you know I got some too
But let's just act like you're my lady tonight

Oh, I know that we both have our separate lives
And we don't keep ties on each other
So you can have me
So that I can hold you until the morning comes
Then we can go back to how things was before

Even though I'm not your man and I know you're not my girl

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

And by the light of that same star
Three Wise men came from country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

This star drew nigh to the northwest
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest
And there it did both Pause and stay
Right o'er the place where Jesus lay.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

Then entered in those Wise men three
Full reverently upon their knee
And offered there in His presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.

Born is the King of Israel!

Sing praises to our heavenly Lord

And with his blood mankind has bought.

I laughed at all his words
I thought he was a bitter man

Before you even know
For love is blind and you're far too kind
Don't ever let it show

When I was younger.
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger.

The can can's such a pretty show
They'll steal your heart away
But backstage, back on earth again
The dressing rooms are gray

They come on strong and it ain't too long
Before they make you feel a man
But love is blind and you soon will find
You're just a boy again

When you want her lips, you get a cheek
Makes you wonder where you are

Aaron Carter,"My mama told me I'm too young to love
But I know what I know and I can't get enough
I'm thinking about you and me holding hands
Pushing you on a swing
We can do anything
Cause when I think of you all I know
Is that there's nothing I won't do to be with you
Ain't that cute. holding hands in the park
Ain't that cute. can't stay late after dark
Ain't that cute. was in love from the start
Ain't that cute. I could swear you stole my heart
I often wonder the meaning of love
Is it something meant just for grown-ups?
Nick always told me just to follow my dreams
But with love on my mind it is so hard to see
And still when I think of you all I know
Is that there's nothing I won't do to be with you
Ain't that cute. holding hands in the park
Ain't that cute. can't stay late after dark
Ain't that cute. was in love from the start
Ain't that cute. I could swear you stole my heart
It's true if I'm wrong
Then tell me girl what should I do
Or would you even care
If I told you love could be so simple
Between me and you
Oh, baby

Was it my eyes that let you know you had control
Because the way you move was so self-assured
You knew I would surrender

I'm dead (your done) that's it for me
I'm gonna be picked off my family tree

I don't want to even start thinkin' about dad
I'm hustlin' around the house

And I ain't tellin' the world (my internet girl)

She's my best kept secret
Hooked up all night with that girl

She's my one and only, my internet girl

My internet girl, my internet girl.

Shufflin' through my windows
Gotta find my way back to you
(I gotta find away, gotta find a way)
(I gotta find a way, gotta find a way)

You left me mail in the inbox
Thinkin' about what we should do
(I will type again girlfriend, so tell me, tell me what you want to do)

You left me the password to your heart
(yeah, that's it. I got it.)
No lookin' back we clicked from the start
I want to let you know
She's mine

Aaron Carter,"Sometime, someplace
Everybody has words
Fallin' out, and making up
Uh-huh

[Chorus]
Maybe I laugh, maybe I cry
Maybe I scream, maybe I sigh
Baby I feel, the feeling is real
Maybe I curse, maybe I squeal

But I enjoy, making some noise
Foolin' around, adjusting to the sound
You and I get, everything's set
Be sure you know how to have a real good time

(Yeah, yeah)
One, two, three, four

You and I are not to blame
Sometimes we just go insane
You and I have much to give
Everything is relative
When we have our darker days
We just go our separate ways
You and I are not to blame
Sometimes we just go insane

[Chorus]

Sometimes baby in your eyes
Love is truly justified
When I hear you tellin' lies
I just wanna terrorize
Making up is oh so good
Yeah we rock the neighborhood
You and I are not to blame
Sometimes we just go insane",Real Good Time,2000

Do you want to, be free

And it goes a little something like this

Hit it!

I want to make it bounce
Here we go
Aaron's in the house
Get up get up
Aaron's in the house

Yo guys, check it out
Guess what happened to me
(Another crazy story, come on AC)
I was hanging at the court
Just playing some ball
Working on my game
(Yeah, we heard it all)
I heard the fans screaming
I thought it was for me

But then I saw a shadow
It was twelve foot three
It was Shaquile O'Neal
(What? What did he say?)
(How 'bout some one-on-one, do you want to play?)
I told him why not, I got some time
But when I beat you real bad
Try not to cry

(Please Aaron, are you for real?)
(One-on-one with Shaquile O'Neal?)
Yeah, 34 Centre from the L.A. Lakers
(You must've been nervous)
I knew I could take him
Stared' at Shaq, psyche him out
I said O'Neal, you're in my house now
Start the game the whistle blows
Pay attention close 'cause the story goes

It's like boom (boom)
I put it in the hoop
Like slam (slam)
I heard the crowd screaming out jam (jam)
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
'Cause that's how I beat Shaq

It's like boom (boom)
I put it in the hoop
Like slam (slam)
I heard the crowd screaming out jam (jam)
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
'Cause that's how I beat Shaq

So check it out
I thought I had the lead
But then he started scoring mad points on me
I was scorin' the bricks
Was he hitting those shots?
I knew that there was a way that I could make it stop

I had a plan, that I could change the pace
I said, Yo Shaq you didn't tie your shoelace
He looked down, I stole the ball
I'm taking him to school now, watch me all
A 3-pointer, nothing but net
Come on Shaq, had enough yet?
Down by two, I'm catching up
I guess your getting nervous
'Cause you already lost

It's like boom (boom)
I put it in the hoop
Like slam (slam)
I heard the crowd screaming out jam (jam)
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
'Cause that's how I beat Shaq

Dunk after dunk
Jam after jam
Cheerleaders are cheering
Aaron's the man

Dunk after dunk
Jam after jam
Cheerleaders are cheering
Aaron's the man

Announcers were shocked
Couldn't believe it was real
(I can't believe a kid just stuffed O'Neal)
One more second, was all that remained
I put the ball up
I put him in shame
I must admit that it sounds real crazy
but the ball went in
Then he cried like a baby
Sorry Shaq, I should've let you win
You're good too
And we can still be friends

The fans went nuts
They put me on their shoulders
Then I heard a voice
And it sounded like my mother's

(Get up for school, you're gonna be late!)
Ma, can't you see that I'm playing the game?
(How you could be playing if you're still in bed?)
(Are you gettin' sick, did you hit your head?)
Aw, man it was all a dream
I guess that kinda thing could never happen to me

If it was a dream and it wasn't real

How'd I get a jersey with the name O'Neal?
Woah

It's like boom (boom)
I put it in the hoop
Like slam (slam)
I heard the crowd screaming out jam (jam)
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
'Cause that's how I beat Shaq

Aaron Carter,"Here's a little bit of Old School for you
That goes a little somethin' like this

I always try to be the flyest kid on the block
The popular one with the risin' stock
So that's when I had this bright idea
(For the party of the month) Nah, the party of the
year
All the fine girls couldn't turn it down
Now all I gotta do is get my parents out
Should I send 'em to a movie (Nah, send 'em to a show)
Let me think, hmm, it's gotta be long, though
I said, ""Mom and dad, yo', why you sit at home
It's a Friday night, have you seen Aunt Joan
And don't worry 'bout stayin' out too long
Don't fuss over me, I'll be fine alone""

Have a good time

The doorbell rings 'cause the party's here
I'm crankin' up the song like it's New Year's
Walkin' 'round the house like who's the man
(Can't nobody do it like Aaron can)
First on the floor, you know that's me
Bustin' at the moves like it's MTV
I guess somewhere along, I lost my head
Then I jumped on the table, this is what I said

People all around, you gotta (Come get it)
Everyone together sing it loud (Come get it)
Jump all around, come on (Come get it)
What (Come get it)
Say it again (Come get it)

People all around, you gotta (Come get it)
From the left to the right make noise (Come get it)
Here we go now come on (Come get it)

(Nah-nah-nah-nah) Come on, here we go, ha-ha
(Nah-nah-nah-nah) Come with me, woo
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Here we go, uh, uh
(Come get it)

Things are goin' great then to my surprise
Some people walked in that I didn't recognize
I said, ""Fellas, yo', you gotta get out""
Open House
I didn't put a sign
Then walked in the girl I'm crushin'
And a kid spilled juice on my mom's new cushion
I turned around, another kid broke a lamp
They got them from France
For now I won't sweat it, I'll clean it up later
There's a honey over there and I really wanna meet her

People all around, you gotta (Come get it)
Everyone together sing it loud (Come get it)
Jump all around, come on (Come get it)
What (Come get it)
Say it again, here we go, uh (Come get it)

People all around, you gotta (Come get it)
From the left to the right make noise (Come get it)
Here we go now come on (Come get it)
Uh-uh, what (Come get it)
What (Come get it) woo

(Nah-nah-nah-nah) Come with it
(Nah-nah-nah-nah) One time for the road yo, huh, come on
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Come get it)

Break it down

Go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go
Go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go
(Now the trouble starts)

Is that a car door, oh, dang, I'm in trouble
Everybody get out now on the double
I'm dead {You're done}, that's it for me
I'm gonna be picked off my family tree
Once Mom finds out 'bout the party I had
I don't even wanna start thinkin' about dad
I'm hustling around the house tryin' to clean the mess
I sure put my new white Nike's to the test
The car door slammed, now they're walkin' up the steps
I guess life is good for 10 seconds left
{Aaron} Grounded!

People all around, you gotta (Come get it)
Everyone together sing it loud (Come get it)
