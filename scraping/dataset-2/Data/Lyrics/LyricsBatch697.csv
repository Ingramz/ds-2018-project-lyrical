Matt Rollings,"Claire had all but given up,
When she and Edwin fell in love.
She touched his face and shook her head,
In disbelief, she sighed and said:
""In many dreams I've held you near,
""Now, at last, you're really here.

""Where've you been?""
""I've looked for you forever and a day.""
""Where've you been?""
""I'm just not myself when you're away."" 

He asked her for her hand for life, 
And she became a salesman's wife.
He was home each night by eight,
But one stormy evening, he was late.
Her frightened tears fell to the floor,
Until his key turned in the door. 

""Where've you been? ""
""I've looked for you forever and a day.""
""Where've you been?""
""I'm just not myself when you're away."" 

They'd never spent a night apart, 
For sixty years, she heard him snore.
Now they're in a hospital,
In separate beds on different floors.

Claire soon lost her memory,
Forgot the names of family. 
She never spoke a word again,
Then one day, they wheeled him in. 
He held her hand and stroked her hair,
In a fragile voice she said:

""Where've you been? ""
""I've looked for you forever and a day.""
""Where've you been?""
""I'm just not myself when you're away.""
""No, I'm just not myself when you're away.""",Where've You Been,1990
Matt Rollings,"Everything in moderation, that's the way it's always been
Never gettin' out of control never hanging it out
Always reelin' it in
I saved my money for a rainy day
But now I've had enough of playin' it safe
I want to go too far, I want to go too fast
Somebody draw the line so I can blow right past
I want to spend too much, I want to stay too late
I'm gonna roar too loud, I'm gonna be that way
I want to play too hard, I want to go too far

I'm the one they all depend on
Sensible, predictable, and strong
But every now and then, 
I feel like I've played that role too long
I need to rock the boat, I need to speak my mind
Just this once let it all unwind

I want to go too far, I want to go too fast
Somebody draw the line so I can blow right past
I want to spend too much, I want to stay too late
I'm gonna roar too loud, I'm gonna be that way
I want to play too hard, I want to go too far

I've gotta set this spirit free
That's hiding here inside
I feel like a bird in a cage
It's time for me to fly",I Wanna Go Too Far,1995
Matt Rollings,"I'm catchin' this south bound train
I've had enough of the pouring rain
Chilled to the bone, I have to go

Love was never a friend of mine
The only friend that I have is time
It's down the track, ain't lookin' back

Mexico, O Mexico
I long to see your border town
Mexico, O Mexico
Adios mi corazon

The cars are clickin' the night along
But all I hear is a heartbreak song
Haunting me, relentlessly

Come the morning and I will stand
On the banks of the Rio Grande
A brand new day, wash these tears away

Mexico, O Mexico
I long to see your border town
Mexico, O Mexico
Adios mi corazon

There's nothin' like the feel
Of the steel against the steel
And you can't forget the crying of the rail
There's nothin' like the sight
Of a moonlite desert night
To heal a broken heart that was so frail

Mexico, O Mexico
I long to see your border town
Mexico, O Mexico
Adios mi corazon
",O Mexico,1995
Matt Rollings,"I'm not quite sure what's going on
But all day through, and all night long
I've been thinkin' about you
I've been thinkin' about you

The look in your eyes
When you smile that way
The sound of your voice
Saying my name
I've been thinking about you
Just keep thinking about you

This single minded fascination I've got
Do you call it love
If you don't then what
All I know is I don't know what you've done
And this train of thought ain't about to jump
The track that it's on

In the back of my mind
There's a secret place
But the whole world knows by the smile on my face
That I've been thinkin' about you
Can't stop thinkin' about you

Think about you

This single minded fascination I've got
Do you call it love
Well if you don't then what
All I know is I don't know what you've done
And this train of thought ain't about to jump
The track that it's on

I know it's crazy
Calling you this late
When the only thing I wanted to say
Is I've been thinkin' about you
Yeah, just keep thinkin' about you
Oh, I can't stop thinkin' about you
Oh, I'm always thinkin' about you
And I do love thinkin' about you
Yeah",Thinkin' About You,1995
Matt Rollings,"I left home with nothing but a few tears in my eyes
Now I'm halfway down the interstate past Highway 99
It's just me and one good wiper blade up against the rain
And I still hear the echoes of those bitter words we said
I could drive a million miles and never drive them from my head

Those words we said
No matter how I try I can't get far enough away
Every sad song on my radio sounds like it's custom made
By some devil on my shoulder that keeps whispering in my ear
Those words that wounded like an arrow to the heart
And keep me drivin', drivin'",Those Words We Said,1995
Matt Rollings,"I'll just keep on falling in love
Till I get it right
Right now I'm like a wounded bird
Hungry for the sky
But if I try my wings and try long enough
I'm bound to learn to fly
So I'll just keep on falling in love
Till I get it right

My door to love has opened out
More times than in
And I'm either fool or wise enough
To open it again'
'Cause I'll never know what's beyond the mountain
Till I reach the other side
So I'll just keep on falling in love
Till I get it right

If practice makes perfect, then I'm near about as perfect
As I'll ever be in my life
So I'll just keep on falling in love
Till I get it right",Till I Get It Right,1995
Matt Rollings,"Well I was born for Saturday night
Looking for trouble and ready to fight
I was made to be wild and free
Where it's loud and bright, that's where I'll be
And I might change some day I guess
But honky tonkin's what I do best 
I can juke all night without taking a breath
Get out on the floor, dance myself to death
I'm a wild-eyed, certified, bonafide general mess
And honky tonkin's what I do best

I never had much luck with society
My momma used to say ""he don't belong to me""
But deep down I think daddy understood
He always made me feel like I was worth some good
Sister moved to New York and she's a big success (I'm so impressed)
But honky tonkin's what I do best

I can juke all night without taking a breath
Get out on the floor, dance myself to death
I'm a wild-eyed, certified, bonafide general mess
And honky tonkin's what I do best
Honky tonkin's what I do best
Yeah, I said honky tonkin's what I do best
Honky tonkin's what I do best",Honky Tonkin's What I Do Best,1996
Matt Rollings,"Here I am standing with these teardrops in my eyes
Hoping maybe someday you will change
I heard that same ole story too many times before
You tell me that you love me then you turn around and run 
I just want your sweet love
I can't stop coming around
You know that your sweet love
Someday it's going to tear me down, down, down, down, down, down, d-d-down

Here I am still waiting like the fool I've always been
Hoping maybe some day you will change
I try to give you all of my heart time after time
But you hang me out there like a puppet on a string

I just want your sweet love
I can't stop coming around
You know that your sweet love
Someday it's going to tear me down, down, down, down, down, down, d-d-down

Matt Rollings,"I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

Oh, I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

Matt Rollings,"Regie Hamm and Joel Lindsey
So many mountains that we try to climb
So many places where we fall behind
Deep in the struggle just to find our way
We lose the heart, we lose the faith
Sometimes this life can tear your world apart
But you've got to remember that...
Chorus:
His love is strong enough to win the fight
His love is strong and good and right
When the heart gets weak
And the road get's long
His love is strong
His love is strong
Within the wonder of a baby's cry
And in the thunder of the midnight sky
Is something stronger than the heart of steel
It's a power you can touch and feel
So when you think that all your hope is gone
You've got to remember that...
Repeat chorus
You may be walking through the darkest night
On a road that's rough
But keep believing in the morning light
And His love will be enough, cause...
Repeat chorus",His Love Is Strong,1999
Matt Rollings,"I've got trails and tribulations
Troubles all around
My desires and expectations have me lost more than I'm found
And lord knows I often falter in the smallest of my pride
But when I kneel down at his alter I am lifted up inside

'Till I stand upon that mountain 
'Till I sit beside the thrown 
'Till the waters of loves fountain carry me home
'Till I rise up from this mortal clay of blood and bone
Let the rock that was rolled away be my cornerstone

Help me face every tomorrow 
Give me strength to bare the load
Give me signs that I can follow
Set feet upon the road 
And may he who walked on water give me courage where I tread
And when I kneel down at his alter let my hungry soul be feed

'Till I stand upon that mountain 
'Till I sit beside the thrown 
'Till the waters of loves fountain carry me home
'Till I rise up from this mortal clay of blood and bone
Let the rock that was rolled away
Let the rock that was rolled away
Let the rock that was rolled away be my cornerstone

Let this faith be my foundation 
This hope, my liberation
'Till I fly away on that glorious, glorious day 

'Till I stand upon that mountain 
'Till I sit beside the thrown 
'Till the waters of loves fountain carry me home
Till I rise up from this mortal clay of blood and bone

Matt Rollings,"Love makes me treat you

The way that I do
Gee baby, ain't I good to you

There's nothing in this whole world too good
For a boy so sweet and true
Gee, baby ain't I good to you

Bought you a fur coat for Christmas
Diamond ring
Big Cadillac car and everything
What makes me treat you

Matt Rollings,"If there ever was a time
That I could use your trust in me
And if there ever was a reason
For me to get down on my knees
And if there's any way (if there's any way)
That you could love me anyhow
If you ever had much faith in me
I could use a little now

When I said it would suit me fine
If you were out of sight and out of mind
That wasn't me talking
That was my wounded pride
When I said I didn't want your love
And you were no one I was thinking of
Believe me baby I lied

Well I got no good excuses
But I got plenty of regrets
And I wish this was some bad dream
I could wake up and forget
'Cause you're the only one (you're the only one)
That I could never stand to lose
You're all I've ever wanted
And baby that's the truth

Every time it opens
You don't know if you'll win or lose
You have to just let go

No I wasn't looking
It's funny how I found you
Just when I thought
I'd live my life alone

Maybe it's love
That I have longed for
Maybe it's love
I should be strong for
I'm tearing down the walls inside
I want to laugh, and cry and kiss
Maybe it's love
I miss

I've close my heart down
So many seasons
I didn't want to hurt again
I didn't want to try

So I turned myself to ice and stone
Said I don't need anyone
And nobody else
Would ever make me cry

Maybe it's love
I've run away from
Maybe it's love
Bringing me back home
I'm tearing down the walls inside
I want to laugh, and cry and kiss
Maybe it's love I miss

So put your arms around me now
Hold me tight
Show me how
No one has ever loved me more
I've waited for so long

Maybe it's love
Maybe I'm dreaming
Maybe it's love
I can believe in

Maybe it's love
Maybe it's love

I tell you I mean it

That you'd turn away romance

Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland

Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow

All at once I looked and you were gone
And now you're looking back at me
Searching for a way that we can be like we were before

Now I'm back to what I knew before you
Somehow the city doesn't look the same
I'd give my life for one more night
Of having you here to hold me tight; oh, please
Take me there again
Oh, oh

And I remember how you loved me
Time was all we had until the day we said goodbye
I remember every moment of those endless summer nights

I still recall the walks along the beaches
And the way your hair would glisten in the sun
Rising in the afternoon
Making love to you under the moon, oh

Do you remember all the nights we spent in silence
Every single breath you took was mine
We can have it all again
Say that you'll be with me when the sun brings your heart to mine
Oh, oh

And I remember how you loved me
Time was all we had until the day we said goodbye
I remember every moment of those endless summer nights

There's only so much I can say
So please don't run away from what we have together
It's only you and me tonight
So let's stay lost in flight
Oh, won't you please surrender

And I remember how you loved me
Time was all we had until the day we said goodbye
I remember every moment of those endless summer nights (Oh I remember)

Time was all we had until the day we said goodbye
I remember every moment of those endless summer nights",Endless Summer Nights,2008
Matt Scannell,"""My mother came to Hazard when I was just seven
Even then the folks in town said with prejudiced eyes
That boy's not right
Three years ago when I came to know Mary
First time that someone looked beyond the rumors and the lies
And saw the man inside

We used to walk down by the river
She loved to watch the sun go down
We used to walk along the river
And dream our way out of this town

No one understood what I felt for Mary
No one cared until the night she went out walking alone
And never came home
Man with a badge came knocking next morning
Here was I surrounded by a thousand fingers suddenly
Pointed right at me

I swear I left her by the river
I swear I left her safe and sound
I need to make it to the river
And leave this old Nebraska town

I think about my life gone by
And how it's done me wrong
There's no escape for me this time
All of my rescues are gone, long gone

I swear I left her by the river
I swear I left her safe and sound
I need to make it to the river
And leave this old Nebraska town",Hazard,2008
Matt Scannell,"Elusive happiness
Can be like promises
That rest so gently on our pillow
We stood out on the ledge
And leaned over the edge
And nearly fell right through that window
There were those who had us done by now
Baby, we've only just begun

The world may crash and burn
Or suddenly just cease to turn
But love goes on
It may look out of reach
And time may rob us like a thief
But love goes on
Our love goes on

No one may recognize
What lives behind our eyes
Sometimes the good times are the hardest
And when my strength is gone

It's you that I lean on
A light at the end of all my darkness
And in the end if I know nothing else
The answer is only in your arms

The world may crash and burn
Or suddenly just cease to turn
But love goes on
It may look out of reach

And time may rob us like a thief
But love goes on
And in the end if I know nothing else
The answer is right here in your arms
It's always in your arms

The world may crash and burn
Or suddenly just cease to turn
But love goes on
It may look out of reach

Trust in your heart to lead the way

I still recall a day so clear
I saw the future in my mother's eyes
Filled with tears of sorrow

The years roll by, the times do change
The truth around us harder to disguise
As we face tomorrow

So many promises were made me
So little hope remains alive
I only pray the dreams I leave you will survive

[Chorus]

You'll see what I'm saying
When you're on your own
The war that you're facing
Isn't yours alone

I'm a man in search of reasons
Though I am still as much to blame
It's up to me leave you more than just my name

This is your world now
No one can chase all your fears away
Fight for your world now
I know that somehow you'll find your way
Trust your heart to lead the way
This is your world now
I want to chase all your fears away
Fight for your world now
I know that somehow you'll find your way",Your World,2008
Matt Scannell,"Welcome to the big time.
You're bound to be a star
And even if you don't go all the way,
I know that you'll go far
This race is for rats, it can turn you upside down
Ain't no one you can count on in this sleazy little town, Oh no

Lots of promises in the dark
But don't you open your heart

Cause it don't mean nothin'
The words that they say
Don't mean nothin'
These games that people play
No, it don't mean nothin'
No victim, no crime
It don't mean nothin'
Till you sign it on the dotted line

The director smiles as you walk in the door
He says, ""I love your work, babe"" but
You're just not what we're looking for
It's never what but who it is you know
So easy to get stuck in all that California snow

Take a good look around and you'll find
People tryin' to mess with your mind

Cause it don't mean nothin'
The words that they say
Don't mean nothin'
These games that people play
No, it don't mean nothin'
No victim, no crime
It don't mean nothin'
Till you sign it on the dotted line

Hollywood can be so lonely
Make you the winner of a losing fight
But the party is never over
Cause stars are always shining
Doesn't matter if it's day or night

The producer says, ""let me change a line or two""
And a little bit of something can look awfully good to you
And you want to scream, but you gotta keep it all inside
When you're trying to make a living,
There ain't no such thing as pride, no

Lots of promises in the dark
But don't you open your heart

Cause it don't mean nothin'
The words that they say
Don't mean nothin'
These games that people play
No, it don't mean nothin'
No victim, no crime
It don't mean nothin'
Till you sign it on the dotted line

It don't mean nothing at all",Don't Mean Nothing,2011

From the battles that rage in my head
You make sense of madness
When my sanity hangs by a thread
I lose my way but still you seem to understand
Now and forever
I will be your man

Sometimes I just hold you
Too caught up in me to see
I'm holding a fortune
That heaven has given to me
I'll try to show you each and every way I can
Now and forever
I will be your man

Now I can rest my worries and always be sure
That I won't be alone anymore

Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I took for granted, all the times
That I thought would last somehow
I hear the laughter, I taste the tears
But I can't get near you now

Oh, can't you see it baby
You've got me going crazy

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I wonder how we can survive
This romance
But in the end if I'm with you
I'll take the chance

And not a promise that I didn't make

And now I'm wondering what I did wrong

Should've known better
Than to fall in love with you
Now love is just a faded memory
Should've known better
Now I'm a prisoner to this pain
And my heart still aches for you

I gave you all of my body and soul
Never believing we might lose control
I took my hands off the wheel

I can't remember if the lies were true
It's been a million years since I touched you
I thought time might help me win this game
But being away from you is slowly driving me insane

ever coming back.

Is she hid out with another
or is she trying to get back home?
Is she wrapped up in some other's arms?

Has she forgotten all about,

Is when I search for the light
Pick up my pen and start to write
I struggle, I fight dark forces in the clear moonlight
Without fear

Insomnia

I can't get no sleep

I used to worry
Thought I was going mad in a hurry
Getting stressed, making excess mess in darkness
No electricity, something's all over me, greasy
Insomnia please release me
And let me dream of making mad love to my girl on the heath
Tearing off tights with my teeth
But there's no release, no peace
I toss and turn without cease
Like a curse, open my eyes and rise like yeast
At least a couple of weeks since I last slept, kept taking sleepers
But now I keep myself pepped
Deeper still, that night
I write by candlelight, I find insight
Fundamental movement, huh, so when it's black
This insomniac, take an original tack
Keep the beast in my nature
Under ceaseless attack
I gets no sleep
I can't get no sleep

I can't get no sleep

Matt Skiba,"Your thoughts become your enemies
When you're locked inside this cage
Life can feel dead to me
And all that's left is rage

Regrets for all the time we wasted
Thinking of ourselves
Holding onto pain you tasted
Living in this hell

Don't wanna go back home tonight
So I drive this road alone

Stay alive for the good times
Stay alive through the bad
Stay alive for the hopes and the fears and the dreams
The best that we ever had
I keep telling myself I can take you
From this God-forsaken place
Stay alive for the good times
Stay alive through the bad

Stay alive

Your fear controls everything
Never let you turn the page (Let you turn the page)
We end up only settling
For when we both felt sane

Reaching out for something that
You can't quite hold onto
Say goodbye and start it over
When there's nothing left for you

Don't wanna go back home tonight
So I drive this road alone

Matt Skiba & the Sekrets,"I’ve got no place left but second best
Got no place left but down
Your love came like an aeroplane that crashed into the ground
In the ruins of this short term memory
Impending doom is softly haunting me.
I’ve made a mess; this party dress is torn and stained in blood.
Took my good name out of its cage,
You dragged it through the mud.
Through the darkness I will watch you through the lens,
Snapping photos for imaginary friends

All fall down for the last time dear
Slowly drown when you hold me down
I cried out, no one answers me
You lie down, laugh yourself to sleep

I’ve got nothing left but this regret
Got nothing left but shame
I took my heart out of its box I placed it in the flames
In the darkness I will watch you on TV
Through the violence and the bloodshed I will see

All fall down for the last time dear
Slowly drown when you hold me down
I cried out, no one answers me
You lie down, laugh yourself to sleep

You’re searching for the answers,
Out in the deep blue sea.
You’re spreading like a cancer,
Across my memory
Give me some radiation; give me some sense of relief.

All fall down, for the last time dear
All fall down, for the last time
All fall down, for the last time dear

This isn’t all my fault, love
I’m as blue as the sky was down at the lake this morning
Because our love was no lie
But it couldn’t keep a secret
And neither can I
And that is why I now sing this

Hey, I can’t hear a goddamn thing, above all the screaming
I can’t hear a goddamn thing, the anger’s deafening
I can’t hear a goddamn thing, no
I can’t hear a goddamn thing, not a word that you’re saying to me

Open your ears
Stop, drop, and roll and listen
We had fire for years, but now the sidewalks glisten
Our dreams were no lie; they just never seemed to come true
You say that I didn’t try, that I just up and left you

Keeps me captive at the helm
So it’s seemingly a matter of time as I slowly drift straight down to hell
Like a stone dropped in a well
It’s loudly pounding in this head of mine
Just like a hammer to a bell
And as it’s sounding the alarms to
Get in line in time we have our own sick tale to tell
From where our demons used to dwell

The end of joy
The death of truth came to destroy everything we knew
Lost in the void, forgotten youth
Fan the flames of the burning heart inside of you

This crimson dripping off these hands of mine
From all the time that I have killed
Wishing everything will turn out just fine,
‘til I clean up all the blood I’ve spilled.
Though you wait there soft and still,
You know damn well I never will

The death of truth came to destroy everything we knew
Lost in the void, forgotten youth

You wish to clip the wings of the soaring sparrow
And as your angels sing our hearts remain as feral
Felines on the front lines marching towards impending peril

And you said you’d believe me once I left for good
When we met up for drinks in the old neighborhood
I’ve got a sneaking suspicion you’ve learned your lesson just now

To the sound of the train and the scraping of chairs
And with tears in your eyes you cried, “i’m coming loose
at the seams and I scream when I think of you
I’ve got nothing but time, I’m losing my mind so I’m through.”

When we got lost as hell in that old photo booth

So you left and I fell
Trying to drop a new dime down the old wishing well
And I crept from my shell,
Tried to put my life savings on the end of it all

Like three blind bats lost in the light, with our destinies unclear,
We’re quiet as cathedral mice on lithium

Now I gotta level with you baby I’ve taken all that I can
You came and went and you left me crazy
Off in a far away land
Now I gotta level with you baby I am lost and alone

We’ve been spiraling downward now for days
Never once shed all my tears ‘til my sense of direction went away

I got a story to tell, here we go

Sit right back and hear a tale of a hustler 'round my way
He used to clock around the block from where my grandma stayed
Black BMW with rims to match, windows bulletproof
One night, he jumped out the car
And caught a bullet in his bubblegoose
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose

Oh yeah, and if you don't know, success brings stress
I'm vexed, my phone rings, collect caller from Jeff
The operator say, ""If you accept, say yes""
""Yes, what's the deal, son?""
""Yo, I got bad news""
Yo, by the tone of his voice, I heard the I'll street blues
""The friends will make you, them too can break you
They plan an execution like Fu Manchu""
""Who?""
""You know the character from channel 5 kung-fu (wahoo)""
""Slow down, man, Jeff, I'm losin' you""

""If not, at the funeral, you gotta play the harp""
Yo, why they wanna start and make me play my part?

You hear me Urkel, your blood will turn purple
Like the color, you holler, bawlin' for your mother
No-one hears you even though you knock
You used to walk around the block with the daily rock
Things done changed since your spark got hot
Now you got your knot wocked with your very own Glock

Sit right back and hear a tale of a hustler 'round my way
He used to clock around the block from where my grandma stayed
Black BMW with rims to match, windows bulletproof
One night, he jumped out the car
And caught a bullet in his bubblegoose
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose
You can be witcha girl gettin' loose
But you can catch a bullet in your goose
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose
You can be at the party gettin' loose
But you can catch a bullet in your goose",Bubblegoose,1998

All seem to say, ding dong, m'kay. 
Christmas is here, bringing good cheer, 
To young and old, meek and the bold.

With joyful ring, all caroling

Matt Stone,"Howdy folks, let's go for a ride
Get your favorite one to sit by your side
Cuddle up in a sleigh
Giddyap Nellie Grey
And away we go.

While you listen to the sleigh bells ring
You're yodeling to your baby
You'll feel nice and warm
no matter how cold it may be

Take a look at little Jack and Jill
They ski down a hill that's a snowplow turn
And look there's a spill
There's a spill on the hill 
When you're down it's a thrill to go up again.

Ev'rybody ought to learn to ski for that is how we first met
We were that Jack and Jill that came down a hill,
When I looked at you my hearttook a spill
Took a spill on a hill
It's a thrill that I can't forget

It Happened In Sun Valley not so very long ago
There were sunbeams in the snow
and a twinkle in your eye
I remember oh so clearly
that you nearly passed me by

Then It Happened In Sun Valley
when you slipped and fell and so did I
Now ev'ry year we go back
and then we recall that fall and that moment
When we were there on a hill
So we both take a spill and we're Jack and Jill again.

Matt Stone,"I heard there is no Christmas
In the silly Middle East
No trees, no snow, no Santa Claus
They have different religious beliefs

They believe in Muhammad
And not in our holiday
And so every December
I go to the Middle East and say

""Hey there Mr. Muslim
Merry fucking Christmas
Put down that book the Koran
And hear some holiday wishes.

In case you haven't noticed
It's Jesus's birthday.
So get off your heathen Muslim ass
and fucking celebrate.

There is no holiday season in India I've heard
They don't hang up their stockings
And that is just absurd!

They've never read a Christmas story.
They don't know what Rudolph is about
And that is why in December
I'll go to India and shout

Hey there Mr. Hinduist
Merry fucking Christmas
Drink eggnog and eat some beef
And pass it to the missus.

In case you haven't noticed
It's Jesus's birthday
So get off your heathen Hindu ass
and fucking celebrate!

Now I heard that in Japan
Everyone just lives in sin
They pray to several gods
And put needles in their skin.

On December 25th
All they do is eat a cake
And that is why I go to Japan
And walk around and say

Hey there Mr. Shintoist
Merry fucking Christmas
God is going to kick your ass
You infidelic pagan scum.

In case you haven't noticed
There's festive things to do
So lets all rejoice for Jesus
And Merry fucking Christmas to you.

On Christmas day I travel `round the world and say,
Taoists, Krishnas, Buddhists, and all you atheists too,
Merry Fucking Christmas, To You!

Thank you Mr. hat",Merry Fucking Christmas,1999

The Virgin Mary was sleeping
When Angel Gabriel appeared.
He said, ""you are to be the virgin mother,""
And Mary thought that was weird.
[Mary said, ""I'm not a virgin
I blew a guy last year""]
But then, Gabriel said to Mary,
""My child, have no fear:

[""'Cause you can suck all the dick you want]
And still be a Virgin, Mary.
[You can suck all the dick you want,]
And still not be considered flawed.
[Though, Mary, you went to town,
and sucked some semen down,]
You're still still a virgin
In the eyes of god!""

There was no room at the Inn
When Mary and Joseph did arrive.
They were so very tired, you see,
[and Mary had to offer him a bribe.]
Said she had no money,
[and they had no place to sleep.]
Gabriel appeared to Mary,
And told her not to weep.

[""'Cause you can suck all the dick you want]
And still be a Virgin, Mary.
[you can suck all the dick you want]
And still be the mother of Christ.
If there's no room at the Inn,
then it's not considered a sin
[to suck a dick to get a room for free!""]

That's right

And three wisemen did appear
Bearing gifts of myrrh and such.
They said that they had followed a star,
And missed a woman's touch.
[Mary thought that she might pleasure them,
But could not take them to bed.]
But, again, Gabriel appeared to her
And this is what he said

[""You can suck all the dick you want,]
And still be a Virgin, Mary.
[You can suck all the dick you want,]
Everyone in the nation.
[Fellatio ain't no sin,
So go and blow those three wise men!]
And you'll still be a virgin,
['Cause there ain't no penetration!""]

[You can suck all the dick you want,]
And still be a Virgin, Mary!
[The donkey, or the ox and the lamb]
And even the little drummer boy.
Folks will remember your name quick!
[They'll say, ""Damn, that bitch can suck a dick""!]
['Cause sucking dick]
Brings peace on earth and joy.
['Cause sucking dick]
Brings peace on earth and joy.

Let nothing you dismay
Remember, Christ our Saviour
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power

When we were gone astray
O, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O, tidings of comfort and joy

In Bethlehem, in Israel
This blessed Babe was born
And laid within a manger
Upon this blessed morn
The which His Mother Mary

Did nothing take in scorn
O, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O, tidings of comfort and joy

From God our Heavenly Father
A blessed Angel came
And unto certain Shepherds
Brought tidings of the same
How that in Bethlehem was born

The Son of God by Name
O, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O, tidings of comfort and joy

""Fear not then,"" said the Angel
""Let nothing you affright
This day is born a Saviour
Of a pure Virgin bright

To free all those who trust in Him
From Satan's power and might""
O, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O, tidings of comfort and joy

The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind
And left their flocks a-feeding
In tempest, storm and wind
And went to Bethlehem straightway

The Son of God to find
O, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O, tidings of comfort and joy

And when they came to Bethlehem
Where our dear Saviour lay
They found Him in a manger
Where oxen feed on hay
His Mother Mary kneeling down

Unto the Lord, did pray
O, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O, tidings of comfort and joy

Now to the Lord, sing praises
All you within this place
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace

This holy tide of Christmas
All other doth deface
O, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O, tidings of comfort and joy

Make crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain
Waste your summer praying in vain
For a savior to rise from these streets

All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood
With a chance to make it good somehow

And I know you're lonely for words that I ain't spoken
But tonight we'll be free, all the promises'll be broken

There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away
They haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned-out Chevrolets
They scream your name at night in the street
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet
And in the lonely cool before dawn
You hear their engines rolling on
But when you get to the porch, they're gone on the wind

Thoughts on what's ahead asking
What if, and why not, and who's to say?
When all I really know of you
Is you're just as lonely too
'Cause desperate hearts are hearts that need someone, and

And I'm sure that you'll find
That's now how

Like an old stray dog 
It won't leave you alone

It's just another day

No it's not the end

I found a sunny spot so I could work on my tan

From out of nowhere it came pouring down again 

Cause sometimes it rains 
All over your parade 
It's like you're reaching for the sun, 
And you're landing in the shade

You were meant for so much more than this 
I promise this

And I'm always thinking of you
Take a look around you

I love you more than the sun
And the stars that I taught how to shine
You are mine and you shine for me too
I love you
Yesterday
And today
And tomorrow
I'll say it again and again
I love you more

Just a face in the city
Just a tear on a crowded street
But you are one in a million
And you belong to me

Let's hope it's a good one without any fears.

We were together all the way
An endless path unbroken
But now there is a time
A torture less sublime

Once we were years ahead but now those thoughts are dead

Let me go
I walk alone and yet I never say goodbye

The best of everything

When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out

Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

And may I say, not in a shy way

I did it my way""

If not himself, then he has naught

An airline ticket to romantic places

Semblable et différent dire et faire semblant
Faire comme si l’on portait tous le même vêtement

Voir la différence entre la pose et la prose

Et cette vie m’étreint, me teint couleur lunaire quand je brille au-dedans comme un néon
Il faudrait juste que ce soleil de glace puisse s’éteindre comme on éteindrait un néon x2

Au fond suis-je en accord avec ce qu’il y a au fond de moi
Est-ce moi ou un autre lorsque je baisse les bras
C’est peu dire que mes manquements m’obsèdent

Craindre et espérer si demain devenait 
Se changeait en bien plus qu’une simple idée

Et la lumière illumine quand l’ego se déchire 

Et le temps nous dira qui a raison x2

Alimente cette lumière dans ma poitrine
Je suis un laser pas un looser

Let nothing you dismay
Remember, Christ our Saviour
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power

When we were gone astray
O, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O, tidings of comfort and joy

In Bethlehem, in Israel
This blessed Babe was born
And laid within a manger
Upon this blessed morn
The which His Mother Mary

Did nothing take in scorn
O, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O, tidings of comfort and joy

From God our Heavenly Father
A blessed Angel came
And unto certain Shepherds
Brought tidings of the same
How that in Bethlehem was born

The Son of God by Name
O, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O, tidings of comfort and joy

""Fear not then,"" said the Angel
""Let nothing you affright
This day is born a Saviour
Of a pure Virgin bright

To free all those who trust in Him
From Satan's power and might""
O, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O, tidings of comfort and joy

The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind
And left their flocks a-feeding
In tempest, storm and wind
And went to Bethlehem straightway

The Son of God to find
O, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O, tidings of comfort and joy

And when they came to Bethlehem
Where our dear Saviour lay
They found Him in a manger
Where oxen feed on hay
His Mother Mary kneeling down

Unto the Lord, did pray
O, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O, tidings of comfort and joy

Now to the Lord, sing praises
All you within this place
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace

This holy tide of Christmas
All other doth deface

And you try to make amends
But you're better off as friends.

That's how much, that's how much.

How's your life been goin' on?
I've got a wife now. Years we've been goin' strong.
There's just something that I've got to say:
Sometimes when we make love,
I still can see your face.
Ooh, just try to recall
When we were as one, yeah.

That's how much I feel, feel for you, baby.
How much I need, well I need your touch.
How much I live, I live for your loving.

I guess we'll never know
To this distant ever-after...you didn't want to go
Were we blinded by a reason?
Watching days refuse to shine...to darkness from divine
Such a pity for this lover...you left behind
I never wanted anybody else
I never needed you, I needed help
After the feeling's gone...so long, because it's over
Not a healthy situation...push me over, hold me down
To see if I would drown
Was I waiting for an answer I didn't want to know?
I never wanted anybody else
I never needed you, I needed help
After the feeling's gone...so long, because it's over

You wanted this to be
Sleeping eyes are open wide
You say...you're the one to blame
And we've been here too many times...but I want you still, the same
I want to know you...the simple, salacious
Your undefiled and devious, insatiable ways

So look into these eyes and never wonder if they'd lie
Or lead you away to fearful places

You say you're the one that's changed

We only pray that this time we'll see it turn around...we'll see it turn around
This time...dreams we'll realize
And who was I to walk away from you
And who were you to wonder why
For I could place a million faces on the shoulders of my pain...
And I do
But time continues on the broken road...
And treasures wait for those who find
Among the thistles grow the promises unending souls desire...
And thoughts that maybe this time...

Something you could bring to me
Now that something in the past is coming back again...you'll see
Where did you go?...what did it mean?
I try to remember you...it's hard to believe
The beauty if fading...and silence has ceased
Where did you go?...bring it back to me

Was it a dream for me to think I could please you for a while?
It won't let me get away...and I don't want to leave if this is true
Where did you go?...what did it mean?

Where did you go?...bring it back to me

You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Matthew Bellamy,"""For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence: on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly-knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations. Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised.""",[JFK],2015

Always timid, never took a chance

Those lips, that nose, those eyes
Could lead to my demise

How could this happen?
The show was lousy and long, we did everything wrong
Where did we go right?

And guess who they stuffed in our stocking? Adolf Hitler!
It was so crass and so crude even Goebbels would've booed
Where did we go right?

Last night a star was born on Broadway the lovely Miss Ulla
Inga Hansen Bensen Yonsen Tallen-Hallen Svaden-Svanson
We predict that her name will soon be up in lights
If they can find enough bulbs

We searched Broadway on and off
For singers with a cough
We had tryouts and auditions by the score
And to trip the light fantastic
We picked dancers who were spastic
If anyone jetted, we jetted them out the door

They shouted hooray for that sausage on display
Where did we go right?
Our leading man was so gay he nearly flew away
Where did we go right?
A show so easy to despise
Now it's up for the Pulitzer prize
Oh, where, oh, where, tell us
Where did we go right?

The best new music of the decade!
Max Bialystock is a theatrical genius!
Now they like me

Oh, we knew we couldn't lose
Half the audience were Jews
It's the end of our careers
It'll run for twenty years
Tell us where did we go right?

Matthew Broderick,"And I just want to wish everybody, good luck
Mr. Bloom, hasn't anyone ever told you
It's bad luck to say, ""Good luck"" on opening night

If you do, I tell you
It is certain by the curtain
You are through

Good luck

It's bad luck to say, ""Good luck"" on opening night
Once it's said, you are dead
You will get the worst reviews
You've ever read

Good luck

Even at the Comedie-Francaise
On the opening night they are scared
""Bon chance, mes amis,"" no one says
The only word you ever hear is
Merde

Good luck, good luck, good luck

It's verboten, wishing luck on opening night
Take advice, don't think twice
Or your show will surely end
Up in the Scheiss

Guten lucken

At the famous La Scala in Milan
On opening night it's a rule
In Boccu Lupa they say with Elan
And just for luck they all shout
""Bah fongool""

I got it, now I'll never say
""Good luck"" on opening night
That's the rule, I'm no fool
What do I say, I beg?

What you say is,
""Break a leg""
Break a leg?
Yes, break a leg

If you're clever
Good luck
You'll endeavor
To never, never, never, never
Ever, ever, ever say
On opening night

Matthew Brown,"Why are there so many songs about rainbows and what's on the other side?
Rainbows are visions, but only illusions
And rainbows have nothing to hide
So we've been told and some choose to believe it
I know they're wrong wait and see
 
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me
Who said that wishes would be heard and answered
When wished on the morning star?
 
Someone thought of that and someone believed it
Look what it's done so far
What's so amazing that keeps us stargazing
And what do we think we might see?
 
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me
All of us under its spell
We know that it's probably magic
Have you been half asleep and have you heard voices?
I've heard them calling my name
 
Is this the sweet sound that calls the young sailors
The voice might be one and the same
 
I've heard it too many times to ignore it
It's something that I'm supposed to be
 
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection,
The lovers, the dreamers and me
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection,
The lovers, the dreamers and me",Rainbow Connection,2010
Matthew Brubeck,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,1990
Matthew Brubeck,"I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in 
And stops my mind from wandering 
Where it will go 

I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door 
And kept my mind from wandering 
Where it will go 

And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right 
Where I belong I'm right 
Where I belong. 

See the people standing there who disagree and never win 
And wonder why they don't get in my door 
I'm painting my room in the colourful way 

And when my mind is wandering 
There I will go 
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right 
Where I belong I'm right 
Where I belong. 

Silly people run around they worry me 
And never ask me why they don't get past my door

I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her

Matthew Caws,"She writes songs at night
After everyone has turned out the lights
Though she's still young
She's had a hard life
And she's not giving up believing in fate

The family home it's like living in a war zone
Holes are punched in walls
But no one seems to care at all

She's such a beautiful girl
And she lives in an ugly world
She's such a beautiful girl
And she lives in an ugly world

So she shuts her door and she writes and dreams
It's her favorite escape
And she knows it can only get better
So with patience she waits

No one ever had her back
They only laugh when she cries
But in God's eyes

I've seen the look in his eyes
He's in love and hypnotized.

There's already been a flood of my tears.

We go to a party and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady that's walking around with me
And then she asks me, Do you feel all right?

Is that you just don't realize how much I love you

In a garage by the motorway

To a pawn on a Christmas day

Said God is dead and war's begun
Alvin Tostig has a son today

And he shall be Levon

Sits on the porch swing watching them fly

Since your loving heart has loved someone
When I touched that, you knew so well, it's gone
Look forward to the future, to the secrets yet known
I'll be the witness to the searching or the love you've yet to show
And I promise you, the hardest days are gone
I can show you that us two must go on
Our courses, we are horses, remorseless for what we've done
And I know one day, baby, I'll find you gone
But today I'm gonna love you like that day will never come

I need a witness for the love that's yet to come
A future secret that we both can't outrun

I know one day I might find you gone
So I'm gonna love you like the day will never come

Did you tell them what they wanted to know?
Did you show them what I wanted to show, too

Nowhere left worth
Running to
And it's hopeless at best

Nothing new

From a smoke stack
Helplessly floating from embers

Troubled at best boy
Another decoy
Tipping my hat to the man
Fanning the flame

So tell me how they got me to crack you
Did you really think you could trust
Such a man with a head full of rust, too

As it was coming undone
I could have told you to run

Waves crash against the coast

Are still haunting me
Though the blinds have long been drawn
Or whatever went on
In that old summer home by the sea

So farewell
To the crabs and shells

And the rush of nicotine
And the boat we set free in the bay
As the moon tugs upon the tide

Matthew Garber,"Jane Banks: 
[Spoken] 
Wanted a nanny for two adorable children 

[Sung] 
If you want this choice position 
Have a cheery disposition 
Rosy cheeks, no warts! 
Play games, all sort 

You must be kind, you must be witty 
Very sweet and fairly pretty 
Take us on outings, give us treats 
Sing songs, bring sweets 

Never be cross or cruel 
Never give us castor oil or gruel 
Love us as a son and daughter 
And never smell of barley water 

If you won't scold and dominate us 
We will never give you cause to hate us 
We won't hide your spectacles 
So you can't see 
Put toads in your bed 
Or pepper in your tea 
Hurry, Nanny! 
Many thanks 
Sincerely,

And while every gtain tears you apart stay done up the best

Where traded up to new distinctions puts justice in your shells
Take one for the team and that pretty lady used to cover
Up the smell

In uniform with two white stripes 

Unlock my section of the sand

I clamp a gasmask on my head

Bathe in my moonlight 

Another tanker's hit the rocks
Abandoned to spill out its guts
The sand is laced with sticky glops 

O' Shimmering moonlight sheen upon
The waves and water clogged with oil
White gases steam up from the soil

Try not to step on any bones

Switch off all that I own below

From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Colored blocks, and wars to win.
I draw, and I dream, and beat my drums up there.

There are circus lights and maple leaves.
There are daffodils and dogwood trees.

Now the coffee's strong,
And the fruit's all wrong,
And my wakeup call's for somebody else.

Always keep my laughing at myself.

And he knows she's the only thing 
That will ever stop the pain.
He stands there naked in the light giving all he's got.
Most folks don't understand that
We're no different than the rocks and stones.

To the evolution man she said,
""I got a funny feelin' that I'm headed somewhere new and
There ain't no use in stealin' your sweet sweet dream from you
'cause I know you'll find what you want if I set you free

And I'll still be here if you find 
That what you want is me,
'cause it's a long and lonely road.
I know you're doing what you can
But I never thought it would be so hard to love
The evolution man.
You're an evolution man.""",Evolution Man,1995
Matthew Kahler,"My time is your time after all that
You've been through can you hear me calling
You and this line that I'm walking time it's
Pointing write to you I'm living my life with

You so call on me I'll guard myself just wait
And see  I'll start a brand new now This time
Is the last time for me my life is in your
Hands you can take me all the way this

Its better days",This Time/Last Time,1995
Matthew Kaminski,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

It might as well be spring",It Might as Well Be Spring,2010
Matthew Kaminski,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when",Where or When,2010

Under the weight of a heavy heart
It’s so material, criminal, what we put up on a pedestal
Need a spark to start a fire
Don’t be afraid of a chance for a miracle
Scare it away being cynical
Step into open skies, close your eyes
Jump into something you don’t recognize
Just reach your arms out wide

Cut me loose, my parachute won’t let me fly
I’ll survive 'cause we got love
Summer days will fade away and pass us by
But we’ll survive 'cause we got love
Think of what we had, we got love
And it’s all we had, we got love
Think of what we had, we got love

I’ll be the voice when the whispers get too loud
Your home base and the king that keeps you crowned
Your breath when you’re choking on your words
Your sex your right turn
When you’re ready to start, lean on my heart baby
Close your eyes just reach your arms out wide

Cut me loose, my parachute won’t let me fly
I’ll survive 'cause we got love
Summer days will fade away and pass us by
But we’ll survive 'cause we got love
Think of what we had, we got love
And it’s all we had, we got love
Think of what we had, we got love

Don ‘t need a tune with a view on the Westside
Just wanna wake up at your side
'cause when you know it, you know it
In the blink of a moment
It’s like I‘m, like I‘m, like I’m falling for the first time

Cut me loose, my parachute won’t let me fly
I’ll survive 'cause we got love
Summer days will fade away and pass us by

But she still may never be sold on the heart of this place
Sweet was her mother and kind was her brother
But neither would meet face to face

Don’t give up now
Don’t’ give up now cos’ we’re already
Don’t give up now
Don’t give up now
We’re just facing our fears

Sing til you mean it
And love til you feel it
'Cause I still believe in your heart
Don’t let the waves push and pull you away
Now you’re free and it sets you apart
Now you’re free and it sets you apart

With anxious devotion and hearts set in motion
We won’t have to go this alone
I need to you feel it
Send kisses to seal
And walk with me all the way home

Don’t give up now
Don’t give up now cos’ we’re already here

Sing til you mean it
And love til you feel it
'Cause I still believe in your heart
Don’t let the waves push and pull you away
Now you’re free and it sets you apart
Now you’re free and it sets you apart

It’s too late to come back home
And you’re always on your own

Matthew Mayfield,"Where am I headed?
Got my back against the wall
Can’t move on, can’t move forward
When I’m up against it all
For you, I know
I must let you go
Everybody waits in line
For you

Tonight
I feel like giving up this right
Oh this right
Tonight
I don’t feel like filling up the ocean, the openness in you

I’ve got my ideas
And they’re turning circles in a song
Cover my eyes, keep my ears closed
But you’re been singing all along
But you don’t know
I can let you go

Tonight
I feel like giving up this right
Oh this right
Tonight
I don’t feel like filling up the ocean, the openness in you

These reasons, these reasons they’re calling
I don’t wanna make this mistake
These demons, these demons they’re falling, they’re falling

Oh this right

Matthew McVaney,"I thought I knew you from somewhere
Right when you walked through the door
So, please forgive me for staring
It's driving me crazy where I’ve seen you before
Maybe it's the white t-shirt that you're wearing
The danger in your eyes or your fingers in your hair
It's a pretty small town, it's coming to me now
Whoa, I just figured it out

You look a lot like my next boyfriend
I can't believe how much you act like him
You and me, we'd be unbelievable
And I'm available
No, I don't think it's a coincidence
I put it all together, it makes sense
Boy, you ain't no fling or a could've been
'Cause you look a lot like my next boyfriend

You should probably come over
Tell me your name and I’ll tell you mine
I'll probably give you my number
And you can call me anytime
I hope you like red lips, driveway kissing
‘Cause if you want it baby, that's what you'll be getting
Every night, all of the time
Whoa, I hope that's alright

You look a lot like my next boyfriend
I can't believe how much you act like him
You and me, we'd be unbelievable
And I'm available
No, I don't think it's a coincidence
I put it all together, it makes sense
Boy, you ain't no fling or a could've been
'Cause you look a lot like my next boyfriend

Next boy, next boyfriend
You look a lot like my next boyfriend
Next boy, next boyfriend

I thought I knew you from somewhere
Right when you walked through the door

You look a lot like my next boyfriend

Matthew Moon,"The minute I saw you
I wanted to hold you
But I kept it inside and my foolish pride
I wish that I'd told you
 
Why can't you be mine
And spend all of my time
I've so much to give and one life to live
I can't be without you
 
[Chorus]
If only I could be the one
To love you forever
If only I could be the one
To cherish forever
 
Don't know if we're coming or going
I just don't know what to do
And so scared to walk away without knowing ooh
 
What can I tell you
I just can't ignore you
Could I be the one, just let me be the one
Someone you can run to
 
[Chorus]
 
Too many words left unspoken, spoken
Girl I promise you your heart won't be broken no no
If you're looking for some love and affection
Then you're looking in the right direction
 
I wanna cherish you cherish you baby
Anyway you want me to
Cherish you, cherish you darling
For the rest of my life
Cherish you baby ooh yes I will
Cherish you darling
 
[Chorus]",One,1999
Matthew Morrison,"They say it's a man's world
Well, that cannot be denied
But what good's a man's world
Without a woman by his side
And so I will wait
Until that moment you decide

That I'm your man and you're my girl
That I'm the sea and you're the pearl
It takes two, baby, it takes two

A king ain't a king
Without the pow'r behind the throne
A prince is a pauper, babe
Without a chick to call his own
So please, darling, choose me
I don't wanna rule alone, tell me

I'm your king and you're my queen
That no one else can come between
It takes two, baby, it takes two

Don't you know, Lancelot had Guinevere
Mrs. Claus has old St. Nick
Romeo had Juliet
And Liz, well, she has her Dick

They say it takes two to tango
Well, that tango's child's play
So take me to the dance floor
And we'll twist the night away

Just like Frankie Avalon
Had his favorite mouseketeer
I dream of a lover, babe
To say the things I long to hear
So come closer baby
Oh, and whisper in my ear

Tell me, you're my girl and I'm your boy
That you're my pride and I'm your joy
I'm the sand and you're the tide
I'll be the groom if you'll be my bride
It takes two, baby, it takes two
It takes two, baby, it takes two

",It Takes Two,2002
Matthew Morrison,"Psst, Penny, what happened?
My mother's punishing me for going to jail without permission
Well, I'm here to save the fair maiden in her tower
Oh, Seaweed, Tracy, you took beautiful behind bars

It must be the low-watt institutional lighting
Oh Tracy, they can keep us from kissing
But they can't stop us from singing

Once I was a selfish fool who never understood
I never looked inside myself, though on the outside, I looked good
Then we met and you made me the man I am today
Tracy, I'm in love with you, no matter what you weigh 'cause

Without love, life is like the seasons with no summer
Without love, life is rock 'n' roll without a drummer
Tracy, I'll be yours forever 'cause I never wanna be without love
Tracy, never set me free, no, I ain't lyin', never set me free, Tracy
No, no, no

Once I was a simple girl, then stardom came to me
But I was still a nothing, though a thousand fans may disagree
Tracy, fame was just a prison, signing autographs a bore
I didn't have a clue 'til you came banging on my door

That without love, life is like my dad without his bromo
Without love, life is making out with Perry Como
Darling, I'll be yours forever 'cause I never wanna be without love
So darling, throw away the key, I'm yours forever
Throw away the key, yeah, yeah, yeah

Living in the ghetto, black is everywhere ya go
Who'd 've thought I'd love a girl with skin as white as winter's snow
In my ivory tower, life was just a hostess snack
But now I've tasted chocolate and I'm never going back

'Cause without love, life is like a beat that you can't follow without love
Life is Doris day at the Apollo, darling, I'll be yours forever
'Cause i never wanna be without love, so darling, never set me free
I'm yours forever, never set me free, no, no, no

If you're locked up in this prison, Trace, I don't know what I'll do
Link, I've got to break out, so that I can get my hands on you
And girl, if I can't touch you, now, I'm gonna lose control
Seaweed, you're my black white knight, I've found my blue-eyed soul
Sweet freedom is our goal
Trace, I wanna kiss ya, then I can't wait for parole

'Cause without love, life is like a prom that won't invite us without love
Life's getting my big break and laryngitis
Without love, life's a '45' when you can't buy it without love
Life is like my mother on a diet

Like a week that's only Mondays, only ice cream, never sundaes
Like a circle with no center, like a door marked, 'Do Not Enter'
'Cause I never wanna be without love
Yes, now you've captured me without love
I surrender happily, without love

Oh seaweed, never set me free, no, no, no
No, I ain't lyin', never set me free, no, no, no
No, I don't wanna live without love, love, love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, darling, you had best believe me
Never leave me without love

Matthew Morrison,"Younger than springtime are you
Softer than starlight are you
Warmer than winds of June
Are the gentle lips you gave me

Gayer than laughter are you
Sweeter than music are you
Sunlight and moon beans
Heaven and earth
Are you to give me
And when your youth and joy
Invade my soul
And fill my heart
As now they do, then

Younger than springtime am I
Gayer than laughter am I
Sunlight and moon beans
Heaven and earth

Matthew Morrison,"Young teacher, the subject of school girl fantasy
She wants him so badly, knows what she wants to be

Matthew Morrison,"My love,
There's only you in my life
The only thing that's right

My first love,
You're every breath that I take
You're every step I make

And I (I-I-I-I-I) I want to share
All my love with you
No one else will do

And your eyes (your eyes, your eyes)

They tell me how much you care
Ooh yeah, you will always be
My endless love

Two hearts,
Two hearts that beat as one
Our lives have just begun

Forever (oh)
I'll hold you close in my arms
I can't resist your charms

And love (oh, love)
I'll be a fool
For you, I'm sure
You know I don't mind
Oh, you know I don't mind

'Cause you,
You mean the world to me
Oh
I know (I know)
I've found (I've found) in you

Boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom

Ooh, and love (oh, love)
I'll be that fool
For you, I'm sure
You know I don't mind
Oh you know
I don't mind

And, yes you'll be the only one

This love I have inside
And I'll give it all to you
