Hubert-Félix Thiéfaine,"Tous les deux on pousse nos haillons 
Dans un igloo à bon marché 
Sous les toits d'une masure bidon 
En compagnie des araignées 
Toi tu vis ta vie d'alcoolique 
Entre ces quatre murs lamentables 
Moi je bricole et je fabrique 
Des chansons qui sont invendables 

Twiste et chante, moi je flippe 
Twiste et chante, moi je flippe 

On bouffe une fois tous les trois jours 
Avec des boîtes de cassoulet
Qu'on arrive à paner en douce 
Dans leurs superbes supermarchés 
Et quand on est à bout de fric 
Tu fous le camp chez les émigrés 
Leur faire découvrir l'Amérique 
Dans des passes non déclarées 

Twiste et chante, moi je flippe 
Twiste et chante, moi je flippe 

Et quand je m'en vais prendre l'air 
Du côté des femmes faciles 
Tu te jettes sur la bouteille d'éther 
Pour ton vol plané à 2000 
On ne s'aime plus d'amour et d'eau fraîche 
La vue de l'eau te fait hurler
Et notre amour à coups de dèche 
S'est peu à peu désintégré 

Twiste et chante, moi je flippe 
Twiste et chante, moi je flippe 

On vit comme ça par habitude 
Et surtout parce que c'est pratique 
De pallier la solitude 
En buvant à la même barrique 
Ca peut durer jusqu'à toujours 
A moins que l'on ait le courage 
De se dire merde un beau jour 
Et de mettre fin au naufrage 

Twiste et chante, moi je flippe
Twiste et chante, moi je flippe","La Dèche, Le Twist Et Le Reste",2018

Hurry up a bit

[Chorus: Repeat x3]
I like the way you do it, when you do it
When you doin, what you doin

Check this out right here, son
We about to move to make you feel some
A lot of positive vibrations to build from
Cause all I wanna do is lose some and win some
Have a little of prosperity and then some
Livin my life handsome, has always been a dream but
Now it's time to really achieve by all means (Bust it)
I keep my shit, plus thirty in between
When an arm reach out to grab the supreme
Cause I won't stop, and AP won't stop
And Tab won't stop until we reach the top
That means we won't quit, so we stay thick so you can enjoy it
I know you like the way it's goin down, honey, honey
I know you like the milky-mellow sound, honey, honey
Doin this ain't all about money, money
I know you like the way I sound, right, right

[Chorus: Repeat x4]

As I enter the room I absorb the mood
Positive vibe supplied by a positive crew
And negativity exist and you must acknowledge
You can be intelligent and never go to college
Cause the way we live in society
It ain't really the way that it's supposed to be
And don't get close to me if you're contaminated
Take a picture of your soul and get it laminated
Put them in your wallet next to your money
Money represents your whole and soul represents your honey
Ain't got honey then you ain't got bees
And if you ain't got no money I'ma still MC
Then empty L-O-V-E all over the track
Once you R-E-D then you never go back
'Til the end of studio with the Peas as Black
With Adam, Taboo, and alligator APL De AP

[Chorus: Repeat x4]

I wanna travel the world and stop on every city
Rejuvenate your burnt out sea put down your Philly for a sec
Close your eyes and don't fret
Listen to the audible sounds and just let
Your soul feel the free feelin
Reprovide you with the ride, free fallin
To make your heart beat, skip, hypnotize you and
APL take you on a trip where your mind's at ease
Forget ballin 'cause I won't quit, and Will won't quit
And Tab won't quit so you can enjoy it
That means we won't stop
And I won't stop until we reach the top
I'd rather be ready for the future
Do it for yourself 'cause no one else will suit ya
I juxtapose for mine to maintain
And segregate myself from evil and pain

Huckleberry Flint,"Traveling down this long lonesome highway
I'm so lonesome I could cry
Memories of how we once loved each other
And now we are saying good-bye.

On and on I'll follow my darling
And I wonder where she can be
On and on I'll follow my darling
And I wonder if she ever thinks of me.

I've cried I've cried for you little darling
It breaks my heart to hear your name
My friends they also love you my darling
And they think that I am to blame.

I have to follow you my darling
I can't sleep when the sun goes down
By your side is my destination
The road is clear and that's where I'm bound.

Huddie Ledbetter,"Yonder comes Miss Rosie.  How in the world do you know?
Well, I know her by the apron and the dress she wore.
Umbrella on her shoulder, piece of paper in her hand,
Well, I'm callin' that Captain, ""Turn a-loose my man.""

Let the Midnight Special shine her light on me.
Oh let the Midnight Special shine her ever-lovin' light on me.

When you gets up in the morning, when that big bell ring.
You go marching to the table, you meet the same old thing.
Knife and fork are on the table, ain't nothing in my pan.
And if you say a thing about it, you have a trouble with the man. 

Let the Midnight Special shine her light on me.
Oh let the Midnight Special shine her ever-lovin' light on me.

If you ever go to Houston, boy, you better walk right,
And you better not squabble and you better not fight.
Benson Crocker will arrest you, Jimmy Boone will take you down.
You can bet your bottom dollar that you're Sugarland bound. 

Let the Midnight Special shine her light on me.
Oh let the Midnight Special shine her ever-lovin' light on me.

Well, jumping Little Judy, she was a mighty fine girl.
She brought jumping to this whole round world.
Well, she brought it in the morning just a while before day.
Well, she brought me the news that my wife was dead.
That started me to grieving, whooping, hollering, and crying.
And I began to worry about my very long time.

Oh let the Midnight Special shine her ever-lovin' light on me.",The Midnight Special,2012
Huddie Ledbetter,"Now this here's a story about the Rock Island Line
Well the Rock Island Line she runs down into New Orleans
There's a big tollgate down there and you know
If you got certain things on board when you go through the tollgate

Well you don't have to pay the man no toll
Well a train driver he pulled up to the tollgate
And a man hollered and asked him what all he had on board and said
I got livestock I got livestock I got cows I got pigs I got sheep

I got mules I got all livestock
Well he said you're all right boy you don't have to pay no toll
You can just go right on through so he went on through the toolgate
And as he went through he started pickin' up a little bit of speed

Pickin' up a little bit of steam
He got on through he turned and looked back at the man he said
Well I fooled you I fooled you I got pigiron I got pigiron I got old 
Pig iron

Down the Rock Island Line she's a mighty good road
Rock Island Line it's a road to ride
Rock Island Line it's a mighty good road
Well if you ride you got to ride it like you finally get your ticket 

At the station for the Rock Island Line

Looked cloudy in the west and it looked like rain
Round the curve came a passenger train
North bound train on the southbound track 
He's alright a leavin' but he won't be back

Well the Rock Island Line she's a mighty good road
Rock Island Line it's a road to ride
Rock Island Line it's a mighty good road
Well if you ride you got to ride it 
Like you finally get your ticket 
At the station for the Rock Island Line

Oh I may be right and I may be wrong 
But you gonna miss me when I'm gone
Well the engineer said before he died
There were two more drinks that he'd like to try
The conductor said what could they be 
A hot cup of coffee and a cold glass of tea

Well the Rock Island Line she's a mighty good road
Rock Island Line it's a road to ride
Rock Island Line it's a mighty good road
Well if you ride you got to ride it 
Like you finally get your ticket

18, 19--20 years ago,
Took my gal to the country store,
Took my gal to the country store,
Buy m' pretty little gal little calico.

Me and my gal walkin' down the road,
Her knees knock together playin' ""Sugar In The Gourd"",
Sugar in the gourd and the gourd in the ground,
If you want a little sugar got to roll the gourd around.

My old man's good old man
Washed his face in a frying pan,
Combed his hair with a wagon wheel,
And died with a toothache in his heel.

Papa loved mama---mama loved men,(three times)
Mama's in the graveyard and papa's in the pen.

I gee to the mule but the mule wouldn't gee, (3 times)
So I hit him side the head with the single tree.

Wake up and we would touch the sky

How could I ever forget to

It's like six in the morning
Me and Miller just finished our pack
Couple fiends on the avenue, they lookin' for crack
Grab the Nextel like yo L, police on the jack

Mean like, drive by pumpin' that lean back
Police hop out of the whip, (?) right in my six
Four fifth tucked right on his hip
Some dumb drunk, this nigga had stick
Was parked right on the block
Watchin' us but I ain't peep him and shit
Anyway, back to the story, you steamin' and shit
Pass the piff, we got fiends waitin', fiendin' and shit
Connect got me waitin', fuck, so I'm heated and shit
On the phone cursin' at shorty, ""I'm leavin' you, bitch""
Too much goin' on at one time, I'm dumb high
Seen in the peripheral, he jump tryna run by
His man in a whip, threw the clip and my gun back
Piece cocked back, but he spit about one time
Slumped out, sun down, and his man coming by
With like two more trucks and they creep from behind
Threw it in drive, now Hue ride sick when he high
Pull up Novotel, run ride they want us to die
Loose cannons do damage, well I'm dumpin' this 9
Whole clique in the back and we ready to ride

They said they got the squares
And they all for a good price and they solid
Reply 10-4, hung up the horn, got dressed
Waves pressed to best, yes, threw the Franck Muller on
Sophisticated, nothin' flashy, solid king, move like a boss
But the calm flowin' into somethin' nasty
Puffin' on the finest cheeba, green as a rainforest
Doin' a buck on I-95, screamin', ""I live for this,""
Niggas seen us comin', blew a flat
Pulled over to the shoulder
Popped the trunk to see if it's a spare in the back
A van pulled up, with Florida tags
Three men jumped out with guns drawn and they all wore masks
Snatched me up and handcuffed me
Hit me with the butt of the gun
I'm thinkin' to myself, ""The war just begun""
Thirty minutes in the ride, the mask came off
A chick was driving, two in the back had Russian accents
Askin' who my connect is, where he rest shit
You better off squeezin' that tool bitch
He said, ""Nah, you're worth more to us alive than dead""
He's flashed his badge and started laughin'
""Cocksucker, we the Feds""

Y la pipa de la paz yo me fumo
Pa' calmarme si no estás

Apache, un pelo negro de azabache
La luna, busca un hueco entre la espuma
De las nubes pa' alumbrarte

Y caminas entre las colinas, y me miras, me miras
Con tus ojos de cristal y como brillan, que brilla
La vela de tu sonrisa pues esconde tu sombra en la oscuridad
Y no te veo, pero te vuelvo a llamar

Señales de humo te hago
Y la pipa de la paz yo me fumo
Pa' calmarme si no estas

Me late, retumbo, me explota el corazón
Y Arde al segundo si esos ojos me vuelven a rozar
Los besos de la paz no se compran matando y matando

Apache, con tus pieles de mapache
Tus plumas, van devorando herraduras
De ese caballo salvaje

Te giras desde la colina y me miras, me miras
Con tus ojos de cristal y como brillan, que brilla
La vela de tu sonrisa pues esconde tu sombra en la oscuridad
Y no te veo, pero te vuelvo a llamar

Señales de humo te hago
Y la pipa de la paz yo me fumo
Pa' calmarme si no estas

Me late, retumbo, me explota el corazón
Y arde al segundo si esos ojos me vuelven a rozar
Los besos de la paz no se compran matando y matando

Y aunque el serif siga hablando a balazos
Zancadillas y tortazos yo te agarro del brazo
Y te saco a bailar en un planeta de borrachos

Vaqueros bien armados que nos cazan
Al lazo condenados a mirar
Y no te veo, pero te vuelvo a llamar

Señales de humo te hago
Y la pipa de la paz yo me fumo
Pa' calmarme si no estas

Me late, retumbo, me explota el corazón
Y arde al segundo si esos ojos me vuelven a rozar

Y saco el hacha de guerra por un beso de esos labios
Le declaro la guerra a un chulo cowboy tejano
Y pa' chula mi lengua que te escupe por bastardo

Los besos de la paz no se compran

Huecco,"Es inútil, no vale la pena
En invierno el sol no calienta
Sino que se congela
Y cae a trozos sobre mí
Y me raja el alma

Que a grito mudo se queja
Toneladas de tristeza
Mi mochila de cemento
Y mi cabeza que no para de pensarte
Y, ¡cómo pesas!

Si no quieres escuchar, camínate
Si no me quieres mirar, písame
Aun puedo ser la acera donde tu perro juega
O aprovéchate

Cómo una limosna me entregas
Instantes de tu presencia
Que me arranca mil sonrisas ciegas
Un topo sé en tu indiferencia
Que me mata dentro

Y esos ojos ya no se tropiezan
Ni tiemblan cuando estoy cerca, no
Ahora bostezan y se van
No importa donde

Si no quieres escuchar, camínate
Si no me quieres mirar, písame
Aun puedo ser la perra que en tu olvido cojea
O aprovéchate

Aquí me ves quemando margaritas a tus pies
Con la lengua ardiendo
Y mi alma a la sombra de un ciprés

Y tú con tu boca en cualquier bar de copas
Regalando besos, bebiendo la copa
No ves mi derrota, mira, no ves mi derrota

Tu cariño sale ya sin fuerza
Como el cava en la botella
Que lleva una vida abierta
Y patético lo intenta
No juegue, no mienta

Nunca vi una mirada tan hueca
Tan vacía de ganas
Tan lejos cuando te acercas
Y aun te ríes cuando te sale mi tristeza

Y la vida te dará lo que me das
Desde el barro quizás me recordarás
Y te verás buceando, en tus podridos charcos
Y allí te ahogarás

Aquí me ves quemando margaritas a tus pies
Con la lengua ardiendo
Y mi alma a la sombra de un ciprés

Y tú con tu boca en cualquier bar de copas
Regalando besos, perdiendo la ropa
No ves mi derrota

Duele la pena, duele la pena
Me mata el veneno de esa viuda negra
Duele la pena, duele la pena
Y me está matando esa mujer

Aquí me ves quemando margaritas a tus pies
Con la lengua ardiendo
Y mi alma a la sombra de un ciprés

Y tú con tu boca en un bar de copas
Regalando besos, perdiendo la ropa
No ves mi derrota, idiota, no ves mi derrota

Tus cuchillos me rozan al oído
Tus susurros me abrasan las entrañas

Que las balas justifiquen
Y que las palmas repiquen
Resuene otro aplauso

Que tú eres la reina de los angelotes
Baila que te baila, toda la noche
Si alguien te hace daño le daré garrote
Ven y acércame esos labios gordos

Alguien te vio por los Nuevayores
Y en Miami tomando los soles
Te bajaste hasta los Aragonés
Quizá en busca de algún amore

Si algún día la vida nos vuelve a cruzar
Si el destino quiere volver a jugar
Si intentamos darle tequila el azar
Quizás lo podamos emborrachar

Toma que toma que toma, toma

Mami, que tu eres la reina de los angelotes
Baila que te baila, toda la noche
Cuando tengas frio y no haya quien te arrope
Ven y acércame esos labios gordotes

Que tú eres la reina de los angelotes
Baila que te baila, toda la noche
Si alguien te hace daño le daré garrote
Ven y acércame esos labios gordotes

Gordotes, gordotes
Gordotes, gordotes, gordotes
Gordotes

Desde el parlamento de la rumba prima

Echas los perros tus miedos pasados
Los fantasmas que te han destrozado
Dame niña tu mano y enséñame tus encantos
Que cuando doble la esquina puede salir corriendo tu vida
Que la llames a voces y no vuelvas a escuchar su risa

Qué guapa, que linda que cosa más bonita
Que mira que tomate algo que esta noche se te invita
Qué guapa que linda
Tomate algo y a vivir

Si me ayudas a volar, si me vuelves besar
Sabes que todas las penas lejos se irán
La tristeza ya no está me la tuve que cargar
Por las balas de tus besos en la oscuridad
Que el ataque junto a mí

Desde la ventana de torelabios

Pa los leones los tiempos malos
La llel de los ratos que te han amargado
Sóplame otro beso desde la ventana de tus labios

Y no te me canses la lengua
O en discusiones que te están mareando
U apaga tu fuego despacito y entre mis brazos

Qué guapa, que linda que cosa más bonita
Que mira que tomate algo que esta noche se te invita
Qué guapa, que linda
Tomate algo y a vivir

Si me ayudas a volar, si me vuelves a besar
Sabes que todas las penas lejos se irán
La tristeza ya no está me la tuve que cargar
Por las balas de tus besos en la oscuridad

Que el ataque junto a mí, juguemos a calmar
Los ratos de ansiedad volvamos a empezar
Que el tiempo se nos va, que la felicidad
Está echando, a llorar hoy quiero escuchar

Que te vas a quedar, que te vas a quedar
Que te vas a quedar, que te vas a quedar

Si me ayudas a volar si me vuelves a besar
Sabes que todas las penas lejos se irán
La tristeza ya no está me la tuve que cargar
Por las balas de tus besos en la oscuridad

Y tú que siempre presumiste de vivir la carne

Los tesoros imposibles que ha escondido tu sonrisa
Si lo nuestro fue mentira, tus cuartadas no respiran
Olvidaste pintalabios imprudente en bocas que no eran la mía
En bocas que no eran la mía

Duele, son cosas normales
Esto es lo que tiene ser princesa de los arrabales
Tu ya una clásica en los coches de la noches de Madrid con tus rituales
La soledad se está encargando en silencio
De curar despacio todos tus males, todos tus males
Todos tus males, todos tus males

Lower ya finger, don't be comin' at me
With condescending demeanor
We both know that ya dead wrong

And what makes it worse
You don't even have the nerve
To ever say that you're sorry

You're never wrong and I'm never right
And you win all the rounds in every fight
That's why

Can't stay another day when you're always getting your way
You just keep getting your way
You just keep getting your way, ya selfish

So I decided not to get in your way
It's time to do it my way
And that means getting away from you, ya selfish

How is it that you can look at us and only see you?
You can look at one but never would you ever see two
You can live a lie and never be true
It's so funny now, how completely I can see you

You're never wrong and I'm never right
And you win all the rounds in every fight
That's why

Can't stay another day when you're always getting your way
You just keep getting your way

So I decided not to get in your way
It's time to do it my way
And that means getting away from you, ya selfish

No, we don't need to talk
Ain't nothin' left to say
You got everything ya want
Go ahead and have ya cake

I know what's best for me
We go our separate ways
Leaving you with everything
Even all the pain

Can't stay another day when you're always getting your way
You just keep getting your way
You just keep getting your way, ya selfish

Wanna get with a real balla that's makin' that real paper
If she want a good life, shop, hop out fancy cars
Award shows, party, mingle with the stars

Now if she understand that I am her burning man
And when it comes to sellin' out she's my sold out crowd
And if she's not the type that got a lot girlfriends

Huey,"This goes out to all my kids out there in the hood, ya know
Going through the struggle and what not
There's always something bad that could happen in the hood
Ya know, yeah

Momma where you at, daddy where you at?
The hood's out of control, time to fight back
Kids just doing time, ain't nothing but crime
Because they don't believe the sun can still shine

Waited too long, now it's a problem
You see what it is, how it go wrong
Ooh, that's understood
'Cause nobody loves the hood

Man, this hook is too true to believe in
Where da hell is ya momma and daddy when you need 'em?
Born in the hood, so the hood's in ya heart
Though nothing's been good in the hood from the start

Either you was with ya momma or never had a daddy?
Or never had neitha and was raised wit' ya granny
It's a cold ass world fa the younga generation
In err hood somebody would, time to be facing

For a fucked up reason, a bad ass time
Then gave up, they don't think the sun still shine
Brush it against the wall, forced to do crime
Some say they'll die before they do time

'Cause jail ain't the place to be
Might be the place for you but ain't for me, yeah
You enjoying yo life, why? 'Cause your fists grip wood
But the kids doing bad 'cause nobody loves da hood

Momma where you at, daddy where you at?
The hood's out of control, time to fight back
Kids just doing time, ain't nothing but crime
Because they don't believe the sun can still shine

Waited too long, now it's a problem
You see what it is, how it go wrong
Ooh, that's understood
'Cause nobody loves the hood

Man, the kids always getting lectured
But what do you expect when they have no direction
Father in jail, mother strung out
No curfew, late nights, hung out

Getting money on the zone, now it is a problem
'Cause they selling white rocks, carrying a revolver
Everybody gotta eat somehow, someway
Wishing they'll make it out somehow, someday

They can put the drugs down and pick up the books
There's only a few good cops 'cause most of them crooks
Supposed to protect and serve but now they got the nerve
To say they want criminals up off of the curb

It's a cold ass world, especially for male
They filling up more than half of all jails
The government got the world misunderstood
I dedicate this to the ones who love the hood

Momma where you at, daddy where you at?
The hood's out of control, time to fight back
Kids just doing time, ain't nothing but crime
Because they don't believe the sun can still shine

Waited too long, now it's a problem
You see what it is, how it go wrong
Ooh, that's understood
'Cause nobody loves the hood

Stand strong all my lil' soldiers
Reject all negative words people done told ya
Grind how you gotta and make 'em out of believers
Give the middle fingers and tell 'em I don't need ya

Over come the bad and pray to the Lord
Soon to turn good 'cause the grace of the Lord
Now you could smile and say it's all good
I'm never gonna leave 'cause somebody love the hood

Momma where you at, daddy where you at?
The hood's out of control, time to fight back
Kids just doing time, ain't nothing but crime

I'm hoping she a freak cause I ain't tryna chill
I'm tryna get it poppin, with a shortie like mine
That's willing to drop it low enough to blow my mind

Pop, lock, and drop it

I'll tell you mommy don't worry I'm safe with the heat
Now come a little closer move your waist to the beat

Fire, you ain't neva lied a'ight! (Oh)",Pop Lock & Drop It,2012
"Huey ""Piano"" Smith","Let's start by correcting ya tone
Lower ya finger, don't be comin' at me
With condescending demeanor
We both know that ya dead wrong

And what makes it worse
You don't even have the nerve
To ever say that you're sorry

You're never wrong and I'm never right
And you win all the rounds in every fight
That's why

Can't stay another day when you're always getting your way
You just keep getting your way
You just keep getting your way, ya selfish

So I decided not to get in your way
It's time to do it my way
And that means getting away from you, ya selfish

How is it that you can look at us and only see you?
You can look at one but never would you ever see two
You can live a lie and never be true
It's so funny now, how completely I can see you

You're never wrong and I'm never right
And you win all the rounds in every fight
That's why

Can't stay another day when you're always getting your way
You just keep getting your way
You just keep getting your way, ya selfish

So I decided not to get in your way
It's time to do it my way
And that means getting away from you, ya selfish

No, we don't need to talk
Ain't nothin' left to say
You got everything ya want
Go ahead and have ya cake

I know what's best for me
We go our separate ways
Leaving you with everything
Even all the pain

Can't stay another day when you're always getting your way
You just keep getting your way
You just keep getting your way, ya selfish

So I decided not to get in your way
It's time to do it my way
And that means getting away from you, ya selfish

Can't stay another day when you're always getting your way
You just keep getting your way
You just keep getting your way, ya selfish

So I decided not to get in your way
It's time to do it my way

Nigga, now I know why you ain't been hangin' around me
The way she look I'd do the same, spend that time, play that game
Like to say if I lock that up, if I was you I'd knock that up

Open the door for her man, pulled out her chair
She may not know it but that's wifee right there
Worth spending that money, lookin' fresh as a breeze
Sexy, good girl, pretty and as sweet as can be

You could take her straight home to mama
Even to meet your pops
She don't come with no drama

Huey be the man to give some real love, you know that playa be I

The type that'd take her out the hood
Make sure her hair and her nails look good
500 Benz, you can break a lil' wood
If she was my girl, I'ma do what I could

As long as you understand it's 50-50
You do for me, I do for you
You shoot for me and I'd shoot for you
You be sweet to me and I'm sweet to you

You may think I'm lyin' but it's the truth
'Cause I ain't gotta lie to kick it
It's easy for me to be pimpin'
But I'm gonna make you my mistress

To avoid the life lookin' ruff
Head and attitude all messed up
All ya gotta do is holler at Kells
And tell him done, hook it up

If she got a friend, homie, tell your girl to hook it up
If she got a cousin, homie, tell your girl to hook it up

If she's lookin' for that real love, tell your girl to hook it up
If she look like her, act like her, partner, let me

If she like real playas and don't fuck with no haters
Wanna get with a real balla that's makin' that real paper
If she want a good life, shop, hop out fancy cars
Award shows, party, mingle with the stars

Now if she understand that I am her burning man
And when it comes to sellin' out she's my sold out crowd
And if she's not the type that got a lot girlfriends
Then tell your girl to holler at her future boyfriend, hook it up

Going through the struggle and what not
There's always something bad that could happen in the hood
Ya know, yeah

Momma where you at, daddy where you at?
The hood's out of control, time to fight back
Kids just doing time, ain't nothing but crime
Because they don't believe the sun can still shine

Waited too long, now it's a problem
You see what it is, how it go wrong
Ooh, that's understood
'Cause nobody loves the hood

Man, this hook is too true to believe in
Where da hell is ya momma and daddy when you need 'em?
Born in the hood, so the hood's in ya heart
Though nothing's been good in the hood from the start

Either you was with ya momma or never had a daddy?
Or never had neitha and was raised wit' ya granny
It's a cold ass world fa the younga generation
In err hood somebody would, time to be facing

For a fucked up reason, a bad ass time
Then gave up, they don't think the sun still shine
Brush it against the wall, forced to do crime
Some say they'll die before they do time

'Cause jail ain't the place to be
Might be the place for you but ain't for me, yeah
You enjoying yo life, why? 'Cause your fists grip wood
But the kids doing bad 'cause nobody loves da hood

Ooh, that's understood
'Cause nobody loves the hood

Man, the kids always getting lectured
But what do you expect when they have no direction
Father in jail, mother strung out
No curfew, late nights, hung out

Getting money on the zone, now it is a problem
'Cause they selling white rocks, carrying a revolver
Everybody gotta eat somehow, someway
Wishing they'll make it out somehow, someday

They can put the drugs down and pick up the books
There's only a few good cops 'cause most of them crooks
Supposed to protect and serve but now they got the nerve
To say they want criminals up off of the curb

It's a cold ass world, especially for male
They filling up more than half of all jails
The government got the world misunderstood
I dedicate this to the ones who love the hood

Momma where you at, daddy where you at?
The hood's out of control, time to fight back
Kids just doing time, ain't nothing but crime
Because they don't believe the sun can still shine

Waited too long, now it's a problem
You see what it is, how it go wrong
Ooh, that's understood
'Cause nobody loves the hood

Stand strong all my lil' soldiers
Reject all negative words people done told ya
Grind how you gotta and make 'em out of believers
Give the middle fingers and tell 'em I don't need ya

Over come the bad and pray to the Lord
Soon to turn good 'cause the grace of the Lord
Now you could smile and say it's all good
I'm never gonna leave 'cause somebody love the hood

Mami gon take it low if you can then touch your toes
You and your partna them, you can get dollas then
Trickin' ain't in my blood, but I'ma make it rain

Twenty five's on my range, I know that that's a odd number
The way you tootin' that thang can make the guys wonder
What's underneath or even if it's real
I'm hoping she a freak cause I ain't tryna chill
I'm tryna get it poppin, with a shortie like mine
That's willing to drop it low enough to blow my mind
It's H.U.E.Z. and Bow Weezy

If you wanna please me baby all you gotta do is
Pop, lock, and drop it

But baby don't stop it, we can do it like Chris Brown girl and get it poppin'

See I told you everything was going to be aight in here

So stop acting and get it clappin'
'Cause I'm knowing you feeling me
Yeah, you cute
But don't let that shit go to yo' head
'Cause what this cutie won't do
Pimpin' another one will
You prepared, rockin' a skirt
And ya heels so tall
And we ain't wit' none of that tricking, but our bills so tall
I been peepin' you fo' a while, and you throwin' it back
If you lookin' fo' you a balla, we got dough in da back
Look, yo' color caramel brown
And yo' skin so smooth
I'm havin' fantasies about what you and me can do
And you an undercover freak
You probably thinking da same
I'm seein' light up on yo' face because you peepin' my chain
And I ain't tryin' a put you out there as if you a freak
So don't even take it that way; jus' say you did it fo' me
And, yeah, you probably roll wit' me 'cause it's money in my pockets
So before then I gotta see you pop, lock and drop it

We ain't got to talk again
I'm jus' tryin' a have a time
If you a balla, pull a stack out, and smack her on da ay
Pop, lockin', cock blockas, get up out da way
Let lil' mommy get low
Give her space, let her sweat
The club turnin' to hoolas 'cause they shirts is so wet
From da window to da wall
Lil' mama showin' her thong
The broad freakin' herself; it's tellin' me that it's on
You ready, then we can roll; I'm tellin' you we can go
I'm thinkin' if I can handle it, the way you make it roll
You groovin' and speedin' up
You right in between us
If you a strip teasa, then baby, don't tease us
At first I thought I was trippin'
But my vision gettin' clearer
You moving that thang around as if you practice in da mirror
She doin' a new dance
What the next man said
I'm like, naw; she just pop locking on a headstand

Toot that thang up, mommy, make it roll
Once you pop, pop, lock it for me, girl, get low

It ain't tricking if you got it
We got it, but I ain't givin'
Just bounce it and roll wit' it, and maybe you roll wit' us
It ain't tricking if you got it
We got it, and I ain't givin'
Just bounce it and roll wit' it, and maybe you roll wit' us

You're never wrong and I'm never right

How is it that you can look at us and only see you?
You can look at one but never would you ever see two
You can live a lie and never be true

Tell your girl if she got one of them bad motherfuckers
That look like her and you know, act like her

If she got a friend, homie, tell your girl to hook it up
If she got a cousin, homie, tell your girl to hook it up

Nigga, now I know why you ain't been hangin' around me
The way she look I'd do the same, spend that time, play that game
Like to say if I lock that up, if I was you I'd knock that up

Open the door for her man, pulled out her chair
She may not know it but that's wifee right there
Worth spending that money, lookin' fresh as a breeze
Sexy, good girl, pretty and as sweet as can be

You could take her straight home to mama
Even to meet your pops
She don't come with no drama

The type that'd take her out the hood
Make sure her hair and her nails look good
500 Benz, you can break a lil' wood
If she was my girl, I'ma do what I could

As long as you understand it's 50-50
You do for me, I do for you
You shoot for me and I'd shoot for you
You be sweet to me and I'm sweet to you

You may think I'm lyin' but it's the truth
'Cause I ain't gotta lie to kick it
It's easy for me to be pimpin'
But I'm gonna make you my mistress

To avoid the life lookin' ruff
Head and attitude all messed up
All ya gotta do is holler at Kells
And tell him done, hook it up

If she like real playas and don't fuck with no haters
Wanna get with a real balla that's makin' that real paper
If she want a good life, shop, hop out fancy cars
Award shows, party, mingle with the stars

Now if she understand that I am her burning man
And when it comes to sellin' out she's my sold out crowd
And if she's not the type that got a lot girlfriends
Then tell your girl to holler at her future boyfriend, hook it up

Going through the struggle and what not
There's always something bad that could happen in the hood
Ya know, yeah

Momma where you at, daddy where you at?
The hood's out of control, time to fight back
Kids just doing time, ain't nothing but crime
Because they don't believe the sun can still shine

Waited too long, now it's a problem
You see what it is, how it go wrong
Ooh, that's understood
'Cause nobody loves the hood

Man, this hook is too true to believe in
Where da hell is ya momma and daddy when you need 'em?
Born in the hood, so the hood's in ya heart
Though nothing's been good in the hood from the start

Either you was with ya momma or never had a daddy?
Or never had neitha and was raised wit' ya granny
It's a cold ass world fa the younga generation
In err hood somebody would, time to be facing

For a fucked up reason, a bad ass time
Then gave up, they don't think the sun still shine
Brush it against the wall, forced to do crime
Some say they'll die before they do time

'Cause jail ain't the place to be
Might be the place for you but ain't for me, yeah
You enjoying yo life, why? 'Cause your fists grip wood
But the kids doing bad 'cause nobody loves da hood

Ooh, that's understood
'Cause nobody loves the hood

Man, the kids always getting lectured
But what do you expect when they have no direction
Father in jail, mother strung out
No curfew, late nights, hung out

Getting money on the zone, now it is a problem
'Cause they selling white rocks, carrying a revolver
Everybody gotta eat somehow, someway
Wishing they'll make it out somehow, someday

They can put the drugs down and pick up the books
There's only a few good cops 'cause most of them crooks
Supposed to protect and serve but now they got the nerve
To say they want criminals up off of the curb

It's a cold ass world, especially for male
They filling up more than half of all jails
The government got the world misunderstood
I dedicate this to the ones who love the hood

Momma where you at, daddy where you at?

The hood's out of control, time to fight back

Bow Weezy
T-Pain
Hitz Committee

It's H-U-E-Y, home fly G five
And by the look in my eyes she have nice thighs
But her mama done gave her then grew from local to major
My pockets full of paper, born as a Missouri stater
Mami gon take it low if you can then touch your toes
You and your partna them, you can get dollas then
Trickin' ain't in my blood, but I'ma make it rain
I'm too rich for dolla bills, I consider that as change
Twenty five's on my range, I know that that's a odd number
The way you tootin' that thang can make the guys wonder
What's underneath or even if it's real
I'm hoping she a freak cause I ain't tryna chill
I'm tryna get it poppin, with a shortie like mine
That's willing to drop it low enough to blow my mind
It's H.U.E.Z. and Bow Weezy
Let's see if she can get lower than before on the remix

Toot that thang up mami make it roll
Once you pop, pop lock it for me girl get low
If yo mama gave it to you, baby girl let it show
Once you pop lock drop it for me maybe we can roll (oh)

Pop lock and drop it (8x)

Aye, aye, let me holla at you for a minute

Hey what it is they call me Bow Wizzle

From Ohio all the way to St. Louis, hey all the girls do it just put your back into it
Now shake what she gave you, I'm talking bout ya mama
If you wont do it for me then do it for these dollas
Cause I'ma make it rain, these other dudes is lame
They talk a good game, but they can't do the same
Now drop it up and down, now take it to the ground
If you wanna please me baby all you gotta do is
Pop, lock, and drop it

But baby don't stop it, we can do it like Chris Brown girl and get it poppin'
Man I'm a pro, look I'm far from a rookie
Girl get your pretty self over here gimme them cookies

Toot that thang up mami make it roll

If yo mama gave it to you, baby girl let it show
Once you pop lock drop it for me maybe we can roll (oh)

Pop lock and drop it (8x)

Shorty snap (yeah!)
Damn, shorty snap (shaw-d-et)
Yea

Let me introduce my friend, that's Huey and Bow Wow
And I'm the pain better known as Teddy Bend her ass down
I'ma G (yea)
But, you probably already knew that
But you didn't know that I can make you pop, lock, Drop and do that

I'll tell you mommy don't worry I'm safe with the heat
Now come a little closer move your waist to the beat

The more I'm around gratify me to love you
There's one thing to know your next

And when it comes to sellin' out she's my sold out crowd
And if she's not the type that got a lot girlfriends
Then tell your girl to holler at her future boyfriend, hook it up

If she got a friend, homie, tell your girl to hook it up
If she got a cousin, homie, tell your girl to hook it up
If she got a sister, homie, tell your girl to hook it up
If she look like her, act like her, partner, let me hook it up

If she sexy like that, tell your girl to hook it up
Sweet and she don't talk back, tell your girl to hook it up
If she's lookin' for that real love, tell your girl to hook it up

Going through the struggle and what not
There's always something bad that could happen in the hood
Ya know, yeah

Momma where you at, daddy where you at?
The hood's out of control, time to fight back
Kids just doing time, ain't nothing but crime
Because they don't believe the sun can still shine

Waited too long, now it's a problem
You see what it is, how it go wrong

Where da hell is ya momma and daddy when you need 'em?
Born in the hood, so the hood's in ya heart
Though nothing's been good in the hood from the start

Either you was with ya momma or never had a daddy?
Or never had neitha and was raised wit' ya granny
It's a cold ass world fa the younga generation
In err hood somebody would, time to be facing

For a fucked up reason, a bad ass time
Then gave up, they don't think the sun still shine
Brush it against the wall, forced to do crime
Some say they'll die before they do time

'Cause jail ain't the place to be
Might be the place for you but ain't for me, yeah
You enjoying yo life, why? 'Cause your fists grip wood

Man, the kids always getting lectured
But what do you expect when they have no direction
Father in jail, mother strung out
No curfew, late nights, hung out

Getting money on the zone, now it is a problem
'Cause they selling white rocks, carrying a revolver
Everybody gotta eat somehow, someway
Wishing they'll make it out somehow, someday

They can put the drugs down and pick up the books
There's only a few good cops 'cause most of them crooks
Supposed to protect and serve but now they got the nerve
To say they want criminals up off of the curb

It's a cold ass world, especially for male
They filling up more than half of all jails
The government got the world misunderstood
I dedicate this to the ones who love the hood

Momma where you at, daddy where you at?
The hood's out of control, time to fight back

Ooh, that's understood
'Cause nobody loves the hood

Stand strong all my lil' soldiers
Reject all negative words people done told ya
Grind how you gotta and make 'em out of believers
Give the middle fingers and tell 'em I don't need ya

Over come the bad and pray to the Lord
Soon to turn good 'cause the grace of the Lord
Now you could smile and say it's all good
I'm never gonna leave 'cause somebody love the hood

The way you tootin' that thang can make the guys wonder
What's underneath or even if it's real
I'm hoping she a freak cause I ain't tryna chill
I'm tryna get it poppin, with a shortie like mine
That's willing to drop it low enough to blow my mind
It's H.U.E.Z. and Bow Weezy

If you wanna please me baby all you gotta do is
Pop, lock, and drop it

You just keep getting your way
You just keep getting your way, ya selfish

So I decided not to get in your way
It's time to do it my way
And that means getting away from you, ya selfish

How is it that you can look at us and only see you?
You can look at one but never would you ever see two
You can live a lie and never be true
It's so funny now, how completely I can see you

You're never wrong and I'm never right
And you win all the rounds in every fight
That's why

Can't stay another day when you're always getting your way
You just keep getting your way
You just keep getting your way, ya selfish

So I decided not to get in your way
It's time to do it my way
And that means getting away from you, ya selfish

No, we don't need to talk
Ain't nothin' left to say
You got everything ya want
Go ahead and have ya cake

I know what's best for me
We go our separate ways
Leaving you with everything
Even all the pain

Can't stay another day when you're always getting your way
You just keep getting your way
You just keep getting your way, ya selfish

So I decided not to get in your way
It's time to do it my way
And that means getting away from you, ya selfish

Can't stay another day when you're always getting your way
You just keep getting your way
You just keep getting your way, ya selfish

So I decided not to get in your way
It's time to do it my way
And that means getting away from you, ya selfish",Selfish [Remix],2008
"Huey ""Piano"" Smith & the Clowns","Toot that thang up, mommy, make it roll
Once you pop, pop, lock it for me, girl, get low
If yo' mama gave it to you, baby girl, let it show
Once you pop, lock, drop it for me, maybe we can roll (Oh)
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it

Tonight, it's gon' be some changes
No acting sadity
So stop acting and get it clappin'
'Cause I'm knowing you feeling me
Yeah, you cute
But don't let that shit go to yo' head
'Cause what this cutie won't do
Pimpin' another one will
You prepared, rockin' a skirt
And ya heels so tall
And we ain't wit' none of that tricking, but our bills so tall
I been peepin' you fo' a while, and you throwin' it back
If you lookin' fo' you a balla, we got dough in da back
Look, yo' color caramel brown
And yo' skin so smooth
I'm havin' fantasies about what you and me can do
And you an undercover freak
You probably thinking da same
I'm seein' light up on yo' face because you peepin' my chain
And I ain't tryin' a put you out there as if you a freak
So don't even take it that way; jus' say you did it fo' me
And, yeah, you probably roll wit' me 'cause it's money in my pockets
So before then I gotta see you pop, lock and drop it

Toot that thang up, mommy, make it roll
Once you pop, pop, lock it for me, girl, get low
If yo' mama gave it to you, baby girl, let it show
Once you pop, lock, drop it for me, maybe we can roll (Oh)

I ain't gotta be yo' man
But I really wouldn't mind
We ain't got to talk again
I'm jus' tryin' a have a time
If you a balla, pull a stack out, and smack her on da ay
Pop, lockin', cock blockas, get up out da way
Let lil' mommy get low
Give her space, let her sweat
The club turnin' to hoolas 'cause they shirts is so wet
From da window to da wall
Lil' mama showin' her thong
The broad freakin' herself; it's tellin' me that it's on
You ready, then we can roll; I'm tellin' you we can go
I'm thinkin' if I can handle it, the way you make it roll
You groovin' and speedin' up
You right in between us
If you a strip teasa, then baby, don't tease us
At first I thought I was trippin'
But my vision gettin' clearer
You moving that thang around as if you practice in da mirror
She doin' a new dance
What the next man said
I'm like, naw; she just pop locking on a headstand

Toot that thang up, mommy, make it roll
Once you pop, pop, lock it for me, girl, get low
If yo' mama gave it to you, baby girl, let it show
Once you pop, lock, drop it for me, maybe we can roll (Oh)

Pop, lock and drop it

Roll to da right (Right)
Pop, lock and drop it; get low, a'ight
Make it roll to da left (Left)
Roll to da right (Right)
Pop, lock and drop it; get low, a'ight
It ain't tricking if you got it
We got it, but I ain't givin'
Just bounce it and roll wit' it, and maybe you roll wit' us
It ain't tricking if you got it
We got it, and I ain't givin'
Just bounce it and roll wit' it, and maybe you roll wit' us

Pop, lock and drop it
Now pop, lock and drop it fo' me
Pop, lock and drop it
Say pop, lock and drop it

Y ahora me miras como si fuera un extraño

Parece ser que todo ya se te olvido
Que las promesas que salieron de tus labios
Se derritieron como el hielo bajo el sol
Y se apago ese desplandor de aquella noche de verano

Mas yo si me enamore, por eso no te olvide

Huey Dumbar,"No es ninguna aberración sexual
Pero me gusta verte andar en cueros
El compás de tus pechos aventureros
Victimas de la gravedad
Será por que no me gusta la tapicería
Que creo que tu desnudez
Es tu mejor lencería

Por eso me gustas tal y como eres
Incluso es par de libras de más
Si te viese tu jefe desnuda y detrás
No dudaría en promover tu cintura
Deja llenarme de tu desnudez

Para afrontar los disfraces de afuera
De una mejor manera
Desnuda
Que no habrá diseño que te quede mejor
Que el de tu pìel ajustada a tu figura
Desnuda
Que no hay un ingenuo que vista una flor
Sería como taparle la hermosura
Desnuda

Que la naturaleza no se equivoca
Y si te hubiese querido con ropa
Con ropa hubieses nacido
Deja llenarme de tu desnudez
Para vestirme por dentro,
Aunque sea un momento.

Y ahora que por fin te tengo así
Desnuda y precisamente enfrente
Desnuda también un poquito la mente
Pon tus complejos junto a tu ropa;
Y si te sientes un poquito loca
Ponte loca completa,

Que querte será solo el inicio
Antes de perder el juicio.

Huey Dunbar,"Lo mejor que me ha pasado desde el dia que fui
Es despertar a tu lado y verte
Yo vivia equivocado pero no me dabe cuenta
El amor es algo sabio, sabe esperar

Y ahora que te tengo entre mis brazos nuevamente
Me doy cuenta del error que he cometido
De lo mal que me he portado yo contigo, discúlpame
Ahora que no tengo a donde ir tu me recibes

Y me curas con tus labios las heridas
Que la vida me ha dejado en mi corazón, perdóname
Ahora que no tengo nada que ofrecerte
Tu me aceptas en tu vida nuevamente, amor de siempre

",Amor de Siempre,2001
Huey Dunbar,"If you saw my baby by the flow of candlelight
You would see why I need to he with her every night
Nothing is like the sweetness that I've tasted on her lips 

Nothing drives me crazy like the motion of her hips
The way she moves, like fire dancing
I feel her burn we toss and turn 
A 'chiki chiki cha' on and on 

""Ella es candela"", she's got me burnin 
'Chiki chiki cha chiki cha cha cha'
The rhythm of our bodies, oh we just can't stop.
""Ella es candela"", she gives me fever

And in the morning I don't want to leave her 
'chiki chiki cha chiki cha cha' 
The rhythm of our bodies oh we just can't stop
She gives all her passion every time we're alone

And until the light of dawn we make music of our own
All my secret fantasies she already knows
I don't have to say a world that's just how she flows.",Chikicha,2001

Se apagan los años
Y me olvido de lo bueno
Extrañándote, no dejo de llorar
Y aprendo a suplicar, por nuestro amor

Sé que sin tu cariño mis tristes ojitos
Yo me encontrare perdido
Asfixiándome, falta de tu piel
Y aroma de mujer
Lágrimas y el alma herida

A donde iré
Si en cada rostro de mujer te encontrare
En cada paso, en cada lluvia sentiré
Esa agonía por tu ausencia
Ese vació que no quiere verme vivo

A donde iré
Si en cada noche tu sabor lo probare
En cada risa y alimento te veré
En cada luna y sus estrellas

En cada espacio, en cada beso y pensamiento
Ven, cuando este dormido
Regálame un sueño, que me lleve al firmamento
Donde tú y yo volvamos a empezar
Sabiéndonos amar, sin lastimar y sin mentiras

A donde iré
Si en cada rostro de mujer te encontrare
En cada paso, en cada lluvia sentiré
Esa agonía por tu ausencia
Ese vació que no quiere verme vivo

Si en cada noche tu sabor lo probare
En cada risa y alimento te veré
En cada luna y sus estrellas
En cada espacio, en cada beso y pensamiento

De promesas que se hicieron
Hace tiempo

Plays guitar, sounds like a chainsaw buzzing
In the crowd, I see his mom and dad

Cool is a rule, but, sometimes, bad is bad.

Across the street, a neon sign
All you can eat for a dollar ninety nine
Aww, that old stew is the baddest in the land
But one dollar's worth was all that I could stand

But sometimes, sometimes bad is bad
Cool is a rule, but, sometimes, bad is bad.

Back uptown to see Marie

I've never known one, not for long

It's a big old, bad old, tough old town, it's true
But beginnings are contagious there
They're always setting stages there
They're always turning pages there for you

Ain't it great the way it all begins in New York City
Right away, you're making time, and making friends
No one cares where you were yesterday
If they pick you out, you're on your way
To a once upon a time that never ends

So Oliver, don't be shy
Get out there and go and try
Believin' that you're the guy
They're dying to see
'Cause a dream's no crime
Not once upon a time
Once upon a time in New York City

If it's always once upon a time in New York City
Why does nightfall leave you feeling so alone
How could any one stay starry-eyed
When it's raining cats and dogs outside
And the rain has said ""now you're on your own""

So Oliver don't be scared
Though yesterday no one cared
They're getting your place prepared
Where you want to be
Keep your dream alive
Dreaming is still how the strong survive
Once upon a time in New York City

Keep your dream alive
Dreaming is still how the strong survive
Once upon a time in New York City

But I couldn't take the punishment, and had to settle down
Now I'm playing it real straight, and yes I cut my hair
You might think I'm crazy, but I don't even care
Because I can tell what's going on
It's hip to be square

I like my bands in business suits, I watch them on TV
I'm working out most everyday and watching what I eat
They tell me that it's good for me, but I don't even car
I know that it's crazy
I know that it's nowhere
But there is no denying that
It's hip to be square

It's not too hard to figure out, you see it everyday
And those that were the farthest out have gone the other way
You see them on the freeway, It don't look like a lot of fun
But don't you try to fight it; ""An idea who's time has come.""

It's a big old, bad old, tough old town, it's true
But beginnings are contagious there
They're always setting stages there
They're always turning pages there for you

Ain't it great the way it all begins in New York City
Right away, you're making time, and making friends
No one cares where you were yesterday
If they pick you out, you're on your way
To a once upon a time that never ends

So Oliver, don't be shy
Get out there and go and try
Believin' that you're the guy
They're dying to see
'Cause a dream's no crime
Not once upon a time
Once upon a time in New York City

If it's always once upon a time in New York City
Why does nightfall leave you feeling so alone
How could any one stay starry-eyed
When it's raining cats and dogs outside
And the rain has said ""now you're on your own""

So Oliver don't be scared
Though yesterday no one cared
They're getting your place prepared
Where you want to be
Keep your dream alive
Dreaming is still how the strong survive
Once upon a time in New York City

Keep your dream alive
Dreaming is still how the strong survive

I knew I never meant it
I could feel cupids arrow from above

You left the water running, running from these eyes of mine

You turned out the light of love
You left with another guy
You turned off all your love for me
But you forgot to turn off the cry
You forgot to turn off the cry

You pulled the shades away down low
And disconnected the telephone
But these tears a running from my eyes
I can't turn them off and on
No, I can't turn them off and on

You left the water running when you left me here behind
You left the water running, running from these eyes of mine

Huey Lewis & the News,"Walking down the main drag one night
I met a fine chick that looked- just right
She stopped in and I flashed my roll
I told her she could have all of my dough
She turned around, and with a frown
She said this ain't no circus and I don't need a clown
Your cash ain't nothin' but trash
Your cash ain't nothin' but trash
Your cash ain't nothin' but trash
So there ain't no need in your hangin' around

Just to make the hit with that chick
I tried to get a Cadillac right quick
The man at the place looked so strange
I had nine hundred bucks and some change
We disagreed, I tried to plead
He said I ain't no chicken and I don't need your feed

Your cash ain't nothin' but trash
Your cash ain't nothin' but trash
Your cash ain't nothin' but trash
Then brother you're crawling we passed your speed

I'm walking and countin my bucks
The man with the gun said hands up
I tried to get away but I was too slow
He caught me and took all of my dough
I heard him shout, as he cut out
""you really lost nothing what you're crying about?""

Your cash ain't nothin' but trash
Your cash ain't nothin' but trash
Your cash ain't nothin' but trash
And he took my watch and I passed out

I woke in the arms of a big cop
Police station next stop
The judge swung his fist down plunk plunk
Twenty dollar fine 'cause you're drunk
Dig up the dough, and you can go
And all I had was a buffalo

It must be you

Huey Lewis & the News,"He was always the toughest kid
But he never meant no harm
But looking back I could see his fate
Was tattooed on his arm
Walking through the courtyard
Always there to be seen
He and little Janie
Together they were the king and queen

He was the only one, who ever really knew
He was the only one, what can we do
He was the only one, he always showed us how
He was the only one, where is he now

Three years later at the bus stop
I know I'll never forget
He looked smaller in real ways
As he bummed a cigarette
And I asked him what he'd been doing
And how's little Janie anyway
Seems he was drunk
They had a fight
Janie got hurt and they took him away

He was the only one, who ever really knew
He was the only one, what can we do
He was the only one, he always showed us how
He was the only one, where is he now

I can still see him standing there
Just like yesterday
Leaning on a '56
Giving his secrets away
Is it any wonder
I feel a little lonely
He's not just the only one
He's the one and only

I heard about the accident
There's not much left to say
He wandered out in the middle of the freeway
It must have happened right away

And I though about what a shame it was
Now that it's all said and done
And it may sound strange
But even now
He's still the only one

He was the only one, who ever really knew
He was the only one, what can we do
He was the only one, he always showed us how
He was the only one, where is he now",The Only One,2001

She's getting it all for free 
She's shadow boxing loosing the bout 
Its pretty easy to see 

I know you've, you've seen a better sight 
You say you really want to help 
You better open your eyes, hey 

We see the morning face in the bathroom mirror 
She's careful never to see

Take off your mask baby
I can see right through your soul
What I see is a doggone thing
Don't know why I didn't see it before
You misused me for so long
Threw me love
Like you throw an old dog a bone
That's why the name of this song is

Free
Glad I got over you
Say it again for the benefit of those who didn't hear
Said I'm free
Glad I got over you

When you do me like you do me
Tell me what can a poor boy do
I will fall in love
Let it flow wherever it please
If you're trying to be a sweet angel in my room
But loving you I just couldn't see
You assumed that for so long
Threw me love
Like you throw an old dog a bone
Can't wait to stake
And you know that's wrong
Even a dog that gets tired
Wants to bury that bone

Said I'm free
I'm over you
Said I'm free
I'm over you

While the rain is falling
Sitting by the telephone

falling through his time and his space and I'm lucky to be part of it all
He is bigger than life he sees things he knows things he is not like you and

We've been had again

we had a seed
A beautiful seed
It was planted by thieves
We never saw leaves
Dropped on a soil
A beautiful soil
But they weren't wearing boots
We never grew roots

oh no 
We've been had again
Oh no 
We've been had again

beauty was found
And vanity lost
But the beauty was dead
Before we saw frost
Well fools never learn
That innocent burn
But we didn't expect 
What we couldn't detect

oh no
We've been had again
Oh no
We've been had again

I'm on borders
The second thoughts are always wisest
And everybody's wiser than anyone
But then again we could have been 
Regretfully yours...

The coyotes are howlin'
Way out where the doggies roam.
Where spurs are a jinglin'
And the cowboy is singin'
His lonesome cattle call.

He rides in the sun,
'Til his days work is done.
And rounds up the cattle each fall.
Singin' his cattle call.

For hours he would ride.
On the range far and wide.
When the night wind blows up and slow.
His heart is a feather.
In all kinds of weather.
He sings his cattle call.",The Cattle Call,2014
Hug Winterhalter's Orchestra & Chorus,"I see my darling in each spray of summer sunlight
I see my darling in the leaves that fall
I see her walking in the rainy April sadness
And hear her name in every bluebird call

I told the possum in the guntree the rackoon on the ground
Told everyone bout my darling of the happiness I found
My heart would cry more than the weeping willow tree
If my darling and her heart were not for me

I told the possum in the guntree...

I'm the richest man in the world

Thank you thank you Lord above for smiling down on me
I'm richer now than any man has any right to be
Health and love and happiness have been my cup of tea
The richest man in all creation surely it is me

I got a humpack mule a plow and a tater patch...

I've got water in my well and heaven in my heart
I have a perfect woman I can trust when we're apart
Cash enough to see a show and eat out now and then
A roof a bed a fishing pole and folks who call me friend

I got a humpack mule a plow and a tater patch...

I don't have much bank account my cash on hand is small
But tell me what are riches but contentment after all
Other folks may think I'm poor but I know it's not so
Cause when I count my blessings I'm the richest man I know

I got a humpack mule a plow and a tater patch...

Now the rich folks talk about the grub they eat
Now I've got all those rich folks beat
Cause I've got a field of yellow yams
And a smokehouse filled with country hams
Talk to me about caviar
They ain't nothing but fish eggs packed in a jar
I got a whole pond of big round trout
Fish eggs what are they talking about
Hey I got no fancy swimming pool but the creek in the woods
Is deep and cool I'm a lucky man I'm a lucky fool
I'm wealthy I'm wealthy

Went back to his car with nothing he could do

And we were gettin ready to leave the park
We had a good time(ahh yeah)
Yeah we had a good day
Pack the stuff off and we was on our way

But the all actin soft as we pulled up
They was actin all shy to us
But essays yo want to know who's the flyest
We bowed out and Jimmy Hassler passed out
Una sta feo so hey yo pimps jacked out
Coming up short they gave us no run
So yo homies consider this a dry one
Time to cruise the boulevard
Time to have I'm guaranteed to find a brownie while the night is young
We were rolling yeah looking real smooth
Cause cruising Whittier is how we ended our afternoon

Hugh Cornwell,"The other night I chanced upon an irate caterpillar
He was irate he had a darting face
Crinkled with old forms
Appendage arms spread out fanlike glancing
His string noise boxes
The rest were a howling wolf
Afraid to be left upright against sleeping forte
Calling to the caterpillar
Throughout the time span
Wanting to be fed wanting attention
Wanting waiting full of tension
They don't crowd the spiderlike object
They didn't object at least not many
Just waiting for the next creak
From his aching limbs to reach their brains through
Cup-like objects stuck on the sides of their heads
No-one joked no-one spoke
They became embarrassed and planted contempt
Under their haunches
When the caterpillar rested
His appendages ummed
His appendages arred
But not connecting with
The string noise boxes
And...
They...all just gazed

The other night I chanced upon an irate caterpillar (repeat)

Watch the coin is tossed to the air

Declares and mocks the tail

They will not follow they will not
Time enough to grow into some

Finding creatures awesome yet

Turns a yeah into a nay
Acts like a horse treat her worse
Until your voice goes hoarse
She'll turn your friends into sheriff
And what's more she's built the wrong way round
You never know which way she'll go
You reach high when she's way down below
Her feet smell her nose runs
She can sniff an Indian at fifty guns
She's so soft she makes it hard
And what's more she's built the wrong way round

Never wears a hat outside her face
Shields the sun from her gaze
Starts at the end in a maze - amazing!
She's built the wrong way round
Wakes you up puts you to sleep
Closes her eyes just to take a peep
Little Bo peep follows her sheep
Wears a big woolen jersey
Makes her flesh get up and creep
She's built the wrong way round
But it's the right way for me!

Hugh Cornwell,"One step forwards two steps backwards
That's the dance I want to learn
If I could master it and put a little style in it
I'll have some fun when it's my turn

Gable and Monroe in the garden
In the desert getting well
Eli and Thelma in the DC
It wasn't easy you can tell

It's just a step away
Please will you show us how to live
It's just a step away
When you got nothing left to give

Seven horses not enough to
Even fill the tank with gas
Monty's outside he wasn't inside
But he knows all things must pass
Bucking broncos we're all cowboys
Hanging from another age
Getting sauced that's just how the film goes
It's gotta be better than a wage

It's just a step away
Please will you show us how to live
It's just a step away
When you got nothing left to give



",Torture Garden,1999
Hugh Cornwell,"Blue is the colour soon arriving
When all the darkness of the mood just drifts away
Red has a habit of surviving
Can justice breathe some life into her guilty day
When purple leaves begin their falling
They mirror all the confidence that's gone
With orange lights illuminating
Familiar patterns calm the fears that make you run

I see all the colours of the rainbow

Indigo calls and beckons slowly
The consolation of a void in which to fall
And yellow ochre humbles lowly
A constellation flickers bright along the hall
Can green remain as fresh as dawning?
The vivid space suggested never to return
As bronze arrives after the morning
He silent as a tree lives falls and has to burn

I see all the colours of the rainbow

Hugh Cornwell,"Point your suit at me and take my breath away
Better in black and white and chrome I have to say Now the big sleep
You play the hero and the villain every day
Equally charming in an unassuming way
See the girls weep
And now you've said goodbye a million hearts are sad
We were there with you Bob so were my mum and dad
Now the big sleep

Suits and swimming trunks and clergy you don't care
Every one of them is scary we beware
I like Cape Fear
You're out of place in some but you lift them from the mire
Better in the heat to watch your pecs perspire
Then there was Angel Face
And when you leave a scene a thousand footsteps fall
Can't wait to see you back and walking very tall
Before the big sleep

Now sleep ...

No-one around like you and Jimmy stuart anymore
I'd like to don my suit and even up the score
And try to take over
Painted ladies ain't so glamorous today
Please take me back to 1941 today
Before Pearl Harbour
You've had some trials and tribulations just the same
You have to laugh a lot to stay ahead of the game
Before the big sleep

Now sleep ...

Hugh Cornwell,"It's not a comfort zone
I feel so far from home
My blood is never warm
My skin can feel the storm
The lights they flicker bright
As we approach the night knowing

I watch the guitars play
I feel the drumbeat sway
I smell the singers sweat
The song ain't got there yet
The crowd is feeling good
I know from where I'm stood it's growing
You'll find me on the dark side of the room

The road it never ends
The heart that never mends
Will you be scared tonight
Will the birds all take flight
And you might see the moon
From this side of the room glowing

You'll find me on the dark side of the room
Just look and you might find me there

Hugh Cornwell,"I met a man without a face
With knowledge of the human race
He smelt and felt and dealt with grace
Stupid enough to think that he'd seen it all

I saw his eyes as he saw mine
An optimism quite sublime
He furnished words to touch your heart
At least it seemed at the very start

Lay back on me pal I'm here
You won't have nothing to fear

Thought I'd seen those locks before
Tap tapping on a creaking door
I'd let him in at times of war
To take my mind off senseless misery

And as the recognition hit
Mugshots I'd seen began to fit
I said to him you worthless shit
He laughed and cried in a soliloquy



",Lay Back on Me Pal,2001
Hugh Cornwell,"Leave me alone
Gimme some space

It always ends up the same
Got nothing to say
It's all got to do with fame
Give me a new road
Tell me it's paved with gold
Just take a flight
Up into foreign skies
Leave me alone
Don't care what you do
Seems like it's all the same

There won't be no god to hear you yell

But ask them the question
And no answer is there

The backs up and prickly
Roll in a ball and pretend
You got no purse
But if this continues where does it all end?

Four walls a bed and a wonderful view

What did he do to upset the neighbourhood?
Just being free as a bird
After all that's what they said they loved
When will it be explained to him when he gets above?

All of those times when you were whipping me
It took it's toll though it was hard to see
I had a feeling that I'd come out tops
There'd be a silver lining when I let you drop
Dropping you in the drink I think
Show me a farmer with a golden goose
He makes sure that he never lets it loose
'cause if he does then the eggs ain't laid
Then the crops don't grow
And the haystacks don't get made
Cutting you to the quick 'cause you're sick
Pointed your gun at me just once to much

As consumers we all have needs and desires.
Trouble is, we suppress them

Now there are winners and there are losers.

But does the predator pity the prey?
I don't think so.
It's not just unnatural, it's plain unhealthy.

Cultivate your desires.
Let them grow and flower into the blossom that is greed.
You see, you are needed.
Your greed provides this country

With the fertile financial soil in which the roots of exploitation
Can spread, live, grow and flourish.
This in turn furnishes you,
The consumer, the standard of living you've come to expect.

The products you buy, the programs you watch, the car you drive, your job.
These are the things that define you as an individual.
Without them you have no identity, no purpose, no reason to exist.

Hugh French,"Lord Elderley, Lrd Borrowmere,
Lord Sickert and Lord Camp,
With every virtue, every grace,
Ah what avails the sceptred race,
Here you see-the four of us,
And there are so many more of us
Eldest sons that must succeed.
We know how Caesar conquered Gaul
And how to whack a cricket ball;
Apart from this, our education lacks co-ordination.
Though we're young and tentative
And rather rip-representative,
Scions of a noble breed,
We are the products of those homes serene and stately
Which only lately
Seem to have run to seed!
 
The Stately Homes of England,
How beautiful they stand,
To prove the upper classes
Have still the upper hand;
Though the fact that they have to be rebuilt
And frequently mortgaged to the hilt
Is inclined to take the gilt
Off the gingerbread,
And certainly damps the fun
Of the eldest son-
But still we won't be beaten,
We'll scrimp and scrape and save,
The playing fields of Eton
Have made us frightfully brave-
And though if the Van Dycks have to go
And we pawn the Bechstein Grand,
We'll stand
By the Stately Homes of England.
 
Here you see
The pick of us,
You may be heartily sick of us,
Still with sense
We're all imbued.
Our homes command extensive views
And with assistance from the Jews
We have been able to dispose of
Rows and rows and rows of
Gainsboroughs and Lawrences,
Some sporting prints of Aunt Florence's,
Some of which were rather rude.
Although we sometimes flaunt our family conventions,
Our good intentions
Mustn't be misconstrued.
 
The Stately Homes of England
We proudly represent,
We only keep them up for
Americans to rent,
Though the pipes that supply the bathroom burst
And the lavatory makes you fear the worst,
It was used by Charles the First
Quite informally,
And later by George the Fourth
On a journey north.
The State Apartments keep their
Historical renown,
It's wiser not to sleep there
In case they tumble down'
But still if they ever catch on fire
Which, with any luck, they might
We'll fight
For the Stately Homes  of England
 
The Stately Homes of England,
Though rather in the lurch,
Provide a lot of chances
For Psychical Research-
There's the ghost of a crazy younger son
Who murdered, in thirteen fifty-one,
An extremely rowdy Nun
Who resented it,
And people who come to call
Meet her in the hall.
The baby in the guest wing,
Who crouches by the grate,
Was walled up in the west wing
In fourteen twenty-eight.
If anyone spots
The Queen of Scots
In a hand-embroidered shroud
We're proud
Of the Stately Homes of England.
 
Lord Elderley, Lord Borrowmere,
Lord Sickert and Lord Camp,
Behold us in our hours of ease,
Uncertain, coy and hard to please.
Reading in Debrett of us,
This fine Patrician quartette of us,
We can feel extremely proud,
Our ancient lineage we trace
Back to the cradle of the Race
Before those beastly Roman bowmen
Bitched our local Yeomen.
Through the new democracy
May pain the old Aristocarcy
We've not winced nor cried aloud,
Under the bludgeonings of chance what will be- will be.
Our heads will still be
Bloody but quite unbowed!
 
The Stately Homes of England
In valley, dale and glen
Produce a race of charming,
Innocuous young men.
Though our mental equipment may be slight
And we barely distinguish left from right,
We are quite prepared to fight
For our principles,
Though none of us know so far
What they really are.
Our duty to the nation,
It's only fair to state,
Lies not I pro-creation
But what we pro-create;
And so we can cry
With kindling eye
As to married like we go,
What ho!
For the Stately Homes of England!
 
The Stately Homes of England,
Although a trifle bleak,
Historically speaking,
Are more or less unique.
We've a cousin who won the Golden Fleece
And a very peculiar fowling-piece
Which was sent to Cromwell's niece,
Who detested it,
And rapidly sent it back
With a dirty crack.
A note we have from Chaucer
Contains a bawdy joke.
We also have a saucer
That Bloody Mary broke.
We've two pairs of tights
King Arthur's Knights
Had completely worn away.
Sing Hey!
For the Stately Homes of England.
 
The Stately Homes of England,
Tho' rather on the blink
Provide a lot of reasons
For what we do and think.
Tho' we freely admit we may be wrong,
Our conviction that we are right is strong
Tho' it may not be for long,
We'll hold on to it
We might as well hold the bat
Till they knock us flat
Our dignity of race may
Retire into its shell
Our Minister of Grace may
Defend us none too well
But still if a child
Becomes too wild
And we're forced to use the rod,
Thank God

Hugh Hopper,"I can tell like the ring of a bell
A chime that is clear and true
But if a crack, the sound is flat
Like happiness that's become untrue

Out of the East, the sun flew West
Trailing its golden spray
My heart burns, when fortune turns
The trail to light my way

Days go by, I watch the sky
My eyes forever quest
The sun returns, though my hope yearns
Forever things point the rest

Sun heart burns, moon glow turns
Stars will trade hope for happiness
Hope for happiness, happiness, happiness

Flowers grow wild, just for the child
Sniff this sprinkling bloom
When you grow up, hope colours up
The things that cause us gloom

Tell can you now how fun is made?
It's how happiness is really found
Look for advice, be told more than twice
By people all around

Stars will trade hope for happiness

When this town was so high
We could never come down
When rules did not apply

Nights would end at 6 A.M.
You sleep all day
And then start dancing again
The first to see the end
We did the Continental American

All our clothes from France
Soul Train taught us to dance
We had smoke in our eyes
Friends were lost and found
We were paradise bound
Some got lost, nobody cried

But others took their places
Always strange new faces
Always one more chance to go around

I don't belong like I did before
Nothin' ever seems like it used to be
You can have your dreams, but you can't have me

I can't go back there anymore
'Cause I am not the boy next door

You've been savin' all souvenirs
Faded photographs from my foolish years
We made plans, but they're wearin' thin
And they won't work out 'cause I don't fit in

And those memories will just weigh me down
'Cause I got no place to keep 'em uptown

Before I go, I want you to know that I look back with no regrets
And when our luck was wearing thin and we were down and out
And still came back to win against all bets
Now when I look back I still have no regrets

And it's so hard to say good-byes
When there's so much that's left unspoken in your eyes
But unless I spread my wings again, I'm afraid I'll never soar
So hang on to the memories and hold me close once more

Once more, just once before I go, I want you to know

I want you to know that I have loved you all along
And even when we're far apart

They're building a library for him

Time is a traveler
Tenterfield saddler, turn your head
Ride again, Jackeroo
Think I see kangaroo up ahead

The son of George Woolnough went off and got married and had a war baby
Though something went wrong and it's easier to drink than go crazy
And if there were questions about why the end was so sad
George had no answers about why his son ever had need of a gun

Time is a traveler
Tenterfield saddler, turn your head
Ride again jackeroo
Think I see kangaroo up ahead

The grandson of George has been all around the world
And lives no special place
He changed his last name and he married a girl with an interesting face
He'd almost forgotten them both because in the life that he leads
There's no place for George and his library or the son with the gun
To belong except in this song

Tim is a meddler
Tenterfield saddler, make your bed
Fly again cockatoo
Down on the ground, emu up ahead

Nevermore apart
You have warmed my heart like the sun.
You have brought the gift of life
And love so long denied me.

Suddenly I see
What I could not see
Something suddenly
Has begun",Suddenly,2012
Hugh Jackman,"What have I done?
Sweet Jesus, what have I done?
Become a thief in the night
Become a dog on the run
Have I fallen so far
And is the hour so late
That nothing remains but the cry of my hate
The cries in the dark that nobody hears
Here where I stand at the turning of the years?

If there's another way to go
I missed it twenty long years ago
My life was a war that could never be won
They gave me a number and murdered Valjean
When they chained me and left me for dead
Just for stealing a mouthful of bread

Yet why did I allow that man
To touch my soul and teach me love?
He treated me like any other
He gave me his trust
He called me brother
My life he claims for God above
Can such things be?
For I had come to hate the world
This world that always hated me

Take an eye for an eye
Turn your heart into stone
This is all I have lived for
This is all I have known

One word from him and I'd be back
Beneath the lash, upon the rack
Instead he offers me my freedom
I feel my shame inside me like a knife
He told me that I have a soul
How does he know?
What spirit comes to move my life?
Is there another way to go?

I am reaching, but I fall
And the night is closing in
As I stare into the void
To the whirlpool of my sin
I'll escape now from that world
From the world of Jean Valjean
Jean Valjean is nothing now
Another story must begin",Valjean's Soliloquy,2012
Hugh Jackman,"(Yeah, oh yeah, you got the look)

Girl you got the look (you got the look!)
You're rolling up in the party with one titty out
Oh girl, you got the whole damn
The way your booby be breathing
It makes me wanna scream and shout, yeah

Damn, girl you rockin' that thing
With no support, just watching it swing
May be a mistake, but now she just owning it
""Ay caramba!"" titty girl, you Matt Groening it

I like to think you been looking in the mirror
Said to yourself ""something's not right here
Time to shake things up!"" so you shook one out
Your hair wasn't working, so you took one out
A titty

You're rocking one solo titty, and that's your right
Now you're running this city with one sexy titty
All damn night

She got legs and she knows how to use 'em
Also got one titty out sounds so confusing!
Proving she knows how to get attention
One laid-back titty with no pretention

A strong choice, or just a mistake?
A strong choice, or just a mistake?
Is fashion really what she's all about?
Intentional, or does she even know it's out?

Girl, you're the center of attention
Tell me, is that good or bad?
Cause if it's not on purpose, it would be really sad
Girl, strutting on down the catwalk
What will the people say?
I've seen into the future, and the look is here to stay

Now wait a second
Why's it always gotta be the ladies taking things out?
(Jackman: mmm, whatcha had in mind?)
Something like this groove

Boy, you got the look
Rolling up in the party with one ball out

I don't want to chase you down
I know you see it
You run with me
And I can cut you free
Out of the drudgery and walls you keep in
So trade that typical for something colorful
And if it's crazy, live a little crazy
You can play it sensible, a king of conventional
Or you can risk it all and see

It'll take you to the other side

Or you can do like me

It'll take you to the other side

Okay, my friend, you want to cut me in
Well I hate to tell you, but it just won't happen
So thanks, but no
I think I'm good to go
'Cause I quite enjoy the life you say I'm trapped in
Now I admire you, and that whole show you do
You're onto something, really it's something
But I live among the swells, and we don't pick up peanut shells

Don't you know that I'm okay with this uptown part I get to play
'Cause I got what I need and I don't want to take the ride
I don't need to see the other side
So go and do like you do
I'm good to do like me
Ain't in a cage, so I don't need to take the key
Oh, damn! Can't you see I'm doing fine
I don't need to see the other side

Now is this really how you like to spend your days?
Whiskey and misery, and parties and plays

If I were mixed up with you, I'd be the talk of the town
Disgraced and disowned, another one of the clowns

But you would finally live a little, finally laugh a little
Just let me give you the freedom to dream 
And it'll wake you up and cure your aching
Take your walls and start 'em breaking
Now that's a deal that seems worth taking
But I guess I'll leave that up to you

Well it's intriguing, but to go would cost me greatly
So what percentage of the show would I be taking?

Fair enough, you'd want a piece of all the action
I'd give you seven, we could shake and make it happen

I wasn't born this morning, eighteen would be just fine

Why not just go ahead and ask for nickels on the dime

Fifteen

I'd do eight

Twelve

Maybe nine

If I can't have you

If I can't have you

If I can't have you
I don't wanna be me

Why did it take you so long to
Finally see
That we had love
That you don't find easily

You broke my heart and the price
To pay for that
Is you'll have to live the misery of
Losing what you had

If I can't have you
My words have come to late
I've already turned that page
Don't you look at me back and

That's the part I hate
I'll stay trapped inside my hell
Where it's so hot
That my walls melt

And I can hear a promise
In every lie you said
You'd never tell
If I had only told the truth

Oh I could never trust you to
You'll survive
No I will die
If I can't have you

If I can't have you
Then I'm sorry for the things I
Cost you in the end
My punishment is more than any

Man can stand
I need you in my life
I can't let go
Why don't you stay with me

Tonight
I feel alone
Turn off all the lights
Take me home
If I can't have you

If I can't have you
Then I would be a river
Dried up into dust
I would be imprisoned

If I can't have you
I don't wanna be me

But that kind
Is not so very easy to find

Love can be a flame

May be dead in December

Love can be an evil-doer
Love can be a fog
Love can make you feel like you were a dog

Love can be a snow-capped mountain
Love can be the truth
Love can be an endless fountain of youth

It can be ecstasy
But it's true
It doesn't always happen to you

Love can be a four-score failure
Love can bring you fame

Hugh Martin,"A medicine man I met 
Said don't get yourself in a sweat. 
When things look gray, 
Just shrug and say: 
""it musta been somethin' I et!"" 
""so don't get yourself in a snit, "" he said, 
""tuck your tantrums into your kit instead. 
""it's disarming to be charming,"" 
Quoth the medicine man, 
Whom all agree it's plain to see 
Nobody could be wiser than. 

So if your temper's getting a top hand, 
All you have to do is just stop and 
Pass that peace pipe and bury that hatchet 
Like the Choctaws, Chickasaws, 
Chattahoochee's, Chippewas do. 

If you're feeling mad as a wet hen, 
Mad as you can possibly get, then 
Pass that peace pipe, bury that tomahawk 
Like those Chichamecks, Cherokees, 
Chapultepec's do. 
That cold shoulder never solved a single complaint. 
When you're older, you'll wipe off all of that war 
Paint. 

If you find yourself in a fury, 
Be your own judge and your own jury. 
Pass that peace pipe and bury that hatchet 
Like the Choctaws, Chickasaws, 
Chattahoochee's, Chippewas do. 

If you want to hover out west, too, 
You will soon discover it's best to 
Pass that peace pipe and bury that hatchet 
Like the Choktohs, Changos, 
Chattanooga's, Cheekarohs do. 

Even in colonial days, you 
Know the ceremonial ways to 
Pass that peace pipe and bury that tomahawk 
Like those Chakootamees, Chepacheps 
'n' Chicopees, too. 
Pull your ears in, try to use a little control. 
When ""all clear""'s in, you'll be top man on the totem 
Pole. 

So, if you wanna be an all-right guy 
Not a long face, blues-in-the-night guy 
Write that apology and dispatch it! 
When you quarrel, it's grand to patch it! 
Pass that peace pipe and bury that hatchet 

Like those Choctaws, Chickasaws, 
Chattahoochee's, Chippewas 
And those Chickadees, Cherokees, 
Chapultepecs 
And those Chakootamees, Chepacheps 
'n' Chicopees, Choktohs, Changos,

Hugh Martin,"With my high starched-collar and my high-topped shoes
And my hair piled high upon my head
I went to lose a jolly hour on the trolley
And lost my heart instead
With his light brown derby and his bright green tie
He was quite the handsomest of men
I started to yen so I counted to ten 
Then I counted to ten again

Clang, clang, clang went the trolley
Ding, ding, ding went the bell
Zing, zing, zing went my heart strings
From the moment I saw him I fell
Chug, chug, chug went the motor
Bump, bump, bump went the brake
Thump, thump, thump went my heart strings
When he smiled I could feel the car shake
He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name, I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

Buzz, buzz, buzz went the buzzer
Plop, plop, plop went the wheels
Stop, stop, stop went my heart strings
As he started to go then I started to know how it feels
When the universe reels

The day was bright, the air was sweet
The smell of honeysuckle charmed you off your feet
You tried to sing, but couldn't squeak
In fact you loved him so you couldn't even speak

Buzz, buzz, buzz went the buzzer
Plop, plop, plop went the wheels
Stop, stop, stop went my heart strings
As he started to leave
I took hold of his sleeve with my hand
And as if it were planned
He stayed on with me and it was grand just to stand
With his hand holding mine to the end of the line",The Trolley Song,1997

And since the place I built for you once meant so much to me
Thought I'd drop by and see it one more time
I parked the car got out and looked it over
The unkept lawn now seemed so strange to me
That rambling rose that I'd set out with tender care had died
And weeds grow now where flowers used to be
I walked up close looked through the picture window

I listened close and almost heard those tender words of love
As I sat by the fireside with you

Cuando la tarde languidece
Renacen las sombras
Y en su quietud los cafetales
Vuelven a sentir
Esa triste canción de amor
De la vieja molienda
Que en el letargo de la noche
Parece gemir

Una pena de amor, una tristeza
Lleva el sambo Manuel en su amargura

Se deja sentir",Moliendo Cafe,1993

Hugo del Carril,"Acaricia mi sueño
El suave murmullo de tu suspirar
Como ríe la vida
Si tus ojos negros me quieren mirar
Y si es mío el amparo
De tu risa leve
Que es como un cantar
Ella quieta mi herida
Todo, todo se olvida

El día que me quieras
La rosa que engalana
Se vestirá de fiesta
Con su mejor color
Y al viento las campanas
Dirán que ya eres mía
Y locas las fontanas
Se contaran su amor

La noche que me quieras
Desde el azul del cielo
Las estrellas celosas
Nos miraran pasar
Y un rayo misterioso
Hará nido en tu pelo
Luciérnaga curiosa
Que vera que eres mi consuelo

El día que me quieras
No habrá mas que armonía
Será clara la aurora
Y alegre el manantial
Traerá quieta la brisa
Rumor de melodías
Y nos darán las fuentes
Su canto de cristal

El día que me quieras
Endulzara sus cuerdas
El pájaro cantor
Florecerá la vida
No existirá el dolor

se empeño en deshacer...
Si fui flojo, si fui ciego,

y que nunca volverá.

Por seguir tras de su huella
yo bebí incansablemente
en mi copa de dolor,

en cada vuelta dejaba
pedazos de corazón.

Su boca que era mía ya no me besa mas
Se apagaron los ecos de su reír sonoro
Y es cruel este silencio que me haré tanto mal
Fue mía la piadosa dulzura de sus manos
Que dieron a mis penas caricias de bondad
Y ahora que la evoco hundido en mi quebranto
Las lagrimas trenzadas se niegan a brotar
Y no tengo el consuelo de poder llorar

¿Porque sus alas tan cruel quemó la vida
Por que esta mueca siniestra de la suerte? 
Quise abrigarla y mas pudo la muerte
Como me duele y se ahonda mi herida
Yo se que ahora vendrán caras extrañas
Con su limosna de alivio a mi quebranto
Todo es mentira, mentira es el lamento
Hoy esta solo mi corazón
Como perros de presa las penas traicioneras

Celando mi cariño galopaban detrás
Y escondida en las aguas de su mirada buena
La muerte agazapada marcaba su compás
En vano yo alentaba febril una esperanza
Clavó en mi carne viva sus garras el dolor
y mientras en la calle en loca algarabía
El carnaval del mundo gozaba y se reía
Burlándose el destino me robo su amor

 I
Milonga pa' recordarte.
Milonga sentimental.
Otros se quejan llorando
yo canto pa' no llorar.
Tu amor se seco de golpe
nunca dijiste por que.
Yo me consuelo pensando
que fue traición de mujer.

 II
Varon, pa' quererte mucho,
varon, pa' desearte el bien,
varon, pa' olvidar agravios
porque ya te perdone.
Tal vez no lo sepas nunca,
tal vez no lo puedas creer,
tal vez te provoque risa
!verme tirao a tus pies!

 III
Es facil pegar un tajo
pa' cobrar una traición
o jugar en una daga
la suerte de una pasión.
Pero no es facil cortarse
los tientos de un metejon
cuando estan bien amarrados
al palo del corazón.

 II (bis)
Varon, pa' quererte mucho, etc.
Milonga que hizo tu ausencia.
Milonga de evocación.
Milonga para que nunca
la canten en tu balcon.
Pa' que vuelvas con la noche
why te vayas con el sol.
Pa' decirte que si, a veces,
o pa' gritarte que no.

Fayando y fayando
Te largue parao
Cuando estés bien en la vía
Sin rumbo, desesperao

Cuando no tengas ni fe
Ni yerba de ayer
Secándose al sol

Cuando rajes los tamangos
Buscando ese mango
Que te haga morfar

La indiferencia del mundo
Que es sordo y es mudo
Recién sentirás

Verás que todo es mentira
Verás que nada es amor
Que al mundo nada le importa
Yira, yira

Aunque te quiebre la vida
Aunque te muerda un dolor
No esperes nunca una ayuda
Ni una mano, ni un favor

Cuando estén secas las pilas
De todos los timbres que vos apretás
Buscando un pecho fraterno
Para morir abrazao

Cuando te dejen tirao
Después de cinchar
Lo mismo que a mí

Cuando manyés que a tu lado
Se prueban la ropa
Que vas a dejar

Te acordarás de este otario
Que un día, cansado
Se puso a ladrar

Verás que todo es mentira
Verás que nada es amor
Que al mundo nada le importa
Yira, yira

Aunque te quiebre la vida
Aunque te muerda un dolor
No esperes nunca una ayuda
Ni una mano, ni un favor

Aunque te quiebres la vida
Yira, yira
Ya verás que en la vida todo es mentira
No sufras siempre vente yira yira

Aunque te quiebre la vida
Yira, yira
Te criticaran, te adularan y te enviaran
No hagas caso lo que digan

Aunque te quiebre la vida
Yira, yira
De arriba abajo te miran
Hay que gente engreída y atrevida

Aunque te quiebre la vida

Aunque te quiebre la vida
Aunque te muerda un dolor
No esperes nunca una ayuda
Ni una mano, ni un favor

Hugo Diaz,"San Juan y boedo antigua  y todo el cielo
Pompeya y más allá la inundación
Tu melena de novia en el recuerdo
Y tu nombre florando en el adiós

La esquina del herrero, barro y pampa
Tu casa, tu vereda y el zanjón
Y un perfume de yuyos y de alfalfa
Que me llena de nuevo el corazón

Sur, paredón y después
Sur, una luz de almacén
Ya nunca me verás cómo me vieras
Recostado en la vidriera y esperándote

Ya nunca alumbraré con las estrellas
Nuestra marcha sin querellas
Por las noches de Pompeya

Las calles y las lunas suburbanas
Y mi amor y tu ventana
Todo ha muerto, ya lo sé

San Juan y boedo antiguo, cielo perdido
Pompeya y al llegar al terraplén
Tus veinte años temblando de cariño
Bajo el beso que entonces te robé

Nostalgias de las cosas que han pasado
Arena que la vida se llevó
Pesadumbre de barrios que han cambiado
Y amargura del sueño que murió

Hugo Montenegro,"I once had a girl 
Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath 

And when I awoke I was alone

So I lit a fire

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

He wanted to give her everything
Flowers, presents and most of all, a wedding ring
He saw a sign for a stock car race
A thousand dollar prize it read
He couldn't get Laura on the phone
So to her mother Tommy said

Tell Laura I love her, tell Laura I need her
Tell Laura I may be late
I've something to do, that cannot wait

He was the youngest driver there
The crowed roared as they started the race
'Round the track they drove at a deadly pace

Well it's a darn good life
And it's kinda funny
How the Lord made the bee
And the bee made the honey
And the honeybee lookin' for a home
And they called it honeycomb
And they roamed the world and they gathered all
Of the honeycomb into one sweet ball
And the honeycomb from a million trips
Made my baby's lips

He wanted to give her everything
Flowers, presents and most of all, a wedding ring
He saw a sign for a stock car race
A thousand dollar prize it read
He couldn't get Laura on the phone
So to her mother Tommy said

Tell Laura I love her, tell Laura I need her
Tell Laura I may be late
I've something to do, that cannot wait

He drove his car to the racing grounds
He was the youngest driver there
The crowed roared as they started the race
'Round the track they drove at a deadly pace
No one knows what happened that day
How his car overturned in flames
But as they pulled him from the twisted wreck
With his dying breath, they heard him say

Tell Laura not to cry
My love for her will never die

Never were, really are, nearly are?

Will you ever be done traveling
Always unraveling you, you?
Running away could lead you further astray
And as for fishing in streams for pieces of dreams
Those pieces will never fit 
What is the sense of it?

It's time ,come blow your horn, meet the morn
Look and see, can you be far from home?

Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

Was the most I bargained for

I found the love that I couldn't ignore

I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part

You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon,1995

Every time I look at you
I can't keep still
You're my thrill",You're My Thrill,1955
Hugo Winterhalter & His Orchestra,"Everybody's mambo crazy
Cha-cha happy, but I'm lazy
I don't dig that frantic turpsichord

When I trip the light fantastic
I don't wanna be gymnastic
That's not what a dancing floor is for

What I got in mind is a big improvement
With a very minimum amount of movement
Let the other couples push and shove
What I got in mind I think you're gonna love

I got a new-fangled tango
And there's nothing to it
You just sort of stand there
And just sort of do it

You stand close together
There's no wasted motion
A new fangled tango
An old fashioned motion

The floor may be crowded
But that doesn't matter
It's not necessary to move
Don't move, why move

It may be crowded
But that's all the better
It's just like romancing, while dancing
Who's dancin'

You start off with one step
And cling to each other
And you know how one step
Can lead to another

Oh, there's nothing wrong with
A waltz or fandango
But oh, what can come from
A new fangled tango

You cling to your partner
And sway to the rhythm
You can't lose your partner
'Cause you're right there with him

You don't have to be worry
About fast or slow steps
The nice part about it
In this dance, you don't need steps

You don't have to worry
If your dancing won't do
It's not what you do do
It's more what you don't do

You don't need a waltz
Or a fancy fandango
You just need a man
And a new fangled tango

Forget the fandango
Give up the mambo
Do the tango",New-Fangled Tango,1992
Hugo Winterhalter & His Orchestra,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon,1994
Hugo Winterhalter & His Orchestra,"Danger! Heartbreak ahead
Look out little fool you're not wise
Not wise to love so completely
Or fall for that look in his eyes
Danger! Heartbreak ahead
Be sure little heart for you know
Yes you know what happen to you before
There's danger, travel slow
Does his kiss really mean what you think it means?
Are the words that he whispers true?
Are you sure you understand the touch of his hand?
Does his touch mean too much to you?
Maybe, I could be wrong
But, go slow little fool, for it?s said
That love either finds you, or love either binds you
To the danger of a heartbreak ahead
Does his kiss really mean what you think it means?
Are the words that he whispers true?
Are you sure you understand the touch of his hand?
Does his touch mean too much to you?
Maybe, I could be wrong
But, go slow little fool, for it?s said
That love either finds you, or love either binds you
To the danger of a heartbreak ahead",Danger! Heartbreak Ahead,1997
Hugo Winterhalter & His Orchestra,"I took the longest walk
In the world last night
From your arms to your front door
I heard the saddest words
In the world last night
When you said you loved me no more
I won't believe it's true
I'll keep after you
Till we love like we loved before
And then the longest walk
Will be the shortest walk
Back to your arms once more
And then the longest walk
Will be the shortest walk
Back to your arms once more
Back to your arms once more",The Longest Walk,1997
Hugo Winterhalter & His Orchestra,"When you play at love
Play for keeps
Don't just play at love
Play for keeps

If you're about to fold
Risk your heart
Not just a part
But all your heart

In the game of love
More or less
You must use your heart to win
Happiness

And so if there's a chance
That our romance
Is meant to be
Darling play for keeps
And keep your love for me

And so if there's a chance
That our romance
Is meant to be
Darling play for keeps
And keep all your love for me",Play for Keeps,1997
