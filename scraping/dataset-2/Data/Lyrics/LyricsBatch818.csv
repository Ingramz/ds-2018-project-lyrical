Patrice Rushen,"We've, got a message in the music...
And we, know exactly how to use it...
A message comin' from the soul...
Want you to listen young and old...

We're not just writing any song...
That you can dance to all night long...
Please correct me if I'm wrong...
But this music is a strong...

Way for us to communicate...
I gotta let it have it's way...

{Bridge}
Let it take you to a place...
Only music can provide...
Let it make you feel as if..
You can really touch the sky!",Message in the Music [Album Version],2007
Patrice Rushen,"Sending you forget me nots
To help me to remember
Baby please forget me not
I want you to remember

Those were the times we had
Sharing a joy that we thought would last
Memories of love and affection
Never really was just like a dream
Was it the simple things
That made me so crazy about you
Was it your charm or your passion
It's not hard to believe
I love you and I need you so I

To help me to remember
Baby please forget me not
I want you to remember

Sending you forget me nots
To help me to remember
Baby please forget me not
I want you to remember

Did we give up too soon
Maybe we needed just a little room
Wondering how it all happened
Maybe we just need a little time
Though we did end as friends
Given the chance we could love again
She'll always love you forever
It's not hard to believe
I want you and I need you so I

Baby please forgive me not

They weren't so bad
What a life we shared 
Pretty baby I still care

To help me to remember
Baby please forget me not",Forget-Me-Nots,2017
Patrice Tison,"Souviens-toi
Etait-ce mai, novembre
Ici ou là ?
Etait-ce un lundi ?
Je ne me souviens que d'un mur immense
Mais nous étions ensemble
Ensemble, nous l'avons franchi

Reviens-moi
De tes voyages si loin
Reviens-moi
Tout s'ajoute à ma vie
J'ai besoin de nos chemins qui se croisent
Quand le temps nous rassemble
Ensemble, tout est plus joli.

For you
There might be another star
But through my eyes the light of you it's all I see 
For you
There might be another song
But all my heart can hear is your melody 
So long ago my heart without demanding
Informed me that no other love could do
But listen did I not though understanding
Fell in love with one
Who would break my heart in two 
For you
Love might bring a toast of wine
But which each sparkle know the best for you I pray 
For you
Love might be for you to find
But I will celebrate our love of yesterday 
So long ago my heart without demanding
Informed me that no other love could do
But listen did I not though understanding
Fell in love with one
Who would break my heart in two 
For you
There might be another star
But through my eyes the light of you it's all I see 
For you
There might be another song
But in my heart your melody will stay with me",Another Star,2002
Patrice Williamson,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

Patrice Williamson,"Love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing
But night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

I intend to be independently blue
I want your love but I don't want to borrow
I have it today and give back tomorrow
For my love is your love but there's no love for nobody else",Love Me or Leave Me,2002
Patrice Williamson,"With a song in my heart, I behold your adorable face
Just a song at the start but it soon is a hymn to your grace
When the music swells, I'm touching your hand
It tells me you're standing near, and

At the sound of your voice, heaven opens its portals to me
Can I help but rejoice that a song such as ours came to be
But I always knew I would live life through
With a song in my heart for you

But I always knew I would live life through
With a song in my heart for you",With a Song in My Heart,2002
Patricia Adams,"Every honey bee fills with jealousy
When they see you out with me

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

When you're passin' by flowers droop and sigh,
And I know the reason why

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

Don't buy sugar
You just have to touch my cup
You're my sugar
It's sweeter when you stir it up

When I'm taking sips from your tasty lips
Seems the honey fairly drips

Patricia Adams,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful,1998
Patricia Adams,"I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast
I fall in love too terribly hard, for love to ever last
My heart should be well schooled, 'cause I've been fooled in the past
And still I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast
 
I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast

Patricia Adams,"Today I may not have a thing at all
Except for just a dream or two
But I've got lots of plans for tomorrow
And all my tomorrows belong to you

Right now it may not seem like spring at all
We're drifting and the laughs are few
But I've got rainbows planned for tomorrow
And all my tomorrows belong to you

No one knows better than I
That luck keeps passing me by, that's fate
But with you there at my side
I'll soon be turning the tide, just wait

As long as I've got arms that cling at all
It's you that I'll be clinging to
And all the dreams I dream, beg, or borrow
On some bright tomorrow they'll all come true

And all my bright tomorrows belong to you",All My Tomorrows,2001
Patricia Adams,"Took each word she said as gospel truth the way a silly little child would.
I can't excuse it on the grounds of youth, 
I was no babe in the wild, wild wood.
She didn't mean it, 
I should have seen it, 
But now it's too late.

I thought I'd found the girl of my dreams, 
Now it seems, 
This is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
I thought for once it couldn't go wrong, 
Not for long, 
I can see the way this ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
Why should I care though she gave me the air,
Why should I cry, 
Heave a sigh, 
And wonder why, 
And wonder why?
I thought I found the gal I could trust, 
What a bust, this is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be just friends?""",Can't We Be Friends?,2001
Patricia Adams,"Everything has its season 
Everything has its time
Show me a reason
And I'll soon show you a rhyme

Cats sit on the window sill
Children sit in the show
Why do I feel I don't fit in
Anywhere I go

Rivers belong where they can ramble
Eagles belong where they can fly
I've got to be where my spirit can run free
Gotta find my corner, of the sky

Every man his daydreams 
Every man has his goal
People like the way dreams have of 
Sticking to the soul

Rain comes after thunder
Winter comes after fall
Sometimes I think I'm not after
Anything at all

So many men seem destined
To settle for something small
But I, I won't rest
'Til I know I have it all
So don't ask where I'm going
Just listen when I'm gone
Far away you'll hear me singing
Softly to the dawn

Oh, rivers belong where they can ramble, 
Oh, eagles belong where they can fly
I've got to be where my spirit can run free, yeah
Gotta find my corner, ooh of the sky, yeah (of the sky, yeah)
Rivers belong where they can ramble
Oh, eagles belong where they can fly (high)
Oh, I've got to be where my spirit can run free
Gotta find my corner
Gotta find my corner, yes I do
Gotta find my corner
Gotta find my corner of the sky, sky
Gotta find my corner of the sky, sky",Corner of the Sky,2001
Patricia Adams,"Hush now don't explain
I know you raise Cain
I'm glad you're back
Don't explain

Quiet, don't explain
You mixed with some dame
Skip that lipstick
Don't explain

You know that I love you and what love endures
All my thoughts are of you
For I'm so completely yours
Cry to hear folks chatter, and I know you cheat
But right and wrong don't matter when you're with me sleep

Hush now, don't explain
You're my joy and pain
My life's yours love
Don't explain",Don't Explain,2001
Patricia Adams,"In a dream the strangest and the oddest things appear
And what insane and silly things we do
Here is what I see before me, vividly and clear
As I recall it, you were in it, too

I had the craziest dream last night, yes I did
I never dreamt it could be
Yet there you were, in love with me
I found your lips close to mine so I kissed you
And you didn't mind it at all
When I'm awake such a break never happens
How long can a gal go on dreaming?

If there's a chance that you care
Then, please, say you do, Baby
Say it and make my craziest dream come true",I Had the Craziest Dream,2001
Patricia Adams,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,2001
Patricia Adams,"I'll always love you the same old way
No matter what may come between
Just send me a smile
Once in a lonely while
Tell me, you'll wait for me

How can I forget you starry eyes
You hair when its lit by the moonlit skies
Just keep that smile in you
'Til I come home to you
Tell me, you'll wait for me

You're the one, you're the one
Whom I love, and care so much for
But now, 'til it ends, I'll just wish to be near
Caressing you dear

I'll always dream of dreams with you
Those things we meant to say and do
Keep them a glow(?)
Someday we'll make them so
And tell me, you'll wait for me

I'll always dream of dreams with you
Those things we meant to say and do
Keep them a glow(?)
Someday we'll make them so
Tell me, you'll wait for me",Tell Me You'll Wait for Me,2001
Patricia Adams,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,2005
Patricia Adams,"Don't worry 'bout me
I'll get along
Forget about me
Just be happy my love

Let's say that our little show is over
And so the story ends
Why not call it a day the sensible way
And still be friends

Look out for yourself
That should be the rule
Give your heart and your love
To whomever you love
Darlin' don't be a fool

Why do we cling to this old faded thing
That used to be
So if you can forget
Then don't worry 'bout me

Why should we cling to some old faded thing
That used to be
So if you can forget
Then you don't worry 'bout me",Don't Worry 'Bout Me,2008
Patricia Barber,"The party's over, the game is ended, 
the dreams I dreamed went up in smoke.
They didn't pan out as I had intended; 
I should know how to take a joke.

I'll go my way by myself, this is the end of romance. 
I'll go my way by myself, love is only a dance. 
I'll try to apply myself and teach my heart to sing. 
I'll go my way by myself like a bird on the wing,
I'll face the unknown, I'll build a world of my own; 
No one knows better than I, myself, I'm by myself alone.
I'll go my way by myself, here's how the comedy ends. 
I'll have to deny myself love and laughter and friends.
Grey clouds in sky above have put a blot on my fun. 
I'll try to fly high above for a place in the sun.
I'll face the unknown, I'll build a world of my own; 
No one knows better than I, myself, I'm by myself alone.",Be Myself,1992
Patricia Barber,"I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
When it's cold outside I've got the month of May

I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees

Patricia Barber,"You stepped out of a dream
You are too wonderful to be what you seem!
Could there be eyes like yours, 
Could there be lips like yours
Could there be smiles like yours, 
Honest and truly?
You stepped out of a cloud
I want to take you away, away from the crowd
And have you all to myself, 
Alone and apart out of a dream, 
Safe in my heart

Patricia Barber,"It was the third of June
Another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton
And my brother was balin' hay

At dinner time we stopped
Walked back to the house to eat
Mama hollered out the back door
""Y'all remember to wipe your feet""

Then she said, ""I got some news
This mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billy Joe Mac Allister
Jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

Papa said to Mama as he passed
Around the black eyed peas
""Well, Billy Joe never had a lick of sense
Pass the biscuits, please""

""There's five more acres
In the lower forty I've got to plow""
Mama said it was shame
About Billy Joe, anyhow

Seems like nothin' ever comes
To no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe Mac Allister's
Jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

Mama said to me
""Child, what's happened to your appetite?
I've been cookin' all mornin'
And you haven't touched a single bite""

""That nice young preacher
Brother Taylor, dropped by today
Said he'd be pleased to have a dinner
On Sunday, oh, by the way""

""He said he saw a girl that looked a lot
Like you up on Choctaw Ridge""
""And she and Billy Joe were throwing
Somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

Well, a year has come 'n' gone
Since we heard the news about Billy Joe
Brother married Becky Thompson
Bought a store in Tupelo

There was a virus going 'round
Papa caught it and he died last Spring
Now Mama doesn't seem
To wanna do much of anything

And me, I spend a lot of time
Pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water
Off the Tallahatchie Bridge

",Ode to Billy Joe,1994
Patricia Barber,"This isn't sometimes, this is always.
This isn't maybe, this is always.
This is love,
The real beginning of forever,
This isn't just mid summer madness,
A passing glow, a moment's gladness,
Yes it's love.
I knew it on the night we met,
You tied a string around my heart,
So how can I forget you.
With every kiss I know that
This is always.",Romanesque,1994

Patricia Barber,"When an early autumn walks the land and chills the breeze
And touches with her hand the summer trees,
Perhaps you'll understand what memories I own.
There's a dance pavilion in the rain all shuttered down,

A winding country lane all russet brown,
A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely.
That spring of ours that started so April-hearted,
Seemed made for just a boy and girl.

I never dreamed, did you, any fall would come in view
So early, early.
Darling if you care, please, let me know,
I'll meet you anywhere, I miss you so.

Patricia Barber,"You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize, all others above
So worth the yearning for
So worth keeping the home fires burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together that it's
It does seem a shame
That you can't see your future with me
'Cause you'd be oh so easy to love

I'll be tired of you  when stars are tired of gleaming
When I am tired of dreaming, then I'll be tired of  you.
This I know is true, when winds are tired of blowing,
When grass is tired of growing, then I'll be tired  of you.

Beyond the years, 
'Til day is night, 'til wrong is right,

And men still keep on marching off to war

Patricia Barber,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Patricia Barber,"What's it all about, Alfie?
Is it just for the moment we live?
What's it all about when you sort it out, Alfie?
Are we meant to take more than we give
or are we meant to be kind?
And if only fools are kind, Alfie,
then I guess it's wise to be cruel.
And if life belongs only to the strong, Alfie,
what will you lend on an old golden rule?
As sure as I believe there's a heaven above, Alfie,
I know there's something much more,
something even non-believers can believe in.
I believe in love, Alfie.
Without true love we just exist, Alfie.

We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

For flames live such a little while

Man made the boat for the water

And the baby boys
Man makes them happy
'Cause man made the toys

Everything he can

Sur une guitare, sur une violin
Qu'il soit trop tard, qu'il soit trop long
Sur un boulevard ou sous un pont
Le sans-logis fait sa chanson

Sur une guitare sur un violin
Sur un tam-tam do gabon
Sur une batterie à l'occasion
Le sans-patrie fait sa chanson

Si la vérité sort de la bouche do métro
Si le monde entier dit qu'on a tort d'aimer trop
Quand l'hiver est rude et qu'on cri ""chaud les marrons""
Le sans-abri fait sa chanson

La liberté
See'est pas la porte à côté
La liberté
See'est le bout do monde

Sur une guitare, sur un violin
Sur des gamelles et des bidons
A tout hasard sous les balcons
Le sans-papiers fait sa chanson

Sur une guitare, sur un violin
Sur un air de duke ellington
A bout de souffle, à bout de son
Le sans-le-sou fait sa chanson

Si la vérité sort de la bouche do métro
Si le monde entier dit qu'on a tort d'aimer trop
Quand l'hiver est rude et qu'on crie ""chaud les marrons""
Le sans-culotte fait sa chanson

De n'être que tué
Plus une seconde passe
Dans les vies d'uniformité
Quand de peine en méfiance
De larmes en plus jamais
Puis de dépit en défiance
On apprend à se résigner
Viennent les heures sombres
Où tout peut enfin s'allumer

Il me dit que je suis belle
Et qu'il n'attendait que moi
Il me dit que je suis celle

De mots qui n'existent pas
De toujours et de tendresse
Et je n'entends que sa voix

Éviter les regards, prendre cet air absent
Celui qu'ont les gens sur les boulevards
Cet air qui les rend transparents
Apprendre à tourner les yeux
Devant les gens qui s'aiment
Éviter tous ceux qui marchent à deux
Ceux qui s'embrassent à perdre haleine
Y a-t-il un soir, un moment
Où l'on se dit c'est plus pour moi
Tous les mots doux, les coups de sang
Mais dans mes rêves, j'y ai droit

Il me dit que je suis belle
Et qu'il n'attendait que moi
Il me dit que je suis celle
Juste faite pour ses bras

Qu'un enfant ne croirait pas
Mais les nuits sont mes églises
Et dans mes rêves j'y crois

Avec sa belle voix do soudan
Et son feeling renversant

Elle s'rait pas morte sur un trottoir
En perdant doucement tout son sang
Devant un hôpital de blancs.

Qui savent qu'on est tout differents
Peut-ítr' qu'un soir, incidemment
Toutes les deux on aurait pu faire

Avant que l'automne ait mis aux arbres
Des cheveux roux.

Avant que l'amour m'ait travesti
Avant que les hommes ait pris mon coeur

Avant qu'une étoile m'apostrophe

Elles voulaient vite et fort
Et elles avaient pas tort
Et moi je suis comme elles
Comme elles comme elles.
",Vénus des Abribus,1994
Patricia Kaas,"(d. barbelivien/f. bernheim)

Avec le coeur à marée basse
Avec un talon qui se casse
Avec des gestes maladroits
Et des sentiments bien à moi
Avec des plages en promenade
Et des nuages de limonade
Sous les tilleuls comme il disait
Arthur rimbaud, poète français.

Avec la passion sur la bouche
Avec nos sexes qui se touchent
Avec des frissons de mystère
Des retrouvailles à la frontière
Avec des wagons d'inquiétude
Au fond d'une gare de solitude
J'te demande pardon d'avoir écrit
Une chanson d'amour pas finie
Pas finie.
",Chanson d'Amour Pas Finie,1995
Patricia Kaas,"(b. barbelivien/f. bernheim)

Maestro
Please
Des mensonges en musique

Vous qui vendez des mots
Des mensonges en musique
Montrez-moi la photo
D'un amour héroique
Montrez-moi comme vous dites
Romantiques et bluesy
Vos chansons mal écrites
Mal chantées mal aimées mal jouées
Moi see'est ma vie

Rien que ce piano là
Des fois ça me suffit
Rien que vous dire
Comme ça
Je vous aime pour la vie
Toujours chanter l'amour
Emouvante plaidoirie
De choisir sans détour
Passion mystère jalousie

Vous qui vendez des mots
Des mensonges en musique
Emmenez-moi en bateau
Ver toutes les amériques
Prenez-moi dans vos bras
Je vous connais gatsby
Soyez ma tequila
Mon gin-fizz, ma vodka
Mon drambuie
So long baby.

Tiens vous ne m'embrassez pas
Qu'est-ceq ui vous prend chéri
Ce soir je ne vous plais pas
Ah vous aussi
Toujours chanter l'amour
Quelle fatigante comédie
Etre veuve ou velours
Faire la guerre ou la vie

Patricia Kaas,"Elle voulait jouer cabaret 
Sur un paquebot de contrebande 
Pas dans un bastringue marseillais 
Avec des marins qui lui d'mandent 
Une chambre d'hôtel sur la mer 
Histoire de faire le tour du monde 
D'être la fiancée du Corsaire 
Tout en restant une putain d'blonde 

Qui chant'rait ""Blue Bayou"" 
En dansant sur les tables 
Tout en étant capable 
De faire peur aux voyous 
Et chanter ""Only You"" 
En buvant dans les verres 
Un fond de Picon bière 
Qui rend à moitié fou 

Elle voulait jouer cabaret 
Pas les serveuses, les filles de salle 
Pourtant Dieu sait qu'elle s'en foutait 
D'avoir le cœur et les mains sales 
Elle venait d'une grande ville du Nord 
Où on a fermé les usines 
Là où le soleil vaut de l'or 
Elle savait depuis toute gamine 

Elle voulait jouer cabaret 
Pas les madelons d'infortune 
Je peux vous dire qu'elle en rêvait 
D'un jazz band sous un clair de lune 
D'un chapeau claque avec des strass 
Comme les vedettes américaines 
Pas d'un néon sur la terrasse 
Et l'accordéon qui se traîne",Elle Voulait Jouer Cabaret,1995

D'autres parlent et s'entêtent
Pour ceux qui se sont tus
Rien ne s'arrête
Les amours se décollent
Et même si l'on regrette
Le temps lui continue son vol
Rien ne s'arrête

La vie s'avance
On fait des erreurs
Mais pas dans l'sens
Qu'indiquait notre c?ur
On se dit cette fois j'ai compris
Et l'on s'arrête à l'infini

Refrain

Pont :

On a en nous tant d'espérances
Malgré la peur
Que même si nos rêves s'achèvent en silence
Je crois qu'ils continuent ailleurs

Patricia Kaas,"I wish you bluebirds in the spring
To give your heart a song to sing
And then a kiss but more than this
I wish you love

And in July, a lemonade
To cool you in some leafy glade
I wish you health and more than wealth
I wish you love

My breaking heart and I agree
That you and I could never be
So with my best, my very best
I set you free

I wish you shelter from the storm
A cozy fire to keep you warm
But most of all when snowflakes fall
I wish you love

All kinds of love
I wish you love

Patricia Kaas,"If you go away on this summer day
Then you might as well take the sun away
All the birds that flew in a summer sky
When our love was new and our hearts were high
When the day was young and the night was lo-ong
And the moon stood still for the night birds song
If you go away, If you go away, If you go away

But if you stay I'll make you a day
Like no day has been or will be again
We'll sail on the sun, we'll ride on the rain
We'll talk to the trees and worship the wind
Then if you go-o I'll understand
Leave me just enough love to fill up my hand
If you go away, If you go away, If you go away

If you go away as I know you must
There'll be nothin' left in the world to trust
Just an empty room full of empty space
Like the empty look I see on your face 
Can I tell you now as you turn to go
I'll be dying slowly till your next hello
If you go away, If you go away, If you go away

But if you stay, I'll make you a night
Like no night has been or will be again
I'll sail on your smile, I'll ride on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes that I-I love so much
But if you go, I won't cry
For the good's gone from goodbye
If you go away, If you go away, If you go away",If You Go Away (Ne Me Quitte Pas),2002
Patricia Kaas,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space

Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

Patricia Kaas,"It's cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet
But all that I soon forget 
With my man
He's not much for looks 
And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms

Patricia Kaas,"The summer smiles, the summer knows
And unashamed she sheds so close
The summer smooth, the restless kind
And lovingly she warms the sand on which you lie

The summer knows, the summer's wise
She sees the doubt within your eyes
And so she takes her summer times
Tells the moon to wait and the sun to linger
Twists the world from her summer finger
Lets you see the wonder of it all

The summer smiles, the summer knows
And unashamed she sheds so close
The summer smooth, the restless kind
And lovingly she warms the sand on which you lie

And if you learned your lesson well
There's little more for her to tell
One last caress, it's time to dress for fall

",The Summer Knows (Un Été 42),2002
Patricia Kaas,"What now my love, now that you left me
How can I live through another day
Watching my dreams turning to ashes
And my hopes into bits of clay

Once I could see, once I could feel
Now I am numb, I've become unreal
I walk the night without a goal
Stripped of my heart and my soul

What now my love, now that it's over
I feel the world closing in on me
Here come the stars tumbling around me
There's the sky where the sea should be

What now my love, now that you're gone
I'd be a fool to go on, on and on
No one would care, no one would cry
If I should live or die

",What Now My Love (Et Maintenant),2002
Patricia Kaas,"Where do I begin
To tell the story of how great a love can be;
The sweet love story that is older than the sea,
The simple truth about the love he brings to me?
Where do I start?

With his first hello,
He gave new meaning to this empty world of mine,
There'll never be another love, another time,
He came into my life and made the living fine,
He fills my heart,

He fills my heart with very special things,
With angels' songs, with wild imaginings,
He fills my soul with so much love,
That anywhere I go I'm never lonely;
With him along, who could be lonely?
I reach for his hand, it's always there

How long does it last?
Can love be measured by the hours in a day?
I have no answers now but this much I can say:
I know I'll need him till the stars all burn away,
And he'll be there.",Where Do I Begin (Love Story),2002

Move on to another chick no
Hoes don't front when you settle in close
Messing with a heart that ain't ever been broke
Let it burn hot without letting it smoke
Pieces hope she gets blowed
Leaking those secrets, but put the past away
I never let it drown what we have today
And I rock, when I rock & roll
Make it slap when I've got to go
To the spot when it's hot & cold
And I'm tryna move on but I've got to know
When I'm living a lie killing the vibe
Never gone back but I'm willing to try
Stick to the party, drinks when it all seems bad
When I make a big deal out of small things

Out in L.A. Now with the porn star
In her blue on black Cadillac car
Word, vintage drunk text to an ex
And past chicks hard to get past

Hard to get back when the high is spaceship

How could I blame you
Out in the city of lights I figured in time
The city would change you

Que corre why no se preda
Why la sangre a mi me quema, ven why explícame
Escucho la salsa why pierdo la cabeza, sientiéndolo
Bailandolo de cerca, me puede encender
Miradas que me acechan al bailar
Provocándome el deseo fatal
Que declara guerra salsa en filo de amor
Hasta el grado de quererlo hacer

Salsa, llévame contigo sensualmente a soñar
Salsa, all you wanna do is drive me crazy through the night

Rico, pasito, pa'lante, why al la'ito
Se mueva conmigo why encuentra mi suspiro
Sí, que me baile bien
No puedo evitar el que paren mis caderas
Volviéndome loca de esa manera
Sí, me provocas bien
Why siento por la espalda como corre
El sudor que suelto hare explotar
Why me siento tan mujer cuando te bailo

Patricia Manterola,"Please don't say a word
'Cause I'll fall back to earth
And I've been so used to
Being up here in the clouds

But somehow it seems
Like the end of a dream
I prayed, I'd never wake up
But I see the dawn breakin' out

If this is the last kiss
Please grant me one last wish
If you're sayin' goodbye then
Take my heart with you

'Cause I don't need it
It won't beat if you're not by my side
So if you're leaving
Please take my heart

Don't try to explain
'Cause it won't ease the pain
And you might as well try to convince me
The sun will shine after the rain

If this is the last kiss
Please grant me one last wish
If you're sayin' goodbye then
Take my heart with you

'Cause I don't need it
It won't beat if you're not by my side
So if you're leaving
Please take my heart

Somewhere, someday
Somehow you'll see
Your heart is meant for mine
And you'll bring it back to me

If this is the last kiss
Please grant me one last wish
If you're sayin' goodbye then
Take my heart with you

Patricia Manterola,"Si el corazón te late más, estoy sintiéndote
Si no puedes dormir, es porque estoy soñándote
Sólo sé, mi amor, que entre tú why yo
Hay algo más que una simple historia de amor
El mar ha sido cómplice de esta fuerte pasión
La luna con su luz protegerá a este gran amor
Sabes, corazón, que en mí
Siempre encontrarás quien te ame
Sin pensar en lo que pueda pasar

Te amo en libertad why no puedo escapar
A esta pasión que mata why me hare respirar
Te amo en libertad why nunca cambiará
El que a tu lado, amor, yo quiera delirar
Dónde estés, amor, ahí estaré

Mi vida sigue why no puedo dejar de ser feliz
Tú vuelas cada vez más alto, tan lejos de mí
Nunca sé, mi amor, cuando te vuelva a ver

Why alguien más, con tu cuerpo, me hará el amor",Amor en Libertad,2003

And when I close my eyes
I feel those butterflies
I need your smile, all the time
You light my darkest night
When you are by my side
I need your love, all the time

Vers 1:
Hope you are always mine
I never would turn back the time
You are my destiny
My heart is in your hands
I pray to God above
Please never stop this perfect love
You are the best of me
Your love can set me free

Vers 2:
Your heart is like my home
You never walk this road alone
I'll never let you down
The best is yet to come
Love changes everything
With you I'm living in a dream
And when you're far away
Your love will make my day

I would never let you go
As long as feelings glow
I wouldn't change a thing on you
You are always in my heart
We'll never be apart
Don't let the sun go down on me

Hieres primero, logras que te quiera

Patricia Neway,"She climbs a tree and scrapes her knee
Her dress has got a tear
She waltzes on her way to Mass
And whistles on the stair
And underneath her wimple
She has curlers in her hair
I even heard her singing in the abbey

She's always late for chapel
But her penitence is real
She's always late for everything
Except for every meal

But I very firmly feel
Maria's not an asset to the abbey

How do you catch a cloud and pin it down?

Many a thing she ought to understand
But how do you make her stay
And listen to all you say
How do you keep a wave upon the sand

Oh, how do you solve a problem like Maria?
How do you hold a moonbeam in your hand?

When I'm with her I'm confused
Out of focus and bemused
And I never know exactly where I am
Unpredictable as weather
She's as flighty as a feather
She's a darling! She's a demon! She's a lamb!

She'd out pester any pest
Drive a hornet from its nest
She could throw a whirling dervish out of whirl
She is gentle! She is wild!
She's a riddle! She's a child!
She's a headache! She's an angel!
She's a girl!

Told me you were through with me

Patricia O'Callaghan,"Before Lord God made the sea and the land
He held all the stars in the palm of his hand
And they ran through his fingers like grains of sand
And one little star fell alone

Then the Lord God hunted through the wide night air 
For the little dark star on the wind down there 
And he stated and promised he'd take special care 
So it wouldn't get lost again

Now a man don't mind if the stars grow dim 
And the clouds blow over and darken him
So long as the Lord God's watching over them
Keeping track of how it all goes on

But I've been walking all the night and the day
Till my eyes get weary and my head turns gray
And sometimes it seems maybe God's gone away
And we're lost out here in the stars

Little stars, big stars, blowing through the night
And we're lost out here in the stars
Little stars, big stars, blowing through the night
And we're lost out here in the stars",Lost in the Stars,2004
Patricia Petibon,"Tears falling from the sky
And how can we not know the reason why?
It took us all two thousand years of work and strife
Bringing the day we made God cry.

They taught us all from birth
There’s only one who rules upon this earth.
We know his name! We even claim we know his face.
Blue eyes or black.......... his sorrow’s our disgrace.

CHORUS:
So we lay our roads and slay the trees.
To possess more than our enemies.
And our means can justify the end. We’ll
Trample on a friend. So disrespectfully. 
And with all this anger in our hearts
We rebel and swear God plays a part.
So we kill and pray to make amends. The 
Story never ends and flags will burn again.

Tears falling from the sky.
Under the dust the city ceased to shine
And all the children search within their mother’s eyes.........
“ How could it be that we have made God cry?”

CHORUS:
So we lay our roads and slay the trees.
To possess more than our enemies.
And our means can justify the end. We’ll
Trample on a friend. So disrespectfully.
And we send our hatred from above
In the name of one who taught to love.
We proclaim we’re worthy of this place. The
Chosen human race could
Never justify.................the day we made God cry.",The Day We Made God Cry,2006

I want another evening with her charms

Patricia Shaw,"When I was young I spoke like a child, and I saw with a child's eyes
And an open door was to a girl like the stars are to the sky
It's funny how the world lives up to all your expectations
With adventures for the stout of heart, and the lure of the open spaces

There's 2 lanes running down this road, whichever side you're on
Accounts for where you want to go, or what you're running from
Back when darkness overtook me on a blind man's curve

I relied upon the moon, I relied upon the moon
I relied upon the moon and Saint Christopher
Now I've paid my dues cuz I have owed them, but I've paid a price sometimes
For being such a stubborn woman in such stubborn times

Now I've paid my dues cuz I have owed them, but I've paid a price sometimes
For being such a stubborn woman in such stubborn times
Now I have run from the arms of lovers, I've run from the eyes of friends
I have run from the hands of kindness, I've run just because I can

But now I'm grown and I speak like a woman and I see with a woman's eyes
And an open door is to me now like the saddest of goodbyes
It's too late for turning back, I pray for the heart and the nerve

And I rely upon the moon, I rely upon the moon
I rely upon the moon and Saint Christopher

I rely upon the moon, I rely upon the moon
I rely upon the moon and Saint Christopher

Seguire con toda mi voluntad.

No se si habrá tiempo para descansar

When he sold the car
That took him away and back

But he's got great footage
Which he's cut together

To screen tonight

It's Mimi, I can't get her up the stairs

No, she was huddled in the park in the dark

Patrick,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,

Lose their taste for kissing?

I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

Patrick Bruel,"Can you hear the drums Fernando?
I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me

Les souvenirs sont là pour m'étouffer
De larmes, de fleurs, de baisers
Oui je revois les beaux matins d'avril

Nous vivions sous les toits tout en haut de la ville

Vous qui passez sans me voir
Vous, qui passez sans même me dire bonsoir
Donnez-moi un peu d'espoir ce soir
J'ai tant de peine
Vous, dont je guette un regard
Pour quelle raison, ce soir passez-vous sans me voir
Un mot, je vais le dire, ""je vous aime""

C'est jeune et c'est triste aussi

Salut ca va ? Toi, ca va ? Moi, ca va.
Bref, tout l' monde va, quoi.

Et j' suis d' moins en moins à l'aise.
Lola, pourquoi, pourquoi t'es pas là ?
Ça fait trois heures qu' j' suis là, planté.
C'est pas qu' j' m'ennuie, mais j' vais m' tirer.

On fait semblant d' se parler.
Chacun s' donne une apparence
Et toi tu tournes dans la danse.
Lola ! Ah pardon, excusez-moi.
J'ai vraiment cru qu' c'était Lola.
Je m' suis trompé, encore une fois.

Tu allumes ton ordi, tu attends

Cette fois encore, c'est pas ta fête
Tu lis quand même, tu baisses la tête
Il faudra bien que ça s'arrête
Ces mots jetés, un peu pour voir
Derrière un clavier, va savoir
Quel enfant sage prend le pouvoir
Seul dans sa chambre, un gamin rit
Pour faire rire les autres avec lui
Et ça tombe sur toi aujourd'hui
Sèche tes larmes, regarde-moi
J'ai encore plus mal que toi quand tes yeux me demandent 'Pourquoi?'
On répète ce que l'on entend
On cherche sa place dans le vent
Mais ce ne sont que des maux, d'enfants

Pour un garçon qui aime un garçon
Pour une petite phrase à la con

Il n'y a pas que les ballons qui volent
Il n'y a pas que des jeux drôles
Qui est minable, qui est cador

Mais les choses murmurent si nous savons entendre 

Le marteau se leva, dans la salle des ventes 
Une fois, puis deux fois, alors, dans le silence 
Elle cria: ""je prends, je rachète tout ça 
Ce que vous vendez là, c'est mon passé à moi""

C'était trop tard, déjà, dans la salle des ventes
Le marteau retomba sur sa voix suppliante 
Tout se passe si vite, à la salle des ventes
Qu'on ne l'entendit pas

Près des paniers d'osier, dans la salle des ventes 
Une femme pleurait ses folles années trente 
Et revoyait soudain défiler son passé 
Défiler son passé, défiler son passé 

Car venait de surgir, du fond de sa mémoire 
Du fond de sa mémoire, un visage oublié 
Une image chérie, du fond de sa mémoire 
Son seul amour de femme, son seul amour de femme 

Hagarde, elle sortit de la salle des ventes 
Froissant quelques billets, dedans ses main tremblantes 
Froissant quelques billets, du bout de ses doigts nus 
Quelques billets froissés, pour un passé perdu 

Hagarde, elle sortit de la salle des ventes 
Je la vis s'éloigner, courbée et déchirante 
De son amours d'antan, rien ne lui restait plus 
Pas même ce souvenir, aujourd'hui disparu",Drouot,2015
Patrick Bruel,"Du plus loin, que me revienne
L´ombre de mes amours anciennes
Du plus loin, du premier rendez-vous
Du temps des premières peines
Lors, j´avais quinze ans, à peine
Cœur tout blanc, et griffes aux genoux
Que ce furent, j´étais précoce
De tendres amours de gosse
Ou les morsures d´un amour fou
Du plus loin qu´il m´en souvienne
Si depuis, j´ai dit ""je t´aime""
Ma plus belle histoire d´amour, c´est vous

C´est vrai, je ne fus pas sage
Et j´ai tourné bien des pages
Sans les lire, blanches, et puis rien dessus
C´est vrai, je ne fus pas sage
Et mes guerrières de passage
A peine vues, déjà disparues
Mais à travers leur visage
C´était déjà votre image
C´était vous déjà et le cœur nu
Je refaisais mes bagages
Et poursuivais mon mirage
Ma plus belle histoire d´amour, c´est vous

Sur la longue route
Qui menait vers vous
Sur la longue route j´allais le cœur fou
Le vent de décembre
Me gelait au cou
Qu´importait décembre
Si c´était pour vous?

Elle fut longue la route
Mais je l´ai faite, la route
Celle-là, qui menait jusqu'à vous
Et je ne suis pas parjure
Si ce soir, je vous jure
Que, pour vous, je l´eus faite à genoux
Il en eut fallu bien d´autres
Que quelques mauvais apôtres
Que l´hiver ou la neige à mon cou
Pour que je perde patience
Et j´ai calmé ma violence
Ma plus belle histoire d´amour, c´est vous

Mais tant d'hivers et d'automnes 
De nuits, de jours, et personne
Vous n´étiez jamais au rendez-vous
Et de vous, perdant courage
Soudain, me prenait la rage
Mon Dieu, que j´avais besoin de vous
Que le Diable vous emporte
D´autres m´ont ouvert la porte
Heureux, je m´en allais loin de vous
Oui, je vous fus infidèle
Mais vous revenais quand même
Ma plus belle histoire d´amour, c´est vous

J´ai pleuré mes larmes
Mais qu´il me fut doux
Oh, qu´il me fut doux ce premier sourire de vous
Et pour une larme
Qui venait de vous
J´ai pleuré d´amour
Vous souvenez-vous? 

Ce fut, un soir, en septembre
Vous étiez venue m´attendre
Ici-même, vous en souvenez-vous? 
À vous regarder sourire
À vous aimer, sans rien dire
C´est là que j´ai compris, tout à coup
J´avais fini mon voyage
Et j´ai posé mes bagages
Vous étiez venue au rendez-vous
Qu´importe ce qu´on peut en dire
Je tenais à vous le dire
Ce soir je vous remercie de vous
Qu´importe ce qu´on peut en dire
Je suis venu pour vous dire

Patrick Bruel,"J'ai eu tort, je suis revenu
Dans cette ville loin perdue 
Ou j'avais passé mon enfance
J'ai eu tort, j'ai voulu revoir 
Le coteau ou glissait le soir 
Bleus et gris, ombres de silence
Et je retrouvais comme avant
Longtemps après
Le coteau, l'arbre se dressant
Comme au passé
J'ai marché, les tempes brûlantes
Croyant étouffer sous mes pas
Les voix du passé qui nous hantent 
Et reviennent sonner le glas
Et je me suis couché sous l'arbre 
Et c’étaient les mêmes odeurs
Et j'ai laissé couler mes pleurs
Mes pleurs
J'ai mis mon dos nu à l’écorce
L'arbre m'a redonné des forces 
Tout comme au temps de mon enfance
Et longtemps j'ai fermé les yeux
Je crois que j'ai prié un peu
Je retrouvais mon innocence
Avant que le soir ne se pose
J'ai voulu voir 
La maison fleurie sous les roses
J'ai voulu voir 
Le jardin où nos cris d'enfants
Jaillissaient comme source claire
Jean-claude, et Régine, et puis Jean
Tout redevenait comme hier
Le parfum lourd des sauges rouges
Les dahlias fauves dans l’allée
Le puit, tout, j'ai tout retrouvé

Hélas 
La guerre nous avait jeté là
D'autres furent moins heureux, je crois
Au temps joli de leur enfance
La guerre nous avait jetés là
Nous vivions comme hors-la-loi
Et j'aimais cela, quand j'y pense 
Ou mes printemps, ou mes soleils
Ou mes folles années perdues
Ou mes quinze ans, ou mes merveilles
Que j'ai mal d’être revenu
Ou les noix fraîches de septembre 
Et l'odeur des mûres écrasées
C'est fou, tout, j'ai tout retrouvé
Hélas 
Il ne faut jamais revenir 
Aux temps cachés des souvenirs 
Du temps béni de son enfance
Car parmi tous les souvenirs 
Ceux de l'enfance sont les pires
Ceux de l'enfance nous déchirent
Oh ma très chérie, oh ma mère
Où êtes-vous donc aujourd'hui? 
Vous dormez au chaud de la terre
Et moi je suis venu ici 
Pour y retrouver votre rire
Vos colères et votre jeunesse
Mais je suis seule avec ma détresse
Hélas 
Pourquoi suis-je donc revenue 
Et seule au détour de ces rues?

Où mon passé me crucifie?

C'est parce qu'à la nuit

Tu souris, je souris
C'est parce qu'ici ou là

C'est toujours mon pays
C'est parce que je t'aime 
Que je préfère m'en aller 
Car il faut savoir se quitter
Avant que ne meure le temps d'aimer

C'est parce que j'ai peur de voir s'endeuiller 
Les minutes, les heures, les secondes passées
C'est parce que je sais qu'il faut un presque rien 
Pour défaire une nuit et se perdre au matin

Je ne laisserai pas pencher sur notre lit 
Ni l'ombre d'un regret, ni l'ombre de l'ennui
Je ne laisserai pas mourir au fil des jours

Comme deux loups blessés, que sont-ils maintenant? 

Ca, je ne veux pas

J'aimerais bien que tu comprennes 
Que j'ai choisi l'absence comme dernière chance 
Notre ciel devenait si lourd 
Si je t'écris ce soir de Vienne 
Oh, que c'est beau l'automne à Vienne 
C'est que sans réfléchir, j'ai préféré partir 
Et je suis à Vienne sans toi 
Je marche, je rêve dans Vienne 
Sur trois temps de valse lointaine 
Il semble que les ombres tournent et se confondent 
Qu'ils étaient beaux, les soirs de Vienne

Non, je ne veux pas que tu viennes

Et la nuit par-dessus les toits

Cela va faire une semaine 
Déjà que je vis seul à Vienne 
C'est curieux le hasard, j'ai croisé l'autre soir 
Nos amis de Lountatchimo 
Cela va faire une semaine

Ils étaient de passage à Vienne
Ils n'ont rien demandé, mais se sont étonnés
De me voir à Vienne sans toi

Moi, moi 
Je me promène 
Je suis bien 
Je suis bien 

Et puis de semaine en semaine 
Voilà que je vis seule à Vienne 
Tes lettres se font rares, peut-être qu'autre part 
Tu as trouvé l'oubli de moi 
Je lis, j'écris mais quand même 
Qu'il est long l'automne à Vienne 
Dans ce lit à deux places où la nuit je me glace 
Tout à coup j'ai le mal de toi 
Que c'est long Vienne 
Que c'est loin Vienne

Chérie, c'est qu'il faut que tu viennes 
J'étais parti, pardonne-moi

Et toi de Paris jusqu'à Vienne 
Au bout d'une invisible chaîne 
Tu me guettais je pense, jouant l'indifférence 
Et tu m'as gardé malgré moi 

Il est minuit ce soir à Vienne

As I was sitting with my glass and spoon
A small bird sat on an ivy bunch
And the song he sang was ""The Jug Of Punch""

Than to sit him down by a snug turf fire?
Upon his knee a pretty wench
And on the table a jug of punch

Let the doctors come with all their art
They'll make no impression upon my heart
Even the cripple forgets his hunch
When he's snuggled 'side a jug of punch

Patrick Davis,"Downtown dances past my window
As the full moon hits my eye
Past the factory and over the railroad tracks
I'm doing sixty in a forty five

All my coming and going
Hasn't gotten me anywhere
I thought I was moving
But I'm still here

(In this)
Nowhere town, this nowhere town
Where people dream of the stars
But they wake up on the ground

I ain't got no excuses
I ain't got no alibis
You know I sure wish I did
'Cause it'd be so much easier to lie

I was gonna be somebody
I had pockets full of plans
But somebody somewhere must of stole them
'Cause here I am

(In this)
Nowhere town, this nowhere town
Where people dream of the stars
But they wake up on the ground

They talk of leavin' while they hang around
This place is just a nowhere town

Someday things will change
Just as soon as that day comes
I'm gonna set sail out on the highway
And I'm gonna run from this

Where people dream of the stars
But they wake up on the ground

They talk of leavin' while they hang around

Quand elle danse et qu'elle met son corps à jour
Tel un oiseau qui étend ses ailes pour s'envoler

J'ai posé mes yeux sous sa robe de gitane
À quoi me sert encore de prier Notre-Dame

Est-ce le diable qui s'est incarné en elle
Pour détourner mes yeux du Dieu éternel
Qui a mis dans mon être ce désir charnel
Pour m'empêcher de regarder vers le Ciel

Elle porte en elle le péché originel
La désirer fait-il de moi un criminel
Celle qu'on prenait pour une fille de joie une fille de rien
Semble soudain porter la croix du genre humain

Ô laisse-moi rien qu'une fois
Pousser la porte du jardin d'Esmeralda

Malgré ses grands yeux noirs qui vous ensorcellent
La demoiselle serait-elle encore pucelle
Quand ses mouvements me font voir monts et merveilles
Sous son jupon aux couleurs de l'arc-en-ciel

Ma dulcinée laissez-moi vous être infidèle
Avant de vous avoir menée jusqu'à l'autel
Quel est l'homme qui détournerait son regard d'elle
Sous peine d'être changé en statue de sel

Patrick Fiori,"Belle
C'est un mot qu'on dirait inventé pour elle
Quand elle danse et qu'elle met son corps à jour
Tel un oiseau qui étend ses ailes pour s'envoler
Alors je sens l'enfer s'ouvrir sous mes pieds

J'ai posé mes yeux sous sa robe de gitane
À quoi me sert encore de prier Notre-Dame
Quel est celui qui lui jettera la première pierre
Celui-là ne mérite pas d'être sur terre

Ô Lucifer!
Ô laisse-moi rien qu'une fois
Glisser mes doigts dans les cheveux d'Esmeralda

Belle
Est-ce le diable qui s'est incarné en elle
Pour détourner mes yeux du Dieu éternel
Qui a mis dans mon être ce désir charnel
Pour m'empêcher de regarder vers le Ciel

Elle porte en elle le péché originel
La désirer fait-il de moi un criminel
Celle qu'on prenait pour une fille de joie une fille de rien
Semble soudain porter la croix du genre humain

Ô Notre-Dame!
Ô laisse-moi rien qu'une fois
Pousser la porte du jardin d'Esmeralda

Belle
Malgré ses grands yeux noirs qui vous ensorcellent
La demoiselle serait-elle encore pucelle
Quand ses mouvements me font voir monts et merveilles
Sous son jupon aux couleurs de l'arc-en-ciel

Ma dulcinée laissez-moi vous être infidèle
Avant de vous avoir menée jusqu'à l'autel
Quel est l'homme qui détournerait son regard d'elle
Sous peine d'être changé en statue de sel

Ô Fleur-de-Lys!
Je ne suis pas homme de foi
J'irai cueillir la fleur d'amour d'Esmeralda

J'ai posé mes yeux sous sa robe de gitane
À quoi me sert encore de prier Notre-Dame
Quel est celui qui lui jettera la première pierre
Celui-là ne mérite pas d'être sur terre

Ô Lucifer!
Ô laisse moi rien qu'une fois

Patrick Fiori,"Je me souviens de ces matins d'hiver
Dans la nuit sombre et glacée
Quand je marchais à côté de mon frère
Sur le chemin des écoliers
Quand nos membres, encore tout engourdis
De sommeil, grelottaient sous les assauts du vent
Nous nous battions à grands coups de boules de neige
En riant

Nous arrivions dans la salle de classe
Où le maître nous séparait
Nous retrouvions chaque jour notre place
Et l'on ne pouvait plus se parler
Puis bercés par les vagues d'une douce chaleur
Que nous prodiguait le vieux poêle
Nos esprits s'évadaient pour se rejoindre ailleurs
Vers des plages

Où il fait toujours beau, où tous les jours sont chauds
Où l'on passe sa vie à jouer
Sans songer à l'école, en pleine liberté,
Pour rêver

Où il fait toujours beau, où tous les jours sont chauds
Où l'on passe sa vie à jouer
Sans songer à l'école, en pleine liberté,
Pour rêver

Je me souviens de l'odeur fade et chaude
De notre classe calfeutrée
Des premières lueurs pâles de l'aube
A travers les vitres givrées
Je revois les yeux tendres et les visages tristes
Qui autour de moi écoutaient
Et pendant les leçons dans mon coin je rêvais
A des îles

Où il fait toujours beau, où tous les jours sont chauds
Où l'on passe sa vie à jouer
Sans songer à l'école, en pleine liberté,
Pour rêver

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

I'm so forlorn. Life's just a thorn
My heart is torn. Why was I born?

That's why I seem to have more than my share,

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,

Patrick Lachman,"From memories of 68 when the wizard shook the world
Metal came from foundries where the midlands sound unfurled
The bullring was a lonely place of concrete towers and steel
The coal mines and the industries were all I had to fell.

Something inside took hold of me, I really didn't know
But overtime it came to be, I knew which way to go
I drove around in search of what would make this all come true
From jazz and electricity and good old southern blues

Hell, we're born to raise some hell
Hell, we're gonna raise some hell

In Henry's and in mother's where I'd go to bang my head
The feeling took a hold of me with every word I said
The voice was born and came alive from all I saw and heard
And now I knew my destiny, I had to spread the word.

I took the scream around the world
From London to L.A.
Unleashed in downtown Tokyo
Blew Godzilla away

Then on the sound and fury went from Sydney to Brazil
It sent the Russians crazy cause they never get their fill.

Of Hell, we're born to raise some hell
Hell, we're gonna raise some hell
Hell, we're born to raise some hell
Hell, we're gonna raise some hell

The stage and the lights and the amps are ablaze watch them burn
From all this insanity the Metal God's will return.

Shock waves attack relentlessly, intimidating force
So many bands surrounding you with evil from our source
It screams across the universe and slams you to the floor
This blitzkrieg psycho mania is coming on full roar
The world's a stage that's waiting for its bad ass to get kicked
And we're all on the road to hell and that's route 666

Cause I'm the one you love to hate.

So come on get a load of this
Something you can't afford to miss
You're just a vulture in my veins.

Your nails won't crucify me
Got money, but you can't see
Your only future is your past.

I can break you
I can raise you
Bring you to your knees
Cause I'm the one you love to hate.

You can't fool me
You can't rule me
You only want to hang around
Cause I'm the one you love to hate.

Patrick Lachman,"I'm digging deep inside my soul
To bring myself out of this God-damned hole
I rid the demons from my heart
And found the truth was with me from the start

Holy angel lift me from this burning hell 
Resurrection make me whole
Son of Judas bring the saints to my revenge 
Resurrection bring me home

I walked alone into a Fight
No longer standing in satanic light
I tried to look too far ahead
And saw the road go to my past instead

Holy angel lift me from this burning hell 
Resurrection make me whole
Son of Judas bring the saints to my revenge 
Resurrection bring me home

There is no bastard left to overcome

Was right in front of me on paths I've crossed",Resurrection,2000

I'm older so I'm wise
I have been crucified
With words personified

Here I am now, I'm your Savior
There can be only one
I'm the master, past and future
Now the end has begun

I've always stood alone
Your time got overgrown

After dreams left in the storm
What I am is all
That really matters now
That lies are gone -
That lies are gone,
All the lies are gone,
The lies are gone.

Tempting fate and losing
Friends along the way I loved
No regrets
I'm standing
With a needle in my heart -
Needle in my heart,
Needle in my heart,
Needle in my heart.

You'll never know
My life means everything
Still I scream because
There's nothing left to do until the end.

The world goes on
With all that I've become
And still I scream inside
For all the pain I've taken hasn't changed.

Nothing's changed at all
The truth is like a chain
Heaven's calling me
The place that I belong
Killing pain -
Killing pain.

Close my eyes a million faces
Get inside my mind.
Take a breath and fill my troubled
Soul with all mankind.
Killing pain -
Killing pain,
I'm killing pain,
Killing pain.

The world goes on
With all that I've become.
And still I scream inside
For all the pain I've taken hasn't changed...

The man in black
I'm coming back to spew my evil hate.
My crown of horns and bloody thorns
I'll dig up what you fear.

I am the shape that's in your room that watches over you.
I am the needle in your heart - your disillusioned God.

I am God, I am fate, I am all the sins you make, yeah - hate.
I am black, I am white, I am the blood upon the knife, yeah - hate.

Since time began I made a vow to drag you underground;
To steal your soul of purity and watch you waste away.

I am pure, I am right, I'm the God that makes you fight, yeah - hate.
I am life, I am death, I will steal your final breath, yeah - hate.

I prey upon your broken dreams your weakness gives me strength.
I'm laughing at your silent screams I'll crush you with my hate.

You take it all
And face the fear that's here
Until the Silence Screams
it leaves you with no choice to carry on.

You'll never fall
When all is said and done
The only Scream is here
The journey never ends - it's just begun...

The lies that never learned
The needles in my heart
And things will never change
So everytime I scream I'm killing pain.",Silent Screams,2000

Don't deceive me into temptation

You gave so much to me you left me feeling numb
So full of emptiness from stealing what you've done

Patrick Lamb,"Looking back on when I
Was a little nappy headed boy
Then my only worry
Was for Christmas what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes
Would not get a thing
We were happy with the
Joy the day would bring
Sneaking out the back door
To hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door
With ""Boy thought I told you not to go outside""
Trying your best to bring the water to your eyes
Thinking it might stop her from whooping your behind

I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
'Cause I love them so

Brother says he's telling
About you playing doctor with that girl
Just don't tell I'll give you
Anything you want in this whole wide world
Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy after church is through
Smoking cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall (""You nasty boy."")
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall
You grow up and learn that kind of thing isn't right
But while you were doing it-it sure felt out to sight

Why did those days ever have to go

Sometimes it gets so hard to hide it well
I was not ready for the fall
Too blind to see the writing on the wall

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell
The secret I have learned, 'till then
It will burn inside of me

I know where beauty lives
I've seen it once, I know the warm she gives
The light that you could never see
It shines inside, you can't take that from me

Hope I live to tell
The secret I have learned, 'till then

The truth is never far behind
You kept it hidden well
If I live to tell
The secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again

If I ran away, I'd never have the strength
To go very far
How would they hear the beating of my heart
Will it grow cold
The secret that I hide, will I grow old
How will they hear
When will they learn
How will they know

Hay quien ahora piensa 
Que se puede ver más allá. 
Pero en un instante 
La sombra del gigante 
Oscurece la ciudad. 

Y se habla de él cada día 
Y se encuentra por cualquier lugar, 
Es el dueño absoluto que guía 
Cada onda del cielo o del mar y 
En cada esquina y por todas partes 
Está cambiando la realidad, 
Y por esto se vuelve importante 
El quedarnos afuera, el quedarnos ya 
Con los brazos hacia el cielo, 
Muy arriba el corazón.

Sobre sus alas fuertes 
El último de los sueños que yo haré, 
Que yo haré. 

En este aire denso 
Hay quien siempre busca 
Un respiro más allá. 

Y si cierran todas las puertas 
Como huir una voz lo sabrá, 
Deja todas las luces abiertas 
Que si alguien se pierde así volverá. 

Con los brazos hacia el cielo, 
Muy arriba el corazón; 
No estaré tan solo yo 
Ni tampoco sólo tú. 

Como nosotros ya verás

Se nos parecen siempre más,

And don't want a playa that can kiss all over town.

I can stand a man who thinks he looks better than me,
I'm looking for a brother who likes to have fun,
A fly gentlemen that who knows how to please.

Last thing I need is a man who's soft, 
He better get it on up, and break me off,
Some body fly high, who's 6'5, 
who's shy that's the kind of man I need because I'm free.

towards salvation

Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient
melodies

Frightened of this thing that I've become

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

And make you mine before it's much too late

I'll give you something that can take you so far

Get into this thing that can take us so far
Let's get it on

Every little thing within your face
Tells me all about your soul and grace
But every little thing could bring me down
If I couldn't make you stick around

Whatever it will take to hold you
I'm gonna give it all to
Breakthrough to you

There was no such thing, I've seen in my life
'Cause nothing else got so
Close to my heart and it makes me feel right
That's everything I know

To make you mine before it's much too late

Patrick O'Hagan,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1981
Patrick O'Hagan,"There's a spot in my heart,
Which no colleen may own.
There's a depth in my soul,
Never sounded or known;

There's a place in my mem'ry,
My life, that you fill,
No other can take it,
No one ever will.

[Chorus]
Sure, I love the dear silver
That shines in your hair,
And the brow that's all furrowed,
And wrinkled with care.
I kiss the dear fingers,
So toil-worn for me,
Oh, God bless you and keep you,
Mother Machree.

Ev'ry sorrow or care
In the dear days gone by,
Was made bright by the light
Of the smile in your eye,

Like a candle that's set
In the window at night,
Your fond love has cheered me
And guided me right.

I was happy as a lark
But now I go for walks

I have a seat on the same old bench
To watch the children play, huh
You know tomorrow is their future
But for me just another day
They all gather 'round me, huh

I keep sayin' she'll be back
But today again I've lied

Oh, I see her face everywhere I go
On the street and even at the picture show
Have you seen her
Tell me have you seen her
Oh, I hear her voice as the cold winds blow
In the sweet music on my radio
Have you seen her
Tell me have you seen her

Patrick Sky,"On one cloudless morning I stood on the mountain,
Just watching the smoke from below,
It was coming from a tall, slim smokestack
Way down on the Southern railroad.

It was 97, the fastest train
Ever ran the Southern line,
All the freight trains and passengers take the side for 97,
For she's bound to be at stations on time.

They gave him his orders at Monroe, Virginia,
Saying, ""Stevie, you're way behind time.
This is not 38, but it's Old 97,
You must put her into Spencer on time.""

He looked 'round and said to his black greasy fireman,
""Just shovel in a little more coal,
And when I cross that old White Oak Mountain
You can just watch Old 97 roll.""

It's a mighty rough road from Lynchburg to Danville,
And the lie was a three-mile grade,
It was on that grade that he lost his air brakes,
And you see what a jump that she made.
He was going down the grade making 90 miles an hour,
When his whistle began to scream,
He was found in that wreck with his hand on the throttle,
He was scalded to death by the steam.

Did she ever pull in? No, she never pulled in,
And at 1:45 he was due,
For hours and hours has the switchman been waiting
For that fast mail that never pulled through.
Did she ever pull in? No, she never pulled in,
And that poor boy must be dead.
Oh, yonder he lays on the railroad track
With the cart wheels over his head.

97, she was the fastest train
That the South had ever seen,
But she run so fast on that Sunday morning
That the death score was numbered 14.

Now, ladies, you must take warning,
From this time now and on.
Never speak harsh words to your true loving husband.
He may leave you and never return.

Covered o'er with Nixon's shit
While our sweat is turning Agnew's filthy mill
And the people, as they pass
They jam Melvin up our ass
Well I guess we've had our god damn fucking fill

Fight, fight, fight for liberation
Break, break, break the social scheme
We will drag the bastards down
And we'll grind 'em in the ground
And replace them with a working class regime

Then we'll send a firing squad
After Cardinal Spellman's god
MacNamara will be the next in line
Then we'll pump some LSD

Into Jackie Kennedy
And we'll make her fuck the workers overtime

Then we'll get a bloody rope
And we'll hang the fuckin' pope
And we'll burn the Sistine Chapel to the ground
Then we'll turn our tommy-guns
On the screaming, ravished nuns
And the peoples' voice will be the only sound

CHORUS:
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian 
Nor the Marine that went to war

Gather round me people there's a story I would tell
About a brave young Indian you should remember well
From the land of the Pima Indian 
A proud and noble band
Who farmed the Phoenix valley in Arizona land

Down the ditches for a thousand years 
The water grew Ira's peoples' crops
'Till the white man stole the water rights 
And the sparklin' water stopped

Now Ira's folks were hungry 
And their land grew crops of weeds
When war came, Ira volunteered 
And forgot the white man's greed

CHORUS:
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian 
Nor the Marine that went to war


There they battled up Iwo Jima's hill, 
Two hundred and fifty men
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down again

And when the fight was over 
And when Old Glory raised
Among the men who held it high 
Was the Indian, Ira Hayes

CHORUS:
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian 
Nor the Marine that went to war

Ira returned a hero 
Celebrated through the land
He was wined and speeched and honored; Everybody shook his hand

But he was just a Pima Indian
No water, no crops, no chance
At home nobody cared what Ira'd done 
And when did the Indians dance

CHORUS:
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian 
Nor the Marine that went to war

Then Ira started drinkin' hard;
Jail was often his home
They'd let him raise the flag and lower it
like you'd throw a dog a bone!

He died drunk one mornin' 
Alone in the land he fought to save
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch 
Was a grave for Ira Hayes

CHORUS:
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian 
Nor the Marine that went to war

Yeah, call him drunken Ira Hayes 
But his land is just as dry
And his ghost is lyin' thirsty 
In the ditch where Ira died

From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,2007

Christmas was saved, though there wasn't much time.
But after that night, things were never the same,
Each holiday now knew the other one's name.

And though that one Christmas things got out of hand,
I'm still rather fond of that skeleton man.

So, many years later I thought I'd drop in,
And there was old Jack still looking quite thin,
With four or five skeleton children at hand
Playing strange little tunes in their xylophone band.

And I asked old Jack, ""Do you remember the night
When the sky was so dark and the moon shone so bright?
When a million small children pretending to sleep
Nearly didn't have Christmas at all, so to speak?
And would, if you could, turn that mighty clock back,
To that long, fateful night. Now, think carefully, Jack.
Would you do the whole thing all over again,
Knowing what you know now, knowing what you knew then?""

And he smiled, like the old pumpkin king that I knew,
Then turned and asked softly of me, ""Wouldn't you?""",Closing,2008

Longer now than it seems
In a place that perhaps
You've seen in your dreams

Began with the holiday worlds of old
Now, you've probably wondered
Where holidays come from.
If you haven't I'd say
It's time you begun.
For the holidays are the result of much fuss
And hard work from the worlds that create them us

Making one unique holiday
Especially for you

Patrick Street," I was born on the holy ground
A running child in fields of clover
I was living in the grandeur
Of my father's land
mmm...

By the side of the swirling sea
I spent the days of childish wonder
And the rocks I held in my young hands
I never felt them slip away

Well the sun shone bright upon the waves
And the wind blew high as I was leaving
And I sailed so far away
Looking for adventure
mmm...

But I would not stay where the city streets
proclaimed so loudly man's endeavours
Though music is a pretty thing
in fine company
And the wilderness took my breath away
I felt I had to find my way
Where no-one ever goes
mmm...

It was in the south that my new home lay
With a dark eyed boy and wild horses
With humming birds and roses there 
in old Mexico

There the winds of change they blew so far
Of liberty and revolution
And it seemed that each man heard in his breast
the drumming of a nation

There he got his parole.
After four long years on a man killing charge, 
Tom Joad come a-walkin' down the road.

Tom Joad, he met a truck driving man; 
There he caught him a ride.
He said, I just got loose from McAlester Pen
On a charge called homicide, 

That truck rolled away in a cloud of dust; 
Tommy turned his face toward home.
He met Preacher Casey, and they had a little drink, 
But they found that his family they were gone, 
He found that his family they was gone.

He found his mother's old fashion shoe, 
Found his daddy's hat.
And he found little Muley and Muley said, 
They've been tractored out by the cats, 

Tom Joad walked down to the neighbor's farm, 
He found his family.
They took Preacher Casey and loaded in a car, 
And his mother said, We've got to get away.

Oh the twelve other Joads made a very heavy load
But Grandfather Joad did cry
And He picked up a hand full of in his hand
Said I'm staying with the farm till I die

They stood on a mountain and they looked to the west, 
And it looked like the promised land.
That bright green valley with a river running through, 
There was work for every single hand, they thought, 
There was work for every single hand.

The Joads rolled away to the jungle camp, 
There they cooked a stew.
And the hungry little kids of the jungle camp
Said: ""We'd like to have some, too.""
Said: ""We'd like to have some, too.""

Now a deputy sheriff fired loose at a man, 
Shot a woman in the back.
Before he could take his aim again, 

Preacher Casey dropped him in his track, poor boy, 
Preacher Casey dropped him in his track.

They handcuffed Casey and they took him in jail; 
And then he got away.
And he met Tom Joad on the old river bridge, 
And these few words he did say, poor boy, 
These few words he did say.

""I preached for the Lord a mighty long time, 
Preached about the rich and the poor.
Us workin' folkses, all get together, 
'Cause we ain't got a chance anymore.
We ain't got a chance anymore.""

Now, the deputies come, and Tom and Casey run
To the bridge where the water run down.
But the vigilante thugs hit Casey with a club, 
They laid Preacher Casey on the ground, poor Casey, 
They laid Preacher Casey on the ground.

Tom Joad, he grabbed that deputy's club, 
Hit him over the head.
Tom Joad took flight in the dark rainy night, 
And a deputy and a preacher lying dead, two men, 
A deputy and a preacher lying dead.

Tom run back where his mother was asleep; 
He woke her up out of bed.
An' he kissed goodbye to the mother that he loved, 
Said what Preacher Casey said, Tom Joad, 
He said what Preacher Casey said.

""Everybody might be just one big soul, 
Well it looks that a-way to me.
Everywhere that you look, in the day or night, 
That's where I'm a-gonna be, Ma, 
That's where I'm a-gonna be.

There was never much question about what he might do
By the age of thirteen he had laid down his pen
And become a coal-miner and a prince among men.

My goal as a young lad from a bright early age
Was to follow my hero down in that cage
Fairy lights and Pit Ponies were the stuff of my dreams
Never  thinking how hard my dad worked at the seam

chorus:
Only a miner killed under the ground
Only a miner and one more is found
Killed by accident no one can tell
Your mining's all over, poor miner, farewell.

Dad worked like a Trojan his money to save
I'm afraid that he worked himself into his grave
And my schooling was paid at the cost of his lungs
Dad was an old man at the age of forty-one.

I never will forget how his face lit with pride
When I got my diploma, he was there by my side
And I try to remember him as he was then
A rare moment of joy for a prince among men.

A gold watch and chain inscribed James Doyle
Never seemed much reward for a life of such toil
But I keep his lamp burning and his old union card
And his bones rest here in this sunlit graveyard.

My dad was a miner and a prince among men
Well loved by his wife and his family and friends
And his hardship and toil gave me the one chance I had
And generations of slavery died with my dad.

I mean she even cooks me pancakes
And alka seltzer when my tummy aches
If that ain't love, then I don't know what love is
We even got a secret handshake
And she loves the music that my band makes

Now that I'm allowed to be alone with you
Birthday Girl its your birthday
Wherever you wanna go 
Now you are old enough to go and see the are-rated show now
Are-rated show 
[Black Thought]
Yo, She said she was a magazine editor named Jenning 
Backstage in high heels and painted on jeans 
Probably had the most devious eyes I'd ever seen
Told me she was twenty-two she was only seventeen
She had sumthin' to hide she snuck in from outside 
And got everybody gassed like the car I drive
With all that grown lady ass and my for rap vibe
She said she came to see them roots boy fallout live
But listen,

[Chorus]

Verse 2 [Black Thought]
You see the girls look good but they brains not ready 
I talk to a woman, he mind more steady 
Probably something in the way they designed just more steady
I just let you recite cause the line so heavy
But I shoulda known better cause now I feel like America's underbelly 
R. Kelly got a smart better less, internet predators, chat-room irregulars
This not my twist 
You trying to send me to the therapist 

[Chorus]

Verse 3: [Black Thought]
Now she told me cheddar cheese grits 
Two tomato fried fish 
Cause she heard its my dish
Tryna be my sidekick 
All the people all around thinking she was my chick 
Saying DAMN the girl thick 
But she ain't no twenty-six
Looking at me like am up to sumthin' on the funny tip 
Like I ever been the one to honey jib
Its your birthday so let me know the gift you wanna get 
In fact blow out the candles on the cake and make a wish for me

So they tried asking her to stay

Right now I can only think of one
You look lovely tonight.

Regretted having your brother?
Would you forgive her and kiss her
And tell her you love her?
Or would you press it?
'Cuz being the only child
Could leave ya feeling desperate
In need of attention every second
But since you man of the house you never get it
Pops left without a smile but you never miss him
But when you reminiscing
You wished you had a father figure
At least weekend's man pay a visit
Aww forget it

What about lil' Jason up in prison?
You think an 8 year old had bad intentions?
Pullin' the trigger on dad just barely killed him
Just wanted to protect moms from the brutal hittings
But he a kid so it's their word against his
Moms won't even testify scared of her husband
So he in for some years
Don't even know what he did
But can't forget it now
'Cause it's too late

We come to life when first class takes flight
Only sing the lines that make you press rewind
Even dealing with electric, i think that he regrets in now
Heart in light, dying love
Everything looks better from above
You say it's getting old but i call it vintage love now
Don't regret it now

Trying to live that life/can't slow down
Don't regret it now
Determined by that dice, you only roll twice
You broke now
Don't regret it now

Let's say you and your homey
Best friends one and only
Confidant who I trust, never phony
Just I and the young guy I called my Brodie
We was like age of 5 since he known me
But now it's like hazy skies and in the mornings..
Waking up police say he died hollows pointed
Damn I can' believe you God.. Why you want him?
I needed him more than you. Now, What you lonely?
Just 2 more months man, we was good money
Now he can't go to awards and meet stars
I'm all alone now ridin' in luxury cars..
Life like a movie now someone press fast forward
So I can chill with him again and feel real
I rather have him here then this rap deal..
But he can't regret it now
Walking into that crowd...
Had his jewelry on
Next thing, man down

Curtains open I am a grand finale

Sorry I'm out having the time of my life
And I'm gonna do whatever you'd do

The worms in the barrel, the hanging sun
Those first nervous evenings of perfume and gin
The lost smell on your breath as I helped you get it in
The rush of your lips, the feel of your name
The beat in your heart, the devil's arcade

You said ""Heroes are needed, so heroes get made""
Somebody made a bet, somebody paid
The cool desert morning and nothing to save
Just metal and plastic where your body caved
The slow games of poker with Lieutenant Ray
In the ward with the blue walls, a sea with no name
Where you lie adrift with the heroes of the devil's arcade

You sleep and you dream, your buddies Charlie and James
And wake with a thick desert dust on your skin

Voice says ""don't worry, I'm here
Just whisper the word tomorrow in my ear""
House on a quiet street, a home for the brave
A glorious kingdom with the sun on your face

Rising from a long night as dark as the grave
On a thin chain of next moments and something like faith
On a morning to order a breakfast to make
A bed draped in sunshine, a body that waits
For the touch of your fingers, the end of the day

The beat of your heart, the beat of your heart
The beat of your heart, the beat of your heart
The beat of your heart, the beat of her heart
The beat of your heart, the slow burning away
Of the bitter fires of the devil's arcade

'Cause all I know is I woke up this morning, and something big was gone
Gone into that dark ether where you're still young and hard and cold
Just like when they built you, brother, they broke the mold

Now your death is upon us and we'll return your ashes to the earth
And I know you'll take comfort in knowing you've been roundly blessed and cursed
But love is a power greater than death, just like the songs and stories told

Driftin' like a ghost amongst the trees

Put that anchor down to find a place where he could go

Kept on getting used to dropping anchor in the sea

I climbed the tree to see the world

Full of crazy contradictions, like a child.
First you drive me wild, and then you win my heart
With your wicked art.

Just when I believe your heart's getting warmer, you're cold, and you're cruel.
And I like a fool, try to cope, try to hang on, to hope.

And hooked a berry to a thread;
And when white moths were on the wing,
And moth-like stars were flickering out,
I dropped the berry in a stream
And caught a little silver trout.

I went to blow the fire aflame,
But something rustled on the floor,
And some one called me by my name:
It had become a glimmering girl
With apple blossom in her hair
Who called me by my name and ran
And faded through the brightening air.

When I am old with wandering
Through hollow lands and hilly lands,
I will find out where she has gone,

And walk among long dappled grass,
And pluck till time and times are done

The golden apples of the sun.",The Hazelwood,2005

Built on the sea

With a horse and a ukulele

Does it mean that I can never change my ways?

Down on your brazen knees
Watering the worms and the weeds

Where ma Mudlark and Lewes
Stared me down, you drunken fool

Old teenage debts engulfed my chest
As I contemplate death
Put a challenge to its glamor
And all its loss and glory

Wet afternoon breath was taken deep into my lungs
Thinking of the man I must become
My story has just begun
And I will be returning to myself soon

I've been alone for so many
Of the great moments in my life
Alone like so many
At this moment in my life asking

Father, father anyway I can help ye?
I am only just growing much better to know thee
Thank you for all the things you've given to our family
Given your whole life to your wife and my sister and me

Now I look out north of battle where our ancestors lie in grave
West to Breed where the blacksmith put root to our family name
And I get proud of my birthright, think of the things that I must leave
When I leave behind the city and the living finally

Desire, desire, desire

Desire, desire deep down inside of me
You are not the maker nor the master of me
Help me to better support my family
And better, better of a brother be

Desire, desire deep down inside of me, oh now
You are not the wrecker nor the ruler of me
