The Wailers,"All God's children we got to come together
And share the good feeling
'Cause nothing ever gonna make this world better
If we don't start believing
That love really really really is the answer
Just like the wise men say
Let the night come to see us, the music come free us
And let's start drifting away

Leave all our problems behind now, no worries
Everybody join hands 'cause it's time now, now

Spread the love, spread the love
All over the world
All God's people
Spread the love, spread the love

The Wailers,"Until the philosophy 
Which hold one race superior and another
Inferior
Is finally
And permanently
Discredited
And abandoned
Everywhere is war
Me say war

That until there no longer
First class and second class citizens of any nation
Until the color of a man's skin
Is of no more significance than the color of his eyes
Me say war

That until the basic human rights
Are equally guaranteed to all
Without regard to race
Dis a war

That until that day
The dream of lasting peace,
World citizenship
Rule of international morality
Will remain in but a fleeting illusion to be pursued,
But never attained
Now everywhere is war
War

And until the ignoble and unhappy regimes
That hold our brothers in Angola
In Mozambique
South Africa
Sub-human bondage
Have been toppled
Utterly destroyed
Well, everywhere is war
Me say war

War in the east
War in the west
War up north
War down south
War war
Rumors of war
And until that day,
The African continent
Will not know peace,
We Africans will fight we find it necessary
And we know we shall win
As we are confident
In the victory

Good over evil, yeah
Good over evil
Good over evil, yeah

Could you be loved and be loved?

Don't let them fool ya
Or even try to school ya
Oh, no

The Wailin' Jennys,"Where do you go little bird
When it snows, when it snows
When the world turns to sleep
Do you know, do you know
Is there something in the wind
Breathes a chill in your heart and life in your wings
Does it whisper 'start again'
Start again

Where is the sun in the night
Is it cold, is it cold
Does it feel left behind
All alone, all alone
Does it wander through the dark
Does it wait for the dawn, wish on a star
Does it stray very far
Very far

Where is your home restless wind
Is it there, is it here
Do you search for a place to belong
Search in vain, search in fear
Or is your spirit everywhere
Is your voice every tree
Your soul of the air
If there's no home is there no death
Is there no death",Arlington,2004
The Wailin' Jennys,"Oh all the money that e'er I spent
I spent it in good company
And all the harm that e'er I've done
Alas, it was to none but me 
And all I've done for want of wit
To memory now I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all

Oh all the comrades that e'er I've had
Are sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I've had
Would wish me one more day to stay
But since it falls unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call
Good night and joy be with you all
Good night and joy be with you all",The Parting Glass,2004
The Wailin' Jennys,"Take everything that we've had
Take it and burn it to the ground
Some things were never meant to last
Take it down down down
Take it down

I'm still married to it all
That ain't no place to hand around
My love is fifty feet tall
Take it down down down
Take it down

And I've grown accustomed to the way
You hurled us into space
I'll never make that trip
Tears all rusted on my face
I'm just an empty place
Where your love used to fit

South Carolina, where are you?
You were once lost, now are found
The war is over, the battle's through
Take it down down down
Take it down

Take it down down down
Take it down",Take It Down,2004
The Wailin' Jennys,"Imagine you're a girl on ten mile stilts
You travel round the world, taking it all in
You'll never touch the ground
Is it a blessing or a curse
And if you're too high to be found
Are you lost or just rehearsed

Got a heart that opens clear in this cool September dark
It rests on treetop leaves
And bursts its little sparks
And sometimes it sings its songs
And it lets its secrets out
Except for one that sears inside
That it cannot live without

But if I tell you will you take it
Will you shine it up to me
Can you be strong to let me go on
And set this freedom free

The stars are out tonight
Up here they're ripe to hold
But I have learned what comes to those who get too close
I'm no Icarus in flight
And I'm old enough to know
That love is patient, but still unyielding
If you leave it long enough it lets you go

But if I tell you wil you take it
Will you shine it up to me
Can you be strong to let me go on
And set this freedom free",Ten Mile Stilts,2004
The Wailin' Jennys,"The wind howls 'cross the ice floes
Send the frozen snow skimming
A river on a river hardened over
It doesn't know the way it's going
Is it north or south or westward
It just glides across the shoreline 'til it's over

You came for me in fast forward
On a claim for something ordered
A way through and past the history that held you
I'd tell my own story through you
Tell it loud to never lose you
A moth caught be the flame it could cannot measure
And there we go again, wishing something bolder
Trying to push and pull inside this moment
Trying to mold this life within our hands

This is where the whole world keeps on turning
This is where we come undone...undone

Will they measure me by branches
Count the rings and take my ashes
Mark the ground where I fell and carry on
Or will we bite against the silence
Fill our days with noise and violence
Not recognize our hearts when we are done

There we'll go again wishing something bolder
Trying to push and pull inside this moment
Trying to mold this life within our hands

This is where the whole world keeps on turning
This is where we come undone

We don't know where it's going
Is it north or south or westward
It just glides across the shoreline 'til it's over",This Is Where,2004
The Wailin' Jennys,"Oh sweet peace, never have you fallen
Never have you fallen upon this town
Oh sweet peace, never have you fallen
Never have you fallen upon this town

The black crows are loaded
With the call of things discarded
The ribboned shard of battle
And everything burned
Have they forgotten we live here
Do they think that we gave up
Lay down and grew over
Weeds at every turn

Oh sweet peace, never have you fallen
Never have you fallen upon this town
Oh sweet peace, never have you fallen
Never have you fallen upon this town

I will not rest
Until this place is full of sunlight
Or at least until the darkness
Is quiet for a while
And we will not wait
For that murder to come calling
The night will simply fall
And the morning will rise

Oh sweet peace, never have you fallen
Never have you fallen upon this town
Oh sweet peace, when will you come calling
When will you come calling upon this town",Avila,2006
The Wailin' Jennys,"Hey, maybe the time
Just wasn't right to hang on
When are you gonna learn
Sometimes things turn instead of turn out

Hey, when are you gonna stand
Stop looking over your shoulder
Me, with a head full of words
And not one useful expression
Hey, let go

We, with holes in our hearts
Were whole at the start
Our story began
We film ourselves 'til the end
Try to suspend our lives in the dark

Hey, when are you gonna stand
Stop looking over your shoulder
See, there's a sun in the sky
And a moon that will take us til morning
When are you gonna stand
Stop and begin this moment
Hey, let go
Let go (will we be the ones to understand?)",Begin,2006
The Wailin' Jennys,"Think of this heart as an old accident
A hardened hit and run
Looking ahead but just a little scared
To keep all eyes on the road

Can you be sure
Will this be some good thing
Lucky stars to reckon appear again and again
Can you believe all that has brought you here
You say come on baby let's go ahead and live

Who ever knows if love's a sleight of hand
Will it hold up to the light
And do you ever stop unravelling a happy end
With a mind still wound up from a fight

Can it be real
Will it be some good thing
Weathering the fortunes
What those stars are gonna bring
Will it stay true
Will we both see the whole thing true
You say come on baby let's go ahead and love

Bird on a wire or heart in your hand
Looking for a place to find some rest
If you batten it down it's not living at all
Leaving's just a different kind of death

Could you believe
Will this be some good thing
A place to lay your head down
And the will to look again
Could it be true
Will we both see the whole thing true
You say come on baby let's go ahead
Come on baby let's go ahead
Come baby let's go ahead and live",Some Good Thing,2006
The Wailin' Jennys,"I have come back to you broken
Take me home
And my body bears this trouble
Take me home
Take me back to my beginning
Before the hell of night set in
And I came to this border
Take me home

I have toured the endless starlight
Take me home
I have shattered under midnight
Take me home
There are no vultures in this clearing
Except the ones who brought me here
And I'll no longer feed them
Take me home

Kingdom come, their will was done
And now the earth is far away
From any kind of heaven
Hallowed be these frozen fields
And every single one of us
Still left in want of mercy
Take us home

Now the bells stand still and hollow
Take me home
And no one has come to mourn me
Take me home
Find me where I close my eyes
Beneath this sky of power lines
And let me see us clearly
Take me home

Kingdom come, their will was done
And now the earth is far away
From any kind of heaven
Hallowed be these frozen fields
And every single one of us
Still left in want of mercy
Take us home",Starlight,2006
The Wailin' Jennys,"Once upon a time in a far off land
Wise men saw a sign and set out aross the sand
Songs of praise to sing, they travelled day and night
Precious gifts to bring, guided by the light
They chased a brand new star, ever towards the west
Across the mountains far, but when it came to rest
They scarce believed their eyes, they'd come so many miles
And the miracle they prized was nothing but a child

Nothing but a child could wash these tears away
Or guide a weary world into the light of day
And nothing but a child could help erase these miles
So once again we all can be children for awhile

Now all around the world, in every iittle town
Everyday is heard a precious little sound
And every mother kind and every father proud
Looks down in awe to find another chance allowed",Nothing But a Child,2007
The Wailin' Jennys,"Bright morning stars are rising
Bright morning stars are rising
Bright morning stars are rising

Oh where are our dear fathers?
Oh where are our dear fathers?
They are down in the valley a'praying

The Wailing Souls,"I bind unto myself
Today the strong name of the trinity

Crypt of despair
The old man is there
Forming a circle of magic and prayers

Guarding the well
The black hole to hell
Its evil must never arise I can tell
Holy mission
Forever he's sworn
To protect our world from hatred and scorn
He will not fear
Though the Sabbath is near
Twelve strokes for Candlemass darkness descends

[Chorus]

""Break the circle and all hell comes loose
The well of souls must stay sealed
Ancient force of light against the dark
The well of souls must stay sealed""
Black wind turns out the candles
The air grows cold and threatening
Dark shadows wicked laughter
Brings darkness to your heart
Behold the goat of Mendes
Red burning evil eyes
Lord's prayer holy water
Only faith can save you now

Disharmony, satanic serenade
Black symphony, a tribute to the plague
The twisted souls awakened by the chanting
Unchained at last, rise, they will now rise

A new day's dawn, holy light
Sunlight redeems
Slays the dark, warms and heals, makes you
See nightmares' terror is back in your dreams
Sleep well my friend 'cause
This tale's now to end, don't
Believe our world is as safe's we pretend

Will I reveal a sky heavy and gray?
Will last night be a memory sweetly fading?
How I hate a morning starting out this way
On these lonely, raging mornings I would whip You if I could
But You're on the mighty side of strong
And the perfect side of good
If I raise my hands will You grab my by the wrists
And will You try to pull me from the fray?
And even if my fingers join together into fists
Will You hold me firmly anyway?
Because I would try to escape You but for everyday I'm sure
That You're on the huge side of big
And the holy side of pure

Okay
Hear what I say
As I raise my hands in surrender today
Okay
Here I will stay
Hands in the air, singing have Thine own way

If I raise my hands so weak and thin and frail
Will You reveal the light of mercy in Your eyes?
If I cry to You faintly will my feeble whisper fail?
Or will it find its way to a reply?
Because, now that I'm exhausted I think I'm ready to admit
That I have spent all my resistance on someone I can't resist

Light from my window sill, make my way to the door
I hang my head and still, I know you're wanting more
Over the threshold now, I move across the yard
All that my will allows, my every step is hard
Now in the garden I carve out six feet of space
There make my will comply, lie down upon my face
Been toe to toe too long, I'm tired of fighting You
I see You were too strong 'cause I am black and blue
But now I understand a loser's due to win
How every dying man is sure to rise again
So I raise my left hand one, I raise my right hand two
Under the morning sun, my spirit cries to You

Or maybe just a little upset
Well, no, this isn't pretty
And yes, my hair was longer then
It's what happens when your choices
Are narrowed to fashion or violence
Adjustments, you make adjustments
There's nothing left wrong with me
That money can't cure
But I don't want to be somebody else's
Learning experience
Some rich kid's way to spend his allowance
I want magic in my real world
Some modern voodoo to make it work
Voodoo to make it work
I remembered what you sputtered
Chewing your stupid fuel
You said, you said, ""The amplification of the eternal
Present is the technology of desire."" Shoo!
I thought you were already corroded...
I said, ""You don't know me, I'll be the one
Pulling that perfect crime, flushing
This place down that huge hole
When I quit cigarettes.""
But, it was just more gas
We were all wearing falsies
...weren't we?
So I'll stop being clever
And just say it straight
I guess I set impossible goals
And I don't know when to quit
Is that it? Is that it? Is that it? Is that it?

Found a cure for gravity yet?

Found a cure for hunger yet?

Would have been good to go for lunch

We tried, we said we'd keep in touch
Didn't of course 'till summertime

Could I join him?

In a quiet way unwind

With the world's smallest turkey
Already in the oven, nice and hot

So on with the boots
Back out in the snow
To the only all night grocery
When what to my wondering eyes should appear
In the line is that guy I've been chasing all year
'Spending this one alone,' he said
'Give me a break, this year's been crazy'
I said 'Me too, but why are you
You mean you forgot cranberries too?'

Caught on to what was happening
That Christmas magic's brought this tale
To a very happy ending

The Wake,"I found a book that my mama kept
Filled with secrets she hid
And in a dusty old attic, one mornin' I read
About a woman I never met

Who had dreams like mine
With every page I turned, the words came alive
Wish I could roll out of town like a run-away train
I'll do as I dare, let them call me insane 

I'll never sit on the sidelines of life, I'll dance every dance
If I just had the chance
A tear fell on that faded page
'Cause this was somebody else

Not the mama I knew who never thought of herself
But the times, they were different then
And lines just didn't get crossed
And these words that she wrote, they somehow got lost

Wish I could roll out of town like a run-away train
I'll do as I dare, let them call me insane 
I'll never sit on the sidelines of life, I'll dance every dance
If I just had the chance

The chance that she never had
Is now the gift that is mine
And our here on this road, I'm makin' up for lost time
Yeah, I am my mother's child

As I roll out of town like a run-away train
I'll do as I dare, let them call me insane
I'll never sit on the sidelines of life, I'll dance every dance
While I still have the chance

I'll never sit on the sidelines of life, I'll dance every dance

Shot to pieces above my head
Now tell who's that clown
Who pulled this veil on down

Long black veil

Please then turn it up

And wrestles with some all-night clown

May the good Lord shine a light on you,
Warm like the evening sun.

well, you're in the alley, baby, with your clothes all torn
And your late night friends leave you in the cold gray dawn.
Just seemed too many flies on you, I just can't brush them off.
Angels beating all their wings in time,
With smiles on their faces and a gleam right in their eyes.
Thought I heard on sigh for you,
Come on up, come on up, now, come on up now.

May the good Lord shine a light on you,
Make every song [you sing] your favorite tune.
May the good Lord shine a light on you,
Warm like the evening sun.

Sleep it back to sleep,
I can be most anything I want.

The north side of the moon.
Down here only rich men lose their shirts.

The morning off the street,
But no one cares if he has done his job.
And postcards never came, 
From race tracks by the sea.
From a gambler who says: ""You are still my lucky thing.""

There's been an accident in Bordertown.
Bordertown,
I am your accident in Bordertown.

And drives his stolen jeep,
And drives the kingsnake to its happy hole.
But I stand in the clear,
The only place he fears,
The only place he's never seen me stand.

There's been an accident in Bordertown.

If you want money in your pocket
And a top hat on your head
A hot meal on your table
And a blanket on your bed

Well today is grey skies
Tomorrow is tears
You'll have to wait til yesterday is here

I'm going to New York City
And I'm leaving on a train
And if you want to stay behind and wait
Til I come back again

Well today is grey skies
And tomorrow is tears
You'll have to wait til yesterday is here

If you want to go
Where the rainbows end
You'll have to say goodbye
All our dreams come true
Baby up ahead
And it's out where your memories lie

Well the road's out before me
The moon is shining bright
What I want you to remember
As I disappear tonight

Today is grey skies
Tomorrow is tears
You'll have to wait til yesterday is here

Just as free as a bird and as good as his word
That's why everybody loves him so

Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away
Looks like we warm the steak

On the saddest night in the world, shop window girls, smiled through the rain
And the wet, grey figure called me looks for a man he used to be

I said that it wouldn't matter, now without you I want to die
And the rain-drenched old lady selling flowers in the street
Knows you're gone",Saddest Night in the World,1966

Would sing my childhood song to me

Draw conclusions on the wall.

Singing to my girl
Patience will keep you alight

Rock to the rock
Roll to the roll

If you follow me where I'm going
Might take some time but you'd never now
AndMy gun still shoots and my bird still sings
These tricks are tricks I learned from a king

And I sing myself sick
I sing myself sick
I sing myself sick about you

I sing myself sick
I sing myself sick
I sing myself sick about you

Rock to the rock
Roll to the roll

If you follow me where I'm going
Might take a while but you'd never now
And my gun still shoots and my bird still sings
These tricks are tricks I learned from a king

And I sing myself sick
I sing myself sick
I sing myself sick about you

I sing myself sick
I sing myself sick
I sing myself sick about you",Song for Leigh,2012
The Walkmen,"Family comes from Kentucky
And there's bourbon in the blood
They left the country for the city in nineteen fifty one

Me I'm in between two worlds
Saw you on TV last night
Life looks easy on the TV
We ride into some blue evening
I fill my evenings with images of hazy here after

I don't even know your name
It's your southern heart I'm after
It's your southern heart I'm after

Tell me again how you love all the men you were after
Tell me again how you love all the men you were after
Tell me again how you love all the men you were after",Southern Heart,2012
The Walkmen,"I was the Duke of Earl
The Duke of Earl
But it couldn't last
I was the Pony Express
But I ran out of gas
Oh golden dreams
Golden dreams, all lose their glow,
I don't need perfection, I love the whole
Oh give me a life, that needs correction
Nobody loves, loves perfection
Loneliness, loneliness will run you through
All the kids are laughing, I'm laughing too, oh 

If you want my eyes, take my eyes, they're always true
If you want my heart, take my heart, it's right here for you
It's been so long, been so long, but I made it through
It's been so long, been so long, but I made it through
It's been so long

The kiss is a kiss
The kiss is a kiss
The smiles are our smile

Say your goodbyes
'Cause love will decide

The life in hand
You made your demands
You made your demands
Now what else can ya do
'Cause that don't mean love

It's dark, oh man

Listening to the country station
Wondering where I stand

Love will decide
Love will decide",The Witch,2012
The Waller Brothers,"I once had a darling wife kind, true and sweet
Life was so bright and gay everything complete
But I fell for another who led my life astray
So I'll live in sorrow till my dying day

Down the highway of sorrow I'm traveling alone
I've lost all my true friends I've lost a happy home
I'm heading for destruction I'm on the wrong track
Down the highway of sorrow there's no turning back

I went back to my darling I got down on my knees
I begged her with tear rimmed eyes to give my poor heart ease
But she was hurt so deeply she could not forgive
So I'll live in sorrow as I long as I live",Highway of Sorrow,2008

The Wallflowers,"I'm finding it hard
Just to keep up with someone
Who's hangin' onto nothin'
Only to lose what's never mine

And i'm finding it hard
Just to keep up with something
That's hangin' on to nothin'
To keep all these chains tied up and in line, in line

Pretty angel
She bites the hands of the lion
Ties it up with ribbon
Watches as hound dogs
Bang on her drums, drums

It's so, it's so easy for you to love nobody
It's so easy for you, 'cause you're not tryin' anymore

I seen this girl
She had her hands full of lightning
She rolled it down to me
A lolita smile
With a thorn in her eyes

Now she, she spun the world
Up on the edge of a pearl
A carnivals girl
Up on a ferris wheel forever, forever

It's so easy for you to love nobody
It's so easy for you, 'cause you're not tryin' anymore
Just don't try anymore

Now she, she howled like an owl
Only to fall like a sparrow
And lay beside the scarecrow

Is the song, the song

The Wallflowers,"We took 'em high, we took 'em straight up the hill
They wanted it all, we gave 'em such a fill
In their parades we stole every thrill
And in their games we made every kill

We took them hard, we took them up against the wall
In their loss we never let them fall
In their flames we sailed up to the moon
In their rains we slayed dry like a fire would

So the bottom of my fears
Is that the girl might just disappear
But that'll be the death of me
The day she's just a memory

Well she turned out the lights
When she opened the whites of my eyes
Another one in the dark
Broken hearted mama
Just another one in the dark

When we rolled, rolled on like a big drum
We went to the top just above everyone
They wanted to win, tie us up with a string, and steal everything
We took 'em skin on skin, we laid 'em down in the ring

So i swear, we're a pair
Like loneliness and a prayer
And you know i may still believe
You may still need me

Well, she turned out the lights
When she opened the whites of my eyes
Another one in the dark
Broken from the start
Just another one in the dark

And in their nights we made out with a loud scream
And in their sleep we howled inside every dream
So if you're trying to break me
Come on why don't you shake me
Right out of my tree, the one that you made me, me

Well, she sang out of tune
When she shot down the moon
As i saw my all freeze
Down onto my knees
Where i was hit at the hip, between the cup and the lip
As i was struck down under, with lightning and thunder
As she cut all the strings, that i'd tied to her wings
Leaving me in the dark, we stood just feet apart
But she never seen me at all",Another One in the Dark,1992
The Wallflowers,"Well, you could walk like a stranger head back into here
Bringing gifts while you act so sincere
Bringing gifts for a boy who's five years
Looking for rocks and training wheels

I don't remember you from any of those books
Ashes to ashes and six feet under, face down in a box
Where did you ever learn to treat me like that

You don't seem to have any of that family stuff
You know the hardwood floors and all that penniless rough
Your bad luck follows you like a heart attack
Twist your fingers, soon as break your back

I don't remember you from any of those books
Ashes to ashes and six feet under, face down in a box
Where did you ever learn to treat me like that that that

It's coming from another with a mother who's just like yours
Givin' you headaches and all those mental scores
Give a little, have a little, take some for yourself
Like the needy and the greedy always seem by themselves
Well, you must be, have to be one of these

Hidin' in the shade under your family tree
Think I met you once in a liquor store
No think I saw you hanging by the stage door
Handing out programs to the family theater
Devised a role so you don't mistreat her

Take it wild, take it fast
You never gave yourself a chance
I don't remember you from any of those books
Ashes to ashes and six feet under, face down in a box
Where did you ever learn to treat me like that, that, that, that",Ashes to Ashes,1992
The Wallflowers,"Do you ever stop to count all the invitations
At the end of the day when it comes down to one decision
Of dead beat girls and freaks at a peoples convention
All these sugars with no vitamin sensation

Do you ever stop to look over old relations
Or look to the belly of another one's emotions
Someone young in the winds of a revolution
Trying to save his face in the evolution

Asleep at the wheel
No windshield
But you know that the streets
Here don't change

He's kept alive in the chain of mental starvation
Bone rail skinny, only feeding off frustration
Unlike you who seem bred from corruption
Feeding off the plates of an ununited nation

Asleep at the wheel
No windshield
But you know that the streets
Here don't change

With a lover in the street whose waiting to make a connection
To be the mother to the soul of your next abortion
She'll steal your money with the eyes of a baby's complexion
Then she'll laugh at you and your sexual invention

Smelling like a rose, in the flowers of devotion
Devoted the heat of a spotlight in motion
With a face full of mud even though you were only joking
As if you really understood the value of isolation

Asleep at the wheel
No windshield
But you know that the streets
Here don't change

Your tongue so fast like a freight train coming on rollin'
Every smile you give's just to keep your mouth from clothin'
Every engine burns as a sign of the explosion
Locked in neutral your engines are broken

Like candle wax that sun melts into the ocean
Like the moon that lights the tracks of the old train station
You can color in the lines of mother earth's addictions
And not hold a gun in the face of the earth's abduction

Asleep at the wheel
No windshield
But you know that the streets
Here don't change",Asleep at the Wheel,1992
The Wallflowers,"I know you're tired of waking up on the floor
Pushed to the edge with nothing heavy to hold
Using your clothes as a blanket and a bed
Holding your hands just to lay your head

I know you don't remember ever falling down
Who picked you up, who gathered around
But you don't have to be his girl
And you don't have to be my girl
You can always be your own girl

With the sound of your feet you follow yourself to sleep
Restless and ageless and looking for somethin' to keep
When you finally fall asleep you're awake in dreams
Hanging by the ankles in a skeleton ravine

I know you've kicked the lights, fell on your shoes
Punched out the colors, leaving you the blues
But you don't have to be his girl
And you don't have to be my girl
You can always be your own girl

There's a soft melody that's ringing in my ears
Simple and slow and it always brings you here
With broken crayons you've scribbled on the wall
Shapes of nothing and shadow box them all

Your fingertips are broke and your knees don't bend
Your imagination took the worst hit and cut it's skin
But you don't have to be his girl
You don't have to be my girl
You can always be your own girl

There's a soft melody that's ringing in my ears
And it's the same one you could never avoid in yours
And if you lay down you can hear from tongue to tails
About a tattooed rhythm and drumming by color wheel

Your rung is broken on the bottom of the rope
And you can't tie another, another knot of hope
And you don't have to be his girl
And you don't have to be my girl
You can always be your own girl",Be Your Own Girl,1992
The Wallflowers,"Well, I know you find it hard to smile,
To keep your happiness in style
You pass in silence in the mornin'
You know you shouldn't ever try to ignore me.

And you look to be pretty nervous
Sweaty hands and blood shot eyes.
So hard to identify you,
Just a loser in a loser's disguise.

[Chorus:]
She don't back down,
And she won't come around here
Now there's all this talk about dying
Well I don't get it, for the life of me.

With your fingernails painted red
And your eyes all ready to wed
Decorated from head to toe
Like a magician in a talent show.

[Chorus]

So you've smoked your last cigarette
Burned coldly on a train from Tibet
And broke your last bottle of wine
And unraveled your last ball of twine. Well,

She don't back down,
She don't come around here
Now there's all this talk about dying,
Well I don't get it, for the life of me.

With electricity shut off again
Leaving the night-life only for the madmen

Burned down my neighborhood
Even shot robin hood

And oh my god

With plastic rifles given to every team

Turn and fall
On broken hands and all
Turn and crawl
Seen that sun gone down
And the waterfall
She stood tall in the fallen rain
Right off an orphan train

I believed
See how wrong, how wrong you can be

I know who watches you
Who watches me
I know who hears you
Who hears me
If my eyes blind

Underneath all these lies
She can't get them by
Or through me
See how wrong, wrong you can be

My honey bee
Why are you flyin' so far from me

She keeps her hands so free
And walks through me
Straight on through the dead of night
Her face is painted white
By these street lights
They hold you down so tight
And like hounds they bite

She fell down in her diamond suit
On lonely avenue, her color's only blue
She won't take clues
See how wrong, how wrong you can be

What on earth are you trying to do

And where that hero falls, I held on

Yellow hair in a yellow bow
Little thumb sticking in the exit lane
Two packs of smokes and a candy cane

With women hips and baby lips

If she gets out of here too soon
She'll run fast by the shy of the moon

If she's been havin' the same old dreams
Of lullabies and pale blue skies
Fallen asleep beneath the stars
Orion aims and shoots his arrows oh so far

Aims 'em hard
He shoots the moon and takes her as his own reward
If she's gonna see those stars too soon
She'll run fast by the shy of the moon

If she found out so long ago
That she wants more than all she knows
The river ends right as she goes
Water breaks and she's gone down in the undertow

Just as long as he can see
One hand in the birdfeed
And a hand in the apple tree
He stands in line, just a little behind
A yellow moon that hangs
He's all tangled and he broke his sticks on the links
Of his own chain gang

You oughta see this home that he own
It's like a box of jewelry
He's got his own church bell
And his bed it lays in a gallery
And all the colors they shine like flames
Coming in through the window pane
They end up getting checked over twice
For the reds of someone's veins

It's so cold and blown all apart
It's so cold and needing of a heart

He stands alone on the top of his home
Where all the blue birds flown
Sucks in on his cheeks and he cries
As he moans through a saxophone
He reaches high with his hands in the sky
And puts his fingers right into the storm
Always one to stand under the moon
And blow on his own horn
And anyone with anything has already begun to think
That somebody down there knows
Just how he sat down on his knees in the dirt
And buried someone's rainbow

Is everything i want to be
And sugarfoot disagrees

He still stands tall underneath that apple tree
Man, he's still watching me
His chain gang is tryin' to pull me down
Like the birds and the fireflies
They shoot arrows up into the skies
And they burn all the feathers dry
Well, he only wants to fill his belly up
With rocks till it hurts, then he stops
Well, he don't know what to do with love
If it don't fill his belly to the top

Was drawn on me
And now it's drawn me in
6th Avenue heartache

Below me was a homeless man
I'm singin' songs I knew complete
On the steps alone, his guitar in hand
It's fifty years, stood where he stands

Now walkin' home on those streets
The river winds move my feet
Subway steam, like silhouettes in dreams
They stood by me, just like moonbeams

Look out the window, down upon that street
And gone like a midnight was that man
But I see his six strings laid against that wall
And all his things, they all look so small

Just like me just moved on",6th Avenue Heartache,1996

The Wallflowers,"One, two boys by the river
Down by the water tellin' riddles in the dark
With fireflies under the moonlight
Carvin' the insides of a tree with a knife

His best friend come along
He tried to kiss her

The only difference that I see
Is you are exactly the same as you used to be

One boy lives in a tower
With bow and arrow and the artificial heart
With his girl late in the summer
He loaded the cannon with a jealous appetite
They say that children now they come in all ages
And maybe sometimes old men die with little boy faces

The only difference that I see

When it ain't supposed to do
Oh no no no no
I seen her downtown about an hour ago
Behind the glass at a peep show
I got nervous 'cause I don't know
Can she see me behind that window?

It's almost nine and I'm back in line
I can't get the girl with the Spanish tears out of my mind
I've got to make her mine, all mine
But somethin' is wrong, she don't belong
She oughta be back where she's from
Maybe back on this Mexico City
Man, I don't know her but she sure is pretty

But God don't make lonely girls
Sure didn't want 'em in His world

Yeah, yeah, doo doo doo doo

Now when I make that girl all mine
I'm gonna stand by her once I get inside of
Her barbed wire, once I get inside
I bet she'd look good in a brand new dress
She never felt good in her fish net
She's got to be this towns best mess
But it ain't nothin' that her face would suggest

But God don't make lonely girls
Sure didn't want 'em in His world
God don't make lonely girls
Yeah, yeah, doo doo doo doo

I gotta make her see, I'm a guarantee
Oh, if she'd only come along with me
I can make her see
Gonna take a walk right through these walls
'Cause she's comin' home with me
I ain't even gonna touch her at all

Well this heart is on wheels tonight
Straight through the ghettos and without lights
Now every heart has a blind side
Where it learns how to improvise
Well this place is a whorehouse tonight
Cheaper lovers make expensive wives

But all of these horses
That you chase around
In the end they are the ones
That always bring you down
This invisible city
Where no one sees nothing
We're touching faces in the dark
Feelin' pretty is so hard

Now all of these voices
And all of these noises
With all their illusions of choices
They've come to my door
With one dozen roses
The imitation of good faith
Is how you stumble upon hate
It may have been the first of mistakes
When we held on too loosely
Then opened the gates

But all of these horses
That you chase around
In the end they are the ones
That always bring you down
This invisible city
Where no one sees nothing
We're touching faces in the dark
Feelin' pretty is so hard

Now I try not to tell lies
But there's pressures from inside
So I've learned how to compromise
Good people for alibis

As I listened through the cemetery trees

I seen the sun comin' up at the funeral at dawn
The long broken arm of human law
Now it always seemed such a waste, she always had a pretty face
So I wondered how she hung around this place

And I can't break away from this parade
But there's got to be an opening
Somewhere here in front of me
Through this maze of ugliness and greed
And I seen the sun up ahead at the county line bridge
Sayin' all there's good and nothingness is dead
We'll run until she's out of breath
She ran until there's nothin' left
She hit the end, it's just her window ledge

It feels just like a beat up truck
I turn the engine, but the engine doesn't turn
Well it smells of cheap wine, cigarettes
This place is always such a mess
Sometimes I think I'd like to watch it burn
I'm so alone and I feel just like somebody else
Man, I ain't changed, but I know I ain't the same
But somewhere here in between the city walls of dyin' dreams
I think of death, it must be killin' me

And the same black line that was drawn on you 
Was drawn on me

On the steps alone, his guitar in hand 
It's fifty years, stood where he stands 

Now walkin' home on those streets 
The river winds move my feet 
Subway steam, like silhouettes in dreams 
They stood by me, just like moonbeams 

Look out the window, down upon that street 
And gone like a midnight was that man

And all his things, they all look so small

Wood of a coffin
If I need

Of my mind
In the engine
In cold December
Shootin' fire from the hose

Now turn off your lights

Down a narrow cold black river
Faceless shadows

I would move swift when
The sounds of a trumpet would blow

I've been the strings
I know the vacant face it brings

They may ring before I'm through

In the back of an angel motorcade

I've been remembered
I've been alive
I've been a ghost

I'll still be on this road

From the neckline
When vampires were in fashion
You know I'd even learn
To cut my throat
If I thought I could fit in

'cause I, I once heard
That you gotta learn
How to blend in to this mess
Where nothin's hard
Nothin's precious
And nothin's smooth or flawless

Just screaming to be delivered
For the first time

And mighty blue sea
Looking back, towards a long white beach
Burnin' up into yellow flames

Like a little boy up on a pony
In a show
'cause I can't fix
Something this complex
Any more than I can build a rose

So just keep on letting go
'cause I must be close
To being delivered for the first time

Now I'd rather bleed out
A long stream from being lonely
And feel blessed
Well than drown, laying face down
In a puddle of respect
I was once lost
In the corridors of the arena
In blindfolds
I've been the bull
I've been the whip
I just pulled down the matador

down the assembly line to you.

Sam Cooke didn't know what I know
I'll never be your valentine
The sleepwalker in me
And God only know that I've tried

Let me in, let me drown or learn how to swim
Just don't leave me at the window
I could be the one to be your next best friend
You may need someone to hold you

Sleepwalker, take this knife
You may see someone tonight
You'd be the one that saves my life
When I'm dead asleep dreamin'

Cupid, don't draw back your bow
Sam Cooke didn't know what I know
I'll never be your valentine
The sleepwalker in me
And God only know that I've tried

I'm in your movie and everyone looks sad
But I can hear you, your voice, the laughtrack
But you never saw my best scene
The one where I sleep
Sleepwalk into your dreams

Now, sleepwalker, what's my line
It's only a matter of time
Until I learn to open up my eyes
When I'm dead asleep dreamin'

Cupid, don't draw back your bow
Sam Cooke didn't know what I know
I'll never be your valentine
The sleepwalker in me

Now, the sleepwalker in me
Now, the sleepwalker in me
And God only know that I've tried",Sleepwalker,2000

I'm on top of the world again

Up from under Babylon

I had a home in the fields
Earned my wage in the factories there
And I was raised by the mill
And I worked with my brothers there
I told my mother I'd always write

I headed west for the coast
With the big city lights
Now mama I'm so sorry I've forgotten
But now I'm looking
Up from under Babylon

Now tell me how far I've been
And how deep was I in
Tell me how I conceived
The vanity to believe
That I would not be outnumbered
By the thumbs I have been under

Now stray dogs in the street
Learn how to beg, steal, borrow and cheat
And in the dead summer heat
I fell asleep with blood on my teeth

But those days before I met you girl
Were just ice cream falling down
On the shoes of my world

Disregarding every acre

I smell leaves and burning tires

Blackbird rise up, tell me what have you done

I'm not drunk and I'm not sad

Marching back up the steps
Into the rays of the sun

Under crushing skies of grays
Paralyzed with phantom pains
Before this room became just a place
Where I just sleep through endless days
Spinning webs and carving names
Where thoughts break up, exploding in space

But I once crossed a quarter mile
Through black pools of razor wire
And cut through steel
With the edge of a file
While singing rhapsodies in stride
Hellbent and dignified
Now my time has come
Who you fooling and why?

From the bottom of my heart
Comes a cold dark feeling
There is eminent death
To the promise I'm keeping

From the bottom of my heart
Comes an army of one
Marching back up the steps
Into the rays of the sun

Buried under ruptured skies

Means I'm laughing inside
Two-faced and compromised
I've enraptured you with lies

And tonight everything is mine

Coming up from the depths

I told you so

Sail beneath a burning yellow sun

I could see the dawn through a different set of eyes
There in my slumber passing time

Your hand in mine
In the evergreens drinking wine
I saw the snow fall in black and white
From the auburn sky

I crossed the kingdom through venom pouring rain
In the vacuum of my own brigade

You can tell a few things about the soul of a town
From the blood of the men gone in the ground
Bankrupt and buried by war that is carried out
By messengers now
Was born here and married too young staring
The nose of the barrel down
Went milk to whiskey to the courthouse sitting
With her stoned in her wedding gown

My birthday's in two months and I'll be twenty one
I am the second oldest to an only son
Third generation to carry a gun
I've got brown eyes like my mother does
First I saw blood was in a soldier's hair
Drying to his forehead in the dessert air
I knew his name once but his face I don't dare
Recall in the moments I go back there

Off the record do you see my tears
On my face and in my ears
As the silos reappear
And all of our journeys have led us right back here

There's something in the water we've been passing around
We've eaten the berries there is no doubt
Like our father before us in his paper crown
Kings of nowhere that was ever found
The angels that used to be guarding our beds
Have all wandered off and left us instead
Too strung out and much too sick to defend
Laying in the bathwater all lit up again

And in their games we made every kill.

In their loss we never let them fall
In their flames we sailed up to the moon
In their rains we slayed dry like a fire would.

Is that the girl might just disappear,
But that'll be the death of me,

We went to the top just above everyone,
They wanted to win, tie us up with a string, and steal everything.
We took 'em skin on skin, we laid 'em down in the ring.

So I swear, we're a pair,
Like loneliness and a prayer,
And you know I may still believe,
You may still need me.

When she opened the whites of my eyes

Broken from the start

Come on why don't you shake me,
Right out of my tree,

Moving from their posts with their long bayonets

If the birds are returning, it's safe enough to say that much is true
In the desert that borders between me and you
Where more than a few good men have failed to come back or get through
And the only things living around here don't wanna talk
And the wine isn't working and the vacancy signs are off
The hardships of marching they've only just begun
Love is a country better crossed when you're young

That looks almost human as she barrels down the tracks and comes my way
This no good dog of mine's got the heart of a stray
And is down in the ditch lights before I've even a chance to call his name
I'm watching the clouds overwhelming the evening sun
It's just after lightning and before the thunder comes
When nothing really happens and suddenly then it does
Love is a country better served with someone

I remember the evening you last came home
It was warm as the devil sat back up with his boots put back on
He said you never get boring, you keep me young
There's more work than ever and still only one of me to get it done

With her name on the window where fog settles down on the glass

The Walter Scharf Orchestra,"I was born on a farm out in Ioway
A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree
And we all played just the same ""Goofus"" harmony
And I must admit we made a hit

Throw away the bad news

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1997

Chased darkness out of view
Left your desperate spell on me
Say you feel it too I know you do

Pour yourself all over me
And I'll cherish every drop here on my knees

I wanna love you forever
And this is all I'm asking of you
10,000 lifetimes together
Is that so much for you to do
'Cause from the moment that I saw your face
And felt the fire of your sweet embrace
I swear I knew
I wanna love you forever

My mind fails to understand
What my heart tells me to do
And I'd give up all I have just to be with you
And that would do
I've always been taught to win
And I never thought I'd fail
Be at the mercy of a man,
I've never been

Let's take this now before it's gone

That I would ever wanna be no
I'm breathing for the next second I can feel you
Loving me, I'm gonna Love

The Want,"Now bein' six years old, I had seen some trains before
So it's hard to figure out what I'm at the depot for

Trains are big and black and smokin' - steam screamin' at the wheels 
Bigger than anything they is, at least that's the way she feels 

Trains are big and black and smokin', louder'n July four, 
But everybody's actin' like this might be somethin' more...

Than just pickin' up the mail, or the soldiers from the war
This is somethin' that even old man Wileman never seen before

And it's late afternoon on a hot Texas day
Somethin' strange is goin' on, and we's all in the way

Well there's fifty or sixty people they're just sittin' on their cars
And the old men left their dominos and they come down from the bars

Everybody's checkin', old Jack Kittrel check his watch
And us kids put our ears to the rails to hear 'em pop 

So we already knowed it, when they finally said 'train time' 
You'd a-thought that Jesus Christ his-self was rollin' down the line

'Cause things got real quiet, momma jerked me back
But not before I'd got the chance to lay a nickel on the track 

[Chorus:]
Look out here she comes, she's comin' 
Look out there she goes, she's gone,
Screamin' straight through Texas 
Like a mad dog cyclone

Big, red, and silver 
She don't make no smoke 
She's a fast-rollin' streamline 
Come to show the folks

[Chorus:]

Lord, she never even stopped

She left fifty or sixty people still sittin' on their cars
And they're wonderin' what it's comin' to 
And how it got this far

Oh but me I got a nickel smashed flatter than a dime 
By a mad dog, runaway red-silver streamline...train",Texas,1998

Now get loose, get radical 
Dope with them loose, don't see 'em 
Your playas meet? I don't cheat 'em 
Well, I'm taking ova these companies, 
I got steel bands and twelve dealers 

My music is hot, defending the block 
Put the hand on the court, defend the (?) 
Then play with the pot, handle the rum 
Bag them up, then hit it with mine 
Also, I'm drillin' it, overseas, I'm killin' it 
I jsut came to have some fun, so see you, Lo 
Keep singin' it!

Black girl twerk like Miley Cyrus 
Lets see how many model chicks 
Can fit inside my Ferrari 
You a bad girl? Trim it how you knot 
The kill don't hurt nobody 
I'm rollin' up that loud pack 
My groove fatter than a hot tomalle

Did I grow up according to plan?
And do you think I’m wasting my time doing things I wanna do?
But it hurts when you disapprove all along

And now I try hard to make it
I just want to make you proud
I’m never gonna be good enough for you
Can’t pretend that I’m alright and you can’t change me

‘Cuz we lost it all, nothing lasts forever
I’m sorry, I can’t be perfect
Now it’s just too late and we can’t go back
I’m sorry, I can’t be perfect

I try not to think about the pain I feel inside
Did you know you used to be my hero?
All the days you spent with me now seem so far away
And it feels like you don’t care anymore

And now I try hard to make it
I just want to make you proud
I’m never gonna be good enough for you
I can’t stand another fight and nothing's alright

‘Cuz we lost it all, nothing lasts forever
I’m sorry, I can’t be perfect
Now it’s just too late and we can’t go back

Nothing’s gonna make this right again
Please don’t turn your back

Coming down like running water
Passing by myself alight
In the morning, I would wake to the sound of summer falls
Like little whispers through the signs

She's been living in her uptown world
I bet she never had a backstreet guy
I bet her momma never told her why

I'm gonna try for an uptown girl
She's been living in her white bred world
As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now she's looking for a downtown man
That's what I am

And when she knows what
She wants from her time
And when she wakes up
And makes up her mind

She'll see I'm not so tough
Just because
I'm in love with an uptown girl
You know I've seen her in her uptown world
She's getting tired of her high class toys
And all her presents from her uptown boys
She's got a choice

Oh, oh
Uptown girl
You know I can't afford to buy her pearls
But maybe someday when my ship comes in
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been
And then I'll win

And when she's walking
She's looking so fine
And when she's talking
She'll say that she's mine

She'll say I'm not so tough

The Warlocks,"Well I'm flying down desert streets wrapped in mother's wine and sheets,
Asbestos boots on flaming feet dreaming of forbidden treats,
When uniforms on nighttime beats ask me where I'm going and what I eat.
I answer them with a voice so sweet,
I can't come down till it's plain to see.
I can't come down I've been set free.
Who you are and what you don't make no difference to me.
Well someone trying to tell me where it's at,
And how I do this and why I do that,
With secret smiles like a Chesire cat,
And little wings like a vampire bat,
I fly away to my cold water flat and eat my way to a bone of fat,
And I say to the man with the funny hat,
They say I'll be good to lose my grip,
My hold on reality is starting to slip,
To tell me to got off with this trip,
The say its like a sinking ship,
Life is sweet it's too warm to sip,
And if I drink I'll chuck and flip, I'll just say as I take a nip,
Oh I dream of cotton seas and granite walls and redwood trees,
And ugly eye that only sees endless mirrors and infinite me's,
About the winter's coming freeze this afterthought I say with ease,

I grew up here on Bourbon Street
Playin' for the beer and tips
Livin' by the Poncha Train
Watchin' drunks and sailin' ships
I'm sittin' on a midnight train
Gonna bury momma on my birthday
And never's gonna be too soon
To see these streets of Vieux Carre'
Thirty years ago
Momma was a pretty bride
She took this train to New Orleans
Made a mask for Mardi Gras
And never took it off it seems
Daddy drank away their honeymoon
He never wore his wedding band
They fought just like a hurricane
But she fell in love with Dixieland

And I sat in with the band on Fridays
Now I'm on a train to nowhere

She will find a restin' place
Beneath the garden made of stone
And I came here to find tomorrow

Maybe I can start again

Picks up the tip jar and drops a twenty

I would play guitar and sing

Tell me do You ever cry
When we forget to thank You
For the good things in our lives?

I’ll make it through

I got nobody special to thank
I'm trying to find
A friend of mine

Has anybody here seen Hank

Well, he's sure to be wearing a Stetson
He's as long and as thin as a plank
He's got a fistful of charm
And a gun beneath his arm

Has anybody here seen Hank

Now he ain't in the back of a limo
And he ain't in his bed
He ain't in jail
He ain't out on bail
He ain't getting out of his head

I don't care what he did with his women
I don't care what he did when he drank
I want to hear just one note
From his lonesome old throat

Has anybody here seen Hank

Has anybody here, has anybody here
Has anybody here seen Hank

Come away, human child 
 to the water
Come away, human child 
 to the water and the wild
With a fairy, hand in hand
 for the world's more full of weeping than you can understand

Where dips the rocky highland
 of Sleuth Wood in the lake
There lies a leafy island
 where flapping herons wake
The drowsy water rats;
 there we've hid our fairy vats
Full of berries
 and of reddest stolen cherries

Come away, human child 
 to the water
Come away, human child 
 to the water and the wild
With a fairy, hand in hand
 for the world's more full of weeping than you can understand

Where the wave of moonlight glosses
 the dim gray sands with light
Far off by furthest Rosses
 we foot it all the night
Weaving olden dances
 mingling hands and mingling glances
Till the moon has taken flight;
 to and fro we leap
And chase the frothy bubbles
 while the world is full of troubles
And is anxious in its sleep

Come away, human child 
 to the water
Come away, human child 
 to the water and the wild
With a fairy, hand in hand
 for the world's more full of weeping than you can understand

Where the wandering water gushes
 from the hills above Glen-Car
In pools among the rushes
 the scarce could bathe a star
We seek for slumbering trout
 and whispering in their ears
We give them unquiet dreams;
 leaning softly out
From ferns that drop their tears
 over the young streams

Away with us he's going
 the solemn-eyed:
He'll hear no more the lowing
 of the calves on the warm hillside;
Or the kettle on the hob
 sing peace into his breast
Or see the brown mi",The Stolen Child,1988

Bound by a ball and chain

It ended up in tears

From Canada she hailed
We crossed swords in San Francisco
We both lived to tell the tale

I'd give her my love

The Waterboys,"(Traditional)

There were three old gypsies came to our hall door
They came brave and boldly-o
And one sang high and the other sang low
And the other sang a raggle taggle gypsy-o

It was upstairs downstairs the lady went
Put on her suit of leather-o
And there was a cry from around the door
She's away wi' the raggle taggle gypsy-o

It was late that night when the Lord came in
Enquiring for his lady-o
And the servant girl she said to the Lord
""She's away wi' the raggle taggle gypsy-o""

""Then saddle for me my milk white steed
- my big horse is not speedy-o
And I will ride till I seek my bride
She's away wi' the raggle taggle gypsy-o""

Now he rode East and he rode West
He rode North and South also
Until he came to a wide open plain
It was there that he spied his lady-o

""How could you leave your goose feather bed
Your blankeys strewn so comely-o?
And how could you leave your newly wedded Lord
All for a raggle taggle gypsy-o?""

""What care I for my goose feather bed
Wi' blankets strewn so comely-o?
Tonight I lie in a wide open field
In the arms of a raggle taggle gypsy-o""

""How could you leave your house and your land?
How could you leave your money-o?
How could you leave your only wedded Lord
All for a raggle taggle gypsy-o?""

""What care I for my house and my land?
What care I for my money-o?
I'd rather have a kiss from the yellow gypsy's lips
I'm away wi' the raggle taggle gypsy-o!""

A cloven dancing jet
That from the milk-white marble
For ever foam and fret
Far off in drowsy valleys
Where the meadow saffrons blow
The feet of summer dabble
In their coiling calm and slow
The banks are worn forever
By a people sadly gay
A Titan with loud laughter
Made them of fire clay
Go ask the springing flowers
And the flowing air above
What are the twin-born waters
And they'll answer Death and Love

With wreaths of withered flowers
Two lonely spirits wait
With wreaths of withered flowers
'Fore paradise's gate.
They may not pass the portal
Poor earth-enkindled pair
Though sad is many a spirit
To pass and leave them there
Still staring at their flowers
That dull and faded are
If one should rise beside thee
The other is not far

She will say with bated breath
By the door of Mary's garden
Are the spirits Love and Death",Love and Death,1993

The Waterboys,"I dreamed about Jimi Hendrix
He came back for one day
Was born weepin' out of an egg
The mid-wife said
And straight away began to pray
With lifted head

He spent the early hours
Communing with the morning stars
And then he came over to my house
Where he tried out my guitar

He was young and black and beautiful
Big eyed, perfect skin an'
He played my guitar like a lightning storm
Like twirlin' feathers in the wind
He could make it sound like the end of the world
A fire, the flick of a knife
He could squeeze it slow and masterful
Like the hand that brought the world to life

Together we strolled in sculptured gardens
Passed the sleepy afternoon
Maids were dartin' back and forth
From a window came a violin tune
Angels, dressed as nurses toyed with playin' cards
Looters sprung from prisons filled the yard

A yellow sun hung low and dawned,
And as it dipped
Jimi stood up straight, grinned
And shook his velvet hips

Callin' himself King Electric
In the evening he went wild
Played on a dozen stages
In the clubs of New York -
Lit the city end to end
Wired it up, fired it up
Scarved, bejewelled, long-legged, snake-limbed
Athletic, driven, dangerous

He made all Manhattan shake
And every street and sidewalk quake
His stratocaster caused the mighty Empire State
To vibrate
His whammy bar caused shock-eyed punks from
Hackensack and Yonkers
Raised on speed, metal and rap
To enter trance and levitate

He played Purple Haze and Pyramid,
Voodoo Child and Sin-E,
Up From the Skies and Storm Free
In King Tut's Wah-Wah hut

He did a forty-two minute

I'm gonna suffer for you no longer
I'm gonna suffer for you no more
I'm gonna write you out of my life
And shut the door

You pushed me to the edge time and again
I've been living in your shade since I can't remember when
Now I'm bringing this charade to an end

There was subtlety and skill in your manipulative ways
You chipped away my will so you could make me stay
You soothed me with your voice until I obeyed
But I'm making my own choice from today

You used the tongue of love like a boxer uses fists
You contained me like a glove or a creeping cloak of mist
You guaranteed the stars but there always was a twist
Now I see you as you are, Egotist !

plugged in to the medicine way

The Waterboys,"When I left my home and my family
My mother said to me
""Son, it's not how many Germans you kill that counts
It's how many people you set free!""
So I packed my bags
Brushed my cap
Walked out into the world
Seventeen years old
Never kissed a girl
Took the train to Voronezh
That was as far as it would go
Changed my sacks for a uniform
Bit my lip against the snow
I prayed for mother Russia
In the summer of '43
And as we drove the Germans back
I really believed
That God was listening to me
We howled into Berlin
Tore the smoking buildings down
Raised the red flag high
Burnt the reichstag brown
I saw my first American
And he looked a lot like me
He had the same kinda farmer's face
Said he'd come from some place called Hazzard, Tennessee
Then the war was over
My discharge papers came
Me and twenty hundred others
Went to Stettiner for the train
Kiev! said the commissar
From there your own way home
But I never got to Kiev
We never came by home
Train went north to the Taiga
We were stripped and marched in file
Up the great Siberian road
For miles and miles and miles and miles
Dressed in stripes and tatters
In a gulag left to die
All because Comrade Stalin was scared that
We'd become too westernized!
Used to love my country
Used to be so young
Used to believe that life was
The best song ever sung
I would have died for my country

But whatever needs to happen
Let it happen, let it be

His aura eaten by his jealousy
And all the drugs he took

Something beautiful is born

A black hallelujah split the night
Anarchists and priests were playing strip jack 
Underneath the crude lamplight 
I came upon a weeping soldier

He held the royal flush

In my belly six wild wolves curse and howl from their foul hole

He tightened up his belt

Cluny Hill inn the distance
Summer on the way

Living one step at a time
Putting one foot in front of the other
It sure feels right
Healing on my mind
Been a long way
Been a long way to the light
I'd made it to Manhattan
Built myself a nest

Leading a band

Tell him your plans!

Wilting in the heat
Buzzing up and down to Bearsville
And back to Hudson Street

And how to visualize
Just breathing, being still
Never felt more alive!

I spent the fall in transit
Circling the moon
Like a cat on a hot tin roof
Like a fiddle without a tune
I found what I was searching for
In Mrs Caddy's book
I had to go there straightaway
Have myself a look
I flew back to Scotland
Anticipation in my bones
The old country welcoming me
Like a prodigal coming home
I knelt and kissed the tarmac
In the wild Atlantic rain
Felt the fiery Gaelic blood
Rising in my veins
Living one step at a time...
I spent the night in Glasgow
Flew to Inverness
I found the place and at the first
I was not impressed
Nobody said hello
The faces left me cold
Back then how was I to know
All that would unfold?
I entered the Sanctuary
Heard the voice of a girl
Sending out a circle of light
Clear across the world
I shuddered in the Power
Like a seedling in a storm
I've been traveling to this place
Since the moment I was born
Flew back to New York City
Singing the big city blues
The sand of Findhorn Bay
Still clingin' to my shoes
I tried to re-start my life
But the life I knew was gone
I had to let go everything
But that's another song!
Living one step at a time...
So I'm sitting in my bedroom
Overlooking Findhorn Bay
Cluny Hill in the distance
Summer on the way
I'm watching sailing boats
Bobbing to and fro
Time to hit the road
The only way I know...
Living one step at a time...",Long Way to the Light,2005

From the bonds that hold me fast 
And the chains all around me

Taken years before I found you
You wore a tangerine beret
The lights of angels played around you
Hair tumbling long like waves
And breaking on your brow
You were beautiful then, sweet angel
You’re way more beautiful now

Your kiss was like the morning dew
Your lips were soft and wet
A fateful breeze was blowing through
The desert when we met
Danger closed around us
We made it through somehow
You were beautiful then, sweet angel
You’re way more beautiful now

Look down the carousel of years
And darling there you are
A dancer crying salty tears
A vagabond, a star
The slayer of mediocrity
Of every sacred cow
You were beautiful then, sweet angel
You’re way more beautiful now

By water’s edge a spirit dances just beyond my reach
From beach to promenade and back from promenade to beach
A ghost of golden hair, a ghost of silver jeans
The slender fleeting phantom, of you at seventeen

From deep of sleep I wake at dawn 
But as I wake I find
A distant wave still breaking on
The west coast of my mind
Time casts its grand illusion
Such glimpses we’re allowed

You’re way more beautiful now

And swore that good is ill

The Waterboys,"I tried to sleep upon my back so I could
Hold her all night long as in my 
Arms she slept, alas, but no I couldn’t
And when daybreak came and found her
At the far side of the bed I tried to 
Wake her, tried to stir her, but she wouldn’t
In her fug she lay like someone dead
And even when I’d tug her head and
Press and nip and agitate and shake her
Or call her name or whisper it against her ear,
My breath warm, there were 
No words in this universe would wake her

The girl who slept for Scotland 

It took me time to comprehend
This state of play extended unto 
All her working, waking, shaking hours
For when she finally woke, deep in the day
Still she did sleepwalk like a hollow ghost
A-float in haunted towers
And though she heard she didn’t see
And though she saw she didn’t hear,
Attending only to what seemed precise and kind
For she was settled in her dream,
A shopping list of small illusions,
Pretty stories that she told her drowsy mind

The girl who slept for Scotland 

Yet I remember a day by a river wild
When she clung to me hard like a darling child
And a night in the sheets of a Dublin bed
When she moaned like a woman
And gave sweet head
When we sang in tongues together
And our synchronised guitars
Played music to the rafters
Made love among the stars
And our bodies beat like light
In love’s bold embrace
As her tiny kisses burst like
Popping suns around my face

But then drift, recline, collapse,
The lights went out, she fell asleep again
Before my kiss-wet face was even dry
I need another haircut she’d say,
Talking in her sleep, the sleep-motes 
Gathered in the dust-bowls of her eye
She teetered down the road apiece,
She and her man, from dozy bedsit land
To junkshop, with her sleeping clothes in sacks
And when I’d gone she teetered down the road again,
Yawning as she went,
And went and brought the bloody damn things back

Razor-quiffed and leather-squeezed
Sideburns flickering in the breeze

Smoking a reefer he just rolled
Full of acapulco gold
With Jimi Hendrix and Bob Marley

I can see Elvis
Prowling like a cat across a funky bandstand
Keith Moon behind him banging drums
Charlie Parker all thumbs
John Lennon doing handstands

Quizzing Shakespeare on his plays
Showing Crazy Horse and Marvin Gaye

I was ready to be humbled
By the words that you had written
By the syllables you mumbled
Yeah, I was ready in my heart
To have my heart invaded
By the fervour of your passion
Yes, I came to be persuaded

But when I heard your ragged voice
Something switched in my perception
And I knew I was the victim
Of a beautiful deception
All my once exact beliefs
Like tangled threads unravelled 
I walked out, stunned and liberated
And so began my travels

Said the handsome taxi driver
And he sighed like seven bridges
Like a natural-born survivor
As we drove into the night
I could feel the forest jangling
All the choices laid before me
And their consequences dangling

We came upon a stricken ship
That must have once been splendid
The captain as he died said “Boys,
Our revels now are ended”
I heard a wild holy band
Playing jazz that was outrageous,
That invoked the days of rapture
When our love was still young and contagious

Keep the river on your right
And the highway at your shoulder
And the front line in your sights, pioneer
Keep your eye on the road
Remember what you told her
This is all in code, my dear

In a dim-lit motel room
Two sad lovers were discoursing
On the dignity of exile
And the merits of divorcing
She said “all certainty is gone”
But he leapt up, still denying,
Cried “I won’t believe the flame I lit
Is dead or even dying”

She left him drooling in the dust
And with rucksack packed begun her 
Bitter journey to the border
Which is where I wooed and won her
She was Aphrodite, Helen, Thetis,
Eve among the satyrs
She was Venus in a v-neck sweater
She was all that ever mattered

Keep the river on your right
And the highway at your shoulder
And the front line in your sights, pioneer
Keep your eye on the road
Remember what you told her
This is all in code, my dear

Like Dean Moriarty’s ghost
I came in quest of secret knowledge
In the winter of my journey
To a crumbling Druid college
There I read the books of lore
And contemplated in seclusion
But I took my leave embittered, 
Still in love with my illusions

In the drizzling Irish rain
As a tender dawn was breaking
In a doorway I stood spellbound by
The ancient music they were making
I took my breakfast with the Gods
On a blushing summer morning
Till a wind blew them all away
I had misread every warning

And the highway at your shoulder
And the front line in your sights, pioneer
Keep your eye on the road
Remember what you told her
This is all in code, my dear

I watch the scenes mutating
Like an old time frontier ballad
Or a carousel rotating
As if in a moment from a film
With astonishing precision
The camera zooms in close
And a figure comes into vision 

I’m in Tokyo, it’s dawn
And it’s raining hallelujahs
Down the bright-lit neon canyons
Along the sidewalks of Shibuya
I’m trying to take a stance
And rise above my contradictions
But I’m just a bunch of words in pants
And most of those are fiction

Open seven days, called The Brilliant Mistake
Where a crow-haired girl with scarlet lips 
And slender hips served up coffee and cake

Charlie Parker, Miles and Coltrane blew
I’d kick back in my chair, that sweet honey’d jazz
In the air, the sun shining through

By the twisted grace of the law of supply and demand
Well, there’s no use crying and no use sighing over
Stone, wood, wire, glass and cement
But there’s a little record store with a wooden floor
That ain’t there no more that I used to frequent

With an old-fashioned barman wearing old-fashioned clothes
But when I get there it’s been bulldozed

So I follow my nose down Comatose Lane
Through the stripped back, ripped up wastes
Of Woebegone Square
Till I find myself on Deadbeat Street,
Feet beginning to ache, despair in the air
The only thing bright in this blighted town
Are the billboard adverts everywhere displayed
Like mocking shades
And the musty, dusty second-hand bookstore
Is now a scum-encrusted amusement arcade

The Waterboys,"Come here

Her communique arrived with its expression of her feeling
I swear I had no idea she'd been holding in concealing
Such a storm of words unsaid
Though absurd as it appears
Had been blowing in her head
For twenty-seven years
I knew I had to face her so I grabbed my Davey Crocket
Threw a scarf around my neck
And twenty Dollars in my pocket
Found her in the same old place
Pamphlet in her fist
When she saw my windblown face
She said well, look at who it is

Meet me on the mad parade
When the midnight bells are chiming
We'll dress up as the harlequin and the clown
Pile up all the wonders that we've made
In a tower too tall for climbing
And we'll burn the damn thing down

In the great November lake she was older still alluring
Her hair grey and longer than it ever had been during
The days we loved an slept
In her bed of faded wood
In the little place she kept
In a crumbling neighborhood
We walked along a while
Like we were old companions
But I could feel the gap between us
Yawning like a canian
She with her church and code
Her extravagant believes
Me a creature of the road
A child of dust and grief

Meet me on the mad parade
When the midnight bells are chiming
We'll dress up as the harlequin and the clown
Pile up all the wonders that we've made
In a tower too tall for climbing
And we'll burn the damn thing down

She smoked a cigarette and blew smoke rings at the ceiling
Said if you're problem is long standing man
Why don't you try kneeling
Now your face I see you're still a sinner in the mist
Setting up your little will
Is king in place of His
I said I've heard about sin
Down the long wheels of ages
I cracked books of lies
With a thousand twisted pages
Then I looked her in the eye
And asked her clear and plane
If your religion was a lie
Then what would remain

She said if God looked beaten hard
And to loving hands to heal with
And there's nothing in my day that I ain't got the strength to deal with
I said darling I confess
The same applies to me
And that's for all the rest
We agreed to disagree

Meet me on the mad parade
When the midnight bells are chiming
We'll dress up as the harlequin and the clown
Pile up all the wonders that we've made
In a tower too tall for climbing
And we'll burn the damn thing down
Yes we'll burn the damn thing down",November Tale,2015

Have I mentioned my parents are getting back together again
It's been twenty-five years
Of spreading infection
Somehow we're not affected
So my mom, she brushes her hair
And my dad starts growing bob dylan's beard
And I share with my friends a couple of beers
In the atlanta streets
In the belly of the beast

The Watson Twins,"I was of poor folk
But my mother had a rabbit fur coat
And a girl of less character pushed her down the la river
'hand over that rabbit fur coat'
She put a knife to her throat
'hand over that rabbit fur coat'
When my ma refused, the girl kicked dirt on her blouse
'stay away from my mansion house'

my mother really suffered for that
Spent her life in a gold plated body cast
Now, you ask, did she get that girl back?
She payed a visit to that mansion house
She knew the girl was not there
But her father was in cufflinks with slicked-back black hair
He invited her in, they never sang a note
But she took off that rabbit fur coat

and who do you think came home?
Miss so and so
She took one look at my mama and what did she say?
'why are you stealing from my mansion house?'
'I'm in love with mr so and so
He invited me in, I'm a girl no more'
Then she dragged my ma out by her throat
'hand over that rabbit fur coat'

let's move ahead twenty years, shall we?
She was waitressing on welfare, we were living in the valley
A lady says to my ma 'you treat your girl as your spouse
You can live in a mansion house'
And so we did, and I became a hundred-thousand-dollar kid
When I was old enough to realize, wiped the dust from my mother's eyes
It's all this for that rabbit fur coat

but I'm not bitter about it
I've packed up my things and let them have at it
And the fortune faded, as fortunes often do
And so did that mansion house
Where my ma is now, I don't know
She was living in her car, I was living on the road
And I hear she's putting stuff up her nose
And still wearing that rabbit fur coat

but mostly I'm a hypocrite
I sing songs about the defecit
But when I sell out and leave omaha
What will I get?
A mansion house and a rabbit fur coat
",Rabbit Fur Coat,2006
The Watson Twins,"What are you changing?
Who do you think you're changing?
You can't change things
We're all stuck in our ways
It's like trying to clean the ocean
What do you think, you can drain it?
Well, it was poison and dry
Long before you came

But you can wake up younger under the knife
You can wake up sounder if you get analyzed
And I'd better wake up
There but for the grace of God go I

It's hard to believe your prophets
When they're asking you to change things
With their suspect lives, we look the other way
Are you really that pure, sir?
Thought I saw you in Vegas
It was not pretty, but she was (not your wife)

But she will wake up wealthy
And you will wake up forty-five
And she will wake up with baby
There but for the grace of God go I

What am I fighting for?
The cops are at my front door
I can't escape that way
The windows are in flames
And what's that on your ankle?
You say they're not coming for you
But house arrest is really just the same (just the same)

Like when you wake up behind the bar
Trying to remember where you are
Having crushed all the pretty things
There but for the grace of God go I

But I still believe
And I will rise up with fists
And I will take what's mine
There but for the grace of God go I

I'll run away with you

Spinning on that dizzy edge

Why won't you ever say
That I'm in love with you?
Yeah, I'm in love with you

You soft and only, you lost and lonely
You strange as angels
Dancing in the deepest oceans
Twisting in the water, you're just like a dream

I must have been asleep for days
I moved my lips to breathe her name
I opened up my eyes

Alone above a raging sea

And drowned her deep inside of me

I let you in on a secret
It was the very last secret left in camden town
I could see the sky through the windows
From the street where the fire took the roofs out

The trains ran softer than butter
Rappelled off the lines of the latter

I was drunk and I was blind
You said you didn't mind
I was blind and I was drunk
You didn't mind that's what you said

When I left you were still sleeping
Though morning that day started at six in the evening
I had to go and do my work again
I had to go and play
There was steam trains and seagulls
In my lungs
Children in the distance
In my lungs
I let out a cough
And when I coughed I laughed
And just for a second stopped breathing

I was drunk and I was blind
You said you didn't mind
I was blind and I was drunk
You didn't mind that's what you said

We just get thinner and thinner
We just get thinner and thinner
You and me we're not in this thing together

The Waylons,"[Chorus]
A tongue can accuse and carry bad news
The seeds of distrust, it will sow
But unless you've made no mistakes in your life
Be careful of stones that you throw.

A neighbor was passing my garden one time
She stopped and I knew right away 
That it was gossip, not flowers, she had on her mind
And this is what I heard my neighbor say:

""that girl down the street should be run from our midst
She drinks and she talks quite a lot 
She knows not to speak to my child or to me.""
My neighbor then smiled and I thought:

[Chorus]

A car speeded by and the screamin' of brakes
A sound that made my blood chill
For my neighbor's one child had been pulled from the path
And saved by a girl lying still.

The child was unhurt and my neighbor cried out
""oh! who was that brave girl so sweet? ""
I covered the crushed, broken body and said
""the bad girl who lived down the street.""

Wait near the end of September. Wait for some stars to show. Try so hard not to remember what all Empty playgrounds know: that sympathy is cruel.
Reluctant jester or simpering fool. But six feet off the highway, our bare legs stung with wheat, We'll dig a hole and bury all we could not defeat, and say that we'll stay for one more year.

Drunk driving, some form of soft suicide.
Sitting in silence and staring at ceilings or peeling the paint off of things to confide.

Show me the scar that you got when you fell off your bike.
Ask me the questions you never want answers to.
We can re-write them however we like.
Stop the hardwood floor's lopsided grin.

Leave the dirt and dead flowers in a brown coffee.
Let your hand melt a hole in the frost.

Killing time and killing hope.

And all our answers sound the same.
Under sputtering flourescents,

After re-fills are re-filled.
Negotiations at a stand-still,
Spoon and rolling saucer stilled.
If you ask how I got so bitter,

I'll ask how you got so vain.
And all our questions blur together.
The answers always sound the same.
We can't look at one another.

I'll say something thoughtful soon,
But I can't listen to the quiet so I hum this mindless tune 
I stole from some dumb country-rock star.
I don't even know his name.

Tell me why we sound so lame.
Why we communicate in questions and all our answers sound the same.",None of the Above,1999

Local papers open to the faces
Passed away to wonder what they're holding
In those hands we're never shown the places
Formal photographs refuse to mention
His tiny feet, that birthmark on her knee
The tyranny of framing our attention
With all the eyes they're eyes no longer see

And darkness comes too early you won't find
The many things you owe these latest dead
A borrowed book, that check you didn't sign
The tools to be believed with be beloved
Give what you can to keep to comfort this
Plain fear you can't extinguish or dismiss

Take depositions from a strangers face,
Paint every insignificance a sign.

Oh, let the midnight special shine her everlovin' light on me

And you go marching to the table, you see the same old thing

If you say anything about it, you're in trouble with the man

Oh let the midnight special shine her light on me
Oh let the midnight special shine her everlovin' light on me

Well, if you ever go to Houston, than you'd better walk right
And you have better not stagger and you'd better not fight
Because the sheriff will arrest you, he's gonna take you down
And when the jury finds you guilty, you're penitentiary bound

Oh let the midnight special shine her light on me
Oh let the midnight special shine her everlovin' light on me

Well, yonder comes Miss Rosie, how in the world did I know?
Well, I know her by her apron and the dress she wore
An umbrella on her shoulder, a piece of paper in her hand
She goes marching to the captain, she says ""I want my man""

I spied a lofty clipper ship and to her I did steer
I heisted out my signals which she so quickly knew
And when she saw my bunting fly she immediately hove to-woo-woo

She had a dark and rovin' eye, and her hair hung down in ringlets
She was a nice girl, a proper girl but one of the rovin' kind

Oh pardon me, she says to me, for being out so late
But if my parents heard of this all sad would be my fate
My father is in politics, a good and righteous man
My mother is an acrobat, I do the best I can

She had a dark and rovin' eye, and her hair hung down in ringlets
She was a nice girl, a proper girl but one of the rovin' kind

I took her for some fish and chips and treated her so fine
And hardly did I realize she was the rovin' kind
I kissed her lips, I missed her lips and found to my surprise
She was nothin' but a pirate ship rigged up in a disguise

She had a dark and rovin' eye, and her hair hung down in ringlets
She was a nice girl, a proper girl but one of the rovin' kind

So, come all you good sailor men who sail the wintry sea
And come, all you apprentice lads, a warnin' take from me
Beware of lofty clipper ships, they'll be the ruin of you
For 'twas there she made me walk the plank and pushed me under, too

She had a dark and rovin' eye-uh-eye and her hair hung down in ringlets
She was a nice girl, a proper girl but one of the rovin' kind",The Roving Kind,1996

I walked down the street to the grocery store
It was crowded with people both rich and both poor
I asked the man how his butter was sold
He says one pound of butter for two pounds of gold, I said

So long, it's been good to know ya
So long, it's been good to know ya
So long, it's been good to know ya
What a long time since I've been home
And I've gotta be driftin' along

My telephone rang and it jumped off the wall
That was the preacher makin' his call
He said, ""we're waiting to tie the knot
You're getting married believe it or not""

The church was jammed and the church was packed
The pews were crowded from the front to the back
A thousand of friends waiting to kiss my new bride
But I was so anxious I rushed her outside, told her

So long, it's been good to know ya
So long, it's been good to know ya
So long, it's been good to know ya
What a long time since I've been home
And I've gotta be driftin' along",So Long (It's Been Good to Know You),2011

The Webb Brothers,"I was a highwayman
Along the coach roads I did ride
With the sword and pistol by my side
And many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
And many a soldier shed his life blood on my blade
They fin'lly hung me in the spring of '25
But I am still alive

I was a sailor
And I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide
I sailed a schooner 'round the horn of Mexico
I went aloft to furl the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they say that I got killed
But I am living still

I was a dam builder
Across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around
Seems like it all goes 'round and 'round
And 'round and 'round

I'll fly a starship
Across the universe divide
Until I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again
And again, and again, and again.",Highwayman,2009

Of things that they remember well
Stories and faces dearly held

These would have a tale to tell
Of sun goin' down and dinner bell
And children playing at hide and seek from floor to rafter

For bein' cold and blind and weak
They would tell you that it's only
That I have a stubborn streak

And every dream that we came to seek or followed after

I'll take you to all
Beautiful places that you've never seen

Against everything they tell us we should be
We're striving to mold our lives by our dreams
So our dreams can become reality

Won't you come and take a ride with me
I'll take you to all
Beautiful places you've never seen
But you always wanted to
And we'll find our hearts on this lonely stretch of road
And I will be there

We're trying to win our hearts back in a world
Where we just don't know who we are
We're trying to win our hearts in a world where
The others are the ones who wear the crown

So follow your heart and you
Will find it on on your own
And it'll all become clear by the time we make it home
And we'll always remember
These talks that we've had
And I will be there

The doors open wide and I can't believe my eyes

'Cause you and me have stood the test of time
And proved that we, we will make it out alright

Funny thing is it doesn't matter much
What the world could try and throw at us
'Cause they could never touch us

You wanna walk with me
Well if you love me
Then just love me

Lay your life down at the altar

No more than how their idols
And various poems with lust in their eyes
They crave for more
To hate the place where the court played carnivores

When everyone will give account
For what they've done

Look up
Say your prayers on your knees
Look up!
Say your prayers
Look up!
Say your prayers

You want us to be like you always thought He would

Just passing through

And I went with the flow
Now I know what I know
That was then, this is now
And I understand how
How I know
Where to go

And I cancelled that call
I thought about it and I want it all
So I picked up the pieces you left on the floor
And went out for more

And I went with the flow
Now I know what I know
That was then, this is now
And I understand how
How I know
Where to go

And I know that we took them by surprise
And I know we were right before their eyes
And it's about time
Yeah it's about time

So I walked through the door
They looked right at me, but could not ignore
And the drinks were expensive, stories were told
And I had a ball

And I cancelled that call
You though about it and you want it all
So you picked up the pieces I left on the floor
And walked out that door

And I went with the flow
Now I know what I know
That was then, this is now
And I understand how

The Weekend,"Blue eyes, I think of you, it's easy
Somehow I just thought that you'd complete me
Days will come and days will go without you
Never know just what it is I'm going to do

Look at me, I'm on the street
And I'm dancing, oh-whoa-oh
Look behind your sunglasses
Your eyes sing

See you with your arms wrapped 'round another
Makes me wonder why I even bother

Look at me, I'm on the street
And I'm dancing, oh-whoa-oh
Look behind your sunglasses
Your eyes sing

Don't you know you're what I live for, what I die for?
Heartbreak running through my veins just makes me want more
Can't you see my tears fall when you walk out the door?
Don't you know you're what I live for, what I die for?

Too late to just let you go, I'm stuck here
Waiting for a word from you that sounds sincere
Standing on a mountain top, I'm falling
Starry nights, they move me when you're calling

Look at me, I'm on the street
And I'm dancing, oh-whoa-oh
Look behind your sunglasses
Your eyes sing

Don't you know you're what I live for, what I die for?
Heartbreak running through my veins just makes me want more
Can't you see my tears fall when you walk out the door?

The Weekend,"Today is gonna be my day and nothing is gonna get in my way
Certainly not this, certainly not this
Certainly not our last goodbye kiss
Everything that could go wrong I'm gonna keep at bay

When they said all great men will fall
And that you won't win them all, I say, fight

Now this smile has been in hiding for far, far too long
You can't bottle it up I won't bottle it up
It's time we both said enough is enough
With everything that has gone wrong it's time we both moved on

When they said all great men will fall
And that you won't win them all, I say, fight

Now I was just waiting for the sun to come up
To shed a little light on the situation and why there's all this hesitation
When it was so clear that you don't even know what you were fighting for
When nothing worked out you shouted out war
But it's so clear you're not gonna win here

Today is gonna go my way
No matter what anyone might say, fight

The Weeknd,"Everybody wanna know where you got your stuff
And you say ""Oh man, I got the muthafuckin plug""
Everybody sayin', ""Aye, where you get that from?""
And you feel so coolin' every time you in the club

If y'all wanna go to the bar, drinks on us

If y'all wanna hang out with the gangstas, y'all go 'head
I'm just gonna count a little mothafuckin' bread
If y'all wanna slither with the snakes then y'all go 'head
I keep a pedicured lawn so them snakes, they will be dead
Tears of joy run down my cheek onto the soil
I would trick off on your bitch but she ain't loyal
Nothin' but love for you niggas ridin' with no tint
Grand total 5 digits make these hoes repent
Popped a couple pills, I feel like Johnny Mad Dog
I lost a couple friends, I'm tryna get these bands, dog
You know we in this bitch, we throwin' up them grands, y'all
And once we hit the club we 'bout to fuckin' go ham, y'all
My comrades want them mils, my comrades want them millions
My comrades want the bills, my comrades want them billions
My comrades want the tri's, my comrades want them trillions
Yeah we need more than racks, my comrades want them illions

Been proven you ain't ever goin' up
Every time you hit the club, you always fuck it up

If y'all wanna go to the bar, drinks on us

Bet you never see my niggas pull up to the spot
I just signed so many checks my wrist about to pop
If you ever talk about me when I'm not around
Your girl'll probably tell me when I put it in her mouth
Put your wallet in your pocket, bitch you playing
Even when I wasn't on, I'm always paying
Went from hipsters, now it's models and these singers(on the low)
And my hair be growing like a fuckin' Saiyan
I popped a couple pills, I think that I'm Devante
I fuck a bitch from Lost and Found like every Monday
My jaw line so defined, I'm wildin' like I'm Gunplay
You see no white inside my eyes and it's a fun day
But when I'm workin', girl, I'm workin' for the millions
Girl, when I'm workin', I be workin' for them millions
Why your hair down, I ain't trickin', find another sucka
These bitches tryna make a livin', but

You know I been on now, then, and I'm next
Every year my year, you know I always wanna flex

If you wanna go to the bar, drinks on us

Say my, say my, say my, say my name
Stwitchin' bitches and I'm switchin' lanes
When they call last shot for alcohol
I just wanna take my last drink
I just wanna sip some clean purple
Hit the car lot and just made a purchase
I just realized that I am a star
Cruisin' my coupe up the boulevard
None of my pictures are watermarked
Got more water than the waterboy
I be on it draped me up, nigga
Yellow bone suck my nuts, nigga
She think it's chocolate but she call me papi
Papi Chulo, I'ma get it poppin'
Got some red bottoms on a hotty thotty
Put them heels and them nipples in new Cavalli
I just came in like a kamikaze
I just walk 'round like a zombie, daddy
I don't like bein' in paddy wagons
So no remorse, I'm about the fetti
Had a few horses come by the telly
Eating each other, they get some credit
Got commas on commas, I'm really ready
I'm really 'bout to pour up on a jet
I would never mention niggas names
Tell niggas nigga never did exist
You niggas never ever been a threat
These niggas never get enough attention
I just put the bitch on punishment
I've been hangin' where the money been
I don't know what type of love is this
Can you tell me where my dogs at?
Put a hollow in your ball cap
What type of nigga you call that?
When I hang up on you, never call back
I'm a money counter, count my own money

Been proven you ain't ever goin' up

Everything that I got I done came for
All the shit that you see I done slaved for
All the cars and the crib, yeah that's paid for
Need I say more
Spend so much money on clothes
Said fuck a store, making my own
I hope that you're rolling one up while you're singing along

Was forced to make records

Bed so wet when I eat you out

If they're not down, better keep 'em out

Take a puff of this motherfucking weed for now
Take a shot of this cognac, ease you out

Blame it on the weed
Blame it on the booze
Blame it on the night life, light's passin' you
Yeah just don't blame it on me
That you wanna come and party, with a nigga like me
'Cause I get it
You're built like a Goddess

Same clothes you ain't ready for your day shift
But you up you need money for ya' face lift
Lust over love is ya' mindset

Jaw clenching on some super-sized papers
And she bad in a head band
Escaping, her van is a Wonderland
And it's half-past six
Weed's nice 'cause time don't exist
And when the stars shine back to the crib
Superstar lines back at the crib
And we can test out the tables
We got some brand new tables
All glass and it's four feet wide
But it's a must to get us ten feet high
She give me sex in a handbag
I got her wetter than a wet nap
And no closed doors
So I listen to her moans echo
""I heard he do drugs now""
You heard wrong I been on them for a minute, we just never act a fool,
That's just how we fuckin' livin'
And when we act a fool, it's probably 'cause we mixed it
Yeah I'm always on that okey dokey
Them white boys know the deal, ain't no fuckin' phony
Big O know the deal, he the one who showed me
Watch me ride this fucking beat like he fuckin' told me
""Is that your girl, what's her fucking story?""
""She kinda bad but she ride it like a fucking pony""
I cut down on her man, be her fuckin' story
Yeah I'm talking 'bout you man, get to know me
Ain't no offense though, I promise you
If you a real man, dude, you gon' decide the truth
But I'm a nice dude with some nice dreams
And we could turn this to a nightmare, Elm Street
