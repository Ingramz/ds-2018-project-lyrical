Gabriel Ríos,"One mighty be one mighty song mighty bomb mighty make
Mean nation fall
And naughty one naughty song naughty girl dirty young
Man make you you wanna be for real

Now who's your father when your soul comes up abrupt
In it the seed like a diamond in the rough I am the sea
I got your face your luck so what the fuck I'll flip a
Channel and your life runs amok give me a reason to
Keep a blind eye wide open
I'll give you three words kinky holly token keeping
Your fingers broken
Keeping your dreams soaking
Keeping the truth way schizzy like dr seuss mama said
Mama told you be the best of 'em but you'll need
Hematomas like the rest of 'em mc not a mama's boy but
A mother's child with the pace of an angel running wild
Who told maria that her baby mes??as was to be blessed
With that kind of flow well that ain't me but with the
Same name though I'm turning rocks into bread as I roll
So

I'm turning rocks into bread as I roll

One mighty be one mighty song mighty bomb mighty make
Mean nation fall
And naughty one naughty song naughty girl dirty young
Man make you you wanna be for real

Pick a fella faced with the mirror I'm looking at you
Like I'm faced with the killer in me
Nonetheless I won't take a filler
I don't know would you consider
Not
Being fashion like the rest of ???em
Riding the world machine killing pedestrians or being
Fashionless
Well this is it time to fret ???cuz
If you're doing time with a face full of chemicals
Staring at the passing lines you're doing it my way on
The highway 'till my way went and caught a speed bump I
Like the way she call it fun she like the way me gonna
Get her stung we rob the train cuz we know we can burn
The black coal make a hot engine me kill my little
Indians through the tunnel to a distant land I???m lost
For words but me finding none

One mighty be one mighty song mighty bomb mighty make
Mean nation fall
And naughty one naughty song naughty girl dirty young
Man make ya you wanna be for real

Now everybody in the world machine
Let your head know what I mean
And let your legs stop running

With your body in the world machine
And your face showing what I mean",Mighty Be One,2007
Gabriel Romero,"En las Navidades todos tenemos recuerdos
Ay qué rico
Ay qué rico

Ay, maldita Navidad
Ya vienes con tu bullicio
Veo que todos se divierten
Para mí es un sacrificio

Hoy me embarca una nostalgia
Este año nadie me abraza
31 de diciembre
Cómo estarán en mi casa

Maldita navidad
Con tu luces y colores
Maldita navidad
Solo dejas sin sabores

Maldita navidad
Con tu luces y colores
Maldita navidad
Ay, maldita navidad

Ay maldita Navidad
Que me traes tantos recuerdos
Hace un año estaba aquí
Y este año se encuentra lejos

Ya van a sonar las 12
Oigo pitos y sirenas
Se oye el grito de Año Nuevo
Y más aumenta mi pena

Maldita navidad
Con tu luces y colores
Maldita navidad
Solo dejas sin sabores

Maldita navidad
Con tu luces y colores
Maldita navidad
Ay, maldita navidad",Maldita Navidad [Cumbia],1996

Dulce amor de mi vida

Gabriel Wilson,"The moon and stars they wept
The morning sun was dead
The Savior of the world was fallen
His body on the cross
His blood poured out for us
The weight of every curse upon Him

One final breath He gave
As Heaven looked away
The Son of God was laid in darkness
A battle in the grave
The war on death was waged
The power of hell forever broken

The ground began to shake
The stone was rolled away
His perfect love could not be overcome
Now death where is your sting
Our resurrected King has rendered you defeated

Forever, He is glorified
Forever, He is lifted high
Forever, He is risen
He is alive
He is alive

We sing hallelujah
We sing hallelujah
We sing hallelujah
The lamb has overcome

If there are words for Him, then I don't have them.
You see my brain has not yet reached the point.
Where it could form a thought that could adequately
describe the greatness of my God
And my lungs have not yet developed the ability to,
release a breathe with enough to agility to
breathe out the greatness of His love
And my voice, you see my voice is so inhibited
Restrained by human limits,
that's hard to even send the praise up
You see if there are words for Him,
I don't have them
My God, His grace is remarkable
Mercies are innumerable
Strength is impenetrable
He is honorable, accountable
Favorable, He's unsearchable yet knowable
Indefinable yet approachable
Indescribable yet personal
He is beyond comprehension
Further than imagination
Constant through generations
King of every nation
But if there are words for Him,
Then I don't have them.
You see my words are few
In trying to capture the one true God
Using my vocabulary would never do
But I use words as an expression,
An expression of worship to a Savior
A Savior who is both worthy and deserving of my praise
So I use words
My heart extols the Lord. Blesses His name forever.
He has won my heart, Captured my mind
And has bond them both together
He is defeated me in my rebellion
Conquered me in my sin
He has welcomed me into His presence
Completely invited me in
He has made Himself the object of my sight
Flooding me with mercies in the morning
Drowning me with grace in the night
But if there are words for Him,
Then I don't have them.
But what I do have is, good news
For my God knew that manmade words
Would never do, the words are just tools
That we use to point to the truth
So He sent His son Jesus Christ
As The Word, living proof
He is the image of the invisible God
The first born of all creation
For by Him all things were created
Giving nothingness formation
And by His words He sustains
In the power of His name
For He is before all things
And over all things He reigns
Holy is His name
So praise Him for His life
The way he preserved in strife
The humble son of God becoming the perfect sacrifice
Praise Him for His death (pause)
That He willingly stood in our place
That He lovingly endured the grave
That He battled our enemy
And on the third day rose in Victory
He is everything that was promised
Praised as the risen King
Lift your voice and sing
For one day He will return for us
And we will finally be united with our Savior
For eternity, eternity
So it's not just words that I proclaim
For my words point to The Word
And The Word has a name
Hope has a name
Joy has a name
Peace has a name
Love has a name
And that name is Jesus Christ
Praise His name forever",Forever (We Sing Hallelujah),2018
Gabriel Yared,"La fossa del leone
È ancora realtà
Uscirne è impossibile per noi
È uno slogan falsità
Il nostro caro angelo
Si ciba di radici e poi
Lui dorme nei cespugli sotto gli alberi
Ma schiavo non sarà mai

Gli specchi per le allodole
Inutilmente a terra balenano ormai
Come prostitute che nella notte vendono
Un gaio cesto di amore che amor non è mai
Paura e alienazione
E non quello che dici tu
Le rughe han troppi secoli oramai
Truccarle non si può più

Il nostro caro angelo
È giovane lo sai
Le reti il volo aperto gli precludono
Ma non rinuncia mai
Cattedrali oscurano
Le bianche ali bianche non sembran più
Ma le nostre aspirazioni il buio filtrano
Traccianti luminose gli additano il blu",Il Nostro Caro Angelo,

Gabriel Yared,"Heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
Heaven, I'm in heaven

And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing (Swinging) cheek to cheek
Oh I love to climb a mountain
And reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill (Boot) me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
Oh I love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek

But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
(Come on and) Dance with me
I want my arms around you
That (Those) charm about you
Will carry me through

(Right up) To heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing, out together dancing (Swinging)
Out together dancing cheek to cheek",Cheek to Cheek,2000
Gabriel Yared,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when",Where or When,2000
Gabriel Yared,"I want you
There's not a single thing about you that I'd change
I need you
You can go swimming round and round inside my brain

You're so much brighter
Than all the shops and city streets
You're a fighter
And that shows who's good to me
Like a fool
I still believe in you and me boy

[Chorus]
Hey you
Hey you
Don't waste your tears on me
Now think of love
It always gets you in the end

I'm sorry
I know I messed up quite a bit along the way
We learned things hard
and as soon as we forgot just how to play
But I wanna take ya
From all this grind and all this grief
Want to help ya
To be all that you can be
Chase it out
Your desire goes to me boy

[Chorus]

We fall and we flounder
Need something to ground ya
Took so long to find ya
But then when it clicked you just flew
(Will I ever sing our song again?)

[Chorus: x2]

Don't go and break your heart
I always told you from the start
I'll always be a traveling man
Now think of love
It always gets you in the end",St Pancras,2006

On the beach there 
People gather 
To meet the sunshine 

With open arms 
Reaching for heaven 
With open hearts 
and open minds

With sexy brown skin 
And haunting eyes 

Time keeps passing 
But no one cares 
Life for living 
Is the thing there 
Be yourself, be free

Gabriela Tanner,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2007
Gabriela Tanner,"You're nearer than my head is to my pillow
Nearer than the wind is to the willow
Dearer than the rain is to the earth below
Precious as the sun to the things that grow

You're nearer than the Ivy to the the wall is
Nearer than the winter to the fall is
Leave me but when you're away
You'll know you're nearer for I love you so

You're nearer for I love you so

And we fell in love

Right by a fire place
We shared our first embrace
And then inside my heart
I felt a fire start
It's gonna snow outside
The weather will be cold
But I'm gonna be warm (ho ho) this winter

Each time your lips touch mine
They taste like sparkling wine
I feel so warm and loved
Just 'cause I love you so
It's cozy in your arms
I'm yours to have and to hold
But I'm gonna be warm (ho ho) this winter

Sleigh riding down a mountain slide
Roasting popcorn, dancing 'til the dawn
That was how, a new love was born

It's just like make believe
Each night is New year's eve
Each day is Christmas day
You make me feel this way
It's gonna snow outside

When I took you back
Now we're here again and you're hurting me

Would your heart be burned?
What would you do babe?

I'm losing all my patience
I have nothing left

Gabrielle,"How could I know when I first met you
I was falling in love, never wanting to
Cause out of the blue you went my way
So lost for words, don't know what to say

It's a craving
Feels like in misbehaving
Feels like I'm going crazy
Only you can save me

I'm falling but I can't stop- can't stop
A little bit of you is never enough
Feels like I'm falling-falling
Feels like a new day's dawning

Try as I might I just can't hide
When you came you unlocked all I had inside
Like a piece of puzzle that slots in fine
You came in my life and you made it right
Just a feeling –feeling
It's not just my heart you're stealing
You know all there is to know
Cause you've seen inside my soul

I'm falling but I can't stop- can't stop
A little bit of you is never enough
Feels like I'm falling-falling
Feels like a new day's dawning

You're on my mind all the time, morning, noon and night
Without you, without love
I just can't survive no

It's a craving

Feels like I'm going crazy
Only you can save me

Though we're nit the perfect match 
I just can't explain

Should I stay
Should I go
Could I ever really stand to let you go? 
Can you now find the right words to say,
That maybe I'm getting in your way

I feel your warmth, got me wanting more, you've left the door half open
I'm in two minds to explore
But then again, am I being honest, being truthful to myself
Can I see my life without you
Could I be with someone else?

Gabrielle Aplin ,"Dreams are like angels
They keep bad at bay
Love is the light
Scaring darkness away
I'm so in love with you
Make love your goal

The power of love
A force from above
Cleaning my soul
Flame on burn desire
Love with tongues of fire
Purge the soul
Make love your goal

I'll protect you from the hooded claw
Keep the vampires from your door
When the chips are down I'll be around
With my undying death-defying love for you
Envy will hurt itself
Let yourself be beautiful
Sparkling light, flowers and pearls and pretty girls
Love is like an energy
Rushing in, rushing inside of me

The power of love
A force from above
Cleaning my soul
Flame on burn desire
Love with tongues of fire
Purge the soul
Make love your goal

This time we go sublime
Lovers entwined divine, divine
Love is danger, love is pleasure
Love is pure, the only treasure
I'm so in love with you
Make love your goal

Gabrielle Aplin ,"I'm leaving you
Not sure if that's what I should do
It hurts so bad
I'm wanting you but can't go back

Trying for find, find
That, oh, illusive piece of mind
Stuck here, somehow
Shrouded beneath my fear
And I, I don't need it

I'm walking down this world alone
And I figured all I'm thinking 'bout is you
Is you, my love

And my head is in a cloud of rain
And the world it seems so far away
And I'm just waiting for the droplets
The drops

So you left a mark
And I wear it proudly on my chest
Above my heart
To remind me that I feel the best

When I'm with you
And everything is effortless
You know it's true
My eyes are painted with regret
And I don't need it

'Cause I'm wondering down this road alone
And I figured all I'm thinking 'bout is you
Is you, my love

'Cause my head is in a cloud of rain
And the world it seems so far away
And I'm just waiting for you to sink into your skin

You are like the raindrops, the raindrops
Falling down on me

So you left a mark (you left a mark)

Here we are just the same

Gabrielle Aplin ,"I don’t have to mention that I saw you today
I shone the sun into your eyes
And you don’t always have to question why there’s pleasure and pain
'Cause there’s no truth for you to find

I’m drawing perfect circles 'round the life that we could share
And what is ours, is ours to keep
I know the thing you want the most, you hide it over there
Safe at the dark end of the street

When the devil's waiting
Down by the river calling out
I wanna be the one to light up the dark in you
And when the flood is over and all the love is pouring out
I wanna be the one to light up the dark in you
Light up the dark in you
Light up the dark in you
Oh, light up the dark in you

There’s so little I’m afraid of when it comes to an end
But I can’t leave you on your own
When your chaos turns to silence and your enemies your friends
I will run away the storm

Gabrielle Aplin ,"I wonder where my friend has gone 
I wonder where it all went wrong 
Was there something that I should have known?
I looked for him in Amsterdam 
I cried for him in Birmingham
Wondered if he’s ever coming home

Standing underneath the sky

But all my seeds are left unsown 
Better off if he was coming home

Gabrielle Goodman,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart

Should cause you such misery and pain

Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.

He was escorted to his chair, he saw Lola dancing there

And then the punches flew and chairs were smashed in two
There was blood and a single gun shot

But that was thirty years ago, when they used to have a show
Now it's a disco, but not for Lola
Still in dress she used to wear
Faded feathers in her hair
She sits there so refined, and drinks herself half-blind
She lost her youth and she lost her Tony
Now she's lost her mind

One thing lead to another we were young

Let nothing you dismay
Remember, Christ our Saviour
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power

When we were gone astray
O, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O, tidings of comfort and joy

In Bethlehem, in Israel
This blessed Babe was born
And laid within a manger
Upon this blessed morn
The which His Mother Mary

Did nothing take in scorn
O, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O, tidings of comfort and joy

From God our Heavenly Father
A blessed Angel came
And unto certain Shepherds
Brought tidings of the same
How that in Bethlehem was born

The Son of God by Name
O, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O, tidings of comfort and joy

""Fear not then,"" said the Angel
""Let nothing you affright
This day is born a Saviour
Of a pure Virgin bright

To free all those who trust in Him
From Satan's power and might""
O, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O, tidings of comfort and joy

The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind
And left their flocks a-feeding
In tempest, storm and wind
And went to Bethlehem straightway

The Son of God to find
O, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O, tidings of comfort and joy

And when they came to Bethlehem
Where our dear Saviour lay
They found Him in a manger
Where oxen feed on hay
His Mother Mary kneeling down

Unto the Lord, did pray
O, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O, tidings of comfort and joy

Now to the Lord, sing praises
All you within this place
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace

This holy tide of Christmas
All other doth deface
O, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O, tidings of comfort and joy

I must go on, I'm on this road of no returning
And though it burns me and it turns me into ashes

While I'm ticklin the clitoris by stickin it in soft
Just to trick em like I'm fickle
And its possible I'm fluff
But my dick is quick, to switch the brick
And give it to em rough
I'm a sick and twisted son of a bitch,
No disrespect to mom

Everyones know I'm on fire, shit
Its the reason why these white kids buy this
There's no more undead, it's nine lives
This punk-ass better go home or retire, with his mama
Cause its already too late to stop what I did
It hurts when I rip this mic' up, slap you upside
And call you my bitch, if you can't play the game fucker
Better stand outside it

You ain't never gonna have no fame again
Both you and your boyfriend in bed
Look at these faggots
How I beat them with just a touch of a pen
I could a smacked you hard,
But I tapped you bitch
And wrote this song instead
Like I said in story of a snitch
We are not best friends
I almost flew over the cuckoo's nest
I had to get shit off of my chest
You tried to push my ass
Off the edge ,

W, Tico el inmigrante 
A mi me encanta lo que tu hace 
El Gral Gadiel 
Ya-yandel 

Rodeado de tentacion (aja) 
y lleno el salon (yo no me olvido de ti) 
la vi en aquel rincón, (tu sabes q te vi) 
bailando se me acerco 
y la lleve a mi habitación 
pero no se de ella (de ella) 
desapareció (W) (de ella) (oye bebe) 
no se donde se metió 

(Ticoo) 
Con quien se acostara 
Quien el amor le hará 
Con quien se bañara 
Ella desapareció 
Con quien se acostara 
Quien el amor le hará (oye muñeca) 
Con quien se bañara 
Ella desapareció

Solo solito solitario rezando un rosario 
Para que no te olvides y vuelvas al vecindario (oye bebe) 
Y es que todos los dias yo miro el calendario 
Por ti busco mas que dios y cambio el vocabulario 
En rose de mi piel y la tuya hizo que la cosa fluya 
Nos fuimos callados sin hacer bulla 
Tu me diste pasion y yo solte la cabulla 
Mami regresa no dejes que yo me destrulla 

Demasiada tentación 
y lleno el salón 
la vi en aquel rincón, 
bailando se me acerco (yo no lo creía) 
y la lleve a mi habitación 
pero no se de ella 
desapareció 
pero no se de ella 
no se donde se metió 

(Yandel) 
Con quien se acostara 
Quien el amor le hará 
Con quien se bañara 
Ella desaparecio 
Con quien se acostara (oye bebe) 
Quien el amor le hara 
Con quien se bañara 
Ella desaparecio 

Eee no la he vuelto a ver (no se de ella) 
Buscandote buscandote no te encontre (estoy deseperado por ti) 
Y yo yo no se que hacer 
Te me fuiste de las manos 
Que hago yo para volverte a ver 

(WY Record) 

Y me mata solo con pensar con quien tu estaras 
Y con quien lo haras con lo haras (Tico) 
Y me mata solo con pensar con quien tu estaras (el inmigrante) 
Y con quien lo haras con lo haras 

(Gadiel) 

Yo se que tu te acuerdas con besos te daba cuerda 
Y ahora tira la mala para que en el juego pierda 
Mi cuarto se convirtio en una celda 
Tus labios hacen que de ti yo dependa 
Y conciente (Totalmente Desorientado ) 
algo raro en mi mente 
la casa se siente diferente 
Ha cambiado mi ambiente (Que hacer ) 
si no vuelves 
Mi destrucción es Inminente 

Rodeado de tentación 
y lleno el salón 
la vi en aquel rincón, (ella es preciosa) 
bailando se me acerco (aja) 
y la lleve a mi habitación 
pero no se de ella 
desaparecio 
pero no se de ella 
no se donde se metio 

Con quien se acostara 
Quien el amor le hara 
Con quien se bañara 
Ella desaparecio 
Con quien se acostara 
Quien el amor le hara 
Con quien se bañara (Yandel) 
Ella desaparecio 

Quizá se escuche raro, quizá es imposible 
Pero quisiera tener una maquina de tiempo 
Y poder llegar a la misma hora, al mismo lugar, 
y sentir las mismas emociones que sentimos tu y yo

Yo espero que no termines borracha en el inodoro 
Yo no deterioro yo valgo mas que el oro 
Otro nivel de música se te meten por los poros 
Y no hay socorro nadie se meta 
Te noto confundida leona yo no soy un cachorro

Compórtate posesiva cuando de la iniciativa 
Se manda un trago se activa 
Tú eres la que me motiva 
Se que besarte es la clave pa' transformarte agresiva 
Huelo su cuerpo encima y una descarga agresiva 
Y el deseo de los 2 aumenta si la tiento ella me tienta 
Yo aquí con la furia de una tormenta 
Ella sedienta como pistola revienta

Después tirar pa' arriba con la fuerza de un tsunami 
Tu eres la presa yo ando de safari

Gadjet,"They're talking about you
As if all hell broke loose
They don't even know you
They're just lighting your fuse
They're talking about you
Like revenge is their tool
You're everybody's fool
Can't win, you'll just lose

When I walk through LA, and it's smelling like death
I done murdered all these MCs, there ain't none left
Their bodies are fucking rotting, decomposing to flesh
One man responsible for all of this, just guess
Same one you can't keep up out your mouth, oh yes
The same one they keep asking about in the press
Who gives a shit? Like a magazine means success?
Make everybody fucking wonder what I'm gon' say next
Kerrang don't know a thing about rock unless
You focus on these pussy, emo, fucking pop projects
Then talk some shit about and diss the homie Deuce, no less?
Well, I can rock in, rock it like a rocket launcher to chest
So ticky-tock-tickety-tock, watch the clock and stress
Run up in your label, flip the table on the execs
Tell 'em all to kiss my ass when I jump on the desk
And show 'em what a fucking promise is instead of a threat

Mirror, mirror, answer me this
Will I pay for all of my sins?
If it is, let judgment begin
I'll keep marching on until then
Mirror, mirror, give me one wish
Give me strength so I don't give in
Heaven and hell, wherever I stand
I'll keep marching on till the end

Like revenge is their tool
You're everybody's fool
Can't win, you'll just lose!

Who the hell wants to fuck with us? Nobody, they're in the dust
'Cause we left 'em whenever we stepped inside of the tour bus
Onto the next city with fans screaming for us
Vibing with hands up, sing along to the chorus
Hard to ignore us, that big of a fucking fuss
So much when they say our name, nobody can stay hush
Pretty girls with they face flush, red from when they blush
No need to have make-up whenever they face us
We give 'em a straight rush like we do to these fake fucks
Who can't entertain us, mainly 'cause they suck
I'd wish they'd just break up, these groups who just can't cut
It out and go about it with me without getting ate up
I'm eating these rappers alive, filling my plate up
Became cannibalized like I'm at a buffet, stuffed
Still feeling my face up 'cause the hunger just stays stuck
It won't go away 'cause my tapeworm is duct taped up

Mirror, mirror, answer me this
Will I pay for all of my sins?
If it is, let judgment begin
I'll keep marching on until then
Mirror, mirror, give me one wish
Give me strength so I don't give in

They're just lighting your fuse
They're talking about you
Like revenge is their tool
You're everybody's fool
Can't win, you'll just lose!

Is it because I wouldn't follow you to my self-destruction?
Or maybe it was because these words have so much more contradiction
This is my only addiction, only way I revenge
It's like you're my crucifixion, the sicker I get
I get more and more vicious, so don't get me upset
Kids are paying to listen, you don't wanna accept
Then you're another victim of greatness and success
Cut the head off the chicken, he keeps on making sentences
He's so far from dead, bitches, he hopes that...

They're talking about you

Et nous les fils on se perd dans les guerres et les batailles
Ma mémoire se paralyse, et ma peine se cautérise
Des machettes qu’on aiguise, de tous nos morts dans nos églises
J’oublie pas que l’exil c’est comme une porte d’exit
Je crie mes origines car c’est comme ça que j’existe
Trop de larmes ont coulé, beaucoup de textes j’ai gribouillé
Maintenant je regarde le soleil sur le lac d’une plage de Kibuye
Petite sœur tu prends la ligne pour les milles collines
Embrasses bien les cousins, embrasses bien les cousines
Et puis embrasses aussi la grand-mère à Butare
Dis lui que chaque année que je passe loin d’elle me rend plus taré
Et si tu prends le bus Vénus pour Bujumbura
Fais gaffe à toi, aux embuscades à Bugarama
Embrasse papa qui est resté au pays
Dis lui qu’en France je ne grandis plus, dis lui que je vieillis

L’AFRANCE est l’asile, l’absence et l’exil
Souffrance mais par pudeur faut pas que je l’exhibe
Je vis loin des mes rêves, de mes espoirs, de mes espérances
C’est ça qui me tue d’être écartelé entre Afrique et France",A-France,2013

Y'a le name droping, les mails en copie
La France qui cotise, la famille qu’on se coltine
Les frères qui cantinent, les quelques centimes
La physique quantique, les prix qu’on estime
Les gens que l’on tue, les fêtes confettis
Les ordres de Poutine, le plutonium sushi
La guerre, le sida, Darfour et Biafra
Et puis dans tout ça l’opinion du quidam
Bistrot, troquet, la merde, le réel
Quand j’enlève la virgule la merde est réelle
Objectifs, chiffres, rafles, écoles
ADN, fichage, charters qui décollent
Ralliement, connivence, collusion, dissension

Remonter le moral, diaspora tous en choral
Tous àl de Buja Centre ou pourquoi pas Buja rural

Y’a des grands bwana à Kiriri et des masikinis
Y’a du français, du kirundi, un peu de swahili
Tu peux acheter à l’unité Supermatch, Ambassy

A la Douma c’est pas détails, c’est coup d’théâtre et vendetta
Attends-toi à des attentats c’est coup d’état pour coup d’éclat
Ecoutez bien si vous pensiez que tout est bien que tout est beau
Votre dédain déteint le ciel et je deviens corbeau
Esclave du paradis, paraît que c’est beau sous les tropiques
Des dominés sans dominants c’est un équilibre estropié
Trop près de mon trépas, mon pe-ra devient trépied

Que je prêterais ma voix aux crève-la-faim et traîne-savates

Gaël Faye,"Un cimetière s’est formé entre NACO et moustiquaire
La névralgie du robinet c’est le bruit de ma rivière
Le vent danse dans les rideaux, le grelot de la tringle
Dehors grésille la radio de quelques voix que je distingue
Des oiseaux dans la volière, le kasuku fait du boucan
Si le frigo ne bourdonne guère c’est qu’il y a coupure de courant
Rayon de soleil en suspension, filaments de poussière dans l’air
Qui traversent le salon pour zébrer d’ombre et de lumière

A l’heure de la sieste, j’apprivoise le silence
Petit Prince d’ennui modeste entre mouton et somnolence
Dans la vieille maison de briques, de la Belgique sous les tropiques
A l’heure des choses statiques j’invente, je me fabrique
Petit garçon, genoux cagneux, il fait trop chaud sous mes cheveux
Nos jeux sont souvent poussiéreux sous un soleil de plomb teigneux
Les excursions chevaleresques, les fous rires, les pactes de sang
Copain ça compte, copain ça reste, copain c’est d’abord un mot d’enfant

Dans le ventre de la maison, les adultes en digestion
Et moi coincé dans mes questions, prisonnier d’une toile au plafond
Capharnaüm de la déco, les masques, les trophées, les geckos
Je joue au GI Joe dans le crâne d’un hippo
A l’intérieur il fait frais, le carrelage une mosaïque
Sur lequel mes voitures jouets dessinent des routes périphériques
Torpeur d’après-midi sous un ciel bleu paradis
Parade levée dans le taillis, 14 Juillet chez les fourmis

Dans mon jardin d’Eden y’a des serpents à tous les angles
Et faute de pomme Golden, je trahis Dieu avec des mangues
Toute l’année dans mon jardin je vis à ciel ouvert
Sous le Ficus je suis un nain, arbre temple, arbre univers
La citronnelle borde la rigole entourant la maison
La pluie s’abstient ou dégringole, les pizzas n’ont que deux saisons
Mais quand les trombes s’abattent, elles tambourinent le toit de tôle
Les bananiers deviennent frégates et l’eau cascade sur mes épaules

Une planche à voile sur le toit d’un combi Volkswagen
Des photos jaunies, le petit chien s’appelle Amstel
Pas de 4 heures, pas de goûter, pas de pâte à tartiner
Pas de chaîne, pas de télé, y’a que l’aquarium à regarder
Pas de parfum que l’on humecte, j’écris des lettres à une maman
A une absence, apprendre à faire avec , c’était apprendre à faire sans
C’était ma vie, c’était la vie, c’était le train-train quotidien
C’était l’ennui des après-midi sans fin",L' Ennui Des Après-Midi Sans Fin,2013
Gaël Faye,"Fils du Hip Hop, il a grandi sous Reagan
Il sautait sur des matelas éventrés dans des terrains vagues
Lui, c’est le rap, un gamin de la rue
La musique sur la peau et le style d’une verrue
Il est né sous Jim Corbeau, surmontant les épreuves
Depuis que Betty Shabazz et Coretta Scott sont devenues veuves
Plus d’Etat, plus de social, le DJ scratch dans l’abîme
Quand son frère Graffiti bariole l’épiderme des villes
Langston Hughes est mort, Harlem Renaissance zéro
Ça break et ça beat box autour d’un baril brasero
Des B-Boys aux Block parties, apprendre à faire sans rien
Le rap a inventé une musique sans musicien
Sans solfège, naît dans le ghetto le petit frère mal aimé
Les leaders ne parlent plus, ils se mettent à rimer
« Put your hands up in the air! » personne ne sera blessé
Un Bic, un beat, la verve du verbe sur MPC
Puis ça fume des blunts, des zedou sur des SP12
Et ça pille les breaks de James Brown, d’Otis Redding
De Funkadelic, de George Clinton, d’Ohio Players
Le son sale, crasseux, poussiéreux provient de ses samplers
C’est les pleurs de la rue sur des crissements de disques
Break it down scratch! Emmerde la progression harmonique
De la bouche des égouts est sorti un mouvement
Qui s’invite dans les cocktails du bourgeois condescendant
Des Hood à Hollywood, du béton au bifton
L’industrie musicale resserre sa proie comme un python
Première tension, puis première contradiction
Choisir entre Révolution ou sociale ascension
Mais le rap a plus d’une rime sous le bomber
Schizophrène sur MTV ça fight the power
Les postillons recouvrent le monde, la mode devient mouvement
Une lame de fond au verbe acide acerbe et véhément
L’instinct de guerre, de cracher, de vivre libre
Insoumis en dehors des schémas et des normes établis
Y’a des morts, des oxymores, des coups de balles verbales
Des ruptures grammaticales sur des caisses claires et cymbales
Ca s’emballe, sans label ça devient plus hardcore
Le réel est sans appel dans le couloir de la mort
Quand le chômage augmente les rappeurs deviennent précis
Quand les médias nous mentent les MC’s font les récits
Chaque block, chaque quartier, chaque secteur possède ses rappeurs
Le système est un arbre et le rap est sécateur

Puis la langue affûtée s’est mise à baisser le futal
On lui a joué de la flûte, elle a kiffé le récital
Elle s’est mise des dents en or, des chaînes d’esclaves autour du cou
C’est normal que quand tu crèches dehors tu veuilles sortir du trou
La tête dans un keffieh, du cauchemar au rêve américain
Le rap boit du Moët dans une Bentley en chantant des refrains
En chantant des couplets de 8 mesures sur des sujets lissés
Ça fait dans la friperie, le téléphone, les produits dérivés
Les gens de la classe moyenne ignorant le ghetto
Ont fait le succès du peu-ra, ils veulent les gestes et puis l’argot
Ils veulent s’encanailler: la drogue, les flingues, les biatchs sur la table
S’en foutent de la culture et du message d’Afrika Bambaataa
Le rap a fait ses classes loin du Hip Hop
Renonce à l’éthique de Chuck D, veut la vie de Donald Trump
Le vilain petit canard s’est transformé en cocotte aux œufs d’or
Le bon vin, les dollars ont remplacé le bruit et les odeurs
Mais loin des cotations de ce système l’esprit reste vivace
Tant qu’y’a la merde dans le quartier, y’aura des 16 en dédicace
Donc ferme ta porte et tes fenêtres pour que le Rap ne rentre pas
Il fera une Block Party dans ton jardin pour que tu ne dormes pas!
Donc ferme ta porte et tes fenêtres pour que le Rap ne rentre pas
Il fera une Block Party dans ton jardin pour que tu ne dormes pas!

Il fera une Block Party dans ton jardin pour que tu ne dormes pas!",Fils Du Hip-Hop,2013
Gaël Faye,"J'ai vécu sur la grève, les yeux dans mes rêves
A écouter le vague à l'âme que les vents soulèvent
Je pensais m'être échoué à jamais dans l'estuaire
Quand cette femme m'a dit : ""viens, viens prendre la mer""
Alors nos mains d'amoureux ont sculpté une pirogue
Au début le ciel est bleu, tu pars et tu vogues
On a glissé sur une mer d'huile, un miroir onduleux
Et bientôt au fil de l'eau, le ciel devint nébuleux
Y'a la mer en furie, puis les tempêtes que l'on brave
Et de la poupe à la proue, on s'accroche, on en bave
L'équipage se renforce, apprend avec l'âge
Que l'océan est sauvage lorsqu'on quitte ses rivages
Puis un jour on s'amarre au dessus d'un champ de lumières
Les amants qui s'aimèrent d'un scintillement lunaire
Plongent ensemble dans l'azur aux ressacs éphémères
Et remontent à la surface une perle solaire

Oh, Isimbi, Isimbi
Oh, Isimbi, Isimbi
Oh, le noyau de mon fruit de vie
Isimbi, Isimbi

La plus belle perle du monde à m'en brûler les prunelles
Je le jure sur ma vie que la mienne sera pour elle
Six heures trente, six décembre, c'est un ange qui descend
Dans ma vie, dans cette chambre, je ne sais plus ce que je ressens
Un sentiment d'embrasement bien plus fort que l'amour
Je fus Dieu un instant, c'était peut-être pour toujours
C'est la chair de ma chair, le sang de mon sang
Et j'en perds mes repères à être père d'un enfant
Révolution accomplie! Mon Grand Soir le voici
Parce que l'on meurt tous un jour, je riposte par la vie
Isimbi, c'est son nom, ""la perle éternelle""
Ou ""la neige des volcans"" sur le toit de ma Terre mère
A la mère de ma fève, à ses talents d'orfèvres
La rosée de sa fleur est la perle de ma fièvre
Parce que l'on était ""elle et moi"", parce que l'on s'aimait à l'étroit
Parce qu'il fallait être deux pour faire trois

Oh, Isimbi, Isimbi
Oh, Isimbi, Isimbi
Oh, le noyau de mon fruit de vie
Isimbi, Isimbi

Petite perle nacrée, si le ciel me soustrait
Je serais toujours près, près de toi en secret
Petite perle, tu descends d'une lignée de poètes
D'idéalistes en tout genre, de chercheurs de conquêtes
Lève les yeux, une aïeule brille pour toi
Suzana comme un nom au reflet d'autrefois
IBUKA, souviens-toi, le prélude à ta vie
Suzana c'est le nom d'un immortel atavisme
Petite fille pardonne-nous pour ce monde dérisoire
Pour tes épaules bien trop frêles face au poids de l'Histoire
Petite princesse au royaume de mes mots
A tous les fleuves qui t'irriguent, à tes rivières indigo
A nos droits de douter, à nos rages d'exister
A nos chants de clarté que je t'offre en bouquet
Petite plante céleste aux yeux de rubis
Bienvenue ma princesse, bienvenue dans la vie

Oh, Isimbi, Isimbi
Oh, Isimbi, Isimbi
Oh, le noyau de mon fruit de vie

A côté, les autres, elles ont des tronches de gorilles
Y'a les femmes et y'a la mienne ; allégorie hors-catégorie
C'est pas la peine d'essayer de la guer-dra
Elle en a rien à faire du vermicelle derrière ta guette-bra
Accro, je suis à cran, c'est la muse de mes écrits
Elle a transpercé l'écran ; c'est un diamant dans son écrin
Une femme, une vraie de vraie ; regarde comme elle est gaulée
J'aime pas la voir partir, mais j'adore la voir s'en aller
Je l'entoure de mes bras, ma beauté, ma seule princesse
Jusqu'au bout du monde je me battrai pour que jamais l'étreinte cesse
Regarde sa cambrure, ses seins qui foutent le faya
Je l'épouserai Baie de tous les Saints, Salvador de Bahia
De tous les dons du Ciel, c'est le cadeau du plus offrant
Ma femme elle est trop belle, regarde sa peau couleur safran
Ma femme elle déclenche les ambulances et leurs sirènes
Si le monde était beauté, tu vivrais sous son règne
Son parfum est une ivresse qui te rend saoul l'ami
Elle est classe comme une négresse et dangereuse comme un tsunami
Indépendante est ma femme, l'intelligence incarnée
C'est la reine de Saba, c'est Cléopâtre réincarnée
Ma femme c'est de la foudre, l'orage, les cataclysmes
C'est ta foi, ta religion, l'abjuration des hommes d'église
C'est la belle-fille, que je présente à ma Mama
J'en suis sûr que c'est la bonne, dans les artères coule le magma
Je lui ferai des gosses, des bambins, une floppée de mômes
Parce qu'il y'a la guerre sur la Terre, on va repeupler le monde
Ma femme j'en ferai des disques, des films et des bouquins
C'est la goutte de sang dans l'océan qui rend fous les requins

C'est pas des révolvers dans ses yeux verts y'a des .22 Long Rifle
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, elle est simple, une beauté qui s'ignore
C'est une femme en or, à ses côtés, je deviens seigneur
Cette femme elle fout en l'air, c'est le requiem du rêve
Elixir du nectar des dieux, j'ai la cuillère aux lèvres
Elle est belle comme le pêché, une séquelle, un vrai scandale
Je suis le prêtre avec les clefs du temple, et je deviens vandale
Cette femme c'est pas de la lette-zou ou de la lollipop
C'est du pe-ra Brooklyn zoo, du Rock'n'roll et du Hip-hop
Je succombe à sa démarche, cette langueur qui se pavane
Avec les cheveux dans le soleil, elle danse, rue de la Havane
On a mis le cap vers cette plage du Cap-Vert

J'aurais tout fait jusqu'à m'en étouffer
J'aurais tout jeté, mes refrains, mes couplets, écoutez
Le studio je l'aurais fermé, le micro je l'aurais coupé, j'ai douté
J'avance sur des chemins cahoteux
Venez goûter mes vérités dans les bouquins de Jean-Paul Gouteux
Dégoûté d'avoir une vie non méritée
Regardez je suis brillant mais je reflète l'obscurité
Identité de porcelaine, j'ai fait ce morceau-là
Pour assembler le puzzle d'un humain morcelé
Jamais à ma place, des frontières j'effaçais
Mais frais comme Damas mon sentiment de race
Blanc et noir, quand le sang dans mes veines se détraque
Je suis debout aux confluents du fleuve et du lac
Mon métissage c'est pas l'avenir de l'humanité
Mon métissage, c'est de la boue en vérité

Quand deux fleuves se rencontrent
Ils n’en forment plus qu’un et par fusion nos cultures deviennent indistinctes
Elles s’imbriquent et s’encastrent pour ne former qu’un bloc d’humanité debout sur un socle
Et quand deux fleuves se rencontrent

Un beau bordel chromosomique, demande à Benetton, mais laisse béton
On aura beau se mélanger on restera des cons
La race humaine un clébard marquant son territoire
Gueulant l'appartenance à son département, ni blanc ni noir
J'étais en recherche chromatique
Mais le métis n'a pas sa place dans un monde dichotomique
Donc c'est dit c'est dit je suis noir dans ce pays
C'est pas moi qui l'ai voulu je l'ai vu dans le regard d'autrui
C'est comme ça, laisse-les chanter nos mélanges de couleur
Laisse-les parler de diversité, de France black, blanc, beur
On serait tous métis, le reste c'est de la bêtise
Voilà que j'ironise sur ce que les artisans de la paix disent
J'ai pas de frontière, j'ai pas de race
Je suis chez moi partout sans être jamais à ma vraie place
Mon seul pays c'est moi, mon seul amour c'est toi
Toi l'autre différent mais au fond si proche de moi

Métissé, prisé ou méprisé, j'ai dû m'adapter
Ballotté entre deux cultures ça commence à dater
Adolescent, complexé toujours en quête d'identité
Y avait le blanc y avait le noir, j'étais celui qui hésitait
J'évitais de choisir à l'âge où l'on veut faire partie
Endossant la faute de tous les camps je devenais martyr
On m'a dit 50/50 mais j'y ai pas trouvé mon compte
Car le glacier fusionne à l'océan à la saison des fontes
Je soupire, ça transpire, la connerie, ça s'empire
Quand on m'appelle le sang-mêlé, sous-entendu, issu de sang pur
Je vois bien ces questions ne nous mènent à rien
L'humanité est colorée donc, soyons daltoniens
Je vous parle d'amour, vu qu'il expire dans un mouroir
Je suis mulâtre, ébène albâtre voulant abattre le miroir
Et comme l'Afrique est en instance de sang entre ciel et Terre
J'ai le cul entre deux chaises, j'ai décidé de m'asseoir par terre!

Quand deux fleuves se rencontrent
Ils n’en forment plus qu’un et par fusion nos cultures deviennent indistinctes
Elles s’imbriquent et s’encastrent pour ne former qu’un bloc d’humanité debout sur un socle
Et quand deux fleuves se rencontrent

Une feuille et un stylo apaisent mes délires d'insomniaque
Loin dans mon exil, petit pays d'Afrique des Grands Lacs
Remémorer ma vie naguère avant la guerre
Trimant pour me rappeler mes sensations sans rapatriement
Petit pays je t'envoie cette carte postale
Ma rose, mon pétale, mon cristal, ma terre natale
Ça fait longtemps les jardins de bougainvilliers
Souvenirs renfermés dans la poussière d'un bouquin plié
Sous le soleil, les toits de tôles scintillent
Les paysans défrichent la terre en mettant l'feu sur des brindilles
Voyez mon existence avait bien commencé
J'aimerais recommencer depuis l'début, mais tu sais comment c'est
Et nous voilà perdus dans les rues de Saint-Denis
Avant qu'on soit séniles on ira vivre à Gisenyi
On fera trembler le sol comme les grondements de nos volcans

Réputation recouverte d'un linceul
Petit pays, pendant trois mois, tout l'monde t'a laissé seul
J'avoue j'ai plaidé coupable de vous haïr
Quand tous les projecteurs étaient tournés vers le Zaïre
Il fallait reconstruire mon p'tit pays sur des ossements
Des fosses communes et puis nos cauchemars incessants
Petit pays : te faire sourire sera ma rédemption
Je t'offrirai ma vie, à commencer par cette chanson
L'écriture m'a soigné quand je partais en vrille
Seulement laisse-moi pleurer quand arrivera ce maudit mois d'avril
Tu m'as appris le pardon pour que je fasse peau neuve
Petit pays dans l'ombre le diable continue ses manœuvres

Un soir d'amertume, entre le suicide et le meurtre
J'ai gribouillé ces quelques phrases de la pointe neutre de mon feutre
J'ai passé l'âge des pamphlets quand on s'encanaille
J'connais qu'l'amour et la crainte que celui-ci s'en aille
J'ai rêvé trop longtemps d'silence et d'aurore boréale
À force d'être trop sage j'me suis pendu avec mon auréole
J'ai gribouillé des textes pour m'expliquer mes peines
Bujumbura, t'es ma luciole dans mon errance européenne
Je suis né y'a longtemps un mois d'août
Et depuis dans ma tête c'est tous les jours la saison des doutes
Je me navre et je cherche un havre de paix
Quand l'Afrique se transforme en cadavre
Les époques ça meurt comme les amours
Man j'ai plus de sommeil et je veille comme un zamu
Laissez-moi vivre, parole de misanthrope

Gaël Faye,"Il voulait quitter la routine, celle de son père
Qui étiole les rêves au large des paupières
Enfourcher son vélo, repartir à zéro
Petit gone de Lyon aux oripeaux d’évasion
Partir! Non pas pour voir de nouveaux lieux
Mais voyager, pour ouvrir de nouveaux yeux
Orpailleurs d’horizons, y’a que des hôtels mille étoiles
Pour les clochards célestes qui ne s’embarrassent pas d’un toit
Petit croissant au beurre, petit français qui flâne
Il lisait Kerouac et chantait Bob Dylan
Il est parti vivre à la dure
Découvrir l'humain, épouser la nature
Et de pays en pays, il pédale, il pédale
Et de guerre en maladie, il pédale, il pédale
C’est usé par la route d’un voyage de cinq ans
Qu’au bord de son doute il rencontre un piment

Elle était belle comme un piment, une robe du dimanche
Elle rêvait d’un charmant, d’un amour qui s’épanche
Elle vivait dans un quartier populaire
Elle avait fui son pays, les pogroms et la guerre
Et la terre des ancêtres était un vaste mouroir
Et ce pays d’accueil, un sombre miroir
Qui lui renvoyait cette image de paria
Une réfugiée HCR qui glisse aux parois
Et qui veut s’envoler, partir loin d’ici
Là où le ciel ne dit ni Hutu ni Tutsi
Et puis les murs de sa chambre au vert papier peint
Recouvert de poster de « Salut les Copains »
Etait son antre où elle rêvait d’être hippie
D’écouter du Jimi et de vivre à Paris
En attendant le bus sous un arbre en fleur
Son destin croise celui d’un croissant au beurre

Elle et il aux Sources du Nil
Un vent souffle l’idylle sur les branches d’un nid
D’un croissant beurré et d’un piment swahili
Qui s’étaient donc jurés de s’aimer pour la vie
Malgré toutes les routes crevées d’ornières
Dans le panache de poussières des saisons blanches et sèches
Malgré le doute et les pluies diluviennes
Malgré les torrents de boue qui s’écoulent dans la plaine
Le croissant, le piment ont le goût d’un enfant
Puis de un puis de deux, carpe diem d’un instant
Aucune écluse ne peut contenir les rêves
Que le cœur transporte et pour lesquels il crève

Ma bien-aimée, j'écris cette lettre avec l'espoir que tu puisses me lire
Les hommes sont bêtes, l'Afrique est belle, fais pas l'erreur de la haïr
Avec toi je voulais vieillir sur ces collines, dans cette maison
Mais l'horizon s'arrête ici, je suis venu chanter mon oraison
Il m'enlève le galbe de tes hanches, le suave de tes lèvres
Sans trêve, « Umugwaneza », lumière de tous mes rêves
Je dois quitter ce port, mon âme quitte son corps
Mais mon amour je resterai toujours à deux encablures de ton cœur
Je vais partir dans les minutes qui suivent
Ma peine est lourde, j'espère que tu recevras cette missive
J'écris ces vers d'espoirs, des fleuves de tourterelles
Des tours de rêves, de brèves trêves de querelles

Mais le voilà motivé pour travailler pendant 10 ans

Un diplôme BAC+5 et ses dix années d'expériences
Parce que lui au fond il n'en veut pas de cette vie de bureau
De ce métro boulot dodo juste pour payer ses impôts
Parce que lui depuis tout petit il voulait faire du hors piste

Open space, activités internationales

A la machine à café les sourires lui cachent tant de choses

Qui aura sa promo? Qui sera licencié?
De combien sera le montant du bonus de fin d'année?

Et tous les soirs chez les gens bien la lumière bleutée des télés
Le temps des désillusions, il a du bide, il est vautré
A-t-il respecté les rêves de l'enfant qu'il était?
Mais cette fois c'en est trop, sortir du cercle infernal
Parce qu'il crève d'ennui, il sautera hors de son bocal
Il va déployer ses ailes, ne pas avoir peur d'essayer

Je suis à coté de mes pompes, moi j’aime la gratte et les ratures
Et l’aventure, un jour se lève, un jour nouveau
Un jour d’adolescence ou sur un banc j’ai rêvé de ""Revo""

Me fatigue, et je le vois, mes textes n’ont plus d’intrigues
Les révoltes sont diluées, nuages de lait dans un café
Tu ne signes pas des autographes quand t’as l’avenir autodafé

Soon as you feel the ground start shaking 
All your sleeping doubts start waking

Genocide, lost the breath of life under God's feet 
Genocide of the angels 
Even murdered instruments, trumpets, banjos 
But I still hear singing 
Mixed between the crying 
Sirens ringing 
Buried my whole tribe 
I'm crying, thinking 
Rescue us from Zion 
God ain't blinking 
Bodies, how they pile on 
Clock ain't ticking 
On face had a smile on 
Plot just thickened 
Courage of a lion, nine-life kitten 
Wandering through iron bars, once prison

Où le monde doit s'éteindre pour qu'on ouvre les yeux 
Et le vin à la bouche, et le coeur sous le pieu 
On fera vœu de renaître de quelques cendres de feu 
J'effeuille les corolles de ce qu'on veut de la vie 
Un peu de vent sur la peau, les caresses d'une fille 
S'envolaient tout là-haut pour gratter l'équinoxe

Rêve d'un pays d'Cocagne où l'on m'attendrait là-bas

",The Leaving of Liverpool,1998
Gaelic Storm,"Well in the merry month of June, 
From my home I started,?Left the girls of Tuam, 
Nearly broken hearted,?Saluted father dear, 
Kissed me darlin' mother,?Drank a pint of beer, 
My grief and tears to smother,?Then off to reap the corn, 
And leave where I was born,?I cut a stout blackthorn, 
To banish ghost and goblin,?In a brand new pair of brogues, 
Rattling o'er the bogs,?And frightened all the dogs,
On the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three, four five,?Hunt the hare and turn her down 
The rocky road and all the ways to Dublin,?Whack, fol lol de ra.

Now in Mullingar that night, 
I rested limbs so weary,?Started by daylight, 
Next mornin' bright and early,?Took a drop of the pure, 
To keep me heart from sinkin',?Now that's the Paddy's cure, 
Whene'er he's on for drinking.?To see the lasses smile, 
Laughing all the while,?At my curious style, 
'Twould set your heart a bubblin'.?Asked me was I was hired, 
Wages I required,?'Til I was almost tired, 
Of the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three, four five,?Hunt the hare and turn her down 
The rocky road and all the ways to Dublin,?Whack, fol lol de ra.

Now in Dublin next arrived, 
I thought it such a pity,?To be so soon deprived, 
A view of that fine city.?Decide to take a stroll, 
All among the quality,?Bundle it was stole, 
And in a neat locality;?Something crossed my mind, 
When I looked behind;?No bundle could I find, 
Upon my stick a wobblin'.?Enquirin' for the rogue, 
Said me Connacht brogue,?Wasn't much in vogue, 
On the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three, four five,?Hunt the hare and turn her?Down the rocky road?And all the ways to Dublin,?Whack-fol-lol-de-ra.

And from there I got away, 
My spirit was never failin'?Landed on the quay 
Just as the ship was sailin';?Captain at me roared, 
Said that no room had he,?When I jumped aboard, 
A cabin found for Paddy,?Down among the pigs 
Played some funny rigs,?Danced some hearty jigs, 
The water round me bubblin',?Off to Holyhead, 
I wished meself was dead,?Better far instead, 
On the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three, four five,?Hunt the hare and turn her?Down the rocky road?And all the ways to Dublin,?Whack, fol lol de ra.

The boys of Liverpool, 
When we safely landed,?Called meself a fool; 
I could no longer stand it;?Blood began to boil, 
Temper I was losin',?Poor old Erin's isle 
They began abusin',?""Hurrah me soul,"" says I, 
My shillelagh fly;?Some Galway boys were by, 
Saw I was a hobblin',?Then with a loud hurray, 
They joined in the affray.?Soon we quickly cleared the way, 
For the rocky road to Dublin.

Word got around that Johnny Tarr was no pretender,
From Clare to here they'd lock up the beer when Johnny went on a bender
Down at Dickey Mack's, the Rising Sun, or at the Swan

It was nine in the morning on a cold rainy night,
Johnny rolled into the Castle Bar, looking to get tight
He had money in his pocket, he had whiskey in his eye,
He said: Get up off your asses and set up the glasses, I'm drinking this place dry!

Now all the serious boozers, they were soon broken hearted
When Johnny finished off six and he was only getting started
Guzzling down the pints, knockin' em back like candy,
He was lookin' alright to be drinkin' all night, then Nora brought out the Brandy! Johnny Tarr!

When it made no impression he started his session with Murphy's Millenium Brew
He was waiting for a pint when his face turned green
Jesus, Johnny fell down after only fifteen!

You could have heard a pin drop, then the crowd let out a roar
It took five cork women to lift Johnny off the floor!

but it's not what you're thinkin' it wasn't the drinkin' this man died of thirst

For when a man is tired he can sit down and rest
He can beg for his dinner, he's nothing else to do
When he comes around the corner with his old rig-a-doo

And I met a little flaxy-haired girl one day
'Well good morning' little flaxy-haired girl,' did I say
'Well good mornin' little beggarman, how do you do,
With your rags and your bags and your old rig-a-doo'
I'll buy a pair of leggings and a collar and a tie
And a nice young lady I will fetch by and by
I'll buy a pair of goggles and I'll color them blue
And an old fashioned lady I will make of her too

I've got the sky
I've got the road
I've got the sky...
The world is my home

I'm a little beggarman, I am a beggar man
And I slept way down, in a barn at Caurabawn
A wet night came on and I slept 'till the dawn
With holes in the roof and the rain coming through
And the rats and the cats, they were playing peek-a-boo
When who should awaken but the woman of the house
With her white spotty apron and her calico blouse
She began to frighten and I said ""Boo!
Ah, don't be afraid ma'am it's only Johnny Dhu""

Die di die di diddle diddle dumb
Di die di die di diddle diddle dum
Diddle dumb di diddle diddle dum

I've got the sky
I've got the road
I've got the sky...
The world is my home

And it's over the fields with my pack on my back
And over the fields with my great heavy sack
With the holes in my shoes and my toes peeping through
Singing skinny-me-rink a doodle o for old Johnny Dhu
I must be going to bed for it's getting late at night
When the fire's all raked and out goes the light
Now you've heard the story of me old rig-a-doo
It's goodnight and God be with you from old Johnny Dhu",Beggarman: The Beggarman/Johnny Mgreevy's Favorite,2003
Gaelic Storm,"Come single belle and beau, unto me pay attention
Don't ever fall in love, it's the devil's own invention
Once I fell in love with a lady so bewitching
Miss Henrietta Bell out of Captain Kelly's kitchen

With me toora loora la, toora loora laddie
Toora loora la, toora loora laddie
With me toora loora la, toora loora laddie
Toora loora la, toora loora laddie

At the age of seventeen I was 'prenticed to a grocer
Not far from Stephen's Green, where Miss Henry used to go sir
Her manners were so fine, she set my heart a-twitchin'
She invited me to a courtin' in the kitchen

With me toora loora la, toora loora laddie
Toora loora la, toora loora laddie
With me toora loora la, toora loora laddie
Toora loora la, toora loora laddie

Next Sunday being the day, that we went to have a flare-up
I dressed me self quite gay and I frizzed and oiled me hair up
The captain had no wife, he had gone on fishin'
So we kicked up high life to hooley in the kitchen

With me toora loora la, toora loora laddie
Toora loora la, toora loora laddie
With me toora loora la, toora loora laddie
Toora loora la, toora loora laddie

She slipped up to her room, I says good Lord, oh lady
She came back down the stairs, wearin' nothin' but her nightie
With her arms around me waist, she slyly hinted marriage
When to the door in haste, came captain Kelly's carriage

With me toora loora la, toora loora laddie
Toora loora la, toora loora laddie
With me toora loora la, toora loora laddie
Toora loora la, toora loora laddie

When the captain came downstairs, do we see me situation
In spite of all me prayers, I was marched off to the station
For me they set no bail, but to get to the home I was itchin'
And I had to tell the tailor, for I came in to the kitchen

Well, I swore she did invite me, though she gave a flat denial
For assault, they did indict me and I was sent for trial
She swore I robbed the house in spite of all me screechin'
And I got six months hard, for me courtin' in the kitchen

With me toora loora la, toora loora laddie
Toora loora la, toora loora laddie
With me toora loora la, toora loora laddie
Toora loora la, toora loora laddie

With me toora loora la, toora loora laddie
Toora loora la, toora loora laddie
With me toora loora la, toora loora laddie
Toora loora la, toora loora laddie

With me toora loora la, toora loora laddie
Toora loora la, toora loora laddie
Toora loora la, toora loora laddie
Toora loora la, toora loora laddie

With me toora loora la, toora loora laddie
Toora loora la, toora loora laddie
With me toora loora la, toora loora laddie
Toora loora la, toora loora laddie

Gaelic Storm,"I'll tell me ma when I go home
The boys won't leave the girls alone
They pull my hair, they stole me comb
But that's alright when i go home
She is handsome, she is prety
She's the belle of belfast city
She is a courting. One. Two. Three
Please won't you tell me who is she?

Now Albert Mooney says he loves her
All the boys are fighting for her
Knocking on the door and ringing on the bell
Saying:""Oh my true love, are you well?""
Down she comes as white as snow
With rings on her fingers and bells on her toes
Old Johnny Murphy says she'll die
If she doesn't get the fellow with the roving eye

Let the wind and the rain and the hail come high
And the snow come shoveling from the sky
She's as nice as apple pie
She'll get her own lad by and by!
When she gets a lad of her own
She won't tell her ma when she comes home

Take a little bit of my love

I'll show you what I've been thinking of
If you're willing
I'll take you to the garden of love
An' I just might surprise you babe

Round the world
And I'll find a million lovers

And I can't let you go

Took it and ran away
Just had to let you know

Just dropped a line to say
That I lost all control

You blew my mind away

And in my heart
I cannot complain
No one competes
Longing for this pace to stop

Took it and ran away
Is when you come for my heart

Gaetano Valli Trio,"Listen to the melody entrancing
Blending in a soft and sweet refrain
As around the floor, dear, we are dancing
Swaying to a fascinating strain
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low 
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
 
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
Ev'ry little movement of the band
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms

Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender

When I was young, and I was always changing my mind
I could be anyone I wanted, travel great travels
I had everything I needed
In a small room I had big ideas
And now I'm trying to hold on to those big ideas

Oh, I know... 
Those days are through, but I still think of you, 
Philadelphia

And all the music... you know, it was my protection
I didn't need no one, 'cause I found affection
In the six strings of an old guitar and my radio
I moved to the beat of the hot streets
Where the people were singing and dancing and waving
Their hands in the air
While my Mama, she shook her head, and she said ""Lord
Have mercy""
 
And once again... The good ol' days are gone; ain't it
Funny how we still carry on, Philadelphia

I had to leave; knew I had to look to other places
To try out my big ideas in front of all these faces
And hope that the lessons and beauty of being young
Someone with the imagination of a child
Could bring a smile to all these faces
From a small room, Room 222, I've seen it happen many
Times before
And I know, I know, I know, I know I'll see it happen
Again
If I can just keep... 

Remembering that those special things... and the big
Ideas 
And all the lovely, lovely music will always be a part

A rich beautiful thing of all the talents, a cross between 
A fantasy of the bedroom and a saint 
You were just a back street girl 
Hustling and fighting 
Scratching and biting 
High flying, adored, did you believe in your wildest moments 
All this would be yours, that you'd become the lady of them all? 
Were there stars in your eyes when you crawled in at night 
From the bars, from the sidewalks
From the gutter theatrical? 
Don't look down, it's a long, long way to fall
High flying, adored, what happens now, where do you go from here? 
For someone on top of the world, the view is not exactly clear 
A shame you did it all at twenty-six
There are no mysteries now 
Nothing can thrill you 
No-one fulfill you 
High flying, adored, I hope you come to terms with boredom 
So famous, so easily, so soon, is not the wisest thing to be
You won't care if they love you, it's been done before 
You'll despair if they hate you 
You'll be drained of all energy 
All the young who've made it would agree 

High flying, adored, that's good to hear, but unimportant 
My story's quite usual, local girl makes good, weds famous man

The choice was mine, and mine completely
I could have any prize that I desired
I could burn with the splendor of the brightest fire

And a year was forever and a day
So what use could fifty, sixty, seventy be?

And how I lived, how they shone
But how soon the lights were gone

Gail Barteli,"Tell me before I waltz out of your life
Before turning my back on the past
Forgive my impertinent behavior
But how long do you think this pantomime can last?

Tell me before I ride off in the sunset, there's one thing I never got clear
How can you claim you're a savior
When those who oppose you are stepped on
Or cut up, or simply disappear?

Tell me before you get onto your bus
Before joining the forgotten brigade
How can one person like me, say
Alter the time-honored way the game is played?

Tell me before you get onto your high horse
Just what you expect me to do, I don't care what the Bourgeoisie say
I'm not in business for them but to give all my descamisados
A magical moment or two

There is evil, ever around
Fundamental system of government, quite incidental
So what are my chances of honest advances? I'd say low
Better to win by admitting my sin than to lose with a halo

Tell me before I seek worthier pastures and thereby restore self-esteem
How can you be so short-sighted
To look never further than this week or next week
Than have no impossible dream?

Allow me before you slink off to the sidelines
I'll pay your fair gift three cheers but first tell me who'd be delighted
To witness me the top world's greatest problems
From war to pollution, no hope of solution
Even if I live for one hundred years

There is evil, ever around
Fundamental system of government, quite incidental
So go, if you're able to somewhere unstable and stay there
Whip up your hate in some tottering state
But not here, dear, is that clear, dear?

Oh, what I'd give for a hundred years
But the physical interferes, everyday more, Oh my Creator
What is the good of the strongest heart
In a body that's falling apart? A serious flaw, I hope You know that",Waltz for Eva and Che [From Evita],1996

Once in a while
Please, promise me you'll try

When you find
That once again you long
To take your heart back and be free
If you ever find a moment
Spare a thought for me

We never said our love was evergreen
Or as unchanging as the sea
But if you can still remember
Stop and think of me

Think of all the things we've shared and seen
Don't think about the way things might have been

Think of me waking
Silent and resigned
Imagine me

There will never be a day

Goodnight and thank you Senor Jabon
We are grateful you found her a spot on the sound radio

Our nation's leaders are a feeble crew
There's only twenty of them anyway
What is twenty next to millions who
Are looking to you?

Keeping out of everybody's way

They always take some swallowing
Sometimes it's very difficult to keep momentum

Gail Barteli,"People of Europe! I send you the Rainbow of Argentina!

Spain has fallen to the charms of Evita
She can do what she likes--it doesn't matter much
She's the New World Madonna with the golden touch
She filled a bull-ring--forty-five thousand seater
But if you're prettier than General Franco
That's not hard

Franco's reign in Spain should see out the forties
So you've just acquired an ally who
Looks as secure in his job as you
More important, current political thought is
Your wife's a phenomenal asset
Your trump card

Let's hear it for the Rainbow Tour
It's been an incredible success
We weren't quite sure, we had a few doubts


Would Evita win through?

But the answer is yes!

There you are, I told you so
Makes no difference where we go
The whole world over--just the same
You should have heard them call our name
And who would underestimate the actress now?

I'm not underestimating you--just do the same thing in
Italy please

Now I don't like to spoil a wonderful story
But the news from Rome is not so good
She hasn't gone down like we thought she would
Italy's unconvinced by Argentine glory
They equate Peron with Mussolini
Can't think why

Did you here that?
They called me a whore!
They actually called me a whore!

But Signora Peron
It's an easy mistake
I'm still called an admiral
yet I gave up the sea long ago

Things aren't all that bad she met with the Pope
She got a Papal decoration and a kindly word
So even if the crowds gave our lady the bird

The Argentine/Italy axis does have some hope
She still made a fabulous impact
Caught the eye

Let's here it for the Rainbow Tour
It's been an incredible success
We weren't quite sure, we had a few doubts


Would Evita win through?

But the answer is

A qualified

Yes!

Eva started well, no question, in France
Shining like the sun through the post-war haze
A beautiful reminder of the carefree days
She nearly captured the French, she sure had the chance
But she suddenly seemed to lose interest
She looked tired

Tired? Eva tired?

Face the facts, the Rainbow's starting to fade
I don't think she'll make it to England now

It wasn't on the schedule anyhow

You'd better get out the flags and fix a parade
Some kind of coming home triumph
Is required

In a cold and lonesome box car
A dyin hobo lay

His pal sat there before him
With a low and drooping head
Listening to the last words
His dying buddy said

Goodbye old pardner hobo
I hate to say goodbye
But I hear my train a comin
& I know shes getting nigh

Gonna tell that old conductor
Just when I'm gonna stop
Where the little stream of water
Comes tumblin down the rock

We rode the rocks together
We rambled all around
In every kind of weather
We slept out on the ground

Oh pardner don't you miss that train
That always makes a stop
Where the little stream of water
Comes tumblin down the rock

Would you tell my girl from Danville
That she need not worry a tall
I'm a goin to that country
Where I won't have to work at all

No I wll not have to work there
Or never change my socks

Comes tumblin down the rocks

When I must faint and die;
My body to the dust return
And there fergotten lie.
Let persecution rage around
And Antichrist appear;
My silent dust beneath the ground;
There's no disturbance there.

To call poor sinners to repent
And seek their Savior dear.
My brother preachers, boldly speak
And stand on Zion's wall.
Confirm the drunk, confirm the weak
And after sinners call.

My loving wife, my bosom friend,
The object of my love,
The time's been sweet l've spent with you,
My sweet and harmless dove,
My little children near my heart
My warm affections know.
From each the path will I attend.
O from them can I go?!

O God, a father to them be
And keep them from all harm,
That they may love and worship Thee
And dwell upon Thy charm.
How often you have looked fer me
And often seen me come.
But now I must depart from thee
And nevermore return.

Neither lament nor mourn;
Fer I will with my Jesus be
And dwell upon his charm.

And there forgotten lie.

Let Antichrist appear;

There's no disturbance there.

And wandered in despair;

And stand on Zion's wall.

And nature seems to bind,
It grieves me sorely to depart
And leave you here behind.

Let this not grieve your heart,
For you will shortly come to me

Wounded by the master of deceit
Groping in the darkness
Haunted by the years of past defeat

But then I see You standing near me, Lord
Shining with compassion in Your eyes
I pray, Jesus, shine down on me
Let Your love shine through me in the night

Lead me, Lord, I'll follow
Anywhere You open up the door
Let Your word speak to me
Show me what I've never seen before

He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!

Let freedom echo through the lonely streets where prisons have no key

And He meant for us to all be free and whole
When my Lord bought freedom with the blood of His redemption
His cross stamped pardon on my very soul

That iron bars and heavy chains can never hold us captive

Gaither Vocal Band,"The gates and doors were barred and all the windows fastened down,
I spent the night in sleeplessness and rose at every sound,
Half in hopeless sorrow half in fear the day,
Would find the soldiers crashing through to drag us all away.
Then just before the sunrise I heard something at the wall,
The gate began to rattle and a voice began to call,
I hurried to the window and looked down to the street,
Expecting swords and torches and the sound of soldiers feet,

There was no one there but Mary so I went down to let her in,
John stood there beside me as she told us were she'd been,
She said they moved him in the night and none of us knows where,
The stones been rolled away and now his body isn't there.
We both ran toward the garden then John ran on ahead,
We found the stone and the empty tomb just the way that Mary said,
But the winding sheet they wrapped him in was just an empty shell,
And how or where they'd taken him was more than I could tell.

Something strange had happened there but what I did not know,
John believed a miracle but I just turned to go,
Circumstance and speculation couldn't lift me very high,
Cause I'd seen them crucify him and then I'd watched him die,
Back inside the house again all the guilt and anguish came,
Everything I'd promised him just added to my shame,
But at last it came to choices I denied I knew his name,
Even If he was alive it wouldn't be the same.

But suddenly the air was filled with a strange and sweet perfume,
Light that came from everywhere drove shadows from the room,
Jesus stood before me with his arms held open wide,
And I fell down on my knees and clung to him and cried,
He raised me to my feet and as I looked into his eyes,
Love was shining out from him like sunlight from the sky,
Guilt and my confusion disappeared in sweet release,
And every fear I'd ever had just melted into peace.

Gal Costa,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender;
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory evergreen.

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore
An orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying

When they begin the beguine.
To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are swearing to love forever,

And promising never, never to part.
What moments divine, what rapture serene,
'Til clouds came along to disperse
The joy we had tasted,

And now, when I hear people curse
The chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean.
So don't let them begin the beguine!

Let the love that was once a fire
Remain an remember;
Let it sleep like a dead desire
I only remember

When they begin the beguine.
Oh, yes, let them begin the beguine,
Make them play!
'Til the stars that we met before

Return above you;
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""
And we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the beguine.",Begin the Beguine,1986
Gal Costa,"Sinto quando alguém te interessa
Mesmo quando finges que não vês
Se desapareces numa festa, eu já sei

Que podemos ser felizes
Mas tudo que eu sei
Não dá pra disfarçar
Dessa vez doeu demais
Amanhã será jamais
Onde a gente vai tem uns amigos
Que você precisa visitar
Se não sou feliz, são só ciúmes
Nada mais

Na intenção do nome de outro alguém

Você diz, tudo bem

Gente de todas as cores
Faça este favor pra mim

Quem souber tocar, que toque

Saiba que alguém rasteja

De comer fotografia
Eu disse cheese

Me ofereceu um drinque
Me chamou de anjo azul
Minha visão
Foi desde então ficando flou

Me mandava às vezes
Uma rosa e um poema
Foco de luz
Eu, feito uma gema
Me desmilingüindo toda
Ao som do blues

Abusou do scotch
Disse que meu corpo
Era só dele aquela noite
Eu disse please
Xale no decote
Disparei com as faces
Rubras e febris

E voltou
No derradeiro show
Com dez poemas e um buquê
Eu disse adeus
Já vou com os meus
Numa turnê

Só me amava como esposa
Não como star

Me queimou as fotos
Me beijou no altar

Cantando a Florisbela
A Florisbela
Convidei-o a voltar pra casa em minha companhia
Exibiu-me um sorriso de ironia
E desapareceu no turbilhão da galeria
Não estava nada bom
O meu pedaço na verdade 
Estava bem mamado
Bem chumbado, atravessado
Foi por aí cambaleando 
Se acabando num cordão
Com um reco-reco na mão
Mais tarde o encontrei num café do rapa
Do Largo da Lapa

Bebendo o quinto copo de cachaça
Voltou as sete horas da manhã
Mas só na quarta-feira 
Cantando a Jardineira
Ô, a Jardineira
Me pediu ainda zonzo um copo d'água com bicarbonato
Meu pedaço estava ruim de fato
Pois caiu da cama e não tirou nem o sapato
E roncou uma semana 
Despertou mal-humorado 
Quis brigar comigo
Que perigo!
Mas não ligo 
O meu pedaço me domina
Me fascina
Ele é o ""tal""

Sky, so vast is the sky, with far away clouds just wandering by,
Where do they go? oh I don't know, don't know;
Wind that speaks to the leaves, telling stories that no one believes,
Stories of love belong to you and to me.

Oh, dindi, if I only had words I would say all the beautiful
Things that I see when you're with me, oh my dindi.
Oh dindi, like the song of the wind in the trees, that's how my heart is
Singing dindi, happy dindi, when you're with me.

I love you more each day, yes I do, yes I do;
I'd let you go away, if you take me with you.

Don't you know, dindi, I'd be running and searching for you like a river that
Can't find the sea, that would be me without you, my dindi.
Can't find the sea that would be me without you dindi.

Like a river that can't find the sea, that would be me without you, my dindi.

Estou morrendo de saudade

A morena vai sambar
Seu corpo todo balançar

Rio de sol, de céu, de mar
Dentro de mais uns minutos
Estaremos no Galeão

Seu corpo todo balançar

Aperte o cinto, vamos chegar
Água brilhando, olha a pista chegando
E vamos nós aterrar

Gal Costa,"Vai minha tristeza
E diz a ela 
Que sem ela não pode ser
Diz-lhe numa prece
Que ela regresse 
Por que eu não posso mais sofrer
Chega de saudade
A realidade
É que sem ela não há paz
Não há beleza
É só tristeza
E a melancolia 
Que não sai de mim
Não sai de mim, não sai

Mas se ela voltar, se ela voltar
Que coisa linda, que coisa louca
Pois há menos peixinhos a nadar no mar
Do que os beijinhos 
Que eu darei na sua boca

Dentro dos meus braços
Os abraços 
Hão de ser milhões de abraços
Apertado assim
Colado assim, calado assim

Vem de mansinho a brisa e me diz

It's the colorful plaza

While in my eyes
Go looking for flying saucers in the sky

Oh Sunday, Monday, autumn passes by me
And people hurry on so peacefully
A group aproaches a policeman
He seems so pleased to please them
It's good at least to live and I agree
He seems so pleased at least 
And It's so good to live in peace 
And Sunday, Monday years and I agree

Go looking for flying saucers in the sky

I just happen to be here and It's ok

Em busca da madrugada

Pra que ela acorde alegre com o dia
Oferecendo beijos de amor

De todas as cores

Tem ninhos de passarinhos

Toda a noite é a mesma noite
A vida é tão estreita
Nada de novo ao luar
Todo mundo quer saber

Gal Costa,"Eu quero a sorte de um amor tranquilo
Com sabor de fruta mordida
Nós na batida, no embalo da rede
Matando a sede na saliva
Ser teu pão, ser tua comida
Todo amor que houver nessa vida
E algum trocado pra dar garantia

E ser artista no nosso convívio
Pelo inferno e céu de todo dia
Pra poesia que a gente não vive
Transformar o tédio em melodia
Ser teu pão, ser tua comida
Todo amor que houver nessa vida
E algum veneno antimonotonia

E se eu achar a sua fonte escondida
Te alcance em cheio o mel e a ferida
E o corpo inteiro feito um furacão
Boca, nuca, mão, e a tua mente, não
Ser teu pão, ser tua comida
Todo amor que houver nessa vida
E algum remédio que me dê alegria",Anos Dourados,1999

Shall I be the clown for you Bonita 
I will be anything you say

Gal Costa,"Vai minha tristeza
E diz a ela 
Que sem ela não pode ser
Diz-lhe numa prece
Que ela regresse 
Por que eu não posso mais sofrer
Chega de saudade
A realidade
É que sem ela não há paz
Não há beleza
É só tristeza
E a melancolia 
Que não sai de mim
Não sai de mim, não sai

Mas se ela voltar, se ela voltar
Que coisa linda, que coisa louca
Pois há menos peixinhos a nadar no mar
Do que os beijinhos 
Que eu darei na sua boca

Dentro dos meus braços
Os abraços 
Hão de ser milhões de abraços
Apertado assim
Colado assim, calado assim
Abraços e beijinhos 
E carinhos sem ter fim
Que é pra acabar com esse negócio
De você viver sem mim
Não quero mais esse negócio
De você viver sem mim",Chega de Saudade,1999
Gal Costa,"Eu nunca sonhei com você
Nunca fui ao cinema
Não gosto de samba
Não vou a Ipanema

Desliguei, foi engano
Seu nome eu não sei
Esqueci no piano
As bobagens de amor
Que eu iria dizer
É, Ligia, Ligia

Eu nunca quis tê-la ao meu lado
Num fim de semana
Um chope gelado
Em Copacabana
Andar pela praia até o Leblon
E quando eu me apaixonei
Não passou de ilusão

O seu nome rasguei
Fiz um samba-canção
Das mentiras de amor
Que aprendi com você
É, Ligia, Ligia
E quando você me envolver

Nos seus braços serenos
Eu vou me render
Mas seus olhos morenos
Me metem mais medo
Que um raio de sol

Podia comprar-te um vestido
E mais um vidrinho de cheiro

Tenho pensado tanto na vida
Volta bandida mata essa dor
Volta pra casa, fica comigo
Eu te perdoo com raiva e amor
Chega mais perto, moço bonito
Chega mais perto meu raio de sol
A minha casa é um escuro deserto
Mas com você ela é cheia de sol
Molha a tua boca na minha boca
A tua boca é meu doce é meu sal

Mas quem sou eu nesta vida tão louca?
Mais um palhaço no teu carnaval
Casa de sombra vida de monge
Quanta cachaça na minha dor
Volta pra casa, fica comigo
Vem que eu te espero tremendo de amor

Em noite sem lua, pulei a cancela
Cai do cavalo, perdi Gabriela
Oh lua de cera, oh lua singela
Lua feiticeira cadê Gabriela?

Gal Costa,"You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by

And when two lovers woo
They still say I love you
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by

Moonlight and love songs never out of date
Hearts full of passion, jealousy and hate
Woman needs man
And man must have his mate
That no one can deny

It’s still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by

Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

Fico a te focar;
Mergulho fundo no teu olhar.
Mesmo quando o gozo já vem,
Eu me afundo bem ali e além...

A te adorar, dourar, dourar...
Te ter, me dar a tudo que és,
Da cabeça até os pés.

Exagera alguma coisa,
Faz da dupla muito mais.

Pelo calor da palmada,
Move a moça e o rapaz.

Ele corteja a preferida;
Amor a gente é muito mais...

O samba é roda sem medida,
A chuva agora é colorida,
E a harmonia se refaz.

Levam qualquer incerteza;
É um passo à frente, um passo atrás.

A volta do rio

E ser artista no nosso convívio
Pelo inferno e céu de todo dia
Pra poesia que a gente não vive

Te alcance em cheio o mel e a ferida

A tarde linda que não quer se pôr
Dançam as ilhas sobre o mar
Sua cartilha tem o A de que cor?

O que está acontecendo?
O mundo está ao contrário e ninguém reparou
O que está acontecendo?
Eu estava em paz quando você chegou

E são dois cílios em pleno ar
Atrás do filho vem o pai e o avô
Como um gatilho sem disparar
Que invade mais um lugar
Onde eu não vou

O que você está fazendo?
Milhões de vasos, nenhuma flor
Oh uô uô, o que você está fazendo?
Um relicário imenso deste amor

Corre a lua porque longe vai?
Sobe o dia tão vertical
O horizonte anuncia com o seu vitral
Que eu trocaria a eternidade por esta noite

Porque está amanhecendo?
Peço o contrario, ver o sol se pôr oh uô uô uô
Porque está amanhecendo?
Se não vou beijar seus lábios quando você se for

Quem nesse mundo faz o que há durar
Pura semente dura o futuro amor
Eu sou a chuva pra você secar
Pelo zunido das suas asas você me falou

E o que você está dizendo?
Milhões de frases, nenhuma cor, ôô
O que você está dizendo? Uh huh
Um relicário imenso deste amor

O que você está dizendo?
O que você está fazendo?
Por que que está fazendo assim?

Gala,"I know complaining doesn't help
'Cause what has been won't be again
And as I'm walking down the street
I see a child glance back at me

These crazy clocks dictate our lives
I'm gonna cut time with a knife
If all this ends, there's nothing more
Then where will my memories go?

[Chorus x 2]
And now it's ten o'clock
And another day has gone
And I know it's gone forever
Have you ever loved me? 
Never

One day you'll hear the unspoken words
I've sung for you in my silent world
I turned away; you didn't know
I lived for you; my love still grows

[Chorus]

And now it's ten o'clock (and now it's ten o'clock)
And another day has gone (another day has gone)
And I know it's gone forever (I know it's gone forever)
Have you ever loved me? 
Never (another day has gone)

You see empty space in children's eyes
But what you see is ancient and wise
If all this ends, there's nothing more
Then where will my memories go?

[Chorus x 2]

And now it's ten o'clock (and now it's ten o'clock)
And another day has gone (another day has gone)

Never (another day has gone)

Inside in silence I'm dead,

I know that my fear will be gone
And so I'm waiting for the morning to come

Come, come, stay with me

Judging by the look on a face
I confuse, always do, and abuse, don't mean to
Then excuse, always do, in the end, I lose

Acting on an impulse of pain
Spinning on a perilous plane
With a word I confuse, I hurt and abuse
Worry, then excuse, in the end I lose
Everything I do hurts someone

My life

I bleed the same blood, still I offend
I walk the same path, I lose a friend
Everything I do hurts someone

Galactic Cowboys,"I tried to call you but you were gone
Way too busy stickin' the labels on
Deciding who will swim in the talent pool- and what is cool

Cultivating more popularity
Overly concerned with what not to be
Trendy little fashions that please the eye- you'll televise

Whatcha gonna do tomorrow?
Whatcha gonna do when it's over?
I just don't fit into the clique
You're so hip you make me sick
Whatcha gonna do tomorrow?

Pay no attention to quality
Churning out the pap like a factory
The only standard is how ya feel- not what is real

Totally convinced that the sound was dead
Creating categories that fit the times, condition minds

You move 'em in and move 'em out like they were cattle
Burn a brand into their hide
With all apologies to L.A. and Seattle
Cloning is artistic suicide",Tomorrow,1997
Galactic Cowboys,"Zero was a hotshot a dozen years ago
So opinionated he'd give 'em all a show
Heart attached to his sleeve by silverplated cords
Million dollar moonbeams and billion dollar words

Lately there's been nothing to say
Seems like there's nothing to say
Why is there nothing to say?

No one paid attention to what he had to say
Doubt and apprehension, his loss was no one's gain
So he set his sights on money all that mattered
Was the green
'Til all of the excitement had turned to apathy

Lately there's been nothing to say
Caught a glimpse of heaven like needles in the eye
More than undeserving it begs the question, why?

Put a gun against his head,
Pulled my trigger,now he's dead,

If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on,carry on,as if nothing really matters

Body's aching all the time,

Lady Mercy won't be home tonight.

You don't waste no time at all
Don't hear the bell but you answer the call
It comes to you as to us all
We're just waiting
For the hammer to fall

Oh every night, and every day
A little piece of you is falling away
But lift your face, the Western Way
Build your muscles as your body decays.

You don't waste no time at all
Don't hear the bell but you answer the call
It comes to you as to us all
We're just waiting
For the hammer to fall

Tow the line and play their game
Let the anaesthetic cover it all
Till one day they call your name
You know it's time for the Hammer to fall.

Rich or poor or famous for
Your truth it's all the same
Lock your door but rain is pouring
Through your window pane
Baby now your struggle's all vain.

For we who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the Mushroom Cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
We just wanna scream it louder and louder

You don't waste no time at all
Don't hear the bell but you answer the call
It comes to you as to us all
We're just waiting
For the hammer to fall

What the hell are we fighting for?
Just surrender and it won't hurt at all
You just got time to say your prayers
While you're waiting for the Hammer to fall.",Hammer to Fall,2003
Galileo,"And you're rushing headlong you've got a new goal
And you're rushing headlong out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping no there's nothin'
You can do about it
There's nothin' you can do
No there's nothin' you can do about it
No there's nothin' you can, nothin' you can
Nothin' you can do about it
And you're rushing headlong you've got a new goal
And you're rushing headlong out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping no there's nothin'
You can do about it
He used to be a man with a stick in his hand
Hoop diddy diddy, hoop diddy do
She used to be a woman with a hot dog stand
Hoop diddy diddy, hoop diddy do
Now you've got soup in the laundry bag
Now you've got strings, you're gonna lose your rag
You're gettin' in a fight
Then it ain't so groovy when you're screaming in the night
Let me out of this cheap `B' movie
Headlong down the highway and you're rushing
Headlong out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping and you can't stop rockin'
And there's nothin' you can, nothin' you can
Nothin' you can do about it
When a red hot man meets a white hot lady
Hoop diddy diddy, hoop diddy do
Soon the fire starts a raging gets 'em more than half crazy
They start freaking everyway you turn
You can't start walking cause your feet got burned
It ain't no time to figure wrong from right
Cause reason's out the window
Better hold on tight, you're rushin'.",Headlong,2003
Galileo,"Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you, no man ask for
Under pressure that burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets

It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming, ""Let me out!""
Tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets

Chippin' around, kick my brains 'round the floor
These are the days, it never rains but it pours
People on streets, people on streets

It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming, ""Let me out!""
Tomorrow gets me higher, higher, higher.
Pressure on people, people on streets

Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn
Why, why, why?

Love

Insanity laughs under pressure we're cracking
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, 
Give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?

'Cause love's such an old-fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves
Under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure",Under Pressure,2003
