Badfinger,"Guess I got what I deserve
Kept you waiting there, too long my love
All that time, without a word
Didn't know you'd think, that I'd forget, or I'd regret
The special love I have for you, my Baby Blue

All the days became so long
Did you really think, I'd do you wrong
Dixie, when I let you go
Thought you'd realize, that I would know, I would show
The special love I have for you, my Baby Blue

What can I do, what can I say
Except that I want you by my side
How can I show, you, show me a way
Don't you know, the times I tried
Guess that's all I have to say
Except the feeling just gets stronger, everyday
Just one thing, before I go

Take good care, baby, let me know, let it grow
The special love, you have for me, my Dixie dear",Baby Blue [Live],2005

For all the ladies in the world

Just wanna do something special

And the girls, don't forget them girls

Caribbean ladies
Parisian ladies
Bolivian ladies
Namibian ladies

Eastern Indochinian ladies
Republic of Dominican ladies
Amphibian ladies

Outta sights, amazing ladies
Late night, hard working ladies
Erudite, brainy ladies

Oh, you sexy hermaphrodite lady-man-ladies
With your sexy lady bits
And your sexy man bits too
Even you must be into you

All the ladies in the world
I wanna get next to you
Show you some gratitude
By making love to you
It's the least we can do

If every soldier in the world
Put down his weapon and picked up a woman
What a peaceful world this world would be
Redheads not warheads, blond's not bombs
We're talking about brunettes, not fighter jets

Oh, it's got to be sweet 16's not M-16's
When will the government realize
It's got to be funky sexy ladies?

I have a vision and all I can see
Is all of you with a all of me
In a world of peace and harmony
Where every lady gets a little piece of Bret-Y

I've been to Paris, Wellington and Amsterdam
And a wham-bam, Merci, Danke, thank 'a you ma'm
I don't care if you're ugly or you're skanky, or you're small
Just wanna do a little something special for you all

Just wanna do something special
For all the ladies in the world
All the old ladies, all the clean ladies

Just wanna do something special
For all the ladies in the world

And the girls, don't forget them girls

Badi Assad,"I'm a fountain of blood
In the shape of a girl
You're the bird on the brim
Hypnotised by the Whirl
Drink me, make me feel real
Wet your beak in the stream
Game we're playing is life
Love is a two way dream
Leave me now, return tonight
Tide will show you the way
If you forget my name
You will go astray
Like a killer whale
Trapped in a bay
I'm a path of cinders
Burning under your feet
You're the one who walks me
I'm your one way street
I'm a whisper in water
Secret for you to hear
You are the one who grows distant
When I beckon you near
Leave me now, return tonight
The tide will show you the way
If you forget my name
You will go astray
Like a killer whale
Trapped in a bay
I'm a tree that grows hearts
One for each that you take
You're the intruder hand
I'm the branch that you break

Badi Assad,"Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same
Will it make it easier on you
Now you got someone to blame

You say
One love
One life
When it's one need
In the night
It's one love
We get to share it
It leaves you baby
If you don't care for it

Did I disappoint you?
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without

Well it's too late
Tonight
To drag the past out
Into the light
We're one
But we're not the same
We get to carry each other
Carry each other
One

Have you come here for forgiveness
Have you come to raise the dead
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head
Did I ask too much
More than a lot
You gave me nothing
Now it's all I got
We're one
But we're not the same
We hurt each other
Then we do it again

You say
Love is a temple
Love a higher law
Love is a temple
Love the higher law
You ask me to enter
But then you made me crawl
And I can't be holding on
To what you got
When all you got is hurt

One blood
One life
You got to do what you should

Badi Assad,"A Thousand Broken Mirrors
A scream a shout far in the distance
Maybe the first or second floor
Curtains colouring the windows
Never see behind closed doors
A silent siege behind politeness
Domestic harmony for show
Lost in the mirage of a marriage
Outside a world she'll never know
And as I see through the real you
I'm falling Straight into
A Thousand broken Mirrors
I can't hide
And outside the bright lights 
Can't hide the pain inside
And I've broken a thousand mirrors 
Now it's time(x 4) 
Loving her children with a passion
Protecting them at any cost
Taking the only course of action
There's no more bridges left to cross
Who are the ones that are the guilty?
Who are the ones that bear the scar?
We must not leave our sisters bleeding
We sing this song for Tsoora Shah
And as I see through the real you
I'm falling Straight into
A Thousand broken Mirrors
I can't hide
And outside the bright lights 
Can't hide the pain inside
And I've broken a thousand mirrors

Badi Assad,"Ainda é cedo, amor
Mal começaste a conhecer a vida
Já anuncias a hora de partida
Sem saber mesmo o rumo que irás tomar

Preste atenção, querida
Embora eu saiba que estás resolvida
Em cada esquina cai um pouco a tua vida
Em pouco tempo não serás mais o que és

Ouça-me bem, amor
Preste atenção, o mundo é um moinho
Vai triturar teus sonhos, tão mesquinho
Vai reduzir as ilusões a pó

Preste atenção, querida
De cada amor tu herdarás só o cinismo
Quando notares estás à beira do abismo
Abismo que cavaste com os teus pés",A Mundo é Um Moinho (The World Is a Mill),2006
Badi Assad,"One more kiss, dear, one more sigh
Only this dear, is goodbye
For our love is such pain and such pleasure
That I'll treasure till I die

So for now dear, Aurevoir, madame
But I bow dear, not farewell
For in time we may have a love's glory
Our love story to tell

Just as every autumn leaves fall from the tree
Tumble to the ground and die
So in the springtime like sweet memories
They will return as will I

Like the sun dear, upon high
We'll return dear, to the sky
And we'll banish the pain and the sorrow
Until tomorrow, goodbye

One more kiss dear, one more sigh
Only this dear, is goodbye
For our love is such passion, such pleasure
I will treasure until till I die

Like the sun dear, upon high
We'll return dear, to the sky
And we'll banish the pain and the sorrow
Until tomorrow, goodbye

Badi Assad,"Aquilo que era mulher
Pra não te acordar cedo
Saía da cama na ponta do pé
Só te chamava tarde sabia teu gosto
Na bandeja, café
Chocolate, biscoito, salada de fruta
Suco de mamão

No almoço era filé mignon
Com arroz à la grega, batata corada
Um vinho do bom
No jantar era a mesma fartura do almoço
E ainda tinha opção
É mas deu mole ela dispensou você
Chegou em casa outra vez doidão

Brigou com a preta sem razão
Quis comer arroz doce com quiabo
Botou sal na batida de limão
Deu lavagem ao macaco, banana pro porco, osso pro gato
Sardinha ao cachorro, cachaça pro pato
Entrou no chuveiro de terno e sapato
Não queria papo
Foi lá no porão, pegou tres-oitão

Deu tiro na mão do próprio irmão
Que quis te segurar
Eu consegui te desarmar
Foi pra rua de novo
Entrou no velório pulando a janela
Xingou o defunto, apagou a vela

Cantou a viúva mulher de favela
Deu um beijo nela
O bicho pegou a polícia chegou
Um couro levou em cana entrou
Ela não te quer mais

I've tried to hear, you're not near.
Remembering when I saw your face,
Shining my way, pure timing.
Now I've fallen in deep, slow silent sleep,
It's killing me, I'm dying.

To put a little sunshine in your life.

Soleil all over you, warm sun pours over me.
Soleil all over you
Warm sun.

Now this slick fallen rift,
Came like a gift,
Your body moves ever nearer
And your will dry this tear

Now that we're here, and grieve for me, not history
But now I'm dry of thoughts, wait for the rain,

Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories
Facing a dying nation of moving paper fantasy
Listening for the new told lies
With supreme visions of lonely tunes
Somewhere, inside something , there is a rush of greatness
Who knows what stands in front of our lives
I fashion my future on films in space
Silence tells me secretly ev'rything, ev'rything
Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star

As the rain came down
It's a long way home
But we're not alone
Life's carousel keeps turning still

Life keeps turning around, and around
We keep learning from things we have found
Overground

What a fool
To believe
I could help
You to breathe
Getting cold
In the rain
Makes us feel
Young again

If you go
Take a long way round
You'll be lost then found

Face the truth and realise that none of this was planned
The way we worry about such little things
Take a time to take the break
Darling spread your wings
I stole all the roses that make your crown
Now it's easier
To just put aside the things that face us now

Let's go out! Where we don't know anyone!
Cause it's you! I don't need anyone else!
I got you! I don't need anyone else but you...

strange how something comes from nothing
I came around to your way
Of thinking about these things
Saw your face in a crowd
I knew that you were special
And ****** change my world
If I could help you now

but nothing's gonna change your mind
And no one's gonna help you now
If nothing's gonna change your mind
Then no one's gonna help you find
Your place in this world
So strange we don't need *************

Please forgive me girl if I say the future is not bright
But please take my hand and we'll have one last dance in the place where we first met eyes

Holy city zoo
I recall the name of the place where I first saw you
With your eyes so kind
And your smile so bright
I just wanted to take you home

Where you go I wanna go
What you do I wanna do
I'll be your Troy Donnahue
If you'll be my Sandra Dee

It's a trivial pursuit
But I know if I fall on my heart
I'll be with you
But please understand I am just a man
And I need you to take me home

We're together now
Wanna change my shoes so I feel like you somehow
Need to breathe your breathe and caress your dress
I'll be with you for quite some time

I'll take you where you wanna go
Tell me where
I wanna know
I will just go with the flow
As long as I'm there with you

Are the kids ok
Did they find the time to give the call today
But my hearts with yours
I am keeping score of the things that I have done wrong

Another funeral
All the people I know are beginning to fade away
And I have to say that at least today its beginning to get me down

To this day I'm lovin you
We know what we wanna do
I am your Troy Donnahue
And you are my Sandra Dee

Now I know you well
I still love you adore you I need you more than then
With your eyes still kind and your smile so bright
I still want to take you home

And I will do all that I can
You're my women I'm your man
And if we still don't have a plan
We'll listen to Thunderoad

She was my heroin; she was my love and hate. 
She was perfection in a pill that takes me away. 
This is life as addiction. 

This is love without a gun. 
This is my heart in ink as bold and black as the night we ended and as weak as your skin deep smiles. And this pen digs me into holes I can't write out of, I can't climb out of. 
These are the hands that will bury my face.

But I've seen you changing and turning, and I know that things won't be the same.

I remember that summer in Dublin, and the liffey as it stank like hell,
And the young people walking on Grafton street, and everyone looking so well,
I was singing a song I heard somewhere, called ""Rock 'n' roll never forgets"",
When my hummin' was smothered by a 46a and the scream of a low flying jet.
So I jumped on a bus to dun laoire, stoppin' off to pick up my guitar,
And a drunk on the bus told me how to get rich. 
I was glad we weren't goin' too far.

So I'm leavin' on Wednesday morning tryin' to find a place where I can hear
The tunes of the birds and the sea on the rocks, where open roads always are near,
And if sometimes I tire of the quiet, and I want to walk back up that hill,
I'll just get on the road and stick out my thumb. 
I know that you'll be there still.",Summer in Dublin,2008

Tell me what you'd do

Seemed different to you

If a lie was love

Lives would re-arrange

What did lies ever do to you, my friend?
They're the keepers of truth
They'll be with you till the bitter end

If a lie was love
Worlds would just collide
Nothing could survive
No matter how we tried

If a lie was love
Love would be a lie

A rift in space and time

Como ríe la vida
Si tus ojos negros me quieren mirar
Y si es mío el amparo
De tu risa leve
Que es como un cantar
Ella quieta mi herida
Todo, todo se olvida

Se vestirá de fiesta
Con su mejor color
Y al viento las campanas
Dirán que ya eres mía
Y locas las fontanas
Se contaran su amor

La noche que me quieras
Desde el azul del cielo
Las estrellas celosas
Nos miraran pasar
Y un rayo misterioso
Hará nido en tu pelo
Luciérnaga curiosa
Que vera que eres mi consuelo

El día que me quieras
No habrá mas que armonía
Será clara la aurora
Y alegre el manantial
Traerá quieta la brisa

But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet
But all that I soon forget 
With my man
He's not much for looks 
And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care

de las luces que a lo lejos
van marcando mi retorno.

con sus palidos reflejos
hondas horas de dolor.

siempre se vuelve
al primer amor.

donde me cobijo
tuya es su vida
tuyo es su querer.

hoy me ven volver.

errante en las sombras

Tengo miedo del encuentro
con el pasado que vuelve
a enfrentarse con mi vida.

encadenen mi sonar.

Pero el viajero que huye
tarde o temprano
detiene su andar.

Y aunque el olvido
que todo destruye
haya matado mi vieja ilusion,

guardo escondida
una esperanza humilde
que es toda la fortuna
de mi corazon.

Avec de grands pieds, une taille d'hippopotame
Vivement elle m'saute au cou
Me crie ""bonjour, mon loup""
Je lui dis ""pardon madame, mais qui êtes vous?""

Elle me répond ""mais c'est moi, Valentine""

Never thought that I'd be here alone,
I used to think you would never,
You'd never leave our happy home.

I thought that we were fine,
And everything was cool.
But maybe I was blind,
Maybe I was being the fool,
Cause I didn't see this comin',
Didn't know that you would walk away,
So I'm searching for the answers,
And maybe you can just tell me

Where did I go wrong?
And how can I make it right?
Tell me where did I go wrong?
You know I want to make it right,
And make you come back it me.

Although we're miles apart,
I'm still here missing you and,
You know you're in my heart,
You know I'm wanting you,
And I can still remember,
All the joy that you have brought to me
And I thought we'd stay together, 
Now I'm here just wondering,

Where did I go wrong?
And how can I make it right?
Tell me where did I go wrong?

And make you come back to me.

You know you'll always be there in my heart,

Normal (If I do what you say am I)
Normal 

Well I'm just a normal guy in a normal world
I live a normal life. I got a normal girl
I drive to normal places in my normal car
I even wish upon the normal stars
But people say it isn't normal 
If I want to pierce my nose
Or if I let a blind man design my clothes
Or if I pick the petals leave the thorns upon my rose
Or if I just want to paint my toes 

People say it's not

Normal (I really think I'm okay and that´s)
Normal 

My momma say´s it isn't normal if I want to sleep all day
If I don´t get a normal job, I´ll throw my life away
She says I should go to school to get my B.A.
But me, I want to be a DJ
My friends say it isn't normal if I don´t want to touch that stuff
But I don´t need to follow no one, I´m already cool enough
You say I gotta be name brand, but I´m gonna call your bluff
And if you don´t like it that´s tough.

Once upon a time there was a man who had a wife
A couple kids, a cat, a dog. He thought he had a perfect life
That's not for me 
Because I want to be
I want to be a painter
And I want to be an actor and a sculptor
Or a clown
Maybe I want to drive a tractor
Why can't you see, that's normal to me
To me, that's normal 

So what-if I don't like the food you eat
So what if you don't like to dance to my beat
So what if you're expensive and you think I´m cheap
So what does that make me incomplete?
So what if I don't want to come my hair
So what. Judging me, that's really unfair
So what, I only listen to the man up there
And I bet you he thinks I'm normal 

I am my own man, so I do what I will
Every individual has their own skill
We all set goals that we want to fulfill
Whether a butcher, a baker, a computer maker
It's your life so do what you want to do
You got one life to live, you don´t have two
To yourself to yourself, you gotta be true
And that's gonna make you normal

I like to fly will you buy a jet for me

I remember when I was young
Me and dad had so much fun
Climbing trees and skipping stones
I had a couple of lizards
And a snake of my own!

But the biggest kick I've ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were playing on the dock
We were jumping in the river savin' big ol' crocs
When

Hold your rocking, something sunk
And how your feet just can't keep still
I'm always catching them every time
And I guess I always will

OH BY CRIKEY!
It's Friday night!
Just grab a croc and hold on tight, man!
Plan on rocking was the way to put things right

Taking salties for a ride
Up the river to be safe and sound
Cause I know a few places
That he won't be found

I could tell you 'bout the trick we've got
When we move around a big ol' croc
Wrap the head and watch the tail!
That's the way my dad taught me
And it never fails
When

Hold your rocking! Something sunk
And how your feet just can't keep still
I'm always catching them every time

Bahamadia,"""So, respect the architect.""
""So, respect the architect.""
""So, respect the architect.""
""So, respect the architect as I begin to build.""

[Bahamadia] 
I'm mystical; don't be deceived by the visual 
Visible preference is pure; patent it back to metaphors 
Greetin' 'em Illa del style wild 
Analyze my memoirs, runnin' on eight, four poetic meter 
Soarin' way beyond 
Iambic pentameter or juvenile flam 
Unsyncopated soul, piercin' earlobes and egos 
My vocals read these thoughts - am I hardcore? 
To the grain

[Guru] 
Lame-game, plain-Jane emcees can't approach these 
I shake chumps like fleas; I hold the keys 
To drive you, guide you, provide you 
With the real joints; ahem, I clear my throat of phlegm 
The architect, selecting the blueprints 
To rid the game of nuisance 
Sucker reducin' with the fusion 
Rhymes solid like cement in my musical solution 
Stackin' concrete flows; look out below 
""So, respect the architect.""
""So, respect the architect as I begin to build.""

[Guru] 
Rhymes get all up in your grill like freckles 
Most emcees couldn't see me with bifocal spectacles 
There's no protectin' you; with realness, I'm wreckin' you 
I'm beggin' you - take a look into the cipher 
You're dirt on my windshield, so I'm turnin' on my wipers 
And I can see clearly now 
No other rapper is near me 
And all you perpetrators shall fear me now

[Bahamadia] 
Never flip folklores, only realness 
Coincide with the rhythm like I did with Total Wreck 
Respect the architect in this division 
Rhymes written to be hittin' like anti-proton collisions 
Rap newest edition, bringin' the feminine in renditions 
In rare form, defined as optimal for my pedigrees 
In skill three like three-sixty degrees as in well-rounded 
Leavin' the competition dumb-founded 
For when I catch wreck, I astound 
""So, respect the architect.""
""So, respect the architect.""
""So, respect the architect.""
""So respect the architect... as I begin to build.""

[Guru] 
Floor to ceiling, constantly building 
With power to construct towers of rap cream, kid; what? 
Dreamin' you're lyrical, physical, mystical? 
Your concept's mediocre, plus you're way too typical withcha 
Corny delivery and crazy, whack voice 
Mad corny image; that's why I give you jitters 
It figures I'd have to dust you off the scene 
Like a wiseguy, with my New York lean

[Bahamadia] 
Lines that I supply fortify the nuclei of mindstate 
From state to state, universal, be the orals that I create 
Top notch and on lock like Sentry; opponents could never tempt me 
Samplin' my style like an Akai S-950, and still can't get with me 
While I spread this verbal plague like bubonic 
Conductin' phonics like the Philharmonics 
I make in measured melody; kids praise me like the crucifix 
So place Bahamad' amongst your top ten of emcees 
""So, respect the architect.""
""So, respect the architect.""
""So, respect the architect.""
""So respect the architect... as I begin to build.""

[Guru] 
Yeah, neverending, knah I'm sayin? Always buildin'
My homegirl Bahamadia in the hidouse, yeah, yeah
And of course, my man the legend
Ramsey Lewis
So respect the architect, knah I'm sayin?
One love",Respect the Architect,1995
Bahamadia,"Verse One:

Word life boo, I checked you flexin wit' cha crew
 lookin sweet enough to chew wit them saint eyes like tha brew,
roughneck mannerism, fly disposition,
ya live like channel sparkin' like mad-izm,
my mission, is gettin into you like a religion,
my woman's intuition tells me cupid's arrow's hittin,
you're the prince with the glass slipper that my foot could fit in,
this feelin that I have is never endin, I'm sendin, my love like Zhane' up
in a box
with the bow up on the top, cause, for you I got the hots so
please accept these feelings I possess i'm like a damsel in distress in
pursuit of happiness, I confess
chorus: I've been really tryin' baby
tryin to hold back these feelings for so long
and if you feel, like I feel baby
come on, ohhh, come on

Verse Two:

Many men wit mass appeal expand across the globe by the mills,
but still I picked you like a daffodil
cause you thrill me like magnetic fields that give my body chills,
perserve my chocolate ties and it's a thrill; I'm sayin
that when you swing my way I, get a sudden rush,
that entices me not to keep it on the hush-hush,
boy times girl times lust equals us,
and you can count on that like you would an abacus so
bust the equation, baby cause I'm facin the fact that I only think of you
on two occasions, but I'ma max once I get this off my chest, and just let
nature do the rest..
I confess

Chorus

Verse Three:

I want to be down like brandy with you handy for tha duration,
engage in electric relaxation,
build a conversation, probe ya intellect,
put ya manhood to the test, but not just ya physical, ya individual is what
I'm after,
ya heart I want to capture, I'm open like a space that NASA explores,
truly do adore, every little move you make and more, my word is born
but I could go on and on throwin hints,
that I'm tha chick, you should be celebratin life wit,
so instead I felt it best if I just,
stood and represented in the flesh,
that I confess...

Thoughts command some, is this, a phantom? 
Crews I mangle, y'all know my anthem ain't the Star Spangled 
I hit you from the most bizarre angle, rectangular 
visions of papes my mind conceive 
Motivatin' me to achieve as I must proceed 
when I ride the train, traumatized to maintain 
but laid back, the tracks can relax the brain 
I got to deal with everything on this intelligent plain 
Servin' as a killer 
to the pain I live a High Life like Miller 
Me and the mic's mechanized 
Respect recognize with mind beyond wise 
Limitless when I bless the mic with speak 
Dialect never weak, y'all niggaz know Tarik 
From seven-fifth Snider Ave. got the flavor you need 
For the ingredients indeed so to the lead I shall proceed

Get so corrupt, we can't give up, we got to keep on pushing
(Keep on pushing, ain't no stopping us)
Ain't no stopping us

A child of the essence, turning degrees into perfection
My struggle is now objective to meet the righteous direction
The life lessons, but what they all about?
If I took the dolo route, and I left the people out
Non-personal connects, low-cost effects
Bound to meet my doom for regrets so I just
Put all praises down to Allah, plus the block
Pull my family ties in one big knot
Respect the divine that makes me help me ride to the top
And do a trip to a past never forgot

Where do I go from here, I don't know, I don't know
Till I find my past, the life I knew, the life I knew
I'm holding on to my roots cause they pulling my leaves
I traveled over seas, got 400 degrees
It's the city life, trife concock the scheme
To play upon my dreams still fulfillin' my needs
Well I don't know, whatever happened to my past
Wait I gotta think about (I don't care) how long I can last
I don't know as long as I get over my worlds most biggest fears
Cause I'm drenched in sweat for family tears
So ah, where do I go from here, I don't know
I don't know, till I find my past, the life I knew

And deep like seashells, uh, I'm from L.A. so I gotta cap to adapt

It's waking up and facing the drama
Can't let you hang, maintain, run game, pimp thangs
And roll my land cruiser like it's on Danna Danes
Uh, it's show low, the west coaster, you know

They want to blame it on the gangs but it's a bigger picture

Listen to what I'm spittin, who you think benefittin
while all these heads splittin they money-gettin
See the gangbangin ain't all about the red and blue

They rub you out in a minute gettin greedier and greedier
Buyin out major labels and pimpin the media
Orchestratin beef between the west and east

'cause over the years that's what them folks want us to turn out to be, and
just release you
When I was young I wanted to be a thug
hang on the corner, smoke my weed and try to sell my drugs and show no love
In '97, all this had to change
So many murdered behind unnecessarily petty games, it's all a shame
Doin crimes as a past time
Tryin my best to stay alive is all that's on my mind
I hit my knees and drop my head between and ask the Lord
""Please let me make it through this struggle"" even though it's hard
Jealousy got us hatin it, wantin to kill each other though
What ever happened to the sayin that we are all bro's
Keep it up and best believe you, I will finally see it's gang related
So we best to let the killin cease, now rest in peace

Tell me how many Haiti bottles I gotta empty
before I wise up and stop lettin the devil tempt me
Usin materialism to jealousy to pimp me
Live by the gun, die by the gun, to put it simply it's gettin shady
They got me mad like rabies, headed for Haiti's
Sellin they soul for a Mercedes and fly ladies
All this dirt being done ain't gang related

Asked me to partake of a full plate of swine
And I was like, 'Yo, no black, that got to go'
Not fit for the belly of Mister Mondo
Why do some puff, lie and drink forties to pacify?
Why is the oppressor's clothes so freaky fly?
Why we movin' at our own pace and fallin' into the ditch
Of a trap laid for us way before the negro slave trade?
Why is it so cool to dis-believe in God?

I meditate every morning drink carrot juice I'm hardly late
Try censoring your candidate who gets head under the desk
If that's what you get you can bet I want to be the next prez
I deserve the best and if you think my lyrics are incendiary
I'll go back to being an insipid secretary
Won't inspire no one, then the world will be safe
I'll just use words to talk about how Microsoft Word is so great
I feel bad that everyone is crazy and kids are smokin crack
I also feel bad that Michael Angelo might have hurt his back
And what if there were no tracts for Shakespeare or wax
For Flash no road for Kerouac
There might not have been rap
Leave us alone make your own family a better place
How much hate could we eliminate if you were down with your kids' mix tapes
It must have been fate that brought me to this game

Keep their promises and the artists are all real artists
And the fathers finish what the fuck they started

Of my terrain; dig it; I came too far to front

Stepped off at City Hall into the rain
And ran into my nigga named Dane, I mean, Hakeem
And we was buildin' on how we could organize the team
For this capital gain bein' that we in the rap game
It's time to have it all; he said he figured he same
We realized this a planet of cream to obtain
When the predominant rap, conglomerate rap spark the flame
Hark the name, the fifth from the Ill-Power Hill at that
He dropped me off within the streets of South Phil'
Where niggas think that killing's living real
Shorty's is getting wetted, fulfilling their fantasies to set it
We don't sweat it, by the fifth you get beheaded
I pivot through my borough givin' pounds to the dreaded
At the lye spots I got credit; could run 'em down
In alphabetical order it's sorta pathetic

Ill, die-hard soldiers try to make it towards the generals
Hard-headed, rugged captains walkin' head on through action

You see the light; you can't eclipse the sun

You're now a victim of reality, my personality
Afflicted, for three to five if convicted

Derived from mind states of Cold Crush tapes
And beat breaks seduced by means to elevate
Equates my views with the passing

Intertwine one thought in unison

It's time to leave for the higher state

There is no rhyme to express my emotion
There's only rhyme to feel
There is no rhyme to fulfill my devotion
There's only rhyme to heal

Don't fret get high there's a new dawn that says hi
The higher state

It's a happy day for you and I
The sun is up and shining in the sky
Got a heart of gold that I can see
Baby you got you now you got me

It is no crime to be lost with no direction
It's just a crime not to live
And there is no crime to be asked for affection
Its just a crime not to live

Don't fret get high there's a new dawn that says hi
The higher state",Higher State,2010

The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais

Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,

And he heard their mournful cry.

Bajah,"This is the byproduct of beautiful love
Fit like a glove, what's good, my people thought that we could
Get it you know we should, hold it like it’s a brush submerged
But I just surf

I’m renting the universe
But the stars don’t fit and my bars are too mega
Is the fruit of my labor, my plate is full of color
Arugula and rutabaga share the food with my neighbor
Truly innovative like Fela Kuti and Ginger Baker

Moon raker, sun scraper, will give you five for the papers
Take you higher on the vapors
Desire the flavor, design of the caper
Executive executor direct when I'm a pathlight
Flight without navigator, plight of a savior

Now what would Jesus do?
How you believe in Him? He don’t believe in you
The idea that you doubting I'm unbeatable
The genie and the princess bride inconthievable
These MCs is eatable, wait - edible
I’m fishing with dynamite, now I got a freezer full
Of rappers, bastards I'm ten steps ahead of you
Incredible, give credit where credit due

Put passion into action
Mashing on the gas where them others they be maxing
Accelerate, generate, power with my pen and paper
Stimulate, you simulate, you do what I incinerate

We do it for the dinner plates, musical we innovate
You imitate, your theory full of holes and so we ventilate
Damn it, never gonna say they love what we doing on stage
Even if they don’t want quote and the hate just integrates

They feel us like shade, you know we’re feeling great
Not a script that is ripped, this is our original spit
It's an unconventional gift, kwe we in turbulence
The mothers be herbin' it, the praise, we deserving it

Word, I love songs, writing to right wrongs
Continue to fight on, I’m putting the gloves on
I love horns, I'm loving this damn track
I’m loving the hand clap, it's the clap, clap
Loving it when you listen
Love will fix its dead ass for the Simpson (That's right)
Living for the drums and the slums, some of the best parts
The tourists never come, they run when it gets dark

Yeah, so I’m on outerspace, they funny like they're bridal maids
Booking like we’re playing spades, yeah, we always make the play
I see to get a faith for last yielding to the hate
Sucka free I’m in my space, say I’m hella steezy, yeah
Believe I get a sew-in, streaking like a ?
Sunny in Dolores bright park a
Fly chick's sparking
Then we have to roll to the finish of some steady bar hopping
There's high life everywhere, Tony ? rhythm is
Pattern that we living in, Kweli on his business
Everywhere we deep in this, ? gon' be speaking it
Oh, it’s how you lickety spit

The great debate of the saviour, that caped crusader
The alpha, the omega, your favourite communicator
News junky I’m the one can admit the job creators
Departed the conversation that started indoctrination
The flow is a thing of beauty, I’m bringing it as my nudey
You drinking it like a smoothie, they spinning it like a ?
Rappers, I dissect 'em, collecting 'em like a souvie
Near they’re acting up and directing 'em like a movie
Skip the drama, this an action-adventure
They so freaking soft this should be against the law, illegal tender
And yo, do I really need to mention

But you can't fool all the people all the time
So now we see the light (What you gonna do?)
We gonna stand up for our rights! (Yeah, yeah, yeah!)

Bajo esa puta lluvia que no deja de golpear 
Why la sintió? que va a sentir 
Mientras las lagrimas brotaban a granel 
Leyó otra vez, se sorprendió 
Buscando auxilio un remedio compasión 
Why en un café se refugio 
Why afuera el mundo continuaba sin razón 

Hoy no supo why no es grupo esta roto por adentro 
Fue tan bruta la sentencia 
Esa clínica evidencia 

Ella ahora esta ahí? why ahí palmo 
En esa zona a donde arruga hasta el dolor 
Why es que además? no puede ver 
Porque el futuro hoy se le desmorono 
Why el vidrio intenta desempañar 
Como si así fuera a borrar su maldición 

Leyó otra vez, se dijo adiós 
En adelante solo habría despedidas

Por un momento pierdo la fé
Me consuelo pensando que ya no muerdo el anzuelo
Levanto el alma del suelo, prendo un pucho, y salgo de este sucucho
Llevo en la mano el cigarro y pienso ""otro crack con pies de barro""
Mejor jugar de callado y nunca treparse al carro,
Ando emperrado en encontrar el tiempo perdido, en lamentos apretados
En penales casi siempre mal pateados
Laburo por chirolas, no quiero seguir y decido salir de la cola
Y aunque el lobo no puede, y aunque las gambas casi no quieren
Doy una vuelta a ver si todavía llueve

Ya no duele el corazón y esta noche ya no sopla el viento del dolor
Ya no duele el corazón 
Y es un amargo bandoneón lo que amaga en mi canción

El vidrio que me mira, la gente que dobla la esquina
La bocanada casi me tira y la rambla, que sigue vacía
Suelo mojado, el tránsito encajonado
Como un perro que ladra encerrado en una trampa desconocida
La lluvia que salpica la memoria enrojecida por la nostalgia
Como lágrimas partidas, como lágrimas perdidas
Tiempo mejor, cielo de miel
Ahora que sale el sol y empieza a calentar la piel

Ya no duele el corazón y esta noche ya no sopla el viento del dolor
Ya no duele el corazón 
Y es un amargo bandoneón lo que amaga en mi canción

Bronco tosarrón de tanto fumar, ganas de empezar a caminar
Y dejar de pensar en flores que se queman de frío 
En un sucio jarrón vacío 
En un Río de Plata marrón que ahora miro sin apuro

Chiflo bajo, me pateo el hormigón mientras pienso, 
Calentón, que me rajo del laburo y que me rajó con razón

Ya no duele el corazón y es un amargo bandoneón lo que amaga en mi canción

ultimately compelling the seas to rise and devour the continent, leaving no

They came in the night, and butchered five of my party, the terrified survivors
fleeing with the first wan light of dawn. The fiends seemed inexplicably to
be an extension of the night, as if their misshapen bodies were actually
somehow composed of the darkness itself. Even as I gazed directly at them,
I found I could not truly focus on their stygian forms... their bodies
appearing to shimmer and shift like the ripples of a heat-haze upon an arid
plain. My ammunition, discharged in vain, is all but spent... and now, as night
unfurls its malign wings once more to enshroud this desolate and forsaken
place, I wait alone for the sunrise I fear I shall never see. At dusk I
discovered a hidden alcove in the time-raught surface of the great monolith
which stands as a mute sentinel before the entrance to the colossal temple;
a moss encrusted crevice concealed from the eyes of man for I know not how
long. As the darkness massed about me, a strange miasma seemed to grip my mind
in tenebrous tendrils, and I beheld that horrifying and immemorial edifice
which I now feel certain once cast its diabolical shadow upon the Gate of the
Sun. It is all true, everything I feared, everything which I dared imagine
only in the blackest embrace of the most narcotic malignity. There are Six
Keys To The Onyx Pyramid, which conceal a terrifying truth never intended to
be grasped by the woefully fragile mind of Man. I now pray that no unfortunate
soul ever again stumbles as close as I to those cryptic axioms which lie ever
in wait between the incorporeal veils of light and shadow. I would offer up a
prayer to the divinity which once I worshipped, but I know it would echo
emptily through the abyssal reaches of the unheeding cosmos. As I scrawl this
final entry in my journal, the sun sinks with a chilling finality below this
now alien horizon. I know the shadowy figures shall soon return to claim me.

blissfully forgotten. Just before dawn, I awoke from a fantastic and somewhat
horrifying dream in which I traversed a great black cyclopean cityscape,
its towering stygian walls inscribed with some form of outlandish glyphs which
seemed to writhe squamously and alter their shape even as I gazed at them.
A sibilant whispering which seemed at once familiar and yet intrusively alien
compelled me to walk to the edge of a particularly sinister looking edifice
and peer out over its precipitous perimeter. When I did so, I beheld this
world of ours, recognizing vaguely the apparent shapes of the five continents,
yet the entire vista seemed so distant that the whole appeared in its entirety
no larger than a sphere which I could fit snugly into the palm of my hand.
When I turned again to behold the looming obelisks, I found I could then
easily read the previously untranslatable ciphers in the black stone. They
were the words of a great thaumaturgist who had seemingly discovered a
repository of aeons-old lore detailing the sidereal web of the cosmos, with
arcane diagrams pinpointing certain astral portals and places of empyreal
potency, a sort of pangalactic ley-line chart, if you will. Indeed, these
Star-Maps Of The Ancient Cosmographers seemed to take a not insignificant toll
on the author's sanity, as evidenced by the tone of his inscriptions, which
seem to suggest that in discovering this Pandora's Box of dark elucidation,
his fate was to be inexorably dogged by some nameless and implacable gloom;",Draconis Albionensis,2001

Upon extensive examination of the nefarious arcane codex known as The Epsilon
Exordium, I believe my search may at last be drawing to a close. 
Indeed, I feel that perhaps the great discovery which has eluded me for so long may
Finally be within my grasp. 
And yet I must be cautious, for twice more have I seen the figures in the night, watching me in silence from the confines of the darkness. 
I cannot discern their features, only that they are vaguely human in shape, save for their arms which seem abnormally long and oddly jointed. 
My native guides are becoming increasingly agitated and skittish, babbling incoherently about the guardians of the tombs... citing legends from their ancestral past which speak of mysterious travelers who reputedly came down from the stars in great silvern chariots drawn by steeds of flame.
At any rate, I have my trusted Martini-Henry .45 calibre breech-loader should these silent stalkers prove malign and ever deign to lay hold of me in the night. 
I have at last translated the carvings on the stone fragment I unearthed amidst the ruins of Angkor Wat. To my astonishment, I found that it predated the construction of the temple itself by countless thousands of years, and that it spoke of the same subject as did the hieroglyphs I beheld on the
Wall of the concealed chamber which I and Lord Blakiston discovered within the Great Pyramid in Egypt. 
Successive examinations of the edifices at Giza and Karnak revealed further parallels too precise to be mere coincidence. 
The pieces of this great cosmic puzzle are finally beginning to fall into place...

(2 October, 1893)
Yes, it is as I suspected. I have long felt that the Sumerians of Mesapotamia were among the first peoples to attain elucidation concerning the dread matter I pursue.
My excavations at Lagash, Eridu, and most notably the ziggurats at you're, have revealed truths which subsequent finds at Angkor, Egypt and Sacsahuaman only serve to consolidate. 
I now know that the Olmechs, the Aztecs and the Mayans were also undeniably key tendrils of this grand global web, and the unnerving truth I hitherto felt compelled to deny now seems inexorably
To point to some grand and terrifying universal axiom.
It seems however, that the closer I come to enlightenment, the greater the danger becomes. 
Last night, one of our expedition's chief guides disappeared without trace. 
His native compatriots could find no tracks, nor offer any evidence of his departure to suggest that his superstitions had finally compelled him to abandon the party... the man seems simply to have vanished inexplicably into the oppressive, sweltering dark. 
In light of the disappearance, I opted not to inform the group that during the darkling hours
Before sunrise last night I had peered from my tent to behold what I perceived to be three of the shadowy figures I have previously described moving furtively in the gloom, keeping ever just out of the illuminatory radias of our campfire.
By the time I had brought my rifle to bear, they had melted away into the fathomless shadows of the benighted jungle...

The inscriptions on the tablet I discovered seem to be a fragmentary piece of some mysterious, perhaps apocryphal, larger work; evidently a lexicon of some description, undoubtedly of antediluvian origin.

Tribal creation myth and folklore from the Northern Hemisphere, dating from 650 B.T.C. (Before the Third Cataclysm), Antediluvian Calendar:

Hearken, children of the Ersatz gods, sons and daughters of the New Earth, for here is truth. Long ago, before the third of Earth's moons fell firey from the star-seared sky, there were those whom we have come to call the First Ones. These men-who-were-not-men were the creations of the Mera, beings from the far reaches of the limitless cosmos, whose essence still flickers latently within the minds of all their disparate progeny. Praise the Mera, fathers of the First Ones, bondsmen to the Kl'aa, sworn foes of the Z'xulth! 
Sired in the great spawning vats beyond the fathomless deeps of the Pre-Cambrian sea, the First Ones throve. Those who were engineered to live on land duly constructed the grand Antarctic Megalopolis, ultimately becoming entangled in bitter conflicts with the hoary Serpent Kings before retreating into the subterrene depths of the vast inner world, whereas those First Ones that had chosen the embrace of the abyssal seas were the architects of vast and glorious submarine cities whose splendid spires and minarets towered proudly beneath the unfathomed waves. Those grand bioluminescent cities are now long since fallen, razed and dispersed, given over to the cruel whims of the unforgiving oceans. 
From the lore of our ancestors, we know the true nature of the cosmos. We know of the hidden and silent places, the places which reside in between the veils of reality, the places which mankind was never meant to see.
All this we know... we who survive, we who are descended from those First Ones, and who give thanks to the gods-who-are-not-gods, for our creation, our genesis, for the breath of life that was forced into our progenitors during the early epochs of this cratered globe.

Chapter 11: The Siege Begins 

And so the mighty and resplendent armies of the Imperium assembled before the towering cyclopean walls of ancient Gul-Kothoth. It was some time before the billowing dust cloud raised by the massed arrival of the vast imperial host settled, ultimately dissipating as the shadows of dusk descended. With nightfall, the imperial army's countless torches, braziers and cookfires illumined the dark plain before the fortress like a coruscating sea, painting the stygian heavens the colour of flame. And the high summer's night passed swiftly. At length, the dawn approached tentatively, and with the first signs of the newborn sun etching its promise upon the skies, the martial preparations commenced in earnest. A brief and perfunctory exchange between the Imperial Herald and the fortification's Watch Commander held no surprises, and the Emperor's banner was duly driven into the seared earth before Gul-Kothoth with a chilling finality. Vast siege engines and powerful ballistae were hauled inexorably into position, alongside a battery of katapelte and petrobolos. The one hundred thousand strong Imperial Frontier Army, having planted their regimental blazons into the arid soil, waited with a disciplined patience born of never having met defeat in pitched battle or siege, the dreaded Imperial War-Leopards straining noisily against their iron-link leashes to the rear of the cohorts of conscripts and auxillieries. The pitiless Iron Phalanx and their Lord Militant Commander had assumed position at the head of the army's Alpha Wing, polished swords, spears and poll-axes reflecting the glow from the myriad torches and braziers which still burned about the Imperial Host. And behind them were drawn up the legendary Legion of the Ebon Tiger, Pride of the Emperor, the infantry and cavalry famed throughout the Great Northern Continent, personal regiment of the feared general Baalthus Vane. True to their martial reputation, the six thousand strong Legion were inscrutible in their jet black armour, their sable banner billowing in the chill breeze which skittered over the plain. And finally, astride his azure-shaffroned warhorse and surrounded by his elite guard, the silvern-armoured Emperor Koord himself studied the precipitious gates with a disdainful scrutiny. At the Emperor's right hand was the renowned Swordmaster of Kyrman'ku, an eastern bladesman of preternatural skill and the most revered and expensive mercenary in the Imperium. At his left, the infamous Ogre-Mage of the Black Lake brooded silently, swathed in a stygian cloak and fuliginous cowl and exuding an aura of implacable malevolence which unerved even the bravest of the Imperial troops. The Emperor had deemed the services of these two nefarious renegades pivotal to the execution of the Final Campaign, for they alone had knowledge of the mysterious arcane rite known as The Words Which Unfetter. 
And, behind their titanic time-worn palisades, the defenders of Gul-Kothoth beheld this awesome force ranged against them and shuddered, not with fear, but with an awful and night-cold anticipation.

THE EMPEROR KOORD: General Vane, we begin the final stage of this campaign with the rising of the sun. This war which has raged for decades shall finally be decided here, before the hoary walls of ageless Gul-Kothoth. The Imperium's last and most glorious victory is at hand. The procrastinating sybarites of the bureaucracy have been threatened and bribed into compliance over this venture. This more than anything else is why I have deigned to grace this final battle with my Imperial presence, even against the advice of the Grand Vizier and the sage counsel of the Seers.
BAALTHUS VANE: You shall enjoy watching the Ebon Tiger bloody its claws, sire. Our victory here is assured.
THE EMPEROR KOORD: You should not call in your falcons before the hunt is done, my loyal servitor. Overconfidence is but one of the many foes a general must face upon the field of war. Today, the precepts and maxims of the Imperium shall be tested, and we shall see whether the velvet glove of diplomacy or the iron gauntlet of conquest has proved the more effective tool.  
BAALTHUS VANE: The days of the feudal suzerainties are long gone, my liege. The Imperial Military Council is the only entity fit to govern the dominions. The fall of Vyrgothia shall today render the truth of the Imperial Mandate self evident.      
THE EMPEROR KOORD: And yet I am vexed, for as you well know, the sorcerous emmisary I despatched to the Court of the Over-King has warned that the Vyrgothians may have recovered one of the artefacts comprising the fabled Trinity of Might; the legendary Obsidian Crown itself! In the hands of a skilled thaumaturgist, it is said that the Crown may be used as a weapon of unparalleled destructive potency.
BAALTHUS VANE: The Shadow-Sword! The Obsidian Crown! The Ebon Sceptre! Feh! The power of the Trinity is but a myth! No antiquated trinket weilded by a religious fanatic will prevail against the Legion, sire. Our steel is proof against such diabolism! Behold! Gul-Tryarch has fallen, Gul-Azlaan has been given to the earth, Gul-Nomedes is naught but smouldering rubble, and soon we shall surge over the shattered remnants of Gul-Kothoth's renowned walls! The Vyrgothian Alliance shall crumble when these gates are breached, and the Over-King himself shall stand before thee in shackles! 
THE EMPEROR KOORD: Indeed. At any rate, I have been blessed with foresight enough to prepare a contingency should the foe fulfil that fearful potential which has been weighing heavy on my mind. But now, the sun rises! Let it begin! Let the final chapter of our legend be written! Give the word! Raze Gul-Kothoth to the ground!

The Imperial War-Skalds:
An age of fire, sword and shield,
The thunder of the battlefield,
The clarions call, bring down the wall!
May the Empire's glory never fade,
Righteous fury guide our blades,
We march to war!

The Wizards of Vyrgothia: 
Darkly bejewelled circlet of night, Crown of the Elder King,
Unfettered at last the Trinity of Might, the Sceptre, the Sword and the Ring!

 

Chapter 12: The Fall of Gul-Kothoth

And so it was that a terrible and inestimable carnage was unleashed upon the field of battle. Colossal stones, firebrands and howling iron-tipped missiles rained pitilessly down upon the hero-hewn walls of Gul-Kothoth. Vast and serpentine cracks appeared in the ancient cyclopean edifice, and hundreds of warriors, both attackers and defenders, perished in the fray, either crushed beneath the ceaselessly assailed testudo, hammered to crimson pulp by the merciless storm of unforgiving stone, or burned to blackened husks by the nightmare onslaught of flaming quicklime and saltpetre. Scaling ladders raised and repulsed in turn, storms of razor tipped shafts exchanged by the combatants, isolated skirmishes raging upon the ramparts, men blade to blade and clarions bellowing embattled defiance. For seemingly inumerable hours the sanguineous battle raged, with no quarter asked nor given between the bitter ancestral foes. And the gates held firm.
At length, the mightiest of the Empire's iron-hooded battering rams, dubbed The Bringer of Woe, was brought to bear upon the besieged fortress, and, with the shadows of dusk lengthening upon the field of war, the centuries old Primary Gate of Gul-Kothoth was finally sundered amidst an earsplitting cacophony of shattering oak and iron louder than any storm-born thunderclap. With the rending of the mighty gate, and vast fragments of the ancient walls yielding, buckling and crashing to the blood-sodden earth, the Imperium's forces breached the defenses of Gul-Kothoth and surged into the Vyrgothian Alliance's last and most renowned stronghold.
And it was at that fate-steeped instant that an army of five score and ten, bearing the Obsidian Crown, arrived upon the field of battle.

Chapter 13: The Wizards Do Battle

THE SORCERER:  By Klatrymadon and Zuranthus! They come! They come, weilding the Circlet of Night! The dire warning issued to me as I stood before Vyrgothia's Master Wizard has been proved no idle boast! The citadel's spells of containment breached... the Black Crown is upon us!  
THE EMPEROR KOORD:  It is as I have forseen! Be spry, my sorcerous lackey... join the Iron Phalanx in entertaining these latecomers while I prepare a reception worthy of their audacity!
THE SORCERER: By your command, o' luminous Imperial majesty!

At once, the far-feared and martially renowned Iron Phalanx wheeled to face the newcomers, and at the command of a decurion, a volley of armour-piercing shafts screamed skywards to rain down mercilessly upon the foe. And even as this transpired, the Emperor's Prime Sorcerer, emissary of the Imperial Court and master of those arts which speak to man in narcotic dreams from the darkest and most silent places, summoned forth that black potency which lay entwined in stygian tendrils within his mind...  an ireful power born of they who writhed upon the shores of Pangaea before man's progenitors ever erected their lofty spires to the restless skies. And yet Vyrgothia's Master Wizard, unrivalled Arch-Mage and adept of that lost Eastern order who journey beyond the boundaries of time and space upon those nebulous wings born of the sacred Azure Lotus, rose to meet this power which lapped at the periphery of his mind like a midnight tide, and stood firm against its insistent siren call.
And upon that arid field of war, the sentinels of light and shadow spoke to eachother in tongues dormant since the Third Moon fell burning from the heavens, and not sweet were the words they uttered. 
Until at last, with the armies poised to clash, and with dusk painting the sky a deep crimson exceeded in its vibrancy only by that bloody rubicund hue which stained the battlefield below it, the Emperor's mage fell, and the aeons-old might of the Obsidian Crown was finally brought to bear against they who had breached the walls of ancient Gul-Kothoth.

The Imperial War-Skalds:
Sundered, the gate of the ancient fortress,
Besieged! Now breached stand the walls.
And lo, there and army of five score and ten,
Behold! The Obsidian Crown.
Embattled, the wizards, their weapons arcane,
Untramelled, the circlet, the Prime-Sorcerer slain,
The Crown's peerless power, the Emperor's bane,
Dark magicks and havoc, now red carnage reigns!

Like the prow of a blood-hungry vessel of war rending the waves of a midnight sea, a luminescent blade of shrieking cerulean light lanced from the legendary black circlet locked tight within the gnarled hand of the Master Wizard, and clove mercilessly into the glorious ranks of the Imperium. And all who were touched by this ruinous arc of coruscating radiance knew no more... Men and beasts reduced to blackened husks, charred shells of smouldering ash, lifeless effigies which toppled to the seared earth to be dissipated by the whispering breath of the wind. Again and again the ravaging radiance smote the ranks of the Empire, leaving a noisome charnel-pit of nightmare in its crackling wake. The forces of the Imperium were plunged into a howling vortex of disarray, and, faced with the unthinkable prospect of defeat, the unprecedented first routing of the Emperor's glorious army began to become a grim reality. Yet for all the unparalleled carnage which had erupted about them, there was one regiment of Imperial troops for whom the taste of fear was bland compared to the sharp tang of rage which sat bitter upon their noble tongues...   

BAALTHUS VANE:  By all the gods of war! Stand fast, hounds of the Imperium! 'Tis true... steel is no use against this ignoble magical trickery! But if our souls are bound for the Pit this day, we'll damn well take a few of these bastards with us! Onward, my Legion! Alpha formation, banners high! Glory to the Emperor! Into the foe! Show them the Tiger's claws!
THE LEGION: Never quarter, never mercy, never retreat! Praise the Emperor!  
THE EMPEROR KOORD:  My sorcerous thrall has fallen, but he has bought us time enough to riposte! And General Vane's mettle may yet turn the tide of war back in our favour. Now, let the final act be played out! I call thee forth, Ogre-Mage of the Black Lake! I call thee forth, Swordmaster of Kyrman'ku! It is time! Now, I charge thee, for the glory of the Imperium... Speak the Words Which Unfetter!  

And so, it began... the two pivotal players in the Emperor's plan, the two key figures in the Imperium's contingency, stepped forth to fill their most vital of roles in that grand theatre of carnage which now ran unchecked on the field of battle.
The Ogre-Mage and the Swordmaster began to utter fearsome words in a tongue which was ancient ere the gleaming stars shifted upon the fathomless countenance of the distant heavens, words which in truth were not words, but rather a resonant key which would aspire to unlock a dire power which had reposed shackled since the fall of the legendary Shadow King himself, whose ebon circlet's power they even now sought to thwart. The incantation they gave voice to in the midst of that sanguineous turmoil which engulfed them was not so much heard by those within earshot as perceived, sensed as a vague disturbance in the fabric of reality, as fuliginous ripples on the surface of a hitherto still and placid pool, growing ever larger and more far reaching; an unnerving and unnamable sense of change which insinuated itself into the mind of the listener and suggested with a cold and disturbing quasi-certainty that something of preternaturally ineffable magnitude was transpiring, as surely as a festering and gangrenous corpse would split to spill its noisome gore. And as that maddeningly implacable incantation reached its resounding climax, a momentary silence enshrouded the battlefield, swathing the vista of chaos in an aura of noiselessness more pure and untainted than the tranquility of the boundless and stygian void. It was as if time itself had halted for one immemorial moment.
And it was in that oddly immeasurable instant that the dark and peerless power unfettered by those grim pseudo-words finally, ultimately, made itself known before the sundered gates of ancient Gul-Kothoth...

Some would call it an epiphany, others would deem it the final descent into madness... whatever the 
case, the last vestiges of those tenuous palisades which had previously, and blessedly, safeguarded
my reason and prevented my mind from accepting the full and staggering magnitude of the naked truth then crumbled, fading into nothingness like the dissolution of a night-mist. At length, one oppressively miasmic night, with such malefically portentous lore preying pitilessly upon my sanity, I began to descend through a myriad veils of sombre and swirling shades, finally surrendering my grip on wakefulness. And on that fitful, fateful eve, the last of the dreams came... 
A waking dream? I dare not speculate. The vision was mine, the soul too... but the time, the place, the very flesh, all this and more was unknown to me. I stood upon a nighted vista... unfeasibly alien, and yet at once wholly, unnervingly familiar. In my hand I grasped a glimmering crystal which although beautiful in its shimmering radiance, was as black as the impenetrable depths of the most stygian midnight sea. As I gazed into the obsidian heart of the gem, a needle of black light lanced forth from its multi-faceted surface and filled my eyes with a panoply of fantastic hues, revealing to me in between its pulses of massing darkness certain fleeting glimpses of places and things so fantastically terrifying that I could not faithfully begin to recount their hideous and yet grimly compelling nature. A terrible sound filled my ears... an insidious resonance which sent waves of excruciating pain coursing through my mind... a sound which inexorably coalesced into a recognizable but entirely inhuman voice, a voice which slowly, inevitably, formed approximations of words which I could discern...

Fragmentary entry I:
I have come into possession of a certain ancient book, a collection of arcane scrawlings reputed to have been derived from an even earlier transcription, allegedly lost during the great fire of 1666. The Chthonic Chronicles! I cannot disclose here the precise and rather unsavoury means by which I acquired this weather-worn tome, but I immediately recognized the veracity of the fevered inscriptions contained within. Apparently derived from an incomplete Latin translation of the original source material, the text sporadically lapses into an indecipherable tongue which the transcription cryptically notes as being Old High Atlantean. Glyphs, sigils, occult pictograms, six score and ten oblations to some malign entity of colossal evil...some diabolical avatar of the Z'xulth. Khthon! I must delve further into the foreboding depths of this great black book...

Fragmentary entry II:
Caught in the maleficent whorls and verticils of this dark tome... but what lies at the heart of it? A vespertine viper's nest of sublime wickedness! What I discovered within this shadow-haunted volume was a terrifying axiom so inestimably terrible in its magnitude that it would shatter all man's carefully orchestrated views of the cosmos and render utterly redundant previous theories on the origin of humankind. Lore dating from time immemorial; lore surviving in the records of long extinct civilizations, be it inscribed upon parchment now crumbled to dust, etched into the sand-whipped, glyph-scored stone of hoary temples, or committed to verbal traditions long since ingrained into some collective tribal memory. This is no globally common myth cycle, no collection of universally allegorical folk tales; it is all cold, pitiless truth!
And yet, such enlightenment has not been a prize easily won...I have communed with native shamans, consulted with misanthropic diabloists, I have confronted the martial agents, acolytes and cultists of clandestine sects who would see their knowledge safeguarded at all costs. Hildebrandt and the Quorum have treacherously attempted to have me commited to the baleful confines of Grimm's Hold Sanitarium, yet I have circumvented their insidious plot to put an end to my vaunted research. Damn their traitorous eyes! I must confer with Blackthorne upon his return from the Peruvian expedition... or mayhap Stone if ever the poor wretch regains his sanity...

Fragmentary entry III:
What titanic demi-gods once strode the boiling surface of the young earth, treading the shattered surface of mighty Pangaea beneath their ersatz feet? What fearsome entities were already inestimably ancient when mankind himself was naught but a collection of mindless random atoms, a viscous puddle of gelid protoplasm teeming with the raw materials of life, transient cells of primordial slime, all naught but malleable and tractable clay to be worked at by unimaginable sculptors, immortal star-spanning fiends! What inhuman eyes even now watch the inconsequential toilings of man from afar? The answers to these questions of denied primacy and direful cosmogony were too repulsively horrific to contemplate, and yet...  I knew the truth! 
And more terrifying still... The Z'xulth and their villainous agents of depravity even now walk among us!  
But what price these revelations? What dire agents of malignity safeguard such cryptic axioms against the prying intellect of man? I must confesss, oftimes in the brooding darkness of the night, I have sensed their malefic gaze upon me, lurking, inexorably dogging my every step, their existence perceived only as some unnamable sense of fearful unease, and the occaisional glimpse of black shimmering against black in the depths of the teeming shadows... I hear them whispering when the mantle of darkness silences the world, and the sibilant words they utter are not for the minds of men to know. O' how I wish I had left those vile and fathomless depths of cryptical lore wholly and mercifully unplumbed! O', how I long for the assuaging balm of ignorance to once again soothe my ravaged mind! But such pleadings are, of course, ultimately in vain. I must keep my wits about me. Even now the stars align, the celestial spheres moving into the prophesied positions of the great astral conjunction. Am I to be ground to dust between the grand gears of this pitiless cosmic engine of destruction? The die is cast, the endgame nears.

And the earth shall be enraptured by thy majesty

Of a beautiful azure-skinned woman with great black wings
To the Atlanteans, you manifested as a brilliant fiery

At large throughout the cosmos
It is a ravenous and pitiless storm which rages across the universe
Permeating the very fabric of creation, existing simultaneously
In all dimensions, wholly unconstrained by linear time

This force is the black, quasi-sentient mana which sustains
Such ageless revenants of the Z'xulth as the dread Dwellers
In Eternal Shadow and the unspeakable

When beings whose essences are intrinsically malefic
Choose to embrace this dark some energy source
The resultant sinister symbiosis can be sublimely diabolical
As evidenced by the black blight that was the infamous
Pseudo-human sorcerer Lord Angsaar

And of course, the malign Zurra, that abominable
Result of an experiment by the Ersatz Ones gone disastrously wrong
An ill advised attempt to clone the K'laa genetic template
Of mighty Zuranthus in the Mera spawning vats

Beneath the Pre-Cambrian sea, only for the matrix
To become contaminated by the errant cells of a captured
Fiend of Z'xulth, the result was a prime fiend whose capacity for evil
And wanton annihilation was exceeded only by a penchant
For self-aggrandizement and his rampant psychological instability

In many cases, the potential for ruination and domination that
Such entities may aspire to is constrained only
By their own physical and psychological limitations
As the toll which the dark mana takes upon the host's mind
And flesh is not insignificant

CENTURION DECIANUS VARUS: Alea iacta est! Emperor Publius Helvius Pertinax has fallen victim to the assassin's blade. As I stand gazing out across the massed ranks of our Pannonian legions, Septimus Severus duly strives to consolidate his newly acquired control of the Empire. Pescennius Niger is slain, his forces expelled from Cyzicus, Nicaea and Issus, and yet Clodius Albinus has sailed from Britannia and is raising an army in Gaul in his own bid to seize the throne. Severus intends to engage that northern host at Lugdunum once his campaigns here in the east are concluded. Behold Byzantium! We now prepare to lay siege to this ancient and splendoured city. Strangely, the order has been given that the Byzantine library is to be searched thoroughly following our victory. Rumour has it that Severus's aged soothsayer Angsaar is searching for a collection of arcane scrolls said to be of the utmost importance, scrolls which are reputed to be hidden somewhere here in Byzantium. Something about that wizened old shaman unnerves me... there is something strangely unnatural about him, something... sinister. Feh! What are those scrolls supposed to be called again?

Fragmentary delusional recollections from within the confines of Grimm's Hold Sanitarium: 
When Blackthorne returns from his expedition to Tiahuanaco and the Peruvian jungle I shall duly tell him of the catalyst which compelled me to those cursed black vaults in ancient Ur, should Hildebrandt allow me another visit. Yes... Giza, Karnak, Thebes... I see them now once more! In the grip of a waking dream, I walk those restless sands again. Egypt... here my journey began, and here I took the first steps towards destiny... and damnation.
(The events recounted here take place before ""The Dreamer In The Catacombs Of Ur"")

From the expeditionary journal of Doctor Ignatius X. Stone: 

Giza, Egypt (March 17, 1890)
The heat here is damnably oppressive, and all day the omnipresent sand has been whipped up by an impudent wind, making progress all the more difficult. At dawn, I pinpointed the location of the Great Pyramid's secret chamber which my old friend Professor Caleb Blackthorne and his benefactor Lord Blakiston had discovered several months previously, but ingress to its concealed depths was denied me by a partial collapse of the age old edifice's stone ceiling. Excavation is evidently impossible, lest more of the mighty tomb come crashing down about us. At any rate, Blackthorne has studied the incredible inscriptions within that hidden alcove exhaustively, and in truth my own interests lie elsewhere in this desolate sand-flayed landscape. The traditionalists believe that, in keeping with Egyptian tenets, only mundane things such as new air shafts and ever more ornate sarcophagi are yet to be discovered deep within the tunnel networks of these cyclopean monuments. Feh! If only they knew the true extent of this great cosmic puzzle! They are as fools who view a tapestry in a darkened room by the light of only one candle, seeing only small sections illuminated one by one, and refusing to recognize or connect the darkened and unseen areas to the entirety.
Working from the geometric calculations which I prepared before our arrival here, I have studied the alignment of Cheops, Chefren and Mykerinos. It is as I suspected. Tomorrow, I leave the the imperious and hoary mausoleum of Khufu and seek answers within the Great Temple of Karnak...

Karnak, Egypt (March 18, 1890) 
What oblations to the grim chthonic deities of the ancient world were once offered solemnly beneath the stygian skies of this sweltering place, I wonder? What sublime power awaits the aspirant, the querent who dares seek answers in those shadowed places where men of lesser fortitude fear to gaze? Blackthorne often berates me for what he calls my preoccupation with the arcane, the occult, the sinistrous lore of the chthonic... he insists no good will come of such delving into nighted realms. Ha! The path to elucidation is seldom devoid of thorns, the road to knowledge rarely free of perils! I seek enlightenment, and by the erudite tongue of Herodotus, I may have found it! Ancient tradition of this land has long spoken of strange flashes of light emanating from the depths of pyramid passages and temple catacombs. Over a thousand years ago the Arabs wrote of the transient walls and hidden chambers of these monuments; of secret doors moved by an unseen force and of implacable sentries who guarded the secrets of the temples with dour tenacity. What I found this evening gives credence to all that and more. Is the lore which I discovered carved into the ancient stone of Karnak's temple the next fragment of the cryptic conundrum which I have dedicated my life to solving? The Coptic papyrus states that, upon the walls of the pyramids and the temples were inscribed the mysteries of science, astronomy, geometry and physics; inscriptions of unknown peoples and lost civilizations whose lore was carved into the stone to preserve it from the ravages of the great deluge. The surviving knowledge of long forgotten antediluvian races! 
Aye, prudent Surid, heeding the warnings of his priests, erected certain repositories of long forgotten knowledge to withstand first a great flood, and then an all-consuming fire which was prophesied would come from the sky. Masoudi, in the tenth century, described automata; titanic guardians of stone and metal which were placed to guard the treasures and the entombed lore, and which were tasked to destroy all those deemed unworthy, all those who dared enter the chambers unbidden. I see them! The hoary sentinels of Karnak unfettered! Rising from their sandy tombs to smite the intruder, the raider and the interloper with righteous fury! And what is this... was there once a glimmer of life within the sightless stone eyes of the Theban guardian? Does the silent watcher at Giza even now descend from its granite dias to once more stalk the shifting sands on carven claws? Hu! Horem-akhet! 

 

The alignment of Cheops, Chefren and Mykerinos revealed,
Chthonic lore concealed in Khufu's imperious mausoleum,
By the erudite tongue of Herodotus, I have found the answers,
Arcane secrets inscribed in the ancient Coptic papyrus,
The Pyramid's legacy compells me to these dark discoveries,
The Theban guardian rises from its sandy tomb to meet us,
The Silent Watcher stalks, behold the Sentinels of Karnak!

Thebes, Egypt (March 19, 1890)
Niut-Ammon! Lucidity has reasserted its blessed hold upon me. I understand now the true nature of that knowledge which was revealed to me deep within the shadowed confines of Karnak's timeless temple. Telluric energy, harnessed by the ancients... triggered by lunar rays and solar radiation, channeled to impart static charges to rock strata and lines of natural power running through the earth. Neuro-electric energy generated, developed, creating light, separating inertia from gravity! And what more? The fourth state of matter, forged countless millennia ago in the hearts of burning stars... fettered, channeled, for creation and destruction! The secret of the great monuments of the ancients! Yes, secrets... answers. A rogue celestial body passes inside the orbit of the moon, becoming a captive of the earth's gravitational field. The world tilts upon its axis, its revolution slows, the planet shifts farther from its parent star... one of many such cataclysms. Asteroid strikes, floods, firestorms, the sky swathed in a veil of darkness through which the sun's light cannot pass, great ice-ages enshrouding the globe. And what is this? The forces of evil, of chaos... servitors of the sinister gods of the universe... manifesting upon the tellurian sphere? What dire agents of malignity were unleashed upon mankind? Bringers of carnage and destruction, pestilence and decay! The Z'xulth! 
Secrets once known by the forgotten peoples... ancient Atlantis... time-lost Lemuria... Hyperborea, Ultima Thule, utopian Atland and its enduring legacy. Fragments, memories... descendants... the Incas, the Aztecs, the Maya, the Egyptians, the Greeks, the Britons, the Frisians, the ancient Sumerians. Yes, it is clear to me, like a diamond worked to perfection in the skilled hands of a master craftsman. The sigils and glyphs I beheld carved into the ancient stone of Karnak (which I somehow understood implicitly), the visions I experienced within the temple, it is all quite clearly compelling me to the next stage in my grand voyage of enlightenment. According to the inscriptions, the truth, the key, awaits me within the ziggurats of ancient Sumeria. I hear the call of the ancients, beckoning me to that aeon-veiled place across the unforgiving sands. We shall depart at once. I feel sure I shall find that which I seek between the two rivers, at the place of the seven cities. Yes, I shall surely meet my destiny within the mystery-haunted catacombs of ancient Ur...

(From the pyramids of Egypt, to the ziggurats of Sumeria, my grand journey of enlightenment must continue. Praise the Ancients!) 

The Keeper of the Ancient Lore of Ur:
Hearken to the warnings of the Ancients... tread softly those sacred and unforgiving sands. Do not break the seal of the seventh city!

The Chief Cultist of Ur:
The Gate must not be opened. You dare not awaken the Dreamer!

Cuneiform tablets bear a grim, darkly portentous warning,
Sumerian catacombs astir with vile Chthonic horrors,
The lore of Babylon inscribed in stone as old as Atlantis,
Glyphs and sigils now compell me to the ziggurats...

In a waking dream, I hear the call of the Ancients. I shall find that which I seek between the two rivers, at the place of the seven cities... in the Catacombs of Ur!

The sights our eyes behold
Will open up our merging hearts
And feed our empty souls 
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever 
Without despair we will share
And the joys of caring will not be replaced
What has been must never end 
And with the strength we have won't be erased 
When the truths of love are planted firm
They won't be hard to find
And the words of love I speak to you 
Will echo in your mind

Feel the steel breeze
Maybe I've been kissed by angels
Ruby sky
The devil's playground maybe

I cannot compare to this
Beyond my wildest childhood wish
The grand design was never mine
This is what you made me

Rise above the chemical imbalance
If you're strong and if you're brave
Rise above the chemical imbalance
Are you master are you slave?

You're in two minds
Or are two minds in you?
And is this fractured life
The real thing or the flavour of?

Soul asylum inner space
The last eternal hiding place
I can't control what I don't own
This is what you made me

Baldwin Hawes,"There's a valley in Spain called Jarama
It's a place that we all know so well
It was there that we fought against the fascists
We saw a peaceful valley turn to hell

From this valley they say we are going
But don't hasten to bid us adue
Even though we lost the battle at Jarama
We'll set this valley free before we're through

We were men of a the Laken Battalion
We're proud of the fight that we made
We know that you people love the valley
We're remember a Laken Vrigade

From this valley they say we are going
But don't hasten to bid us adue
Even though we lost the battle at Jarama
We'll set this valley free before we're through

You will never find peace with these fascists
You'll never find friends such as we
So remember that valley of Jarama
And the people that'll set that valley free

From this valley they say that we are going
Don't hasten to bid us adue
Even though we lost the battle at Jarama
We'll set this valley free before we're through

All this world is like this valley called Jarama
So green and so bright and so fair
No fascists can dwell in our valley
Nor breathe in our new freedoms air

From this valley they say we are going
Do not hasten to bid us adue
Even though we lost the battle at Jarama
We'll set this valley free before we're through",Jarama Valley,1996

Hold your warm and tender body

Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me

I'll get along
You'll find another
And I'll be here

Yeah, it's the DJ Khaled, Khaled, Khaled
I do this for the projects
I got the mothafucking gutta on this track
I got the projects on this one

You have no idea why you started
But guess this is your final warning
And boy, we don't care who you calling
Nothing can save you now

Shotta youts will run up in your apartment
So unno betta mind where you walking
Goddamn man, can to your target
Nothing can save you know

See you dun push the wrong button
And cross the wrong line
Stepped on the wrong shoe
Muthafucka, it was mine

Time and time
They get me out the tandem
Me are da true, I traded mine in
For caveman king

You don't wanna fuck with
The Southside Gotcha boys
Y'all ain't know trill ass niggas
Y'all some boxy boys

And pull shots on boys
Scattered like a roach
And put that on the fifth
I'm the nigga you don't wanna approach

I was raised in the heart of the jungle
The belly of the beast
And this lick here sweet, I'm so flawed
You can put me on the front line
Ass back nicks, I don't represent the gun shy
Thing about the street life

Homie, I live, wear my heart on my sleeve
And niggas gotta fear life
From the bottom to the top, east to the west

'Cause I got a fucking fever
For all the evil Kinevel people
Who try to stunt

Call me Danny Glover

Shoot you people while you sleeping
The grim reaper is out to lunch
Nothing can save you now

Put holes in you mouth so you can't be found
And Khaled got my back
He gon' shoot a hundred rounds
So say hello to death
If you ever in my town

I came from the eggs of a goddess
And the balls of a gigolo
All I had was 2 ounces
An old Chevy and Figaro
Blood shed apart my feet

And bad vibes got a nigga rocking voodoo deep
Lord forgive me, I know not a better way
And pop has tried to stick me
Damn I need some better ye

Ring the alarm, tell 'em people come, come
Look at what the fuck the Briscgun, yeah
It's the final warning

Khaled, these niggas talking
I'm an orphin
And leave a hole in his head
Like a dolphin
Fuck a hole in one, ain't golfin'
I'ma put his whole unit in a coffin

'Cause any nigga fuck wit my pocket
I'ma open his ass off, like suicide doors
Any badass niggas, y'all scared of that lake

Nothing can save you now

I'm usually cool, but know I gotta bet back
I tried telling ya, ain't wit'cha death threats
I let my nigga know, tell 'em go hammer that
And it ain't gon' take all day

Motherfucka' here I come
Another victory for the crib
A couple more before I'm done
And if you asleep you better wake up
And get on your fuckin' job
Cause I'm takin' everything except a loss

And I be scared I might miss money

Santa Claus and all his elves
Are making gifts for Buford
I don't think that's how it goes
Nobody's askin' you, nerd

Buford, you're completely disrespecting this classic song
You're ignoring the historical context
King Wenceslas was a great man
You have no idea what this song is about
I know all about this song

The words were by an English guy
The music's Scandinavian
Wenceslas was five-foot-six
He kept his face unshaven

Though just a Duke throughout his life
He always ruled so justly
His kingly title was conferred
Upon him posthumously

Well, I stand corrected, you seem to have a lot of information
But if you know so much about it
Why do you not sing the original song?
I like my version better, it's about me

Buford should get lots of gifts
Every Christmas season
When I see presents just for me
It always is so pleasin'

That is why I changed the words
To make the song more edgy
If you don't like the way I sing
You'll get a Christmas wedgie

Fools all in the way with that econo-spray 
Need to take a few classes, learn about Manassas

Tellin' Penny that's the way to do it, baby represent ya home

And in the summertime we got the whole block blind 
Some busta in a primed out Pinto poppin' game 
Lying sayin' he goin' get the same thang

A plane dash for a crush, forever got you itchin' 
99.95, 30 day paint jobs 
Got niggaz ridin' round lookin' like a junk yard 
You need to pull a check, wheeler check, wheeler check 
Stack up on your grip, get your shit sprayed wet 
See most of these new paint jobs they don't do 
But if it ain't candy then the job ain't true 
 
Its reserved for them ballaz, who make that cheese 
It ain't candy if it didn't cost a couple of G's 
On your Jeep, your truck, your Chevy or your Lexus 
5th wheel on the grill like them playaz do in Texas 
My folks gettin' sideways in Vallejo 
Ballaz in Memphis slammin' shut the Cadillac doors 
Full of ink so blinked I could fly 
To a world where you have to roll candy or you die 
Descending, my mind goes back into reality 
To some, having candy paint is just a fantasy 
Custom leather everywhere you look is woodgrain'

Should I, would I, could I care
Should I, would I, could I love her

Before I met you, I couldnt get through
The day without thinking lifes unfair
I had no desire to aim higher and higher
As I wallowed in my deep rut of despair
Then came you, out of the blue
To cloud all my judgment with your face
Put my fingers on the edge of that slippery ledge
And I tried to lift myself out of that place...and I said

Left brain, right brain, somewhere in the middle
I'm spinning round and round my thoughts are playing second fiddle

Get yourself a plate
And I'm a step away
One hit, one breath away

Come so victory is here
We can celebrate

OK, I'm on my grizzle
On my grind
Go ahead try, top my shine
I'm on my way, anyday
Tell them niggas better have my cake

Have me laughin' all the way to the bank

Had the chop the top off that bitch
Just so they can see me baby

Victory is on the way
Khaled go in on 'em
Show 'em we gonna win homey
Get off in their skin homey
I've been getting in the streets over 10 years
So you think a nigga pussy cause his ear's pierced
Run up on a nigga if you want to
You gotta vest i gotta a shell that'll go through
Ball Greezy gettin' money like ya 'posed to
Good dope in the drop like soul food
Big Body, big rims on the old school
Stay fly like a hood nigga 'posed too
Lights off click clack in the pinto
Seat back, dick sucked in the Benzo
5 percent D-B's on the Renzo
No sleep, gotta eat, gotta get done

It's like I always say
Motherfucka' here I come
Another victory for the crib
A couple more before I'm done
And if you asleep you better wake up
And get on your fuckin' job
Cause I'm takin' everything except a loss
Iceburg goes off, yeah 24-7 I goes on
And I be scared I might miss money
So I don't doze off
I'm a snap and the streets know it
Trick told me keep goin'
An I'm a keep Chiefin' as long as God keep the weed growin'

I've been destined to shine
Won't take no for an answer

To autographin' titties

A wise speaker, a woman pleaser

I wear da crown
We da best, tell 'em fuck next

You got da cash, then show me
Better not be phoney
Get on my level
Cause they way below me

Girls ask me what my cologne is
Steel Khakis and Coronas
And I'm mackin' a donkey
Flip the 4 and a half
Do the vert and a left
Bet da Ave never seen banks chunky as dat
Why you got pressure?
Cause my Impala got pressure
Beating outside, shaking the dice on my dresser

Baloji,"Teach me how to fall in love
Want you to touch me baby

Ca y est ! Une interruption s'impose
Un coup de gaz dans ce rap à l'eau de rose
Mais pour lui un coup d'un soir, pour elle un coup du sort
Comment s'en sortir quand les liens se déteriorent ?
On s'est rapproché sur un collé-serré
Quart d'heure américain façon congolais
Tu joues avec le feu et ça me donne l'eau à la bouche
Mais quand j'ai voulu me tirer, tu as joué cette cartouche
Il y a des points d'interrogations dans tes « je t'aime »
Des fois, la vérité parle d'elle-même
Mentir ne sert à rien et puis ça me fout le blues
De faire de toi une mère, mais pas une épouse
Regards éberlués quand le testeur vire au bleu
Trouver une raison pour qu'on reste ensemble
Certains se créent des problèmes, d'autres s'en inventent
Quand tu m'as dit d'avoir une tombe dans le ventre
Je me suis senti coupable et misérable
Incapable de t'aimer après l'inconcevable

Give me a chance / give me a chance 
Don't want a distance
Teach me how to fall in love
Want you to touch me baby

Déjà, il y a les gestes qui ne trompent pas
Des regards qui ne trichent pas
Des mots maladroits
Si mes « je t'aime » attendent une réponse
Savoir si tu y renonces
Si tu es sûr de toi
Des « je te rappelle » qui veulent dire adieu
Pour être parents, il faut être deux
Les remords nous dévorent
Pour savoir qui a raison, qui a tort

Want you to touch me baby
Teach me how to fall in love
Want you to touch me baby

On se moquait des gens qui restaient ensemble par habitude
Même si tout les oppose, par peur de la solitude
Donc, par définition, tous les couples sont mixtes
C'est qu'à travers le compromis qu'ils existent
Tu m'as piégé avec tes putains de chantage
Comme un con j'en ai oublié mes protections d'usage
Hormis le sexe tout laisse à désirer
Quand la passion devient une obsession et l'amour de la charité
Donc j'ai refusé froidement
De donner mes sentiments contre un mariage blanc
Mais une histoire de cul, une histoire de chiffons
Une histoire de papiers rangés avec les torchons
On est des faiseurs d'ange qui se brûlent les ailes
A rêver comme dans les Sims d'une famille en pixel
300 euros pour se racheter une conduite
300 euros pour que l'on prenne la fuite",Coup de Gaz,2007

Où j'arrive De l'autre côté de la mère J'ai perdu pied en touchant le fond du problème
Avant de prendre le large Je voulais saluer ton courage, te rendre hommage 8 gamins à charge, ç'a de quoi plomber
Comme condamnée au congé de maternité T'as repris tes études, là où je les ai abandonnées Preuve qu'à 30 ans, la vie
peut recommencer Que tu n'es pas que la remplaçante de ta soeur Car comme elle, tu es unique, comme elle, tu es
exemplaire Mais il compare les femmes à des demeures, toi, tu es une résidence secondaire, ma mère une garçonnière
Derrière le mot « coutume » tout se justifie Il a pris ton innocence avec ton nom de jeune fille Mais ton dévouement
s'appelle du don de soi Donc sans remettre ici en cause ta foi Ce Seigneur que tu implores, en fait il est en toi Le seul
qui entend tes prières, le seul en qui tu crois

côté de la mère… J'ai perdu pied en touchant le fond du problème… De l'autre côté de la mère De l'autre côté de la
rive De l'autre côté de la mère Tout part à la dérive Quand la vie nous prive de repères
J'imagine la mère tellement paisible Qu'elle se confond avec le bleu du ciel J'imagine la mère imprévisible Sous forte
dépression comme le ciel Moi le fils au pair déboussolé Sans aucun repère sur la terre mère Je connais des tas d'autres
cas isolés Qui ont voulu donner chair à leurs chimères
Mais la peur me traverse à l'idée d'y aller Où j'arrive… De l'autre côté de la mère Loin de mes certitudes, loin de la
terre ferme Où j'arrive… De l'autre côté de la mère Mais la peur me traverse à l'idée d'y aller Où j'arrive… De l'autre
côté de la mère… J'ai perdu pied en touchant le fond du problème… De l'autre côté de la mère
Le courage de partir me manque alors j'ai jeté l'encre Comme si j'avais quelque chose à me convaincre Depuis que
cette lettre a fait apparition A renforcé mes sentiments pour ma mère d'adoption Moi le gosse qui volait dans son sac à
main Falsifiait sa signature dans ses bulletins À mentir pour un rien, patience volatile Elle m'a donné des valeurs
indélébiles Quand en tant que noir, on doit bosser 3 fois plus Que notre avenir est dans la Bible ou dans les syllabus
Qu'on ne sera jamais égaux, même à compétences égales Que si la liberté a un prix, c'est celui du minerval Vu d'ici,
l'Europe est un port de plaisance Où les porcs se dépensent le coeur à la place de la panse Mais c'est franchement
caricatural Comme les conseils des assistants sociaux Sur les familles monoparentales Celui qui reste, tient les 2 rôles
primordiaux Comme dos à dos
Mais la peur me traverse à l'idée d'y aller Où j'arrive… De l'autre côté de la mère Loin de mes certitudes, loin de la

Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",Lullaby of the Birdland,

Helping a fellow along,

The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,
The whole world smiles with you.
 
I used to worry,
I used to hurry,
Each time it started to rain,
Now I see light,
Learned wrong from right,
And you'll never hear me complain;

The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,

Let me walk to the edge with you, jump off of it, it
It sounds like your ready to, 'cause these rappers are terrible
And the game is unbearable but I'ma fix, fix

This feeling that's dead in you got your brains like a vegetable
Use the pro tools and tell 'em to edit it, it
Switch to somethin' that's better fool, turn it up what you better do

I'm sticking the middle finger up like the feeling's mutual baby
The franchise and they say that the future can't really trade me
In Houston, I'm number one like I'm in the place of McGrady

But keep on pacing it baby, the full truth has arrived
If they ask you about you nigga, you fin' to lie
They ask me about me and hear a truthful reply
They said they seem none better than me so hear the truth wit'cha eyes

Better go take over befo' it rains
'Cause I'd hate to say that I told you Mayne
I know, I know what you're gonna say
But have it your way

I know these haters is gonna hate
And I see that angry look on your face
Tell 'em sound of revenge is on the way
This isn't your day

Lookin' for the truth, they ask me where have you been?
Where have you been? Where have you been?
Getting ready for these haters, I got somethin' for them
Somethin' for them, somethin' for them

You're real quiet 'til you think you hear a sound in the wind
Sound in the wind, sound in the wind
You turn around 'cause you think you hear that sound once again
You hear that?
(Yeah what's that?)
That's The Sound of Revenge

See, I told you
That's what happens when you get on his bad side

Llovió melancolía en la calle Costa Rica
Dos señoras discuten en Alemán

Un perro andaba suelto en busca de comida 
Hoy se parece a mí buscando una melodía 
Un taxi paró frente a nosotros, bajaron dos muchachos rotos
Así está el día

Vuelan las palomas
Caen las últimas hojas

Una bicicleta a contramano se avecina
Cerca de la esquina hay dos chicos con mochilas 
Parecen mucho más livianas que la mía

El portero riega el cantero de su vida
Yo lo miro como casi todos mis días
Pero hoy la ausencia de tu amor
Se hace presente en la herida Y sigue el día

Caen como bloques
Uno a uno los golpes
Las sirenas, las alarmas
Enmudecen las palabras
Ni la tele, ni la radio
Ni mañana en los diarios
Todo aquí en mi cabeza
Como un film",18 De Abril,2017

Y se le borró la voz
A seguir que el mundo insiste
Para el que carga un dolor

Es hermoso el maquillaje
Que se corre cuando lloras
Que salpica cuando te vas
No hay una forma de decir adiós
Si el cielo es la distancia entre los dos
Y me pierdo
Si todavía te espero
La conciencia es como un río
Que recorre su interior
Que conecta los recuerdos
De un tiempo que fue mejor

Rezando en los templos del silencio para continuar
Encarnó la sombra de un tiempo que no va a parar
Cuando la tristeza no se pierde ni tiene un color
Queda en la galaxia de lo inexplicable

1.
Quand le soleil descend à l'horizon,
A Saïgon...
Les Elégantes s'apprêt'nt et s'en vont
De leurs maisons...
A petits pas, à petits cris,
Au milieu des jardins fleuris,
Où volent les oiseaux jolis
Au paradis...
Tendrement enlacés,
Se grisant de baisers,
Les amants deux par deux,
Cherchent les coins ombreux.

Sur la Rivière entendez-vous ces chants
Doux et charmants ?
Bateaux de fleurs ou les coupl's en dansant
Font des serments !
Pays de Rêve ou l'Étranger
Cherchant l'oubli de son passé,
Dans un sourire a retrouvé
La joie d'aimer...
Éperdu, le danseur
Croit au songe menteur,
Pour un soir de bonheur
On y laisse son coeur...

Je veux l'oubli...
Puisque de toi mon amour infini
Reste incompris...
L'opium endort les malheureux
Et les emporte jusqu'aux cieux
Dans un nuage merveilleux
De fumée bleue...
Dans le soir qui s'enfuit,
Loin des chants, loin du bruit,
Sur la natte, endormi,
Le Beau Rêve a repris...

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2000

Still can hear them now, urban laughter

Insane warcries all around, lost my legs and now I´m to the ground
Giant horses armed in red, with fire nostrils oh they never bled
Their ghoulish riders made of tar, crushed my head and turned my brain to jar

Bananarama,"Tossed into my mind, stirring the calm
You splash me with beauty and pull me down
You come from out of nowhere
My glance turns to a stare

Obsession rules me I'm yours from the start
I know you see me our eyes interlock
You come from out of nowhere
My glance turns to a stare

One minute here and one minute there
Don't know if I'll laugh or cry
One minute here and one minute there
And then you wave good-bye

Sifting to the bottom, every day for two
All energy funnels, all becomes you
You come from out of nowhere
My glance turns to a stare

So I'll drop by would that be cool

Makes me feel alright

Warm expression fills up all this space

Show me you care

What you gonna do there's no holding back

When you want to love just call me

What you gonna do when the love runs out 
Who's to blame 

So if we're falling can I turn your key

Will you reveal
