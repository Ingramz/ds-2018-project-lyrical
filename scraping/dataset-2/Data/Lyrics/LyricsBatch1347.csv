Brenton Banks,"I hadn't anyone till you,
I was a lonely one 'til you,
I used to lie awake and wonder if there could be
A someone in the wide world just made for me,
Now I see

I had to save my love for you, (I saved my love for you)
I never gave my love 'til you, (I saved it all for you)
And through my lonely heart demanding it,
Cupid took a hand in it,
I hadn't anyone till you.

I kept my love in secrecy,
I put it under lock and key,
I had to save my love for you!
I never gave my love away,
I waited for that lucky day
When I could give it to you

And through my lonely heart demanding it,
Cupid took a hand in it,
I hadn't anyone till you.",I Hadn't Anyone Till You,2001
Brenton Banks,"I remember sky
It was blue as ink
Or at least I think
I remember sky

I remember snow
Soft as feathers
Sharp as thumb tacks
Coming down like lint
And it made you squint
When the wind would blow

And ice like vinyl
On the streets
Cold as silver
White as sheets
Rain like strings
And changing things
Like leaves

I remember leaves
Green as spearmint
Crisp as paper
I remember trees
Bare as coat racks
Spread like broken umbrellas

And parks and bridges
Ponds and zoos
Ruddy faces
Muddy shoes
And light and noise and
Bees and boys
And days

I remember days
Or at least I try
But as years go by
They're a sort of haze
And the bluest ink
Isn't really sky
And at times I think
I would gladly die
For a day of sky",I Remember Sarah,2001
Brenton Banks,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now,2001
Brenton Banks,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Lullaby of Birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",Lullaby of Birdland,2001
Brenton Banks,"Isn't it rich?
Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground,
you in mid-air.
Where are the clowns?

Isn't it bliss?
Don't you approve?
One who keeps tearing around,
one who can't move.
Where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns.

Just when I'd stopped
opening doors,
finally knowing 
the one that I wanted was yours,
Making my entrance again,
with my usual flair,
Sure of my lines,
no one is there.

Don't you love farce?
My fault, I fear.
I thought that you'd want what I want 
sorry, my dear.
And where are the clowns?
Quick, send in the clowns.
Don't bother, they're here.

Isn't it rich?
Isn't it queer?
Losing my timing this late
in my career?
And where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns.
Well, maybe next year",Send in the Clowns,2001
Brenton Banks,"Speak low when you speak, love
Our summer day withers away too soon, too soon
Speak low when you speak, love
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift, we're swept apart, too soon
Speak low, darling, speak low
Love is a spark, lost in the dark too soon, too soon
I feel wherever I go that tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here and always too soon
Time is so old and love so brief
Love is pure gold and time a thief
We're late, darling, we're late
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends too soon, too soon
I wait, darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me, speak love to me and soon",Speak Low,2001

Brenton Dowe,"The neon haze of city lights  
The tribal sound of marching feet  
Cuts through the gloom on cold dark nights  
The tired and homeless roam the streets  
The sirens wail the engines roar  
A shadowed man just glances around  
A victim of life's mindless toil  
Lies cold and helpless on the ground  
  
The window dummies silent stare  
Bear witness on the nights  
If they could move  
What it would proved  
To see them all take flight  
  
The neon haze of city lights  
The tribal sound of marching feet  
Cuts through the gloom on cold dark nights  
The tired and homeless roam the streets  
The walls shout loud with angry words  
The people air their views  
The poor can scream but no-one hears  
The concrete jungle sings the blues",Silent Witness,2002
Brenton Dowe,"Put your hand in the hand of the man
Who stilled the water
Put your hand in the hand of the man
Who calmed the sea
Take a look at yourself
And you can look at others differently
Put your hand in the hand of the man
From Galilee

My momma taught me how to pray
Before I reached the age of seven
When I'm down on my knees
That's when I'm closest to heaven
Daddy lived his life, two kids and a wife
Well you do what you must do
But he showed me enough of what it takes
To get me through, oh yeh!

Put your hand in the hand of the man
Who stilled the water

Brenton Wood,"If you do want me, gimme little sugar
If you don't want me, don't lead me on girl

Brenton Wood,"Darlin', if I sat down and I wrote a song,
I would know where every word belongs
'Cause I'd write my song about you.
Darlin', if I tried to paint a work of art,
All the colors would pour from my heart

Two times I'm a loser

We can win a trophy

C'mon you boys in green, Ireland's bouncing back again
We have got our Trap, the cat is in the sack

Bate your bodhrán loud and learn your Polish grammar

Hired a camper van, picked it up in Warsaw,
Been so close before, hopes slammed in the door

Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath 

And when I awoke I was alone

Yo, we walk the path, ring the bell, best of the best
And we ready to blast, quick, fast, handed the task
Can finish 'em off, at any cost
No rules, just according to laws
Yo, came to win, ain't looking for friends
Just to do what we gotta to be champions
Like stompin' again and again, to defeat
Cause to know victory you gotta know defeat
It's survival of the fittest and we playin' for keeps
Deep in beef, the word on the streets is war
And it's my duty to keep it raw and lay the law
And if they act up, throw 'em in the figure four
Yo, we met with Hart, they tried to play the part
Of the big dogs who don't bark, hear the roar
Red One split 'em up, hit 'em up and make sure
That they don't come around here no more

[Bret Hart]
Without a doubt
I am the best there is
The best there was
And the best there ever will be

[Misfit]
Yeah, you heard the shit
We hit hard and move intelligent
In the squared circle, like my shadow when it's time to scream at y'all
On that ass, I'm too fast
You're only save outside the ropes
You lost hope, tellin' me you can't cope
Ain't got the skills, so sound the bell, the bout is finished
Hittin' missiles, you can't beat the best, get out the busines
You couldn't pin a cushion with a needle
Your attempts is feeble
I lock a submission make you tap fast in front of these people
In record time, climb the ropes, stand up drop kick
To add insult to injury, make sure you feelin' me
See we, come to entertain and wreck shop
And send a message to you suckers as we stand on top
Don't bite what you can't chew, don't challenge what you can't do
Cause when it comes down to heart, I got the power of two
Pumpin' adrenaline, shit kicker, known veteran
Stompin' my comp', at any grudge match, I'll make 'em try again
That's my motto, you better all play in the lotto
'Cause steppin' to my title, boy you end up broke and sorrow
So practisce today, come back years from tomorrow
And I'll be at the top waitin', just to let you know that

Ring the bell, ready for war, watch how we lay that

Stamina rocks, even though the lungs' cloudy
Still first place, gold belt 'round the waist
Tag team champs, here to deal wit' ya case

[Misfit]
Yeah, best of the best
No arguments, I put it to rest
Step into the ring, you pick up your chest
When it comes time to flex, you ain't got nothing left
No game, no fame, no name, just left a torn mess

So I suggest, that you watch your step
Watch your talk, watch who you disrespect

And watch who you team with, 'cause you'll need it

A letter that I wrote what you mean to me
Words I wished I'd said,
Were still in my head, now I pray you'd see

I don't know how to tell you that I miss you, baby
I struggle with the words sometimes
But in my heart, I know you'll find

[Chorus:]
I know, you know 
Our souls will be together till the end of time
You know, I know
Your love is gonna meet me on the other side
As sure as the angels come down and take my breath away
I love you'd be the last thing I'd ever say

I'd ever say....
You walked beside me, 
you stood by me and got me through my darkest times
And now I close my eyes
and visualize your face for the last time

I didn't know how to tell you that I loved you baby
I struggle with the words sometimes
But in my heart, I know you'll find

I never fell in love, 
no one ever touched me like this before
You opened my eyes
made me realize something worth living for

Solo (guitar and piano)
But if fate took you from me before I got to let you know
You're the one thing in my life worth dying for
If the world fell apart,
I know in my heart
I know would never change
If the devil himself 
tried to raise hell's bells
I know it would be in vain
If the heavens come down

Let 'em take my breath away

I got an agent for the publicity
An accountant to count my royalties
The talk shows want me, sorry I can't go
I'm stuck here on death row

You call me Hannibal Lechter, if I was smarter
If I was Charlie Manson you'd make me a martyr wouldn't ya
You'd call me a handsome man if I was Bundy
But if I looked like John Wayne Gasey you'd just say I'm funny, not ha ha funny

Tried to act my career just flopped
Killed my neighbor, got on Cops
Problem is, I only made one show now
I'm stuck here on death row

The poor victim's families never make a dime
Networks say I'm not prime time
All my cell mates on my cell block
Say I'm the hottest topic at the coffee shops

Waitress cries, ""God how they should free me""
Send me her love letters, says someday she'd really love to meet me
Tells her customers people should forgive me for the things I do
I wonder if I kill her would her family forgive me too?

The taxpayer's dollars that you spend on me
Thanks for the good meal, dry bed, and these warm clothes

Packed in a suitcase by her feet

And the days seemed longer

I can feel their pain

If I had lost my life, left behind my wife and

If I could only look down on her
How would she explain
That daddy had to go away

Forgive me if I smile it?s just to hide my fears
And in a time of dying our life becomes so clear
They say the good Lord works
In such mysterious ways
I just hope he gives me one more day

One more day to look into her eyes
One more moment to say goodbye, goodbye
One more night to feel her touch
Just one more chance so I could tell her
How much I miss her, tell her I love her

I fall from grace
Someone to need me, someone to believe me

Bret Michaels,"Story 
When I wrote the lyrics to Something to Believe 
In it truly was the hardest lyrics I ever had to write. 
It was a time in my life that, uh, 

When Kimo passed away it was just such a devastating time 
And I remember being home at the Christmas break 
And I went upstairs into my sister Nicole's room and I just wrote these lyrics 
And they just poured out of me and it turned into many different things 

And it was my way of releasing all that pain. 
Rikki and Bobby and C.C. allowed me to just keep the song the way it was 
Which I'm very thankful for and a very good friend of ours, 
Bruce Fairburn, who produced this song just let it the way it was. 

He loved it and it was beautiful and also, 
Bruce Fairburn had recently passed away, 
So this song, while doing this really, really means a lot to me.

Song (5:18)
Will I see him on the TV
Preachin' 'bout the promised land
He tells me to believe in Jesus
And steals the money from my hand

Some say he was a good man
But Lord I think he sinned, yeah

Twenty-two years of mental tears
Cries a suicidal Vietnam vet
Who fought a losing war on a foreign shore
To find his country didn't want him back

Their bullets took his best friend in Saigon
Our lawyers took his wife and kids, no regrets
In a time I don't remember
In a war he can't forget

He cried ""Forgive me for what I've done there
'Cause I never meant the things I did""

And give me something to believe in
If there's a Lord above
And give me something to believe in
Oh, Lord arise

My best friend died a lonely man
In some Palm Springs hotel room
I got the call last Christmas Eve
And they told me the news

I tried all night not to break down and cry
As the tears rolled down my face
I felt so cold and empty 
Like a lost soul out of place

And the mirror, mirror on the wall
Sees my smile it fades again

Sometimes I wish to God I didn't know now
The things I didn't know then

Like bodies in an open grave
Underneath the broken old neon sign
That used to read JESUS SAVES

A mile away live the rich folks
And I see how they're living it up
While the poor they eat from hand to mouth
The rich is drinkin' from a golden cup

And it just makes me wonder
Why so many lose, so few win

In the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together

Just like every night has its dawn

Has he ever felt like this?
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I could've let you know somehow

I can still feel so much pain
Like the knife that cuts you, the wound heals
But the scar, that scar remains

I know I could have saved our love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of makin' love we both
Made our separate ways

But now, I hear you've found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife

Just like every night has its dawn

When you cry I'll dry the tears for you
Through the years, through the pain
Times of heartache, times of change
I'll be your sun you be my rain

If I ever let you down, I didn't mean to do that
If you need me and I'm not around, I am sorry for that
Sometimes life is strange, some days it pulls me away from you
But on my soul I swear, for you I will be there to

Give you love, give you strength
Get you through your darkest days
When you cry I'll dry the tears for you
Through the years, through the pain
Times of heartache, times of change
I'll be your sun you be my rain

You are my flesh, you are my blood
And I will always stand by you, I will
And should the sun go down, give me your hand
I'll pull you through, I will, you know I'll be the one to

Give you love, give you strength
Get you through your darkest days
When you cry I'll dry the tears for you
Through the years, through the pain
Times of heartache, times of change
I'll be your sun you be my rain

Give you love, give you strength
Get you through your darkest days
When you cry I'll dry the tears for you
Through the years, through the pain
Times of heartache, times of change

Bret Michaels,"I like the way you move
Oh it's just so sexy baby
I like the way you grind my gears
Just kinda wrecks me baby
Tell you the truth
I like the way you move

I like the, I love the, I like the way you feel
When you're riding beside me baby
I like the way you grab my wheel
And just kinda guide me baby
I tell you the truth
I really like your moves

When she turns my radio on
I know it won't be long
And then she straddles the driver seat
And she, and she, and she'll roll right outta me

She says roll me up and down this highway baby
She was born to ride high like a rolling stone oh yeah
She wants it a little bit faster
So baby if you ask her
She said take me on that highway outta here

Play guitar now

Oh I like the way you move
Oh I like the thing you do

She'd say
Roll me up and down this highway baby
She was born to ride high like a rolling stone oh yeah
Cos when she's in my car
She's my superstar
My girl looks so fine
I tell her true
I love the way she",Driven [Rock Mix],2010
Bret Michaels,"We both lie silently still
In the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together
We feel miles apart inside

Was it somethin' I said or somethin' I did?
Did my words not come out right?
Though I tried not to hurt you
Though I tried but I guess that's why, they say

Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its, yeah, it does

I listen to my favorite song

Hear the D.J. say
""Love's a game of easy come and easy go""

But I wonder, does he know
Has he ever felt like this?
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I could've let you know somehow

I guess, every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorns

Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like the knife that cuts you, the wound heals
But the scar, that scar remains

I know I could have saved our love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of makin' love we both
Made our separate ways

But now, I hear you've found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife

Early in the morning
I rise up to the street
Got me that cigarette
And I scratch shoes on my feet
Got to find the reason
A reason things went wrong
Got to find a reason
Why my money's all gone
I got a damnation
I can still get high
I can pay this guitar like a mother truck ride dick

Life is two shots of love
The one you got
Cuz you might give it up
Or you might get shot
Never stop static
I gotta skin it out of my chest

Take all your money give it to charity

Aiyyo, I've been kickin murder - since Adidas with thick strings

Four finger rings, black belts with brass names

I'm a hard knock kiddo, always played the middle
Threw flacks in the crack game, getchu if I can getchu
Since a buck, played the highway, dodgin the troop boys
Jumpin in and out of Coupes, wavin for Duke boys
Always chased a penny, copped quarter waters
Tried to make a dollar chased my pop's boss daughters
Tryin to make my name, global, in all four corners
Philly baller, gamin in all four quarters
Never worked, never will - all my hoes buy my clothes
I can't go broke, never will - all my bros buy my O's

When gats is raised in, fascination blastin and blazin
Evacuation for your whole staff there's gas in the tank and
Gets back abrasions from cap grazin, defy gravitation
Pull my shit back squeeze bust it like masturbation
Hold fort, hold the blow torch, leave your soul scorched
with no remorse, the state of New York, get your shit caught
When niggaz hawk, let the fifth talk

Bein left for dead, tied up, smoke 'til I was dried up
So high up, seem like the sky ducked, high what?
Life was rough, but now it's nothin to hide
Used to click and be quick to put this gun to yo' side
Be like, ""That chain nice - I like that pal.
Matter fact {*click click*} I'd like that now.""
You've got game? Call the name, just spell the name right
Brett, one of the best rappers ever to touch a mic
It's prophecized I'd write, spit scriptures mind blowin
'til my coffin top close and heaven skies open
Fear no man's my slogan, I hope why'all believe
I'm just like you, fear nuttin human that bleeds
My mind breed two movies, six ab-lums, a hundred poems
Thirty R&B joints, I'm beyond the norm, why'all just mad
I'm just glad, got my time to shine
why'all the type to hit three hundred bars and run out of rhymes

We ass lacin top bodies and half in the basement

When gats is raised in, fascination blastin and blazin
Evacuation for your whole staff there's gas in the tank and
Gets back abrasions from cap grazin, defy gravitation
Pull my shit back squeeze bust it like masturbation
Hold fort, hold the blow torch, leave your soul scorched
with no remorse, the state of New York, get your shit caught
When niggaz hawk, let the fifth talk
So tell me who's the next man to flip?
I stop the beef shit, with rubber handled grips
Your candle get lit, guerilla shit feed us banana clips
The hammers hit, anything in our range we dismantle it

Neither could comfort you from the wild unknown
So bury your burning hatred like a hatchet in the snow

Find something to hold onto until they go
To help you through the hard nights like a flask filled with hope

Dynasty shattered and stolen

And I watched machines print a paper economy
I saw my own self stand right in front of me

And prescription pills mingling in the mezzanine
With a whole wealth of doctors and pharmaceutical companies
Still poor people were dying from disease

Brett Dennen,"So long my misery
I don't need you, you've only caused me grief
Forgive me if I fall asleep
I haven't slept in centuries

Daylight lives like a burden for me
So I escape the sins strewn about the streets
Beyond the ruins of my ancestry
Five pairs of pages of my disbelief

I rose from my moat like a ghost from a grave
Sunken in the salty eyes of the wandering into space
I was heading though the mists across the Golden Gate
All of my rebellions fall in to the falling fate

So long my misery
I don't need you, you have only caused me grief
Forgive me if I fall asleep
I haven't slept in centuries

Springtime came again and it caressed and fell
I flew past the numb lib nuns who never tell
The secrets of the sailors and their seven years spell
I will not fall, nor will my wings ever melt

If I could, I would wash all these wounds away
I would surround your room with a sinner mans grace
I would paint your portrait over everything mundane
More colorful than Easter Sunday

So long my misery
I don't need you, you have only caused me grief
Forgive me if I fall asleep
I haven't slept in centuries

Put me on a boat and lead my inhibitions at bay
My mind is spinning but I haven't much to say
I was running through the canyons
The echoes of your name
You were laughing at me like the sun laughs at the flames

Put me on a page in a book of beginnings
Let me scroll through old volumes of age and teachings
Let me revel all of these forgotten feelings
Lay me with the wretches in the arms of my queen

So long sweet misery
I don't need you, you've only caused me grief
Forgive me if I fall asleep
I haven't slept in centuries

So long sweet misery
I don't need you, you've only caused me grief
Forgive me if I fall asleep

From the cradle to the grave, it never ends

So many ways to walk upon the earth
I trace my footsteps to the place of my birth
So what do you do with all your precious time
So many ways, in which to reach for the sky

Dancing on the tip of your tongue

Brett Dennen,"When I heard the news, my heart fell on the floor
I was on a plane on my way to Baltimore
In these troubled times it's hard enough as it is
My soul has known a better life than this

I wondered how so many could be in so much pain
While others don't seem to feel a thing
Then I curse my wiseness and I get so damned depressed
In a world of suffering, why should I be so blessed?

I heard about a woman who lives in Colorado
She built a monument of sorts behind her garage door
Where everyday she prays for all whom are born
And all whose souls have passed on

Sometimes my trouble gets so thick
I can't see how I'm gonna get through it
But then I would rather be stuck up in a tree
Than be tied to it

I know
There is so much more

I don't feel comfortable with the way my clothes fit
I can't get used to my body's limits
I got some fancy shoes to try and kick away these blues
They cost a lot of money but they aren't worth a thing

I wanna free my feet from the broken glass and concrete
I need to get out of this city
Lay upon the ground and stare a hole in the sky
Wondering where I go when I die, when I die

'Cause her boy left home home in a hurry again
Her photograph was fading
She keeps a box in a closet for the maid

I had to lay down my love
My burdens are my own

When I had the urge to leave
I went out to find my muse
Beneath in my pocket and I'm craving for some
Hey Jim Blues, what you said

I was following my fall leaves
When I saw her aboard the River Queen
I was courting my Creole lady
All the way to New Orleans

But I was soon, my woman is true
So I climbed the roof and gave that woman my crew
I had to her all I know
My business is my own

Oh, soon you're gonna have to give in
No, you can't live forever the way that you been, oh

I had to learn this is the way I get along

Brett Dennen,"He was born in the summer of his 27th year, 
Coming home to a place he'd never been before.
He left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again,
You might say he found a key for every door.
When he first came to the mountains, 
His life was far away on the road and hanging by a song.
But the strings already broken and he doesn't really care,
It keeps changing fast, and it don't last for long.

And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high, 
I've seen it raining fire in the sky.
The shadows from the starlight are softer than a lullaby.
Rocky Mountain high, Colorado. 
Rocky Mountain high.

He climbed cathedral mountains, 
He saw silver clouds below,
He saw everything as far as you can see.
And they say that he got crazy once and he tried to touch the sun,
And he lost a friend, but kept the memory.
Now he walks in quiet solitude, 
The forest and the streams, seeking grace in every step he takes.
His sight is turned inside himself, to try and understand
The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake.

And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high, 
I've seen it raining fire in the sky.
You can talk to God and listen to the casual reply.
Rocky Mountain high, Colorado. 
Rocky Mountain high.

Now his life is full of wonder, 
But his heart still knows some fear,
Of a simple thing he can not comprehend.
Why they try to tear the mountains down to bring in a couple more,
More people, more scars upon the land.

And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high, 
I've seen it raining fire in the sky.
I know he'd be a poor man if he never saw an eagle fly,
Rocky Mountain high, the Colorado Rocky Mountain high,

Take a look in the five-and-ten, it's glistening once again

Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of hop-along boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

Hallelujah
Or maybe it's just better I don't know
How it's gonna end or how it's gonna go

Regrets and mistakes
And all the hearts that I did break
Will I ever get to see my grandma's face
With all the hell that I have raised?
I know she's up there
Shakin' her head & sayin' a prayer
Am I breakin' up or am I clear?
When I hang up do You just disappear?

Could you hand off the phone to my Uncle Joe?
He'd tell me if the streets are really paved with gold
Hallelujah
With both sides on their knees down to the end
How do You choose who's gonna lose & win?
Good at talkin'
Maybe I should be listenin'
Oh is this real or just a dream?
Yeah

Yea, the rains gonna fall on us all
Your hearts gonna break sometimes
But theres no way around it, lifes full of mountains
Youre gonna have to climb
But there aint no crime in crying
You just gotta keep on trying
So remember, no matter what youre going through
Tough times dont last
Tough people do

Baby its been all smooth sailing since we fell in love
But lately weve been on a rocky road
But if I know you like I think I do
You aint giving up
And there aint no way in this world Im letting go

We been making music since we were kids
Its all I want to do, for life
Keeping it real until the day I die
I stay funkish in my way
Continue to mash and don't forget to pray
I keep my hand on my steel

If ever they decide to kill
You better be prepared 'cause I know I will

As well as the niggas that I kick it with
They stick you faster than these bitches will
Since I'm pimping everybody wants my riches
And I can't keep my god for buying weed acting every time
I smoke constantly and can't flinch me
From committing the murders so I chill and puff the herb
Who gots my back nobody
If little giant gaudy laying niggas down at the homey's party
Always be goin crazy I guess we are being who we are
Really say the nigga gotta be a star
I gots to get mine and if I'm blasting its my destiny
If I die then it was meant to be intentionally

If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,

Asleep on his shoulder, but still she's alone

There's no real place we call home

A town we all know well
And every sunday evening
In her home I'd dwell
We went to take an evening walk
About a mile from town
I picked a stick up off the ground
And I knocked that fair girl down
She fell down on her bended knees
For mercy she did cry
""Oh Willy, dear, don't kill me yet
I'm unprepared to die""
She never spoke another word
I only beat her more
Until the ground around me
With her blood did flow
I took her by her golden curls
And I dragged her 'round and 'round
Throwing her into the river
That flows from Knoxville town
Go down, go down, you Knoxville girl
With your dark and roving eyes
Go down, go down, you Knoxville girl
You can never be my bride
I started back to Knoxville
Got there about midnight
My mother, she was worried
She woke up in a fright
Saying, ""Dear son, what have you done
To bloody up your clothes?""
I told my anxious mother
That I was bleading in my nose
I called for me a candle
And I called for me a bed
And I called for me a handkerchief
To bind my aching head
I rolled and thrashed the whole night through
All horrors I did see
The devil stood at the foot of my bed
Pointing his finger at me
They carried me down to Knoxville
And put me in a cell
My friends all tried to get me out
But none could grow my bail
I'm here to waste my life away
Down in this dirty old jail
Because I murdered that Knoxville girl

I gotta get outta town

If it's shining then I'm near it
It's designer then I wear it, uh
Look at these diamonds spend some time on my appearance
You too busy saving hoes you ain't gonna find a dime on clearance
You know me bitch I get straight down to the point
Pop another bottle roll another joint
And all of my niggas OG's and all of that smoke is OG
I'm way too high to be low key
Better act like you know me

[Chorus]

Girl if you wanna get some drunk then cutie it come and get it from me
I know I shouldn't mix all this vodka with this Hennessy
But we gon' get fucked up then pour it up drink beer
Party like there's not a night put a one night before that bitch
We don't sleep until we get sick we gon' blaze till we get licked
Call Earl the world spinning talking jail we winning
The girl that you love is good in the beginning
Two good shots and not a girl singing
Spinning over now I'm sober face breasts
More murrr
Line out two shots and I'm down six darker light but that shit don't mix
Got a body bag full of pills and shit let's see how fucked up we all gon' get

Brew,"My fist or this pistol nose
Tip on your grill so quick you'll be missing those
Pearly whites I take early flights
Here's some advice: quit ya fuckery
Is it Lacoste or a Polo night?
Man that's cool yous a boss, I'm a prototype
Solamente wordsmith touch the gente
Bars for so many I'm an honorary sensei

Things I never thought about
Trying to be elusive and the process get forgot about
No doubt I don't think about it, write it down
Look what you made me do (the birds flew)
On my side of town I'm known to be truth
Got the right light inside of the booth
I see it all like a view from the roof
Gray and gray are both acceptable off liquor I'm loose
They clocking me but I don't watch what replicas do

There's so much evidence that we set a precedence
For Southern California residents
I give you this inheritance of
Real rap jewels in the form of amphetamines

What's the difference from take-out and delivery? (what?)
Serve 'em at the spot or we bring it to them literally (yup)
And it'll be a cold day in hell
If you hear about the evidence that Everett fell

Fade one, fade two, fade three
No matter how many tell 'em come see we
Fade one, fade two, fade three
No matter how many tell 'em come see we

Who wanna see a RSE emcee?
E to the V, off the mast a leaf in the tree
All you gotta do is give Evie a chance
And I'm gonna light my plants

Things I always thought about
Trying to get my kids everything that they thought about
I'm advance man I'm running routes (with runners)
NFL scouts talk about
Proverbial I'm Nazareth
Black Jesus with words for infidels and hazardous
Individuals who underestimate Los Angeles
Savages hear to take away your advantages

I put my heart in everything I spit for analysts
Still Los Angeles with candles lit and cannabis
Where I'm at, what I'm doing
Left off the old rocks and old ruins
The wait is over influence
Never knew it going off stupid biz music
My greatest shit is my latest shit, go 'head and loop it
Still make a killing for an underground rapper
Water flows runny like nose of coke trappers

Fade one, fade two, fade three
No matter how many tell 'em come see we
Fade one, fade two, fade three
No matter how many tell 'em come see we",Runners,2018

Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you

Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you

How did I guess that the long loneliness was past.
I merely looked at you and I knew that I knew.

Now and forever and when forever's done
You'll find that you are still the one

Please don't say no to my plea

Brewer & Shipley,"There must be some kind of way out of here
Said the joker to the thief, yeah
There’s too much confusion
Mmm I can’t get no relief

Business men, they drink my wine
Plowman dig my earth
None were level on the mind
No one up at his word

Yeah, I see jokers on my left, thieves upon my right
You’d find me in the middle if I picked a different life
Before my name started tripling in size
But I’m still showing signs all attributed to mine
In the pitch black, it’s too cold
I’m all alone take me back to the roads
I had to roam to get here and I’ll hitch back
Get a cab to my mother’s house
See my old man and grab a six pack
Tell my brother I love him
And give him something that will see him through the hard times
What’s a brother for?
When i’m sick of this life I see
It has to be my family who lift me off the floor
Make sense of all the madness in a world full of money
Full of tears, full of war
I was a plowman and worked from the earth up
Save your wine for the entrepreneurs

Well all along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants, too
Outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl (like a failed man I worked from the earth up)
Two riders were approaching
And the wind begins to howl ('cause your world is the same as mine)

Pour more blood in your cup
Take a sip full of sin and let your taste buds savour the buzz
The flavour of an ill-mannered nature
That lingers on as animals in all of us
Trying to fight for the right to live a life
But some will never win though that’s why they live a lie
I don’t think I’ll ever win
All of this is anything
When I die I hope a brother’s at my side
There’s no trap door, or get out clause
The world can be your oyster or a set of jail doors
You’ve seen mine, I think it’s time I see yours
I bet you that we’ve been scarred by the same swords
So we are not so unalike
Apart from the fact I live my life in the light and now i’m trapped in it
The way I feel within a few years time
I might have a couple kids and just forget I ever wrote lyrics

Well all along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants, too yeah
Outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind begins to howl

Take away the treasure of a man
Convinced that he holds heaven in his hands
Even though I ain’t religious i’m a little superstitious
Maybe there is a promised land
But will I make it or not is a different matter
I’ve been a joker, I’ve been a thief, I’ve been a rapper
I’ve been the only enemy that I can never beat
Give me a piece of mind upon a platinum platter

Well all along the watchtower
Princes kept the view oh oh oh
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants, too yeah
Outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind begins to howl",All Along the Watchtower,2004

Wipe away your sins like I’ve done mine
And the people then they’ll be equals
There’s too many sinkholes we’ve left behind

I’m losing my religion
I’ve realized I wasn’t built for these conditions

Yeah
I gave up my all
When I felt lost not a one of ya’ll called
When I took off everybody else stalled
I don’t really understand what ya’ll on
What ya’ll want
I can’t live, can’t be free
I can’t be here
Gave my sweat gave my tears
Gave up all the best of my years
I done gave everything
I ain’t gained anything
Just pain and more sadness
Just broad strokes and blank stares
No details and no canvas
Nah I ain’t livin' for your love
Case dismissed I don’t need another judge
I done got everything off my chest
But I got one more thing to confess

So I'mma leave religion for a relationship
Never sell my soul I'mma sell my ship
I failed you all because I failed to help
Just know I failed myself
But faith keeps me from folding
It’s all I got left I’m left here with no one
I ain’t choose You but You say I’m chosen

I lost my religion but I found God
Sounds odd but I’m better at seeing how far
Did I come from the dark is the nights to the light
Irregardless of all of my many flaws

Guilty of so many crimes

To someone so cultured

He takes my soul, body and mind

To the trenches we dug?

How many fingers?

Sit and wait.

You make this look good, 
You make it look so good, 
Dressed up in riot gear for a prat fall good for profit. 
We claimed the product in the name of tragedy, 
Were so dramatic. 
Now I'm after pyramids, 
What would you rig that with plastic explosives and trip wire? 
And if we lost our arms, 
And lost our voice 
Could we trick ourselves- 
That we killed ourselves.

The apple of my daddy's eye

Sometimes I'm all alone and don't c him
I wish it was different but I don't care

He likes it when I dance
But he doesn't like it when I raise my voice 2 him
I try 2 stop but I can't

Somebody that appreciates a sexy groove
And a old school melody
When God, his son and the love of family
Ruled in the community
The songs you sing
Lift you up to heaven
A heaven we can believe in

Everybody's talkin' about hard times
Like it just started yesterday
People eye know they've been strugglin'
At least it seems that way
Fat cats on Wall Street
They got a bailout
While somebody else got to wait
Seven hundred billion but my old neighborhood
Ain't nothing changed but the date

Ain't nothing ever come from complaining
Except a bitter heart, that's true
Follow along and you gon wanna do

They used to mean somethin'
Now every other one is just mean
Rather than reminisce I'm telling you this
It's time for a brand new scene

Everybody's sinkin' in the quicksand
Created by the keeper of time
Cast aside by using ancient tricks
That changes your state of mind

Call me old fashioned
But back in the day
There wasn't no shorties in sight

First come job then come marriage 
Before shorty come out with the baby carriage 
Call me old fashioned 
Just clap yo hands just clap yo hands

You win some, you lose some

Yes I do

"Brian ""San"" Thompson","Some ask us how
How can we sing in a strange land
They can't seem to comprehend
They don't understand
That the message in our soul
Is from the heart
Doesn't matter how near
Doesn't matter how far

If there be one that is touched
By the things that we do
Then we're satisfied
Satisfied
And we did what we came to do

Then we'll rejoice amongst ourselves

Brian & Ellen Godula,"Wynken, Blynken and Nod one night
Sailed off in a wooden shoe,
Sailed on a river of crystal light
Into a sea of dew

Where are you going
And what do you wish
The old man asked the three
We've come to fish
For the herring fish
That swim in the beautiful sea
Nets of silver and gold have we
Said Wynken, Blynken and Nod

So all night long
Their nets they threw
To the stars in the twinklin' foam
Then down from the sky
Came the wooden shoe
Bringing the fisherman home

'Twas oh so pretty
A sail it seemed
As if it could not be
And some folks thought
'Twas a dream they'd dreamed
Of sailing the beautiful sea
But I shall name you
The fisherman three
Wynken, Blynken and Nod

Wynken and Blynken
Are two little eyes
And Nod is a weary head
And the wooden shoe
That sailed the skies
Is a wee one's trundle bed
So shut your eyes
While Mommy sings
Of the wonderful sights that be
And you shall see
All the beautiful things
As you rock in that misty sea
Just like the fisherman three
Wynken, Blynken and Nod
Just like the fisherman three

Brian & Jenn Johnson,"If my heart is overwhelmed and I cannot hear Your voice
I hold onto what is true, though I cannot see
If the storms of life they come and the road ahead gets steep
I will lift these hands in faith, I will believe
Pre-I remind myself of all that You've done 
and the life I have because of Your son
'Cause Love came down and rescued me
Love came down and set me free
Mountain high or valley low
I sing out to remind my soul
That I am Yours, I am forever Yours
When my heart is filled with hope 
and every promise comes my way
When I feel Your hands of grace rest upon me
Staying desperate for You, God, staying humble at Your feet
I will believe

How good it was when you were here
And it ain't the wine that I been drinking
For once I feel my head is clear

But early this morning, when I opened up my eyes
That old lonesome feeling took me by surprise
I guess you meant more to me than I realized
The love we had stays on my mind
The love we had stays on my mind

And lately girl, I've been remembering
The good times that we used to share
My thoughts of you don't have an ending
And memories of you are everywhere

But why should I tell you, it's not your concern
You win some, you lose some
Well I've lost and I've learned
Sisqo's so lonely
With no place to turn
And here at the end, I find
Yes I do

The love we had stays on my mind
Girl, if you were nearer
If you had a mirror
Maybe you could count my tears

And if you were nearer
It would all be clearer
How I wish that you were here
How I wish that you were here
How I wish, how I wish
How I wish that you were here

And baby girl I was tired
So I laid down to dream for a little while
But lately I've been so, so uninspired
Without the comfort of your smile

But I'm not complaining
Cuz that's how it goes
There's always some heartache
In this world I suppose
But you can't imagine
But nobody knows

On the day that you were born
And the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true

So they sprinkled moon dust
In your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue
That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you",(They Long to Be) Close to You,1986
Brian Alexander Morgan,"You're always on my mind [Repeat: x 4]

Boy, I can't seem to get you outta my head
But there's something about you that makes me smile
Don't change, I like the way you make me feel
Can we take our time and do this for a while
Girl, I never thought I'd find someone to love me
Now, you're the only one I want in my life
And the special touch you give comes from you only
I guess that's why you're always on my mind

You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind

Sometimes, I find it hard to concentrate
Because thoughts of us together fill my head
When you're away, it's hard to sleep at night
So, my pillow, like my thoughts of you, I hold tight

Girl, I never thought I'd find someone to love me
Now, you're the only one I want in my life
And the special tough you give comes from you only
I guess that's why you're always on my mind

I dreamed the only woman I ever loved
People, turned her back on me
Let me tell you little more about the dream

I dream of working a graveyard shift
For the long nights a week
When I left home my baby's in bed
My baby, she was fast asleep

When I'm done sick of my job
And I had to go home
And when I got there my bed was empty
My baby she was gone

It couldn't let this worry
It all happened in my sleep
All the things that has been so bad
And I don't want you from seven to seven next weekend

When you got love 
There's no limits to be seen
Girl, you know what I mean 

They say that nothing lasts too long 
But I know something that's gonna stay forever strong...
Our love is timeless 
Like a summer day 
Forever soulful like Marvin Gaye
Baby, timeless as a melody 
I love you, baby, timelessly...

Timeless like a summer day 
Forever soulful as a Shakespeare play
Baby, timeless, as a melody 
I love you baby, timelessly... 
Ooh...

About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

A crowd of people turned away
but I just had to look
Having read the book.
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy

And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

There's gifts I haven't bought
Just drop me here

Yes I've been a bum

Brian Auger & the Trinity,"We starve, look at one another short of breath
Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories
Facing a dying nation of moving paper fantasy
Listening for the new told lies
With supreme visions of lonely tunes
Somewhere, inside something , there is a rush of greatness
Who knows what stands in front of our lives
I fashion my future on films in space
Silence tells me secretly ev'rything, ev'rything
Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star

Get a thicky thick chick, and get a quick dome shot
Got a sick chrome glock, and it cough at niggaz
I came here to fuck with women, I talk to niggaz

Walked over (grabbed her hand), and with her lips she tells me

Your misses trying to get a Boss, kisses and hugs
But your misses get nothing, but diss and mugs

I don't give dick to chicks, that give it up to scrubs
Trying to find the finest bitch, up in the club
Make her up that thing, get in her ear
And fill her up, with game

Ten times out of ten, I'ma cut that thang
Got the broad giving up the brain, like it ain't nothing mayn
I'm a P-I-M-P, simple to me
And talk hoes out they clothes, so easily

I rock platinum rings, platinum piece and platinum car
And I'm bout to be, a platinum star
V.I.P. by the bar, is where you'll see me staying
With the Roley on my wrist, and the Crys in hand man

Before anything began between us
You were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to
When me and my girl was having problems
You used to say it'll be OK
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I go home at night and lay my head down
Last thing I think about was you
And how

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
I think about a ring and all the things that come along with you
Make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
I think about a ring and all the things that come along with you
Make me
You make me

Now what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up
Knowing it should have been you
What's sad is that I love her but I'm falling for you
What should I do
Should I tell my baby bye-bye
Should I do exactly what I feel inside
Could I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
I think about a ring and all the things that come along with you
Make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with

At this point the situation's out of control
I never meant to hurt her
But I gotta let her go
And she may not understand it
While all of this is going on
I tried, I tried to fight it
But the feeling's just too strong
You make me, make me

You make me wanna
You make me wanna
You make me wanna
You make me wanna

You make me wanna
You make me wanna

Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mommies
The back of the club, sippin' Moet, is where you'll find me (what?)
The back of the club, mackin' hoes, my crew's behind me (huh)
Mad question askin', blunt passin', music blastin'
But I just can't quit
'Cause one of these honies Biggie gots ta creep with
Sleep with, keep the ep a secret why not
Why blow up my spot 'cause we both got hot
Now check it, I got more Mack than Craig and in the bed
Believe me sweety I got enough to feed the needy
No need to be greedy I got mad friends with Benz's
C-notes by the layers, true fuckin'' players
Jump in the Rover and come over
Tell your friends jump in the GS3, I got the chronic by the tree

To the honies gettin' money playin' niggas like dummies

If you got a gun up in your waist please don't shoot up the place (why?)
'Cause I see some ladies tonight that should be havin' my baby, baby

Straight up honey really I'm askin'
Most of these niggas think they be mackin' but they be actin
Who they attractin' with that line, ""What's your name what's your sign?""
Soon as he buy that wine I just creep up from behind
And ask what your interests are, who you be with
Things to make you smile, what numbers to dial
You gon' be here for a while, I'm gon' go call my crew
You go call your crew
We can rendezvous at the bar around two
Plans to leave, throw the keys to 'Lil Cease
Pull the truck up, front, and roll up the next blunt
So we can steam on the way to the telly go fill my belly
A t-bone steak, cheese eggs and Welch's grape
Conversate for a few, 'cause in a few, we gon' do
What we came to do, ain't that right boo (true)
Forget the telly we just go to the crib
and watch a movie in the jacuzzi smoke L's while you do me

(How ya livin' Biggie Smalls?)
In mansion and Benz's givin' ends to my friends and it feels stupendous
Tremendous cream, fuck a dollar and a dream
Still tote gats strapped with infrared beams (what?)
Choppin O's, smokin' lye an' Optimo's
Money hoes and clothes all a nigga knows
A foolish pleasure, whatever
I had to find the buried treasure, so grams I had to measure
However living better now, Gucci sweater now
Drop top BM's, I'm the man girlfriend

Honey check it, tell your friends, to get with my friends
And we can be friends, shit we can do this every weekend

Spell my name right, B I double G  I E
Iced out lights out, me an' Ceasea Leo

Gettin' head from some chick he know
See it's all about the cheddar, nobody do it better
Goin' back to Cali, strictly for the weather
Women an' the weed, sticky green

No seeds, bitch, please, Poppa ain't soft
Dead up in the Hood, ain't no love lost
Got me mixed up, you drunk them licks up
Mad 'cause I got my dick sucked

An' my balls licked, forfeit, the game is mine

Scream, “Biggie, Biggie, gimme one more chance”
I be whippin' on the freeway, the N.Y.C. way
On the celly celly with my homeboy Lance

Pass hash from left to right
Only got five blunts left to light, I'm set tonight
Paid a visit to Versace store
Then she suck until I ain't got no more, only in L.A.

Bust on bitches belly, rub it in they tummy
Lick it, say it's yummy, then fuck yo' man
Fuck your plan, is it to rock the Tri-State?
Almost gold, 5 Gs at show gate

Or do you wanna see about seven digits?

Brian Bart,"Yea, this album is dedicated to all the teachers that told me
I'd never amount to nothing, to all the people that lived above the
Buildings that I was hustling in front of that called the police on
Me when I was just trying to make some money to feed my daughter
And all the niggas in the struggle, you know what I'm saying?

It's all good baby baby

It was all a dream
I used to read Word Up magazine
Salt 'n' Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock til my tape popped
Smokin weed and Bambu, sippin on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin Duke? duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski (wassup)
I'm blowin up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number same hood (that's right)
It's all good (it's aaalll good)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

[Chorus]
You know very well who you are
Don't let em hold you down, reach for the stars
You had a few, but not that many
Cause you're the only one I'll give you good and plenty

I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with Robin Leach
And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
The Moet and Alize keep me pissy
Girls used to diss me
Now they write letters cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen, this rappin stuff
I was too used to packin GATs and stuff
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast
From the Mississippi down to the east coast
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Livin life without fear
Puttin 5 karats in my baby girl's ears
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And it's still all good
Uh, and if you don't know, now you know, nigga

[Chorus]

Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
When I was dead broke, man I couldn't picture this
Fifty inch screen, money green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur
Phone bill about two G's flat
No need to worry, my accountant handles that
And my whole crew is lounging
Celebrating every day, no more public housing
Thinking back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps a Ac with minks on her back
And she loves to show me off, of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip champagne when we thirst-ay
Uh, damn right I like the life I live
Cause I went from negative to positive
And it's all

You tell me who flopped, who copped the blue drop
Who jewels got robbed, who's mostly Goldie down
To the tube sock, the same ol' pimp
Mase, you know ain't nuttin' change but my limp
Can't stop till I see my name on a blimp
Guarantee the million sales pullin' all the love
You don't believe in Harlem World, nigga, double up

We don't play around, it's a bet, lay it down
Nigga didn't know me ninety-one and bet they know me now
I'm a young Harlem nigga with a golden sound

And a team much stronger than yours, violate me

I be that cat you see at all events bent
Gats in holsters, girls on shoulders
Playboy, I told ya bein' mice to me
Bruise too much, I lose too much
Step on stage, the girls boo too much
I guess it's 'cause you run with lame dudes too much

Me lose my touch, never that if I did
Ain't no problem to get, get the gat
Where my true players at? Throw your Rollies in the sky
Wave 'em side to side and keep your hands high
While I give your girl the eye, player please

I'm in thirteens, know what I mean
I fuck around and hit you with the Hennessey dick
Mess around and go blind, don't get to see shit

Uh-huh, I was a shame, my crew was lame
I have enough heart for most of em
Long as I got stuff from most of em
It's on, even when I was wrong I got my point across
They depicted me the boss, of course
My orange box-cutter make the world go round
Plus I'm fuckin, bitches ain't my homegirls now
Start stackin, dabbled in crack, gun packin
Nickname Medina, make the seniors tote my ninas
From gym class, to Englass, pass off a global
The only nigga wit a mobile, Can't You See like Total
Gettin larger in waist and taste
Ain't no tellin where this felon is headin, just in case
Keep a shell at the tip of ya melon, clear da space
Ya brain was a terrible thing ta waste
Eighty-eight long gates, snatch initial name plates
Smokin spliffs wit niggaz, real life beginner killers
Prayin God forgive us for being sinners, help us out

Began to encounter, wit my counter-parts
On how ta burn the block apart, break it down into section
Drugs by the selection
Some use pipes, others use in-jec-tions
Syringe sold seperately, Frank the deputy
Quick to grab my Smith-n-Wessun, like my dick was missin
To protect my position, my corner, my layer
While we out here, say the hustlas prayer
If the game shakes me or breaks me
I hope it makes me a better man
Take a better stand
Put money in my moms hand
Get my daughter this college plan, so she don't need no man
Stay far from timid
Only make moves when ya heart's in it
And live the phrase Sky's The Limit

Brian Bart,"Ya gotta shook up, shook down, shook up all your lovin'
Ya gotta shook up, shook down, shook up 

I want a girl with extensions in her hair
Bamboo earrings, at least two pair
A Fendi bag and a bad attitude
That's all I need to get me in a good mood
She can walk with her switch and talk with street slang
I love when I woman ain't afraid to do her thang
Standin' at the bus stop, suckin' on a lollipop
When she gets pumpin', it's hard to make the hotty stop
She likes to dance to the rap jam
She's sweet as brown sugar with candied yams
Honey-coated complexion
Music camay
Let's hear it for the girl
She's from around the way

I need that around the way girl (Around the way girl)
That's the one for me (She's the one)
I need that around the way girl 
Ya gotta shook up, shook down, shook up all your lovin'

Silky, bilky 
Your smiles' like sunshine
That's why I had to dedicate at least one rhyme
To all the cuties in the neighborhood
'Cause if I didn't tell you, then another brother would
You're sweet like sugar with your gangsta talk
Wanna eat you like a cookie when I see you walk
With your rayon, silk, or maybe even denim
It really doesn't matter as long as your in 'em
You can break hearts and manipulate minds
Or surrender, act tender
Be gentle and kind
You always know what to say and do
Go flip when you think your man is playing
No cheap or petty
You're ready for loving
You're real independent, so your parents be buggin'
But if you ever need a place to stay
Come around my way

I need that around the way girl (Around the way girl)
That's the one for me (She's the only one)
I need that around the way girl 
Ya gotta shook up, shook down, shook up all your lovin'

Perm in your hair, or even a curly weave
With your New Edition/Bobby Brown button on your sleeve
I tell you come here
You say meet me half way
'Cause brothers been poppin' that yang all day
Around the way, you're like neighborhood jewel
All the homeboys sweat ya, so you're crazy cool
Wear your gold in the summer with your biking shorts
While your watchin' all the brothers on the basketball court
Goin' to the movies with your homegirl's crew
While the businessmen in suits be hawkin' you
Baby hair pumpin', lip gloss a-shinin'
I think you're in the mood for whinin' and dinin'
So we can go out and eat somewhere
We got a lot of private jokes to share
Lisa, Angela, Pamela, Renee
I love you, you're from around the way

I need that around the way girl (Around the way girl)
That's the one for me (She's all I ever need)
I need that around the way girl (Around the way girl)
Fine as can be (She's all I ever need)
I need that around the way girl (Around the way girl)
That's the one for me (She's the only one)
I need that around the way girl (Around the way girl)
Fine as can be

For as long as I can remember
You're all a real man could need
And could ever ask for
This is more than a crush
Yeah

It was Harlem at the ruckus
I saw you with your man, a smiling, huh
A coach bag in your hand
I was laying in the coupe with my hat turned back
We caught eyes for a moment and that was that

So I skated off as you strolled off
Looking at your legs, god damn, they look so soft (so fine)
I gotta take ya from your man, that's my mission
If his love is real he's got to handle competition
You only knew him five months, (that's right)
Besides he drinks too much, and smokes too many blunts

And I'll be working out everyday thinkin' about you
Looking at my own eyes in the rear view
Catching flashbacks of our eye contact
Wish I could lay you on your stomach and caress your back
I would hold you in my arms and ease your fears
I can't believe it, I ain't had a crush in years

[Chorus]
Hey lover, hey lover
This is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover
This is more than a crush, lover
Hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover
This is more than a crush

I see you at the bus stop waiting every day
Your man must think it's safe for you to travel that way
And I don't want to violate your relationship
So I'll lay back in the cut with a crush that's a trip

Still he can't stop me from having daydreams
Tongue'n you down with uh, vanilla ice cream
Kissing on your thighs in the moonlight
Searching you body with my tongue girl all night

I wonder one day could it be, (how I wonder)
Simple dreams could turn into reality
Our love would come down so naturally
We would walk down the aisle of destiny

Would your man get his hustle on, got your type scared
Break your off a little chump change to do your hair
It seems to be enough to satisfy your needs
But there's a deeper level if you follow our lead, hey lover

[Chorus]

Last week I saw ya at the mall
Standing at the pay phone about to make a call
I had a vision it was me on the other end
Telling you come by and then you walked in

I touched you gently with my hands
We talked about traveling the distant lands
Escaping all the madness out here in the world
Becoming my wife no longer my girl

Then you let your dress fall down to the floor (oh yeah)
I kissed you softly and you yearned for more
We experienced pleasure unparalleled
Into an ocean of love we both fell

Swimming in the timeless currents of pure bliss
Fantasies interchanging with each kiss
Undying passion unites our souls
Together we swim until the point of no control

But, it's a fantasy, you won't come true
We never even spoke and your man swears he love you
So, I'm gonna keep all these feelings aside, (that's right)
Keep my dreams alive until the right time

[Chorus]


Ain't nothing like a fantasy kid
Words up
Hey lover, hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush 
Hey lover, hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush 
Hey lover, hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush

Brian Bart,"My radio, believe me, I like it loud
I'm the man with a box that can rock the crowd
Walkin' down the street, to the hardcore beat
While my JVC vibrates the concrete
I'm sorry if you can't understand
But I need a radio inside my hand
Don't mean to offend other citizens
But I kick my volume way past 10
My story is rough, my neighborhood is tough
But I still sport gold, and I'm out to crush
My name is Cool J, I devastate the show
But I couldn't survive without my radio
Terrorizing my neighbors with the heavy bass
I keep the suckers in fear by the look on my face
My radio's bad from the Boulevard
I'm a hip-hop gangster and my name is Todd
Just stimulated by the beat, bust out the rhyme
Get fresh batteries if it won't rewind
Cause I play everyday, even on the subway

But I know I can't live without my radio

I really don't care if you're jealous or not
Cause I make the songs, you sing along
And your radio's def when my record's on
So get off the wall, become involved
All your radio problems have now been solved
My treacherous beats make ya ears respond
And my radio's loud like a fire alarm
The floor vibrates, the walls cave in
The bass makes my eardrums seem thin
Def sounds in my ride, yes the front and back
You would think it was a party, not a Cadillac
Cause I drive up to the ave, with the windows closed
And my bass is so loud, it could rip your clothes
My stereo's thumpin' like a savage beast
The level on my power meter will not decrease
Suckers get mad, cause the girlies scream
And I'm still gettin' paid while you look at me mean
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go
But I know I can't live without my radio
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go
And I know I can't live without my radio

Don't touch that dial, I'll be upset
Might go into a fit and rip off your neck
Cause the radio's thumpin' when I'm down to play
I'm the royal chief rocker LL Cool J
Let your big butt bounce from right to left
Cause it's a actual fact this jam is def
Most definitely created by me
Goin' down in radio history
I'm good to go on your radio
And I'm cold gettin' paid cause Rick said so
Make the woofers wallop and your tweeters twitch
Some jealous knuckleheads might try to dis
But it's nothin', ya frontin', ya girl I am stuntin'
And my radio's loud enough to keep you gruntin'

Circulating through your radio non-stop

And to expand my musical plan

That's right, so don't try to front the move
As you become motivated by the funky groove
You can see me and Earl chillin' on the block
With my box cold kickin' with the gangster rock
See people can't stop me, neither can the police
I'm a musical maniac to say the least
For you and your radio I made this for
Cool J's here to devastate once more
Pullin' all the girls, takin' out MCs

Seen her at the bar with anklets and toe rings
She can take a prince, turn him into a king
I was looking at her in the limelight, pearly whites
Said her man get paper but he don't live right
All these emotions flowing inside the club
Do you really wanna thug or do ya want love?
She gets the paper when it's time to get it on
She keeps these clowns thinking like Jack B. Quick
Honey smoke make you click, feel it in their throats   
No joke all this love, let it stay broke out
Behind every playa is a true playette
Bounce you up, outta there, push and check
Taster's choice, have you nice and moist
Or play paper games or floss the Rolls Royce

Something like a phenomenon Something like a phenomenon 
Something like a phenomenon Something like a phenomenon 
Something like a phenomenon Something like a phenomenon 
Something like a phenomenon Something like a phenomenon 
(uh huh) (go ahead daddy)

He was king of seduction, cop a suction
Now she was the cat that worked construction
Starve her with the paper, abuse the mind
Dis a new lover, when you know it's on mine
that's on top, lap dancin' got to stop
You play out your chick cause your game is hot
I give you two, Italian, ice my whole crew
He's banging on my chest till it's black and blue
You beefin', yellin' on the cell of my six
You reach it then you hear the cordless click
Now your club hopping, keep the Cristal poppin'
Use my chips and take the next man shoppin'
Hell no, must be out Chicago 
on your knees and your elbows each and every time
That's why I love you mami, you
Run your mouth though your legs over the bed baby
Work me out

[Chorus]

He was all souped up, but played it just right
Mami I was full blown, my game was air tight
I needed to switch up and get it in gear
It's a whole new movie, a world premiere, yeah yeah
Keep it jinglin', no more minglin'
A brand new year, me and you can bring it in
I'm sick and tired of the freakin', night to morn'
Moanin' in the mirror with my Cubans on
Let bygones be bygones, no more games
Hope all the chicken heads go up in flames
Now we in the brand new mansion, with the lake in back
Got it all figured out, mami I like that
Collect tips, cop his and her whips
The voice a quarter mil'-on, close the safe
But you're worth it playgirl, it's real in the field
Say what you want, but keep your lips sealed

And let's get together tonight 
I got some money in my jeans 
And I'm really gonna spend it right 
Been a-doin' my homework all week long 
now the house is empty the folks are gone 
C'mon everybody
Well my baby's number one 
But I'm gonna dance with three or four 
And the house'll be shakin' 
From my bare feet slapping the floor 
When you hear that music you can't sit still 
If your brother won't rock then your sister will 
C'mon everybody 

Well we'll really have a party but we gotta put a guard outside

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

Awaited them...

I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died

And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck

And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast

My life, that you fill,
No other can take it,
No one ever will.

Sure, I love the dear silver
That shines in your hair,
And the brow that's all furrowed,
And wrinkled with care.
I kiss the dear fingers,
So toil-worn for me,
Oh, God bless you and keep you,
Mother Machree.

Ev'ry sorrow or care
In the dear days gone by,
Was made bright by the light
Of the smile in your eye,

Like a candle that's set
In the window at night,
Your fond love has cheered me
And guided me right.

Brian Conley,"Life begins when somebody's eyes look into your own.
Life begins when you get your gal all alone.
From morning until twilight
I don't know I'm alive
But I know love begins at 8:45.

The stars are gonna twinkle and shine,
How they'll shine!
This evening about a quarter to nine.
My loving arms are going to tenderly twine
Around you around a quarter to nine.

I know I won't be late
Cause at half past eight,
I'm going to hurry there.
I, I'll be waiting where the lane begins
Waiting for you on needles and pins.
And then the world is going to be mine
Mine all mine!

Oh I was only 24 hours from Tulsa
Ah only one day away from your arms

I saw a welcoming light and stopped to rest for the night
And that is when I saw her
As I pulled in outside of a small motel
She was there and so I walked up to her
Asked where I could get something to eat and she showed me where

She took me to a cafe I asked her if she would stay
She said okay

Oh the jukebox started to play

All of a sudden I lost control as I held her charms
And I caressed her, kissed her 
Told her I'd die before I let her out of my arms

I believe in miracles,
Cause I'm such a mess.
But You choose to love me
And expect the best.
Plus You never lean on
What my critics say.
So for better or worse
I trust You to stay.
I believe Your the answer
Cause I said a prayer.
But I almost settled
And then You were there.
And it didn't take long
For these eyes to see
That You were the right one
Heaven sent to me.

I never hear them sing about this
When I hear the radio.
And though I've seen a lot of movies
Endings never seems show.
That sometimes miracles are people
Who let God's love take control.
That's why I believe in You.

Let me die before I awake,
Because I don't think I could take
A real minute without You in it.
I don't claim to understand,
How I deserve to be Your man.
But God intended for You to be mine,
That's why I'm never gonna leave Your side.

I believe You're the reason
God gave me life.
Cause You're so incredible
And now You're my wife.

But there's no hiding place.
You can't deny it. don't try to fight it.

We love you and there is nothing you can ever do about it
If you lose your way, you still got a place to stay so

Touch somebody and
Find out that they understand
When you tell 'em what you been through,
Who you are, what you had to do.
Believe it when you hear them say
The god we serve has made a way
For you to lay your burden down
Rest and make a joyful sound

Hug somebody now
Hold tight and just let it out
Somebody's gonna stand right here

Don't rush. it will be alright because

And, though many bridges I have burned

Meeting me when I think I can't make it to say 
That even he had to go through some pain.

Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise
'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

And now we're standing face to face

She wore the dress, and I stayed home
All kinds of weather, we stick together
The same in the rain and sun
Two different faces, but in tight places
We think and we act as one
Those who've seen us
Know that not a thing could come between us
Many men have tried to split us up, but no one can

For the G.I. Josephs who were in the war

What can you do with a general
When he stops being a general?
Oh, what can you do with a general who retires?
Who's got a job for a general
When he stops being a general?
They all get a job but a general no one hires

They fill his chest with medals while he's across the foam
And they spread the crimson carpet when he comes marching home
The next day someone hollers when he comes into view
""Here comes the general"" and they all say ""General who?""

They're delighted that he came
But they can't recall his name
Nobody thinks of assigning him
When they stop wining and dining him
It seems this country never has enjoyed
So many one and two and three and four star generals

Brian d'Arcy James,"Once upon a time, there was a little ogre named Shrek,
Who lived with his parents in a bog by a tree.
It was a pretty nasty place but he was happy because ogres like nasty.
On his birthday the little ogre's parents sat him down
To talk just as all ogre parents had for hundreds of years before.

Listen son, you're growing up so quickly
Growing up, bigger by the day

Although we want you here, the rules are very clear
Now you're seven
Now you're seven
So it's time to go away

Your Mama packed a sandwich for your trip
Your Papa packed your boots in case of snow
You're gonna make us proud, no backing up allowed

Just keep walking
Just keep hawking

And you'll find somewhere to go
It's a big, bright, beautiful world
With happiness all around
It's peaches and cream
And every dream comes true
But not for you
It's a big, bright, beautiful world
With possibilities everywhere
And just around the bend
There's a friend or two
But not for you

We're ugly son which means that life is harder
People hate the things they cannot understand
And when they look at us they tend to make a fuss
Burn our houses down

And chase us
Off our land
It's important that you find a cozy cesspit
A place no one would ever dare to tread
And if they happen by, make sure you terrify them

If you don't son
If you don't son

Then you'll surely wind up dead
Goodbye
Goodbye
Watch out for men with pitchforks

And so, the little ogre went off and found a muddy patch of swamp land far,
Far away from the world that despised him.
There he stayed for many years,
Tucked away and all alone, which was just the way he liked it.

Keep your big, bright, beautiful world
I'm happy where I am, all alone
I've got all I need
So read the stinkin' sign, haha

Doing what I can with a one man conga line
Yeah, your big, bright, beautiful world
Is all teddy bears and unicorns
Take your fluffy fun
And shove it where the sun don't shine

I prefer a life like this
It's not that complicated
Sure I'm fated to be lonely
And I'm destined to be hated
If you read the books they say
That's why I was created
But I don't care
'Cause being liked
Is grossly overrated

Who needs a big, bright, beautiful world
I've got my own little patch on the world

I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
And in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

He'll build a little home
Just meant for two
From which I'll never roam
Who would, would you?
And so all else above
I'm waiting for the man I love",The Man I Love,1994
Brian Dee,"I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stood still

My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew
That unfelt clasp of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still

I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stopped right there

My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew
That unfelt claps of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still",My Heart Stood Still,1994
Brian Dee,"Every day seems like a year
Sweetheart, when you are not near
All that you claim must be true
For I'm just the same as you

[Chorus]
Sometimes I'm happy, sometimes I'm blue
My disposition depends on you
I never mind the rain from the skies
If I can find the sun in your eyes
Sometimes I love you, sometimes I hate you
But when I hate you, it's 'cause I love you
That's how I am, so what can I do?
I'm happy when I'm with you

Stars are smiling at me from your eyes
Sunbeams now there will be in the skies
Tell me that you will be true
That will all depend on you

[Chorus]",Sometimes I'm Happy,1994
Brian Dee,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1994
Brian Dee,"When a girl has the heart of a mother
It must go to someone of course
It can't be sister or brother
And so I love my horse
But horses are frequently silly
Mine ran from the beach of Okhala
And left me alone for a filly
So I have picked you up

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all
What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will, you've made your kill
Cause you took advantage of me
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours
Cause you took advantage of me.

Brian Dee,"Sunday is gloomy; my hours are slumber-less
Dearest, the shadows I live with are numberless
Little white flowers will never awaken you
Not where the black coach of sorrow has taken you
Angels have no thought of ever returning you
Would they be angry if I thought of joining you?

Gloomy Sunday

Gloomy is Sunday--with shadows I spend it all
My heart and I have decided to end it all
Soon there'll be candles and prayers that are sad I know
Let them not weep; let them know that I'm glad to go
Death is no dream, for in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you

Gloomy Sunday

Dreaming, I was only dreaming
I wake and I find you asleep in the deep of my heart here
Darling, I hope that my dream never haunted you
My heart is telling you how much I wanted you

Gloomy Sunday",Szomorú Vasárnap (Gloomy Sunday),1998
Brian Dickinson,"Good morning heartache, you old gloomy sight
Good morning heartache, thought we said goodbye last night
I turned and tossed until it seemed you had gone
But here you are with the dawn

Wish I'd forget you, but you're here to stay
It seems I met you when my love went away
Now everyday I start by saying to you
Good morning heartache, what's new

Stop haunting me now
Can't chase you no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues

Good morning heartache, here we go again
Good morning heartache, you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hanging around
Good morning heartache, sit down

Stop haunting me now
Can't chase you no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues

Good morning heartache, you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hanging around
Good morning heartache, sit down",Good Morning Heartache,1996
Brian Dickinson,"I wish I knew someone like you could love me
I wish I knew you place no one above me
Did I mistake this for a real romance?
I wish I knew, but only you can answer.

If you don't care, why let me hop[e and pray so
Don't lead me on, if I'm a fool just say so,
Should I keep dreaming on, or just forget you?
What shall I do, I wish I knew",I Wish I Knew,1996
Brian Dickinson,"Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me
Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last
Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me
Long the skies were overcast

Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Just one look and then I knew
(Him, with her humming along)
That all I longed for long ago

Was you",Long Ago (And Far Away),1996
Brian Dickinson,"I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast
I fall in love too terribly hard, for love to ever last
My heart should be well schooled, 'cause I've been fooled in the past
And still I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast
 
I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast

From the beginnin, head-spinnin hip-hop
The never-endin, don't stop
be	-boy religion. I'll rock and claim position
Maim the opposition, tradition, got 'em on lock
Follow the greater mission, freedom marks the top
Beat 'em off the block, now cock-wrap they bop
Number one on street spots, Homeskill' the hard rock
I drop steady, cripplin non-believers like Teddy
Pendergrass, tense up ya tender ass, you're not ready
Hold steady, think first, my ink burst floods and blunder
Crown Hi-Tek sound thump pounds of thunder
Street hunger, the universal man works wonders
Mic and hand breakin land, rockin up from down under

I got sound control and I'm kinda slick wit it
Heads know I get down like that, can you dig it?
This is the way how I roll or how I deliver this packages
Turn the other cheek, 'cause this track I be smackin it
But don't clap, 'cause this style'll bust caps
I'm jiggy and all that, black and get control back
But fuck that, control over mind, body and soul
The MC regulator, microphone detonator
My real live want to battle niggas take a vouch
Eighty Shieks, throw them joints and +Let Da fuckin Monkey Out+
Not ""Hell yeah"" but ""Hell, yeah"" in Cin' City
When I spit this here it's easy as.. {""1-2-3""}
+You Can ""Huh?"" You Can Hear Me+, you ain't heard nuttin yet
I'm +Live+ and +Fortified+ like Kweli and Mos Def
Practice the incredible, shit ain't even competable
Due to that I'm technical, TKO's I got those
I got control but I'm wreckless in studios
I got Harmony and Thug tendencies all in my Bones
No need to be flashy, for heads to recognize me
Hi-Tek throw them joints that magnetize me
We global, East, West, North, South, we robo
Hands that touch mic's get smacked 'cause that's a no-no
Who rock the mic? Yo, we take the whole show
When heads hear this piece they call off with no shows

I struggle more in tug-of-war, writin rhymes by the score
Before I lived the hustle, swore this poor man would give the law
As a testament it goes, it was destined in my soul
They tested but questioned weapons rest in my foes
Blessed in my flows and obsessed with my scrolls
Midas Touch as it's told, writin nuttin less than gold
My journeys, I march through madness like atorneys
Send you out on a gerdy talkin 'bout yo' eternity
Can't stand it, search for your wind like Ban Enti
One man band on the MP and a nigga ran simply
Hi-Tek, all these other niggas can exempt me
Say he's the nicest out loud and gently
Have it your way, a freestyle mean no pay
If you sign a wack contract that mean.. (no weight)
Got your John Hancock on the paper to say
""The band locked and don't know, dough flow your way"" {x4}

Woes out my treasure box, seven locks, pressure to plot
Measurin blocks, releasin this live like Desert Fox
Hear spiritual, remain plentiful, same generals
Train criminals to get the most plus the minimals
Rob past, raw cash, facin the God last
Spot grabs, sure pop laugh, jump out of stock caps
For cop cash, watch taps, eyes on my top hat
Flop fast, stock crash, how when I drop math?
This rare rap, air vac', exit and fair fact
We share packs, stare back, cover our bear tracks
Ya peeps move, each choose, jump in our Jeep smooth
Unleash two and leak fumes, studyin Hebrew
