RuPaul,"This is a special shot, going out to my mama, Ms. Ernestine Charles.
Mama used to do people hair in the kitchen;
Press and curl, hot curlers, everything.
I love you, mama.
Black hair is a revolution.
Cornrows... uh, uh honey, I am tender-headed.
Jheri curls... style sophistication,
Afro puff... ah, ooh, ah, ah, ooh, ah.
Hair weave... call her Miss Ross.
Braids... pride, respect.
Extensions... more of a nineties fashion.
Asymmetrical shroom... banji girl.
I'm going back, back, back to my roots,
Where my love can be found, and my heart rings true.
I'm going back, back, back to my roots,
To the time and the place, coming back to you.
Black hair is a revolution.
Finger wave... a classic extravaganza.
Press and curl... never mix, never worry.
Flat top fade... very contemporary.
Nail sculpture... urban distinction.
Hot comb... ouch, mama, that was my ear.
Blow out kits... oh, oh, tamba.
No lye relaxer... fried, dyed, and laid to the side.
I'm going back, back, back to my roots,
Where my love can be found, and my heart rings true.
I'm going back, back, back to my roots,
To the time and the place, coming back to you.
Now, mama, got her own salon, down on auburn ave,
And if you want to know what's happening in atlanta,
Just go to the salon, that's to you and all y'all down there; 
Brothers and sisters, Miss Earlene, Lizzy Dean, Renetta, 
Little baby boy, tone, tone, Leo-nard, K-ron, Cornisha.
Peace to all my brothers and sisters.
Peace, love, and hair grease.",Back to My Roots,1993
RuPaul,"Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Everybody dance, do-do-do

[Chorus]
Clap your hands, clap you hands
Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap your hands

Music never lets you down
Puts a smile on your face
Any time, anyplace
Dancing helps relieve the pain
Soothes your mind, makes you happy again
Listen to those dancing feet
Close your eyes and let go
But it don't mean a thing
If it ain't got that swing
Bop-shoo-wa, bop-shoo-wa, bop-shoo-wa

[Chorus]

Spinning all around the floor
Just like Rogers and Astaire
Who found love without a care
Stepping to our favorite tune
The good times always end too soon
Everybody's dancing
Lift your feet, have some fun
Come on everybody, get on your feet
Clap your hands
Everybody's screaming

[Chorus]",Everybody Dance,1993
RuPaul,"There is a place up the street
It's a funky little place we can meet
It's my house built for love
From the kitchen to the basement, wall to wall
See that chair, I put it there
The vibrations of love are everywhere
And when things are going crazy
I'll be your shelter, baby
Keep you warm and 
Keep you from the rain- hey, hey
Come a come, come a come on in
Come a come on in
Come a come, come a come on in (house of love)
Just stop on by anytime
Cause what's mine is yours
And what's yours is mine
And when things are going crazy
I'll be your shelter, baby
Keep you warm and 
Keep you from the rain- hey, hey
Knock, knock, knock, anybody home ?
It's open baby, come on in.

When you gotta live your life with all your might

Free to love who you need
Everybody, you got the right to be free
So come on let your lovin' shine, shine
Come on and let your lovin' shine, yeah yeah
Time to stand up for your rights

You paid the price, you've paid your dues
So, go head on girl and spread the news
Take your place in the sun

I've been living in the shadows
A dark and lonely place
An empty room without a window
No sun upon my face

But I'm coming out
Into the light of day
Don't stand in my way
I've made up my mind
It's time for me to shine
This moment is all mine

I'm coming out of hiding
I'm coming out of hiding -I'm coming out

My time is now no time for tomorrow
No more livin' in shame
And if I have to beg, steal or borrow
You will remember my name

Yes, I'm movin on
I've found respect for me
I see my destiny there
Yes, I will be strong
Got someone lovin me
And that someone is me!

No more hiding - light of day
Not givin' up - can't keep me down
Not givin in - I'm comin' out



",Coming Out of Hiding,2004
RuPaul,"Writers: RuPaul/ Tom Trujillo

There's a cab outside,
Should I tell him don't bother?
I'll say there's been some mistake
And that he doesn't have to wait
If it wasn't so tragic, it would be funny
But I know that feelings have been hurt
And that you have the final word

October came early
Starting to look like rain
So what's your hurry, baby
They'll always be another plane

(CHORUS)
Give it one more try
Right here by my side
Leaving's not the answer or the solution
Give it one more try
Let your conscience be your guide
Right here by my side no more confusion

Did you hear me say
That I really love you?
And that I always will
Nothing can change the way I feel
But I'm starting to question why I try to persuade you
Cause if you don't look me in the eyes
How can I begin to change your mind?

I don't wanna blow it by
Standing in your way
You say that you're going
There's gotta be a better way

(BRIDGE)
There was a time
When you said we'd always be together
Said it would be you and me forever
And there was a time
When we didn't think about tomorrow
Don't let our future end right here in sorrow

If this is goodbye, at least I know I really tried
I gave the best I had to offer you

Stone cold city took a bite out of me
Love of my life said he had to leave
He said â?? I love you,but I hate it, it's not for me,
I'd rather take my chances back in Tennesseeâ??

HOLLYWOOD U.S.A HOLLYWOOD U.S.A

All alone in my room full of gloom
Livin on the dark side of the moon
A phone rings not a moment too soon
Is it you coming to my rescue?

Sacrificed our love to fulfill my dreams
But everything that glitters ain't what it seems
I miss the lovin' arms that once held me
I wanted fame but all I got was misery in

HOLLYWOOD U.S.A HOLLYWOOD U.S.A

Packin up, givin in, I can't win
Going back to start over again
Greyhound bus, gotta rush to my man
Will he still be my number one fan ?

Sell your soul to be a star - workin' in a bar
Change your name to play the game - it all remains the same
Sing your song you got the part - but don't forget your heart
You'll need it when you reach the top - and you're alone in...

HOLLYWOOD U.S.A HOLLYWOOD U.S.A

I lost my love in Hollywood
I'll say goodbye to Hollywood.

Black or white, tonight is right
Forget about whatever you've been told.
Unlock the door - unlike before - open up a window to your soul
I get down with cocoa brown - sassy red I go to town
And behold - young or old - and if I can be so bold
To let you know - I dig mellow yellow
Catch my flow - and every color of the rainbow.

It don't matter whatever the skin you're in
I need to feel why'electricity
The frequency - between you and me
My love sees no color

If a fool believes, just what he sees
Why can't he see the similarities
He separates - discriminates
Gay or straight-whatever the case may be
Been around - north and south - booragoon to Tennessee
Know by now - that beauty - is within and not skin deep
You should know - everybody's got a soul
Every color of the rainbow.

And time will reveal - that the way I feel
Is the way it was intended to be - each and everybody's free!

There's more than what 'cha see
Catch my flow

More woman than you'll ever need
I'll get it right until the job gets done
More man than you'll ever be
You'll get two lovers for the price of one

I can tell you still want me by the look in your eyes
Going home with me even though you know the â??teeâ??
Satisfaction guaranteed to fulfill your fantasies
Say you got twenty -three, I think we better leave

You're the kinda man I like, some men are so up tight and they lie
When I know they wanna get freaky
Don't want they're friends to see

Rupee,"Guilty are the feelings that you and I share inside
Though we both love somebody else we cannot hide
This love this passion this pain and this pride

Unfaithful even though we know what we do is so wrong
This love we hide inside it is so strong
We keep on letting go and holding on

How long can we keep going without this love from showing?
And everybody knowing we've got so much to lose
But someday we must choose

It's not that we're unhappy, we love our lovers dearly
Could somebody please tell me?
If this love is so wrong why does it feel so strong?

Why is love the crime of the century?
So many of us here are guilty
Those without sin cast your stone on me
Why is love the crime of the century?

Happy in both of our relationships at home
I can tell when I creep and call you on the phone
And hear you softly speak and softly moan

Nonsense, you can't love two people at the same time
Are we the only ones guilty of this crime?
Look and you'll be surprised at what you find

Why is love the crime of the century?
So many of us here are guilty
Those without sin cast your stone on me
Why is love the crime of the century?

No matter how we try we can't let this thing go
So until they find out we'll keep it on the low

Why is love the crime of the century?
So many of us here are guilty
Those without sin cast your stone on me
Why is love the crime of the century?

Many nights we would sit down and cry
Tears from mine would be tears from your eye
What they saw it was a human disguise
To fulfill their demise

How he used to treat you
Said he'd never leave you
How he used to beat you

Yes I've been blessed

Never try to hide from me
Keep it inside from me

On your shoulder yes the burden is great
For something so precious how could man show hate
Yes to elevate man that is to educate
But they say that love is blind
And if you seek then you will find
It's not about intelligence
It's not about the expense
It's not about the experience of revealing ones innocence
It's about the air you breathe inside of me
To all mankind and to all them baby
Yes I'll always love you
Always protect you
Yes I'll always shelter you

Imagine what you could be

There are rebels
Who can't be silenced, they remind us how to see
There are prophets, believing visions
While many others, put trust in science
And there are dreamers who
Must get through, to your soul

Do you want to be a legend
Or a passing footprint on the sands of time
Do you want to be a failure
Or the best example of a man who lived to use his mind -
Imagine what you could be

Imagine what you could be
With that feeling of symmetry
And your eye for beauty
Then you've faith in the impossible -
Imagine what you could be
There are lovers
Of skills forgotten
By great people - in their haste
But there is no one
Who knows what you do
That's the knowledge you should not waste
And teachers point the way
But only you can find the place

Do you want to be a legend
Or a passing footprint on the sands of time
Do you want to be a failure
Or the best example of a man who lived to use his mind -
Imagine what you could be",Legend,1986
Rupert Hine,"Love makes us strong
Don't close your eyes
You're not alone.
When you're out of control
I will guide you down,
I won't let you fall
Feed on my energy
You'll be amazed how brave we can be
I'll take the pain - I'll take the pain away.
I'll share your laughter.
Dream your first dream with me
Thousands of light years from here -
Love makes us strong
Open your mind,
We can do no wrong.
There are others who think
Life is worth fighting for
Till we win freedom.
There is a sanctuary, beyond this place, this universe
So far from our time, another frequency -
And one perfect reason.
Dream your first dream with me
Thousands of light years from here
We can go there
There shines our promised land
You'll smile in wonder.
There's light and there's water
Pastures green and no hunger,
Under another sun
And there's someone like you -
It's no strangers face
It's your reflection
We can go there
Dream your first dream with me
Thousands of light years from here
We can go there.
There shines our promised land - we can go there
You'll smile in wonder - love makes us strong.",There Shines Our Promised Land,1986
Rupert Holmes,"I've come back this morning
To where I first came alive
Here within this terminal
Where the buses arrive

I was a commuter on the 804
Worked for a computer
On the 19th floor and

You came down the aisle of the bus
And you sat by my side
Shoulder up to shoulder
We shared that 9 o'clock ride

Oh my heart was screaming
As you left your seat
Following your movements
I was at your feet and

Oh... down into the terminal
Both of us smiled
So... we entered the terminal
Just as you smiled

""Won't you leave out work for today?""
You asked of me then
So I phoned in sick on the way
To the home of a friend

We were all alone from 10 a.m. till 3
Really thought the fire
Had gone out of me but

You awoke the sleep of my life
From gray into red
Made the weary wonder of Wall Street
Rise from the dead

Could have held up
Budding my entire life
But I had to get home
To the kids and the wife and so

I left for the terminal where I began
Baby no, I wouldn't have left
If I'd been half a man

So here I am this morning
Where love had asked for the dance
Here within this terminal
Where I passed on the chance

Lord I'll never find her
Though I've truly tried
Probably she's found another
Bus to ride and

I am now about to begin
The last of my days
I'm within what others
Would call a terminal phase

I myself can only say it's livin' dead
Riding to the office with
A song in my head that goes...

La da da...
And you know it grows
La da da...",Terminal,1974
Rupert Holmes,"Singles,
You & I are singles
Strangers
Trying to stay warm in the snow
Maybe 
We will wake as strangers
Or maybe we will find 
We have somewhere to go.

Couples
All start out as singles
Lovers
Like to walk alone now & then
Even 
Married folks act single
If they should feel the need 
To find themselves again

[Chorus: (x2)]
Singles,
All my loves were singles,
Like the dollar bills that slip away
Before you even know

Music,
Pourin' out on singles,
Finds a home
On someone's stereo
And like a stack of singles
We'll survive as singles
Trying
Hard to match one shoe with one glove

Lovers,
'Cause we share the same dreams
Dreams of what the world
Can't have too many of

Like singles
Doubled up with love",Singles,1977
Rupert Holmes,"The more I learn, the less I know
The more I earn, the more I owe
The more I search for somethin' new
The more I come right back to you

I'll always need your love I guess
I've looked for more but more is less
You take me in, you take me slow
You let me be, you let me know

That less is more, less is more
Hold me tight and everything is right
Just like before
Oh, take it easy

Love is more, love is more
Love is more than all the empty dreams
Outside your door
Make it easy

The more you buy, the less you've sold
The more you try, the more you fold
The more you read, the less you see
The more you need, the less you're free

Do what you do, you do it best
Don't run the race with all the rest
You set the pace so easily
With all the moves you make on me

Less is more, less is more
Hold me tight and everything is right
Just like before
Oh, take it easy

Love is more, love is more
Love is more than all the empty dreams
Outside your door
Make it easy

And more and more I must confess
I find I'm needing less and less
Why take the climb, why take the fall?
When more is here and less is all

Love is here, love is there
Love is found with both feet on the ground
That you share
Take it easy

Less is more, less is more
Less is more than everything combined
That's gone before
Make it easy",Less Is More,1978

Rupert Holmes,"I can make a speech
When the mood comes to me, yes it's true
But oh pretty darlin'
I am speechless when it comes to you

Speechless when you reach for my hand
I am so speechless and I can't understand how you love me
But as long as you keep sayin' that you love me
There is nothin' I can say

Except I am speechless at the sound of your voice
I am so speechless and since I have no choice
I keep smilin' like a cat whose caught a bird
And just keep smilin'

If I dare to say a word, you'd find me mindless
And I don't really mind, love is blindness
And my mind is resigned to the kindness you keep pourin' on me
Can it be? Can it be? Can it be all for me?

I don't have a hope
If you don't dream of me, this is true
Cause oh pretty darlin'
I am hopeless when I dream of you

Speechless and the heart never lies
I am so speechless so I speak with my eyes
I am just smilin' 'cause I've seen [?]
Oh, are you smilin' at my face within the darkness

When I am breathless and I come up for air
It's so endless that it gives me a scare
It's so timeless that I never touch ground

I can sing your song
I can sigh in the night, this is true
But oh pretty darlin'
I am speechless at the sight of you",Speechless,1978
Rupert Holmes,"A little while ago I went and placed a call
To tell this girl I know that she could have it all
The wedding, the ring, the whole darn thing, I was willing to tie the knot
So I called her up, and this is the answer I got:

[Chorus]
""I'm so sorry you have just reached my answering machine,
I'm not in at present, I'm sure you know the whole routine.
Leave your name and number, and I'll try to get back to you;
You have 30 seconds to talk to me before you're through.""

And I said,
""Baby let's go get married, I need to hear you're mine.
I am hanging on, I am hanging on, I am hanging on this line.
And if I can leave one message before you go to bed,
I would say to you...:""

And the phone went dead.

So I stepped out to buy some dog food for the cat.
Of course she called about three minutes after that.
Would she be my wife and share my life? Well of course you can write the
Plot,
Cause she called me up, and this is the answer she got:

[Chorus]

And she said,
""Baby I got your message, I am answering your call.
I have thought it out, I have thought it out, and I think that, all-in-all
If you ask if we can marry, and make it for all time,
Then my answer is, ""

Will change from week to week

Why not blow a wad of dough
And see the world at large?

Think that you would find
I'm undeniably, certifiably just a shade of blind

I don't envy those of you with 20/20 vision
Who've seen the world for all its worth
With crystal clear precision

There's more to see than can be
Seen or said than what is heard
The day is brighter, softer, lighter
When it's slightly blurred

Nearsighted, it's another lovely day
Nearsighted, so I stumble on my way

I don't judge a friend or lover
By a first or second look
Nor a book just by its cover
I can't even see the book

Nearsighted, loving life is such a breeze
Nearsighted 'cause I see just what I please

And it pleases me to see you
I won't change my point of view
Nearsighted, nearsighted
Nearsighted, all I need to see is you

Though I'm slightly out of focus
I can see my dreams come true
Clear sighted, I'm nearsighted
Nearsighted, all I need to see is you, you

""If you like Pina Coladas, and getting caught in the rain

who had more than me
and was less than shy?

You tease me all day
Please, may I say
that we're on tonight

In the morning
things are working out fine
Come the evening
you refuse to be mine
but you stay
and you say

That I hope to find some love
But each girl I find
will remind me of

In the morning
you say ""Wait til tonight""
Come the evening

Not my brand you understand,

And I'll say, oh, I'm not blind
To..

She's gonna have to live without him, 
It's him or it's me, me me,
No one gets to get it for free
It's me or it's him.

Don't know what he looks like, 
Don't know who he is.
Don't know why she thought that I 
Would say what's mine is his.

I don't want to own her,
But I can't let her have it both ways.
Three is one too many of us,
She leaves with me or stays

Through astral nights, galactic days

That grace this strange and wondrous land
I see the hand of man arise
With hungry mind and open eyes

They left the planet long ago

Their power grows with purpose strong
To claim the home where they belong
Home, to tear the temples down
Home, to change

The dream is still in my head
I heave a sigh and sadly smile
And lie a while in bed

In a world like I have seen
I don't think I can carry on
Carry on this cold and empty life

I am new
I am free

I am young
Sight unseen
Life unsung

And they're open very wide
Images around me
Don't identify inside
Just one blur I recognize
The one that soothes and feeds
My way of life is easy
And as simple are my needs

Yet my eyes are drawn toward
The mountain in the east
Fascinates and captivates
Gives my heart no peace
The mountain holds the sunrise
In the prison of the night
Till bursting forth from rocky chains
The valley floods with light

Living one long sunrise
For to me all things are new
I've never watched the sky grow pale
Or strolled through fields of dew
I do not know of dust to dust
I live from breath to breath
I live to climb that mountain to
The Fountain of Lamneth

Listen

Crying back to consciousness
The coldness grips my skin
The sky is pitching violently
Drawn by shrieking winds
Seaspray blurs my vision
Waves roll by so fast
Save my ship of freedom
I'm lashed helpless to the mast

Call out for direction
And there's no one there to steer
Shout out for salvation
But there's no one there to hear
Cry out supplication
For the maelstrom is near
Scream out desperation
But no one cares to hear

Remembering when first I held
The wheel in my own hands
I took the helm so eagerly
And sailed for distant lands
But now the sea's too heavy
And I just don't understand
Why must my crew desert me
When I need a guiding hand

The whiteness of confusion
Is unfolding from my mind
I stare around in wonder
Have I left my life behind

I catch the scent of ambergris
And turn my head, surprised
My gaze is caught and held
And I am helpless, mesmerized

Panacea, liquid grace
Oh let me touch your fragile face
Enchantment falls around me
And I know I cannot leave

Here's a meaning for my life
A shelter from the storm
Pacify my troubles with
Her body, soft and warm
Naked in our unity
A smile for every tear
Gentle hands that promise me
Comfort through the years
Yet I know I must be gone
Before the light of dawn

Panacea, passion pure
I can't resist your gentle lure
My heart will lie beside you
And my wandering body grieves

Another endless day
Silhouettes of grey
Another glass of wine
Drink with eyes that shine
To days without that chill at morning
Long nights time out of mind

Draw another goblet
From the cask of '43
Crimson misty memory
Hazy glimpse of me
Give me back my wonder, I've something more to give
I guess it doesn't matter
There's not much more to live

Another foggy dawn
The mountain almost gone
Another doubtful fear
The road is not so clear
My soul grows ever weary
And the end is ever near

Look, the mist is rising
And the sun is peaking through
See, the steps grow lighter
As I reach their final few
Hear, the dancing waters
I must be drawing near
Feel, my heart is pounding
With embattled hope and fear

Now, at last I fall before
The Fountain of Lamneth
I thought I would be singing
But I'm tired, out of breath
Many journeys end here
But, the secret's told the same
Life is just a candle
And a dream must give it flame

The key, the end, the answer
Stripped of their disguise
Still it's all confusion
And tears spring to my eyes
Though I've reached a signpost
It's really not the end
Like Old Sol behind the mountain
I'll be coming up again

I am still
I am crying
I am still

Yes, I've seen your face before
Why, I've seen it everywhere
Showing up to me without a scent revealing 

Well, I said will it ever change?
Will it stay the same?
I'd surely like to know before it's over

I said it won't be long
Won't be long before I stop and play it over

Rush,"As grey traces of dawn tinge the eastern sky, the three travelers, men of Willow Dale, emerge from the forest shadow. Fording the River Dawn, they turn south, journeying into the dark and forbidding lands of the Necromancer. Even now the intensity of his dread power can be felt, weakening the body and saddening the heart. Ultimately they will become empty, mindless spectres, stripped of will and soul. Only their thirst for freedom gives them hunger for vengeance

Silence shrouds the forest
As the birds announce the dawn
Three trav'llers ford the river

And they wondered, and were sad

Their world was torn asunder into hollow hemispheres

Some fought themselves, some fought each other
Most just followed one another
Lost and aimless like their brothers
For their hearts were so unclear
And the truth could not appear
Their spirits were divided into blinded hemispheres

Some who did not fight
Brought tales of old to light
My Rocinante' sailed by night
On her final flight

To the heart of Cygnus' fearsome force
We set our course
Spiraled through that timeless space
To this immortal place

I have memory and awareness
But I have no shape or form
As a disembodied spirit
I am dead and yet unborn

I have passed into Olympus
As was told in tales of old
To the city of immortals
Marble white and purest gold

I see the gods in battle rage on high,
Thunderbolts across the sky
I cannot move, I cannot hide
I feel a silent scream begin inside

Then all at once the chaos ceased
A stillness fell, a sudden peace
The warriors felt my silent cry
And stayed their struggle, mystified

Apollo was astonished
Dionysus thought me mad
But they heard my story further
And they wondered, and were sad

Looking down from Olympus
On a world of doubt and fear
Its surface splintered
Into sorry hemispheres
They sat a while in silence
And then they turned at last to me
We will call you Cygnus,
The God of Balance you shall be

We can walk our road together
If our goals are all the same
We can run alone and free
If we pursue a different aim

Let the truth of love be lighted
Let the love of truth shine clear
Sensibility, armed with sense and liberty
With the heart and mind united in a single perfect sphere",Cygnus X-1 Book II Hemispheres: Prelude/Apollo Bringer of Wisdom/Dion,1978
Rush,"There is unrest in the forest
There is trouble with the trees
For the maples want more sunlight
And the oaks ignore their pleas 

The trouble with the maples
And they're quite convinced they're right
They say the oaks are just too lofty
And they grab up all the light
But the oaks can't help their feelings
If they like the way they're made
And they wonder why the maples
Can't be happy in their shade? 

There is trouble in the forest
And the creatures all have fled
As the maples scream 'oppression!'
And the oaks, just shake their heads 

So the maples formed a union
And demanded equal rights
'The oaks are just too greedy
We will make them give us light'
Now there's no more oak oppression
For they passed a noble law
And the trees are all kept equal
By hatchet,
Axe,
And saw",The Trees,1978

I wandered home though the silent streets
And fell into a fitful sleep
Escape to realms beyond the night
Dream, can't you show me the light?

I stand atop a spiral stair
An oracle confronts me there
He leads me on light years away
Through astral nights, galactic days

I see the works of gifted hands
That grace this strange and wondrous land
I see the hand of man arise
With hungry mind and open eyes

They left the planet long ago
The elder race still learn and grow
Their power grows with purpose strong
To claim the home where they belong
Home, to tear the temples down
Home, to change

The sleep is still in my eyes
The dream is still in my head
I heave a sigh and sadly smile
And lie a while in bed
I wish that it might come to pass
Not fade like all my dreams

Just think of what my life might be
In a world like I have seen
I don't think I can carry on
Carry on this cold and empty life
Oh, no

My spirits are low in the depths of despair
My lifeblood spills over

In geometric order
An insulated border
In-between the bright lights
And the far, unlit unknown

Opinions all provided
The future pre-decided
Detached and subdivided
In the mass-production zone

Nowhere is the dreamer
Or the misfit so alone

In the high school halls
In the shopping malls
Conform or be cast out
Subdivisions
In the basement bars
In the backs of cars
Be cool or be cast out
Any escape might help to smooth
The unattractive truth
But the suburbs have no charms to soothe
The restless dreams of youth

Drawn like moths, we drift into the city
The timeless old attraction
Cruising for the action
Lit up like a firefly
Just to feel the living night

Some will sell their dreams for small desires
Or lose the race to rats
Get caught in ticking traps
And start to dream of somewhere
To relax their restless flight

Of lighted streets on quiet nights","Subdivisions [Live Birmingham England, 1988]",1989

It's enough to learn
To share our pleasures
We can't sooth pain with sympathy
All that we can do is be reminded 
We shake our heads at the tragedy 

Every day we're standing
In a time capsule
Racing down a river from the past
Every day we're standing
In a wind tunnel
Facing down the future coming fast 

It's just the age
It's just a stage
We disengage 
We turn the page

Looking at
The long-range forecast
Catching all the names in the news
Checking out
The state of the nation
Learning the environmental blues

And pieces that don't fit

""I lie awake, staring out at the bleakness of Megadon. City and sky become one, merging into a single plane, a vast sea of unbroken grey. The Twin Moons, just two pale orbs as they trace their way across the steely sky. I used to think I had a pretty good life here, just plugging into my machine for the day, then watching Templevision or reading a Temple Paper in the evening.

My friend Jon always said it was nicer here than under the atmospheric domes of the Outer Planets. We have had peace since 2062, when the surviving planets were banded together under the Red Star of the Solar Federation. The less fortunate gave us a few new moons.

I believed what I was told. I thought it was a good life, I thought I was happy. Then I found something that changed it all...""

""And the meek shall inherit the earth.""

II. THE TEMPLES OF SYRINX
-------------------------------------------------------------

... ""The massive grey walls of the Temples rise from the heart of every Federation city. I have always been awed by them, to think that every single facet of every life is regulated and directed from within! Our books, our music, our work and play are all looked after by the benevolent wisdom of the priests...""

We've taken care of everything
The words you hear the songs you sing
The pictures that give pleasure to your eyes.

It's one for all and all for one
We work together common sons
Never need to wonder how or why.

We are the Priests, of the Temples of Syrinx
Our great computers fill the hallowed halls.
We are the Priests, of the Temples of Syrinx
All the gifts of life are held within our walls.

Look around this world we made
Equality our stock in trade
Come and join the Brotherhood of Man
Oh what a nice contented world
Let the banners be unfurled
Hold the Red Star proudly high in hand.

III. DISCOVERY
-------------------------------------------------------------

... ""Behind my beloved waterfall, in the little room that was hidden beneath the cave, I found it. I brushed away the dust of the years, and picked it up, holding it reverently in my hands. I had no idea what it might be, but it was beautiful"" ...

... ""I learned to lay my fingers across the wires, and to turn the keys to make them sound differently. As I struck the wires with my other hand, I produced my first harmonious sounds, and soon my own music! How different it could be from the music of the Temples! I can't wait to tell the priests about it! ...""

What can this strange device be?
When I touch it, it gives forth a sound
It's got wires that vibrate and give music
What can this thing be that I found?

See how it sings like a sad heart
And joyously screams out its pain
Chords that build high like a mountain
Or notes that fall gently like rain.

I can't wait to share this new wonder
The people will all see its light
Let them all make their own music
The Priests praise my name on this night.

IV. PRESENTATION
-------------------------------------------------------------

... ""In the sudden silence as I finished playing, I looked up to a circle of grim, expressionless faces. Father Brown rose to his feet, and his somnolent voice echoed throughout the silent Temple Hall."" ...

... ""Instead of the grateful joy that I expected, they were words of quiet rejection! Instead of praise, sullen dismissal. I watched in shock and horror as Father Brown ground my precious instrument to splinters beneath his feet...""

I know it's most unusual
To come before you so
But I've found an ancient miracle
I thought that you should know

Listen to my music
And hear what it can do
There's something here as strong as life
I know that it will reach you.

The Priests:

Yes, we know it's nothing new
It's just a waste of time
We have no need for ancient ways
The world is doing fine

Another toy will help destroy
The elder race of man
Forget about your silly whim
It doesn't fit the plan.

I can't believe you're saying
These things just can't be true
Our world could use this beauty
Just think what we might do.

Listen to my music
And hear what it can do
There's something here as strong as life
I know that it will reach you.

The Priests:

Don't annoy us further
We have our work to do.
Just think about the average
What use have they for you?

Another toy will help destroy
The elder race of man
Forget about your silly whim
It doesn't fit the plan.

V. ORACLE: THE DREAM
-------------------------------------------------------------

... ""I guess it was a dream, but even now it all seems so vivid to me. Clearly yet I see the beckoning hand of the oracle as he stood at the summit of the staircase"" ...

... ""I see still the incredible beauty of the sculptured cities and the pure spirit of man revealed in the lives and works of this world. I was overwhelmed by both wonder and understanding as I saw a completely different way to life, a way that had been crushed by the Federation long ago. I saw now how meaningless life had become with the loss of all these things ...""

I wandered home though the silent streets
And fell into a fitful sleep
Escape to realms beyond the night
Dream can't you show me the light?

I stand atop a spiral stair
An oracle confronts me there
He leads me on light years away
Through astral nights, galactic days

I see the works of gifted hands
That grace this strange and wondrous land
I see the hand of man arise
With hungry mind and open eyes

They left the planet long ago
The elder race still learn and grow
Their power grows with purpose strong
To claim the home where they belong
Home, to tear the Temples down...
Home, to change..

VI. SOLILOQUY
-------------------------------------------------------------

... ""I have not left this cave for days now, it has become my last refuge in my total despair. I have only the music of the waterfall to comfort me now. I can no longer live under the control of the Federation, but there is no other place to go. My last hope is that with my death I may pass into the world of my dream, and know peace at last.""

The sleep is still in my eyes
The dream is still in my head
I heave a sigh and sadly smile
And lie a while in bed
I wish that it might come to pass
Not fade like all my dreams

Just think of what my life might be
In a world like I have seen
I don't think I can carry on
Carry on this cold and empty life
Oh...no.

My spirits are low in the depths of despair
My lifeblood spills over..

In geometric order
An insulated border
In-between the bright lights
And the far, unlit unknown

Growing up, it all seems so one-sided
Opinions all provided
The future pre-decided
Detached and subdivided
In the mass-production zone

Nowhere is the dreamer
Or the misfit so alone

Subdivisions
In the high school halls
In the shopping malls
Conform or be cast out
Subdivisions
In the basement bars
In the backs of cars
Be cool or be cast out

Any escape might help to smooth
The unattractive truth
But the suburbs have no charms to soothe
The restless dreams of youth

Drawn like moths, we drift into the city
The timeless old attraction
Cruising for the action
Lit up like a firefly
Just to feel the living night

Some will sell their dreams for small desires
Or lose the race to rats
Get caught in ticking traps
And start to dream of somewhere
To relax their restless flight

Somewhere out of a memory
Of lighted streets on quiet nights

Subdivisions
In the high school halls
In the shopping malls
Conform or be cast out

On the edge of sleep,
I was drifting for half the night
Anxious and restless,
Pressed down by the darkness
Bound up and wound up so tight
So many decisions, a million revisions
Caught between and light

Wilderness of mirrors
World of polished steel
Gears and iron chains
Turn the grinding wheel
I run between the shadows
Some are phantoms, some are real 

Where would you rather be?
Anywhere but here
When will the time be right?
Anytime but now
The doubt and the fear
I know would all disappear
Anywhere but here 

On the edge of sleep,
I heard voices behind the door
The known and the nameless,
Familiar and faceless
My angels and my demons at war
Which one will lose - depends on what I choose
Or maybe which voice I ignore

Wilderness of mirrors
Streets of cold desire
My precious sense of honor
Just a shield of rusty wire
I hold against the chaos
And the cross of holy fire 

Wilderness of mirrors
So easy to deceive
My precious sense of rightness
Is sometimes so naive
So that which I imagine
Is that which I believe 

On the edge of sleep, I awoke to a sun so bright
Rested and fearless, cheered by your nearness
I knew which direction was right
The case had been tried by the jury inside
The choice between darkness and light",Double Agent,1993
Rush,"In the house where nobody laughs
And nobody sleeps
In the house where love lies dying
And the shadows creep
A little girl hides, shaking,
With her hands on her ears
Pushing back the tears, 'til the pain disappears

Mama says some ugly words
Daddy pounds the wall
They can fight about their little girl later
Right now they don't care at all
No matter what they say...
No matter what they say...

Everyday people
Everyday shame
Everyday promise
Shot down in flames

Everyday sunrise
Another everyday story
Rise from the ashes 
A blaze of everyday glory

In the city where nobody smiles
And nobody dreams
In the city where desperation
Drives the bored to extremes

Just one spark of decency
Against a starless night
One glow of hope and dignity
A child can follow the light
No matter what they say
No matter what they say...

into a single plane, a vast sea of unbroken grey. The Twin Moons, just two pale orbs as
they trace their way across the steely sky. I used to think I had a pretty good life here,
just plugging into my machine for the day, then watching Templevision or reading a Temple
Paper in the evening.

'My friend Jon always said it was nicer here than under the atmospheric domes of the Outer
Planets. We have had peace since 2062, when the surviving planets were banded together under
the Red Star of the Solar Federation. The less fortunate gave us a few new moons.
I believed what I was told. I thought it was a good life, I thought I was happy
Then I found something that changed it all...'

And the meek shall inherit the earth...

[II. Temples of Syrinx]

...'The massive grey walls of the Temples rise from the heart of every Federation city. I
have always been awed by them, to think that every single facet of every life is regulated
and directed from within! Our books, our music, our work and play are all looked after by
the benevolent wisdom of the priests...'

We've taken care of everything
The words you read, the songs you sing
The pictures that give pleasure to your eyes

Behind my beloved waterfall, in the little room that was hidden beneath the cave, I
found it. I brushed away the dust of the years, and picked it up, holding it reverently in
my hands. I had no idea what it might be, but it was beautiful
I learned to lay my fingers across the wires, and to turn the keys to make them sound
differently. As I struck the wires with my other hand, I produced my first harmonious sounds
and soon my own music! How different it could be from the music of the Temples! I can't wait
to tell the priests about it!

What can this strange device be?
When I touch it, it gives forth a sound
It's got wires that vibrate and give music
What can this thing be that I found?

See how it sings like a sad heart
And joyously screams out its pain
Sounds that build high like a mountain
Or notes that fall gently like rain

I can't wait to share this new wonder
The people will all see its light
Let them all make their own music
The Priests praise my name on this night

In the sudden silence as I finished playing, I looked up to a circle of grim,
expressionless faces. Father Brown rose to his feet, and his somnolent voice echoed
throughout the silent Temple Hall...'

Instead of the grateful joy that I expected, they were words of quiet rejection!
Instead of praise, sullen dismissal. I watched in shock and horror as Father Brown ground my precious instrument to splinters beneath his feet

I know it's most unusual
To come before you so
But I've found an ancient miracle
I thought that you should know
Listen to my music
And hear what it can do
There's something here as strong as life
I know that it will reach you

Yes, we know, it's nothing new
It's just a waste of time
We have no need for ancient ways

I guess it was a dream, but even now it all seems so vivid to me. Clearly yet I see
the beckoning hand of the oracle as he stood at the summit of the staircase.
I see still the incredible beauty of the sculptured cities and the pure spirit of man
revealed in the lives and works of this world. I was overwhelmed by both wonder and
understanding as I saw a completely different way to life, a way that had been crushed
by the Federation long ago. I saw now how meaningless life had become with the loss of all these things

I wandered home through the silent streets
And fell into a fitful sleep
Escape to realms beyond the night
Dream can't you show me the light?

I stand atop a spiral stair
An oracle confronts me there
He leads me on light years away
Through astral nights, galactic days
I see the works of gifted hands
That grace this strange and wondrous land
I see the hand of man arise
With hungry mind and open eyes

They left the planet long ago
The elder race still learn and grow
Their power grows with purpose strong
To claim the home where they belong
Home to tear the Temples down
Home to change!

I have not left this cave for days now, it has become my last refuge in my total
despair. I have only the music of the waterfall to comfort me now. I can no longer live
under the control of the Federation, but there is no other place to go. My last hope is
that with my death I may pass into the world of my dream, and know peace at last.

The sleep is still in my eyes
The dream is still in my head
I heave a sigh and sadly smile
And lie a while in bed
I wish that it might come to pass
Not fade like all my dreams...

Just think of what my life might be
In a world like I have seen!
I don't think I can carry on
Carry on this cold and empty life

The Twin Moons, just two pale orbs as they trace their way across the steely sky. I used to think I had a pretty good life here, just plugging into my machine for the day, then watching Templevision or reading a Temple Paper in the evening.

My friend Jon always said it was nicer here than under the atmospheric domes of the Outer Planets. We have had peace since 2062, when the surviving planets were banded together under the Red Star of the Solar Federation. The less fortunate gave us a few new moons.

""I guess it was a dream, but even now it all seems so
Vivid to me. Clearly yet I see the beckoning hand of the
Oracle as he stood at the summit of the staircase""

""I see still the incredible beauty of the sculptured cities
And the pure spirit of man revealed in the lives and works
Of this world. I was overwhelmed by both wonder and
Understanding as I saw a completely different way to life,
A way that had been crushed by the federation long ago. I
Saw now how meaningless life had become with the loss
Of all these things""

I wandered home though the silent streets
And fell into a fitful sleep
Escape to realms beyond the night
Dream can't you show me the light? 

I stand atop a spiral stair
An oracle confronts me there
He leads me on light years away
Through astral nights, galactic days 

I see the works of gifted hands
That grace this strange and wondrous land
I see the hand of man arise
With hungry mind and open eyes 

They left the planet long ago
The elder race still learn and grow
Their power grows with purpose strong
To claim the home where they belong
Home, to tear the temples down, home, to change

""I have not left this cave for days now, it has become
My last refuge in my total despair. I have only the music of
The waterfall to comfort me now. I can no longer live
Under the control of the federation, but there is no other
Place to go. My last hope is that with my death I may pass
Into the world of my dream, and know peace at last""

The sleep is still in my eyes
The dream is still in my head
I heave a sigh and sadly smile
And lie a while in bed
I wish that it might come to pass
Not fade like all my dreams 

Just think of what my life might be
In a world like I have seen
I don't think I can carry on
Carry on this cold and empty life
Oh no, my spirits are low in the depths of despair
My lifeblood spills over

In the early morning half light
The sun is still a rumor
And the night is still a threat

Slipping through the dark streets
And the echoes and the shadows
Something stirs behind me
And my palms begin to sweat

Sometimes I freeze, until the light comes
Sometimes I fly, into the night
Sometimes I fight, against the darkness
Sometimes I'm wrong, sometimes I'm right

Coiled for the spring
Caught like a creature in the headlights
Into a desperate panic
Or a tempest of blind fury
Like a cornered beast
Or a conquering hero

The menace threatens, closing
And I'm frozen in the shadows
I'm not prepared to run away
And I'm not prepared to fight

I can't stand to reason
Or surrender to a reflex
I will trust my instincts
Or surrender to my fright

Sometimes we freeze, until the light comes
Sometimes we're wrong, and sometimes we're right
Sometimes we fight, against the darkness
Sometimes we fly, into the night

Blood running cold
Mind going down into a dark night
Of a desperate panic
Or a tempest of blind fury
Like a cornered beast
Or a conquering hero

Sometimes I fight

Sometimes I fly, into the night

Rush,"The dancer slows her frantic pace
In pain and desperation
Her aching limbs and downcast face
Aglow with perspiration 

Stiff as wire, her lungs on fire
With just the briefest pause 
The flooding through her memory
The echoes of old applause

She limps across the floor
And closes her bedroom door
The writer stares with glassy eyes

Defies the empty page
His beard is white, his face is lined
And streaked with tears of rage

Thirty years ago, how the words would flow
With passion and precision
But now his mind is dark and dulled
By sickness and indecision
And he stares out the kitchen door
Where the sun will rise no more

Some are born to move the world
To live their fantasies
But most of us just dream about
The things we'd like to be 

Sadder still to watch it die
Than never to have known it
For you, the blind who once could see
The bell tolls for thee, bell tolls for 
For you, the blind who once could see
Bell tolls for thee, bell tolls for thee",Losing It [*],2015
Rush,"I turn my back to the wind
To catch my breath,
Before I start off again
Driven on,
Without a moment to spend
To pass an evening
With a drink and a friend 

I let my skin get too thin
I'd like to pause,
No matter what I pretend
Like some pilgrim
Who learns to transcend
Learns to live
As if each step was the end 

Time stand still
I'm not looking back
But I want to look around me now
Time stands still

And the places that surround me now

A little bit longer
Make each sensation
A little bit stronger

Experience slips away 
Experience slips away 

Time stands still

I turn my face to the sun
Close my eyes,
Let my defenses down
All those wounds
That I can't get unwound 

I let my past go too fast
No time to pause
If I could slow it all down
Like some captain,
Whose ship runs aground
I can wait until the tide comes around 

Time stand still
I'm not looking back
But I want to look around me now
Time stands still
See more of the people

Nights growing colder

Old friends growing older

I'm feeling mad suicidal, so I think I'm gonna drive (drive)

Lord if you hear me, steer (steer), steer (steer)

I think I need to resign feeling right
My conscious is at easy saying live your life
Got everything I ain't miss much, bra
Got my little paper back I ain't feeling fucked up
My woman got my back so I ain't stressed out
Side looking in, you can say I'm blessed this time
Career still intact got my street cred
Went on with life thinking that deeds dead
But every now and then I get flash backs
And down on my knees in the Aston
God keep my head on the sour wanna spaz out
Load back up that 45 and air a nigga ass out

Awakened me by the sound of the siren
Helicopter spotlights illuminate crime scene
Crowd gathers 'round tryin' to find out what the fuck is happenin'
Wait a minute, time out
I looked a little closer at my t-shirt
I see sports of blood, it's now startin' to bleed words
I'm lost I got blood on my hands, though
And then the camera man starts to pan slow
Realizing what I'm up against
I guess I'm just have to face the consequence
Step back to reality
I gotta think fast, got some motherfuckers after me

Paranoid, got me running for my life now
Homicide, questioning my mama and my wife now
Parking lot, full of cops, got the dogs out
Running, chest burning, out of breath
About to fall out
Hit the corner, parked car at the stop sign
Going back to jail ain't the plan, so the outline
Is to come up with something so I escpape this or
Handcuffed fuck that I ain't better take shit
I rather be carried by a six feet judged by twelve, get in that cell
Or maybe they gon' gun a nigga down
'Cause they don't wanna see me in the trial

Rushlow Harris,"Stumbled across an old green box in my granddaddy's house
Inside was a cross, some old dog tags, and a picture of when he was shipping out
So I showed it to him, said, ""tell me about those days.""
When he looked inside, he closed his eyes all he could say was

""I hear bagpipes cryin' Amazing Grace, Omaha Beach and her crashing waves
Old Glory draped like Heaven's mercy over the fallen sons
I see all the heroes who were willing to fight in the name of freedom, layin' down their lives
And prayin' God's grace would keep us safe from harm, until they brought us boys back home.""

Those were words to a boy that became a man, now I'm ankle deep in this Persian sand
And every day I'm giving all I can because I'm damn proud to be American
Yeah, I made some friends, and I've lost some too
When I think about what they gave for me and you

I hear bagpipes cryin' Amazing Grace, tears rolling down a mother's face
Old Glory draped like Heaven's mercy over the fallen sons
I see all the heroes who are willing to fight in the name of freedom, layin' down their lives
And prayin' God's grace would keep us safe from harm, until they bring us boys back home

Hotel room with a ten and twenties

Even if I crash, I'd rather drive than be the passenger
Slightly philosophical, I wanna die young as old as possible
As of late, I been feelin' responsible
For my family's livelihood, I think tonight we should
Celebrate the fact that I'm a star and that the likelihood
Of me blowin', in the next couple of months is definite
Anticipate me comin' like the porn stars in my messages
Speakin' of porn stars, all my exes all Latinas
Hits them like Tequila when they see me in arenas, and yeah
It hasn't happened yet but trust me, y'all gon' pay for it
Beatin' devils in disguise is everything I prayed for
I learned a lot though from all the above
I guess God got a job at the comedy club
But fuck that, I'm buzzin' now, whole industry flockin'
'Cause I'm the people's champ and you just industry poppin', c'mon

I been travelin' a lot now
Got to find the time to
Take it in and take a step back
Kick it with the family
I cannot help it that I'm focused on my vision
All the time, it just feels like it's an emergency
I tell my mama, don't you cry, I'll be back soon though
I'm always moving with a sense of urgency

Yeah, yeah, I swear I had a year that you can't ignore
I swear that no one's ever won, how I'm winnin' before
Pretty women like Julia Roberts come to the concerts
And scream daddy but I ain't about to adopt her
I gotta conquer and collect
Every motherfuckin' check, tryna pay a couple tuitions
Write 'em off as an expense
Let the takeover commence
If I say it, I believe it, you just dream of success
I stay awake to achieve it, it's crazy seeing
Girls I used to crush on, fuckin' to my love songs
Yeah, I'm gettin' commas but I'm 'bout to get my run on
Flights bi-coastal, everythin' paid for
That's just how it goes when you take what they wait for
Things are pickin' up, I'm just tryna find the peace
Some people shine and give it back but my shine is not a lease
This is permanently owned, if I lose it, it's on my terms
I don't wish for shit, I desired and acquire

No failure is final, no success is permanent
It's madness, mom really 'bout to march like the tournament
Certain shits been fuckin' up my days and nights
Like yeah, my parents got no money so I guess I gotta pay the price
At least I have it, let me get my blessings straight
If this was last year, we'd be food stamps and Section 8
Awkward conversations with my dad he's feelin' cursed
He's askin' me for gas it's like the roles are reversed
Monitor what Russ is makin', feelin' like I'm suffocatin'
Feelin' like I need 10 shots and 2 blunts to chase it
Acceptin' what is and lettin' go of what was
Havin' faith in what could be if I just one up
Myself every time I let the chips fall, where they may
I got pit stops in LA, makin' shit pop every day, yeah
People stumble on stones that I used to step on
The chips I mentioned earlier, I pick 'em up and bet on myself

You, always complaining like a bitch do

Me, self-made, my circles on the same shit
You, got a different crew every weekend
You, don't want it that bad, keep sleeping

Yeah, you wished for it, me, I worked for it
Everyone passed on me like Kurt Warner
Search warrant needed, your career went missin'
This ain't overnight, this is year ten visions
Peers listen and they know that I'm up next
That's your girl? Why she always do whatever Russ says?
Success is somethin' that I'm blessed with mentally (yeah)
I got plaques for my raps and my melodies
Can't forget about the beats too, I'm the best kept secret
Real shit or fake shit, pledge your allegiance
I was off for so long, now I'm on though
Bitch, I'm talkin', don't you interrupt this God flow
Thank you to anyone who ever slammed the door on me
Because of you, I did it myself, so it means more to me
Did so many free shows and now they can't afford the fee
No one gave a fuck and now the whole world's recordin' me, yeah

Lately, I been tryna minimize all my stresses
Seven figures when they tax me, that's a blessin'
Diss me, I'mma diss you back on a hit song
PDs love me worldwide, you'll get shit on
Get it on your own or I can't respect it
See me in person, don't call, don't text it
Show a lot of love to my people, I don't post it
Y'all don't gotta know, just as long as they know it (yeah)
Despite your efforts, I'm here and I always will be
No rap name to hide behind, this the real me
Before the plaques, I was certified
I do business, I keep my income diversified
I counted 35 thousand with my family last night
And another 35 before this verse
I be layin' wide awake up in my thoughts at night like
""Goddamn, motherfucker, this worked""

It's gettin' harder to tell the difference between reality and dreams
The lines keep blurrin' like I'm drivin' half asleep
I'm invitin' you to see who's next up in this rap shit
Hooks, beats and verses, every song I score a hat trick
Always said I'd never sign but lately, I been tempted
'Cause my dad just asked for gas money, my mom just said she spent it
It's easy to pass judgement when you comfortable in life
But desperation breeds a beast, the truth won't always be polite
So I'm fresh up off the flight, headed towards a life boat
Hope their word has good credit like a FICO
Only time will tell but I been feelin' like it's my time
How long you gonna keep your star player on the sidelines?
But, I'm the coach, guess God is the owner
Guess I'm just waitin' for that tap on my shoulder
Tellin' me to go in, I'mma stop the game
Blow the whistle like Snowden, young Terrell Owens
Makin' noise, still one of the greats though
I never RIP, I want MVP written on my gravestone
Your boy buzzin' in I swear this life is like a game show
One man army, when I sing, I get Tank hoes
Yeah, you know that R&B freak love
Weed so loud, I need you all to speak up
I hope every album that I drop has Carter III buzz
Wake up, I'm tryna live a life you couldn't dream of
I'm careful with who I include in all of this
'Cause most want a free ride but I ain't handin' out scholarships
Went to college for a semester
All it taught me was that college ain't for everyone
I'm not like everybody, so I left
My mom still supported but she was upset
'Till she saw the crowd scream my name out on Sunset
She got to watch her son light up the whole spot
Right there in that moment it's like she understood my whole plot
Different women, different offers every day now
I could see the reason why some people wanna hate now
'Cause my past 24 been more action packed than Jack Bauer
Made 100 thousand in the past hour
It's been a whirlwind, let me hit the blunt with you
Barely in the industry and I already got trust issues
Damn, or maybe past relationships, did that
I gave 'em all my trust and I ain't never get this shit back
But, fuck it, 'cause I'm on to new things
I looked up at the sky, long enough, I grew wings
Now I'm talkin' to myself like they gon' try and break you
God forbid that happens, breakdowns create break-throughs
I'm sittin' on a debut, sounds like your greatest hits
Labels tryna eat, so of course they want a stake in it
Of course they're talkin' money, so of course I entertain this shit
Of course they lookin' at my table tryna find a place to sit
I'm patient with my process, weighin' all my options
Ya'll talkin' way too much, all these phone calls sound like auctions
Funny 'cause y'all used to laugh when I would say I'm ready
Now the ones who doubted me are gonna tell you how they met me
When I'm standin' where I knew I would, number 1 spot
Another year, another rapper, yeah, another one flop
Y'all barely fuckin' the game, you on the scene for 5 minutes
Then you bust and it's over, I'm a movie, you're just a snippet
This that '89 Pistons, fuck the game up, get rings shit
Name your favorite rapper, bet I got him on my hit list
Name your dream girl, bet I end up on her wish list
Tell me how you want it, beast raps, or I could sing shit
It's time to wake up, industry full of hypnotists
I speak for myself, I don't need a ventriloquist
I need a vacation to where the real people live
You just stay on vacation, havin' real ego trips
You don't wanna admit, that without you I'll be fine
But the truth is hard to swallow when you chokin' on your pride
That goes for the girls I swooped in on
Made their brain drool, they gave top with a bib on
Always keep my switch on, watch me illuminate
Up at the studio, Drake is just a room away
Maybe I should barge in, maybe I should wait

The snakes and the lies and the gossip in this industry
And fuck these WWE-ass rappers
High school mentality, glee-ass rappers

Rappers dissin' for attention that their music ain't gettin'
I understand, it's frustratin' watching my rapid ascension
Watching arenas sell out, watching my plaques multiply
When you ain't headlined a tour, and when you drop they don't buy
But you got followers though, but what they followin' for
But that's 'cause most of them are fake, let me let your followers know
That y'all be payin' social media agencies twenty thou' every month
Just to comment, like, and follow your account
It's all a front, y'all are glorified Instagram entertainers
Got millions of followers, but can't even sell out your basement
Y'all droppin' antics and skits 'cause you can't drop a hit
Flashin' jewelry, posting lean, poppin' Xanax for clicks
Infatuated with designer, costume shop carollers
Bunch of crackheads and clowns, bunch of Boondocks characters
Damn, y'all not scarin' us with your Internet loose lips

Used to have to pack houses

My parents' marriage in shambles
I won't lie, it hurts
I thought money would fix it, but it just made it get worse
See my dad was the man, 'til his job cut ties
He went broke, I got rich, that shit fucked with his pride
Yeah, I recognize it was disturbing to see
The family stopped turnin' to him and started turnin' to me
Going through it, I know he tried to hide the pain
If he gave up and got a job, his dad died in vain
'Cause his dad ran a business
So my dad tried to run one too but there's a difference
No income, my dad started losin' his confidence
Meanwhile, everyday I got brand new accomplishments
At the height of my career was his lowest

To the point that when I walk into the booth, that's what I let out
Makes for good songs but mentally I'm tryna get out
Tryna focus on the good, not the evil
Can't complain, this how I always greet people
I'm exhausted, exasperated from the pain that I'm facin' and masquerading
Don't get it twisted, I'm grateful for everything

Look at the fix you've put me in!!

Since you've been gone, since you've been gone
I'm outta my head, can't take it
Could I be wrong, but since you've been gone
You cast the spell, so break it

I read the words that you sent to me
I can take the afternoon, the night-time comes around too soon
You can't know what you mean to me

Just goes to show you don't give a damn

A voice is waiting for me, to set it free, I got the key, I got the key

 There in the rain they bide their time, hustling what they can

The pines and the willows know soon we will part
There's a whisper in the wind of promises unspoken
And a love that will always remain in my heart

My thoughts will return to the sound of your laughter
The magic of moving as one
And a time we'll remember long ever after
The moonlight and music and dancing are done

Will we climb the hills once more?
Will we walk the woods together?
Will I feel you holding me close once again?
Will every song we've sung stay with us forever?
Will you dance in my dreams or my arms until then?

Under the moon the mountains lie sleeping
Over the lake the stars shine
They wonder if you and I will be keeping

Who lights the stars at night?
Who dreamt up someone so divine?
Someone like you and made them mine?

Raised to be a miner by a miners callused hands
Passed my youth between these mountains where I grew to understand
That family was the word of God and faith was it's demand
And life and death the same came from the coal beneath this land

Well, a rich man writes the book of laws a poor man must defend

I've walked among these people, heard the stories that they tell
I've crawled beside them in the mines and touched the walls of hell
I've shared their sacred secrets, known their triumph and their pain
And right or wrong I'll stand with them on the final judgment day

They say God gives his comfort when the time of trouble comes
They say we'll know no share of peace till we lay down our guns

Or will he, like me, be told that he must be his father's son?

When the bankers swarm like locusts they're turning away our yields
Our dreams roll by our silo, silver in the rain
And leave our pockets full of nothing and our dreams in the golden grain

Have you sees the folks in line downtown at the station?
They're all buying their tickets out and they're talking a great depression
Our parents had their hard times fifty years ago
When they stood out in these empty fields in dust as deep as snow

And all this trouble in our fields
If this rain can fall, these wounds can heal
They'll never take our native soil
If we sell that new John Deere
Then we'll work  these farm with sweat and tears

You'll be the mule, I'll be the plow
Come harvest time, we'll work it out
There's still a lot of love
Here in these troubled fields

There's a book up on the shelf about the dust bowl days
There's a little bit of you and a little bit of me in the photos in every page
Now our children live in the city and they rest upon our shoulders
They never want the rain to fall or the weather to get colder

And all this trouble in our fields
If this rain can fall these wounds can heal
They'll never take our native soil, no

No hugs or tears that way, it's probably for the best
Sent cards along the way
Said I was looking for a brand new life
I never settled down
My wanderlust would always cut the ties like a knife
Sometimes the lonesome wind
Calls out just like it knows me
And on a night like this
When I don't know where to go, he shows me the way

He knows me, my brother wind
He's lonely too and he takes me away

I always looked ahead
I was so afraid that I'd be caught behind
Followed a crooked stream
To places I'd never seen and one more highway sign
Just like some other guys
I count the hours 'til the day will end
But it's not so I can rest
For me it's the time that's best for talking to my friend

Cause he knows me, my brother wind
He's lonely too and he takes me away

Now half my life is gone
The only home I have is open road
My skin is cracked and brown
A mirror to the dessert ground and the dusty wind that blows
I never made a mark
Just scattered footsteps on the shifting sand
Whatever pushes me
It's something only he can understand

He knows me, my brother wind
He's lonely too and he takes me away",Brother Wind,2014

Reach down for the sweet stuff when she looks at me 
I know any man sees you like I see 
Follow down the side street movin' single file

Russ Barenberg,"It being in the springtime and the small birds they were singing
Down by yon shady harbour I carelessly did stray
The thrushes they were warbling, the violets they were charming
To view fond lovers talking, a while I did delay

She said, my dear don't leave me all for another season
Though fortune does be pleasing I'll go along with you
I'll forsake friends and relations and bid this Irish Nation
And to the bonny Bann banks forever I'll bid adieu

He said, my dear don't grieve or yet annoy my patience
You know I love you dearly the more I'm going away
I'm going to a foreign nation to purchase a plantation
To comfort us hereafter all in America

Then after a short while a fortune does be pleasing
“Twill cause them for to smile at our late going away
We'll be happy as Queen Victoria, all in her greatest glory
We'll be drinking wine and porter, all in America

If you were in your bed lying and thinking on dying
The sight of the lovely Bann banks your sorrow you'd give o'er
Or if were down one hour, down in yon shady bower
Pleasure would surround you, you'd think on death no more

Then fare you well, sweet Craigie Hill, where often times I've roved
I never thought my childhood days I'd part you any more

Russ Barenberg,"Last night I dreamed my head was in fever
Last night I dreamed it never was so far
To reach the shore of safety and redemption
And a gaze upon the bright morning star

I dreamed I was by friends all put abandoned
I dreamed I was alone but for my scars
And blinded by the tears that fell like water
No more to see the bright morning star

The streets of dreams never looked this lonely
The streets of dreams never felt this hard
And I heard my voice barely of a whisper
As the clouds denied the bright morning star

Sometimes this life is no more than a moment
And sometimes this light is lost unto the dark
But courage hears the sound of dawn approaching
And each our own, bright morning star

I woke to find every window open
I woke to find the heavy door jar
And I walked outside and stood upon the hilltop
And gazed one small bright morning star

I walked outside and every bird was singing
As I found again my bright morning star
",Bright Morning Star,2014
Russ Barenberg,"Well I know it ain't been roses lately, baby, it's just been thorns
And no matter what we do, nothing seems to change
Love has always been my shelter, for you it's been a storm
But for a while I thought we'd almost beat the rain

Now there's a hole here in my pocket where all my dreams have gone
Fallen out like so many nickels and dimes
And last of all you, you'd always been my good luck charm
I should've known that luck's a waste of time

'Cause it don't bring you love if you don't love
And it don't bring you time if you ain't got time
And it don't bring you strength, baby, if you ain't strong
And it don't bring you kindness if you ain't kind

Now there's a whole lot of life to be unsure of
But there's one thing I can safely say I know
That of all the things that finally desert us
Pride is always the last thing to go

But it won't bring you love if you don't love
And it won't bring you time if you ain't got time
And it won't bring you strength, baby, if you ain't strong
And it won't bring you kindness if you ain't kind

And now I wish you only roses, baby, without the thorns
And I hope your dreams are always within reach
And I wish you shelter, baby, from all your storms
They scared you, but they never seemed to teach

That I can't bring you love if you don't love
And I can't bring you time if you ain't got time
And I can't bring you strength, baby, if you ain't strong
And I can't bring you kindness if you ain't kind

Russ Barenberg,"I can tell by the way you're walking
You don't want company 
I'll let you alone and I'll let you walk on 
And in your own good time you'll be 

Back where the sun can find you
Under the wise wishing tree 
And with all of them made we'll lie under the shade
And call it a jubilee

And I can tell by the way you're talking
That the past isn't letting you go 
But there's only so long you can take it all on
And then the wrong's gotta be on its own

And when you're ready to leave it behind you
You'll look back and all that you'll see 
Is the wreckage and rust that you left in the dust
On your way to the jubilee

And I can tell by the way you're listening
That you're still expecting to hear 
Your name being called like a summons to all
Who have failed to account for their doubts and their fears

They can't add up to to much without you
And so if it were up to me, I'd take hold of your hand 
Saying come hear the band
Play your song at the jubilee 

And I can tell by the way you're searching
For something you can't even name  
That you haven't been able to come to the table
Simply glad that you came

When you feel like this try to imagine
That we're all like frail boats on the sea 
Just scanning the night for that great guiding light
Announcing the jubilee 

And I can tell by the way you're standing
With your eyes filling with tears 
That it's habit alone that keeps you turning for home
Even though your home is right here

Where the people who love you are gathered
Under the wise wishing tree 
May we all be considered then straight on delivered
Down to the jubilee 

Because to people who love you are waiting
And they'll wait just as long as need be 
When we look back and say those were halcyon days 
We're talking about jubilee",Jubilee,2014
Russ Barenberg,"There was a time when we?d be the last to leave 
Watching the sun come up while everyone fell asleep

Until I?d fall in your arms and into your lovin? touch 
Now as the years roll by, time has reeled me in 
I?ve slowed down a notch or two from the way things were then 

Those old ways of mine, I?ve left them behind 
Those crazy days are through 
The only thing I still do like I used to do 
Is carry this torch for you 

Remember the days when we?d pack our bags and run 
Chasing a crazy dream into the morning sun 
Now as the twilight falls, I find I?m satisfied 
Watching the fire glow as long as you?re by my side 
Here in my heart it seems, time has passed me by 
I love you as much today as the very first time

Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another

Up on my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping

To celebrate this night we've found each other
Mm, let's get lost

Russ Freeman,"Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me
Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last
Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Chills run up and down my spine

Russ Freeman,"Long ago my heart and mind
Got together and designed
The wonderful girl for me
Oh what a fantasy

Thought the ideal of my heart
Can't be ordered a la carte
I wonder if she will be
Always a fantasy

Will I ever find the girl in my mind?
The one who is my ideal
Maybe she's a dream and yet she might be
Just around the corner waiting for me

Will I recognize the light in her eyes
That no other eyes reveal
Or will I pass her by and never even know
That she was my ideal

Will I recognize the light in her eyes
That no other eyes reveal
Or will I pass her by and never even know
That she is my ideal",My Ideal,1996
Russ Freeman,"I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling, is still in my heart
 
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start

The thrill is gone
I can see it in your eyes
I can hear it in your sighs
Feel your touch and realize
The thrill is gone

The nights are cold
For love is old
Love was grand when love was new
Birds were singing, skies were blue
Now it don't appeal to you
The thrill is gone

This is the end
So why pretend
And let it linger on
The thrill is gone

Russ Freeman,"Time after time I tell myself that I'm
So lucky to be loving you
So lucky to be 
The one you run to see
In the evening when the day is through

I only know what I know
The passing years will show
You've kept my love so young, so new
And time after time
You'll hear me say that I'm
So lucky to be loving you

Russ Freeman,"You don't know what love is
Until you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you had to loose
You don't know what love is

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost
Until you've flipped you're heart and you have lost
You don't know what love is

Do you know how a lost heart fears
The thought of reminiscing
And how lips have taste of tears
Loose the taste for kissing

You don't know how hearts burn
For love that cannot live, yet never dies
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes
You don't know what love is

This is my co-host, Bob Buttafuoco
(Hey hey guys) Yeah yeah yeah
We got a crowd that's in a frenzy Bob
Let's go down to the announcers for the start of the game

And now, please rise for the singing of our national anthem

I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)
It took a whole lot of trying
Just to get up that hill
I said but now we're up in the big leagues
My dirty it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we living, it's Lunatics player
It ain't nothing wrong with that, batter up

I'm the first to swing
Home run with that give-me-what-you-got thing, hot wings
Fuck a dub, smoke an ounce, show me love
Hit the club, me and T-Luv holla what
I put my mack down, she throw a curve ball
She owed Milli smoked that herb and some Llly-bone
She tip-top 'em, Optimo
First base, god living like a worst race
First chase, throw yo' people and yo' kind
Second lesson, smoke that herb and clear yo' mind
It's about time, second base wisdom rhyme
Sitting strong, skipped third base and headed home
Third baseman just don't understand baby what the bong
What the fuck wrong, with this world today
With these girls today, diamonds and pearls the way
You wasn't fucking with me, leave, for the wrap that's in my seed
Now you stays on yo knees cause we's be in the big league

Well you should see me now, I'm eating Wheaties now
I'm stealing second and third and looking home peeping greedy now
See me now, people call me speedy now
Known for running the quickest miles
hit and run in any town, any ground
Rules 'fore I hit it, split it, lick it and quit it
And hit it, lick it, did I say lick it, (yeah) fuck it, lick it
Ain't no shame in my game, that normal shit ain't my thing
If I think with my dick then put your mouth on my brain
I maintain through the atmosphere, what we got here
A sucker in fear, hear the roars and the cheers
From the crowd when I take the mile, let me show 'em how
Hit the ball on the ground and make 'em get down

A good high school out in U-City of St. Louis, Missouri
(I think his name's umm, who knows,
Murphey Lee or something)

I want my name not, not said but screamed
I went from fantasies to dreams, dreams to bigger things
I'm like Bennett I been in it since, ninety-three
You can tell cause my L angle 90 degrees
I'ma sixteen year-old school boy, platinum skills
Swear to tell the real, the whole real to make a mill'
I lie little but still, talk straight up like motto
I could tell you something now, you think twice about it tomorrow
I promise, I gets deeper than file cabinets when rapping
Money, money, money, money what's happening
I'm coming up like family members in basements, and I stay bent
Make a milli to play with, buy a building you can pay me
And the 'tic is who I came with

Russ Freeman,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

So carefree together

That you can't see

How my thoughts go flashing back again to my old flame

For I haven't met a gent so magnificent or elegant as my old flame

I've met so many who had fascinating ways
A fascinating gaze in their eyes, some who took me up to the skies
But their attempts at love were only imitations of my old flame
I can't even think of his name but I'll never be the same 
Until I discover what became of my old flame

Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,2002
Russ Freeman,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2003
Russ Freeman,"They're writing songs of love
But not for me
A lucky star's above
But not for me
With love to lead the way
I've found more clouds of grey
Than any Russian play could guarantee
I was a fool to fall and get that way
Heigh-ho! Alas! And also, lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of her kiss
I guess she's not for me
