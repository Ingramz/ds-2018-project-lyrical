Leona Naess,"Roll the carpet and pour out the wine
Treat me like its your first valentine
'cause honey, baby, you've been on my mind
Like all of us who have waited for a time

I'm calling can you hear me
The angels will steer me
To your door, feel so sure
The night is the brightest
Who knows what I really will hear
What I really will say
What I really will feel
Who knows what you really will hear
What you really will say
What you really will feel

Wall the papers and call your friends
No longer do we have to pretend
'cause honey, baby, you've been on my mind
Like all of us who have waited for a time

I'm calling can you hear me
The angels will steer me
To your door, feel so sure
The night is the brightest
Who knows what I really will hear
What I really will say
What I really will feel
Who knows what you really will hear
What you really will say
What you really will feel

Quicken your beating drums and
Draw me some wildfires

Leona Naess,"Home, I don't know where you could be
Look for you in mountains of oceans across the sea
Though we live under the same moon
Catch you in the glimmer of my spoon

Could you be where love raised his head
Where my youth was gallantly led
And where the sun took a holiday
Fell in love, decided to stay

I'm so tired and down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down

Could you be where my best friend plays
Where the nights bleed longer then the days
Where I lost my only child
Where the're no trees but wolves run wild

Maybe somewhere I've never seen
Tangier's or the banks of Berlin
Strangers they can veil a friendly eye
Rather be with you than a lie

I'm so tired and down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down

Could you be where my angel sleeps
When he sings willows begin to weep
When I think of all I have done
Home you know, you'll be the one

Home, is where my heart is
Home, is where my heart is
Home, is where my heart is
Home, is where my heart is
",Home,2003
Leona Naess,"You're easily amused by what you use
By what you use on the outside
But it's what shines like silver and gold
Silver and gold on the inside
It's a recipe, what it is to be
What it is to be on the inside

The skin outside is taking you for a ride
Taking you for a ride on the inside
And though they're easily to blame
And I'm just listening in on the inside
And when you're old tell me what they'll say
Tell me what they'll say on the inside

So be still, you will find out
From living down on the inside
I'm easily amused by what you use
By what you use for the outside

And it's silver and gold and diamonds
I suppose on the inside
You're silver and gold and diamonds
I suppose shining from the inside

So I'm sorry just the same
Sorry just the same from the inside
It's taken me long to realize this song
Realize it happens on the inside, oh
",Shiny on the Inside,2006
Leona Naess,"If I wanted to ask for your opinion I would
Dreams have reasons and my reasons are good
Dear your logic will never work on me, oh
Work on me, baby

Could be the story I've been reading makes me dream this way
I've got all the lights in the kitchen to keep the ghouls at bay
I could be wrong, you could be right
Out of mind, out of sight, Lord knows I've missed you

Been taking no drinking too far this time
Sit here all morning, try to figure this dream out
Your logic won't work on me, baby
Work on me, baby

Could be the mood I'm breathing makes me sink so low?
I've got friends in the circus performing comedy shows
I could be wrong, you could be right
Out of mind, out of sight, Lord knows I need him

Smile now lonely, smile now lonely
Smile now lonely

Could be the food I'm eating that makes me wanna sleep
I've ghosts in the attic playing dominoes
I could be wrong, you could be right
Out of mind, out of sight, Lords knows I miss him

Could be the places I'm going make me wanna scream
I've got your pictures and stories and those T-shirts with long sleeves
I could be wrong, you could be right
Out of mind, out of sight, Lord knows I need you

You are here tonight, you are here tonight
You are here tonight, you are here tonight
You are here tonight, you are here tonight
You are here tonight, you are here tonight

",Ghost in the Attic,2008
Leona Naess,"Gonna get it right
Gonna put lipstick on tonight
Gonna wear a dress, the one that shows my legs
You'll be running around, running around like a fool

Do I pull my hair out
Shake it out, put it in a bow
Or leave it down, I know, I know
I'm acting like a little girl

But it's not easy for me
But it's lovely to be a little less heavy
And a little old cherry on the icing for me

Walk into the room, talk to everyone but you
Slide in close like a wanted ghost
But when it's time to go
I promise I will let you know

Can I take you home? Maybe take you out
When we're drunk a little less
We can drink some more
But don't you forget the little black dress

No, it's not easy for me
But it's lovely to be a little less heavy
And a little old cherry on the icing for me
Yeah, a little less heavy
And a little old cherry on the icing for me

So you gotta get it right
Put lipstick on tonight
Gonna wear that dress, the one that shows your legs
You'll be running around like a fool

",The Lipstick Song,2008
Leona Naess,"Let's just get married, raise our own family
Everyone's so unhappy
Follow a heart that's asked from the start to bleed

I cannot wait for, I will not wait forever
It's such a drag, nobody knows me better
I'm heavy like Sunday, I wanna be your reason why
I'm heavy like Sunday, I wanna be your reason why

Let's leave those dark days behind
Mistakes are made but our decisions change our design
The damage is nearly said and done
So let's take the money yeah, let's take the money and run

I cannot wait for, I will not wait forever
It's such a drag, nobody knows me better
I'm heavy like Sunday, I wanna be your reason why
I'm heavy like Sunday, I wanna be your alibi

And friends make better lovers 'cause they look you in the eye
And they'll put you in the middle of a thousand whys

I cannot wait for, I will not wait forever
It's such a drag, nobody knows me better
I'm heavy like Sunday, I wanna be your reason why
I'm heavy like Sunday, I wanna be your alibi

I cannot wait for, I will not wait forever
It's such a drag, nobody knows me better
I'm heavy like Sunday, I wanna be your reason why
I'm heavy like Sunday, I wanna be your alibi

I cannot wait for, I will not wait forever

",Heavy Like Sunday,2008
Leona Naess,"Did you ever have a day when it all just came apart?
You thought that this will be the end
You thought that this will be the end
You thought that this will be the end

Did it ever hurt so bad, so vicious, cruel or sad
You thought that nothing good could come
You thought that nothing good could come
You thought that nothing good could come

That's just the way my story goes
Under the sorrow where the blossom grows
There is a darkness
They never show to me

Yeah, I had it pretty good
Growing up late as I could
I was still running around
I was still running around

I was still running around
Then the lightning struck me down
Hit this lonely apple tree down
Now I've been learning as I go

That's just the way my story goes
Under the sorrow where the blossom grows
There is a darkness
They never show to me

Just don't lie to your heart
This will be the hardest part
But lying on the surface
Everybody's got a dark place they hold on to, they all go to

Just don't lie to your heart
This will be the hardest part
But lying on the surface
Everybody's got a dark place they hold on to

Just don't lie to your heart
This will be the hardest part
But lying on the surface
Everybody's got a dark place they hold on to, they hold on to

We're learning as we go
We're learning as we go
We're learning as we go

We are just learning as we go
We are just learning as we go
We are just learning as we go
We are just learning as we go

Have walked 'till they can't hardly move from tryin' to please you
And my back is sore 
From bendin' over backwards to just lay the world at your door.

It was easy said that night we parted that we'd forget we had ever met

As long as I live if it be one hour or if it be one hundred years
I'll keep remembering forever and ever I'll love you dear as long as I live

I know it sounds funny I'll never forget you the only joy that I've ever had

Leonard,"My thoughts go back to a heavenly dance
A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts' content

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

There 'neath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon

The moon descended
And I found with the break of dawn
You and the song had gone
But the melody lingers on",The Song Is Ended,2002
Leonard,"Stay another change of heart, 
Stay another memory, 
Stay another great expectation, 
Stay another late movie.

Stay another spin of the bottle. 
Stay another night of holding on, 
Stay another sweet inspiration, 
Stay another love song.",Stay,2005

Tryin' to get my face in town
Wonderin' the hang where
To turn each time around

Look in your mirror just to see my face
Two way time, baby, it's no disgrace
Oh my, how the times have changed
Oh my, how the times have changed

Leonard,"From the coast of Ipanema
To the Island of Capri
All the way to Guadeloupe
I will follow you wherever you may be

From the moment I first saw you
Knew my heart could not be free

There can never be another for me

Lost in the music, your heart will be mine
All I need is to look in your eyes

Can you feel the heat of passion?
Can you taste our love's sweet wine

And you fall under my spell
I will catch you in my arms now
Where the night will take us no one can tell

Lost in the music, your heart will be mine
All I need is to look in your eyes

Gotta live this moment together

Leonard Barrett Jr.,"I don't ever care to rise to power
I would rather be with you an hour
For the things that one can buy
Are not worth a lover's sigh

I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart
In my heart I have but one desire
And that one is you, no other will do

I just want to be the one you love
And with your admission that you feel the same
I'll have reached the goal I'm dreaming of, believe me

Leonard Bernstein,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.",Arranged Leroy Robertson,1965

And now I keep smart smiling to the faces of the fucking MCs that stole my art.

CÂ´mon-cÂ´mon no we donÂ´t stop
No doubt still weÂ´re shocking and the stage rocks
CÂ´mon-cÂ´mon no we donÂ´t stop
No matter what I keep on rocking with the H-BLOCKX
CÂ´mon-cÂ´mon no we wonÂ´t stop
No doubt still weÂ´re shocking and the stage rocks
CÂ´mon-cÂ´mon to the hot spot
Get it on everybody with the H-BLOCKX

Now let me tell you what it is why we doing this
WeÂ´ve been miles on the road just for the hell of it
The spell of it canÂ´t get me off of it and then I stop think about it
And go on with it
I canÂ´t stop rocking around the block I give a fuck about the slim air
On the top of the pops so what up stand up represent your block King Smo
LetÂ´s go if you donÂ´t stopp
Now try to think of what to do in my situation my raputation no fat

Leonard Cohen,"Give me back my broken night
My mirrored room, my secret life
It's lonely here,
There's no one left to torture
Give me absolute control
Over every living soul
And lie beside me, baby
That's an order

Give me crack and anal sex
Take the only tree that's left
And stuff it up the hole
In your culture
Give me back the berlin wall
Give me stalin and st paul
I've seen the future, brother
It is murder

Things are going to slide, slide in all directions
Won't be nothing
Nothing you can measure anymore
The blizzard, the blizzard of the world
Has crossed the threshold
And it has overturned
The order of the soul
When they said repent repent
I wonder what they meant
When they said repent repent
I wonder what they meant
When they said repent repent
I wonder what they meant

You don't know me from the wind
You never will, you never did
I'm the little jew
Who wrote the bible
I've seen the nations rise and fall
I've heard their stories, heard them all
But love's the only engine of survival
Your servant here, he has been told
To say it clear, to say it cold
It's over, it ain't going
Any further
And now the wheels of heaven stop
You feel the devil's riding crop
Get ready for the future:
It is murder

Things are going to slide 

There'll be the breaking of the ancient
Western code
Your private life will suddenly explode
There'll be phantoms
There'll be fires on the road
And the white man dancing
You'll see a woman
Hanging upside down
Her features covered by her fallen gown
And all the lousy little poets
Coming round
Tryin' to sound like charlie manson
And the white man dancin'

Give me back the berlin wall
Give me stalin and st paul
Give me christ
Or give me hiroshima
Destroy another fetus now
We don't like children anyhow
I've seen the future, baby
It is murder

Things are going to slide

Leonard Cohen,"I believe that you heard your master sing 
When I was sick in bed. 
I suppose that he told you everything 
That I keep locked away in my head. 
Your master took you traveling, 
Well at least that's what you said. 
And now do you come back to bring 
Your prisoner wine and bread? 

You met him at some temple, where 
They take your clothes at the door. 
He was just a numberless man in a chair 
Who'd just come back from the war. 
And you wrap up his tired face in your hair 
And he hands you the apple core. 
Then he touches your lips now so suddenly bare 
Of all the kisses we put on some time before. 

And he gave you a German Shepherd to walk 
With a collar of leather and nails, 
And he never once made you explain or talk 
About all of the little details, 
Such as who had a word and who had a rock, 
And who had you through the mails. 
Now your love is a secret all over the block, 
And it never stops not even when your master fails. 

And he took you up in his aeroplane, 
Which he flew without any hands, 
And you cruised above the ribbons of rain 
That drove the crowd from the stands. 
Then he killed the lights in a lonely Lane 
And, an ape with angel glands, 
Erased the final wisps of pain 
With the music of rubber bands. 

And now I hear your master sing, 
You kneel for him to come. 
His body is a golden string 
That your body is hanging from. 
His body is a golden string, 
My body has grown numb. 
Oh now you hear your master sing, 
Your shirt is all undone. 

And will you kneel beside this bed 
That we polished so long ago, 
Before your master chose instead 
To make my bed of snow? 
Your eyes are wild and your knuckles are red 
And you're speaking far too low. 
No I can't make out what your master said 
Before he made you go. 

Then I think you're playing far too rough 
For a lady who's been to the moon; 
I've lain by this window long enough 
To get used to an empty room. 
And your love is some dust in an old man's cough 
Who is tapping his foot to a tune, 
And your thighs are a ruin, you want too much, 
Let's say you came back some time too soon. 

I loved your master perfectly 
I taught him all that he knew. 
He was starving in some deep mystery 
Like a man who is sure what is true. 
And I sent you to him with my guarantee 
I could teach him something new, 
And I taught him how you would long for me 
No matter what he said no matter what you'd do. 

I believe that you heard your master sing 
While I was sick in bed, 
I'm sure that he told you everything 
I must keep locked away in my head. 
Your master took you travelling, 
Well at least that's what you said, 
And now do you come back to bring 
Your prisoner wine and bread?",Master Song,1967
Leonard Cohen,"The stories of the street are mine, the Spanish voices laugh.
The Cadillacs go creeping now through the night and the poison gas,
And I lean from my window sill in this old hotel I chose,
Yes one hand on my suicide, one hand on the rose.

I know you've heard it's over now and war must surely come,
The cities they are broke in half and the middle men are gone.
But let me ask you one more time, O children of the dusk,
All these hunters who are shrieking now oh do they speak for us?
And where do all these highways go, now that we are free?
Why are the armies marching still that were coming home to me?

O lady with your legs so fine O stranger at your wheel,
You are locked into your suffering and your pleasures are the seal.
The age of lust is giving birth, and both the parents ask
The nurse to tell them fairy tales on both sides of the glass.
And now the infant with his cord is hauled in like a kite,
And one eye filled with blueprints, one eye filled with night.

O come with me my little one, we will find that farm
And grow us grass and apples there and keep all the animals warm.
And if by chance I wake at night and I ask you who I am,
O take me to the slaughterhouse, I will wait there with the lamb.
With one hand on the hexagram and one hand on the girl
I balance on a wishing well that all men call the world.

We are so small between the stars, so large against the sky,
And lost among the subway crowds I try to catch your eye.",Stories of the Street,1967
Leonard Cohen,"It's true that all the men you knew were dealers
Who said they were through with dealing
Every time you gave them shelter
I know that kind of man, it's hard to hold the hand of anyone
Who is reaching for the sky just to surrender
Who is reaching for the sky just to surrender

And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind
You find he did not leave you very much, not even laughter
Like any dealer he was watching for the card that is so high and wild
He'll never need to deal another
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger

And then leaning on your window sill
He'll say one day you caused his will
To weaken with your love and warmth and shelter
And then taking from his wallet
An old schedule of trains, he'll say
I told you when I came I was a stranger

But now another stranger seems
To want you to ignore his dreams
As though they were the burden of some other
Oh, you've seen that man before
His golden arm dispatching cards
But now it's rusted from the elbows to the finger
And he wants to trade the game he plays for shelter
Yes, he wants to trade the game he knows for shelter

Ah, you hate to see another tired man
Lay down his hand like he was giving up the holy game of poker
And while he talks his dreams to sleep you notice there's a highway
That is curling up like smoke above his shoulder
It's curling just like smoke above his shoulder

You tell him to come in sit down
But something makes you turn around
The door is open you can't close your shelter
You try the handle of the road, it opens, do not be afraid
It's you my love, you who are the stranger
It is you my love, you who are the stranger

Well, I've been waiting, I was sure
We'd meet between the trains we're waiting for
I think it's time to board another
Please understand, I never had a secret chart
To get me to the heart of this or any other matter
Well, he talks like this you don't know what he's after
When he speaks like this you don't know what he's after

Let's meet tomorrow if you choose
Upon the shore, beneath the bridge
That they are building on some endless river
Then he leaves the platform for the sleeping car that's warm
You realize, he's only advertising one more shelter
And it comes to you, he never was a stranger
And you say okay, the bridge or someplace later

And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind
You find he did not leave you very much, not even laughter
Like any dealer he was watching for the card that is so high and wild
He'll never need to deal another
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger

And then leaning on your window sill
He'll say one day you caused his will
To weaken with your love and warmth and shelter
And then taking from his wallet
An old schedule of trains, he'll say
I told you when I came I was a stranger
I told you when I came I was a stranger
I told you when I came I was a stranger
I told you when I came I was a stranger",The Stranger Song,1967
Leonard Cohen,"I met a woman long ago
Her hair the black that black can go,
Are you a teacher of the heart?
Soft she answered, no.

I met a girl across the sea,
Her hair the gold that gold can be,
Are you a teacher of the heart?
Yes, but not for thee.

I met a man who lost his mind
In some lost place I had to find,
Follow me, the wise man said,
But he walked behind.

I walked into a hospital
Where none was sick and none was well,
When at night the nurses left
I could not walk at all.

Morning came and then came noon,
Dinner time a scalpel blade
Lay beside my silver spoon.

Some girls wander by mistake
Into the mess that scalpels make.
Are you the teachers of my heart?
We teach old hearts to break.

One morning I woke up alone,
The hospital and the nurses gone.
Have I carved enough my Lord?
Child, you are a bone.

I ate and ate and ate,
No, I did not miss a plate, well
How much do these suppers cost?
Well take it out in hate.

I spent my hatred everyplace,
On every work, on every face,
Someone gave me wishes
And I wished for an embrace.

Several girls embraced me, then
I was embraced by men,
Is my passion perfect?
No, do it once again.

I was handsome, I was strong,
I knew the words of every song.
Did my singing please you?
No, the words you sang were wrong.

Who is it whom I address,
Who takes down what I confess?
Are you the teachers of my heart?
We teach old hearts to rest.

Oh teachers are my lessons done?
I cannot do another one.
They laughed and laughed and said
Well child,
Are your lessons done?
Are your lessons done?
Are your lessons done?",Teachers,1967
Leonard Cohen,"Trav'ling lady, stay awhile 
Until the night is over. 
I'm just a station on your way, 
I know I'm not your lover. 
Well I lived with a child of snow 
When I was a soldier, 
And I fought every man for her 
Until the nights grew colder. 

She used to wear her hair like you 
Except when she was sleeping, 
And then she'd weave it on a loom 
Of smoke and gold and breathing. 

And why are you so quiet now 
Standing there in the doorway? 
You chose your journey long before 
You came upon this highway.

Leonard Cohen,"I remember the promise
That you made in the barn
When the kittens were born
And you could not keep warm

So you moved away the mountain
That the sun rose behind
And you said yourself a prayer
And laid down with the blind

But you lost them in your freedom
And you need him now, you're wild
Blessed is the memory
Of everybody's child

And the vow of compassion
That you swore through your teeth
When the war began to end
And the photographs weep

Well, nobody blames you
As the train pulls away
With its cargo of snow
For these German paper-weights

But you lost them in your freedom
And you need him now, you're wild
Blessed is the memory
Of everybody's child

Well, its five in the morning
There's no one home
Except for your wife
And your child on the phone

Somebody's got to listen
To a promise or two
Oh, this room is far too small
For a pilgrim like you

But you lost them in your freedom
And you need him now, you're wild
Blessed is the memory
Of everybody's child

So, now that you've decided
To follow the sun
Like a shadow of birds
Or a King on the run

Oh, your chains are too dark
For the seas you must swim
You're smiling at the seaweed
But your smile is too grim

But you lost them in your freedom
And you need him now, you're wild

Thinking of the past
We swore to each other then
Our love would surely last

And your love is too vast

But I know from your eyes
And I know from your smile
That tonight will be fine
Will be fine, will be fine, will be fine
For a while

I choose the rooms that I live in with care
The windows are small and the walls almost bare
There's only one bed and there's only one prayer

But I know from your eyes
And I know from your smile
That tonight will be fine
Will be fine, will be fine, will be fine
For a while

Oh, sometimes I see her undressing for me
She's the soft naked lady love meant her to be
And she's moving her body so brave and so free

Leonard Cohen,"A bunch of lonesome and very quarrelsome heroes 
Were smoking out along the open road; 
The night was very dark and thick between them, 
Each man beneath his ordinary load. 

""I'd like to tell my story,"" 
Said one of them so young and bold, 
""I'd like to tell my story, 
Before I turn into gold."" 

But no one really could hear him, 
The night so dark and thick and green; 
Well I guess that these heroes must always live there 
Where you and I have only been. 

Put out your cigarette, my love, 
You've been alone too long; 
And some of us are very hungry now 
To hear what it is you've done that was so wrong. 

I sing this for the crickets, 
I sing this for the army, 
I sing this for your children 
And for all who do not need me.

Leonard Cohen,"I came upon a butcher,
He was slaughtering a lamb,
I accused him there
With his tortured lamb.

He said, Listen to me, child,
I am what I am and you, you are my only son.
Well, I found a silver needle,
I put it into my arm.

It did some good,
Did some harm.
But the nights were cold
And it almost kept me warm,
How come the night is long?
I saw some flowers growing up
Where that lamb fell down

Was I supposed to praise my Lord,
Make some kind of joyful sound?
He said, Listen, listen to me now,
I go round and round
And you, you are my only child.

Do not leave me now,
Do not leave me now,

From a recent fall.

Which some killer will be lighting for pay.
Into this furnace I ask you now to venture,
You whom I cannot betray.

I fought in the old revolution
On the side of the ghost and the King.
Of course I was very young
And I thought that we were winning;
I can't pretend I still feel very much like singing
As they carry the bodies away.
Into this furnace I ask you now to venture

Lately you've started to stutter
As though you had nothing to say.
To all of my architects let me be traitor.
Now let me say I myself gave the order
To sleep and to search and to destroy.
Into this furnace I ask you now to venture

Yes, you who are broken by power,
You who are absent all day,
You who are kings for the sake of your children's story,

Leonard Cohen,"It seems so long ago,
Nancy was alone,
Looking ate the Late Late show
Through a semi-precious stone.
In the House of Honesty
Her father was on trial,
In the House of Mystery
There was no one at all,
There was no one at all.

It seems so long ago,
None of us were strong
Nancy wore green stockings
And she slept with everyone.

She never said she'd wait for us
Although she was alone,
I think she fell in love for us
In nineteen sixty one,
In nineteen sixty one.

It seems so long ago,
Nancy was alone,
A forty five beside her head,
An open telephone.

We told her she was beautiful,
We told her she was free
But none of us would meet her in
The House of Mystery,
The House of Mystery.

And now you look around you,
See her everywhere,
Many use her body,
Many comb her hair.

In the hollow of the night
When you are cold and numb
You hear her talking freely then,
She's happy that you've come,
She's happy that you've come.","Seems So Long Ago, Nancy",1969
Leonard Cohen,"The door it opened slowly, 
My father he came in, 
I was nine years old. 
And he stood so tall above me, 
His blue eyes they were shining 
And his voice was very cold. 
He said, ""I've had a vision 
And you know I'm strong and holy, 
I must do what I've been told."" 
So he started up the mountain, 
I was running, he was walking, 
And his axe was made of gold. 

Well, the trees they got much smaller, 
The lake a lady's mirror, 
We stopped to drink some wine. 
Then he threw the bottle over. 
Broke a minute later 
And he put his hand on mine. 
Thought I saw an eagle 
But it might have been a vulture, 
I never could decide. 
Then my father built an altar, 
He looked once behind his shoulder, 
He knew I would not hide. 

You who build these altars now 
To sacrifice these children, 
You must not do it anymore. 
A scheme is not a vision 
And you never have been tempted 
By a demon or a god. 
You who stand above them now, 
Your hatchets blunt and bloody, 
You were not there before, 
When I lay upon a mountain 
And my father's hand was trembling 
With the beauty of the word. 

And if you call me brother now, 
Forgive me if I inquire, 
""just according to whose plan?"" 
When it all comes down to dust 
I will kill you if I must, 
I will help you if I can. 
When it all comes down to dust

Changing from nothing to one.

Sometimes I need you naked,
Sometimes I need you wild,
I need you to carry my children in
And I need you to kill a child.
You know who I am

If you should ever track me down
I will surrender there
And I will leave with you one broken man

Leonard Cohen,"Well I stepped into an avalanche,
It covered up my soul;
When I am not this hunchback that you see,
I sleep beneath the golden hill.
You who wish to conquer pain,
You must learn, learn to serve me well.

You strike my side by accident
As you go down for your gold.
The cripple here that you clothe and feed
Is neither starved nor cold;
He does not ask for your company,
Not at the centre, the centre of the world.

When I am on a pedestal,
You did not raise me there.
Your laws do not compel me
To kneel grotesque and bare.
I myself am the pedestal
For this ugly hump at which you stare.

You who wish to conquer pain,
You must learn what makes me kind;
The crumbs of love that you offer me,
They're the crumbs I've left behind.
Your pain is no credential here,
It's just the shadow, shadow of my wound.

I have begun to long for you,
I who have no greed
I have begun to ask for you,
I who have no need.
You say you've gone away from me,
But I can feel you when you breathe.

Do not dress in those rags for me,

It is your flesh that I wear.",Avalanche,1971

And I didn't feel like very much. 
I said to myself, ""Where are you golden boy, 
Where is your famous golden touch?"" 
I thought you knew where 
All of the elephants lie down, 
I thought you were the crown prince 
Of all the wheels in Ivory Town. 

Just take a look at your body now, 
There's nothing much to save 
And a bitter voice in the mirror cries, 
""Hey, Prince, you need a shave."" 

Now if you can manage to get 
Your trembling fingers to behave, 
Why don't you try unwrapping 
A stainless steel razor blade? 

That's right, it's come to this, 
Yes it's come to this, 
And wasn't it a long way down, 
Wasn't it a strange way down? 

There's no hot water 
And the cold is running thin. 
Well, what do you expect from 
The kind of places you've been living in? 

Don't drink from that cup, 
It's all caked and cracked along the rim. 
That's not the electric light, my friend, 
That is your vision growing dim. 

Cover up your face with soap, there, 
Now you're Santa Claus. 
And you've got a gift for anyone 
Who will give you his applause. 

I thought you were a racing man, 
Ah, but you couldn't take the pace. 
That's a funeral in the mirror 
And it's stopping at your face. 

That's right, it's come to this, 
Yes it's come to this, 
And wasn't it a long way down, 
Ah wasn't it a strange way down? 

Once there was a path 
And a girl with chestnut hair, 
And you passed the summers 
Picking all of the berries that grew there
There were times she was a woman, 
Oh, there were times she was just a child, 
And you held her in the shadows 
Where the raspberries grow wild. 

And you climbed the twilight mountains 
And you sang about the view, 
And everywhere that you wandered 
Love seemed to go along with you. 
That's a hard one to remember, 
Yes it makes you clench your fist. 

And then the veins stand out like highways, 
All along your wrist. 
And yes it's come to this, 
It's come to this, 
And wasn't it a long way down, 
Wasn't it a strange way down? 

You can still find a job, 
Go out and talk to a friend. 
On the back of every magazine 
There are those coupons you can send. 
Why don't you join the Rosicrucians, 
They can give you back your hope, 
You can find your love with diagrams 
On a plain brown envelope. 

But you've used up all your coupons 
Except the one that seems 
To be written on your wrist 
Along with several thousand dreams.

And he puts on his dark glasses 
And he shows you where to hit

Between the hour and the age,
Once again, once again,
Love calls you by your name.

Shouldering your loneliness
Like a gun that you will not learn to aim,
You stumble into this movie house,
Then you climb, you climb into the frame.
Yes, and here, right here
Between the moonlight and the lane,
Between the tunnel and the train,
Between the victim and his stain,
Once again, once again,
Love calls you by your name.

I leave the lady meditating
On the very love which I, I do not wish to claim,
I journey down the hundred steps,
But the street is still the very same.
And here, right here,
Between the dancer and his cane,
Between the sailboat and the drain,
Between the newsreel and your tiny pain,
Once again, once again,
Love calls you by your name.

Where are you, Judy, where are you, Anne? 
Where are the paths your heroes came? 
Wondering out loud as the bandage pulls away,
Was I, was I only limping, was I really lame? 
Oh here, come over here,
Between the windmill and the grain,
Between the sundial and the chain,
Between the traitor and her pain,
Once again, once again,
Love calls you by your name.",Love Calls You by Your Name,1971
Leonard Cohen,"Getting sick of starting over
On the same
Argument
We could sit around and talk it over 
Or take a trip
To clear our minds
At the entrance of Mount Wilson
It's feeling like the right decision
Some times you go outside
To get inside
If I could only hear you say
That you are down but you're ok
We should have said the things we felt
Is it too late
Park the car and hit the trail
The air feels sharp
On our skin
We'll see the snow as it is melting
Spring must be on
Her way again
We didn't see her coming for us
I guess that's mother nature's way
Sometimes you go outside
To get inside
If I could only hear you say
That you are down but you're ok
We should have said the things we felt
Is it too late
Trapped beneath the wall of snow
You're only ten
Feet away
Silence has a way of speaking
Only now
Do we understand
If I could only hear you say
That you are down but you're ok
We should have said the things we felt
Is it too late",Avalanche [Album Version] [Version],1971
Leonard Cohen,"I've been listening
To all the dissension
I've been listening
To all the pain

What I do for you
It's going to come back again

But I think that I can heal it
I'm a fool, but I think I can heal it

Leonard Cohen,"It seems so long ago,
Nancy was alone,
Looking ate the late late show
Through a semi-precious stone.
In the house of honesty
Her father was on trial,
In the house of mystery
There was no one at all,
There was no one at all.

It seems so long ago,
None of us were strong;
Nancy wore green stockings
And she slept with everyone.
She never said she'd wait for us
Although she was alone,
I think she fell in love for us
In nineteen sixty one,
In nineteen sixty one.

It seems so long ago,
Nancy was alone,
A forty five beside her head,
An open telephone.
We told her she was beautiful,
We told her she was free
But none of us would meet her in
The house of mystery,
The house of mystery.

And now you look around you,
See her everywhere,
Many use her body,
Many comb her hair.
In the hollow of the night
When you are cold and numb
You hear her talking freely then,
She's happy that you've come,
She's happy that you've come.
",Nancy,1973
Leonard Cohen,"I saw jesus on the cross on a hill called calvary
""do you hate mankind for what they done to you? ""
He said, ""talk of love not hate, things to do - it's getting late.
I've so little time and I'm only passing through.""

Passing through, passing through.
Sometimes happy, sometimes blue,
Glad that I ran into you.
Tell the people that you saw me passing through.

I saw adam leave the garden with an apple in his hand,
I said ""now you're out, what are you going to do? ""
""plant some crops and pray for rain, maybe raise a little cane.
I'm an orphan now, and I'm only passing through.""

Passing through, passing through ...

I was with washington at valley ford, shivering in the snow.
I said, ""how come the men here suffer like they do? ""
""men will suffer, men will fight, even die for what is right
Even though they know they're only passing through""

Passing through, passing through ...

I was with franklin roosevelt's side on the night before he died.
He said, ""one world must come out of world war two"" (ah, the fool)
""yankee, russian, white or tan,"" he said, ""a man is still a man.
We're all on one road, and we're only passing through.""

Leonard Cohen,"I was walking in New York City and I brushed up against the man in front of
me. I felt a cardboard placard on his back. And when we passed a streetlight,
I could read it, it said ""Please don't pass me by - I am blind, but you can
see - I've been blinded totally - Please don't pass me by."" I was walking
along 7th Avenue, when I came to 14th Street I saw on the corner curious
mutilations of the human form; it was a school for handicapped people. And
there were cripples, and people in wheelchairs and crutches and it was snowing,
and I got this sense that the whole city was singing this:
Oh please don't pass me by,
oh please don't pass me by,
for I am blind, but you can see,
yes, I've been blinded totally,
oh please don't pass me by.
And you know as I was walking I thought it was them who were singing it, I
thought it was they who were singing it, I thought it was the other who was
singing it, I thought it was someone else. But as I moved along I knew it was
me, and that I was singing it to myself. It went:
Please don't pass me by,
oh please don't pass me by,
for I am blind, but you can see,
well, I've been blinded totally,
oh please don't pass me by.
Oh please don't pass me by.
Now I know that you're sitting there deep in your velvet seats and you're
thinking ""Uh, he's up there saying something that he thinks about, but I'll
never have to sing that song."" But I promise you friends, that you're going
to be singing this song: it may not be tonight, it may not be tomorrow, but
one day you'll be on your knees and I want you to know the words when the
time comes. Because you're going to have to sing it to yourself, or to another,
or to your brother. You're going to have to learn to sing this song, it goes:
Please don't pass me by,
ah you don't have to sing this .. not for you.
Please don't pass me by,
for I am blind, but you can see,
yes, I've been blinded totally,
oh please don't pass me by.
Well I sing this for the Jews and the Gypsies and the smoke that they made.
And I sing this for the children of England, their faces so grave. And I sing
this for a saviour with no one to save. Hey, won't you be naked for me? Hey,
won't you be naked for me? It goes:
Please don't pass me by,
oh please don't pass me by,
for I am blind, but you can see,
yes, I've been blinded totally,
oh now, please don't pass me by.
Now there's nothing that I tell you that will help you connect the blood
tortured night with the day that comes next. But I want it to hurt you, I
want it to end. Oh, won't you be naked for me? Oh now:
Please don't pass me by,
oh please don't pass me by,
for I am blind, but you can see,
but I've been blinded totally,
oh, please don't pass me by.
Well I sing this song for you Blonde Beasts, I sing this song for you Venuses
upon your shells on the foam of the sea. And I sing this for the freaks and
the cripples, and the hunchback, and the burned, and the burning, and the
maimed, and the broken, and the torn, and all of those that you talk about at
the coffee tables, at the meetings, and the demonstrations, on the streets,
in your music, in my songs. I mean the real ones that are burning, I mean the
real ones that are burning
I say, please don't pass me by,
oh now, please don't pass me by,
for I am blind, yeah but you can see,
ah now, I've been blinded totally,
oh no, please don't pass me by.
I know that you still think that its me. I know that you think that there's
somebody else. I know that these words aren't yours. But I tell you friends
that one day
You're going to get down on your knees,
you're going to get down on your knees,
you're going to get down on your knees,
you're going to get down on your knees,
you're going to get down on your knees,
you're going to get down on your knees,
you're going to get down on your knees,
you're going to get down on your knees,
you're going to get down ..
Oh, please don't pass me by,
oh, please don't pass me by,
for I am blind, yeah but you can see,
yes, I've been blinded totally,
oh, please don't pass me by.
Well you know I have my songs and I have my poems. I have my book and I have
the army, and sometimes I have your applause. I make some money, but you know
what my friends, I'm still out there on the corner. I'm with the freaks, I'm
with the hunted, I'm with the maimed, yes I'm with the torn, I'm with the down,
I'm with the poor. Come on now ...
Ah, please don't pass me by,
well I've got to go now friends,
but, please don't pass me by,
for I am blind, yeah but you can see,
oh, I've been blinded, I've been blinded totally,
oh now, please don't pass me by.
Now I want to take away my dignity, yes take my dignity. My friends, take my
dignity, take my form, take my style, take my honour, take my courage, take
my time, take my time, .. time .. 'Cause you know I'm with you singing this
song. And I wish you would, I wish you would, I wish you would go home with
someone else. Wish you'd go home with someone else. I wish you'd go home with
someone else. Don't be the person that you came with. Oh, don't be the person
that you came with, Oh don't be the person that you came with. Ah, I'm not
going to be. I can't stand him. I can't stand who I am. That's why I've got to
get down on my knees. Because I can't make it by myself. I'm not by myself
anymore because the man I was before he was a tyrant, he was a slave, he was
in chains, he was broken and then he sang:
Oh, please don't pass me by,
oh, please don't pass me by,
for I am blind, yes I am blind, Oh but you can see,
yes, I've been blinded totally,
oh, please don't pass me by.
Well I hope I see you out there on the corner. Yeah I hope as I go by that I
hear you whisper with the breeze. Because I'm going to leave you now, I'm
going to find me someone new. Find someone new.
And please don't pass me by.",Please Don't Pass Me by (A Disgrace),1973
Leonard Cohen,"Queen Victoria,
My father and all his tobacco loved you,
I love you too in all your forms,
The slim and lovely virgin floating among German beer,
The mean governess of the huge pink maps,
The solitary mourner of a prince.

Queen Victoria,
I am cold and rainy,
I am dirty as a glass roof in a train station,
I feel like an empty cast iron exhibition,
I want ornaments on everything,
Because my love, she gone with other boys.

Queen Victoria,
Do you have a punishment under the white lace,
Will you be short with her, will you make her read those little Bibles,
Will you spank her with a mechanical corset.
I want her pure as power, I want her skin slightly musty with petticoats
Will you wash the easy bidet out of her head?

Queen Victoria,
I'm not much nourished by modern love,
Will you come into my life
With your sorrow and your black carriages,
And your perfect
Memories.

Queen Victoria,
The Twentieth Century belongs to you and me.
Let us be two severe giants not less lonely for our partnership,
Who discolor test tubes in the halls of Science,
Who turn up unwelcome at every World's Fair,
Heavy with proverbs and corrections,
Confusing the star-dazed tourists
With our incomparable sense of loss.",Queen Victoria,1973
Leonard Cohen,"I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were talking so brave and so sweet
Giving me head on the unmade bed
While the limousines wait in the street
Those were the reasons and that was New York
We were running for the money and the flesh
And that was called love for the workers in song
Probably still is for those of them left

You got away, I never once heard you say
I need you, I don't need you
I need you, I don't need you

I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were famous, your heart was a legend
You told me again you preferred handsome men
But for me you would make an exception
And clenching your fist for the ones like us
Who are oppressed by the figures of beauty
You fixed yourself, you said, ""Well never mind,
We are ugly but we have the music""

Such as waiting rooms and ticket lines,

The patron Saint of envy and the grocer of despair, 
Working for the Yankee Dollar.

You'd been to the station to meet every train, and
You came home without Lili Marlene

And you treated my woman to a flake of your life
And when she came back she was nobody's wife

Well, I see Jane's awake

I found her there but she was past all concern;
I asked her to hold me, I said, ""Lady, unfold me,""
But she scorned me and she told me
I was dead and I could never return.

Well, I argued all night like so many have before,
Saying, ""Whatever you give me, I seem to need so much more.""
Then she pointed at me where I kneeled on her floor,
She said, ""Don't try to use me or slyly refuse me,
Just win me or lose me,
It is this that the darkness is for.""

I cried, ""Oh, Lady Midnight, I fear that you grow old,

For treating me so well.

And though I wear a uniform I was not born to fight;

Bethlehem the bridegroom,
Babylon the bride.
Great Babylon was naked, oh she stood there trembling for me,
And Bethlehem inflamed us both
Like the shy one at some orgy.
And when we fell together all our flesh was like a veil
That I had to draw aside to see
The serpent eat its tail.

Some women wait for Jesus, and some women wait for Cain
So I hang upon my altar
And I hoist my axe again.
And I take the one who finds me back to where it all began
When Jesus was the honeymoon
And Cain was just the man.
And we read from pleasant Bibles that are bound in blood and skin
That the wilderness is gathering
All its children back again.

An hour has gone by
And he has not moved his hand.
But everything will happen if he only gives the word;
The lovers will rise up
And the mountains touch the ground.

The frontiers are my prison

Oh, the wind, the wind is blowing
Through the graves the wind is blowing
Freedom soon will come
Then we'll come from the shadows

Les Allemands étaient chez moi
Ils me dirent, ""résigne toi""
Mais je n'ai pas peur
J'ai repris mon âme

J'ai changé cent fois de nom
J'ai perdu femme et enfants
Mais j'ai tant d'amis
J'ai la France entière

Un vieil homme dans un grenier
Pour la nuit nous a caché
Les Allemands l'ont pris
Il est mort sans surprise

Oh, the wind, the wind is blowing
Through the graves the wind is blowing
Freedom soon will come
Then we'll come from the shadows",The Partisan,1975
Leonard Cohen,"Oh, the sisters of mercy, they are not departed or gone
They were waiting for me when I thought that I just can't go on
And they brought me their comfort and later they brought me this song
Oh, I hope you run into them, you who've been travelling so long

Yes, you who must leave everything that you cannot control
It begins with your family, but soon it comes around to your soul
Well, I've been where you're hanging, I think I can see how you're pinned
When you're not feeling holy, your loneliness says that you've sinned

Well, they lay down beside me, I made my confession to them
They touched both my eyes and I touched the dew on their hem
If your life is a leaf that the seasons tear off and condemn
They will bind you with love that is graceful and green as a stem

When I left they were sleeping, I hope you run into them soon
Don't turn on the lights, you can read their address by the moon
And you won't make me jealous if I hear that they sweetened your night
We weren't lovers like that and besides, it would still be all right
We weren't lovers like that and besides, it would still be all right",Sisters of Mercy,1975
Leonard Cohen,"Come over to the window, my little darling
I'd like to try to read your palm
I used to think I was some kind of Gypsy boy
Before I let you take me home

Now so long, Marianne
It's time that we began to laugh
And cry and cry and laugh about it all again

Well, you know that I love to live with you
But you make me forget so very much
I forget to pray for the angels
And then the angels forget to pray for us

Now so long, Marianne
It's time that we began to laugh
And cry and cry and laugh about it all again

We met when we were almost young
Deep in the green lilac park
You held on to me like I was a crucifix
As we went kneeling through the dark

Oh, so long, Marianne
It's time that we began to laugh
And cry and cry and laugh about it all again

Your letters, they all say that you're beside me now
Then why do I feel alone?
I'm standing on a ledge and your fine spider web
Is fastening my ankle to a stone

Now so long, Marianne
It's time that we began to laugh
And cry and cry and laugh about it all again

For now I need your hidden love
I'm cold as a new razorblade
You left when I told you I was curious
I never said that I was brave

Oh, so long, Marianne
It's time that we began to laugh
And cry and cry and laugh about it all again

Oh, you are really such a pretty one
I see you've gone and changed your name again
And just when I climbed this whole mountainside
To wash my eyelids in the rain

Oh, so long, Marianne
It's time that we began to laugh
And cry and cry and laugh about it all again","So Long, Marianne",1975
Leonard Cohen,"Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river
You can hear the boats go by, you can spend the night forever
And you know that she's half-crazy but that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges that come all the way from China
And just when you mean to tell her that you have no love to give her
Then he gets you on her wavelength
And she lets the river answer that you've always been her lover

And you want to travel with her, and you want to travel blind
And you know that she will trust you
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind

And Jesus was a sailor when he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time watching from his lonely wooden tower
And when he knew for certain only drowning men could see him
He said all men will be sailors then until the sea shall free them
But he himself was broken, long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human, he sank beneath your wisdom like a stone

And you want to travel with him, and you want to travel blind
And you think you maybe you'll trust him
For he's touched your perfect body with her mind

Now, Suzanne takes your hand and she leads you to the river
She's wearing rags and feathers from Salvation Army counters
And the sun pours down like honey on our lady of the harbor
And she shows you where to look among the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed, there are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love and they wil lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds her mirror

And you want to travel with her, and you want to travel blind
And you know that you can trust her
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind",Suzanne,1975
Leonard Cohen,"Many men have loved the bells
You fastened to the rein
And everyone who wanted you
They found what they will always want again
Your beauty lost to you yourself
Just as it was lost to them

Oh, take this longing from my tongue
Whatever useless things these hands have done
Let me see your beauty broken down
Like you would do for one you love

Your body like a searchlight
My poverty revealed
I would like to try your charity
Until you cry, ""now you must try my greed""
And everything depends upon
How near you sleep to me

Just take this longing from my tongue
All the lonely things my hands have done
Let me see your beauty broken down
Like you would do for one your love

Hungry as an archway
Through which the troops have passed
I stand in ruins behind you
With your winter clothes, your broken sandal straps
I love to see you naked over there
Especially from the back

Oh, take this longing from my tongue
All the useless things my hands have done
Untie for me your hired blue gown
Like you would do for one that you love

You're faithful to the better man
I'm afraid that he left
So let me judge your love affair
In this very room where I have sentenced mine to death
I'll even wear these old laurel leaves
That he's shaken from his head

Just take this longing from my tongue
All the useless things my hands have done
Let me see your beauty broken down
Like you would do for one you love
Like you would do for one you love",Take This Longing,1975
Leonard Cohen,"And who by fire, who by water
Who in the sunshine, who in the night time
Who by high ordeal, who by common trial
Who in your merry-merry month of may
Who by very slow decay
And who shall I say is calling?

And who in her lonely slip, who by barbiturate
Who in these realms of love, who by something blunt
Who by avalanche, who by powder
Who for his greed, who for his hunger
And who shall I say is calling?

And who by brave assent, who by accident
Who in solitude, who in this mirror
Who by his lady's command, who by his own hand
Who in mortal chains, who in power
And who shall I say is calling?",Who by Fire,1975
Leonard Cohen,"Ah the man she wanted all her life was hanging by a thread
""I never even knew how much I wanted you,"" she said.
His muscles they were numbered and his style was obsolete.
""O baby, I have come too late."" She knelt beside his feet.
""I'll never see a face like yours in years of men to come
I'll never see such arms again in wrestling or in love.""
And all his virtues burning in the smoky Holocaust
She took unto herself most everything her lover lost
Now the master of this landscape he was standing at the view
With a sparrow of St. Francis that he was preaching to
She beckoned to the sentry of his high religious mood
She said, ""I'll make a place between my legs,
I'll show you solitude.""

He offered her an orgy in a many mirrored room
He promised her protection for the issue of her womb
She moved her body hard against a sharpened metal spoon
She stopped the bloody rituals of passage to the moon

She took his much admired oriental frame of mind
And the heart-of-darkness alibi his money hides behind
She took his blonde Madonna and his monastery wine 
""This mental space is occupied and everything is mine.""

He tried to make a final stand beside the railway track
She said, ""The art of longing's over and it's never coming back.""
She took his tavern parliament, his cap, his cocky dance,
She mocked his female fashions and his working-class mustache.

The last time that I saw him he was trying hard to get
A woman's education but he's not a woman yet
And the last time that I saw her she was living with some boy
Who gives her soul an empty room and gives her body joy.

So the great affair is over but whoever would have guessed
It would leave us all so vacant and so deeply unimpressed
It's like our visit to the moon or to that other star
I guess you go for nothing if you really want to go that far.

It's like our visit to the moon or to that other star
I guess you go for nothing if you really want to go that far.

Leonard Cohen,"I left a woman waiting
I met her sometime later
She said, I see your eyes are dead
What happened to you, lover?
What happened to you, my lover?
What happened to you, lover?
What happened to you?

And since she spoke the truth to me
I tried to answer truthfully
Whatever happened to my eyes
Happened to your beauty
Happened to your beauty
What happened to your beauty
Happened to me

We took ourselves to someone's bed
And there we fell together
Quick as dogs and truly dead were we
And free as running water
Free as running water
Free as running water
Free as you and me

The way it's got to be, lover",I Left a Woman Waiting,1977
Leonard Cohen,"I needed you, I knew I was in danger
Of losing what I used to think was mine
You let me love you till I was a failure,
You let me love you till I was a failure 
Your beauty on my bruise like iodine
I asked you if a man could be forgiven
And though I failed at love, was this a crime?
You said, Don't worry, don't worry, darling
You said, Don't worry, don't you worry, darling
There are many ways a man can serve his time

You covered up that place I could not master
It wasn't dark enough to shut my eyes
So I was with you, O sweet compassion
Yes I was with you, O sweet compassion
Compassion with the sting of iodine

Your saintly kisses reeked of iodine
Your fragrance with a fume of iodine
And pity in the room like iodine

Your sister fingers burned like iodine
And all my wanton lust was iodine
My masquerade of trust was iodine
And everywhere the flare of iodine",Iodine,1977
Leonard Cohen,"Frankie Lane, he was singing Jezebel
I pinned an Iron Cross to my lapel
I walked up to the tallest and the blondest girl
I said, Look, you don't know me now but very soon you will
So won't you let me see
I said ""won't you let me see""
I said ""won't you let me see
Your naked body?""

Just dance me to the dark side of the gym
Chances are I'll let you do most anything
I know you're hungry, I can hear it in your voice
And there are many parts of me to touch, you have your choice
Ah but no you cannot see
She said ""no you cannot see""
She said ""no you cannot see
My naked body""

So We're dancing close, the band is playing Stardust
Balloons and paper streamers floating down on us
She says, You've got a minute left to fall in love
In solemn moments such as this I have put my trust

I said all my faith to see
I said all my faith to see

Leonard Cohen,"The walls of this hotel are paper-thin 
Last night I heard you making love to him 
The struggle mouth to mouth and limb to limb 
The grunt of unity when he came in 
I stood there with my ear against the wall 
I was not seized by jealousy at all 
In fact a burden lifted from my soul 
I heard that love was out of my control 
A heavy burden lifted from my soul 
I heard that love was out of my control 

I listened to your kisses at the door 
I never heard the world so clear before 
You ran your bath and you began to sing 
I felt so good I couldn't feel a thing 

I stood there with my ear against the wall

And I can't wait to tell you to your face 
And I can't wait for you to take my place 
You are The Naked Angel In My Heart 
You are The Woman With Her Legs Apart

You go to heaven once you've been to hell 

A heavy burden lifted from my soul 
I heard that love was out of my control",Paper Thin Hotel,1977
Leonard Cohen,"As the mist leaves no scar 
On the dark green hill 
So my body leaves no scar 
On you and never will 
Through windows in the dark 
The children come, the children go 
Like arrows with no targets 
Like shackles made of snow 

True love leaves no traces 
If you and I are one 
It's lost in our embraces 
Like stars against the sun 

As a falling leaf may rest 
A moment on the air 
So your head upon my breast 
So my hand upon your hair 

And many nights endure 
Without a moon or star 
So we will endure 
When one is gone and far 

True love leaves no traces 
If you and I are one 
It's lost in our embraces 
Like stars against the sun",True Love Leaves No Traces,1977
Leonard Cohen,"Say a prayer for the cowboy
His mare's run away
And he'll walk til he finds her
His darling, his stray
But the river's in flood
And the roads are awash
And the bridges break up
In the panic of loss.

And there's nothing to follow
There's nowhere to go
She's gone like the summer
Gone like the snow
And the crickets are breaking
His heart with their song
As the day caves in
And the night is all wrong

Did he dream, was it she
Who went galloping past
And bent down the fern
Broke open the grass
And printed the mud with
The iron and the gold
That he nailed to her feet
When he was the lord

And although she goes grazing
A minute away
He tracks her all night
He tracks her all day
Oh blind to her presence
Except to compare
His injury here
With her punishment there

Then at home on a branch
In the highest tree
A songbird sings out
So suddenly
Ah the sun is warm
And the soft winds ride
On the willow trees
By the river side

Oh the world is sweet
The world is wide
And she's there where
The light and the darkness divide
And the steam's coming off her
She's huge and she's shy
And she steps on the moon
When she paws at the sky

And she comes to his hand
But she's not really tame
She longs to be lost
He longs for the same
And she'll bolt and she'll plunge
Through the first open pass
To roll and to feed
In the sweet mountain grass

Or she'll make a break
For the high plateau
Where there's nothing above
And there's nothing below
And it's time for the burden
It's time for the whip
Will she walk through the flame
Can he shoot from the hip

So he binds himself
To the galloping mare
And she binds herself
To the rider there
And there is no space
But there's left and right
And there is no time
But there's day and night

And he leans on her neck
And he whispers low
""Whither thou goest
I will go""
And they turn as one
And they head for the plain
No need for the whip
Ah, no need for the rein

Now the clasp of this union
Who fastens it tight?
Who snaps it asunder
The very next night
Some say the rider
Some say the mare
Or that love's like the smoke
Beyond all repair

But my darling says
""Leonard, just let it go by
That old silhouette
On the great western sky""
So I pick out a tune
And they move right along
And they're gone like the smoke
And they're gone like this song",Ballad of the Absent Mare,1979
Leonard Cohen,"I came so far for beauty
I left so much behind
My patience and my family
My masterpiece unsigned

I thought I'd be rewarded
For such a lonely choice
And surely she would answer
To such a very hopeless voice

I practiced all my sainthood
I gave to one and all
But the rumors of my virtue
They moved her not at all

I changed my style to silver
I changed my clothed to black
And where I would surrender
Now I would attack 

I stormed the old casino
For the money and the flesh 
And I myself decided
What was rotten and what was fresh

And men to do my bidding
And broken bones to teach
The value of my pardon
The shadow of my reach

But no, I could not touch her
With such a heavy hand
Her star beyond my order
Her nakedness unmanned

I came so far for beauty
I left so much behind
My patience and my family

Preserve my room but do not shed a tear
Should rumour of a shabby ending reach you
It was half my fault and half the atmosphere""

Run some wire through that Rose and wind the Swan""

So daily I renew my idle duty
I touch her here and there, I know my place
I kiss her open mouth and I praise her beauty
And people call me traitor to my face",The Traitor,1979
Leonard Cohen,"Why do you stand by the window
Abandoned to beauty and pride
The thorn of the night in your bosom
The spear of the age in your side
Lost in the rages of fragrance
Lost in the rags of remorse
Lost in the waves of a sickness
That loosens the high silver nerves

Oh chosen love, Oh frozen love
Oh tangle of matter and ghost
Oh darling of angels, demons and saints
And the whole broken-hearted host
Gentle this soul

And come forth from the cloud of unknowing
And kiss the cheek of the moon
The New Jerusalem glowing
Why tarry all night in the ruin
And leave no word of discomfort
And leave no observer to mourn
But climb on your tears and be silent
Like a rose on its ladder of thorns

Oh chosen love, Oh frozen love

Then lay your rose on the fire
The fire give up to the sun
The sun give over to splendour
In the arms of the high holy one
For the holy one dreams of a letter
Dreams of a letter's death
Oh bless thee continuous stutter
Of the word being made into flesh

Oh chosen love, Oh frozen love

Gentle this soul",The Window,1979
Leonard Cohen,"One by one, the guests arrive 
The guests are coming through 
The open-hearted many 
The broken-hearted few

And no one knows why the wine is flowing 
Oh love I need you 
I need you 
I need you 
I need you 
Oh I need you now 

And those who dance, begin to dance 
Those who weep begin 
And ""Welcome, welcome"" cries a voice 
""Let all my guests come in."" 

And no one knows where the night is going

And all go stumbling through that house 
in lonely secrecy 
Saying ""Do reveal yourself"" 
or ""Why has thou forsaken me?"" 

And no one knows where the night is going 

All at once the torches flare 
The inner door flies open 
One by one they enter there 
In every style of passion 

And no one knows where the night is going  

And here they take their sweet repast 
While house and grounds dissolve 
And one by one the guests are cast 
Beyond the garden wall 

And no one knows where the night is going  

Those who dance, begin to dance 
Those who weep begin 
Those who earnestly are lost 
Are lost and lost again

Leonard Cohen,"And where, where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight?
I've heard all the wild reports, they can't be right
But whose head is this she's dancing with on the threshing floor?
Whose darkness deepens in her arms just a little more

And where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight?
Where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight?

Ahh, the silver knives are flashing in that tired old cafe
A ghost climbs on the table in bridal negligee
She says, ""My body is the light?, she says, ?My body is the way""
I raise my arm against it all and I catch the bride's bouquet

So where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight?
Where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight?

It's too early for the rainbow, too early for the dove
These are your final days, this is the darkness, this is the flood
And there is no man, there is no woman, can't be touched
But you who come between them, you will surely be judged

So where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight?
Where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight?",The Gypsy's Wife [Album Version] [Version],1979
Leonard Cohen,"Now the Captain called me to his bed 
He fumbled for my hand 
""Take these silver bars,"" he said 
""I'm giving you command."" 
""Command of what, there's no one here 
There's only you and me 
All the rest are dead or in retreat 
Or with the enemy."" 
""Complain, complain, that's all you've done 
Ever since we lost 
If it's not the Crucifixion 
Then it's the Holocaust."" 
""May Christ have mercy on your soul 
For making such a joke 
Amid these hearts that burn like coal 
And the flesh that rose like smoke."" 

""I know that you have suffered, lad, 
But suffer this awhile: 
Whatever makes a soldier sad 
Will make a killer smile."" 
""I'm leaving, Captain, I must go 
There's blood upon your hand 
But tell me, Captain, if you know 
Of a decent place to stand."" 

""There is no decent place to stand 
In a massacre; 
But if a woman take your hand 
Go and stand with her."" 
""I left a wife in Tennessee 
And a baby in Saigon 
I risked my life, but not to hear 
Some country-western song."" 

""Ah but if you cannot raise your love 
To a very high degree, 
Then you're just the man I've been thinking of 
So come and stand with me."" 
""Your standing days are done,"" I cried, 
""You'll rally me no more. 
I don't even know what side 
We fought on, or what for."" 

""I'm on the side that's always lost 
Against the side of Heaven 
I'm on the side of Snake-eyes tossed 
Against the side of Seven. 
And I've read the Bill of Human Rights 
And some of it was true 
But there wasn't any burden left 
So I'm laying it on you."" 

Now the Captain he was dying 
But the Captain wasn't hurt 
The silver bars were in my hand 
I pinned them to my shirt.",The Captain,1984
Leonard Cohen,"Maybe I'm still hurting 
I can't turn the other cheek 
But you know that I still love you 
It's just that I can't speak 
I looked for you in everyone 
And they called me on that too 
I lived alone but I was only 
Coming back to you 

Ah they're shutting down the factory now 
Just when all the bills are due 
And the fields they're under lock and key 
Tho' the rain and the sun come through 
And springtime starts but then it stops 
In the name of something new 
And all the senses rise against this 
Coming back to you 

And they're handing down my sentence now 
And I know what I must do 
Another mile of silence while I'm 
Coming back to you 

There are many in your life 
And many still to be 
Since you are a shining light 
There's many that you'll see 
But I have to deal with envy 
When you choose the precious few 
Who've left their pride on the other side of 
Coming back to you 

Even in your arms I know 
I'll never get it right 
Even when you bend to give me 
Comfort in the night 
I've got to have your word on this 
Or none of it is true 
And all I've said was just instead of 
Coming back to you",Coming Back to You,1984
Leonard Cohen,"Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
Dance me through the panic till I'm gathered safely in
Lift me like an olive branch and be my homeward dove
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love

Oh, let me see your beauty when the witnesses are gone
Let me feel you moving like they do in Babylon
Show me slowly what I only know the limits of
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love

Dance me to the wedding now, dance me on and on
Dance me very tenderly and dance me very long
We're both of us beneath our love, we're both of us above
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love

Dance me to the children who are asking to be born
Dance me through the curtains that our kisses have outworn
Raise a tent of shelter now, though every thread is torn
Dance me to the end of love

Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
Dance me through the panic till I'm gathered safely in
Touch me with your naked hand or touch me with your glove
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love",Dance Me to the End of Love,1984
Leonard Cohen,"Now I greet you from the other side of sorrow and despair, with a love so vast
And so shattered, it will reach you everywhere.

And I sing this for the captain whose ship has not been built, for the mother in
Confusion, her cradle still unfilled.

For the heart with no companion, for the soul without a king. for the prima
Ballerina who cannot dance to anything.

Through the days of shame that are coming, through the nights of wild distress,
Though your promise count for nothing, you must keep it nonetheless.

Leonard Cohen,"Your father's gone a-hunting
He's lost in the forest so wild
And he cannot take his wife with him
He cannot take his child

Your father's gone a-hunting
Through the quicksand and the clay
And a woman cannot follow him
Although she knows the way

Your father's gone a-hunting
Through the silver and the glass
Where only greed can enter
But spirit, spirit cannot pass

Your father's gone a-hunting
For the beast he cannot bind
And he leaves a baby sleeping
And his blessings all behind

Your father's gone a-hunting
And he's lost his lucky charm
And he's lost the guardian heart
That keeps the hunter the harm

Your father's gone a-hunting
He asked me to say goodbye
And he warned me not to stop him
I wouldn't, I wouldn't even try",Hunter's Lullaby,1984

From this broken hill
I will sing to you
From this broken hill
All your praises they shall ring
If it be your will
To let me sing

From this broken hill
All your praises they shall ring
If it be your will
To let me sing

If it be your will
If there is a choice
Let the rivers fill
Let the hills rejoice
Let your mercy spill
On all these burning hearts in hell

And draw us near
And bind us tight

In their rags of light
In our rags of light
All dressed to kill
And end this night

Leonard Cohen,"How many times did you call me
And I knew it was late
I left everybody
But I never went straight
I don't claim to be guilty
But I do understand
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand

Now my heart's like a blister
From doing what I do
If the moon has a sister
It's got to be you
I'm going to miss you forever
Tho' it's not what I planned
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand

Now the deal has been dirty
Since dirty began
I'm not asking for mercy
Not from the man
You just don't ask for mercy
While you're still on the stand
There s a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand

I don't claim to be guilty
Guilty's too grand
There s a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand

That's all I can say, baby
That's all I can say
It wasn't for nothing
They put me away
I fell with my angel
Down the chain of command
There s a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand",The Law,1984
Leonard Cohen,"I went down to the place where I knew she lay waiting
Under the marble and the snow
I said, Mother I'm frightened, the thunder and the lightning
I'll never come through this alone
She said, I'll be with you, my shawl wrapped around you
My hand on your head when you go
And the night came on, it was very calm

I wanted the night to go on and on
But she said, go back, go back to the world
We were fighting in Egypt when they signed this agreement
That nobody else had to die
There was this terrible sound, my father went down
With a terrible wound in his side
He said, try to go on, take my books, take my gun
Remember, my son, how they lied
And the night comes on, it's very calm
I'd like to pretend that my father was wrong
But you don't want to lie, not to the young

We were locked in this kitchen, I took to religion
And I wondered how long she would stay
I needed so much to have nothing to touch
I've always been greedy that way
But my son and my daughter climbed out of the water
Crying, Papa, you promised to play
And they lead me away to the great surprise
It's Papa, don't peek, Papa, cover your eyes
And they hide, they hide in the world

Now I look for her always, I'm lost in this calling
I'm tied to the threads of some prayer
Saying when will she summon me, when will she come to me
What must I do to prepare?
When she bends to my longing like a willow, like a fountain
She stands in the luminous air
And the night comes on, it's very calm
I lie in her arms and says when I'm gone
I'll be yours, yours for a song

Now the crickets are singing, the vesper bells ringing
The cat's curled asleep in his chair
I'll go down to Bill's Bar, I can make it that far
And I'll see if my friends are still there
Yes, and here's to the few, who forgive what you do
And the fewer who don't even care
And the night comes on, it's very calm
I want to cross over, I want to go home
But she says, Go back, go back to the world",Night Comes On,1984
Leonard Cohen,"I loved you for a long, long time
I know this love is real
It don't matter how it all went wrong
That don't change the way I feel
And I can't believe that time is
Gonna heal this wound I'm speaking of
There ain't no cure, there ain't no cure, there ain't no cure for love

I'm aching for you baby
I can't pretend I'm not
I need to see you naked
In your body and your thought
I've got you like a habit
And I'll never get enough
There ain't no cure, there ain't no cure, there ain't no cure for love

(There ain't no cure for love)
(There ain't no cure for love)
All the rocket ships are climbing through the sky
The holy books are open wide
The doctors working day and night
But they'll never ever find that cure for love
(There ain't no drink, no drug) ah, tell them, angels
(There's nothing pure enough to be a cure for love)

I see you in the subway and I see you on the bus
I see you lying down with me, I see you waking up
I see your hand, I see your hair
Your bracelets and your brush
And I call to you, I call to you
But I don't call soft enough
There ain't no cure, there ain't no cure, there ain't no cure for love

I walked into this empty church, I had no place else to go
When the sweetest voice I ever heard whispered to my soul
I don't need to be forgiven for loving you so much
It's written in the scriptures
It's written there in blood
And I even heard the angels declare it from above
There ain't no cure, there ain't no cure, there ain't no cure for love

(There ain't no cure for love)
(There ain't no cure for love)
All the rocket ships are climbing through the sky

There's a shoulder where Death comes to cry
There's a lobby with nine hundred windows
There's a tree where the doves go to die
There's a piece that was torn from the morning
And it hangs in the Gallery of Frost

I, I-I-I
Take this waltz, take this waltz
Take this waltz with the clamp on its jaws

Oh, I want you, I want you, I want you
On a chair with a dead magazine
In the cave at the tip of the lilly
In some hallway where love's never been
On a bed where the moon has been sweating
In a cry filled with footsteps and sand

I, I-I-I
Take this waltz, take this waltz
Take its broken waist in your hand

This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz
With its very own breath of brandy and Death
Dragging its tail in the sea

There's a concert hall in Vienna
Where your mouth had a thousand reviews
There's a bar where the boys have stopped talking
They've been sentenced to death by the blues
Ah, but who is it climbs to your picture
With a garland of freshly cut tears?

I, I-I-I
Take this waltz, take this waltz
Take this waltz, it's been dying for years

There's an attic where children are playing
Where I've got to lie down with you soon
In a dream of Hungarian lanterns
In the mist of some sweet afternoon
And I'll see what you've chained to your sorrow
All your sheep and your lillies of snow

I, I-I-I
Take this waltz, take this waltz
With its ""I'll never forget you, you know!""

This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz
With its very own breath of brandy and Death
Dragging its tail in the sea

And I'll dance with you in Vienna
I'll be wearing a river's disguise
The hyacinth wild on my shoulder
My mouth on the dew of your thighs
And I'll bury my soul in a scrapbook
With the photographs there, and the moss
And I'll yield to the flood of your beauty
My cheap violin and my cross
And you'll carry me down on your dancing
To the pools that you lift on your wrist

I ache in the places where I used to play
And I'm crazy for love but I'm not coming on
I'm just paying my rent every day in the Tower of Song

I said to Hank Williams, how lonely does it get?
Hank Williams hasn't answered yet
But I hear him coughing all night long
Oh, a hundred floors above me in the Tower of Song

I was born like this, I had no choice
I was born with the gift of a golden voice
And twenty-seven angels from the Great Beyond
They tied me to this table right here in the Tower of Song

So you can stick your little pins in that voodoo doll
I'm very sorry, baby, doesn't look like me at all
I'm standing by the window where the light is strong
Ah, they don't let a woman kill you, not in the Tower of Song

Now, you can say that I've grown bitter but of this you may be sure
The rich have got their channels in the bedrooms of the poor
And there's a mighty judgment coming, but I may be wrong
You see, you hear these funny voices in the Tower of Song

I see you standing on the other side
I don't know how the river got so wide
I loved you baby, way back when
And all the bridges are burning that we might have crossed
But I feel so close to everything that we lost
We'll never, we'll never have to lose it again

Now I bid you farewell, I don't know when I'll be back
They're moving us tomorrow to that tower down the track
But you'll be hearing from me baby, long after I'm gone
I'll be speaking to you sweetly from a window in the Tower of Song

The god of love preparing to depart
Alexandra hoisted on his shoulder,
They slip between the sentries of the heart

Upheld by the simplicities of pleasure
They gain the light, they formlessly entwine
And radiant beyond your widest measure
They fall among the voices and the wine

It's not a trick, your senses all deceiving
A fitful dream, the morning will exhaust
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost

Even though she sleeps upon your satin
Even though she wakes you with a kiss
Do not say the moment was imagined
Do not stoop to strategies like this

As someone long prepared for this to happen
Go firmly to the window, drink it in
Exquisite music Alexandra laughing
Your first commitments tangible again

And you who had the honor of her evening,
And by the honor had your own restored
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Alexandra leaving with her Lord

Even though she sleeps upon your satin
Even though she wakes you with a kiss
Do not say the moment was imagined
Do not stoop to strategies like this

As someone long prepared for the occasion
In full command of every plan you wrecked
Do not choose a coward's explanation
that hides behind the cause and the effect

And you who were bewildered by a meaning
Whose code was broken, crucifix uncrossed
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost

Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost",Take This Waltz [Album Version] [Version],1988
Leonard Cohen,"Well my friends are gone and my hair is grey
I ache in the places where I used to play
And I'm crazy for love but I'm not coming on
I'm just paying my rent every day
Oh in the Tower of Song
I said to Hank Williams: how lonely does it get?
Hank Williams hasn't answered yet
But I hear him coughing all night long
A hundred floors above me
In the Tower of Song

I was born like this, I had no choice
I was born with the gift of a golden voice
And twenty-seven angels from the Great Beyond
They tied me to this table right here
In the Tower of Song

So you can stick your little pins in that voodoo doll
I'm very sorry, baby, doesn't look like me at all
I'm standing by the window where the light is strong
Ah they don't let a woman kill you
Not in the Tower of Song

Now you can say that I've grown bitter but of this you may be sure
The rich have got their channels in the bedrooms of the poor
And there's a mighty judgment coming, but I may be wrong
You see, you hear these funny voices
In the Tower of Song

I see you standing on the other side
I don't know how the river got so wide
I loved you baby, way back when
And all the bridges are burning that we might have crossed
But I feel so close to everything that we lost
We'll never have to lose it again

Now I bid you farewell, I don't know when I'll be back
There moving us tomorrow to that tower down the track
But you'll be hearing from me baby, long after I'm gone
I'll be speaking to you sweetly
From a window in the Tower of Song

Yeah my friends are gone and my hair is gray
I ache in the places where I used to play
And I'm crazy for love but I'm not coming on
I'm just paying my rent every day

Leonard Cohen,"The birds they sang at the break of day
""Start again"", I heard them say
Don't dwell on what has passed away
Or what is yet to be

Ah, the wars they will be fought again
The holy dove, she will be caught again
Bought and sold and bought again
The dove is never free

Ring the bells that still can ring
Forget your perfect offering
There is a crack, a crack in everything
That's how the light gets in

We asked for signs, the signs were sent
The birth betrayed, the marriage spent
Yeah, the widowhood of every government
Signs for all to see

I can't run no more with that lawless crowd
While the killers in high places say their prayers out loud
But they've summoned, they've summoned up a thundercloud
And they're going to hear from me

Ring the bells that still can ring
Forget your perfect offering
There is a crack, a crack in everything
That's how the light gets in

You can add up the parts, you won't have the sum
You can strike up the march, there is no drum
Every heart, every heart to love will come

Leonard Cohen,"It's coming through a hole in the air,
from those nights in Tiananmen Square
It's coming from the feel
that this ain't exactly real,
or it's real, but it ain't exactly there
From the wars against disorder,
from the sirens night and day,
from the fires of the homeless,
from the ashes of the gay:
Democracy is coming to the USA
It's coming through a crack in the wall;
on a visionary flood of alcohol;
from the staggering account
of the Sermon on the Mount
which I don't pretend to understand at all
It's coming from the silence
on the dock of the bay,
from the brave, the bold, the battered
heart of Chevrolet:
Democracy is coming to the USA

It's coming from the sorrow in the street,
the holy places where the races meet;
from the homicidal bitchin'
that goes down in every kitchen
to determine who will serve and who will eat
From the wells of disappointment
where the women kneel to pray
for the grace of God in the desert here
and the desert far away:
Democracy is coming to the USA

Sail on, sail on
O mighty Ship of State!
To the Shores of Need
Past the Reefs of Greed
Through the Squalls of Hate
Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on

It's coming to America first,
the cradle of the best and of the worst
It's here they got the range
and the machinery for change
and it's here they got the spiritual thirst
It's here the family's broken
and it's here the lonely say
that the heart has got to open
in a fundamental way:
Democracy is coming to the USA

It's coming from the women and the men
O baby, we'll be making love again
We'll be going down so deep
the river's going to weep,
and the mountain's going to shout Amen!
It's coming like the tidal flood
beneath the lunar sway,
imperial, mysterious,
in amorous array:
Democracy is coming to the USA

Sail on, sail on 

I'm sentimental, if you know what I mean
I love the country but I can't stand the scene
And I'm neither left or right
I'm just staying home tonight,
getting lost in that hopeless little screen
But I'm stubborn as those garbage bags
that Time cannot decay,
I'm junk but I'm still holding up
this little wild bouquet:
Democracy is coming to the USA",Democracy [Album Version] [Version],1992
Leonard Cohen,"Give me back my broken night
My mirrored room, my secret life
It's lonely here
There's no one left to torture

Give me absolute control
Over every living soul
And lie beside me, baby
That's an order

Give me crack and anal sex
Take the only tree that's left
And stuff it up the hole
In your culture

Give me back the Berlin wall
Give me Stalin and St. Paul

You never will, you never did
I'm the little Jew
Who wrote the Bible

I've seen the nations rise and fall
I've heard their stories, heard them all
But love's the only engine of survival

Your servant here, he has been told
To say it clear, to say it cold
It's over, it ain't going
Any further

And now the wheels of heaven stop
You feel the devil's riding crop
Get ready for the future

I wonder what they meant

There'll be the breaking of the ancient western code
Your private life will suddenly explode
There'll be phantoms
There'll be fires on the road
And the white man dancing

You'll see a woman hanging upside down
Her features covered by her fallen gown
And all the lousy little poets coming round
Tryin' to sound like Charlie Manson
And the white man dancin'

Give me back the Berlin wall
Give me Stalin and St. Paul
Give me Christ
Or give me Hiroshima

Destroy another fetus now
We don't like children anyhow

Leonard Cohen,"She stands before you naked
You can see it, you can taste it,
And she comes to you light as the breeze.
Now you can drink it or you can nurse it,
It don't matter how you worship
As long as you're
Down on your knees.
So I knelt there at the delta,
At the alpha and the omega,
At the cradle of the river and the seas.
And like a blessing come from heaven
For something like a second
I was healed and my heart
Was at ease.

O baby I waited
So long for your kiss
For something to happen,
Oh something like this.

And you're weak and you're harmless
And you're sleeping in your harness
And the wind going wild
In the trees,
And it ain't exactly prison
But you'll never be forgiven
For whatever you've done
With the keys.

O baby I waited 

It's dark now and it's snowing
O my love I must be going,
The river has started to freeze.
And I'm sick of pretending
I'm broken from bending
I've lived too long on my knees.

Then she dances so graceful
And your heart's hard and hateful
And she's naked
But that's just a tease.
And you turn in disgust
From your hatred and from your love
And comes to you
Light as the breeze.

O baby I waited

There's blood on every bracelet
You can see it, you can taste it,
And it's please baby
Please baby please.
And she says, drink deeply, pilgrim
But don't forget there's still a woman
Beneath this
Resplendent chemise.

So I knelt there at the delta,
At the alpha and the omega,
I knelt there like one who believes.
And the blessings come from heaven
And for something like a second
I'm cured and my heart

Leonard Cohen,"The woman in blue, she's asking for revenge
The man in white -- that's you -- says he has no friends

And the trees are burning in your promised land
And there are no letters in the mailbox
And there are no grapes upon the vine
And there are no chocolates in the boxes anymore
And there are no diamonds in the mine

Well, you tell me that your lover has a broken limb
You say you're kind of restless now and it's on account of him
Well, I saw the man in question, it was just the other night
He was eating up a lady where the lions and Christians fight

And there are no letters in the mailbox 
And there are no grapes upon the vine
And there are no chocolates in the boxes anymore
And there are no diamonds in the mine 

(You tell them now) 

Ah, there is no comfort in the covens of the witch
Some very clever doctor went and sterilized the bitch
And the only man of energy, yes the revolution's pride
He trained a hundred women just to kill an unborn child

Oh no, there are no, no grapes upon your vine 

And there are, there are no chocolates in your boxes anymore

Lover, lover, lover, lover

I want a spirit that is calm""

Leonard Cohen,"I lit a thin green candle to make you jealous of me,
But the room just filled up with mosquitoes, they heard that my body was free
Then I took the dust of a long sleepless night and I put it in your little shoe 
And then I confess that I tortured the dress that you wore for the world to look through

I showed my heart to the doctor. He said I'd just have to quit
Then he wrote himself a prescription, your name was mentioned in it 
Then he locked himself in a library shelf with the details of our honeymoon
And I hear from the nurse that he's gotten much worse and his practice is all in a ruin

I heard of a saint who had loved you, I studied all night in his school 
He taught that the duty of lovers is to tarnish the golden rule 
And just when I was sure that his teachings were pure he drowned himself in the pool
His body is gone but back here on the lawn his spirit continues to drool

An Eskimo showed me a movie he'd recently taken of you 
The poor man could hardly stop shivering, his lips and his fingers were blue
I suppose that he froze when the wind tore off your clothes 
And I guess he just never got warm, but you stand there so nice in your blizzard of ice 
Oh please let me come into the storm",One of Us Cannot Be Wrong,1993

Why don't you come on back to the war, it's just beginning. 

Well I live here with a woman and a child, 
The situation makes me kind of nervous. 
Yes, I rise up from her arms, she says ""I guess you call this love"" 
I call it service. 

Why don't you come on back to the war, don't be a tourist, 
Why don't you come on back to the war, before it hurts us, 
Why don't you come on back to the war, let's all get nervous. 

You cannot stand what I've become, 
You much prefer the gentleman I was before. 
I was so easy to defeat, I was so easy to control, 
I didn't even know there was a war. 

Why don't you come on back to the war, don't be embarrassed, 
Why don't you come on back to the war, you can still get married. 

There is a war between the rich and poor, 
A war between the man and the woman. 
There is a war between the left and right, 
A war between the black and white, 
A war between the odd and the even.

We swore to each other then that our love would surely last.

And I know from your smile
That tonight will be fine,
Will be fine, will be fine, will be fine

I choose the rooms that I live in with care,
The windows are small and the walls almost bare,
There's only one bed and there's only one prayer;
I listen all night for your step on the stair.
But I know from your eyes
And I know from your smile
That tonight will be fine,
Will be fine, will be fine, will be fine
For a while.

Oh sometimes I see her undressing for me,
She's the soft naked lady love meant her to be
And she's moving her body so brave and so free.

And I know from her smile

Leonard Cohen,"Now the flames they followed joan of arc
As she came riding through the dark;
No moon to keep her armour bright,
No man to get her through this very smoky night.
She said, I'm tired of the war,
I want the kind of work I had before,
A wedding dress or something white
To wear upon my swollen appetite.

Well, I'm glad to hear you talk this way,
You know I've watched you riding every day
And something in me yearns to win
Such a cold and lonesome heroine.
And who are you? she sternly spoke
To the one beneath the smoke.
Why, I'm fire, he replied,
And I love your solitude, I love your pride.

Then fire, make your body cold,
I'm going to give you mine to hold,
Saying this she climbed inside
To be his one, to be his only bride.
And deep into his fiery heart
He took the dust of joan of arc,
And high above the wedding guests
He hung the ashes of her wedding dress.

It was deep into his fiery heart
He took the dust of joan of arc,
And then she clearly understood
If he was fire, oh then she must be wood.

I saw the glory in her eye.

It's closing time

Yeah we're drinking and we're dancing
But there's nothing really happening
And the place is dead as heaven on a Saturday night
And my very close companion
Gets me fumbling gets me laughing
She's a hundred but she's wearing
Something tight
And I lift my glass to the awful truth
Which you can't reveal to the ears of youth
Except to say it isn't worth a dime
And the whole damn place goes crazy twice
And it's once for the devil and once for Christ
But the boss don't like these dizzy heights
We're busted in the blinding lights
Of closing time
(Closing time)
(Closing time)
(Closing time)

The whole damn place goes crazy twice
And it's once for the devil and once for Christ
But the boss don't like these dizzy heights
We're busted in the blinding lights
(Busted in the blinding lights)
Busted in the blinding lights
Of closing time
Closing time

Oh the women tear their blouses off
And the men they dance on the polka-dots
It's closing time
And it's partner found, it's partner lost
And it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops
It's closing time
I swear it happened just like this
A sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss
It's closing time (closing time)
(Closing time)
(Closing time)
(Closing time)

The gates of love they budged an inch
I can't say much has happened since
But closing time (closing time, closing time, closing time)

I loved you when our love was blessed
I love you now there's nothing left
But closing time
I miss you since the place got wrecked
By the winds of change and the weeds of sex",Closing Time,1997
Leonard Cohen,"Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
Dance me through the panic 'til I'm gathered safely in
Lift me like an olive branch and be my homeward dove

Let me feel you moving like they do in Babylon
Show me slowly what I only know the limits of
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love

My mirrored room, my secret life
It's lonely here,
There's no one left to torture
Give me absolute control
Over every living soul
And lie beside me, baby

Give me crack and anal sex
Take the only tree that's left
And stuff it up the hole
In your culture

Give me Stalin and St. Paul

You don't know me from the wind
You never will, you never did
I'm the little Jew
Who wrote the Bible
I've seen the nations rise and fall
I've heard their stories, heard them all
But love's the only engine of survival
Your servant here, he has been told
To say it clear, to say it cold
It's over, it ain't going
Any further
And now the wheels of heaven stop
You feel the devil's riding crop
Get ready for the future
It is murder

There'll be the breaking of the ancient
Western code
Your private life will suddenly explode
There'll be phantoms
There'll be fires on the road
And the white man dancing
You'll see a woman
Hanging upside down
Her features covered by her fallen gown
And all the lousy little poets
Coming round
Tryin' to sound like Charlie Manson
And the white man dancin'

Give me back the Berlin wall
Give me Stalin and St. Paul
Give me Christ or give me Hiroshima
Destroy another fetus now
We don't like children anyhow

Leonard Cohen,"It`s going to happen very soon. 
The great event which will end the horror. 
Which will end the sorrow. 
Next Tuesday, when the sun goes down,
I will play the Moonlight Sonata backwards. 

This will reverse the effects of the world`s mad plunge into suffering, 
For the last 200 million years. 
What a lovely night that would be. 
What a sigh of relief, as the senile robins become bright red again, 

And the retired nightingales, 
Pick up their dusty tails, 
And assert the majesty of creation!",The Great Event [#],1997

Leonard Cohen,"Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river
You can hear the boats go by, you can spend the night forever
And you know that she's half-crazy but that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges that come all the way from China
And just when you mean to tell her that you have no love to give her
Then he gets you on her wavelength
And she lets the river answer that you've always been her lover

And you want to travel with her, and you want to travel blind
And you know that she will trust you
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind

And Jesus was a sailor when he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time watching from his lonely wooden tower
And when he knew for certain only drowning men could see him
He said all men will be sailors then until the sea shall free them
But he himself was broken, long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human, he sank beneath your wisdom like a stone

And you want to travel with him, and you want to travel blind
And you think you maybe you'll trust him
For he's touched your perfect body with her mind

Now, Suzanne takes your hand and she leads you to the river
She's wearing rags and feathers from Salvation Army counters
And the sun pours down like honey on our lady of the harbor
And she shows you where to look among the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed, there are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love and they wil lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds her mirror

And you want to travel with her, and you want to travel blind
And you know that you can trust her
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind",Suzanne [Live],1997
Leonard Cohen,"Baby, I've been waiting,
I've been waiting night and day
I didn't see the time,
I waited half my life away
There were lots of invitations
And I know you sent me some
But I was waiting
For the miracle, for the miracle to come
I know you really loved me
But, you see, my hands were tied
And I know it must have hurt you,
It must have hurt your pride
To have to stand beneath my window
With your bugle and your drum
And me I'm up there waiting
For the miracle, for the miracle to come

Ah I don't believe you'd like it,
You wouldn't like it here
There ain't no entertainment
And the judgments are severe
The Maestro says it's Mozart
But it sounds like bubble gum
When you're waiting
For the miracle, for the miracle to come

Waiting for the miracle
There's nothing left to do
I haven't been this happy
Since the end of World War II

Nothing left to do
When you know that you've been taken
Nothing left to do
When you're begging for a crumb
Nothing left to do
When you've got to go on waiting
Waiting for the miracle to come

I dreamed about you, baby
It was just the other night
Most of you was naked
Ah but some of you was light
The sands of time were falling
From your fingers and your thumb
And you were waiting
For the miracle, for the miracle to come

Ah baby, let's get married
We've been alone too long
Let's be alone together
Let's see if we're that strong
Yeah let's do something crazy,
Something absolutely wrong
While we're waiting
For the miracle, for the miracle to come

Nothing left to do
When you know that you've been taken
Nothing left to do
When you're begging for a crumb
Nothing left to do
When you've got to go on waiting
Waiting for the miracle to come

When you've fallen on the highway
And you're lying in the rain,
And they ask you how you're doing
Of course you'll say you can't complain
If you're squeezed for information,
That's when you've got to play it dumb
You just say you're out there waiting
For the miracle, for the miracle to come",Waiting for the Miracle,1997

Like a worm on a hook
Like a knight from some old fashioned book
I have saved all my ribbons for thee

I hope that you can just let it go by
If I, if I have been untrue
I hope you know it was never to you

Like a baby, stillborn
Like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out for me
But I swear by this song
And by all that I have done wrong
I will make it all up to thee

He said to me, you must not ask for so much

Upheld by the simplicities of pleasure
They gain the light, they formlessly entwine
And radiant beyond your widest measure
They fall among the voices and the wine

It's not a trick, your senses all deceiving
A fitful dream, the morning will exhaust
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost

Even though she sleeps upon your satin
Even though she wakes you with a kiss
Do not say the moment was imagined
Do not stoop to strategies like this

As someone long prepared for this to happen
Go firmly to the window, drink it in
Exquisite music Alexandra laughing
Your first commitments tangible again

And you who had the honor of her evening,
And by the honor had your own restored
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Alexandra leaving with her Lord

Even though she sleeps upon your satin
Even though she wakes you with a kiss
Do not say the moment was imagined
Do not stoop to strategies like this

As someone long prepared for the occasion
In full command of every plan you wrecked
Do not choose a coward's explanation
that hides behind the cause and the effect

And you who were bewildered by a meaning
Whose code was broken, crucifix uncrossed
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost

Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost",Alexandra Leaving,2001

Who was waiting there
Who was hunting me.

And he cut my heart.
So I could not drink
From the river dark.

My lawless heart
And my wedding ring,

And I could not see
Who was waiting there,
Who was hunting me.

With a deadly force,

It is not yours.'

From a withered limb,
Both song and tree,
They sing for him.

Straight from the sun above

There plunged the rays of love

In streams of light I clearly saw
The dust you seldom see,
Out of which the nameless makes
A name for one like me

I'll try to say a little more
Love went on and on
Until it reached an open door
Then love itself
Love itself was gone

All busy in the sunlight
The flecks did float and dance
And I was tumbled up with them
In formless circumstance

Love went on and on
Until it reached an open door
Then love itself
Love itself was gone

Then I came back from where I'd been
My room, it looked the same
But there was nothing left between
The nameless and the name

All busy in the sunlight
The flecks did float and dance
And I was tumbled up with them
In formless circumstance

I'll try to say a little more
Love went on and on
Until it reached an open door
Then love itself
Love itself was gone
Love itself
Love itself was gone",Love Itself,2001

How come you bother

I lost my job forever.

That I am not the one who loves

You forbid delivery.

Rises from the hunger,

I'll do anything you ask me to
And if you want another kind of love,
I'll wear a mask for you
If you want a partner, take my hand
Or if you want to strike me down in anger,
Here I stand
I'm your man

If you want a boxer,
I will step into the ring for you
And if you want a doctor,
I'll examine every inch of you
If you want a driver, climb inside
Or if you want to take me for a ride,
You know you can

Ah, the moon's too bright
The chain's too tight
The beast won't go to sleep
I've been running through these promises to you
That I made and I could not keep
But a man never got a woman back,
Not by begging on his knees
Or I'd crawl to you baby
And I'd fall at your feet
And I'd howl at your beauty
Like a dog in heat
And I'd claw at your heart
And I'd tear at your sheet
I'd say please, please
I'm your man

And if you've got to sleep
A moment on the road,
I will steer for you
And if you want to work the street alone,
I'll disappear for you
If you want a father for your child,
Or only want to walk with me a while
Across the sand

From those nights in Tiananmen Square
It's coming from the feel
That this ain't exactly real
Or it's real, but it ain't exactly there
From the wars against disorder
From the sirens night and day
From the fires of the homeless
From the ashes of the gay
Democracy is coming to the USA
It's coming through a crack in the wall
On a visionary flood of alcohol
From the staggering account
Of the Sermon on the Mount
Which I don't pretend to understand at all
It's coming from the silence
On the dock of the bay,
From the brave, the bold, the battered
Heart of Chevrolet
Democracy is coming to the USA

It's coming from the sorrow in the street
The holy places where the races meet
From the homicidal bitchin'
That goes down in every kitchen
To determine who will serve and who will eat
From the wells of disappointment
Where the women kneel to pray
For the grace of God in the desert here
And the desert far away:
Democracy is coming to the USA

Sail on, sail on
Oh mighty ship of State
To the shores of need
Past the reefs of greed
Through the Squalls of hate
Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on

It's coming to America first
The cradle of the best and of the worst
It's here they got the range
And the machinery for change
And it's here they got the spiritual thirst
It's here the family's broken
And it's here the lonely say
That the heart has got to open
In a fundamental way
Democracy is coming to the USA

It's coming from the women and the men
Oh baby, we'll be making love again
We'll be going down so deep
The river's going to weep,
And the mountain's going to shout Amen
It's coming like the tidal flood
Beneath the lunar sway
Imperial, mysterious
In amorous array
Democracy is coming to the USA

Sail on, sail on
O mighty ship of State
To the shores of need
Past the reefs of greed
Through the squalls of hate
Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on

I'm sentimental, if you know what I mean
I love the country but I can't stand the scene
And I'm neither left or right

But I'm stubborn as those garbage bags
As time cannot decay
I'm junk but I'm still holding up this little wild bouquet

For scavengers like me
I made it to the forward deck
I blessed our remnant fleet
And then consented to be wrecked

That you were meant to keep
And quiet is the thought of you

You were talking so brave and so sweet,
Giving me head on the unmade bed,

We were running for the money and the flesh.
And that was called love for the workers in song
Probably still is for those of them left.

Ah but you got away, didn't you babe,
You just turned your back on the crowd,
You got away, I never once heard you say,
I need you, I don't need you,
I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jiving around.

I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were famous, your heart was a legend.
You told me again you preferred handsome men
But for me you would make an exception.
And clenching your fist for the ones like us
Who are oppressed by the figures of beauty,
You fixed yourself, you said, ""Well never mind,
We are ugly but we have the music.""

Hurt once and for all into silence.
A long pain ending without a song to prove it.
Who could stand beside you so close to Eden,
When you glinted in every eye the held-high
Razor, shivering every ram and son?
And now the silent loony bin, where
The shadows live in the rafters like
Day-weary bats,
Until the turning mind, a radar signal,
Lures them to exaggerate
Mountain-size on the white stone wall
Your tiny limp.
How can I leave you in such a house?
Are there no more saints and wizards
To praise their ways with pupils,
No more evil to stun with the slap
Of a wet red tongue?
Did you confuse the Messiah in a mirror
And rest because he had finally come?
Let me cry Help beside you, Teacher.
I have entered under this dark roof
As fearlessly as an honoured son
Enters his father's house.
",To a Teacher,2004
Leonard Cohen,"I set out one night
When the tide was low
There were signs in the sky
But I did not know
I'd be caught in the grip
Of the undertow

Where the sea hates to go
With a child in my arms
And a chill in my soul
And my heart the shape
Of a begging bowl
",Undertow,2004
Leonard Cohen,"From bitter searching of the heart,
Quickened with passion and with pain
We rise to play a greater part.
This is the faith from which we start:
Men shall know commonwealth again
From bitter searching of the heart.
We loved the easy and the smart,
But now, with keener hand and brain,
We rise to play a greater part.
The lesser loyalties depart,
And neither race nor creed remain
From bitter searching of the heart.
Not steering by the venal chart
That tricked the mass for private gain,
We rise to play a greater part.
Reshaping narrow law and art
Whose symbols are the millions slain,
From bitter searching of the heart
We rise to play a greater part.

Safaris to the heart of all that jazz
Through I bars and girders-through wires and pipes
The mathematic circuits of the modern nights
Through huts, through Harlem, through jails and gospel pews
Through the class on Park and the trash on Vine
Through Europe and the deep deep heart of Dixie blue
Through savage progress cuts the jungle line

In a low-cut blouse she brings the beer
Rousseau paints a jungle flower behind her ear
Those cannibals-of shuck and jive
They'll eat a working girl like her alive
With his hard-edged eye and his steady hand
He paints the cellar full of ferns and orchid vines
And he hangs a moon above a five-piece band
He hangs it up above the jungle line

The jungle line, the jungle line
Screaming in a ritual of sound and time
Floating, drifting on the air-conditioned wind
And drooling for a taste of something smuggled in
Pretty women funneled through valves and smoke
Coy and bitchy, wild and fine
And charging elephants and chanting slaving boats
Charging, chanting down the jungle line

There's a poppy wreath on a soldier's tomb
There's a poppy snake in a dressing room
Poppy poison-poppy tourniquet

And metal skin and ivory birds

There was no one at all
There was no one at all

It seems so long ago
None of us were strong
Nancy wore green stockings
And she slept with everyone

She never said she'd wait for us
Although she was alone
I think she fell in love for us
In nineteen sixty one
In nineteen sixty one

It seems so long ago
Nancy was alone
A forty five beside her head
An open telephone

We told her she was beautiful
We told her she was free
But none of us would meet her in
The house of mystery
The house of mystery

And now you look around you
See her everywhere
Many use her body
Many comb her hair

In the hollow of the night
When you are cold and numb
You hear her talking freely then
She's happy that you've come
She's happy that you've come",Seems So Long Ago Nancy,2009
Leonard Cohen,"I loved you in the morning, our kisses deep and warm
Your hair upon the pillow like a sleepy golden storm
Yes, many loved before us, I know that we are not new
In city and in forest, they smiled like me and you
But now it's come to distances and both of us must try

Your eyes are soft with sorrow
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye

I'm not looking for another as I wander in my time
Walk me to the corner, our steps will always rhyme
You know my love goes with you as your love stays with me
It's just the way it changes like the shoreline and the sea
But let's not talk of love or chains and things we can't untie

Your eyes are soft with sorrow
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye

I'd like to try to read your palm
I used to think I was some kind of Gypsy boy
Before I let you take me home

Now so long, Marianne
It's time that we began to laugh
And cry and cry and laugh about it all again

Well, you know that I love to live with you
But you make me forget so very much
I forget to pray for the angels
And then the angels forget to pray for us

Now so long, Marianne
It's time that we began to laugh
And cry and cry and laugh about it all again

We met when we were almost young
Deep in the green lilac park
You held on to me like I was a crucifix
As we went kneeling through the dark

Oh, so long, Marianne
It's time that we began to laugh
And cry and cry and laugh about it all again

Your letters, they all say that you're beside me now
Then why do I feel alone?
I'm standing on a ledge and your fine spider web
Is fastening my ankle to a stone

Now so long, Marianne
It's time that we began to laugh
And cry and cry and laugh about it all again

For now I need your hidden love
I'm cold as a new razorblade
You left when I told you I was curious
I never said that I was brave

Oh, so long, Marianne
It's time that we began to laugh
And cry and cry and laugh about it all again

Oh, you are really such a pretty one
I see you've gone and changed your name again
And just when I climbed this whole mountainside
To wash my eyelids in the rain

And cry and cry and laugh about it all again","So Long, Marianne [DVD]",2009
Leonard Cohen,"Well I saw a crowd a-gathered
Must've been somebody shot
Reporters scribbled shorthand
And photographed the spot
I moved in a little closer
But I couldn't see no blood
Just a gold-plated chariot
Arisin' from the mud
Then I heard a soulful murmur
And it sounded like his voice
It began to sing, it was the King
It was Elvis' Rolls Royce

Now the wood-grained bar was open
Like he was about to have a drink
A white-gloved chauffeur at the wheel
I never saw him blink
The bobbies looked indifferent
Clearly they were not amused
It was just another auction piece
And it didn't matter whose
D-Day was upon me 
And I had to make a choice
Next thing I know
I'm at the wheel of Elvis' Rolls Royce

Well I made a left at Parliament
And hit the pedal hard
And I tipped my hat and I smiled
As I passed by Scotland Yard
Now the voice is talkin' to me
It says ""There's nothing to fear""
It was coming from the back seat
But there was no one in the mirror
I got a little nervous
I think I lost my poise
As we crossed the great Atlantic
In Elvis' Rolls Royce

When we got to New York City
The crowds went wild to say the least
As I steered my precious cargo
Through the belly of the beast
Then I took off down the Interstate
And drove throughout the night
Till I reached the state of Tennessee
In the early morning light
There they were, the gates of Graceland

My eyes got kind of moist
Home sweet home to rock'n'roll
And Elvis' Rolls Royce",Elvis' Rolls Royce,2009
Leonard Cohen,"Now, I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the lord of song
With nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

Like a bird on the wire,
like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free.

Like a worm on a hook,
like a knight from some old fashioned book
I have saved all my ribbons for thee.
If I, if I have been unkind,
I hope that you can just let it go by.
If I, if I have been untrue
I hope you know it was never to you.

Like a baby, stillborn,
like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out for me.
But I swear by this song
and by all that I have done wrong
I will make it all up to thee.

I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch,
he said to me, ""You must not ask for so much.""

And that was called love for the workers in song

You told me again you preferred handsome men
But for me you would make an exception

Who are oppressed by the figures of beauty
You fixed yourself, you said, ""Well never mind
We are ugly but we have the music""

So we struggle and we stagger
Down the snakes and up the ladder

I'm writing you now just to see if you're better

There's music on Clinton Street all through the evening

I hear that you're building your little house deep in the desert
You're living for nothing now, I hope you're keeping some kind of record

Yes, and Jane came by with a lock of your hair
She said that you gave it to her
That night that you planned to go clear
Did you ever go clear?

Ah, the last time we saw you you looked so much older
Your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder
You'd been to the station to meet every train, and
You came home without Lili Marlene

And you treated my woman to a flake of your life
And when she came back she was nobody's wife

Well I see you there with the rose in your teeth
One more thin gypsy thief
Well, I see Jane's awake
She sends her regards

And what can I tell you my brother, my killer
What can I possibly say?
I guess that I miss you, I guess I forgive you
I'm glad you stood in my way

If you ever come by here, for Jane or for me
Well, your enemy is sleeping, and his woman is free

Yes, and thanks, for the trouble you took from her eyes
I thought it was there for good so I never tried

When they poured across the border
I was cautioned to surrender,
This I could not do
I took my gun and vanished.

I have changed my name so often,
I've lost my wife and children
But I have many friends,
And some of them are with me.

An old woman gave us shelter,
Kept us hidden in the garret,
Then the soldiers came
She died without a whisper.

There were three of us this morning
I'm the only one this evening
But I must go on
The frontiers are my prison.

Oh, the wind, the wind is blowing,
Through the graves the wind is blowing,
Freedom soon will come,
Then we'll come from the shadows.

Ils me dirent, ""résigne toi,""
Mais je n'ai pas peur,

Hid us for the night

Come healing of the limb

Behold the gates of mercy
In arbitrary space
And none of us deserving
The cruelty or the grace

O solitude of longing
Where love has been confined
Come healing of the body
Come healing of the mind

O see the darkness yielding
That tore the light apart
Come healing of the reason
Come healing of the heart

O troubled dust concealing
An undivided love
The heart beneath is teaching
To the broken heart above

Let the heavens falter
Let the earth proclaim
Come healing of the altar
Come healing of the name

O longing of the branches
To lift the little bud
O longing of the arteries
To purify the blood

And let the heavens hear it
The penitential hymn
Come healing of the spirit
Come healing of the limb

O let the heavens hear it
The penitential hymn
Come healing of the spirit
Come healing of the limb",Come Healing,2012
Leonard Cohen,"I caught the darkness, it was drinking from your cup
I caught the darkness drinking from your cup
I said is this contagious?
You said just drink it up.

I got no future, 
I know my days are few
The present's not that pleasant
Just a lot of things to do
I thought the past would last me
But the darkness got that too

I shoulda seen it coming
It was right behind your eyes
You were young and it was summer
I just had to take a dive
When I knew was easy, the darkness was the price.

I don't smoke no cigarette, I don't drink no alcohol
I ain't had much loving yet
But that's always been your call
Hey I don't miss it baby
I got no taste for anything at all

I used to love the rainbow
And I used to love the view
Another early morning, I'd pretend that it was you
But I caught the darkness baby
And I got it worse than you

I caught the darkness, it was drinking from your cup
I caught the darkness, drinking from your cup
I said is this contagious?
You said just drink it up",Darkness,2012
Leonard Cohen,"We find ourselves on different sides
Of a line nobody drew
Though it all may be one in the higher eye
Down here where we live it is two

I to my side call the meek and the mild
You to your side call the Word
By virtue of suffering I claim to have won
You claim to have never been heard

Both of us say there are laws to obey
But frankly I don’t like your tone
You want to change the way I make love
I want to leave it alone

The pull of the moon, the thrust of the sun
And thus the ocean is crossed
The waters are blessed while a shadowy guest
Kindles a light for the lost

Both of us say there are laws to obey
But frankly I don’t like your tone
You want to change the way I make love
I want to leave it alone

Down in the valley the famine goes on
The famine up on the hill
I say that you shouldn’t, you couldn’t, you can’t
You say that you must and you will

Both of us say there are laws to obey
But frankly I don’t like your tone
You want to change the way I make love
I want to leave it alone

You want to live where the suffering is
I want to get out of town
C’mon baby give me a kiss
Stop writing everything down

Both of us say there are laws to obey
Yeah, but frankly I don’t like your tone
You want to change the way I make love

Leonard Cohen,"I love to speak with Leonard
He’s a sportsman and a shepherd
He’s a lazy bastard
Living in a suit

But he does say what I tell him
Even though it isn’t welcome
He just doesn't have the freedom
To refuse

He will speak these words of wisdom
Like a sage, a man of vision
Though he knows he’s really nothing
But the brief elaboration of a tube

Going home
Without my sorrow
Going home
Sometime tomorrow
Going home
To where it’s better
Than before

Going home
Without my burden
Going home
Behind the curtain
Going home
Without the costume
That I wore

He wants to write a love song
An anthem of forgiving
A manual for living with defeat

A cry above the suffering
A sacrifice recovering
But that isn’t what I need him
To complete

I want to make him certain
That he doesn’t have a burden
That he doesn’t need a vision
That he only has permission
To do my instant bidding
Which is to say what I have told him
To repeat

Going home
Without my sorrow
Going home
Sometime tomorrow
Going home
To where it’s better
Than before

Going home
Without my burden
Going home
Behind the curtain
Going home
Without this costume

I'm going home

The wind in the trees

Well the mouse ate the crumb
Then the cat ate the crust
Now they’ve fallen in love
They’re talking in tongues

Show me the place, I can't move this thing alone

To cast me out discourteously

Delighting in your very company
Now if you intend to show me disdain

Don't you know it all the more enraptures me
For even so I still remain your lover in captivity
Green sleeves, you're all alone
The leaves have fallen, the men have gone
Green sleeves, there's no one home
Not even the Lady Green Sleeves

I sang my songs, I told my lies
To lie between your matchless thighs
And ain't it fine, ain't it wild
To finally end our exercise
Then I saw you naked in the early dawn
Oh, I hoped you would be someone new

I reached for you but you were gone

And the band is really happening
And the Johnny Walker wisdom running high
And my very sweet companion
She's the angel of compassion
She's rubbing half the world against her thigh
And every drinker every dancer
Lifts a happy face to thank her
The fiddler fiddles something so sublime
All the women tear their blouses off
And the men they dance on the polka-dots
And it's partner found, it's partner lost
And it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops

Ah we're lonely, we're romantic
And the cider's laced with acid
And the holy spirit's crying, where's the beef?
And the moon is swimming naked
And the summer night is fragrant
With a mighty expectation of relief
So we struggle and we stagger
Down the snakes and up the ladder
To the tower where the blessed hours chime
And I swear it happened just like this
A sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss
The gates of love they budged an inch
I can't say much has happened since

Declaring, (declaring) declaring,declaring that your body's really you
And I loved you when our love was blessed
And I love you now there's nothing left
But sorrow and a sense of overtime
And I missed you since the place got wrecked

And the place is dead as heaven on a Saturday night
And my very close companion
Gets me fumbling gets me laughing
She's a hundred but she's wearing
Something tight
And I lift my glass to the awful truth
Which you can't reveal to the ears of youth
Except to say it isn't worth a dime
And the whole damn place goes crazy twice
And it's once for the devil and once for Christ

Leonard Cohen,"I saw some people starving
There was murder, there was rape
Their villages were burning
They were trying to escape
I couldn't meet their glances
I was staring at my shoes
It was acid, it was tragic
It was almost like the blues
It was almost like the blues

I have to die a little
Between each murderous thought
And when I'm finished thinking
I have to die a lot
There's torture and there's killing
And there's all my bad reviews
The war, the children missing
Lord, it's almost like the blues
It's almost like a blues

So I let my heart get frozen
To keep away the rot
My father says I'm chosen
My mother says I'm not
I listened to their story
Of the Gypsies and the Jews
It was good, it wasn't boring
It was almost like the blues
It was almost like the blues

There is no God in Heaven
And there is no Hell below
So says the great professor
Of all there is to know
But I've had the invitation
That a sinner can't refuse
And it's almost like salvation

It's almost like a blues
Almost like a blues",Almost Like the Blues,2014
Leonard Cohen,"I was born in chains but I was taken out of Egypt
I was bound to a burden, but the burden it was raised
Lord I can no longer keep this secret
Blessed is the name, the name be praised

I fled to the edge of a mighty sea of sorrow
Pursued by the riders of a cruel and dark regime
But the waters parted and my soul crossed over
Out of Egypt, out of Pharaoh’s dream

Word of words and the measure of all measures
Blessed is the name, the name be blessed
Written on my heart in burning letters
That’s all I know, I cannot read the rest

I was idled with my soul, when I heard that you could use me
I followed very closely, but my life remained the same
But then you showed me where you had been wounded
In every atom broken is a name

I was alone on the road, your love was so confusing
All my teachers told me I had myself to blame
But in the grip of sensual illusion
The sweet unknowing unifies a name

Word of words, and the measure of all measures
Blessed is the name, the name be blessed
Written on my heart in burning letters
That’s all I know, I cannot read the rest

I've heard the soul unfolds in the chambers of its longing
And the bitter liquor sweetens in the amber cup
But all the ladders of the night have fallen
Only darkness now, to lift the longing up

Word of words and measure of all measures
Blessed is the name, the name be blessed
Written on my heart in burning letters
That’s all I know, I cannot read the rest",Born in Chains,2014

And is it still raining
Back in November

The almond trees whither
Was I ever someone
Who could love you forever

It wasn't all that easy
When you up and walked away
But I’ll save that little story
For another rainy day
I know the burden’s heavy
As you wheel it through the night
Some people say it’s empty
But that don’t mean it’s light

You left me with the dishes
And a baby in the bath

You wear their camouflage
You always said we’re equal

To the old red white and blue

Baby don’t ignore me
We were smokers, we were friends
Forget that tired story
Of betrayal and revenge

And I’ll cry for you again

And magnums of champagne

What my life would seem to me
If I couldn’t lift the veil
And see your face

And if no leaves were on the tree
And no water in the sea
And the break of day
Had nothing to reveal
That’s how broken I would be
What my life would seem to me
If I didn’t have your love
To make it real

If the sun would lose its light
And we lived an endless night
And there was nothing left
That you could feel
If the sea were sand alone
And the flowers made of stone
And no one that you hurt
Could ever heal

Leonard Feather,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,
Leonard Feather,"Why do they think up stories that link my name with yours?
Why do the neighbors chatter all day, behind their doors?
I know a way to prove what they say is quite untrue.
Here is the gist, a practical list of ""donts"" for you.

Don't throw bouquets at me
Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much
People will say we're in love!

Don't sigh and gaze at me
Your sighs are so like mine
Your eyes mustn't glow like mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't start collecting things
Give me my rose and my glove.
Sweetheart they're suspecting things
People will say we're in love.

Don't praise my charm too much
Don't look so vain with me
Don't stand in the rain with me
People will say we're in love!

Don't take my arm too much
Don't keep your hand in mine
Your hand feels so grand in mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't dance all night with me
Till the stars fade from above.
They'll see it's alright with me
People will say we're in love.",People Will Say We're in Love,1956

That is not the question! 
I decided long ago to be! 
With me, it's what to be
Now, make me some suggestions
Good or bad
Which is the best for me? 
When you're after fun and laughter, this aggravates you
Some reformers say a warmer climate awaits you! 

If it's naughty to rouge your lips
Shake your shoulders and shake your hips
Let a lady confess, I want to be bad! 

If it's naughty to vamp the men
Sleep each morning till after ten
Then the answer is yes, I want to be bad! 

This thing of being a good little goody is all very well 
What can you do when you're loaded with plenty of health 
And vigor

When you're learning what lips are for 
And it's naughty to ask for more 
Let a lady confess, I want to be bad! 

Oh, if it's naughty to rouge your lips
Shake your shoulders and shake your hips 
Then, let a lady confess, I want to be bad! 
Boop-boop-a-doop! 

And, if it's naughty to vamp the men
Sleep each morning till after ten
Then the answer is yes, I want to be bad!

The prosecutor stated that they did not know who killed their agents
Nor did he know what participation Leonard Peltier may have played in it
But someone has to pay for the crime

There's a lot of nights that I lay in my cell
And I can't understand why this hell this hell and this terror
That I have been going through for twenty-one years hasn't ended

Sacrifice your freedom
Sacrifice your prayer
Take away your language
Cut off all your hair
Sacrifice the loved ones
Who always stood by me
Stranded in the wasteland
Set my spirit free

But yet I know in my heart that someone has to pay sacrifice
To make things better for our people
The sacrifice I have made when I really sit down to think about it
Is nothing compared to what our people a couple hundred years ago
Or fifty years ago or twenty-five years ago have made
Some gave their lives
Some had to stand there and watch their children die in their arms
So the sacrifice I have made is nothing compared to those

I've gone too far now to start backing down
I don't give up
Not 'til my people are free will I give up
And if I have to sacrifice some more
Then I sacrifice some more",Sacrifice,1998

Leonard Weir,"Well after all, Pickering,
I'm an ordinary man,
Who desires nothing more than an ordinary chance,
to live exactly as he likes, and do precisely what he wants...
An average man am I, of no eccentric whim,
Who likes to live his life, free of strife,
doing whatever he thinks is best, for him,
Well... just an ordinary man...

BUT, Let a woman in your life
and your serenity is through,
she'll redecorate your home,
from the cellar to the dome,
and then go on to the enthralling fun of overhauling you...

Let a woman in your life,
and you're up against a wall,
make a plan and you will find,
that she has something else in mind,
and so rather than do either you do something else that neither likes at all

You want to talk of Keats and Milton, she only wants to talk of love,
You go to see a play or ballet, and spend it searching for her glove,
Let a woman in your life and you invite eternal strife,
Let them buy their wedding bands for those anxious little hands...
I'd be equally as willing for a dentist to be drilling than to ever let
a woman in my life,

I'm a very gentle man, even tempered and good natured who you never hear complain,
Who has the milk of human kindness by the quart in every vein,
A patient man am I, down to my fingertips, 
the sort who never could, ever would, let an insulting remark escape his lips
Very gentle man...

But, Let a woman in your life, and patience hasn't got a chance,
she will beg you for advice,
your reply will be concise, and she will listen very nicely,
and then go out and do exactly what she wants!!!

You are a man of grace and polish, who never spoke above a hush,
all at once you're using language that would make a sailor blush,
Let a woman in your life, and you're plunging in a knife,
Let the others of my sex, tie the knot around their necks, 
I prefer a new edition of the Spanish Inquisition than to ever let a
woman in my life

I'm a quiet living man,
who prefers to spend the evening in the silence of his room,
who likes an atmosphere as restful as an undiscovered tomb,
A pensive man am I, of philosophical joys,
who likes to meditate, contemplate, far for humanities mad inhuman noise,
Quiet living man....

But, let a woman in your life, and your sabbatical is through,
in a line that never ends comes an army of her friends, 
come to jabber and to chatter and to tell her what the matter is with YOU!,
she'll have a booming boisterous family,
who will descend on you en mass,
she'll have a large Wagnerian mother, with a voice that shatters glass,

She almost makes the day begin.
I've grown accustomed to the tune
That she whistles night and noon.
Her smiles, her frowns,
Her ups, her downs

Like breathing out and breathing in.

I was serenely independent
And content before we met.
Surely I could always be that way again - and yet,
I've grown accustomed to her look,
Accustomed to her voice,
Accustomed to her face.

Marry Freddy. What an infantile idea. What a heartless,
wicked, brainless thing to do. But she'll regret it. It's
doomed before they even take the vow.

I can see her now, Mrs. Freddy Eynsford-Hill,
In a wretched little flat above a store.
I can see her now, not a penny in the till,
And a bill collector beating at the door.
She'll try to teach the things I taught her,
And end up selling flowers instead.
Begging for her bread and water,
While her husband has his breakfast in bed.

In a year or so, when she's prematurely grey,
And the blossom in her cheek has turned to chalk,
She'll come home and lo,
He'll have upped and run away,
With a social-climbing heiress from New York.
Poor Eliza. How simply frightful!
How humiliating! How delightful!

How poignant it'll be on that inevitable night
When she hammers on my door in tears and rags.
Miserable and lonely, repentant and contrite,
Will I take her in or hurl her to the walls?
Give her kindness or the treatment she deserves?
Will I take her back or throw the baggage out?

But, I'm a most forgiving man,
The sort who never could, never would,
Take a position and staunchly never budge.
A most forgiving man.

But I shall never take take her back
If she were even crawling on her knees.
Let her promise to atone,
Let her shiver, let her moan,
I'll slam the door and let the hell-cat freeze!

Marry Freddy, HA!

But I'm so used to hear her day,
""Good morning"" ev'ry day.
Her joys, her woes,
Her highs, her lows,
Are second nature to me now,
Like breathing out and breathing in.

I'm very grateful she's a woman,
And so easy to forget, rather like a habit

really need won't you please
bring my baby to me…
Oh I don't want
a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door
Oh I just want him for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby all I want for
Christmas is
You…
All I want for
Christmas is you baby
All I want for
Christmas is you baby
All I want for
Christmas is you baby
All I want for
Christmas is you baby
All I want for
Christmas is you baby
All I want for
Christmas is you baby",All I Want for Christmas,
Leonardo,"Mano, você é meu sangue, mais que um amigo
Me dizia coisas que até hoje eu sigo
E será pra sempre um pedaço de mim
Mano, cantar ao seu lado me deixou orgulhoso
Agradeço a Deus, foi maravilhoso
E sempre sonhei com imagens assim
Mano, eu me lembro do nosso pequeno universo
O primeiro acorde, os primeiros versos
Parei pra pensar hoje no camarim 

Juntos, nós fomos a voz de uma linda canção
Digo a você lá no fundo do meu coração
Nossa missão foi cantar e levar alegria
Mano, você é a letra, eu sou a melodia 

Mano, você sempre foi mais que um companheiro
Nas horas difíceis foi tão verdadeiro
Me deu a certeza que no fim vou vencer
Você me dizia que depois da poeira
Um lindo horizonte vai aparecer
Mano, as suas palavras me fizeram de aço
E hoje eu sei que em tudo que eu faço
Eu posso cantar e contar com você",Mano,1999
Leonardo,"Triste como a noite sem estrelas
Meu coração navega no escuro
Procuro um horizonte nas lembranças
Pra encontrar o meu futuro 

Atrás de um sorriso eu me escondo
De todas as tristezas desse mundo
Nossos caminhos num segundo 

Os anjos criam asas depois voam
Na imensidão de céu deixando em nós
Pra sempre um saudade, um silêncio
Calando a nossa voz

O sonho acabou, o sol se apagou

Eu dava um tempo e ia embora
Tô perdendo a minha paz
Jogando a vida fora

Buscava outra companhia
Se eu vivesse de ilusão
Era uma festa todo dia
Mas eu sei que não tem jeito

É só teu corpo que eu vejo

É tua boca que eu beijo
E assim que eu vou bater

Tava um calor arretado
Quando ela foi chegando
E já sentado do meu lado 

Nunca vi coisa mais linda
Que mulher, que avião
Tomando água de coco
Era uma tentação 

Virava o coco na boca
Dava uma lambidinha
Derramava água na roupa
E ficava molhadinha 

Naquele jeito gostoso
Atiçava o meu desejo
Deu vontade de beber
Água de coco no seu beijo 

Ela segurava o coco
E alisava o canudinho
Pra me deixar no sufoco
Dava um tapinha no coco
Só pra deixar doidinho

Já tentei buscar
Uma paixão
Um novo sentimento
Mais você não sai
Nenhum segundo

É locura tentar te esquecer

Tanto tempo 

Vai levar a vida inteira
Pra te esquecer

Que ainda vou sofrer
Buscando em cada rosto
Ver o teu sorriso 

Vai bater uma saudade

Vou perder o juízo
Não te quero, mas,
Eu sei que te preciso",Longe de Você,2006

É maior que o oceano

E essa minha dor não some
Me faz falta o teu sorriso solidão tem o seu nome
Tem o seu nome 

O meu pensamento a todo momento
Vai te buscar sem te encontrar
A saudade entra em meu quarto e deita
Vem pra me amar em seu lugar

Tudo lembra você, um me olha te vê
Basta só procurar no meu olhar",Maior Amor Do Mundo,2006

De pensar em você
Mas como desistir
Do que eu mais quero ter
Não deu certo uma vez
E nunca mais vai dar
Depois do que me fez
Não era pra eu te amar
Ah, meu amor
Que raiva que me dá

Madrugada é solidão
Parece estar vindo alguém
Virou alucinação
Olho e não vejo ninguém
Quanto mais eu tento te odiar
Mais te quero bem

Dizem que amar é sofrer
Isso nunca vai mudar

Pra acabar de arrebentar
Acho que nasci pra te querer

Conhecer as manhas e as manhãs

É preciso amor pra poder pulsar
É preciso paz pra poder sorrir
É preciso a chuva para florir

Penso que cumprir a vida seja simplesmente

Leonardo,"Uma vez você falou que era meu o seu amor
Que ninguém ia separar você de mim

Todo amor que eu guardei a você eu entreguei
Eu não suporto tanta dor, tanto sofrer

Agora você vem dizendo adeus

Toda ternura que eu lhe dei
Ninguém no mundo vai lhe ofertar
E seus cabelos só eu sei como afagar

Já não quer mais solidão
Já não suporta mais sofrer ingratidão

Agora você vem dizendo adeus
Que foi que eu fiz pra que você me trate assim?

Alguns objetos que na despedida você não levou
Um batom usado caído no canto da penteadeira
Um vestido velho cheio de poeira
Jogado no quarto com marcas de amor

Vestido de seda o seu manequim também te deixou
Aí no cantinho não tem mais valor
Se não tem aquela que tanto te usou
Eu também não passo de um trapo humano sem minha querida
Usado e jogado num canto da vida
Não sei o que faço sem meu grande amor

Eu já nem acendo a luz do meu quarto quando vou deitar
Porque no escuro não vejo no espelho meus olhos chorando
Não vou na cozinha pra não ver dois copos vazios na mesa
Fazendo lembrar com tanta tristeza
Da última noite que nós nos amamos

Vestido de seda o seu manequim também te deixou
Aí no cantinho não tem mais valor

De ter você, meu bem, ao meu lado
Eu preciso ser mais forte
Para resistir e viver conformado

Se é que o destino existe
Não foi favorável para os dias meus
Não tive a felicidade
De ser o pai dos filhos seus

Às vezes a saudade aperta
Eu vou à procura dos velhos amigos
Somente para perguntar
Como vai você, se está tudo bem
Embora sabendo que vive ao lado de outro
Eu me preocupo
É esse o verdadeiro amor
É a paixão de um homem quando ama alguém

Se eu
Não tivesse a força que tenho no peito
Eu seria um boêmio perfeito
E dos botequins um eterno freguês

Mas eu
Prefiro curtir com dignidade

Eu bebo somente uma vez por mês

Me miro al pasar
Yo le sonrei

Me pidio que no

Que otra vez será
Tierno amanecer,
Sé que nunca mas.
Como olvidar su pelo
Como olvidar su aroma
Si aun navega en mis labios
El sabor de su boca
Cada piba que pase
Con un libro en la mano
Me traera su nombre
Como en aquel verano
Eeeh eeeh eeeh...
Fuiste mia un verano
Solamente un verano
Yo no olvido la playa,
Ni aquel viejo café,
Ni aquel pajaro herido
Que entiviaste en tus manos
Ni tu voz ni tus pasos
Se alejaran de mi

Que otra vez será
Que otra vez será

encontraría un motivo
para seguir viviendo, de poder luchar.

Y comence a volverme loco, cuando no estabas
Y descubri que algo paso, muy dentro mio,
Y se mojo mi corazon, con un rocio

Y me enredaste en tu informal filosofia,
Y me mostraste un mundo, que no conocia
Y me volviste a la niñez y a la inocencia,
Y a aquellos años puros de mi adolescencia

Y sin querer me hiciste hacer todo de nuevo,
Y solo en vos, me pude ver simple y sincero,
Y me enseñaste a ver el sol en la avenida,
Y hasta intente hacerme querer por tus amigas

Y si mañana ya no estoy, o me voy lejos,
O no siento lo mismo que hoy, o me hago viejo

Sua graça me sustém
Pelo seu sangue sou livre

Está a preparar
Nova terra, novo lar
Onde a morte não vive

Basta um vislumbre da eternidade e sinto euforia
Mas pra herdar a glória do futuro
Preciso praticar seu reino aqui

Quero entender o sentido
Quero sentir o entendido
Quero viver minha vida em função de um pedido
Que ele transforme minha mente e o meu coração

I have shaken every tree

Where's the love?
Where were you?
Now there are sparkles on the pavement
The stars are reaching down for me

Of all the reasons why I hated school
It seemed so black and white I mean
Every moment had a rule
Maybe that's why I see red

I wonder what will ever wake you up
The bells of a thousand firetrucks
I sure hope that one day you wake up

Out of the sea
You're not like all of the rest
You're always smiling and waving
When I was younger I was sure
I could fly above it all
I remember looking down
But I'm so tied up
To the ground now
You're not like all of the rest
You're always smiling and waiving
Can I be sonic too ?
Stars in my eyes stars in my hair
Stars and footprints in the air
Could I ever be that tall
Wrapped up in this mortal coil ?
You're not like all of the rest
You're always smiling and waiving
Who catches you when you're falling ?

Leonardos Bride,"Don't be confused by my apparent lack of ceremony,
My mind is clear
I may be low or miles high off in the distance,
I want you near
I love you, even when I'm sleeping
When I close my eyes,you're everywhere.
And if they take me flying on the magic carpet,
See me wave
If our communication fails I'll reconnect it, 
I want to rave 
I love you, even when I'm sleeping
When I close my eyes, you're everywhere
No matter where the road is leading us remember, don't be afraid
We have a continent that sometimes comes between us, that's ok
I love you, even when I'm sleeping 
When I close my eyes, you're everywhere",Even When I'm Sleeping,2003

No quiero estar

No no puedo entender ya

Para soportar 

Que no este para verte caer

Que si me tocas se quema mi piel
Ahora tal vez lo puedas entender
Y no te vuelvas si no quieres ver

Que lloro por ti
Que lloro sin ti
Que ya lo entendí que no eres para mí
Y lloro

Nunca me sentí tan solo como cuando ayer
De pronto lo entendí mientras callaba
La vida me dijo a gritos 
Que nunca te tuve y nunca te perdí y me explicaba 
Que el amor es una cosa que se da de pronto 
En forma natural, lleno de fuego
Si lo fuerzas, se marchita 
Sin tener principio, llega a su final

Y ahora tal vez lo puedas entiender
Que si me tocas se quema mi piel
Ahora tal vez lo puedas entender
Y no te vuelvas si no quieres ver

Vicious and clean edge like a razor hunting the lazerblade
Its free to the sweet one the short and the brief one silence is dangerous

Du jour où j'ai omis, 
de mettre et même de soumettre, 
ce qui aurait pû permettre...

et me réveiller en fin d'été

Tes idées démoniaques
Ces journées toutes idyliques, 
Et toutes les autres en vrac.

triste llega caramba y mi cama está vacía 

Oye que triste quedé, cuando se fue Paula C 
Busco de noche, busco de día, busco en la carta y adonde se iría

Oye que triste quedé, cuando se fue Paula C 
De buscar por el barrio me cansé, busca y busca y nunca la hallé

Leopoldo Federico Orchestra,"Por la esquina del viejo barrio lo vi pasar
Con el tumbao' que tienen los guapos al caminar
Las manos siempre en los bolsillos de su gabán
Pa' que no sepan en cuál de ellas lleva el puñal

Usa un sombrero de ala ancha de medio lao
Y zapatillas por si hay problemas salir volao'
Lentes oscuros pa' que no sepan qué está mirando
Y un diente de oro que cuando rie se ve brillando

Como a tres cuadras de aquella esquina una mujer
Va recorriendo la acera entera por quinta vez
Y en un zaguán entra y se da un trago para olvidar
Que el día está flojo y no hay clientes pa' trabajar

Un carro pasa muy despacito por la avenida
No tiene marcas pero toos' saben ques' policia uhm
Pedro Navaja las manos siempre dentro el gabán
Mira y sonríe y el diente de oro vuelve a brillar

Mientras camina pasa la vista de esquina a esquina
No se ve un alma está desierta toa' la avenida
Cuando de pronto esa mujer sale del zaguán
Y Pedro Navaja aprieta un puño dentro 'el gabán

Mira pa' un lado mira pal' otro y no ve a nadie
Y a la carrera pero sin ruido cruza la calle
Y mientras tanto en la otra acera va esa mujer
Refunfuñando pues no hizo pesos con qué comer

Mientras camina del viejo abrigo saca un revolver, esa mujer
Iba a guardarlo en su cartera pa' que no estorbe
Un treinta y ocho esmithanhueson del especial
Que carga encima pa' que la libre de todo mal

Y Pedro Navaja puñal en mano le fue pa' encima
El diente de oro iba alumbrando
Toa' la avenida, se le hizo facil
Mientras reia el puñal le hundía sin compasión
Cuando de pronto sonó un disparo como un cañon

Y Pedro Navaja cayó en la acera mientras veía, a esa mujer
Que revolver en mano y de muerte herida ahí le decía
Yo que pensaba hoy no es mi día estoy salá
Pero pedro navaja tu estas peor, no estas en na

Y creanme gente que aunque hubo ruido nadien salió
No hubo curiosos, no hubo preguntas nadie lloró
Sólo un borracho con los dos cuerpos se tropezo
Cojio el revolver, el puñal, los pesos y se marchó
Y tropezando se fue cantando desafinao'
El coro que aqui les traje y da el mensaje de mi cancion

La vida te da sorpresas. sorpresas te da la vida ay dios
Pedró Navajas matón de esquina
Quien a hierro mata, a hierro termina

La vida te da sorpresas
Sorpresas te da la vida ay dios
Valiente pescador, al anzuelo que tiraste
En vez de una sardina, un tiburón enganchaste

La vida te da sorpresas
Sorpresas te da la vida, ay dios
Ocho millones de historias tiene la ciudad de Nueva York

La vida te da sorpresas
Sorpresas te da la vida, ay dios
Como decía mi abuelita
El que último rie, se rie mejor

La vida te da sorpresas
Sorpresas te da la vida, ay dios
Cuando lo manda el destino
No lo cambia ni el mas bravo
Si necesitas un martillo del cielo te caen los clavos

La vida te da sorpresas
Sorpresas te da la vida, ay dios
De barrio cuidao en la acera
Cuidao camara que no corre vuela

La vida te da sorpresas
Sorpresas te da la vida, ay dios

El borracho doblo por el callejón

La vida te da",Pedro Navaja,2014
Leopoldo Federico y Su Orquestra,"Acaricia mi sueño
El suave murmullo de tu suspirar
Como ríe la vida
Si tus ojos negros me quieren mirar
Y si es mío el amparo
De tu risa leve
Que es como un cantar
Ella quieta mi herida
Todo, todo se olvida

El día que me quieras
La rosa que engalana
Se vestirá de fiesta
Con su mejor color
Y al viento las campanas
Dirán que ya eres mía
Y locas las fontanas
Se contaran su amor

La noche que me quieras
Desde el azul del cielo
Las estrellas celosas
Nos miraran pasar
Y un rayo misterioso
Hará nido en tu pelo
Luciérnaga curiosa
Que vera que eres mi consuelo

El día que me quieras
No habrá mas que armonía
Será clara la aurora
Y alegre el manantial
Traerá quieta la brisa
Rumor de melodías
Y nos darán las fuentes

Leos Carax,"When you're a French director, it seems la vie est belle
Women say “oui,” they long to be, top of the bill, oh well
When you're a French director, you're an auteur as well
What does that mean?
Every scene must be obscure as hell
When you're a French director
You never smile, what's the deal?
Hollywood guys, with their CGI eyes smile
But their films lack “le feel”

When you're a French director
Un César, do you really care?
You can't admit it
But you could fit it

Gonna put it down.	all these little crime thangs,
Homeless, the world is crazy bwoy
It's like this

It's the way it is
Heavy out there.. it's heavy.

Was i really such a bad child that i deserved to get hit with boards
And whooped with extension cords?
Did you forget that i was your creation,
And all i wanted from you all was love, hope, and motivation?

Son, you're disrespectful and you're talking back,
Get out my face, kicked me out the house
And wouldn't even let me plead my case.
Now i'm homeless and i'm freezing like the morgue,

The only thing keepin me alive is the lord
Needless to say it's times like this i'd rather be locked up then
Drinkin water out my hands and eatin out of garbage cans
Can i come back home, huh could i?
Son, you're on your own, why should i?

Things will never change, that's just the way it is
Nobody's even concerned
Some things will never change, that's just the way it is
When will we ever learn?

Huh. three years from now, i think i'm gon be straight, (straight)
I put my name on the list for section 8
Tried out for the army but i was flat footed,
Didn't do no harm to me, 'cause i was used to it

If i apply for some work, let's make a bet,
I'll get the nine
'Cause i don't know about the internet
What do you think we need to do to change about this nation?

Need to provide more jobs and better education

Already got enough to blow the world up
A thousand times

Teenage pregnancies, std's

A-wuh a wait a minute, i hear sirens
Oh that's the couple down the street
Domestic violence
Either them or the little girl in 306

She's always telling everyone that she gon slice her wrists
I guess that's the way it is in the life of sin
Where you'll probably end up dead, or in the pen
But my family ain't no better than the next

My auntie brenda turned her own sister in
For writing bad checks
And save folks try to hit you where it hurts
Knowin' they the biggest hypocrites in the church

We need to give our minds a bath and
Do some scrubbin'
Stop the hate and start the lovin'

You in our kitchen making love,
Inside and I, you in pinned
Smell of your love smoking fingers
Bruise and bleeding all still lingers on
Inside this head of mine
And when I hear your music playing
Again I hear your sad voice saying
You were never satisfied

As I rinsed my hair this morning
When I called out, you weren't there
And the diesel truck the neighbor drives
Fools me into thinking you're alive
And coming home to stay
But you were running like a chalkboard scratch
All night long, no turning back up
Get what it's your heart a lie
And so you've left me here in pain and wonder
??? never pushing you like thunder coming from the gods
Oh, it might have saved you from the dark

Cold and hard and shiny
To match the way I feel
The dust in here is like a burning wind
Black as coal and thunder
Dark as all my sins

I took it for a long, long time
And a woman can take a lot
Two can be undone by three
But it only takes one shot

You were there
To see me beg and kneel
What kind of man would ask me then
If he could make a deal?
When lovers of the future read these lines
A sound of steel and thunder
Will echo in their minds

I took it for a long, long time
And a woman can take a lot
Two can be undone by three
But it only takes one shot

Here they come and who's that ridin' in that big ole shiny limousine
Look at all that chrome I do believe that's the sharpest thing I've seen

That sure is a pretty dress you know some women do look good in black

Leroy Holmes & His Orchestra,"As I cruised out one evening upon a night's career
I spied a lofty clipper ship and to her I did steer
I heisted out my signals which she so quickly knew
And when she saw my bunting fly she immediately hove to-woo-woo

She had a dark and rovin' eye, and her hair hung down in ringlets
She was a nice girl, a proper girl but one of the rovin' kind

Oh pardon me, she says to me, for being out so late
But if my parents heard of this all sad would be my fate
My father is in politics, a good and righteous man 
My mother is an acrobat, I do the best I can

She had a dark and rovin' eye, and her hair hung down in ringlets
She was a nice girl, a proper girl but one of the rovin' kind

I took her for some fish and chips and treated her so fine
And hardly did I realize she was the rovin' kind
I kissed her lips, I missed her lips and found to my surprise
She was nothin' but a pirate ship rigged up in a disguise

She had a dark and rovin' eye, and her hair hung down in ringlets
She was a nice girl, a proper girl but one of the rovin' kind

So, come all you good sailor men who sail the wintry sea
And come, all you apprentice lads, a warnin' take from me
Beware of lofty clipper ships, they'll be the ruin of you
For 'twas there she made me walk the plank and pushed me under, too

But I'm still alive
Still looking for the life
The endless pool on the other side
It's a wild wild west
I'm doing my best

I'm at the borderline of my faith,
I'm at the hinterland of my devotion
In the front line of this battle of mine
But I'm still alive

I'm a soldier of love.
Every day and night
I'm a soldier of love
All the days of my life

I've been torn up inside (oh!)
I've been left behind (oh!)
So I ride
I have the will to survive

In the wild wild west,
Trying my hardest
Doing my best
To stay alive

I am love's soldier!

I'm a nut, I'm a nut
My live don't ever get in a rut, whoop-whoop-whoop-whoop
The head on my shoulders is sorta loose
And I ain't got the sense God gave a goose
Lord, I ain't crazy, but ...I'm a nut

Is is wetter under water, if you're there when it rains?
Is it shorter to New York, than it is by a plane?
Between myself and I, I wonder who's the dumber
Is it hotter down south, than it is in the summer?

Wheelin', dealin', left ol' Vegas on a Greyhound bus
I shouldn't have set the woods on fire while I was there
But remember only forest fires prevent bears

The poverty war will be over, when I begin to fight
If it took a dime to go 'round the world
I couldn't get out of sight

If they don't mind to go Dutch
Makes me feel like a million dollars
And I bet I ain't worth half that much

Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

High in the sky up above

You can't fake a smile forever
Are you really doing alright?
Everything is such you wanted
You try your best to calm the longing
But there are certain things you can't deny
Pictures of before haunt you daily
What happens when the door opens

A pair of dancing shoes
Her only wish waiting on Christmas Eve
Now she is laying on her bed
She's smiling in her sleep
Watch her dance in the night
There's no worries by her side
She just knows she wants to be a little dancer
Wishing for a dream

Perfect was within your reach
But your mind ran and your heart couldn't keep up
Bottle all of your passion inside
It's not too late to change the story
You could rearrange it only
If letting go of fears is what you decide
Can't help but they dream
Thoughts keep racing
You almost wanna scream
You're yearning for it

Her only wish waiting on Christmas Eve
Now she is laying on her bed

No matter where you go

But are you missing me?
I know you're missing me

Looking down on my phone, see another missed call
I'm pissed off 
I never had these problems back when I was piss poor
Scared to see my daughter now because I'm lost in the life
In the bathroom getting high when she called twice
Sorry, but I'm scared at looking 
At something so precious when I'm a mess
And her mother knows it
I wonder if she ever regrets
Trying to convince my family that I'm only gone for these checks
When really I'm obsessed with getting my revenge through success
'Cause people hated on me, how can I not show 'em?
Fans waited on me, damn, how do I not owe 'em?
Imagine having to make that decision
While baby girl's in the kitchen, tears dripping 
Wondering where her pop's going
But I never meant to make you unhappy, can I see that smile?
Phone's ringing, ""Ey, yo, I'm with my child""
Anyways, I wanna write you a symphony
But instead she said

Five years to be more specific

You crossed the Pacific
Now is it a coincidence that 
My first instrument was a violin
That my father wanted for me, so we ended up buyin'
And now the instrumental that we're vibing to got one high end
And while I'm writing my first verse he called me up crying?
That shit is crazy, half a decade with no explanation
Now you're asking if it's too late to save us
Man, I don't know so I hang up but I'm saying nothing 
Just click end
Wasn't man enough to say it so I wrote with a pen
I just wanted to make you happy, but you never smile
I just wanted that phone call that said your daddy's proud
Anyways, maybe eventually we'll relive memories 
And you'll be next to me and both of us can stay a while, yeah

Leroy Van Dyke,"There was a boy in Arkansas who wouldn't listen to his ma
When she told him that he should go to school
He'd sneak away in the afternoon, take a little walk and pretty soon
You'd find him at the local auction barn

Well he'd stand and listen carefully then pretty soon he began to see
How the auctioneer could talk so rapidly
He said, ""Oh my it's do or die I've got to learn that auction cry
Gotta make my mark and be an auctioneer""

25 dollar 30 now 30 dollar 30 dollar 
30 dollar 30 dollar give me a hollar 30 dollar
who will bid it at a 35 dollar bid?
35 dollar 35 35 make it 35 and a 35 make it 35 and a 35 
Who will bid it at a 35 dollar bid?

As time went on he did his best and all could see he didn't jest
He practied on and then some night and day
His pappy'd find him behind the barn just a workin up an awful storm
As he tried to imitate the auctioneer

Said his pappy, ""Son we just can't stand a havin' a mediocre man, 
You gotta take that auction usin' our good name.
I'll send you off to auction school and then you'll be nobody's fool
You can take your place among the best""

35 dollar 40 now 40 dollar 40 dollar 
40 dollar 40 dollar give me a hollar 40 dollar
Who will bid it at at a 40 dollar bid?
40 dollar 45 45 will you make it 45 give me 45 and a 45
Who will bid it at a 45 dollar bid?

So from that morning he went to school there grew a man who played it cool
He came back home a full fledged auctioneer
And people came from miles around just to hear him make that rhythmic sound
That filled their hearts with such a happy cheer

His fame reached out from shore to shore he had all he could do and more
He had to buy a plane to get around
Now he's the tops in all the land so let's all give that man a hand
He's the best of all the auctioneers

45 dollar 50 now 50 dollar 50 dollar
50 dollar 50 dollar give me a hollar 50 dollar

I could have danced, danced, danced all night

I understand dear
It's all been grand dear
But now it's time to sleep

I could have danced all night, I could have danced all night
And still have begged for more
I could have spread my wings and done a thousand things
I've never done before

I'll never know what made it so exciting
Why all at once my heart took flight
I only know when he began to dance with me
I could have danced, danced, danced all night",I Could Have Danced All Night [From My Fair Lady],1956
Leroy Vinnegar,"I cover the waterfront,
I'm watching the sea,,
Will the one I love,
Be coming back to me?

I cover the waterfront,
In search of my love,
And I'm covered by,
A starless sky above.

Here am I,
Patiently waiting,
Hoping and longing,
Oh! How I yearn!
Where are you?
Are you forgetting?
Do you remember?
Will you return?

I cover the waterfront,
I'm watching the sea,
For the one I love,
Must come back to me.",I Cover the Waterfront,1956
Leroy Vinnegar,"There's a song that's really jumping
And the fellas say it's Squatty Roo
And it's really dumping
La-de-doo",Squatty Roo,1956
Leroy Vinnegar,"Moonlight and magnolia, starlight in your hair
All the world a dream come true
Did it really happen, was I really there, was I really there with you?
 
We lived our little drama, we kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I can't forget the glamor, your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I never planned in my imagination a situation so heavenly
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear
My heart beat like a hammer, my arms wound around you tight
And stars fell on Alabama last night

Leroy Vinnegar,"You'd be so nice to come home to
You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high sang a lullaby
You'd be all that I could desire

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon burning above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon burning above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love",You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To,1964
Leroy Vinnegar,"Once I was alone
So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Down, down came the sun
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part
",Canadian Sunset,2000
