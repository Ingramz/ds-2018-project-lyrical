Johnny Horton,"There it stands in the corner with the barrel so straight 
I looked out the window and over the gate 
The big, fat rabbits are a-jumpin' in the grass 
Wait'll they hear my old shotgun blast Shotgun Boogie, 
I done saw your tracks Look out Mr. Rabbit 
When I cock my hammer back Well, over on the ridge is a scaly bark 

Hick'ry nuts so big you can see 'em in the dark 
The big fat squirrels they scratch and they bite 
I'll be on that ridge before daylight Shotgun Boogie, 
All I need is one shot Look out bushy tail, 
Tonight you'll be in the pot Well, I met a pretty gal, 
She was tall and thin I asked her what she had, she said
""A Fox Four-Ten"" I looked her up and down and said
""Boy, this is love"" So we headed for the brush 

To shoot a big fat dove Shotgun Boogie, 
Boy the feathers flew Look out Mister Dove 
When she draws a bead on you I sat down on a log, 
Took her on my lap She said, ""Wait a minute, 
Bub, you got to see my Pap He's got a sixteen-gauge choked down like a rifle 

He don't like a man that's a-gonna trifle"" 
Shotgun Boogie, draws a bead so fine 
Look out big boy, he's loaded all the time 
Well, I called on her Pap like a gentleman oughta 
He said, ""No brush hunter's gonna get my daughter"" 
He cocked back the hammer right on the spot 
When the gun went off, I outran the shot Shotgun Boogie, 
I wanted wedding bells I'll be back little gal, 
When your pappy runs out of shells",Shotgun Boogie,1996

Johnny Horton,"Big Sam left Seattle in the year of ninety-two
With George Pratt his partner and brother Billy too
They crossed the Yukon river and they found the bonanza gold
Below that old white mountain
Just a little south-east of Nome
Sam crossed the Majestic mountains to the valleys far below
He talked to his team of huskies
As he mushed on through the snow
With the northen lights a-runnin' wild
In the land of the midnight sun

In the year of nineteen-one

North to Alaska go north the rush is on
North to Alaska go north the rush is on

George turns to Sam with his gold in his hand
Said Sam you're lookin' at a lonely lonely man
I'd trade all the gold that's buried in this land
For one small band of gold to place on sweet little Jenny's hand
'Cause a man needs a woman to love him all the time
Remember Sam a true love is so hard to find
I'd build for my Jenny a honeymoon home

If you let me hold you honey I'd holler out loud

Johnny Horton,"I mushed from Port Barren through a blizzard of snow
Been out prospecting for two years or so
Pulled into Fairbanks the city was a boon
So I took a little stroll to the Red Dog Saloon
As I walked in the door the music was clear
The prettiest voice I had heard in two years
The song she was singin' made a man's blood run cold
When it's springtime in Alaska it's forty below
(When it's springtime in Alaska it's forty below)

It was red headed Luie who was singin' so sweet
I reached down and took the snowpacks off my feet
I reached for the gal who was singin' the tune
We did the Eskimo hop all around the saloon
Where the caribou crawl and the grizzly bear hug we did our dance on a Kodiac rug
The song she kept singing made a man's blood run cold
When it's springtime in Alaska it's forty below
I was as innocent as I could be I didn't know Luie was big Ed's wife to be
He took out his knife and he gave it a throw
When it's springtime in Alaska I'll be six feet below

Johnny Horton,"In May of nineteen forty-one the war had just begun
The Germans had the biggest ship, they had the biggest guns
The Bismarck was the fastest ship that ever sailed the sea
On her deck were guns as big as steers and shells as big as trees

Out of the cold and foggy night came the British ship, the Hood
And every British seaman, he knew and understood
They had to sink the Bismarck, the terror of the sea
Stop those guns as big as steers and those shells as big as trees

 We'll find the German battleship that's makin' such a fuss
 We gotta sink the Bismarck  cause the world depends on us
 Hit the decks a-runnin' boys and spin those guns around
 When we find the Bismarck we gotta cut her down

The Hood found the Bismarck on that fatal day
The Bismarck started firin' fifteen miles away
""We gotta sink the Bismarck"" was the battle sound
But when the smoke had cleared away, the mighty Hood went down

For six long days and weary nights they tried to find her trail
Churchill told the people ""put every ship a-sail
'Cause somewhere on that ocean I know she's gotta be
We gotta sink the Bismarck to the bottom of the sea""

 We'll find that German battleship that's makin' such a fuss
 We gotta sink the Bismarck 'cause the world depends on us
 Hit the decks a-runnin' boys and spin those guns around
 When we find the Bismarck we gotta cut her down

The fog was gone the seventh day and they saw the mornin' sun
Ten hours away from homeland the Bismarck made its run
The admiral of the British fleet said ""turn those bows around
We found that German battleship and we're gonna cut her down""

The British guns were aimed and the shells were comin' fast
The first shell hit the Bismarck, they knew she couldn't last
That mighty German battleship is just a memory
""Sink the Bismarck"" was the battle cry that shook the seven seas

We found that German battleship been makin' such a fuss
We had to sink the Bismarck 'cause the world depends on us
We hit the deck a-runnin' and we spun those guns around
Yeah, we found the mighty Bismarck and prepared to cut her down

We found that German battleship been  makin' such a fuss
We had to sink the Bismarck 'cause the world depends on us
We hit the deck a-runnin' and we spun those guns around

The way that I been needin' you
Well, drop me a line
Sayin' honey you'll be mine

Get your face all pretty and your hair done right
Cause we're gonna do the town tonight
Well I'm comin' into town and right on time I still got your lovin' on my mind


I'm a coming home I gotta make some love
I'm a coming home sweet turtle dove
I'm a coming home to make sweet love to you

They got a pretty little waitress with the carrot top
She's pretty as a doll pretty as can be
But don't you worry honey she ain't nothin' to me

Throwed in low and she's huggin' the ground
Scratchin' gears but I'm goin' again I'm comin' home baby I'm doggin' it in

High on a hill it calls to me
to be where little cable cars 
climb halfway to the stars!

above the blue and windy sea.
When I come home to you, San Francisco,
your golden sun will shine for me!

Standing on the corner feeling blue
Sweethearts out for fun
Pass me one by one
Guess I'll wind up like I always do
With only
Me and my shadow
Strolling down the avenue
Me and my shadow
Not a soul to tell our troubles to
And when it's twelve o'clock
We climb the stair
We never knock
For nobody's there
Just me and my shadow
All alone and feeling blue
When the sun sets on the far horizon
And the parlor lamps begin to glow
Jim and Jack and John
Put their slippers on
They're all set but we'restill on the go
So lonely

Strolling down the avenue

Recordada Denisse 
Pensando en mil cosas quizá 
Con el humo por testigo

Querida mía, perdona 
Si te ofendo al escribirte 
Pero me siento muy triste 
Por lo que anoche paso 

Hasta estoy arrepentido 
Y si acaso tu lo estas 

Ya no debes llorar mas 
Tienes que tener valor 
Por si dios te manda un hijo 

Por lo mas grande te exijo 
Que no le pongas mi nombre 
Para que no sea 
Como yo 

Que nunca pruebe licor 
Que nunca sufra una pena 
Y que nunca se enamore 
De la mujeres ajenas 

Que nunca sienta rencor 
Que a mi me corre en las venas 

Por que es triste soportar 
Esta terrible condena",La Carta,1999

Black to black
You should a seen 'er
Long and winding road to the arena
Crystal ball
I prophesized
What was on the horizon
Forewarned y'all
Is it any wonder
What kind of ground you goin' under
A September ender
To march madness remember?
You never heard a murder
Take for example
Unsolved mystery
Life lost in a funk sample
Enter the bandwagons
Braggin' hangin' banners
Clearin' the way for younger MC's
And new hammers
What was criticized six years back
Is now back
With New York on the jersey front and back
Feel like Tiger Woods
Got mad goods
Way up from the cheap seats
Comin' outta the hood
Race to the black seats
Amongst the wack seats
Be the hardcore
Alongside the deadbeats
The world lookin' on
Like spectators
At crucified gladiators
Feels like a jungle inside
Where fish swim birds fly
Man got a tendency to die
Man falls to the hands of man
But damn if I'll ever try
To survive at court side
Four tickets to fly
Rap or play ball do the game
Or duck the drive by

Same league that defends
Be the same ones that do us in
Spy's

And them suits in that

Eight times gold
But died of homicide
Twenty five years old
Heard he died in debt too
I ain't seen a winner yet, you?
The confused crowd boos
The move shit
In that corner
Number one in the east
The peace cursed for life
By the mark of the beast
Raised by peeps rode jeeps
Deep in Brooklyn beats
Praised as a hero
Who came up off the streets
The crowd looks on
Claimin' sides they don't own
A house built up on
Their skulls and bones
Knew it be a matter of time
The play by play
Two rappers slain
Main
So let us pray

Wit all the gunnin'
Crowd goin' crazy
Gettin' bigger
Proud to be called a bunch
Bitches and niggas

Field nigga goals
Hip hop shoot outs vs those house negros
Five bodies got on the shot clock
Runnin' down in the count made
The scoreboard rock
The referees the LAPD
The LVPD
Said they couldn't catch
What they couldn't see
Question
Was it bigger than the names
Not only in the game
But the game behind the game
Down to the remaining

Anatomy of a murder
Intensity of a mystery
Dead and gone

Helpless
As the atmosphere preyed on

The rhymes that died
Beats that deceased

Johnny Kemp,"It seems only yesterday I let you
We fell in love and made our vow
We said that we would always be together
Until the sun would cease to shine

And how was I to know that love wasn't easy?
I never seemed to matter then, oh oh oh
A victim of my own selfish feelings
I just only want is you (I want you) 
I just want is you, I just want is you baby

The feelings that we share with each other
So innocently we played the part
For in all of might there were no questions
And distantly I placed a heart

On and on we go, never stopping
To deal with what was on our mind, oh oh oh
We are victims of our own selfish feelings
Still my only want is you
My only want is you, just you, baby

So what does one do when love's in question?
I can't believe when you let it fall apart
I can't believe when you let it go, baby
Why don't you let it slip away?

And how was I to know that love was not easy?
I never seemed to matter then, And never seemed to matter.
And I'm a victim of my own selfish feelings
Oh, and my only want is you

My only want is you, baby
My only want is you, you're the only one I want
My only want is you, all alone right from the start
(Don't you know that really?  Don't you know?)
Doin' it over and over again, baby
You were the only one (Don't you know?)
I can say 'yeah' to you baby
Sayin' now, sayin' now, sayin' it right now
My only want is you, my only need is you baby

Could you just believe me baby when I touch you?

Johnny Kemp,"When I came by, I was hopin' you weren't home
You smiled and let me in
I told you that I need a shoulder to cry on
You gave me yours again
You say it's gonna be all right, I turned off the lights
In the darkness you held me tight and,

One thing led to another
Soon we were lost in each other
It was so warm, I found in your arms
Best of friends can be lovers after all

I checked the time, it's gettin' late, I've gotta go
You smiled and said, Please stay.
I kissed your lips and though I want to say no
And let you have your way
And mentioned it was not my plan, I don't want a one-night stand
That's when you took my heart away

One thing led to another
Soon we were lost in each other
It was so warm, I found in your arms
Best of friends can be lovers after all

When daylight appeared, what else could I do?
I simply whispered in your ear, confronting ,I love you.

One thing led to another
Soon we were lost in each other
It was so warm, I found in your arms

He'd open up his case and resin up his bow
Play upside down the orange blossom special

He'd slick back his hair, and open up his case
He'd play the Cherokee Fiddle, he'd play it for the whiskey
'Cause good whiskey never let him lose his place

He was always there, playing for the miners
The Devil's Dream was a song they understood
Then he'd go back to Oklahoma
Wait till the trains were running and the weather was good

And when he'd smell the smoke and the cinders
He'd slick back his hair, and open up his case
Play the Cherokee Fiddle, he'd play it for the whiskey
'Cause good whiskey never let him lose his place

Now the Indians are dressing up like cowboys
And the cowboys are putting leather and turquoise on
And the music is sold by lawyers
And the fools who fiddled in the middle of the stations are gone

Some folks say they'll never miss it
Old fiddle squealed like the Indian race
Cherokee Fiddle is gone forever
Like the music of the whistle that the old locomotives made

So when you smell the smoke and the cinders
Just slick back your hair, and open up your case
Play the Cherokee Fiddle, you can play it for the whiskey

You're bound to catch yourself eventually
Oh, you might've even caught it from me

Well, you've never felt this way before
So you worry about it naturally
Oh, well, there ain't no need to worry anymore
It just sounds like love to me

Johnny Lee,"There'll be a rainbow around the moon
You'll fall apart when you hear that tune
Every day will end too soon
When you fall in love
You'll get weak in the knees when you see her smile
You try your best to hid it 'cause it's not your style
You let it get you cryin' like a little child
When you fall in love

When you fall in love
It's out of your hands
It gets into your heart

It changes your plans
But you'll only understand
When you fall in love

The summer breeze will chill you to the bone
You'll walk the floor 'til the break of dawn
Sometimes you'll feel so alone
When you fall in love
And you won't notice, but the day that it shows
That light'll follow you wherever you go
And that's how you'll know
When you fall in love",When You Fall in Love,1983
Johnny Lee,"Don't wish it away
Don't look at it like it's forever
Between you and me, I could honestly say
That things can only get better

And while I'm away
Dust out the demons inside
And it won't be long before you and me run
To the place in our hearts where we hide

And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughing like children, living like lovers
Rolling like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues

Just stare into space
Picture my face in your hands
Live for each second without hesitation
And never forget I'm your man

Wait on me, girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever I simply love you
More than I love life itself

Johnny Lee,"All my friends had to ask me something they didn't understand
How I get all the women in the palm of my hand
I told them treat her like a lady; do the best you can do
You gotta treat her like a lady, she'll give in to you
Lord, you can seek, you know what I mean
 
I know you've heard that the woman soon takes advantage of you
Let me tell you my friend there just ain't no substitute, you ought to
Treat her like a lady do the best you can do
You gotta treat her like a lady, she'll give in to you
Lord, you can seek, you know what I mean
 
Oh, you've got to love her, tease her, but most of all you've got to please her
You've got to hold her and want her and make her feel you'll always need her
You know a woman is sentimental and so easy to upset
So make her feel that she's for real and she'll give you happiness
Woh, oh, oh, strange as it seems, you know you can't treat a woman mean
 
So my friend there you have it, the easy simple way
If you fail to do this, don't blame her if she looks my way
'Cause I'm gonna treat her like a lady;  so affectionately
I'm gonna treat her like a lady, she'll give in to me
Lord, you can seek, you know what I mean
 
Oh, you've gotta treat her like a lady, do the best you can do
You gotta treat her like a lady, she'll give in to you

I'm not one of those who can easily hide

I'd buy a big house where we both could live

Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words

How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

Said you gotta get it worked on, gotta get it worked on

Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree

And I like it, how about you?",How About You,1973

You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine
The zither's sweet refrain
Keeps swirling in your brain
Like new may wine
Strauss waltzes, candle-glow
And the laughter of long ago
Fill the magic chords and make it seem like today

Enchanted by a melody

Johnny Maddox,"I was born on a farm out in Ioway
A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree
And we all played just the same ""Goofus"" harmony
And I must admit we made a hit

Some place that's known to god alone
Just a spot to call our own

Out there beneath a kindly sky
We'll build a sweet little nest somewhere in the west

Johnny Maestro & the Brooklyn Bridge,"Blessed is the rain that falls on me
As far as that girl can see
The earth that I walk upon is heavenly
Blessed is the love I bring to her
And knowing what it means to her
In the eyes of that girl
I am everything to her

When the statue on the pedestal
Comes crumbling to the ground?
I don't want to be around
To see the sorrow on her face
When she thinks I let her down
And what happens
When she finds the world is real
And not the fairy-land she thinks it is?
That I'm a man who lives and breathes
And makes mistakes and not a
Superman she dreamed
Blessed is the strength she finds in me
And the weakness she'll never see

There goes a big one

Johnny Mandel,"Just when I thought that fate was unkind,
That happiness wasn't to be,
I got a shock and I changed my mind,
A miracle happened to me.

If the moon turns green and shadows get up and walk around,
And clouds come tumbling to the ground,
I wouldn't be surprised,
'Cause didn't you fall in love with me?
If the stars turn blue and Willows that weep begin to sing,
And winter changes into Spring,
I wouldn't raise my eyes,
'Cause didn't you fall in love with me?
I thought I was foolish to think of romance 
With someone so charming as you,
Thought I was hoping without any chance.
But ev'ry hope came true.

If the moon turns green and rivers begin to flow up stream,
And this is all a crazy dream,
I wouldn't be surprised,
'Cause anything can happen if you can fall in love with me.",If the Moon Turns Green,2014

Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

With those blues on parade

Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,

Like a nightingale without a song to sing

When it isn't even spring?

Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

A winding country lane, all russet brown
A frosty windowpane shows me a town grown lonely
That spring of ours that started, so April-hearted
Seemed made for just a boy and girl

On a cold winter's night that was so deep.

Shining in the the East, beyond them far;
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.

Born is the King of Israel.

Goodnight my love, my moment with you now is ending
It was so heavenly, holding you, close to me
It will be heavenly to hold you again in a dream
The stars above have promised to meet us tomorrow
Till then my love, how dreary the new day will seem
So for the present, dear, we'll have to part
Sleep tight, my love, goodnight, my love
Remember that you're mine sweetheart
 
Goodnight my love, your mommy is kneeling beside you
Goodnight my love, to dreamland the sandman will guide you
Come now you sleepyhead, close your eyes, and go to bed
My precious sleepyhead, you mustn't play peek-a-boo
Goodnight my love, your little Dutch dolly is yawning
Goodnight my love, your teddy bear called it a day
Your doggy's fast asleep, my but he's smart
Sleep tight, my love, goodnight my love

Cause when our friends begin that
Heartless rumor

Sense of humor

Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under

I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!

Because a miracle
Has brought my lover to me
Though she's some other place, her face I see
At night I creep in bed
And never sleep in bed
But look above in the air
And to my greatest joy, my love is there
She dances overhead
On the ceiling near my bed
In my sight
All through the night
I try to hide in vain
Underneath my counterpane
But there's my love
up there above
I whisper, ""Go away, my lover
It's not fair""

That she's still there
I love my ceiling more
Since it is a dancing floor
Just for my love",Dancing on the Ceiling,1960

And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet

With those blues on parade

And the note he sings was this, ah

Poor Johnny, one note
Sang out with, ""Gusto""
And just overlorded the place

Poor Johnny, one note
Yelled willy nilly
Until he was blue in the face

For holding one note was his ace
Couldn't hear the brass
Couldn't hear the drum
He was in a class by himself, by gum

Poor Johnny, one note
Got in Aida
Indeed a great chance to be brave

He took his one note
Howled like the North Wind
Brought forth wind that made critics rave
While Verdi turned 'round in his grave

Couldn't hear the flute
Or the big trombone
Ev'ry one was mute
Johnny stood alone

Cats and dogs stopped yapping
Lions in the zoo, all were jealous of Johnny's big trill
Thunder claps stopped clapping
Traffic ceased its roar

And they tell us Niag'ra stood still
He stopped the train whistles
Boat whistles, steam whistles, cop whistles
All whistles bowed to his skill

That we walked among
Lying in the hay, games we used to play
Wild around the sun only yesterday
When the world was young

While sitting around we often recall
The life of the year, the night of them all
For all of the noise, the talk and the smoke
I'm good for a laugh, a drink or a joke

I walk in a room, a party or ball
There's laughter and lights and wine for us all
And beautiful girls all put to [Incomprehensible]
But often my eyes see a different shine

Ah, the apple trees, silent memories
Wherever [Incomprehensible]

Till the stars were strung only last July

How can I prove to you this love is real?

	The words that fill my heart my lips can't seem to say

Every day remember how I love you so
In your heart believe what in my heart I know

The time when you return and find me here and run

So nice, life would be so nice
If one day I'd find
Someone who would take my hand
And samba through life with me

Someone to cling to me
Stay with me right or wrong

Some little samba song

And give his heart to me

Give love a start with me

I'm goin' away with my friend
We'll Saturday-spend till the end of the day

Just I and my friend
We'll travel for miles in our Saturday smiles
And then we'll move on
But we will remember long after Saturday's gone

You know what the trouble is, the trouble is that probably
All the good things in life take place in no more than a minute
I mean all I did, I, I bet you
At the end of seventy years, should you live so long
You can sit and you can figure the whole thing out

You spent nineteen years sleeping, you spent 5 years going to the bathroom
You spent thirty five years doing some kind of work you absolutely hated
You spent 7,853 minutes blinking your eyes
And added to that you got that one minute of good things
Then one day you wonder whether your minute's up

And then we'll move on
But we will remember long after Saturday's gone

Has left a pool of tears crying for the day
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way
Many times I've been alone and many times I've cried
Anyway you'll never know the many ways I've tried
And still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here, lead me to you door

You go a wondering, wandering 
Stumbling, tumbling, round! round!
When will you find 
What's on the tip of your mind?
Why are you blind 
To all you ever were
Never were, really are, nearly are?
Little boy false in search of little boy true
Will you ever be done traveling
Always unraveling you, you?
Running away could lead you further astray
And as for fishing in streams for pieces of dreams
Those pieces will never fit 
What is the sense of it?

It's time ,come blow your horn, meet the morn
Look and see, can you be far from home?

How could you go and leave so completely?

Just an empty tube of toothpaste
And a half-filled cup of coffee:

At least you could have said goodbye you
Shouldn't have run away!
Were you afraid that I would cry?
My tears might have made you stay.

In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
We're happy tonight,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song,
As we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town.

Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,
The plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
Until the other kids knock him down.

When it snows, ain't it thrilling,
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Walking in a winter wonderland,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Oh, the weather outside is frightful,
But the fire is so delightful,
And since we've no place to go,
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.
It doesn't show signs of stopping,
And I brought some corn for popping;
The lights are turned way down low,
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.
When we finally say good night,
How I'll hate going out in the storm;
But if you really hold me tight,
All the way home I'll be warm.

And, my dear, we're still good-bye-ing,
But as long as you love me so.

Sweet silver bells, 
All seem to say, 
Throw cares away 

Christmas is here,
Bringing good cheer, 
To young and old,
Meek and the bold, 

Oh how they pound, 
Raising the sound, 
O'er hill and dale, 
Telling their tale, 

Gaily they ring 
While people sing 
Songs of good cheer, 
Christmas is here, 

Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas, 
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas, 
On on they send , 
On without end, 
Their joyful tone to every home

Johnny Mathis,"God rest ye merry, gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember, Christ, our Saviour
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

In Bethlehem, in Israel,
This blessed Babe was born
And laid within a manger
Upon this blessed morn
The which His Mother Mary
Did nothing take in scorn
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

From God our Heavenly Father
A blessed Angel came;
And unto certain Shepherds
Brought tidings of the same:
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by Name.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

""Fear not then,"" said the Angel,
""Let nothing you affright,
This day is born a Saviour
Of a pure Virgin bright,
To free all those who trust in Him
From Satan's power and might.""
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind,
And left their flocks a-feeding
In tempest, storm and wind:
And went to Bethlehem straightway
The Son of God to find.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

And when they came to Bethlehem
Where our dear Saviour lay,
They found Him in a manger,
Where oxen feed on hay;
His Mother Mary kneeling down,
Unto the Lord did pray.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

Now to the Lord sing praises,
All you within this place,
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace;
This holy tide of Christmas
All other doth deface.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

Johnny Mathis,"Sitting in a railway station
With my suitcase in my hand
Going back where I came from
I've had more than I can stand
Of watching them destroy my dreams
They picked my brain till it was clean
When I was up they knocked me down
I ain't going to hand around, I'm going home

I'm going home, going home
Tell someone to meet me I'm coming home

Came to this old town seeking fortune and some fame
Never got the chance to prove myself,
Though I tried to play their game
But using people just ain't my thing
And won't dangle from any string
To please some fool that don't care about
They turned me inside out, I'm going home

All the things you really feel

That you will open up, let it in

You keep within, so jump on in

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by

Sometimes I wonder why I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is
In the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall
When stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairy tale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it always will remain

I've loved you all along
Ah, now we're leavin' yesterday behind
We'll never be alone, we're friends in love

That's what I'm gonna do
Why did you have to decide
You had to set me free
I'm gonna swallow my pride
I'm gonna beg you to (please baby please) see me
I'm gonna walk by meself
Just to prove that my love is true
Oh, for you baby

That our love is dying

And who's the one you're clinging to
Instead of me tonight?

And where are you now? Now that I need you
Tears on my pillow, wherever you go
I cry me a river that leads to your ocean
You never see me fall apart

In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion that's taken me over
Tied up in sorrow, lost in my soul

And if you don't come back, come home to me, darling
You know that there'll be nobody else in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

I'm there at your side
I'm a part of all the things you are
But you've got a part of someone else
You've got to find your shining star

And where are you now? Now that I need you

And sometimes all the night can be so long
And it's good when I finally make it home, all alone
While she lays dreaming, I try to get undressed without the light
And quietly she says how was your night?
And I come to her and say, it was all right, and I hold her tight

And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I will find a way, find a way

While she lays waiting, I stumble to the kitchen for a bite
Then I see my old guitar in the night
Just waiting for me like a secret friend, and there's no end
While she lays crying, I fumble with a melody or two
And I'm torn between the things that I should do
And she says to wake her up when I am through
God her love is true

But when I ask will you be coming back soon
You don't know, never know 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye 
Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason with your heart 
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts your keeping
You just say nothing's changed 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye, goodbye

Johnny Mathis,"I've been lookin' at people
And how they change with the times
And lately, all I've been seein' are people
Throwin' love away and losing their minds

Maybe it's me who's gone crazy
'Cause I can't understand why
All these lovers keep hurtin' each other
When love is so hard to come by

So what's the glory in living?
Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore?
And if love never lasts forever
Tell me what's forever for?

I've been listenin' to people
And they say love is the key
And it's not my way to let them lead me astray
It's only that I want to believe

I see love hungry people
Tryin' their best to survive
While in their hands is a dying romance
And they're not even tryin' to keep it alive

So what's the glory in living?
Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore?
And if love never lasts forever
Tell me what's forever for?

A tiny star lights up way up high
All across the land, dawns a brand new morn
This comes to pass when a child is born

A silent wish sails the seven seas
The winds of change whisper in the trees
And the walls of doubt crumble, tossed and torn
This comes to pass when a child is born

A rosy hue settles all around
You've got the feel you're on solid ground
For a spell or two, no one seems forlorn
This comes to pass when a child is born

And all of this happens because the world is waiting,
Waiting for one child
Black, white, yellow, no one knows
But a child that will grow up and turn tears to laughter,
Hate to love, war to peace and everyone to everyone's neighbor
And misery and suffering will be words to be forgotten, forever

It must come true, sometime soon somehow
All across the land, dawns a brand new morn

Her ups, her downs

Like breathing out and breathing in

I was serenely independent and content before we met
Surely I could always be that way again and yet
I've grown accustomed to her look
Accustomed to her voice, accustomed to her face

The trembling trees embraced the breeze tenderly

You took my lips, you took my love so tenderly

Darling your eyes are asking, ""Will the flame burn out?""

I'll be tired of you  when stars are tired of gleaming
When I am tired of dreaming, then I'll be tired of  you.

When grass is tired of growing, then I'll be tired  of you.

Where hearts were entertaining June, 
We stood beneath an amber moon 
And softly murmured ""someday soon.""

Recalling thrills of our love,

Return I will to old Brazil.

When the snow comes to cover the ground.
It's the time for play, it's a whipped cream day,

That's how it goes, whenever it snows.

In winter it's a marshmallow world!

Johnny Mathis,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

If I'm not feeling any less sour

And visit a nearby tower
And climbing to the top will throw myself off

Where people saying : ""My God, that's tough""
""She stood him up""

The role I was about to play?

Reality came around
And without so much as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces
Leaving me to doubt
Talk about God in His mercy
Who if He really does exist
Why did He desert me?
In my hour of need
I truly am indeed
Alone again, naturally

It seems to me that there are more hearts
Broken in the world that can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do?  What do we do?

Alone again, naturally

Looking back over the years
And whatever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears
And at sixty-five years old
My mother, God rest her soul
Couldn't understand why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken
Leaving her to start with a heart so badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken
And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day

Then they must hold each other tight, oh, so very tight
And take a chance that in the light, in tomorrow's light
They'll stay together, so much in love

And in the silence of a mist, of a morning mist
When lips are waiting to be kissed, longing to be kissed
Where is the reason to resist and deny a kiss
That holds a promise of happiness?

Though yesterday still surrounds you with a warm and precious memory
Maybe for tomorrow we can build a new dream for you and me
This glow we feel is something rare, something really rare
So come and say you want to share, want to really share

The beauty waiting for us there, calling for us there
That only loving can give the heart
When life is passing in the night, in the rushing night
A man, a woman in the night, in the lonely night

Must take a chance that in the light, in tomorrow's light
They'll be together, so much in love
Together, so much in love

It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory evergreen.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing 
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""
And we suddenly know, what heaven we're in,

Can lead an unsuspecting heart on a merry chase
A fleeting glance can say so many lovely things

Comes that certain smile to haunt your heart again

Not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone
In the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan 

Memory
All alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days
I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again 

Every streetlamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters
And the streetlamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I musn't give in
When the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin 

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The streetlamp dies, another night is over

From angels bending near the earth to touch their harps of gold
Peace on the earth, goodwill to men, from heav'n's all gracious king
The world in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels sing.

Still through the cloven skies they come with peaceful wings unfurl
And still their heavenly music floats, O'er all the weary world.
Above its sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wing
And ever o'er its Babel sounds the blessed angels sing.

O ye, beneath life's crushing load, whose forms are bending low
Who toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slow
Look now for glad and golden hours come swiftly on the wing
O rest beside the weary road and hear the angels sing.

For lo the days are hastening on, by prophets seen of old
When with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold
When the new heaven and earth shall own the prince of peace their King
And the whole world send back the song which now the angels sing.

Johnny Mathis,"Love soft as an easy chair
Love fresh as the morning air
One love that is shared by two
I have found with you

Like a rose under the April snow
I was always certain love would grow
Love ageless and evergreen
Seldom seen by two

You and I will make each night a first
Every day a beginning
Spirits rise and their dance is unrehearsed
They warm and excite us, cause we have the brightest love

Two lives that shine as one
Morning glory and midnight sun

Time wont change the meaning of one love

She doesn't wanna lead him on

For her to make up her mind
Is it all over already
Or could it be love this time?

It's just another injured heart
He's had it broken in the past
He didn't mean to fall so hard
And he certainly didn't mean to fall so fast

There's so many reasons that he should forget her
But he can't get her out of his mind
Is it all over already
Or could it be love this time?

I gotta have an answer, I need to know the truth
Am I still the joker? Am I still the fool?
Will I get the chance to share this love?
Will she ever love me too?

She doesn't wanna say for sure
She doesn't wanna tell the no
She doesn't wanna make him wait anymore
She doesn't wanna let him go
He just wants to know if he'll hold her forever

Hearing the sound of your voice, I just have to stop and smile

Who needs the world when you here with me
No one in the world, no one in my life could take your place
Everyday there's someone in the world
Making even hard times easy like no one in the world

In the night comes in the heart of love the dark
Listening to the sweet eternal music of your heart
I wish we had more than one life
I'd spend them all with you

Everyday I'd find another reason to be the last

Do we just turn the page and let the story end?
Do we just walk away?
Just like we never meant

I know we said some things
And now you want to leave
But baby that's no reason
To let a good love die

Why goodbye?
Why must it be this way?
So many words, so many other words
That we could say

Why goodbye
After all this time?
Can't we try?
Why goodbye?

Why can't we work it out?
Why can't we talk it out a little more this time?
Search though the rain and find
A ray of hope still shines

We can't just close the door
We're still worth fighting for

To leave it all behind

You'll get lost along the way

We can make it to the good times
Through the stormy weather 'cause we belong together

And start to cheer and the cheer start to swell
If you like to taking a bow then you got to know how
To ring the bell

Dreams that dwell in the back of your eyes
They'll materialize if you get up and get out of your shell
You can't depend upon bait for your height and your weight
To ring the bell

There's a grindstone for your nose
There's a treetop for your toes
Don't stay home and decompose
Just get out and get going where a go getter goes

Who can tell if you missed a few meals?
If you're down at the heels put on a well to do smile
And you'll do well
Don't hide your head in a truck just come up, all up
And ring the bell

And it's like I always say
Don't do anything halfway
There's a time for work and play
Don't put off tomorrow what you could do today

Ring the bell [Incomprehensible]
Why it's simply absurd how much a wide awake crook can compel
When it's the time to get up, that's the time to get up
When it's the time to get up, that's the time to get up
And ring, and ring, and ring the bell

In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
We're happy tonight,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song,
As we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, ""Are you married?""
We'll say, ""No man""
But you can do the job when you're in town.

Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,
The plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Over the ground lies a mantle of white
A heaven of diamonds shine down through the night
Two hearts are thrillin'
In spite of the chill in the weather

Love knows no season, love knows no clime
Romance can blossom any old time
Here in the open
We're walkin' and hopin' together
Together, together, together

Sleigh bells ring, are you listening,
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
We're happy tonight,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is a new bird

As we go along,

And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
Until the other kiddies knock him down.

Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,

Johnny Mathis,"A ray of hope flickers in the sky
A tiny star lights up way up high
All across the land, dawns a brand new morn
This comes to pass when a child is born

A silent wish sails the seven seas
The winds of change whisper in the trees
And the walls of doubt crumble, tossed and torn
This comes to pass when a child is born

A rosy hue settles all around
You've got the feel you're on solid ground
For a spell or two, no one seems forlorn
This comes to pass when a child is born

And all of this happens because the world is waiting,
Waiting for one child
Black, white, yellow, no one knows
But a child that will grow up and turn tears to laughter,
Hate to love, war to peace and everyone to everyone's neighbor
And misery and suffering will be words to be forgotten, forever

It's all a dream, an illusion now
It must come true, sometime soon somehow
All across the land, dawns a brand new morn
This comes to pass when a child is born",When a Child Is Born [Soleado],1997

You're calmer than the seals in the Arctic Ocean

Johnny Mathis,"This town is full of guys who think they're mighty wise,
Just because they know a thing or two.
You can see them every day, strolling up and down Broadway,
Telling of the wonders they can do.
You'll see wise guys and boosters,
Card sharps and crap shooters,
They congregate around the Metropole.
They wear those flashy ties and collars,
But where they get their dollars,
They've all got an ace down in the hole.

Some of them write to the old folks for coin,
That's their ace in the hole.
Others have girls on that old tenderloin,
That's their ace in the hole.

They'll tell you of trips they are going to take,
From Frisco up to the North Pole.
But they'd end up on that line, in their clothes not a dime,
If they lost that old ace in the hole.

Wherever you might stray, along the Great White Way,
They'll corner you and start in telling lies.
Of oil wells in Nebraska and gold mines in Alaska,
You'll be immersed in bullshit to your eyes.
But every hustler knows
Bullshit buys no clothes
And only cold cash keeps you off the dole.
So some of them wash dishes,
And some of them are snitches,
But all of them have aces in the hole.

Drifters who dwell on that slippery slope,
Grifters who jump their parole,
Trying to sell bags of catnip for dope,
That's their ace in the hole.

They'll tell you of money they've made and they've spent
And flash a Missouri bankroll.
But their names would be mud,
Like a chump dealing stud
If they lost that old ace in the hole.",Ace in the Hole,1998
Johnny Mathis,"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Memories may be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember

For all the truth that you made me see
For all the joy you brought to my life
For all the wrong that you made right

For every dream you made come true
For all the love I found in you, I'll be forever thankful, baby
You're the one who held me up, never let me fall
You're the one who saw me through, through it all

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me

Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith, 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am because you loved me

You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand, I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach

You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love, I had it all
I'm grateful for each day you gave me

Maybe I don't know that much
But I know this much is true
I was blessed because I was loved by you

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me

Lifted me up when I couldn't reach

A light in the dark, shining your love into my life

Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

Johnny Mathis,"Said the night wind to the little lamb,
Do you see what I see?
Way up in the sky, little lamb,
Do you see what I see?
A star, a star, dancing in the night
With a tail as big as a kite,
With a tail as big as a kite.

Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy,
Do you hear what I hear?
Ringing through the sky, shepherd boy,
Do you hear what I hear?
A song, a song high above the trees
With a voice as big as the sea,
With a voice as big as the sea.

Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king,
Do you know what I know?
In your palace warm, mighty king,
Do you know what I know?
A Child, a Child shivers in the cold
Let us bring him silver and gold,
Let us bring him silver and gold.

Said the king to the people everywhere,
Listen to what I say!
Pray for peace, people, everywhere,
Listen to what I say!
The Child, the Child sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light,
He will bring us goodness and light.",Do You Hear What I Hear,2000
Johnny Mathis,"No more talk of darkness
Forget these wide-eyed fears
I'm here, nothing can harm you
My words will warm and calm you

Let me be your freedom
Let daylight dry your tears
I'm here, with you, beside you
To guard you and to guide you

Then say you love me every winter morning
Turn my head with talk of summertime
Say you need me with you, now and always
Promise me that all you say is true
That's all I ask of you

Let me be your shelter
Let me be your light
You're safe no one will find you
Your fears are far behind you

All we need is freedom
A world that's warm and bright
And you always beside me
To hold me and to hide me

Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime
Let me lead you from your solitude
Say you need me with you here, beside you
Anywhere you go, let me go too
That's all I ask of you

Say the word and I will follow you
Share each day with me, each night, each morning
Say you feel the way I do
That's all I ask of you

Love me that's all I ask of you",All I Ask of You [From Phantom of the Opera],2000
Johnny Mathis,"How do you say to your child in the night
Nothing is all black but then nothing is all white?
How do you say it will all be alright
When you know that it mightn't be true?
What do you do?

Careful the things you say
Children will listen
Careful the things you do
Children will see
And learn
Children may not obey
But children will listen
Children will look to you
For which way to turn
To learn what to be
Careful before you say
""Listen to me""
Children will listen

Careful the wish you make
Wishes are children
Careful the path they take
Wishes come true
Not free
Careful the spell you cast
Not just on children
Sometimes the spell may last
Past what you can see
And turn against you

Careful the tale you tell
That is the spell
Children will listen

How can you say to a child who's in flight
Don't slip away and I won't hold so tight?
What can you say that no matter how slight won't be misunderstood?
What do you leave to your child when you're dead
Only what ever you put in its head
Things that your mother and father had said
Which were left to them too
Careful what you say, children will listen
Careful you do it too, children will see and learn, oh

Guide them but step away
Children will glisten
Temper with what is true
And children will turn
If just to be free
Careful before you say
""Listen to me""
Children will listen
Children will listen
Children, children will listen",Children Will Listen/Our Children,2000
Johnny Mathis,"Life is just a bowl of cherries
Don't take it serious
Life's too mysterious

You work, you save, you worry so
But you can't take your dough
When you go, go, go

Keep repeating, it's the berries
The strongest oak must fall
The best things in life to you were just loaned
So how can you lose what you never owned

Life is just a bowl of cherries
So live and laugh at it all

Keep repeating, it's the berries
You know the strongest oak has got to fall
The sweet things in life to you were just loaned
So how can you lose what you never owned

So live it, love it, wriggle your ears

It's who I am

It's not much reason to rejoice

Johnny Mathis,"They say the neon lights are bright
On Broadway 
They say there's always magic in the air 
But when you're walkin' down that street
And you ain't have enough to eat
The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere

They say the women treat you fine
On Broadway 
But lookin' at them just gives me the blues 
How ya gonna make some time
When all you got is one thin dime
And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes
 
They say that I won't last too long

But they wouldn't hurt you, not much

With his own little personal touch
 
Do nothin' till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said

Is over my head

I haven't a chance
True I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue

Reveal how I feel about you

And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear it from me

Though I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you

Johnny Mathis,"I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come what may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life...
From jazz and cocktails.


The girls THERE had sad and sullen gray faces
With distengue traces
That used to be there you could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day...
Twelve o'clock tales.


Then you came along with your siren of song
To tempt me to madness!
I thought for a while that your poignant smile was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me.


Ah yes! I was wrong...
Again,
I was wrong.


Life is lonely again,
And only last year everything seemed so sure.
Now life is awful again,
A troughful of hearts could only be a bore.
A week in Paris will ease the bite of it,
All I care is to smile in spite of it.


I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still burning inside my brain.
Romance is mush,
Stifling those who strive.
I'll live a lush life in some small dive...
And there I'll be, while I rot
With the rest of those whose lives are lonely, too",Lush Life,2000

You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

I sit in my chair
And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love

Now that you've gone from my heart
That was my fear for you were my future
There was no reason to part

Still I hope you'll change your mind
And that somehow you will find
You were meant to be my only
I'll be lost if I'm alone

I know you remember all that you told me
Times when you'd hold me so tight
How could you grieve me, how could you leave me
Knowing your love is my light

In your heart there should be thoughts
That you'll return to me
I will be happy, patiently waiting
Knowing then just why I am here

What am I here for living in misery
Now that you've gone from my heart
That was my fear for you were my future

Jack Frost nipping at your nose

And every mother's child is going to be spy
To see reindeer really know how to fly
