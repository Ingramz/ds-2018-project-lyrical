Sy Oliver,"Give me a kiss to build a dream on
And my imagination will thrive upon that kiss
Sweetheart, I ask no more than this
A kiss to build a dream on

Give me a kiss before you leave me
And my imagination will feed my hungry heart
Leave me one thing before we part
A kiss to build a dream on

And when I'm alone with my fancies, I'll be with you
Weaving romances, making believe they're true

Oh, give me your lips for just a moment
And my imagination will make that moment live
Give me what you alone can give
A kiss to build a dream on

When I'm alone with my fancies, I'll be with you
Weaving romances, making believe they're true

Oh, give me lips for just a moment
And my imagination will make that moment live
Oh, give me what you alone can give
A kiss to build a dream on",A  Kiss to Build a Dream On [Single Version],1952
Sy Oliver,"The story of Shadrack, Meshach, and Abednego
There was three children from the land of Israel
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
They took a little trip to the land of Babylon
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
Nebudchanezzer was the king of Babylon
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
He took a lot of gold, and made an idol
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego

And he told everybody ""when you hear the music of the trombone""
And he told everybody ""when you hear the music of the clarinet""
And he told everybody ""when you hear the music of the horn
You must fall down and worship the idol""
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego

But the children of Israel would not bow down
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
Couldn't fool 'em with a golden idol
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
I said, you couldn't fool 'em with a golden idol
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego

So the king put the children in the fiery furnace
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
Heaped on coals and red-hot brimstone
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
Eleven times hotter, hotter than it ought to be
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
Burned up the soldiers that the king had put there
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego

But the Lord sent an angel with the snow-white wings
Down in the middle of the furnace
Talkin' to the children 'bout the power of the Gospel
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego

Well, they couldn't burn a hair on the head of
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
Laughin' and talkin' while the fire jumpin' 'round
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego

Old Nebudchanezzer called, ""hey there!""
When he saw the power of the Lord
And they had a regal time in the house of Babylon
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
Oh, Abednego",Shadrack,1958
Sy Oliver,"Won't you come along with me
To the Mississippi
We'll take a boat to the land of dreams
Steam down the river, down to New Orleans

The band's there to meet us
Old friends there to greet us
Where all the proud and elite folks meet
Heaven on earth, they call it Basin Street

Basin Street is the street
Where the best folks always meet
In New Orleans, land of dreams
You'll never know how nice it seems
Or just how much it really means

Glad to be, oh yes-sire
Where welcome's free and dear to me
Where I can lose, lose my Basin Street Blues

Basin Street, oh Basin Street
Is the street, mama (scat)
New Orleans, land of dreams",Basin Street Blues,1990

Oh, take a trip to Africa
Take any ship to Africa

Beside a jungle bungalow

Sy Oliver,"I try to think that love's not around
But it's uncomfortably near
My old heart ain't gaining no ground
Because my angel eyes ain't here

Angel eyes, that old devil sent
They glow unbearably bright
Need I say that my love's misspent
Misspent with angel eyes tonight

So drink up all you people
Order anything you see
Have fun you happy people
The laughs and the jokes on me

Sy Oliver,"Stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper ""I love you""
Birds singing in the sycamore trees
Dream a little dream of me

Say nighty-night and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading but I linger on dear

Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be

Sy Oliver,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Lullaby of Birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",Lullaby of Birdland,1995
Sy Oliver,"The concert was over in Carnagie Hall
The maestro took bow after bow
He said, â??My dear friends I have given my all.
I'm sorry, it's all over now.â??
When from the balcony way up high
There suddenly came a mournful cry

Oh, Mr. Paganini
Please play my rhapsody
And if you cannot play it won't you sing it?
And if you can't sing you simply have to
Scat

Listen Paganini,
We breathlessly await your masterful dtente
Go on and sling it
And if you can't sling it you simply have to
Scat

We heard your repertoire
And at the final bar
We greeted you with wild applause
But what a great ovation
Your interpretation of:
â??I never cared much for moonlight skies
I never blinked back at fireflies'
Would do

So, Paganini don't you be a meanie
What have you up your sleeve?
Come on and spring it
And if you can't spring it, you simply have to
Scat

Listen Paganini, please play my rhapsody
And if you cannot play it, wont you sing it?
If the boys is bopping
Aint no need in stopping

Sy Oliver,"I used to have a perfect sweetheart
Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'
And dream I'm dreamin'

Taught me to be true
She meant me for someone
Exactly like you",Exactly Like You,1996
Sy Oliver,"My mama done told me when I was in knee-pants
My mama done told me, she said Son
A woman will sweet-talk ya, she'll give you the big eye
But when that sweet talkin' is done

A woman's a two-face, a worrisome thing
Who'll leave ya to sing the blues in the night
Now the rain's a fallin', hear the train a callin', oooo-ee
Hear the lonesome whistle blowin' 'cross the trestle, oooo-ee

Oooo-ee-a-oooo-ee, ol' clickety-clack
Comes echoing back the blues in the night
The evening breeze will start the trees to cryin'
And the moonlight will hide its light

When you get the blues in the night
Take my word, the mockingbird
He will sing the saddest kind of song
He knows things are wrong and he's right

From Natchez to Mobile
From Memphis to St. Joe
Wherever the four winds seem to blow
I've been in some big towns and I've heard me some big talkin'

But there is one thing I know
A woman's a two-face
She's a worrisome thing
Who'll leave you to sing the blues in the night

Don't know what to do

It's all because of you

You try to make a flash

It sure makes me mad to wait

To raise just one eyelash

A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely.

Seemed made for just a boy and girl.

I'd let the old Earth make a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

Oh, it's a long long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
And you ain't got time for waiting game

When days dwindle down to a precious few
September November,
And these few golden days I'd share with you
Those golden days I share with you

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song [From Knickerbocker Holiday],2006

That's how I'd cry in my pillow

Nigga give way, give up, you never get a glimpse
Of the glimmer man, glimmer glitter when I trek your body shiver

Of Hugh Jack, hands packin', make you an 'X-man'
Time for some action and matter of fact
Go exercise or be ordained to explore pain

And explain, why you puttin' extras on
In this excess I throw a hex through your headset
Settle down 'fore I set it off on your set
Let's say Santiago is the best you heard yet

I know, my flow, oh my God, get so heated

Ask G's if I G, hit the G spot on your queen

When one restless summer we found love growing wild
On the banks of the river on a well beaten path

And my biggest fear was September when he had to go
A few cards and letters and one long distance call
We drifted away like the leaves in the fall
But year after year I come back to this place
Just to remember the taste
Of strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet

Years since they've seen the plow
There's nothing time hasn't touched

Open a door for me, what would it hurt

Set 'em up my friends
Then I'll be gone
Then you can let some other fool sit down

I'd like for you to listen to a joke I heard today
From a woman who said she was through and calmly walked away
I tried to smile and did a while but it felt so outta place
Did you ever hear of a clown with tears drops streaming down his face.

I think I'll have another round
Set 'em up my friend
Then I'll be gone and you can let some other fool sit down.

'Cause a row of fools on a row of stools is not what's on my mind

We were a half mile high on the Ferris wheel
At our old county fair
I didn't even know we had trouble until
She told me way up there
That's when my life started spinning round
My world came crashing to the ground

In a Chevy in a hurry in the pouring down rain
With the caution lights flashing in the passing lane
From a bridge I watched our dreams goin' down the drain
In a Chevy in a hurry in the pouring down rain

No she wasn't showing yet but she'd be by Christmas time
Up there like a fool I took for granted it was mine.
She never came out and told me that I was wrong
But all of a sudden the light came on

In a Chevy in a hurry in the pouring down rain
With the caution lights flashing in the passing lane
From a bridge I watched our dreams goin' down the drain

I can't even think of things to do
Wishin' all of my daydreams come true
Now, baby, what am I to do?

I think about yesterday
Somebody was talkin' to me
But I couldn't understand a word they said
Not that I was tryin' to be rude
But conversation couldn't make it through
The thoughts of love I had for you

Baby your face takes up my time
Because I can jus' see your face with mine
I try to change my thoughts; it's a waste of time
You keep my mind occupied

Tell me what am I to do?

Doin' ya singin' thing the charts sewed up now
Well you know I do my rap thing, I'm holdin' it down
And I knew that me and you was gon' connect some how
Your people called for this track, it ain't no trouble to me
I dreamt that you and me got married on the WB
You on channel 11; I carry the M-11
RJ the reverened; it's a match made in heaven
Whatever have you I let you know
I'm from soundview
Down til I found you
I'm tryin' to be around you
I'm still comin' up
Chasin' the fame and wealth
I could spoil you with time; you got everything else

I'm still New York to the heart
But got love for all
When I first saw this girl
Thought I wanted to fall
Mean the hummer so stunnin'
That my bod was tense
And I wishin everyday that I was fresh like Prince
Then I came across my man RJ parlayin' in a 6
With Tatyana Ali playin'
I heard Steely Dan ""Black Cow"" and went wild
You tell me how can I get down
That's when they threw me on the redeye to LA
I dirtied my cash and peeps back
And hit Shaq on the cellay
Courtside seats so close that we could touch

Sybersound,"VERSE 1
On a warm summers evening, on a train bound for nowhere, I met up with a gambler we were both too tired to sleep. So we took turns at staring out the window at the darkness, till boredom over took us and he began to speak, He sais ""Son I've made a life outta reading peoples faces. Knowing what the cards were byt he way they held their eyes. So if you don't mind me sayin I can see your outta aces for ataste of your whisky I'll give you some advice.""
So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow, then he bombed a cigarette and asked me for a light. And the night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expresion said If your gonna play the game boy you gotta learn to play it right.

CHORUS:
You gotta know when to hold them,
Know when to fold them,
Know when to walk away, know when to run.
You never count your money when your sitting at the table,
There'll be time enough for counting when the dealings done.

VERSE 2
Every gambler knows that the secret to survival is knowing what to throw away and knowing what to keep.
Cause every hands a winner and every hands a loser and the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep.
And when he finished speaking he turned back towards the window, crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep. 
And somewhere inthe darkness the gambler he broke even. And in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.

The way things work themselves out 
And all emotional 
Once you know what it's all about, hey

For us to be apart 
I never would have made it very far 
'Cause you know you've got the keys to my heart

Say farewell to the dark of night

With no vivid reason here to find
Yet the thought of losing you's been hanging 'round my mind 
Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
With you say no special place to go

You don't know, never know

Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye 
Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason with your heart 
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts your keeping
You just say nothing's changed 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes

I see you driving, sports cars, ain't hitting the throttle
And I'll be down to do a hundred, top down and goggles
Get off the freeway, exit 106 and ""Park""ed it

Gucci collar for dollar, got out and walked it
I spit game cause baby I can't talk it
Warm, sweating, it's hot up in this joint
Vokal tank top, on at this point
You with a winner so baby you can't loose
I got secrets can't leave Cancun

Sybersound,"It seems like yesterday
But it was long ago
Janey was lovely she was the queen of my nights
There in the darkness with the radio playing low
And the secrets that we shared
The mountains that we moved
Caught like a wildfire out of control
'Til there was nothing left to burn and nothing left to prove
And I remember what she said to me
How she swore that it never would end
I remember how she held me oh so tight
Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then

Against the wind
We were runnin' against the wind
We were young and strong, we were runnin'
Against the wind

The years rolled slowly past
And I found myself alone
Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends
I found myself further and further from my home
And I guess I lost my way
There were oh so many roads
I was living to run and running to live
Never worryied about paying or even how much I owed
Moving eight miles a minute for months at a time
Breaking all of the rules that would bend
I began to find myself searching
Searching for shelter again and again

Against the wind
A little something against the wind
I found myself seeking shelter sgainst the wind

Well those drifter's days are past me now
I've got so much more to think about
Deadlines and commitments
What to leave in, what to leave out

Against the wind
I'm still runnin' against the wind
I'm older now but still runnin' against the wind
Well I'm older now and still runnin'
Against the wind
Against the wind
Against the wind

Still runnin'
I'm still runnin' against the wind
I'm still runnin'
I'm still runnin' against the wind
Still runnin'
Runnin' against the wind
Runnin' against the wind
See the young man run
Watch the young man run
Watch the young man runnin'
He'll be runnin' against the wind
Let the cowboys ride
Let the cowboys ride
They'll be ridin' against the wind
Against the wind ...",Against the Wind,2003

And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say - not in a shy way
No, oh no not me
I did it my way

For what is a man, what has he got
If not himself, then he has naught

And not the words of one who kneels

Or workin' on some stage in L.A.?

Risin' against that blue sky?
Did you shout out in anger, in fear for your neighbor,
Or did you just sit down and cry?

Did you weep for the children, they lost their dear loved ones,
Pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?
Did you burst out in pride for the red, white, and blue
And heroes who died just doin' what they do?

Close your eyes and not go to sleep?

And speak to some stranger on the street?
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow,
Go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watchin'
And turn on """"I Love Lucy"""" reruns?

Stand in line to give your own blood?
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your fam'ly,

Way back up in the woods among the evergreens

Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by they would stop and say
Oh my that little country boy could play

And you will be the leader of a big old band.
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight.""

Sybersound,"At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along
And so you're back
From outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock, I should have made you leave your key
If I'd known for just one second you'd be back to bother me
Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
Do you think I'd crumble
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
And I've got all my love to give and I'll survive
I will survive, hey, hey

It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
Kept trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh-so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry
But now I hold my head up high and you see me
Somebody new
I'm not that chained-up little person and still in love with you
And so you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free
Well, now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's loving me
Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye

There's somethin' wrong here, there can be no denyin'
One of us is changin', or maybe we've just stopped tryin'

I was playin' soft while Bobby sang the blues, yeah

We sang every song that driver knew

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin', don't mean nothin' hon' if it ain't free, no no
And, feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues
You know, feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGhee

From the Kentucky coal mine to the California sun
There Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, through everything we done
Yeah, Bobby baby kept me from the cold

One day up near Salinas, Lord, I let him slip away
He's lookin' for that home, and I hope he finds it
But, I'd trade all of my tomorrows, for a single yesterday
To be holdin' Bobby's body next to mine

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose

Pulling kids out the ground

It seemed that we would lose the race

When I'm faced with the knowledge
That you just don't love me
Did you think I would curse you
Or say things to hurt you
'Cause you just don't love me no more

Did you think I could hate you
Or raise my hands to you
Now come on you know me too well
How could I hurt you
When darling I love you
And you know I'd never, never hurt you

What do you think
I would give at this moment
If you stay I'd subtract twenty years from my life
I'd fall down on my knees
Kiss the ground that you walk on
If I could just hold you again

And I'd fall down on my knees
I kiss the ground that you walk on baby
If I could just hold you
If I could just hold you
If I could just hold you

Her hands are never cold

She's pure as New York snow
She got Bette Davis eyes

And she'll tease you, she'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's precocious, and she knows just what it
Takes to make a pro blush
She got Greta Garbo's standoff sighs, she's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll let you take her home
It whets her appetite
She'll lay you on the throne

She'll take a tumble on you
Roll you like you were dice
Until you come out blue

She'll expose you, when she snows you
Off your feet with the crumbs, she throws you
She's ferocious and she knows just what it

As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes
Calls to mind the silver screen
And all its sad good-byes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know your not a fool

Should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you'll find

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know your not a fool

I should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Never without your love

Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say

We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But no one's gonna dance with me
Please stay

And I'm never gonna dance again

Sybersound,"I was tired of my lady, we´d been together too long
Like a worn-out recording, of a favorite song
So while she lay there sleeping, I read the paper in bed
And in the personals column, there was this letter I read

""If you like Piña Coladas, and getting caught in the rain
If you´re not into yoga, if you have half a brain
If you like making love at midnight, in the dunes of the cape
I´m the love that you´ve looked for, write to me, and escape""

I didn´t think about my lady, I know that sounds kind of mean
But me and my old lady, had fallen into the same old dull routine
So I wrote to the paper, took out a personal ad
And though I´m nobody´s poet, I thought it wasn´t half bad

""Yes, I like Piña Coladas, and getting caught in the rain
I´m not much into health food, I am into champagne
I´ve got to meet you by tomorrow noon, and cut through all this red tape
At a bar called O'Malley's, where we´ll plan our escape""

So I waited with high hopes, then she walked in the place
I knew her smile in an instant, I knew the curve of her face
It was my own lovely lady, and she said, ""Oh, it´s you""
And we laughed for a moment, and I said, ""I never knew""

""That you liked Piña Coladas, and getting caught in the rain
And the feel of the ocean, and the taste of champagne
If you like making love at midnight, in the dunes of the cape
You´re the lady that I´ve looked for, come with me, and escape""

Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be

Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow
If I fail, if I succeed 
At least I lived as I believe 
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all inside of me
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself, it is the greatest love of all

Face to face in secret places, feel the chill
Night fall covers me, but you know the plans I'm making
Still oversea, could it be the whole world opening wide
A sacred why, a mystery gaping inside
The weekend's why

Until we dance into the fire, that fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire, to fatal sounds of broken dreams
Dance into the fire, that fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire

Choice for you, is the view to a kill
Between the shades, assassination's standing still
The first crystal tears, fall as snowflakes on your body
First time in years, to drench you skin with lovers rosy stain
A chance to find the phoenix for the flame
A chance to die

But can we dance into the fire, that fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire, to fatal sounds of broken dreams
Dance into the fire, that fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire, when all we see is the view to a kill",Rio [Instrumental],2008

'Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble

To bring my life to anew

Have dried the tears from my eyes

Is for the folk who can't cope
Wit such an endurin' pain
That it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain

For tootin' caine in your own vein
What a shame
You shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane
And name this day in time
For fallin prey to crime

In hopes of comin' true

Sybersound,"I can't imagine, any greater fear
Then waken up, with out you near
And though the sun, will still shine on
My whole world, would all be gone
But not for long

If I had to run
If I had to crawl
If I had to swim a hundred rivers
Just to climb a thousand walls
Always know that I would find a way
To get to where you are
There's no place that far

It wouldn't matter, why we're apart
The lonely miles, two stubborn hearts
And nothing short, of God above
Could turn me away, from your love
I need you that much

If I had to run
If I had to crawl
If I had to swim a hundred rivers
Just to climb a thousand walls
Always know that I would find a way
To get to where you are
There's no place that far

Oh if I had to run
(If I had to run)
Of I had to crawl
(If I had to crawl)
If I had to swim a hundred rivers
Just to climb a thousand walls
Always know that I would find a way
To get to where you are
There's no place that far
Baby there's no place that far",No Place That Far,2009
Sybersound,"Should have been different but
It wasn't different, was it
Same old story, dear John, and so long
Should have fit like a glove
Should have fit like a ring
Like a diamond ring
A token of true love
Should have all worked out
But it didn't
She should be here now
But she isn't

[Chorus]
There's your trouble, there's your trouble
You keep seeing double with the wrong one
You can't see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holding on
There's your trouble

So now you're thinking 'bout
All you're missing how
Deep you're sinking, round and round and dragging down
Why don't you cash in your chips
Why don't you call it a loss
Not such a big loss, chalk it up to better luck
Could have been true love
But it wasn't
It should all add up
But it doesn't

There's your trouble, there's your trouble
You keep seeing double with the wrong one
You can't see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holding on
There's your trouble

Should have all worked out
But it didn't
She should be here now
But she isn't

There's your trouble, there's your trouble
You keep seeing double with the wrong one
And you can't see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holding on
There's your trouble
There's your trouble
There's your trouble
There's your trouble, there is your trouble",There's Your Trouble,2009
Sybersound,"He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said: ""That's a lie.""
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On back roads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer had gone

[Chorus]
But when you think ""Tim McGraw""
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think ""that little black dress""
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

[Chorus]

And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read

Is when you think ""Tim McGraw""
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place
When you think happiness
I hope you think ""that little black dress""
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

Oh, think of me

Try to dis my girl Salt, up goes my guard
Still feminine, feminine still, yes
But then next pump a hundred weight bench press
So what it mean, Pep? I'm not impressed
'Cause I wear the pants, and you wear the dress
Punk, you're lovin' stunk, you're not a hunk
This is independent funk

And I'm gettin' ready for the year 2000
Independent, yes, I'm housin'
Independent, yeah, now watch me
Independent, no one can stop me

Woman and I am independent
I make my own money so don't tell me how to spend it
'Cause you need me, and I don't need you
So listen close, boy, to my independent funk
Yeah, can you feel it?
Yes, it's my, it's my independent funk

(Yawn) You're sleepy, go to bed
Want to step? Go ahead and jet
Now wake up from your dreamin' 'cause you're dealin' with the Pep
Like Oakley from the Knicks, yes, I'm havin' a ball
You think because you're leaving that I'm gonna take a fall?
It was small thing, oh, it was really too small
Livin' large, boy, standing ten feet tall
Now my heart won't dent, keep the money I lent
And don't forget I pay the rent, this is my apartment
I'm independent

I am independent
That's right I said it, and be damn sure I meant it
'Cause a girl like me can have anybody
So give my love, boy, to my independent funk
Hey

Salty the V.I.P., you should have stuck with me
What are you stupid? Huh, my pockets run deep
So flex the Rolex and the sex that I gave ya
In jail with no bail and now nothin' can save ya
You want me to visit? I ain't with it lizard
We had magic now ya lost without the love wizard
Ya had to cross me, and now you lost me
Get off me softy, I'm the boss, see?
You can't disguise the lies in your eyes, you're not a heart breaker
You're a fraud, and I'm bored, you're a fake faker
It's too late to debate with the moneymaker
After while, crackhead, see ya later, gator

Woman and I am independent
I make my own money so don't tell me how to spend it
'cause you need me, and I don't need you
So listen close, boy, to my independent funk
Yeah, so funky, so funky

No, no, no more nookie for you 'cause I gave ya the boot
Go ahead and go in your Yugo, gonna miss the Benz Coupe, home troop
Who's supportin' ya now?
Got a job or do ya rob? I heard you're sellin' drugs, wow
Big man, huh? But just understand Uncle Sam know the scam
You'll end up in the can
Singin' a sad song 'cause you did me wrong
Couldn't fool me for long, I got it goin' on
I'm independent

Yes, I am independent
That's right I said it, and be damn sure I meant it
'Cause a girl like me can have anybody
So give my love, boy, to my independent funk
Hey yeah, my independent funk
It's just an independent funk
Get with this independent funk

You're a baby so maybe you just needed a babysitter
Bitter? I figure I'm rid of a piece of litter
Tiger, tigger, I bounce back, and you're a quitter
Your girl is gone for good so just forget her
You're blind, you'll never find another better
Your mind stays on a behind in a tight sweater
Burned your flowers and your love letters
Never a tear will I shed
I'm independent

Yes, I am independent
I make my own money so don't tell me how to spend it
'Cause you need me, and I don't need you
So listen close, boy, to my independent funk

What Latin style
In France it was Elisa; such a teaser

That made me smile

She was so shy, I wonder why?
And Lorna from California I should warn ya

Was free and wild, and I mean wild!
Mama Mia, what a mess I'm in!
Endless choices, where do I begin?

He stressed harder to make that bed and lock them doors

Used to rock Girbauds and go out with bros
Tryna get lots of hoes 'till I got exposed
To a bigger picture called free, in the picture, it was me
Al-Hajj Malik Shabazz, Muhammad, and Noble Drew Ali
A side of Erykah Badu and Andre 3000
Telling me what I can't be
But you can't paint me
Black is the color of my true love spirit and I do love lyrics
And I used to love Harold's Chicken and I dance pretty good
And I feel at home in the hood and I get lit in the club
Still I love

If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside
When I look in the sky, I see freedom
If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside
When I look in the sky, I see freedom

If you hear this rhyme, it's coming from division 9
The toughest in Cook County
They count me out 'cause I did a crime
They say it's violent time in human beings
But being they ain't seeing me as human
In this big business called prison, I'm the one that's consuming
Illuminati illuminate me, fume and hate me
Mutilate me from my family, society, and loved ones
I wasn't raised to love guns, well maybe toy ones
My pops, y'all built and destroyed him
With prescriptions of poverty, dope, and unemployment
When will we see enjoyment?
I smile when my little boy get to visit for about 30 minutes
But we ain't never spent Christmas together, tryna get it together
What I'mma do when I get out? I don't know what it is to live out
Just reminiscing of the big house, I'm the one justice chose to spit out
My life story is written in a prison sentence
Wonder if this cell got room for forgiveness?
Still I love

If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside
When I look in the sky, I see freedom
If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside
When I look in the sky, I see freedom

It's gonna be you and me
When you're feeling free make you feel alive
What you got inside make you go outside
The change in I, it's the realest high
It's the realest high
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, oh-yeah
It's gonna be you and me
When you're feeling free make you feel alive
What you got inside make you go outside
The change in I, it's the realest high
It's the realest high
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, oh-yeah
It's gonna be you and me
When you're feeling free, make you feel alive

Syd,"Red wine time on the couch
Happy you agreed to hang out
Keep my head in the clouds
Keep them old names out your mouth
I can make you laugh out loud
We the only ones in the house
I can help you body wind down
Make this bottle disappear right now
Get comfortable, comfortable
Get comfortable, comfortable
Get comfortable, comfortable
Let's stay in for the night
Maybe take a walk outside
Let's distance your pride
Me fall in love with your mind
If I look deep in your eyes
I can guess your zodiac sign
We ain't got nothing but time
We can just chill and unwind
Get comfortable, comfortable
Get comfortable, comfortable
Get comfortable, comfortable

Freedom is the road less traveled by the multitude
The mood, it's the mode, it's the culture
Where there's food there's vultures
More Tony now, back then I was Sosa
I was sent like a penny in a loafer
The 2Pac Deepak Chopra
On a plane drinking wine with Oprah
When I missed the dap I ain't mean to insult her
Black Caesar, ey o amo roma
Tuto biene vino rosa
My dominican girl she loves soca
Take her to Minetta take her to the MOCA
Most of my friends at home that I'm close to
When they talk, put it on stone like a sculpture
Used to be a hooper, now I'm a hoper
Thoughts I bring to life like an ultra sound
I'm bound to the underground
Breaking walls down for the black and brown
A activist is active now
How far will you go for exposure?
Little homie in the paint tryna post up
Don't make me have to put you on a poster
Posterized by what I vocalize
Weathered the storm like I know the skies
Yea we wear the mask but I know no disguise
These signs of the times are notarized
Written by the lord of the skies mortalized
In us, I got cold through cruel winters
Grandmas, defenders, Fred Hamptons agenda
Never been good with pretenders
They lying on the king like Simba
Dinner, branzino and red wine
Quality shared time
Fucking and laughing 'til its bed time

Red like my lips
Blue like past thoughts
Brown like your eyes
Just enough time
I can't think now
You're too close and I
Might be too nice
These New York nights
Got me taking chances
I think your hands
Might look just right
If they held mine
Get comfortable, comfortable
Get comfortable, comfortable
Get comfortable, comfortable
Get two glasses
Now I'm swimming
Off the deep end
Heightened senses
No pretending
Make my head spin
I like dancing
In my bedroom
It's just me and you
Put that tape on
Tell me what you want
Let's just make time feel, long
Get comfortable, get comfortable
You could just stay for the night
Here, let me turn down the lights
You can let go
Passion comes from down below
We go together like so
Let's make a toast
That we both can make the most of this time

Little bit by little bit 
And I haven't done this in a while 
I'm seeing old places 
Take a hit of small town news 
Don't want to be here tonight 
I'm dealing with ghosts 
I guess we're gonna find out now 
Nobody here to catch my fall 
I'm playing house host 
To a different feeling every night 
I've never been so alone in a bed.

Just new eyes to cry with 
Losing her's like pulling teeth 
We both know 
This lovesick life has got to go 
But I don't want to be alone 

I'm staying out later 
Blurry eyes make brand new thoughts 
Shouldn't be driving tonight 
Faces fade faster 
If you don't see them every time 
You turn a corner in this place 
And her name takes forever every time I think it 
It leaves a little trail of thoughts behind 
Lover to friend seems easy when you say it

Late last night night

Could you turn out the light?
And we laughed at ourselves for our serious nature
And what could have been a fight

The way we look at each other
The way you sing our songs
I can't wait till we get home
Because that's when I know
At the end of the day I'm the one who calls you baby

When you walk down the street they all stop and they stare
You know the way it is out there
He's either looking at you or he's looking at me
Get in the car, give me the keys
Let's drive down the middle of the city block
Roll down these windows and show them what I got
I found this sweet thing out there
But she's mine and not yours so what do you care?

I'm the who gets to tuck you in at night

With a honey plough of yellow prickly seeds
Clover honey pots and mystic shining feed

Well, the madcap laughed at the man on the border
Hey ho, huff the Talbot
Cheetah he cried shouted kangaroo
So through their tree they cried
Please leave us here
Close our eyes to the octopus ride

Hey ho, huff the Talbot
The winds they blew and the leaves did wag
And they'll never put me in their bag

So high you go, so low you creep
The winds it blows in tropical heat
The drones they throng on mossy seats
The squeaking door will always creep

So merrily trip for good my side

The larger her hand 'til no one understands
Why for so long she'd been gone.

And I borrowed the page
From a leopard's cage
And I prowled in the evening sun's glaze
Her head lifted high to the light in the sky
The opening dawn on her face

She was long gone long, long gone
She was gone, gone, the bigger they come
The larger her hand 'till no one understands
Why for so long she'd been gone.

And I stood very still by the window sill
And I wondered for those I love still
I cried in my mind where I stand behind
The beauty of love's in her eyes

She was long gone long, long gone
She was gone, gone, the bigger they come
The larger her hand 'till no one understands
Why for so long she'd been gone.

I strolled around to her pad

I said ""Yeah! Here I go""

loosened the rope in the creek is entwined.

pointed to the land where his fortune he'd find

Grizzly bear and raccoon his fare.

Syd Barrett,"An Effervescing Elephant
with tiny eyes and great big trunk
once whispered to the tiny ear
the ear of one inferior
that by next June he'd die, oh yeah!
because the tiger would roam.
The little one said: ""Oh my goodness I must stay at home!
and every time I hear a growl
I'll know the tiger's on the prowl
and I'll be really safe, you know
the elephant he told me so.""
Everyone was nervy, oh yeah!
and the message was spread
to zebra, mongoose, and the dirty hippopotamus
who wallowed in the mud and chewed
his spicy hippo-plankton food
and tended to ignore the word
preferring to survey a herd
of stupid water bison, oh yeah!
And all the jungle took fright,
and ran around for all the day and the night
but all in vain, because, you see,
the tiger came and said: ""Who me?!
You know, I wouldn't hurt not one of you.
I'd much prefer something to chew
and you're all to scant."" oh yeah!

Drift over your mind - holly

A velvet curtain of grey
Mark the blanket where the sparrows play
And the trees by the waving corn stranded

stands the ebony totem in ebony sand
a dream in a mist of gray...

The pebble that stood alone
and driftwood lies half buried
warm shallow waters sweep shells
so the cockles shine... 

A bare winding carcass, stark
shimmers as flies scoop up meat, an empty way...
dry tears...
crisp flax squeaks tall reeds
make a circle of gray in a summer way, around man
stood on ground...

Once upon a time there was a mountain
That rose out of a vast green forest
And in the forest there were birds
And lakes and rocks and trees and rivers

The forest was also inhabited
By a small group of people called the lizards
The lizards were a simple people
And they had lived in the forest undisturbed
For thousands of years in utter peace and tranquility

Once a year when spring came
And the first blossoms began to show
The lizards would gather at the base of the mountain
To give thanks for all that they had

They thanked the birds
And they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks
And the trees and the rivers
But most importantly, they thanked Icculus

Icculus lived at the top of the mountain
Or at least everyone thought so
For no one had actually ever seen him

But they knew he existed
Because they had the Helping Friendly Book
Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book
To the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift

It contained all of the knowledge
Inherent in the universe
And had enabled the Lizards
To exist in harmony with nature for years

And so they lived
Until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge
His name was Wilson
And he quickly became intrigued
By the Lizards way of life

He asked if he could stay on
And live in the forest
And the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider
Were happy to oblige

Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years
Studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book
And all was well

Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone
Wilson explained that he had hidden the book
Knowing that the Lizards had become
Dependent on it for survival

He declared himself king
And enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge
He cut down the trees and built a city
Which he called Prussia

And in the center of the city
He built a castle
And locked in the highest tower of the castle",Introduction,2008

Syd Bennett,"Find your wings (supposed to fly)
Find your wings (find your wings)
Hey you, whatcha doin' and why you runnin'?
Supposed to fly and take control cause you're the pilot
You can't swim, you're gonna drown, the sharks are comin'
The sky's your home, there's no limit, you know you gotta
Find your wings (fly)
Find your wings (find your wings)

My lil nigga, the world is yours, birdy

We can go down to the rainbows
Don't let your high keep your brain low
You're a bird
You're supposed to fly away
The way you stand there
Don't let your wings go to waste (go to waste)
The sky is your home, be free
Be free",Find Your Wings,2015
Syd Bennett,"I want you to want me
But you just gonna love me for the day
And I can't just walk away
Even though I know you're trouble babe

So I'mma take my time
Go with the flow, can't get too involved
You got a face that I
Just can't say no to
Just can't say no to you

You know I want you baby
You know I do
I'll give you my heart and the rest is up to you
You ain't no good for me, I know it's true
But you don't have to be
Cause I do it for the thrill, for the rush
I do it for the pain, for your touch
When I OD, when it's too much
If I survive, baby you're the one
You're the one

Babe

I feel like I'm walking
The tightrope of love in your circus babe
If I were a fella it'd be my last day
Even though you're right under me

So I'mma take my time
Go with the flow, can't get too involved
You got a face that I just can't say no to
Just can't say no to you

You know I want you baby
You know I do
I'll give you my heart and the rest is up to you
You ain't no good for me, I know its true
But you don't have to be, cause I do it
For the thrill, for the rush
I do it for the pain, for your touch
When I OD, when it's too much
If I survive, baby you're the one
You're the one",You're the One,2016
Syd Jacobson,"Carolina 
Gave me Dinah; 
I'm the proudest one 
Beneath the Dixie sun. 

News is spreadin' 
'Bout our weddin'; 
I hear church bells ringin', 
Here's the song my heart keeps singin': 

Dinah, 
Is there anyone finer 
In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her! 

Dinah, 
With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

Where's that tiger! Where's that tiger!
Hold that tiger! Hold that tiger ! Hold that tiger! 
Choke him, poke him, kick him and soak him!
Where's that tiger? Where's that tiger?
Where oh where can he be?
Low or highbrow, they all cry now
""Please play that Tiger Rag for me""
