Harold Melvin,"Satisfaction guaranteed or take your love back
Satisfaction guaranteed or take your love back

I'll give you something good, yes I will
Give you something good, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah

You don't have to believe me when I tell you
That my love is so good
And I know you're not being treated
Like I know you should

I don't wanna sound like I'm conceited
But I'm the one that you always needed
I tell ya what, I'll make you a bet
I'll give you love you will never forget, no, no

Harold Melvin,"Come on and go with me
Come on over to my place

I don't feel like being lonely tonight
You see, I want, I want some company
And you look like you're just my type
You're the kind, you're the kind
Whose spirits are runnin' free

Let's take a sip of some cold, cold wine
And dance to the music nice and slow
And you wont be under and kind of pressure
You see, we'll just let, we'll just let the evenin flow

Come on and go with me
I'd sure like that, baby
Come on over to my place
It would be so nice, it would be so good
Come on and go with me
Come on over to my place

You look like you're just bored to death
And you wanna get away
You wanna get away from this noisy crowd
Let's go where it's nice and quiet
Where there's nobody, there's nobody else around

Let's sit by a cozy lit fire
And we can be in each other's company
Now how does that sound to you?
You see, cause it sounds so good
It sounds so good to me

Come on and go with me
Would you do that, baby?
Come on over to my place
Would you do that, baby?
Would you do that, baby?
Come on and go with me
Come on over to my place

My car's right outside, we can leave right now
That's if you're ready to go
I know you're just beatin me
You see, I'd understand it
I'd understand it if you said no
But don't you do it, baby

Come on and go with me, come on, baby
(No)
Come on over to my place
(No, not tonight, no)
You see it's not far from here
(I believe you)

Would you just take a minute and think about it?
(Oh, man)
Would you just think about it, think about it? Yeah
(I'm thinkin' about it but I really have to say no)

Come on and go with me
Come on over to my place
(No, I know)
You're sittin' here, you've been sittin' here for quite a long time
(Yeah, I'm slightly bored, I hate bein' bored)

See, I've been watchin' you
(I've been doin' the same thing)
I've had my eyes on you
(I've been checkin' you out all night long)
You look so nice and you look so sweet
(Oh, thank you)

Come on and go with me
(That was sweet)
You look like you ought a be with me
Come on, over to my place
(Yeah, but what are you gonna with me? That's the problem)

Seems that you feel the same way I do
(I think it would pretty interesting)
It seems that you need some company, too
(Oh, boy)
Yeah

Come on and go with me
(You said your car is right outside, right in front)
Come on, over to my place
(And you're gonna bring me home after)
But would it be all right with you?

Come on and go with me
If we left here and we went somewhere else, baby
(Come on over to my place)
Somewhere where it's nice and quiet, nice and quiet
(That's nice, yeah, that sounds a little better than this place)
Where we could sit down by a cozy lit fire
We could sip a little wine, work things out
(Oh, yeah)

Come on and go with me
(Well, I cannot stay long)
Come on, over to my place
(We got an hour, no more than that)
Lady, you won't be under and kinda pressure
(Please, I cannot stand pressure)

I wouldn't do that, baby? No
(OK, well, would you get my coat?)
See, I wouldn't do that, baby
See, I just wanna sit down
And get to know you a little better
(OK, just for a little while)

I swear you look so good to me
(Are you gonna pay for my drink?)
Come on over to my place
You look so good to me",Come Go with Me,1981

Losin' out on everything you might try to do

Go to see your woman and she ain't even there

Don't seem to give a whiz about it and all your trapped in time???
The more I think about it, I think you're `bout to lose your mind
Some people call it jinxed, some say it ain't my day, huh

Harold Melvin,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

All I could do was cry.
I was losing the man that I loved,

Please? No, Now before you take your coat off, That's it
I got something to tell you
See, what I have to say is so very important to our relationship
Why is it that every time we go out on the town, we get around our friends?
Man, you're always talking about what you got, huh
Went out and bought for you
How much money I make
And what school our children go to
And all the fancy clothes and big pretty cars
The big diamond rings, and them fantastic mink coats
Is you for real? No, I don't think you are
Sit down, No, no, sit down
Now don't say nothing, You see
Wait a minute, wait a minute, that is your problem
That is your problem, You're always saying the wrong tthing at the right time
You see I don't--I don't know how to explain this to you
The best I can tell you is what my mother told me as I was coming up
She used to say, ""Son, chances go 'round,""
She said, ""The same people that you meet going up
They make the same old faces coming down,""
Heh, tell the truth
You see, people today, they come out there to party
They come out to party, man
They didn't come out to hear all that jive mess you talking about
You standing up in the corner with a bottle of champagne taking about
Harry, Joe, and Dick and Bobby and what they ain't got
And they live down in the lower development homes, and you won't even help
You won't even buy 'em a drink
Is that any way to meet them?
If you're gonna boast, boast around somebody that has what you have
Don't make your own brothers and sisters feel bad
You see Listen
I know you know what I'm talking about because from time to time
I can remember you coming to me putting your head on my shoulder and crying
""Oh, papa, why? Why? Why don't nobody wanna be my friend?""
You told me a long time ago, You said, ""Papa, what am I doing?""
I didn't wanna tell you that
I thought you had sense enough to realize what you're doing, but I see you don't
Sit down and listen to me, No, sit down!
You see, people are too sensitive today
They don't wanna hear all that jive you talking back
You see, they don't wanna hear about what you got
cause they're trying to get it, too
Heh, tell the truth
I can't very much blame her
As much as it hurts me, it hurts to see people
going around behind our backs saying that
""This woman this, this woman that,"" or ""she ain't this"" or ""she ain't that""
I wanna be proud of you, mama
I wanna be proud of you

Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes,"I heard church bells ringing,
I heard a choir singing.
I saw my love walk down the aisle.
On her finger, he placed a ring, oh, oh.

I saw them holding hands
She was standing there with my man.
I heard them promise 'til death do us part.
Each word was a pain in my heart.

Oh.  All I could do, all I could do was cry.
All I could do was cry.
I was losing the man that I loved,
and all I could do was cry.

And now the wedding is over,
rice has been thrown over their heads.
For them, life has just begun but mine is at an end

Oh.  All I could do, all I could do was cry.
All I could do was cry.

And all I could do was cry.","Wake up Everybody, Pt. 1 [Featuring Theodore Pendergrass, Jr.]",1999

Me and Mrs. Jones
We got a thing goin'on
We both know that it's wrong
But it's much too strong
To let it go now

We meet every day at the same cafe
Six-thirty and no one knows she'll be there
Holding hands, making all kinds of plans
While the juke box plays our favorite songs

We gotta be extra careful
That do we don't build our hopes up too high
Because she's got her own obligations
And so, and so, do I

But they don't have so very long before the Judgement Day
So won'tcha make them happy before they pass away
Wake up all the builders time to build a new land
I know we can do it if we all lend a hand
The only thing we have to do is put it in our mind
Surely things will work out they do it every time

I lay all my weekly burdens down
I put on my glad rags
And paint the town

Rolls around again

Partying to an end
Got to solve that same old grind
With those five day week
Sometimes, I get frustrated
Through the day, take off early
And a cut in pay
At the time, I don't really care
Because I done took
All that I can bear

He can laugh, but I love it

Sitting demurely 'neath the cherry blossom trees
Miss Butterfly's her name
A sweet little innocent child was she
'Till a fine young American from the sea
To her garden came

They met 'neath the cherry blossoms everyday
And he taught her how to love the American way
To love with her soul t'was easy to learn
Then he sailed away with a promise to return

Poor butterfly
'Neath the blossoms waiting
Poor Butterfly
For she loved him so
The moments pass into hours
The hours pass into years
And as she smiles through her tears
She murmurs low

But if he won't come back, then I'll never sigh or cry
I just must die

I fear that they will ever haunt me,
All through my life they'll taunt me
But will they ever want me?
Green eyes, make my dreams come true.

It's as if as though I'm standing at her front door 
I can hear that doggone plain 
Now I'll be so glad to see my baby 
And hold her in my arms 
Now when I kiss her lips 
I turn a back over flip and I'll forget these feet of mine 
I got to keep on walkin' 
I got to walk on oh ho ho

Huh although my feet are tired I can't lose my stride

HARP,"Riding on the City of New Orleans,
Illinois Central Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders,
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail.
All along the southbound odyssey
The train pulls out at Kankakee
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields.
Passin' trains that have no names,
Freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles.

Good morning America how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.

Dealin' cards with the old men in the club car.
Penny a point ain't no one keepin' score.
Won't you pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor.
And the sons of Pullman porters
And the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpets made of steam.
Mothers with their babes asleep,
Are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they dream.

Good morning America how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.

Nighttime on The City of New Orleans,
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee.
Half way home, we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness
Rolling down to the sea.
And all the towns and people seem
To fade into a bad dream
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news.
The conductor sings his song again,
The passengers will please refrain
This train's got the disappearing railroad blues.

Good night, America, how are you?

Thinking he was a trusty tree,
But first he bended and then he broke,
And thus did my false love to me.

I put my hand into some soft bush,
Thinking the sweetest flower to find.
I pricked my finger to the bone,
And left the sweetest flower alone.

Gay as a jewel, when first it is new,
But love grows old, and waxes cold,
And fades away, like summer dew.

I'm standing 'round my window
You say you're going away
But I believe in love

The power of love divine
Will surely shine you'll see
And guide us to where we ought to be

The moon is coming up
And I'm still here in prayer
You say you've had enough
And that you just don't care

But while the stars are coming out
And light shines from above
You tell me in my dreams
That you believe in love

And even though you do

Will surely shine you'll see
And guide you home again to be...

For a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises.

Still a man hears what he wants to hear and disregards the rest.

When I left my home and my family I was no more than a boy,
In the company of strangers,
In the quiet of the railway station, runnin' scared.
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters,
Where the ragged people go.
Lookin' for the places, only they would know.

Asking only workman's wages I come lookin' for a job,
But I get no offers,
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue.

I took some comfort there.

Does as well. It don't matter what step you step,

Dance until you're blue in the face and dizzy.

Ich geh zum Blind Date, hoff es ist ne geile Frau
Ich steh am Treffpunkt, was für ne dreiste Sau
Sie kommt angewackelt, man wie kacke sieht sie aus
Was für ein Fettschwein, was für ein Vich die Braut
Sie schielt mich an, was für ein Elefant
Nicht elegant - so eklig Mann
Sie braucht ne Typberatung, sie hat ein Doppelkinn
Weil das Opferkind jeden Burger doppelt nimmt
Oink, Oink, das Schwein da kriegt kein Freund, Freund
Ich lass sie abblitzen, guck mal wie sie heult, heult
Sie stank so übel, die Bitch, hat so übel geschwitzt
Und hatte locker um die 80 Kilo Übergewicht

Es gibt Frauen mit Verstand, Frauen mit Charme
Doch irgendwie krieg ich nur die mit zuviel Haaren
So wie letztens die Braut an Silvester
Kein Scheiss, die sah aus wie Reinhold Messner
So mit Fell aufm Rücken, wie ein Yeti
Und ich dachte wenn ich NEIN sage, versteht sie
Sie hat geweint, sie hat gedacht, dass ich sie liebe
Doch ihr Zickenbart am Kinn macht mir ???
Sie war so unendlich unmenschlich haarig
Dachte das Monster etwa das stört mich gar nicht?!

Ich sag trotzdem diese Nutte hat kein Sexappeal
Ich krieg'n Abtörn von ihrer SMS
Weil sie will, dass ich mich mit ihr zum Essen treff'
Ich krieg'n Abtörn, denn sie hat kleine Titten

Und es stinkt als wär ihre Muschi Schweinefleisch

Es törnt mich ab, wenn Sie immer das letzte Wort hat (nänänä)
Und immer am lautesten schreit, als wär's ne Sportart

Redet wie ein Mann, mein Gott ekelt sie mich an
Es törnt mich ab, wenn sie trinkt wie ein Loch(gluck)
Oder wenn ihr Stöhnen klingt wie ein Frosch(quark)
Wenn sie fett ist und es ihr nichts ausmacht
Oder sie nicht gleich ficken will, wenn sie aufwacht(yeah)

A ghost in a hurry to fade
I'm taking it one way to nowhere

Trailing this rusted wreck
As our back pages
Scatter in the dust we left
Like a pearl necklace
Fallen from around your neck

Over the miles yet to cover
A ghost in a hurry to fade

With supreme visions of lonely tunes

Who knows what stands in front of our lives

Silence tells me secretly ev'rything, ev'rything
Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star

The joint on the dresser, a gauge went off
Jumped up, fish tank, it fell and they stuck
They shot her cousin LaVon, he owed a buck
Willie was awful, pulled out the ratchet, let off two
Grits fell on his leg, Kiana ripped the cold bowl
He violent, an Island nigga with the talent
Of six killas who just came home, from straight wilding
Robbing everything in Macy's, Lacy, short haircut
With long arms, who fuck niggas, got four babies
Yvette jabber her, slapped her wig off, ran in the crib
She did the dumb shit, my nigga then clapped her
Lester, smoked Chester sister, Vest, I heard it was a mess
They ripped the apple out her throat, blessed her
Hungry hyenas from Medina, all eight trained us
Who got reluct', think fast, and blast from Beamers

[Ghostface Killah]
I brought my bitch out to Pathmark, she's pushing the cart
Headed to aisle four, damn I got milk on my Clark's
That's what I get, not focusing, from hitting that bar
My mouth dried, need plenty water quick, I feel like a shark
In the aisle, busting them paper towels and wiping my Wally's down

I stood up to face a barrel, he's holding a shiny pound
It's him, he want revenge, I murdered his Uncle Tim
I sold him a bag of dope, his wife came and copped again
That bitch is crazy and uh, she brought her baby
She knew I hard the murders, a smack, it killed her man though
Now I got his fucking nephew gripping his gat, you'se a bitch...
You better kill me... you know you're booty...
You pulled your toolie out on me... motherfucker!
First thought was to snatch the ratchet, said fuck it and fucking grabbed it
I ducked, he bucked twice, this nigga was fucking laughing
I wrestled him to the ground, tustle, scuffle, constantly kicked him
He wouldn't let go the joint so I fucking bit him
Shots was whizzing, hitting Clorox bottles
Customers screaming, then the faggot ran out of hollows
I had to show him what it's all about
Next thing you read in the paper ""A man who came to kill, gets knocked out""

[Chorus: Erykah Badu]
I don't know whhhhhhhhhhhy... nobody told you
Man's not supposed to cry...
Though we're just babies... and you're so crazy
How tears of joy, bring so much life

[Method Man]
Yo aiyo yo yo yo
You on ya way to the store, nigga, grab me a Dutch
I'm mad as fuck, my dude, my count was short when I was bagging it up
Now I need liquor, nigga pass me a cup
What's up with Officer Brown? The other day he tried to shackle me up
He killed Kase and now he hassling us
This motherfucker got balls, even the gaul to try and patten me up
Time to re-up, let these niggaz know we back on the block
With three hundred off a G-pack, it's cracking the spot

And some thrills I can't define.

Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

An airline ticket to romantic places

And candle lights on little corner tables

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Harry Allen,"I remember other days how I used to weep 
Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Dreaming of a song

Haunts my reverie

Can you finish what you start

That's the kind of magic

The midnight sun was shining too

Against a flaming sky and sea

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1996
Harry Arnold,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part

Harry Arnold,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,2003

To me he means a million other things

I wouldn't have him change it for a king

I reveal how I do adore her
Hang my heart on my sleeve just for her
All my love through out life assure her
If this moment I could Amour her

Thinkin' upon the joys I've had
Time makes fools of men they say
Take me back to that distant day

And watch the lovers meet
They stand in the moonlight hand in hand
With the surf breaking over their feet

Back to my girl down in Port of Spain

In Mandalay at a gay cafe
In the wee little hours of morn
When guitars and violins end their play
With a hymn to the goddess of dawn

These are the times when I know
How alone one can be
And I yearn to go once again
Back to my girl down in Port of Spain

Harry Belafonte,"Yesterday a child came out to wonder,
Caught a dragonfly inside a jar.
Fearful when the sky is full of thunder,
And tearful at the falling of a star.

And the seasons, they go 'round and 'round,
And the painted ponies go up and down.
We're captive on the carousel of time.
We can't return, we can only look behind
From where we came,
And go 'round and 'round and 'round in the circle game. 

Then the child moved ten times round the seasons,
Skated over ten clear frozen streams.
Words like ""when you're older"" must appease him,
And promises of someday make his dreams.

And the seasons, they go 'round and 'round,
And the painted ponies go up and down.
We're captive on the carousel of time.
We can't return, we can only look behind
From where we came,
And go 'round and 'round and 'round in the circle game.

Sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now,
Cartwheels turn to car wheels through the town.
And they tell him, ""Take your time, it won't be long now,
'Till you drag your feet to slow the circle down.""

Laid down his hammer and he died

Harry Belafonte,"When I was a lad just three-foot-three
Certain questions occurred to me
So I asked me father quite seriously
To tell me the story 'bout the bird and bee
He stammered and he stuttered pathetically
And this is what he said to me

He said, the woman piaba and the man piaba
And the Ton Ton call baka lemon grass
The lily root, gully root, belly root uhmm
And the famous grandy scratch scratch

It was clear as mud but it covered the ground
And the confusion made the brain go 'round
I went and ask a good friend of mine
Known to the world as Albert Einstein
He said son, from the beginning of time and creativity
There existed the force of relativity
Pi r square and minus ten is routine only when
The solar system in one light year
Make the Hayden planetarium disappear
So if Mt Everest doesn't move
I am positive that it will prove

That the woman piaba and the man piaba
And the Ton Ton call baka lemon grass
The lily root, gully root, belly root uhmm
And the famous grandy scratch scratch

The mud it covered the ground
And the confusion made the brain go 'round
I grabbed a boat and I went abroad
And in Baden Germany asked Sigmund Freud
He said son, from your sad face remove the grouch
Put the body up on the couch
I can see from your frustration a neurotic sublimation, hey
Love and hate is psychosomatic
Your Rorschach shows that you're a peri pathetic
It all started with a broken sibling
In the words of the famous Rudyard Kipling

He said the woman piaba and the man piaba
And the Ton Ton call baka lemon grass
The lily root, gully root, belly root uhmm
And the famous grandy scratch scratch

Well I traveled far and I traveled wide
And I don't even have me self a bride
All the great men upon this earth
Have confused me since my birth
I've been over land and been over sea
Trying to find answer 'bout the bird and bee
But now that I am ninty three
I don't give a damn you see

If the woman piaba and the man piaba
And the Ton Ton call baka lemon grass
Hey, the lily root, gully root, belly root uhmm
And the famous grandy scratch scratch",Man Piaba,1984

He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh
Shook back his clothes all around

Traveled about

He said I dance now at every chance in Honky tonks

Harry Belafonte,"I'm sitting in the railway station. 
Got a ticket to my destination. 
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand. 
And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band. 
Homeward bound, 
I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 
Ev'ry day's an endless stream 
Of cigarettes and magazines. 
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories 
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be, 
Homeward bound, 
I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 

Tonight I'll sing my songs again, 
I'll play the game and pretend. 
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity 
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me.

This could never be, she said pleadingly
Don't ever love me, I'm just fancy-free
This could never be, she said pleadingly

The moonlight soft on her face
I held her close in my arms
My heart was quick to her charms
But then I saw in her glance
It was just an evening's romance

With his comrades down beside him
On that brutal day

Those three are on my mind""

I see dark eyed Michael
With his dark eyed bride

And three proud mothers
Weeping side by side
Those three are on my mind

But I'm grieving yet
And for some the sky is bright
I cannot give up hoping
For a morning light
So I ask the killers, ""Do you sleep at night?
Oh, those three are on my mind""

I see tin roof shanties
Where my brothers live
Those three are on my mind
And the little burnt out churches
Where they sing we forgive
Those three are on my mind

I know the price of liberty
Now I ask the question that is deep inside of me
Did they also burn the Courthouse
When they killed those three

Who built the ark? Noah. Yeah
Who built the ark? Noah Noah
Noah built the ark
When after God told him what to do
Then the work began cut and hew
Ringing o' the hammer was ""judgment""
Ringing o' the saw ""God said repent""
100 years he hammered and sawed
Building the ark by the grace of God
After the foundation was laid
Hewed down the timber and the ark was made
Called in the animals two by two
There was the Ox, the Camel and the Kangaroo
Hallowed in the monkey and the crocodile
He even made the animals they couldn't smile
Packed them in the ark so tight
The Owl couldn't get no sleep at night
Called in Japheth and Shem and Ham
God began to flood the land
Raised his hand to heaven on high
And knocked that sun and the moon from the sky
Shook the mountains and disturbed the sea
Hitched his reins to his Chariot Wheel
Stepped on land and stood out on shore
Declared this time couldn't be no more

Harry Belafonte,"They asked me how I knew my true love was true
I of course replied ""something here inside cannot be denied""
They said ""someday you'll find all who love are blind""
When your heart's on fire, you must realize smoke gets in your eyes
So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed to think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away, I am without my love

Now laughing friends deride tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say ""when a lovely flame dies, smoke gets in your eyes""

Of peace on earth good will to man

And in despair I bowed my head
There is no peace on earth I said
For hate is strong and marks the song
Of peace on earth good will to man

The wrong shall fail the right prevail
With peace on earth good will to man",I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day,1997

Creep through my fingers and the moon is bright
Beams of blue come flickering through my window pane
Like gypsy moths that dance around a candle flame

That I never understood
That although you said you'd go
Until you did I never thought you would

Moonlight used to bathe the contours of your face
While chestnut hair fell all around the pillow case
The fragrance of your body rests beneath my head
A sympathy bouquet left with the love that's dead

And I wonder if you know
That I never understood
That although you said you'd go
Until you did I never thought you would

Never thought the words you said were true
Never thought you said just what you meant
Never knew how much I needed you
Never thought you'd leave until you went

Morning comes and morning goes with no regret
And evening brings the memories I can't forget
Empty rooms that echo as I climb the stairs
And empty clothes that drape and fall on empty chairs

All my days I will sing in praise

Cutting cane for her family

Starting a song, so sweet

Searching the winding road with eyes

Harry Belafonte,"It's as dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

I never will forget one time when I was on a little visit down home in Ebenezer, Kentucky. 
I was a-talkin' to an old man that had known me ever since the day I was born, and an old friend 
of the family. He says, ""Son, you don't know how lucky you are to have a nice job like you've got 
and don't have to dig out a livin' from under these old hills and hollers like me and your pappy 
used to."" When I asked him why he never had left and tried some other kind of work, he says, 
""Nawsir, you just won't do that. If ever you get this old coal dust in your blood, you're just 
gonna be a plain old coal miner as long as you live."" He went on to say, ""It's a habit 
sorta like chewin' tobaccer."" 

Come and listen you fellows, so young and so fine,
And seek not your fortune in the dark, dreary mines. 
It will form as a habit and seep in your soul, 
'Till the stream of your blood is as black as the coal. 

It's dark as a dungeon and damp as the dew, 
Where danger is double and pleasures are few, 
Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines
It's dark as a dungeon way down in the mine.
It's a-many a man I have seen in my day, 
Who lived just to labor his whole life away. 
Like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard his wine, 
A man will have lust for the lure of the mines. 

I hope when I'm gone and the ages shall roll, 
My body will blacken and turn into coal. 
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home, 
And pity the miner a-diggin' my bones.",Dark as a Dungeon,2004

And just when you want to tell her
That you have no love to give her
She gets you on her wavelength
And lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you think you maybe trust her
'Cause she's touched your perfect body with her mind

And Jesus was a sailor
When he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time watching
From a lonely wooden tower
And when He knew for certain
Only drowning men could se Him
He said ""All men shall be sailors,
Then, until the sea shall free them""
But He Himself was broken
Long before the sky would open
Forsaken almost human,
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone

And you want to travel with Him
And you want to travel blind
And you think you maybe trust Him
For He's touched your perfect body with His mind

There are children in the morning

I may sail on many a sea

Oh, island in the sun
Willed to me by my father's hand
All my days I will sing in praise
Of your forest, waters, your shining sand

As morning breaks the heaven on high
I lift my heavy load to the sky
Sun comes down with a burning glow
Mingles my sweat with the earth below

Cutting cane for her family
I see man at the waterside
Casting nets at the surging tide
