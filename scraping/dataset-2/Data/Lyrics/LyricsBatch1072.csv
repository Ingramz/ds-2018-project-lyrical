T.C. Ellis,"Where are you?
You can relax now, the Max is in control
Go, yeah yeah

When my back is so far back it's on the other side of the wall
When half a chance is all I get if I get a chance at all
When the going gets tougher than the tough can go
I grind the axe, that's when I go, I go, I go to the max, I go

The max, Yo baby, tell me where the party's at
The max, Yo baby, I want to shuffle the cards in that stack (I go)
The max, We can dance if you want to, but I might break yo back
The max, More funk for your buck you can bet on that

When they tell me to walk a straight line
I put on crooked shoes
When they tell me that I can't live forever
I pay some overdues (Kick it)
When they start makin' up a crazy rule
That's when I break a back
Cause when I go, I go, I go to the max, I go

The max, yo baby (oh yeah), tell me where the party's at
The max, yo baby, I want to shuffle the cards in that stack (oh, yeah yeah)
The max, we can dance if you want to (oh yeah), but I might break yo back
(to the max)
The max, more funk for your buck you can bet on that

Let's go [Repeat: x4]
Oh, yeah yeah!

(Dig it) When my body starts to shiver from the chill of
The scarlett sweat
When my lips eclipse the sun and the moon
Reflecting from the wet
When the blood of my love outraces
Every one of the stallions in your pack, that's when
You go, you go, you go 2 the max. you go

The max (to the max)
The max (oh, get funky)
The max (get-get-get funky) (to the max)
The max (get funky)

Let' go
I think I'm gonna like this

Let's go (dance)
I want to dance
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go (Oh yeah yeah!)

I go to the max
I'm not afraid (oh my god)
I want to dance

Then listen,
When the going gets tougher than the tough can go
I grind the axe, that's when I go, I go, I go 2 the max. I go

The max, yo baby, tell me where the party's at
The max, yo baby, I want to shuffle the cards in that stack
The max, we can dance if you want 2, but I might break yo back
The max, more funk for your buck you can bet on that

This is the max

Dear love, dear love, dear love
Forgive me for my sins
But you left me in such a cold cold world to suffer in (kick it)
And Contrary to popular belief
Even though one's life is brief
If you go there once you
Come again and again and
Let's go

(I'm so sorry for you)

This is the max",The Max,1992
T.C. Ellis,"He realized that she was new to love
Naive in every way
Every schoolboy's fantasy she was
That's why he had to wait
If he poured his heart into a glass
And offered it like wine
She could drink and be back in time for the morning papers
They could take a walk down the ocean side
Make a wish on every wave
They could find a carousel
And ride or kiss in every cave
They could contemplate the entire universe
Or just one star
Or just how far was the walk for the morning papers

Let me play it for you one time, oh oh
Well
Hey
Shucks

Why is age more than a number when it comes to love?
Should we ask the ones who speculate
When they don't know what it's made of?
Should we ask the moonlight on your face
Or the raindrops in your hair
Or should we ask the man who wrote it there in the morning papers?

Should we ask the moonlight on your face

My name is Prince and I am funky 
My name is Prince, the one and only 
I did not come to funk around 
Till I get your daughter, I won't leave this town 
In the beginning (funky) God made the sea 
But on the seventh day He made me 
He was tryin' to rest why'all when He heard the sound 
Sound like a guitar cold gettin' down 
I tried to bust a high note, but I bust a string 
My God was worried until he heard me sing

I know from righteous, I know from sin 
I got to sides and they both friends 
Don't try to clock 'em, they're much to fast 
If you try to stop 'em, they'll kick that ass 
Without a pistol, without a gun 
When you hear my music, you be havin' fun 
That's when I gotcha, that's when you mine 
To tell the truth, tell me what's my line?

Funky fresh for the 90's (Prince) 

My name is Prince, I don't want to be King 
'Cause I've seen the top and it's just a dream 
Big cars and women and fancy clothes 
Will save your face but it won't save your soul 
I'm here to tell you that there's a better way 
Would our Lord be happy if He came today? 
I ain't sayin' I'm better, no better than you, huh 
But if you want to play with me, you better learn the rules (Ow!)

The funkier I be, the funkier I get, ooh shit 
Lickety split on the lyric, a new jack in the pulpit 
Watch it deacon, your track is leakin' 
What is this you're seekin'? 
The syncopated rhymes are at their peak when? 
You jumped on my D.I.C.K. 
That's the one thing I don't play 
The jock strap was too big for you anyway 
You're just a simpleton 
I'll bust you like a pimple, son 
My star is too bright, boy 
I'll sink you like the ship Poseidon Adventure 
You're bumpin' dentures to be cocksure 
There must be more coming from your mouth than manure 
So with a flow and a spray, I say hey 
You must become a Prince before you're King anyway 

(Do that, do that somebody) {x2} 
It's time I get ig-ig-ig-ig-ig-ig-ignorant 
Def be the beat that I'm rockin' 
Yo, so come get a hit 
And put your thinking cap on 
You've been forewarned 
I call upon the inner forces I've got brewin' in my cauldron 
That means my nugget, sometimes I'm rugged 
The style I posses be havin' the other brothers buggin' 
And this is four those who oppose 
And propose to overexpose, disclose 
Pose a threat to my brother 
Like any other man makin' a stand 
I'll be damned if I let you play this hand 
I'm the blackjack dealer and the cards are stacked 
What do you expect to win when you're used to playing craps? 
Yeah, let's get rid of them, hmm? 

(Do that, do that somebody) {x2} 
It's gettin' tricky, that means a sticky situation 
To resurrect a groove with feeling and give it this much affection 
Passion flows who knows what lurks in the gallows of my mind 
I put my foot in the ass of Jim Crow 
Twelve inches of non-stop sole 
I'm on a roll - yo P, it's time for the show 
So do that, do that somebody 
Wave your hands in the air, this is a motherfuckin' party 
While you're layin' back, I'm on the attack 
Paddywhack - give yourself a bone 
This is my house and I'm prone 
To layin' some chrome upside some motherfucker's dome

Our parents wondered what it was like to have another color near
So they put their babies together to eliminate the fear
We sacrifice yes we did
Fighting one another, (we sacrifice) (don't say it preacher)

The angel of hate, she taught me how to kick her

That God for my mother hers was no easy song
Thank God that He showed me, how to get along

And how it broke my heart and home & had me losin' faith

So glad they introduced me to, my Father
Your story sounds a lot like mine, it's a story told a thousand times
Someone hurting leaves in dis-array

But don't you know that God made you, more valuable than they ever knew
You know you can live past their mistakes
How you sit and wonder, how could all this be, someone that you loved so much
Just turn their backs and leave
Oh You need the lover of your soul and He is able to take care of you
Find He will never leave

Lately, pastor I've been having all these crazy kind of dreams
It's hard to sleep, I can't eat
Scary, you know (I know what you mean)
I mean, every since that Tuesday
Seems like life's just getting real strange (I hear ya)
Anthrax, terrorist attacks and
I ain't even trying to get on no plane (I feel ya)
And you know when I try to pray
There's a voice that telling that God's not real
(You know that's just the enemy)
Yea, but you ain't feeling me (No son, I know just know you feel)
(See, just because I preach and teach)
(Don't mean I don't get scared sometimes)
Yea, whatever, but you T.D. Jakes (Well, then I don't make mistakes)
Well (Now, let me tell you what's on my mind)

When your smile is gone (He cares)
Yea, but I feel so alone (He's there and)
Although, your heart is heavy, God said
(Every burden I will bear)
See, but you don't know my (my pain)
And I'm getting so sick and tired of all (this rain)
I just got laid off, and to top it off the rent's due
So tell me what I got to gain?
Well, see, trials come to make (you strong)
Storms won't last (last long)
But how can I trust God in all this mess?
Well, see that's the reason for the song
See, wherever you go there's one thing ya got to know
God, is right there by your side (weeping may endure for a night)
And he told me to tell you everything
(Everything's goin' be alright)

So thank you for calling, it's always good to hear from you
(Yea, but) but I gotta go now
(Wait a minute) I got another call on line 2
(But I ain't through)

See I'm sick and tired of all these church folk
Talking about stuff ain't as bad as it seems
See, why'all don't feel my pain (I don't have pain?)
I don't see how, you on the cover on Time magazine
(See, but you're looking at now and you don't know how I struggled)
(And what I've been through)
Yea, whatever (Now, you crossed the line)
I'm just speakin' my mind (Okay so let me speak mine, too) (Hmmmmmm)
(I've made some mountains, I've seen some valleys)
(I've even had to cry sometimes)
(Like when I lost my mother)
Your mother? (my mother) I'm sorry (No son, that's fine)
(See life is full of ups and downs but God said)
*singer* the storm won't last long
But how'd you make it through? (Boy, I thought you knew)
(It was His) *singer* love that kept me strong

[Chorus Two - T.D Jakes] {Kirk Franklin} (Singer)
When your smile is gone (He cares)
But I feel so alone} (He's there and)
Although, your heart is heavy, God said
(Every burden I will bear)
Yea, but see why'all don't feel (my pain)
And I'm getting very sick and tired of all this} (this rain)
Just got laid off, and to top it off the rent's due
So tell me, Bishop, what I gotta gain?
Didn't I tell you trials come to make (you strong)
And those old storms won't (last long)
How can I trust God in the midst of all this mess?
See that's the reason for this song
Wherever you go there's something ya got to know (God still cares)
(Weeping may endure for a night)
And he told me to tell you
(Everything's gon' be alright)

Thank you pastor (Any time)
I think I can make it now, just tell me what I need to do
(Just pray this prayer with me)

Say Father (Father) forgive me (forgive me)
I'm sorry (I'm sorry) please help me (help me)
I love You (I love You) I need You (I need You)
Hold me (hold me) Jesus (Jesus)
My heart (my heart) my soul (my soul)
Please take (please take) control (control)
Right now (Now) now
(Now) now (now) (right now)

When you ain't got no smile (He cares)
{And even when you feel so alone (He's there and)
Although your heart is heavy, God said
(Every burden I will bear)
And even in the midst of all ya (pain)
And when you're sick and tired of all the rain (this rain)
Remember that the rain won't last always
And in Christ Jesus, you got so much to gain
You see your trials come to make you (strong)
And the storms won't last (too long)
Remember my brother, my sister, it's only temporary
See that's the reason for this song
Wherever you go there's something you've got to know
God is still there (weeping may endure for a night)
And He told me to tell you
(Everything's goin' be alright)",911,2002

I got a weekend business trip bound to LA""

And across town the telephone rings

Two for the show
One to pay for the credit cards
And two to rock 'n roll

One gave her the wedding ring

But two gives her the feeling she needs
That one's money can't buy

 I can't fight this fire along stay with me until it's gone. Ooh war is Hell on the Home front Too. It was July hot in side me as she lead me to the bed room door with satin sheets and pleasure (I never knew I could feel before). My first taste of lovin' was everything it should have been, when a woman's fighting loneliness it's a battle she can't win. I'll always remember what she did and what she said but the one thing I remember most was the way she turned his picture over on the table by her bed and now she says.

The repercussions can be cruel

No one to reach to
Gravity seen you
You the one in church that the preachers will preach to
And you're prayer just for confession
More blessings
Try to get protection from manic depression and keep stepping
From mean impressions
The supper comes with dressing
Attached with life and karma and its own lessons
And that's faith and love and peace and trust
And never participate with the evil in us
And life ain't fair when you feel wear and tear
Remember God don't put more into you than you can bear
And believe that to death
A long journey don't start til the first step

On top, toupée, y'all niggas fruitcakes

Pull up in the drop with the ceiling top back
Couple weeks old, ""Bugatti"" done went gold
You ain't even know, I deserve that plaque
We the best, runnin' every summer in fact
July 16th I'm bringin' the real back
Broward! Pussy

(This the remix!) I woke up in a new Bugatti

Ho' hold up, double M back in this bitch
Walk in the club with a MAC on my hip
Diamonds look like niggas snappin' a flick
Ballin' I blow fifty racks in the VIP
I back in the whip, Maybach with your bitch
A new Mussolini in back of the six
I'm shittin' on rappers, these rappers is sick
Cause my homies got whips that these rappers ain't get
Cause we crackin' them bricks and I package the zip
And I'm switchin' my flow, I spit crack in this bitch
And I been hit your ho, now she back on my dick
But I get to the dough and get back at your bitch
Like hollup, I woke up in Coon new Ferrari

For that, in God we trust, we bang
I'm the new John Gotti in a new Bugatti
I got a few young hotties wanna get shit poppin'
Right, put it in the light
Nigga got ice but it don't look right
If a nigga buy a brick and it don't cook right
I'll whip that shit for a rack, sit tight
I got a bag full of tools and some yay to move
And all I want is money, leave the fame to you
I graduated out of gladiator school
So all I know is go like I'm trained to do (Turn up!)
Right now, turn my Mazy pedal to the metal I'm ashin' out
I let the top down in my Phantom drop
Blowin', I'm high as an astronaut
When you see me, I'm cashin' out
Walked into Mercedes bought half the lot
You keep carrying on, you getting carried out
Cause I don’t take ass whoopins, just pass ‘em out
Is this worth getting blasted about?
No forreal, is it worth getting blasted about?

Money conversation
Get so high, I be scrapin'
Got my eyes like a Asian
In my ride, like I'm racin'
In the sky, like a plane
It's Gang or die
Ain't no lames up in my circle
Ain't no ho shit in my eyes
Throwin' money in the air
Poppin' bands and let it fly
Where I'm from, you come up short
Pull that thing and let it fly
You know me, blow so much dank, think I'm Marley
Got so much ink on my body
Brought so much drink to the party

Flow hot as the Mojave, gimme that sloppy shit
All on my car stick, give her some hundreds she did
Like this, I'mma say this (I'mma say this)
Fuck it, I'll say it (Fuck it, I'll say it)
If you got good pussy you should always have your rent paid
Choke on some bands if I'm not mistaken
Edit up my outfit, fashion statement
This the school of hard knocks, graduation

(This the remix!) I woke up in a new Bugatti

I'm sick of y'all niggas all talkin' crazy
Hottest nigga spittin' and they can't debate it
I didn't really know 2Pac or Big

Fuck underrated, I'm constipated

You're now tuned into the fuckin' greatest
Ace Hood, congratulations
Say name one nigga that's rockin' with him
Flow like a hundred round choppa nigga
Made a way out of the jungle
And now they in trouble, I used to be humble as shit
Recently flooded my neck and my wrist
Tell all them critics to suck on the dick, nigga

Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones and they wanna know
Oh, oh, oh

If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on and they want a show
Oh, oh, oh, yeah

Yeah, uh, a fresh cool young Lu
Trying to cash his microphone check 2, 1, 2
Want to believe my own hype but it's too untrue
The world brought me to my knees
What have you brung you?

Did you improve on the design?
Did you do something new?
Well, your name ain't on the guest list
Who brung you?

You, the more famous person you come through
And the sexy lady next to you come to
And then it hit me, standing outside of heaven
Waiting for God to come and get me

I'm too uncouth, unschooled to the rules and two gum shoe
Too much of a newcomer and too uncool
Like Shadow and Lavelle, I battle with it well
Though I need a holiday like lady who song blue
Go back whatever you did you undo
Heavy is heaven, the devil on my two tons too

If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones and they wanna know
Oh, oh, oh, yeah

And you better wear your shades
The spotlights here can burn holes through the stage
Down through the basement
Passed the Indian graves where the dinosaurs laid

And out through China nearly misses air liners
Magnified times five this is pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest a blaze
Now that's important to say, 'cause even with all of that
Most of us don't want it to fade

We want it to braid, meaning we want it to grow
Meaning we want it to stay like the governor called
And they told him to wait, unstrap him from the chair
Put him back in his cage

The audience ain't fazed
They ain't gone clap and they ain't gone praise
They want everything back that they paid
'Cause they been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim

If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear the crowd is here
And the lights are on and they want a show
Oh, oh, oh, yeah

So chauffeur, chauffeur come and take me away
'Cause I been standing in this line for like five whole days
Me and security ain't getting along
And when I got to the front they told me all of the tickets were gone

So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown, M&M's are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture

One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every songs a favorite song and Mikes don't feed back
All the reviewers say you need to go and see that

And everybody claps 'cause everybody is pleased
Then they all take the stage and start performing for me
Like ha, ha, haha, ha
Ha, ha, haha, ha, ha

If you are what you say you are a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones and they wanna know
Oh, oh, oh

If you are what you say you are a superstar
Then have no fear the crowd is here
And the lights are on and they want a show

Ain't scared of none of y'all, so you know my aim good
Blowing bin Laden in my Porsche 911
Just left Ground Zero, on my way to kush heaven
Can't slow down, too much evil in my rear view
Sometimes you wanna scream to God, but he can't hear you
And even if you did, this'll probably be his answer:
""Fuck you ‘plaining about? It ain't like you got cancer""
Do it for my niggas on the block that got it worse
First the love, then the hate, that just a trap nigga's curse
I bet you feel like the whole world hating on you
But what's the hold up? The whole world waiting on you

(The fame)
I wake up and feel empty
Shit make you want to squeeze your Glock until it's empty
I'm already standing on the edge, so don't tempt me
Fake motherfuckers envy

You mean to tell me from running my big mouth
That I could chill here in this big penthouse?
All elevatored up, black hardwood floors
Just to sit around and feel like it ain't yours
Your conscience got you feeling like you done something wrong
But the flat screen saying motherfucker, we on
Pardon me, nigga, do you see this view?
See Ruth's Chris from here, what the fuck's wrong with you?
Looking at my Rollie, yeah, it's almost 7
Bill Gates state of mind with an automatic weapon
You might remember from putting on for the city
Or back when it was on 2, going for the 50
Opened up a few squares, opened up a few tours
Just to show niggas keys open up doors
“Oh, we don't fuck with Young no more” Why not?
The only thing I can figure, because he on top

Lately, I been often out of sight, seldom out of mind
Ay, getcha bidne' right, and stay the hell up out of mine
I'm out my mind, tryin' to fix it ‘fore I'm out of time
Don't worry 'bout me, God got me, bruh, I'm doin' fine
Another year in prison, promise this is it for me
Tryna make it through the storm, should be makin' history
No feelin' sorry for me, keep ya pity and ya sympathy
Good or bad, take it like a man, whatever meant for me
How I did it make ‘em hate my spirit, they wish they could kill it
And they'll take it however they can get it

And keep sparking, pap pap sleep softly
Yea, nap nap, nap sack, three forties

We done lost everything and you looking like a bargain
Purple weed, purple drink, purple heart sergeant

Everybody woman wanna beat a boy diva, not even
There's a 305 diamond I wanted ever since I seen her
Got a topic of this evening, hotter than a tub steaming
Gotcha girlfriend dreaming of one day being Trina
Notta sim seemer, ten ki's in the Beamer
Got a white girl driving, couldn't do it much cleaner
I'm fly in the sky like that muthafuckin ribbon
Bitches got my name on em, and the nigga still living
Spend a condo and a club, one bottle won't do
Two bottles won't do, bottles for the whole crew, thanks
And bring me that Patrone, I don't play
No ice I like my drink straight, not gay
And bitch that bank come everyday, I'm paid
I wish a nigga come invade, get sprayed
I stomp a nigga out like I got ten legs
Then they fish the nigga up out the lake in ten days
Behave, no ho, I'm on that Rage Rov
Cash Money, Young Money, ho that money age old
And can't a cage hold this animal from Hollygrove
Sorry mommy I be stoned, I be, I be, I be blowed
Got me copy rock star, Weezy Baby fuck these hoes
Gotta pay me now for me to even take these hos
Price sizing for a show and the flow

Keep your mind on your grind and off mine alright
Hard I'm a ball on them squares I float
Quarter million dollar cars everywhere I go
I know in the lead it may see it might be
But no matter what they doing they don't do it like me
Like a G I hold it down for the town I'm at
And I flash like that
Recognize I'm back!
Strike a match catch a fire

Any moment I decide that's enough of all your lies
Boy your buzz just died
Step inside super fly to the shoes in their coupe
Then exit out with all the bitches like we always do
My desire to retire growing every new coupe
Cause these guys just don't ride like mi nigga you too
Tight jeans, funny hair, cause dancing on the screen
It's about the real niggas in the game so it seems
Just pretending holla pimpin' get a sh-t a black eye eye
Next he say he trapping in my head I'm like why
Be yourself, you ain't gotta pimp bone in your body
I can tell ya ain't never bought a key or caught a body
Nigga probably just seen Wayne, Gucci Mane, Me and Boosie all go to prison
And they flip their whole image nigga tripping
Listen, do for you that ain't in the cars
Think the power is in your gun but over all it's in your heart
Nowadays I don't know whats up with niggas in the A
Guess he think he in the game but he really in the way
Violating, I was having conversations in the joint
But guess who done it and I promised I would put you on point
I'm disappointed in you dog you ain't hold it down at all
But I ain't going in your jaw just gon' show ya how to ball
Standin' tall through the storm on the yard or in the dorm
Cats in prison who expecting me to represent for em

I never let you down I'm a shine on sight
Keep your mind on your grind and off mine alright
Hard I'm a ball on them squares I float
Quarter million dollar cars everywhere I go

And I flash like that
Recognize I'm back!
Strike a match catch a fire

Catch a fire see T.I add gas
Whats a Molotov cocktail to never break a glass
Scary ass nigga wanna come for me you better bring it
I ain't mad I forgive em, God I know they ain't mean it
Yeah I seen it all before, hey, I'm popping and they ain't
Rack they brain try to think how to stop it and they can't
Ain't that lame but then that hatred manifest to pure malice
I'm no longer being careless so I'm gon' let you niggas have it
Won't be satisfied till somebody dies and I'm patient
Waiting on me and the reaper on a first name basis now
I'm a let you make it now, stay totally out the way for you
But know that we can take it any place you wanna take it to
Hating in your blood, cause, guess it's just too late for you
All I could do is pray for you or organize a wake for you
Your choice, clearly I ain't hearing your voice
Keep it up and I'm gon' send your ass to '
Hey, you can the bottom partner I'm gon' bring the sky box
I got shit locked down nigga why stop now
I'm so above you hover over suckers why drop down

Like Ali got, I got tha title back, prepare for that

When the world needed to ask where he was at
But when he need somethin' back, fade to black
Talking behind his back, you a hater for that
I don't expect nothin' less in the game of chess

You think five moves ahead and not behind
Jumped up, cheered when I got my time
Like yeah, one whole year I got in the grind
But get me losin' off your mind

Shawty, may I remind you that there ain't another
Who done been through what I been through
Time after time again you better get some in you
When you said it was over for him
And you thought he couldn't continue to floss

Right now we all thinkin', damn hopin' not mine
But when it's lights out for you and you're locked down
Ain't no tellin' whether or not your lady when and got down

With that crawl town 'cause he hot now
Rippin' up your love letters, liftin' up her night gown
Right now somebody baby momma gettin' piped down
Kids in the next room listenin', momma pipe down

The thought hurt, don't it? But maybe she's strong enough for it
Or ain't get that lonely 'cause you wasn't gone long enough

This ain't no equality
Man you ain't have no justice on your mind when you shot at me
But fuck it, this the way it gotta be
Hey listen, you won't shoot at them then shoot at me?
Boy you are not a G
Imagine Trayvon askin' why you followed me
Feel threatened, hit him and whip him, that’s when he shot him down
Do that to a grown fuckin' man, drop where you stand
Tell my grandma go on with all that prayin'
If it's a God and he in the sky, he looking down, he understand
I'm just a man, and I'm wrong for revenge
But I don't get 'em it's like tellin' him to gon' kill again
Keep fucking around, it’s going to be on in a minute

Boy we livin' in a war zone

This goes to the white boy that ran in the old church
I hope you get slow murked, and they torture you slow first
Ran in our place of worship to slaughter our grandma
Won't go kamikaze for that, well what would you die for?
Hold up, I'll wait, I'll wait
Heard it from buddy who took for the fall for Watergate
The war on drugs was just a war on us
Give us all these guns, give us all this dust
Change all them laws, lock all of us up
Went from Freeway Ricky, on to BMF (Free Meech)
Then hip hop came, that's when we got rich
'Cause white kids gravitated to it like all us did
And that's when they got slick
Invented the technology to take our shit
Diluted all of the artistry
Pardon me, somebody tell me what happened to Alton
Sterling, killed Philando right in front of the girl
And the world saw
Everybody's reaction was, ""Hell naw""
This modern day slavery, the prison publicly traded
And the jig's up
The Constitution and Emancipation Proclamation's just a fuckin' piece of paper

Can't you see we livin' in a war zone?

We will not live on our knees, we will die on our feet
This ain't no lie that I speak
All you youngin's out here in the streets only want to shoot people who look like you
You can stay home, you too weak
Oh no, we will not go and repeat the mistakes of the past
Ignorin' the snakes in the grass

We sick of the garbage you kickin' and teachin'
And lynchin' us, lockin' us up for no reason
And killin' us, no consequences, convictions, you serious?
Lyin' about what you show in the media
Assassinate all the leaders who leadin' us
Leave us with ones who misleadin' us
Then go and reward all the ones who mistreat us
And leave us in projects and give us these poisonous products
On top of narcotics to push to our sisters and brothers
Like them ain't our sisters and brothers
No we will not be run amuck, led astray
Or bamboozled, the buck'll be stoppin' today
See what happen when athletes'll no longer play for you
Tell them accountants to pray for you
On respect or just respect what that paper'll do
Look up, it too late for you
Droppin' you off
Turnin' them profit to loss
When we won't go shop in the mall
United we all, stuck in this bullshit together
Showin' these folk we just won't take whatever
Or else they just roll up and shoot at whatever
Just like they've been doin' forever
The niggas swear they hard be huffin' and puffin'
But ain't gon' do nothin'
The enemy try 'em
They wait behind enemy lines
Why you tryna be so friendly now?
Handle your business now
And we won't fear nothin' but judgement from God
Standin' there lookin' at me sayin' you ain't do nothin'
I bless you when you ain't invested in nothin'
Just kept up the cycle of death and destruction
Ignornin' you neighbor won't help him but helpin' yourself
Just like the devil himself, hmm
Promote all that fornication
All that baby makin', ain't no baby raisin'

At the gates on the day I was released
The only time you will ever see me free
Big money J, much as you can get for it?
Atlantic records say just make another hit for me
I tell 'em cut a hundred million dollar check for me
Like it or not, don't lose no respect for me
Never mind what I did, cause the best commin'

T.I.,"Bartender I really did it this time
Broke my parole to have a good time
When I got home it was 6 A.M.
The door was locked so I kicked it in
She was tripping on the bills,
I think she was high on some pills
She through my shit out into the yard
Then she called me a punk and slapped me real hard
And in my drunken stupor I did
What I should of never done
Now I am sitting here talking to you
Drunk and on the run

[Chorus]
I sitting at the bar on the inside waiting on my ride on the outside
She broke my heart at the trailer park so I jacked her keys to her fucking car
And crashed that piece of shit and stepped away

You know Moe, I'll probably get ten years
So just give me beers until they get here
Yeah I know the sun is coming up
And y'all are probably getting ready for closing up
But I'm trying to drown my soul
I am tired of this life on a dirt road,
And everything that I love is gone
And I'm tired of hanging on
She got me sitting at the bar

[Chorus]

Guess it was meant to be romance
Is misery so much for memories
And now I am heading to the penitentiary
See me on TV the next cop series
I am a danger I guess I should have did something about my anger
But I never learn, real things I don't concern
I pour kerosene on everything I love and watch it burn
I know it's my fault but I wasn't happy it was over
She threw a fit so I crashed that piece of shit

And now I am going back again
Back to the pen to see my friends
When we all pile up on that county van
They'll ask me where I've been
I've been at a bar on the inside

T.I.,"They say love blind, so why can't I picture this girl mine?
Yea I dig her but I figure, I'm wasting this girl time
I'm running from relationships, scared to commit
Mad at monogamy, sexually, I'm a misfit
But this shit's, way too much fo me
Usually I can take'em and make'em a cut buddy
Yo mama probably see me, and say that I'm no good
I was born in the burbs, I was raised in the hood
We from two separate sides of life, two different backgrounds
Shawty been legit and I just started to rap now
I ain't tryin' to act now, I'm being real with you
Really, I just wanted to kick it and chill with you
But the picture got bigger, 'fo I could even paint it
Thoughts got deeper befo' a nigga could think
A player like me on this, strange ain't it?
One thing bout yo feelins is this, you can't change it
Yo perception on me, I don't think I can maintain
We flirting with disaster, this game we playing is dangerous
You the best thing that happened since I don became famous
But sometimes I think we should of remained strangers

I, I chose you baby
(Stay with me now, stay with me, sing it for me shawty)
I, I, I, I, I chose you baby
(Ah, come on, uh, uh, uh see'mon)

I like you to pursue, but still I respect it to let it go
Give it time, give it room to breathe and let it grow
I'll just tell her when I'm ready to change, I'll let her know
Hate to say it, but til then be friends and nothing mo
Even though another time, another life, anotha place
I swear I know we could of been great
But rather than great, you lil' heart take the smile of yo face
So I can treat you right, I'm willing ta wait
And ain't shit fake, I know it sound funny coming from a felon
But I think I got a piece of was up in heaven
So to keep from, blocking mah blessings, think I better back up
Last thing a nigga need now is bad luck
But if my life was perfect shawty, I'da had her
I guess, I guess I don't deserve it, ballas tell me you ain't worth it

I ain't tricking shit but I might spend some dough on yo ass
The way you bouncing on my dick and grindin' slow wit yo ass
Hit the v.i.p. wit me I po' some moe' fo yo ass
Just so I can see you out there bouncing yo ass
If I leave the club wit something rather go wit yo ass

In a crowd full of hoes I would notice yo ass

Just so I can get out there and grind her ass
Wit yo fine ass, must I remind yo ass?

I made this song to let you know shit that I see ya when you working that ass
Make a nigga think later on he gone be twerkin' that ass
And I can tell by the way you throw it back it ain't no hurting that ass
And ain't no room for nothing else in that skirt but that ass
The jiggling shawty, got a nigga shivering shawty
And if you don't know what to do wit you better give it here shawty
Put a bend in her back, I'm throwing the dick she giving it back
I tell her if you ever give me that ass I ain't giving it back
She bouncing her ass, later on I'm a blow a ounce wit her ass
Ride out wit her ass, cut somethin' on the couch wit her ass
Then bounce to her pad, cause you know it ain't no housing her ass

While you slanderin', you better ask ya girl who the man again
Turning out a superstar back into a fan again
Damagin' all who peek, line 'em all in the street
I'll do 'em one at a time wit' one line on one beat
Say ya almost gold, that's what I sold in one week
Got a flock of freaks, while you hold on to one biich
I'm like a Pez dispenser, shawty, I spit treats
The nigga who even sound good on a bullshit beat

[Chorus: x2]

Well pussy nigga, you can like it, you can love it
You can bite it, you can dub it
But you can't do it how we does it
When we ballin' in public
Where the grill full of gold or Seville full of hoes
Wood wheels and some Voe's or hun'ed gold spokes
I park at the club and a hun'ed hoes choke
Spark up some dubs, let them hun'ed hoes blow
I run game to get the hoe once they act like I can't run it no mo'
I stunt them hoes broke and her money po' po'
You can't smoke the way we smoke if you ain't smokin' no dro'
Drink the way we drink wit no Hen' and no Mo'
You can't ride the way we ride if you ain't slamming Benz do's
Can't ball wit' me if you got eight but can only spend fo'
You ain't VIP like me and can't be searching your coat
Ain't no P.I. like me if you ain't workin' no hoes
Can't do the shit we do, the way we do wit' no dough
That's like trying to win a ballgame, if you ain't takin no score

Hey, you 'member that broad we met back on the road last year, bout '99?
(The one up in NYC?)
Nah, nah, not the one from New York, I 'memba her too doe
I'm talking bout the one from L.A.
Lil bad bitch I met in the mall wit the big ass
(Oh, oh, that bitch)
Here what she said
(Whats up?)

[Chorus]
I'll meet you at the hotel, we can fuck all night
Do me how you want to, I won't tell nobody
(Shit, let's do it, where you at?)
I said, meet me at the hotel, we can fuck all night
Do me how you want to, I won't tell nobody
(Shit baby, keep yo mouth shut we can do it, sho nuff)

[T.I.]
One day in L.A., I'm at the mall
Picking me up a couple a pairs of silk drawls
And I ran into this fine ass well built broad
She was in hard from a long way
So I'm finna go on swing shawty way
Just like the song say, 'cause I don't play
Miss lady built like a amazon
A 5'9"", light brown, wit some sandals on
The kinda ass that make you wanna grab a handle on
And fuck her all day in the hallway with the candles on
So I wave, and I speak and conversation coo
She asked my name, where I'm from and why I talk the way I do?
I said ""'cause I ain't from round here, I'm from Atlanta shawty, but anyways
We can still get together, 'cause I'm goin' be here for a couple of days""
And then she say, she never been ta Georgia, she was dyind ta visit
Well, I'm in room 312, at the Sofatel, I'm sho that they listed
She got the digits, say she like me, and that we can be friends
If I ain't welcome shawty, don't invite me, ain't no need ta pretend
I'm wanna lick on ya neck, kiss ya ears, and make yo knee bend
Put ya ass in positions you never thought you'd be in
Now, I'm telling you shawty, fucking wit me, like divin of deep end
Have you sneeking, creeping in Georgia, freak on the weekend

This time, it was me n KP, in NYC
On some Quevo and Hennessy, and 2 sweets with two freaks
Some of the baddest things in Times Square wit some long hairz, cute feet
One of 'em say she wanna drive me to Coney Island so she can show me the new beach
Couldn't nobody ride wit me doe, cause the car only had 2 seats
Lil' cute freak, in the Z3, remind me of one of my hoes in the GC
Told me her name was Sharell but all of her friends call her Cici
Say she up he a going to NYU, but originally she frum DC
Say she'd love ta freak me, reminisce while listening to my CD
Lay me out on the beach feed me strawberries n kiwi
Shawty say she like what she see, can't wait ta get down hea n see me
Round Freaknik, say soon as you hit the city all you gotta do iz beep me
And let me know what its finna be, the Four Seasons or the Embassy
Get a voice mail round 10 ta 3, and then what she said ta me...

I'm having fun, getting pussy on the run
Bitches coming to my room, tryin' to make me cum
In Cleveland last weekend, O-High Hoe, was really going on?
She said ""Stick it down my throat""
A lotta y'all married, to my ex tramps
She shouldn't worry, I sent the bitch to sex camp
Taught her how to fuck, she made you fall in love
I fucked her real tough, now you can't get enough
Knocking on my door for yo hoe, that's no game pimp
I fucked all them bitches DMX was naming
Fucking hoes from Milly, bitches out in Philly

T.I.,"Yeah,
To the ladies,
One mo' message from T.I.P.,
I represent every man in America,
No, the world

You want to know what he what he
Thinkin' bout when he ain't
Talking to you bout why he can't
Be your man you sure you want to know

Here it is

[Verse 1]
My girl say I don't love her
She say we just fuckin'
Nothin' against you 
It's just that I hate tux
She want to toast with the Mo' and the ice
Throwin' the rice
Wake up with me for the rest of your life
Ask me where I'm going,when I'coming back when I bounce
Running her mouth, call herself the queen of the south
Redecorate the crib throwing satin on the couch
Catch me out adulteratin' takin' half of the house
Well it ain't she don't deserve it
Just I don't want to give it
The life she want to live
Shorty I don't want to live it
Makin' money shorty's missin'
To all kind of digits
From KeKe's to Chaniques's
To Bianca's and Brigettes's
Poppin' up unannounced, shorty call 'fore you visit
Nothing about a number, mind your goddamn business
Look bitch, some shit bout Tip won't change
We can hang, but I got to let you know one thang

I can't be your man
It ain't you it's me, sorry shorty
I can't be your man
Where I been, I don't see no rings on these fingers 
I can't be your man
Look to the future, find someone better than me
I can't be your man
You deserve much more, I'm no good to you shorty

[Verse 2]
Don't it seem like shit be cool for a month and a half
All of a sudden you frontin' and showing your ass
Complainin' bout what you got
Shorty look what you had 
Before me, it was pull-out couches and Militant bags
Now she mad cause she ain't got a T.V. in her Jag
I tell you what if that ain't good enough get back on the bus
Give up the princess cuts and the Prada and stuff
I take you out to eat and you order a bottle of what?
Ungrateful wonderin' why I'm not faithful
Ballin's all good but this shit is just wasteful
Want me to pay your bills
Help you get a bigger crib 
Shorty I don't mind helpin'
But show some initiative
Ain't brought nothin' to the table but hard times and heartache
Do something, get on the grind for God's sake
A reminder, rewind this message from your highness
For those that chose to take my kindness for blindness

I can't be your man
I don't cheat cause I ain't shit, 
I'm cheatin' cause you ain't shit
I can't be your man
Every time I walk in the house you sittin' on that goddamn couch
You ain't got nothing better to do
I can't be your man
Cook, clean, iron, pay the water bill, shorty do something 
Work with me
I can't be your man
Ay, pack you shit shorty, I'm droppin yo ass off at yo mami house
Right now

[Verse 3]
One more scenario
Bout another jazzy hoe
That I met on the road
After a show in Ontario
Shorty say she got a man
That don't really scare me though
But she say he got a temper
So, but what he jealous for
Cause you told him you were cheating
Hell, well what you tell him for
Shit, what that got to do with Tip
You better let him know
Now she want to let him go
But what for
So you can get with me and keep being a slut hoe
I don't think so baby better stay where you at
I'm no good for you
Never mind the way that he act
You got a kid and a crib with him
What's better than that
I'm in town for the week you better settle for that

I can't be your man
I'm here for 4 days shorty, 4 days
I can't change the world
I can't be your man
He don't treat you right? 
What that gotta do with me?
I can't be your man
He be cussin' you out and shit
You cheated on him shorty, can you blame him?
I can't be your man
You ain't fend to bring that bullshit to me
I don't want none parts of it
I can't be your man
Look here man
Get that shit out of my face
Kick rocks
I can't be your man
I ain't fend to have nothing to do with it
Their will be none of that round here
I can't be your man
Besides shorty you talk to much
I can't deal with it
I can't be your man
You say you work where
Mickey D, get the hell out of here shorty
Man look ay, I can't deal with it
You got too much baggage with you man
You and little, uh,uh,uh little Opus Cunningham
Y'all kick rocks down the damn street
I can't deal with it shorty
And, complain, what, you ain't got what?
Shorty when I met you shorty you was barefooted
Sittin' on the railroad track with some straw in yo mouth
What the hell you complainin' about what you got now
What nigga you got steak and eggs right here 
I'm saying, what the business is?
Get the hell out of here man
Hey man you need to show me some appreciation round here
You in the damn living room more than the motherfucking furniture shorty
I can't deal with that shit man 
Get a damn job
Do something for me
Lazy bitch, All the bad bitches in the world and I had to hook up
With the sorriest hoe in America
Why don't you take the weight off my back every now and then
Why don't you pay a bill
30 damn dollars, the cable bill ain't but 30 damn dollars shorty
Why don't you change the, flip the mattress

Floss rocks and in the summer keep the top dropped

Cause I got 2 pounds of weed and a 3.80 too
I guess everything'll be alright if I just keep it cool

Farewell bro. mama always told me

From that time you made the bitch eat the apple
To the time you pick your folks
To put us on the boat and enslave us
Worker that never paid us
Killed malcolm x, martin luther king
And everybody else tried to come down here us
Killed my father that raised us
Kidnapped us from our country
Take your distance in our religional way
Well now it's time for the cadet to busted
We want our spirits and our minds back now

Thought hell kicking the devil doors down
Spreading rounds waving cadet rounds
Well I woke up I was lying down shawty

T.I.,"I done been locked up with the worsest of niggas
Armed robbing con men and murderous niggas
The dope boys be the first to deliver
Green, brown, or blow, got mo snow than Buffalo in the winter
Think these lyrics is coming from a pretender
If I said it I done seen it or done it
So I mean it when I say you don't want it
Done came a long way from jumping the hundreds (hundreds)
To bagging them quarters, doing shows from L.A. to Flawda (Florida)
In Atlanta, I'm the law and the order, the king of it
Got a throne and a brougham and a broads that's chrome
Calling houses on the water my home, wit no mortgage or loan
If I live in it I bought it and own it
If I'm wit a bitch I caught her and boned it
No question, no less than a week and she's in confession
And I bought no necklace unless I'm investing
No exceptions, I'll open ya closed session

[Chorus: x2]
You ain't hard til you cooking like this
You ain't mob til you fucked wit the click
Or you flipping them bricks
We make music for the broke and the rich
For the hoop and the 6
For the hustlas went from nothin to G

We hustle from 6 to 6 to 6 again
Sell fat nicks for 10 til the bricks get in
Venturing from ATL to Michigan
The talk of yo town, you ain't even worth mentioning
Peppermint tryin' to get another shipment in
And Sam Goody just hit us on the hip again
Got hot shit under our fits that'll pierce ya skin
And the click I'm in some made men, know that
Got a deal now, but I was the shit before that
Toting steel now, but hold my own with no gat
T.I.P. the answer to the question ""Where them hoes at?""
The heat is catching up to niggas running 4 flat
At the club getting crunker than crackers on Prozac
Say you got some dubs on the Lac? Well shawty where the vogues at?
T.I.P. ain't the shit? come on shawty, don't act
I'm the hottest thing ever flowed over 24 tracks

[Chorus: x2]

Some niggas wonder how I made it, I do what it takes
At school I was cool wit the nigga who threw a 22 in ya face
Took ya starter coat and choked ya til you blue in the face
Or you might know me as the nigga who fucked ya bitch and bust 2 in her face
Either way, I'm a winner like the 4 and the trey
You probably never held mo dough than I can blow in a day
Sometimes I'm wearing gold, sometimes I'm riding on it
Between us, I doubled up off my signing bonus
K.P. and Jay say ""Shawty, hey you going legit""
But I ignored the shit, when I scored a brick
I bet you never knew how quick 36 O's'll flip
Yeah I cook it til it bubble up, see how quick it double up
Competition's in trouble I'm supplying the hood
Born, bred, when I'm dead, I'ma die in the hood
Niggas be trying the hood, I open fire in the hood
Shut 'em up, wet 'em up, and let 'em lie in the hood

Beatin so hard

To get a rim posted corner
Call me 10 G's
The same as the Chevy platinum emblem on my keys
Wit the diamond against the trim
A young ass nigga wit a Louis V rim
A sporty young shorty wit the Gucci shades dim
These hoes mistaken me for being they pimp
They said baby couldn't see you pass them shiny rims

Heat it up like a cook out

Spillin liquor, yeah nigga
Blowin tall off the wall
Burning rubber leavin foul

Choppin blades wit triple golds
Stay away from camilton rolls

Diggin up ya grass
Drag racin four fifty four

And I mash on it in a flash
Throw it in the gutter
Buy another if it crash

Hit the store then for some more Hen (Hey Dub)

",Heavy Chevy's,2001
T.I.,"I was in love wit him since I was 12
By age 14 I was just catching hell
He was the star of the football team
Other girls wanted to fulfill his dreams
I was too young too scared too insecure
All of the love in my heart was so pure
This was until I had just turned 16
That was the night he tried to get in my jeans

What should I say
When I didn't want to push him away
But I was scared to give up my thing
When all along I knew he had waited for so long to see
If I was gonna give him all of me
But that's where I wanted to be
But then again 
I remember the talk I had with my friends

[Chorus]
Oh no if you swing an episode
I just hope it ain't a fiasco
Sometimes boys can treat you so ghetto
And I don't want to say I told you so
Oh on
If you swing an episode
I just hope it ain't a fiasco
Sometimes boys can treat you so ghetto
And I don't want to say i told you so

After that first situation had past
It was this guy I had sat by in class
He was the type that made you wonder about
How he got down cause he did talk a lot
So we hooked after school one day
Went on some dates and we spent spring break
Together and then one night at his spot
While watching T.V. things got real hot
What should I do cause I had already took off my shoes
And I didn't want to seem to loose
Though deep inside I was contemplating giving him a try
Cause he seemed absolutely perfect for me
But after wards what would he think
Here we go again
I remember the talk i had with me friends

[Chorus: x2]",Fiasco,2001
T.I.,"Shit, I'm a changed man, ay, turn the lights out
Big baller 2Pac up in this bitch
Y'know how we swing this shit, look

By age sixteen I sold to dope fiends
Not yet a drug dealer, but I watched 'em closely
Until they noticed me I got the feds wonderin' who broke the law
Far too inhibited for gunsmoke, I broke his jaw

Words harder than a fuckin' diamond
Mobile phone call to Simon, niggaz trippin' homey, when we ridin'?
Fuck them slowly like Jodeci
And stick a needle in my eye if I don't live and die for M O B

And fuck your homeboys nigga we can drop the guns
I hit your block and we can box for fun
Nigga one on one, last to fall is a baller cat
It's Death Row, why the fuck you think we call it that?

So if you knew me in my past life
Don't act like we homeboys, ain't no love in the fast life
I switch gears on them jealous bitches, who do you fear?
The gameplan of a changed man, so what I'm sayin' is

I changed plans but I'm still the same old rider
(Fuckin' with a changed man)
I slang a new dope to the world but the people still buy it
(Nigga you fuckin' with a changed man)

All my real thug niggaz, go and get your hands up
You go and drink the Henn' up
(You fuckin' with a changed man)
Changed man, you're dealin' with a changed man

In drop top, the glock cocked, got rocks in my socks
Cops spot Watt niggaz but hardly stop niggaz
Not if they got niggaz, doughboys and hot niggaz
Who mighta shot niggaz but only by strugglin'

I'm for respect nowadays they expect me
To be in a Ferrari or the old SL
Or anything you see flashin' past and can't catch
Dat's me, gauge on the Escalade back seat

Don't creep, oh what you think, T I P and them sweet?
Don't sleep, get you hit from your head to your feet
And you don't know me, I'm fin' ta introduce you to the old me
You walk in, exploded and leave reload

You don't like a rugged nigga, fuck you, blow me
But you will respect me or get it in your neck piece G
No three niggaz here are gonna let me be
Or get you inside there's codes to the streets nigga

I changed plans but I'm still the same old rider
(Your fuckin' with a changed man)
I slang a new dope to the world but the people still buy it
(Nigga you fuckin' with a changed man)

All my real thug niggaz, go and get your hands up
You go and drink the Henn' up
(You fuckin' with a changed man)
Changed man, you're dealin' with a changed man

A nigga so cold when I flow, bow down to Death Row
Three wheel motion, comin' through coastin'
Who's that nigga in the G-ride screamin' out “M O B”
Nigga we ride

I hit the charts like a stick-up kid
Number 1 in the nation, I fucked the world
The Judge gave me probation, faced with incarceration
Move tapes like it's big weight, slangin to, the whole nation

Gimme nine, or I'm blastin' on every song
Murder my enemies, I'm mashin' until I'm gone
One love to my thug niggaz and fuck a bitch
'Cause a true sister love niggaz

Throw yo' hands in the air, close your eyes and hope
Never come against the massive smoke on Death Row
My adversaries bleed but fuck 'em all
'Til the talk cease, fuckin' with a changed man

I changed plans but I'm still the same old rider
(You fuckin' with a changed man)
I slang a new dope to the world but the people still buy it
(Nigga you fuckin' with a changed man)

All my real thug niggaz, go and get your hands up
You go and drink the Henn' up
(You fuckin' with a changed man)
Changed man, you're dealin' with a changed man
(Nigga you fuckin' with a changed man)

Everybody think they understand me
Shit, you niggaz don't know me
Y'all know that nigga on the rap song
Y'all know that nigga in the movies
You don't know this nigga in 3-D
Real live right up against you in front of yo' face
Shit, nigga you fuckin with a changed man

Westside, Outlaw Immortalz, hehehe
Nigga, you fuckin' with a changed man
Hahaha, you fuckin' with a changed man
Hahaha, I ain't the same, you fuckin' with a changed man
We ain't the same, you fuckin' with a changed man

You say you were so sick of it
I'm tired of jackin' off cause you ain't there

65 Cevrolet Ipala peachy cream
Cruisin' down the street like two fingers
Cause the ivory is clean
Talkin' 'bout meetin' at the MC room
On the inside of the ship
Not a honey dip to hunt on
Cause she mobile than a grip
Or the Blue Man Group
Caught out on the Vegas Strip
Tell em' a good game, juju pimpin'
Give em' to my nigga Dime Legit
Boss lips, legs, arms, necks
Hip dips, hair net, mo' stretch
It's a camel toe and thats fo' sho
My brain is on one track
Like Mary Mary toss for crackle like a rock star does for smack
None of that but the female genatalia's where it's at
I'm a man and I demand a WO-man for that act
Personal preference cause I use the law of nature as a reference
No I don't ever recall seein' a man turn up pregnant
But that's just me
From them female fantasies frolic freely
In my cock pit, every 30 some seconds I can't stop it

Heffers call me Black-N-Decker, I don't screw them hoes I drill
I've been cuttin' cute lil' coochies since before the record deal
Catch me daydreamin' 'bout them, thick, medium, or slim
Doctors call the thing vagina, in the hood we call it trim
White boys call it snatch, Puerto Ricans call it chocha
Nathaniel likes his white, I like mine dark as cola
It's the first thing on my mind in the morn' when I roll over
All men young or old in the end it's what we after
Even my grandpappy's happy, he got prescribed Viagra

Grandaddy, grandaddy what's happenin'
What's up, what's up this me
Hey let me get about three of them blue diamonds
I promise I got you tomorrow

When I drill, I don't spill, even if she's on the pill
Keep my weapon covered, concealed, and in a shield
Cause I dont need that A-I-D-S
A D and an A missin' out my ADIDAS
PLUS, We don't need no DNA mixin' between us
We just need to keep this thing friendly and hush hush
On the down low, like R. Kelly and youngsters
But over eighteen only cause baby I'm no perv
From the tour bus to the lobby, elevator to the room
We can jump each others bones but there's no jumpin' brooms

Buffoon you are too consumed in the womb
It is too early for you to jump the broom, BOOM

(All day I dream about...)
(All day I dream about sex)
The way you move your sexy groove
I've got my mind all over you
(All day I dream about...)

In a drop top Chevy with the roof wide open
My partners looking at me to see if my eyes open
Cause I've been dranking, and I've been smoking
Flying down 285 but I'm focused
Four fifty four's, I race Porsches
White leather seats, as fresh as Air Forces
Doing bout a hundred but the track still bumping
Number 8 on N.W.A., ""Straight Outta Compton""
Pull up at your apartment sitting on 20 somethings
And the dope boys holling ""what's happening"", kid running in
The clicks start dancing and the broads start choosing
And the cars been parked but the rims keep moving
Sign pictures by the hundred, to the youngins in the hood
Cause I ain't Hollywood, I come from the hood
I'm used to it, if your rear view shaking and your seats vibrating
24 inch Dayton's got the Chevrolet shaking

Been paying my dues since eighty-nine, trying to get my cheese
Diamonds gleam when I'm on the scene, they know its me
Ain't no dream or no fantasy (bitch) it's T-I-P
Brought busting, like a baby do a blanket
Five karat VVS's on my motherfucking pinkie
Half of Hennessy and Belvedere
What we drinking, pimp squad send for broads
What the hell you niggas thinking
Young nigga spending weekends on the islands in the fall
24 inch rim shining when I'm riding cause I'm balling
I'm calling out shots like a pool shark
My tools spark in the dark when I fool marks
Y'all fools hearts in the wrong place at the wrong time
I got a strong mind to grab my chrome nine
And shoot at your ass for a long time
But I'm a get that ass hauled off, fuck around with the click
They'll be looking for your dick wit a stick

Keep on talking folk, I'll lay you on your back right now
Want ta act right now, get smacked right now
I'm a buck a motherfucker, I don't know to back down
Clown down here faking, fronting
Talking bout what you making, nothing
I'm 21 and 10 years deep, that shit to me ain't nothing

But either way I'm tryin' to move a hundred dimes in a day
They sat that crime don't pay, but I'm gone stay on the grind in the A
With the same ole J's
I know the lames gone say that I done changed no way 
I'm in the gutta everyday tryin' t slang mo ya
In the middle of the trap, we hang the dro blaze
Niggas in the trap ain't changed in 4 days
Waiting on a page that saying the blow came
Instead of us just finding mo ways to get paid
Anyway, in the fire, I done been there homey
Niggas ball, niggas die and ain't shit fair homey
Dem crackers give ya some time and get to sit there homey
My niggas dying, I'll see ya when I get there homey
Hey, Born alone, die alone in life

When these haters speak yo name man burn dey tongue
Neva be ashamed of how ya live or where ya from
You stack a mill, niggas will see how far you come
Without a gun, you got somethin'll make 'em bar you son
That's a million dollar mind, why, these niggas is dumb
Yea they goin, get outta line, but these niggas is scum
They outta sight and outta mind 'til you visit the slum, stay down
Stay on the grind and yo digits'll come, bottom line
You gotta shine no matter what you become
These streets is 40 percent of yo mind and 5 percent muscle
10 struggle, 10 time, and 35 percent hustle
And trust if they don't burry the scared, they burry the dead
When anticipating pistol play, be very prepared
And if you ain't, find somewhere to burry yo head
Because them hot ones from the choppas tear ya body to shreds

And I'ma grind it out, even if I'm dying it out

That man right there, but ain't goin' be when they start finding out
That that bullshit you be talking ain't the real deal
That ain't you blow, them ain't yo cars so how you really live
See what you need to do is take a chilly-willy pill
Go and chill yo ass out, for they deal yo ass out
A bad hand from a mad man, in a mad clan
All them other niggas take a fall you goin' take the last stand
Gnawed in, sawed in, how everybody ball
When everybody else is all in you don't know where to fall in?
Need some Flaw Henn, I'm telling you shawty
And don't be buying none of that bullshit selling you shawty
And all that other shit they talking is irrelevant shawty

Pleasure and pain in every aspect of the game
I'm the answer to yo prayers if you prayin' for change
So, I dare you compare us and say we the same
When I'm, climbin' the ladder, they stuck in the same
Mind frame, they accomplishments are nothin' to gain
Eventually, see I'm outta yo range
Except this rose gold glow from my wrist and my chain
I entertain young niggas who slang
Like a picture, no frame, see it's simple and plain

I been plottin' since kindergarten, you's a lame to me
I give the niggas what they came to see
A reflection of one self where they aim to be
As you can see it ain't no change in me
And you won't meet another nigga off the chain as me
I'm so fly, no lie, don't deny it, ya feel it
So inspired by my style, decided to try it yourself
Bet you won't, meet nobody ranked as high as myself
The checks you waitin' on, homes, I can sign them myself

Through the streets of the westside, I slap five

T.I.,"Hey I'm working here, know what I'm saying
Try to put yourself in my shoes for a second
Its not personal I'm just saying though

Hey look
From when the moon came out 'till the sun came up
I was supplying the days when where they flame up
Our mamas passing, by trying to explain us
Pissing in the bushes like they never house trained us
But, try to understand that's how we came up
You get to know us, you'll love us but you can't change us (naw)
Really we rather be rich and famous
But in the mean time were forced to slang dust
'Dro or crack cocaine, Penicillin to Rogaine
Ecstacy, Viagra, whatever'll get the dough man
I'm tired of people mis-representing my dough man
Oh you think we out here killing for nothing, hustling
For no gain (picture that)

Hey man I'm just doing my job
Hey lady, don't mind me I'm just doing my job
I don't want to make your life more harder, I'm just doin my job
You live here, I work here I'm doing my job

I don't know if you don't know, don't care or can't see
Every time something up in the hood, it ain't me
And I ain't always up to no good and know the crease
And we ain't always gotta pass through the hood without speaking (how you doing)
We ain't out here threatening your lives, raping your children
We just out here staying alive, making a million (you know)
Working hard, trying to survive chasing a mill-ion
You hear us talking loud, just think of this is chameleon
React to the situations, but accusations is still
We vulgarizing you how, hey man you just hurting my feelings (man).
We got lives, we want to live nice too
We got moms, dads, wives, kids just like you
But our options are few it hell in high school
When your helping with the rent lights and the gas bill too
So before you go judging us loving us won't hurt
Yeah under 25, staying alive is hard work

Hey man I'm just doing my job
Hey lady, don't mind me I'm just doing my job
I don't want to make your life more harder, I'm just doin my job
You live here, I work here I'm doing my job

And for you to see what I'm saying, open eyes will help
If you could think about somebody besides yourself
Why you pointing fingers at me, analyze yourself
Quit all that chastising and try to provide some help
Instead of calling the law, you busting my balls
With all due respect, we don't even need to be fucking with y'all (man)
And we can't help it cause it is like this
We don't like it no more than you that we live like this
Always stuck in the grind summertime to wintertime
Cutting school to sell fifty dimes by dinner time
See everything we know we learned from the streets
Since thirteen I've been hustling and earning my keep

Look, I'm this far from being a star and just that close to quitting
I never should of came close to missing
But I want to be a musician pimping not a politician
Listen, feel my position it's a rough transition
Plus I'm way too deep in the game to be trying to change
For fortune and fame and glamor I can be in the slammer
Or six feet up under Atlanta
It's a blessing to breathe
I walk the streets with seven felonies I'm blessed to be free
Long as somebody up in heaven who keep blessing a G
T.I.P. will still be blessing CD's
So haters you can see these
Cause I'm back now with something to prove
Everything to gain pimping nothing to lose
I ought to start smacking niggas when it's nothing to do
They too big shoot them in the leg and even the odds
Cause you ain't hard
Unless you ran with Cap and see-Rod
Trapped with K.T. and robbed with J.R
Fucked hoes with D.P
Broke bread with J.G
Switched labels like K.P
Who the fuck did all that, pimp?
Me, even though I'd rather go back to slanging drugs and shit
It's a gang of niggas and bitches really love this shit
I can't quit

Even though polices hate I'm legit
And rappers hate it cause they know I'm the shit
Hell no I can't quit

Most of them hate it cause I'm fucking they bitches
No pimping I can't quit
Some niggas hating on the rocks and the rings
Some of them hate cause they know I'm the King
Hell no I can't quit
People hate it when you better than them
They ain't hating start worrying then
Aye I'm winning I can't quit

[Verse Two]
It's been ten years a album and two deals
For real we all know I should have sold two mill, at least
It's all good though I flow for the streets
I do it for y'all
Every weekend see who in the mall
Still in the trap signing your shirts giving you dap
Kicking it with you then get you and your folk in the club
Posing for pictures with girls
Give them kisses and hugs
Pouring out liquor at shows
Passing niggas the dro
One of the realest rappers niggas will know
But niggas be hating
To the point that they be calling the station ?Don't play his record?
But they respect it cause I'm ready and focused
And I see they petty and bogus
I want you to know this
But most of you know this
Niggas in the game ain't real
Gotta stay selling records cause the fame ain't shit
And fuck the units that they name will sell
It'll break your heart to see your favorite rappers lame as hell

[Verse Three]
Some of the people some of the times pick with rhymes
But they may not like one of the lines
I'll tell you what
I'll let you criticize me one at a time
Those of you who think I'm too cocky get in front of the line
Whether you don't like my ego or my arrogant flow
Don't like that when you say I'm tight I say I already know
Don't like how I was talking shit before my album could blow
Thinking I need to calm it down be like the average Joe
So, fuck you, them thoughts, and that little house you think I'm in
Get a Benz I'll value your opinion then
Think I give a fuck how many time my record spin
Fuck what you recommend
I'm back again! (Look pimping)
I can't quit

Knew I could loose it all but never thought of losin' you
Eleven years ago I still regret me choosin' you
Meetin' you, pursuin' you and doin' you in '92
You fixed plates, showed yo face at every courtdate
And all you wanted me to do was call when I was out late
How could I let you go? I thought I knew it all
When you deserved the best and more, you been through it all
You think I sold yo dreams, but what I say I mean
Just take it to consideration, I was 17
I'm still the same man, just had a change of plan
Never ask you back and fuck a wedding band

On the realest shit I ever dropped, dissin' pops
I never even thought, to ask my mom what happened
Just knew that you was livin' in Manhattan and I was trappin'
We never had a chance, we was in different states
But all forgiven, you was human and we make mistakes
You tried to make it up, but shit, you couldn't pay enough
You sent me tons of toys and clothes thinkin' you gave enough
But it wasn't though, and you wasn't there
That's all I knew, so I grew up thinkin' you ain't care
I know it wasn't fair, but ay, it wasn't fun
But now what's done is done, no matter wha, I'm still yo son
I could care less if none of yo other children come
I'ma be right there prayin' you live to be a million one
Finally I understand, hustlin', livin' fast
Tryin' to get the cash and settle down and be a dad
You probably never knew, 'cause hey, I never said it
But pops, I'm just like you, I'm stubborn and I'm hardheaded
But now you dead in the ground, no meanin' tellin' you now
But all I wanted was for you to be proud
I still love you

How could I criticize my daddy on that last verse
Lookin' at my own dirt, you got some nerve
But be that as it may, I got some shit to say
It's been a secret, I can't keep it for another day
I got a lil' girl, not just two lil' boys
And that's been killin' me inside, eatin' me alive
And I can't find the words, nor the nouns or verbs
To express what you deserve, girl you worth the world
But I'm a man and I ain't perfect, if you hear me now
I'll tell you wha had happened, when, why, where and how
Me and yo mama met, we kinda kicked it off
But we wasn't 'posed to have a baby, we just chillin' out
We had a lot in common, almost the same signs
Same goals, said things at the same time
But then we destroyed the situation like the a changed mind
How could I look her in her eyes and holla ""Dat ain't mine""
Her stomach gettin' bigger, and time is gettin' close
Six, seven, eight, nine months and I ain't told mah folks
Not just messiah mama, hell, I had told yo granny
Three kids in two years, baby, daddy panicked
But I ain't ashamed of you, I'm more ashamed of me
It's not at all yo fault, you'd be better off blamin' me
But now I realize, where the problem lies
Forgive me babygirl, I apologize
And I still love you

Since menace to society
Still refused to become a legitimate citizen quietly

I might be back to slangin' grams any day
And if this record flop
Well I'll be--back
Wit' a bomb of heart
Wit' see-Rod and the squad
This whole industry's a façade
Man this ain't real life
Half these rappers don't know what sacrifice feel like
Man these niggas is all hype
Not even rappin' on real mics

Well shawty you ain't nice
Regardless of your publishing deal
You can't write
I'm the best thing left blowin' breath on the mic
The king of the south
Nothin' else will suffice
You want to bet?
Well put yo' budget up
Match the price
Me and you like putting matches to ice
You won't make it
Before I had a deal
I was still butt naked
God signed this, like keeping' the Lord's promise
The truth nigga

And couldn't outsell me

Niggas like you, a dime a dozen
They come and go
So why I'm runnin' now
And I ain't never run before
Grab choppers, cock 'em and blow
Stoppin' the show
Bet or owe 'em, droppin' the hoes
You just keep watchin' the door
Pop 'em, watch 'em drop to the floor
Fluff his pockets and go
Put a quarter block on his nose
And a glock in his clothes
He can keep his watches and gold
For his momma to hold
She'll be there buyin' the hoes
Before the drama unfolds
They know shawty outta control
Got me hot as a stove
Puttin' holes in yo' Girbaud
Wettin' up yo' polos
44's and Callico's
A black and a chrome
Lettin' loose and splackin' your dome
Hoppin' back in the Brougham
Known for kickin' in yo' door
Wavin' gats in yo' home
Clearin' it out

T.I.,"[Intro]
Want to be your man, please, tell you why
(I know what y'all thinking)
Doop doop doop doop doop doop
(First he can't be my man, now he want to be my man)
(I wish this nigga make his mind up)
Can't live my life, tell you why
(All my niggas man we gonna have be 21 bout this shit you know)
Oh baby, oh baby
(We gonna step out the track for one sec, one sec)

[Verse 1]
Now what I got to say, seal with a kiss
Know I can't be your man why I feel like this
What I need with a woman when I live like this
Different chicks running in and out the crib like this
Maybe five, maybe six, seven, eight'll be enough
Plus the twins make ten but for you I give it up
Set times to the side just for us to live it up
Walking out a rav farm, purple label linen up
It's hard for me to discuss what I had vision for us
Lots of trust, and a crib worth a couple million plus
So what if I got a pass, labeled a dirt bag
By the minute, hearts I broken and women I hurt bad
Might I add Christian Dior and fur jackets
A part of the pack, but still far from a marriage
It's easy to lose balance when hearts just start caring
With the attractions apparent, its hard to stop staring

[Chorus]
Hey baby let me tell you something, come here I need to tell you something
(Tell you why)
Hey shorty let me tell you something, want to talk need to tell you something
(doop doop doop doop doop doop doop)
Lil mama let me tell you something, I want to tell you something
(Cant live my life, without you)
Hey baby let me tell you something, Shorty I've been meaning to tell you something
(Oh baby, oh baby)

[Verse 2]
If I can get a little bit of your time, shorty
I got some shit I want to get out my mind, and I know
You get enough of niggas hollering ya fine (hey
Ask, ask ya friend man, man I got this)
Introductions seem to bug you, them partners of mine
My bad, I know you think I'm probably lying
Then I'ma stop to conversate, relates all of ya time, man
Look, but half of that shit is all in ya mind
Say you should follow your heart and I'm follow my mind
But anyway, when I see yo' face
I'm thinking three or four days in Montego Bay
At the Half Moon, but I know she goin' say
I already have too many hoes, I know
But if I had you, all the dough I'd blow
On eleven karat pink stones trillion row
I want to be the reason why you showing ya teeth
Without a worry in the world when you rolling with me

Hey, let's get away and get a room on the other side of town
Hey shawty, I was feenin' for you
(Was you thinkin' of me, hey, hey)
Hey, let's get a room, shawty we can freak somethin' if you down
(What you would do?)
Hey daddy, I was feenin' for you

Bet they be like ""I know he tired of the nightlife
He want a wife, he just lookin' for the right type""
Yea right, I be ridin' through the city lights
My hat bent, gettin' high behind the 'lac tint
I'm chilllin' with Brazilian women, heavy accents
They black friends translatin', got 'em all ass naked, adjacent
Have relations with 'em many places
Leavin' semen in they British faces
Make'em kiss they partners with it in they faces
Young pimpin' sprung women 'cross the 50 states
Got young ladies requestin' ""What's Yo Name"" on 50 stations
Askin' me what's a pussy popper, want a demonstration
But I ain't waitin' til the second date, I'm so impatient
Relieve'em of they aggravation, take'em rollerskatin'
On them Dayton's, tell'em ""Baby, stick with me, you goin' places""
Go replace'em, draw erase'em out my memory
Moist panties and wet sheets when they think of me

[Chorus]

Yo, yo, uh,
From Miami to Cali, from Vegas to Jersey
Got'em in Houston, Virginia, New Orleans, ya heard me?
All the classy ones like to act like they a virgin
And the nasty ones like when I talk to'em dirty
But I'm breakin' the ice, got'em laughin' and flirtin'
They be, removin' they skirts when they hop in the 'burban
Once the flick start playin' and the E start kickin' in
Her girlfriend lickin' and she beggin' me to stick it in
That's why, I like chillin' with women who like women
Light skinned, Asians, Jamaicans and white women
Indians, Italians, Haitians and Puerto Ricans
They be itchin' for they chance and waitin' in me to freak'em
They say

Excuse me shawty, but I been watchin' you now for a while
Yo whole style, from yo toes to the way that you smile
And I hope you ain't offended by the way that this sounds
But uhh... all I keep thinkin' bout is layin' you down
And I'm, keepin' it pimpin', I ain't playin' around
Ain't got that kinda time 'cause this the only day I'm in town
So come and, chill in the cut if you willin' to cut
And when you, give me a hug I be feelin' yo butt
Now so while for while we talkin', I'm fillin' yo cup
We killin' the bottle, wake up in dirty linen tomorrow
But tell me would it trouble you if we ended up at the W
Sippin' on a malibu pine apple juice and a blunt or two
Now whachu want to do? Opportunity's right in front of you
Know you used to meetin' dudes, dodgin'em for a month or two
But young pimpin' spit linen to the young women

Dis for all my niggas who think they hard,
You want to know what's hard(whats hard pimp?)
Going about yo day nigga losing yo life at the end of it
Now that's what's hard (minding my motherfucking business)
Let me tell y'all bout the last day I lived nigga

I'm in the 96 Impala with the gat in my lap
Annihilating any nigga trying to work in my trap
Now see the feds got me tap'd
So to keep 'em off of my bac
I got a crib in the trap and a crib to relax
Now my indictment was a secret and that's the way that they keep it
If I ain't have a hoe giving head to the feds
Coming back telling me exactly what they said 
I'm a dead man walking
Waiting on time in jail
But I'll die before I let 'em stop my mail
Long as I got another ounce to sell
What the hell I'ma bail? a grap my scale
Get another key and I'ma slang my yayo
Niggas on the westside can't re-up because its a drought
So I check the crack house,
DAMN it sold out
So back to the crib so I can check this stash
Ain't sure about how much dope I had
Got a couple keys in the safe right now
Weigh it up cook it up then chop it down
Now I'm ready to go and pick up my fetti
But before I leave the house I can't dip without grabbin my G'z
And my keys to my brand new V put 'em in pocket with the gat to see
Niggas please nigga you holla bout freeze
Put this red dot to ya ass and squeeze
Now I'm dipping bac to the swats
With the 4-4 and a plastic glock
Turned around and I had to stop
Couldn't trap swarn it was cops
Standing there and I still ain't scared
Mac Boney nem must have fled
Only cops is I fear is the feds
On my car flashing blue and red
Damn there they go now its time to dip
Got the 4-4 right my hip
9 millimeter wit a extra clip
Thats what y'all niggas get fucking round wit TIP
Busting at 'em
N cussin at 'em but ain't no shaking 'em
Them bullets that they was busting at me my vest was takin 'em
Making them pigs fall in pain
Turned around 'cause one call my name
Took a hot one to the brain
Yea I died but long live the game",Long Live da Game,2003

You think them niggas is hot
Well shawty look what I got

Shawty look what I got
Hey, pimping look what I got

[Verse One]
Big wheels still spin when I stop
Presidential roll, gold Rolex watch
With no rocks
I save them for the pinky
Keep you niggas blinkin'
He ain't wearin' platinum, Naw
But I keep you niggas thinking
Mink seats sure to keep a nigga sinkin'
Swear he ain't slangin'
But I know that nigga creepin'
Got a condo, in Orlando
For the weekend
Homes be so crunk in the club
We gotta sneak in
No more room in the V.I.P
They payin' just to peek in
When they leave
They be looking in a car
They can't even see in
And that's just the
Be-gin-ning
In the city that he in
He was rappin' in the cafeteria
But now that nigga serious
Heard he got a CL, a EXT on Spreewells
Several Chevy's on 24's
(Hold up), how many records he sell?
Man I don't know
But he got a label now
Them boys, the PSC (hell)
I heard Atlantic gave 'em a deal for
2 or 3 mill. (ay, shawty)
(for real nigga?)

[Chorus]
Look what I got
A old school, a truck and a drop
So next time you think them niggas is hot
Shawty, look what I got
The respect of the niggas and G's
So next time you say them niggas is G's
You probably lookin' at me
A what, we ballin'
Bought the bar for the broads
So next time you think them niggas is hard
Shawty, look at the squad
I'm buyin' yachts, have the streets on lock
So next time you think yo' peeps on top
Pimpin, look what I got

I'm well known in the hood
Like the dope man phone number
Roll anything I can throw some 24's under
Nigga talk bad 'bout the man
But I shole wonder
Why the dope boys fuck with 'em
And the hoes love 'em
Very little promotions on this album
Never heard of 'em
But it's jammin' like the fuck
Was jumpin' out the stores
Cause I was born in the raid
And I'm made in the streets
I done played in the days
In the shade in the streets
I say I rapped in the trap
With the best in the streets
Shot craps in the back
You know the rest, nigga please
You doin' business with me
You best invest in some skills
I sell slopes of snow
I don't fuck with little blow nigga
Got 80 k's, it's gone take a little more (to what?)
To double up and bring it back
And make a little more (You movin' slow)
And moving slow, now what you take a nigga for?
I'ma cock hammers and 44's
And nail yo ass to the floor
And I ain't braggin', I'm just letting niggas know
Cause the media and radio can get a nigga so
Fucked up
Comparin' me to these niggas little flow
I do a song
Fuck up they whole little show (so shawty)

[Chorus]",Look What I Got,2003
T.I.,"[Verse 1]
I'm either running for my life or I'm just waiting to die
I'm the supplier of the fire if you're chasing a high
It's never, when or why, it's the way that he die
Did he stand like a man till the day that he die
Or was he reaching for guns or trying to run
Or was he outside on the lawn in front of his son
And if ya, running your mouth you can die in the slum
Cause in the, south where I'm from they dying for crumbs
You can die for your Patna's or die for ya moms
Or you could die 'cause your nigga just heard the alarm, just stealing
Or die in a plane they say it's a bomb
When they run it into a tower, they just say it's Saddam
Screaming Allah the moment that it's hitting the building
With total disregard for all men women and children
See niggas get killed when, people mix they money with feelings
I'm filling my money up in the wall some in the ceiling
I'm just one of the millions of niggas who buckin'
It's a war going on and they killing for nothing
We were in denial all awhile they where flicking the buttons
I'd rather be dying for something instead of living for nothing
End of discussion

[Chorus]
Hey, ain't no more talk
Just start killing niggas off till ain't no more chalk
Or no mo' tape, to outline no mo' scenes
Or no mo' crimes, no mo' dying for no mo' phenes
Or no mo' rims and thing's and no mo' green
And no mo' chains and ring's that go bling bling
And no mo' passionate rapping and so it seems
It's just these talent less rappers they all acting
And I know, so ain't no mo' talk
Just start killing niggas off till ain't no mo' chalk
Or no mo' tape, to outline no mo' scenes
Or no mo' crimes, no mo' dying for no mo' phenes
Or no mo' rims and thing's and no mo' green
And no mo' chains and ring's that go bling bling
And no mo' passionate rapping and so it seems
It's just these talent less rappers they all acting
And I know

[Verse 2]
Yeah they said it wasn't no mo' green for no mo' grind
No mo' room for no mo' kings and no more crown to be given but by no means
Am I any more conceited than this game needed
And if I say it believe it, I'm running the region, you see it
Popping and blowing, I'm stopping I'm going
I'm just, telling, you knowing, you sleeping, or hating
And I don't care what you niggas is thinking or saying
About, you know who, the one who say you know what, do you know where
But you the best 'cause you goin' care
Now I ain't think so either, but we know greed'll make ya
Do strange thing's if we ain't people
And if ya, busting bout nothing, than we ain't equal
You just cussing for nothing and poisoning people
And it's embarrassing laughing at all of your songs
And you can hate me right now but you'll miss me 'fore long, when I'm gone

All you rap niggas role out
I trap when it's cold out
Whack niggas flying
But I stay down to I'm sold out
Cause down a hundred ground
Like a rapping in a dope house
Man wherever I be
The feds got me scoped out
Mother fucker let my nuts hang
Block out the duc canes
Cook it to it bubbles
Double fast as a mustang
I know you think you fuck man
But little shorty tuff man
Been a long time 
Since a nigg from Alanta
Spit this nuts game
That's a very few of real niggas
So how could they give nigga
The feeling that a real nigga
Would get around a real nigga
All they do is still niggas ideas
And rhythm with 'em
Holla something similar
Talking bout the hood
Like they hung in 'em
I got a million rhythms
Want em come get 'em

Stepped on like I'm working
With the damn thing
Dribble baby ain't seen
What I do to a ounce of doe
A whip man on my pager
Like I pay you folks
To whip some more
I'm doper than the fluid cellur
I flip it all up by myself
I give my niggas recipes
So they can turn to something else
They love to work
That's why I keep em coming
Like collections plate 
We flip the cake
We move this shit from Georgia
Baby state to state
Intimidate

Who've been moving weight
Nobody loosing weight
They fuck with us
Cause you've been known to hate
Demonstrate
The way we turned the trout
Out in '98
Started out in '95
Started out with nicks and dimes

Well maybe I will be
But probably not
Oh what the blood cloak
You try to knock em out and he sock
Listen to me I'm serious
Thinking how did he not
End up way up
On the top of Detroit
If come where I was
You gotta be pop
And if you really want to pop
And I rather be dropped

Slam dunk in pimping and her sister if she close enough

Look over hear
Open up the door and let it cook in hear
Grab the mic a watch these niggas tuck there tail and look in fear
As I bust around with no shells inside in myself
Lyrics like a counseled weapon sending you bitches straight to hell

Burning up just like in waco Texas
Heating up your neckless
Scorching up your afro the devil coming at your
Ass any hard one for niggas who really want it
M-J- fucking G with pussy and titties on it

Them bitches love when they see pimping come up in it
24 inches under something smoking tinted
Hustle hard for keep it cause I love to spend it
Pimping love is when your style is when you love to hit it

[Bun B]
I came a long way from a posta posta
Till I kosta nostra kept the toaster closer
Than I'm supposed to well I poast ya procha
Ride like a roller coaster
Pistol whip you hold ya throat then choke you like a croacha croacha rocha
Pull out a light and smoke you (damn)
Pull my coat off I blessed man just stressed man
Just still elementary just a glance couldn't learn it is hurting my chances
Pack pistols just to blast it (blast it)
I put it to second guessers I blast it it just to prove it (prove it)
Mother fuckers get a moving (moving)
I born into hustling I grew up tustling
Gave my muscle in and got into meeting my frail but hell I put my trust in
My left and right hand grinding threw the night
And I keep my family right and see some paper like a white man
Balling in the ninth (and) we holding in the light (and) sippin on worthless
Sprite and you can call it what you like
I call what the fuck I feel play the courts that fucking peel
But we ain't sleeping till they free and pimping here that's the fucking drill

T.I.,"Ay I'm working here, know what I'm saying
Try to put yourself in my shoes for a second
Its not personal I'm just sayin though

Ay look
From when the moon came out 'till the sun came up
I was supplyin the days when where they flame up
Our mamas passing, by trying to explain us
Pissing in the bushes like they never house trained us
But, try to understand that's how we came up
You get to know us, you'll love us but you can't change us (naw)
Really we rather be rich and famous
But in the mean time were forced to slang dust
'Dro or crack cocaine, Penicillin to Rogaine
Ecstacy, Viagra, whatever'll get the dough mayne
I'm tired of people mis-representing my dough mayne
Oh you think we out here killing for nothing, hustling
for no gain (picture that)

Hey man I'm just doing my job
Hey lady, don't mind me I'm just doing my job
I don't want to make your life more harder, I'm just doin' my job
You live here, I work here I'm doing my job

I don't know if you don't know, don't care or can't see
Every time something up in the hood, it ain't me
And I ain't always up to no good and know the crease
And we ain't always gotta pass through the hood without speaking (how you doing)
We ain't out here threatening your lives, raping your children
We just out here staying alive, making a million (you know)
Working hard, trying to survive chasing a mill-ion
You hear us talking loud, just think of this is chameleon
React to the situations, but accusations is still
? and rise in your house, I mean you just hurting my feelings (man)
We got lives, we want to live nice too
We got moms, dads, wise kids just like you
But I ? a few, its hell in high school
When your helping with the rent lights and the gas bill too
So before you go judging us loving us won't hurt
Yeah under 25, staying alive is hard work

Hey man I'm just doing my job
Hey lady, don't mind me I'm just doing my job
I don't want to make your life more harder, I'm just doin' my job
You live here, I work here I'm doing my job

And for you to see what I'm saying, open eyes will help
If you could think about somebody besides yourself
Why you pointing fingers at me, analyze yourself
Quit all that chastising and try to provide some help
Instead of calling the law, you busting my balls
With all due respect, we don't even need to be fucking with y'all (man)
And we can't help it cause it is like this
We don't like it no more than you that we live like this
Hallway, stuck in the grass summertime to wintertime
Cutting school to sell fifty dimes by dinner time
See everything we know we learned from the streets
Since thirteen I've been hustling and earning my keep

Hey man I'm just doing my job

T.I.,"I been a menace to society
Since when, since menace to society
Still refused to become a legitimate citizen quietly
Felt like my labor hidin' me
But here I am anyway I might be back to slangin' grams any day
And if this record flop well I'll be back wit' a bomb of heart
Wit' see-Rod and the squad this whole industry's a facade
Man this ain't real life

Half these rappers don't know what sacrifice feel like
Man these niggaz is all hype, not even rappin' on real mics
They just get high and say whatever the fuck they feel like
They make me feel like bustin' these niggaz one at a time
And I'm still outbustin' these niggaz hoe pick a rhyme

Ay, what these other niggaz talkin' I don't believe that shit
I'm the king 'cause I said it and I mean that shit
Ay, what's so special 'bout him ay, he ain't all that shit
I set the city in fire have you seen that shit?

Ay, what these other niggaz talkin' I don't believe that shit
I'm the king 'cause I said it and I mean that shit
Ay, what's the big deal about him, he ain't even that shit
I set the city on fire have you seen that shit?

It's only five rappers outta Atlanta who bustin' and I'm one of 'em
The other four, you know who you are
But if you gotta think twice well shawty you ain't nice
Regardless of your publishing deal you can't write
I'm the best thing left blowin' breath on the mic
The king of the south nothin' else will suffice

You wanna bet? Well put yo' budget up
Match the price me and you like putting matches to ice
You won't make it
Before I had a deal I was still butt naked
God signed this, like keeping' the Lord's promise
The truth nigga like Beenie's first LP
You can do a song with N'Sync and couldn't outsell me
I'm a legend in my own time a prophet in my own rhymes
A king wit' a concubine

Ay, what these other niggaz talkin' I don't believe that shit
I'm the king 'cause I said it and I mean that shit
Ay, what's so special 'bout him ay, he ain't all that shit
I set the city in fire have you seen that shit?

Ay, what these other niggaz talkin' I don't believe that shit
I'm the king 'cause I said it and I mean that shit

I set the city on fire have you seen that shit?

Niggaz like you, a dime a dozen they come and go
So why I'm runnin' now and I ain't never run before
Grab choppers, cock 'em and blow
Stoppin' the show bet or owe 'em, droppin' the hoes
You just keep watchin' the door

Pop 'em, watch 'em drop to the floor fluff his pockets and go
Put a quarter block on his nose and a glock in his clothes
He can keep his watches and gold for his momma to hold
She'll be there buyin' the hoes before the drama unfolds
They know shawty outta control got me hot as a stove

Puttin' holes in yo' Girbaud wettin' up yo' polos
44's and Callico's a black and a chrome
Lettin' loose and splackin' your dome
Hoppin' back in the Brougham
Known for kickin' in yo' door wavin' gats in yo' home
Clearin' it out I'm sorry I ain't hearin' you out
You hearin' about the squad pumpin' Fe in your heart
Because you know sacrifice was near and dear to your heart

Ay, what these other niggaz talkin' I don't believe that shit
I'm the king 'cause I said it and I mean that shit
Ay, what's so special 'bout him ay, he ain't all that shit
I set the city in fire have you seen that shit?

Ay, what these other niggaz talkin' I don't believe that shit
I'm the king 'cause I said it and I mean that shit
Ay, what's the big deal about him, he ain't even that shit

Hey, let's get away and get a room on the other side of town
Hey shawty, I was feenin' for you

Hey, let's get a room, shawty we can freak somethin' if you down
(What you would do?)
Hey daddy, I was feenin' for you

Bet they be like ""I know he tired of the nightlife
He want a wife, he just lookin' for the right type""
Yea right, I be ridin' through the city lights
My hat bent, gettin' high behind the 'lac tint
I'm chilllin' with Brazilian women, heavy accents
They black friends translatin', got 'em all ass naked, adjacent
Have relations with 'em many places
Leavin' semen in they British faces
Make'em kiss they partners with it in they faces
Young pimpin' sprung women 'cross the 50 states
Got young ladies requestin' ""What's Yo Name"" on 50 stations
Askin' me what's a pussy popper, want a demonstration
But I ain't waitin' til the second date, I'm so impatient
Relieve'em of they aggravation, take'em rollerskatin'
On them Dayton's, tell'em ""Baby, stick with me, you goin' places""
Go replace'em, draw erase'em out my memory
Moist panties and wet sheets when they think of me

Yo, yo, uh,
From Miami to Cali, from Vegas to Jersey
Got'em in Houston, Virginia, New Orleans, ya heard me?
All the classy ones like to act like they a virgin
And the nasty ones like when I talk to'em dirty
But I'm breakin' the ice, got'em laughin' and flirtin'
They be, removin' they skirts when they hop in the 'burban
Once the flick start playin' and the E start kickin' in
Her girlfriend lickin' and she beggin' me to stick it in
That's why, I like chillin' with women who like women
Light skinned, Asians, Jamaicans and white women
Indians, Italians, Haitians and Puerto Ricans
They be itchin' for they chance and waitin' in me to freak'em
They say

Excuse me shawty, but I been watchin' you now for a while
Yo whole style, from yo toes to the way that you smile
And I hope you ain't offended by the way that this sounds
But uhh... all I keep thinkin' bout is layin' you down
And I'm, keepin' it pimpin', I ain't playin' around
Ain't got that kinda time 'cause this the only day I'm in town
So come and, chill in the cut if you willin' to cut
And when you, give me a hug I be feelin' yo butt
Now so while for while we talkin', I'm fillin' yo cup
We killin' the bottle, wake up in dirty linen tomorrow
But tell me would it trouble you if we ended up at the W
Sippin' on a malibu pine apple juice and a blunt or two
Now whachu want to do? Opportunity's right in front of you
Know you used to meetin' dudes, dodgin'em for a month or two
But young pimpin' spit linen to the young women

T.I.,"""yeah! (yeah!) 
It's been a long journey getting' to
This motherfuckin' point of this crunk juice shit. (what?!)
But we done got to the last motherfuckin' song niggas
(last shit niggas!) and I got five of the hottest motherfuckin'
Emcees in the world, givin' you that gangsta shit!
It's the motherfuckin' grand finale!

We growin' doja in the basement in that underwater garden (okay)
When hereon in the bank shed, dry it 'til it harden
Make it hash up in the oven (man), put yayo in the hot plate
Drain and dry in the freeser, it's obvious we got weight
I said hard work, that's soft work even with wet work
Built-in clientele so we ain't gotta network (let's go)
We always got work, so we ain't gotta get work
And if you ain't gettin' your work from us you bound to get jerked
We yayo experts, we been whippin' the yola since the crackas decided to
Take the coke from coca-cola
Hold the rollers, the king of the trill
The underground as well, you can step in the ring when you feel
Nigga just sound the bell
Can't sound the heaters in this game, but the grind I'm lovin'
Nigga we passed all that pushin', man it's time for shovin'
I got the mask, I got the strap, soon as I find the gloves
We gonna start exposin' off like farhrenheit 9/11

I'm a speak clearly 'cause I don't think they hearin' me
A nigga only fear's gettin' charged with conspiracy
I'ma get it right to ya, sticky green white to ya
Wear whatever you want, bullets goin' right through ya
If you stressin' to get buried
My niggas'll send you back to the essence in a hurry
Sippin' crunk juice, blowin' dutchies in the chevy
Try to figure me out dawg, I'm light but I'm heavy
Yellow lemonheads in the bessie of the presi'
And yeah, anybody can rock but d-block rock steady (d-block!)
Fed's don't need no warrants 'cause y'all all informants
So I get higher than new york insurance
Try to keep shit clean like florence
Moved on up on the east side 'cause I never lost endurance
And it's all real niggas, if I ever get a license to carry
Shit, that's a license to kill niggas

I refuse to lose, I rather give these weak dudes the blues
And separate them from they jewels, teach 'em don'ts and do's
I raise tools, make crews make decisions confused
All spectators can say is, ""this lil' nigga's a fool""
A short fuse with some loose screws, some unscrewed
Better prove, you niggas pussy as the moulan rouge
So who guardin' who, you know who to you know what
To you know where, goin' 'gainst 'em's too unfair
'cause everywhere you do a show he got kinfolk there
Now you know I ain't no ?, I got ten folk there
They ain't powerful as the one at the end of your prayer
Got you runnin' for your life without a minute to spare
Catch you dead to the granite, melt the grease in your hair
When I go, them boys is gonna be indecent affair
Guarantee you nah a real nigga breathin' accounted
At your funeral, just your parents and the preacher was there
Hollow, television name-dropper reachin' for help
So I ain't gotta say a word, pimp you beatin' ya'self
You gon' get what you deserve for disrespectin' the game
Any nigga with the nerve to say another man name
When that other man ain't even present
And deny it when somebody ask him about it
That nigga's a lame, you like to lie on the mic
Hide behind fame, I was a g when I came
That's the way I remain

Who besides the egyptian-walker, fuckers have a conniption
My existence persistent to bring foes misfortune
I dassle 'em, like the alderman, billy dee in mahogany, minus the perm
From the tiniest sperm that the mightiest the almighty can muster
Project prophet, chronic blockage gives alzheimer's to youngsters
Amongst them is me, can't remembers my beefs
With who? for what? they screw-face me up, my boo laced me up
Bolinsiaga, flimsy condo with bimbos in south of kalan gro in pimp mode
The inf' glow on his clothes and you know it's over
Hammer hit pin, pin hit shell, from the shell the slug gonna chew ya
Try not to lose me, I try not to lose'ya
Mama say mama sa mu makasa, fly to cuba
To chill with some politi-kill niggas who ill
'cause y'all niggas are losers, don't get comfortable nigga
Say hello to mr. bad guy, get that cash par, I'm the last don
You'll ever know so, here you go y'all can take these thoughts
Anyway I'm chargin' emcees a late fee cost
So when y'all done with my style, please break me off
But never make nas mad just in case cross
'cause ah, lately y'all don't make me happy
To calm my nerve I need the herb gnc don't carry

Who the fuck is that? it's ice cube motherfucka'
He's a maniac, no I'm a fool motherfucka'
Old school motherfucka', blow through a motherfucka'
What you heard about a nigga so true motherfucka'
See I'm ugly and prettay, I'm polished and grittay
Shoot better than that nigga that tried to kill 50
See, niggas get shittay when I come to their cittay
When I hit the spot that bitch they like, she cummin' with me
Cause I got an ego big as to, but I'm not an eagle
Bitch, I roll with rigo 'cause gangstas don't dance we boogie
I told you motherfuckas kobe didn't take that pussy
Get money, get paid, you can beat that shit
Even if the da is a piece'a shit
Colorado got movatos, don't eat that shit
Another white bitch lyin' on thee black dick
I keep it flippin' like flapjacks, pimpin' like black 'lacs
Give niggas flashbacks, they sweaty as ass cracks
When I hit the tar mat, it feel like a carjack
Niggas get out and vanish like star treks
So fuckin' incredible, I'm so fuckin' credible
No matter what happen, I'll never turn federal
And that's my report comin' straight from cali

I wish you could see what I have on right now
You so sexy
Imagine how intense it would be
To hold me right now
Our song's playing

At night, when you're far and I'm alone
I feel the fabric from your t-shirt
Close to my body
I can still hear your baritone
In my ear telling me you'll take it slow
And I was in the mirror playing a roll
Like you work it, I couldn't turn me on
So I fell asleep with the music on
Woke up again hearing the same old song, playing

(Oh) give it to me deeper
(Oh) giving me the fever
(Oh) now you got my feet up
This one is a keeper
Now the second verse is playing
(Oh) we tried to stand up
(Oh) hold me why while my hands up

I'm thinking to myself again

When you're not here (I sleep in your t shirt)
I wish you were here  (to take off your t shirt)
After we make love (I sleep in your t shirt)
Wake up in your t shirt
Still smell the scent of your cologne
When I need your feel (I sleep in your t shirt)
I need your help (to take off your t shirt)
After we make love (I sleep in your t shirt)
Wake up in your t shirt
Still smell the scent of your cologne

Outside I hear the rain on my windowpane
Hold up a minute, thought I heard your name
My mind, playing tricks on me again
I hear knocks at the door, is that baby home
Why couldn't it be reality
Looked at the clock it says 4:03
At nine he'll be arriving on a plane
Then we'll be making love and hearing the song again

(Oh) give it to me deeper
(Oh) giving me the fever

Specially when I look at the mac in the black Cadillac
And the bubbles in the hummer truck

If the ice don't matter, and the money don't phase you,
Cars don't impress you, I bet the sex will amaze you
Look you don't want to past the chance (hey)
Spend the summer in the bottom half of France
Don't be alarmed I don't mean no harm
I'll help you before I hurt you
I'm tryna' rebirth you
I want to love you
I ain't just have to nail you
You already know I can show you
Better than I can tell you

T.I.,"Dig pimp, 
I'ma holla at y'all in a minute, I'm finna go change clothes man
go get real spiffy man, go kick it with my broad, I'ma holla at yall later

[Verse 1]
I left the kids at the crib, and the squad in the trap
Now I'm in the two-seater with my broad in my lap
The alpines beatin', but I'm far away from rappin'
Bumpin' Prince, Sade, or some Marvin Gaye perhaps, I
Put up my blues, put on some tailor made slacks
Some wing tip shoes, what you know about that?
Button down, cufflinks, hair cut, no hat
Just felt like gettin' clean and show I know how to act
At Neiman and Marcus let my girl blow three or four stacks
Gotta forever to cut the food, and damn I'm relaxed
In a real cool mood, no beef, no gats
But then real close by, niggaz better know that

[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
I ain't hangin' with my niggas, pullin' no triggas
I'll be back to the trap, but for now
I'm chillin' with my bitch today, I'm chillin' with my bitch today
I ain't hangin' with my partners, I'm out eatin' lobster
I'm on some grown man shit, ya dig
I'm chillin' with my bitch today, I'm chillin' with my bitch today

[Verse 2]
This shit look hard, no drama from none of my baby mama's
With my hottie, takin' shots of ? in the Hummer
Known to kick it like we riches, got Richie and Madonna

Or either Will and Jada, on vacation for the summer
Me and my lil' mama, blowin' big as we wanna
Gotta big sack of some of that shit from California
A bottle of Patron and a six pack of Corona
Dro aroma got the six hot steamin' like a sauna
So I let the top back and I bend anotha corner
Check into the W, so I can put it on her
Got the suite for a week, but we can stay a lil' longer
I ain't trippin', that's the shit that make relationships stronger

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Tonight I'm goin' chill with my lady friend
She the type to keep a nigga open
I'm chillin' with my bitch today

[Verse 3]
I left the stress in the streets and I'm a long way from home
Put up the vest and the chrome, even through with my phone
My partners don't wanna be on the shit that I'm on man
Livin' life and kickin' it like a grown man
Sittin' in the sand, drinkin' pina coladas
With a double shot of rum, just chillin' right by the water
No judges, no lawyers, in a whole 'nother world
Just a bottle and this ZO. dro, blowin' with my girl

Hey! Hey! Hey!

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams (T.I.)] 
(But she's a freak though)
She got angel eyes, wit the baby face
(But she's a freak though)
I want my momma and daddy to meet her
Maybe have my name
(But she's a freak though)
They keep talking about you
Because they, can't keep up with your pace
You're my, super freak! super freak!
You're my, super freak!

[T.I.]
My momma taught me, everything fine ain't the finest
And everything that shine ain't a diamond
They say that change come wit time and I'm finding
That most bitches take your kindness for blindness
Yeah it feel good laying her beside you
Digging deep, ol' nine up beside you
But we can't kick out in public, gotta hide you
Cause all my partners in the hood done tried you
It's true that you can't turn a hoe into a house wife
Well listen shorty maybe I don't want a house wife
They say that you a freak I'm thinking that they bout right
Because that pussy's so good and your mouth tight
A pretty face, slim waist, and her stout nice
Juicy ass that them niggas in the south like
She super sexy, got a nigga thinking bout a wife
Wearing all white, being wit her for life

[Chorus]

[T.I.]
The main thing making niggas judge you
Is the same thing that make me want to love you
From the smell of ya hair, I want to hug you
To the way you yell ""give it to me"" when I fuck you
Plus you ain't tripping off a nigga cause he thugging
That's why I'm twice as happy as relationships that wasn't
But my partner say you tricking with his cousin
But nevermind, I don't listen they be bugging
They find it hard to understand how could T.I.P. love
This girl, when her man is out at strip clubs
Maybe cause T.I.P. girls leaving wit girls
And in the morning they'll be waking up with six girls
They don't know we more like homies when we pick girls
Why you worried bout it, he ain't gotta make you his girl
Fuck what he think about you, I think you the shit girl
Make me want to bring another kid in the world

[Chorus]

[T.I.]
Now I been told every nigga in the streets know
She ain't nothing but a freak ho
But when I look in her pretty eyes, I don't see it though
Now she done showed me some shit that I ain't seen before
But what we do behind closed doors is for me to know
All in all I've decided I'm a keep her though
I'm a fucking grown man, what I'm creeping for?
Just try me 'bout her folk, that's what I'm toting heaters for
I'd die by that for her a real good reason though
That's how I feel, let my partners and my momma know
Keep it real, all the disrespect has got to go
I disrespect, she is selfish, she don't hide it
Though she may have been a tad misguided
All she need is a little affection, a lot of direction
A nigga wit a constant erection
And I done wasted plenty time contemplating second guessing
Procrastinating, I want to buy a ring and pop the question

[Chorus]",Freak Though,2004

As you see the O.G.s from Grand Hustle done laid it down again
T.I.P. shorty
Hey yo, this for all my homegirls like to see a baller do his thing
Get ya shit together come on
All the eight, nines, and dimes
I'd like to welcome y'all to the best time of ya life
Ya understand that
All the stones is real
And it's all chrome on the wheels, ya know
Anything less is uncivilized

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Pull up to the club, lift both doors up
Hopped out clean and yo ho chose us
Walked in the door, make the show hold up
Cause my neck and my bracelet is so froze up
The kind of stones bitches wanna see close up
So we don't approach them, they come and approach us
Roll the dro up then go post up
Look down with the west fixin' go sho' nuff
In the V.I.P. and all eyes on us
Hoes chill, poppin' pills blowin' dro no dust
What you say, got a man so what
I don't know him baby and he don't know her
I got a new Phantom and my own chauffeur
Ya think ya fixin' be thinkin' bout him, no sir
Probably prefer to tel ya man good night
Unless you don't wanna know what the good life look like

If you ain't gettin' money good night
I know what a broke nigga look like
When ya ridin' in ya wheels get ya shit together
Boy them diamonds ain't real, get ya shit together

Now we can ball seven days, six nights
If that head and that pussy hit right
Hey, match ya panties with ya bras get ya shit together
Go get ya hair and nails done get ya shit together

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Hey, I'm off the scene with Louis the thirteenth
Chains swings to my jeans, and my T-shirt clean
In case you been researching, I'm the King
With a style as mean as the Earth seem
Chest on ice, and my wrist on gleam
30 karats in the ring, money ain't no thing
You think I'm playin' but I ain't joking
The dro king, if it ain't purple, I ain't smoking
Rubberband bank rolls, fifty thousand dollar cheddar knots
Try to shine, is you out your mind, boy you better not
I walk around with more money than you ever got
Shrewd attitude like I never had to sell a rock
Shorty I can get you in whatever spot
Backstage, front row, what I got to front for
I'm getting bored, don't even know what I stunt for
Got a lot of rides, what it hurt to cop one more

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
To all my hot girls, if you wanna come chill
Or roll on chrome wheels, let me tell you what it is
We fixin' throw a little party at the crib
Where the floors tricked out and the rooms like ill
The basement's cool, but the pools unreal
Where that millionaire lives, shit remains concealed
So pop a pill, put on your blindfold
I'm hitting the dance floor, and grab eighty-nine more
Let em' know we on the way where they been trying to go
I knew I had em' when they asked me ""What kind of diamonds are those""
Headed to the spot pouring double shots of XO
Play the ""Love Below"" and watch 'em undress slow
Flicks on the flat screen, make em' want to ""Get Low""
And spit shine this dick of mine until it gets swole
When they kick it with the king, they don't wanna let go
So what you gonna tell a nigga, when he tell ya ""Let's Go""

Give us this day, our daily bread
And forgive us for our trespasses
As we forgive those who trespassed against us
And lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
For thine is the kingdom
And the power, and the glory
Forever and ever, hmm, amen

[Verse 1]
Man, I'm prayin' for help
While I'm lookin' at the life I left, it's kinda hard not to hate myself
But quiet as kept, right or wrong it's just the way I felt
I might be better off prayin' for death, on my knees I nealt
Still tryin' to find a way to accept, it ain't a way that I can
Help nobody, 'til I save myself, technically I'm still a slave myself
I gotta climb out the grave myself, man I played myself
But when I look at all the fans I touched
I ask how can a man that's done so much, be treated so unjust
Cause I'm tryin' to inspire the folks, you want to be them
Cause they sell dope, well man show 'em the ropes
Be a father or a football coach, a role model or a symbol of hope
Take another approach, instead of testifyin' against them in court
Handcuffin' 'em and closin' the door, so they can be worse than before
Can't you see they only do what they know
Than you wonder why they don't care no mo', life ain't fair I know
But why I'm hated everywhere I go, next time you want to
Compare my flow, just know that I'm prayin' for help

[Chorus]
Askin' somebody else to give me a hand
I'm tryin' hard, but I'm only a man
Man, I'm prayin' for help
Hopin' somebody could see what I see
It's like the hood only matter to me
They got me prayin' for help
Hopin' somebody else can carry the torch
I'm all alone, with no kinda support
While I was prayin' for help
Realized that I don't need nobody else
If God wit' me I can do it myself
I'm tired of just prayin' for help

[Verse 2]
I know it's only one king, one thing, one being
Only somethin' I believe without seeing, and with all my faith
I pray some how, some way, regardless of what anyone say
I believe one day, that I'ma change my life, get right
Start livin' like Christ, 'til the end of my fight
I'ma be defending my strife
Til somebody come and shut off my lights, I ain't never goin' quit
No matter how difficult it's gon' get, and you can bet whatever on this
I'm forever goin' spit, harder than niggas hatin' on Tip
You can take away place it on Tip, If I double my load
Carry it as the trouble unfolds, holds yours
And I better don't fold, put that on my soul
If it takes until I'ma hundred years old, bet I'm reachin' everyone of my goals

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Hey many times, I done wish I could change my mind
Change my life and leave the game behind
And it's been so many days, I done prayed I could find a way
Find a heart and the time to say, only so many are blessed
With so many chances, and so many checks, so many fans
With so many arrest, and it's been so many deaths
So many prisons with niggas in there
And the system keep playin' them to the left, man it's so many tests
So many haters love seeing you stess, but tribulations come with being the best
Still it's so many reflects, singin' by text, when they bringin' the trecks
Sellin' dreams never seem to jex, that's why I'm seeing some threats
So many stripes off the streets I'ma vet, so many rappers get so little respect
Now niggas faith on the shelf, 'cause of the cards that a nigga was dealt
Or the heart that a nigga then dealt, so many niggaz done left outta the hood
Made a way for them-self, instead of givin' back, they stay for they self
So many playin' they self, instead of readin', educating they self
The ones who won't even pray for they self, they got me prayin' for help

I got a question for you hating ass niggas out there, hey
Why you mad at me,Ay
Oh lame ass nigga why you mad at me
Sucker ass nigga why you mad at me

[Verse 1]
Remember late nights earn stripes servin straight white
Talk shit slap box clear into the day light
Might fuss may fight but stay tight
Keep what the ""J"" need for the lighter hit the base pipe
If the trap was the ocean or the sea
You could consider me and them the killa whales and great whites
Before a nigga tried to click it make them think twice
Cause they knew Cap would kill a nigga fo blink twice
Day right I'm reciting my life
Nigga I was there no matter what through sirens on a silent night
Cold Sundays slow Mondays hot Friday nights
Tuesday Thursdays serving whether or not they ride tonight
On peaceful days hostful evenings even violent nights
Chip on my sholder hold a grudge cause you can die tonight
I swear you niggas had no idea what my life was like
Before the bright lights and a half a mil just to grab the mic

[Chorus]
Is it cause I came from the bottom to the top
Why you mad at me
Maybe cause I Spent a hundred on a drop
Why you mad at me
Is it cause I kept it pimpin and stayed down
Why you mad at me
Or is it cause I am the a town
Why you mad at me
Is cause you a lame and I'm a ""G""
Why you mad at me
Is it cause I got love in the streets
Why you mad at me
Is cause you know yo time running out
Why you mad at me
Is it cause you know I'm king of the south

[Verse 2]
Niggas mad cause I got it like this
Gold on my wrist hoes on my dick, my dick
But I could give a fuck about this industry
I'm a be the same tip til the end of me
That's something you know automatically if you a friend of me
Question that will think other wise now you offend me
I came in this game not looking for a friend or enemy
Found them both now that niggas in to me
Got little rap niggas liking into me
Major labels and police want to censor me
Feds on my ass cause I'm in the streets
Think I still slang listen to lame niggas who lie to snitch on me
It ain't my fault that you can't picture me
Riding in a phantom and I swear I never fathom
All the fame that a nigga can gain from Atlanta
Now I'm just trying to maintain for Atlanta
Before niggas would say in Atlanta
I was Rhode Park Doug High stayed in Atlanta
Now true enough I sold yay in Atlanta
But is that compared to contributions I made to Atlanta

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
A pick a reason any reason all excuses would do
But man you lucky I ain't bucking like I used to do fool
While you was throwing one's and two's
I was lifting up tools and then
Shoot at his shoes just to see if he move
Or either bust at his head to check if he dead man
Don't talk around cause I heard he the fed's man
They offer him time and they knowing he scared and tell him
Give me they names or you doing the stretch man
Or wear a wire go record what he said
And then you can tell his lawyer that his clients a dead man
A rat I'm smelling blow I ain't selling
Where you got that impressing ain't no telling
Yes I'm a felon why was that in question
What about all these records I'm selling
I'm Bankhead born and Bankhead bread
And when a nigga die I'm gone be Bankhead dead

East steady talkin' on the cell phone nightly
Normal population, half the jail just like me
Polices think I'm crazy, scared a nigga gon' strike me
Contrarily, a nigga tryin' me is unlikely
They barkin' don't bother me, I'll be bombin' 'for they bite me
They just shocked to see my rap's exactly how my life be

Still stackin' and buildin', you still rappin' to children
Jeopardizin' your deals, caught up buyin' your wheels
Like its back when we was little and its still time to kill
Quit displayin' your skills, way underpayin' bills
Spend a day in the Ville, on how you saying you real
Niggas could never live how I live, you ain't deservin'

Just my bread suburban, in a red suburban
On 24's, 20 hoes giving head, I'm swervin'
Fuck boys pissed they pants, scared nervous
I'm shell-shocked, black eye, like I been in the service
Clean, cut, and preserved, but I told George Gervin

The rolls gold king, my ring tight as a virgin 
The dream I stop 'fore I seen the top (nigga)

Now days not playin' my record well, hell its hazardous
All this cussin' for some loud discussions, outta my character
Bussin' these niggas melons, and threatenin' all of they managers
P.$.C.'s Atlanta, so how you playin' and handlin'
Gorillas with bananas without playin' and banishin'

So then my pistols and my partners really all that I got
I'm not, playin' at all, I'm sprayin' 'em all
This K'll chop 'em down to size, 'cause they say that I'm small man
Pussycats can't worry the dog
Keep throwin' stones at the throne, I'ma bury you all man
Know, you fagot niggas hate that I'm ballin'
Makin' 30k a day and blow it all at the mall, and man I

Lunatic mayne, straight up out the heartland
Nine on my right, ten more karats on my other hand
In different colors man, worth a couple hundred grand
Damn mama, how you do that there?
How yo waist stay still but you move that there
Ain't got a clue right there
Seen a lotta ass poppin', but that's new right there
You invited to the house ma, you and yo crew right there
Check it, okay let's have some fun
I got four G's and 5 five G's in one

[Chorus]

You ready to get loose, shawty, better be
Sittin' on them leather seats
If not, pat yo feet on the concrete merely
Freak by choice, not force, I would never be
Charged with a rape, if she say no, I'ma let her be
Why should I let that worry me?
Too many bitches cherish me
Pimp til I die, be a playa til they bury me
Renegade, I'ma keep it pimpin', I ain't finna play
Anyway, I can hit the baddest bitches anyday
Slept with the best, I ain't gotta flex
Got yo girl stretched out, pullin' up her dress
Checkin' out her spread and I am impressed
G-strings right in the middle of them wet
Her girlfriends with her and all of them next
I passed them a bottle, gave all of them X
Head Pussy Popper, so all them expect
The best sex, and that's what all of them get

T.I.,"[Verse 1]
Diamonds in my bracelet shine like a Kodak flash
Just motivation for these freaky hoes to show that ass nigga
I pop tags on a throwback fast
Nigga please, I'm wearin' these when I cut my grass... freeze
All you niggas wanna touch my cash
The 40 cal's in the stash, and when I touch I blast
Television's in the dash, suede roof in the coupe
I'm the one nigga, young niggas knew it's the truth
And the dumb niggas I ain't done provin' it to
Come with a clique of guerrillas like I hung at a zoo
I gotta bitch to pull bitches like she one of the crew
Now a buncha broads in the back bustin' it loose
Do it free for me and charge you a hundred or two
Top floor in the presidential with a wonderful view
Yeah I'm rich, but I ain't just talkin' I live like this
You couldn't get water out the faucet as clear as my Cris

[Chorus (Mannie Fresh & TIP)]
Pimpin' y'all ain't heard that latest?
Hey it's the best of the best
Young pimpin' on a record with Fresh
I drive Chevy's, fuck Mercedes
Hopped out the new CL V12, got in the blue SS
And I'm leavin' with ya ladies
I got a beautiful bitch, pursuin' ya bitch
Next thing ya know, ya losin' ya bitch, pimp
Y'all niggas give it up I'm the greatest
Hey, I'm the greatest, hey, I'm the greatest, ay
Pimpin' I'm the greatest

[Verse 2]
It's been a long time since you seen a nigga like me
In a pair of Gucci sneakers, jeans and a white tee
Extravagant and out of control, I might be
But I'm makin' 50k on the road a night G
Rocks in my ring, big as cubes in ya ice tea
I used to dream 'bout a Benz now I own like 3
I gotta wine-colored V, with the wine-colored V
And reclined leather seats, I ain't lyin' on my beats
You can tell I'm gettin' money how I shine in the streets
Blowin' on the best pine you can find in the streets
Rappers wastin' they time if they trying to compete
They records sales declinin' when mine hit the streets
I got the fine freaks starin', 'cus my time piece glarin'
When the light hit the carrats, got they eyes lookin' Chinese
You'll run yourself raggedy tryna out shine me
No matter what ya do, you're 2 steps behind me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
A smooth attitude enable me to ball outrageous
Nigga fuck you paid me, I'm all out of favors
What Grand Hustle got ain't a motherfucker gave us
A motherfuckin' thing, but ain't a motherfucker played us
You gotta mil' that's a small percentage
The way ya record deal structured, you only get a small percentage
I gotta Magnum with a magnum in it
PlayStation and a plasma in it
Sittin' on 20 inches and it's tinted
Gotta hemi nothin' faster than it
The 50 Gs'll pass you in it, get real
Gotta Chevy more expensive than that Jag you rented
Excuse me, but let Young Pimpin' brag a minute
Gotta bottle of Louie and a flock of groupies hotter than Rudy
Lickin' me dry when I get out the jacuzzi
They eatin' pussy, suckin' dick until they mouth got gooey
Can't another young nigga in the south out do me

Tryin' to see how many flirt
Riding round the A.T.L. on the baddest bitch search

My pimping keep them hoes hooked like I had them jays on that white
Riding out in a Hummer which I call a lunch box
Standing on 26s which I call 'em high tops
Candy red paint on that yeah that thing a cherry pop
All peanut butter seats always leather never cloth
Hoe you couldn't wipe my pimping off if you had a rag
Yeah she knows her pops but I'm the one she calls dad
Straight swerving in the whip passing blunts taking drags
Watching DVD's in the truck while she out there selling ass

Peanut butter, Royal Chocolate

Now you ask a player
See me shining getting right
Finally coming up call me pimp tight

Vanilla want a nut on Sunday
Fill hot fudge in the middle of her tummy
Butter pecan white chocolate love day
Niggaz looking fly so remember where the hershay
Hoes at Davana of the scanna
Pussy split on my banana
Take they pic on who they gone sample
To Michigan back down to Alabama
Popped hypnotic be the flavor
That water their jaws for the milk they shake up
Captain save em
A.K. just gone lace up the beat
To be a suckers favorite
Top it off for the celebration
After I bang her I'll let you cake her
You were too seet she needed a banger
Make her melt let it drip through her fingers

Sexy, gorgeous, beautiful
Would you do something real freaky tonight

Now I'm in the limelight
This rose gold bring plenty dikes
They come around to service me because they know I lay the pipe
I'm running wit the king we in different cities every night
Broads stripping out they clothes before the D.J. pass the mic
Puerto Rican mama citas, Asian bitches mixed wit white
They come to see the P$C in many skirts and see threw tops

That's main reason I ain't settle down ain't got no wife
I'm down wit the squad
Done wit the hard
I be pimping these hoes for the rest of my life

Sexy women freaky ladies
Squeezing T.I.P.'s Mercedes
Kissing women, eating ladies, lick 'em till they driking babies
Like Rick James was in the 80s young and rich and living crazy

Love to keep the reefa blazing
And the new and imitated

145 and I'm out of your weight class
Want to survive, you better scramble like eggs and break fast
Cause I know how to handle your fake ass
I'm a ride on you and hide you in yesterday's trash
Pull up in the Chevy's spraying rounds through the glass
See you laying face down in the grass and I'll laugh
Ha, cause that's the end of the saga
The end of my problems, nigga mash the Impala
Go lay up with a model and watch the news tomorrow
And that's the end checkmate, game over, I'll holler
Pimp, telling you partner, you don't know what you're doing
Or recognize the trouble you getting in to and you're ruin
And dig this man

And all that gangster shit you talking, yeah, it sound good
But make it understood

You want to overthrow me

Dearly beloved, we're gathered here today
To marry this young nigga in his own special thug way
Do you promise to love and respect all of the real niggas
And when a problem come, learn to deal with 'em
Do you swear to turn this chopper
On any motherfucker in your path, or the bitch that's trying to stop ya
Or do you promise to keep him handy
And don't hand him to nobody, nobody except family
And keep him cocked and loaded and don't expose him to no body
Unless somebody, who want him in his body
To love and cherish and from this trigger to a barrel
From the bottom of your heart
'til death do you fuckin' part
Do you understand to live, to lie by him
Is to share your soul, Lord knows, you gone die by him
I know you heard gun stories about John Wayne and Billy the Kid
Shit, all them motherfuckers dead
And did you know that every other bitch from the Wild, Wild West
End up dying from hollow points to they fuckin' chest
Cause I ain't never seen a cock beamer meant for a team of tummy guns
With a hundred round fuckin' drum

Shit, I'm talking about riding out tonight
Only way I die first, got to kill me in this verse
Weezy F middle finger to life
So nothing seem critical in the hood I'm typical
Yet I'm feeling good and spiritual
Healing hoods with this shit up out my kitchen
I'm pitching that it's really good
Smoking, drinking, I'm like a fish
And I'll probably shit on ya bitch
Probably piss on her lips and she probably give you a kiss
Nasty, Holly Grove classic
Polly wood a nigga probably robbed the same bastard
Ask him
We don't give a fuck about a casket
Nigga this the murder campy
Niggas is murder happy

I started selling rock right after I got shot
I had to hold my weight down

All the hating, is no time to respond, I miss tryin' to conjure up
A way to get experience and launder
Hey, I thought ya record company conned ya
Into signing a deal, shy of a mill 'cause they really ain't want ya

Moving yay, it's safe to say that they own to ya
So it's time to move on to real estate
And get cake selling big estates

Hey I could give you what you want, T.I.P.'s the hottest
Gain what ya need, I could tell you all about it
You could up in the streets, but it ain't no gettin' out it
When I tell you I'ma G, pimp I'm really bein' modest
I could tell bout the dope boys, hoes, and the ballers (ho)
The pimps and the macks, real niggas that what they call us
Hangin' in the trap cause dat's what our daddies' taught us
Put 30's on a Lac to a Benz on brawlers
Standin' on the corner, slagin' crack and stackin' dollars
Till it's time to cop a brick and I'm tired of movin' quarters
My dad wasn't a doctor and my momma wasn't a lawyer
I ain't never had shit, congratulation is in order (still trappin')
Tryin' ta get a meal for my sons and my daughter
If I call a bad bitch wit connects down in Florida
Say her daddy and her uncle still getting cross the wall
??? I'd be a motherfuckin' fool if I don't call her

[Chorus]
Ah what it is my nigga, what it do? (hey what it do)
I gotta grip a twin, I'm finna buss a move (ah buss a move)
Ah what it is my nigga, what it do? (hey what it do)

Hey what it do, what it do, what it do, hey what it do
What it do my nigga what it do, hey what it do
Hey what it do, what it do, what it do, hey what it do

[Verse 2: B.G.]
I'ma H-you-S-T-L-E-Rah
If I don't know you then fuck ya
If I know you then I front ya (proper)
But you gotta break me off
You don't, I catch ya slippin' on the block and knock you off
I know people, I get nice deals
Get 'em $5 sell 'em $10 a pill
I know people, big ki's for 13
If I fuck witcha, ya get 'em for 16
I know people, get 'em 300 a pound
Give 'em to ya for 500 if you my round
I'ma hustler, holla at me Uptown
I'm well connected with weed, white, slangin' that brown
Come see a nigga want a nice 60
You real we swap work you fake its 20 g's
It's like that, I done been through the struggle
I'm runnin' Choppa City an fuckin' with Grand Hustle

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
I got the eye of a tiger and the heart of a bear
I'm the king of the jungle, you can follow me there
Or you can hear it from these niggas who was hardly there
Or take it from niggas who fought to make it a star to get here
Several years ago I told myself I solemnly swear
Forever be hard to kill, even harder to scare
One reason why me and other cats is hard to compare
Cause I'm fact, that's fiction, it hardly compares
Bein' hated part of the game, pimp it's hard but it's fair
Well I'ma be the best, hate me, see if I care
But just know I'm raisin' the bar and I'm keepin' there
And I'ma still ride clean, blowin' weed in the air
With 2 or 3 bad bitches got they feet in the air
Say they like when I smack on they ass and skeet in they hair
Listen, I don't care if you got the song of the year
Ya whole show shutin' down when the don appear

[Chorus]",What They Do,2004
T.I.,"Hey! Hey! Hey!

[Chorus]
(But she's a freak though)
She got angel eyes, wit the baby face
(But she's a freak though)
I want my momma and daddy to meet her
Maybe have my baby
(But she's a freak though)
They keep talking about you
Because they - can't keep up with your pace
You're my - super freak! super freak!
You're my - super freak!

My momma taught me, everything fine ain't the finest
And everything that shine ain't a diamond
They say that change come wit time and I'm finding
That most bitches take your kindness for blindness
Yeah it feel good laying her beside you
Diggin' deep, all nine up inside you
But we can't kick out in public, gotta hide you
'Cause all my partnaz in the hood done tried you
It's true that you can't turn a hoe into a house wife
Well listen shorty maybe I don't want a house wife
They say that you a freak I'm thinking that they bout right
Because that pussy's so good and your mouth tight
A pretty face, slim waist, and her stout nice
Juicy ass that them niggaz in the south like
She super sexy, got a nigga thinking bout a wife
Wearing all white, being wit her for life

[Chorus]

The main thing making niggaz judge you
Is the same thing that make me wanna love you
From the smell of ya hair, I wanna hug you
To the way you yell ""give it to me"" when I fuck you
Plus you ain't tripping off a nigga cause he thuggin'
That's why I'm twice as happy as relationships I was in
But my partna say you trickin' wit his cousin
But nevermind, I don't listen they be buggin'
They find it hard to understand how could T.I.P. love
This girl, when her man is out at strip clubs
Maybe cause T.I.P. girls leaving wit girls
And in the morning they'll be waking up with six girls
They don't know we more like homies when we pick girls
Why you worried bout it, he ain't gotta make you his girl
Fuck what he think about you, I think you the shit girl
Make me wanna bring another kid in the world

[Chorus]

Now I been told every nigga in the streets know
She ain't nothing but a freak ho
But when I look in her pretty eyes, I don't see it though
Now she done showed me some shit that I ain't seen before
But what we do behind closed doors is for me to know
All in all I've decided I'm a keep her though
I'm a fucking grown man, what I'm creeping for?
Just try me by the four, that's what I'm toting heaters for
I'd die by that for her a real good reason though
That's how I feel, let my partnaz and my momma know
Keep it real, all the disrespect has got to go
I just respect that she herself and she don't hide it
Though she may have been a tad misguided
All she need is a little affection, a lot of direction
A nigga wit a constant erection
And I done wasted plenty time contemplating second guessing
Procrastinating, I wanna buy a ring and pop the question

[Chorus]",Freak Though [Feat. Pharrell],2004
T.I.,"People, do you understand me now?
Sometimes I feel a little mad
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel?
When things go wrong, I seem a little sad

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

You know sometimes, I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And sometimes seems that all I have is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

If I seem edgy, I want you to know
That I never mean to take it out on you
Life has its problems and I get more than my share
But that's one thing I never mean to do
I don't mean it

People, don't you know I'm only human?
Don't you know I have thoughts like any one?
But sometimes I find myself alone regretting
Some little thing, some foolish thing
That I have done

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Don't let me be misunderstood

When, they ain't runnin' a damn thing but they mouth
No doubt, it's all good, y'all just statin' y'all opinion
But in the South and in the hood it's understood without sayin'
It's a given, and ain't because of what I'm doin' for a livin'
It's, mo' because of what I do and how I'm livin'
Not to mention when I'm rappin' I'm just hurtin' niggaz feelings
(Niggas feelings) And still chillin' on somethin' that's into healing
Made provisions for the clique to continue keepin' it pimpin'
Whether crack was in the house or record sales was through the ceiling
So say what you want, and do what you please
But for fun, I shoot 22's from your shoes to your knees
I run a record label and a crew of G's
So, niggas'll come and look for you if ya sneeze
Or even breathe the wrong way, you better do what the song say
And be easy, or else it'll be a long day

[Chorus]
I'm a king, bank rolls in the pockets of my jeans
I'm a king, you pussy niggaz couldn't see me in your dreams
I'm a king, top topic of all of your magazines
I'm a king, head of the body, leader of the team
I'm a king, remember I can get your block knocked off
I'm a king, a Bentley coupe with the top chopped off
I'm a king, I'm connectin nationwide but in the South
I'm a king, just respect it and keep my name out'cha mouth

I'm the prince shorty don't get it twisted
Been callin' shots simpin' 'fore my flows existed
And still find birds in my momma kitchen
You might see me burnin' purple in the subdivision
I got soldiers on deck, babyface pimpin'
Whatchu' know 'bout dat, I get a bad Brenda
With that vert' top back, my jeans feelin tight
Cause my pockets stay fat, playa better know that
My neck got so much shit, danglin'
Big dick, big chain, we just keep on hangin'
Got a Hollywood ho, and a broad that be sangin'
They be hatin cause I'm famous ? what I was thankin'
And this for every don nigga thankin he passed me
Y'all just thank that you gone and the shit'll be nasty
I'ma stay ballin', ballin' off my old school classic
Lil Scrap got big bank, now see if you can match it

[Chorus]

Shorty I'm down with the kings, so call me the greatest
Number one hustler, I keep the street blazin'
If the grapes don't sell, I dry 'em up and sell raisins
While y'all cherry pickin' hustlers out here slavin'
That king shit nigga runs deep in my veins
Pump through my heart, live in my bone marrow mayne
That's pimpin! My gas is premium like octane
Can't tell me nothin' 'bout stackin' these Benja-maynes
I'm the king of the Dirty, see me seated in the throne
Overruled other dudes like Caesar did in Rome
With a prince that's so demandin' and an aura so strong
The South ain't been represented like this in so long
I'm an emperor, you best be glad I'm workin' on my temper
Otherwise I'd cock a pistol, send some missiles to your temple
Disrespect us I'ma blick 'em 'til I get you plain and simple
Brass knuckles to your dentals blast suckers in they dimples

If ain't want no trouble leave, shit, shoulda left the man alone
It's been seen, shown and evident Atlanta's known
Tha King been the one representing all of Atlanta's zones

Back when niggas was representing Atlanta wrong
Every shot he got, he put the hoods of Atlanta on
The big screen then hit every trap and traveled on
Past, present to Texas to Alabama strong

Down in Miami, up to Louisiana homes
From the Carolinas, Virginia to David Banner's home
I'm well connected, haters, best to mind ya manners homes
I got a nickel-plated 38 but hey, the hammer chrome

And it shine like ya should set the phantom on
In it see me riding, getting blown like the saxophone
Hey shawty, spit the shit, it takes to cut a candle on
If I ain't on ya tube, dude, you must got ya channel wrong

Just a game and a flow that was bonkers
Nigga, front if ya wanna
Dead niggas like the bitches from 'Monster'

Now you been told so don't say I ain't warned ya
And don't let it alarm ya when ya leaking then the reapers upon ya
Speak on me and I'm creepin' upon ya, say that I ain't tha King
But you just sour, you ain't think of it aren't ya

All the hating, is no time to respond, I miss tryin' to conjure up
A way to get experience and launder
Hey, I thought ya record company conned ya
Into signing a deal, shy of a mill 'cause they really ain't want ya

Moving yay, it's safe to say that they own to ya
So it's time to move on to real estate
And get cake selling big estates
(I'm tha King)

I'm King of the South now but it's fifty states
I'ma spread out and I'll eliminate, who in the way?

I'm 24 today, give it to, I'm 28
I'll be ruler of all that I survey and not just in the state

Maybe it's the way a nigga shine in the suit
Or a fresh white tee whatever it might be
A neck like ro or a wrist like freeze
Rings like those, cuff links like these
Baby you ain't never met a man like me
Turn a 9 to a 10 if you can excite me
Before I get one, but you get like 3
Gotta man well you know there's a chance you might cheat
Brothers gonna come up with plans to fight me
I'm only gonna tell â??em once, have â??em finished like a G
You're running with the baldest cannon, I'm gonna pull
So before you take off you're panties
What you have to understand

If I Hit 
Promise 
I ain't gotta hear nothing from ya 
Yo nigga riding up with that drama 
Saying I done cut this woman 
If I Hit 
Promise 
There ain't gonna be no drama 
Tell you yet, â??cause I think I love â??em 
'Cause you let me bend that over 
If I Hit

Body sick
Gotta come here with me

We can hit
Body thick

T.I.,"Chinchilla to the floor, Cigarillo full of dro
White Benz double doors, I could change colors though
Blue Ferrari, red Bent, black truck on 24's
Several Chevrolet's on 20 inches maybe more

Used to wish for better days, now I'm wishin' never more
I could go buy anything, stick my dick in every hoe
Grand Hustle on everything, P$C in every store
Sellin' everything from rubber bands to leather coats

Swear to God I never change, jealous niggaz never know
T.I.P. ain't never been a lame, jigalow since '84
Blessed with astonishing ability to pull a hoe
Fuck her so, good make her think this dick was full of Moe

Pussy so, good but I love it when she suck it slow
(Oh)
Her motto, you don't swallow what you suckin' for
(Oh)
My motto you ain't ballin' what you hustle for
The VVS's let off such a glow to let these bustas know

Hey! Hey! Hey shawty bounce like this just bounce
Let me see you bounce like this
Hey! Hey! Hey shawty bounce like this just bounce
Tell that bitch to bounce like this

Hey! Hey! Hey shawty bounce like this just bounce
All my nigga bounce like this
Hey! Hey! Hey shawty bounce like this
Just bend it over and make it bounce like this

I give you 30 seconds show me what you got, could you?
Bend it over for me drop it like it's hot, could you?
Wiggle your titties a little lift your top get you to
Bust it open show your panties and your ass for me

Actually I was thinking you, Kim and Daphine
In the back with me, lickin' on the bottom half of me
Answer me first know that sayin' no is blaspheme
Me, I'm pussy pumper, number one you can ask for me

I knew how you danced for me that you had plans for me
Save the conversation get your partner out them pants for me
Damn honey, you'd be a fool if you ran from me
You ain't fuckin' wit another dummy I'm the man honey

I'm tryin' to give it to you 'till it make you stand funny
(Oh)
Throw that pussy right and maybe you can get a grand from me
(Oh, ha)
Picture pimpin' givin' you some damn money
Not a one thin dime but your ass is fine

Let me see you, let me bounce with me, bounce with me

Hey shawty, stall if you want to, I ball when I want to
Could fall through and shut down the mall if I want to
I could make your girlfriend choose but I want you
Why you bother me with what you will and you won't do?

Listen shawty, I'm a grown man and you grown too
You can leave with me, I ain't gotta telephone you
All I'm thinking 'bout is me layin' on you
Or vice versa with a lot of ass to hold on to

I got somethin' for that ass to bounce onto
You missin' the chance of a lifetime, why don't you?
Hop off in the drop top, ride through the city lights
Take you where I kick it, let you see what pimpin' living like

Pop one of these then we'll see what you feeling like
Takin' off your clothes, wanna know what it's drilling like
Presidential suite at the very end of the night
Treat you like a freak and give you what was missing in your life

Hey! Hey! Hey shawty bounce like this just bounce
Let me see you bounce like this
Hey! Hey! Hey shawty bounce like this just bounce
Tell that bitch to bounce like this

Hey! Hey! Hey shawty bounce like this just bounce

Hey throw your bottles in the sky if you're gettin' yours
If the rims on his ride ain't as big as yours
You gettin' money what'chu hatin on my niggaz for?
Hey get your mind off of mine and get to gettin' yours
Throw your bottles in the sky if you're gettin' yours
If that other bitch's ass ain't as big as yours
You gettin' money what'chu hatin on my bitches for?
Hey get your mind off of mine and get to gettin' yours

Boss lady pull up in the back of the Maybach
Chaffeur behind the wheel, feet up, leaned back
Readin' the newspaper, honeygirl put a hurtin' on 'em
Haters like a bad act, I just close the curtain on 'em
Play all day on the Siruis, radio
Satellite TV, who do it like me?
In designer outfits, while sellin' the tag
Yves Saint Laurent boots, Yves Saint Laurent bag
Keep the Pokeman in case a big bitch think I'm ass
Eatin' through her stomach like a gastric, bypass
Bitch you better buy a pass and you better have the cash
When you in my town you got to see me to buy a pass
Number one rule, think B.I.G.
50 grand for the girl to sit in V.I.P.
The spotlight is on me, I'm the one they wanna see
They give they money to Kim like I'm H.S.B.C.

[Chorus]

Yeah, well it's young Dash to all those who don't know
The boy who stay hot when his jewels is so cold
Killer screwface and he cockin' that fo'-fo'
Wanna ice grill? Better holla at Paul Wall
Is all that called for? Whole crew do it up
Champagne, threw it up, 'til niggaz threw it up
Cruisin' up, tinted up, gotta be some star
Don't know what to call it, they say it's a truck car
You been with a chump pah; like Ashton
Was the first one to ""Punk"" y'all
Have yo' ass holy and resemblin Spongebob
Like an old album, you happen to come for us
You guys get dust off
It's the young boss, show you what the imp us for
Family and friends be the only ones missin' boy
Sayin' that you rich and all, tell me what'chu bitchin' for
Maybe cause I'm gettin' mine - well is you gettin' yours?

[Chorus]

You don't really want it with the nigga right in front of Tip
Have you duckin' on the shit, wanna let the burner spit
Get bucked bitch, give a fuck who you run and get
King of the South, Pimp Squad Clique runnin' shit
Bricks in the pipeline, sold in the nighttime
Take a lifetime to find a flow that's quite like mine
40 cal's and 45 glocks, I don't like nine
Mac-9 and automatic flatten niggaz lifeline
I'm already rich, use the rappin as a pastime
Grand Hustle bitch and I ain't settle for the last time
Other niggaz settle down cause I don't bag mine
You see me pull it I'ma blast, I don't flash mine
You niggaz livin' check to check but I don't cash mine
Deposit it and let it sit cause all the cash mine
Been goin easy on you rappers I'ma mash now

By bitch I mean fro, hell to heart and had a mack attack
Give me a brick of blow you never seen it flip as fast as that
And you can keep the beef, pussy nigga I don't battle rap
So that bullshit you kickin through yo' teeth a gangsta laughin' at
That shit you hear on ""Gangsta Grillz"" is real, best chill
Before you wake up with some gangsters in your grill and get killed
By a nigga named Big Phil, tote a big steel

I shoot a kite to my potnah Project, locked up doin 45
And let him know I'm still holdin, them Grit Boys is on the rise
A hundred percent no compromise, my momma raised to be a man
I'm not concerned with the next man, gettin money, that's my plan
I'm on the road with that boy Unique, I'm po'n drank he roll the Sweets
T Ferris concocted a master plan, we executed it to the T

I'm on the hustle 25/8, A.T.L. to the lone star state
On the move I'm bleedin' blocks, tryin' to get this paper straight
No time to wait no room for error, the gameplan is crystal clear
I'm tryin' to bolt up 83's and throw some ice cubes in the air
I'm reminiscin', on my potnah Duke that died and passed away
I'm strapped up at all times, if you flex I'ma blast away
Like Tom Hanks on ""Castaway,"" I'm posted up just one deep
Cause these days these hoes out here be plottin' to come up on the creep
And these suckers be on that reach, tryin' to come up off of me
You need to go get it, by yourself and stand up on your own two feet
Look at me I'm star-studded, all because I punch that clock
Burnin' straights out on the block, givin' it all I got

Wanna hear my music? Well, let me open up my door
Release my reefer smoke so you can hear my speakers blow

Now back to the '84 big body to door
No blaze on the muhfucka but it still roll
Memba' what told you what I had stashed in the dash
Back in the past, well, now I got two O's

Ricky tells, two show, comin' out hard
Doors wide open, kids dancin' in the yard
While I'm stuntin' like Evel Knievel man
Bumpin' Cutlass, Monte Carlos and Rivas man

Rollin' in slow mo, like the whole block screwed
Like bill '79, bumpin' Devin the Dude
On the way to the telly, we was bumpin' R. Kelly
And right before I cut her, it was confessions from Usher

She ain't used to a thug, she love the way I ride
While I'm bumpin' My Life by Mary J. Blige
See I damn near cried day Rick James died
See that shit was cold blooded but the music keep pumpin'

I'm just bumpin' my music, music, music

Release my reefer smoke so you can hear my speakers blow

Hey, I like that shit you on, ya dig?
And I got some shit I'ma put you on
I'ma put you on that shit I be on

It was like fuck the police comin' straight from the underground
A young nigga blowin' Big comin' down
A nigga with the attitude easy re-in' Dre and Q
Creepin' up the avenue, that's how you had to do

Yes, I'm the rhythm, the rebel without a cause
Never lowerin' my level
I'm on some Chuck D shit from PE
Six in the mornin' I hustle with Ice T

Six in the evenin' I'm chillin' wit' Willy be
Leavin' out the nickel I'm bumpin' some cool G. Rap
Back to the neighborhood, shoot me some craps
I'm fuckin' wit' that pluck wit' the cool aid pack

And now I got a brotha by the name of Warren Lee
Hot shot Regal illegal, like Marley
I get down like I'm BDP
Ass blaster like blast faster cocked and squeeze

I'm just bumpin' my music, music, music
Bumpin' my music
Wanna hear my music? Well, let me open up my door
Release my reefer smoke so you can hear my speakers blow

Let your shoulder lean, just let your shoulder lean

Dro, I'm clean in this bitch
Now I'm finna shoulder lean in this bitch
Nigga, ball, carbon fifteen in this bitch
This Grand Hustle team of kings is gettin' rich
I lean and get lit, lima bean six
I take breath, the opposite of Primatine Mist
I ride twenty-six and let my nine scream 'flip'
Dro be watchin' Oprah, Mac, nine up in a clip
Triple black phantom nigga, nah, it ain't Tip
With Lucky Charm diamond, but, nah, it ain't Flip

Okay, then I let my shoulder lean
And I bet my car charge, and I bet my motor clean
Suicide doors, Brown Rover look like poke 'n bean
E'rybody know me in the club 'cause they smokin' me, Dro
Hos scopin' me, ice come from Bo Bareeton
Hundred carats have 'em froze for an eon
Red, black, and white Chevy, now I'm ridin' Deion
Put them lights up in my rims, now I'm ridin' neon
Our cars look like crayon, hos know I'm the man though
I can shoulder lean
I dunno how to dance though

First I let my wheels spin, then I let my screen fall
Then I let my trunk beat at Greenbriar Mall, tall
And then I pimp a ho, take a bitch to Berlin

My girl got a girlfriend, Chevy blue like whirlwind
Nigga, it's a drought on that boy, so I got that girl in
Pearl Bent', cockin' hammer, Arm & Hammer propaganda
Bitches think I'm pimpin' and leanin' in salamander sandals
Dirty South hot 'cause Atlanta show niggaz with ammo
We ride Phantom, holla shawty for grammar
Yep, now I be on TV, BET out the channel
Hood nigga from Bankhead, I stay by Grandma Nana
I lay by my banana, dumpin' and punkin' monkeys
Don't nobody live with my mama but a bunch of junkies
Throw me the donkey, bitch, I ride glaze on the haze

That's the A-K forty seven made his neighborhood love me

And tell him catch up like mayonnaise, um
I'm the sickest nigga doin' it
Bet that baby
These other niggas dough I'm wet crack baby, yes
Get back get back boy this a set back
Clumsy ass niggas slip and fall into a death trap
Them boys pussy, born without a backbone
And if you strapped we can trade like the Dow Jones
Wet him up, I hope he got his towel on
I aim at the moon, and get my howl on
Some niggas cry wolf, I'm on that dry kush
And when it comes to that paper I stack books
You heard what I said
I can put you on your feet 
Or put some money on your head
Life ain't cheap
You're better off dead
If you can't pay the fee
Shout out my nigga fee
See every mother fucker at the door don't get a key
You outside lookin' in, so tell me what you see
Its about money its bigger than me
I told my homies don't kill him bring the nigga to me, yea
Don't miss, you fuckin' with the hit man
Kidnap a nigga make him feel like a kid again

The whole motherfuckin' game owe me, time to settle up
If I move forward a little slower, you'll be catching up
Man that's the shit you need to listen for
'Cause where I'm from niggas dumb, they'll give you what you're itching for
It's a issue with you, best to handle your business, bro
'Cause ain't no politicking when killas comin' to get you, bro
Hey, although, they don't know the whole fire
In the dark, shoot sparks like rim with no tire
I don't deal with the lames, I'd much rather blow by ya
They known to spit a lot of hot air like blow dryers
And I'm really off the wire, look at me, I'm on fire
Here's some useful information if you don't know sire
Snort that cake (cake), and I'm not fake (fake)
So you should strongly consider doin' an about-face
And if not all you gotta say is you wanna get busy
And I'm down, get wit' me, any time, pick a city

It's been seen, shown and evident Atlanta's known
Tha King been the one representing all of Atlanta's zones

Back when niggas was representing Atlanta wrong
Every shot he got, he put the hoods of Atlanta on
The big screen then hit every trap and traveled on
Past, present to Texas to Alabama strong
(I'm tha King)

Down in Miami, up to Louisiana homes
From the Carolinas, Virginia to David Banner's home
I'm well connected, haters, best to mind ya manners homes
I got a nickel-plated 38 but hey, the hammer chrome

And it shine like ya should set the phantom on
In it see me riding, getting blown like the saxophone
Hey shawty, spit the shit, it takes to cut a candle on
If I ain't on ya tube, dude, you must got ya channel wrong

Nigga, front if ya wanna
Dead niggas like the bitches from 'Monster'

Now you been told so don't say I ain't warned ya
And don't let it alarm ya when ya leaking then the reapers upon ya
Speak on me and I'm creepin' upon ya, say that I ain't tha King
But you just sour, you ain't think of it aren't ya

All the hating, is no time to respond, I miss tryin' to conjure up
A way to get experience and launder
Hey, I thought ya record company conned ya
Into signing a deal, shy of a mill 'cause they really ain't want ya

Moving yay, it's safe to say that they own to ya
So it's time to move on to real estate
And get cake selling big estates
(I'm tha King)

I'm King of the South now but it's fifty states
I'ma spread out and I'll eliminate, who in the way?

I'll be ruler of all that I survey and not just in the state

I was born into poverty raised in the sewerage
Streets always would be a part of me, it made me the truest
And even when my days weren't the bluest
I never ran from adversity, instead I ran to it
Fear ain't in the heart of me I learned just do it
You get courage in your fears right after you go through it
Now I come through in a Coupe on 22s
That ain't bad for a nigga who ain't even finish school huh?
Don't get me wrong I never been a fool
I just put off graduating for a pair of tennis shoes
I used to use the beats to paint my pain
But nowadays man I can't complain
I got several automobiles and they all on things
Several solitaires and they all in one chain
Used to see me in the mall I'm the same
And brains from a couple broads on the plane

[Common]
I come from Chi-Town lost and found in the struggle
Where dudes say stay safe and stay out of trouble
Speak is muffed the law and B goin' try to cuff you
Those with duffles move weight and have muscles
I came through the dirt with a verse for the people
Open up for Daddy Kane and Easy up at the Regal
The radio rarely put their needle on my record
They ain't see how the hood and heaven were connected
Sounds projected, ain't show how effective
Lessons learned, sessions turned to life reflected
And everything I found real in life know I kept it
They say life's a teacher, you're gonna get tested
When a nigga changed they keep saying that nigga strange
Couldn't see how my mind won't be the lame
Ahead of my time I caught up with the game
Making good music making paper making change

I put on gasoline drawers I stood in the fire
With enough heat to set the hood on fire
Man you niggas think Suge was off the wire
You should've seen the squad before I had Messiah
We assumed the title as the number one supplier
Felt like I was selling blow since I was in diapers
And wish a nigga would come try us
We was cool with the killers, best friends with the lifers
Quick to up and scrap with niggas who want to deny
For what we considered then as a lucrative empire
But like that pimping time flash by you
Now I wonder what the judge think as he reading my priors
Prison ain't full and the reefer ain't bias
You ain't got to tell and distant the liars
Gave the jail hell and shot birds at the hearse
Lived through worse and reversed the curse

Hey, what's happenin'?
It's been a minute, huh? I'm just hollerin'
How you doing? 

It's been a minute since I seen ya,
I fell off for the scene, 
Cause it seem like you wanted other things than da king,
Why you fightin', fussin', cussin', and disagreein' wit da king?
When you got cribs, cars, bling, and a king wit da king?
Is the grass as green as it seemed in ya dreams,
Are you getting all the things that you needed and I ain't bring,
Does it satisfy your self-esteem being seen on the screen,
Is this new nigga the real thing or is just a lil' fling?
Did he buy a nice bracelet and get ya a lil' ring?
Or give you all the attention and the lil' things?
He know what to do with the stuff you stuff in them lil' jeans?
Do he stand up and lean in it 'til you start screamin'? 
Or smack your ass and kiss your G-String to start eatin? (muah),
You get how you need it, not only when it's convenient,
I just pick up the phone and call you every week or two to let you know I miss you,
To see how that other nigga treatin' you.

[Chorus: Governor]
I remember morning, noon, and night, 
I used to hold you tight,
I know we used to fuss and fight ,
But I'm just calling to say (hello) Hello, (hello, oh baby)

Even though we never stayed, toghether,
I just wanted to say (hello) hello (hello)

I know plenty of niggas pursuin' them panties, all for the screwin',
Fly you down to Miami,
Let you walk the red carpet wit a ? at the Grammys,
But I'm what he can never be, a boss, understand me?
He pose and take ? things he buy for ya,
He got you a rose, but that don't mean he'd die for ya, 
Hey, maybe I got too much pride to cry for ya,
But not too much to call you and tell you that I adore ya,
And tell you how I'm missing you, loving you, and kissing you,
And think about the good old days and wanna visit you,
This song I'd like to listen to whenever reminisicin' you,
You, stay on my mind nevermind how I picture you,
Think about the past and all the time that I spent with ya,
Rubbing on that ass from behind as I dig in you, 
Never been a doubt in my mind that I was diggin' you,
How I love you shorty, you'll never find another nigga to

Every now and then I think of you, 
And I can't lie I be wantin' you,
But I understand that I'm not your man,

I'ma gangsta in the game, go ask lil' wayne
Ask judge Johnson, how many times he saw my face
For, ""pistol here, pistol there,"" ""violation here, violation here""

Me I understood from the get go
That what the nigga was tryin' to put
In these motherfuckin' stupid ass niggas faces!
Was the fact that it's a whole bunch of kings down here
And as long as you takin' care of yo' business and doin' king shit you a king!
What these niggas should of been tryin' to do was tryin' to get close to the nigga
And get some understandin' about the type of game
He was tryin' to put in these motherfuckin' niggas ear holes!

They shit ain't cut right, ya shit ain't right!
Shit cloudy and chipped up, know what I'm talking 'bout?
And them niggaz talking 'bout they ""trill niggas""
Don't even know what the motherfuckin' word mean!
Know what I'm talking 'bout? this comin' from the o.g. style trill
Know what I'm talking 'bout? not these ol' fake ass niggas
Tryin' to come on the scene later on and tryin' to take glory for some shit
Some other niggaz paid dues for, know what I'm talking 'bout?

Gave me Diplomatic Immunity you and me why bother
Man all I gotta do is go buy a nigga a charger
And he only come in to offer he don't even wanna rob ya
You done fucked up and started shit wit some real shit starter
You don fought with a chopper holla what it is partner
You better keep it proper you know what it is partner
This some lightwork ain't even gotta call godfather
Mobsta, had the old phantom now the drop son

T.I.,"[Excerpt from ""Sting of The Serpent""]
And the prophecy read that
One day like the phoenix rose from the ashes
That a boy will be born unto a family in the slums
This boy will go on and use the knowledge that he gains
While fighting for survival in the streets
To become a crack leader
And in time that boy will grow to become King!

[Verse 1]
Time to ride nigga (Just Blaze!!)
I welcome you and get acquainted with the youngest in charge
Respected from East to West like he was running the mob
Dictating, ain't taking orders from no one but God
I know you niggas is broke 'cause I know what you charge
Them niggas wishing for a Phantom it's one in my garage
It's black as legary right next to the black Ferrari
You niggas ain't getting money off of rapping I'm sorry
Fuck the rep went and spent 60 large on a Harley
'Cause where he stay 10,012 feet not hardly
Now you see that we ain't able to compete, now are we?
And pardon me I'm giving you the Westside story
Of the A, where I stay and niggas stay down for me
You want to play, have you gay niggas lay down for me
And get a order for killers to spray rounds for me
Competition, you ain't considered; you rapping, you bore me
You reppin the A horribly
Must I say more importantly

[Chorus: x8]
The king back!

[T.I.]
Hey, man y'all niggas got me way too fucked up, you understand that?
What you need to do is homeboy
You need to go back and grab I'm Serious you know
You need to get familiar with Dope Boys and see where
all these niggas got they style
See where that trap shit came from
Then you need to graduate to mother fucking in the Streets Vol.1-3
Then you need to go to Trap Muzik, I got locked up for a second
Then grab Urban Legend and now to bring you up to speed

[Verse 2]
Who knew you could fit on your wrist a whole pound of diamonds
I'm number one on the list while you clowns are climbing
Wishing to be in positions that you found that I'm in
Since you niggas do what it say I'm world renowned than sign me
If Jay handled the clay and around the time
I delivered a bad day when 4 5's were spiraling
I care the least about police and the fireman siren
Ambulance ain't goin' stand a chance in reviving
DOA amend the beef will cease upon my arriving
Paramedics yell clear and your flat line silent
You ain't ready for out here 'cause the lifestyle violent
You think you is, you must be living on Fantasy Island
Your mammies mad, get your ass wiped out like Thailand
Hit my phone and got what left and hit the three while you following
You say you want to release and go to war with the finest
Need you be reminded, want it with Your Highness?

[Chorus]

[T.I.]
Hey man I know y'all niggas still in the trap everyday
Still man I know y'all don't see nothing but the projects nothing but grits
But listen
Make no mother fucking mistake man
I still will shoot up my mother fucking self, AK and
45 nigga on side nigga
And come see 'bout niggas you understand
But I don't want to do that 'cause I respect that shit y'all doing
I started that shit
I made that shit cool
I made these niggas want to be you nigga
Nigga respect this shit!",King Back,2006
T.I.,"What's happenin', man
This T.I.P., you know 
I'd like to dedicate this song to anybody who done ever lost somebody
To the grave, to the streets, to the jail cell
I done been in situations where I done had to cope with all three 
You know what I'm saying? 
I feel like the only thing I ain't done yet is died, you know
But it ain't how I live while I'm here
It's how I live when I leave, ya dig?

[Chorus]
Life's up and downs, they come and go 
But when I die, I hope I live in the sky
All my folks who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky
Pray to God when I die that I live in the sky
It's true what goes around comes back, you know
So when I die, I hope I live in the sky 
All my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky
Tell God I wanna fly, and let me live in the sky

My cousin Toot ain't have to die right in front of his son and his wife
He lost his life struggling over a gun
Give a damn what he done, that's my motherfucking folk 
And I love that nigga to death, no motherfucking joke
I can feel my eyes feelin' the lord is my witness
If I catch 'em, I'm a kill em 
I made it my business
Back in the day you stayed in my business
Taught me I ain't have to incorporate yay in my business
Coincidentally that's why today you not wit' me
My cousin died over some yay, and I miss him
Plus he had his family out, let's say she the eye witness
But her boyfriend did the shooting judge gave a life sentence
I heard that, now I'm dressed up in all black
Shot up the whole apartments and still ain't brought back
The best friend I had in Jamel, I lost that
I guess your death was a lesson in life; it taught me that

[Chorus]

Never seen a nigga go to jail and sleep till day two
Well, that's how sick I was when Jayrue
Found out the hard way that wasn't powder that they were tootin'
Overdosed on heroin, died at twenty-two
If you ain't heard about your daughter, she smile just like you
So cute, even resorts to violence like you
You know ya baby mama loose, but, ha, what can you do?
And I got four myself 
Yeah, it's been a few
Now everything I do is for king, messiah, Dazasha, Demonte
Tell them lord they all I got, so please don't take 'em from me
From me standin' in the trap wit' Qerin and Sir Kap
Laughin' at the niggas who serve with no strap
Tell them niggas, man, y'all trippin' wit' no maps
Get robbed and that's the part where my pistol ain't no help
Me, you, and the crew just fell out over dough and a little crack
Never could apologize 'cause you died; that's why they say that

[Chorus]

I bet you niggas think I'm living it up
Till you see polices laughing as they pickin' me up
Went from seeing how many bitches I can fit in the truck
To three hots and a cot; is you kidding or what?
Fuck how many millions I got, nigga, so what if I'm hot
When I got prices on my head, Feds rushing my spot
A million haters want me dead, forced to carry a gat
But you's a seven time felon, what you doing with that?
It's a Catch 22, either you lose or lose
That's the way the game structured for real niggas to suffer
And I ain't never been a busta, always stood on my feet
Like a man prepared to take whatever coming for me
A pussy nigga or polices wit' a warrant for me
I'm a ""G"" prepared to die for what's important to me
Look anybody in the eye who say he want it wit' me
Put up the house and bet the odds if coming from me
OG's say I need to learn to be patient
You telling me wit' these seven years of probation
Pistol charges, and a host of other open cases
If niggas only knew the kind of time I was facing
I tried to keep to myself but sometimes I couldn't take it
Got four kids, the smiles on they faces
Mean more to me than my crown and my bracelet
Take that away from me and my life is butt naked

[Chorus]",Live in the Sky,2006
T.I.,"Hey, I know you done kicked it with a lot of niggas before
But you ain't never kicked it with a nigga like me
Hey Hey

[Chorus]
I see ya baby, throw ya hands up high
If you wanna come and kick it with a stand up guy
Because the rocks go glisten and the drops on 20's
Bend it over let it drop if you wanna roll wit me

I say all my sexy ladies throw ya hands up high
If you wanna come and kick it with a stand up guy
Because it don't get better, niggas don't get cheddar
Like that fella in the yellow, purple label? sweater

[Verse 1]
The stones keep glowin' on my wrist like whoa
And she can't stop lookin' I know ya bitch like those
And she chose, ain't no question if ya bitch might blow
Just get her to the crib and get her whole back so (sore)
I'ma blow my dro', I'ma pop my peel
Ask anybody wanna take a shot, I will
Might see me in a different color drop, hot wheel
With the top down low, and the glock concealed
I got my niggas who be racing up the block, One mil'
If the police try to chase me you know they a done deal
I got skills, anybody wanna come test
Bet send this .45 will be up in yo chest
A lot of ladies wanna kick it with a nigga so fresh
He could spend a 100k, any day, no stress
The watches is insane, the chain is grotesque
Stay single if you wanna but you gain no cash

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
If you got a man and you're tired of being there
You done gave him too many chances, you're tired of being fair
I give you the opportunity to ride with a player
You, me, and a couple of freaks in the ride with a player
Nevermind those outside, when they stare
Cause the chrome 24's on the ride give a glare
Because of one guy, you decided to share
As long as you having the time of your life, who cares
Man, we all sinners, what matters is in the center
I know god see its hard, and I'm a stand up nigga
You can't beat me 'cause you ain't man enough nigga
I look him in the eye and tell him man up nigga
You really getting money? Throw a grand up nigga
Wanna fight? You should've hit me when you ran up nigga
Really swift, don't waste a hammer, body slam fuck niggas
Go and kick it with the hoes and throw ya hands up with 'em

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You ain't know me 'cause I live so special
Try to stay low key but it's still so special
Flat screens in the floor, quarter mil' in the dresser
Jewelry box glowing like I loan on treasure
I'm chillin' with Vanessa, met a girl named Heather
Told her ""Hi, how ya doin'? Buy a drink? My pleasure""
Told her if she got a home-girl go tell her
That I got a hard rug, I could go for-ever
If Vanessa wanna touch it just let her
If she laughed out loud, I'll be shocked if we just met her
Bought the dro', get low, and its only one-fifth
And it's four peels left, do you wanna come with?

[Chorus]",Stand Up Guy,2006
T.I.,"[Intro]
Grand Hustle Pimp,
Hey, whats happening shorty
Me being a true player and all
I mean you know as a stand up guy you know
I really hate to say I told you so
But, man I told you so
Back when we said we were going to run this shit man
When we said Pimp Squad Click, Grand Hustle was the business
When we said their was a whole another side of Atlanta
Another bunch of motherfuckers in the trap, y'all didn't know

[Chorus]
Man, I told you so
They thought a pimp wasn't supposed to blow
Because I was rapping about moving o's and blow
Pimp I told you so
They thought that Outkast closed the door
And Ludacris came in and sold his 4?
Man, I told you so
The Mac, C-Rod, Kuntry and Dro
And AK had the coldest flow
Nigga, I told you so
I said the future was right up under your nose
You thought the south wouldn't explode no more
Remember, I told you so

[T.I.]
Way back when Kriss-Kross was hollering ""Jump"" on ya tube
They was still getting jumped at school, we used to tote them tools
Don't get me wrong I'll give respect to them dudes
But approach us wrong, and we'll smoke them fools, ain't no joke it's the truth
Fuck a hater, let 'em do what it do
I'm busy now, but I'll be through in a few
And then I'm coming for you
So keep shit talking like it's something to do
I'll spend a 100 grand get a killer something to do
I been hustling since 92' when I heard UGK
Hollering ""Pocket Full of Stones"" I was on my way
Had a history in the yay, before I started to trap
13, let me take you back farther than that
When my uncles was bagging blocks, used to count the stacks
I was only 8, and my grand-daddy can vouch for that
And my pops had a lot of work, a lot of folk he got 'em work
And ran numbers, said if he ain't wanna, he ain't gotta work
Why I sold rocks, I guess I got from pops
My uncles Quentin man and Stan a chip off the old block
The nigga you hear now the same one from off the old block
Who used to stand on Front St. and get off the old block

[Chorus]

I remember the P$C, Killer Mike, David Banner and me and YoungBloodz
Ran through Atlanta with heat, when even Atlanta was sleep
Nigga, back before you heard of me
I was middle man into serving keys when KC was serving 3
I'm on top because I deserved to be
So simmer down, calm your nerves at least
Speak your words with peace
Before you lay out on the curb deceased
Think about it, it's absurd to beef
I took my songs to street
He told me dope boy was the bomb in the street
Since then, my name rang like alarms in the street
Who knew how long it would be
If only LA knew how wrong he could be
I told you ain't nobody stronger than me

[Chorus]

This southern rap shit of the day is something I helped design
Puerto Rico of the mix show I'll let you know who the next in line
The Snowman, Paul Wall, the Thug?
A lot of other niggas shouldn't of even been signed
That's a opinion of mine
Because these niggas be neglecting the grind
Ain't waiting on nobody to let me shine, I'ma go get me mine
And then they wonder why they checks behind
Cause TIP was 20k? back in the day, need me to press rewind
What be on these niggas mind, man don't get me to lying
I seen ya kind, dope boy, and that ain't even ya kind
Ain't never sold a gram of crack, and ain't no need of ya trying
Back in the trap, pimp I don't see him surviving

Shorty, I'm never slippin', got the berretta in vision
And ready to pop the clip in, ready to get to trippin'
Ready to show these folks a celebrity pistol whippin'
Pimp stolen' the automobile, and the roof for the tag missin'

Think I'm bad now, you should a seen me before I had children
Give dick to ya daddy's daughter and they oughta have children
Hope he got some insurance 'cause I definitely have some endurance
Kill her in Mississippi and drive her ass to Missouri

What ya under estimation thought a star wouldn't bust
I got the heart and the guts on this perp I blow
Move ten bricks daily, tryin' to twerk five mo'
Ya see the Cadillac swervin' down Hollywood Road
On the flyest bird in Cali, fuckin' Hollywood hos

The clip in the chopper long as ya leg and leave ya shredded
Pistol way in the truck, and my knife on tuck

Will he live?  Will he die?  Guess he might luck up

A video or not that will bust it to the glock stop
Drag ya out that Bentley Coupe and take it to the chop shop
Partner, we not y'all
If it may pop off
I'll answer the question ""Will I get ya block knocked off?""
And what it is bro
Look I'll kill, bro
I'm in your hood, if you a gangsta what you here for?
Somebody better get bro for he get sent for
You say you wanna squash it what you still talking shit for?

Don't you know I got
Key by the three when I chirp shawty chirp back
Louis nap sack
Where I'm holdin' all the work at

What you know about that?
What you know about that?
What you know about that?
Hey I know all about that
Loaded 44s on the low where the cheese at

T.I.,"[Intro]
Alright man, y'all win
I won't say it, at least for this song, hey

[Verse 1]
Said they looking for the realest, well I'm real as it get
Rap to the nigga dealing hard who live in the jects
Til some better nigga wit her, ain't delivered 'em yet
My mouth is, but I got a pistol bigger than that
I live and die by my respect so I honor the code
Peep niggas who be out here flexing, stunting for hoes
And if you ain't never chose to remember nothing before
Just know the game is some you win, some you don't
But you already begin again, start, it go
Learn to shoot a pistol, flip a O, how hard it go
Man if you ain't ever heard of Pimp Squad before
You better ask a real nigga or a broad you know
Cause you ain't ready for the pros, get it outta ya brain
You in over your head, way out of your lane
I been saying I'm filthy rich and got it from caine
So would you say them niggas know if they done got it the same, right?

[Chorus]
Cause you know who, you know what
Of the you know where, going against us, too unfair
Cause everywhere you do a show, we got kinfolk there
And now you know I ain't no more, not a tinfolk there
It's you know who, you know what
Of the you know where, beef now don't you go there
And if you do, don't use our copy producers, he won't care
If he leave the hood alone, pimping he won't share man

[Verse 2]
I know you think you out there getting it in
But what ya doing, I done did it once and did it again
I had a trap between running while living in sin
He done settling down, turning nine milling or ten
I give a damn if I never sell a million again
I gotta thank you a million for just letting me in
But now I'm settling in, getting used to the view
On top, won't stop til I'm huger than you
Goin' flop? Who? Me, pimp you losing your screws
We gotta dope if you letting niggas shoot into you
You ain't ready for the shit I'm introducing to you
The roof in the back of the park ain't translucent as you
So now your nigga dressing up, man do what you do
I got style, pimp, it's more than just the suit and the shoe
This been proven, I'm the truth, stamp government seal
I'm more than any of these other niggaz, just Southern with deals, for real

I keep telling myself
Man I'm living the good life
(Pharrell)
I'm living the good life

[T.I.]
I was born into poverty raised I the sewerage
Streets always would be a part of me, it made me the truest
And even when my days were the bluest
I never ran from adversity, instead I ran to it
Fear ain't in the heart of me I learned just do it
You get courage in your fears right after you go through it
Now I come through in a Coupe on 22s
That ain't bad for a nigga who ain't even finish school
Don't get me wrong I never been a fool
I just put off graduating for a pair of tennis shoes
I used to use the beat to paint my pain
But nowadays man I can't complain
I got several automobiles and they all on thangs
Several size of tangent and they all in one chain
Used to see me in the mall I'm the same
And get a couple broads giving brain on the plane

[Chorus]

[Common]
I come from Chi-Town lost and found in the struggle
Where dudes say stay safe and stay out of trouble
Speak is muffed the law and be	 gon try to cuff you
Those with duffles move weight and have muscles
I came through the dirt with a verse for the people
Open up for Daddy Kane and Easy up at the Regal
The radio rarely put their needle on my record
They ain't see how the hood and heaven were connected
Sounds projected, ain't show how effective
Lessons learned, sessions turned to life reflected
And everything I found real in life know I kept it
They say life's a teacher, you're gonna get tested
When a nigga changed they keep saying that nigga strange
Couldn't see how my mind won't be the lame
Ahead of my time I caught up with the game
Making good music making paper making change

[Chorus]

[T.I.]
I put on gasoline drawers I stood in the fire
With enough heat to set the hood on fire
Man you niggaz think Suge was off the wire
You should've seen the squad before I had Messiah
We assumed the title as the number one supplier
Felt like I was selling blow since I was in diapers
And wish a nigga would come try us
We was cool with the killers, best friends with the lifers
Quick to up and scrap with niggaz who want to deny
For what we considered then as a lucrative empire
But like that pimping time flash by you
Now I wonder what the judge think as he reading my priors
Prison ain't full and the reefer ain't bias
You ain't got to tell and distant the liars
Gave the jail hell and shot birds at the hearse
Lived through worse and reversed the curse

[Chorus]",Goodlife,2006
T.I.,"[T.I.]
Yeah, yeah, uh, aye! What the fuck I gotta worry about now?

You can keep the car, the clothes, the money and the hoes
Just gimme a couple of O's, drop me off at the sto'
And I'm straaaiiiggghhhttt... hey shawty I'm straaaiiiggghhhttt

And I'm straaaiiiggghhhttt... hey shawty I'm straaaiiiggghhhttt

[T.I.]
I gotta couple of V's wit' the kits, MPV's on my wrist
A lot of glamour and glit's, but shawty I don't need that
My beginnin' was a humble one, a hustler I'ma son of one
Taught me how to number run, I went from that to number one
Had a hundred ones, I bought a slab flipped another one
Sold my little three-eighty east, and said I need another gun
The littlest in the trap, and gotta pack of ice and bubble gum
Junkies hatin' on my stacks, sayin' I'm nuttin but a young
Buck, niggaz say, ""What?"" Then he see me raise up
Just wanna see the little boy wit' nuts exchange old niggaz whole face soon
'Cause I spray the nigga's whole face up, wet the nigga from the waist up
They try you once and you pull a fall, and then tell 'em shaw' don't play wit 'em
I'm fourteen in the dope game and don't care of catchin' no case bruh
You can sell to me, that's intentionally, another nigga that it's too late for
Hey wait bruh, bet any nigga came from that?
Who lose it all the day, I bet he say he changed from that

Hey you can keep the game and the fame, the haters and the lames
Just gimme some cocaine and some wood I can slang
And I'm straaaiiiggghhhttt... hey shawty I'm straaaiiiggghhhttt

Okay now, now when I spit it, I spit it how I live it
Every verse I ever gave ya, it was fact, nothin' fiction
I'ma +Livin' Legend+.. no stuntin', no reppin'
You can check my track record, I'm highly respected
I'ma gangsta in the game, go ask Lil' Wayne
Ask Judge Johnson, how many times he saw my face
For, ""pistol here, pistol there,"" ""violation here, violation here""
Betta ask Rank, I ran the jail when I was there
I held it down, where-ever I go
When I'm in the A wit' the +King+, or in Detroit in the snow
I'ma pro, whether it's movin' snow or movin' 'dro
That's between me and you, I can get it for the low
But that's nuttin, everybody say they gotta story
Mine on ""Larry King,"" theirs is on ""Maury""

Matter fact nigga you can just ask me (me)
A little over aggressive, yeah I just might be
But half the niggaz in the hood just like me (damn!)
You wonder why a nigga talk eight balls all day?
You should try standin' around wit' eight balls all day (YEEEAAAHHH!!)
Somebody pray for me, I don't know nothin' else (AYE!)
Why should I help you, when you ain't tryin' to help yourself
I came in this game, fresh out the streets (yeah)
Who you kiddin' nigga, I put my life on these beats (YEAH!)
Fuck bein' broke, this a reality check (check)

[Pimp see - talking after song ends]
Say what it do? Young Pimp see know what I'm talkin 'bout?
Yeah, nigga want me to speak on some ""king"" shit, know what I'm sayin'?
On the cool why'know.. young nigga T.I. jumped out there
Said he was the king of the south
He ruffled a whole lotta niggaz' feathers
But niggaz didn't really understand what the nigga was talkin 'bout
Why'know.. and uh.. so everybody had it twisted but..
Me I understood from the get go
That what the nigga was tryin' to put
In these motherfuckin' stupid ass niggaz' faces!!
Was the fact that it's a whole bunch of kings down here
And as long as you takin' care of yo' business and doin' king shit you a king!
What these niggaz shoulda been tryin' to do was tryin' to get close to the nigga
And get some understandin' about the type of game
He was tryin' to put in these motherfuckin' niggaz' ear holes!
Understand what I'm sayin'?
So I'm layin' back I'm watchin' the game from the sideline
Know what I'm talkin 'bout?
And I'm seein' all these ol' pussy ass niggaz out here
Talkin 'bout they this and they that, but they really ain't doin' nothin!
'Cause they motherfuckin' paper ain't right
When I see them in the street, they diamonds fake! Know what I'm talkin 'bout?
They shit ain't cut right, ya shit ain't right!
Shit cloudy and chipped up, know what I'm talkin 'bout?
And them niggaz talkin 'bout they ""trill niggaz""
Don't even know what the motherfuckin' word mean!
Know what I'm talkin 'bout? This comin' from the O.G. style trill
Know what I'm talkin 'bout? Not these ol' fake ass niggaz
Tryin' to come on the scene later on and tryin' to take glory for some shit
Some other niggaz paid dues for, know what I'm talkin 'bout?
So this is what is.. we bringin' Georgia and Texas together
All you ol' BITCH ASS NIGGAS that ain't down wit' the play
Move on to the side, all you old school rappers like 'Pac say
You niggaz flabby, lookin' like Larry Holmes

T.I.,"Country had fronted me twenty keys told me to keep 20 G's
And forgot to tell me twenty five to eternity.
Now picture me, in a GS3 with all my fold
Versaci Coat, and Armani lobe from slangin' coke.
This ain't no joke situation nigga I'm I'll with it
My occupation clockin' six figures so deal with it.
My mob be cannon, pealin'? over Teflon protect my belly
From nine millimeter cannon while talkin' on celly's daily
Niggas frontin' 'like they makin' pay
This is real pimpin', key comin' straight from the C.I.A. and Bill Clinton.
You kinda thugs ain't got a clue do you?
Hey who the man who supply the man who supplying you with a couple grand?
Interracial freedom for some luxuries This ain't the bet.
Nigga materialistics can't substitute for your happiness.
Life's about how you feel about you and what you do
When you waking up in the morning you seeing who?
I think you niggas done bit off more than you can chew
Cause you don't even know why you do half that hot ass shit you do.
Why I'm trappin' 'cause it's the only job with fair taxes.
Keep a nigga in tight to death in Polos and air maxes
I'm blastin' these niggas daily whenever they try to play me
Baby you wanna lay me, but baby you gotta pay me.
Nigga you owe me cheese, that's ground for beef
I'm rollin' with the P$C with a pound of chief.
Hey if this rap shit don't work, I'm stuck slangin' drugs, 
Until I make enough money to go and buy me a club.
I got thirty six ounces that I got to move 
And twenty keys comin' to me on the fourth of June.
Soon as the school year ends, I pick up my keys
So crank the V12 to down to females and place em with cheese.
Two hundred G's for the package, but they 10-5 a piece now.
On the streets they goin for 21-5 at least
21-5 times twenty Look that's 4-30
But listen closely cause the dope game get more dirty.
If I cut em into ounces, 28 grams for 800 a piece
Hey thirty six of them in a key, more cheese for me.
Now there's 28 G's and 800 cash just for one key, 
And I got nineteen more stashed.
Two hundred and eight G's at eight hundred times nineteen more, 
Come out to 5-4-7 comma 2-0-0
That's 547 G's and two hundred
Forty seven G's you can ball 200 get blunted
The other 500 G's invest it in keys
So I can triple my cheese and have a million at ease.
That's how it is, this game ain't no life time deal
You better get as much cheese as you can and get the fuck outta here.",Drug Related [Non Album Track Explicit Version],2006
T.I.,"What's happenin', man
This T.I.P., you know 
I'd like to dedicate this song to anybody who done ever lost somebody
To the grave, to the streets, to the jail cell
I done been in situations where I done had to cope with all three 
You know what I'm saying? 
I feel like the only thing I ain't done yet is died, you know
But it ain't how I live while I'm here
It's how I live when I leave, ya dig?

[Chorus]
Life's up and downs, they come and go 
But when I die, I hope I live in the sky
All my folks who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky
Pray to God when I die that I live in the sky
It's true what goes around comes back, you know
So when I die, I hope I live in the sky 
All my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky
Tell God I wanna fly, and let me live in the sky

My cousin Toot ain't have to die right in front of his son and his wife
He lost his life struggling over a gun
Give a damn what he done, that's my motherfucking folk 
And I love that nigga to death, no motherfucking joke
I can feel my eyes feelin' the lord is my witness
If I catch 'em, I'm a kill em 
I made it my business
Back in the day you stayed in my business
Taught me I ain't have to incorporate yay in my business
Coincidentally that's why today you not wit' me
My cousin died over some yay, and I miss him
Plus he had his family out, let's say she the eye witness
But her boyfriend did the shooting judge gave a life sentence
I heard that, now I'm dressed up in all black
Shot up the whole apartments and still ain't brought back
The best friend I had in Jamel, I lost that
I guess your death was a lesson in life; it taught me that

[Chorus]

Never seen a nigga go to jail and sleep till day two
Well, that's how sick I was when Jayrue
Found out the hard way that wasn't powder that they were tootin'
Overdosed on heroin, died at twenty-two
If you ain't heard about your daughter, she smile just like you
So cute, even resorts to violence like you
You know ya baby mama loose, but, ha, what can you do?
And I got four myself 
Yeah, it's been a few
Now everything I do is for king, messiah, Dazasha, Demonte
Tell them lord they all I got, so please don't take 'em from me
From me standin' in the trap wit' Qerin and Sir Kap
Laughin' at the niggas who serve with no strap
Tell them niggas, man, y'all trippin' wit' no maps
Get robbed and that's the part where my pistol ain't no help
Me, you, and the crew just fell out over dough and a little crack
Never could apologize 'cause you died; that's why they say that

[Chorus]

I bet you niggas think I'm living it up
Till you see polices laughing as they pickin' me up
Went from seeing how many bitches I can fit in the truck
To three hots and a cot; is you kidding or what?
Fuck how many millions I got, nigga, so what if I'm hot
When I got prices on my head, Feds rushing my spot
A million haters want me dead, forced to carry a gat
But you's a seven time felon, what you doing with that?
It's a Catch 22, either you lose or lose
That's the way the game structured for real niggas to suffer
And I ain't never been a busta, always stood on my feet
Like a man prepared to take whatever coming for me
A pussy nigga or polices wit' a warrant for me
I'm a ""G"" prepared to die for what's important to me
Look anybody in the eye who say he want it wit' me
Put up the house and bet the odds if coming from me
OG's say I need to learn to be patient
You telling me wit' these seven years of probation
Pistol charges, and a host of other open cases
If niggas only knew the kind of time I was facing
I tried to keep to myself but sometimes I couldn't take it
Got four kids, the smiles on they faces
Mean more to me than my crown and my bracelet
Take that away from me and my life is butt naked

We was high school peers, in Junior High
I was itching' to kill, and you was, 'Ready To Die'
While you bullshitting niggas was dying and catching cases
Busting my automatics at motherfucker's in foreign places
Leaving no trace, they see my face and then they buried
Bitches die in a hurry, still I ride, I'm never worried
Mr. Makaveli tell me to ride and I'mma ride
Pick my enemies out the crowd, and motherfucker's die

Way out sortin' trouble tryna find me king
Never pictured livin' longer than my twenty-first

We had no intentions of becoming homies
But at no time at all, you became my dog
You showed me how to roll blunts, we used to bounce and ball
I was living on wilshire in the penthouse suites
Had my lil' cousin daz hook you up with some beats
It was outlaw, dogg pound, death row records, man we tore up the town
Snoop dogg and dr. Dre and now we got Pac, it felt like a drizzeam
Remember when I told suge to put you on the tizzeam
And you know that I was true
Cause I took the focus off of me to put 'all eyez on you'
And we became the most hunted together, '2 of amerikaz most wanted'

While she givin' head hangin' off the edge of the bed
Thought she had a milkshake when her bang pop out her head
Pussy fat like Bone Crusher plus the ho ain't ""Never Scared""
She licked all the dogs balls scratched all the pussycats
So she goes both ways, yeah she's a brainiac
Knowin' this information how can you be cuffin' that and lovin' that
Already they heard another one they hittin' that and gettin' that
I know you want the ho she like clothes, very trendy

And she do it all day cause she really love the taste

Freakin' all on the floor wit his girlfriend in the club
And wonder why all these playas tryin' to holla at her
Just soon as she go to the bathroom, nigga I'm goin' holla at her
A dog on the prowl when I'm walkin' through the mall
If I could man I probably would flirt wit all y'all
Yeah, yeah homie u say she ya girlfriend
But when I step up to her I'm be like cousin
Believe me man, this is how them playas do it in the Chi
And plus we got them player-ette flirters in the Chi
Now the moral of the story is cuff yo bitch
'Cause hey I'm black, handsome, I sing plus I'm rich and (I'm a flirt)

Hey homie, if you ain't gettin' no money
You better keep her away from me ya dig

Well if u love ya girl
And wanna keep ya girl
Don't be walkin' up and askin' me to meet ya girl
'Cause I'm well enough a flirt when I speak to girl
She winked her eyes on the slide
I seen u girl
Better treat your girl right
'Cause another man will
Better eat ya girl like another man will
'Cause u leave your wife
And I see ya wife
That be for real
How long u think that's finna be ya wife
Well I'm livin the life
You just gettin' it right
Your old lady look at me
'Cause you ain't hittin' it right
She probably used to like u
'Cause you you the better type
That's until I came along
And put some dick in her life
Wanna see me dance
I noticed she was checkin' me
And diggin' the ice
And if I get that tonight
Better hit that twice
I can even make her mine
If I hit that right
You know smack that thang
Sit that right
Upon that dresser
Yeah that's right
Pullin' on her hair
Like we gettin' in a fight
Yeah I know it's kinda tight
But it'll settle just right
So if yo girl sexy
And she test me
Don't be upset g
'Cause u might catch me
Tryin to catch a glance up her skirt

We playing in my glam in reverse
Then if I see her and I like her then I'm a flirt

When I, when I, when I,when I pull up to club
All the shawties be like (Damn 28's)
Then I be like girl u know just who I am (Don't hate)
See I done fell in love wit a stripper y'all
All I do is flirt with her, and I get them draws
And I don't need no help, I got it down pact
Teddy Paine was born to flirt now you can't down that
Now I'm flirt with her whether I'm in or out of town
That's why they call me teddy bend her ass down
I be like como si llama, lil' mama mi llamo pain, what is yo name

And I'm hopin' you feel the same
I'm a wink my eye and let you know I got the game

Soon as I see her walk up in the club (I'm a flirt)

Sometimes when I'm with my chick on the low (I'm a flirt)

T.I.,"Yeah, Willie The Kid
Bright lights, street lights

Summertime in apartment 409,
Had to clean up the kitchen with 409,
It Was cookin' up work, while my granny at work
My big cause he ain't understand me at first,
He said, the court room or the casket,
I'm like dude, either way you need cash and a nice suit,
The street lights where I found my strength
Be with four rich men, and you bound to be the fifth
Let's go

I lost my daddy at a early age,
Told my mama don't cry for me,
If I trade tomorrow in for yesterday, oh how much different my life would be,
But that's in my dreams, back to reality,
Tryna get outta these street lights, so I won't have to live this street life,

No more, no more 
No more, no more no

Just gotta learn to deal with problems,
If you're young and from slum with no father,
Got killed when you was little, still got mama,
She try to tell him go to school, but why bother
When gettin' paid is the only way to solve 'em
Seems the stars get farther and farther
Out of my reach, out of these streets,
Will they ever make it big

Cause I lost my daddy at a early age,
Told my mama don't cry for me,
If I trade tomorrow in for yesterday, 
Oh how much different my life would be,
But that's in my dreams, back to reality,
Tryna get outta these street lights, 
So I won't have to live this street life,

No more, no more 
No more, no more no

I ain't ashamed to say that I shed a tear
Thinkin bout my dad I wish I had him back,
I'd give up everything just to have him here,
After this storm and rain I have no fear,
Gotta keep holdin on, hold my head up strong,
I know it won't be long until we'll be together again, foreal

I'm livin' for the moment
If I could turn back the days
Sure, you could turn this back
Hey, I was born with the hustle, never been a sucker
Daddy wasn't in the crib, dat made me tougher
Momma struggled with the bills, dat made me stuff up
Powder in a sack, which made me dumber
Now I'm standin' on the corner, bag full of Marijuana, Crack
Pistol my pocket for anybody who disrespect
In the trap chillin' where robbers and killers, kick it at
My arms up in the feds for ten, they say I'm goin' in
Ha, bet dat I'm a stretch that, backish to this rappers
Show these niggas what I'm best at
Get a lil' check, flip it and invest that
Years later, oh now you see what my heads at
Like meals chasers, we be everywhere the bread at
You keep on hatin', you'll be layin' where the dead at
You rappers suckers, you can tell them that I said that
If nothin' else but the hustle, you gon respect that

Oh yeah
I lost my daddy at a early age,
Told my mama don't cry for me,
If I trade tomorrow in for yesterday, 
Oh how much different my life would be,
But that's in my dreams, back to reality,
Tryna get outta these street lights, 
So I won't have to live this street life,
No more, no more
No more, no more
No

Guess, this is my life
And I wanna live it right

",That's Right,2007
T.I.,"(I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a) flirt
Soon as I see her walk up in the club (I'm a flirt)
Winkin' eyes at me, when I roll up on them dubs (I'm a flirt)
Sometimes when I'm with my chick on the low (I'm a flirt)
And when she's wit her man looking at me, damn right (I'm a flirt)
So homie don't bring your girl to meet me 'cause (I'm a flirt)
And baby don't bring your girlfriend to eat 'cause (I'm a flirt)
Please believe it, unless your game is tight and you trust her
Then don't bring her around me 'cause (I'm a flirt)

Now swear to tell the truth
And the whole truth
When it comes to hoes I be pimping like I supposed to
Rolling like I supposed to
Shining like I supposed to
In the club, fucking with honeys like I supposed to
I don't understand it when a nigga bring his girlfriend to club
Freaking all on the floor with his girlfriend in the club
And wondering why all these players trying to holla at her
Just soon as she go to the bathroom, nigga I'm gonna holla at her
A dog on the prowl when I'm walking through the mall
If I could man I probably would flirt with all of you
Yeah, yeah homie you say she's your girlfriend
But when I step up to her I'm gonna be like, ""cousin""
Believe me man, this is how them players do it in the chi
And plus we got them playerette flirters in the chi
Now the moral of the story is cuff your bitch
'cause hey I'm black, handsome, I sing plus I'm rich and (I'm a flirt)

(I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a)

Hey homie, if you ain't getting no money
you better keep her away from me your dig.

Well if you love you girl
And wanna keep you girl
Don't be walking up and asking me to meet you girl
Because I'm well enough a flirt when I speak to girl
She winked her eyes on the slide
I've seen you girl
Better treat your girl right
'cause another man will
Better eat you girl like another man will
'cause you leave your wife
And I see you wife
That be for real
How long you think that's finna be you wife
Well I'm living the life
You just getting it right
Your old lady look at me
'cause you ain't hitting it right
She probably used to like you
'cause you're the bitter type
That's until I came along
And put some dick in her life
Wanna see how that ass looking thick in the light
I noticed she was checking me
And digging the ice
And if I get that tonight
Better hit that twice
I can even make her mine
If I hit that price
You know smack that thing
Sit that right
Up on that dresser
Yeah that's right
Pulling on her hair
Like we getting in a fight
Yeah I know it's kinda tight
But it'll suit 'er just right
So if yo girl sexy
And she test me
Don't be upset g
'cause you might catch me
Trying to catch a glance up her skirt
The McLaren in reverse
Then if I see her and I like her then I'm a flirt

(when I, when I, when I, when I) pull up to club
All the shawties be like (damn twenty-eight,eights)
Then I be like girl you know just who I am (don't hate, hate)
Say I done fell in love wit a stripper you all
All I do is flirt with her, and I get them draws
And I don't need no help, I got it down pact
Teddy paine was born to flirt now you can't down that
Now I'm flirt with her whether I'm in or out of town
That's why they call me teddy bend her ass down
I be like como se llamas little mama? mi llamo pain, what is your name?
I'm feeling your vibe
And I'm hoping you feel the same
I'm a wink my eye and let you know I got the game
When I pass by I know exactly what you say
He's so fly
And yes, he's so cool
Hey shawty (hey shawty)
What it do
He's mad 'cause I'm looking but I already fucked her
I got these niggas mad 'cause (I'm a flirt)

(I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a) flirt
Soon as I see her walk up in the club (I'm a flirt)
Winkin' eyes at me, when I roll up on them dubs (I'm a flirt)

(I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a)

It's the remix
Now if you walk up in the club
With a bad chick
And she's looking at me
Then I'm gonna hit
Man jacking for chicks
I tried to quit
But I'm player homie
So I had to hit
While you buying her drinks (in the club)
Acting like you (in love)
Stunting like you (all thug)
We was (switching numbers)
She looking at you when I walk by
you turn your head, she winks her eye
I can't help if she checking for a platinum type of guy
She be calling me daddy, and I be calling her mommy
She be calling you Kelly, when your name is Tommy
I don't know what you all be thinking
When you bring 'em round me (mane)
Let me remind you that I am the king of R&B (mane)
Do you know what that means?
That means if you love your chick
Don't bring her to the v-i-p
'cause I might leave with your chick
Just keeping it real my nigga
It's a player's feel my nigga
Don't take no bitch to the club when you just met her my nigga
'cause I'm flirt with her (right)
He's gonna flirt with her (right)
And if she's licking that good shit
She gonna flirt with 'em

In a drop top chevy with the roof wide open
My partners looking at me to see if my eyes open
Cause I've been drank, and I've been smoke
Flying down 285 but I'm focused
Its a four fifty four, where it says I raise comotion
White leather seats, as fresh as air forces
Doing bout a hundred but the track still bumping
Number 8 on nwa straight out of compton
Pull up at your apartment sitting on 24s
And the dope boys, saying the kids running in
The clicks start dealing and the broads start choosing
And the cars been parked but the rims keep moving
Sign pictures by the hundred, to the youngins in the hood
Cause I ain't hollywood, I come from the hood
I'm use to it, if your rear view shaking and your seats vibrating
24 inch jays got the chevrolet shaking

T.I.,"I Mr. Thanksgiving
Its for the money this time

Howdy do motherfuckers its Weezy Baby,
Niggas bitchin' and I gotta toke the cannon.
Listen close I got duct tape and rope,
I'll leave you missin' like the fuckin' O'bannons.
One hand on my money, on hand on my buddy,
That's the A-K forty seven made his neighborhood love me.
Bullets like birds you can hear them bitches hummin',
Don't let that bird shit, he got a weak stomach.
Niggas know I'm sick I don't spit I vomit,
Got it?
One egg short of the omelet.
Simon says, shoot a nigga in his thigh and leg,
And tell him catch up like mayonnaise, um.
I'm the sickest nigga doin' it,
Bet that baby.
These other niggas dough I'm wet crack baby, yes.
Get back get back boy this a set back,
Clumsy ass niggas slip and fall into a death trap.
Them boys pussy, born without a backbone,
And if you strapped we can trade like the Dow Jones.
Wet him up, I hope he got his towel on,
I aim at the moon, and get my howl on.
Some niggas cry wolf, I'm on that dry kush,
And when it comes to that paper I stack books.
You heard what I said,
I can put you on your feet 
Or put some money on your head.
Life ain't cheap,
You're better off dead.
If you can't pay the fee,
Shout out my nigga fee.
See every mother fucker at the door don't get a key,
You outside lookin' in, so tell me what you see.
Its about money its bigger than me
I told my homies don't kill him bring the nigga to me, yea.
Don't miss, you fuckin' with the hit man,
Kidnap a nigga make him feel like a kid again.

Straight up, I ain't got no conversation for ya,
Nigga talk to the (cannon)
Have a few words with the (cannon)
Tell it to my mother fuckin' (cannon)

Ayo
I make it hard for rap niggas I'm peer pressure,
Matter fact I'm motivation to rap better.
I show niggas how to act how to dress better,
I stay fresh more fitted caps than bat catchers.
I'm the crack 
The smack 
The gun 
The rule 
The gat 
The strap 
The gun 
The tool 
The motherfuckin' (cannon).
Other words I'm the real, for real
We can go check for check or bill for bill,
We can go chick for chick or skill for skill,
The deal is sealed.
Niggas ain't real as Will cause I'm a (cannon).
And I handle well pedal like Cannondale.
And I got the fifty cal mag its a hand-held.
I'm tellin' you niggas I pop put a shell in you niggas,
My nice watch'll Helen Keller you niggas.
I got whores in the cannon camcorder bendin' over
Blowin' game by the quarter weed over in the Rover nigga

From Philly to where I'm landin I'm a cannon.
And I'm on that Philly fire shit,
Then I come fully equipped.
You try me get bodied keep the shawty in the whip.
If a nigga try to stick me I'm a blam him.
Sing a long da da da di I'm free got the butters 
Got the green and got the tan got the whole enchilada.
Homie know I'm inside of your house,
Tie up your brother.
Make the prick call up your mother 
She might know where to find you.
I am, on top of my job
The heavyweight champ of the flow
Its flow like the ocean, open water you drownin'
I will, four pond 'em 
And sink them heat 'em and leave 'em stinkin'.
Sharks surround them and eat them nice then know that I will.
Roll over ya squad like I'm a one punch card.
You chumps, you best call General Motors.
I will, take control of your soldiers.
You wont listen till I toss them in the wok like chicken.

T.I.,"[Chorus]
Hey don't ya wanna be high? 
Hey listen baby come fly with me, take a ride, get high with me. 
I know you wanna be high. 
You never wanna say bye to me, if you ever come fly with me. 
Hey don't ya wanna be high? 
Hey, listen baby, come fly with me, take ride, get high with me. 
I know you wanna be high. 
Promise you'll never say bye to me, if you ever get high with me.

The bucket's on tilt, truck is on stilts 
I did another deal today, at least a couple mil'. 
No I'm askin' you to chill, wanna pat that down I'm tryin to pick you up 
And never put your ass back down. 
Get rid of all your worries, why you draggin' that around? 
Here pop one of these and now pass that around. 
Fire it up, take a shot, now your ass in the clouds. 
Can I bend ya over, throw your ass back down? 
No need sayin' no, we way pass that now. 
I ain't them other niggas, just control the flashback now.
Make three wishes, you can have that now. 
Fuck the finacin', payin' cash right now. 
Miracle man, make your dreams come true. 
Take a ride, get high, bout time you come too.
Bet ya life done changed, ya likin' my last name Done 
Had a couple babies, with a Bentley and a Range. 
Crib on the water, eatin' meals on the plane 
And ya life in the sky like you lived on a plane. 
So much good shit to fill ya brain, 
If the band seem strange, I'm just sayin'

[Chorus]

You see me chillin' out, kickin back in the ride, 
With fly broad on the passenger side. 
Got a nice smile and immaculate eyes. 
Fore' she get inside, she don't have to decide.
Cause she can have it like she want it, we can do it like that. 
And I went and threw it to her and she threw it right back. 
She say nobody gave it to her like that, Hit it from the back, 
I figure you would like that. 
Her head and tight pussy good like that 
And damn she ain't even from the hood like that 
So she probably never kicked it with a cool nigga other niggas had her, 
Didn't know what to do with her. 
Intimidated by her face and her cute figure. 
Cause her waist real small and her ass way bigger 
Don't she know that if I want her, I ain't finna play with her. 
All I gotta do is spend a A with her

[Chorus]

Hey what it is, pretty girl, 
Would you like to come and kick it with a nigga for a night or two 
And you can take your clothes off if you like to. 
And it don't matter 'bout the cost if I like you I just do it shorty, 
I ain't gotta try t. Bust a move, bet ya I can set a fire in you. 
Me chase round behind you? Why boo? 
I'm like you, you know you fly, but I'm fly too. 
You know how to do it, always ride good. 
Match the paint with the wheels, the trunk and the hood. 
You dealin' with a real nigga, get it understood. 
I'm still in the hood, even when in Hollywood. 
With my beat down low and my top let back 
You lookin' for a G. well you got just that
Well I can be a King and you can be my princess Baby all you gotta do is say yes.

With two revolvers in my pocket pitchin' handling rocks

You want to know how much money I'm makin' just imagine a lot (10-20)
I'm probably making more than you'd imagine I got (30-40)

Bring 'em out bring 'em out
Show 'em where they at
We can do them right here
We can catch them in a trap

Run up on this nigga
Put a hole in his hat
Put his brains on the dash in the stalks
He has some dumb fifty more with him
Tell them to hold that
Lights out no hasta manana hasta la vista sara nara y tu
No tomorrow no remorse no sorrow
And the next one of y'all niggas try me like that
I swear to God man
I'm really gonna snap

Ain't a damn thing change
I still keep that thing
Right up under my shirt
When I pull away hang and bang
'Cause it all fun and games
Until somebody get hurt

Ain't a damn thing change
I still keep that thing
Right up under my shirt
When I pull away hang and bang
'Cause it all fun and games

[Chorus]

Way now over there
I'm a now how to make a nigga beg please
When a bullet goes by
Probably feel a little breeze
Drop to yo knees
I can see the big barrel of the chrome flip
Double grip ain't no where to squeeze
I keep a couple lit off for the niggas who talk shit
When I go to Jacob and I cop that brain
If he tried to see me
I'm a cop that thing
And I'm pop that thing
And the shots gonna stay
The nigga bout to set the trunk wit me
For the most part nigga your stuck with me
I'd tell you something if you was really smart
And you knew better
People probably tell ya
Don't fuck with me
Front if you want mothafucker
You can catch it
The smile on my face
Even if I got a ratchet
Aah Pop off police pull me over
Believe I got a compartment
And now gotta stash it
Must I just remind ya niggas
When I come through
Know that I am a fine ya niggas
Take two break through
Bust so many shots
Come now I'll probably blind y'all niggas
Now okay
Lets go see you don't really want to feel a mobs search blow
Clap up a nigga then I cap up a nigga
When I finish this shit we'll turn it into an obsearch yo
Look, Listen, then you better observe yo,
Listen to the sizzle from the bullet that the glock burst fro (sss)
Should a probably tweaked you up just a little
And had your body leanin, lookin' like a quarter past four
Stay down better, (stay down) checkin' for a nigga who can put yo body in the dirt (ooh)
I don't play bitch
If you really need to go the other way
You know I got it under way, Sir.

Ain't a damn thing change
I still keep that thing
Right up under my shirt
When I pull away hang and bang
'Cause it all fun and games
Until somebody get hurt

Ain't a damn thing change

You gotta get your swagger together nigga (ay)
Get your suit fitted (ay)
Starts on the inside, ya dig?
I don't need mine, I got cribs where we goin' (okay)
If you don't love yourself you can't love nobody
Keep up nigga (okay) I love myself
You goin' need to travel ladies, you go and got that Mack diesel right

[T.I.]
I'm the man from Atlanta, to way out in Cali
Catch me in New York, I'm on the way to Miami
I be in Hawaii, then catch me in Paris
I be at home barely, I'll sleep when I'm buried
What I need some sleep for? This dope got me geeked up
I went to Japan and made a mil' in a week bro
These niggas can't keep up cause they see me in London
Or out in Ibiza, that time I ain't sleep for
Bout three days maybe, you see me in Haiti
With Wyclef Jean and a selection of ladies
But my folk got that work in like they back in the 80's
See the money's what move me, conversation don't phase me

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean (T.I.)]
(Tell 'em why cause I) Been around the world
Traveled the seven seas (and I be)
Poppin' bottles with celebrities (so you can find me)
Flyin' high, smokin' better trees (ay, oh-ay-ay)
Girls around the world (yo, yo)
They keep callin' me (they call me)
Paparazzi they be follow me (they all be)
Hopin' that they get a shot of me
It's my swag (they wonder what's so special 'bout him)
(Why they ain't sellin' records like him, tell 'em)
It's my swag (how he always look so cool)
(That why everybody do what he do, tell 'em)
Gotta be my swag (they wonder why he wear his hat like that)
(When girls see him why they act like that, hey, I don't know)
It's my swag (for some reason all the real niggas love him)
(Even though they girlfriend wanna fuck him, I guess)
Gotta be my swag

Gettin' money in Frisco, wearin' my raincoat
See I'm gettin' wet, and this bitch in the same boat
I came in the game slow, they act like they ain't know
That I wasn't gon' leave until I got what I came fo'
I still can't complain though, as long as I ain't broke
I came a long way but shorty ain't nothin' changed though
I still let the tool go, don't get it confused bro
Run up on me wrong, now what you think I'ma do bro?
Send you to your maker, then go to Jamaica
Or either to Cabo, I chill at my condo
My swagger is perfect, hatin' on me ain't worth it
Guarantee you boy, the Earth my turf, if it hurts

Regardless what haters say I'm as real as they come
I'm chasin' that paper baby however it come
I'm singin' a song and movin' yay by the ton
I bet you never seen a nigga gettin' money so young
How I get from the pen', all the way to Berlin
I've been to Switzerland skiing and pimp I'm goin' again
It ain't nothing to catch me in the south of France
In a coffee shop smokin' dro in Amsterdam
And ain't nothin' to fly, all the way to Dubai

I'ma ball like a dog 'til the day that I die

Man you niggas barely pro, I don't even practice no more
Aye shawty I was gettin' dough when you was rappin so-so
When you barely had flow I had crack for the low
You can stunt for the audience and act for the hoes
Let me ask you what you gon' do when we ain't actin' no more
Aye when I finish wit you you ain't even gon' be rappin' no more
Aye ""How he doing?, Where he at?"" somethin' they ain't askin' no more
Aye picture me not bein' the main attraction no more

So tell that lame ass nigga you got places to be
So give me your participation, don't need no hesitation
Don't want to be mistaken, ma I'm plannin' on relations
Yea, you rollin' wit the King and the One

To rap about the shit I did every night
Did you win every fight
You ever went to jail for selling white
May barbick and trap same night
Your know these niggas lame right
I'm speaking on it cause it ain't right
Nigga died I survived I done earned my stripe
Went to jail came home
Twenty times got it right
But still trying keep for shootin' sucker niggas I don't like
'cause the game feel like the real niggas on strike
This sucker get a deal now he living so shy
You niggas outta sight acting hard lying on they record
Know it when you see recognize it don't respect it
Got every right to check 'em when you see 'em in your city
Run up on 'em and try 'em but you see that they some bitches

Don't tell me real recognize real eventually they'll see

Fuck, I just hit a jogger

The kids painted my windows with black, permanent marker
And left the rest of the car color cover like swirl pops
And I got the bass thumpin' but I'm bound to bump into something
Kids are flyin' through the air lookin' like they're crumpin', the way they're tumbling
I gotta do something
But soon as I hit the carwash, to get the tar off
Then it's right back at it tomorrow
They're like dad, this is in, so get with the trend

Make us psychotic
Threat to corporate America, then why they runnin' from me
How could they be so ignorant look at what hip hop den done
Its allowed us to run a business, we should of made it our money
Got us out the ghettos, relocated our mommies
I made it all the way here, ain't no way you takin' it from me
So excuse me Oprah honey I'm sorry really I promise
But niggas bitches and hoes do exist I'm just bein' honest
But why am I bein' punished why is you so astonished

Matter fact I don't even remember falling asleep

Atlantic office claimin' J just keep calling the heat
Is it an emergency or something you need to talk to me?

You make shit way worse then it outta be""

You were workin' on the album, I was listenin' now

Yeah, is it something I don't know that I was supposed to say?
All I know before the hour I awoke today
Nigga commin' wit' the realist and he chose today

I'm real close to J, I seen ups and downs hit
But I ain't never heard him sound the way that he sounded
Really caught a nigga by surprise, I was astounded
He a real cool dude but why he call me clownin'?

You say'n you don't know bout it? Know bout what?
Atlantic records said you called the office and went nuts
Makin' death threats, talkin' loud, gettin' buck

Say you waitin' out your deal till you hear it's up
Planin' to make away with 20 million bucks
You bullshitin' me, right? Is you serious brugh?
Yeah, they said you found out the rapper T.I.P wit' us

I talked to Craig, Jewels and Kais a long time
Long story short they said you don lost ya damn mind
And I runnin' off deep and across ya damn mind
You crossed the thin line, I'm hearin' 'em tell Atlantic

It's so much shit about cha, they don't give a shit about cha
Say'n you ain't doin' nothing they couldn't have done without cha

Tote that tool, make that double
Better be cool you don't want no trouble
Can we lean it to the left, but gas they car
I'm always superclean when you see me on the block
Keep my money and a nine, with a rubber band on it

Look
Bet all you see is tats money grills and chains
But if you scratch the surface you can feel the pain
Names changed but the situation still the same
The bill need payin' n**** simple and plain
Young n**** whos aspiring to get him some change
Won't nobody hire him so he get in the game
Went and bought a 50 slab divided it up with the team
Sold em all double-down did it again
By then you got enough to buy a quarter ounce
You sellin dimes to forty fiends, buy it and bounce
Throw some money to your momma, keep some food in the house
But cop the outfit and Jordans on the day they came out
Better get yourself a pistol, you know them jackers is out
Flip another 7 grams oh you hustlin' now
Time to get yourself a half, make sure it's some glass
A hundred bags, sell it fast, stack o' G's
Now you officially...

[Chorus]

I bet you think you're pretty good at it now huh?

Now once you've flipped a couple o's now the game gets gravy
Take 1250 go get two and a baby
That's 63 grams if you whip that right
You should get back 5 or 6 that night
Stack that money and repeat that twice
Buy you somethin' to ride in, you know it gotta be tight
Next time you buy somethin', take twenty-five hundred
Get 4 and a half it come back in nine dont it?
Now stay low key when the money keep comin'
Keep some n****s on your team, show them suckas they don't want it
By then your connect will clearly see you on the grind
S*** you come and get a nine and he front you what you buyin'
As long as you bring back your money on time
And if you snort blow you do it on your own time
At this rate you'll be at a brick in no time
They say they want some weight tell the n**** stand in line

[Chorus]

Stay with me now shorty, here come the fun part...

Now the robbers plottin on ya, and your name stay buzzin
You caught a sale case down in Macon with your cousin
Your connect ain't worried, you and him cool
You know you'll never tell what you and him do
A mob of a hundred just a few of them true
You heard a worker snitchin' on you, and it's true
Everybody know you sell that s***
The feds come and get ya and they tell you s***
We heard you...

Tote that tool, make that double
Better be cool you don't want no trouble
Can we lean it to the left, but gas they car
I'm always superclean when you see me on the block
Keep the money in a knot with a rubberband on it
Blow that marijuana you know I got it if you want it
You see me standin' on the corner, slangin' that crack
You know how it is to be the man in the trap

Trust me you don't want me up in yo grill
Wit a ski mask on duct taping your kids
You can pray all you want
But I don't forgive
You should have been doin' nothing
But what you do with your dick
I ain't gotta spell it out pimpin you know what it is
The rest gangsta on the real man you know what it is
Plus I got a hundred goons wit me
Dressed in black
Fifty at the front door, fifty at the back
Half got gauges, half got mags
Bring 'em out bring 'em out
Show 'em where they at
We can do them right here
We can catch them in a trap

Run up on this n****
Put a hole in his hat
Put his brains on the dash in the stalks
He has some dumb fifty more with him
Tell them to hold that

Drop to yo knees

Double grip ain't no where to squeeze
I keep a couple lit off for the n***** who talk s***
When I go to Jacob and I cop that brain
If he tried to see me
I'm a cop that thing
And I'm pop that thing
And the shots gonna stay
The n**** bout to set the trunk wit me
For the most part n**** your stuck with me
I'd tell you something if you was really smart
And you knew better
People probably tell ya
Don't f*** with me

Even if I got a ratchet
Aah Pop off police pull me over
Believe I got a compartment
And now gotta stash it
Must I just remind ya n*****

Know that I am a fine ya n*****
Take two break through
Bust so many shots
Come now I'll probably blind y'all n*****

Clap up a n**** then I cap up a n****
When I finish this s*** we'll turn it into an obsearch yo
Look, Listen, then you better observe yo,
Listen to the sizzle from the bullet that the glock burst fro (sss)
Should a probably tweaked you up just a little
And had your body leanin, lookin' like a quarter past four
Stay down better, (stay down) checkin' for a n**** who can put yo body in the dirt (ooh)

[Chorus]",Hurt,2007
T.I.,"You gotta get your swagger together, nigga, get your suitcase
Starts on the inside, ya dig, I don't need mine, I got cribs where we goin?
If you don't love yourself you can't love nobody
Keep up, nigga, I love myself, you gon' need to travel, ladies
You go and get that Mack diesel, right

I'm the man from Atlanta to way out in Cali
Catch me in New York, I'm on the way to Miami
I be in Hawaii then catch me in Paris
I be at home barely, I'll sleep when I'm buried

What I need some sleep for? This dope got me geeked up
I went to Japan and made a mil' in a week, bro
These niggaz can't keep up when they see me in London
So I go out in Ibiza, that time I ain't sleep for

?Bout three days, maybe you'll see me in Haiti
With Wyclef Jean and a selection of ladies
But my folk got that workin? like they back in the eighties
See the money's what move me, conversation don't phase me

Tell 'em why ?cause I been around the world
Traveled the seven seas and I be
Poppin? bottles with celebrities so you can find me
Flyin? high, smokin? better trees

Girls around the world
They keep callin? me, they call me
Paparazzi, they be follow me, they all be
Hopin? that they get a shot of me

It's my swag, they wonder what's so special 'bout him?
Why they ain't sellin? records like him? Tell 'em
It's my swag, how he always look so cool?
And why everybody do what he do, so

Gotta be my swag, they wonder why he wear his hat like that?
When girls see him why they act like that? Aye, I don't know
It's my swag, for some reason all the real niggaz love him
Even though their girlfriend wanna fuck him
I guess, gotta be my swag

Gettin? money in Frisco, wearin? my raincoat
See I'm gettin? wet and this bitch in the same boat
I came in the game slow, they act like they ain't know
That I wasn't gon' leave until I got what I came fo'

I still can't complain? though as long as I ain't broke
I came a long way but, shawty, ain't nothin? changed though
I still let the tool go, don't get it confused, bro
Run up on me wrong, now what you think I'ma do, bro?

Send you to your maker then go to Jamaica
Or either to Cabo, I chill at my condo
My swagger is perfect, hatin? on me ain't worth it
Guarantee you, boy, the Earth my turf if that hurts

Tell 'em why ?cause I been around the world
Traveled the seven seas and I be
Poppin? bottles with celebrities so you can find me
Flyin? high, smokin? better trees

Girls around the world
They keep callin? me, they call me

Even though their girlfriend wanna fuck him

Regardless what haters say I'm as real as they come
I'm chasin? that paper, baby, however it come
I'm singin? a song and movin? yay by the ton
You never seen a nigga gettin? money so young

How I get from the pen all the way to Berlin
I've been to Switzerland, skiing and pimpin?, goin? again
It ain't nothin? to catch me in the south of France
In a coffee shop smokin? dro in Amsterdam

It ain't nothin? to fly all the way to Dubai
St. Barts, St. Lucia, any day we can try
G-5 to Moscow and they say I'ma lie
I'ma ball like a dog 'til the day that I die

Tell 'em why ?cause I been around the world
Traveled the seven seas and I be

This is impeccable pimpin?
You couldn't duplicate this shit if I told you how to, man
Ha, y'all, niggaz, keep up
By the time you get to Puerto Rico, my nigga, I'll be in Cuba

Bet you don't appreciate a n**** my type
But when I die there ain't no more n***** my type
So just remember me right
Bet if I let them suckers kill me tonight
All them haters gon' be filled with delight
God forgive me aight
I sacrifice so they can live my life
If necessary I'll give my life
What you hear is my life
Reputation decorated with stripes
No need crying at the end of my life
Just remember me right

When your back was against the wall remember where could you go
Remember who helped you again like he helped you before
Went out the way to let you know that you ain't never alone
They disrespect you come here until they left you alone
He taught you how to be weak, he taught you how to be strong
Taught you not to accept defeat you go all out or be gone
But it ain't the same in the streets now that he gone
He now in heaven on the throne exactly where he belong
But he left millions devastated and his family mourned
Sons turn to grown man since their daddy been gone
Daughters grew like him or not he left his family home
Even prepared the funeral service he had in the dome
And then they came to represent for a stand up gent
Who walked it like he talked it, always said what he meant
Impossible to stop him had a head like cement
Maybe now you'll appreciate the n**** like this...

[Chorus]

If they only knew the man outside of the hype
No matter what the situation he alway try to do right
Still they gossip and told lies, used to take him for granted
Often found it hard to relate, some how they can't understand it
'Cause that respect he gon' demand it, theres a problem he handle it
Looked adversity in the eye, he never ran from a challenge
They try to knock him off balance when the fed came and got him
Did the time on the edge came home now he ain't stoppin'
Now while them n****s used to hate him, but they girl use to jock him
Swear he had the kinda swagger made the world stop and watch him
Plus he possessed so much hustle, made it impossible to top him
Got better every album, haters hate to see him drop em'
They just talk s*** from a distance, when he around they playin' posse
He use to scare the suckers s***less, probably why them n***** shot him
Hey what it took nothing else than what they could've ever did about him
So go on talk s*** about him
At least you ain't forgot about him...

[Chorus]

Wanna say sorry to my mama
King and lil' mama
See me go through so much drama
You could stand a little thunder
Never let em' see you sweat, stay cool as a cucumber
Stay ready for whatever, make note I'm a do wonder
How he died? On his feet like a man with honor
Showed you the sky was the limit, you can do whatever you wanna
Death above the money, deja need me
Don't worry bout me Uncle Phil the ladies with me
See me with your granddaddy
I know you gon' miss daddy
But life ain't always a dream, and horrible s*** happens
Had I let a n**** kill me before I could quit rapping
And get to spend more time with ya, I know we would a been happy
But I had to take the chances, You would have been trappin'
Long as I could keep that from happening
Ya papi could die happy

See how many folks and polices put you down in the club
If we got to come with a slug why we come to the club
How much more of this s*** you think we can put under the rug
Look we already told them I Told You So,
But all these n***** speaking out whoever spoke before
Don't take it personal people want to be close to folk
What you think the television and the posters for?
(I'm claustrophobic though)
Well then you need to see a doctor for it
Man I ain't joking you close T.I.P. and bout to blow it
Did you forget about them nights in the cells was you honesty
When we was having talks with God and you promise
If he could make away for you to be large and you done it
Out the gate Urban Legend went on to do numbers
Sold a mill made ATL king first week
Five hundred with the Grammy (but not the one that I wanted)
What about them eight figure deals and that other new money
But ask yourself something where the
Gun you got from me?
Keep it real...

You need to think of someone other than yourself some time, did you keep your promise
Keep it real

Aye, shawty, I was gettin' dough when you was rappin? so, so

You can stunt for the audience and act for the hoes
Let me ask you what you gon' do when we ain't actin' no more?
Aye, when I finish with you, you ain't even gon' be rappin' no more
Aye, ""How he doin'? Where he at?"", somethin' they ain't askin' no more

Aye, picture me not bein' the main? attraction no more
That's all the talkin' I care to do to you back to the hoes
Baby, drop it, back it up ?til you can't back it no more

You don't want to get to school and take your ass to detention
Stick my key in your ignition, I'm crankin' up your engine

Got an ill technique in makin' ya knees weak
A non-stop treat until your g-spot leak
To your G4 seat, we'll be back next week
So tell that lame ass nigga, you got places to be

So give me your participation, don't need no hesitation
Don't want to be mistaken, ma, I'm plannin' on relations
Yeah, you rollin' with the King and the One
Country niggas in the chevy passin' Grey Poupon

Man, we been gettin' dough since we was way too young
The record sales, was the mob that'll make me a don
You see this is why I'm hot, and this is why he not
So, mama, climb on top and show me what you got, aye

And left the rest of the car color cover like swirl pops
And I got the bass thumpin' but I'm bound to bump into something
Kids are flyin' through the air lookin' like they're crumpin', the way they're tumbling
I gotta do something

Then it's right back at it tomorrow
They're like dad, this is in, so get with the trend

Tomorrow?ll be a better day

When ya rent a day late and ya tryna stay straight
But the only way to get it is to slang that weight
Okay, tomorrow?ll be a better day

We all Came in the world with a sparkle in our eye
Not knowing the only thing that we can promise is to die
A promise is a lot can?t nobody guarantee it
And death around the corner can?t nobody damn see it
I can?t agree that God good at all time
But we all know shit ain't all good at all time
So I tote my strap in the hood and all time
But respect ain't just something that?s understood in our time
Especially by our kind man I hate it for the future
Police don?t wanna lock ya up no more they wanna shoot ya
And that's half as bad as these hatas?ll do ya
As soon as ya get ya loot up they wanna shoot up
Lord forbid to kill me I bet ya nobody knew what
Suckas get shot and police come straight to us
And that jus how they do us ever since niggas blew up
I know ya goin through it know I?m goin through it too bruh

When ya rent a day late and ya tryna stay straight
But the only way to get it is to slang that weight

When ya daughter like 6 and her pops ain't shit
You ain't wanna tell her you and momma gotta go strip
Okay, tomorrow?ll be a better day

I was just like ya?ll don?t feel so bad
Know it?s hard when ya live so bad
They whoop ya ass and they wonder why ya still so bad
For long, ya get whoopin?s and just laugh
Momma washin? clothes and find a lil? blue bag
She ask what ya what ya doin ya tell her stuntin? like my daddy
You knew that I was gonna be a hustla when ya had me
Look around ma you sent me to the store to get some bread
And I?m passin? atleast 8 J?s or mo?
Rent been late for 8 days or mo?
But slangin? blow a better habit than 8 days of snow

Ya out speedin' wit the white and ya see the blue lights
And ya on ya 3rd strike so the judge say life
Okay, tomorrow?ll be a better day

If ya son 14 and his dad a folk criminal
Hard to realize it Baby girl but god with ya
Okay, tomorrow?ll be a better day

My momma girl son 14 just got killed
Had to catch myself
Bout to tell her I know how ya feel
I?d a been a damn liar
See her tryin not to cry
She know he in a better place
But she just wanna know why
Know somebody touch mine
And a nigga gon? die
It?s goin down
How dare I tell her to calm down
I tried to convince her that he in God?s arms now
She said I don?t believe that there's a God right now
I know its hard right now and ya heart light now
But God give new begginins you can start right now
Know ya scarred right now 'cause you apart right now
But Shit you in better shape than we are right now

Went from seeing how many bitches I can fit in the truck
To 3 hots and a cot is you kidding or what fuck how
Many millions I got nigga so what if I'm hot when I got prices on my head
Feds rushing my spot a million
Haters won't me dead force to carry me gat
But you a seven time felon what you doing with that
It's a catch
22 either you lose or lose
That's the way the game structured for real niggas to suffer
And I ain't never
Been a busta alway stood on my feet
Like a man prepared to take what ever coming for me
A pussy nigga
Or polices wit a warrant for me
I'm a ""G"" prepared to die for what's important to me
Look anybody in the
Eye who say they want it wit me
Put up the house and bet the odds if coming from me
OG's say I need to
Learn and be patient
You telling me wit these seven years of probation
Pistol charges and a host of
Other open cases
If niggas only knew the kind of time I was facing
I tried to keep to myself but
Sometime I couldn't take it
Got 4 kids wit smiles on they faces
Mean more to me than my crown and my bracelet
Take that away from me and my life is butt naked

I?m two-faced a 'cause a jack boy showed me the game
It?s four four that?s a pretty ass key
That?s the sound, we call that there a free throw
Pop you know the numbers equivalent to last week
Buyin whole sale, break it down and put it on the street
My big brother shake ice all night
A sore loser when we do, he be ready to fight
I could tell ya bout the life of a real nigga
He keep it happenin, when hatas come, he deal wid em
That?s all it take?ain?t that a bitch

I guess that's what he hating for, boy you so damn lame (sucka' nigga)
Ya click the same a dusted bunch a walking shit stain
Disgrace the A you give the city such a bad name
You way back in my rear view mirror, I'm in the fast lane
Still I hear ya loud and clear on ya lil' song
Go on get ya dissing on while the King gone
Ya self esteem gone, cause I'm back now
Lets see if we can't teach these niggas how to act now
Ya kissing ass then

And I deliver front and center never back down
Who get the last laugh now sucker nigga?

Center Hill Cedar Ave. that's where I be sucker
South Grand church street the first with the work
But we could get into commercial if ya need somethin' chirp me
Hey what I care about who you asking saying they ain't heard of me
I'm certified certainly them videos ain't hurtin' me
I still ride with the window rolled down 
All around the A town like it's finna' go down
If it was every any questions niggas finna' know now
Won't retire my thrown or surrender no crown
I never bow down, and never say doubt
To whom it may concern and whom so ever may try
I'm forever west side and the featherweight dies
Tell 'em take ya best shot goin' get yourself hot
Cause I yelled ""Bankhead"" and you felt left out
I ain't mention yo name that's what all this bout

[Chorus]

From Summerhill to the hills up in Hollywood
A house full getting to it you know how we do it
Where we smoke great, and we drink good
Then we ball hard, just like G's should
Buy what we want, drive what we want
G4 up, up and away we go we fly where we want
Haters smile like they like it when they really don't
Wish they could just wish me away that's what they really want.
""I really hate his ass (I hate 'em) I don't like him neither (me neither)""
""We'll do a song together maybe then we could beat him""
""Somehow he must be stopped, something must be done""
""If we can't knock him off lets just try him when he get caught with guns""
""Then he'll be really done, and we really won""
""Any more ideas? (I got some) Suggestions anyone?""
""How about we stay up all night? (I like that) On the blog site""
""Spread vicious lies and nasty rumors we could all write""
But that's all right
Let the nerds hate
Cause in my face though, the words get ate
And hatin's hard work
When I just bounce back
This god's work tell all the haters I'm back

Must agree that shit idea,
Can't no one undo,

I'm exceeding expectations, you barely meeting quota
I give it to 'em straight, you cut it with baking soda

Sorry bruh, been a dick that been balling since it started up
Season hoe, get 'em all to fuck cause they know this dough stack tall as fuck
Nah, it ain't that I'm rich that they hate so much
Least I could do it, not rub it in niggas face so much
So I'm trying now while I'm rhyming not to brag about the island
Or the crib in Hawaii where all the walls slide in
House is wide open, we could bring the outside in
I think you should hear about it, but fuck it I'll be quiet
I just spit it how I live it homie I don't be lyin'
Would it make you feel better if I put my pockets on the die?
If I made less money, started to dress bummy
Would the haters and the critics have more respect for me?
Should I downgrade the crib and the way I live?
Naw how about I don't and we just say I did, nigga

Hella rich never have to sell a brick again
Must I tell a bitch again
The bullshit I'm addressing check I'm on some next level shit
Never been fucked in the game I'm celibate
Rarely out my element, barely out the ghetto with
One foot out and foot in intelligent as fellas get
Listen let's settle this, be clear I could fall back seven years
And still ain't no one ahead of me

Consider it a blessin' if you get to stand next to me
Five star general O.G. veteran
Caked like Edimen blowing that celery
Stack that cash like the U.S. treasury
Every single thing I ever did was done heavily
Rap until your seventy still ain't catching me
Put it on my pops, big Phil and Beverly
Be standing on the top still after they bury me
Nose in the air so stuck up arrogant
Ain't got long hot songs best cherish it
Whoever drop mine that's over phenito
You paying for your foul like a free throw (bow)
Now how could a nigga think that he could see me
Other than the magazine covers or the t.v.
You know I sold more mixtapes than your CD
You're waiting on your big break praying you can beat me
You ain't made it far as D-C on the low
I been all around the globe like a god how they treat me
Broads hit they knees eyes closed when they greet me
Mouth wide open just begging me to skeet skeet
You in a deep sleep stop dreaming
I'm six albums in for 10 years I been firin' hot semen
The limelight's mine I'm gleaming beaming
That's why I say I'm King bitch I got my reasons

Wrist so frosty, neck so chilly
All on my mind is to get more millies
Niggas talk shit that's silly
Shawty he ain't about that really, is he
Nigga I'm illy

Hey I run this city clearly
Tell 'em get lost I'm busy really
Nigga I'm illy

Where niggas get off piss off
Me and mine ah to take time to pop a lid off
Shit all over the way bouncing me is y'all
Seeing you fucking mind you figuring I would fizz off
Never cooled off tip scorching
Minimal injury though they missing me maximum misfortune
Number one hands down flow paints portraits
Everybody think you stink like horse shit
House full of chicks on some girl next door shit
A king of one self 30 mill out the store quick
Of course this case lost all my endorsements
Tripled up on real estate still buying more shit
Tip bankrupt according to your sources
I'm still caked up along with more reinforcements
Tore shit up from the ladder to the rooftops
Officially the hottest nigga rapping since Tupac
Before you rap bout me best ask bout me
I'm out my fucking mind need counseling
Please don't doubt me trust me drama ain't nothing
It's all fun and games till somebody start busting
Remember my discussion when rappers be battling
I find out about it better get to skedaddling
Pack your family's bags move 'em out to Seattle an'
You ever crawl back you'll need ambulance and bandages
Live life glamorous so extravagant
Mandarin oriental worldwide traveling
Hip hop champion for real though
You couldn't fuck with me with a Brazil hoe nigga
But still though

Wrist so frosty, neck so chilly
All on my mind is to get more millies
Niggas talk shit that's silly
Shawty he ain't about that really, is he
Nigga I'm illy
Jus' remember I do this shit when I want to nigga
Its me nigga

I run this city clearly
Tell 'em get lost I'm busy really
Nigga I'm illy

Wrist so frosty, neck so chilly
All on my mind is to get more millies
Niggas talk shit that's silly
Shawty he ain't about that really, is he
Nigga I'm illy

I don't wanna hear shit bout I cant rap like this one
Hen I ain't good as that one
Fuck you partna!

I run this city clearly
Tell 'em get lost I'm busy really

Drama
Ursher baby

Hey, hey (yeah man)
Hey what's happening everybody
I hope they get my good side
You know I gotta look good when I walk out the house
You know I know the camera's following (me to)
I know they taking pictures, right Drama
Hey man, you watch it I live it, you dig that
Y'all sit back relax get some popcorn man
I'm gonna make it a good show, you dig that
(Are you not entertained?)
This going make a hell of a movie huh

[Chorus]
My life, your entertainment
You watch it while I live it (live it)
I walk they follow (ay)
I talk they holler (ay)
Just here for your amusement
My life, your entertainment
You watch it while I live it (live it)
You waiting for me to lose it
I guess I'm just here for your amusement

Ay
The price of fame I think I paid, want my change I done gave
Everything in my possession for my seconds on the stage
For my name up in lights and multi-million record sales
I done gave up my life, can't get a moment to myself
When alone I ask myself, is it worth it? I ain't perfect
Neither is anybody else, but I think my kids deserve
To be with Daddy out in public without all the interruptions
When the lies and gossip's published I'm the topic of discussion
And I stay in trouble just to show these suckers I ain't lost it
And I'd do it all again that's the funny thing about it
I ain't playing, boy I'm 'bout it
Will I change, boy I doubt it
I done been a lot of things, I ain't never been a coward
See the paparazzi crowded all around me now
Same niggas who was dissing want a pound like I'm senile (fuck nigga)
Showered with support from my adoring fans
They hear T.I.'s arrested they're like here we go again

My life, your entertainment
You watch it while I live it (live it)
I walk they follow (ay)
I talk they holler (ay)
Just here for your amusement (my life)

You watch it while I live it (live it) (whoa)
You waiting for me to lose it (whoa)
I guess I'm just here for your amusement (yeah)

You've seen it all before, guys know how the story goes
It's like 2Pac never died, sit back, enjoy the show
You see the shit that scares you senseless, I done lived through it
Knew the risks and the consequences and I still do it
And then I'm so fresh, them niggas mildew it
Not just a actor by profession, pimp, I live movies
That's why they whisper when they see me point and stare at me
Cause they just wanna live through me vicariously (vicariously)
Fashion weekend, Paris week, party like a rock star
Get blown by a top model till she catch lockjaw
Got the dough you get a year, stashed in my sock drawer
Showed you the troubles and the struggles of an outlaw
Top dog would not fall, I am not y'all (niggas)
Couple pages out the calendar and I'm out y'all
Kid listen, pay attention, you don't wanna be me
It's safer to watch it on T.V.

My life, your entertainment (entertainment)
You watch it while I live it (live it)
I walk they follow (ay)
I talk they holler (ay)
Just here for your amusement

You waiting for me to lose it (lose it)
I guess I'm just here for your amusement (yeah)

See I don't think it would even matter (to me)
Working a nine to (five) would it be better
I mean be honest, would you care to gossip about me ('bout me)
Not likely
I guess that's just the way that it goes (the way that it goes)
('Cause I know) See I can be somewhere out keeping it cool
(And get told) Almost anything instead of the truth
Y'all know more than I do, it's breaking news to me too
Easy killer y'all know that ain't how I move (ooh)
He said and she said (what) I did what, with they (who)
No not me I said (not me) she gave me no head (ooh)
Won't get me again (hey) I pleaded the fifth (hey)
I know better than to ever talk during the film
Man them flashing lights can blind your eyesight
To when you can't see what's wrong from right
Well shorty 'til you walk a mile in my shoes
And understand this is who I am

Usher I completely concur
Life would be such a blur, obviously we prefer
Our privacy but instead we endure
Yes sir, don't expect nothing less of me
Cause this going probably be this way until the death of me
But for the hustle and the lady on my arm now
Plus all my kids and my mom's I'm a calm down
And yo, we doing just fine, and the time's just flying
Live one headline at a time
Ya dig

The wait is over homie
Yes it is
A town connect

Damn right
Say Toob I know you see me

What up boy
I know both our pops
Lookin' at us

I used to dream (I used to dream) oh whoa
About the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)
But now I see (now I see) oh whoa
Because I'm sitting on top of the world (the whole world)
And now I see (hey) see (hey) see (hey) see
Cause I'm sitting on top of the world
And now I see (hey) see (hey) see (hey) see
Sitting on top of the world

Man I remember before I say that wait let me issue this statement
No way should reflection be mistaking for glorification
Now I remember so vivid me and my niggas was living
Sub-standard condition still handling business
Still laughing and tripping still having the bitches
I'm rapping now reminiscing and goddamn it we made it
From trapping standing and pitching with rich we stand in the kitchen
Splitting it eight ways flip it in eight days
Thought that while in a room it was just the way to behave
Kept the weight and the yey for most the paper we made in all dimes
I ain't lying the pleasure was all mine
Have big work to move but we served the small time
I always out shined the niggas with small minds
Who would of thought we would be arguably the greatest of all time
'Round here we developed such a sound down here
But duplicate it off the steel it can only be found here
Only listen to gs that other shit I don't hear
Shit they so far in the rear how would I even care
I'm too busy being a player staring at niggas careers
Been talk about it for years and now we finally here

They say what goes up must come down
But I ain't reached my cruisee altitude
Take a look at what I did but can you imagine what I'm about to do
The places I'm bout to go and the money I'm bout to see
Gave Bill Gates some binoculars and said look out for me
And see these expectations even at def jam
Cause I married the streets and Atlanta has been my best man
My momma quit her job and now she works with six figures
Cause I'm a self-made nappy-headed rich nigga
Private planes help me travel in peace
To four cities in one day and four countries in one week
Cause I work for myself and no one else cause I'm too smart too
Put one of my partners right through culinary art school
Now he my personal chef so that bread he get it
Put them all in houses cleaned up all of my friends credit
And now they witness all the glitz and the glamor
Catch us eating at straits Atlanta with women with table manners
Order in seeapore and lobster
Celebrating coming from nothing to winning Grammy's and rappers winning Oscars
And they say rappers shouldn't act nah suckers
We see Samuel Jackson like whats up motherfucker!

I used to dream (I used to dream) oh whoa
About the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)

Cause I'm standing on top looking down at it all
I see you down there to y'all this ain't like I got it all
Homie I ain't get enough I'm still trying to triple up
So all we got is street cred and a cool building up
Say I'm doing too much shit I say I ain't did enough
Remember saying damn if I could just get to a million plus
And now I'm like shit what the fuck is a million bucks
Triple that on my bun thanks to bigs and run
But never mind what I've been through just look at what I become
All the shit I've avoided what I done for my sons
And daughters and momma just call her
I sold dope and dropped out of school seems its all they can see
They don't notice none of my family did that since me
I broke that cycle now my family live a life of
Mandatory minimals but not when the judge sentence them
Cousins in college where you think they get tuition from (answer that)
Jeffrey standing around wishing huh
And while you standing around looking dumb
I make it happen taking action over time goddamn good at it

Hey,
I been watching you a while now
And I just wanna find a way to make you smile now
Why you blushing, forget about them other guys now
I know you ain't trying to tell me that you shy now
I realize that you're beauty could intimidate
Them suckers you ain't got no business for them anyway
With such a, pretty face big booty, little waistline,
I wanna grind from behind to the bass line.
Have a great time, pull yourself a shot girl
Chase it with the lime, now you feeling like a hot girl
I know you're probably used to deal with them wannabe's
But honestly I gotta say, I'm who they wanna be.
I promise all I wanna see is you up under me
Now we can disappear whenever, when you wanna leave?
I could guarantee the ride of your life
Any fantasies on your mind, we can try them tonight

It's the end of the night, and I'm thinking you might
Wanna leave the bar, park the car, turn into porn stars

Yes, I'd love to hear about your interests
I gotta say, your intellect got me impressed
See you're panties through your dress like a silhouette(look at that)
Patron got me thinking sex, did you feeling that
All due respect though, a simple yes no
Hey let yourself let go, shorty let's go (let's go)
Pull you to the crib, get you to the threshold
Kiss you from your pretty lips till you red toes
Time ticking it's the end of the night
Hey you could leave with your friend if you like
But I'm saying no (I'm saying no)
Hey we could ride out
Back to my house
I wanna see you satisfied inside out
Once I'm in you ain't goin' want me to slide out
You tell your girlfriends they goin' wanna try it out
A lil' more let's loosen you up
What we can't do in the club we can do in the truck (lets go)

[Chorus]

Hey would you, stay
Could you, play with it, with your tongue just a, little
You such a sexy individual physical and mental
And if it's sentimental shouldn't rules bend a little
Hey let me start at the top stop in the middle use a Popsicle
Make you shiver giggle when it tickle
I could talk to you dirty if you'd like that (bad girl)
I finish once, hit a blunt, start right back
I know you told me you a good girl
But shorty you's grown woman not a little girl
You could blame it on the patron or the champagne
But sometimes being bad could be a good thing

Like these niggas talk to much (yeah)
I'm ready for whatever somebody better tell them (yeah boy)
Said I'm ready for whatever
Hey, hey, hey

Even tho my head in the clouds I'm planted on the pavement
How I walk around people starring in amazement
I play a lot of game a well-being I ain't playing wit
They so judgmental man but they don't understand
If ya life was in jeopardy everyday is you telling me
You wouldn't need weaponry just because of ya felony's
Consider this at least I got everybody sweating me
On the streets there's people who wont rest unless I rest in peace
Killed my folk a year ago still in my sleep they threatening me
Paranoid you stressing me ain't nobody protecting me
I'm dealing wit the pressure from my partner dieing next to me
Niggas know I was arrested they coming for me eventually
This was all the things that I was going through mentally
This could be the reason I ignore the penitentiary
Not mentioning New Orleans niggas coming in the city
Killing all summer long ain't nobody pay attention

Now is it that hard to understand if you listen
Either die or go to jail that's a hell of decision
But I'm wrong and I know it my excuses unimportant
I'm just trying to let you know that I ain't think I had a choice, for real

I had straps in my ride gotta go to prison
You waiting on me to die you gone be waiting for a minute
Boy i'm ready for whatever somebody better tell them
I'll be here when the smoke clear and everything settle (for real)
Cant afford the price of fame cause it cost too much
Man these sucker niggas lame and they talk to much
That's why I'm ready for whatever somebody tell them
I'll be here when the smoke clear and everything settle

For real, hey for real, hey for real, hey for real I said when everything settle for real

I'm a man I ain't perfect I admit it I'm guilty
But understand feel me I was riding filthy
Cause niggas out there plotting to rob me and kill me
five hundred thousand every year spent on security
My future was bright but now its getting blurry
Cause niggas in a hurry to find me and bury me
But surely God'll deliver me up out it
I'm a fighter till the heart I'll forever be about it
I'm a father to my sons as it to my community
Look all that I done my good out weigh the negativity
Hey mentally I was focused on that letting history repeat itself
That's why heat was kept in a vicinity
Yes officially I broke the law but not maliciously
Through all the publicity was anyone considerin'
My position and the logic hidden my decision
But they caught me with them now I'm off to prison, period

But is it that hard to understand if you listen
Either die or go to jail that's a hell of decision
But I'm wrong and I know it my excuses unimportant
I'm just trying to let you know that I ain't think I had a choice, for real


Hey I said listen homeboy
You can talk all you want man you know what I'm saying
Everybody talking to the king you know what I'm saying
They like Escalades everybody got one
But the fact of the matter remain
If you ain't walk a mile in my shoes and you ain't live a day in my life
You ain't survive the shit I done survived
You ain't had to deal wit the shit I had to deal wit homeboy
You cant motherfucking judge me partner
I mean look at folk like Sean Taylor
You know what they said, they said had he had a strap
He'd f lived today
You know what I'm saying
Now true enough I did wrong I broke the law
I deserve to be punished I understand that alright cool
But listen man I gotta house full of kids
A mama and an old lady whose life is my
Responsibility you dig that?
Now for all of y'all who think I was just riding around on some dumb shit
You know I'm smarter than you man
You know I'm smarter than you dog
Hey if you think I was just being stupid
Shorty I got some motherfucking ocean front property in Idaho for sale homie
If you believe that I gotta bridge in Brooklyn I wanna sell you partner

Hey , when I think about all my time and all my struggle
Through all my grinding and all my troubles
Man I came out from nothing , all I had was a hustle
With a blindfold trying to find pieces to the puzzle, no muzzle
I tell it like it is, that's that, right or wrong, I'm a call it how I see it
Don't forget that impossible is nothing, you're environment is irrelevant
Just don't let your emotions over power your intelligent
Refuse to give up, your mistakes will define you
Down dictate where you heading, then remind you
That time keeps ticking, let your mind keep clicking
Never stop thinking, be aware of your decision
Be aware of the collisions
And the potholes hidin' in the road that you travel on your lifelong mission
Just listen everyday like a snap shot is taken, 
If you live you could learn to just be patient

And all the places I go
And all the things that I know
Through all the highs and lows 
Cause life is like a slide show
And all the things that I've seen
And all the things that I've dreamed
You cant take away from me
Cause life is like a slide show

As I look back at a fly young cat
Who could rap with a dream, look where I took that
Beginnin' on Bankhead, then I spread out
Vision in my head, all I had to do is to get it out
When I walked out of my house, and look at my street
All I see is the opportunity that lead me to truancy
I ain't really have a roll model to influence me
Uncle Joink, said next year it's just gonna be you in it
As a juvenile caught cases so fluently 
Look at my life and learn from it, don't do it
If I only knew back then what I know now, 
How much better life it would have been if I slowed down
Maybe I have been Kanye, instead of seeing gun play
But god got a plan, I'll understand one day,
But one day of life like a snap shot is taken,
If you live you could learn to just be patient

Looking back on my life time
See the slides go by
Time to wonder why
Looking back on where I've been
I remember when
You remember

T.I.,"Hey, say pimp, 
This to everybody stretched out behind the wall,
Countin' days on their calendar,
Flippin' pages, month to month
Hey man, I don't give a damn bout how other folks
Treat you man
I just wanna let you know pimp,
You ain't missin' nothin' homeboy
Real Talk

I know the times seem long,
Just try and keep strong
Put on your headphones and rewind this song
Remember you ain't missin' nothin' holmes,
I promise you ain't missin' nothin' holmes

Hey, just now the club on hold and the broads on pause
You get home, it's gonna be waitin' on y'all
So dog, just know, for real
You ain't missing nothing holmes
I promise you ain't missin' nothin' homes
On everything

My uncle did a decade,
Came home, hit the ground runnin' gettin' paid like he
Never did a day
Hit the streets, nigga still in the same place they were
Before we went in the chain gang,
And doin' the same thing
Cause the game go on, you only did two days in the joint
The day you get locked up and the day you go home
I know it feels like the world passin' you by,
Like shit happenin' everyday out there that you don't know 'bout
Every time you call home your baby momma show out,
And your partners don't even send you flicks from when
They go out
But don't worry 'bout it or stress it, cause shawty know what?
The time'll do itself, all you gotta do is show up
Keep layin' down wakin' up,
And thankin' the Lord
And 'fore you know it they gonna open the doors
True story, just prepare yourself for it,
If you ain't got a plan what you need was a second chance,
Shit, you gonna blow it!
Learn and visualize what you try to do,
And do the time homeboy, don't let the time do you
They say the time just flew on the street,
Hard to believe from me never but you'll see soon as you
On the streets

[Chorus]

Hey, just now the club on hold and the broads on pause
You get home, it's gonna be waitin' on y'all
So dog, just know, for real
You ain't missin nothin homes
I promise you ain't missin' nothin' homes

Probably thinkin' it's easy for me to say from here in the booth,
But they showed ya, they'd put me in there with you
Right now, locked down in the state of the fed, lay in the bed
Playin' it's over and over as you say in your head
Yeah, next time I'm a be straight
Just count down to my release date, peace of cake
My nigga Kap right now, servin' a life sentence for a murder he committed,
In self defense and in such good spirits, shorty ain't even tripping
And I could be right in there with him, no bull shittin'
He on his ninth year now, just waitin' to get out
Got me thinkin' my shit ain't even worth complainin' about
Cause it could still be worse for sho'
So you waitin' on me to lose hope, you got to kill me first
I talked to my nigga Big Meedge, had to tell him the
Streets miss him just as much as he miss the streets
Had to let him know whenever he released,
We hittin' the club like O three, this time it's on me
Yeah we laugh, reminisce for a minute and then I tell
Him just nobody ever did it as big
It'll never be the same in this city again, closest
You'll get is me and Jeezy and them
So dog, if it seems like you left behind, ten steps
Behind, just know it only gets better with time

Hey, just now the club on hold and the broads on pause

Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo,
I say still I stand
Hey shorty here I am

Never have ya seen in ya lifetime
A more divine southern rapper wit a swag like mine
Facing all kind of time
But smile like I'm fine
Brag with such passion and shine without trying
Believe me pain's a small thing to a giant
I was born without a dime
Out the gutter I climbed
Spoke my mind
And didn't stutter one time
Ali say even the greatest gotta suffer some time
So I huff and puff rhymes
Lyrics so sick with it
Set the standard in Atlanta
How to get get get it
So you up and coming rappers wanna dis just kill it
I'm officially the realest
Point blank period
Whether I still live in the hood or just visit
Whatever you can do in the hood I done did it
That why the dope boys and the misfits feel it
This still his city as long as tip living (listen)

I ain't dead (no)
I ain't done (no)
I ain't scared (of what!)
I ain't run (from who!)
But still I stand (yeah)
No matter what VA here I am(Yeah)
No matter what remember
I ain't break (never)
I ain't fold (never)
They hate me more (so!)
Yeah I know
There I go (yeah)
No matter what shorty here I go
No matter what shorty

You let the blog sites and the magazines tell it
I'm sure to be in jail till 2027
Rather see me in a cell in-
Stead of this new McLaren
God'll take you through hell just to get you to heaven
So even know its heavy the load I will carry
Grin and still bear it
Win and still share it
Apologies to the fans I hope you can understand it
Life can change ya directions
Even when you ain't planned it
All you can do is handle it
The worst thing you could do is panic
Use it to your advantage
Avoid insanity manage to conquer
Every obstacle
Make impossible possible
Even when winnings illogical
Losing's still far from optional
Yeah they wanna see you shot up in the hospital
But one life throw punches, block ya counter like a boxer do
Been locked inside my case too long
I did a song to make it known that the king lives on
(Pimping)

I ain't dead (no)
I ain't done (no)
I ain't scared (of what!)
I ain't run (from who!)
But still I stand (yeah)

I ain't fold (never)
They hate me more (so!)
Yeah I know
There I go (yeah)
No matter what shorty here I go
No matter what shorty

Even in solitude
There's still no hotter dude
I show you how to do
What you do
You ain't got a clue
All you do is follow dudes
Sound like a lot of dudes
I weather whatever storm
Make it out without a bruise
I understand why
Now wit my hands tied
They take shots cause if I'm out there it's a land slide
But revenge is best served as a cold dish
And suckers will get served, nigga no shit
Guess it was understood for me it was over with
But I don't quit if ya ain't notice yet
They couldn't wait to say good night shorty
So they can try to rhyme act and look like shorty
Go get a beat from Toomp? and make a hook like shorty
Before ya know it I'm back
What it look like shorty
I lost my partner and my daughter in the same year
Somehow I rise above my problems and remain here
Yeah and I hope the picture painted clear
If ya heart filled with faith then ya cant fear
Wonder how I face years and I'm still chillin'
Easy, let go and let god deal wit it

Never been a pussy so I don't know what they yellin' 
Screamin' fussin' cause he pushin' fo'
I ain't fen to talk let em walk like it's all good
Catch him slippin in the parkin lot and then it's all good
Got a couple blocks and a mask in the glove box
He come out the club and his ass get seen
Now I'm linked out the window with the beam on set
Made up my mind I'm a kill him when I see him no sweat
Make a bet I ain't gon put his monkey ass on a shelf
And I don't need nobody help cause I can do this shit myself
In a triple black Chevy ride low key step
I hope this nigga ready cause he gon see death

Now these niggas better move when the G's comin' through
Never be afraid to shoot when you see them near you

I'm a veteran in the crew livin' legend in the crew
I keep that desert eagle lethal weapon plus two
We goin' beef what it do
And you know that I'm a ride
We can do it right here or we can take it outside
Every day is homicide couple of bodies every night
We got half the population murder rate still rise
Ay bullets still fly write his name on the wall
I ain't even gotta do it I got goons on call
I'm a beast I'm a dog you a bitch you a fraud
I'm a ride I'm a G you a snitch you a fraud
If you want it you can get it hit him all up in his neck
And his head and his chest make sure that nigga wet deck

Most of us don't want it to fade

We want it to braid, meaning we want it to grow
Meaning we want it to stay like the governor called
And they told him to wait, unstrap him from the chair
Put him back in his cage

The audience ain't fazed
They ain't gone clap and they ain't gone praise
They want everything back that they paid

So chauffeur, chauffeur come and take me away
'Cause I been standing in this line for like five whole days
Me and security ain't getting along
And when I got to the front they told me all of the tickets were gone

So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown, M&M's are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture

One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every songs a favorite song and Mikes don't feed back

Consider them my prot??g??, homage I think they should pay.
Instead of being gracious, they violate in a major way.

Some move away to make a way not move away cause they afraid.

Could do without the fame and the rappers nowadays are comedy.
The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguing.
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in.
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'.
The cheques into your bank account and you up out of poverty.
Your values is a disarray, prioritizing horribly.
Unhappy with the riches cause your piss poor morally.
Ignoring all prior advice and fore warning.

What I desire 
I got stripes, Adidas
Mami scream papi no mas!
Run up in your s*** just me no mas
Running this s*** like I got four thighs
None has swagger like this four guys!
When it comes to styles I got several
Sharper than a swagger, dagger all metal
And my jewels, blue and yellow
The type of s*** that make 'em call you Carmelo
Rules as follows stay true to the ghetto
Write your name on the bullet make you feel special, ha
What the f*** you boys talking about?
I know its us cause we the only thing you talk about

No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us

Yea,
Ha!
Ya think?
That's right,
You know see Weezy for the wordplay,
Jeezy for the bird-play,
Kanyeezy for diversity and me for controversy,
All my verses picture perfect all is meant to serve a purpose, 
You ain't living what you kicking then you worthless,
Looking from the surface it may seem that I got reason to be nervous 
Then observe my work and see that my adversity was worth it,
Verses autobiographical, absolutely cla**ical,
Last thing I'm worried 'bout is what another rapper do,
Ain't nobody hot as me 
Even if they rap they a** off 
Blast off and have outstanding quality,
Sell a lot of records I respect and salute that,
But spitting real life on hot beats I'm the truth at
You kick it like me no exaggeration necessary,
Living revolutionary, nothing less than legendary,
Gangsta s*** hereditary, got it from my dad
Flow colder than February with extraordinary swag

No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us

No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us

T.I.,"If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones and they wanna know
Oh, oh, oh

If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on and they want a show
Oh, oh, oh, yeah

Yeah, uh, a fresh cool young Lu
Trying to cash his microphone check 2, 1, 2
Want to believe my own hype but it's too untrue
The world brought me to my knees
What have you brung you?

Did you improve on the design?
Did you do something new?
Well, your name ain't on the guest list
Who brung you?

You, the more famous person you come through
And the sexy lady next to you come to
And then it hit me, standing outside of heaven
Waiting for God to come and get me

I'm too uncouth, unschooled to the rules and two gum shoe
Too much of a newcomer and too uncool
Like Shadow and Lavelle, I battle with it well
Though I need a holiday like lady who song blue
Go back whatever you did you undo
Heavy is heaven, the devil on my two tons too

If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones and they wanna know
Oh, oh, oh, yeah

And you better wear your shades
The spotlights here can burn holes through the stage
Down through the basement
Passed the Indian graves where the dinosaurs laid

And out through China nearly misses air liners
Magnified times five this is pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest a blaze
Now that's important to say, 'cause even with all of that
Most of us don't want it to fade

We want it to braid, meaning we want it to grow
Meaning we want it to stay like the governor called
And they told him to wait, unstrap him from the chair
Put him back in his cage

The audience ain't fazed
They ain't gone clap and they ain't gone praise
They want everything back that they paid
'Cause they been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim

If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear the crowd is here
And the lights are on and they want a show
Oh, oh, oh, yeah

So chauffeur, chauffeur come and take me away
'Cause I been standing in this line for like five whole days
Me and security ain't getting along
And when I got to the front they told me all of the tickets were gone

So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown, M&M's are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture

One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every songs a favorite song and Mikes don't feed back
All the reviewers say you need to go and see that

And everybody claps 'cause everybody is pleased
Then they all take the stage and start performing for me
Like ha, ha, haha, ha
Ha, ha, haha, ha, ha

If you are what you say you are a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones and they wanna know
Oh, oh, oh

If you are what you say you are a superstar
Then have no fear the crowd is here
And the lights are on and they want a show
Oh, oh, oh, yeah

Wonder how I got it so fast, baby you gotta invest

For you can get through security, I'd-done got on a jet
You must be under a rock if you haven't heard of 'em yet

Hey, it's for all my cats man
Have you ever been in a club and have a chick run up on you,
And kinda tell you to buy her a drink, home?
I mean, it ain't what I can do, it what I will do,
And attitude is everything, you know what I'm saying
I mean, a chick who ask for nothing will get everything
A chick who ask for everything will get nothing
Pain, why don't you talk to these motherfucking broke bitches for a minute, would you

[T-Pain]
You may want a man with some consideration (Consideration),
Determination (Determination)
I let conversation (How you Doing Baby?)
And you might want a man who just say straight I'm nasty (Straight I'm nasty)
From Tallahassee (It's a hate 5-0)
You're far to classy (far too classy)
So you might want a man who's got a job (job), car (car), clothes (clothes), jewelry (jewelry)
Girl I just ain't fooling me to you (No), to you (No)
Think that I'm that easy shawty, it can't go that breezy shawty,
Find another dude cause it ain't me

[Chorus: T-Pain]
What you in a rain, buy expensive things
It ain't me, babe, it ain't me, no, it ain't me,
No way, no how, uh uh
It ain't me, babe, it ain't me, no, it ain't me,
I saw all your fingers take you out and make you famous
It ain't me, babe, it ain't me, no, it ain't me,
No way, no how, uh uh
It ain't me, babe, it ain't me, no, it ain't me

[Akon]
I know you thought you had a sugar daddy
Plan to treat me like a her
Take my money cause I'm attractive
Then kick me off to the curve
Climb in fancy restaurants
Eating expensive ourdevours
How I'm gonna let you get it all like that
Without the big lip
Girl that's my word.
And if you wanna ride, then I just can't let it slide
If you plan to get me for all I got, you could start by spending the night.
Otherwise let me see your head get small
Less your head to make the head get tall
If not goin' get lost cause that ain't me
(If not goin' get lost cause that ain't me)

Hey,

Shawty look so good
So she think I should
Throw dough to her, like it ain't nothing to it
Get you whatever you like, I could,
But all I be giving you tonight is just wood
Hood, to my heart I do it
Huge and your attitude just blew it
So rude that your mentality is distorting your reality
Actually the more you speak make me think where I'd rather be
I don't care if you hiding me, cause I won't sponsor shopping sprees
It's lots of freaks that I could be showing my generosity to
Boo, stop it please, I ain't that guy,
You ain't that fly
Got your head up your ass that's why
All you ask for is all I deny
I do for you what I decide
And I can buy all kinds of things
Go places spend all kinds of dough
My kindness is no blindness though

Run into a group of niggas, getting they hate on
You walk by, they get wrong you reply
Then shit get blown
Way outta proportion, way past discussion
Just you against them, pick one then rush 'em
Figure you'll get your head ?
That next, they don't wanna stop
There now they bussin', now you gushin', ambulance
Rushin' you to the hospital, with a bad concussion
Plus ya hit four times, plus it hit ya
Spine paralyzed waist down, now ya wheel chair bound
Never mind that now, you lucky to be alive
Just think it all started you, fussin' with three guys
Now ya pride in the way, but ya pride is the way you
Could fuck around, get shot die any day
Niggas die, every day all over
Bull shit dope money dice, game ordinary hood shit
Could this be, 'cause of hip hop music
Or did the ones, with the good sense
Not use it, usually niggas
Don't know what to do, when their back against the wall
So they just start shootin'
For red or for blue or for blo' I guess
From Bankhead or from your projects
No more stress, now I'm straight
Now I get it now I take time to think
Before I make mistakes, just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday, the heart of me is strong today
No regrets I'm blessed to say, the old me dead and gone away

Ooh, I've been travelin' on this road too long
Just trying to find, my way back home
The old me, is dead and gone, dead and gone
And ooh, I've been travelin' on this road too long
Just trying to find, my way back home
The old me, is dead and gone, dead and gone

I ain't never been scared, I live through tragedy
Situation coulda been dead, lookin' back at it
Most of that shit, didn't even have to happen
But you don't think about it, when you out there trappin'
In apartments hangin', smokin' and rappin'
Niggas start shit didn't, next thing ya know we cappin'
Get locked up, then didn't even get mad
Now think about damn, what a life I had
Most of that shit, look back just laugh
Some shit, still look back just sad
Maybe my homeboy, 'till be around
Had I not, hit the nigga
In the mouth that time, I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my nigga, walkin' out that door
Who'da thought I'd never see, Philant no more
Got enough dead homies, I don't want no more
Cost a nigga his job, cost me more
Ida took that ass-whoopin', now for sure
Now think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripe
A nigga put his hands on me alright
Otherwise stand there, talk shit all night
'Cause I hit you, you sue me
I shoot you, get locked up, who me?
No more stress, now I'm straight
Now I get it now I take
Time to think, before I make mistakes
Just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets I'm blessed to say
The old me dead and gone away

Ooh, I've been travelin' on this road too long
Just trying to find, my way back home
The old me, is dead and gone, dead and gone
And ooh, I've been travelin' on this road too long
Just trying to find, my way back home
The old me, is dead and gone, dead and gone

I turn my head to the east
I don't see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the west
Still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the north
Swallow that pill
That they call pride
The old me is dead and gone
But the new me will be alright
I turn my head to the east
I don't see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the west
Still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the north
Swallow that pill

Hey going put that ass on me like a bee sting
Hey let the King on, beat it like a tambourine
And peel ya out ya jeans and eat it like a tangerine

Sexy when I sleep,
No more fantasies I want the real thing.

A more divine southern rapper
Wit a swag like mine
Facin? all kind of time
But smile like I'm fine
Brag with such passion
And shine without trying

Believe me, pain's a small thing to a giant
I was born without a dime
Out tha gutta I climbed
Spoke my mind
And didn't stutter one time
Ali say even the greatest
Gotta suffer some time

So I huff and puff rhymes
Lyrics so sick wit it
Set the standard in Atlanta
How to get get get it
So you up and coming rappers
Wanna dis just kill it
I'm officially the realest
Point blank period

Whether I still live in the hood or juss visit
Whateva you can do in the hood I done did it
That's why the dope boys and the misfits feel it
This still his city as long as Tip living nigga

I'm sure to be in jail till 2027
Rather see me in a cell
Instead of this new McLaren
God'll take you through hell just to get you to heaven

So even though it?s heavy, the load I will carry
Grin and still bear it
Win and still share it
Apologies to the fans, I hope you can understand it
Life can change ya directions
Even when you ain't planned it

All you can do is handle it
The worst thing you could do is panic
Use it to your advantage
Avoid insanity, manage to conquer
Every obstacle, make impossible possible
Even when winning's illogical
Losing's still far from optional

Yeah they wanna see you shot up in the hospital
But when life throw punches, block ya counter like a boxer do
Been locked inside mi casa too long
I did a song to make it known that the king lives on, pimpin?

Even in solitude, there's still no hotter dude
I show you how to do what you do
You ain't got a clue
All you do is follow dudes
Sound like a lot of dudes
I weather whateva storm
Make it out without a bruise

I understand why, now wit my hands tied
Dey take shots cause if I'm out there it?s a landslide
But revenge is best served as a cold dish
And suckas will get served nigga, no shit

Guess it was understood, for me it was over with
But I don't quit if ya ain't notice yet
They couldn't wait to say good night shawty
So they can try to rhyme, act and look like shawty

Go get a beat from Toomp and make a hook like shawty
Before ya know it I'm back, what it look like shawty?
I lost my partna and my daughter in the same year
Somehow I rise above my problems and remain here

Yeah and I hope the picture painted clear
If ya heart filled with faith then ya can't fear
Wonder how I face years and I'm still chillin??
Easy, let go and let God deal wit it

Bentley car cover looking like a laced front wig
Of course they hating cause they still riding the martor train
Re-name the yacht but put the plane in my daughters name
Now that's karma so call me daddy war bucks
If you got money, I got more bucks

New york and jersey come into they hood
Hey I wish a motherfucker would
L.a. and the bay come into they hood
Hey I wish a motherfucker would

[Ludacris]
Luda!
I'm a freak like a scorpio
Custom hood scoops make the coupe look like pinocchio
I'm rich bitch, I should drop cash
The inside of the lac' look like a wood shop class
And these women gimme ""love"" like it's tennis time
So many shoes that my closet look like finish line
So many acres that my crib look like Bermuda
So many diamonds the safe look like Kay jewelers
That spider about to drop my team said Luda get it
Now 50 thou says that I'm the first nigga with it
First round draft pick, later for you imbeciles
The car is all black like it got traded to the timberwolves
And I keep a little bit of that green up in the lining
But as the weather change my weed adjust to different climates (ok)
Green in the summer time, orange in the spring
Now it's black with that purp I call my whip the ""sac king""

[Chorus]

Chi-town and Detroit, come into they hood
Hey I wish a motherfucker would
D.c and b-more, come into they hood
Hey I wish a motherfucker would

[T.I.]
I'm fly enough to fly away
Trouble I don't shy away
From it I annihilate suckers in they driveway
In church on Sunday morning praying about what happened Friday
But them the consequences for coming at pimping sideways
Now a days guess it pays to change
In cahoots with corporations making major change
With magnificent watches and amazing chains
Plush pad in Atlanta and l.a.'s the same
I'm balling til I'm bored with selections and assortments
Of automotives worth a small fortune
Of course it's the '72 Chevelle hardtop, '69 drop
60 carat piece you can barely pay your lease
Dude wanna talk new school tell him go ahead
Drop head double r-Maybachs and corner sales
Swag got the ass, stack cash to the hair line
Fuck another car it's time to try an buy a airline

[Chorus]

Miami to Alabama, come into they hood
Hey I wish a motherfucker would
Philly and Boston, come into they hood
Hey I wish a motherfucker would
St. Louis to Tennessee, come into they hood
Phoenix to v.a, come into they hood
Ohio and Indiana, come into they hood

And these niggas know exactly what I'm riding on

24 inches on the old school
Beat up knocking
These hoes keep jocking
And these tags I'ma pop em
I'm a real show shopper
Sold out shows everywhere I go
Just to hear the young boy from the old ways flow
When it comes to the money imam get that doe
Imam get that doe nigga that's for sure
Can't nobody do it quite like this man
They cool but they ain't like this man
Got ice on my neck and my wrist man

These Nigga can't do it like I
Everyday this nigga stay fly
26 inches be on my ride
Hear my dubs be suicide
Still black card spending

When it comes to the hoes you know I'ma get em
At the mall everyday so you know that I'm fitted
Everything that I done hop in undid it
Tell these men first time I drop
6 years later still on top
Making these hits but it ain't goin' stop
I'ma get this money til my casket drop
And yes, yes my nigga I'ma baller
They had to nickname me Mr tear the mall up
Clip the bar
When I hit that mall
Shut the whole mall down
Buying everything I saw
And these lame niggas hating on me cos they hoes all want me
Hey it ain't my fault
You should having it, check homie
Something like a pimp
Yeah I ball from a sip
So much money in my pocket got me walking with a limp
And you say you got money but I ain't like this
And I'ma keep shining on you haters so sick

Sorry but I had to fold her, like a pornography poster she showed her

You remember them broads on the strip out in Vegas?
(Uh-huh, what about 'em?) Well
I don't know if I told you or not but (hm)
Lil' shawty I was in the back seat with me, you know uh (uh, Naomi)
I ran into her on Rodeo Drive in L.A., and I was like

[Chorus]
(She's so fly) She's outrageous, I met her out in Vegas
She fresh off the pages of a magazine, I said
(She's so fly) She like eye candy, I can't stop starin'
I'm like goddamn, I got to have you girl, because
(She's so, fly)

Look at shorty hoppin' out that Maserati
In them Giuseppe Zanotti's and that bangin' ass body
In them low cut Frankie B.'s with the panties peekin' out 'em
With a booty that big, and her stomach rock solid
On Rodeo Drive, walkin' in her Roberto Cavalli
I should probably walk up to the register and say ""I got it""
Go and pick up what you like, it's nothin' ma, don't worry about it
That bag should be carried by somebody so exotic
And that dress should be worn when there's nothin' else up under
Just in case I run into you I can pull up to your bumper
She politely declined when I offered her my number
Then I asked her what's her name, said she'd rather make me wonder
So I paid and she laughed, carried out her bags outside
And I couldn't get her ass, I tried
As I watch her leave out the store
How one man wanted shorty ass and more, for sure

[Chorus]

Shorty bring the Cialis
See my hand, got the money countin' callus
Couldn't find a bigger star down in Dallas
And the Pistons ain't the only one with rings in (The Palace)
Do your research, tell me your analysis
Take a jet and make you wonder where you land like Alice
Tell me shorty ain't the baddest
Tell me shorty don't deserve to walk the runway in Paris
(Woo!) She deserve it all
I don't do the mall, I do it by catalog
La Perla panties and bras, fuck buyin' at the bar
I fuck around and buy this whole club by tomorrow
See, she's so nice
She can get whatever she likes
Don't let the price make you mad
I live a Fabolous life shorty, (Throw it in the bag)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
(She's so fly)
What? Ha, yeah, yeah
(She's so fly to me)
Look at her
Uh, hoppin 'out that Rover (hey)
In them Louie loafers (hey)
I just wanna hold her (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Closer to me, closer to me)

Aye, we in Vegas on the strip and seein' vision and precision lookin' like a straight star
With the buttons undone, showin' off her lace bra
My partner in the back, 'til the smoke hop in they car
Okay, broad in L.A., she say I got until tomorrow, ha
So, we hopped in the land and we rolled out, yeah
Walked on the end and we showed out, yeah

No bouquet of flowers could ever show how much we know we need you
We do all that's in our power just to please you
See boo, fuck them girls I would leave the world 'fore I leave you
May God say even Eve and Adam ain't have shit on these two

They wonder how we do what we do
Panamera Porsche's me and you
Stuck to your side li, li, like glue
Be by your side boy, whatever your goin' through

We were high (til when its all good)
We were low ((til when its all bad)
But I promise I will never let you go

Said I got I got I got I got your back, boy

Keep it looking hood for ya

Even though them chicks be hatin' on us
Still I'm gonna keep her by my side
In whatever situation we gon' ride
Make all my fantasies come alive
That's no lie now
I'll be alright just as long as you beside me
Ten million dollar mansions won't suffice
If you ain't gon' be in there with me at night
The pieces to my puzzle's in my life
With all of my good days and all of my bad
You stood by your man and you know you got my back
Worth every car every bag with me they wanna be that
I know what I got at home
I ain't never gon' leave that
Them bitches best believe that

We were high (til when its all good)
We were low ((til when its all bad)
But I promise I will never let you go

Ho! It's young 'Face, slanging yay everyday
Heavyweight, got a bad bitch in every state
On the grind non-stop till I touch this cake
Mark ass niggas stay the fuck up out my way
I'm a true O.G., you can quote what I say
I'm an H-town nigga from around the way
Southside, ridin' Dirty like I'm UGK
Asshole by nature like my name was Trae
And I don't gang-bang, I patrol the game
And what I'm representing here is putting holes in brains
Before I say the same thing I'll be old and grey
'Fore I fall off and rap about my clothes and chains
Gripping grain and popping trunks, dog but that ain't me
These elbows hit the scene back in eighty-three
I stay street, when it's done, that's that
You could find me in your hood pumping monster crack
I roll over rodents in Rovers with rims on 'em
Sniffing out a rat I expose him and then dome him
A lot of niggas bitches, they claim that they OGs
A straight up pussy and claims that he knows me
You see I, putting out these DVDs
Now my shit done hit the streets, he gots to squat the pee
Got the Feds on his team so they watching me
Mousetrap for a rat, pussy watch and see

[Hook: Scarface (UTP)]
I've been straight... (For a long time)
Getting cake... (For a long time)
E&J... (For a long time)
Nigga... (Try to get like this!)
I've been a G... (For a long time)
In the street... (For a long time)
Toting heat... (For a long time)

I got big dogg status [x8]

[Scarface]
I came here to exercise my game
Spread love to the hood is how I do my thang
Smoking weed with my homies, barbecue them wangs
Sip Hennesey and coke cause I don't fuck with drank
Don't pop pills either cause that shit ain't cool
We just drunk a mad Dom 'fore we went to school
Flick off, back then I was smashing boys
Jump wrong, you saw a nigga get his ass destroyed
Same rules right now, I demand respect
And if I slapped one hoe, then her man was next
I'm a kick door robber, a hot-shot driver
A crack rock slanging motherfucker for a dollar
If you dare to be laid, then off in the Lincoln
But if it ain't no way, then believe I'm finna' take it
Cause a nigga with no hustle, it ain't worth this G
And a bitch like this is even worse than that
I've been good at bullshitting but this game can cost
And if a nigga can't maintain, mayne he lost
He a nerd, and they fuck nerds in jail I heard
And as a nigga, I come in here with my balls and my word

Now the subject of this story 
Is about the boys
Runnin' around talkin 'bout how they ride this cars
I was sittin' in the Benz at the age of 19
When I was 21 I had a yellow ferrari
22 I was Porschin' with the top let aback
23 with the Rolls with the pipe to match
24 wasn't trippin' on what I came up in 
I was focusin' how to be like j's back then
Money power and respect was the life I choose
Being famous wasn't nothin' I just like my doe
I was livin' in the fast lane mayne fo' sho'
Sure tip but quick up and let this thang unload
So if I had a problem with you, you the blame you know
Send a message and then this niggas brains explode
So if you see a nigga holla at me passin' by
Show up the deuce when I be leave and don't be askin' why

T.I.,"Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble if I should fall
Would any one hear me screaming behind these castle walls
There's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls

Observing the estate through the gate from the outside looking in
Bet you would think I got it made, better look again
I got butler, got a maid, and a mansion
The belief is that I'm living out a millionaires fantasy
With phantoms and Ferrari's in the driveway
But you see I came and exchanged of a sane man's sanity,
Your vision jaded by the Grammy's on the mantelpiece
Just switch your camera lenses you would see the agony
Apparently it's damaging the man you see before you
On the canvas he may seem alright
But all the disadvantages
His family encounters overshadows his extravagance
Walk in my nines a while, I dare you I'll scare you
While it really seem like the kings life ain't glamorous
As seen through the eyes of untrained amateurs
Because the camera's don't see beyond the walls of the smiles
Only counts until it falls in the pile

Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble if I should fall
Would any one hear me screaming behind these castle walls
There's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls

Honestly to me,
I think I'd lose every benefit
Of all that I've accomplished
If my kids never win at shit
Me knowing this, why should the verses I have laid
Be more important to me than the persons I have raised
I guess I'm saying that to say that opportunity
But they just don't equate to all the time they take away
From the kids all the shit I did right is a mistake
If Deyjah end up a stripper and Major slinging yay
How could I ever consider myself a great
If Messiah ain't paid and Nique Nique ain't straight
Would your favorite song about the whips, money and shit
Be relevant if you found out, the money wasn't real, nope
So me being the goat shouldn't mean more to me
Than see it to a king though
From a bad ass kid to man with some dough
Otherwise I may well have stayed poor
So while they stay focused on me beefin' with flip,
Shawty low, Gucci or Ludacris
Or if I'm fucking with a hoe
Did I snitch when I got arrested or will I die over nonsense
Internally I'm dealing with this conflict
So excuse me if I don't get the chance to kiss the hand
Or slap me in the face, aye I'm just the man
If they saying I ain't the best at making hit records
It's cause this my life these ain't just rapping
Shit, you think of that deep, did ya dog
See you can't see the castle through the walls till it falls
Bitch ain't thinking with the deep, did ya dog
Cause see you can't see the castle through the walls till it falls

Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble if I should fall
Would any one hear me screaming behind these castle walls
There's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls

Nobody knows I'm all alone
Living in this castle made of stone
They say that money is freedom
But I feel trapped inside it all
And while I sit so high up on a throne
I wonder how I can feel this low
On top of the world it's beautiful
But there's no place to fall

For the record aye, I give a damn if I never said shit again
My career was meant for me to come and tell this
Honest interpretation of how affected I'm faced with
Matters most rappers used to keep locked away in the basement
The day that I walk I ain't saying that I'm amazing
Down playing the way I keep fellas from catching cases
Won't take into consideration how much it mean what I'm saying
And when I say what I mean even when I'm surrounded by the fakers
From one of the greatest sinners, blessed with most of god's graces
Who made his way amongst the greatest from the grimiest places
So next time you rating royalty,
I'm always being given to recordings than the level
Of your loyalty, obvious you've been ignoring me
Who else ya seen make it through the storm, unharmed disjointed
While all the critics was looking for prince charming
Disregarded the king of the south raised doubt
Even though he made a castle out of used to be a house
He did shit that all your favorites rappers only rap about
But most of y'all don't see the castle for the walls
And the smiles till it falls in piles so while

Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble if I should fall
Would any one hear me screaming behind these castle walls
There's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls",Castle Walls,2010

Yeah it's me again, back before you, at your mercy
Don't bend your knee again, no running from the truth
As much as we pretend, 
That it ain't what it is, than it hits C.N.N.
Apologies to my fans and my closest friends, (I'm sorry)
For letting you down, I wont take you down this road again
Most of you now saying whatever, here we go again
Blogs, radio, and television all going in
I laugh to keep from crying through all of the embarrassment
I gotta say you fucking haters is hilarious
How dare you sit right there and act as if you holier than thou'

I admit, yeah, I done some dumb shit,
Disappointed everybody I know
Try not to hold that against me though
My road to redemption has no G.P.S.
So guess the time must be invested for this to be manifested
Yes it's hard living life in the spotlight
Trying to dodge the haters same time as the cop light
The bible say let he without sin cast the stone first (stone first)
The sinner or the one who judged him, who was wrong first?
Yeah he go to work, never done no drugs or to be fair
He just drink his liquor, touch his kids, beat his wife instead
Difference is, my shortcomings hit the media
Thanks to T.M.Z., the A.J.C. and Wikipedia
See the stairway to heaven while stepping down Jacob's ladder
My good outweigh the bad, God, ain't that what really matters, nope
A matter of fact I'm wrong but after that the good I've done in your hood
Should it overshadow that?
Got the world laughing at me for the moment

Standing out ten of us
Flip a bird split it up
Antenna stickin' up
For crooked cop patrollin' 
If the red dog rollin' 
All the dough I'm throwin'
Fuck a jail I ain't going tonight
Quick to pull a four four in a fight
Under the street lights
Rollin' the dice
We was so enticed
By niggas like slick money and ice
We figure prison it should come with the light
Along with losin' your life
And there were no way we thought
We'd go to jail for any case we caught
For all the yay we bought
Not a dime did we say we borrowed
Bought damn near every pair of J's at the mall
Had our way with the broads
Hit the rink but we ain't skatin' at all
Seem like every other day we brawl
That A.K. on call

In a crib with no lights
We used to stay in the dark
Remember Captain Mac Bonin' man
They were retarded
I don't know who kept us laughing the hardest
Since our sacks was the largest
Didn't take us long to corner the market
I remember everyday was a party
Fifteen sixteen with dreams of being cocaine bosses
In pursuit of that 
We made so many terrible choices
Like the time we made away with that Millennium
From the dealership
Before our day when we killin' 'em
Late nights
Gun fights
High speed chases
So close to the good life we taste it
Damn the consequences pimp
If it's a chance we take it
First case a month in juvenile and get probation

It's amazing to see how far we come

In the state traffickin'

Young and with that attitude
Somebody finally gimme that
I ain't give a fuck how I got it
It was real as that
So if I had to peel a cat
Somebody was dead then
Since I'm a killer
That's the condition my head's in

Slave for the next man a raise nigga fuck you

You want it we can get it for ya
And even though they steady changin'
This is still a hustle
Still got them same rules

Still we maintain

Loyal beyond belief to my detriment 
It's so vital I change or blow opportunities

Now while I do not care who telling 
Meanwhile selling powder puts food in the bellies 
Well it's, unfortunate 
The orphanage couldn't keep up the mortgages 
Kid go to school stupid they teachers ignoring it 
Sorta just doomed, forced into being a goon, selling kush in a jar 
Mixing at ton, a balloon 
Consumed with the same way of life I left

They'd rather hand me to Satan

Could it be possibly the second coming of Pac is me? 
Remember that 
When he was here 
And when he died you realized you need him here 
God with me partner 
Ain't no one for me to fear 
Hindsight twenty twenty
Future not as clear 
But I'm a rider till I die 
Put bullets 'tween my eye 
I just ask that I can make my peace with god and say goodbye 
Fuck up the world like Lady Di 
One the day he died 
His wife and sons and daughters know that every day he tried 
To be a person all they wanted better verses 
They could market to the merchants 
But when they closed curtains 
You could be for certain ain't nobody perfect 
But when you're rich nobody gives a shit

T.I.,"Now I don't really care what you call me
Just as long as you don't call me bro'
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
""Goodnight its over with"" that's all she wrote
Streets like cold Chicago
Ain't nothing new I've seen it all before
But still I ball like no tomorrow
Goodnight it's over with that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote

I said it's over with that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
Goodnight its over with that's all she wrote

Its stupid how I'm going on everybody knowing that
I'm sewing up the game, destroying like they hate me for it
Eventually see they cant beat than with me they join
Others sworn under oath, or banished left completely scorn
You tell lies, get caught, nigga kick rocks
You never did blend in with the big shots
On the fast track, ain't no need for no pit stops
I just laugh at, nigga wishing it was this hot
Guess they mad at me huh, really pissed off
Better that than pissed on
I'm the Jetsons you the Flintstones
Catch me in the end zone
High stepping prime time
Thought you niggas been on
Ain't no blocking my shine
Like my new air Yeezy's, you can see me in the night time
I get rich off living life, you check to check reciting rhymes
So call me what you want, wanna hate, have a nice time
While I get stupid paper, hey my dough ain't in its right mind
(mind, mind)

Now I don't really care what you call me
Just as long as you don't call me bro'
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
""Goodnight its over with"" that's all she wrote
Streets like cold Chicago
Ain't nothing new I've seen it all before
But still I ball like no tomorrow
Goodnight it's over with that's all she wrote

Your staring straight into a barrel of hate
Terrible fate,
Not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape
Cupid shot his arrow and missed
Wait Sarah you're late, your train left.
Mascara and egg smeared on your face
Nights over goodbye, hoe
I thought that I told ya' the spilled nut ain't nothing to cry over
Never shoulda' came within Range of my Rover
Shoulda' known I was trouble soon as I rolled up,
Any chick who's coming up after I blind fold her,
She still comes back to my crib,
Must want me to mess with her mind hold up.
She must've took me for some high roller.
But I wont buy her a soda
Unless it's rock n' rye cola. (Satans cheaper)
Buy you a bag of fritos I wouldn't let you eat the fucking chip on my shoulder.
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't die for ya
Tryna pull five bucks from me is like tryna pulling five molars
You get your eyes swole up I'm on my straight grizzly
So why would I buy you a gassed teddy you're already bi-polar

Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
Its never me to get the privilege to know 'em
I roll like a desperado, now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until its over and that's all she wrote

The credit roller, curtain closer, movie over with
But don't get mad at me
Go blame the chick who wrote this shit
Ya life is sure a bitch
But she know I'm rich
That why she give me what I want and I just throw her dick
Here I go again,
I kick this shit, they get to pouring in
Peso, Euro, yeah, ah ha, I'm paid never gon' be broke again
See me posted in anything, wearing any chain
Never gon' see me toting anything
All you gon' see is bang!
Its so nice where I kick it,
Hate you never get to visit
Yeah I'm on another level
But you niggas still can get it
Its all over 'fore you finish
Sorry bro this road we end it
Won't give you the satisfaction of me giving you the business

Yeah I guess life is a bitcha ain't it Tip
And this one can say this shit
Shirt off my back, I wouldn't give you the dirt off my handkerchief
I'm giving these hoes a dose of there own medicine
Let em get a good taste of it
I'm sure you got that relationship memo by now,
But in case you didn't
This is so bad, better stick your nose to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wasting it
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker
That clock come racing in double time in it
But I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time
It may take you pricks to catch on
While you strong arm like Stretch Armstrong
Man I still say K-mart's like there's an apostrophes on it dog
And they say McDonald's isn't a restaurant well I guess I'm wrong
But if you gon' tell me that the A & W
Ain't the spot for the best hot dogs you can get the ""F"" on dog

And on my throne I remain, all alone in my lane
I'm as strong as they came
They were gone 'fore they came
Now I don't wanna hang, I slap fire with them rap guys
They just wanna sabotage my hustle shawty that's why (why, why)

Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
Goodnight it's over with, that's all she wrote
I roll like a desperado, now I never know where I'm gonna go
But still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Good night is over with that's all she wrote

You know I'm fresh out this thing
Lets go

You know you looking at a winner (winner, winner)
I'm so up there and so out there
Your so not here
You see we so up there and so out there
(Let me get it right here first)

I'm wakin'
Up in the morning
Hustlin' to the stage and fuckin' performin'
Bustlin' in through the hate and bustin' the door in
Lately nothin' misses I must have been scorin'
Speakin' of the misses
I'm watchin' 'em pourin'
Just like a drink that I'm enjoyin'
And don't mean bottles you welcome to join in
Just look at me soarin'
Feelin' like Jordan

(Aah ah) hold up I ain't finished yet
On top but you just don't get it yet
I don't get cut
I make 'em cut the check
Can't hear me in the stands
Lemme say it again
(aah ah) you ain't heard I'm the shit
On top but you just don't get it yet
I never got cut but I make 'em cut the check
So hate on but guess what

I feel like I can't miss
I know they want me to fall
But ain't nothin' bigger than this
So just pass me the ball
You know you looking at a winner, winner, winner
I can't miss, can't lose, can't miss
You know you looking at winner, winner, winner
'cause I'm a winner
Yeah I'm a winner

I'm stepping out in the evenin'
Keep women screamin'
He gotta be cheatin'
But I'm so breezy
I make this look easy
No fakin' I'm seasoned
You gotta believe me
I went from TV's
To screens to D-V-D's
To C-D's,
To M-P-3's overseas
I got no time to talkin' its borin'
Just look at me soarin'

You know you looking at winner, winner, winner
'cause I'm a winner
Yeah I'm a winner

That's right,
You see the Porsche Panamera
Got em in hysteria
The turbo super fast and that McLaren even scarier
Hear me turning corners burning rubber in your area
I'm hard to follow once I pop the clutch and hit the throttle
I'm recession proof
I don't run the money, money run to me
In this economy guess I'm considered an anomaly
Bugatti's, Maserati, new Ferrari's I've got one of each
My future bright tight like picture guy in front of me
Turn pain to progression in every studio session
Passion into perfection to failure I'm an exception
Fuck, if you wanna lose, to battle me is a blessin'
You couldn't die in the hands of a better man
I ran from the bottom to the best no auto-tune
Been in the lead, say you seen King follow whom?
Never that, I'm the freshest go ask whoever that
King back money long as an old Cadillac

Strike me down if I lie

What am I?
If I hurt her I ain't try to,
In the club I may decide to
Ride through
She got proof
Well I got alibi's to
Couple million dollar worth of bags and full of shoes
Seven carrot solitaire, Caribbean water blue
Range Rover, Porsche Panamera and the Bentley coupe
All the shit I did for her and this who you gon' listen to
Her life I submit to you is evidence

Not fake like a prosthetic leg or prostitute

Getting right, good girls got them getting busy like
Big dykes, eating so much pussy they forget pipe
All got boyfriends, tell me they don't hit it right
They come see me so they can come be freaks
In the backseat, everything fast like a track meet
All I can see are titties, pussy lips, and ass cheeks
Actually, no exaggeration, no imagining
Real talk, my reality is your fantasy
Keisha, Kim, Tameka, Shay, Alisha and Gloria
Chasing this broad tryna find euphoria
Name notorious, dick game glorious
Find me shorty when your boyfriend boring ya

Shake it like some Texas Pete dropping on your collard greens
Make it hotter and she want a dollar do you follow me?
Shake it like a tambourine, shake it like a tambourine
Shake it like a tambourine, shake it like a tambourine
Smelling like some tangerines, rolling like she on some beans
Garter belt full of green, booty busting out the seams
Shake it like a tambourine, she shake it like a tambourine
Shake it like a tambourine, about to shake it like a tambourine

Once upon a rhyme I knew this girl and she was fine
As everything outdoors, the kinda girl I describe her
Like Michael Jordan when he's froze in a pose of a jumpman
Top flight security on these hoes, man
She drop it low only for me to pick her up
When she's liquored up, I'm leaving my fingerprints on her butt
Ten-hut at attention as we stand for this woman
General Patton, boy, stop, we think she's coming
Loving the way that I'm licking her down, boy, you bluffing
Nothing, while a nigga like me be straight up royal flushing
But this ain't about playing no cards, dummy
Her get me open my sugar and she go hard for me
Even take a charge for me if the coppers caught us riding
To get a tray of fruit and a pack of 1.5s and
I'm all the way on them papers, she all the way on my team
We burn it down like California trees in the breeze (FIRE!)

She said her name was Tangerine, damn, the American Dream
She all about her fucking cream, shake it like a tambourine
Shake it like a tambourine, she shake it like a tambourine
Shake it like a tambourine, she shake it like a tambourine
She said her name was Billie Jean, said she wanna show me things
I pulled out a stack of green, shake it like a tambourine
Shake it like a tambourine, shake it like a tambourine
Shake it like a tambourine, shake it like a tambourine",Tangerine,2010
T.I.,"My garage is flawless, under a hundred thou' ain't allowed
Maybach triple white like I'm riding in a cloud
No denim on my seats, baby you gon' need a towel
Ride sexy through the city, see me you will be aroused
My bankroll so well endowed, 
Pull bitches from M-I-A to A-T-L in style
And in crowds catch me in town, on the strip in Vegas
Chilling, filling bitches faces with babies
Bitch bite your tongue, this just ain't a Mercedes
Tell the A.T.F. I'm riding with another 3-80
That's my car cost, y'all thought I would fall off
That was just a small loss, we can have a ball off
Fly to N.Y., meet me at the Waldorf
Historian architecture Victorian
Riding in the past like you're driving a DeLorean
Hard times, never heard of those in the 'Bach
My feet kicked up, get my dick sucked with the curtains closed
And for the record kid, my final question is
How your bitch gon' feel in that 
When you two pull up next to this?
Ha ha ha ha, Maybach Music nigga!

[Chorus]
Everybody knows, how the story goes
Money and the clothes, they gon' come and go
But guess who stays the same? You gon' see my name
Stroll real slow, with the curtains low

Yo, piff that I'm blowing on is fucking up the ozone
Plus I keep a dope line similar to Cold Stone's
Ice cream, pipe dreams
Is what they have when I pull up in that light thing
I put a hurting on, I got the curtains drawn
Whoever ain't getting shitted on, I'm squirting on
I'm in the six-deuce, fifty-sevens for the health
Chopper in the trunk, .45 for the belt
Bunch of wax dummies, all you guys gonna melt
Live for your kids, die for yourself
Bottles in the sky if you ride for the wealth
Peas on the block, pies on the shelf
If I ain't in the back of the 'Bach, I ain't in nothing else
Haha, I'm something else

Everybody knows how the story goes
Money and the clothes, they gon' come and go
But guess who stays the same? 
You gon' see the name
Stroll real slow

Uh (justice league) 
Cigar please
I came alive like a moth in the summer time
Japanese wheel blades all samurai
Shine brighter than them bitches on the other side
Time to make a blind motherfucker recognize
Ammunition got the competition nonexistent
Had to bubble crack but didn't have a pot to piss it
I'll double that, how dare you try to knock a nigga?
Street scholar, graduated no father figure
Still tote chrome, check my chromosomes
Meet me halfway with things and a mobile home
Money machines, yeah they ring like a mobile phone
I'm a seven-up, I need a coca-cola loan
I'm in the hood like I'm James Evans
Cashmere hand-made sweater
Me and money got a vendetta
Looking back, to tell the truth I could've did betta'
Parents never had a good job
Now it's Black American Express cards, uh

I told y’all muh'fucka's once, I think I’m hungry
Finna eat y'all niggas' lunch
Y'all niggas cunts, I’m from the commonwealth
Where wealth ain't common
Where niggas roll around with chrome solvers, looking for problems
Mouth full of gold, flame when they roll
Arthritic fingers, niggas bang when they stroll
Tradin' in the hats for the cane and the gold
The golds for the chain and the cane was on swole
Ayo Tip, get these peon niggas told

Still stand tall when it all falls down
Whether Hollywood Hills or a one horse town
You should know better
There’s no better than these four letters
More than ever niggas want me dead
'Cause they're starving and I'm getting fed
But fuck 'em anyway
I’d rather be me on my worst day
Than to be a sucka' nigga on his birthday
All cake no candles, just a living example
Ten toes down, all out, no sandals
Godfather, young Marlon Brando
Let me make sure they understand, yo
Here ye, hear ye, you wise you fear me
Real niggas on their shine, much obliged, merci

Everybody wanna criticize him 'bout how bad he ended up
Look how bad he could've been
I could've caught a body, sold a brick to somebody
Who volunteered my information to the federalies
I made it out of all of that like I ain't gonna be proud of that
So petty shit, you sticking to me, give me all you got of that
Doing this for all my niggas
Who'd rather go to prison than to let a nigga kill him
So we leaving this P-O snub-nose in his denim
Trap or death is waiting 'round the corners that he been in
On bended knee, God forgive us, we’ve been sinnin'
In our defense, look at the options we was given
Layin' in the prison cell, starin' at the ceilin'
Back in this bitch again, guess they wasn't bullshittin', huh?
Still wonder where it all went wrong
Since Phil got killed I ain't never moved on
Like I’m still in the club where the blows got thrown
When my crown fell down and I got dethroned
Bunch of niggas around but I feel all alone
Like a piece of me is missing, guess it never came home
Probably died in a van when it all hit the fan
Save the life of a friend, we don’t all get the chance

Now here I stand with blood on my hands
Trying hard to explain so his mom understand
I'm at fault for the loss of the soul of a man
Only soldiers know how that’ll take a toll on a man
Burden's on the world on my shoulders: heavy
Visibly composed, my emotions buried
Scary, so if I pop a pill
Smoke a blunt or take a shot, y'all, let a nigga live
Still baffled how my life unraveled
In the meantime, time just traveled
Can’t see behind the walls of my castle
Opinionated peons son, but who asked you?
I tell you what you do, take your two cents
Kick rocks to a fountain, pitching to make a wish
Shit, if wishes had wings, they’d all make it to heaven
And we’d all be kings
Hahaha, if wishes had wings, they’d all make it to heaven
And we’d all be kings

You gift her roses I'm the one she brings the rose to
So you say your shinin well I guess I'm shinin more
So high up I'm soaring thirty and I'm like a dinasoar

Thought I lost a step but guess again
Back to ballin, getting bread, bringing checks in
Yeah, like we did on my last case
I show you how to make a blessin out of bad breaks
Let me set these niggas ass straight
Holding up there clothes bags up losing up fag bait
Them hot pants bad for your prize state
Lime green, hot pink, a drag queen hot date
In stores asking for the same size the bitches buy
They say it's here, but where I'm from we call it sissy fairy

[Chorus]

Ay, before us there was none
After us no more there will ever be
This the greatest show on earth you will ever see
Still do it for my niggas in the street getting to it
Blowing money like my nigga Big Meech used to do it
Say we blowing money fast, big old money bag
Three four hundred carrots just to make them suckas mad
Back in the side of the winner of every battle
And the best since I was rapping in a rattle world travel
As you comment on the rumors of what have you bewared dude
Prayer can't prepare you how dare you
Disrespect my presence peasents I will tear you
A new one, I poop on your egos and move on
Rolls Royce back seat no grey coupon
A true don, three piece polished suit on
Pee on, see it ain't no neon in my new one
Tear the truth on every song I spew on (blaww!)

In the Phantom, I'm lookin fly in whatever I'm in
Mostly you big niggas soft like the Michelin man.
When you see other niggas standin with a pencil in hand
Carry me on stage rappin with my dick in my hand.
Tryna distiguish the difference between a bitch and a fan
Outa bed, rolled one homie, never again,

Chopper round shots fired,
Nigga flatlines zip came to it and keep the powder savoral.
Drive bys on dirt bike with Meek Milli O.
Crow rock shells,
I bleach em and watch em fade away.
And leave a nigga block,
Wetter than a rainy day
West beat Beavis when you scared to leave the crib.
Guzzi and he inspired for some of the dolla mill.
I'm worth mills and I beat a niggas ass still
Ya'll niggas get wasted I ain't talkin spilled bills.

And YM still strapped snookin with the cleava.

T.I.,"Hardcore G shit, homie, I don't play around
Ain't shit sweet bout the peach this Atlanta, clown
Home of the dealers and the strippers and the clubs, though
Catch you coming out that Magic City with a snub, ho
Lurking in the club on tourist motherfuckers
Welcome to Atlanta up your jewelry, motherfucker!
These monkey niggas looking for some Luda and Jermaine
And all a nigga found was a Ruger and some pain
Pow, motherfucker, pow! Come up off the chain
Pow, motherfucker, pow! One off in the brain
We some money-hungry wolves, and we down to eat the rich
Your bodyguard ain't shit, we strip him like a stripper bitch
These real-ass killers move in silence with violence
The minute it set off, we the motherfucking wildest
How you from Atlanta that they never speak upon
Where everybody got a sack of dope and a gun

And you know just how it go
We ain't playing round with that bullshit
Nigga, we ain't let that shit go
When you come here, you better come correct
This real G shit, you gotta show respect

Once upon a time in the projects
An O.G. saw a young Bun B as a prospect
Thought that I would understand the streets from a very young age
So he opened up the G code to the front page
He sat me on the porch, said, ""This where little dogs sit""
Pointed at the yard, said, ""That's where big dogs shit""
He said, ""Don't leave til your ass get growed
And don't come back til your ass get throwed
Whatever you want is whatever you can have
Bring the pain and leave em wet, like they soaking in some salve
When you step out on the ave, make sure they wanna see ya
Cause being trill is an onomatopoeia
Be about it like a G, a hater wanna catch you slipping
Try to be a Jordan, but settle for a Pippen""
Player, I ain't even tripping, but I don't really care
Cause my pistol's in your face, so put your hands in the air

And you know just how it go
We ain't playing round with that bullshit
Nigga, we ain't let that shit go
When you come here, you better come correct
This real G shit, you gotta show respect

In a six, I'm riding with a pistol grip, banana clip
From Simpson Road to Adamsville, I'm repping this Atlanta shit
Nigga trying to handle up, let's see can they handle this
A hundred round at em, that ain't no Louisiana shit
Drinking on that Hennessey, blowing on that cannabis
Amerikkka's nightmare, trap nigga fantasy
A record full of felonies, searching for a better me
But choppers go off in my hood like Iraq, Cuba, Tel Aviv
Pretty nigga, let him be fuck him, shorty
Sucker nigga I'll never be, don't give a fuck about it
Quick to round up on that Audi, make em get the fuck up out it
Nigga better be about it, he deserve it he allow it
What's a coward to a kamikaze?
He ain't robbed a man, ain't predator or prey, the law of nature where I stay
I catch you slipping with that K, ain't no illusion, no confusion
Better come up off that cake and all that jewelry or you're snoozing

And you know just how it go
We ain't playing round with that bullshit
Nigga, we ain't let that shit go
When you come here, you better come correct
This real G shit, you gotta show respect

Wha-da-da-dang, wha-da-da-da-da-dang
Listen to my clip before that five go bang
Bang bang, guap time, rep game
We the readers of the books and the leaders of the crooks
Predators, we eyeballing all of y'all lames
Let me fall off, I'm taking all of y'all chains
All of y'all watches and all of y'all cars
Well, who you talking to? All of y'all stars
All of y'all rappers and producers and such
No homo promo, homie, you might get your ass touched
Like Def Jam circa '83, you get rushed
If you rolling with some winners, then you rolling with us
I know some dope country niggas, but them niggas ain't weak
Know they dressing looking hard, but them niggas ain't cheap
I don't make dance music, this is R.A.P
Opposite of the sucker shit they play on T.V

And you know just how it go
We ain't playing round with that bullshit

And say damn I'm killing them, damn I'm killing them

And I'm still here with a lifestyle you would kill for
Still here with the same shoes that I had on from the get-go
Straight out of Atlanta, Georgia, for any of y'all that didn't know
And I'm never that hard to find because 420 is my zip code
But back then couldn't get dro, 'cause back then I was this broke
That's why I got so many hustles, bruh man from the fifth floor
What would you do in the middle of the winter
When the sun goes down and it gets cold?
Growin' up in a house with no stove, no doors, no walls, no windows
And my brother was always fresher
I would go to school in his clothes, when I did go
So that's why now this the type of life that I live for
Comin' up as a youngin', man some nights I would vomit
I would throw up on myself 'cause I was so sick to my stomach
Now I'm the shit, fix the plumbing
Bare with my y'all, I'm this close

I'm fresh off my pit stop, flow airtight with no Ziploc
Get shit pop when my shit drop, no hip-hop, this Tip hop
I'm back standin' at the tip top where I belong, it won't be long
'Til you hear me on a B.o.B song, some chick gettin' my skeet on
To touch the sole of my feet, G you gon' have to get your reach on
I'm up all the way high, all the way fly on the ground and I'm off the radar
Bernie Madoff money, dawg got killers paid off with it all
I got the juice, could you place a call and we place a call to who place a call
Beg your pardon, I'm too hard, I disregard what you say
Back up the trunk and pass the buck, here's where I'm stoppin' today

And I'm still here with the same team, nigga stay down
Still here for the east side, ain't a thing change but the bank account
Hands high when I come 'round 'cause I'm killin' this shit nigga, hands down
And I go hard, my passport's like a postcard
Give a fuck if I'm solo, I'll go toe to toe with your whole squad
With the soul of a soldier but even still I don't want no parts
And no niggas with no hearts, you cocksuckers need throat guards
I'm throwed off for the most part, a young dog with an old bark
Flow dumb, but I'm so smart, I compose art, call me Mozart
My nightlife's like a soap opera with two chicks like it's Noah's ark
They got nice dresses with no bras with good bodies like ""Oh God!""
From a poor child to on top like a mohawk
But I always knew I'd go far, like a gas truck with no park
So no applause, hold the applause
Just put your hand up if you know the song

Could you learn to love a troubled man?

You sure you wanna roll with me? I'm a complicated man
Live my life close to the edge, it ain't near safe to stand
I'm Trouble Man, always into something
Numb to the consequences, guess it's coming if it's coming
But so much shit they say that I can't do because I'm famous
Guess I should live in a bubble like these other entertainers
The danger's so enticing to me, I don't even notice it
Guess I get away or get arrested before it's over with
Prison sentence every year, got everybody after me
Reaper on my heels, I'm just praying he don't catch a G
Imagine me and you, somewhere happy with a few hundred mills,
Sill I could go to jail for some years,
Cause I push it to the limit, the danger's so exciting
I'm loving every minute, girl this life ain't nothing like it
And you only live once so as long as I'm alive
I'll be living on the edge

Fist fights in night clubs for rap beefs,
Shootings, retaliations, yeah, it's that deed!
I guess they just got to catch me when they catch me
Cause I'm putting it in they life if they attempt to disrespect me
Especially since I know they say what go around come around
That's why when we go around I keep a gun around
The bullshit, there be none around here
But I got a secret though, I wanna change, I swear!
But suckers won't let me and feds still sweat me
So I'm looking for the worst to have you praying for the best

I'm in a Merci she kissin' on me Hershey's
We in this bitch!
I'm sucka duckin', I'm sucka free
That's yo main bitch? She fuckin' me
I don't fuck with niggas, I'm a fuckin' G
It's Meek Milly, T.I. fuckin' P!

I'm sucka duckin', I'm sucka free
You ain't a G, Don't fuck with me
Them sucka niggas out of style G season
Them sucka niggas out of style G season

My best flow too cold to just bring it out
But go and talkin' crazy tho' you get yourself singled out
Half a million bucks a pack a whole arena out
Bein' a sucka I don't know the first thing about
You get the seen about cummin' out yo face
Like a volcano have lava runnin' out yo face
Hey, if yo ass out of place
You'll find the weapons they took away I'll replace
What can I say? Another year, another case
Another sentence completed, I'm confident and conceited
I'm sucker free, sucker ducking, so tell them suckers to beat it
Don't fuck with me busta, trust me your future will be deleted
Such a G, ain't no touching me, luckily I defeated the odd
Without my tool, Allah and glory to God, and I ain't even Islamic
So sick, whenever I vomit just throw me a mill or 2
And that oughta settle my stomach
Bout some money he done it, call me Mr. He Run It
These niggas ain't really bout it, they just be speaking Ebonics
I'm nothing short of iconic, promise you, you don't want it
Strong as gin and tonic, my left you won't see it coming
My right you'll be running from it, I catch you with it, you done
I'm a keep it a 100, you better get you a gun
Word bond real talk, do my dirt all by my lonely

T.I.,"Hey, have you ever loved somebody so much you can’t stand it
But can’t do without 'em?
Do anything for 'em cause you truly do adore 'em
Like dedicate songs, write poems
But they be on that bullshit and you try to ignore 'em
But you feel like they feel like you ain’t right for 'em
Therefore your heart’s torn
Between bein' with 'em forever, leavin' 'em never
But it seem like you arguin', fightin' over whatever
Maybe we can leave, find someone better
Even though you will, you never know nothin' better
My heart say ""nah, she can’t leave, won't let her""
Been head over heels since the very day I met her
Fell so deep in love I ain’t been able to get up
Sometimes I want some peace of mind and she don’t shut up
Love her to death, don’t know whether to kiss her or kill her

Should’ve known it
From the start it was already over
We were just too dumb to notice
And we'd pray but
Even love couldn’t save us
We'd wake up
On a bed of guns and roses
And we don’t know which one to choose
When either way, we’re gonna lose
Still we'd pray but
Even love couldn’t save us
We'd wake up
On a bed of guns and roses

Hah, I guess I’d rather suffer with her than be miserable without her
I buy a lot of Prada, Gucci and Balenciaga
To keep her content, and keep down the nonsense
With every corner we turn, around the conflict
Mostly dumb shit, like who she run with
Where the fuck you been? Your pants, they don’t fit
Really, honestly speaking, some things I don’t get
No matter how much she try she can’t make it make more sense
Therefore, here we go again
Screamin', yellin' at the top of our lungs, she goin' in
Seeing the kind of shit I be like ""if you was a man
I would go in your shit, for real, no shit""
But I love her so much that I can’t forget
That the feel of a kiss, it could heal when I’m sick
Still, I don’t like to feel like this
If I wouldn’t miss her, I would try to get her killed right quick

Should’ve known it
From the start it was already over
We were just too dumb to notice
And we'd pray but
Even love couldn’t save us
We'd wake up
On a bed of guns and roses
And we don’t know which one to choose
When either way, we’re gonna lose
Still we'd pray but
Even love couldn’t save us
We'd wake up
On a bed of guns and roses

Every time we say our goodbyes
A little piece of my heart breaks off inside
I don’t really ever know why
If I could live without you I’d try

Should’ve known it
From the start it was already over
We were just too dumb to notice
And we'd pray but
Even love couldn’t save us
We'd wake up
On a bed of guns and roses

T.I.,"Jesus loves me
Jesus loves me
This I know
For the Bible tells me so

Sometimes I wake up feel like I’m in Forest City, Arkansas
Although I’m free I’m still a prisoner of all I saw
Sometimes I leave this booth at 4 am, and ride down Simpson
Just prayin homie, and reminiscin
Sometimes my nightmare seems so real, feel like I’m still in prison
I reach out for Tameeka hand, I’m trippin cuz she missin'
It’s pitch black dark, like I’m in solitary
So if my freedom was a dream, Lord please prepare me
It seems like satan want my soul and he refuse to share me
My former friends talk about me like I’m dead and buried
Bastards want me in the casket for my head cold
Trouble in my soul, the devil got a hold
Did everything to me but kill me, like he did to Job
He took my diamonds, took my rhymes, took my fame and gold
He took my business interest, he took my wife and kids
But he can’t take nothing God can’t give me back again

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

I went to jail, stood tall, then I fell again
It seems like I’m Jonah and right back in that will again
I felt the panic when they locked me in that cell again
I had to pray and meditate, control my breath again
Like Lazarus I’ve risen from a better death again
The Lord is with me, I could stand against a thousand men
I read the songs of David, prayed to be like Solomon
God’s wisdom walkin' all amongst these hollow men
I’m a king, I dare to lead when they just follow me
I see a better way, I’m keeping my eyes on the sparrow
I’m exiting my Egypt, tell em wave goodbye to pharaoh
Mother told me before she left this earth that I was special
And because I’m special, they gon' make me suffer
Like they crucified Jesus right in front his mother
Suckas, but he arose on the 3rd day
Just save your head and get a favour, let the church say…

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

Yes, He loves me

I come apart baby, but that's OK 'cause
Trouble man, don't get in my way

I'm just a hood nigga I ain't never had shit
Just a bad attitude and a bad bitch
Duffle back full of tools and a half brick
30, 40, 50 grand in the mattress

Just left the crossroads, my soul, unsold
Refrigerated console, the curtains on my car door
Raw ho, caviar, sushi and escargot
Everywhere I go fresh to death and clean as a bar of soap
Getting blowed like trumpets in the wind in Chicago
God knows I'm hot as El Diablo
Wrist rockier than Colorado off road
Also my flows I'm taking back although
My art's so Leonardo Da Vinci Picasso
The rain gon' come down on your head like tarp holes
I guess these other rappers that's cool as far as soft goes
Sorry Charlie party's over shawty shop closed
King home, bank roll on King Kong
Got these suckas in my scope with the beam on
Prayin' for my downfall you can dream on
Make sure I'm back in the Maybach gettin my lean on

Don't be angry now if I'm on the same street

You bogus in the lambo if you ain't lifting the door up
You bogus poppin' pills if you ain't pickin the ho up
You bogus running out on your kids my nigga grow up
For God's sake, like a wedding, cutting large cake
For large stakes let the hammer bang broad day
Ay, nevermind what the blogs say
This what my mind and my heart say

My philosophy profit off of my properties
Get it, flip it, we got to be rich, that broke shit is obsolete
Possibly off of my rocker, watch how you watching me
Sophisticated, psychotic, fly as a pilot
Officially silent, all you wish you could get I got it
Unlimited titanium nigga, what's in yo wallet?
Out of gladiator college, I made it summa cum laude
While you clowns couldn't have got a cap and gown if you bought it
I parlay with Saudis, buying crude oil and diamonds
Hustle January, July, fly to Dubai
A broke nigga telling me 'bout how I'm dividing the pies
Like a blind nigga telling me it's an eye for an eye
Bullheaded and stubborn I be that way until I die
But find a nigga with more hustle then me I dare you to try
And according to the hand on my Audemar
It's my time to shine so fuck ya'll

What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to
What should I be sorry for

What should I be sorry for

I grew up in the gutter, life a motherfucker
I guess that why I don't trust a motherfucker
Seen a nigga snitch on they mom, shoot at they brother
Go to prison in love with a bitch and a nigga fuck her
I seen real G's destroyed by real suckers
Innocent ladies raped and defenceless babies abducted
Such a horrible truth, but you see it over and over
It's nothing, get numb to it and your heart grow colder
Pacify your pain with a chain and a Rover
Fuck it, justify your action with stacking your dough up
You show up with a brick of cocaine and baking soda
Just enough for me to blow up, nigga hold up
Switch the flow up, 'cause these niggas be snitchin' so much
I promise all they missing's the badge, coffee, and donuts
Go to jail so what, never see my integrity perish
That ain't the Harris' way, study my pedigree
Promise I'm one of the only ones who keep it 100
Probably why I think they all out to get me, you can't convince me
Large money and fame will plant seeds of envy
To make my partners resent me enough to come and get me
Catch me slippin' and hit me, just like they did 50
'Cause I'm in the position that he think he should be given
Listen, dawg, the fact of the matter is
I'm on a narrow path and we all can't travel

What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to

Even if you gotta live
I learned that apartment is way more exciting than a big ass house on a hill
I used to be a way better writer and a rapper
When I used to want a black Karmann Ghia
Now a nigga speeding in a Porsche
Feeling like I'm going off a course
Cut these fuck niggas off
Negative in my life, scream that till I'm hoarse
Duck these get the fuck off me projectiles, bitch you ain't really got a choice
I'm living my life live yours
I don't even like rapping fast, but that's how the word come to me
Talk to me sideways nigga that's your ass
Slow it down, this that shit that'll make you call your momma
Say hey I'm sorry for begging for all them clothes you couldn't afford
And this the type of shit that'll make you call your rap partner
And say I'm sorry I'm awkward, my fault for fuckin' up the tours
I hated all the attention so I ran from it
Fuck it if we did, but I hope we ain't lose no fans from it
I'm a grown-ass kid, you know ain't never cared about no damn money
Why do we try so hard to be stars, just to dodge comments
And this that shit that'll make you call your baby mama
When you gone on half a pill, don't know why but that's how it is
Then you take a flight back to the crib, y'all make love like college kids
And you say all the shit you gon' do better, we can try this shit again
'Round the time the dope wear off, you feel stupid, she feel lost
That's that dope, I mean, I mean dopamine you think Cupid done worn off
Waiting in the hallway with her arms crossed
Baby boy face full of applesauce
Maybe should have stayed but it ain't yo fault
Too much pressure, I peel off, I'm sorry
Was young and had to choose between you
And what the rest of the world might offer me, shit what would you do
Well I'd probably do it differently if second the chance
Only if some cool ass older man would've let me know in advance
This, this quarry, that is dug so deep in a father's chest
When he feel that he's broken up his nest
And he figured shit he was just doing the best that he could
Which end up being the worst that he could
And all some pussy nigga on the internet can say is that verse ain't good
It's boring, boring?
Really?

When I'm disgusted with this world and I can hardly breathe and
Told so many lies, don't know what to believe
I discussed it with this girl, and this is what she said
She said lay down baby, baby, rest your weary head up
I love these distractions but my mind don't wanna rest
But my body disagree so I laid up on her breasts, yes

T.I.,"Smoking weed, riding chrome
Only thing I've ever known
Is walk on the wild side
Welcome to our life

Slangin' keys, spraying K's
Every day we getting paid
To walk on the wild side
Welcome to our life

Come take a little walk with me through my neighbourhood
And come spend a day in my trap
Get your paper right and that yay some good
But just keep a tool in your lap
My lil' patna holding that work
Nigga want weight then keep around back
Betta not violate on my turf
Nigga yesterday just died like that
Ain't no investigation, no statements
And no witnesses, we ain't seen shit
Pull up after dark with that jewellery on
To come see a bitch, that what he get it
We on dark roads with no street lights
That pistol play after fist fights
And them geek monsters walk all night
With they crack pipes tryna get right
Midnight we shoot dice
The whole house smelling like cooked crack
You beat me, and you talk shit
You get shot bitch, and I took that
Hood rats on deck, that loud is all I blow
This shit to you it might sound wild
But this life is all I know

Smoking weed, riding chrome
Only thing I've ever known
Is walk on the wild side
Welcome to our life

Slangin' keys, spraying K's
Every day we getting paid
To walk on the wild side
Welcome to our life

Can you picture me back in '93
Bumpin' Dr. Dre while I hit some weed
Cut school, made ten G
Thirteen, trying to get keys
At fifteen, I was full-grown
Get wrong, get bust on
My uncle gave me a bunch of work
And that shit was gone by the next morning
Young wild nigga runnin' with me
Homicide wasn't nothing to us
Dead body wasn't nothin' to see
That pistol play was just fun to us
I was 19 with two felonies
One of my best friend had a life sentence
How my uncle friend was just like me
And had a bunch of partners no longer living
All about that cocaine dealing
No education, no pot to piss in
Old school, on chrome wheel
Window tinted, pistol hidden
That's the shit that I come from
In my heart, fear ain't none
Stand tall, I can't run from
That wild side, that I walk on

Smoking weed, riding chrome
Only thing I've ever known
Is walk on the wild side
Welcome to our lives

Slangin' keys, spraying K's
Every day we getting paid
To walk on the wild side
Welcome to our lives

All I ever did was put on
All my old friends tryna get on
Shorty fell out, making diss songs
Never talk down when I get home
Ain't the type of nigga you can shit on
Hundred spokes, brick, chrome
God body, big bone
That's hard body, Jim Jones
Niggas know the sound of how we switch on him
Finna wild out on a Tip song
Better make a toast, nigga, Tip home
First get the bread, then get going
From the land of the lead where they spit chrome
Where most kids never get to live long
They get pissed off, get pissed on
Pistol whipped and stripped, homie
Left for a minute and they switched on me
Caught them talking down, tryna bitch on me
And they snitch on me, ain't got shit on me
So my guess is death is what they wish on me
So I'm blowing on them candles
Closed lids and dark eyes
Cause hate's never part time when you on that wild side

Smoking weed, riding chrome
Only thing I've ever known
Is walk on the wild side

Kickin' it with your sons, trippin' never realize
How good you got it, been so wrapped up in yo losses
You couldn’t see the profits, could still be in the projects
Instead releasing projects just poppin' when niggas floppin'
So you went back to prison, TIP it could've been a coffin
Now since we talkin' you been trippin' ever since I died
Appreciate you missin' me but G, you still alive
I’m lookin' down at you, and sendin' smiles to you
I check the record now, oh tell Tameka hi would you
Told you she would get you, that’s good 'cause shorty ride wit you
Kids getting big, seen King riding a bicycle
Saw Niq Niq drive a car, see Bubba big as you

And listen to me son, and pay attention to me
Seems like I’m the only one that you would listen to
I never knew the time that I ain’t get to spend with you
Would ever result in you making yourself miserable
You gotta let it go, it’s painful, I already know
The past is the past, just learn from it, grow
So you got Crystal wit you? And your sister Precious too
I’m proud of you, did better than I expected you to
Although I knew you was special when you was smaller
That’s why I was so much harder on you, knew you were smarter
Not much convo to offer, I wasn’t much of a talker
Great to see you doin' better than me, even as a father
Taking care of yo mama, overcoming the drama
Your life is wonderful son, don’t let 'em take it from you
Keep living it to the fullest, treasure it, it’s a blessing
Be thankful for all this beauty, when it’s over with forget it

What up, Phil? So good to hear from you, we missing you
Remembering all of our conversations, daily reminiscing you
The good the day they low, could tell they don’t know who to listen to
Today I watch over Jeanette like she was my own and that could be difficult
I swear it’s so unfair that I’m right here and you up there
I miss you so much now to the point I call your name but you not there
Now I can’t rest and I can’t do shit
Off my mind, I’m so upset
It wasn’t your time to leave me yet
It broke my heart to see you dead
Shot with bullets that were meant for me, family's never forgiving me
I know, but all I could do was follow your memory
But pops I thank you so much for leaving, I had to grow up
Slinging crack on the corner ain’t quite the future you wanted for me
Was it? And this pain I feel it never goes away
Does it? This load I carry get no lighter
I grew up all on my own with a broken heart and a broken home
Taught me everything I’ve known
Owe you everything I own
I must admit you raised a warrior, my life could be a story book
Hope you proud of me, didn’t graduate from college but
Thanks for listening to me,
So long, I had it bottled up
Til we meet in person let’s keep speaking through my verses for life

I try to provoke her by giving money and jewelry and accessories
Instead of the recipe with a legacy of taking her to another place when I get it

Twista going in warp speed breaking atoms
Blowing O.G. has got me creating anti matter
Let her pop it and smoke on it with me now

Because you know the way I think is an anomaly
And I'ma be strange as Lady Gaga

T.I.,"Ay, in my apartment a long time ago
I knew a bad bitch, but she was kind of slow
Still gave it up when it's a few of us
She let me finger fuck her on the school bus
We used to cut school with her and run train
She want to hang with us, we want one thing
Just penetrating that throat dog
She choke on it like Smoke Dog
But whenever I fucked up my re-up
In a dice game I go see her
She'll give me enough to buy a quarter ounce
And then blow a blunt of that reefa'
She used to buy a nigga new sneakers
Pay the bill on my beeper
Just so she can pay to put a ""69""
And I know what time to go freak her
Then one day I just asked her
""Why you always give your ass up?
I mean damn these hoes get paid
All you do is get laid, this shit don't add up.""
She said, ""Tip, all I wanna do is feel love
Even if I know it ain't real love
Even if I know a nigga only finna hit it
Then never call back, I still fuck""
And that's fucked up, she's so trill
I need somethin', she go steal
When the trap hot and police ride
Nigga, guess where we go chill?
For 'bout four years she held dope
And my four pounds till' it goes down
I remember shawty, she stayed down
I won't say her name because she married now

When the lights go out and I'm in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head oh
All of the things that I did back then
Oh when I'm in my bed
I think of all the memories I've had oh
All of the things that I did back then

She would always turn heads when she'd fall through
She would always make moves how a boss do
And she never gave any nigga time of day
But she the chick all the niggas tried to talk to
But when it came to me, she had a thing for me
When we kick it she roll up the weed for me
And we'd both cut class post up in the cut steady
Watching just to see if the police coming
We got close over time, her and I
Right around the time that I first got signed
Come to think about it I was 'bout 17
I ain't even have a license, couldn't even drive
I was going back and forth with these flights
Another show after show, each night
She became so suspicious of these other bitches
She'd go through my phone and we'd fight
Talk about torn between the two
Wasn't really much more that we could do
Wasn't really much space for us
But she stayed down with every tour she seen me do
But I guess one night I had a few
Huh, one night I had a few
Yeah, this little chick that caught my eye
I told her ""hurry up, meet me at the room""
And no, I didn't have a contraceptive
And my common sense neglected
And two months later next thing I know
I got a text that said ""I'm pregnant""
And you can almost bet she kept it
That's the reason why you left me
On top of all that, it wasn't even mine
I went and got paternity tested, damn!

When the lights go out and I'm in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head oh
All of the things that I did back then
Oh when I'm in my bed
I think of all the memories I've had oh
All of the things that I did back then

Wait, hold up, is that you?
With them big ol' thighs after school?
Jay 3-0-5 had gave me high five
When I said I’m in hot pursuit
You said I won’t ride until Kendrick drive
A new Monte Carlo that cruise
And that shot my pride, I tried to improv'
But no freestyle I never do
You looking for the nigga with the tallest 'fetti
You overlooking every nigga that ain’t quite ready
To make it rain on you like about to break a levee
Hold up, that pussy petty
Yeah, your nails did, your hair did
Your cell phone is selfish
It only got numbers that come with a Hummer
Her new prima donna I smelt it
Tried to make you mine, ho!
Tried to make some time, ho!
But I ain’t got the time or the patience
To stop and wait in line, ho!
Her dreams holds Versace
She fall for Armani
Only deal with rich niggas
Fuck you and Mitt Romney
I’m grown now I’m on my own now
I’m po'ppin'
Change my phone now
When I get home now
I got o'ptions
Fast forward, wait is that you?
With them big old thighs after school?
And your 3 kids and 3 baby daddies
And car note that’s overdue? I know

When the lights go out and I'm in my bed

Don't want your money, want your love

E'verbody want that money what you want
High as hell trying to have some fucking fun
You don't need 'em but the diamonds make it shine
Tried to kick it just can't find the time
It's the middle of the week, this ain't even the weekend
Red carpet events, every time you see pimps
It's good pussy in the passenger seat
My lil' homies hang with me, I be passing 'em freaks

Jewels n' drugs, play that hustle
Smother 'em, if you wanna be bad
Slap honey on a young pancake
We know how to make that money
Jewels n' drugs, play that hustle
Smother 'em, if you wanna be bad
Ain't nothin' if it ain't family
We know how to make that money

Come and show me the gateway into your love
I feel like the money could never do it like the club
I feel like a diamond can never do it like a drug
And I want it so come on and take it with me so that I can hit it
I can admit it, I'm influenced by desire when I approach her
I try to provoke her by giving money and jewelry and accessories
Instead of the recipe with a legacy of taking her to another place when I get it
Hold up
Twista going in warp speed breaking atoms
Blowing O.G. has got me creating anti matter
Let her pop it and smoke on it with me now
I got her because she ready to party and then move to the club
Because you know the way I think is an anomaly
And I'ma be strange as Lady Gaga
Probably
A dollar be the business
But I'd rather be in an outer dimension when I be talking about jewels n' drugs

Just let me add a little bit of muscle, baby
Joint venture, we'll partner up until the shares are up
And I up your wages
On a private island, Dolo
One across the Cono
Them broads before me was locals
Through customs accustom your wardrobe, damn
Stamped passports where they all pass ports
Til the clocks fast forward
There'll be dark blue shores
Where they don't do chores
We just get chauffeured

In the country where the accents are grand
And they landin' on top of all the mansions

With no words on it

I got on two chains, but, no, I ain't Tity Boi
I'm dream chasin', but I ain't from Philly boy
Bitch bad, and she said that I can get it boy
This a hit and I'm a make a nigga feel it boy
My flow on range, my swag's insane
And my campaign on ten, I like the bitch
She down to fuck, but I'm really into her friend
House up on the hill, got it off of cocaine
Aventador Lamborghini, condo off of Biscayne
Bitch I'm in my lane, fresh as hell, no stains
Robert jeans with the stones, Giuseppe man's my chain
I'm different, I was built for this, my bitch only rock Tiffany
You rat, you'll sing a symphony and I'm back, city been missing me
My watch silly my clock ignorant and I'm the king of my city
I'm banned up and I ain't in a band
But my flow just like an instrument
Bass, feel that, yellow tape of the trizack
Hating is a disease, pussy where they do that?

L.A. Reid cut the check for me
King shit and you know what it is
Shawty smell like a pound of that loud, but a nigga look like a hundred mill
But I drive Ferrari, fuck the motherfuckin dealer
Pay 10 million for a mansion, that worth more than your opinion
I got racks all in my cargo pants
Standard clip with that hollow man, yo' bitch ass
If yo bitch bad, she get fucked fast, ain't no romance
My diamond dancing in 3D nigga
Like a bank strip when you see me, nigga
Your money wrong and my money long
And I'm playing with it like PE nigga
Real nigga no joke, don't think there nigga no ho
I got mini Mac-10 and a 100 round drum
In the carpet up under my car
And nigga I don't wanna smoke your weed, plain gas the only thing I smoke
And I gotta thank God for the niggas off Bankhead
Shawty, they taught me everything I know
Like how to whip it, cook it, cut it, deal it
Hand it to your partner let him flood through the city
Really, we bout that action, you try us and we blastin'
We turnt to the max that's a motherfucking fact
I'm a real nigga, fuck these rappers

Door up, doors down
When I'm in the club, bitch it's going down
Shawty think it fucked, hand down, hands up, pants down
Down, down, shawty fuckin head down
I see my phone blowing up, I know it's going down
Once I busted at the rapper, then it hit the town
Check the numbers in the city, boy it going down

This that dope boy academy, them three letters been after me, (Who?)
The F.B.I. ever catchin me, my family my witness a tragedy
Shorty open her legs up happily
I ball hard like an athlete
Young black nigga in a big white phantom
Nigga, I look like a referee nigga
They blowing the whistle they telling
I do the clam I'm chilling
This bitch turned up making rain
When I'm in the club you yellin
They talk about these Bentley's that I'm gettin on the daily
One feet in the game and one feet out, swear I barely made it
I'm a real nigga till the death of me
Never sing a song like a parakeet

I woke up in a new Bugatti
Tats all over my body
Gettin' real money, niggas still hatin' on me
Man y'all need a new hobby
Or they won't talk to me, what they gon' say?
I ball, you a waterboy, Bobby Boucher
On top, toupée, y'all niggas fruitcakes
I don't really play games but I keep 2 K's
Damn, Mr. Hood why you do 'em like that?
Pull up in the drop with the ceiling top back
Couple weeks old, ""Bugatti"" done went gold
You ain't even know, I deserve that plaque
We the best, runnin' every summer in fact
July 16th I'm bringin' the real back
Broward! Pussy

(This the remix!) I woke up in a new Bugatti

Ho' hold up, double M back in this bitch
Walk in the club with a MAC on my hip
Diamonds look like niggas snappin' a flick
Ballin' I blow fifty racks in the VIP
I back in the whip, Maybach with your bitch
A new Mussolini in back of the six
I'm shittin' on rappers, these rappers is sick
Cause my homies got whips that these rappers ain't get
Cause we crackin' them bricks and I package the zip
And I'm switchin' my flow, I spit crack in this bitch
And I been hit your ho, now she back on my dick
But I get to the dough and get back at your bitch
Like hollup, I woke up in Coon new Ferrari
With all my motherfuckin' jewelry on me
New Aston Martin plus a Rolls Royce
And a new Ferrari, that's a new Bugatti (I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!))

I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!)
I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!)
I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!)
I woke up in a new Bugatti

And it's paid for nigga
Got racks, stack 'em up like Lego nigga
I'm a motherfuckin' G, I don't play with no nigga
Multi-millionaire self-made ho nigga
H-U-S-T-L-E gang
For that, in God we trust, we bang
I'm the new John Gotti in a new Bugatti
I got a few young hotties wanna get shit poppin'
Right, put it in the light
Nigga got ice but it don't look right
If a nigga buy a brick and it don't cook right
I'll whip that shit for a rack, sit tight
I got a bag full of tools and some yay to move
And all I want is money, leave the fame to you
I graduated out of gladiator school
So all I know is go like I'm trained to do (Turn up!)
Right now, turn my Mazy pedal to the metal I'm ashin' out
I let the top down in my Phantom drop
Blowin', I'm high as an astronaut
When you see me, I'm cashin' out
Walked into Mercedes bought half the lot
You keep carrying on, you getting carried out
Cause I don’t take ass whoopins, just pass ‘em out
Is this worth getting blasted about?
No forreal, is it worth getting blasted about?

Money conversation
Get so high, I be scrapin'
Got my eyes like a Asian
In my ride, like I'm racin'
In the sky, like a plane
It's Gang or die
Ain't no lames up in my circle
Ain't no ho shit in my eyes
Throwin' money in the air
Poppin' bands and let it fly
Where I'm from, you come up short
Pull that thing and let it fly
You know me, blow so much dank, think I'm Marley
Got so much ink on my body
Brought so much drink to the party
I fell asleep and woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!)

I woke up in a new Bugatti (Remix!)
I woke up in a new Bugatti

Fresh, whips
Candy on that money dip
Five hundred, I'm hood rich
Put in work, did a hundred flips
Been about them mansions
Stunna island, we packin'
Rich gang, we uptown
Nigga hardbody and mackin'
Tool on that back, nigga
Money and that power
Mansion on that beach, nigga
Blood red Bugatti
Versace on my bitch, nigga
Blow a mil' like it's a dollar
Stunna'

I woke up in a new Bugatti (This the remix!)

Woke up with the crown nigga
Serving Bobby Brown nigga
Started from the bottom now it's Carter, Nino Brown nigga
Take my spot nigga never will
Now I know how 'melo feel
We both shooters from New York
But I shown nigga how the metal feel
Fidel Castro with them cuban links
With Mark Cuban where them Cubans link
Excuse My French nigga, no France
Hottest new niggas in ten years
Coke boy deal like ten M's
DJ Khaled up in there (I woke up in a new Bugatti!)

Flow hot as the Mojave, gimme that sloppy shit
All on my car stick, give her some hundreds she did
Like this, I'mma say this (I'mma say this)
Fuck it, I'll say it (Fuck it, I'll say it)
If you got good pussy you should always have your rent paid
Choke on some bands if I'm not mistaken
Edit up my outfit, fashion statement
This the school of hard knocks, graduation

(This the remix!) I woke up in a new Bugatti

I'm sick of y'all niggas all talkin' crazy
Hottest nigga spittin' and they can't debate it
I didn't really know 2Pac or Big
But know the beast within'll reincarnate 'em
Fuck underrated, I'm constipated
I'm shittin' on 'em, fuck toilet paper
You're now tuned into the fuckin' greatest
Ace Hood, congratulations
Say name one nigga that's rockin' with him
Flow like a hundred round choppa nigga
Made a way out of the jungle
And now they in trouble, I used to be humble as shit
Recently flooded my neck and my wrist
Tell all them critics to suck on the dick, nigga

T.I.,"Bitch! Put my dick in yo' face, put my gun in yo' purse
Put my work in yo pussy, bitch don’t cum on the work
Pass the weed to your slime, these niggas greener than lime
So many knots in my pockets, the bitches need a massage
I was born in the drought, I hope I die in yo' mouth
If you're a rat you should’ve died as a mouse
The weed louder than the opera house, 'til the fat lady sings
Drop codeine in my punch, I’m bout to take a swing
If niggas thinkin' I’m soft, I’ll knock yo' thinkin' cap off
I get blood out these pussies, I’m a stinky tampon
This for my niggas back home, I’m so New Orleans regardless
Got bitches fallin' like August could sell bullshit to a tourist
My bitch is badder than me, call that Adam & Eve
I do tricks on my skateboard, not up my sleeve
I kiss yo bitch on the neck, shoot your man in the head
Hit his mama address then send his parents his head
I play with pussy, not these niggas
Crucify these niggas
Kidnap 'em, call they boss, and ask 'em who gone buy these niggas
