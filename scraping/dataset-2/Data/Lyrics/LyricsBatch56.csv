Chris Young,"Hometown crowd, Friday night lights
Second string quarterback coming off the sidelines
One last play, hail Mary prayer
Holding their breath when he threw it in the air
Now cups are raising, flags are waving
He's on their shoulders, famous

Here's one for the underdogs
Let 'em hear you ya'll
Well hell yeah they might get knocked down
But everybody loves how they don't stay down for long
Pretty soon they're ten feet tall
From odds stacked, can't win, to the comeback kid
Yeah come on, here's one for the underdogs

Granddad's farm, handed down
Everybody said he'd run it in the ground
Spent four long years bailing that hay
Little by little got the whole loan paid
Hard work's paying off, you wouldn't believe
He's making small town history

Here's one for the underdogs
Let 'em hear you ya'll
Well hell yeah they might get knocked down
But everybody loves how they don't stay down for long
Pretty soon they're ten feet tall
From odds stacked, can't win, to the comeback kid

Chris Young,"Did you see the movie is over
I guess we missed the last half
Layin' here in this bed together
Me kissin' you, you kissin' me back
It's getting late can't you see
I should get up and leave
If I don't you, know where it's goin'

But you're givin' me that look, baby
That says you're up to no good maybe
And you're whispering into my neck
Leavin' thoughts inside my head
Well now since you put it that way
If I need to I'll go darlin'
But what if I stay
What if I stay

Here comes the sun through the window
Feels like we just got to sleep

But when we pull in her drive gonna turn you down quiet
I'll have one arm around her, one on the wheel

You set the mood, we'll dance in the front seat

I'll do the kissin'

Put nothing but thinking 'bout love in her head
With nothing but the glow of your light in the dark

And every mother's child is gonna spy

To kids from 1 to 92

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep

Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night

Full reverently upon their knee
And offered there in His presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense

When you see a lake you think picnic

In some ways well maybe you might
Scrub me down, dress me up all but no matter what
Remember I'm still a guy

When you see a priceless French painting
I see drunk, naked girls
You think that riding a wild bull sounds crazy
And I'd like to give it a whirl
Well love makes a man do some things he ain't proud of
And in a weak moment I might
Walk your sissy dog, hold your purse at the mall
But remember, I'm still a guy

I'll pour out my heart
Hold your hand in the car
Write a love song that makes you cry
Then turn right around knock some jerk to the ground
'Cause he copped a feel as you walked by

I can hear you now talking to your friends
Saying ""Yeah girls he's come a long way""
From dragging his knuckles and carrying a club
And building a fire in a cave
But when you say a backrub means only a backrub
Then you swat my hand when I try
Well, what can I say at the end of the day
Honey, I'm still a guy

Hold your hand in the car

Straw hat on the porch when you old perhaps
Wanna gather your thoughts, have a cold one
Brag, to your grandkids about how life is golden
So I will light a cigar in the corridor of the crib
Pictures on the wall of all the things that I did
All the money and fame, eight by tens
Of the whole Rat Pack inside of a big frame
Collidin' with big names that could've made your career stop
All that, and your man is still here, and I'm still hot
Wow, I need a moment y'all
See, I almost felt a tear drop

When was the last time you heard a real anthem?
Nas, the millionaire, the mansion
When was the last time you heard your boy Nas rhyme?
Never on schedule, but always on time

These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me

Oh, I'm that history, I'm that block
I'm that lifestyle, I'm that spot
I'm that kid by the number spot
That's my past that made me hot
Here's my life long anthem
Can't forget about you
(Can't forget about, can't forget about you)
(Can't forget about, can't forget about you)

Can't forget about the old school, Bam, Cas, Melle Mel, Flash
Rocksteady spinnin' on they back
Can't forget when the first rap Grammy went to Jazzy, Fresh Prince
Fat Boys broke up; rap hasn't been the same since
So irregular, how it messed you up
When Mr. T became a wrestler
Can't forget about Jordan's retirement
The shot Robert Horry to win the game in the finals, kid
Some things are forever, some things are not
It's the things we remember that gave the world shock
They stay in a place in your mind so snug
Like who the person was with whom you first make love

When was the last time you heard a real anthem?
Nas, the millionaire, the mansion
When was the last time you heard your boy Nas rhyme?
Never on schedule, but always on time

These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me

Oh, I'm that history, I'm that block
I'm that lifestyle, I'm that spot
I'm that kid by the number spot
That's my past that made me hot
Here's my life long anthem
Can't forget about you
(Can't forget about, can't forget about you)

Unforgettable, unsubmittable, I go by N now
Just one syllable; it's the end 'cause the game's tired
It's the same vibe Good Times had right after James died
That's why the gangsta rhymers ain't inspired
Heinous crimes help record sales more than creative lines
And I don't wanna keep bringing up the greater times
But I'm a dreamer, nostalgic with the state of mind
The past the past, enough of it, a'ight then
But nothing gives me chills like Douglas and Tyson
Or Mike when his talk was live
Or when he first did the moon walk on Motown 25

When was the last time you heard a real anthem?
Nas, the millionaire, the mansion
When was the last time you heard your boy Nas rhyme?
Never on schedule, but always on time

These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways

Wrestle in a tub of KY to get my day by
I like to celebrate, why? - cause I can vision
Collages and images of my lies with no regret to hate
So every breath I take, is all about the rules
It's hard for you to breathe like you at high altitude
So crack the Patron, it's on heathens, The God's back
Hard body, Mr. Jones never leaving

1995, eleven years from the day
I'm in the record shop with choices to make
""Illmatic"" on the top shelf, ""The Chronic"" on the left homie
Wanna cop both but only got a twenty on me
So fuck it, I stole both, spent the twenty on a dub sack
Ripped the package off ""Illmatic"" and bumped that
For my niggas it was too complex when Nas rhymed
I was the only Compton nigga with a ""New York State of Mind""
Inside the dope house bottlin' up sherm, bangin' The Firm
Dre was king then so I waited my turn
Fast forward, now I'm makin 'em burn
Ended my peers careers, hollered at Nas, a hard lesson was learned""
So I reconciled my differences like he did with Jigga
I stopped beefin' with niggas, cause I'm ""Ether"" to niggas
Comb the earth 'til there's no one left
""If I Ruled the World"" I summons all you weak rap niggas to death

Yo, the Jordans sportin'
Come off the dice game with a fortune walking, you a walking coffin'
The musket I tucked it, you bluff it I bust it
You're sideways talking, so I lay often
I wait patient, to duct tape hatin'
Fuck ass niggas, get bucked ass niggas
Pluck ashes - of Cuban cigars, you fooling with Nas
That's my name and I came with Rugers this time
And if I'm sane that ""Soul Plane"" movie's the bomb
Word to my mom's name tattooed to my arm
You can't revolve me, embalm me, calm me or harm me
Rob me or dodge these bullets I'm busting
See that's malarky you yappin'
I open up the tripod to put the gatling on, and I start clapping
Nasty man, from bagging grams and running from cops
To a mill' on the hand, a mill' on the watch, I'm fucking with Doc

It's just a real song
Feel me?

I heard motherfuckers saying they made Hov
Made Hov say, ""Okay, so make another Hov.""
Niggas wasn't playing they day role
So we parted ways like Ben and J-Lo
I should a been did it, but I been in a daze though
I put friends over business end of the day though
But when friends, business interests as they go
Ain't nothing left to say though
I guess we forgot what we came fo'
Should a stayed in food and beverage
Too much flossing
Too much Sam Rothstein
I ain't a bitch, but I gotta divorce them
Hov have to get the shallow shit up off him
And I ain't even want to be famous
Niggas is brainless to unnecessarily go through these changes
And I ain't even know how it came to this
Except that fame is
The worst drug known to man
It's stronger than heroin
When you could look in the mirror like, ""There I am""
And still not see what you've become
I know I'm guilty of it too, but not like them
You lost one

Lose one, let go to get one
Left one, lose some to win some (You lost one)
Sorry, I'm a champion
Sorry, I'm a champion
You lost one

I don't think it's meant to be, be
But she loves her work more than she does me
And honestly, at twenty-three
I would probably love my work more than I did she
So, B, ain't we?
It's me and her
'Cause what she prefers over me is work
And that's where we differ
So I have to give her
Free time even if it hurts
So breathe, mami, it's deserved
You've been put on this earth to be
All you can be, like the reserves
And me? My time in the army - it's served
So I have to allow she, her, time to serve
The time's now for her
In time she'll mature
And maybe we can be we again, like we were
Finally, my time's too short to share
And to ask her now, it ain't fair
So, yeah, she lost one

Left one, lose some to win some (You lost one)

My nephew died in the car I bought
So I'm under the belief it's partly my fault
Close my eyes and squeeze, try to block that thought
Place any burden on me, but please, not that, Lord
Time don't go back, it go forward
Can't run from the pain, go towards it
Some things can't be explained, what caused it?
Such a beautiful soul, so pure, shit
Gonna see you again, I'm sure of it
Till that time, little man, I'm nauseous
Your girlfriend's pregnant, the lord's gift
Almost lost my faith, that restored it
It's like having your life restarted
Can't wait for your child's life to be a part of it
So now I'm child-like waiting for a gift to return
When I lost you, I lost it

Tell me what'd you say that truly makes it real

Love stays strong when the fight gets old
Love is a shoulder to lean on, love is you

Love's like the water when the well runs dry
Quench my thirst, keep me alive
Just need one sip, baby, love is you
Love is you, love is you, love is you, love is you

Is it possible there's a kiss that's so divine?
Or am I just too fool? Is it all in my mind?
Is there something chemical? A scientist might say
Well, love must be drug to make me feel this way

'Cause love is my permission to be who I am
Knowing the business 'cause you understand
Freedom to breathe, oh baby, love is you

Love's like a kiss when the sun goes down
Holds me tight when no one's around
Love's what I wanna hold on to, love is you
Love is you, love is you, love is you, love is you
Love is you, love is you, love is you, love is you

Love is kind, it makes me stronger
I don't have to look no longer
You're the one I'd cling to, love is you

When the chips are down
Love will stick around
I'm so glad I found, love is you

What about the sacred vows?
How do lovers work it out?

Thank you for your lullaby
It makes love look so easy

A smile and some lingerie can make it right
And I know some fights Mr. Radio can't black away

I can't say it's simple being so into you, no, no
Some may say I'm crazy, I may say that's true

I can't think of nothing better than loving you
Far as I can see we'll be alright
But when life goes wrong love works it out, oh

Work it out, love
That's what we're gonna do
Life without you
That can be sad and blue

Work it out, love
I'm gonna stay with you
I can't think of nothing better
Than loving you

I walked the long road, I won't complain, no, no
I-I-I-I'll give it all up and you do the same, yeah
Call it 50/50, yeah, my love's for you

Staring at your feet
Wishing my steps were longer
So by your sides I could keep
Hold your hand much bigger
Never wanted mine to grow
So I could always fit perfect
Inside your palms just so

No one loves me just like you do
No one knows me just like you do
No one can compare to the way my eyes fit in yours

And I'll always be your joy

Laid me on your belly
Nights when mama wasn't home
Lightning made me shiver
And you never let me feel alone
I tried to match your breathing
Beating my little heart against yours
Perfect were the nights we were sleeping
I never want to end what we are

'Cause no one loves me just like you do
And no one knows me just like you do
No one can compare to the way my eyes fit in yours
You'll always be my father, oh, oh

And ask my love away from me

There's life and you're pally and it's too much to take

He was a hero and the towers were crashed

And together we're two

I'll be your strings and I won't let you fall
And together we'll find one more

Can I give you some bread and the peace of my world?
Look to my fingers, there's hope in my hands
Come to my pocket and I'll give what I can

And I'm reaching for you

I'll be your strings and I won't let you fall
And together we'll find one more

Then two can change the world
If one can make a difference
Then together we're so much more

There was a flood not long ago
It took my people and it tattered my soul

Stallions on both arms, rocks on both charms
My Dominican chick looking like Scarface sister
Red and curly and she wake me up early
Cause hustlers hit the block when police change shifts
New York, California different toilet, same shit
In Brooklyn I rock Timberlands
Still toast cinnamon
Been gangster way before he dropped many men
Liquor in my system, voice raspy who I sound like?
Don't ask me that's my nigga we classy
Him and Montega Jada our style superior to haters
You can catch me in the latest Marvin Gaters
Ralph Lauren suit tape it up fly cause I'm papered up
Why these niggas keep hating on my Phantom
I be out in Atlanta and body tapping I'm probably strapped
Toast it up niggas

No sunny sky's just really black
We live real down here, Lord let us live

We live real down here, Lord let us live

Gangsta rap is where I live just knock on the front door
Niggas stunt more than Jackie Chan
What the fuck them faggots saying?
Nothing when I walk in the club with the gat in hand
Take 'em back to '94 shooing out a Astro van
Banging was the blueprint money was the master plan
Duffel bag full of Grants and Franklins
Rob niggas take they money shoot straight to the bank then
Head to the barbershop to get chopped up
Hearing war stories who dead and who locked up
Who snitching, who pitching and who knocked up
Fuck niggas in Black Wall Street I trust
Black hoodies and black Asics standing on the pavement
Hustlers don't sleep nigga we work the grave shift
Fuck that long money nigga get paid quick
And don't save shit

Lord knows that status is badder

Put it on my face to remind me

I should of put down the mic when Rakim left Dre
No cleanup hitter so I was stranded on second base
I had to steal third motherfucker that's my word

Yesterday I saw a B-girl crying
I walked up and asked what's wrong
She told me that the radio's been playing the same song all day long
So I told her I got something you've been waiting for
I got something you've been waiting for

Yesterday I saw a B-girl crying, I walked up and asked what's wrong, she told me that
The radio's been playing the same song all day long
So get your glass lift it up in the toast position
We getting paper like John Travolta get it
Cause we focused with it we supposed to get it
You know me and my whole squad we so committed
We not the kids coolin' out on the sofa wit it
We about to dominate the globe like Oprah did it
We getting paper like John Travolta nigga
Well I'm a downtown shoota who that?
The crown ruler is back
He congruent to the shape of a mack
Look how I do it yo I'm takin' you back
This how you rise down to the foundation how sacred is that?
I'm from the number one place on the map
The generational gap with yet another sensational track
And we don't stress for nothing I just press the button
It's as simple as just makin' it hap
To all the frauds stop fakin' relax
And to the broads if you cakin'
Then clap then shake it without breakin' your back
I know the world been waitin' for that you been aching fa that
Cause what they playin' on the station is wack
And I'm a legend in the flesh that dress to impress
The best is that which I accept and nothing less

I got the everclear flow they mimosa wit it
We are the hope of the culture they posed to listen
And I'm posed to pivot like I'm a forward in the league, I'm Oden wit it
Yet don't owe them niggas nothin' but potent lyrics
But if you ain't gotta dance they revoke your spinnin'
So good rappers ain't eatin' they Olsen twinin'
But I'm so committed, they have grown familiar
With the counterfeit hitters they so so with it but they a Sosa with it.
They Mark McGuire with the writtin' I'm Rodriguez
On the road to riches this is the fork I'm hittin'
This is the trial and error era no co defendant
I push the seed every time like I'm Cody wit it
I said they one hit wonders pneumonia to us
I don't know you niggas hit the road my nigga

Where my grimey figures at? look lively addressing the captain
Show me where your first impression is at
And where your dedication to the true profession is at
How you laugh answer me what kind of question is that
I'll show you where my rare essence is at the adolescence of rap
The real muscle in the message of that
My name trouble I'm a blessin' to rap
And you can check my stats cause worldwide they attesting to that
So nigga listen you can probably learn a lesson perhaps
How I'm like bobby DeNiro Joe Pesc and them cats
Am I the unsung hero oh yes if you askin' anybody that's aware of the classics
They'll tell you I'm a legend in the flesh that dress to impress

Chip on my shoulder
Big enough to feed Cambodia
See, I never fit into they quotas
Sneakers wasn't fitting and my knees needed lotion
Long before I knew the significance of a comb
I roam like phone with no vocal reception
Immigrant parents had me feeling like a step-kid
And black Americans never did accept me
That's why I thrive so much, win and respect dig
I never fit in with them light skins
I felt the lighter they was the better that they life is
So I resented them and they resented me
Cheated on light-skinned Dominique when we was seventeen
I figured I'd hurt her, she'd evidently hurt me, 
And all women who had light features
See, I never let a light broad hurt me
That's why I strike first and the first cut's deep

Walk into my room thinking how to make moves
Ain't thinking like a student but how Ice-T do it
Light dudes have the girls looking there all year
It's not fair, the ones with the good hair
Couldn't adapt to naps, I wavecap they naps and slept on me
Man, I hate black
Skin tone, I wish I could take it back
Or rearrange my status, maybe if I was khaki
Associating light skin with classy
The menstrual show showed and me, that was not me

[Chorus]

They say black is beautiful
But ask them beautiful light girls 
If its black they attract to usually
What if Barack skin was all black, truthfully?
Would he be a candidate or just a black in community?
Because black dudes tend to lack unity
And them blacker girls ain't on the tube, usually
Right now, at 23, I ain't mad at them reds no more
But for long time I had gone cold
Blindfolded my own insecurity was holding me back to reds, 
I ain't know how to act
They would get the cold shoulder and know it was an act
A defense mechanism what I thought that I lacked
Confidence

I need you to stop treatin' me as if I'm simple or naive.
As if I don't know nothing bout the world.
I understand you think you protecting me, but I could use a little room to breathe
And the respect you give a woman not a girl
Here's the thing
I appreciate all the love
The constant catering kisses and hugs
But lately I'm wondering what you do it for
If the reason you act all over sweet is cause you want to keep me on a leash.
I have no choice but to show you the door.

If you want to cradle me like a little girl
And lock me down
I'm not your possession

And take me everywhere you go
And show me off to all your fancy friends
Well here's the thing
I really don't mind the clothes
I love a nice dress with some open toes
But a trophy I'm not, So baby think again
(Hey) and Here's the thing
You always wanna hold my hand
And say things to me like I'm the man So let me do what a man's suppose to do
Well here's the thing you can be the man all the while
Understanding I am not a child
You're a man for sure, but baby I'm grown too
Hey hey

Said you gotta respect me totally
Otherwise I'm goin' up and leave

Just kiss my cheek and when I leave move back

It's like a broken record, but I can't eject it,
Feels like it's on repeat.
I got a new confession
Loves my new obsession
My heart's talking to me
It said, boom boom boom

I say no, 
And my heart just goes
With no control
So I'm trying to flow with it.
I'm so gone
And It shouldn't have told me, 
Never should of told my heart.
I-I-I'm so-o-o-o in love
Never should have told my heart
I-I-I'm so-o-o-o in love

You know we court side till we get a six rings
We both on common ground it ain't a big thing
But when we come around they make it a big thing
Still on the block in that drop chicken box
They askin' what that is, is that a different from Watch?
When I'm in stunt mode I got to let the city watch
Oh it's the clear core jet to a chili spot

Just me and my boss
No worries at all

I just needed time,
To do what I had to do
Caught in the life,
I can't let it go

I won't ever know

When I'm alone in my room, sometimes I stare at the wall
Automatic weapons on the flo' but who can you call
My down bitch, one who live by the code
Put this music shit aside, gettin' it in on the road
Lotta quiet time, pink bottles of Rose
Exotic red-bottom sole body glitter in gold
Follwin' fundamentals, I'm followin' in a rental
I love a nasty girl who swallow what's on the menu
That money triple up when you get it out of state
Need a new safe 'cause I'm runnin' out of space

As my goals unfold right in front of me

You destroy the earth, make possibilities bleak
Your lies are your destruction
Your justice stinks
Your pride is maniacal
You are the bearer of grief
Your win is shallow
Your truth is oblique
Your patriotism is garbage
It rots and it reeks of death in the wind
The foul stench of men basking in their cruelty
Rejoicing in their sin
You give up and give over so easily to the darker side
Because of your pride
You risk all of humanity
You send my children to murder human beings
Families they do not yet know
People they have never seen
You send my children to war

But there is always a possibility for peace

There's so much more I want to discover, baby

If it's love, it'll last a lifetime
Deep in my heart, I know baby

Was in and out of love

Maybe we can find the time

All they see is motion
They never see the tears, they never feel the pain
They always think it's nothing
But it's something, such a shame
So caught up in the fantasy
Humanity has made a love story out of tragedy
But there is no romance in life that's on the ledge
And there's no one to talk you down
And tuck you in the bed
Lord, it's so ironic that it's funny
Of something for the books or the bars
To bob your head and nod
I recall, so many never ever thought you'd make it
So sad they were mistaken

This world ain't got but one
So give credit where it is due""

Mastered all the madness
Let the magic have his way
Let the power paint the day
Let the god have his say

So high when you look down
Just glance upon the beauty and the wonder to be found

The hospital needs a hospital
Now they mocking you
They say the flattery is sincere
I run like a n**** younger than me by ten years
Yeah, and that's my car talking
Old school running with the dogs barking
Hop out that b**** like I'm selling coffins
Weed so strong, I be seldom coughing
And I'm covered in Balmain

Selling that Parkay, life ain't no arcade

100 M's, hug and squeeze

Half of my bedroom is just glass, so
Every morning when I wake up
I wake up to the beautiful sun and the sky in my face.
Bad part is I'm afraid of the dark.
So night time isn't always sweet.

My favourite part of a relationship,
Is holding each other through the night.
Safety you know.
So the hardest part of breaking up for me
Is sleeping alone.
I wanna hear you breathe,
That quiet time is quality time to me.
When I left my last love,
I cried myself to sleep in the beginning

I told myself the morning won't be like the night time.

And after self-evaluation
I found I lost me in translation
See the girl with the broken heart
See the girl with the ugly scars
It’s not a girl with the brand new scarf, oh yeah

It’s the way love goes
It’ll take you through and it always brings you out
It won’t leave you stranded

I found I got a whole lot of patience

Take the rugged sunny days, the warm and rocky weather
Take the roads that I have walked along
Looking for tomorrow's time, peace of mind

As my life spills into yours changing with the hours
Filling up the world with time turning time to flowers
I can show you all the songs
That I never sang to one man before

You have climbed the hills with me to the mountain shelter
Taken off the days one by one
Setting them to breathe in the sun

All the willow winding paths leading up and outward

Took off your clothers, held a pose

(We are soldiers after all, down by honor we won't fall
After all, all, all, all, all....)

[E-40]
Look out peon, we might of lost the battle, but we won the war
I grab a bullet, travel, bodies hit the floor
Can't be scared of your shadow, you gotta have heart
Killas on my soil, will turn off the lights and park
Get out the car, unlock, fill out the chopper and let it chop
Walk off like nothing happened, give a fuck bout a cop
Touch you with the Blade, take off your toupee
Put my dirt in your glocks, sometimes I do my dark in the day
My momma didn't raise no sick, she raised a beast
And I can't rest til my enemies rest in peace
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
Run up on me, I'ma knock the hell outta why'all
My back against the ball, strappin' and jackin', I'm puttin' hands on 'em
One hitter, quitter, bob & weavin', karate stance on 'em
Dance on 'em, ran on 'em, and land on 'em
Put my brand on 'em, stand on 'em, because I can on 'em

Christ Church Pentecostal Choir,"The gates and doors were barred 
And all the windows fastened down 
I spent the night in sleeplessness 
And rose at every sound 
Half in hope of sorrow 
And half in fear the day 
Would find the soldiers breakin' through 
To drag us all away 
And just before the sunrise 
I heard something at the wall 
The gate began to rattle 
And a voice began to call 
I hurried to the window 
Looked down into the street 
Expecting swords and torches 
And the sound of soldiers' feet 

But there was no one there but Mary 
So I went down to let her in 
John stood there beside me 
As she told me where she'd been 
She said they've moved Him in the night 
And none of us know where 
The stone's been rolled away 
And now His body isn't there 

We both ran towards the garden 
Then John ran on ahead 
We found the stone and empty tomb 
Just the way that Mary said 
But the winding sheet they wrapped Him in 
Was just an empty shell 
And how or where they'd taken Him 
Was more than I could tell 

Oh something strange had happened there 
Just what I did not know 
John believed a miracle 
But I just turned to go 
Circumstance and speculation 
Couldn't lift me very high 
'Cause I'd seen them crucify Him 
Then I saw Him die 

Back inside the house again 
The guilt and anguish came 
Everything I'd promised Him 
Just added to my shame 
When at last it came to choices 
I denied I knew His name 
And even if He was alive 
It wouldn't be the same 

But suddenly the air was filled 
With a strange and sweet perfume 
Light that came from everywhere 
Drove shadows from the room 
And Jesus stood before me 
With His arms held open wide 
And I fell down on my knees 
And I just clung to Him and cried 

Then He raised me to my feet 
And as I looked into His eyes 
The love was shining out from Him 
Like sunlight from the skies 
Guilt in my confusion 
Disappeared in sweet release 
And every fear I ever had 
Just melted into peace 

He's alive yes He's alive 
Yes He's alive and I'm forgiven 
Heaven's gates are open wide 
He's alive yes He's alive 
Oh He's alive and I'm forgiven 
Heaven's gates are open wide 
He's alive He's alive 
Hallelujah He's alive 
He's alive and I'm forgiven 
Heaven's gates are open wide 
He's alive He's alive He's alive 
I believe it He's alive

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.

Christa Black Gifford,"The moon and stars they wept
The morning sun was dead
The Savior of the world was fallen
His body on the cross
His blood poured out for us
The weight of every curse upon Him

One final breath He gave
As Heaven looked away
The Son of God was laid in darkness
A battle in the grave
The war on death was waged
The power of hell forever broken

The ground began to shake
The stone was rolled away
His perfect love could not be overcome
Now death where is your sting
Our resurrected King has rendered you defeated

Forever, He is glorified
Forever, He is lifted high
Forever, He is risen
He is alive
He is alive

We sing hallelujah
We sing hallelujah
We sing hallelujah
The lamb has overcome

If there are words for Him, then I don't have them.
You see my brain has not yet reached the point.
Where it could form a thought that could adequately
describe the greatness of my God
And my lungs have not yet developed the ability to,
release a breathe with enough to agility to
breathe out the greatness of His love
And my voice, you see my voice is so inhibited
Restrained by human limits,
that's hard to even send the praise up
You see if there are words for Him,
I don't have them
My God, His grace is remarkable
Mercies are innumerable
Strength is impenetrable
He is honorable, accountable
Favorable, He's unsearchable yet knowable
Indefinable yet approachable
Indescribable yet personal
He is beyond comprehension
Further than imagination
Constant through generations
King of every nation
But if there are words for Him,
Then I don't have them.
You see my words are few
In trying to capture the one true God
Using my vocabulary would never do
But I use words as an expression,
An expression of worship to a Savior
A Savior who is both worthy and deserving of my praise
So I use words
My heart extols the Lord. Blesses His name forever.
He has won my heart, Captured my mind
And has bond them both together
He is defeated me in my rebellion
Conquered me in my sin
He has welcomed me into His presence
Completely invited me in
He has made Himself the object of my sight
Flooding me with mercies in the morning
Drowning me with grace in the night
But if there are words for Him,
Then I don't have them.
But what I do have is, good news
For my God knew that manmade words
Would never do, the words are just tools
That we use to point to the truth
So He sent His son Jesus Christ
As The Word, living proof
He is the image of the invisible God
The first born of all creation
For by Him all things were created
Giving nothingness formation
And by His words He sustains
In the power of His name
For He is before all things
And over all things He reigns
Holy is His name
So praise Him for His life
The way he preserved in strife
The humble son of God becoming the perfect sacrifice
Praise Him for His death (pause)
That He willingly stood in our place
That He lovingly endured the grave
That He battled our enemy
And on the third day rose in Victory
He is everything that was promised
Praised as the risen King
Lift your voice and sing
For one day He will return for us
And we will finally be united with our Savior
For eternity, eternity
So it's not just words that I proclaim
For my words point to The Word
And The Word has a name
Hope has a name
Joy has a name
Peace has a name
Love has a name
And that name is Jesus Christ
Praise His name forever",Forever (We Sing Hallelujah),2018

Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, walk this way
Ah, just give me a kiss

Like this
School girl sadie with the classy kinda sassy
Little skirt climbing way up her knees
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker
When I noticed they was lookin' at me

I was a high school loser, never made it with a lady
Till the boys told me something I missed
Then my next door neighbour with a daughter had a favour
Took me just a little kiss, like this

See-saw swingin' with the boys in the school
With your feet flyin' up in the air
Singin' hey diddle-diddle with the kitty in the middle
You be swingin' like you just didn't care

So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Was it me she was foolin'?
'Cause she knew what she was doin'
Told me how to walk this way
She told me to

Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, talk this way
Just give me a kiss
Like this",Walk This Way,

When them guns goes off, we be ready for war
When them guns goes off, bitches hit the floor
When them guns goes off, and them sirens roar
Better get that money, and be out the door

[W.C.]
Racket, racket, comin' out of the back end
Dead at you, he throwin' the hot lead at you
Swang affiliate, X.O. sip, a gold getter
With the rest to gather, my cold killer
It's ""Me Against the World"" like 2Pac
And like Biggie, I'm ""Ready to Die"" for what you got
Got a crew with killas behind me, I'm grimey
I'm one of the big body, blowin' cushions where you can find me
For figures, we bust triggers, who could fuck with us?
Dub, E-40, Christ Bearer, plus RZA
Stick you with the Blade, we gots to get paid
And for the moolah, we intertwine like French braids
And I can't fight the feeling like one way
When it comes down to this gangsta shit and gun play
For the loot, we compute it, quick to shoot it
So hit the switch, punk blew it, and bang the music

[Hook: P. Dot (The Reverend William Black)]
I don't care what it takes, we gon' make it
They say the chains too strong for us to break it
Willing to do what it takes for us to make it
And we can overcome anything we faced with
(We are soldiers after all, down by honor we won't fall
After all, all, all, all, all....)

[Christ Bearer]
When them guns go off, bitches hit the floor
Or then forty four slugs gonna hit you, ho
I don't care what it takes, I pull out a gear
Fuck the snakes, and Kurtis Blow with The Breaks off
Artie Murphy and the Petty Coat Junction
Get two thirty off the head with cold dumplings
Niggaz jump when the AK bark
Crystal grip pump, make the gun niggaz spark
You dig? Niggaz ready for war
Been carryin' the world for so long, it ain't heavy no more
And even when the sirens roar, I taught the violence gore to start firing more
And when we run out of bullets, and you still want static?
I grab the three eighty and pull out the automatic
We better get the money, for shootin' Mossbergs and Beretta's
Niggaz ain't shit funny, when it comes to a brawl
Suckin' Northstar, trippin' in
Guns go off, why'all know why'all strippin'

[Hook: P. Dot (The Reverend William Black)]

[E-40]
Look out peon, we might of lost the battle, but we won the war
I grab a bullet, travel, bodies hit the floor
Can't be scared of your shadow, you gotta have heart
Killas on my soil, will turn off the lights and park
Get out the car, unlock, fill out the chopper and let it chop
Walk off like nothing happened, give a fuck bout a cop
Touch you with the Blade, take off your toupee
Put my dirt in your glocks, sometimes I do my dark in the day
My momma didn't raise no sick, she raised a beast
And I can't rest til my enemies rest in peace
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
Run up on me, I'ma knock the hell outta why'all
My back against the ball, strappin' and jackin', I'm puttin' hands on 'em
One hitter, quitter, bob & weavin', karate stance on 'em
Dance on 'em, ran on 'em, and land on 'em
Put my brand on 'em, stand on 'em, because I can on 'em

After the end of the war I want to devote myself
To my thoughts for five to ten years and to writing them down
War has caused unrest among the younger generation
Induction then destruction, who wants to die?
Wars come and go what remains are only the values of culture

Then of course there is revolutionary love
Love of comrades fighting for the people and love of people
Not an abstract people but people one meets and works with
When Che Guevara taught of love being
At the center of revolutionary endeavor, he meant both

For people like Che or George Jackson or Malcolm X
Love was the prime mover of their struggle
That love cost them their lives, love coupled with a man's pride
Love coupled with a man's pride
Give it to you on top, now

War, I despise 'cause it means destruction of innocent lives
War, means tears to thousands of mothers how
When their sons go off to fight and lose their lives

Married to Marijuana with that drama you can miss me
Fifty-fifty I'm a playa, slash money maker by nature
I get that paper pushin' green and snowyflaka

But uh now this lil' ass baby smokin' on dank in The

And shit I'm thinkin' Lexus Limo
I'm a swang three lanes to the piece and chain
And the pinky ring I'm gonna blind
'cause it's my time, I pack my dime, I put two holes
Right in your spine

Boy I beat yo lil' behind
And stop and rewind, feel my lines 
Bottle like me, I'm gonna shine

But listen he gaining recognition
In the Expedition, it's gonna glistin'
Got a line and he went fishin'
Pay attention to the Louisiano recano regano with a
Blano, I be puffin' on a big Fano 
Got mo' green than the motherfucking lotto
Nigga I'm the one, the Christian 
The lucky motherfucker outside of the Yukon
I'm swangin' fo's, I'm slangin' hoes

Momma mad, 'cause I just just failed my piss test 
Brain deader than a door knob 
This is, for my road dog
Fresh out the Pen I take him out to get a blowjob
I'm so shy, controlling the streets, like a robot
The one to put a dope house 
I'm sorry but it won't stop
My door got kicked in once before
And I'm sho' they won't try that stupid shit no more

Noch nicht mal gedacht mann!
Für jeden deiner Schritte
Da gehe ich zwei
Ich zieh an deinem kleinen scheiß Leben
Locker vorbei

Ich fühl mich gut wenn andere sagen
Ich bin arrogant
Denn was ich will und erreiche
Das geht Hand in Hand
Es gibt nur einen wie mich
Und es ist schön dass es mich gibt
Ich bin wie alle anderen auch
Nur in mich verliebt

Es ist geil
Ein Arschloch zu sein!

Christian,"Looking out on the morning rain I used to feel uninspired
And when I knew I'd have face another day.
Lord, it made me feel so tired.
Before the day I met you
Life was so unkind.
Your love was the key to my peace of mind
'Cause you make me feel, you make me feel,
You make me feel like a natural woman.
When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it.
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helped me name it.
Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm livin' for,
'Cause if I make you happy I don't need to do more.
You make me feel, you make me feel,
You make me feel like a natural woman.
 
Oh, baby, what you've done to me
(What you've done to me')
You make me feel so good inside
(Good inside.)
And I just want to be

Well Baby Beesh, that's my handle, money mackin'
Commando, blowin' like a candle, on that pearl and
Wood panel, modern day Marlon Brando 
Squares don't understando
Play like a piano when I'm flipping through the
Channel, man don't make me lose convultions, chokin'
On some doja, cars keep flippin' over 
Getting' Jags and Testerosas
Motorola, Coca-Cola, stay high and never sober 
Got them hot girls makin' love to my poster
Attitude kinda flippy, pockets never skimpy 
Married to Marijuana with that drama you can miss me
Fifty-fifty I'm a playa, slash money maker by nature
I get that paper pushin' green and snowyflaka
Make a good girl turn to sinna 
Puttin' inches all up in her
Blaze the bitch up now she's a bread winner
I'm a gold digga, kick a hole through your front door
Nigga, don't try to fight it, give it up, let it go.

Follow my lead huh, do as I say not as I do. (x3)

Follow my lead huh, mayday mayday.  (x5)

[Second Verse]
I remember way back in the day
I used to get spankings from my momma
But uh now this lil' ass baby smokin' on dank in The
Bahamas, got a pair of Versace pajamas 
Little mommas say I'm a sex symbol
I come through with the blue Coug
And shit I'm thinkin' Lexus Limo
I'm a swang three lanes to the piece and chain
And the pinky ring I'm gonna blind
'cause it's my time, I pack my dime, I put two holes
Right in your spine
Every time you talkin' down my rhyme 
Boy I beat yo lil' behind
And stop and rewind, feel my lines 
Bottle like me, I'm gonna shine
Little Christian on a mission 
But listen he gaining recognition
In the Expedition, it's gonna glistin'
Got a line and he went fishin'
Pay attention to the Louisiano recano regano with a
Blano, I be puffin' on a big Fano 
Got mo' green than the motherfucking lotto
Nigga I'm the one, the Christian 
The lucky motherfucker outside of the Yukon
I'm swangin' fo's, I'm slangin' hoes 
Representing of the way Houston
These boys ain't ready for the age of Levy in a SS
Chevy on perely 
Nigga I be sippin' lean 
And I'm counting green
'cause boy I'm all about my feria (feria).

Chorus

[Third Verse]
I promise this song is harder than my dick is
I won in the Olympics for cooking the most chickens
Gold medal around my necka, living la vida chueca
Puck checka, chuck wrecka, nobody do it betta
I'm best when under presha, smoke up in my chest
Momma mad, 'cause I just just failed my piss test 
Brain deader than a door knob 
This is, for my road dog
Fresh out the Pen I take him out to get a blowjob
I'm so shy, controlling the streets, like a robot
The one to put a dope house 
I'm sorry but it won't stop
My door got kicked in once before
And I'm sho' they won't try that stupid shit no more
I put holes up in they asses 
Broke em' like some glasses
Niggas was falling just like my motherfuking pants is
Answers your questions, throwed as Mexicans
Snatch your bitch up and dig deep in her intestines.

Desnudemos el alma
Definamos nuestro amor,
Pues a pesar de ser muy mio
Te siento ajeno.
Dime porque te sientes así
Si yo creo que no he cambiado,
No miento al decir que te quiero.
Es mas lo que tardaste en decirlo
Que en saber mi corazón que no me amas.
Pero porque dices eso si siempre
Estoy contigo,
Why aún así me siento sola.
Pero nada te ha faltado
No tengas miedo,
Loque no tengo es amor,
Pero yo te quiero!
En el amor no existen peros
Cuando se ama de verdad
El corazón no siente miedo
Se entrega todo con pasión,
Son cosas del corazón
Sorpresas del destino,
Hay historias de amor
Que no tienen final.
Habia todo entre tu why yo
Pero nos faltaba algo,
Ah! Pasión.

Why should you spend your whole life living trapped where there ain't no future.

Christian Bautista,"No one ever saw me like you do
All the things that I could add up to
I never knew just what a smile was worth
But your eyes say everything without a single word

'Cause there's somethin' in the way you look at me
It's as if my heart knows you're the missing piece
You made me believe that there's nothing in this world I can't be
I never know what you see
But there's somethin' in the way you look at me

If I could freeze some moment in my mind
Be the second that you touch your lips to mine
I'd like to stop the clock, make time stand still
'Cause, baby, this is just the way I always want to feel

I don't know how or why I feel different in your eyes
All I know is it happens every time

And yet I'm still afraid to let it flow

I said there is no reason for my fear
'Cause I feel so secure when we're together
You give my life direction
You make everything so clear

And even as I wander
I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window
On a cold, dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might

And I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars forever

I've forgotten what I started fighting for

People saying that you're no good for me,
""Saw your lover with another and she's making a fool of you""

If you loved me baby you'd deny it,
But you laugh and tell me I should try it,
Tell me I'm a baby, and I don't understand

But you know that I'll forgive you,
Just this once, twice, forever,
'Cause baby, you could drag me to hell and back,
Just as long as we're together.
And you do

I don't want your freedom,
I don't want to play around,
I don't want nobody baby,
Part time love just brings me down.
I don't want your freedom,
Girl, all I want right now is you.

Like a prisoner who has his own key
But I can't escape until you love me
I just go from day to day knowing all about the other boys
You take my hand and tell me I'm a fool to give you all that I do
I bet you someday baby someone says the same to you
But you know that I'll forgive you

Christian Bertoncelli,"Se despertó a medianoche a mirar 
Si el reflejo del agua podía encontrar 
Aquella risa que un día mudó 
Y, por segunda piel, de soledad se vistió

Buscó respuesta en el aire
Mientras el mar le arropó
Pidió ayuda a su estrella
Que le abandonó
Pues olvidó llorar

Llorar es purgar la pena
Deshidratar todo el miedo que hay en ti
Es sudar la angustia que te llena
Es llover tristeza para poder ser feliz

Cierra los ojos, abre el corazón
Y aprende a ver con los ojos del alma ella oyó 
Le hablaba el viento, le hablaba una flor
Con la cadencia que tiene un susurro de amor 

Deja salir los fantasmas 
Que amargan besos y dan
A cambio de tus silencios
Acopio de ansiedad
Mutilada paz

Llorar es purgar la pena
Deshidratar todo el miedo que hay en ti
Es sudar la angustia que te llena
Es llover tristeza para poder ser feliz

Llorar es purgar la pena
Deshidratar todo el miedo que hay en ti
Es sudar la angustia que te llena
¡escucha, soy gaia! 
¡no castres tu rabia! 
¡que tu alma escupa el dolor! 

Que llueva tristeza al llorar
Y que sacie la amargura su sed
Las lágrimas son el jabón 
Que limpia de penas tu piel

Deshidratar todo el miedo que hay en ti
Es sudar la angustia que te llena

So sad they've had to fade it

Adieu mes beaux rivages
Souvenir de l'été
Qui se meurt
Mes soleils envolés
Et mes plages sauvages

Adieu rives lointaines
Où le soir descendait triste et beau,
Adieu vertes vallées
Et vous claires fontaines
Adieu

Pays des oiseaux !
Un train noir m'emporte dans la nuit

Un train m'emporte sous la pluie
Et devant cette fleur fanée
Je revois mes belles journées

Adieu mes amourettes
Vos baisers vont poursuivre mon cœur,
Au pays de la pluie
Vous seriez bien seulette,

Christian Chevallier,"Un jour mon père me dit: fiston
J'te vois sortir le soir
A ton âge il y a des choses
Qu'un garçon doit savoir
Les filles, tu sais, méfie-toi
C'est pas c'que tu crois

Elles sont toutes
Belles belles belles comme le jour
Belles belles belles comme l'amour

Elles te rendront fou de joie
Fou de douleur mais crois-moi
Mais plus fou d'elles de jour en jour
Puis des filles de plus en plus
Tu vas en rencontrer
Peut-être même qu'un soir
Tu oublieras de rentrer
Plus t'en verras, plus t'en auras
Et plus tu comprendras
Dans ces moments, tu te souviendras
Que ton vieux père disait:

Elles sont toutes
Belles belles belles comme le jour
Belles belles belles comme l'amour

Elles te rendront fou de joie
Fou de douleur mais crois-moi
Plus fou d'elles d'elles, d'elles de jour en jour
Un jour enfin tu la verras
Tu n'peux pas te tromper
Tu voudras lui dire ""je t'aime""
Mais tu n'pourras plus parler
En un clin d'œil vous s'rez unis
Pour le pire et le meilleur
Mais tu tiendras là le vrai bonheur
Aux yeux de ton cœur

Elle sera
Belle belle belle comme le jour
Belle belle belle comme l'amour

Comme j'ai dit à ta maman
Tu lui diras en l'embrassant:

Tu es, belle belle belle comme le jour
Belle belle belle comme l'amour

I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing

Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

And hello from the outside (outside)

Se mudo el amor que un día 
Me juraste pero todo fue mentira

Hoy me despido sin querer decir adiós
Vete despacio para no sentir tus pasos
Vete en silencio para no escuchar tu voz

Enfrentarme a la vida sin ti

Llévate mi vida entera
No sé ni a donde irás
Pero entiendo que tendrás que partir
Y ahora que te vas
Recuerda que el amor espera
Y aunque no vuelvas más
Prometo no olvidarme de ti
Como olvidarme de ti

No duermo solo me acompaña tu retrato
Y en las mañanas suelo reclamarle a Dios
Que ya no insista en arrancarte de mis brazos
Ya no podría soportar tanto dolor

No te niego que siento miedo

Ripping, hiding calling dumbly

You, in gutter sleep-love
You, born to slaughter-swathed gloves
You dressing daughters and sons

Weeping, prying, struggling blindly

I'm burning books from you
I'm lost in bed with you

Gone are the golden dreams with summer roses
And all our tenderest vows were made, but to be broken

Song of songs, song of memory
And broken melody of love and life
Nevermore for me can that melody
Fill the heart with the joy once we knew

His wife is dead, she doesn't see

Arms reaching back to face the face

To the ground, to the ground
Word dancers shout the dead language of thieves
""Dreams are omission, they fall deliberately""

They fall deliberately
They fall deliberately
They fall deliberately
They fall deliberately

Let the sky scream 'Suffocation'
If you can't move, you can't breathe
Breathe, breathe
Voices raised to emptiness

Arms reaching back to face
The face, the face, the face
You're just a face
You're just a face

Not me, dead girl
Dressed in white
This is not healthy
I, sanitation sin
It could be you, you, you
It could be you
It could be you

To face to face to face

If you're already there

Christian Death,"Sunday is gloomy, my hours are slumberless
Dearest the shadows I live with are numberless
Little white flowers will never awaken you
Not where the dark coach of sorrow has taken you
Sunday is gloomy on shadows, I spend it all
My heart and I have decided to end it all
Soon there'll be candles and prayers that are sad I know
Let them not weep, let them know that I'm glad to go
Angels have no thought of ever returning you
Would they be angry if I thought of joining you

Death is no dream for in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you

Christian Death,"He shut up like a rose, the scar of my belly
How I wanted him to rise up with the clouds
How I asked for love, received the wounds on cheek,
The nights empty sleep,
Hopeless words I can't keep

He searched just like a magnet, Oh the metal is me
How I needed him to draw it in, protect me from belief
How I pleaded then to end again, heal my rotting skin,
Pleaded then, asked for sin,
Something I can keep

Soul of my soul, do you feel me?
Touch the beating, heart of my heart
Flesh of my flesh
Mouth of my mouth
Soul of my soul, do you feel me?
Touch the beating, heart of my heart

He shuned me like disease, the feathers in my eyes
How I need his light to purify the darkness deep inside
How I asked for warmth, received snow and sleet,
The burns on my feet,
White and unsoiled sheets

He reached for all desire, kept his hands far from me
How my mind built high could rectify such pain and deceit
How the sorrow plunged, concrete and ashen weeps
The porous bed it reeks with unresolved peeks

Soul of my soul, do you feel me?
Touch the beating, heart of my heart

Old hearts break down
Footsteps tied 'till believing
Can we hold sand?
Slow hands break up the family

We hide from cold still-lives on empty floors
We hide our bent husbands behind slamming doors

That's drowning me, so

Then he said, ain't you been listening?
It's never gonna work out
And I think it'd be a good time now to

Let me go
You don't need me baby
Stop holding on the way you are
Don't you know I'm no good for you
And it'll only break your heart
If you don't
Let me go

He said other than a dreamer
I ain't nothin' but a drifter
You could do a lot better
Then leaned over and he kissed her
He said you got another year of college
And a good momma and a daddy
And me, I got $93 in this old '82 Chevy

So let me go
You don't need me baby
Stop holding on the way you are
Don't you know I'm no good for you
And it'll only break your heart
If you don't
Let me go

She said, nice try
But you can't hide behind those shades there on your face
Ya see I don't think you're all that tough
I just think you're scared of love
And I think I won't take up that much space

(So)Let me go
Take me with you baby
It's so cold outside your arms/I belong where you are (DEPENDING ON SONG VERSION)
We both know that you're not as strong as you think you are

So let me go
Take me with you baby
I belong where you are
Don't you know I'm so good for you
And it'll only break your heart
Down the road
If you don't
Let me go
With you baby

Let me go
With you baby
Just let me go",Let Me Go,2010

Good intentions, better alibis
No happy endings, no straight lines, no movin' on,
But no goodbyes.
This bittersweet revelry will be the death of me.

One more graceful spin on who's right or wrong

And it can't get much better and it sure can't get worse
Well either way you turn, it's gonna hurt.

Minding my own business

Anybody sitting here
Started taking off her glasses and letting down her hair
I said thank you for the drink ma'am
How'd you know my brand?
She said there's certain things a woman can tell about a man

Shaking on the stool
I moved a little closer
And I tried to play it cool

I order us a double
And chased it with a beer

The early haze of the seventies sun kept the fevers gone
Curious, placid, green
Now she's a well faring maiden, a brunette of the dream
But those where the days, so much like today
And that was the difference indifference makes

Allelujah.
Summers past all feel as one but dismaled by a move
For reasons I did not understand, but for a new school
And if ever you have fought to hold tears infesting eyes
As you realize a friend is not
But those where the days, so much like today
You say drugs and woman but game is still game

Allelujah.
The old house repainted now but still stuck on that street
Children melt in topaz light of faded memory
No matter how it ends cherish these moments
Of solace found in friends
For these are your days continue your play
For you know not the next time you will meet
Someone who knows you best to date and who loves you all the same

Christian McBride,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Lullaby of Birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",Lullaby of Birdland,1997
Christian McBride,"Who cares if the sky cares
To fall in the sea?
Who cares what banks fail in Yonkers,
Long as you've got a kiss that conquers?

Why should I care?
Life is one long jubilee,
So long as I care for you
And you care for me!",Who Cares?,1997
Christian McBride,"I thirst but never quench
I know the consequence, feeling as I do
We're in a spinning top
where, tell me, will it stop
and what am I to say
Open our music book, that only few can look
and I'll write a song for you

Love is a symphony, hearts in one melody
'Cause I write a song for you
Sounds never dissipate, they only recreate
in another place
There in your silent night
joy of a song's delight
I write a song for you
You write a song for me
We write a song for love

My magical mystique, finding it all complete
in a lovely face, feeling we try to chase
memories that won't erase, stay forever new
We have a magic box in which is never locked",I'll Write a Song for You,1998
Christian McBride,"Sitting in a railway station with my suitcase in my hand
Going back where I came from, I've had more than I can stand
Of watching men destroy my dreams 
They picked my brain till it was clean

When I was up they knocked me down
I ain't going to hand around, I'm going home
I'm going home, going home
Tell someone to meet me I'm coming home

Came to this old town seeking fortune and some fame
Never got the chance to prove myself, though I tried to play their game
But using people just ain't my thing
And I don't dangle from any string
To please some fool that don't care about
They turned me inside out, I'm going home

I'm going home, going home

Tell someone to meet me I'm coming home
Tell someone to meet me I'm coming home
I'm going home, going home
Tell someone to meet me I'm coming home

Christian McBride,"All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow

It's worth its heartache in ransom
Now when that twilight steals
I know how the lady in the harbor feels
When I want rain, I get sunny weather

Since love has gone, I can't get myself together
Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry
My friend ask me out, but I tell them I'm busy
I've got to get a new alibi
I hang around at home, and ask myself, where is she?
Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry
Dry little tear drops, my little tear drops
Moving on a stream of dreams
My little memories, those precious memories
Remind me of our crazy schemes
Then somebody says, just forget about her
But I gave that treatment a try
Strangely enough, I got along without her
Then one day she passed me right by, oh well

I never got a chance to see him; never heard nothin' but bad things about him.
Mama I'm depending on you to tell me the truth.

Hey, Mama, is it true what the say, that Papa never worked a day in his life?
And Mama, they talk all around town say that 
Papa had three outside children and another wife 
And that ain't right.
Heard them talkin' about Papa doing some storefront preachin'
Talkin' about saving your souls and all the time weak, dealin' in death
And stealin' in the name of the Lord

Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone.""

Hey, Mama, I heard Papa call himself a jack of all trades.
Tell me, is that what sent Papa to an early grave?
Folks say Papa would beg; borrow or steal to pay his bills.
Hey, Mama, folks say Papa was never much on thinkin';
Spend most of his time chasin' women and drinkin'!

Christian McBride,"Ask me how do I feel,
Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!

From the moment we kissed goodnight,
That's the way I just gotta behave,
And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

And if I were a watch,
I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Or if I were a season,
I'd surely be Spring,

Christian McBride,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players

Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

De un botón a todo lo demás 
No pusimos reglas ni reloj
Aquí estamos solos tú y yo 
Todo lo que ves es lo que soy
No me pidas más de lo que doy

Si estaremos juntos, si se acaba el mundo 
Yo no sé si soy para ti, si serás para mí

Cada página es un día vivido 
No debemos de correr antes de andar 
Esta noche estamos vivos 
Solo este momento es realidad

From across the sea
It lingered there to touch your hair 
And walk with me

All summer long
We sang a song
And then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts
And the summer wind 

Like painted kites, those days and nights
They went flying by
The world was new
Beneath the blue
Umbrella sky 

Then softer than
The piper man
One day, it called to you
I lost you to

And the winter wind
They have come and they have gone
And still the days
Those lonely days
Go on and on

To nights that never end?

Watchin' the OG's in the hood while they flossin' in they rides
Candy paint, chrome wheels, and black magic on the attire
Me, yeah I was lovin' it, but not old enough drive
Parkin' lot pimpin' from the passenger side
I use to walk everywhere I had to show up
Shoe hills, one down like wheel rubber, man I was about to go nuts
Hopefully I would blow up in these rap game man
My people roll swanga's, I wanted to be rollin' the same thang
Never had alot of work, but I was doin' what I could
Movin' nickles, dimes, twenty's, and ounces all threw my hood
Since I had a one yolla fines cash me up
Mean while thumpin' for a ride my homies pass me up
It's all gravy, when I'm able I'm a showin' all somthin'
From a hopte to a foreign, I'm ballin' it's all or nothin'
Treat my feet with' designer to fine sneak's when I leave my home
Only place you catch me walkin' is to my mail box's
Cause on the streets I be on crome

I'll keep rollin' chrome
I'll keep rollin' chrome
Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on
I'll keep rollin' chrome

Huh, I started off with' a canary yellow cutlass supreme on bald tire's
Yeah I know I was out of line
But that was all I could find
Or should I say that was all I could purchase for what I had to spend
But at least I had somthin' to go from point A to B and
No more offerin' gas money to get a lift
Besides when your driven it's easyer to get a chick
So ani't no more parkin' lot pimpin' at the club I'm up in there
Seekin' little mama, with' thick thighs, I hope she let me in there
Like swim wear, pull up to the motel, and we'll go in there
Nothin' left to do but comit a sin there
And that was in my hopte, but when I show up in my big body with' the gloss
All of the boppers was boppin' I just could'nt shake'm off
Sixteen switches, tewnty-two inches, trunk goin' to war
They don't want to lay here with me, they want to lay in my car
I was lovin' it back then and still love it today
Except I'm not yellow cutlase no more, I'm 300 blue over gray, on chrome

I'll keep rollin' chrome
I'll keep rollin' chrome
Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on
I'll keep rolin chrome

Finally I'm in the mix, ridin' twenty four's or twenty six
My neck and my wrist lite, with' out me sellin' a brick
Tv's in the roof and the dashboard and I'm watchin' a flick
Rollin' with my pistol in my lap and I'm cockin' if
I spy somethin' suspicious in my rear view mirror when I'm creepin'
If you plan on jackin' me I plan on leavin' you sleepin'
I be in different vehicle cause I'm havin' thangs
King of the ghetto entertainment got me havin' change
You can smell it on me, even tho quite, the way I live it be tellin' on me
Don't get twisted I'm still a felon homie
Thinkin' you goin' to rob me that's a N O
And when I'm in N O I roll with god and as always Mr.Marsello
And they be with me when they in Texas don't par take it as a spy
Harlum nights in stores where they drop it like it's hot
So if your tryin' to call me and I don't answer my phone
I can't hear it cause my music to loud I'm bangin' on chrome

I'll keep rollin' chrome (rollin chrome)
I'll keep rollin' chrome (rollin chrome)
Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on (holdin' on)
I'll keep rolin chrome (yaah)
I'll keep rollin' chrome (yes I am)
I'll keep rollin' chrome (I'm rollin chrome)

The cause for the fighting has long been a ghost
Malice and habit have now won the day
The honours we fought for are lost in the fray

Standards and bugles are trod in the dust
Wounds have burst open, and corridors rust
Once proud and truthful, now humbled and bent
Fires which burnt brightly, now energies spent

Let down the curtain, and exit the play
The crowds have gone home and the cast sailed away
Our flowers and feathers as scarring as weapons
Our poems and letters have turned to deceptions

People call me poker-face and that's my name
Put your money down, we're playing for high stakes
I don't care which game you choose
I don't mind 'cos you will lose
But before we start to play
There's one thing I wanna say",Put Your Money Down,1970
Christie,"I've been all around this great big world
to Paris and Rome
And I've never found a place that I could
really call my own.
But there'se one place where I know
the sun is shining endlessly
And it's calling me across the sea
so I must get back to SAN BERNADINO.

I remember when I was sixteen
my daddy said to me: You could travel
round this universe until eternity
But you'll never find that peace of mind
that you've been dreaming of.
Not until you finally decide to
come on home to SAN BERNADINO.

Oh
I'm longing for SAN BERNADINO!
Oh
I'm longing for SAN BERNADINO!

I've been all along the water right up
to the Rio Grande
And I've never found the paradise
they call the Promised Land.
I was young and foolishly I thought
the world was at my feet.
But I'm no diff'rent now and so I'm
homeward bound for SAN BERNADINO.
Well I'm older and I'm wiser and I've seen
the light of day
and I think it's time
to realize my dreams have gone astray.
But I've tried so hard to rech that star
that was so far away.
But now I've got to find that road
that's leading home to SAN BERNADINO.

Oh
I'm longing for...",San Bernadino,1970
Christie,"So long boy you can take my place, got my papers I've got my pay
So pack my bags and I'll be on my way to yellow river

Put my guns down the war is won
Fill my glass high the time has come
I'm going back to the place that I love yellow river

Yellow river, yellow river is in my mind and in my eyes
Yellow river, yellow river is in my blood, it's the place I love
Got no time for explanations, got no time to lose
Tomorrow night you'll find me
Sleeping underneath the moon at yellow river

Cannon fire lingers in my mind, I'm so glad that I'm still alive
And I've been gone for such a long time from yellow river

I remember the nights were cool I can still see the water pool
And I remember the girl that I knew from yellow river

Christie,"[Chorus]
If you don't know me by now 
You'll never, never, never know me 
All the things that we've been through 
You should understand me 
Like I understand you 

Now baby I know the difference 
Between right and wrong 
I ain't gonna do nothin' 
To upset our happy home 

Oh, don't get so excited 
When I comee home a little late at night 
Cause we only act like children 
When we argue, fuss and fight 

[Chorus] 

We all got our own funny moods 
I've got mine 
Woman, you got yours too 
Just trust in me 

Like I trust in you 
As long as we've been together 
That should be so easy to do 
Just get yourself together 

Or we might as well say good-bye 
What good is a love affair 
When we can't see eye-to-eye

Christie Brothers Stompers,"Love, oh love, oh careless love
You've fly through my head like wine
You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl
And you nearly spoiled this life of mine

Love, oh love, oh careless love
In your clutches of desire
You've made me break a many true vow
Then you set my very soul on fire

Love, oh love, oh careless love
All my happiness bereft
You've filled my heart with weary old blues
Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Trusted you now, it's too late
You've made me throw my old friend down
That's why I sing this song of hate

For my sins, till judgment I'll atone",Careless Love,2002

Christie Front Drive,"I guess I should have written Dad to let you know that I was coming home
But I've been gone so many years I didn't realize you had a phone
I saw your cattle comin' in and boy they're looking mighty fine and sleek
I saw Fred at the service station he told me that his wife was awfuly sick
You heard my record on the radio oh well it's just another song
Got a hit recorded and it'll be out on the market 'fore too long
I got this ring in Mexico you know it didn't cost me quite a bunch

When you're in the business that I'm in the people call it puttin' up a front
I know I've lost a little weight and I guess I'm looking kinda pale
If you didn't know me better Dad you'd think that I've just gotten out of jail
No we don't call 'em beer joints night clubs are the places where I work
You meet a lotta people there and no there ain't much chance of gettin' hurt
I'm sorry that I couldn't be here with you all when my Mama passed away
I was on the road and when they came and told me know it was just too late

I drove by the grave to see her boy that really is a pretty stone
I'm glad that Fred and Jan are here it's better than you being here alone
I know you're gonna ask me who the lady is that's sleepin' in my car
That's just the girl that works for me and man she plays a mighty fine guitar
We worked in San Antone last night she didn't even had the time to dress
She drove me down from Nashville and to tell the truth I guess she needs the rest

Well Dad I gotta go we got a dance to work in Cedargrove tonight
Lemme ride your number down I'll call you and I promise you I'll write
Now you be good and don't be chasin' all them pretty women that you know

And see my tears run down the window pane.
I sit and watch the sky,
And I can hear it heave a sigh.

I think of him,
How we were.
And when I think of him, 
Then I remember,

Remember.
In his Eyes I can see
Where my heart longs to be.
In his eyes 

I see a gentle glow.
And that's where I'll be safe,
I know.
Will his reveil to me?

Promises or lies?
But he can't comceal from me
The love in his eyes.

His eyes

Christie McCarthy,"What's your favorite holiday my angel wants to know 
Is it Christmas morning or Easter day, I say no it ain't any of those
It ain't the halo of lights round my town, birthday cake ribbons or bows
No, my favorite holiday is when angels holding me close
And what's your favorite book to read my angel wants to know
Is it Atlas Shrugged or Confederacy I say no it ain't any of those
Now the seers and sages of pages and pages carry my consummate load
But my favorite book to read is angels beautiful soul
And what's your favorite song to sing my angel wants to know
Is it one of your own or another you glean, I say no it ain't any of those
there's nothing like writing those lines down to sound, innocent words become poem
But my favorite words to sing are angel, hello 
Now all of these questions, one single answer this could get very old
But the way that I figure it we got a holy fit, blood, muscle and bone
Life isn't always so perfect and polished and I got my own lumps to show
But the day that I don't thank the stars for my angel bury me far below
Better bury me cause what I know
Kingdoms will rise and fall, nothing remains but the true love of angel",Angel,2003
Christie McCarthy,"Seems a shame to leave you here the day so soft and warm
The sun comes through the restless leaves and rolls across the lawn
I finally see the difference now between myself and you
And darlin' it just breaks my heart in two
And so I reach for you baby on this day of remembrance and rhyme
Take these words that I'm singing, turn em into a raised glass of wine
You know I ain't much for ritual but this one makes me cry
So, happy anniversary and goodbye
I hear tell of moving on and somehow it sounds right
Still I long to kiss away the tears from your eyes
And talk about old memories, honey one at a time
Anything to warm this cold, dark heart of mine",Anniversary,2003
Christie McCarthy,"My friends tell me that the use of a life plan
Like a blanket you can wrap yourself inside of
Is to pick you up when you don't really want to stand 
And explain away the things that you cannot comprehend

Sometimes you rise, sometimes you fall
Vulnerable like a baby in a cradle
If you could be anything at all what would you be
Find what you seek by the grace of vulnerability

Late at night with the thoughts racing in my head
If I don't get some sleep tomorrow I'll be useless
Most of the time my worrying gets me nowhere
And hangs on the vine so long that it's fruitless 

Sometimes you rise, sometimes you fall
Vulnerable like a baby in a cradle
If you could be anything at all what would you be
Find what you seek by the grace of vulnerability

And while you're on the road of life keep your love alive

Find what you seek by the grace of vulnerability",Vulnerable,2003
Christie Winn,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2011

Ich weiß es geht Dir ganz genauso
was hast du mit mir gemacht? 
Du und ich gemeinsam!

Engel fliegen einsam du und ich gemeinsam.
Engel fliegen einsam, niemals mehr allein sein.
Dann bin ich aufgewacht (Dann bin ich auf gewacht)
Und habe mich gefragt (Und habe mich gefragt)
Bist du auch so allein? (Bist du auch so allein?)
Und muss das wirklich sein?

Christina,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again
Seems like pretending it isn't the ending
Two friends drifting apart
Two friends, but one broken heart
We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died",Just Friends,2000

Blessed for everything you've given me,
Blessed for all the tenderness you show,
Do my best with every breath that's in me,
Blessed to make sure you never go.

There are times  that I test your faith, 'til you think you might surrender.
Baby I'm, I'm not ashamed to say, that my hopes will grow in splendor

You walked by in the nick of time
looking like an answered prayer
You know I'm truly

Blessed for everything you've given me,
Blessed for all the tenderness you show,
Do my best with every breath that's in me,
Blessed to make sure you never go.

Blessed with love and understanding,
Blessed when I hear you call my name,
Do my best with faith that's never-ending,
Blessed to make sure you feel the same.

Was it something I let slip
Does the whole world know
Isn't it obvious?

Do my feelings show?
Is my face aglow?
Isn't it obvious?

That I don't know what I'm doing anymore
I'm feeling like a little girl
Caught up in emotions
I'm out of control
Isn't it obvious?

Do you see my hands  they tremble
Wonder why I can't look you in the eyes
Don't know how long
I can keep this inside
Isn't it obvious?

That I don't know what I'm doing anymore
I'm feeling like a little girl
Caught up in emotions
I'm out of control
Isn't it obvious?

Suddenly these emotions are in control of my heart
Can you see it in my eyes
Every glance, every smile

And I feel so much I can't hide

I'm feeling like a little girl
Caught up in emotions
I'm out of control
Isn't it obvious?",Obvious,1999
Christina Aguilera,"It's either black or white that's right
We're making love or in a fight
Sometimes you make me so blue

But then it feels so good  I knew it would
You know the way to make me crazy
I want to give it to you

You make me feel so emotional
I can't let go I'm so emotional
I'm sinking deep into an ocean full of you
I'm so emotional

You take me high and low  you know
I'm never sure which way you're gonna go
You're such a mystery to me

But baby hot or cold, you got a hold
Of my imagination
I think you know what i mean

You make me feel so emotional
I can't let go I'm so emotional
I'm sinking deep into an ocean full of you
I'm so emotional

Rain is falling down on me
Suddenly the sun comes out
Sometimes north or south of love
But never out.",So Emotional,1999

Wish I had somebody

I want someone that I can hold 

Want someone wanting me

Who loves me 

Spending all of my time 
Spending all my time on me 
Where is that someone who 
I can give my time to 

Searching for that lover 
With the love that will change my life 
I want two arms to hold me close 
I want the thing I need most 

Somebody needing me 
So I can feel how it feels to be

What I'm looking for 
Is someone to love me more 
Than I've been loved before

What I need to find 
Is someone to hold me tight 
What I mean is i want to be

And I've never seen most of the world
I don't know diving out of the sky
Or living like diamonds and pearls

See I haven't danced to a musical tune
And I haven't noticed the flowers in bloom
I haven't smiled when alone in my room very much
Then we touched

I just know when you put your hands on me
I feel sexy and my body turns to gold
I just know when you put your hands on me
I feel ready and I lose my self control

I don't know if a doll can unwind
Or how to make a person go
I don't know how to be what you like
And simply open up the depths of my soul

So I keep my wings and my eyes on the down
Ready for nothing but holding my ground
I haven't used a particular noun very much
Then we touched

I feel sexy and my body turns to gold
I just know when you put your hands on me
I feel ready and I lose my self control

That I could speak to
A dream that I could call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known well

Safe at last
We can breathe a sigh
Seems the storm has passed

Through it all
No one knew
That all the tears in heaven
Would bring me back to you

No one I know
Imagined we would make it
But it only made us glad we both believed

You and me, we're a miracle

Meant to be and nothing can change it
Mountains move and oceans part
When they are standing in our way
You and me, we're a miracle
Angels stand watching over us
And heaven shines upon us every day

Every time I felt near defeat
You were there for me
On my side completely
You give me strength
You set me free
This is because of you
I'm all that I can be

When I'm with you
The world is ours to reach for
Together there is nothing we can't do

You and me, we're a miracle

Meant to be and nothing can change it
Mountains move and oceans part
When they are standing in our way
You and me, we're a miracle
Angels stand watching over us
And heaven shines upon us everyday

The chance was so unlikely
That we would ever be
Two stars above the heavens
Destiny brought you to me

Meant to be and nothing can change it
Mountains move and oceans part

How I feel when you hold me
I get butterflies
I hear lullabies

Or the sound of the rain
Is too precious and too wonderful
To give it a name

Too beautiful for words
A symphony inside me
Too beautiful for words
I can not take them lightly
Can you hear my silent heart

It's on the tip of my tongue
But my lips are still sealed
Only violins
And then innocence
Can show you how I feel

And I hear them again
At the end of the day
I'm all teary eyed
When we kissed goodbye
There's nothing I can say

Too beautiful for words
A symphony inside me
Too beautiful for words, oh
I can not take them lightly
Can you hear my silent heart

Must be a million times
I tried to express this love of mine
When it goes this deep
When it tastes this sweet
It's not easy to define, ohh

Verse:
The world seems so cold,
when i face so much all alone.
A little scared to move on
and knowing how fast I have grown.
And i wander just where i fit in
oh the visions alive in my head

i will be strong on my own
i will see through the rain i will find my way
i will keep on traveling this road
'till i finally reach my dream till I'm living and I'm breathing my destiny

verse 2:
i can't lt go now,
even when darkness surrounds.
but if i hold on, yer, i will show the world
all the things that you never expected to see from little old me,this pittsburgh girl.
and i wander just where my place is,
close my eyes and i remind my self this. oh yer

i will be strong on my own
i will see through the rain i will find my way
i will keep on traveling this road
'till i finally reach my dream till I'm living and I'm breathing my destiny

It comforts me, it keeps me
alive each day of my life.
Always guiding me, providing me
with the hope i desperateley need.
Well i gotta believe there's something out there meant for me.
o i get on my knees, praying i will receive,
the courage to grow and the faith to love.
and...

i will be strong on my own
i will see through the rain, i will find my way
i will keep on traveling this road
'till i finally reach my dream till I'm living and I'm breathing my destiny

Should I keep quiet just because I'm a women
Call me a bitch cause I speak what's on my mind
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled

When a female fires back suddenly big talker don't know how to act
So he does what every little boy would do
Makin' up a few false rumors or two
That for sure is not a man for me, slanderin' names for popularity
It's sad you only get your fame through controversy
But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say

So-what am I not supposed to say what I'm saying
Are you offended with the message I'm bringin'
Call me whatever 'cause you words don't mean a thing
Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing
If you look back in history it's a common double standard os society
The guy gets all the glory the more he can score
While the girl can do the same yet you call her a whore
I don't understand why it's OK,
The guy can get a way with it the girl gets named

Never can, never will

Here's something I just can't understand
If the guy have three girls then he's the man
He can even give her some head, or sex her off
But if a girl do the same, she's a whore
But the tables about to turn
I bet my fame on it
Cats take my ideas, and put their name on it
It's aight though, you can't hold me down
I got to keep on moving

Do it right back to him and let that be that
You need to let him know that his game is whack

Guess I, I couldn't trust called your bluff time is up
'Cause I've had enough
You were there by my side, always down for the ride

After all of the stealing and cheating you probably think that
I hold resentment for you
But uh uh, oh no, you're wrong
'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do, I wouldn't know
Just how capable I am to pull through
So I want to say thank you
Cause it

'Cause it makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

Never saw it coming, all of your backstabbing
Just so you could cash in on a good thing before I'd realize your game
I heard you're goin' round playin', the victim now
But don't even begin feeling I'm the one to blame
'Cause you dug your own grave
After all of the fights and the lies cause you're wanting to haunt me
But that won't work anymore, no more,
It's over
'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture
I wouldn't know how to be this way now and never back down

Turn out to be unjust so cruel
Could only see the good in you
Pretended not to know the truth
You tried to hide your lies, disguise yourself
Through living in denial

You won't stop me

All this tension telling me just exactly what we should be
Now I don't mind us being some kind of casual thing
Listen, all I want to do right now is have your contact on me

Can you put your hands my waistline
Want your skin up against mine
Move my hips to the baseline
Let me get mine, you get yours
Hang a please don't disturb sign
Put my back into a slow grind
Sending chills up and down my spine
Let me get mine, you get yours

If you see me with a man
Understand that you can't question me
The feelings that you call, it ain't my fault
It can't help your jealousy
If you can handle the fact that
What we have has got to be commitment free
Then we can keep this undercover lovin' comin', hittin'
Underneath the sheets

Move my hips to the baseline

So, come on and freak my body
We can get nasty, naughty
All night a private party
Gotta hit that spot just right
Work me like a 9 to 5
It ain't about the kissin' and huggin'
Cause this is a physical lovin'
Straight sweatin', our bodies are rubbin'
Gotta hit that spot just right

We'll make love, but don't fall in love

Christina Aguilera,"Once upon a time there was a girl
In her early years she had to learn
How to grow up living in a war that she called home
Never know just where to turn for shelter from the storm
Hurt me to see the pain across my mother's face
Every time my father's fist would put her in her place
Hearing all the yelling I would cry up in my room
Hoping it would be over soon

Bruises fade father, but the pain remains the same
And I still remember how you kept me so afraid
Strength is my mother for all the love she gave
Every morning that I wake I look back to yesterday

And I'm OK

I often wonder why I carry all this guilt
When it's you that helped me put up all these walls I've built
Shadows stir at night through a crack in the door
The echo of a broken child screaming ""please no more""
Daddy, don't you understand the damage you have done
To you it's just a memory, but for me it still lives on

Bruises fade father, but the pain remains the same
And I still remember how you kept me so afraid
Strength is my mother for all the love she gave
Every morning that I wake I look back to yesterday

It's not so easy to forget
All the marks you left along her neck
When I was thrown against cold stairs
And every day I'm afraid to come home
In fear of what I might see there

Bruises fade father, but the pain remains the same
And I still remember how you kept me so afraid
Strength is my mother for all the love she gave
Every morning that I wake I look back to yesterday

And I'm OK

He comes from a foreign place
An island far away
Intrigues me with every move
Til' I'm breathless, I'm helpless
Can't keep my cool
Steals my heart when he takes my hand
And we dance, to the rhythm of the band
I feel his finger tips, grip my hips
And I slip as we dip into a rare bliss

Mama used to warn me
To beware of those Latin lovers
She said I gave my heart too soon
And that's how I became your mother
I said hey mama, you seem to forget
I'm not in love yet
Sweet talk don't win me over
But I realized
Big brown eyes can hypnotize
When he says

I am full blood boricua
Reads the tattoo on his arm
He tells me, mami I need ya
And my heartbeat pumps so strong
Getting lost in el ritmo
He whispers te quiero, te quiero

Skin the color of cinnamon
His eyes light up and I melt within
Feels so good it must be a sin
I can't stop what I started
I'm giving in
He brings life to my fantasies
Sparks a passion inside of me
Finds the words when I can not speak
In the silence, his heartbeat is music to me

Mama used to warn me
Not to rush love with another
She said I'm not trying to lecture
I just care about my daughter
Ay mama, you seem to forget
I never will let
A man control my emotions
But when he smiles (when he smiles)
I feel like a little child

I am full blood boricua

I woke up this morning with a smile on my face
Nobody's gonna bring me down today
Been feeling like nothings been going my way lately
So I decided right here and now that my outlook's gotta change

That's why I'm gonna
Say goodbye to all the tears I've cried
For every time somebody hurt my pride
Feeling like they won't let me live life
Take the time to look at what is mine

I see every lesson completely
I thank God for what I got from above
I believe they can take anything from me
But they can't succeed in taking my inner peace
They can say all they want to say about me

But I'm gonna carry on
Keep on singing my song

I never want to dwell on my pain again
There's no use in reliving how I hurt back then
Remembering all of the hell I felt when I was running out of faith
Every step I vowed to take was towards a better day

'Cause I'm about to
Say goodbye to every single lie
All the fears I've held too long inside
Every time I felt I could try
All the negativity I had inside

For too long I've been struggling. I couldn't go on
But now I've found I'm feeling strong and moving on
I believe they can take anything from me
But they can't succeed in taking my inner peace
They can say all they want to say about me

But I'm gonna carry on
I'm gonna keep on singing my song

Whoa, and every time I tried to be what they wanted from me
It never came naturally
So I ended up in misery, wasn't able to see
All the good around me
They wasted so much energy on what they thought of me
Simply just remembering to breathe

I'm human, I ain't able to please
Everyone at the same time, so now I find
My peace of mind living one day at a time

I'm human and I answer to one god
It comes down to one love
Until I get to heave above I've made the decision
Never to give up
Til the I day I die no matter what I'm gonna carry on & keep on singing my song

(They can't take anything from me)
I believe that they can do what they wanna
Say what they want to say

(They can say what they wanna)
But I'm gonna keep on

I believe it
That they can take from me
But they can't take my inner peace

Because I'm sitting here with your picture
And smiling to myself
I'm kinda lost in my own thoughts of you
My heart speaks before my mind thinks through
And I blush as I say yes

What a feeling of vulnerability coming over me
And I'm feeling weak and I can't speak
Never thought I'd give in so willingly to a human being
With abilities to set me free
Free, make me be me
Makes me want to say

Your lips, your love, your smile, your kiss
I must admit it's a part of me
You please me, complete me, believe me
Like a melody
Your soul, your flow, your youth, your truth is simply proof
We were meant to be
But the best quality that's hookin' me
Is that you're loving me for me
Is that you're loving me for me

People ask why I'm in love with you
Well, let me start by saying
You got my heart by just being who you are
And what we got is between me and you
It doesn't matter about the money I make
Or what I do, or that I'm a, huh, a star

Unconditionally you're there for me
Undeniably you inspire me, spiritually, so sweet
This is meaningful, is incredible, pleasurable, unforgettable
The way I feel, so sweet
Makes me want to say

Is that you're loving me for me
Is that you're loving me for me

Its so amazing how something so sweet
Has come and rearranged my life
I've been kissed by destiny
Oh, heaven came and saved me
An angel was placed at my feet
This isn't ordinary, he's loving me for me

Stripped of all make up, no need for fancy clothes
No cover ups, push ups
With him, I don't have to put on a show
He loves every freckle, every curve, every inch of my skin
Fulfilling me entirely, taking all of me in
He's real,he's honest, he's loving me for me

I'm the only one that can rescue me from me

Leaving the house around quarter to five
Zipped up my boots and I'm ready to ride
And I feel so high, and I feel so alice
Let my hair down feel the wind on my skin
Crossin' the border where my new life begins
And I close my eyes and take it all in

Begging, pleading

My flows be's wet like all you girls drawers be 
Crack the dill's spread the Buddha in the hid-ouse 
Roll it up and Diddas, who tipped in for the 10 bag 
Etcetera, I roll my blunts with two textures 
Pick up 50 bags and then I smoke all the extras 
It's the truth like funk 180 proof 
Don't drop your drawers I'll fuck through your daisy dukes, true 
Put your fingers up in the air if your high 
I walk by, so f-in' dry 
I swing up in it 'bout an average as half as 
Good as Reggie Jackson's that's why you talk backwards 
And touch bills and Bogart shit like Humphrey 
You couldn't beat me if you ran with 21 Jumpstreet 
Or 90210 fuck it yo, in the movies
I'm the Nigga puffin' Buddha in the back row

I can't wait to get it on [Repeat 8x]

I'm just a smoky boy, I'm from the land of the lost 
You can't see me like Charlie Angel's boss 
I'm often coolin' round the Bliddocks 
I rock round the Cliddock 
My Gliddock cocked from here to 16 for Liddocks 
I tried to Thomas if I'm gettin' scopic 
I was built like two tits but now I'm butter like Blue Bonnet 
Now who got the funk, we got the funk 
A yo well, I got the weed, we got the blunt 
I never sniff, I used to puff Buddha's in the jail 
Back in 88 when it was 20 cent a gram 
You couldn't read me in braille, hell 
I write my names on walls in smoke spots when I'm buyin' L 
The fly guy with force like Luke sky 
Down for 8 ball see twa bitch if you fly 
The funkadelic been rockin' mic's since the fourth grade 
I terminate like X and I terminate like Schwarzenegge' 
Dum di dum, rock like Buju Banton 
Soup like won ton, fuck by the ton 
Please, my whole crew's makin' cheese 
Tonight's the night baby so suck up on these 
And it's on

I said, I catch the A-train to the left, smoke the junk 
I set shit off like Boba Fett. 
Big up to all my Nigga's in the housing projects 
I'm Runnin' up in your contingents and split your guts, round and round 
If you get scared of my lines when I rock well 
Got wits like Pernell, shits the bomb like Akinyele
Rickety rock it, mind be best to knock this 
Waste Nigga's like toxic, wet like galoshes 
Can I handle my biz? Yes you can 
I 'cause chaos and bring a lot of def to jams 
Yes I can, now ask to get out 
Pop the trunk, clu-clunk and now give me a ba-bump ba-bump 
Oh, cool, smooth like two blue suede shoes 
Y'all faggot's stepped on my Huffman and Coo's 
Word to Dan, tan, pillow and cool be

I've sung a lot of songs, I have made some bad rhymes
I've acted out my life in stages with ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you

I know your image of me is what I hope to be, I've treated you unkindly
But girl can't you see, there's no one more important to me
So darling can't you please see through me, 'cause we're alone now
And I'm singing my song for you, you taught me precious secrets

The truth withholding nothing, you came out in front
When I was hiding, but now I'm so much better
So if my words don't come together, listen to the melody
'Cause my love is in there hiding

I love you in a place where there is no space or time,
I love you for my life
'Cause you are a friend of mine, and when my life is over
Remember, when we were together

We were alone and I was singing my song for you
And when my life is over, remember when we were together
We were alone, and I was singing my song for you
