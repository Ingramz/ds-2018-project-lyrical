Saratoga,"Gritan en la oscuridad.
Fuego, me impide escapar.
Cada noche, puntual,
Ocupa su lugar.
Es el dueÃ±o,
Su poder no puedes controlar.
Mira el reflejo de la humanidad.
SÃ³lo hay un ser que mata por placer.
Why de nada servirÃ¡ que implores su perdÃ³n.
Barro, sangre, trueno why luz.
La bestia ya llegÃ³.
Que se aleje de tus pensamientos.
Que en tus sueÃ±os no tenga lugar.
Pronto despertarÃ¡s del largo viaje.
Vuelta a la realidad.
AÃºn se escuchan los gritos why llantos.
AÃºn resuenan muy dentro de ti.
Ese olor especial a carne quemada.
Nunca te olvidarÃ¡s del rompehuesos.

",Rompehuesos,2005
Saratoga,"Viaje por la mente 
Una promesa que tendrá que realizar. 
Esperar que salga la luz, 
Sobre la cima la debe encontrar. 

Podrá volar, ser un halcón
Capaz de ver la paz de su interior. 
Se fue, no dijo adiós.
Alzó sus brazos, no la pudo seguir. 

Condenado a vivir,
Sin llorarla y sin sentir. 
En su trampa caerás, 
Si la quieres es para ti. 

Como amiga llegará. 
Como extraña se te irá, engañándote. 
Robará tu corazón 
Si la intentas atrapar. 

Relatos de un diario 
Escondiendo los secretos del edén. 
Sentirá la alquimia y la fe, 
Es el espíritu que habita en él. 

Embrujado estará. 
Hasta el juicio tú llorarás.

Como extraña se te irá, engañándote.

Saratoga,"A miles de hombres, mujeres y niños
El destino les juega una mala pasada
Sólo el deseo de que esto se acabe
Mantiene la llama encendida una vez más.

Les roban el alma, destrozan sus vidas

Ella llora en mis sueños contando tragedias
Abro los ojos enciendo la luz

Él trabajando de sol a sol 
Mientras tu exhibes tu colección

Crece en el barrio un odio infernal 
Mientras su llanto resuena, morirá!

En el dÃ­a en que todo comenzÃ³.

It wouldn't change a thing

Timeless love, ageless us
There's no end, always was
A timeless love, heaven born
Ancient vows, never to be torn

There is no tomorrow in my heart
Only dreamers believe in time
So let's leave no regrets behind
I'll give it all when I'm with you

There's no sadness when you see my eyes
There's no distance when I let you go
Cause I know a timeless love, on this rock take me now
And make a lovebird of the coo-coo in the clock

Sarcófago,"Behind the gates only death
Burning your mind you hear the bell
The gates are open for your entry
Light of day turn to the darkness of hell...
Nightmare
Skull and putrid corpses
Sads and somber places
And you cry tears of blood
Because you are dead
Now I will go prowl on endless night
Remembering yours blasphemes and lies
I will never give mercy to you
But satanas want your sinner's soul
You will never return
Never...

Sarcófago,"She was a simple girl, coming from a simple town
Still a child she started to work
She never had time for school

Had a boyfriend, young,
Unemployed, wasted and stoned
Expelled from home for moralistic reasons
She started to live with him

She was only 16, trying to live with misery
Day after day, wasting her life
She decided to sell her body

Walking down corners and dark lanes
Night lights dazzles her mind
Crime and voilence on her way
Soon she was the queen of the night

Midnight queen, alone in the night
Always dreaming of better days
Midnight queen, trying to survive
But so many thorns on her way
Midnight queen, I'm sorry for you life,
For your sorrow, for your fate
Midnight queen

Dreaming of better days
That will never come
Another night has just begun

Into drugs and booze she throws herself
Trying to escape from reality
She won't escape

Found in a motel room
Her sweet blood everywhere
A few bucks on her body

And around her neck
Tied with a dead know
Hang a lash",Nightmare,1999

Tiré par deux chevaux
Un sentier dans la montagne
Pour aller puiser l'eau
J'ai au fond de ma mémoire
Des lumières d'autrefois
Qu'une très vieille femme en noir
Illuminait pour moi
Une maison tout en pierre
Que la mer a rongée
Au-dessus d'un cimetière
Où les croix sont penchées

Que les vents m'ont soufflées
Des discours interminables
Après le déjeuner

Je viens du Sud
Et par tous les chemins

Où je rentrais après minuit
Pour ne pas qu'ils se réveillent
Hier soir à table
J'ai bien cru que ma mère
Se doutait de quelque chose
Elle m'a demandé si j'étais malade
Et pourquoi j'étais si pâle
J'ai dis que j'était très bien
Tout à fait clair
Je pense qu'elle a fait semblant de me croire
Et mon père a souri

En passant à côté de sa voiture
J'ai ressenti comme un drôle de coup
Je pensais que ce s'rait plus dur
Et plus grisant un peu
Comme une aventure
En moins déchirant
Oh surtout ne pas se retourner
S'éloigner un peu plus
Il y a la gare
Et après la gare
Il y a l'Atlantique
Et après l'Atlantique

C'est bizarre cette espèce de cage
Qui me bloque la poitrine
Ca m'empêche presque de respirer
Je me demande si tout à l'heure
Mes parents se douteront
Que je suis en train de pleurer
Oh surtout ne pas se retourner
Ni des yeux ni de la tête
Ne pas regarder derrière
Seulement voir ce que je me suis promis
Et pourquoi et où et comment
Il est 7 heures moins 5
Je me suis rendormi
Dans ce train qui s'éloigne un peu plus
Oh surtout ne plus se retourner

Things that used to be one
Become divided being in halves
Violence turns into fear

My wounds are remainders
Painful as hell
Either one face each on one side
Like a wall in the heart
Like twins torn apart

Yeah, greater than one

Bury the Earth

I thought that we've been through 
Never ever I felt so strange

And I'm thinking it over and over and over

Sash!,"A weapon of fire, emotions mistrust 
And they're still lying, they won't be to pushed
Call me to freedom, too much to bear 
Take me to reason, and I'll fly from there

But if you run, and hide, you'll lose my soul 
When it's time to cross the tide
I'll be lost in the flow 
When the truth won't happen
Please don't try to run

If life was a season, the leaves turned to grey 
Call in a free bird, who may light the way
These words were spoken, to tempt you from fire 
A hope for emotion, which came to desire

But if you run, and hide, you'll lose my soul 
When it's time to cross the tide,
I'll be lost in the flow 
When the truth won't happen
Please don't try to run

Or the world we're shaping 
Will fall from the sky
I'll take your happy fall 
And linger as time goes on

Solitary motion, will lead to despair 
Fortunes in bleeding, will bring souls to bear
But if it's hoping, I'm hoping too much 
It's not the solution, to live on mistrust

But if you run, and hide, you'll lose my soul 
When it's time to cross the tide,
I'll be lost in the flow

What if the world was out of pain?
Would it be a world that's worth living in?
Without anything, that's worth a sin.

What if the world was out of hope,
To find a place, where you belong,
You said to yourself, you'll never make it that far,
That the mountain's too high, the answer is just around the hill.

Chorus:
Just around the hill,
Just around the hill,
Take a look on the other side,
Suddenly you'll see, there are many ways, to go to strain,
Just walk around, walk around the hill.

What if the world was out of love?
And all that we do, don't mean a thing,
Just take the chance, no offering, no suffering, for anything.

You're asking yourself, do you really want it that way?
That the mountain's too high.
The answer is just around the hill.

Chorus (2 times)

Hmm¡­walk around that hill

Without you to hold me when I call
Would I be anything at all
Sometimes I wonder what a fool I've been
Please open up your arms and let me in

Let me be the one for you,
Let me be the one for you
Let me be the one for you

You have touched me with your eyes
Like no one else has touched me
It's funny but you know that
I can't take you by surprise
It's just the way it should be
I think by now you know me

I've been too blind to see what I have found
But all I know is that I need you around

Sasha,"Met a girl and wrote a letter to get her
Asking her if she could fill a hole in my heart
Now I got myself all messed up just my luck
That she won't be buying and I should stop trying

Bought myself a brand new logo it's HUGO
But she don't notice me no matter how hard I try
Looked into a super hair do as you do
Kidding myself I'm a much cooler guy

And here she comes again
She's my one out of ten
I love her endlessly
But she don't me

Maybe she thinks I'm a loser to choose her
But I can't seem to get her out of my mind
Is it I'm dressed like a dummy, oh honey
I'm not that outdated just so underrated

Got a feeling like a phoney baloney
But I'd die for her if she would only be mine
Just one look this way would do me truly
You say hello before you say goodbye

And here she comes again
She's my one out of ten
I love her endlessly
But she don't me

Sasha,"[Verse 1:]
I got a lot to give
You got a lot to take
You're like a shark inside
You would eat me up alive
I'd touch the devil's lips
I'd sell my soul to you
Your wish is my command
My desire is your demand

Take good aim
My heart is waiting
Kill me with a kiss
Come on, do it like this

I get blown away
When you shoot that smile
I get knocked to ground
By a single word
I get ripped apart
When you play my heart
Locked and loaded
I get blown away

You cast a spell on me
Demons are in my head
Angels are scared to fly
When you're in town, I wonder why!
You are so beautiful
You're all that i desire

Something new and something real

Verse 1 Arguments rule today
We slug it out
Tears are so common place
We're drowning now

We're under a dark cloud, Baby
We cannot shake it off
(think) we gotta go right back to the start
To make it stop¡­.

Days like these
Soon will end
It's gonna get better, Baby
Hold that thought
Say a prayer
Rescue will come to save it
Dawn will break
You will see
There will be no more days like these

Verse 2
We are both on defense
Ready for attack
Always prepared to fight
You watch your back

I can't remember just how
Far it was we fell
But we gotta try and relearn love
To break this spell¡­.

Verse 1
Twincam, Turbocharge, Fuel injection
Drive shaft, Jet black, wider wheels
Alloy caps, front grills, automatic,
Car fanatic
Raving up from under me

Verse 2
Four speaker bass bins, wheel spins,
Stereo, fog lights, accelerate,
Motorway, cruise control, low suspension,
Hypertension,
Pumping up inside of me

I wanna drive my car
With no speed-limit
Wanna drive it fast
Foot down on the gas
And the wheels turn round and round

Verse 3
Foot down on the floor
Roof back,
Slam the doors,
Get inside, we can ride,
Take the wheel for a while
Tail lights
White lines

No bank, full tank,

Verse 1
Ain't it strange how we keep missing each other
Connecting not enough, we let it be
So wide awake but no eyes for one another
There must be a bridge that brings you nearer to me

Chorus
Let's get closer again
I wanna feel your touch
Let's get closer again
I need you so much
It doesn't hurt now and then
Let's give it a try
Let's get closer again

Verse 2
I always wonder how we keep it together
Although you laugh
I know it brings you down
I tried to cover up
But I'm not that clever
I'm only half the man when you're not around

We fall in this great big divide
Avoiding each other
We both run and hide
I'm sure that one look at your smile
There ain't nothing better

[Verse 1:]
Everyone - has a chance to live a life of our own choosing
And try to carry on,
Even though sometimes it feels like we are losing.
Held together by our dreams
When the boredom and the meaningless
Just keeps us all from living.
Just remember who you are,
You´d never come this far without
Believing in yourself (and this is what you say)..

[Chorus]
[Verse 2:]
Everytime, everytime I think I know what life´s romance is
It´s only then I find,
Still don´t know the questions let alone the answers.
Am I here just for myself? do I live for someone else?
Will I find just what i´m missing?
I´ll) remember who I am, always try again and keep
Believing in myself (and this is what i´ll say)..

[Chorus]
[Bridge:]
Can we be,
Can we be content with what we have been living?
And let us leave alone,
Let us leave alone the future that is hidden?

Ain't a thing you can't get round

And you don't know what to do
Hold your fire and look about

I like the comfort of the chaos in my place
I put my mind on hold my conscience on standby
For a little while

Another promise to my room I couldn't keep
Another night just full of television sleep
And all my books are getting on the shelf

I liven up for giving in
I'm never cold but shivering
The more I learn the less I know
Gotta dig myself out of this hole 'cause

Sometimes I feel so automatic in this automatic world
I can't escape my automatic this automatic world

Now and then I realize a trail of fear
Every time my resolutions disappear
But then again I'm slipping back into release

I liven up for giving in
I'm never cold but shivering
The more I learn the less I know
Gotta dig myself out of this hole 'cause

I can't escape my automatic this automatic world

Until now I failed to find the way of control

I don't know what you see â?? but I can't guarantee
That there's something in me to adore

If this is alright
How do you know
If all that you give â?? comes back to you
How can you be so damn sure
That this way is the right one to go
How do you know

it's so amazing â?? how far you can get
Just by keeping your mind â?? away from regrets
Following targets â?? without looking back
I've missing the view that's around

you pull me to places â?? I almost forgot
Maybe I'm worth it â?? maybe I'm not
I'm more than a sinner â?? and less than a saint

So I'm trying to get on my feet 
Again and again and again and again 

Now and then I start talking to myself 
Cause I'm ashamed did tell anybody else

To find out 

That I'm alive 
And I can't get myself outta here 
I'm alive

You have to see the same face tomorrow 
Do me a favour and get out of my way

A little bearable like dating you ex-wife 
Do I really need to back out and to hide

Was hast du nur gemacht mit mir?
War doch nur eine Nacht mit dir
Hab' stundenlang gelacht mit dir
Ich bin entwaffnet hier
Wie ist 'n das passiert?
Meine sieben Siegel hast du
Einfach mal kurz weggeküsst
Und mir gezeigt, dass im Rausch ohne Reue
Der Morgen danach einfach besser ist

Ich lauf' durch die Straßen wie high

Und den Bauch voller Lieder
Hätt' nie damit gerechnet, dass mir
Sowas irgendwann mal passiert

Du bist zu schön um wegzusehen
Das nennt man wohl perfekte Zehn
Ich krieg hier langsam ein Problem
Denn ich muss mir gestehen
Ich will dich wiedersehen
Mit deiner Hand in meiner hast du
Jeden Zweifel weggewischt
Und ich weiß' jetzt, dass ein Rausch ohne Reue
Am Morgen danach so viel besser ist

Ich hab' keine Ahnung was das wird
Ich hab' keine Ahnung wohin das führt
Keine Ahnung, ob das gut geht
Ob mir am Ende der Mut fehlt
Ich hab gedacht: „Besser nie als spät“
Mit einem Lächeln hast du meinen Plan
Auf links gedreht
Du lässt die Melodien fliegen
In meinem Bauch
Und ich hoffe du hörst sie auch

Davon den Proberaum bezahlt, wo ich fast gewohnt hab
Pakete geklebt, von Junkfood gelebt

Asking her if she could fill a hole in my heart

That she won't be buying and I should stop trying

Bought myself a brand new logo it's HUGO
But she don't notice me no matter how hard I try
Looked into a super hair do as you do
Kidding myself I'm a much cooler guy

And here she comes again
She's my one out of ten
I love her endlessly
But she don't me

Maybe she thinks I'm a loser to choose her
But I can't seem to get her out of my mind
Is it I'm dressed like a dummy, oh honey
I'm not that outdated just so underrated

Got a feeling like a phoney baloney
But I'd die for her if she would only be mine
Just one look this way would do me truly

I'll do anything that you want me to do
Ooh, just call out my name, can't she give me a sign
Give me a sign, whoa

If you just give me some time
To convince you we can pull through
Let me see what's on your mind
I won't change you, I don't have to.

Verse 1
There's a voice inside us all
Calling out so we don't fall
Nothing's lost that can't be found
Ain't a thing you can't get round

Chorus 1
Turn it into something good
There's a chance you really could
Turn it into something special
When you see it's time to choose
Gonna find you'll never lose
Turn it into something special

Verse 2
When your calm is broke into
And you don't know what to do
Hold your fire and look about
Take the flame, don't put it out

Chorus 2

Just believe in something new
We all have our part to do
Turn it into something special
And you'll still be standing strong
Hold your ground and carry on
Turn it into something special

Bridge
When you know right from the start
Gonna play it from the heart
Take a chance and make things better
Leave your fears and doubts behind
Don't give in, just keep trying
Turn it into something special

Chorus
Turn it into something good
There's a chance you really could
Turn it into something special
When you see it's time to choose
Gonna find you'll never lose
Turn it into something Â¨C just believe in something

Don't hold in, just let it out
Keep believing there's no doubt
Take a chance and make it special
And you'll still be standing strong
Hold your ground and carry on
Turn it into something Â¨C just believe in something

Since I was a little girl 
We'd be friends holding hands 
'till the end 

you?re one of a kind 
You're the dream that came true 
From the candles I blew 
You bring out the best in me 
That's why I love you 'cause your love is so real 

I'm floating down the aisle 
Watching you wanting me 
Wanna be yours forever 
Every step I make 
Every breath I take 
Is getting closer to you 
Forever 

our house will be home   
And love will keep growing 
With a family of our own 
We'll sit by the fire, tell stories and laugh 
And sometimes cry 
There'll be ups and downs, nothin's perfect 

but our love won?t be afraid to be strong and brave 
A lifetime together we?ll share 
Every emotion that true love can bear 

I'm floating down the aisle 
Watching you wanting me 
Wanna be yours forever 
And every step I make, every breath I take 
Is getting closer to you 
Forever 

here we are standing side by side 
I'm ready to be your bride 
We both say I do 
Oh baby ?you look into my eyes 
You kiss me for a while 
And we slip away

I like the comfort of the chaos in my place
I put my mind on hold my conscience on standby
For a little while

Another promise to my room I couldn't keep
Another night just full of television sleep
And all my books are getting on the shelf

I liven up for giving in
I'm never cold but shivering
The more I learn the less I know
Gotta dig myself out of this hole 'cause

Sometimes I feel so automatic in this automatic world
I can't escape my automatic this automatic world

Now and then I realize a trail of fear
Every time my resolutions disappear
But then again I'm slipping back into release

Gotta dig myself out of this hole 'cause

I'm hiding to seek
I'm a freak what a freak
Though it's only on my mind
Until now I failed to find the way of control

Lay there on the ground and turn the dirt into your joy

It's all been boring lately so I suggest we trade a question mark in for a maybe
Time your riddles right and make a point that has no sense
Make sure that you're smiling and the money's been well spent
Innocence and ignorance it all goes hand in hand
I'm not sure that I'm right but I hope you'll understand

I hope that you're still searching for the start that has no end

But I'm home now, and things still look the same

On the road where the cars never stop going through the night,
To a life where I can't watch the sun set

But I want to see you again

Should run a bath and then clear up the mess i made before i left here

Before I knew that I could get on a plane and fly away,
From the road where the cars never stop going through the night,
To a life where I can watch the sun set,
And take my time
Take all my time

The rings around your eyes they don't hide, that you need to get some rest

I drank too much last night, got bills to pay, my head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today, I'm late for work again
And even if I'm there, they'll all imply that I might not last the day
And then you call me and it's not so bad, it's not so bad and

I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life

And my heart is heart is trying hard to drown them out
I keep hearing what they say
They can space me into what they're all about

Well power slips away
And I'm weakening with every word they say
So I contemplate my faith
As I do, the whisper turns into a shout

You bring out the voices inside of me
Can't stop from a place that I can't reach
I would love to practice what I preach
You bring out the voices inside of me

I tried to resist but you caught me
I tried to dismiss what you taught me
I tried to resist but you caught me
I tried to dismiss what you taught me

Risking everything I had
I was keen to find the worst that I could do
Throw this sanity away
Brought destruction to the people that I know

My hurt became a cage
I became a puppet on the stage
And even though we're not okay
The feeling brings me blush all the same, all the same

You bring out the voices inside of me
Can't stop from a place that I can't reach

Embrace tight as a snake?s, a-slither
over the grave pit, hither, thither.

breaks dim, then will you find me gone;
and cold your bed, till comes the light.

with tenderness, all sweetness-rife:
I choose to rule you, love, with fright.

Burn up the skyline 'til I'm free
Spread my ashes on the sea
'Til I run

Walls cave in
I guess it's time I let them fall
I've been holding in
Everything for far too long
Ashes, ashes, we all fall down
Ashes, ashes, we all fall down
Now shed this skin
Now when it's time, I know I'll fly again
I know I'll fly again

Hasta agotar su capital
Y un día vulgar como otros tantos el ordinario azul dio paso
Al rojo más dilatador de la verdad

Que llevarse a los labios más bien secos
Vacíos el armario y los cajones de risas de caricias y te quieros

Ay amor que te vas siempre como vienes

Como lo es la línea del horizonte
Las existencias de felicidad que un día guardaron

Fueron los enfermeros del enfermo
Que más que revivir se remoría con la lengua colgando como un perro

Ay amor que vienes tal como te vas
Es decir sin despedirte es decir sin avisar
Ay amor que te vas siempre como vienes

Como seguirte al paso?
Como saber a donde vas?
Casi no te conozco
Y no te dejo de pensar
Rueda mi mente, no se detiene
Presiento que ya no se detendrá
Todas mis ansias llevan tu boca
Rueda mi mente tras de ti
Mi suerte, mi destino tu seras
Rueda mi mente, no se detiene
Presiento que ya no se detendrá
Todo termina siempre en tu nombre
Rueda mi mente tras de ti
Me temo que me voy a enamorar

Llévame
Entre tus alas me pierdo
Y hazme creer que si me suelto volaré

Serás el aire

Serás la lluvia que calmara mi sed

When will I marry
Why do I cry for nothing sometimes

I want to believe in something I feel
I want to believe it's all that I need

When will I have this mystery solved?
Who said a ring could mean love forever
Nothing's for sure except growing old
Will I always be here spinning my wheels
Or does misfortune have a hand in the deal
Is that how my fate is sealed?
I want to believe love has a chance to survive
The dream to be as one
I want to believe in a nurturing love
And not just a sacrifice

Where is my home and where am I going?
When will I know and how will I know?

Satanic Surfers,"Although we've had our differences of opinion through the years I can't deny what I am feeling in here
There are feelings I can hide within me and feelings that I can't conceal

Sometimes I think that I never get to know you well enough, never understand why you did the things you did
Although I'm part of you and you're part of me too
I just wanted you to understand that I'm

I don't want the image of you to fade away
I know we're running out of time, don't ever think I said ""I love you""
This is my way of saying I do

Although we've had our differences through the years I cannot judge you, cannot understand what I do not know
There are feelings I can hide within me and feelings that I can't conceal
But still they're so difficult to show

Although I'm part of you and you're part of me too

There's clearly a difference on what we define as significant matters
But isn't it funny how everything that's important to me is trivial to you?
And it's hard not to notice when you express yourself so explicitly with harsh words and pleasantries to ridicule me

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie

But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Of paradise, where roses grew

To find a girl like you
We would meet at the park at school
And talk till the day was through
Then you took me to your parents' house
And I would comb your hair
And we would dream of all the cities
And places we could go

Now I'm man, and still can't put down my toys
Hey, hey, hey

But I had to learn that lesson down in the south
After spending nights in the town just to have a little fun
In my mind I'm wishing she's the one
(I said to myself)
Is this to close to reality
For you to be that girl from my fantasy

Oh, oh, oh
Say the words that you know I won't hear
Put your heart up close to my ear
We would live to know the time
We could stay till the days turns to night.

Satoshi Tomiie,"You're like a child with old eyes,
Cynical and sensible, always full of surprises
You travel far and wide
Looking for the feeling, lost inside you
They don't understand you, no
Until it's too late
With everything they've handed you
On a silver plate

Are you hungry for a little more
Than what you've had before?
Are you hungry for a taste of life?
Whet your appetite, are you hungry?

Now give me this mountainside
Cool waters to lie beside
Give me these two strong eyes
To see the difference between truth and lies
Ah, give me this feeling when you kiss me baby

Every day and every night
That's all I need, yes
Everything is gonna be all right

Are you hungry for a little more
Than what you've had before?
Are you hungry for a taste of life?
Whet your appetite, are you hungry?

You're like a sight for sore eyes, lyrical and gentle
Border-lining sentimental
You're like a dream realized
So why do I keep falling back to sleep,
I'm so serious and deep.

Are you hungry for a little more
Than what you've had before?
Are you hungry for a taste of life?
Whet your appetite, are you hungry?

Are you hungry for a little more
Than what you've had before?
Are you hungry for a taste of life?
Whet your appetite, are you hungry?",Hungry,2002
Satoshi Tomiie,"Look at me baby
I'm crying
Tears so many
Tears
So so many tears (repeat 8 times)

I am real good actor
This is a heavy road
Our love's a script and you carry total control
Like a clown and I've been smiling
Whenever people are all around
But when the curtain comes down and the circus is through
No one is left but me and you and all my tears
So many tears my tears

One word could wash them away
One word could take their place
One word could wash them away
One word could take their place
Tears

Regretting nothing but the pain
My heart my life my world is filled with rain
I'm drowning when the curtain comes down and the circus is through
No one is left but me you and all my tears

One word could wash them away
One word could take their place
One word could wash them away so many
One word could take their place so many
One word could wash them away so many
One word could take their place so many
Tears
So many tears, tears one word could wash them away

Baby I just want to step back and look at my eyes
I've been crying girl cant you see
Oh girl
That dripping and dropping and dropping and dripping and
Dripping and dropping and dropping and dripping and
Dripping and dropping and dropping and dripping and
Dripping and dropping and dropping and dripping and
Dripping and dropping and dropping and dripping and
Dripping and dropping and dropping and dripping and
Dripping and dropping

You gotta come off that stage baby
Come on home and rescues me
I want you to sing for me girl
I want you to dance for me baby
Move that body for me
Come on baby

Satta,"Remember when there was nothing else to do, 
But lie and bed and, 
Wonder how it was always up to you, 
And no one else and,
Early mornings, made by warnings, 
What's the point of the alarm 
That I'm ignoring?
It's even raining, 
I'm not complaining, 
But waking up is hard to do so

Turn my head 
Its back to bed with no delay, 
Can't be bothered by the phone 
Ten times a day, 
Why get up 
When my morning doesn't even start till two
Forget reality waking up is hard to do.

Remember when we would hang out every day, 
And we would rather,
Not be told what to do or what to say, 
Cause nothing mattered.
Never boring with slept in mornings, 
Not ashamed of bad habits that I'm forming.
Its not important if days are shortened, 
I can't make time when nothings new,
Cause waking up is hard to do so

Turn my head its back to bed with no delay, 
Can't be bothered by the phone ten times a day, 
Why get up my morning doesn't even start till two?
Forget reality waking up is hard to do.

What's a day when it all ends up the same, 
And lasts forever?
Can't complain 
When there's nothing there to blame, 
And things can't be better.
Summer evenings, teenage grievings, 
Got no problem with the life that I've been leading.
No concentration on hesitation, 
I can't make time when nothings new, 
Cause waking up is hard to do so

Turn my head its back 
To bed with no delay, 
Can't be bothered by the phone ten times a day, 
Why get up my morning doesn't even start till two
Forget reality waking up is hard to do.",Heart Attack [Peter Rauhofer's Particular Remix],2003

And I just can't wait till the day when you knock on my door
Now every time I go for the mailbox, gotta hold myself down

Sattalites,"My mama told me, she said, ""Son, please beware
There's this thing called love, and it's ah ev'rywhere""
And she told me it can break your heart
And put you in misery
Since I met this little woman I feel it's happened to me
And I'm tellin' you
 
It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe, I believe I'm falling in love
It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe, I believe I'm falling in love
 
I find myself phonin' her at least ten times a day
It's so unusual for me to carry on this way
I tell you, I can't sleep at night, a wanting to hold her tight
I tried so hard to convince myself that this feelin' just can't be right
And I'm tellin' you
 
It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe, I believe I'm falling in love
It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe, I believe I'm falling in love
 
I wouldn't mind it if I knew she really loved me too
But I'd hate to think that I'm in love alone
And nothing that I can do,  oh
 
It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe, I believe I'm falling in love
It's too late to turn back now

Really couldn't get away too soon

I can't imagine anything that's better
The world is ours whenever we're together
There ain't a place I'd like to be instead of 

Groovin', down a crowded avenue
Doin' anything we like to do

There's always lots of things that we can see
We can be anyone we want to be
And all those happy people we could meet just 

Groovin', on a Sunday afternoon
Really couldn't get away too soon

Ah-ha-ha
Ah-ha-ha

Saturday Action Theatre,"Strangers in the night, 
Exchanging glances
Wandering the night, 
What were the chances
We'd be sharing love
Before the night was through

Something in your eyes
Was so inviting
Something in your smile
Was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment 
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away

And ever since that night 
We've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever
It turned out so right

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment 
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away
For strangers in the night.",Strangers in the Night,2004
Saturday Looks Good to Me,"When they started counting down
I could not believe that you were fast asleep
And I felt like those flashing lights
On the ocean floor, at the liquor store
It's not the type of secret that you want to keep too long
Look for me but I'll be gone
Take your love and step it down
Spin around the room 'til you have to choose
Maybe I'll pick both of them
Maybe neither one
Maybe Emerson
Every time the phone rings it sounds like a song
Look for me and I'll be gone
You can't sing to save your life
Through the alcohol
Drinking champagne off the walls
It looks like after all
They still talk about us like they've got nothing else to do
It could have been lines
And after all this time
They'll still talk about us like we're not even in the room
Outside the birds sing
Louder than the phone rings
Every night you fall asleep with your headphones on
Look for me and I'll be gone",Alcohol,2003
Saturday Looks Good to Me,"I'm standing in a line
I been trying to find that girl of mine
I'm crying all the time
I been trying to find that girl of mine

But you're still at the bar
Handing out those photocopied pictures of your heart
And as cute as they are
They can't conceal your automatic eyes

With the mercury inside
I'm stranded here all night
I been trying to find that girl of mine
I'm picking dandelions

I been trying to find that girl of mine
I'm crying every night
Because of that girl of mine
I threw away all of my valentines

But you're still at the bar
Handing out those photocopied x-rays of your heart
But as fine as they are
They never hide your carbon copy eyes

With the wrecking ball inside.",Girl of Mine,2003
Saturday Looks Good to Me,"Beside the drum kit in the basement
I was trying to get to sleep
I heard your voice come through the floorboards
On my answering machine
But by the time I reached the phone's ring
The only thing still singing was the dialtone

I couldn't find you in my dreams
So I went out into the night
I heard you talking somewhere soft
Your voice bounced off a satellite
But by the time I reached the place
From where the sound originated
You were gone

But I smelled summer in those letters
That you sprayed with your perfume
I breathed your breath
And I was left swaying with the curtains in the room
In the knowledge you would leave me
Beneath the angry April moon where you first found me

You've got one too many lovers
But you're still my only friend
And you got more secret admirers
Than there are snakes in the garden
And by the time you're finished kissing
Whoever's come around hissing
You're spitting out poison

And all the people have their reasons
For the things they think they have to do
But none of the reasons you're speaking
Sound anything like the truth

Each one sounds like a composite
Each one sounds like a new excuse for letting go
So let go
If all that's left is letting go

As the x-ray clearly shows
This thing was broken long ago

The bars will close
And the ashtrays overflow

I won't be there on Thursday night
But I hope you all have fun
You may not recognize my absence
But I won't be the only one
Who goes missing from your party
As the stitches come undone",Dialtone,2004
Saturday Looks Good to Me,"You can tell me secrets if you want to
But my house ain't got no ceiling
And my heart won't hold no lies
I'm not like everybody that you talk to
And I just might shoot your helicopter
Right out of the sky
I was so excited I would fall down in a pile
I'm always reminded every time I see you smile
Walking by I see you through your window

You're higher than a fever
And there's something on your mind
You're daydreaming through another winter
But the dreams that you keep leaning on
Have got to wait this time
I was so excited but that only lasts a while
I'm always reminded, now you're walking down the aisle

Baby, baby you make me so nervous
I think you do it on purpose
And you know you do

Lately I just don't think that it's worth it
Better call the taxidermist

You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

I'd like to know if your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow

Saturday Supercade,"Surprised at the thought that I could be wrong
I've felt removed from you for incredibly long.
And coming home to empty rooms again
If these walls could speak, I'd say nothing to them.

I know it's not a good excuse
But I was busy sleeping while you were soaked in misery.
That's why I didn't notice you
But now I'm awake enough to see that you should be happy.
Not just content with me.

This is my song for all the bitter words I've said to you.
Can I ever make it up, recognizing apologies just aren't enough?
This is my plea to you.

Up until now I haven't had to miss you
Because I've been away doing something else.
So I never enjoyed the rain
Because every time it did I'd just walk away.

he is called the Old White Norse God;
he is great and holy;

his horse is named Goldtop.
He lives where it's called the mountain in the sky besides
Bifrost.
He needs less sleep than a bird;
he sees night as clear as day
one thousand miles away from where he is;
he also hear the grass grow from the soil,
or the wool on the sheep and everything that can be heard.
He possess the horn that is called the Gjallarhorn,
and they can hear him blowing the horn in all the homes.",Heimdallr,1997

The road for the spiritual outlaw is never ending
And so is the hunt for all those answers

Blue cold and the grim truth stands before you (all you ever
Wanted?)

Descend and fly away to another day, another night
Sleep forever or serve to justify

The brand that you wear speak of what you are made of
It leaves you like an open book for everyone to read

To be a part of the master plan is the only way
To spiritual hell

The, incredible skills of the G from Brooklyn, big up kid
And ain't no eatin me up, you fast fuckin with jigga
I'm like Prince jeans, I bring the ass out a nigga
When I rock it it's in the pocket, baby mop it don't knock it
till you try it, once you start, you can't stop it
I'm the cocky breed, I'm dope like poppy seed
I live one rent from besides that be 
between get off my dick and stop jockin me
When I bust a rhyme you're diggin the sound
I know you lovin the way it's, goin down baby
So Ason huh, if you're down with the groove, why don't ya
Get on the mic and show and prove

[Ol' Dirty Bastard:]
Come on
Wu-Tang killa bees on a swarm
Rain on your college ass, disco dorm
Slippery when wet and don't you ever forget
You couldn't get a FLICK, of the hype outfit
Because the way that I dress this style mad wild
Enough to make a crowd of women scream ""ow!""
Whether at a party or just in bed
All thoughts on Ason, keep that in your head
Yuh, my beats are funky and my rhymes are spunky
Sometimes I'll be like ""Well god damn what's the recipe?""
I don't know, I ask my momma she don't know
she says ""go ask your God damned father!""
It's all about me in the place to be
Niggas thing they all that, yo, that shit is G
Mad game and it's a motherfucking shame
How many enemies want to claim the name
Of Ason, who carries on like a manager
Yo! Sounds fly right? Danger!!!",Show & Prove,1994
Sauce Boss,"Like the pine trees lining the winding road,
I got a name, I got a name,
Like the singing bird and the croaking toad,
I got a name, I got a name.

And I carry it with me like my daddy did
But I'm living the dream that he kept hid.

[Chorus]
Moving me down the highway, rolling me down the highway
Moving ahead so life won't pass me by.

Like the north wind whistlin' down the sky,
I got a song; I got a song.
Like the whippoorwill and the baby's cry,
I got a song, I got a song,

And I carry it with me and I sing it loud,
If it gets me nowhere, I'll go there proud.

[Chorus]

And I'm gonna go there free

Like the fool I am and I'll always be,
I got a dream, I got a dream.
They can change their minds but the can't change me,
I got a dream, I got a dream

Oh, I know I could share it if you'd want me to,
If you're goin' my way, I'll go with you.

You thought I was layin'? no no I ain't layin' I'm takin'

How bout if I stuff your fuckin' head through that window 
That would unconfuse you right? 
Thought I was layin' give me the fuckin' money come on

Just be B.S'n logically 
Not like that we be guessin'

Cristal to spring water, Bacardi whateva 
What it is, is what it is

You know how the game goes 
Whenever your name grows 
But still love is love fuckin' the same hoes 
Against the grain goes the souped up rapper 
He spittin' venom 
So now we gotta get wit him 
And do the ten thing 
Frightenin', while his men cling 
Then watch blood extract out his ass like ginseng 
It all ends with, all of his mens hit

Ya insides burnin'

With more niggas than Mark Furman 
Ya never learnin, never been so determined 
Not to be concerned with ya sermon 
Wheels of fortune still turnin' 
Still street caviar remains untouched 
For Sauce Money cheeseburger deluxe 
Screamin' what the ******(crooks?) feenin' 
Dough we rake off 
While you hailin' cabs 
We, taxi for take off 
Fake crews and units is dubbin 
Get ya whole clan wiped out, no scrubbin' 
For the decription givin, chapstick flappin' 
Pistol whipin', nigga rappin' 
Sell arms to keep 'em clappin' 
Gung ho chicks spueeze for me 
Crazy g's for me, to see cheese come easily for me 
In the same arenas 
Ain't gotta state his name, you seen us 
Sippin' on Bay Breeze's

Bitches love me for this disrespectful shit 
Fuck em, the only thing I'm with is large amounts,

Money the only thing that counts here 
By any means like Malcolm 
X marks the spot you know the outcome 
Income, never outdone 
Rap star, hit the stage dipped in tar 
Other crews muerto 
Can't fuck with this concerto 
Too fecicous 
So I drop new releases 
Till your crew deceases 
Screw your pieces, fuck you thesis 
Fuck your speeches, and fuck your beef 
'Cause when my crew aim, do more than brush ya teeth 
It'll split your shit, when it hit your shit 
If you don't want yo' shit hit 
Don't forget yo' shit 
We don't spar 
We aimin' all niggas to Allah

Sometimes, I run with mad niggaz who done time
Hit you with eight, from one nine, now you showin the vein
My shells is like information, go in your brain
Holdin my slug, before you squeeze em show em the love
Burn your fingertips so throw em a glove, understand me

Bought my first Role' from Manny

You not, get shot, get caught slippin like Dexter Manley

Sauce Money,"What you think you like me? you ain't like me motherfucker
You a punk
I been with made people, connected people
Who you been with? Chain snatching, jive-ass, maricon motherfuckers
Why don't you go get lost
Get out of here, go kick a freestyle or something

You're now tuned into the greatest
Motherfuckers can't beat us, join us, can't fade us, hate us
Can't touch it, fuck it, can't see em, try to be em
Both shows sold out your coliseum, 8th wonder
Locked rap for trey summers, poker faces with the aces under
Face one up, to take over, the break's over
Nigga I'm the god MC, me, Jay Hovah
Shit knocking, almost a crime, get Cochran
Banging to the hearse where my doctors hand
Hot land, FBI, DEA, I did crime, got away
They want to see me pay, motherfuckers better ride
If they try to plant, under the seat of my car
Even a half a gram, better flame those, plainclothes
Same goes for lame hoes, cocaine rapper
Rep ya game pros

We celebrate this, while you sitting back screaming you hate this
Try to rape this, get caught in my crime matrix
Spitting sperm inside of latex
You get, no respect like a child rapist
Delegate this, men just giving face lifts
Leave your melon spacious, career felon, no hiatus
Nor Caesar's, the CIA flooded my block with diseases
Informants, heating the spot up like global warming
Who start shit? my style is laced with arsenic
Odorless tasteless, cause of death is traceless
I know you want to see me wasted
You call the order, I'll be in hell
Team Roc sweater and ice water
Righteous, dominate the global, my life's a novel
Blazing in Barnes and Noble, idolize the vocals
Y'all niggas is local but that's evident
I'm resident evil, moving like ?

Millionaire that flow like water, rap niggas running
I, oughta applaud ya, clap at ya
Point the mac at yea, niggas caught up
Brought up in the rapture, my flows torture
Like a compound fracture, can't fuck with it
For the love of sex money and drugs
Affiliated with the sets tecs honies and thugs
Let the four power, rain on niggas like a spring shower
And bring flowers for the bodies that surround us
If you was looking you found us
Moving with speed, tried to play superman
Ended up like Chris Reeves
Paraplegic, precise minds like the Pharaoh's of Egypt
Shot through a barrel niggas narrowly weaved it
Keeping my team top seeded with the sweet 16's
Bulging out of my jeans, on the ten-speed weeded
Holding, ? shots with you like a secret
It's like a story never told, but believe it

Street anthem anchor, quick to trade shots just like a banker
Lick a round, niggas hit the ground like Sanka
I got ya screw face in forty-two ways, aim better
Than toothpaste, Jerry McGuire
""Show me the money"" like clue tapes
Run up in your spot with a few eights, zoning
Known men, home in, all of my homies condone sin
Four shots spin ya like chrome rims
Put a part right through your dome like the omen, foaming
White sheets got ya wrapped like a roman
Back in new york, honey wants it, just spit blood and talk funny
Niggas is cartoons, picture styles that's fully developed
Like dark rooms, hits fat, cub with a harpoon
Heat-seeking, grill hunting, still fronting?
Keep squeezing, fuck it, I leave the whole street wheezing
No motherfuckers hope I fail, and gotta provoke the frail
Got em scared to drop like soap in jail

Yeah, there you have it
Just think of ours as can't be touched, tested, whatever
Never disrespect this thing of ours

Sauce Money,"Back again and back again
I went from Marcy to Hollywood
And back again and back again
As a youth I used to hold the weed up
Old heads said I thought more like a soldier than a leader
In order to succeed I had to slow my speed up
Didn't listen to stuff took another puff of the chieva
They said believe us or not trust is somethin' you earn
With every mistake you make back to us you return
Probably would go Hollywood I thought he was jokin'
My first taste of fame I hit the first thing smokin'
All engulfed into honeys the pussy was tight
If she threw the pussy right I got mushy like
Damn baby I love you take all my cash
""You ain't got to lie Jay,"" you already gettin' the ass
She loved that I was a thug it turned her on
Soon as I got soft it turned her off
I got relaxed put my feet up start dissin' my friends
And that's when the ceiling fell in
I went from Marcy to Hollywood
And back again and back again
I went from Marcy to Hollywood
And back again and back again
I came through with the shines
Like the streets was blind
Didn't master my Algebra no caliber
Stick me? I was thinkin' how and for what
But reality bites like a thousand mutts
Nothin' worse than the person that's foul with guts
To stick you quicker

This brand new nigga
Yup this is the foulest this ain't Hollywood
It's the Wild West whoever guns is the loudest
That's who's the best now take ten steps and draw
Who dope can take ten steps and remain raw
Who has no regards for the law?
Me that's who now let me ask you
Did you not know if we all don't eat
Some day that we all would beef?
Did you know about the crabs in the barrow
They would hear me creep
It's a muthafuckin' war in these streets
I'm from the ghetto to the ghetto
And I'm back again I'm back again
I'm from the ghetto to the ghetto
And I'm back again I'm back again

As a youth I used to fold up
Old heads said I thought more like a leader than a soldier
Back in the days never no heat thought shit was cool
Good cat personified even went to school
Learned wild shit made me feel kinda live
Off of nothin' with this bullshit 9 to 5
I stayed broke made me easier to provoke
Ready to yoke the first muthafucka that joked
Same dude with the hard bottom
Went from laid back to locced out
From talk it over to t...I shot him
Ready to perish all the shit you cherish
Leave you the wettest I got a ""You die first,"" fetish
I can recall helpin' old chicks across the street
Now I help myself liftin' cats off they feet
Can't give a fuck nigga I just lost my moms
Why I need to feel something steel in both my arms

I'ma make it real easy for why'all. You got three different
Types of nigga. First cat, as a youth is real wild and
For whatever reason he hit the money or whatever,
Cooled out. You got one cat that's ghetto, grimy always
Remained ghetto. You know that type. Then, you got
One cat very smart young man. E'rybody wanted him
To be a lawyer doctor whatever. Pressure drove him crazy
He wiled out. Ha geah...

Yo Puff Daddy
Get off me
Ladies & gentlemen
You're about to witness something that you've never witnessed before
Sauce Money's in the house & he brought his man with him

I leave rap in a state of shock
Where to rock, from the figures still
Play the block with my niggas
Ill lush, game 20 pounds, but all my niggas still crush
Still stack chips galore
Chicks want out the ghetto, try to hit you raw
Better know that everything I love - roll back
Cop my first gold plaque, soon as my man blew
Still spittin' the fly, hits you can't do nigga
You ain't gainin', you game in, barely maintainin'
I push fly whips without strainin', my cliques smother
Get tougher, hits rougher, Puff is deep in the streets like Chris Tucker
My wrists cluster, on a mobile
P-Diddy, rap mogul, thought I told you that we don't stop
Thought I told you that when I drop, platinum plaques
I cop, push Bentley's without the tops, nigga

[Chorus] (Puff Daddy)

Try to see if you see what I see
Give my game & spit my G
When it's all done, stack, funds, & I'm the one
On top is where I be
Tell me, do you see what I see?
(When I look in your eyes, I see you hatin' inside, so tell me)
Do you see what I see?
(I know you're hopin' I'm blind, cause you don't want me to shine)

[Sauce Money]
No secret, undefeated, I'm top seeded
Whenever I drop hits, you don't want it, you need it
This a hot joint from Sauce, you feel cheated
Unanimous decision, love the way I freak it
Brooklyn, shogun, beat the 4-1
Niggas want to bite off my flow son
I don't think no one, got that, rock a hot track
Like me, nice to the Sauce? Naw
Spit rounds, it's rough did I mention the thorough?
BK forever representin' my borough
Push fly whips, quick to stack my chips
Too easy for you to understand my hits
When the album drops every pocket hold some
Sauce motherfuckin' forever, I told son
Hypnotic, heard the ? war 'fore I shot it
Better cop it, cause all that fly shit, I got it

(Chorus)

[PD]
I took rap by the throat & locked it
P-Diddy fixed all those who tried to stop it
Some of y'all tried to blast off, but couldn't rock it
If my flow ain't like a door, how could you knock it?

[Sauce Money] (PD)
As a matter of fact, yo don't you hate that? (hate that)
Whenever cats playa hatin' from way back (way back)
Mad at you, just because they whack (they whack)
And I bought your style, older than 8-track (8-track)

Only way to react though
Make hot joints & stack dough
Laughin' at your whack flow
Try to catch my G
Just so you can rap like me

Give 'em that feeling, Sauce Money for real and
Let her get on top if there's mirrors on the ceiling
Hit her so right that she want to throw rice

Shaking your tail just like a dragon here comes my worse flame

When he hit it first can I get it next, shit you the best
It ain't wack to be with both of us, mami actually
I'm Eddie Kane Jr., that nigga me!
You want me to feel what he feel when it's tight
And I know, he don't be doing it right
But it gets no liver than this, never lie on our dicks
Shit, we got nigga's rides on our wrists
Play your cards right you'll be driving the 6
Shopping all day hoppin' out in the Dist.
Popping the Crist, shit hoppin' outta your wrist
Popping your shit, New York's hottest bitch
From the ghetto to the Stiletto's
But you gotta do it two times like an echo, why y'all feelin' that
This is how we run it down the line
Nigga Sauce goes first Jigga next to rhyme

I see you got a lot to get off your chest
Coat, blouse, bra-don't talk me to death
Like murder's on your mind mami, off the dress

Last thing I need to know is what it costs for sex
What you need to know is if I lost respect
Don't have to worry if you do Sauce correct

It's a shame but, a lot been change since we came up
I used ta run wit them, now I got my guns for them
Treat my hollows like trash, strait dumpin' 'em

They thought they left a real nigga on his ass black
And that my numbers wouldn't rise like Nasdaq
And gotta re-half that, just pass that
We 'gon clash black for playin' the middle like ya ass crack
You can ball ova here, I play pass that
Exotic cats love ta talk peace when you blast back
No more fair ones, know you shot enuff of them
Don't really want to do it, now you gotta fuck wit 'em

And make ya real ugly like bitter beer face
Sendin' fake thugs back ta the essence

I dedicate this ta cats want they cheddar ta rise
Fifty grand too much, O.K. Seventy-Five
Sauce Money kinda cat you could never despise
Hit the streets lookin' like you a betta disquise
Get a grip, I'm the preacher, you dance wit the devil
Whoever my eyes focus on is not on my level
Not even close, ex-girlfriends hatin' ta see it
You can give me brain or get out, take it or leave it
Relax wit side who, max wit my crew
Operation gettin' money, that's what I do
Insecure artists pay me not ta spit
Show me fake love and then try ta fly if they hit
They could feel it in they bones, 'cause when I drop my shit
All hell'll break loose, that's how hot I get
I rock big in the summer, witout missin' the block
When I want to get M, then I listen ta Pac
Scarface when I'm laid back, whippin' the 3
If I want to hear that shit, then I listen ta me
Stick in the key, turn the knob and open the door
Prevokin' a war, cats saw us smokin' the 4, fo' sure

Look, I like ta come through and run up in 'em all night
Bring my man too, Mami if it's alright
I'ma a big one, but I like ta ball out
Sip Henny, smoke dro 'til you fall out
Hit 'em wit that Marcy maneuver, makin' 'em droppin'
I ain't met one yet make me take her shoppin'
But I might 'cause I gotta lotta cash ma
Platinum Navigator glock when the stash ha
Rolex, Cuban Link, now the riddle comin'
Do I know about 69, a little sumthin'
I like ya point-blank style, you in it ta win it
But before I go downtown, gimme a minute
You got ta shower up, make sure no dirt in it
I got the Pro-Fo, neva eva squirtin' it
That's a thong, (damn), baby you just hurtin' shit
Bring that thing here baby, show me what you workin' wit

I heard a rumor in the street, muthafucka was gifted
Up and comin nigga, might need to get with
One cat from BK, put him on your hitlist
Sauce Money, fat nigga rip shit
Heard him on a Clue? tape, loved the way he kicked it
All of a sudden mad labels on his dick
But muthafuckas who bit it but couldn't fight it forget it
Couldn't write it or spit it cause they couldn't fuck with it
Then the Puff shit happened, the whole shit shifted
Tribute to Biggie, God bless your spirit
Made a mark, now we need a place for the nigga
Marcy, son - faced off with Jigga
Now he only spittin for cars that's kitted
Convicted felons and muthafuckas acquitted
Never for foul snitches, but those who style riches
Ghetto crack sellin pros and buckwild bitches
First thing they want to know: what's fuckin with this shit?
Jay-Z told em, look how many he sold em
'99's my time to shine and control em
Spread ones with sons, guns, I still hold em
Fuck the law, this is what's in store
When the album drop, we gon' rush the floor
I tell em hit it, every song, come on, we all spit it
Get on with it, with all my niggas screamin, ""We did it""

They call me money-earner, received more blows than Tina Turner
Like the top of the stove Sauce keep a burner
Release somethin that'll heat your sternum
Flow the sickest, take a AIDS patient a whole week to learn em
So precise, got beef with surgeons
Feel naked without profanity, every sentence keep a curse in
Nothin is bound to touchin my sound
The consensus in the street: he ain't fuckin around
Got a lot of shit to pop, two things when it drop:
Muthafuckas gonna cop and niggas will get shot
But this is just for the record, though
Niggas will get naked slow
If your heat cocked, check it, yo
No shit, squeeze till your hammer go click

I don't give a fuck about nothin
And you either

This is for you Tommy Tuckers, you know em, neighborhood suckers
We all got em, stupid motherfuckers
want to-be rap brothers--ruggers--, bitin ass niggas who love us
Idolize us, eat a dick, can't touch us
Slick nigga, far from a snitch nigga
Or bitch nigga, quick to click on a sick nigga
Where it's at nigga, roam with the chrome nigga
Fat nigga, bat against your dome nigga
I'm that nigga, one you can't even crush
Type of cat shit in your crib and don't even flush
Kind of nigga when you see him that you wantin to touch
On some Russell Simmons shit, but ain't in no Rush
Cause when the shit hit the fan, who the hell can you trust?
Duckin the blow? Really? Where the fuck can you go?
Who the fuck can you get when I'm ready to spit
When you hear my name I make you hate spaghetti and shit
Spit and aim with the fifth, if I get caught in a lie
Ten shots light you up like the 4th of July
I don't need your help, bitch, I got support from the sky
Quite fluid, I'm a definite, you might do it
Bitches, guns and ones, got a right to it
Fuck up against the wall, I send your ass right through it
Tattooed like Mike did it, leave you lightheaded
Swear to God, y'all niggas better act like Christ said it

Hey yo yo who the hell this Sauce nigga think he talkin to, man?
Arrogant bastard
Chubby motherfucker
You think you alla that, man?
I can't even stand to hear this shit no more, man

Hey you know what motherfuckers?  It don't stop there
I'ma solidify my rap spot til it's not fair
Nothin to do with it, niggas say, ""I'm glad it was them""
Somethin to do with it, niggas gon' be glad it was them
Inspire men, or some R&B shit and fire ten
With Mya in it, gettin head from the way the tires spin
My whole circle is hot, like when the dryer spin
You just a cub nigga, trapped off in a lion's den
Lookin for love? Fuck you, you found hate, stupid
I run with a 112 kids who raped Cupid
Plus got head, see my eyes, bloodshot red
Hands where I can cee like Busta said
I lead by example, nigga - must I led?
Last thing you hear is shots and every cuss I said
Real niggas walkin away, paramedics walkin your way
Crackin jokes while I'm talkin to Jay
Gettin head from four dimes from New York in a day
This flow here is stainless, what you thought it was clay?
Thought it was gold?  Only thing it bought was your soul
Split your wig, then confuse you for that fork in the road
I don't play with wack rappers, I slay wack rappers
Only aim to decay and spray wack rappers
If niggas want to front, and say fuck my shit
Don't buy my album, fuck you and suck my dick

Better forget it, just to be specific
Cause if you the one, then I'm too terrific
Better relax, 'fore you get it twisted
It's to the death now, if you make the shitlist

Forget your lingo, and how you primadonna niggas mingle
I'm real money, fold up, you funny money, jingle
News flash, here's a hot-ass item to bring you
Had a car, Roley, and house before my first single
I know how y'all niggas roll, quiet as a tear
My album ain't even dropped, and I'm writer of the year
I got shit, find me in your record store under 'hot shit'
While you register, under 'not shit'
I drop hits in the streets and triggers'll blow
Show after show, watch him, big as I roll
We all know the rules, fool, jewels, bitches and dough
Did you hear?  I'm the fattest, nicest nigga you know
And I kill a muthafucka just to gain a buck
Confuse niggas, bust guns, and aim to duck
If you happen to sell half weight your game is luck
Who write for who?  y'all sound the same, lame as fuck
Can't control it, tried to sell it, heard it the way you told it
Who bought it?  And if you sold it?  Extort it
For somethin I might have smoked, roll it
Never get grimy as me, I fuck a rattle snake if a nigga hold it
I got both sides of the fence in minute
I got hits with Jay, Clark, Primo, and none of my wheels is rented
I got a smash with Puff bout to drop any minute",Middle Finger U,1999

Lot of different faces, most of them killers
Counted lot of figures, niggas know I'm raw
Off day for sure, packin a .44
Gather round the lightning, now you feelin the volts
Might not see me, but you see the results

That's how I roll, niggas like we know
Hit the spot heavily armed, me and Reno
Hemmed up with three hoes, sippin on a bottle
Cut a check, suck a dick, that's my motto

They can suck a dick with ghonorrhea and that's for real

Let the window down slow, kid just bought the farm
Two chicks in a Yugo, damn, it's a false alarm
Not on this joint, Sauce usually calm with the grammar
But right now I'm like baking soda, armed with a hammer
Summertime comin, now they wonder what I drive next
Represent for big niggas, 3-4-5-X
Wide body jeeps, little dimes puff the herb slow
Know the drill, bubblegum, rubbers in the 3rd row

Through the crowd thugged out, took my stance and I spit
Screamed on this one chick like, ""Bitch, dance to my shit""
Part the club with elbows, bump a nigga, love that
Nigga read my eyes and it said 'step the fuck back'
This Gorilla Hill shit, we don't give two fucks
On Gorilla Hill, kid, you tryin to do too much
Must've had a sixth sense, how he knew I clutch chrome?

but if they sleep (what?) hell is where I'ma send em
I know it's beef cause I don't want to be rhymin wit em
They want to act like BITCHES, time to split em
What the deal Ma?  Heard I was boss ha?
On the real, want to hear it from the Sauce ha?
You like the way I do it?  I just gotta spit
I got flow doughs hoes and a lot of hits

Chorus: Sauce Money (repeat 4X)

MC rhymin, chart climbin
Together we talk the talk, forever we walk the walk

[Sauce Money]
In the trial my niggaz'll squeeze for the general
MP's holdin my heat, nigga run wild
I dial, executioners, go the extra mile
Nigga cock that, lose a screw when it pop black
Never provoke toast, niggaz get ghost most
You couldn't be my family, we never spoke close
You spit that ""yo"" shit, I say ""nosotros""
Don't fuck with them dudes, think them niggaz homos
I'm talkin the bad bitches, you on some funny shit
You go for broke?  I go for gettin money kid
I grab your homebase, now she give new honey head
To all you Donnie Brasco's, I'm Sonny Red
I split a weak nigga cheek quick, with one of those
Fuck a physique wrapped tighter than mummy clothes
Off looks alone probably get to touch em all light
but because of the flow, now I fuck em all night

Chorus

[Sauce Money]
You like dough baby?  Work hard and you can get that
But in the meantime, let me hit that
Get you down on all fours, like a Kit-Kat
I'm tryin to split that, shouldn'ta did that
In and out with the quickness now what could make the brother stop?
Nothin, well maybe if the rubber pop
And even then that might not slow me down
I'm bout to go to town, want to come? Show me now
Singular most MC's bringin your toast
I run roughshod rip rap stars and roast
I don't brag or boast, I only speak in facts
And if I say you seven days, how weak/week is that?
Fatal to niggaz that's unable to ride wit me
You better decide who side or collide wit me
The very last rapper tragically he died swiftly
You been warned motherfuckers, now come and get me

Sauce Money,"Five star general spit, hush them niggas
I star, why even discuss them niggas?
By far, I'm the shit, flush them niggas
Fuck them niggas, I'm a crush them niggas

Chrome heater, street sweeper
Gun shots get deeper, cough up a lung and a liter
Twelve shot Nine now, one of my new pets
And when these twins squeeze it sounds like duets

Nigga burn, yeah, my Fam learn to earn
We got shit locked with no key holes to turn
Platinum Navigator, easy when you earn a buck
It's like a big fuckin' beeper when you turn it up

Shit vibratin'
Hoes titties bouncin', rubbin' all on my shit, bitch try waitin'

Billboards triangles and shit

And who's Jeter? The Don Juan for you Don Con's
In the double Nine Yukon, tote two arms
From Brooknam 'til death do
And I bet you when I spit shots they connect to dead you

Lil' monkeys postin' for wreck
They get trapped up and extorted for your toast and your vest
I'm no joke, so laugh and be laughin' to death
And if you think it's so simple, you'll be gassed and then left

It's the game tight nigga, chain two below
I'm a Gigolo Mommy, the fame I ain't fo'
The foes I don't hate, hoes I don't chase
Henny I drink straight, my money is big faced

For you small change niggas who playin' to ball
I got six digits now, what you playin' it for?
I'm the youngest out of Marcy and the shit don't stop
Steppin' up to the top 'bout to have shit locked.

My automatic stoutest be off balance
Gun with the silence
Outta state, mad mileage
Your crew wild but we the wildest

Switch my trigger finger often to prevent a callus
For me many Men hold malice, I react with violence
Since we tryin' to double the dough, we double the sins
Even the gnats is double now lookin' like fraternal twins

The rap killings be serial
The FEDS tried to link Da Rainjahz to the crime
Through the use of genetic material
I'm takin' all bets, who want it?

Wise, hard to touch, weavin' shit like Prince Naseem Hamed
The flow is Ten karat and your lyrics is poor
Big horse, plus you walk like your salads been tossed
Smoke the explosion, rock second hand gold that's stolen

Straight haul off and smack a nigga just for posin'
Bleed Hennessey, rhyme like there's Ten of me
So you remember me?
Every verse, I'm on should be considered a felony

Why the fuck niggas be hatin'? I don't even know
Niggas need to go ahead with them outdated flows
Da Rainjahz 'cause precipitation, and we rain in this bitch like
Hurricane Mitch

Fuck the fame, son, I'm in it for the dough and another whip
Ghetto cracked out on some other shit
Style switch, leave the whole city dark like the Mothership
Y'all know the half, I hold the Nine with the rubber grip

Seen less, y'all re-imported by the government
If I wasn't rappin' I'd be on the corners bubblin'
Doublin' my cream on a triple beam
Instead I keep the team tight and feel like ain't shit gon' divide us

Not even riches, not even bitches
Look now, niggas of the World stay paintin' pictures
Of the inner-city realness
Who can relate? roll and fat one and feel this

Roc-a-Fella, LOX, takin the streets over motherfuckers
Don't get it twisted
Yo, aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo
Yo shut the fuck up 'fore I blast and Banned From TV your ass
With no mask, look at the camera like what?
Yeah I did it like them sick white boys the court committed
To the death of me, I'm spaz like I'm on Ecstasy
Drop 100 bars for real like I'm lookin for a deal
If I ain't hungry, who the fuck is, I'm worse than them African kids
I ain't straight til my numbers match the Motorola ?bid?
And walk the streets up in ? ? like I don't fuckin care
If I ain't strapped that means I took em off my Nike Airs
Get off mine, y'all talk shit like little children
When I ride mine like bitched when I walk up in the building
Cause I catch tans in the winter, with wild whores
Jet-skiin, while you keep warm at corner stores
I make it hot, floodin your block, the best way
Professionally, they'll find poison in your X-Ray
As I get roasted lookin at Biggie posted on my wall
Takin shots of Louie til I fall
Nuttin to lose, just load the clip up in the groove
And kick rhymes to the poster, til I swear Big move
My team, you would think was on Thorazine
How we floss and don't give a fuck what it's cost-ing

Yo, yo, pressure bust pipes, it's time to apply it now
Pick out a quiet town and tie it down
Make niggaz lock it down, y'all know where to buy it now
Beanie Mac I supply it now
My squad roll deep, in foreign cars with two seats
Couple of five's, a six, a few Jeeps
Bag enough coke to last a few weeks
In case niggaz wanna test, vest and a few heats
You really wanna test my name?  And test my game?
Until you have me, test my aim?
Y'all niggaz nuts, like testricles
Hit you up in your apartment buildin vestibule
Perhaps it's best for you, to keep on walkin
Heat from the noggin, keep on sparkin
Platinum prezzie, Bezzie, stay sparklin
Cop off the lot never see me at the auction
Pint of Bacardi darken, when it's hawkin
Out on the strip, until I reach the margin
Not tryin to meet the Seargeant, at the precinct
Eatin cheese sandwiches, down for the weekend
Locked up with dirty white boys and Ricans

Now if I kill you I probably do ten in the box
Come down on appeal then I'm killin your pops
You feelin The LOX, nigga why you grillin The LOX
If this rap shit don't work niggaz still in the spot
You bring it to me, I gotta lose your family
Gangstas don't die, they get chubby, and move to Miami
Shit is deep now dog but it gets deeper
Fuck it, the weather's nice and the price is much cheaper
I put it on tape, you gon' buy it, I put it in a bag
You gon' try it, y'all niggaz can't deny it
Lot of cats still tryin to study my last bounce
Tell you what, get a beat tape and a half ounce
They got me where I can't be without my large gat
Teflon long sleeve, and my hardhat
Don't matter if I'm openin up, or headline
Doin the speed limit or pushin red lines
Six months in the county or fed time
I'ma be the 'Kiss nigga, until it's bedtime
Anything I'm on is a classic, any nigga
Ever had beef with, son is a bastard
Anytime I spit, spit acid, L.O.X.
Ruffryder you heard?  We got the game mastered

I told you the pain was comin
You wouldn't listen
You tried to play me like a joke?
Now who got the last laugh?
Now take these bullets with you to hell

You motherfuckers is sick, don't think Sauce the shit
So many niggaz on my nuts I thought I lost my dick
Picture me fallin off, I'm camera shy
Hammers fly, might miss you, but your man'll die
What's the difference?  Either way I'm stunnin your crew
I fuck to win, y'all niggaz comin to lose
Somethin to prove?  Spit it, we can have a sprayoff
I lay off wet niggaz and kill em on my day off
Ain't nuttin for me to bust a trey off
Murder the whole month of April nigga, just to take May off
Run with more Germans than Adolf, you light crews
Now I concentrate on your camp, like Jews
Flow hot like a heatwave bitch
Whips fatter than them shits they beat slaves with
I'm a meal stackin nigga who pull quick, still packin
For you Phil Jackson niggaz on that Bull

I don't give a fuck who you are, so fuck who you are
I don't care about a pretty bitch, watch or a car
I don't care about your block and whoever you shot
I don't care about your album and whenever it drop
I don't care about your past if I did I woulda asked
I'm too busy lightin 'dro with a whole lotta hash
Far as this rap shit, I'm ten steps ahead of niggaz
Shootin backwards, just for practice
Ride or die nigga, hoppin in your casket
Bout to go to hell with you, blow the L with you
Tell the whole world I'm spittin let em know the shells hit you
I tell niggaz quick, suck dick and get a glock
My name ring bells like Sunday at twelve o'clock
I'm half past seven, bust six then eleven
You know me, slide my man my joint say reload me
I ruffryde and pop a fella for Roc-a-Fella
Jay (what the fuck) spendin mozzarella

I know pop you can't stand us cause you cock them hammers
Run in your crib, no prisoners, pop your grandma
Locked in the slammer?  Nope, popped up in Atlanta
Crossed up in a drop I popped up the antenna
Whoa, watch your manners when my veins pop like scanners
Like raindrops you hear the thunder when I cock the cannon
Big thang, big chains, ain't shit changed
Get brained in the four dot six Range
Shit main, switch lanes
Every town I hit, switch planes, bitch flipped big caine
Flow with no cut, you take it in vain/vein to the brain
Muh'fukas is noddin and throwin up, you know that
You don't wanna owe that man
He'll hit you, get the picture?  Kodak man
Gotta, love for war, I don't floss no more
I just sit on my money til I'm above the law
How the fuck you gonna stop us with your measly asses
We don't stop at the tolls we got EZ passes, nigga
Multiple cars and divas with D-classes
Iceberg sweat with I.B. on the elastic

Don't get it fucked up 'cause Sauce calm wit his grandma
'cause I'm like baking soda bitch, I'm armed with a hammer
And when I'm strapped fool, fuck your brother
'cause like Jimmy Ivene in Virginia you in the scope like a muthafucka
Fine, niggas don't wanna let him shine
Niggas hate that fact Sauce don't give a fuckin' nine
Soon as he ran his mouth, one tre pound seven to nine
Guess who's the odd man out
I guess we got something in common
I'm just a little more calm when
I'm about to split your arm in
Put a hole so big in your noggin
That if you God body, you can fit the whole sun, moon and star in
You starvin' for more lyrics I know
Steady robbin' all them lyrics I flow
I'm Sadam-ing all you niggas fo sho
You betta know I'm a true nigga, please do nigga
Betta inquire from a few niggas
'cause bitch, I done shit on quite a few and quieted a few niggas
Get a grip, dead four-fifth in the hip
Slip, never picture me fallin' nigga don't trip

Stoned is the way of my walk
In a mini-mack eleven, the tone when I talk
When I spray niggas pray, lay on the sidewalk
Color blood red, body outlined in chalk
My rhymes, two zigs all nines
Hard hit when they spit, split wigs double time
This eightball's a strict nine
Tear apart body parts when I spark nine
At they head hard lodged in they damn spine
Leaves emcee's like Christopher Reeves, crippled and cryin'
Shittin' in a bag and a breath away from dyin'
Nigga I'm - the epitomy of raw rhymes
The epitomy of rap rock
I make a block party bop to the sounds of a hot glock
From New York down to Georgia it don't stop
Killer Kill from Addamsville with a hot glock
Blaaat!

They say murder is the case they wanna throw me
I guess these muthafuckas don't know me
O.G. rock called a yay slanger
VA's finest
Underground muthafuckin' king call me ""Your Highness""
I tear your sinus with this gun powder
Wipe your tears with the steal, no fear this is real niggas
Here is the deal: you clear in this field
And ain't stoppin' until every hater here is revealed
'cause we don't need no fuckin' clearance to peel
Or shortstoppers runnin' and the fear is revealed
So - get off this block homie handle your corner
Keep all your heroin, rocks and you mariju-wana
I'm like a - character on the Sopranos or the Wire
You'se a - big pussy lil' man, it's over, retire
'cause the - clock's tickin', your days is done
But we know all them lil' different fuckin' ways you slum
But it's trill downtown, your momma's all free
Your house is sugar-layin' with your wife and your seed
Yes indeed, Big Bun is on a home invasion
You gon' bleed on my gun from your dome abrasions
'cause my chrome is blazin', I'm naughty crunk
Got the bop gun like Sir Nose D'Voiddoffunk
Bitch, I pull a sawed-off from under the waist
Open your eyes muthafucka, you got thunder to face
Fuck rest, we gon' lay these muthafuckas to waste
You bit the pully nigga tell me, how the fuck did it taste
From my gun...
Big guns, big power
M. Woods, sixth hour
Berettas, Tauruses, Rugers
Smith and Wesson's, glocks and lugers
AK's, are 15's
Mack elevens and M-16's
High caliber, so why try it?
You live by it, so you die by it
A muthafuckin' gun...

Who's the man with the strap in his hand
Homie's stolen semi-autos and contrabands
All day every day, crossin' my hood in day
In a six-trey with my nigga Kay Slay
Dub the law scan, the infrared scanner
Hangin' out the window, hittin' em up with the bandana
And I can't stand a snitch so I - clean the lid
Just in case them bitch niggas wanna sing with this
I stay on the trigger, 'cause lames hate me nigga
They can't pay me nigga, where my lay dates nigga
Where AK one-on-one so thirty shot
Nine millimeter Melindas aimed ready to send ya

And pride made me kill Wayne Growe when the heat came
I don't smut but stimulation is good
I keep the hammer with me, Joey's renovatin' the hood
Difference between us, I'm gettin' loot on tours
Good shoes on the Beem, you got a boot on yours
Dudes with no names wanna put an end to me
But doggs, I'm readin' between the lines, the whole game's in parenthesis
Talk about models and how you with somethin'
When you really shootin' air balls, you ain't hittin' nothin'
Nathan, through the strip, O.G.'s blazin'
Street niggas slowly hatin' on Joey so amazin'
And hood niggas knowin' what up
Either holdin' you down or holdin' you up, throwin' it up
Oh!

[Hak Ditty]
Aiiyo, fuck the dumb shit, when the guns spit
One clip'll have your whole strip laid down
Thirty-two shots to your block, I had that shit caged down
And before you blink, I let off eight rounds
This the ro-yal I ain't playin'
I'm takin' this over, so y'all either layin' or dying
And I won't hesitate to blaze the iron
You cocksuckers is chillin' with a ragin' lion
I see them dudes every day, when I'm racin' by 'em
Or on the curb poppin' bottles while they hatin' and eyein'
Uh, whether the slider or the highrider
I keep my block rocker, glock under the blue dosser
Far as Philly, it's no question to who's liver
I'm hotter, Hak Ditty, block locker
Fully prepared
I hope y'all fully aware that y'all niggas got a problem this year

mad man reigned over major alliance 

your world revolved around gold, cars and diamonds 

sluts and scars , draggin behind bars still 

the wake up call, face off the jail bully 

takin your man hood, thought you had a pussy 

come home seen your man, now the lies arise 

tellin your man you was fightin niggas twice your size 

your conscious is feelin it, sippin a brew 

2 years you got screwed, by the system and a stiff one 

mental swollen and your manhood stolen 

wrecked and got dugout for the price of gold

To all those congested, my job raw never clean

I mark your mistake as soon as you're rested, I heard of ya
Unattended for your double breasted, bulletproof vest kid
Time is money well invested, burning your press kit
Ya HEARD me, chic-ow, bless it and pass it leftwards
Never protested, the living proof manifested
Winkled your face, you better press it, menage-a-trois
Put fist in thought, care to test it?  If you dare I swear
Motionless, I throw a stare in the eyes of uncommon wise soldier
Rise like Nike, shares growing older, snowball effect to snow boulder
Show you love nigga, I'm iceberg with cold shoulder
No time for your manic, hazy rap attack partner
Future darker than black permanent black... marker
I part you from existence on solid ground
Only twelve inch but long distance, that's all I frown
Is we hell or is we heaven bound?
I bomb the target without a sound
Ain't nobody left around to hear it
Sipping fine wine and spirits on summer days
By the South Pacific, cheddar sound better when specific
Cheddar look better when explicit
Cheddar get better when statistics rise like mama biscuits
All 'n all, I'm having fun with gun
'Cause world gave me gun, detonate the shells with my tongue
I'm young plus I'm well hung
Threat to intellect, also got your prize possession sprung
I ride the fine line between yours and mine, check the design

Peep my shines coming from behind
I'm high beaming in your rear view
Get out the left lane before I steer through
Ain't even trying to hear you
It was important 'til you thought I feared you
Naw, loosen your bra bitch
Never rest until I'm considered, the high exalted
Even then I'll still be bitter, sipping on malted
Through the speech, now it's time to walk it
This potent poet, who only spit it if he know it
Prefer to show it to the hardest of hip hop artist
If you a baby making baby, finish what you started and be a MAN
God damn, resort to plan be	 sucking on candy
For delicate procedure, no time for leisure
The fine line between yours and mine, freak the design
Bre-X cats wondering how rhyme turn sublime
Peep my shines coming from behind
I'm high beaming in your rear view, CRASH
I stop at nothing, my blood stream pumping nothing but utter destruction
Towards cats I describe in this rap production
Suffering from mal concussions, you head bangers catching repercussion
First impression had you lustin'

All emcee's falled when I heard the albums droppin'
Nuttin but the hottest hip-hop rap concoction
Rap's in a state of emergency, it's shockin'
I produce joints that loosen up the socket
Crowd surf through the mosh pit on some rock shit
Bang your head to this, pump your fist if your feelin' it
Ride the fuck out, bust a clip for the fuck of it

I (Pause) like Run and Jason Mizell
The emcee is me, host for the night
Papa Doc, only thing I don't choke on the mic
I choke a bitch out if my gwap ain't correct
Then with my giant hancock, I'll get the cheque
I love trucks but drop-tops is the best
From the Beemers, Benz, now Rolex - watch me
Haha, she like ""Red so cool""
Any nigga after me, it's a deja vu
Doc stay in the paint like A.I. shoes
Just watch how a one tonner made a move, dig it!

Hop in my truck and roll up the window
A-yo, you know what you in for
Once we turn the corner, light up the endo
A-yo, a-yo, a-yo
Yes she with me getting low like a limbo
Roll with Gs and we'll show you how to get dough
Third degree, let it burn with my kinfolk
A-yo, a-yo, a-yo

Who these corner store rappers slinging cracks in my hall?
Mama's in the kitchen cooking cat, rat and dog
Me, I want a little something, y'all could have it all
I tryna walk before I crawl and move this package in my draws
That's why I push the pedal to the muh'fuckin floor
With ten per cent method, only plug something poor
And still I keep it funky like four plus one more
Get this money like ""In God We Trust"", trust your boy
It's a given, living this life it was written
Especially for me, I'm what the recipe is missing
Blow my piff in the air, key the ignition
Then get to lane switching, plucking ashes off the clip and
Mammy wanna ride and play the Bonnie to my Clyde
If anybody try to (Kill Bill), it'll probably be the bride
Like all jokes aside, I'm serious with mine
And now I'm on this grind like Method Man in his prime

[Chorus]

Yo, I got my swagger on and I feel great
Funk Doc be in the hood like Enfamil cases
I network on MySpace real late
Hoping my album make me another Bill Gates
Around my crib, look how I live
I'm a slob but crip niggas say I get biz
Anywhere I did a show women saying that I'm
""So aaaaaa-ma-zing""

Yeah, another mic, another night and the day's end
Another heist, another kite in the state pen
My state business shit, y'all dudes just break wind
New York nigga, either you're made mice or made men
I do the dirt that keep my hand on the work
I got the other hand up Mona Lisa's skirt
My aim one since day one stop
How many shots will it take to make son drop?

Saukrates,"I'm on the run for my life
It's seems that everything that you said was right
Has come undone, lost my sight
But have you ever thought you've done your best

When you were under the gun, that's right
I know. I've seen this place before
But it's never been so fun
Never been so fun

I've been on the run, this shadow weighs a ton
It's starting to make sense to me
I can't really make you love me
No, no, you know I can't really make you love me, no, no

I've been on the run, my shadow weighs a ton
I know I found the recipe for me
But I can't really make you love me
No, no, you know I can't really make you love me, no, no

You know I'm haunted on overseas
Haunted on each coast
Play them like Ebaneeza
I made them see the ghost

Back from the future donned in Japanese kimonos
Even though the streets show love, try to see me grow
I often see me floatin', but my shadow it weighs a ton
Call it baggage, I use it all to advantage

But I can't make you love me
This time it's on you
And you can't try to deny, these words when they're true
I'm on the run

I've been on the run, this shadow weighs a ton
It's starting to make sense to me
I can't really make you love me
No, no, you know I can't really make you love me, no, no

I've been on the run, my shadow weighs a ton
I know I found the recipe for me
But I can't really make you love me
No, no, you know I can't really make you love me

Oh no, ay yo, cud get to steppin'
Your tongue is like a weapon
This is cappin' from heaven and yet so are ye's

Since the age of seventeen
I've been taking apart microphones
You've been taking apart men you've blown
With glowing skeleton bones

In the closet, animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat between us
But you need a woman's glorious style on diamond to fetus
Carry my penis, I'm like the man in the moon
When we kissed then you soon on the run

I've been on the run, this shadow weighs a ton
It's starting to make sense to me
I can't really make you love me
No, no, you know I can't really make you love me, no, no

I've been on the run, my shadow weighs a ton
I know I found the recipe for me
But I can't really make you love me
No, no, you know I can't really make you love me, no, no

I can't really make you love me
I can't really make you love me
I can't really make you love me
I can't really make you love me

Fix my Ray-Bans, I hit the hotel
Do my show, get my money, hit the hotel
Sittin' at the hotel like ""Oh well!""

that this time bomb is about to explode
Got me wishin' that it was different than money, contradiction is funny
I just told y'all to play the game if y'all wan' eat
The truth is it's what you make it
That's why I got my baby girl naked
Long before I bought them tickets to Turks and Caicos

Hits like Nickelback singing with The Diplomats
Written by Max Martin swinging with the whiffle bat
Hear the pistol blast then I hit the track
Running like a Kenyan cause I’m Kenyan (ask my mama)
Yeah I’m running like a Kenyan see I’m running like Obama
On that ticket, this is wicked as that Broadway play with the witches in it
Tell me who’s the sickest, kid I’m putting on a clinic: listen
You don’t know about really touching the lyrics
So touching when I’m touching on any subject I’m fearless
They can’t stomach it, I’m loving it munching nuggets in Paris
See the throne? That’s my zone don’t let me even get near it
Please, I’m ahead of my time, wait, now I’m ahead of the times
Sped up ahead of the beat, speaking of time whenever I head to the meet
I’m always ahead of the heat, head of my class egg head with glasses
Leaving these heads with a classic, now let me just head to the back
With my head, I’m a nap for a bit

Yo, I know you used “Keep Shinin” to chop chicks, don’t lie yo!
I know geeks rhyming that soft ish is the hotness right now
You refined and you all slick, talking français some
“Je suis dining with chopsticks”
You’re sly dog, and you’re from Africa right?
That’s amazing. That’s really great, fascinating
See I got fans that say “Oh hey Shad, I hate rap but I like you,”
Well I hate that, but I like you at least I like that you
Like me so I won’t spite you, it’s not your fault you’re a white dude
Likes white music I like too, just don’t be surprised by my IQ
Please, it's like back in high school they said “highbrow”
I said, “hi who?” That Shakespeare, that’s a haiku
I like the high road so I was like dude that’s basic
That’s like crude but you’re old placed to my iTunes
Use your common sense, matter fact use Common Sense
For that matter use Ice Cube, don’t think that we nice too
Cus we don’t look like you, cus we don’t know how to tie ties
And our grandparents weren’t tycoons? Please, lemme finish my Thai Food

Saul Williams,"Through meditation I program my heart 
To beat breakbeats and hum basslines on exhalation 
I burn seven day candles that melt 
Into twelve inch circles on my mantle  
And I can fade worlds in and out with my mixing patterns 
Letting the Earth spin as I blend in Saturn 
Niggaz be like spinning windmills, braiding hair 
Locking, popping, as the sonic force 
Of the soul keeps the planets rocking 
The beat don't stop when, soulless matter blows 
Into the cosmos, trying to be stars 
The beat don't stop when, Earth sends out satellites 
To spy on Saturnites and control Mars 
'Cause niggaz got a peace treaty with Martians 
And we be keepin em up to date with sacred gibberish 
Like ""sho' nuff"" and ""it's on"" 
The beat goes on, the beat goes on, the beat goes ""ohm"" 

And I roam through the streets of downtown Venus 
Trying to auction off monuments of Osiris' severed penis 
But they don't want no penis in Venus 
For androgynous cosmology sets their spirits free 
And they neither men nor women be 
But they be down with a billion niggaz who have yet to see 
That interplanetary truth is androgynous 
And they be sending us shout outs through shooting stars 
And niggaz be like, ""Whattup?"" and talking Mars 
'Cause we are solar and regardless of how far we roam from home 
The universe remains our center, like ""ohm"" 

I am no Earthling, I drink moonshine on Mars 
And mistake meteors for stars cause I can't hold my liquor 
But I can hold my breath and ascend like wind to the black hole 
And play galaxaphones on the fire escapes of your soul 
Blowing tunes through lunar wombs, impregnating stars 
Giving birth to suns, that darken the skins that skin our drums 
And we be beating infinity over sacred hums 
Spinning funk like myrrh until Jesus comes

And the moon drips blood and eclipses the sun 
And out of darkness comes a

Whereas, breakbeats have been the missing link connecting the diasporic
community to its drum woven past
 Whereas  the quantised drum has allowed the whirling mathematicians to
calculate the ever changing distance between rock and stardom.
Whereas the velocity of the spinning vinyl, cross-faded, spun backwards, and
re-released at the same given moment of recorded history , yet at a
different moment in time's continuum has allowed history to catch up with
the present.

We do hereby declare reality unkempt by the changing standards of dialogue.
Statements, such as, ""keep it real"", especially when punctuating or
anticipating modes of ultra-violence inflicted psychologically or physically
or depicting an unchanging rule of events will hence forth be seen as
retro-active and not representative of the individually determined is.

Furthermore, as determined by the collective consciousness of this state of
being and the lessened distance between thought patterns and their secular
manifestations, the role of men as listening receptacles is to be increased
by a number no less than 70 percent of the current enlisted as vocal
aggressors.

Motherfuckers better realize, now is the time to self-actualize
We have found evidence that hip hops standard 85 rpm when increased by a
number as least half the rate of it's standard or decreased at ¾ of it's
speed may be a determining factor in heightening consciousness.

Studies show that when a given norm is changed in the face of the
unchanging, the remaining contradictions will parallel the truth.

Equate rhyme with reason, Sun with season

Our cyclical relationship to phenomenon has encouraged scholars to erase the
centers of periods, thus symbolizing the non-linear character of cause and
effect
Reject mediocrity!

Your current frequencies of understanding outweigh that which as been given
for you to understand.
The current standard is the equivalent of an adolescent restricted to the
diet of an infant.
The rapidly changing body would acquire dysfunctional and deformative
symptoms and could not properly mature on a diet of apple sauce and crushed
pears
Light years are interchangeable with years of living in darkness.
The role of darkness is not to be seen as, or equated with, Ignorance, but
with the unknown, and the mysteries of the unseen.

Our music is our alchemy
We stand as the manifested equivalent of 3 buckets of water and a hand full
of minerals, thus realizing that those very buckets turned upside down
supply the percussion factor of forever.
If you must count to keep the beat then count.
Find you mantra and awaken your subconscious.
Curve you circles counterclockwise
Use your cipher to decipher, Coded Language, man made laws.
Climb waterfalls and trees, commune with nature, snakes and bees.
Let your children name themselves and claim themselves as the new day for
today we are determined to be the channelers of these changing frequencies
into songs, paintings, writings, dance, drama, photography, carpentry,
crafts, love, and love.
We enlist every instrument: Acoustic, electronic.
Every so-called race, gender, and sexual preference.
Every per-son as beings of sound to acknowledge their responsibility to
uplift the consciousness of the entire fucking World.

Acid-wash Guess with the leather patches
Sportin' the white Diadoras with the hoodie that matches
I'm wearing two Swatches and a small Gucci pouch
I could have worn the Lugi but I left it in the house
Now, my niggas Duce and Wayne got gold plates with their names
With the skyline on it with the box link chain
I'm wearing my frames
They match my gear with their tint
And you know Lagerfields is the scent

Now, my nigga Rafael just got his jeep out the shop
Mint green sidekick, custom-made rag top
""Strictly Business"" is the album that we play
""You're A Customer""; the pick of the day
Now there's a nigga on the block, never seen him before
Selling incence and oil, my man thinks that he's the law
But why on earth would this be on their agenda?
As he slowly approaches the window..

""Uh, uh, I've seen you before, I've been you and more
I was the one bearing the pitcher of water
I rent the large upper room
Furnished with tidings of your doom
Or pleasure, whichever feathers[?] decree.""
Yo Ralph is he talking to me?
""No I'm talking to the sea son's resurrected
I'm the solstice of the day
I bring news from the blues of the Caspian""
My man laughs, he's one them crazy motherfuckers
Turn the music back up - 'cause I'm the E-Double'
""Wait, but but but but I know the volume of the sea
And sound waves as I will
Will you allow me to be at your service?""
My man Ralph is nervous. He believes
That this strange tongue deceives
And maybe he's been informed that
He's pushing gats hidden in the back, beneath the floor mats

For your bullshit or playin

At the gates of Atlantis we stand
Ours is the blood that flowed from the palms of his hands
on the plow till earth
till I'm now
Moon cycles revisited, womb fruit of the sun
Full moon of occasions wave the wolves where they run
And they run towards the light casting love on the winds
As is the science of the aroma of sleeping women
Lost in his eyes they soon reflect my friend's are grinning
But I'm a pupil of his sight
The wheels are spinning
Yo I'll see ya'll later on tonight

In the beginning her tears where the long awaited rains
Of a parched Somali village
Red dusted children danced shadows
In the newfound mound of mascara that eclipsed her face
Reflected in the smogged glass of carlos east street bodega
Learning to love, she had forgotten to cry
Seldom hearing the distant thunder in her lovers ambivalent sighs
He was not honest
She was not sure
A great grandmother
Had sacrificed the family's clarity for God in the late 1800's
Nonetheless she had allowed him to mispronounce her name
Which had eventually led to her misinterpreating her own dreams
And later doubting them
But
The night was young
She the firstborn daughter of water faced darkness and smiled
Took mystery as her lover
And raised light as her child

Man that shit was wild you should have seen how they ran
She woke up in an alley with a gun in her hand
Tupac in lotus form
Ennis'[?] blood on his hands
She woke up on a vessel
The land behind her
The sun within her
Water beneath her
Mushed corn for dinner
Or was it breakfast
Her stomach turned as if a compass
She prayed towards east and lay there breathless
They threw her overboard for dead
She swam silently and fled
Into the blue sea
La soh fa mi, re do, si
The seventh octave
I don't mean to confuse you
Many of us have been taught to sing
And so we practice scales
Many of us were born singing
And thus were born with scales
Mermaids, cooks, and fieldhands
Sang a nightsong by the forest
And the ocean was the chorus
In Atlantis where they sang
Those thrown overboard had overheard
The mystery of the undertow
And understood that down below
There would be no more chains
They surrendered breath and name
And survived countless as rain
I'm the weather man
The clouds say storm is coming
A white buffalo was born
Already running
And if you listen very close
You'll hear a humming
Beneath the surface of our purpose lies
Rumors of ancient man
Dressed in cloud face minstrels in the sky
The moon's my mammy
The storm holds my eye
Dressed in westerlies [?]
Robed by robes ol' man river knows my name
And the reason you were born
Is the reason
That I came

Then she looks me in the face
And her eyes get weak
Pulse rate descends, hearts rate increase
Emcees look me in the face and their eyes get weak
Pulse rates descends hearts rate increase
It's like ""beam me up, Scottie"", I control your body
I'm as deadly as AIDS when it's time to rock a party
We all rocked fades, fresh faded in ladidadi - and when we rock the mic
Ignore the feminine side - we rock the mic

I presented my feminine side with flowers
She cut the stems and placed them gently down my throat
And these two lips might soon eclipse your brightest hopes",1987,2001

silver rings, turquoise stones and purple nails

I slept once, The dream has yet to end
It was a purple evening such as this, the curtains had been pulled by a hand unattached 
I lay propped on a pillow of eagle feathers on a couch framed with the skeletons of my uncles and great uncles 
I did not intend to close my eyes but then I did 
The night is falling on the moist palms of children too weak to bear it's weight 
The stars are visibly breathing in fact they almost look as if they are chewing gum 
The moon is crescented on both sides while its center remains unseen
I can faintly hear my mother calling me, or is that my sister singing songs of the railroad?
Robeson is reflected in a floating mirror 
Then I realize that the mirror is not floating but being pulled by a white horse and in great golden chariot, the horse has human feet
I look down at my feet and they are hooves. When I look up it is no longer night, the sun covers the entire sky as if it were stretched to reach all corners, flames are visible but not threatening.
A girl brushes my knee with her tail, she is wearing pink overalls and rollerblades, she signals for me to follow her, as soon as I take a step towards her I'm flying.

There are rocky mountains below me, I decide to land in a small settlement between mountains 
A man walks up to me, he is my father but he introduces himself as John Galt. I ask him if he is the Reverend John Galt. we begin to say the Lord's prayer together, the whole world seems to join in 
The mountains have mouths; 
I am standing at an altar, it takes a second to realize I'm getting married
The woman beside me, my bride, is sitting in lotus position on an Indian silk pillow
She is holding a white umbrella over her head, I cannot see her, I keep whispering to her, It's okay love, it's okay love? and she keeps shushing me, and shushing me, 
I'm wearing a backpack I decide to take it off and open it up, It's filled with colouring books and I keep thinking 
""I have to be done in time to pick Saturn up from school, I have to be done in time to pick Saturn up from school, I have to be done in time
To pick Saturn up from school"" 

My darling Saturn I seem to break your heart daily, how could I ever neglect to hug you 
You are a planet hugged by a rainbow, forgive me
I sometime become so consumed in the travails of my own heart that I neglect yours 
And there is no greater crime I will never commit it again, for there is no other adultery
You are my child, God's gift to the world God's will be done, I love you.",Robeson,2001

Children of the night
Only some will star the sky
Only believers in death will die

And now I'm a fish called father
With gills type dizzy
Blowing liquid lullabies through the spine of time

And wrap me in nighttime

And echo my plight

It is the Tao of now",Tao of Now,2001
Saul Williams,"The fiery sun of my passions 
Evaporates the love lakes of my soul 
Clouds my thoughts and rains you into existence 
As I take flight on bolts of lighting 
Claiming chaos as my concubine and you as my me 

I of the storm you of the sea 
We of the moon land of the free 
What have I done to deserve this? am I happy? 
Happiness is a mediocre sin set for a middle-class existence 
I see through smiles and smell truth in the distance 
Beyond one dimensional smiles and laughter 
Lies are hereafter where tears echo laughter 
You'd have to do math to divide a smile 

By a tear times fear equals mere truth. 
I simply delve in the air and if that's the case, 
All I have to breath and all else will follow, 
That's why drums are hollow, and I like drums drums 

Are good but I can't think straight 
I lack the attention span to meditate 
My attention spans galaxies here and now are immense 
Seconds are secular, moments are mine, 

Self is illusion, music's divine. 
Noosed by the strings of jimmy's guitar 
I swing purple hazed pendulum 
Hypnotizing the part of I that never dies

Look into my eyes are the windows of the soul. 
It's fried chicken collies and cornbread, 
Its corn milk flour sour cream eggs and oil. 
Its the stolen blood of the earth

Used to make cars run and kill the fish. 
Who me? I play scales. 
The scales of dead fish of oil slicked seas 
My sister blows wind through the hollows of fallen tress 

And we are the echoes of eternity, 
Echoes of eternity, echoes of eternity maybe you heard of us, 
We do rebirths, revokes and resurrections 
We threw basement parties in pyramids

I left my tag on the wall, 
The beats would echo of the stone 
And solidify into the form of light bulbs, 
Destined to light of the heads of future generations 

They're releasing it up in the form of OM. 
Maybe you heard of us. 
If not then you must be trying to hear us, 
In such cases we can't be heard 

We remain in the darkness unseen, 
In the center of unpeeled bananas we exist uncolored by perception, 
Clothed to the naked eye, 
Five senses cannot sense the fact of our existence 

And that's the only fact, 
In fact there are no facts, fax me a fact and I'll telegram 
I'll hologram I'll telephone the son of man and tell him he is done. 
Leave a message on his answering machine 

Telling him there are none. 
God and I are one. 
Times moon times star times sun, 
The factor is me, you remember me, 

I slung amethyst rocks on Saturn blocks 
'Til I got caught up by earthling cops. 
They wanted me for their army or whatever. 
Picture me, I swirl like the wind tempting tomorrow to be today, 

Tiptoeing the fine line between everything and everything else. 
I am simply Saturn swirling sevenths through sooth 
The sole living air of air and I, and, and all else follows. 
Reverberating the space inside of drum hollows. 

Package and bottles and chips 
And tomorrow then sold to the highest nigga. 
I swing to the tallest tree, 
Lynched by the lowest branches of me

Praying that my physical will set me free 
Cause I'm afraid that all else is vanity 
Mere language is profanity, 
I'd rather hum or have my soul tattooed to my tongue 

And let the scriptures be sung in gibberish 
As words be simple fish in my soulquarium. 
And intellect can't swim so I stopped combing my mind 
So my thoughts could lock. 

I'm tired of trying to understand. 
Perceptions are mangled matted and knotted anyway. 
Life is more than what meet the eye and I, 
So elevate I to the third and even that shit seems absurd 

And your thoughts leave you third (eye)solated. 
No man is an island but I often feel alone, 
So I find peace through OM.",Untimely Meditations,2001
Saul Williams,"The new wine is dying on the vine
how much must you age before you're ageless?
align yourself with the divine
allow your inner sage to burn your rage less
'cause I find you're testaments of time
there is no space for time within your mind
if your looking for yourself, yourself you'll find
through the crystal of your spirit you'll inherit the divine
you are God, you best believe
don't waste your time down on your knees
it's everybody for themselves
you have the fire and the cross
don't save your soul it's sour loss
collective soul, collective well

The new wine is dying on the vine
how much must you age before you're ageless?
align yourself with the divine
allow your inner sage to burn your rage less
'cause I find you're testaments of time
there is no space for time within your mind
if your looking for yourself, yourself you'll find
through the crystal of your spirit you'll inherit the divine

Chorus (x2):
Now do you know how I feel tonight?
Now can't you see I'm surreal tonight?
See how I shine I'm a star, yeah
Now do you know who you are, yeah?

I'm that atonement son
that's like a bible and gun
pea-cocked and ready aimin' steady as a ray of the sun
my ammunition, intuition, full eclipse of my lung
son, you could never guess what planet I'm from
my emcee name is my birth name, my first name
alias is all of us, soul of us, the fall of us
to surely come when we deny it
loudest nigga gets quiet
prison of pieces of riot
sell your soul if you want to, but that don't mean I'mma buy it
see I've been conscious of your nonsense
they imprints have been quiet
and I ain't gonna lie it
be to hard to deny it
I ain't from your block and never had to deal with your shit
never had a glock never kept it real with no bit
and when I saw a nigga like you, son I practically hit
'cause you did what you did and I wasn't the kid
don't give a fuck now, I be the first one to playa hate
the eye of the needle set the record straight
and I retire late, retire late, retaliate, retaliate
and I be fishin' on that same star you be wishin' on
make you move son, you know the mission's on
so never question who I am, God knows
and I know God personally
in fact he lets me call him me
in fact he lets me call him me

never question who I am, God knows
and I know God personally
in fact she lets me call her me
in fact she lets me call her me

Chorus (x6)

I can recite the grass on the hill and memorize the moon
I know the cloudforms of love by heart
and have brought tears to the eye of a storm
and my memory banks vaults of  forests and amazon river banks
and i've screamed them into sunsets that echo in earthquakes
shadows have been my spotlight as I monologue the night and dialogue with days
soliloquies of wind and breeze applauded by sun rays
we put language in zoos to observe caged thought
and tossed peanuts and p-funk at intellect
and motherfuckers think these are metaphors
i speak what I see
all words and worlds are metaphors of me
my life was authored by the moon
footprints written in soil
the fountain pen of martian men
novelling human toil
and yes, the soil speaks highly of me
but earth seeds root me poet-tree
now, maybe i'm too serious
too little here to matter
though i'm riddled with the reason of the sun
i stand up comets with the audience of lungs
this body of laughter is it with me or at me?
hue more or less though gender's mute
and the punch line has this lifeline at it's root
i'm a star this life's the suburbs, I commute

Chorus (x2)",Wine,2001
Saul Williams,"This is a call out to all the youth in the ghettos, suburbs, villages, townships. To all the kids who download this song for free. By any means. To all the kids short on loot but high on dreams. To all the kids watching T.V., like, ""Yo, I wish that was me."" And all the kids pressing rewind on Let's Get Free. I hear you. To all the people within the sound of my voice.

I didn't vote for this state of affairs. My emotional state's got me prostrate, fearing my fears. In all reality I'm under prepared. 'Cause I'm ready for war but not sure if I'm ready to care. And that's why I'm under prepared. 'Cause I'm ready to fight, but most fights have me fighting back tears. 'Cause the truth is really I'm scared. Not scared of the truth, but just scared of the length you'll go to fight it. I tried to hold my tongue, son. I tried to bite it. I'm not trying to start a riot or incite it. 'Cause Brutus is an honorable man. It's just coincidence that oil men would wage war on an oil rich land. And this one goes out to my man, taking cover in the trenches with a gun in his hand, then gets home and no one flinches when he can't feed his fam. But Brutus is an honorable man.

If you have tears prepare to shed them now. For you share the guilt of blood spilt in accordance with the Dow Jones. Dow drops fresh crop skull and bones. A machete in the heady: Hutu, Tutsi, Leone. An Afghani in a shanty. Doodle dandy yank on! An Iraqi in Gap khaki. Coca Coma come on! Be ye bishop or pawn, in the streets or the lawn, you should know that these example could go on and on and what since does it make to keep your ears to the street? As long as oils in the soil, truth is never concrete. So we dare to represent those with the barest of feet. 'Cause the laws to which we're loyal keep the soil deplete. It's our job to not let history repeat.

Spit for the hated, the reviled, the unrefined, the no ones, the nobodies, the last in line.
Spit for the hated, the reviled, the unrefined, the no ones, the nobodies, the last in line.

So here's the plan. The ides of march are always at hand. And when the power hungry strike, they strike the poorest of man. And if you dare put up a fight, they'll come and fight for your land. And they'll call it liberation or salvation. A call to the youth! Your freedom ain't so free, it's just loose. but the power of your voice could redirect every truth. Shift and shape the world you want and keep your fears in a noose. Let them dangle from a banner star spangled. I'm willing and able. To lift my dreams up out of their cradle. Nurse and nurture my ideals 'til they're much more than a fable. I can be all I can be and do much more than I'm paid to. And I won't be a slave to what authorities say do. My desire is to live within a nation on fire, where creative passions burn and raise the stakes ever higher. Where no person is addicted top some twisted supplier who promotes the sort of freedom sold to the highest buyer. We demand a truth naturally at one with the land, not a plant that photosynthesizes bombs on demand, or a search for any weapons we let fall from our hands. I got beats and a plan. I'm gonna do what I can. And what you do is question everything they say do, every goal ideal or value they keep pushing on you. If they ask you to believe it question whether it's true. If they ask you to achieve, is it for them or for you. You're the one they're asking to go carry a gun. Warfare ain't humanitarian. You're scaring me, son. Why not fight to feed the homeless, jobless, fight inflation?! Why not fight for our own healthcare and our education?! And instead, invest in that erasable lead, 'cause their twisted propaganda can't erase all the dead. And the pile of corpses pyramid on top of our heads. Or nevermind, said the shotgun to the head",Act III Scene 2 (Shakespeare),2004

Saul Williams,"I used to hump my pillow at night.
The type of silent prayer to help myself prepare for the light.
Me and my cousin Duce would rank the girls between one and ten 
And the highest number got to be my pillows pretend.
Now I apologize to every high ranker.
But you taught me how to dream and so I also thank you.
I never had the courage to approach you at school.
We joked around a lot and I know you thought I dressed cool.
But I was just covering up all the insecurities that came bubbling up.
My complexion had 
Me stuck in an emotional rut, 'like the time you Flavor Flaved me and you called me
""Yo Chuck, they say
You're too black, man"".
I think I'm too black.
Mom, do you think I'm too black? I think I'm too black.
Black Stacey.
They called me Black Stacey.
I never got to be myself 'cause to
Myself I always was Black Stacey, in polka dots
And paisley, a double goose 
And bally shoes, you thought it wouldn't phase me.
I was Black Stacey.
The preachers' son from Haiti
Who rhymed a lot and always got the dance steps at the party.
I was Black Stacey.
You thought it wouldn't phase me, but it did 'cause I was just a kid.

I used to use bleaching creme, 'til Madame CJ Walker walked into my dreams. 
I dreamt of being white and
Complimented by you, but the only shiny black thing that you liked was my shoes.
Now, I apologize for bottling up
All the little things you said that warped my head and my gut. 
Even though I always told you not to 
Brag about the fact that your great grand
Mother was raped by her slave master. Yeah, I became
Militant too. 
So it was clear on every level I was blacker than you.
I turned you on to Malcolm X and
Assata Shakur in my three quarter elephant goose with the fur.
I had the high top fade
With the steps on the side.
I had the two finger ring, rag top on the ride.
I had the sheep skin, name
Belt, Lee suit, Kangol, acid wash Vasco, chicken and waffle.

They called me Black Stacey.
I never got to be myself 'cause to myself I always was Black Stacey, in polka dots

Son from Haiti who
Rhymed a lot and always got the dance steps at the party. 
I was Black Stacey. 
You thought it wouldn't phase me, but it did 'cause I was just a kid. 

Now here's a little
Message for you.
All you baller playa's got
Some insecurities too, that you could cover up, bling it up, cash in
And ching ching it up, hope no
One will bring it up, lock it down and string it up.
Or you can share your essence with us, 'cause everything about you couldn't be rugged
And ruff. 
And even though you tote a 
Glock and you're hot on the
Streets, if you dare to share your heart, we'll nod our heart to
Its beat.
And you should do that, if nothing else, to prove
That a player like you could keep it honest and true. Don't mean to call your bluff but
Mothafucka that's what I do.
You got platinum chain
Then, son, I'm probably talking to you.
And you can call your gang, your posse and the rest of your crew.

Although the answers are not clear, there's not a thing that you should fear, because the answers to it all whether things rise or when they fall, you'll find the truth remains the same and that truth is that God is change. Hey you! You can talk about talk about talk about it, but you can't control your destiny. I think that God is testing me. Hey you! You can talk about it talk about it talk about it, but you can't control your destiny. You just might fail successfully. I'm alone. And I thought God created you for me.

Saul Williams,"I gave hip hop to white boys when nobody was looking. They found it locked in a basement when they gentrified Brooklyn. I left a list of instructions, an MPC and a mic, my sci-fi library, and utensils to write. Right or wrong, I think hip hop is where it belongs. Where it comes from is one, but, son, we wrote them songs. It was a ploy. Got fools tied up with mechanized toys. We are beings of breath, beyond the beings of boys. Now, you can break all you wanna. Scratch all you wanna. Graff all you wanna. Laugh all you wanna. But I want to show you what the stars are made of. I want to show you the stars. So substitute the anger and oppression with guilt and depression and it's yours.

White boys listen to white boys. Black boys listen to black boys. No one listens to no one. No one listens to no one. Alone on a mountain top, uprooted from the earth. Drifting beyond normalcy. A gold piece in God's purse is worthless here. We're Earthless here. God versus fear. Man versus fear. Fear not. I purse my lips and kiss like a glock. Violence is a metaphor for victory's plot. Change is inevitable, but our death is not. Now, you can break all you wanna. Scratch all you wanna. Graff all you wanna. Laugh all wanna. But I want to show you what the stars are made of.

I wrote a song for you today while I was sitting in my room. I jumped up on my bed today and played it on a broom. I didn't think that it would be a song that you would hear, but when I played it in my head, I made you reappear. I wrote a video for it and I acted out each part. Then I took your picture out and taped it to my heart. I've taped you to my heart dear girl, I've taped you to my heart and if you pull away from me you'll tear my life apart..

There will be no more breath and no more light
I've burned every candle and extinguished every fear
And I've waited for your time to pass
To bring in my new year

Something is dying tonight
There will be no more struggle, no more fight
And I've known that I'd have to live
Through suffering and youth
But I'm the landlord of my dreams now
And my tenets rent is due

Something is dying inside of me
In spite of me
Something is dying tonight

Taking flight and the astronaut within me
Has no air supply at all so
He's plunging into the deep sea
With no parachute to fall

'Cause I wanted you to lean on
To distract me from my feet
Oh, my karma will cure me

Saul Williams,"I drive a yellow Volvo. '86 submarine. Someone's behind me in an escalade trying to blind me with their high beams. I make a left. I'm the road to nowhere, heading west. The sky is purple streaks. The sun is setting in my chest. I feel warm inside. So I'm going for a ride. Put your picture on my dashboard 'til my fate and your collides. Seaweed washed upon the shore. Severed locks of he who walks the ocean floor. I drive a yellow Volvo. '86 submarine. Rims like Tibetan prayer wheels and my tank is filled with dreams. Fuck the game, I practice being in the passing lane. And watch the price of gasoline rise with the price of fame. I'm immortal. I render unto Caesar to be cordial. He sees a wooden casket where I see a glowing portal. Check your engine. Looks like you're running on the blood of Indians. Put some turquoise in that rolls Royce before you crash into a pendulum. Seaweed washed upon the shore. Severed locks of he who walks the ocean floor. I drive a yellow Volvo. '86 submarine. I drove it under water guided by my own high beams. Nothing's left. Witnessed the demolition of the west. I feel like a little kid hiding in my mothers' dress. I'm in space. The lone ambassador of every race. The starfish that discover me plant their flags into my face. I'm a clone of every written and unwritten poem. A shark pulls up beside me fingering beads and chanting om. I can't believe it. I never really thought that sharks would need it. I thought they'd make their peace: bite it, bleed it, kill it, eat it. But I was wrong. Every living being deserves a song.

Saul Williams,"Well, there're two ways I can say this. 
And one would be: fuck you! 
And there're no two ways around it, because one would be untrue. 
Because I love everything about you. 
But I don't want to be around you. 
If you control my heart will you control my brain? 
If I give in to you, will it still feel the same? 
'Cause I want nothing more than to be here with you. 
If you fulfill my dreams, will that fulfill you too? 
I need a second. I need a second to think. 
Now, the other way to play this would be mellow, light, and, cool. 
Poetry and meditation. Higher ground and higher truth. 
Because I love everything about you. 
But I use everything to doubt you. 
If you control my heart will you control my brain? 
If I give in to you, will it still feel the same? 
'Cause I want nothing more that to be here with you. 
If you fulfill my dreams, will that fulfill you too? 
I need a second. I need a second to think. 
I found the spot where truth echoes and know each beauty mark by heart. 
But I just can't keep her still enough to render perfect art. 
'Cause the truth is ever changing and although she loves my touch, 
I've had my way, but I when I pray, she kisses back too much. 
And it's hard to feel real gangster when you're always getting kissed. 
But you jump at every pucker, 'cause your fear of getting dissed.

Saul Williams,"Nah, I wasn't raised at gunpoint
And I've read too many books
To distract me from the mirror
When unhappy with my looks
And I ain't got proper diction
For the makings of a thug
Though I grew up in the ghetto
And my niggas all sold drugs
And though that may validate me
For a spot on MTV
And get me all the airplay
That my bank account would need
I was hoping to invest in
A lesson that I learned
When I thought this fool would jump me
Just because it was my turn

I went to an open space
'Cause I knew he wouldn't do it
If somebody there should see him 
Or somebody else might prove it
And maybe in your mind
It may seem I got punched out
'Cause I walked a narrow path
And then went and changed my route
But that openness exposed me 
To a truth I couldn't find
In the clenched fist of my ego
Or the confines of my mind
Or the hipness of swagger
Or the swagger in my step
Or the scowl of my grimace 
Or the meanness of my rep
'Cause we represent a truth, son
That changes by the hour
And when you open to it
Vulnerability is power
And in that shifting form
You'll find a truth that doesn't change
And that truth's living proof 
Of the fact that God is strange

Talk to strangers when family fails
And friends lead you astray
When Buddha laughs and Jesus weeps
And it turns out God is gay
'Cause angels and messiahs
Love can come in many forms
In the hallways of your projects
Or the fat girl in your dorm
And when you finally take the time
To see what they're about
And perhaps you find them lonely
Or their wisdom trips you out

Maybe you'll find the cycle's end
You're back where you began
But come this time around
You'll have someone to hold your hand
Who prays for you, who's there for you
Who sends you love and light
Exposes you to parts of you
That you once tried to fight
And come this time around 
You'll choose to walk a different path
You'll embrace what you turned away
And cry at what you laughed
'Cause that's the only way 
We're gonna make it through this storm
Where ignorance is common sense
And senselessness the norm

And flags wave high above the truth
And the two never touch
And stolen goods are overpriced
And freedom costs too much
And no one seems to recognize
The symbols come to life
The bitten apple on the screen
And Jesus had a wife
And she was his messiah
Like that stranger may be yours
Who holds the subtle knife
That carves through worlds like magic doors

And that's what I've been looking for
The bridge from then to now
Was watching BET like
What the fuck, son? This is foul
But that square box don't represent
The sphere that we live in
The Earth is not a flat screen
I ain't trying to fit in
But this ain't for the underground
This here is for the sun
A seed a stranger gave to me
And planted on my tongue
And when I look at you
I know I'm not the only one
As a great man once said
There is nothing more powerful
Than an idea, whose time has come",Talk to Strangers,2004
Saul Williams,"I'm falling up flights of stairs, 
Scraping myself from the sidewalk, 
Jumping from rivers to bridges, 
Drowning in pure air.

Hip hop is lying on the side of the road, 
Half dead to itself.
Blood scrawled over its mangled flesh, like jazz, 
Stuffed into an oversized record bag. 

Tuba lips swollen beyond recognition. 
Diamond-studded teeth strewn like rice at Karma's wedding. 
The ring bearer bore bad news. 
Minister of information wrote the wrong proclamation. 

And now everyone's singing the wrong song. 
Dissonant chords find necks like nooses.

Hold your cup up so this ancient rain can find its way in
Let these niggas know the cost of reaching heavenly bliss, yes

It was all a dream, it was all a dream
I used to fantasize I was Malcolm or Martin in the pulpit
The ballot or the bullet

I swear I used to pray to change back the year
When niggas spoke of motherships with space helmets for hair
Well, now what have we here?
Thugs and poets, ah yeah

What we seem to have in common is we're common as air
Yes, the lowest rung of anthems sung each day every year
From check cashing to latest fashions

While they ration out fear but I'm fearless
Sometimes I feel alone, homeless, peerless
What will it take to shake the land for everyone to hear this?

I can't bear this, born of pages torn from ancient prayer lists
Descendant of the womb, the lotus blooms when I come near it
I declare it time to realign karat to carrot
What was olden remains golden sceptered tongue I dare to share it

All who hear it know at once, royal highness over blunts
Thug of thugs, pimp of pimps, golden tongue and ivory fronts
Grind and hustle, niggas know the heart is just a muscle

All payments due, you made some papes
I wrote upon I trust you will invest
'Cause chances are the game is just a test
Professor of the truth talk real truth emeritus

I am the king as I command my son to dance and sing
We celebrate our earthly fate, my daughter gives me wings
We are one descendants of the mothership and tongue
Southern trees have born strange fruit, hail, salute a troop well hung

So come along, everyone's invited
Heroes of distinguished paths, victims and conquered
Those who stand alone and those who stand unfettered

Fuck the bullshit whether from the hill or from the pulpit
Today, I put my money on the fall of every culprit

The truth prevails when all else fails
Drug dealers make the music, then guess who's back?
Your souls answer to greenbacks, hoes and crack

The chord that strung from anthems
Sung right now to way way back
The legacy of Hennessey distilled to brownish black

Rolls off the tongue a pointed gun
Fake nigga's best stand back
The trumpet calls and yes, yes, y'all
The emperor's changed his hat",Scared Money,2007
Saul Williams,"And I can't become my father
When it's all been said and done
His completions won't complete me
I've divided me by one

I'm the answer to his riddle
I'm the caution of his wind
I'm the spoon wedged between tongue and teeth
Beneath his trembling grin

And I dare add my revision
For I dare not suffer twice
And I dare not reinvent the past
And I dare not be the Christ

And I welcome any sufferer
And I welcome any Saul
Sitting in this room, on wooden bench
Waiting for Joi to call

And I suffer here alone, Lord
Perturbed by my every thought
How I've tried to strip them to the bone
I've struggled and I've fought

Every jealous warped intention
Smuggled, sewn into genes
Every hidden mongrel tendency
Exploiting me in me

Each time I put them under
But still they wanna test me
I cry out through the thunder
You storm right past me

I search and I ponder
I question and wonder
I roar and I thunder
Please let me in

I've been waiting here
For what now seems the better of an hour
I've raised every crippled question
From the dead and given power

To the absence of my sanity
The presence of a fear
That lies in between forgotten dreams
That pile up every year

Up above the highest testaments
Down below the wooden floor
There's a gutted room, pitch black at noon
Beneath a hidden door

Deep within you'll find
The attributes of every sunken man
Who must bang his head against the dead
Each day he tries to stand

And he's standing pressed against
The very woman that he loves
Kissing eyes and lips, embracing hips
Surrendering to her touch

And just at the very moment
That he touches heart to heart
She pulls from his touch
'Cause it's too much to mend what's torn apart

Each time I put them under
But still they wanna test me
I cry out through the thunder
You storm right past me

I search and I ponder
I question and wonder
I roar and I thunder
Please let me in

It's so hard to be the man I would be
If hatred and fear no longer appeared
I swear I've become the skin of a drum
The heart of a man, divided I stand",Skin of a Drum,2007

Tightrope, vision, insight, stronghold, heartless
Ice cold, mystery, mastery, solar, battery

Some will pull the gun because they want to be stars
Snatching up your life into the blink of an eye
And if you see your cloning on a street walking by
Keep you running for your life cause only one will survive
War is in the streets and it's an eye for an eye
Run on for your life or you can dance you can die
She's praying in the sand like she's the last samurai
It's a stick up stick up and a pick up pick up

Telling lies and telling lies will put your face on fire
Run and tell your friends to never dream, never win
Ghettos keep a crying out to streets full of zombies
Kids are killing kids and then the kids join the army
Rising and a waking, yes sir here comes the sun
March into the war and with the kick of the drum
The wiser simians have got the bombs and the guns
So you might as well keep dancing if you're not gonna run

A long long way to find the one
We'll keep on dancing 'til she comes
These dreams are forever
Oh these dreams are forever
And if you wanna wake the sun
Just keep on marching to the drums
These dreams are forever
Oh these dreams are forever

Now I'm not saying it's better to bailar
You can pull the trigger or you can build you an ark
My words are rather kind you keep them held in contempt
Looking for a nine and then a droid you can tempt
Zombie, zombie, zombie, where do dreams come from?
A little bird is chirping and she's singing a song
She's shaking 'em and waking 'em and giving 'em mas
As the clock tick tocks and the bodies drop

I'm gonna lay myself so far way down right in your chops
Modern day example of the wolf vs flock
Freedom necessary and it's by any means
Frozen they were stolen all the kings and queens
Sudanese and congolese who put the roll in the rock
From here to sudan, metropolis to iraq
It's a minute to the dawn and yet the sun ain't back
It's a war in all the stress and yes freaks will dance or die

A long long way to find the one

And if you wanna wake the sun
Just keep on marching to the drums
These dreams are forever
Oh these dreams are forever

Angel, blossom, gunshot, dodging, dream, bright, beat
Light, breathe, live, help, give, focus, trance, wake up, dance!

I'm praying for the man sitting without much time
May he understand the clock will never rewind
Wisen him and sharpen him and give him a motto
Hate no more, said he must hate no more
You see the daylight comes into the kingdom
But the kingdom's full of ignorant men
Just keep rebelling away, you gotta dream it away
Because the weatherman you seein' ain't creating the weather

This man wants to see another jubilation
And that man wants us in emancipation
And then there is the man who wants a stronger nation
You see we really got to and I think that we ought to
Protect the mind from degradation
Sow in the seeds of education
They run from us, are we that dangerous?
There's a war in all the streets and yes the freaks must dance or die!

Then you look back at your life and everything is a blur
Like did I really turn twenty-three and see a mill before twenty-four?
Did I really blow it all like a hand grenade in the middle of a civil war?
Am I still down with the same niggas that I came in with?
Do they value my friendship?
Or do they just love the attention?
Not to mention my girlfriends, what went wrong?
Did they do me too right?
Am I the same as the snakes? Is the past coming back to bite?
Did I waste too many days? Did I fight too many nights?
Will they love me when I die? Will I ever learn to fly?

Picking pill pieces up out of the bathroom sink
Like an armored truck ridin' the rink
I'd probably be a vegetable if not for medical attention
My self destructive habits have me itching like Tyrone Biggums
In the cyclone of my own addiction
The voices in my head keep talking, I don't wanna listen
""You'll never be good enough, nigga, you never was
Nobody fucking needs you, you should just jump off the bridge
You hurt everyone around you, you impossible to love
I don't want you to live, I wish you were fucking dead
I wish you were never born, we would all be better for it
I don't love you, I don't like you, like a fucking metaphor
Fuck everyone song you ever done, you lie to everyone
And ask them to tell the truth when that's something you never done
You a fucking embarrassment, how dare you win

You're still a drug addict, you're nothing without your medicine

The sunshine fills my hair
And dreams hang in the air

Gulls in the sky and in my blue eyes
You know it feels unfair
There's magic everywhere

Look at me standing
Here on my own again
Up straight in the sunshine

No need to run and hide
It's a wonderful wonderful life
No need to laugh and cry
It's a wonderful wonderful life

The sun in your eyes
The heat is in your hair
They seem to hate you
Because you're there

I need is friend
Oh I need a friend
To make me happy
Not stand here on my own

Look at me standing
Here on my own again
Up straight in the sunshine

No need to run and hide
It's a wonderful wonderful life
No need to laugh and cry
It's a wonderful wonderful life

I need a friend
Oh I need a friend

Not so alone

It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,

I snuck into this club when I was 15
And I met my girl at the bar, such a sweet thing
Every time I held her she would always kiss me
Every touch of her lips would always make me tipsy
I told her, man I love you
Pulled her to the dance floor
And that's when she whispered
Be careful what you ask for
I grabbed her by the waist 
And I sat her on the table
Explained how the heartburn
She's giving me is painful
And now you want to leave
'Cause you feel empty inside
Well none of my friends trust me with you to drive
I'm so into you, I hope you're feeling it
I need you in my life and the reason is

How many times I gotta tell you
Why you stressin' me for
Yeah I see you need attention
I ain't tryin' to ignore
I gotta straighten up now, I got work to do
You want me to drop everything
So it surrounds you
Man I love you so much
It makes me sick to my stomach
And I love it how I can vomit
And you think nothing of it
I never meant to argue with you, please forgive
Girl I need you in my life and the reason is

(Chorus)
Ya see my moonshine
She keeps me warm when it rains
I forget my problems when she eases the pain
And my friends keep telling me to call it a day
She don't love ya Savage, it's all in your brain
See I don't believe a word
That you say to my face
I'm in love and I know she feels the same
I'll buy you all the ice you want
And I'll keep you safe
Man I love my alcohol, what more can I say

Savage Garden,"Anytime I need to see your face I just close my eyes
And I am taken to a place
Where your crystal minds and magenta feelings
Take up shelter in the base of my spine
Sweet like a chica cherry cola
I don't need to try to explain
I just hold on tight and If it happens again
I may move so slightly to the arms
And the lips and the face
Of The Human Cannonball that
I need to I want to

Come stand a little bit closer
Breathe in and get a bit higher
You'll never know what hit you when
I get to you

Ooh I want you, I don't know if I need you but
Ooh I'd die to find out
Ooh I want you, I don't know if I need you but
Ooh I'd die to find out

I'm the kind of person who endorses a deep commitment
Getting comfy getting perfect is what I live for
But a look and then a smell of perfume
It's like I'm down on the floor
And I don't know what I'm in for
Conversation has a time and place in the interaction
Of a lover and a mate but the time of talking
Using symbols, using words can be likened
To a deep sea diver who is swimming with a raincoat

Come stand a little bit closer
Breathe in and get a bit higher
You'll never know what hit you when
I get to you

Ooh I want you, I don't know if I need you but
Ooh I'd die to find out
Ooh I want you, I don't know if I need you but

Savage Garden,"And we stare each other down
Like victims in the grind
Probing all the weakness and
Hurt still left behind and we cry
The tears of pearls
We do it. Oh we do it.

Is love really the tragedy the way you
Might describe?
Or would a thousand lovers
Still leave you cold inside?
Make you cry
These tears of pearls

All these mixed emotions
We keep locked away like stolen pearls
Stolen pearl devotions we
Keep locked away from all the world

Your kisses are like pearls,
So different and so rare
But anger stole the jewels away
And love has left you bare,
Made you cry
These tears of pearls

Well I could be the tired joker
Pour my heart to get you in
Sacrifice my happiness just so I could win
Maybe cry
These tears of pearls

All these mixed emotions
We keep locked away like stolen pearls
Stolen pearl devotions we
Keep locked away from all the world

We twist and turn where angels burn
Like fallen soldiers we will learn
Once forgotten, twice removed
Love will be the death
The death of you

Keep locked away from all the world",Tears of Pearls,1997

Savage Garden,"The moonlight
Shines down interstellar beams

Is something more than you've ever seen

A stolen kiss has come too late

In the moonlight

Carry on  carry on dancing
In the moonlight
Carry on  keep romancing

And if the clock strikes past midnight
The hope is gone
To move under

That splinters against the wall?
But the picture is coming back

Time to be a thief

Promises you know you cannot keep

Can be a force you don't want
To relinquish?

They say hanging on will justify the wait?

Promises you know you cannot keep

Well I'm only hanging on for what
Goes down
I'm floating high and my feet don't
Touch the ground
I'd take advantage but I can't see
Through this charade
So don't you, don't go make it harder

Cause it comes down to the making
You'd better be damned sure you can
Take it

Modern names
Like Jake or Mandy
And modern bodies too

You'll have to dodge those in-line skaters
Or they'll knock you down

Never felt so out of place

And the world has turned its back on you
Give me a moment please
To tame your wild wild heart

Let me be the one you call
If you jump I'll break your fall
Lift you up and fly away with you into the night
If you need to fall apart
I can mend a broken heart
If you need to crash then crash and burn
You're not alone",Crash and Burn,1999
Savage Garden,"Love and other moments
Are just chemical reactions in your brain
And feelings of aggression
Are the absence of the love drug in your viens

In your veins
Love come quickly
Because I feel my self esteem is caving in
It's on the brink

Love come quickly
Because I don't think I can keep this monster in
It's in my skin

Love and other socially acceptable emotions are morphine
They're morphine
Cleverly concealing primal urges often felt but rarely seen
Rarely seen

Love I beg you
Lift me up into that privileged point of view
The world of two
Love don't leave me

Because I console myself that
Hallmark cards are true
I really do

I'm gunning down romance
It never did a thing for me
But heartache and misery
Ain't nothing but a tragedy

Love don't leave me

Take these broken wings
I'm going to take these broken wings
And learn to fly
And learn to fly away
And learn to fly away

I'm gunning down romance",Gunning Down Romance,1999
Savage Garden,"Hey  if we can't find a way out of these problems 
Then maybe we don't need this 
Standing face to face 
Enemies at war we build defenses 
And secret hiding places 
I might need you to hold me tonight 
I might need you to say it's all right 
I might need you to make the first stand 
Because tonight I'm finding it hard to be your man 

Hey  more than angry words I hate this silence 
It's getting so loud 
Well I want to scream 
But bitterness has silenced these emotions 
It's getting hard to breathe 
So tell me isn't happiness 
Worth more than a gold and diamond ring? 
I'm willing to do anything 
To calm the storm in my heart 
I've never been the praying kind 
But lately I've been down upon my knees 
Not looking for a miracle 
Just a reason to believe 

I might need you to hold me tonight 
I might need you to say it's all right 
I might need you to make the first stand 
Because tonight I'm finding it hard to be your man 

Do you remember not long ago? 
When we used to live for the night-time 
Cherish each moment 
Now we don't live we exist 
We just run through our lives 
So alone 
That's why you've got to hold me 

Hey, if we can't find a way out of these problems 
Then maybe we don't need this 
Standing face to face 
Enemies at war we build defenses 
And secret hiding places 
I might need you to hold me tonight 
I might need you to say it's all right 
I might need you to make the first stand 
Because tonight I'm finding it hard to be your man",Hold Me,1999
Savage Garden,"I would like to visit you for a while
Get away and out of this city
Maybe I shouldn't have called but
Someone had to be the first to break
We can go sit on your back porch
Relax
Talk about anything
It don't matter
I'll be courageous if you can pretend
That you've forgiven me

Because I don't know you anymore
I don't recognize this place
The picture frames have changed
And so has your name
We don't talk much anymore
We keep running from the pain
But what I wouldn't give to see your face again

Springtime in the city
Always such a relief from winter freeze
The snow was more lonely than cold if you know what I mean
Everyone's got an agenda
Don't stop keep that chin up you'll be alright
Can you believe what a year it's been
Are you still the same?
Has your opinion changed?

Because I don't know you anymore
I don't recognize this place
The picture frames have changed
And so has your name
We don't talk much anymore
We keep running from the pain
But what I wouldn't give to see your face again

I know I let you down
Again and again
I know I never really treated you right
I've paid the price
I'm still paying for it every day

So maybe I shouldn't have called
Was it too soon to tell?
Oh what the hell
It doesn't really matter
How do you redefine something that never really had a name?
Has your opinion changed?

Because I don't know you anymore
I don't recognize this place
The picture frames have changed
And so has your name
We don't talk much anymore
We keep running from the pain
But what I wouldn't give to see your face again

I see your face
I see your face",I Don't Know You Anymore,1999
