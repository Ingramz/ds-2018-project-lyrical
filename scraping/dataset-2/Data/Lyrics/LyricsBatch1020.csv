Smoke City,"Something happened, yesterday 
I feel lost 
I'm afraid that my love 
Loves another 

Giulietta 
Do you know 
To be happy we must wake up 
And a place to confront with passion 

As the body 
The body? 
Yes the body, and the shoulders 
And the space between the breasts 

The green birds, 
The flamingos, 
The doves, the sparrows 
Songs that can be used 

According to the occasion 
There are different types of byte 
Dog bytes, wouf! 
Playful bytes, miaou! 

Dialetical byte of a wolf, ohhh 
Giulietta love this (the religion) 
And your lover is your god 
And the stimulator of the cold 

Your spirit 
Like the incense it must stay 
Smoke on the outer 
Of your loving body 

Giulietta 
Now you know the Kama Sutra",Giulietta,1997
Smoke City,"My friend Jamie Pan
Peter Pan of the park
With flute he pipes his way
On tree branches he plays
Until it's dark
Jamie Pan

When he gets restless
He jumps above the tree
With a hop skip on the jump
He feels free

Jamie's mat
He's filled with glee
When you move so haphazardly
And our playground so free
Jamie plays, Jamie play, play, play

And he gets faceless
He jumps above up the tree
With a hop skip on the jump
He feels free

Shall we let the state believe
From your book let us take a look
Absurd is (?) a players release
Closer to sky

And he gets restless
He jumps above up the tree
With a hop skip on the jump
He feels free

Free from Che Guevara
And all the different minds of ?? (?)
Tormented by the walls
How it's so fucked up
And no one gives a damn
No one gives a damn",Jamie Pan,1997
Smoke City,"Cool and calm, Mr Gorgeous
Walks up to the bar and orders and
As he passes by, they all sigh - ah...

When he moves just like a panther,
He feels your gaze, but won't look at ya

He won't dare a smile
'Cause it's really not his style
Oh

Aie, aie, aie, aie, aie
Aie, aie, aie, aie, aie ....

She's so slick and so curvaceous
The way she walks is quite contagious
Eager eyes follow her thighs and go, hmmm

The way she moves strikes a chord
Hits the groove
But she ignores the
Hopeful advances
No, she won't give no chances at all

Aie, aie, aie, aie, aie
Aie, aie, aie, aie, aie ....

All alone our Miss Curvaceous
Back at her place finds her bed too spacious
And as she passes her own reflection, sighs
Ooh..

Mr Gorgeous is feeling lonely
He wishes that if he could only
Smile, once a while, ah
So lonely, poor thing

Aie, aie, aie, aie, aie
Aie, aie, aie, aie, aie ....

So while you are shaking your hips, 
Keep your lips turned up",Mr. Gorgeous (And Miss Curvaceous),1997
Smoke City,"With you I found love
With you I found the pain
With you I was me
And a bit of you too

Inhaling and being inhaled
In an all or nothing situation

If I tried to say no
My heart said yes
If I tried to disguise it in my voice
My eyes gave me away

And so we became one
In a mad love of so no limits

Had to let
My love go
To let it go

Had to let
My love go
To let it go

The fear of separation
Became an obsession
Jealousy and jealous things
Into the passel tumbled down

And now our love is turning to smoke
But I can smell it in my touch
I finally became a flame
That will never go out

Had to let
My love go
To let it go

Had to let
My love go
To let it go

Had to let
My love go
To let it go

Had to let
My love go
To let it go

With you
I felt love
With you
I felt pain
With you

I was me
And a bit of you too
Inhaling and being inhaled
In an all or nothing situation

Yes I began to dream of you in my arms
From this dream I evoked .. calm

To a place you only dreamt of
Before I came along

When I first saw you
I was deep in clear blue water

Calling me to come and see you
I touched your soft skin
And you jumped in with your eyes closed
And a smile upon your face

Você vem, você vai

The window to your soul 
In the match am I your goal?
Because I feel you so
You follow me to my dreams 
And to my pillow seams
In the night I heard each and every word

It's amazing the way myself responds
To the slightest touch you give me
It's so hard for you always 
And the place where I want to be is inside you

I dream I dream I dream
I dream I dream I dream
I dream I dream I dream

Mesmerized by your eyes
What secrets do you keep?
The language that you speak
Torments me in my sleep

It's amazing the way myself responds
To the slightest touch you give me
It's so hard for you always 
And the place where I want to be is inside you

Your beau-ti-ful eyes I see you-and-your beauty inside
The touch of your voice,
I take it all, hear you 
Talking in your language
Falling with the touch of you
Fully find my heart now
To wander by your big old
Tree-because

It's amazing the way myself responds
To the slightest touch you give me
It's so hard for you always 
And the place where I want to be is inside you

Smoke City,"I walk alone you are in my song 
We make our way up on a warm breeze
Down mimosa street across the avenue
I hear a voice that's calling me to sing as one - ah

Brave the waters and see when it happens
Life can be sweet, life can be hmmm
If you just
So la ti do for joy and sorrow
Wouldn't it be nice to have you
We fall in love in tears and laughter
Yes it would be nice to have you
Way beyond and way
Before tomorrow

Now its early march and you're still here with me
Warm in my heart and we are free to be as one
Won't you sing it with me?

Brave the waters and see when it happens
Life can be sweet life can be hmmm
If you just
So la ti do for joy and sorrow
Wouldn't it be nice to have you
We fall in love in tears and laughter
Yes it would be nice to have you
Way beyond and way before

Oh to have my love
Loving and giving 
Yes it would be nice to have you
Way beyond and way

Smoke City,"What it was or what it is
You took me off where I left it
Guessing and wandering what I did
All through the night and we drift a little

I knew you before 
I think you're with me, I'm not sure
Didn't know what it was
Don't you know who I am 
'Cause I don't know myself anymore
'Cause I didn't know what it was before 
I didn't what it was

What it is or what it was
You took me in when I got off
Forever keeping me just a bit
Back in a way that still tilts a little

I know you before, a feeling, a motion a wave
I look at you now and question the future

Don't you know who I am 
'Cause I don't know myself anymore
'Cause I didn't know what it was before 
I didn't what it was",What It Was (Acoustic),2001
Smoke City,"This song is in the sky with my dreams
And spirits high 
I'm singing, with your smile on my mouth
In the air you float above my house

YouÂ´re everywhere
I have no choice but to climb you with my voice
You make me breathless with your tenderness
I fly

You are in the air
You are on my skin
You are everything

So pleased that you exists
With this song you bring a tender kiss
Can't come down for a while
Your warmth is a very nice glow
HeartÂ´s thumping like a bell in a church
Makes me climb on the furniture
I fly

You are in the air
You are on my skin
You are everything
Falling under the spell of loving you

And as the solar star in me
Has fixed my constant star on thee
The once fierce we will find

Leopards, tigers become kinder
Falling in the air of loving you
Falling in the air of loving you",This Song,2001

On the dark hillside of your sorrow
If there's pain in your heart
Let it go
Just reach inside and let it go
Now dig
To know someone deeply
Is to know someone softly
To know someone deeply
Is to know someone softly
Listen to me know
In my love garden
I wrestled with an angel
Not in a dream
Her eyes did seem
Like the grapes of the vine
Her lips were made like the gates of Heaven
Not to be missed
Made to be kissed
But not to kiss goodbye
The larger picture
Will come with time
But for tonight, dear
Let's lullabye
To know someone deeply
Is to know someone softly
To know someone deeply
Is to know someone softly
Listen to me know
Once a flower opens
It never closes
Until it dies
And the it lies
Amongst the roses
I wanted to play her like
A black grand piano
A clarinet
A minuet
Or lyric soprano
In my arms there's
A safety zone
Where nothing can harm you
Your heart or home

Yo D.N.A. ain't the same pimp so naw you don't look right
Fuck it, I fast forward past yours,
You wanted something to look up to so ask for it
Mississippi country bumpkin with nothin' to loose
I BB a king so let me sing you the blues
Let me lay down the rules,
Get money by all means,
Survive at all costs put god 'bove all things
I fall Short, pimpin' women with small shorts
Reachin' out for a smile like children and small folk
Always above the rim like what do you ball for?
If you ain't spending money then what did u call for
I look good for the fuck, but baby it's all spoke
The game is a bitch and shawty she all choke

Came through to conquer
We killin' this since contra
No sponser and I'm smokin' on a mini launcher
Eight grams nigga fuck with me
Gotta have 8 lungs to come puff with me
I don't blow Reggie Bush, neva' would
This heavy kush, oh you got some too? Very good
With a grinder, we grinders, top rhymers
Definers, drop gems so timeless
Burn like a C.D., get topped like Z.Z.
Flow like agua and I'm cold like a ski beat
Lord, got them hood niggas quotin my bars
And them bloggers like oh my gawd...
Smoke Robinson, earl james, and George Kush
Round table eatin' pasta like mobsta's
Make a killin' off sour D
They lied money really do grow off trees, yes",Skybourne,2010
Smoke DZA,"All my smokers get high with me, just Marley & me
Is smoking on your Kush, or the Sour D (Light it!)
Jus' come ride with me
Now salute eh yo
While you puff 'til your eyes get low
Now salute ooh
To all my potheads across the globe

I roll up something, nah I don't fuck with the drink
Would have wrote this verse down, but I'm too high to think
Pupils is pink
Like my nigga Spitta, I'm too fly to sink
Devin, light the stink
Let's go, I'll smoke a zone playing P3
My nigga Shiest got that E.T.,
Got a nigga sleepy, yah
I used to coast down posts
Lookin' real nonchalant
This sale, off the Audemar
You go to coppin', don't get more than one!
I go to coppin', and they throw me somethin'
It's like that
This for my piss-test failures who won't leave it alone
Shout out to Ricky Williams and Pacman Jones c'mon

All my smokers get high with me, just Marley & me
Is smoking on your Kush, or the Sour D (Light it!)
Jus' come ride with me
Now salute eh yo
While you puff 'til your eyes get low
Now salute ooh
To all my potheads across the globe

Even before I get my pad and my pen
I must have my weed, I grab my bag, then dig in
Mix my shit together so that it's all different kinds of flavors
They think I'm baking pies to distribute to the neighbors, no
I'm smoking weed, that tastes like, kinda cake-like
Bud is getting better, but the price is starting
To skyrocket, so I said fuck it, bought an Aerogarden
So I can get high, smoke big, and break even
No longer have to wait for harvest season
For strictly smoking, why do I have to push
Sitting back with a fat sack of pineapple kush
I wish a motherfucker would try to take my weed
So I take it and I stash the shit, so no one can see
Then I make it safe grab a brew to equalize it
Every day I'm smoking weed, I'm hoping soon they'll legalize it

All my smokers get high with me, just Marley & me
Is smoking on your Kush, or the Sour D (Light it!)
Jus' come ride with me
Now salute eh yo
While you puff 'til your eyes get low
Now salute ooh
To all my potheads across the globe

The bud brownies that I ate just kicking in
I got my Jordan Number Eights, black, aqua, and grape
These niggas try'na duplicate the Pilot DNA
Copycats see the big dog comin' and run away
Bitches fall through at the crib and can't get up, they want to stay
I got your old lady in my '88 Z-28
Haze got her dazed, she's stuck, she don't know what to say
I have the best week ever every seven days
In the magazine pictures, so high I might fly off the page
Rap, smoke, fly, drive, do it all with grace
For the Kush, I got a Jones like Grace
I call my house first, cause first is my place, yeah

All my smokers get high with me, just Marley & me
Is smoking on your Kush, or the Sour D (Light it!)
Jus' come ride with me
Now salute eh yo
While you puff 'til your eyes get low
Now salute ooh
To all my potheads across the globe",Marley & Me [Remix],2012

Smoke DZA,"This the song I wrote if I died
I was on the 50 mile doing 9-5
Beating the pussy like he ain't got 9 lives
And I'm high, mix Ciroc and some blunts, cause you only live once
Cause you only live once 
Once, once

White girl wasted, my wife girl hate it
‘Cause when I’m faded I just wanna
See her naked
Adjust adjacent, like baby let me see your matrix
Kama Sutra, back to basics
Since I was on the go, back to the block
105 on, started bumpin’ Hard Knock
I looked at my nigga Fly, as my heart dropped
Sedan in front swervin’ as the car stopped
In that split second, my foot steppin’ breakin’
I thought to myself, I always knew that I would make it
All it took was patience, and now I’m on the stations
Luckily I made it right before my life was taken
It was too good to be mistaken for happiness and riches
People callin’ my phone, like they happy that we did it
Little did they know I was ‘bout to meet my maker
Till an angel came down and told me that my time was later

This the song I wrote if I died
I was on the 50 mile doing 9-5
Beating the pussy like he ain't got 9 lives
And I'm high, mix Ciroc and some blunts, cause you only live once
Cause you only live once 
Once, once

Right, fuck it
Pass the deuce, 'member creepin’ through the 'jects
Had to, stash the deuce in my 40 ‘Low boots
International, my bread is well earned
L's burn, smash hoes in Melboure
Light skinned jawn, look like Chanel Imon
One night, got her hooked, like I’m heroin
Vintage Vans and puffin’ on chron
Posted, lookin’ like a slimmer Daron
Give me some to a 112 song
Smoke a nigga like a Newport Long
Pass off to my man, be a baton
‘Cause it ain’t no if fun if the homies don’t get none
Right, it's like ballin' on a bitty
Bunch of bad bitches from different cities
Illest niggas in New Yiddy
Kush God, Joey Bada$$, relax and stack the skrilly

This the song I wrote if I died
I was on the 50 mile doing 9-5
Beating the pussy like he ain't got 9 lives
And I'm high, mix Ciroc and some blunts, cause you only live once
Cause you only live once 
Once, once

Late night cruisin', fusing the green with the cuban
So swift we moving through clouds intruding
Celestial Nubians, known them since
I was a Brand Nubian and they influenced him
And now it’s new beginnin’s, catch me sinnin’ in Sin City
Sittin’ and spinnin’ and spittin’ in ya city
Swimmin’ in ya bitty, put kin in her kitty and breasts
Got protection in the vest, but still penetrate correct
The vets, I got the remedy for these bitches
Inject, enter sex and eject get some intellect
And jet cuz all we do is flex on the weekends
They upset cause I learned how to flex on the weakest
End of my strength they drenched in they trenches
The fence in my terrace is gold, leave ya defenseless in the cold
And I know all you nigga’s weaknesses
Through my threshold, sight on some instinctive shit

Smoke Fairies,"Eyes blurry and red
Trains roar through my head
London churns like it wants me for dead

River do you see?
You're circling me
Angry waters that long for the sea

Oh I can feel it breathe inside
The devil in my mind
Oh I can feel it seeping in
The cold the city brings

Feet following feet
Through dark desolate streets
Thoughts collide like the light lines that bleed

Sky eerily bright
Plane trails through the night
Birds sing lost and confused by the light

Oh I can feel it breathe inside
The devil in my mind
Oh I can feel it seeping in
The cold the city brings",Devil in My Mind,2010
Smoke Fairies,"Out of the woods, I heard a dragon calling
Too far away to ever hurt me
He was alone, he was alone
He was alone in the valley

I went back down to my village
To bring them back the news of my wandering
It was too late, they had not escaped
And I was alone in the valley

Now in my dreams, I feel truly alone
Shots in my head and the crunching of bones
A scream to the hills, a scream to the hills
A scream to the dragon to take me",Dragon,2010
Smoke Fairies,"Late night hotel room
A thin rain falls through the gloom
I don't know where we are
I see five lanes of passing cars

Then something deep inside flickers on like a strip light
'Cause I've got a reason to glow
Got a reason to treat you like I love you

One blue shivering star
Neon shapes from the bar
On shining rain drenched streets
Got blue light beneath my feet

Then something deep inside flickers on like a strip light
'Cause I've got a reason to glow
Got a reason to treat you like I love you

You're like a light beam through my shaking skies
You're like a new day breaking up inside
You're like daylight to my waking eyes
You woke me up, you woke me up

'Till this moment fades
Electric blue turns to grey
I'll take all that I can
'Till the sparks fly through my hands

'Cause it's just a hotel room
And we're only human
But I've got something to prove
And a reason to treat you like I love you

You're like a light beam through my shaking skies
You're like a new day breaking up inside
You're like daylight to my waking eyes
You woke me up, you woke me up",Hotel Room,2010
Smoke Fairies,"Hold me now while there's time left for us
When the morning comes I'll be missing your touch
The rising sun's no friend of mine anymore

The rest of the street can turn out their light
But I want to see what will go out of sight
Wish for endless darkness so I could hold on tight

Oh my baby there's so much to loose
And the only thing that stays is those morning blues
Oh my darling I can keep no one
And the only truth I know is in the morning you'll be gone

Empty rooms is all that I have
And the lonely beat
The drip of the tap
It's a welcome heart beat
For someone not coming back

Oh my baby there's so much to loose
And the only thing that stays is those morning blues
Oh my darling I can keep no one
And the only truth I know is in the morning you'll be gone",Morning Blues,2010
Smoke Fairies,"The storm came and tore leaves down
And the branches ached out loud
Like they were screaming
All night the wind took hold
And shook this hollow house
And woke the demons
And I knew I wasn't right in the head

The letter hadn't come
The one you sent before you had to leave me
And I'm never going to know what it said

Some things are secrets people die with
Some things are secrets people die with

At first light a lonesome bird
Sang a song of brooding pain
To fain believing
And I thought about the way
We learn to carry on through the grieving
And the leaves still cling to the evergreens

Some things",Storm Song,2010
Smoke Fairies,"Leaving the keys behind me
I felt you in the dust
A feeling crept inside me
Like twisted wire and rust

Goes where the headlights led me
The ancient trade routes call
The trees close in around me
Too dark to see them all

Broom dusters inside once more
Find out what you're breathing for
'Cause I like a distant call
That sends a strange moon rising

Dead branches in the distance
Your silhouette a shade
My primal fears awaken
You shout across the lake

Broom dusters inside once more
Find out what you're breathing for
'Cause I like your distant call
That sends a strange moon rising

Find out what you're breathing for

Smoke Fairies,"As the summer fades to a watery light
And autumn's hues are coming to life
Can we start something new?
Just me and you
Through low light and trees
A future unseen is a future I can believe

Through the coldest months I held onto
A dying hope that flickered in you
And we'll start something new further than you
As death is to birth
The moon to the earth
Find a future I can believe

Can you hold me like you held someone you shouldn't have let go?
Can you keep me deep inside like the regrets that burnt a hole?
Can you love me like you loved someone you loved so long ago?

Take me far away, a late night drive
See headlights flash in a stranger's eyes
And I'll start something new
Just me and you
Through low light and trees
A future unseen is a future I can believe

Smoke Fairies,"I saw your eyes glancing back in the mirror
Bright lights streaming faster
At night in the motel I dream of the car
Crashing through the wild pastures

Is there much further now?
Are you loosing the meaning?

Insects and moths spiral lost in the headlights
They're fragile disasters
Is this the year when we lose our direction?
Is time flying past us?

Is there much further now?
Are you loosing the meaning?

Counting the miles between every sign
There must be something out here to find
Follow me on and drive through the night
Follow me back into the daylight

Cumulus clouds always towering higher
I'm harbouring feelings
Every place hides a life we could make
If we started believing

Is there much further now?
Are you losing the meaning?

Someone's coming after you.
When you awake, to the billboards on your way to work,
Someone's coming after you.

They're stealing your lives and they're selling them back to you
And look at the lives we waste.
They're feeding the lines in the interest of commerce,
Excuses for wars we wage.
They've got the bombs and the guns to look after
The country's economy.
But we've got a plan to get back all the hours 
And days and the years that they take.

We say, we'll smoke this city to the filter,
We'll empty every bottle, you'll see us by the river.

I see my strengths and my weaknesses
There's children safe in their mother's arms
But photos can be misleading
Right on the branches of my family trees
That's where the young ones are dwindling - with lies

So will we learn? Talk together into the night
Can we help this home to survive?
We need the strength of our family's arms
Not a false sense of solidarity

Walk together and we could work this out
Talk together and we could understand
We need the strength of our family's arms
I wish I knew where to go from here

I see the sadness in all their eyes
I understand why this burdens them
It's written on my grandfather's arms
Indian ink tells the story there

Out on the branches of my family trees
That's where the young ones are suffering - with lies

So will we learn? Fought together into the night
Can we help this home to survive?
We need the strength of our family's arms
Not a false sense of solidarity

Walk together and we could work this out
Talk together and we could understand
We need the strength of our family's arms
I wish I knew where to go from here

We were aloud to take this on
But this can't be here when we are gone
Giving what we have now is to make this time
That we have left last forever

All that we have left is to make this time
Last forever - Then we'll have learned

Protect what you love
And show what you mean

Smokey,"Sally called, when she got the word
She said ""I suppose you've heard about Alice""
Well, I rushed to the window, and I looked outside
And I could hardly believe my eyes
This big limousine pulled slowly into Alice's drive 

Oh, I don't know why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go
I guess she's got her reasons but I just don't want to know
'Cause for twenty four years I've been living next door to Alice
Twenty four years, just waitin' for a chance
To tell her how I'm feeling, maybe get a second glance
Now I've gotta get used to not living next door to Alice 

Grew up together, two kids in the park
Carved our initials deep in the bark me and Alice
Now she walks to the door, with her head held high
Just for a moment, I caught her eye
As the big limousine pulled slowly out of Alice's drive 

Oh, I don't know why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go
I guess she's got her reasons but I just don't want to know
'Cause for twenty four years I've been living next door to Alice
Twenty four years, just waitin' for a chance
To tell her how I'm feeling, maybe get a second glance
Now I've gotta get used to not living next door to Alice 

Sally called back, and asked how I felt
She said ""I know how to help, you get over Alice""
She said ""Now Alice is gone, but I'm still here
You know I've been waiting twenty four years""
And the big limousine disappeared 

I don't know why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go
I guess she's got her reasons but I just don't want to know
'Cause for twenty four years I've been living next door to Alice

Is it awaiting on a new moon day?
Tell me, just light my love for you

And in the morning when you rise

I can change this path, where I'm going you'll be far away

When you look at me
Don't ask me why
There's nothing left for me to stay.

Can you feel my broken heart?

You wouldn't understand.

A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone

A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone

Enchantment strange as the blue up above

Times were hard and things were bad
But there's a silver linin' inside every cloud
Just poor people that's all we were

Tryin' to make a livin' out of black land earth
But we'd get together in a family circle singin' loud

Daddy sang bass, Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
Singin' seems to help a troubled soul

One of these days and it won't be long
I'll rejoin them in a song
I'm gonna join the family circle at the throne

No, the circle won't be broken
Bye and bye, Lord, bye and bye
Daddy'll sing bass, Mama'll sing tenor
Me and little brother will join right in there
In the sky, Lord in the sky

Now I remember after work
Mama would call in all of us
You could hear us singin' for a country mile
Now little brother has done gone on

But I'll rejoin him in a song
We'll be together again up yonder in a little while

Daddy sang bass, Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
Singin' seems to help a troubled soul

One of these days and it won't be long
I'll rejoin them in a song
I'm gonna join the family circle at the throne

No, the circle won't be broken

I'd sail away to the west
I'd sail all around this whole wide world

If I had listened to what Mama said
I would not have been here today
A lyin' around this old jailhouse
Just weepin' my sweet life away

If I was on some foggy mountain top
I'd sail away to the west
I'd sail all around this whole wide world
To the girl, I love the best

She caused me to weep, she caused me to mourn
She caused me to leave my home
Oh, those lonesome pines and those good ol' times

And the gun went blam
And I got splattered

He made her mighty funny
Made her lips taste just like honey

When you threw a stone
And you broke a window pane

You were so afraid of what you done
That I held your hand little one
And I wouldn’t let you run

Then you turned to me
With a look of shame on your face
And your eyes asked a question ever so tenderly

Oh, who will take the blame?
Who's gonna bear the shame?
Right then, I knew, how it would always be
Put the blame, put it on me

Ooh, at the age of twelve
You were a fine young thing
But I felt much older 'cause I had to shoulder
The trouble you'd bring

Like the time you pushed Sonny down
And she cried on me
With those same big eyes
You turned and you looked at me

Oh, who will take the blame?
Who's gonna bear the shame?
Right then, I knew, how it would always be
Put the blame, put it on me
Put it on me, put it on me

Now you're all grown up
And you're running wild
And they're so surprised
'Cause all along you seemed
Like such a sweet child

And there's nothing but bad news
From old friends I meet
How you've become
A woman of the street

And they give me a million
And one reasons why
But when I analyze it
I know where the real fault lies

Oh, who will take the blame?
Who's gonna bear the shame?
No doubt about it, oh, this time rightfully
Put the blame, put it on me.

Oh, who will take the blame?
Who's gonna bear the shame?

Smokey Robinson,"What's it all about, this crazy love
How did our two worlds entwine
How do I fit in to your life
How did you get into mine
I belong to someone else we know

Back when first we met
Oh, we thought for fun
One night together might be nice
Oh...oh...but fun turned into love for both of us
So now we pay forbidden lover's price

Oh, ‘cause love like ours is never, ever free (Free)
You pay some agony for the ecstasy (For the ecstasy)
Oh, love like ours is never, ever free (Free)
You got to pay some agony for the ecstasy (For the ecstasy), oh…oh…

Nights when you're alone, you know that I
Laid with someone else beside me
Oh, but you love me still and I love you
You know I would no matter where I'd be

Hey, but love like ours is never, ever free (Free)
You got to pay some agony for the ecstasy (For the ecstasy)
Oh, love like ours is never, ever free (Free)
We got to pay some agony if we wanna have ecstasy (For the ecstasy), oh...

Hey, got to pay some agony
If we wanna have an ecstasy, yeah…eah…
And we need each other desperately, don't we, baby
And I'll never from you be free, no, no
So you'll have to do the leavin' me, yeah
And you'll have to do the leavin' me, oh, baby
‘Cause I'm gonna pay the agony, yeah
‘Cause, oh, lovin' you is ecstasy, that's what it is
And I'm willin' to pay the price, oh
‘Cause I'll make it a sacrifice, oh, yes, I will
And I'll never, never, never, never, never, never, never be free

You trusted him and gave him your love,
A love he proved unworthy of.
 
To bad it was him that you trusted, 
too bad but you can't be disgusted.
It's time that you got readjusted 
and realized that tear filled eyes can never stop him now.
Yeah!  That man is on his way 
I think he's gone to stay, you'd better drop him now.Yeah!

All you've gotta do is dry your eyes long enough to see,
that you have got the love you thought you had in him,
Here in me, love is hope, girl, love is strength.
Here's someone standin' right beside you who would go to any length 
to give you love, true and deep,
And hope you realize at last you've found a love that you can keep, 
and only losers weep.

Smokey Robinson,"People say I'm the life of the party
Because I tell a joke or two
Although I might be laughing loud and hearty
Deep inside I'm blue
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place

If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
I need you, need you
Since you left me if you see me with another girl
Seeming like I'm having fun
Although she may be cute

She's just a substitute
Because you're the permanent one
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears

I need you, need you
Outside I'm masquerading
Inside my hope is fading
Just a clown oh yeah
Since you put me down
My smile is my make up

I wear since my break up with you
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer, it's easy to trace

You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

I'd like to know if your love
Is a love I can be sure of

Haven't they noticed the changes in you?
Or can it be that like love I am blind,
Do I want it so much 'til it's all in my mind?

I never felt before the way you make me feel.

I had just become twenty-one (I remember).
I had a lot to live, said I had a lot to give,
Til a man comes to give me a gun.

And though that war he sent me to didn't claim me,
If I'm bitter don't blame me.
It's just my Soul responding.

Don't you try to tell me I'm un-patriotic.
I deserve an explanation!
I can't help but wonder,
If you really got it.

This land once belonged to my father,
And to his father before him too.
Let me tell you now, I'm on a reservation,
Living in a state of degradation.
What's a Soul suppose to do?

Cause I'm out,
Pushin, right?
I'm not in doubt.
When it's just my Soul responding,

To seeing little hungry children in the ""Land of Plenty"".
Just my Soul responding.
To doing lots of deeds.
But never having any.

When I found out yesterday 
Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh I heard it through the grapevine
Oh I'm just about to lose my mind
 
Honey, honey yeah.
I heard it through the grapevine 
Not much longer would you be mine baby
 
I know a man ain't supposed to cry 
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losin' you would end my life you see
'Cause you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself 
That you loved some one else
Instead I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
 
Honey, honey yeah
I heard it through the grapevine 
Not much longer would you be mine, baby
 
People say believe half of what you see
Son and none of what you hear
But I can't help but be confused
If it's true please tell me dear
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy you loved before?

Don't you know I heard it through the grapevine 
Not much longer would you be mine, baby yeah

Now you say every time you need some affection
The one you love goes in another direction
And you just sit there in a daze reminiscing
When you know some other lips he's been kissing

Now when you need the love 
He's never shown you 
Come round here 
And when you need some loving arms 
To hold you 
Come round here 
Now I may not be the one you want 
Oh but I know I'm the one you need 
Said I may not be the one you want 
Ooh, but I know I'm the one you need

Your life stands still the minute he goes
You count the hours just hoping he shows
Girl can't you see while you're longing for his touch
That I'm the one who loves you so much
While you're longing for his embrace
You're all alone there with tears on your face

Now when you feel the need to cry to someone cry to me
And when you feel the need to lean on someone lean on me
Now I may not be the one you want but 
I'm sure 'nough the one you need 
Oh baby I may not be the one you want 
Ooh, but I know I'm the one you need

Now the days the days you sit alone by yourself
He's out fooling 'round with somebody else
Leaving you alone here with nothing to do
Just waiting 'till he has time for you

Now when the loneliness 
Gets hard to bear 
Girl come round here 
And when you need a little tender loving care

it's only there trying to fool the public

Oh, sadder than sad, you're gone and I'm hurting so bad
like a clown I pretend to be glad
 
Now there's some sad things known to man 
but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown, when there's no one around
Oh yeah, baby,
 
Now if I appear to be carefree, 
it's only to camouflage my sadness
in order to shield my pride 
I try to cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But Don't let my show convince you 
that I've been happy since you decided to go,
I need you so, I'm hurt and I want you to know
but for others I put on a show
 
Now there's some sad things known to man 
but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown,

Just like Pagliacci did
I try to keep my sadness hid
smiling in the public eye
but in my lonely room I cry 
the tears of a clown

Only you beneath the moon or under the sun
Whether near to me, or far
It's no matter darling where you are

You make my life so rich
You know you could've been some money
And baby you're so sweet
You know you could have been some honey

Well you could of been anything that you wanted to
I can tell
The way you do the things you do

Well you could of been

As pretty as you are
You know you could've been a flower
If good looks were minutes
You know you could have been an hour
The way you stole my heart
You know you could have been a crook
And baby your so smart
You know you could have been a school book

Well you could of been anything that you wanted to

Smokey Robinson,"Hear the children cryin',
But I know they cry not in vain.
Now the times are changin';
Love has come to bloom again.

Smelling the air when spring comes by raindrops
Reminds us of youthful days.
But now it's not rain that water the cane crops,
But the sweat from man's brow;
The substance from our spine.
We gotta keep on living, living on borrowed time:
Hallelujah time!

Yes, you can hear the children singing: hallelujah time!
As they go singing by and by: hallelujah time!
Oh, ""hallelujah"" singing in the morning.
Hallelujah time! let them sing; don't let them cry.

Over rocks and mountains
The sheep are scattered all around.
Over hills and valleys,
They are everywhere to be found.
But though we bear our burdens now,
All afflictions got to end somehow:
From swinging the hammer, pulling the plough.

Why won't you let us be, to live in harmony?
We like to be free like birds in a tree.

Hallelujah time! yes, you can hear the children singing.
Hallelujah time! yes, as they go singing by and by.
Hallelujah time! oh ""hallelujah"" singing in the morning.
Let them sing; never let them cry.
Hallelujah time! ""hallelujah"" singin' in the morning.",Hallelujah Time,2007

He was spreading a new dance all around
In just a matter of a few days, yea!
His dance became the new teenage craze.
 
When the people see him dancing,
They begin to see,
To see this cat do that monkey thing.
It's really something to see,

Doing the monkey.

It's only there trying to fool the public
But when it comes down to fooling you
Now honey that's quite a different subject.

Don't let my glad expression
Give you the wrong impression
Really I'm sad
Oh sadder than sad

You're gone and I'm hurting so bad
Like a clown I pretend to be glad.
Now there's some sad things known to man
But ain't too much sadder than the tears of a clown.

When there's no one around.
Just like pagliaccic did
I try to keep my sadness hid;
Smiling in the public eye

But in my lonely room
I cry the tears of a clown
When there's no one around.
Oh yeah baby

Now if there's a smile upon my face
Don't let my glad expression
Give you the wrong impression
Don't let the smile I wear

Make you think I don't care.
Now if I appear to be carefree
It's only to camouflage my sadness
In order to shield my pride I try

To cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But don't let my show convince you
That I've been happy since you decided to go.
Oh I need you so.

What kind of fuckery has been required lately
It seems like these MC's heads need deflating
And I'ma play the pin cause I've been waiting
Now make my mark on pop culture from my generation
80s babies from the age of Nintendo
Transformers, Ninja Turtles, Hungry Hippos
GI Joes, Phot, can't forget the clothes
Kangaroos with the zipper had a couple those
Breaking into heavy spinning on my elbows
Couldn't get me out my _______

Comon ya'll
Lets talk about the scene for a minute
I know we ain't been seen in a minute
We left it for a minute now we all up in it
Baby boy if you've got them big dreams go and get it
Never been the type with tight jeans, I wont fit it
When I see those scene girls, bet they all gonna get it
And I'm living clean
Now a lot of ya'll won't get it
Now it's mean but I don't give a damn if ya'll don't get it
So fresh and so clean in my new jean
While I'm laughing at the bacon, you're all crying a the clinic
I read a couple blogs and they had my ass livid
But now I've got my own to whirl, gotta live with it
Never played basketball, but I could show you how to dribble
Make your moves in that black hatch back Honda Civic
Like I did in high school, wishin' I could relive it
But I can't so let's go on, give the hook a revisit

Ooo hey, well I'll be damned

Catch me if you can, catch
Catch me if you can

Maybe I'm wrong
But after twenty six years I feel I've payed my dues
So when you play this song
Just know that I live my life the way I choose
And now I stand here proudly in L.A.
At a sold out crowd
And when no one's around
I refuse, to be as inferior to you

Till the dark of night, while the moon is new
While we whisper words of love in our secret rendezvous

You can afford the best of life
I'm just a heartbreakin' boy
Oh you've given your love to me
Girl, I can't let you hurt yourself by being seen with me
We're worlds apart, so close yet very far
So we must hide the love we're feelin' in our hearts
We meet in shadows, your friends must never know
That we are lovers, darlin'
Although it hurts me so, for your sake no one must see
The press of love you're givin' me
But you know, I need you baby

One day I'll make the break, my love will start to shine
I can tell the world that you are mine, all mine
Till then we must go on the way we have before
And never let it show without each other's souls

When you threw a stone
And you broke a window pane

That I held your hand little one
And I wouldn’t let you run

Then you turned to me
With a look of shame on your face
And your eyes asked a question ever so tenderly

Oh, who will take the blame?
Who's gonna bear the shame?
Right then, I knew, how it would always be
Put the blame, put it on me

Ooh, at the age of twelve
You were a fine young thing
But I felt much older 'cause I had to shoulder
The trouble you'd bring

Like the time you pushed Sonny down
And she cried on me
With those same big eyes
You turned and you looked at me

Oh, who will take the blame?
Who's gonna bear the shame?
Right then, I knew, how it would always be
Put the blame, put it on me
Put it on me, put it on me

Now you're all grown up
And you're running wild
And they're so surprised
'Cause all along you seemed
Like such a sweet child

And there's nothing but bad news
From old friends I meet
How you've become
A woman of the street

And they give me a million
And one reasons why
But when I analyze it
I know where the real fault lies

Oh, who will take the blame?
Who's gonna bear the shame?
No doubt about it, oh, this time rightfully
Put the blame, put it on me.

And your heart spoke my name

You were made for me
Everyone can see your love is me

Smokey Robinson & the Miracles,"Now you say every time you need some affection
The one you love goes in another direction
And you just sit there in a daze reminiscing
When you know some other lips he's been kissing

Now when you need the love 
He's never shown you 
Come round here 
And when you need some loving arms 
To hold you 
Come round here 
Now I may not be the one you want 
Oh But I know I'm the one you need 
Said I may not be the one you want 
But I know I'm the one you need

Your life stands still the minute he goes
You count the hours just hoping he shows
Girl can't you see while you're longing for his touch
That I'm the one who loves you so much
While you're longing for his embrace
You're all alone there with tears on your face

Now when you feel the need to cry to someone cry to me
And when you feel the need to lean on someone lean on me
Now I may not be the one you want but 
I sure 'nuff the one you need 
Oh baby I may not be the one you want 
But I know I'm the one you need

Now the days the days you sit alone by yourself
He's out fooling round with somebody else
Leaving you alone here with nothing to do
Just waiting 'till he has time for you

Now when the loneliness 
Gets hard to bear 
Girl come round here 
And when you need a little tender loving care 
Girl come round here 
Now I may not be the one you want 
But I know I'm the one you need

On the high tide

Smokie,"Rich girl she buys her dreams.
It's a rich world behind the scenes.
Green eyes they tell it all.
The more she takes the harder they fall.
She ain't easy and she ain't tough.
She's had it good, but then she's had it rough.
And I guess it don't come to much.
Cos with everything she's got she's never got enough.

[Chorus]
So she'll cry just a little for a few dollars more.
She'll lie just a little like she's done it before.
She'll take it, she'll fake it for a few dollars more.
She'll show you her heart, then show you the door.
You know she'll die just a little for a few dollars more.
Even fly just a little like she's done it before.
She'll take it, she'll fake it for a few dollars more.
She'll show you her heart, then show you the door.

Strange things can happen to you.
When you've got so much and you've got nothing to do.
Oh oh oh what do you know.
How do you get there when there's nowhere to go.
And so you wonder just what she'll do.
She's never known love but then she's never known you.
And it's too bad those sad green eyes.
Are so full of questions and so full of lies.

And your jeans were clinging
You were driving me out of my mind
On a hot afternoon when there's nothin' to do
You're not the sort of thing a fellow should find
          
So I pulled on over, you tossed your hair off your shoulder
As you turned and looked my way
Oh you would have died or you'd have skinned me alive
If I'd said what I wanted to say
So, being polite, said ""What you doin' tonight?""
You said ""Just so happens I'm free.""

You run to me.

It's no one there to comfort you.
And in the end find you need a friend
To tell your troubles to.

Think how it used to be.

Smokie,"I met a girl in L.A. and she seemed alright to me,
She said she'd give me loving and she said it would be free,
She told me she would call me or leave a message at the door,
And left me wondering what I was in for.

By the next time that I saw her I had clean forgot her name
And without her fancy make-up she just didn't look the same,
So I totally ignored her and she sadly turned away,
And through sympathy I told her she could stay.

Oh poor lady, midnight baby,
No one wants your love at all,
Oh poor lady, midnight baby,
Now you're heading for a fall,
And you really think your're something,
you know all the things to do
But poor lady, just a baby,
There's a hundred more like you.

Now for two weeks more she was at my door,
She would stay with me for days,
As a lover she was frightening in so many different ways,
But when it came to conversation she was totally absurd,
Oh she'd sit for hours and never say a word.

Oh poor lady, midnight baby,

Now you're heading for a fall,
And you really think your're something,

She spends her days in different ways, still trying to be hip,
And at night she'll find she'll lose her mind, at a club along the strip,
When her money goes she always knows she got something she can sell,
It's the one thing that she really can do well.

The words were music as she turned away.

I'll meet you at midnight...

Each hour that pass seem like a thousand years.

There'll be a way
I've got somethin' I wanna say

I need to ask you some things
About what life has offered you
The ice, the cars, those things
It really don't mean a thing

What does it mean to gain the world
And in the end lose your soul
(Soul!)
I think I outta let you know
That these things don't last for life

Life's not promised to anyone
Live today and love someone
Don't live life so critical
Make up for your miracle

Life's not promised to anyone
Live today and love someone
Don't live life so critical
Make room for your miracle

Show me something greater than love
And I'll show you the greatest mistake
'Cause love can't be explained
You gotta give it everyday

Family's all we have
And the Lord is truly all we need
If it had not been for him
Tell me where would we be

There's just something about the love of Christ
'Cause I know You give eternal life
You will never, never, never, never know
A love like this
So I'm crying out, life is my promise
Life, your life is my promise

Live today and love someone

Jesus is love",Jesus Is Love,2009
Smokie Norful,"I was preaching a sermon one Sunday and uh
It was about, it was a parable
And it was talking about the uh, the disciples and Jesus
When they were going through a corn field
And they began to pick the corn

And the Pharisees, the legalistics of the day, they came
And they were chastising them that
'Why are you doing this on the Sabbath?'

They had this whole discourse and dialog between the two of them
Jesus was saying, 'Listen, do you, do you not remember that you
You, yourself aren't even worthy
You guys break unleavened bread on, on the Sabbath
And you kill the sacrifice, you clean the sacrifice'

They have a need and it's my job and my responsibility
To meet their need and I'm at their need
I trump the synagogue, I trump the Sabbath
I'm lowered of your life, I'm lowered of everything that is you
I'm lowered of this, this day, recognize who you're talking to

But in the course of the whole thing what I realize is that
The dialog was between the Pharisees or the religious leaders of the day
Was between the dignitaries, the officials of the Church and Jesus
The disciples never uttered a word

He literally started embodying his permanent position in our lives
Because he stepped in between the law and the people
He says, 'No, I'm Grace and because of Me
They don't have to defend themselves to you'

'I'll do all the talking, My blood will speak through all of eternity
I have justified them, even in their wrong, I know that they are wrong
I know that they make mistakes, I know that they are not perfect
I know that they do things that are not pleasing'

'But even in their wrong, My blood will speak on their behalf
And I will just', somebody should have shouted right there
Because He didn't kill you for all the sinful acts that you committed
But he justified you

God bless me with this song, it simply speaks the life of that message
And I'm just excited to be able to share it with you

Hey, justified me, glorified me
Paid my ransom and I've been redeemed by his blood
Go to Calvary, I've been made free
Despite my enemy, I thank God, I'm justified

Paid a price for my life
And all that was wrong, His love made it right
Now what greater sign can any man show?
That know with his own blood He made me whole

He justified me, glorified me
Paid my ransom and I've been redeemed by his blood
Go to calvary, I've been made free
Despite my enemy, I thank God, I'm justified

If my sins had their way I never would have made it
With a debt I just couldn't afford to pay, He came and saved me
When the enemy said that I couldn't, God said go ahead
Because you're covered by me awesome, awesome powerful blood

Though I, I should've been dead and never kept alive
God's grace and his mercy were on every side
When it looks like I can't, God says I can
And he won't let me fall in the enemy's hand

Oh, I'm just glad to know that God saved me
His grace and his mercy
They watched over me all night long
If it had not been, if it had not been
If it had not been, if it had not been
If it had not been for the lord that was on my side
Hey, listen I got some testimonies listen

Just like Nineveh that was headed for destruction
God stepped in and he said
(Not guilt)
You gonna live and you won't see the day of destruction
(Oh oh oh)

Just like Daniel who was condemned to the lion's den, God said
(Not guilt)
You're gonna live
(You're gonna live, yeah)

Just like David who was dearly beloved in spite of God said
(Not guilt)
Yeah
Hey
(Let's talk about you)

If you be honest with yourself tonight
If it hadn't been for the grace of God
You would've been, you could've been
Yeah, listen, hey

To the liar
(Not guilt)
To the cheater
(Not guilt)

To the deceiver
(Not guilt)
Even to the believer
(Not guilt)

There is their point no condemnation to them
(Not guilt)
That are in Christ Jesus
(Not guilt)

Yeah, yeah
(Not guilt)
Hey

Some of y'all got it twisted, listen
(Not guilt)
If it hadn't been for God
(God did it)

You wouldn't have made it
Hey, don't get confused about who kept you
Hey
(God did it)

When the enemy said that I couldn't, God did it
(God did it)
When my haters said that I wouldn't, God did it

Hey, I thought we'd never get out of the poor house but
(God did it)
I thought we'd never see the White House but I'm claiming it

Hey and if you be honest He's been over your house

Be honest about it, who kept you? Yeah

Hey, just shout God did it

Point to heaven and give him glory, God did it

Come on and testify, hey

But God, but God, but God
They said I wouldn't but God

They say I should've been sick but God

Smokie Norful,"As a little boy I used to dream of the big stage
Couldn't wait to see my name in lights
I had a dream so big, it made a mountain look small
Couldn't wait till I had it all

The closer I'd get, the more distant I'd feel

The more I thought I had, the less it all seemed real

Suddenly I found, the only thing for me that counts
And I can't imagine my life without you

Once in a lifetime you find a love you know is real
Once in a lifetime you find something that makes your song live
Once in a lifetime you find a friendship that's worth the wait
Once in a lifetime you find joy you can't replace
	
I used to think that it was the trophies on my wall
Thought if I won then I'd have it all
And I couldn't wait till everybody knew my name
I had my own idea of fame

The closer I'd get, the more distant I'd feel
The more I thought I had, the less it all seemed real
Suddenly I found, the only thing for me that counts
I can't imagine my life without you

Once in a lifetime you find a love you can't let go
Once in a lifetime you find the purpose to live on
Once in a lifetime you find the meaning of your dreams
And once in a lifetime you find the one who gives life meaning
Once in a lifetime you find a love you know is real
Once in a lifetime you find something that makes your song live
Once in a lifetime you find a friendship that's worth the wait
Once in a lifetime you find joy you can't replace

Once in a lifetime I've found the best thing I know
Once in lifetime there's no sign of letting go
Once in a lifetime I wouldn't change a single thing
Once in a lifetime you made my whole world sing
I'll never look beyond your love again
Because I know what I've found is truth",Once in a Lifetime,2012
Smokie Norful,"In corridors of air the clouds were waiting there
They knew that never again the skies would be so blue
They took away the sun and with it took the fun
It's true, and now there is really nothing I can do
So I look outside my window at the sheets of pouring rain
And I wonder if the sun will come again
But the sun will never shine the way it used to do
The clouds won't let it through
Oh the sun will never shine its smile for me and you
The clouds won't let it through

It wasn't long ago the people that I knew were glad
And nothing they ever thought about was sad
But since the sun has gone their laughing times are none
That's bad, to make them forget the happy times they've had
So they look outside their window at the sheets of pouring rain
And they wonder if the sun will come again

But the sun will never shine the way it used to do
The clouds won't let it through
Oh the sun will never shine its smile for me and you
The clouds won't let it through",The Blood Will Never Loose Its Power,2012

To figure out the reason why
You, used my life
As a sign and a guiding light

I'm a bird with one wing,
A song with no melody
But somehow I fly and sing because of how you see me

You say I'm free
How do you see the good in imperfect me

There are better things to do with your time
And while there's people searching for you everywhere
Yet and still you find me sitting in my chair

So many thoughts run through my head
Wondering when my turn will come

Is ungrateful for the little things

That He gave His only begotten Son
The Son gave His life for me

There is no greater love
No love nowhere, no greater love

Wings with no direction
Tossed over waves of emptiness
Looking glass with no reflection
But at the end of my rope
You came and gave me hope

When I needed faith, you were an answered prayer
When I needed life, you were a breath of air
When my soul was a desert, you were a fountain
When I needed a rock, you were a mountain

Why at the bottom in the dark
Would someone reach down and touch me
Light drove the shadows from my heart
What a way to say you love me
This time I won't lose my way
Holding your hand everyday

But life goes on
And this old world will keep on turning

We had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges
That were burning

Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me
One more time
For the good times

I'll get along
You'll find another
And I'll be here
If you should find you ever need me

Smokin' Suckaz Wit Logic,"When I pull my hat down low
Then I know it's time to throw
On a funky rhythm so I flow
Now here we go
Follow me follow me follow me down the line
Walk strong, don't need a 9 on my waistline
Niggaz thought that I would slip but I got grip
My mic is loaded and my mind is filled wit many clips
So bring your bulletproof vest 'cause I'm a sharp shooter
Tear a hole in your ass like Roto Rooter
So step if ya want to step, step if ya want to
I'll bust your shit from here to Tijuana
The stage is mine wherever I wreck shop
And if you're steppin' to my crew
You're gettin' dropped
'cause I'm like dat

I'm home all alone got a thought in my temple
Writing to the rhythm 'cause to me it's kind of simple
To slam another jam while the dog is on the cut
You want to bust my shit but ya couldn't bust a nut
You're weak in you mind and your body's lookin' shabby
I'll be cooklin' in my limo while you're chillin' wit your cabby
I strive to survive forward is my motion
I hear a lot of noize what's all the commotion
Ya ain't sayin' nothin' just another sucka frontin'
Slide to the side or I'm gonna bust your fronts in
Cause a lot of damage
Nigga here's your bandage
Tried to hang wit gee ya just couldn't manage

Large is my crew
The crew is very large
Always got my back so I don't need a bodyguard
Wear the camouflage if it need to be worn
When I leave the stage you know the stage is torn
Word is born I can flow to the flow that is flowin'
Up the creek without a paddle ya wonder how I'm rowin'
Suckaz I be mowin' when the trucks come to a towin'
Better grab your girl heard that she's hoe'n
Real good looker ya gotta see the hooker
Saw her wit D-Smooth I wonder where he took her
I used to hang wit Danniel had a friend his name was Booker
Sucka tried to play me so I slammed like Jimmy Snucka
'cause I'm like dat

1993 the year of takin' no shorts
SSL crew playin' suckaz like a new sport
Or should I say a new game ya better learn the rulez
Back in '91 we got a rep playin' toolz
But some never learn
They never learn
When will they learn
Burn baby baby burn baby baby burn
Stay on the hush
'Cause we're settin' it off wit an old school bum rush
And I see another victim
So I stick'em and kick'em then lyrically I vic'em
Leave the mind to rust in the dust
As I bust another dope jam 'cause I must slam
When I got a mic in my hand
Don't want to a Grammy if ya can't understand
I'm deep like an ocean
Smooth like a lotion
I've got the notion prepare the potion
Drink while I think
Ya sink in my rhythm
Cling when I sing and get shot like the jizm
Ya ask how I'm livin', well I'm livin'

When you were a part of me

Where you once belonged

Smoking Popes,"The bluest summer skies cloudless in your eyes
A little out of focus here
And the rain belongs to all the tender songs
That I might not ever sing to you

Don't be afraid of anything that faces you today
You might not know this but I'm with you all the way

If I could read the lines to find the smile you hide behind
I wonder what encouragement I'd find
If you could only see this photograph of you and me
It's always out of focus in my mind

[Chorus]

I only want to know if it could happen
I really want to know if it would be worth anything at all

The bluest summer skies cloudless in your eyes
A little out of focus here
And the rain belongs to all the tender songs
I'll be singing only for you

I am with you all the way [repeat until end of song]

It's got nothing to do with you""

Unless she was lying all those times

Que solo vivo de tus recuerdos solo suspiro

En vez de darte besos a ti solo le doy
Besos al aire

Ambos sabemos que fuiste mala
Tú misma fuiste la que cortó las alas
De este amor por esa traición que
Me partió en dos el corazón
Ahí no sé contigo que pasará
Solo te digo mamita que ya no te quiero mirar

Yo no sabia lo que perdía
Y me castigo todos los días al no tenerte
Que solo vivo de tus recuerdos solo suspiro
Pues te he perdido ahora lo sé
Y un día te fuiste sin despedirte

Hoy solo le doy besos al aire
Me estoy muriendo por tocarte
Hoy solo le doy besos al aire
Como quisiera acariciarte

Ya no te intereso no me extrañas
No me quieres ni mirar, ni mirar
Por un beso yo acabé las tentaciones
Veo tus labios lo siento mucho has perdonado
Las traiciones
Mira ahora por ser cobarde
En vez de darte besos a ti solo le doy
Besos al aire

Si alguna vez te dije te quiero
Yo te ofrecí un cariño sincero
Y que pasó te ganó la tentación
Y me partiste en dos el corazón
Ahí no sé contigo que pasará
Solo te digo mamita que ya no te quiero mirar

And mail it right away

May the angels have peace, God bless her in Heaven

Smoky Mountain Boys,"Some people are just like an automobile
They'll run fine when every thing is right
When the roads are all clear and the weather is fine
And there's plenty of sunshine and light

But often they come to a wash out
And then get stuck and have to detour
Maybe a break in the casting will prove
They never were built to endure

Get plenty of water and plenty of oil
And the best gasoline you can find
Have the engine tuned up and look out for your breaks
You'll have some hard places to climb

Look out for the tires for the blowouts will come
On a dangerous curve deep and neigh
But if you'll let Jesus take hold of the wheel
You'll make it to heaven on high

Some auto's are painted and polished so bright
They sell for more than they are worth
And some people think their profession
Will do stop short of the bibles new birth

Just start up your engine and then
You can tell if the thing is hitting on six
For if you depend on the looks of the car
You'll be in a terrible fix

Now all our profession's of powder and paint
Though lovely upon the outside
Won't answer to God for He looks on the heart
It matters not how hard we've tried

So if you are stuck in the quicksand of sin
And wondering and floundering about
Just let God's great engine of glory and grace
With a cable of love pull you out

Get plenty of water and plenty of oil
And the best gasoline you can find
Have the engine tuned up and look out for your breaks
You'll have some hard places to climb

Look out for the tires for the blowouts will come
On a dangerous curve deep and neigh
But if you'll let Jesus take hold of the wheel
You'll make it to heaven on high",Automobile of Life,2004

To carry mother away

In the sky, Lord, in the sky

""Undertaker, please drive slow
For this lady, you are hauling

Got 'em in the bottom of my ramblin' shoes
And when that whistle blows, I've gotta go
Oh Lordy, guess I'm never gonna lose

Was the only daughter of an engineer

Smoky Mountain Boys,"From the great Atlantic ocean to the wide Pacific shore
From the queen of flowing mountain to the south bell by the shore
She's mighty tall and handsome and know quite well by all
She’s the combination on the Wabash Cannonball

She came down from Birmingham one cold December day
As she rolled in the station you could hear all the people say
There's a girl from Tennessee she's long and she's tall
She came down from Birmingham on the Wabash Cannonball

Our estern states are dandies so the people always say
From New York to St. Louis and Chicago by the way
From the hills of Minnesota where the rippling waters fall
No changes can be taken on the Wabash Cannonball

Here’s to daddy Claxton may his name forever stand
And always be remembered 'round the courts of Alabama
His earthly race is over and the curtains 'round him fall
We'll carry home to victory on the Wabash Cannonball

Listen to the jingle the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland through the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear the lonesome hobos call
You’re traveling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball",Wabash Cannonball,2004

Smooth B.,"Woke up out of bed this morning at 5, face the light
Downstairs in the kitchen, 'erb tea, made a pot
Now I'm sipping, enjoying the best peppermint
when I heard a sound from the back like Devin
Is it peeps in my crib? Yo I spit
No fear, I kick em on up outta here
Approaching, larger and larger, bright light
Now clearer, my mirror

Mirror mirror mirror on the wall
Who is the top choice of them all?
Mirror mirror mirror on the wall
Who is the top choice?
Mirror mirror mirror on the wall
Who is the top choice of them all?
Mirror mirror (Tell me what you see)

Now I'm sorta perplexed, what's next?
I can't front, I'ma little bit nervous, no longer vexed
My imagination or H2O had to flow, hard to tell
For three-fourth's water is my shell
I take a step, it takes me light years, turn to molecules
See so many stars like follicles
I'm turning, spinning, twisting twisting I feel tight
At a 186 thousand miles per second, the speed of light
Suddenly I land in darkness, I'm there, where?
A 144 thousand degrees in the juice square
I see pyramids and sands
My ancestors making more noise than the lands and brass bands
Toby, what was to come of us before?
That I am the, original god man for sure
Now that was nothing, I didn't know worthwhile
but had to hear it, from the lord, my god within myself

[Chorus]

All around me were princes and thieves
Queens and sisters with long hair, some caught some with weaves
There were butter, gold, diamonds and coal
The rest is avoided, no mad selling, it's soul-to-soul
Then I asked the wise men, ""Why where I from is like hell?""
He said ""Indeed, for they know not where the true god dwell""
? don't stop, who be on top?
Who be the only one sheltered when the real bomb drop?
I said ""Back where I'm from, my peeps are scared to unite""
""They can't help it, for they been denied their birth right
Stripped of all culture, language, God
That's why Smooth B, times are so hard""
I cried ""I hate the other man"", then he said ""Smooth can
before you hate, examine his mind state""
Holy scientist turned darkside, why brothers
sit for 6000 years, he's made man will rule his father
For that vacuum in time
He told me when I touch back to Earth, bust heads with a rhyme
So, 4004 BC, go get'cha pilot
For the time has come, when only the fittest who seek survival
Started with the lies, then the murder of both wombs
Hid the truth like jewels and in Egyptian tombs
And today we bare scars
but we been around, before the Moon was split from Earth and replaced for
Mars
And we'll be around for eternity, made clearer
when we find the god within self, the true mirror

It don't feel, it don't feel, I can't feel it no more
Seems to me nowadays things have changed
I don't know if I feel the same

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Yo, in the land of the unseen hand, and hold trouble
Theorize your game, it's difficult to roll a double
The struggle ain't right up in your face, it's more subtle
But it's still comin' across like the bridge and tunnel vision
I try to school these bucks, but they don't wanna listen
That's the reason the system makin' its paper from the prison
And that's the reason we livin' where they don't wanna visit
Where the dope slang and keep swayin' like Sonny Liston
The money missin' and there's mouths to feed
Yet the brain kickin', thinkin' of a thousand things
Remember back in the days, when the kitchen had eggs
And pancakes, thicken and greens and Kool Aid
When the 'fridgerator naked then the cupboard is bare
People got to strip naked, stick 'em up in the air
Wasn't lies when they told you wasn't nothin' to fear
Somethin' don't feel right out here, know what im sayin'? Check it out

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Look, my eyes open cause I'm really a rocksmith
And when inviting me thoughts, I'm really unboxin'
My main adversary in this silly concoction
Freeze your face like bosilium toxin
If you ain't tryin' to get popped, then give me a option
Helicopters choppin' from Philly to Compton
The Jones is the richest since the Smiths & the Johnson's
If you ain't sayin' nothin', you a system's accomplice
It should play with your conscience, do away with the nonsense
I'm overseeing anything within my circumference
This ain't a press junket, I ain't seekin' responses
I stand where the people got the heat in they pocket
You mesmerized by the calm nonchalant-ness
I spit a dart, rub on some John Hitchcock shit
If you ain't speakin' your life, your rhyme's adopted
If it don't feel right, then stop it, you nahmsayin'?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
Yo, field you work in, weapon producin'
Natural disaster got the planet in a panic
We all gots to make that livin'
Sex, drugs, murder, politics and religion
Forms of hustlin', watch who you put all your trust in
Worldwide, we coincide with who sufferin'
Who never had shit and ain't got nothin'
But most strugglin', and make you wanna run up in the ma' fuckin'
With hots on for a piece of the cake back
I can't work for it, I can certainly take that
I'm fired up, thinkin' about the payback, except
You fuck around and be a enemy of the state, black
I'll, but that'd be too real for TV
It's crazy when you too real to be free

Smoothe Da Hustler,"The question is why the answer what makes
If you wants my opinion I tell you don't take x 2

Why...

(Smoothe Da Hustler)
Why is it hard for my words to get heard
The uncut give it to niggas raw gets absorb
Why is it that every black brother talks the slang
Why is it that slang determines if a brother hangs
Why is it that people judge niggas by how they look
Why is it that hoodies on my head makes me a crook
Why is it that people got to struggle to survive
Why is it that nine to five is harder to get in ninety-five
I wonder why that those that heard of me started making records all of a
sudden want to murder me
Why is it that niggas talk the talk but never walk the walk so I talk the
talk if niggas scared to walk New York
Why is it that those who chose to live the street life greet life with a
slug to his mug and scared to greet life
I wonder why it is harder for my family why it is the man in me that keeps
me thinking that no bodys understanding me

Chorus x 4

(Smoothe Da Hustler)
What makes a man a strong man
What makes a woman a strong woman
Don't confuse wrongg one
Cause intellectual keeps it exceptional for both
It is just my professional side that keeps me wondering without a loaf
What makes it possible for me to kick to you
Predict to you for future reference
For you to take heed but that's your preference
What makes two hundred and fifty seven degrees from one hundred eighty seven
five o's tapes Lp's and Cd's
What makes one hundred percent one hundred and ten percent to be quit foul
I am built like five percent is on my lifestlye
What makes my click my click
What makes my chick my chick
What makes my vic my vic
What makes my dick taste an slick
I wonder..
What makes a hustler crew is it what I slang to you
Or what I bring to you
Behind closed doors
Or what I bring to you from of the mind record
What makes me slow is this
What makes me grow is this
What makes me know and blow is this

Chorus x 4
(Smoothe Da Hustler)
Now that everything is of the chest
There is a couple of matters I must attend to before I rest
Don't take my family
Don't take my people
Don't take next level cause to me there's no equal
Don't take my click
Don't take the hoodies or the hats
Don't take the burners and th gats
Don't take the BMW's and the MPV's
Don't take the keys
Don't take the g's
Don't take the gooses
Don't take the grim's
Don't take the kaki jeans or the tims
Don't take the studio
Don't take the tracks
Don't take the spots
Don't take the cracks
Don't take the weed that I smoke
Don't take the name smoothe wrong or this jam for a joke
Don't take the players and the hustlers getting cash
Don't take the projects
Don't take the ave
Don't take the females that I talk to
Don't take the glock that I cock on the blocks that I walk through

[Verse 1] 

I'm stackin,rappin but if I just so happen was itI probably would be posted up thugin, sellin crack are somethin 
I had 2 leave it alone cause the rats are something 
Look kike my return won't be long 
The streets keep asking 4 me 
Young savage on the mound game ova now

Sbroil bitches don't want share 
So I'm taking dis shit 
I'm a 110 street cat and had my back against tha hope 
No money, no love,just tears,weed, blood, and hoes 
I'm like slim these niggas don't feel my pain 
A ninety-nine problems and but a bitch ain't one 
Ghetto stories, gangsta musik, thank big labels ain't come 
Shitd we just trying see which one 

[Chorus:] 

I'm so retarded 
And I'm gon all hard and 
My game mutheafuckin bitch brains up

Smoothe the Hustler,"[Chorus: Snow]
It was a lonely, long, and grimey night
I go to see my girl, my Madonna
I've been so lonely, I've been thinkin' 'bout you

[Latoya and Miranda]
It never fails, no matter what I do
I find myself locked up in thoughts of you
Over your kiss, I reminisce by sweet sunlight
And it's your titanic touch, that takes my mind at night
Cause when I'm with you love is so real it's like sweet pain
Just the thought of you takes away the rain
There's nothing I'd rather do than keep you on my mind
Days are short enough, so I don't waste my time
Locked up in you, your love is true, what am I to do?
want to make this real, 'bout how I feel, boy what's the deal?
Your love is so real, you got me, you got me

[Chorus]

[Snow]
Hey, way-yo-yeah
Think about you all the time you go away
Hey, know what you say
Spend a little time with me
Get freaky, be your fantasy
Let's ride, let's ride, let's ride

[Smoothe]
Whoever want to tangle better be ready to hang
I don't tie knots, why not? that ain't my thing (foo')
Catch me blazin' up in my whip, catchin' attitudes
When my flight's delayed, I flip, then I'm raisin' up
Pop the cork and, rearrange and stop your walkin'
The solo type with tigher game than dolomite
I got ya hopin' I stay around, I don't play around
When I rise, I lay it down, bless it and leave
I don't hang around, I'm too rude to be forgotten
You're feelin me right, boo?
That's what you get for stopin'

[Chorus]

[Latoya and Miranda]
In the middle of the night or broad daylight
Won't put up a fight
I'll just relax and let my thoughts take flight
While your honey rides control my world, 
boy, my mind 24-7
What can I do?
You know you've got that butter love
I'm thinkin' of, baby you stay on my mind
I'm so 'bout you
Oh, I'm captivated, I can't maintain it
I just don't know what to do

[Chorus]",Thinkin' About You,1999
Smooths,"The rumble of the engines in the station almost put me to sleep
And the wino covered up with yesterday's news is lying next to me
I see a red-haired girl with ponytails reminding me of you
I don't know why I left it was somethin' I had to do

Looking out the window the skyline fades away
When I see your face I have no idea what I'm gonna say
I've got a picture of me holding you right here in my hands
I recognize my face but I don't know who I am

Now I'm gonna catch a Greyhound
Getting out of this town
I'm gonna catch a Greyhound back to you
I close my eyes, but I can't seem to sleep

And the past rolls through my mind like a river cold and deep
Morning comes and the sky begins to rain
It feels good to feel something even if it's pain
Now I'm gonna catch a Greyhound

Getting out of this town
I'm gonna catch a Greyhound back to you
It's amazing how a tender voice on the other end of the phone
 can change your mind, your life, your plans just by saying

""Daddy, please come home""
Gonna catch a Greyhound
Getting out of this town
I'm gonna catch a Greyhound back to you

Yes, I'm gonna catch a Greyhound
Getting out of this town
I'm gonna catch a Greyhound back to us
I'm starting my life over on a Greyhound bus",Enemy,1997
SMP,"E-V-I-L E and Ice-T are on a jack move
Layin down the dope groove, smokin those who disapprove
Wreckin the deck, you'll regret if you cross punk
Rollin like a Mack truck, waxin those who talk junk
Violent your end, I got your face in my crosshairs
Wanna see your dome bust sucker cause I don't care
Nuttin bout you, your crew, because you talk shit
I'm the Lethal Weapon boy, ridin the apocalypse
If you're in my way, then lay beneath the ground soon
Violence is my business fool, the microphone of doom
Mission that's to cure all punks as I bust caps
Peelin your back, my ammunition hollow-point raps
You try to run, that makes it even more fun
I just cold lamp and vamp you with the shotgun
Cops try to flex.. but guns they'll never find..

You hit the deck, as rap busts from my lips
You think I'm finished - I load another clip
Look in my face, I crack an evil grin
Lyrics bring death from the microphone Mac-10
Sucker MC's, you ain't down with the Syndicate
Try to kick game, but end up talkin weak shit, yo
You're weak, you're wack, you need to quit you lil punk bitch
Go and freak your mother, go dig a damn ditch
Get out my face, I'm tired of the press too
You write about me, I write about you
You think I'm violent, but listen and you will find..

Up against the wall - it's Valentine's Day
The Massacre's about due for a replay
I'm about to explode - like a hand grenade
Evil E do damage on the crossfade
Cuts like a battleaxe
You try to bite, get iced, my raps are boobytraps
Claim of mine, designed by the Ice himself
You beg for mercy as you read the hand you're dealt
Ah ahh ahh AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!""
Cause there's no let up, you walked into a set up
It's suckin you down and now you can't get up
Why because you froze the moment we met up
And I never run punk, I go head up
I ain't no fool and new jack poppin fake rap
I rap from the heart and soul, where only facts are kept
Many rappers sell-out pop and other MC's slept
I ain't in no playin mood, so nigga watch your step
Cause if you cross the boss, you go to bed quick
Know my situation boy, don't diss the Syndicate
cause when we chose to move, you're gone
and no remains they'll find..

More bodies than John Gotti, the Lethal Weapon is slaying
Just open any book, that's ammo to the brain
What really matters, is how well is your weapon trained
Some would say genius, while others would say insane
The Weapon power has been witnessed upon my page
From Martin Luther's ""dream"", to Hitler's psycho rage
What's more powerful - the brain or a twelve gauge?
The words I speak have scared many people to this stage
But promote violence, I really have to disagree
It's entertainment, like ""Terminator"" on TV
But some'll never see, you're stupid ignorant and blind
The Lethal Weapon's the mind!

This is my time
I'd like to see the table turned
Trade your placemat with mine
See if you can still make a ball
Or maybe eat the apple whole

Was as close as I had come
I'm in over my knees
And still the only one
Who has to get a grip on himself
I could use some outside help

It's already stale
It's just getting older and my side
Was sinking so quick
That the best I could do was jump ship

Waiting with bad bated breath
For the wind to change
It's just a well worn-out suggestion
To occupy the day
I wished that I knew when I threw it away
That I could deal with feeling this strange

But it sounds so similar
To something that I've done before
So I give myself a slap on the wrist
And you jam my hand in the door

Yeah how you livin?
  Yeah you know just smokin every day, whassup?
Yeah let me tell you hip-hop's WACK man
  Yeah I know, say word
All these MC's got diseases
  Yeah they got like frostbite, there's a bad plague baby
  MC's got delusions of grandeur and such {*brrrr, brrrrr!*}
Yeah man, yo we gotta tell 'em whassup

[Eon]
Now go make a record, and go rob a bank
Now you got Cool see-itis to thank
Copped that advance, but lost that check
Must be due to Alzheimer's onset
Go up in the label, when honies start feelin ya
Hobbes you better catch some A&R felia(?)
And female rappers don't have a chance
Need flow augmentation and mic implants
Yo, you went to bed with that hoochie redhead?
Caught half-steppin cause she got a peg leg
Shot your milk, she didn't swallow it?
That's cause girl was lactose intolerant
Smoke with E, you gonna have fun
Oh, but by the way, leave with collapsed lungs
Try and spit, but nothin comes out
Braindead MC's all got cotton mouth

This be a list of hip-hop's diseases
Too much ice gon' have shorty sneezin
Too much 'dro will leave a kid wheezin
Head's too big, stab you up for no reason

You with wifey dog, get a car from Sonya
It's likely you'll catch Nokia phobia
You shiverin from ice, hold a mic device
It's most certainly some rappers frostbite
Go up in the club, in moderation
Cause online you be catchin Peter Geisha'n impatient
Ha ha, rollin trees, only got seeds
Man's puffin crystals, green with envy
Rhymin for the loot, to get some mass
You a prime candidate for a heart bypass (clear! clear!)
You online, think you the dopest
Geek caught a case of wack internet-a-tosis
Startin rumors, check the tabloids
Caught a Blaze haze, maybe Source hemerrhoids (ouch)
Wack on stage, with off-beat ailment
At a show catch a microphone impalement

[Chorus]

Scrub your hands fifty times, and wash the smut odor
Obvious obsessive compulsive disorder
Up I got downers, down I got uppers
Now chuggin Pedia Sure for fuckin suppper (glug glug glug)
Step to E, no microphone contest
Soon learn about inferiority complex
I'm stuck on hip-hop, can't get a fix
'til Mighty Mi deals me a dope remix
Now I'll supply prescriptions
Come to the motherfuckin spot, if you havin wack visions
Writers block?  Just can't flow?
Hit you off with a double mic hydro
You goin gold if you got the patience
Son check in you got rap hallucinations
The surgeon, wack MC's I carve up

This mic a shiv; hip-hop is Nancy after I stab her
On stage, you want to go on after?
Show you the Art of War and then finish the crowd with the 1st chapter
Come and walk through this little doorway
Enter the mind of Cage and a horse will shit you out on Broadway
The flies won't eat it then feed it to the (?)
Peddle Smut like anabolic beer meth hydrolix
Alex frolics; hangin upside down
Ordained til my rhyme ninja bleeds through my face of war paint
So if you see me with a little pop jingle
Shoot me in the back of the head and feed me to my starvin breddern

Put you in the mental, locked down with three channels

Cut your back out, sell it to Avirex

Looking for ""Sex in the City"" and I shit on these four old whores
Kick mud off my boots to shake the story loose
Actin bigheaded when I smoke with Beetlejuice

Kids want to fuck with the Peddlers, I can't wait
I strafe Diallo's widow, datin the jake
You spit some shit, I'll return the sentiment
and spit in your face, cause you're not in your element
Born to slay them fake mega monsters
who couldn't even rhyme if they had teleprompters

Eon's called fierce, 'cause he's all weird
Leave the fuckin' record all cut up like Paul Pierce

My pain pour, quicker than Paul
Painful bullet holes that contain splinters from the front door
You seen how I did ya dawgs
Sent 'em home, souls collected, impaled on telephone poles

They all be catchin' eights when I be slashin' fakes
Makin' fun of me? I'm still pullin' out on classmates
With laser-guided missiles that don't miss
Oh bitch, you don't want to test when I hold this

[Chorus: x2] 

When the Earth is cast, it's fuckin' gun ashes
With different aspects of microphone spastics
Froze elastic, ass kissed the tragics
Swimmin' through ya petty bullshittin' life jackets

For the most glamorous eat this shit raw
E.C. put Cage down like a sick dog
Now kids fiend for my solo LP
Like crack addicted Co-Flow fans, you just flee

Slayin' drones, beat 'em up with sticks and stones
Stick with man-to-man, don't fuck around with zones
If I'm home or on neutral turf, when I blurt
You will hurt, this mics spurts when I smell dirt

I got a bullet with a name on it, dick got a blade on it
Lung got a stain on it, bottom-feeder get AIDS on it
I drop shit for the crowds to figure out
You touch the mic the crowd'll breath and pour they liquor out

They used to go to shows, drink dance get high
Then you click the mic the whole audience wanna rhyme

In '92 I let the Cage outta Alex
Through college radio demonstrate the fist, fuck the love ballads
Summon demons in my ad libs, fun triplin'
Vomit good shit, go feed off dead Christians

If I escape, I might evaporate my whole state

And the two O-Z's, down to fifty-four grams
With two to the face, I'm a basket face
With fifty-four seconds to outer space

With green Jesus, get in I'll drive you to seizures
Humanoid pause, before God, with cyborg dogs after me
Killin' these rhymin' Sigmund Freuds for the cause

Your whole life's a waitin' room for worms
Strangest occurs, you see Venus in furs
With toast out facin' Earth, avenge my sixteen
Your old shell talk to pistols like Starscream

My whole story lost on a wall in black marker
66 more flicks for Clive Barker
With a little message, for real research kids
Can you guess who the faggot DJ is?

My anti-commercial style will curse you
Say fuck so much, my airplay's like curfew
To third shift farm chemists, the senate scarred
Start killin' all the livin' like the Serbian guards

You supportin' communism buyin' majors so dub
Watch me put two rocks in Kurt Loder head, whassup

Then blow shotties in they face to finish the sentence

Yeah I stuck around like your Plymouth's car rust
Fuck your startin' five, the startin' three are us

Celebrate like my pops when his bastard was born
Stretch the pussy like some starlet tryin' to last in porn

Slice the underbelly of my hunger jelly, splash the scene
Crashed the Beam in half then laughed, I ain't shook shaft
Put another hole in your head to stash my fist
And slash your wrists, with a ""Porn Again"" CD
Cracked the jar then the cigar then it goes to E

I'm in a trance with the evilest glance

I first saw the bitch at the galleria
With Mr. E

[Eon]
Yo, check that spanish bitch

[Cage]
Yeah, I see her
She was signing people up for credit cards at Sears
Would've stepped to her but...

[Eon]
Mr. E beat you there
Detective Dick lonely. So I'm paging up Josie
36 see's, great knees, pussy toasty
Face like Parker Posey. Seen Stark and Rosie
In the winter looking tan. Never ever ghostly

[Cage]
Fuck that bitch; I grab myself a slut and broke
I had my brain on Josie the whole time we stroked
Days go by and E is like, she wants to chill

[Eon]
Yo you got that leak?

[Cage]
No doubt. Let's lace the Phil's

[Eon]
For rumors narc Thomsons and rhymes I need detox
Shermed up driving in circles for three blocks
Enbalming fluid in the Big Red I was chewing
Worse than the dip whip that had my ass tripping
Who pick you up at eight
So have your gear and shit straight

[Cage]
Yo I be puffing in the basement
Hit the whore when it's time to skate
Leathal leakin got my mother crib stinking
No time for air freshener they beeping in the Lincoln
I jumped in the back with Juice
Solutions fusing the dip nicotine and the truddy Susan
Picked her and her friend up from work
Cat suit. Tight Skirt
Licking they lips shaking they tits trying to flirt

Hook:
Josie! Not what your everyday hoes be
Josie! Perfect poultry for adultry
Josie! Keep the baby wipes closely
Josie! Still taking facials mostly

[Eon]
We twist leak before the bitch speak
Watch my dick creep. Already hitting Josie
But her friend looked like a freak
Doing sixty five in a school zone
Baggy two tones. Swerving off road
Let's get some more blue note
Yo I want to sample that shit
(I want to sample that clit)
Eric and Alex might just pull a switch

[Cage]
I reached from the back and grabbed Josie's tits
Where I can find her friend's lips
To the Mighty Mi mix. She freestyles with a mouthful
Pornographic Serena Altschul. Still leaked up

[Eon]
Yo break up this ounce

[Cage]
True. Knee deep in a box in the back seat poppin her
Start shooting like trench coat mafia

[Eon]
Yo Cage I can't see with that bitch on top of ya
In the rear view that pussy looking much sloppier
Take the party upstate. On the palisades
Stopping on a dirt road. Josie mixing Alize

[Cage]
Ounce a day habit. She want to fuck like a rabbit

[Eon]
Strapped with a hat. Smoked the leaks to the last hit

[Cage]
Is you in love with that bitch?

[Eon]
No kid.   (So switch)

[Cage]
I hit her on the trunk
Then took shotguns from her cunt
For one straight month, we fucking on the reg
She's just a mouth, box and a ass

[Eon]
You fucking with her head

Repeat hook.

[Cage]
Should've known she was like a sister
Stripping and licking

[Eon]
As far as Mr. E's dick, that's all she was getting

[Cage]
A fairly hated me because I got a stinking house
Said they know what I'm about

[Eon]
The pussy no doubt!

[Cage]
To the little bomb bitch munk for half my closet

[Eon]
Damn. All she got from me was a mouth deposit
Word up. Wait. What's this receipt from the Sheraton?

[Cage]
It's be your last night tricking Josie and Erin
How'd you know?

[Eon] 
She treated

[Cage]
She left half skeeted. With a check to cash

[Eon]
For how much?

Hid my misgivings from my brain was still mssing

So fuckin filthy an Avirex butters look bummy
Think out loud, cause I'm allowed, to stage dive in a crowd
of cannibals about to spit across my eyebrow

Now God blessed me with abnormal tendencies
and granted clemency for illegal chemistry
Ain't worth your weight in molecular structure
Out of work like JFK Jr.'s flight instructor

Slept with a perforated picture of Jimi Hendrix
See in these days, Cage is like, 54 ways
to get my fuckin money, mega seedless to blaze

I ran up in a wack open mic cafe on stage
So many biters I performed in a shark cage
in dark shades, during the Central Park raids
I walked out with a book of paper and a bag of beige

Get more upskirts than (?) for your face

I'm fresh out the box like newborns
The chicken played with my monkey now we makin zoo porn
Now MC's the Anti-Christ like, Damien thorn
Eric the Pascal(?) land so feel the scorn

With logic equal to fifteen Vulcans

And I'm soakin, face lookin blank
Shoot this little kid up with horse tranq' and send him to the bank
with a 'give me the funds' note, clip's missin from the gun
If he gets slapped then fuck it all I'll split it with my dunns
(Bum bum!) I shit on crumbs, got a couple thousand sons
that all shoulda been wiped off some jugs or cloggin lungs

Everytime I dabble watch my life unravel
Did I miss an exit to the road less traveled?
Transmit from the depths of the deepest bassment
Through the pavement, up into spaceships
Deathstar creator, I orbit track wars
My appeal spans Rhodes scholars to slackjaws

Yo, a Peddler show, include a few heathens
From Hoth to Tatooine, you choose the season
Dialect for all these crews and legions
A walking contradiction like ""Jews for Jesus""

Galvanize my face and kill for breathin space
Nobody to trace, open the trunk like the case
Light the L off of your body and sweepd you in the face

Yeah I seen old timers became semi-thugs
I got more dizzy spells than Reginald Denny does
Cranium blower, Shea Stadium goer

One day I launched a rocket up into the moon
And landed on a crater in a blue lagoon
Three girls in the nude, in the pool they had room
Screamin, ""Starbuck we want to have a orgy with you!""
But never in my life had I seen green bitches
And when I want they would grant me three wishes
One was a pound of the blue moon hydro
Twistin it up, watch my divine mind blow
Two was a pair, of gravity boots
With a space helmet, and a Nike moon suit
They took me from the pool up to the bedroom
Where wish number three, my dick they consumed
They hittin me off orally so lovely
Now those dainty ladies they took it easily
Time flew by, no weed, time to leave
It's time to get back to Earth at breakneck speed
I told the moon bitches that I'd see 'em again
And thank you very much for the weed and the head
They were three moon girls, I fucked every one
That story is over - ""but my rhyme ain't done!""

This is how I get where the fuck I get
I went to Harlem so I could get some wet
I bought the dutch out of the bodega
Left a cloud of black smoke in the air
Took a '99 Beetle - on a magical mystery tour
Your, narrator's pedal hits the floor
Saw a hardcore, punk rave bitch yellin, ""Fuck the law!""
Guzzlin alcohol, leather jacket and a bra
Boots militant, her nose caked up with (?)
Kicked her in the face, yellin Kent
Dipped cigarette, Masai Bai is on cassette
I'm chewin on her nipples like nicorette

Captain Crunch was a slanger of narcotic cereals
And Toucan Sam was his right hand ""MAN""

Killed Count Chocula with the snap of his finger

To add to that, he was flippin Fruity Pebbles
Told the hoe to hit the skids, cause Trix was for kids
Snap Crackle Pop sellin Krispies on your block
Lucky the Leprechaun is suckin up top

Cause he was always known to pack that Cinnamon Toast

Jealousy, cause we be what others be
Now blessed be he who pack abstract apparatus
Rhyme with more attitude than B.A. Baracus
Flyin at night, writin the white lines
Your shit ain't workin like Slick Rick's right eye

(Chorus)
[Masai Bey]
Ayo, this ain't a rhyme, kid
It's a plug, for a ?cushite? product
That cleans more than Woolite
Other leadin brands emit packages randomly to people
Study their reactions then scam 'em
For example ya, cheese crumb records
Six different flavors and guess what, they all cheddar
I can't believe the time and money that consumers waste
On a variety of the same exact taste
You phony rappers makin music for the rich to dance to
Hope you can get into that circle
But if you want some light, go see Spieldberg
He could use some house, high class herb nigga
To freestlye about chaufferin him around
And can't wait to write about the Benz on his break
But this product's name is Masai Bey
And the ad was paid for by the most High

Smut Peddlers,"""My world, is blue""

The fuckin' Trump..
Yeah cut it up, cut it up
This ain't no, this ain't no bright lights and big city
It's dark alleys, red lights and no pity

I got it, locked, stocked, and two smokin' bongs
Got trees soaked and drawn, the mute grow dissolve drawn
Independent like Ralph Nader
When I hate y'all like Dallas Cowboy tailgators

I used to cut up my arms
Now 12 arms cut up my vinyl pawns
Fuck fawn, I get embalmed on the john
Then step onstage for encore
Stab the promoter with the pen from his Palm 4

East demenic, head dented, so devious
The most mischievous, check out the sleaziest
Deep in the dead of night, Peddlers getcha head right
This here be a soundtrack for the Red Light

Lick the side of my mouth out, see the words, gouged out
Letterin', hangin' from the jaws, down stout
A verse in blood, that only hybrids see
And the non-creatives test my words fro HIV

This here ain't no bright lights and big city
It's dark allies, red lights with no pity
For all-a y'all raw dawgs that get gritty
Stack ones, carry guns, and live shitty

This here ain't no bright lights and big city
It's dark allies, red lights with no pity
For all-a y'all raw dawgs that get gritty
Stack ones, carry guns, and live shitty

You get the tip while I piss on the barcheck
Give a bitch some head that I pulled out of a carwreck
Am I angelic or just slightly off track
My bones shift when my ripped off wings flap

Now it's a damn shame
Don't even fuck with that bull that got Time Corp
Coursin through his veins
Eon's called fierce, 'cause he's all weird
Leave the fuckin' record all cut up like Paul Pierce

My pain pour, quicker than Paul
Painful bulletholes that contain splinters from the front door
You seen how I did ya dawgs
Sent 'em home, souls collected, impaled on telephone poles

They all be catchin eights when I be slashin fakes
Makin fun of me? I'm still pullin out on classmates
With laser-guided missles that don't miss
Oh bitch, you don't want to test when I hold this

This here ain't no bright lights and big city
It's dark allies, red lights with no pity
For all-a y'all raw dawgs that get gritty
Stack ones, carry guns, and live shitty

This here ain't no bright lights and big city
It's dark allies, red lights with no pity
For all-a y'all raw dawgs that get gritty
Stack ones, carry guns, and live shitty

When the Earth is cast, it's fuckin' gun ashes
With different aspects of microphone spastics
Froze elastic, ass kissed the tragics
Swimmin' through ya petty bullshittin' life jackets

For the most glamorous eat this shit raw
E.C. put Cage down like a sick dog
Now kids fiend for my solo LP
Like crack addicted Co-Flow fans, you just flee

Slayin' drones, beat 'em up with sticks and stones
Stick with man-to-man, don't fuck around with zones
If I'm home or on neutral turf, when I blurt
You will hurt, this mics spurts when I smell dirt

I got a bullet with a name on it, dick got a blade on it
Lung got a stain on it, bottom-feeder get AIDS on it
I drop shit for the crowds to figure out
You touch the mic the crowd'll breath and pour they liquor out

This here ain't no bright lights and big city
It's dark allies, red lights with no pity
For all-a y'all raw dawgs that get gritty
Stack ones, carry guns, and live shitty

This here ain't no bright lights and big city
It's dark allies, red lights with no pity
For all-a y'all raw dawgs that get gritty

E-e-e-e-ey
Der Grund dafür dass deutsche Crews jetzt enttäuscht sind,
Weil sie in die Staaten wollten, wie der Flug 93
Meine Kugeln sind teuflich, weil auf dein Cap New Era steht,
Fühle mich sexuell erregt, wenn ich ein Gangsterrapper seh
Asphalt Massaka 2, der große Hype,
Man trifft euch im Fundbüro, weil ihr verloren seid
Mutterficker, ihr habt Paras, weil ihr euch Hero gabt,
Und Filme fahrt/Fard wie der Kameramann von Terrorbars
Von Tag zu Tag sinkt das Niveau von einem Bettler tiefer, doch das ist mir egal, denn ich hab im Bett Latifah
Deutscher Rap ist ein Schlachtfeld; Farid hat Hunger, und isst/ist Snacks (Snaga)
Wie der Rapper aus Gladbeck

Du machst Rap für Kiffer, meine Hörer sind Hoes,
In körperbetonten Burberry-Hosen
Es ist Kollegah der Macdaddy,
Rapper mit dem Black Cadillac
An der Westside von Germany posend
Ich verkaufe das Koka, deal am Block, während dein Team paar Trottel sind, traurige Poser,
Die zu Hause auf dem Sofa mit Shisha hocken, und Fifa (Vieh ver-) zocken, wie Bauern beim Pokern
Du Häufchen Elend, mit Säuglingen ähnelnden,
Mickrigen Armen, chillst mit Kräutertee und Räucherstäbchen
In deinem Billigapartment, nichts schlimmes ahnend, und Däumchen drehend,
Wirst unverhofft, umgeboxt, stehst dann nicht mehr auf den Beinen, sondern unter Schock,
Kid, ich komme und führe deine Freundin in die hohe Kunst der Blowjobs ein und gebe der Nutte Cock,
Und du Bitch sagst: ""Fuck auf Bullen!"", aber solange wir in deiner Stadt chillen, hast du eins eins schon gewählt, und den Finger an der null,
Ey, das ist Hustlerrap, ich mach mein Cash, verticke in deiner City jede Nacht das Crack, koche es, und dann wird es in den Straßen abgesetzt, wie Taxigäste

Ich steige mit Kumpels aus dem A6,
Nehme dir Hundesohn dein Gras weg,
Ein osmanischer Tokat, was jetzt?
Bungalows und Barchecks,
Sitz mit Onkels im Cafe, und schaue zu wie mein Vater Fünfhunderter auf Schwarz setzt
Du hängst mit Abschaum,
Rauchst deinen Joint, und hast Pappmaul
Ich komm nachts raus, mit 8 Frauen,
Die genüsslich an meinem Sack kauen,
Ich ficke deine Lache denn ich tickte Weiß und machte
Para, als Savas noch einen Mittelscheitel hatte,
Damals, als man mich täglich noch am Block finden konnte,
Ich mein die Zeit als Curse sich noch nen Zopf binden konnte
Sag wie willst du Junkie dich in mein Geschäft einbau'n?
Hol die Papers, halt die Schnauze, du kannst mir ein' bau'n

Als ich geboren wurd' sagte Gott zu sich, man der wird mal ein böser Mensch sein,
Heute fick ich Weiber, und creme mir den Schwanz mit Löwensenf ein, rolle ihn aus mit Kabeltrommel
Flagge aufs Gesicht, ich fick das Vaterland und salutier wenn ich auf die Fahne komme
Ragazzi ah!
Schreit besser, weil es reicht nur ein Treffer
Denn ich schmeiß Messer auf euch schweinehässlichen scheiß Rapper,
Reihenweise schneid ich euch Scheiße in Scheiben, so wie ein Häcksler,
Nein besser, mein Sippii gleitet vorbei, wie Clyde Drechsler
Als kleines Kind war ich mal ein süßer Kacker,
Doch mit 13 Jahren hat' ich 'nen Schnurrbart, sowie Müslüm Baba,
Denk ruhig du wärst hart, doch dein Leben steht auf der Kippe,
In kalten Zeiten bleib ich hart, so wie ein Nippel auf 'ner Titte

Der Junge der nicht tanzt, gesunde Arroganz,
Das Alphatier spricht und alle Hunde haben Angst
Ich kenne keine Furcht, glaub mir, ich greife durch,
Ich will 'ne Frau die Whisky schwitzt und Hunderteuroscheine furzt
Komm vorbei, wir klären das Ganze alleine,
Frauen und Geld hab ich, aber Angst hab ich keine, Ghettoromantik
Ich steck den Schwanz in die Scheide,
Mein Tascheninhalt sorgt für tanzende Beine
Ich bin nicht Max Herre,
Doch Weiber lieben mich, weil ich mir vor dem Fickengehen meinen Sack kämme
Jungs aus der Unterschicht, ihr Bonzenkids habt keine Klasse,
Und feiert impotente Scheisse für die breite Masse,
Seitdem ich rappe, brauch ich keinen Plan B,
Ich schlag dir die Zähne aus, und ficke anschließend die Zahnfee",Terrorbars Infinity,2010

Steigen ein durch dein Fenster per Schlagring

180 Durch die Nacht, auf Amphetamin
Fliegen mit Infrarotsicht ins Rotlicht
Die Kohle ist nicht koscher, aber lohnt sich
Das Auto deutsch, das Motorrad japanisch
Der Vodka russisch, die Platten marokkanisch

Sie haben meine Hände gefesselt und die Augen verbunden
Sie glauben, dadurch wäre mein Glaube verschwunden
Doch als sie mir nahmen, wofür es sich zu Leben lohnt
Weckten sie den Hass, der jetzt in meiner Gegend wohnt
Seitdem ich denken kann herrschte draußen Krieg
Mein kleiner Sohn hat draußen vor dem Haus gespielt
Mit fünf, nicht mal seine Kindheit erlebt
Sein verbrannter Körper wurde vom Winde verweht
Wer ist dieser Mann im Weißen Haus?
Hat er etwa keine Kinder, hat er keine Frau?
Was sollte ich tun, sollte ich tatenlos dasitzen?
Und salutieren für eure Lügen in den Nachrichten?
Sie wollen dass ich rede und Namen nenn'
Doch sie kriegen keine Antwort, weil sie die falschen Fragen stellen
Unsereins zu unterschätzen war ein großer Fehler
Denn auf tote Kinder folgen tote Väter
All der Hass, die Wut und diese Kopfschmerzen
Bis sie meinen leblosen Körper in ein Loch werfen
Ein letzter Blick durch das Fenster auf den Innenhof
Denn von hier drin scheint für uns selbst der Himmel tot

Eine Kamera und ein Licht
Ein Richter, ein Henker und ein Opferlamm, das bin Ich

Entführt, und bald tot um als Zeichen zu gelten
Denn sie wollen Gleiches mit Gleichem vergelten
Auge um Auge und Zahn um Zahn
Friedhöfe anstatt Frieden sind des Teufels Plan
Vergiftete Herzen seit über 1000 Jahren
Im Krieg zwischen Juden und Christen und dem Islam
Ich hatt' ein Traum von der Heimat
War bei meiner Frau und meinem Sohn und es war Weihnacht
Wir konnten uns küssen und lachen
Ich halt' die Bilder in Gedanken fest, während die Erinnerungen verblassen
Gebrochene Knochen, gebrochener Wille
Sehnsucht nach Erlösung, Hoffnung auf Stille
Ein letztes Gebet noch, Vater in der Not
Die Klinge an meiner Kehle, so umarme ich den Tod

Meine Liebe, meine Tränen, mein Glaube

Forderten wir USA und ihre Streitkräfte heraus
Gegen gepanzerte Fahrzeuge und Vögel aus Stahl
David gegen Goliath, mir war die Größe egal
Im Namen der Tyrannei diente ich Idi Amin
In der Hand von Abu Ammar schrie ich „Free Palestine!“
Eroberte mit somalischen Piraten Diebesgut
Und unterstützte Fidel Castro bei seinem Siegeszug
Was ist los? Hast du Angst? Komm und nehm' mich an die Hand
Denn die Macht, die ich verleihen kann, macht dich zu einem Mann
Aufgeben? Niemals! Zurückziehen? Niemals!

Obacht denn der Teufel trägt eine Pistole
Ich hoff' mein Schutzengel trägt eine Bazooka
Ich trage Handschuhe und 'ne Maske
Hungrig, ich faste, egal basta
sieh' der Plan ist gefasst
Ich hol' mir mein Stück vom Glück, kein Zurück mehr
Die Waffe ist gezückt, wer ahnt was ich mach'
Noch ein Schnupf von dem Staub der mich wahnsinnig macht
Und los geht's, ich hol den Bolzenschneider raus
Ahnungslos schläft der Bonze in seinem Haus
Knack' Zaun auf, 5 Minuten bis zum Überfall
Lautlos steigt der Fuchs in den Hühnerstall
Wie ein Schatten durchquer' ich den Garten
Zwing mich vor der Terrasse noch ein wenig zu warten
Weil ich kein' Bock auf Palaver habe
Nehm' ich die Zange und durchtrenn' erstmal den Draht der Alarmanlage
Der Mund ist trocken die Sicht ist benebelt
Adrenalin pumpt den Puls bis in den Schädel
Nerven angespannt wie ein Segel
Ein Türspalt, ein Stein und ein Brecheisen
schon hab ich ein' Hebel
Unter die Tür damit
Hoch gedrückt und dann zur Seite
Hand durch, zieh' den Griff zurück und ich schleiche
Durch die Küche ins Wohnzimmer rein
Wow, so groß kann ein Wohnzimmer sein

Latte, bleib' bei der Sache, Snags denk an die Patte
Die Treppe hoch leise und flink wie eine Ratte
Den Flur runter, zweite Tür links
Plem raus durchladen und rein ich rieche die Kohle schon
Zahltag du Hurensohn, raus aus den Federn jetzt
Wird abgerechnet du machst besser keine Fehler jetzt
Nur ein Mucks und ich baller' dir dein Schädel weg
Ich weiß, hinter dem Bild da an der Wand hast du den Safe versteckt
Doch er lernt's nicht und wehrt sich
Also 2 Schläge in die Zähne aber mehr nicht ich beherrsch' mich
Denn Erfolg braucht einen kühlen Kopf
Und sieh aus Löwen werden Mäuse, wenn Blut auf den Boden tropft
Und so spurt er, schleicht los und geht zum Bild
Nimmt es ab und ist froh, dass er noch lebt
Er gibt den Code ein und öffnet das Türchen
Na also, geht doch läuft doch wie am Schnürchen
Ich werf' ein' Blick auf den Schatz und guck mich satt
Gold, Schmuck und Bargeld, circa 150 Blatt
Und ab jetzt geht der Fuchs wieder leise vor
Also fessel' ich den Hurensohn an das Heizungsrohr

of you and your sisters
on the first day of school(on the first day of school)
I'll always play with you
Nobody loves you
more than they ought to
nobody cares what you think (what you think)
I still hold those pictures
of you and yours sisters
I'll always play the fool
I'll always play with you
So an Angel has your name
what a perfect name it is
And though it's not the same
The heartache isn't all that lives
Mother adores you
Mother rewards you
Kissing you on the cheek
Those old faded pictures
of you and your sisters
on the first day of school
I'll always play with you
So an angel has your name
What a perfect name it is
And though it's not the same
The heartache isn't all that lives",Act Your Age,2000
