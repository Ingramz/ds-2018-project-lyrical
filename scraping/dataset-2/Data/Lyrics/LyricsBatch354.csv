Helen Forrest,"Any old time you want me
I am yours for the asking darling
Any old time you need me
Ill be their with love that's lasting darling.
All through the years well stand together
Sharing the tears and stormy weather
And the sunshine will be yours and mine
Any old time your blue
You'll have our love to chase away the blues
And any old thing you do ill see you through.
So just remember that I am waiting dear
If ever you want me ill be near,
Any old time and any place you may be.
",Any Old Time,2002
Helen Forrest,"You were meant for me, I was meant for you
Nature patterned you and when she was done
You were all the sweet things rolled up in one
You're like a plaintive melody
That never lets me free
For I'm content the angels must have sent you
And they meant you just for me
 
You were meant for me, I was meant for you
Nature patterned you and when she was done
You were all the sweet things rolled up in one
You're like a plaintive melody
That never lets me free
For I'm content the angels must have sent you
And they meant you just for me
",You Were Meant for Me,2003
Helen Forrest,"Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me

Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last

Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me

Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me

Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last

Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me

Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago
Was you",Long Ago and Far Away,2005
Helen Forrest,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 

Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood,

Helen Forrest,"All our friends keep knocking at the door
They've asked me out a hundred times or more
But all I say is, ""Leave me in the gloom""
And here I stay within my lonely room
'Cause

I don't want to walk without you, Baby
Walk without my arm about you, Baby
I thought the day you left me behind
I'd take a stroll and get you right off my mind
But now I find that
I don't want to walk without the sunshine
Why'd you have to turn off all that sunshine?
Oh, Baby, please come back or you'll break my heart for me
'Cause I don't want to walk without you
No, sire",I Don't Want to Walk Without You [From Sweater Girl],2006
Helen Forrest,"Here I go again, I hear those trumpets blow again.
All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again.
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.",Takin' a Chance on Love,2009
Helen Forrest,"We were waltzing together to a dreamy melody
When they called out ""change partners""
And you waltzed away from me
Now my arms feel so empty as I gaze around the floor
And I'll keep on changing partners
Till I hold you once more

Though we danced for one moment and too soon we had to part
In that wonderful moment something happened to my heart
So I'll keep changing partners till you're in my arms and then
Oh, my darling I will never change partners again

Though we danced for one moment and too soon we had to part
In that wonderful moment something happened to my heart
So I'll keep changing partners till you're in my arms and then

Helen Forrest & The Serenaders,"Once in a while will you try to give
One little thought to me
Though someone else may be
Nearer your heart?

Once in a while will you dream
Of the moments I shared with you
Moments before we two
Drifted apart?

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
That spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me
Once in a while

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
The spark may burn again

Helen Fox,"How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How far would I travel

Helen Frost,"Old Man Sunshine, listen, you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it, and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax, don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain, It's the final curtain

I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate, it's all bananas

They're writing songs of love, but not for me
A lucky star's above, but not for me
With love to lead the way
I found more skies of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall, and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss
The memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

Although I can't dismiss
The memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me",But Not For Me,2000
Helen Gallagher,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic
That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,
To let 'em rest unexpressed.
I hate parading my serenading
As I'll probably miss a bar,
But if this ditty is not so pretty,
At least it'll tell you how great you are.

You're the top! You're the Colosseum,
You're the top! You're the Louvre Museum,
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss,
You're a Bendel bonnet, a Shakespeart sonnet,
You're Mickey Mouse.
You're the Nile, You're the Tow'r of Pisa,
You're the smile on the Mona Lisa.
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop,
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

Your words poetic are not pathetic
On the other hand, boy, you shine
And I can feel after every line
A thrill divine down my spine.
Now gifted humans like Vincent Youmans
Might think that your song is bad,
But for a person who's just rehearsin'
Well I gotta say this my lad:

You're the top! You're Mahatma Ghandi.
You're the top! You're Napolean brandy.
You're the purple light of a summer night in Spain,
You're the National Gall'ry, You're Garbo's sal'ry,
You're cellophane.
You're sublime, You're a turkey dinner.
You're the time of the Derby winner.
I'm a toy balloon that is fated soon to pop.
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

You're the top! You're a Ritz hot toddy.
You're the top! You're a Brewster body.
You're the boats that glide on the sleepy Zuider Zee,
You're a Nathan Panning, You're Bishop Manning,
You're broccoli.
You're a prize, You're a night at Coney,
You're the eyes of Irene Bordoni,
I'm a broken doll, a fol-de-rol, a blop,
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top.

You're the top! You're an Arrow collar.
You're the top! You're a Coolidge dollar.
You're the nimble tread of the feet of Fred Astaire,
You're an O'Neill drama, You're Whistler's mama,
You're Camembert.
You're a rose, You're Inferno's Dante,
You're the nost of the great Durante.
I'm just in the way, as the French would say
""De trop,""
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top.

You're the top! You're a Waldorf salad.
You're the top! You're a Berlin ballad.
You're a baby grand of a lady and a gent.
You're an old dutch master, You're Mrs. Aster,
You're Pepsodent.
You're romance, You're the steppes of Russia,
You're the pants on a Roxy usher.
I'm a lazy lout that's just about to stop,
But if Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

You're the top! You're a dance in Bali.
You're the top! You're a hot tamale.
You're an angel, you simply too, too, too divine,
You're a Botticelli, You're Keats, You're Shelley,
You're Ovaltine.
You're a boon, You're the dam at Boulder,
You're the moon over Mae West's shoulder.
I'm a nominee of the G.O.P. or GOP,
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

You're the top! You're the Tower of Babel.
You're the top! You're the Whitney Stable.
By the River Rhine, You're a sturdy stein of beer,
You're a dress from Saks's, You're next year's taxes,'
You're stratosphere.
You're my thoist, You're a Drumstick Lipstick,
You're the foist in the Irish svipstick,
I'm a frightened frog that can find no log to hop,
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!",You're the Top,1953
Helen Gilbert,"Mom, I’m telling you, this relationship business
You ain’t tell me it was so hard
Sometimes I just wanna give up, really
Well you know baby
Sometimes in love you gotta take the hurt, you gotta take the pain
Sometimes in love you gotta take a break, and get away
But things gonna get better
If you stick together
Your love will survive

We’ve been through so many changes
Seems like lately all we do is fight
Took a vow that we would make it but I’ve been having some doubts
And you’ve been having some doubts, babe
I know that I love you and I
Know that I don’t like you all the time
Just two people tryna make it through
The hard times and the doubt
But we gon' figure this out baby

Sometimes in love you gotta take the hurt, gotta take the pain
Sometimes in love you gotta take a break, gotta get away
But things gon' get better
If we stick together
Our love will survive
Stand up just a time

I know that sometimes I get on your nerves
And you know that sometimes you say shit that hurt
If we’re wanna make it, gotta stop and take a break
If we don’t we’ll lose all
Let’s figure it out
All you gotta do is
Say it, do it, show it, prove it
When your heart is low
I need a good man to fill me up
All I need is a good man to give me love

Sometimes in love you gotta take the hurt, gotta take the pain (Sometimes in love)
Sometimes in love you gotta take a break, gotta get away
But things gon' get better
If we stick together
Our love will survive
Stand up just a time

Sometimes in love you gotta take the hurt, gotta take the pain (Sometimes in love)
Sometimes in love you gotta take a break, gotta get away (You gotta take a break)
Stand up just a time
Sometimes in love you gotta take the hurt, gotta take the pain (?)
If we’re wanna make it, gotta stop and take a break
If we don’t we’ll lose all
Let’s figure it out
Sometimes in love you gotta take the hurt, gotta take the pain (?)
Sometimes in love you gotta take a break, gotta get away
You always showed me
Sometimes in love
If we don’t we’ll lose all
Let’s figure it out
Sometimes in love you gotta take the hurt, gotta take the pain
Sometimes in love you gotta take a break, gotta get away

Helen Grayco,"This love of mine, goes on and on
Though life is empty, since you have gone
You're always on my mind, though out of sight
It's lonesome through the day and all the night

Me here at last on the ground,
you in mid-air.

one who can't move.

Now darkness falls
Where once was love

Don't say - goodbye
Don't say - I didn't try...

These tears we cry
Are falling rain
For all the lies 
You told us
The hurt, the blame

And we will weep
To be so alone
We are lost
We can never go home

So in the end
I will be what I will be
No loyal friend
Was ever there for me

Now we say - goodbye
We say - you didn't try...

These tears you cry
Have come too late
Take back the lies
The hurt, the blame

And you will weep
When you face the end alone
You are lost
You can never go home

You are lost
You can never go home

Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me

Helen Humes,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew

Helen Marcovivvi Carroll,"Oh life is so peculiar, you get so wet in the rain,
 You get so warm in the sunshine, it doesn't pay to complain,
 When I get up each morning, there's nothing to breathe but air,
 When I look in the mirror, there's nothing to comb but hair,
 When I sit down to breakfast, nothing to eat but food,
 Life is so peculiar but you can't stay home and brood.
 Yes, life is so peculiar, a fork belongs with the knife,
 Corn beef is lost without cabbage, a husband should have a wife,
 Life is so peculiar, but is everybody's pair.
 That's life (that's life)
 (Oh life is so peculiar, the beach has only got sand,)
 The oceans only got water, you never know where you stand.
 When I get out to dinner, there's nothing to wear but clothes,
 Whenever I get sleepy, there's nothing to do but doze,
 Whenever I get thirsty, there's nothing to do but drink,
 Life is no peculiar that it makes it to the top of the sink,
 (Life is so peculiar,) it's so peculiar,

They didn't pan out as I had intended; 
I should know how to take a joke.

I'll go my way by myself, this is the end of romance. 
I'll go my way by myself, love is only a dance. 
I'll try to apply myself and teach my heart to sing.

I'll face the unknown, I'll build a world of my own; 
No one knows better than I, myself, I'm by myself alone.
I'll go my way by myself, here's how the comedy ends.

I walk in a room, a party of all, come sit over here, somebody will call
A drink for monsieur, a drink for us all, but how many times, I sat and recall.

Are the apple trees, blossoms in the breeze that we walk among,
Lying in the hay, games we used to play, while the rounds were sung,
Only yesterday when the world was young.
Wherever I go they mention my name, and that in itself is some sort of fame,

Come by for a drink, we're having a game, wherever I go, I'm glad that I came.
The talk is quite gay, the company's fine,
There's laughter and lights and glamour and wine.
And beautiful girls and summer's been mine, but often my eyes see a different shine.

On our backs sweet lie, looking at the sky, till the stars were strung
Only last July when the world was young.","[Ah, The Apple Trees] When the World Was Young",1959

Helen Merrill,"There are places I'll remember all my life,
Though some have changed.
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain.
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall.
Some are dead and some are living,
In my life I've loved them all
But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you.

When I think of love as something new.

For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more.",In My Life,1970

So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair.
I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine.
We talked until two, and then she said, ""It's time for bed"".

They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day

And he taught her how to love the American way
To love with a soul 'twas easy to learn
Then he sailed away with a promise to return

She murmurs low

Then I'll never sigh or cry
I just must die

Do things I never should do
I drink much more that I ought to drink
Because I brings me back you

In your pocket, there's not not one penny

For my sins, till judgment I'll atone",Careless Love,1996
Helen Merrill,"I'm feeling mighty lonesome
Haven't slept a wink
I walk the floor and watch the door
And in between I drink
Black coffee
Love's a hand me down brew
I'll never know a Sunday
In this weekday room

I'm talking to the shadows
One o'clock to four
And Lord, how slow the moments go
When all I do is pour
Black coffee
Since the blues caught my eye
I'm hanging out on Monday
My Sunday dream's too dry

Now a man is born to go a lovin'
A woman's born to weep and fret
To stay at home and tend her oven
And drown her past regrets
In coffee and cigarettes

I'm moody all the morning
Mourning all the night
And in between it's nicotine
And not much hard to fight
Black coffee
Feelin' low as the ground
It's driving me crazy just waiting for my baby
To maybe come around

My nerves have gone to pieces
My hair is turning gray
All I do is drink black coffee
Since my man's gone away",Black Coffee,1996
Helen Merrill,"I make a date for gown, 
You can bet your life it rains. 
Tried to give a party 
But the guy upstairs complains. 
Guess I'll go through life 
Catching colds and missing trains.

I never miss a thing 
I've had the measles and the mumps. 
And every time I play an ace 
My partner always trumps. 
Guess I'm just a fool 
Who never looks before he jumps. 
Everything happens to me. 

At first I thought that you would end this jinx for me. 
And love would turn the trick to end despair. 
Now I just cant fool this head that thinks for me. 
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air.

I have tried so, not to give in
I've said to myself this affair it never would go so well
But why should I try to resist when I know so well
That I've got you under my skin

I would sacrifice anything come would might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice, that comes in the night and repeats in my ear

Of you for

The more I see you, 
The more I want you
Somehow this feeling 
Just grows and grows
With every sigh 
I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

And so she takes her summer time

Across the ocean wild and wide
To where your heart has ever been

The roses all have left your cheek.
I've watched them fade away and die
Your voice is sad when e'er you speak
And tears bedim your loving eyes.

[Chorus]
Oh! I will take you back, Kathleen
to where your heart will feel no pain
and when the fields are fresh and green
I'll take you to your home again!

I know you love me, Kathleen, dear
Your heart was ever fond and true.
I always feel when you are near
That life holds nothing dear, but you.
The smiles that once you gave to me
I scarcely ever see them now
Though many, many times I see
A dark'ning shadow on your brow.

[Chorus]

To that dear home beyond the sea
My Kathleen shall again return.
And when thy old friends welcome thee
Thy loving heart will cease to yearn.
Where laughs the little silver stream
Beside your mother's humble cot
And brightest rays of sunshine gleam
There all your grief will be forgot.

Helen Merrill,"Before Lord God made the sea and the land
He held all the stars in the palm of his hand
And they ran through his fingers like grains of sand
And one little star fell alone

Then the Lord God hunted through the wide night air 
For the little dark star on the wind down there 
And he stated and promised he'd take special care 
So it wouldn't get lost again

Now a man don't mind if the stars grow dim 
And the clouds blow over and darken him
So long as the Lord God's watching over them
Keeping track of how it all goes on

But I've been walking all the night and the day
Till my eyes get weary and my head turns gray
And sometimes it seems maybe God's gone away
And we're lost out here in the stars

I may seem secure, I could have it made
You might think you see a lucky man who made the grade
Nobody knows what dreams I see
Ain't nobody really sure just who they wanna be

But everybody has a place and time
A chance to live, a need to find
We all got somethin' that we care about
I propose you find it out

It's not in a book, or a magazine
Or the stars who guide our fortunes on the silver screen
Nobody knows, it's up to me
Ain't nobody who can say it like it ought to be

I see my future at the rainbow's end
Happy hours, timeless friends
And if I ever chance to find my way
Rest assured, I will stay

You may see your life as a compromise
You may live to find the promise dancin' in your eyes
Nobody knows, it's meant to be
Let the magic of the moment say it all to me",Nobody Knows,2000

But this half pint imitation

A whimpering, simpering child again

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep.
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I.

I lost my heart, but what of it, he is cold I agree
He might laugh, but I love it, although the laugh's on me.

And long, for the day when I'll cling to him.

But a fool can have his charms,

Words to get,.off his chest.

Thank god I can be oversexed again.
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I.

Wise at last, my eyes at last,
Are cutting you down to your size at last,
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more.

Burned a lot but learned a lot,
And now you are broke so you earned a lot,

Now my heartÃ¢??s antiseptic,

And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2001

Finding another world

That makes thrice, let's make it four

Helen Merrill,"Once I was young, yesterday, perhaps
Danced with Jim and Paul and kissed some other chaps

Then I met you
Oh, what a lovely time it was
How sublime it was too!

I didn't know what day it was
Then you held my hand
Warm like the month of May it was
And I'll say it was grand

Grand to be alive, to be young
To be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch
Hear your voice say I'm all your own

I didn't know what year it was
Life was no prize
I wanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes

Rather well preserved, the wrinkles didn't show
Once I was old, but not too old for fun
I used to hunt for little girls up my imaginary gun

That would bore me terrific'ly too

When I drive them high steppin' strutters.

The dashboard's genuine leather,
With isinglass curtains y' can roll right down,
In case there's a change in the weather.

Does it really have a team of snow white horses

When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top!

Cats and dogs'll dance in the heather,
Birds and frogs'll sing all together and the toads will hop!

The wind'll whistle as we rattle along,
The cows'll moo in the clover,
The river will ripple out a whispered song,
And whisper it over and over:
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever?
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever?

Don't you wisht y'd go on forever and ud never stop

Feel a sleepy head on my shoulder,
Noddin', droppin' close to my shoulder, till it falls kerplop!

Because we're far apart

And still she's in my heart

In July
Sweet pushcarts gently gliding by

The great big city's a wondrous toy
Just made for a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy

We'll go to Greenwich
Where modern men itch
To be free
And Bowling Green you'll see
With me

We'll bathe at Brighton
The fish you'll frighten
When you're in
Your bathing suit so thin
Will make the shellfish grin
Fin to fin

I'd like to take a
Sail on Jamaica Bay with you
And fair Canarsie's lake
We'll view

The city's bustle cannot destroy
The dreams of a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy

We'll go to Yonkers
Where true love conquers
In the wilds
And starve together, dear
In Childs'

We'll go to Coney
And eat baloney
On a roll
In Central Park we'll stroll
Where our first kiss we stole
Soul to soul

Our future babies
We'll take to ""Abie's Irish Rose""
I hope they'll live to see
It close

The city's clamor can never spoil
The dreams of a boy and goil
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy

We'll have Manhattan
The Bronx and Staten Island, too
We'll try to cross Fifth Avenue
As black as onyx

We'll find the Bronnix Park Express
Our Flatbush flat, I guess
Will be a great success
More or less

A short vacation
On Inspiration Point
We'll spend
And in the station house we'll end

But civic virtue cannot destroy
The dreams of a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy",Manhattan,2007
Helen O'Connell,"I work at the Palace Ballroom, but,
Gee that Palace is cheap;
When I get back to my chilly hall room
I'm much too tired to sleep.
I'm one of those lady teachers,
A beautiful hostess, you know,
The kind the Palace features
For only a dime a throw.

Ten cents a dance
That's what they pay me,
Gosh, how they weigh me down!
Ten cents a dance
Pansies and rough guys,
Tough guys who tear my gown!
Seven to midnight I hear drums.
Loudly the saxophone blows.
Trumpets are tearing my eardrums.
Customers crush my toes.
Sometime I think
I've found my hero,
But it's a queer romance.
All that you need is a ticket,
Come on, big boy, ten cents a dance.

Fighters and sailors and bowlegged tailors
Can pay for their ticket and rent me!
Butchers and barbers and rats from the harbors
Are sweethearts my good luck has sent me.
Though I've a chorus of elderly beaux,
Stockings are porous with holes at the toes.
I'm here till closing time,
Dance and be merry, it's only a dime.

On the school yard swings
When we exchanged graduation rings
One lovely yesterday
Time was when we wrote 
Love letters in the sand
Or lingered over our coffee and
Dreaming the time away.
Picnics and hay rides and mid-winter
Sleigh rides and never apart
Hikes in the country and 
There's more than one tree
On which I've a place in your heart

If all our moments are half as sweet
As all our time was then",Time Was (Duerme),2016

Honey, here's the way it's goin' to be:
You will set behind a team of snow white horses,
In the slickest gig you ever see!

Chicks and ducks and geese better scurry
When I take you out in the surrey,
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top!
Watch that fringe and see how it flutters
When I drive them high steppin' strutters.

Nosey pokes'll peek thru' their shutters and their eyes will pop!
The wheels are yeller, the upholstery's brown,
The dashboard's genuine leather,
With isinglass curtains y' can roll right down,
In case there's a change in the weather.

Two bright sidelight's winkin' and blinkin',
Ain't no finer rig I'm a-thinkin'
You c'n keep your rig if you're thinkin' 'at I'd keer to swap
Fer that shiny, little surrey with the fringe on the top! Did you say 

the fringe was made of silk
Wouldn't have no other kind but silk
Does it really have a team of snow white horses
One's like snow, the other's more like milk

All the world'll fly in a flurry
When I take you out in the surrey,
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top!
When we hit that road, hell fer leather,
Cats and dogs'll dance in the heather,
Birds and frogs'll sing all together and the toads will hop!

The wind'll whistle as we rattle along,
The cows'll moo in the clover,
The river will ripple out a whispered song,
And whisper it over and over:
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever?
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever?

Don't you wisht y'd go on forever and ud never stop
In that shiny, little surrey with the fringe on the top!
I can see the stars gettin' blurry,
When we drive back home in the surrey,
Drivin' slowly home in the surrey with the fringe on top!
I can feel the day gettin' older,
Feel a sleepy head on my shoulder,
Noddin', droppin' close to my shoulder, till it falls kerplop!

The sun is swimmin' on the rim of a hill,
The moon is takin' a header,
And jist as I'm thinkin' all the earth is still,
A lark'll wake up in the medder.
Hush, you bird, my baby's a-sleepin'!

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1999

Helen Reddy,"You live your life in the songs you hear
On the rock and roll radio
And when a young girl doesn't have any friends
That's a really nice place to go
Folks hoping you'd turn out cool
But they had to take you out of school
You're a little touched you know, Angie baby

Lovers appear in your room each night
And they whirl you across the floor
But they always seem to fade away
When your daddy taps on your door
Angie girl, are you all right
Tell the radio good-night
All alone once more, Angie baby

Angie baby, you're a special lady
Living in a world of make-believe
Well, maybe

Stopping at her house is a neighbor boy
With evil on his mind
'Cause he's been peeking in Angie's room
At night through the window blind
I see your folks have gone away
Would you dance with me today?
I'll show you how to have a good time, Angie baby

When he walks in the room, he feels confused
Like he's walked into a play
And the music's so loud it spins him around
'Til his soul has lost its way
And as she turns the volume down
He's getting smaller with the sound
It seems to pull him off the ground
Toward the radio he's bound
Never to be found

The headlines read that a boy disappeared
And everyone thinks he died
Except a crazy girl with a secret lover who
Keeps her satisfied
It's so nice to be insane
No one asks you to explain
Radio by your side, Angie baby

Angie baby, you're a special lady
Living in a world of make-believe
Well, maybe

Well, maybe (Angie baby, Angie baby)
Well, maybe (Angie baby, Angie baby)

Helen Reddy,"Lonely, well out of desperate come
And I'm hanging at the end of a line
Losing hope when the phone doesn't ring
It's a feeling I choose over feeling alone

Then you stumble in
And I am tumblin back where it begins
Cause you can spread my wings
I'm saving the powers and dreams
To plot a million strings with emotion
And you can fill my nights
Oh, and blow out all my lights
Till I see nothing but my emotions
My emotions
I'm running out of ways makin you care
As hard as I try you know it just isn't there
For all I give I'm only getting old
When I think I'm finally back in control

Then you stumble in
And I am tumblin back where it begins
Cause you can spread my wings

To plot a million strings with emotion
And you can fill my nights

Helen Reddy,"I remember as a child I used to hear
Music that they played Lord with a feel'
Some call it folk, some call it soul
People let me tell you it was rock and roll

I was raised on rock, I got rhythm in my soul
Every day when I got home I turned on my radio

Listening to the music that my idols made
I knew every single record the DJ's played
A honky tonk a Hound Dog, a Johnny B. Goode
Chain Gang, Love Is Strange, Knock On Wood

I was raised on rock, I got rhythm in my soul
I was born to love the beat I was made for rock and roll

I thought it was a fad, thought that it would pass
But the younger generation knew it would last
Time's gone by, the beat goes on
But every time I hear it Lord it takes me home

I was raised on rock, I got rhythm in my soul
Every day when I got home I turned on my radio

Mother played recordings of Beethoven's Fifth
Mozart's sonatas down the classical Liszt
My papa loved to listen to his country songs
While I was in the back room rockin' on

I was raised on rock, I got rhythm in my soul

I got a song; I got a song.

I got a song, I got a song,

And I carry it with me and I sing it loud,
If it gets me nowhere, I'll go there proud.

Helen Reddy,"You and me against the world,
Sometimes it seems like you and me against the world,
When all the others turn their backs and walked away,
You can count on me to stay.

How you were frightened by the clown,
Wasn't it nice to be around someone that you knew,
Someone who was big and strong and looking out for

You and me against the world,
Sometimes it seems like you and me against the world
And for all the times we've cried I always felt that
God was on our side.

And when one of us is gone,
And one of us is left to carry on,
Then remembering will have to do,
Our memories alone will get us through

Of you and me against the world.",You & Me Against the World,1975

I've been changed, yes really changed
In these past few days when I see myself, I seem like someone else

I don't know how to take this, I don't see why he moves me
He's a man, he's just a man
And I've had so many men before in very many ways, he's just one more

Should I bring him down, should I scream and shout
Should I speak of love, let my feelings out
I never thought I'd come to this, what's it all about

Don't you think it's rather funny that I should be in this position
I'm the one who's always been so calm, so cool, no lover's fool
Running every show, he scares me so

Should I bring him down, should I scream and shout
Should I speak of love, let my feelings out
I never thought I'd come to this, what's it all about

Yet, if he said he loved me, I'd be lost, I'd be frightened
I couldn't cope, just couldn't cope
I'd turn my head, I'd back away, I wouldn't want to know
He scares me so, I want him so, I love him so",I Don't Know How to Love Him,1975

On an endless screen of deep emotion

CHORUS:  

Keep on singing 
Don't stop singing
You're gonna be a star someday
You're gonna make a lot of people happy
When they come to hear you play
They said keep on singin
Keep the bells a ringin

Spread the music from town to town
There's not enough song in this old world
So spread your song around
By the time I was 10 years old
I had a rock n roll band
Daddy's eyes were growing dim
But I didn't understand
He said he would be so proud of me
Each time he'd hear us play
At night he'd pull me to his side
And daddy would always say

CHORUS

He didn't have much money
But things didn't seem so bad
I felt just like the queen of the world
When I was with my dad
Then one rainy April night
Daddy called me to his side
He held me with his tremblin hands
Right before he died

Helen Reddy,"I used to play around with hearts that hastened at my call
But when I met that little girl I knew that I would fall

Poor little fool, oh yeah, I was a fool, uh huh

She played around and teased me with her carefree devil eyes
She'd hold me close and kiss me but her heart was full of lies

Poor little fool, oh yeah, I was a fool, uh huh

She told me how she cared for me and that we'd never part
And so for the very first time I gave away my heart

The next day she was gone and I knew she'd lied to me
She left me with a broken heart and won her victory

I'd played this game with other hearts but I never thought I'd see
The day that someone else would play love's foolish game with me

How you were frightened by the clown,
Wasn't it nice to be around someone that you knew,
Someone who was big and strong and looking out for

You and me against the world,
Sometimes it seems like you and me against the world
And for all the times we've cried I always felt that
God was on our side.

Helen Reddy,"You live your life in the songs you hear
On the rock and roll radio
And when a young girl doesn't have any friends
That's a really nice place to go
Folks hoping you'd turn out cool
But they had to take you out of school.
You're a little touched you know, Angie baby

Lovers appear in your room each night
And they whirl you across the floor
But they always seem to fade away
When your daddy taps on your door
Angie girl, are you all right
Tell the radio good-night
All alone once more, Angie Baby

[Chorus:] 
Angie baby, you're a special lady
Living in a world of make-believe
Well, maybe

Stopping at her house is a neighbor boy
With evil on his mind
Cause he's been peeking in Angie's room
At night through the window blind
I see your folks have gone away
Would you dance with me today
I'll show you how to have a good time, Angie baby

When he walks in the room, he feels confused
Like he's walked into a play
And the music's so loud it spins him around
'Til his soul has lost it's way
And as she turns the volume down
He's getting smaller with the sound
It seems to pull him off the ground
Toward the radio he's bound
Never to be found

The headlines read that a boy disappeared
And everyone thinks he died
'Cept a crazy girl with a secret lover who
Keeps her satisfied
It's so nice to be insane
No one asks you to explain
Radio by your side, Angie baby

Well I know I really try;
Thinking of you;
Loving the sunshine in your eyes.

And when I falter,
Bringing you grief
Does it alter your feeling for me?
Oh baby can't you see?

That we're sharing,
All the ups we have in life,
While comparing,
All the downs that we've survived.

But how much stronger
Our love becomes.
And the longer we're living as one,
The more we'll overcome.

And I have lived the greatest love song,
That my singer's years have ever heard.
You make this weary woman happy.
I overflow, it's cause I know 
You wouldn't trade me,
For the moon inside a jar
For you've made me
Both the moon and the stars

And in our twilight,
We will recall, that the highlight
For us in this world,
Was having dreams come true.

And tell me, who will never let you down in any situation
Who will always see you get your share

On s'est connu, on s'est reconnu
On s'est perdu de vue, on s'est r'perdu d'vue
On s'est retrouvé, on s'est réchauffé
Puis on s'est séparé

Chacun pour soi est reparti
Dans l'tourbillon de la vie
Je l'ai revue un soir, aïe, aïe, aïe
Ça fait déjà un fameux bail
Ça fait déjà un fameux bail

Au son des banjos je l'ai reconnue
Ce curieux sourire qui m'avait tant plu
Sa voix si fatale, son beau visage pâle
M'émurent plus que jamais

Je me suis soûlé en l'écoutant
L'alcool fait oublier le temps
Je me suis réveillé en sentant
Des baisers sur mon front brûlant
Des baisers sur mon front brûlant

On s'est connu, on s'est reconnu
On s'est perdu de vue, on s'est r'perdu de vue
On s'est retrouvé, on s'est séparé
Puis on s'est réchauffé

Chacun pour soi est reparti
Dans l'tourbillon de la vie
Je l'ai revue un soir ah! là là
Elle est retombée dans mes bras
Elle est retombée dans mes bras

Quand on s'est connu, quand on s'est reconnu
Pourquoi s’perdre de vue, se reperdre de vue ?
Quand on s'est retrouvé, quand on s'est réchauffé
Pourquoi se séparer?

Alors tous deux on est repartis
Dans le tourbillon de la vie
On a continué à tourner
Tous les deux enlacés
Tous les deux enlacés

Tous les deux enlacés",La Vie S'Envole,2007

Of sounding brass
That seems to say I've found
I've found you, I've found you.

Strange music of the sphere

While we treasure every measure,

The spittin' image of his dad

Than his puddin-headed father ever had

And dive through a wave

And you won't see nobody dare to try
To boss or toss him around!
No pot-bellied, baggy-eyed bully
Will boss him around.

I don't give a hang what he does
As long as he does what he likes!
He can sit on his tail
Or work on a rail
With a hammer, hammering spikes!
He can ferry a boat on a river
Or peddle a pack on his back
Or work up and down
The streets of a town
With a whip and a horse and a hack.

He can haul a scow along a canal
Run a cow around a corral
Or maybe bark for a carousel
Of course it takes talent to do that well.

Or a feller that sells you glue,

Well, then, if you're British and loyal, 
You might enjoy Royal Marine! 
Anyway, it's clean.
Though of course, it tastes of wherever it's been! 
TODD:
Is that squire, 
On the fire? 
LOVETT:
Mercy no, sir, look closer, 
You'll notice it's grocer! 
TODD:
Looks thicker, 
More like vicar! 
LOVETT:
No, it has to be grocer --
It's green! 

TODD:
The history of the world, my love --

Save a lot of graves, 
Do a lot of relatives favors! 
TODD:
Is those below serving those up above!

Ev'rybody shaves, 
So there should be plenty of flavors! 
TODD:
How gratifying for once to know
BOTH:
That those above will serve those down below!

LOVETT: Butler? 
TODD: Subtler.
LOVETT: Potter? 
TODD: Hotter.
LOVETT: Locksmith? 

Lovely bit of clerk.
TODD:
Maybe for a lark.
LOVETT:
Then again there's sweep
If you want it cheap
And you like it dark! 
Try the financier, 
Peak of his career! 
TODD:
That looks pretty rank.
LOVETT:
Well, he drank, 
It's a bank
Cashier.
Never really sold.
Maybe it was old.
TODD:
Have you any Beadle? 
LOVETT:
Next week, so I'm told! 
Beadle isn't bad till you smell it and
Notice 'ow well it's been greased...

Oh, Mr. Todd, 
Ooh, Mr. Todd, 
What does it tell? 
TODD:
Is who gets eaten, and who gets to eat! 
LOVETT:
And, Mr. Todd, 
Too, Mr. Todd, 
Who gets to sell! 
TODD:
But fortunately, it's also clear
BOTH:
That [L: But] ev'rybody goes down well with beer! 

LOVETT: (spoken)
Since marine doesn't appeal to you, 'ow about... rear admiral? 
TODD: Too salty. I prefer general.
LOVETT: With, or without his privates? ""With"" is extra.

TODD: What is that? 
LOVETT:
It's fop.
Finest in the shop.
And we have some shepherd's pie peppered
With actual shepherd on top! 
And I've just begun --
Here's the politician, so oily
It's served with a doily, 
Have one! 
TODD:
Put it on a bun.
Well, you never know if it's going to run! 
LOVETT:
Try the friar, 
Fried, it's drier! 
TODD:
No, the clergy is really
Too coarse and too mealy! 
LOVETT:
Then actor, 
That's compacter! 
TODD:
Yes, and always arrives overdone! 
I'll come again when you have JUDGE on the menu! 

LOVETT: (spoken) Wait! True, we don't have judge yet, 
But we've got something you might fancy even better.
TODD: What's that? 
LOVETT: Executioner! 

TODD:
Have charity towards the world, my pet!

Yes, yes, I know, my love!

All I meant is that I haven't seen a customer in weeks
Did you come in for a pie, sir?
Do forgive me if me head's a little vague
What was that?

But you'd think we had the plague
By the way the people keep avoiding
No you don't, heaven knows I try, sir
But there's no one even comes in to inhale
Right you was, would you like a drop of Ale?

Mind you, I can hardly blame them
These are probably the worst pies in London
I know why nobody cares to take them
I should know, I make 'em

The worst pies in London, even that's polite

If you dare to take a bite
Is that just disgusting?

You'll have to concede it
It's nothing but crusting
Her drink this, you'll need it

And no wonder with the price of meat
What it is, when you get it
Never thought I'd live to see the day
Men'd think it was a trick, finding poor animals
What are dying in the street

Mrs. Mooney has a pie shop
Does her business but I noticed something weird
Lately all her neighbors cats have disappeared
Have to hand it to her, what I calls enterprise
Poppin' pussies into pies

Wouldn't do in my shop
Just the thought of it's enough to make you sick
And I'm tellin' you them pussy cats is quick

No denying times is hard, sir
Even harder then the worst pies in London
Only lard and nothing more
Is that just revolting?

All greasy and gritty
It looks like it's molting

Quell'emozione in più
Ad ogni tua parola

Tu, probabilmente, tu
Sei stata fino a qui
Per troppo tempo sola,
Fino a convincerti, come me
Che si può stare da soli.

Perché, la solitudine
Che non sorride mai
Diventa l'abitudine
E non la scelta che tu fai

Ma ora che son qui
Il vento cambierà
E semberà più facile
Il tempo che verrà

La vita può soprenderti
In tutto quel che fa
E dove non lo immagini
Incontri la felicità

E sono qui con te
E non ti lascerò
Ti chiedo di fermarti qui
E stare insieme a te
E stare insieme a te

Sì, adesso ci sei tu
Nei sogni e nelle idee
Nell'immaginazione.
Tu, che sei vicino a me,
Così vicino a me
Che sei parte di me
Cosi dentro di te
Come una sensasione
Sei le parole e la musica
Per una nuova canzone.

Perché la solitudine
Non si riprenderà
La voglia di sorridere
Ora no.
E la felicità
Se ci sei.
Per quello che tu sai
fe lo sai.
Per quello che mi dai
anche tu.
Per un amore semplice
Ma grande più che mai

E non è un'abitudine
Il bene che mi fai
Anche tu
E l'allegria di viverti
Finchè vuoi.
Di averti accanto più che mai!

E adesso siamo noi
Io e te
Ci siamo solo noi
Solo noi

Sicuri di non perderci
Di non lasciarci mai.
Un'altra solitudine
Non ci riprenderà
E tu non te ne andrai.
