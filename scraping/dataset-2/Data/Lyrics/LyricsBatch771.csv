Nazareth,"Puppets in the dance are we
Or do we call the tune
We're keeping up our ratings
While we feed you wreck and ruin
Thespians of revolution, money in the bank
With our college boy lisps

Brown ale gurus Sunday supplement priests
Lunch with urban guerrillas
On expense account receipts
Opinionated interviews
From an informed source
can't tell you no names
secret of course

We are the people
I am you, you are me
We are the people, I am you, you are me
Any fool can see all the people
We are the people

We're on the side of politicians
Misquote their lies
Building up those favors
We collect on bye and bye
On the side of winners
We can change with the fees
Give us your proposition
We're only here to please

We are the people
I am you, you are me
We are the people
I am you, you are me
Any fool can see all the people
We are the people

Oh, please defend me
Don't ask for my surrender
We are the kings, you're the pretenders
You walk and I'll talk
Stop ringing my doorbell with questions

Subscribe, view us, listen to us
We've got the plan
We've got all the answers
And we've got your man
We can change the format
If the sales go down
And we got girls for everyone
Yellow, pink or brown

We are the people

I am you, you are me

Nazareth,"Presidents and peace spreading poets
Getting gunned down in the streets
Shown to us on our prime time screens
For our tea time treat
Lunatics we voted for denying
Everything that they swore
We sit around and shout about it
But we don't do nothing more

Drafted for police action
But they decided on a war
Telling us we were saving mankind
Why don't you ask Cambodia
We were solving it with marijuana
We were sure that we could
Always leavin' it to someone else
Just knocking on wood

We're goin' back to the trenches
We're goin' back to the trenches

Well you say you got a say so 
But you're knowin' that it ain't so
And you turn away
You think it's safer to ignore it
But the score is your children have to pay
Everybody wants better
Everybody talkin' 'bout it
Are we wastin' time
Gotta stop only lookin', talkin'
We're all guilty of the crime

We're goin' back to the trenches
We're goin' back to the trenches

We gotta move, we got everything to lose
We gotta move, we got everything to lose

We're all headed for the front
But everybody's fightin' for a good address
It's time we made the changes
Or we'll be burnin' with the rest
We just ain't communicatin' and I don't
Mean conversations on the telephone
When Nero starts to fiddle this time
There's a lot more gonna burn than Rome

Hey, boy, haven't you heard the news

One more word that bites the dust on some bar room floor
I'm the man who travels 'round doing
Hey, we don't talk about that
I'll get the favor done for you
No one will ever know

Then I'll run to Mexico

Cold as stone my eyes fall on another
Just another name that's runnin' through my mind
At your request I'll do whatever you require
You give me the light, I supply the fire

Then I'll burn for Mexico

Pretty senorita, she lies to me
Smiles sweetly in the morning when I wake up cold sweating
'Cause some day I'll be in the sights

One more call when someone finds a target
Only guarded whispers never mentions names
Money on the line will be just fine
You'll never be involved
And even if a clue shows you'll never know

I'm reserving my rights, reputation
Livin' in a movie, it's keepin' me lookin' right
When the secret is out to the public
Seein' is believin', they still want to be me at night
When the parts get shorter, the parties get harder
But that's alright

Preservation, lookin' in the mirror
Preservation, but they don't know that I'm scrapin' it off

They're linin' up to make their entrance

Tried to run they took away my shoes--why you want to?

Will you have your name in the Sunday papers

Do you think about it, I'll bet you do
Do you think about it, do you think about it
Do you think about it, I'll bet you do

Are you gonna back up on your promises
Did you tell the folks you could make the changes
Are you gonna play it different than the last one
You got the address and you got the power
Are you gonna use it right or abuse it
Taking all the trust that you know you're given
Are you gonna play the game or just lose it

Prayin' moves don't make much sense to you
Seeing red before your feeling is blue

Stretch it lean and mean, it turns you around
Take your dreams and stretch them out on the street
Take your turn to get back on your feet

Feel the song like ""Oakland"" take you

All the girls were glad to see you

Don't give you a hard time

Givin' a dawn about judgement day
I may be the first in line when there's hell to pay
But I'm a grinnin'-sinnin' in a million ways:
She's a thinkin' man's nightmare
Feels so good
Snake bite creeper, fow lair timeshare
Light house keeper, cocktail light affair
She's a reader and a weeper, anytime, anywhere
Feels so good
A thinkin' man's nightmare, tuxedo princess
Quicksand bridal wear, in a home grown red dress
Beach-ballin' dan dare, sleazy, easy access

Feels so good, feels so good
Feels so good, feels so good

Nazareth,"Another bridge I have burned
A lesson I learned
One more mistake to my cause
One more hand got lost

So I was up for awhile

Feelin' high on the hog

I was down

Now some say I lost
His other soul
How barely a young man
Can sink so low

I thought I had wandered a mile

You got on the attack
But some never had a chance in hell

I wanna know what you were thinkin
As your walls came down
Surprised eyes of your sacrifice
Or just that you'd been found
If they done to you what you could do
You'd be torn apart
You haven't suffered quite enough boy
But it's a start

You had it comin? comin? to you
You had it comin? really had it comin? to you

My, my, funny time don't fly
When you got you to yourself
And your disease makes you ill at ease
Bad for your health
Then all these questions with your patient replies
Not foolin? anyone
If not for you only strong survive,if they run

You had it comin? comin? to you

He was bent down, burned out, carryin' a sack
Come on boy, you got to stop and help me some
And keep this money hidden when the police come

Ronnie was shiverin' and makin' funny sounds
He was lookin' like a fox
That was runnin' from the hounds
Sure little buddy, I can lighten up your load

You half it up, I'll hit it up, I'll take it down the road

'Cause Willie was a roadie with a rock 'n' roll band
They were heads back, celebratin', drinkin' moonshine
Heads down, here we go across another state line

Tanked up and bullet proof
They couldn't give a monkey's
Damn if he didn't hide the money in a drum case
Pack 'em up, hit em up, do another show

The robber and the roadie got a long way to go

Willie and Ronnie

Anytime they wanted they would pull another job
Anywhere they found a place
And it was fat enough to rob
If Ronnie saw the police he would make a little sign

Then Willie stuck the money in the band's back line
In the main racks, bass stacks
Anywhere he thought it could
Be hidden out of sight

Until the finished out in Hollywood
Split it down the middle
When they took it out the sound
The robber and the roadie got enough to go around

Willie and Ronnie

Forty seven days and they had only one to go
When the telegram arived
To say the band wouldn't show

The bottles and the bodies started coverin' the stage
Then the cops came running in
And breaking up the riotin'
When they saw the money falling

Out the back of everything
Hey little buddy think it's time to run and duck
The robber and the roadie could be runnin' out of luck

Willie and Ronnie had to skip it out of town
They were sittin' by the highway like Jackson Browne
They were stickin' out their thumbs
In the middle of the night

When they saw the car comin' with the spinnin' red light
Wide eyed, tongue tied feelin' pretty stranded
No use in runnin' they were caught red handed
Pull 'em in, lock 'em up, put 'em in a row
The robber and the roadie got nowhere to go

The robber and the roadie

We got state police and the FBI

Red eyes staring me out
Strange feelings comin' down tonight
Can't quite figure it out
Fit your alibi before your crime
No need in serving no time
Case you scam, or you'll get rammed
Stretched out on that line

Hangin' out at a shooting site
Cold turkey calling a tune
All the answers coming late tonight
Try to look like you're immune
In your eyes you can feel the heat
But the feelings outa touch
You're working on just a holding on
You're hurtin' oh so much

Feel the city heartbeat, feel the pulse in the streets
Can you feel the city heartbeat, can you feel the pulse in the streets
Can you feel your own heartbeat
Can you feel your blood begin to heat?

Call off your dogs 'cause I am no fox
Turn off your white light
My alibi is rock tight
Your night stick, cheap trick is pullin' me in
Your monkey suit, stage fright, black and white blue suit, law suit
Is wearin', mighty thin

Feel the city heartbeat, feel the pulse in the streets
Can you feel the city heartbeat, can you feel the pulse in the streets
Can you feel your own heartbeat
Can you feel your blood begin to heat?

Borstal boy laughing at justice now he's a star
And the perfume he wore lingers on the king's road
Like a whore
Legs wrapped around a plastic stool
He's making more in one day
Than you've had.......hot, hot dinners

Call out your legions, the savior is loose
Telling true stories you know that ain't no use
Your empire is burning you can feel the smell
Your hot rod , space pod, tax relief, kill machine
Is looking mean
And should be working well

Feel the city heartbeat, feel the pulse in the streets
Can you feel your own heartbeat
Can you feel the pulse in the streets
Can you feel your own heartbeat
Can you feel your blood begin to heat?

Tomorrow you’ll be on your way
Could be Memphis or L.A.
No questions just get out and play

Wake up call to catch the plane
You know you’re on the road again
Someone’s bangin’ in your head
Why did you get so late to bed?

Runnin’ late and feelin’ bad
That breakfast was the worst you’ve had
Make the gate no time to spare
Before you know you’re in the air

747 flies us high
Much higher than we’re meant to be
You’re six miles high but feelin’ down
You wish you could be on the ground

Find your bags and walk for miles
The customs man is waitin’ there
Immigration cause delay
You wonder, if you’ll ever play

Limousine is standin’ by
We get inside and drive a while
F.M. station soundin’ good
And gettin’ better every mile

Hotel lobby looks the same
With all the same old girls in town

Press reception takes the day
With all the same old things to say
Need your picture, smile this way
And will you tell me what you play

So, you wanna be a rock 'n' roll star
Just listen now to what I say
Get yourself an electric guitar
And take some time and learn to play

Your roadies call to say okay
The sound check can get underway
Sound check over, had some fun
A waste of time for everyone
Time has come to start the show

It's boogie time for everyone
Check guitars before you go
They’re close enough for rock 'n' roll
The lights are low

The crowd is high, much higher than
They're meant to be
We take the stage and start to play
The lights come up for all to see

Here we are again, singin' the same old songs
Lookin for someone who will sing along
Here we are again playin' the same old scenes
Lookin' for someone who will share our dreams
Here we are again facing the same old sights
Lookin' for someone who will share our nights

Nazareth,"Why don't you tell me that it's over
Why do you keep this hangin' on
Pack up your bags and run for cover
Say what you mean and see it done

Why don't you cut me loose, you don't need me
Lift up your dress and walk away
There's nothin' left you can say to please me
You're just a dog who's had it's day

You beat around the bush and mumble
About the good old days we had
Your face grows longer as you crumble
You had the good now taste the bad

Let it all hit the fan
Let it all hit the fan

You promised me nothing would change you
More empty words from an empty soul
The same old stories you still cling to
The truth be told you leave me cold

You used to lead the dance and fumble
Howl in the night you could not sleep
You climbed to the top of the hill then tumbled
Too many promises come cheap.

But you been strong and stood by me every step-a-the-way,
I thank the lord for the day he brought you into my life,
Changed my world -my destiny - and gave me new life,
So if you got somebody special - that's always been true,
Show love and take note in everything that they do,
I could neva take fjor granted what she's done for me,
Even when we desagree she still stands by me,
Late night - road trips- showin' mad support,
The typa-girl-that every homie should be keepin' close,
'cause your that typa-a-girl that neva let me down,
Encouraged me to see the light when no one else would come
Around, down when I had money- and down when I was broke,
So if I die tonight hold me tight and don't let go!
I guess that you can say I owe my life to you the
Only dream that really matters is to be with you cuzz
Even though we argue and we fight some times
you'll always be my queen until the end of times

Could of died that day a happy and complete man
'cause in the palm of my hands
Everything that I dreamed for and more
And you know I'm down for yours
Forever and life the reason I made you my wife is because
You see me for me the real me and love me unconditionally
And even with the circumstances that I had you still gave me a chance
And that's why I live and breathe for you and the kids
And you give me more than what this thing could ever give to me
And now my life is satisfied and complete visions all coming true
Yea of me and you placing rings on each others fingers saying ""I do""
You stuck with me through my thick and my thin to go back and live life over again
Nah this is my destiny it was worth the agony to get the ecstasy.

We can runaway and spend some time
I'll always be the one right by your side
Tell the whole world you belong to me
You are my everything
I want to run away with you

And even tho it was wrong I fell in love with you
Now we sit here not really knowing what to do
But I'm sure that you know I'll give the world for you
If I could runaway with you I wouldn't even think twice
I promise girl I'll put it all on the line
I know forever seems to be a long time
But that's what I'm seeing when I look into your eyes
And it don't matter what your friends might say
'cause I know deep inside you feel the same way
You could tell me what you want but I could read your mind
So quit lying to yourself and put hand mine
I get excited everytime you come close
And being right here with you is what I love the most
So any time your feeling lonely inside
We could runaway together and leave this world behind

We can runaway and spend some time

I want to run away with you

Waking up in the morning and your still not there
Can't we runaway and escape somewhere
Missing your soft touch your lips next to mine
Holdin up your hands as you look in my eyes
What must of happened to the love we both felt inside
Emotions were strong and the feeling was right
Now we don't speak anymore you went your own way
And that's what loves about then I was meant left
Go ahead and take your time if that's what you need
My loves for you forever my heart for you bleeds
Things happen for a reason so I ask my self should I be strong
And wait or move on to some one else
I know you still love me I could feel it inside
You always kept it real no games no lies
If your ever feelin lonely feel the need to get away
Call me up I'll be there together we'll run away girl

And have you ever loved somebody that would give it all for you

Lived life by myself

Just cared for the wealth

Never slackin'

But now (but now) I see (I see)
That you're my one and only

I can't eat (I can't eat) I can't sleep (I can't sleep) no more, no more

Then my eyes open wide
And I see you ain't there
Then the joy from the music turn to a permanent tear of ink

That I'll always love you baby

Sometime I think about 
Everything that we've been through 
And I pray that you would just open your eyes 
I love you I need you 
So please don't throw our love away 

Since the day you and I snuck away to be alone
I knew from that night something special went on
It must have been the first kiss 
You told me that no one else in the world made you feel this 

I felt the same way too but nothing stays the same
I'm sorry for the tears I'm sorry for the pain 
You were the one that always made things right 
I promise you this though you got a friend for life

Maybe one day we can try it again 
And maybe things can be a little different 
So lets just kiss and say goodbye 
'Cause I really can't stand the pain of seeing you cry

I've given everything 
I loved you endlessly 
But when it comes to me 
You don't even notice me 

I've given everything 
I loved you endlessly 
But when it comes to me 
You don't even notice me

All that's mine is yours that's what I said 
Treat you with love and respect in everyway 
You wanted I gave you need me I was there 
Now you treat like if I'm not here 

I love you and I need you don't want to let go 
If you want somebody else please let me know 
Can't take it no more I feel in dying inside 
Is this the price I pay for handing you my life? 

I know I'm not prefect but I truly cared 
So when you wake up one morning and I'm not there 
Just remember I loved you it will never be the same 
Gave you everything and you threw it all away

I've given everything 
I loved you endlessly 
But when it comes to me 
You don't even notice me 
I've given everything 
I loved you endlessly 
But when it comes to me 
You don't even notice me [Repeat: x 2]

I gave you my good and my bad 
My heart and my soul, 
My trust my money my time, 
What more can you ask from a man 

Even when times are hard 
I held out my arms and held you 
Even excepted you though whatever weather
But now I feel it we're at the end of the rope 

Whatever we had now I gotta let go 
Nights like this I wish raindrops would fall 
To cover my tears 
Wishing I could replace all those wasted years 

Of loving someone who couldn't love me back
And now again I gotta start from scratch 
But I know I've given you my everything 

I've given everything 
I loved you endlessly

You don't even notice me

And understand that my life is different and accepts it.
This isn't what I expected.
Yeah she's beautiful inside and out.
Something hard to find in the world these days.
Even on my worst day,
She's got me happy like a kid waking up on his birthday.
Yeah this love was different it was based on friendship.
I'm letting you know I'm ready to ride out with you.

Something about you baby
Drives me crazy
Something about this pretty girl
Blows my mind,
Something about you baby
Drives me crazy
Something about this pretty girl
Blows my mind

What's up little shortie can we talk for a minute.
I've been having dreams and you been all up in em'.
I know you don't know me I've seen you around.
Your the hottest looking honey that I seen in this town.
Come on lets conversate, take a walk get together.
Just wanna know you a little bit better.
Beauty incomparable eyes drove me crazy.
She that type I wanna have for my lady.
Something about you don't know what it is.
I know we just met but can I give you a kiss.
Grabbed her hand and she hugged me, acting kinda shy.
Dimples on your face got you looking pretty fly.
Baby this is real talk I wanna be with you.
Little did I know, you were digging me too.
Now I'm down on my knees got you saying I do.
So I had to write a song dedicated to you.

Something about you baby
Drives me crazy
Something about this pretty girl
Blows my mind,

I gotta be right there
Whenever you call on me
I want to be your everything
So tell me if your feeling me

Now all my life
I've never felt like this
For some one else
Yeah baby I'm feeling you
The way that you've been feeling me
When no one else in the world even cared for me
You held me close
The way
You told me things would be okay
On my bad days
And most of my good times were cause of you
Knowing we were strong
Cause the things we've been through
Your the one I want to grow old with
To make my memory's to cherish
In hold in the back of my mind
And girl you was like hard to find
In this crazy world of material things
You loved me when I had nothing
It made you worth some thing

[Chorus]

I'm feeling you
Not once
Not twice
But your three times my lady
The comfort of your arms got me feeling like your baby
I'll be there for you
Lets make love into memories
Your tender touch
And you smile
Always get the best of me
Never let you go or treat you bad
Give you all I have
I belong to you
And only you girl
I want you bad
You want to be my sun up
I want to be your light
You want to be my lady
I'm thinking more like my wife
Got me feeling crazy girl
You driving me wild
I can make you happy
If you come with me now
Let me be your everything baby
Do all I can
What I'm tryin' to say to you now
I want to be your man

This is for my muneca
With them pretty brown eyes
Have I ever told you girl
That you always on my mind
And when I finally get to see you
I feel a rush inside
A thousand time a day
Your pretty face runs through my mind
I want to stay with you
Cause it was meant to be
Your like an angel from the heavens
That was sent to me
My precious one
The one that fulfills my needs with happiness
The one that keeps me focused
When I,
I start to stress
I want to thank you baby
For the many things you've done for me
And all the goodness
You always put inside of me
With that pretty face
With that sexy walk
With that lovin' that you given me
When the lights is off

NB Ridaz,"Desde el día que te conocí
Yo sabia que eres un ángel del cielo

Cada vez que estamos juntos
Se me llena el corazon
Eres tu mi alegría
y tu sonrisa es mi sol
Cada vez que estamos juntos
Yo me siento tan feliz
Porque el sol y las estrellas me acercaron a ti

Despertando en la mañana pensando en ti
Tus brazos y besos los quiero sentir
Yo te quiero, y te amo, que haría sin ti?
Un ángel que Dios me enviado a mi
Me ensenaste amar mi razón por vivir
Prometo ser fiel y estaremos feliz
Tu ya sabes que conmigo sola nunca estarás
Mi corazon te pertenece nunca mas lloraras
Eres toda mi vida, mi mujer especial
sonrisa mas bella, días haces brillar
No hay nada en este mundo que no haría por ti
No te olvides yo te quiero, contigo quiero morir

Tu eres toda mi vida
Mi consentido
Ya no quiero estar sin ti

Tu eres toda mi vida
Mi consentido
Ya no quiero estar sin ti

Ya no quiero vivir sin ti a mi lado
Eres el amor que siempre a buscado
Por eso mismo  te mando esta canción
Para decirte que te entrego mi amor
Quiero que sepas todo lo que siento por ti
Si no estas en mis brazos, no soy feliz
Cada minuto, de cada hora, de cada día
Quiero que siempre seas mía
y cuando llegue la noche te voy a amar
Besando tu cuerpo, no quiero parar
Porque eres mi reina princesa de amor
La única, la dueña de mi corazon

Final mi reina a mi lado  te amo y te lo digo
quiero ser tu esposo, tu mejor amigo
la boda mas bella, tenderas tu Castillo
me tienes a tus pies, te entrego este anillo
dime que me amas y estarás conmigo
brindaremos nuestro amor y el futuro contigo
bailaremos en la noche brillaras como una estrella
honesto cuando digo eres tu la mas bella
me abrazas y me besas con tanto cariño
el día que te mire , halle mi destino
juntos para siempre haré todo por ti
yo se que tu me amas y confías en mi",Tu Eres,2004
NB Ridaz,"You know that I been wishin' for you some day I know you're comin' back
I know your comin' back girl someday
Tell me why you went away and left me lonely
NB Ridaz.com

I'm wishin' on a star (I'm wishin' a star)
To follow where you are (to follow where you are)
I'm wishin' on a dream (I'm wishin' on a dream)
To follow all my dreams (to follow all my dreams)
To make you come back to me

If I could take every second, every moment that we spent
Erase it from my life and start over again
I wouldn't do it, I couldn't even try
Cause even if the pain and tears never dry
At least I know I had my days with you
Rememberin' when it was just me and you
I close my eyes and wish it was a dream
That I could wake up and you would be next to me
Did you love me?
Did you lie to me?
Why'd you make a promise that you knew you couldn't keep?
You got me twisted and I'm losin' my grip
If I never met you girl, love wouldn't mean sh...
So I ain't never givin' up on you
I built my whole world and it was all around you
I made a promise and I'm keepin' it true
So I'll never love again if I can't have you

I'm wishin' on a star (I'm wishin' a star)
To follow where you are (to follow where you are)
I'm wishin' on a dream (I'm wishin' on a dream)
To follow all my dreams (to follow all my dreams)
To make you come back to me

If I had a wish, baby it would be this
Take you back to the days when we first kissed
You had never been touched, we loved each other so much
Holding you tight under the moon at night
I was yours, you were mine
Everything was so right
Wish upon a star, most precious of all
Can't imagine being without you
With all we been through
There's nothin' in this world I wouldn't do for you
Now I sit here alone, never knew I could cry
All I have is faithful memories
Wonderin' why you left me cold
Ripped my heart and my soul
Everyday I pray that I can see your smile once more
Come back, love I need you can't take it no more, 
Dyin' inside, life means nothin' no more
Don't want to say goodbye 
But I gotta let you know
If you ever change your mind
My love is all yours 

I'm wishin' on a star
You know I'm wishin' on a star
Tryin' to follow where you are (you are, you are)
(Where are you baby)
You know I'm wishin' on a star (Maybe in another lifetime)
Tryin' to follow where you are
Oh you are, you are, you are  

Now when I had you I loved you
When you had me all you ever did was hurt me
Even when I wanted to let go, I couldn't
My soul wouldn't let me 
Even through the bad times, I smiled
And the good days we shared together
It's hard to enjoy the success without you here
But I maintain
Magic told me this was gonna be best verse
I told him I just wrote it down cause my soul hurt
I'm tired of living a lie
I miss how she hugged and kissed me,
Loved and held me
Never thought my heaven could turn to hell so quickly
You gave me this broken heart,
You're the only one who can fix it
Forget the past, we gotta lot of time to make up for that
And even though we met other people
We have to admit it could never equal the sunshine
And pleasure that we made together

I'm wishin' on a star
You know I'm wishin' on a star
Tryin' to follow where you are (you are, you are)
(Where are you baby)
You know I'm wishin' on a star (Maybe in another lifetime)
Tryin' to follow where you are
Oh you are, you are, you are",Wishin,2004

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain

Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon

She don't need mine, she say leave mine alone
There ain't nothing that's more sexy, then a girl
That want but don't need me
Young independent (yea she work hard)
But you can't tell from the way that she walk
She don't slow down, 'cause she ain't got time
To be complaining, shawty goin' shine
She don't expect nothing from no guy
She plays aggressive, but she still shy
But you never know her softer side,
By looking in her eyes
Knowing she can do for herself
Makes me wanna give her my wealth
Only kinda girl I want,
Independent queen,
Workin' for her throne

I love her 'cause she got her own, she got her own

She don't need mine, she say leave mine alone
There ain't nothing that's more sexy,
Then a girl that want but don't need me
Lovely face, nice thick thighs,
Plus she got drive that matches my drive
Sexy thing, she's Ms. Fly
All the while paying her bills on time
She don't look at me like captain save 'em
Gold digging, no she don't do that
Now she look at me like inspiration,
She wanna be complimenting my swag
And everything she got, she work for it,
Good life made for it, she take pride in saying
That she paid for it, only kind of girl I want
Independent queen, working for her throne

[Chorus]

Don't make me laugh boo, never did that bad too,
Make you even have to but even if I had to
Ask my better half to, you'd be more than glad to
When I do that math boo, you always try and add two
I need someone who ride for me
Not someone who ride for free
She say boy I don't just ride
She'll pull up beside of me, I had to ask her
What she doing in that caddy
She say cause you my baby
I'll be stunting like my daddy
And there's not many, who catch my eye
We both wearin' Gucci, she match my fly
And that's why I supposed to keep her closer
Right by my side toaster in the holster
And now she went Loso case you didn't know so
You can save your money dog, shawty getting dough so
What she care what his cost, you can call her miss boss
I got it backwards, Kriss Kross shawty got her own

Now all my ladies that don't need a man for nothing,

I want to see you shine like the diamonds in my pendant

Let me get those jeans, and let me get that rock on your finger
Oh, it's stuck? Then I'll take the whole finger than, man

He probably did, you swallow his kids?
In and out of jail, he a snail, he wasn't wilding on bids

Quick, old fashion, in the back of the mall
Me and him had 'mos forever, like I'm supposed to put him on
When he came home and told on Trevor
Had to bang on homey, ear blocks, out in spots
Throwing them shots, like 'sucker, you know me'
Stop fronting for them people out, side like you really ride
And you a silly chick, thought you was really live
But I guess I was wrong, I'ma holla at dog
And rip his head off, words of a song

Hey yo, I thought we was iller than that, all them kisses
And love yous, when jake came, you hid my packs
It was time a brother went to war, vests banged up
Staining in the kitchen, yo, holding a four
Sweatin' and breathing, bounced out of town for a weekend
Heard you had homey in the passenger seating
Honey, look, I'm a monster don, I do monster things
That's why I put your ass under my arm
Messing with him can bring bodily harm
And where you gonna hide in the streets when the body is gone
If it's one thing I learned that, never trust a female
On no scale, you just confirmed that
Bounce to your momma house, pack your shit
I don't care if you crying, you'se a ruthless chick
Gots to watch you, these eyeballs in my face'll spot you
My girl cousins, they gon' rock you

Didn't I put you down
Flyest whips, rollin' round like yea

Rolling with him, tryin' to get revenge

Mercedes rug slide through the palm of a dime

Its the Prince
And you my Princess
Let's get it on

Mami QuÃ¨ linda
Look at cha' beautiful smile
I don't wanna leave ya
Why don't cha stay for a while

Ne-Yo,"How come you don't make time for me anymore, 
That's the last thing she said to you, 
And now when you call, 
She don't answer anymore, 
For the line is busy and you can't get through, 

[Chorus]
In the time it would take you to learn from your mistake, 
In the time it would take to dial the phone, 
In the time it would take you to realize her greatness, 
She'll be gone, 
She's moved on to someone who takes the time. 
 
Her love wasn't a priority to you, 
You had other things on your mind, 
And now that it's much too (??) 
And so far too late, 
The busy signal all that's left behind, 
You're all alone.

No one knows what they have until they don't, 
And by then it doesn't matter anymore,

When you get to fussing (fussing)
Yelling and throwing things
I just wanna eat you up
I don't mean no disrespect
When I start staring
Knowing that it makes you mad
I'm sorry that seeing you mad is so sexy

Could it be the little wrinkle over your nose
When you make your angry face
That makes me wanna just take off all your clothes
And sex you all over the place
Could it be the lil' way that you storm around
That makes me wanna tear you down

Every time you scream at me
I wanna kiss you
When you put your hands on me
I wanna touch you
When we get to arguing
Just gotta kiss you

But you're so damn sexy
When you're mad

Baby, don't think I don't take you seriously
But I just can't help the fact that your attitude excites me (so exciting)
And you know ain't nothing better
Then when we get
Mad together and have angry sex (I'll blow you out)
Then we forget what we were mad about

Ne-Yo,"The damage here along the gulf coast is catastrophic
There's a frantic effort under way tonight to find
survivors. There are an uncounted number of the dead tonight
People are being forced to live like animals
We are desperate
No one says the federal government is doing a good job
And hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people
No water, I fought my country for years
We need help, we really need help
In Baghdad, they they drop, they air drop water, food to people
why cant they do that to their own people?
The same idiots that can't get water into a major 
American city in less than three days are trying to win a war

People was poor before the hurricane came
But the down pour poured is like when Mary J. sang
Every day it rains, so every day the pain
But ignored them, and showed em the risk was to blame
For life is a chain, cause and effected
Niggas off the chain because they affected
It's a dirty game so whatever is effective
From weed to selling 'kane, gotta put that in effect
Wouldn't you loot, if you didn't have the loot?
Baby needed food and you stuck on the roof
Helicopter swooped down just to get a scoop
Through his telescopic lens but he didn't scoop you
The next five days, no help ensued
They called you a refugee because you seek refuge
The commander-in-chief just flew by
Did he stop? No, he had a couple seats
Just proved jet blue he's not
Jet flew by the spot
What if he ran out of jet fuel and just dropped
That would of been something to watch
Helicopters doing flybys to take a couple of shots
Couple of portraits then ignored 'em
He'd be just another bush surrounded by a couple orchids
Poor kids just 'cause they were poor kids
Left 'em on they porches same old story in New Orleans
Silly rappers, because we got a couple Porches
MTV stopped by to film our fortresses
We forget the unfortunate
Sure I ponied up a mill, but I didn't give my time
So in reality I didn't give a dime, or a damn
I just put my monies in the hands of the same people that left my people stranded
Nothin' but a bandit
Left them folks abandoned
Damn, that money that we gave was just a band-aid
Can't say we better off than we was before
In synopsis this is my minority report
Can't say we better off than we was before
In synopsis this is my minority report

So many times I'm, covering my eyes
Peeking through my fingers
Tryin' to hide my, frustration at the way that we treat
(Seems like we don't even care)
Turn on the TV, seein' the pain
Sayin' such a shame
Then tryin' to go on with my life
Of that, I too, am guilty
(Seems like we don't even care)
So we send a lil' money, tell 'em it's alright
To be able to sleep at night

That ain't my fault, no, no, listen

And just 'cause I might take advantage once or twice

But I didn't, so maybe
It's good to be crazy
Isn't it, baby?

I wrote your name on my wall three thousand times
Last night you were on my mind
That's what you do to me
That's what you do
That's what you do to me
That's what you...

Then, one by one I went down the line just repeating it
'Cause it makes me smile
That's what you do to me
That's what you do
That's what you do to me
That's what you...

Some say that it's
Just strange to act
That way
But they don't understand

No, they don't get it
You're so magnetic
Though it's pathetic
To them I simply turn and say...

Just call me crazy
Insane, deranged
It don't matter to me
Call it what you want to; I don't care
And it doesn't make a difference 'long as she's there
Just call me crazy
Lovin' you is crazy
Crazy is what I'll be
Ooo, crazy, ooo, crazy, ooo
Just call me crazy

Lately it seems like every song I write is about you
Ooo, I love your style
That's what you do to me
That's what you do
That's what you do to me
That's what you do

And it just don't make no sense, oh, how my swagger is crooked
If you ain't by my side
That's what you do to me
That's what you do
That's what you do to me
That's what you do
(Just call me crazy)

Just call me crazy
Insane, deranged
It don't matter to me
Call it what you want to; I don't care
And it doesn't make a difference 'long as she's there
Just call me crazy
Lovin' you is crazy
Crazy is what I'll be
Ooo, crazy, ooo, crazy, ooo
Just call me crazy

I talk to your picture
Ooo, write your name in the mirror
Right after I love you down
(Whoa) I need you so much
Can't get enough

Just call me crazy
Insane, deranged
It don't matter to me
Call it what you want to; I don't care

You probably don't care what I have to say

But I understand why that can't be

I just wonder

Think of me any more
Do you?

First off, let me say congratulations
Heard that you just had a baby girl
If she looks anything like her mother
She's the prettiest thing in the world

You was feeling something, something was wrong
Now that it's on, there's a smile on your face
And whatever was wrong, it's faded away

For the moment, the song will change your life
But if you believe, well it just might
If you listen right, the part that touches your heart
And your soul, that's what it does

And it might make you lose your mind, that's what it does
And it might make you cry sometimes, that's what it does
And it might chase the pain away, that's what it does
The devil, the angel, the pain and the pleasure
The music, that's what it does

Yesterday you were crying the loss of a man
A woman whatever, you understand
Turned on the song or release from the soreness of crying
You wound up crying some more

On your back, on the floor, you continue to cry
As the strings in the background kill you inside
But you never felt so alive, it is, it will be and it was
The house of fire, your and your love
Said it is, it will be and it was, that's what it does

And it might make you lose your mind, that's what it does
And it might make you cry sometimes, that's what it does
And it might chase the pain away, that's what it does

That's how much I need you
That's how much I love you

Ne-Yo,"And Ne-yo is like Young Michael, I'm Quincy hoe
Now hear the flow that broke the Da Vinci Code
I'm psycho, everything I wrote go together, so nice
Like a wedding make you wanna throw rice

I'm schitzo, cuckoo clock don't tick so
Write sometimes 'til the chicks noodles
I got screws loose
I pull words out the air like blue tooth

I'm a sandwich short of a picnic
Ignorant thoughts come across
You've sworn that I written this but I didn't
So maybe it's good to be crazy
Isn't it, baby?

I wrote your name on my wall
3000 times last night
You were on my mind
That's what you do to me
That's what you do
That's what you do to me
That's what you

Then one by one I went down the line
Just repeating it
'Cause it makes me smile
That's what you do to me
That's what you do
That's what you do to me
That's what you

Some say that it's just strange
To act that way
But they don't understand
No, they don't get it
You're so magnetic, though it's pathetic
To them I simply turn and say

Just call me crazy
Insane, deranged
It don't matter to me
Call it what you want to, I don't care
And it doesn't make a difference
Long as she's there

Just call me crazy
Lovin' you is crazy
Crazy is what I'll be
Ohh, crazy, ohh crazy, ohh
Just call me crazy

Lately it seems
Like every song I write is about you
Ohh, I love your style
That's what you do to me
That's what you do
That's what you do to me
That's what you do

And it just don't make no sense
How my swagger is crooked
If you ain't by my side
That's what you do to me
That's what you do
That's what you do to me
That's what you do

Just call me crazy
Insane, deranged
It don't matter to me
Call it what you want to, I don't care
And it doesn't make a difference
Long as she's there

Just call me crazy
Lovin' you is crazy
Crazy is what I'll be
Ohh, crazy, ohh crazy, ohh
Just call me crazy

I talk to your picture
Ohh, write your name in the mirror
Right after I love you down
I need you so much
Can't get enough

Just call me crazy
Insane, deranged
It don't matter to me
Call it what you want to, I don't care
And it doesn't make a difference
Long as she's there

Just call me crazy
Lovin' you is crazy
Crazy is what I'll be
Ohh, crazy, ohh crazy, ohh

Zodiac sign was a libra
Definitely a keeper, I just wanna put her in a sleeper then fall out underneath her
Wake up, take a shower, then get deeper
Juice up get some power and then freak her
After the feedback then I could G Mack

Kissing me is just history in the makin
Squeezing and hugging I need your loving, come on!

Whatchu doin' in here anyway? You oughta be home with your momma
How old are you boy? Thirteen
Thirteen? Damn, the bastards must be runnin' outta niggaz to arrest

Yeah, oh yeah, this goes out to all the families
That went through the struggle
Yeah, from the heart
It was from the heart, everything was real

All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through

Yo, dwellin' in the past, flashbacks when I was young
Whoever thought that I'd have a baby girl and three sons
I'm goin' through this difficult stage, I find it hard to believe
Why my old Earth had so many seeds

But she's an old woman and due to me, I respect that
I saw life for what it's really worth and took a step back
Family ain't family no more, we used to play ball
Eggs after school, eat grits 'cause we was poor

Grab the pliers for the channel, fix the hanger on the TV
Rockin' each others pants to school wasn't easy
We survived winters, snotty nosed with no coats
We kept it real, but the older brother still had jokes

Sadly, daddy left me at the age of six
I didn't know nuttin' but mommy neatly packed his shit
She cried, and grandma held the family down
I guess mommy wasn't strong enough, she just went down

Check it, fifteen of us in a three bedroom apartment
Roaches everywhere, cousins and aunts was there
Four in the bed, two at the foot, two at the head
I didn't like to sleep with Jon Jon, he peed the bed

Seven o'clock, pluckin' roaches out the cereal box
Some shared the same spoon, watchin' Saturday cartoons
Sugar water was our thing, every meal was no thrill
In the summer, free lunch held us down like steel

And there was days, I had to go to Tex house with a note
Stating, ""Gloria can I borrow some food I'm dead broke""
So embarrasin', I couldn't stand to knock on they door
My friends might be laughin', I spent stamps in stores

Mommy, where's the toilet paper, use the newspaper
Look Ms. Rose gave us a couch, she's the neighbor
Things was deep, my whole youth was sharper than cleats
Two brothers with muscular dystrophy, it killed me

But I remember this, mom's would lick her finger tips
To wipe the cold out my eye before school wit her spit
Case worker had her runnin' back to face to face
I caught a case, housin' tried to throw us out of our place

Sometimes I look up at the stars and analyze the sky
And ask myself was I meant to be here, why?
Yeah, yo

All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through

All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through

All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through

All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through

Word up mommy, I love you
Word up
It was all you, word, you brought me in like this

I sit and think about all the times we did without, yeah
I always said I wouldn't cry when I saw tears in your eyes
I understand that daddy's not here now
But some way or somehow, I will always be around, yeah

All things that I did from this to them
Oh, from drugs to being there
Being down and out and I love you always

Yeah, you say you see the universe
Which consists of the sun, moon and star
And them planets, that exist in my space
Like man woman and child, you understand?

We got to keep it real, and what reality
And reality will keep it real with us
I remember them good ol' days
Because see, that's the child I was

What made me the man I am today
See 'cause if you forget where you come from, heheh
You're never gonna make it where you're goin', aheh
Because you lost the reality of yourself

So, take one stroll through your mind
And see what you will find
And you'll see a whole universe all over again
And again and again and again and again

Fuck this old nigga whistlin' for?
Outside my door apartment 5B
While I learn to cook my first ounce of raw
Use to whistle while I work
She whistle while she twirk
Bitch bounce that ass while you roll that blunt it can't hurt
While you wet come out of that skirt
Bend over make it squirt
You can be my Superhead maybe we should try that first
Let me whistle while you jerk
Run my hand up ya shirt
If you wit it say you wit it let me hear my birdies chirp (we like it!)
Back shots make a bitch go berserk
The game will make it hurt
T-Pain know I'ma flirt (and we love it!)
Get ya ass up and fuck me then
I know you brought your girls
Girl fuck ya friends
Matter of fact I wanna fuck ya friends
Nah I ain't mean it like that, shit

Swags a standard
No less no more
If u have none
Let nezy know
Cause that's all they checkin' for
Flashin' paper
Player stop it
Swag is in you not in ya pocket
Try to buy
Ain't gone fly
Cause she want smooth
Gentleman life
She likes the way that everything
I do it so fresh and so clean
My tone is free no need to scream
Bounce like demeanor firmly

Can't be about C-notes
She know my pockets deep enough to see a deep throat
But she won't see a dividend like 3 times ?
And that's triple X rated you know
My bitches only want the weed some X and some blow
Know not ask for the keys or no extra dough
I give em dick no dough
She give me shit she go
All she got was a baby and a Game logo
That was then this is now
Lift it up break it down
I go in she come out
That's when the pussy make the sound
It will never be the same
Every time when you fuck wit Game

Like I ain't never ran from no pussy and I damn sure bout to pick a day to start runnin'

Banging Ne-Yo, my neck free yo,
My SOX hat,
Tilted to the side

Get my shine on.

I'm chasing money, she chasing me.
I'm right where I wanna be,
With the B on my Bentley,

Crown on my Cadillac,
Checks on my air max.
Haters, better fall back,
Before I put something in your ball cap.

Deep through the NYC off no sleep.
I hate to drive but I break it wide,

In that Maserati, see the paparazzi,

Shape of your eyes and your nose
The way you stare,
As if you see, right through to my soul

Its your left hand and the way
That its not quite as big as your right
The way you stand in the mirror,
Before we go out at night

A quiet time, your beautiful mind,
They're a part of the list
Things that I miss,
Things like your, funny little laugh
Or the way you smile or the way we kiss

What I noticed is this,
I come up with
Something new, every single time
That I sit an reminisce

The way you sweet smell
Lingers when you leave a room (you leave a room)
Stories you tell as we lay
In bed all afternoon (all afternoon)

I dreamed you now every night
In my mind is where we meet (in my mind is where we meet)
And when I'm awake

And touching your face, invading your space

Seem to only date the head of football teams

And I was the class clown that, always kept you laughing
We, were never meant to be baby we just happen
So please, don't mess up the trick, hey young world I'm the new slick rick
They say I move too quick, but we can't let the moment pass us

Let the hourglass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes
How could a goddess ask, someone that's only average

For advice
OMG, you listen to that bitch?
Whoa it's me
Baby this is tragic
'Cause we had it, we was magic

I was flying, now I'm crashing
This is bad, real bad, Michael Jackson
Now I'm mad, real mad, Joe Jackson
You should leave your boyfriend now, I'm a ask him

Say you gotta put the good with the bad, happy and the sad
So will u bring a better future than I had in the past
Oh 'cause, I don't wanna make the same mistakes I did
I don't wanna fall back on my face again
Whoa, whoa
I'll admit it, I was scared to answer love's call
Whoa, whoa
And if it hits better make it worth the fall

(When it comes around)

Sometimes love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down

Won't see it coming when it happens (hey)
But when it happens you're gonna feel it, let me tell you now
You see when love knocks you down

Ne-Yo,"Not again
Oh, this ain't supposed to happen to me

Keep rockin' and keep knockin'
Whether you Louboutin it up or Reebok'n
You see the hate that they servin' on a platter
So what we gonna have, dessert or disaster?

I never thought I'd be in love like this
When I look at you my mind goes on a trip
Then you came in and knocked me on my face
Feels like I'm in a race but I've already won first place

I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did
You got me thinkin' 'bout our life, a house and kids, yeah
Every morning I look at you and smile
'Cause boy, you came around and you knocked me down
Knocked me down

Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down

I never thought I'd hear myself say
Y'all go ahead, I think I'm gonna kick it with my girl today
I used to be commander in chief of my pimp ship flyin' high
'Til I met this pretty little missile, shot me out the sky

Hate to know I'm crashin', don't know how it happened
But I know it feels so damn good
Said if I could go back and make it happen faster
Don't you know I would baby, if could

Miss independent to the fullest
The load never too much, she helpin' me pull it
She shot the bullet that ended that life
I swear to you the pimp in me just died tonight, girl

Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down

Tell me now can you make it past your Caspers?
So we can finally fly off into NASA
You was always the cheerleader of my dreams
And seemed to only take the head of football teams

And I was the class clown that always kept you laughin'

I was watching honey peck it while she lay on tummy naked,
To the pace of the base and this cash money record,
She just drop, drop, drop, damn you manny fresh
But I got my thing together, told her she could bring whatever
Get some green, we could puff get the cream get the cuffs
Baby even when I'm gentle, it might seem like its ruff
But if neighbors ain't complaining, you ain't screaming enough
And yeah they might hear as I'm slappin' to the jewel

Yo Shawty is courageous,
Going through the stages,
Of where her body is more mature,
Than her age is,
Far from the daddy's little girl type,
Can't even imagine what her world's like,
It all started off as a youngin,
Stepfather used to touch her,
And she couldn't say nothing,
The more she held in the pain,
It kept coming,
Eventually it scarred her for life as a woman,
And then he just kept touching her,
Inside that was crushing her,
I got something to discuss with her,
I'm coming with the tech,
With the ear holes and the mufflers.

I'd keep it to myself cause all I wanna do is see you smile, 
Knowin' that you got someone to talk to ain't that what you want? 
I'll be your lover, your provider, and your confidant. 
And I won't judge you cause I know that ain't nobody perfect,
But you got some perfect imperfections that makes you worth it. 
I wanna see yo body in all the positions that you like it in, 
We could do it slow or have some drinks, it gets in enticing when,
You like it rough I give it rough and I start to pull your hair,
Cause ecstasy's your destination and I'ma take you there,
Tell me a secret baby

Tell me somethin' that nobody else knows, 
And think about it just as soon as the door close.

Tell me a secret baby.

And there ain't nobody in the universe that competes with you, 
Imagine all the possibilities and the freaky things that we could do. 
Blind folded,
Handcuffed to the head board never let you go until you scream my name, 
Maybe you think I'm playin' but this is really far from a mothafuckin' game. 
Ain't a damn thang changed still nasty as I wanna be. 
And I got just what you want baby girl you want it,
See it'll turn you on and it's gonna be on as soon as I take it off. 
Just give me your body its guaranteed that I'ma
Break you off, off, off, off, off until the sun rise,
And I'm not here to disappoint just give me one try. 
One kiss one pinch and you could take it or leave it,
But before you make up your mind just tell me one secret,
Ne-Yo holla at 'em.

And think about it just as soon as the door close.

So destructive in the way that we do
A little bit insane
But she loves it just the same
And me too

They say love and insanity
Are somewhat related
The way that they make us act
But baby girl the love between you and me, oh
Is truly the greatest
Though sometimes we hate it

They can't tell me nothing about no you
You're my
Crazy love
Can't tell me nothing about how we do
'Cause we got
Crazy love, oh yeah

I'm intelligent
I'm not stupid
Not at all, no, no, no
But my common sense
When it comes to you it falls
Then I do something dumb

They say love and insanity
Are somewhat related
In the way that they make us act
But baby girl the love between you and me
Is truly the greatest
Though sometimes we hate it

They can't tell me nothing about no you
You're my
Crazy love
Can't tell me nothing about how we do
You and me got
Crazy love, oh yeah

I walk into where you was at then my phone calls get a who is that
I told her that I worry that we won't last
She told me you need to worry when I don't ask
See that's the crazy love I be talking bout
Gary Coleman face girl what you talking bout
Make me wanna kick you and that yorkie out
Then I see that fat ass when you walking out
How I'm gonna tell my baby bye-bye
Outfit look crazy on her you my lady gaga
But you wanna start it first and get the last word
You wanna lock me down and get the password
Damn I wanna spray don't use juice
So in the bedroom I got a few screws loose
The head's coo-coo back-shots psycho
Hit it from the back hard hope you got Geico

I don't want much much baby egg whites
Keep your stomach and your thighs and your legs right

Wake up in the morning and I ain’t gone

Love a loyalty never cross the line
Just hit a nigga up when I cross your mind
Show you how to get your own, you won’t be watching mine
Put you up on Jee, show you how to shine
And maybe we can kick it when I got the time
Be my back bone every nigga need a spine
Gotta know you ride with me if I’m right or wrong
Case I wake up in the morning and it’s all gone
Best believe I’ma get it right back

Always talking about she gonna leave me
But she don’t
But maybe this time I’ll be different
Cause she shed so many tears
She’ll remind me all the dumb shit that I’ve done over the years

Never question mine, my mind is so inventive
Quadrupled my net worth and threw in a few incentives
Maybach IV the allure that I adore
All money game, we got ones in the floor
See me on the wood, nigga, pause at the game
Two mil, the jewels, no flaws, ask them lames

Started on the corner nigga, didn't have a coin

Never in the draft, but that boy know he going
Throw me a bone, get me a brick
That's on the Quran I'mma go and get the chips
Go and get a rental, I got a cute bitch

I'ma patch that ass I don't get paid

Double M life 'til a nigga pay the piper

Same way I love to see a key flip

That's another 100, what I got on my wrist
800 for the jar that I'm about to twist

Niggas get abused like boys at Penn State
Greatest that ever did it, decided my own fate

The life that we're living, baby it's ours

Baby that's a given, I'm talking about every fantasy
Be good real with me, still don't mean something, ooohhh, oh

Ne-Yo,"Ohh, After this song you gon' love me for my honesty, 
Or you gon hate me for being me yeah Im sayin'
One of the two is gon' happen but all that I can be is what I am and who I am

Chasing women when I should be recording
Invite a couple then I invite some more in
Next thing you know it's 3 in the morning and I've only done one song
20k on champagne in the club, then 20k more just because
That's 40k in three hours but everybody watching my section
So it's alright (Alright), I know it may sound silly to you 
Truthfully it silly to me too, but that's what makes this song so true
(Here's the truth)

I'm a little irresponsible most of the time
I'm a man of my word but only when I ain't lying
I say I'm not a hater but I hate to see you shine
Especially if your shine is outshining mine
I wanna be faithful but I keep running into dimes
And they make it so easy so it's hard to do right
The image I portray you making people judge a book
But if they really took the time to look
Then they would see the cracks in Mr. Perfect (Yeah)
They would see the cracks in Mr. Perfect (Yeah, yeah)
So they would see the cracks in Mr. Perfect (Yeah)
Ooh, they would see the cracks in Mr. Perfect (Yeah)

I ain't got a condom here, oh no (Oh, no)
And too lazy to run to the store (Man it's cold outside)
But you just met her three hours ago, says the angel on my shoulder
But the devil he can talk real loud (Yeah)
And my on decision I'm not proud (No)
But by the grace of God I'm here right now  
Healthy and getting older
So it's alright (Alright eh), I know it may sound reckless to you (Yeah man)
Truthfully it's reckless to me too,(Yeah man)
 but that's what makes this song so true
(Here's the truth)

I'm a little irresponsible most of the time
I'm a man of my word but only when I ain't lying
I say I'm not a hater but I hate to see you shine
Especially if your shine is outshining mine
I wanna be faithful but I keep running into dimes
And they make it so easy so it's hard to do right
The image I portray you making people judge a book
But if they really took the time to look
Then they would see the cracks in Mr. Perfect (Yeah)
They would see the cracks in Mr. Perfect (Yeah, yeah)

Oh ah, I do a lot of stupid shit
Hoping I never have to pay for it
It's like I've become more of an idiot
With every extra million I get
I thank God for my family and my crew 'cause I can be a lot to put up with
Much love to the people that don't mind the cracks in Mr. Perfect, yeah, yeah
(Now let it marinate)

Think about that

oh , they could see the cracks in Mr. Perfect yeah
Ooh you can see the cracks in Mr. Perfect yeah yeah  
You could see the cracks in Mr. Perfect uhh
Said you could see the cracks in Mr. Perfect yeah yeah
yea yeah yea

And in the end they all learned a valuable lesson
Perfection, it's just glorified opinion
When in the grand scheme of things 
It's our imperfections that truly make us perfect

On me to buy you a bag, but is you worthy?
Nah, I ain't perfect!
And I just followed you on Instagram
Are you really into women and that you get around?
Now I ain't judging, I'm just asking if that's fair to say
But either way, it's my opinion, you know give or take!
I told this model chick,
The girls look up to you and the things you do
Every nigga you work with, you're screwing,
So you know she will love you, you know she don't do it, she like

Like this she real, but it is what it is

I know your worth, I know that purse

Do you wanna get out of this?
Would you feel disrespected
If I said you fat as shit?
Wow, if I called you my bitch
When I'm with my partners eating?
As a badge of honor or just be like no Wale
Don't call me out at my momma's given.
Name sacred, she whispers mine when I'm in her thighs
And I leave her inner feelings, cause I never leave her dry!
Some ill advice, lying to her is ill advised
She know these Jones on my John, but I still give her time.
I try follow her, everybody want her
Worried about none if she gonna work that body!

I'm still caught up, call her thirst trap shawty

But she wants to be treated like somebody's wife.

We all lose sometimes, I call it paying dues

And I’m gonna treat her like a queen
But can’t afford the crown, though she turn me down
A million dollar home, don’t feel the same when you know a low
I really wanna show her so much more than dough
But the girl won’t put me on yea

Licking them lips, swinging them hips as she walk your way

Better run, run for your life
You better run, run for your life

Hips movin' yo ass pokin', your neck breaking
Dress stretching, eyes sparkling, you a breath taker
Heart stopper, need a chart topper
Groovy Q meets Big Pimpin'
St. Laurent for your Spring clothes
Red bottoms, you need those
All the things I do for you, oh
Got a private jet for two, oh
Yeah we taking off or we can land in Rome
Put a wet one out the roof
All the things I do for you
How these pearls come out the roof
God built you like a temple
How your body drive me schizo

'Cause I'mma get loose tonight

I'm no liar, she burn up the spot
Look like Mariah, I took another shot
Told her drop, drop, drop, drop it like it's hot
Dirty talk, dirty dance
She a freaky girl and I'm a freaky man
She on the rebound, broke up with her ex
And I'm like Rodman, ready on deck
I told her I wanna ride out, and she said yes
We didn't go to church, but I got blessed

You know you got the biggest booty in this spot
And I just wanna see that thing drop

Always like a squirrel, looking for a nut
This isn't for show I'm not talking 'bout luck
I'm not talking 'bout love, I'm talking 'bout lust
Now let's get loose, have some fun
Forget about bills and the first of the month
It's my night, your night, our night, let's turn it up

So I'm chillin'
But I must admit, I'm kind of mad

And she wasn't ever approving of that
She wanted me to give her more

A relationship, I wasn't lookin' for
In and out of town and always on the road
But when I hit that city I called her though
And that's wrong, so wrong
She waited for me to come around so long, so long
And now that wifey material is wifey material
And if you ain't ready, the wife gotta let it go
I wasn't, he was though

She even went as far to give me her Twitter name
She said, ""I tweeted you and told you the same thing""

Ne-Yo,"(I asked you a question)
I feel a rise burning in the back of my head
If she could kill me with a look, I'd already be dead
Excited at the thought of possibly two in my bed
I said some shit that I instantly regretted I said
I hid my deception with absolute discretion
Wanted to turn around and give up an accidental confession
I turned to look at her and she's just standin' there
Facial expression says it all, war has been declared

She said, is there anything you wanna tell me?
I'm standin' there with my head down and I'm thinkin'
Oh no, here we go
What the hell was I thinkin'? Man I wish I was drinkin'
So I could blame it on the liquor, why did I paint the picture?
Why did I think it was something that she would even consider?
Now I'm avoidin' eye contact as if I owe her money
Tryna laugh it off, clearly she don't think it's funny

And then she stepped to me, comin' so steady
Looked at me like she knew already
I betrayed her trust, it weighs heavy
On my head, and then she said
Why can't I be loved?
Why can't I feel love?
Why am I not worthy of
Oh why can't I feel love?

All she wanted was somethin' real, somethin' true
With tears in her eyes she said, ""I believed in you""
I said, ""Please don't leave, please don't go away""
She said, ""You broke my heart, how could I stay?""

Remember back in high school
We were drunk 'most every day

Drink down by the reservoir
Drive through town and drank some more
'Til we took out Miss Young's front porch
In my old Chevrolet

You thought you were a rich boy
In that big house on the hill
Where we drank your daddy's whiskey
And stole your mama's pills

We were young and stupid
In that summer of eighty-four
Come fall, I left with half my mind
For college up in Baltimore

Tonight we're just two boys from Creagerstown
Come this time tomorrow you will lay your burdens down

State's attorney has a witness and overwhelming evidence
And I just stood there staring, you know I could not put it down
Right there on the front page was a boy from my home town

Tonight we're just two boys from Creagerstown
Come this time tomorrow you will lay your burdens down
Tonight we're just two boys from Creagerstown

All silver bells, coral shells, carousels

Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

Neal Haiduck,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Ev'ry day was a cloudy day for me
Then good luck came a-knocking at my door

Smiling at me
Nothing but blue skies
Do I see

Bluebirds
Singing a song

All day long

Never saw the sun shining so bright
Never saw things going so right
Noticing the days hurrying by
When you're in love, my how they fly

All of them gone
Nothing but blue skies
From now on

Won't dish the dirt, with the rest of the girls

I go to ballgames, the bleachers are fine
I follow Winchell, and read every line

Every lover's in a trance

Every couple's got a bench kissing shamelessly

While they're making love in French

Make a true Parisian shrink
Wine is all he'll ever drink

And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly

Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

Met a girl with a drink in her hand. 
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair 
And eyes that would tempt any man.
Then she came and sat down at my table,
And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her 
For temptation was flowing like wine.
 
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""
""Take me away from here and be my man.""
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:
 
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.

Shining through the mist
Cause after all a kiss is just a kiss or so I thought
But I must have been wrong

It could have the music
Cause it sounded so sweet 
Something sure was sweeping me
Off my feet

All night long, it sure was strong
Before  I knew what was going on
I was going, going, gone

I suppose it could have been the perfume
From a honeysuckle vine
Something sure was driving me 
Out of my mind

But I should have known all alone 
It was your love and it was strong
And now I'm goin', going, gone

It might have been the magic 
Written in the stars
Some gypsy might have read it
Somewhere in the cards

It really doesn't matter
Cause whatever it was
It led me straight to your arms

Tunes up and the window down
On the skyline drive when she flagged me over

Were the first words that she said
Her eyes were blue as the sky on a perfect blue ridge day
She said, ?I could use a lift if you're going my way?, and

I was, I was headed south, I was headed out
Headed nowhere or anywhere we wanted to go
The road stretched out in front of us
And she was ready to run it just like I was

Told me she was twenty-two
And she'd just broken out of William and Mary
Another summer under Daddy's roof that was all that she could do
Her boyfriend, she cut him loose
Too cold for a wedding in January
She said, ?That's enough about me now tell me about you?
I rambled on about broken hearts and staying too long
She said, ?I'm sorry, but you were right to move on?, and 

I was, I was headed south, I was headed out
Headed nowhere or anywhere we wanted to go

A simple little song that can bring me back to when they

Sang up on the roof
And underneath the boardwalk when they'd go
Dancin' in the streets
Boogaloon' down on Broadway hey when
Lovers used to slow dance all night long
And they knew the words to every song

There's got to be somebody somewhere
Singin' some new old songs

Like Otis Redding ""Sittin' On The Dock""
Or Bill Haley's ""Rock Around The Clock""
When Buddy Holly loved sweet Peggy Sue
True love ways were all they knew
There's somethin' 'bout happiness heartbreak and hurt
That leaves me hangin on every word back when they

Sang up on the roof
And underneath the boardwalk when they'd go
Dancin' in the streets
Boogaloon' down on Broadway hey when
Lovers used to slow dance all night long
And they knew the words to every song

Now that radio's on and I'm stayin' up
Please dedicate it to the one I love like it was when they

Sang up on the roof
And underneath the boardwalk when they'd go
Dancin' in the streets
Boogaloon' down on Broadway hey when
Lovers used to slow dance all night long
And they knew the words to every song

There's got to be somebody somewhere
Singin' some new old songs
Just like in the fifties
High on a mountain of love
In the midnight hour
Oh knock on wood
Kiss an angle good morning
Your cheatin' heart

Neal McCoy,"What started out as small talk
On a bus stop bench before work
Turned into the greatest love story
I've ever heard
She said D's not the kind to send roses
Can't afford diamonds and pearls
When it comes to lifting my spirits
He's the strongest man in the world

[Chorus]
She said he stops my tears before they start
He can be so tender and still be tough
With his crocked smile melt my heart
Fill an empty room with love if anybody can
Cause he's the strongest man in the world

She said he's always leaving love notes
On the refrigerator door
And I leave him surprises in his lunch box
To even up the score
I was thinking what I'd give to be with
Such a wonderful girl
But I know I couldn't compete with
The strongest man in the world

Get home about a half past three

For my life has changed and I'm sure rearranged
You've made me everything I wanna be

Ah, she makes me happy, every minute I'm alive
I don't need Dr. Ruth to figure out the truth
This feeling just can't be denied
I love her, 24-7-365

I'm gonna quit watching my TV
Gonna throw my golf clubs away
No more shooting pool, acting a fool
And party 'til the break of day

'Cause she's the only thing in the whole wide world
That ever made me feel this fine
Oh, and anything that takes me away from her
Is nothing but a waste of my time

Every second each day til' I'm old a gray
This fascination will survive

Ah, it's my life at stake
And it's time for me to make
A change is long overdue
I don't need no resume, I threw it all away
I'm gonna do what I was born to do

It was me on the other end

That ran between her little heart and mine

Operator, do you think we can give it one more try
I'm not sure the first time we got the number right
And this time when you tell her my name, would you tell her I'm sorry too

My every dream was to just grow up and go
Like a siren song those bright lights called my name
So I turned that country road into memory lane

Well I hit that fast lane it was paved with gold
But it wasn't long till my highbrow ways got old
I started missing things that I thought I'd left behind
Till I found two swinging doors 'neath the neon sign

They were whirling and a twirling to the fiddles and a steel guitar
Them city folk was drinking from Mason jars
I think I found what paradise might be

Just go on home and slip on them cowboy boots
Now it's the best of both worlds all I'll ever need

Surrounded by a mess of corn rows.

Staring at the empty page before me
All the years of wreckage run through my head
Patterns of my live have thawed and torn me
Revealing hurtful shame and deep lament
Overwhelming sorrow now absorbs me
As the pen begins to trace my darkest past
Signs throughout my life that should have warned me
Of all the wrongs I've done for which I must repent

I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done, then haven't

Sometimes you've got to be wrong
Learn the hard way
Sometimes you've got to be strong
When you think it's too late

Staring at the finished page before me
All the damage now so clear and evident
Thinking 'bout the dreaded task in store for me
A bitter fear at the thought of my amends
Hoping that the step will help restore me
To face my past and ask for forgiveness
Cleaning up my dirty side of this un-swept street
Could this be the beginning of the end?

I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done, then haven't

Sometimes you've got to be wrong
Learn the hard way
Just when you're through hanging on
You're saved

If we are painstaking about this phase of our development
We will be amazed before we are halfway through.
We are going to know a new freedom and a new happiness.
We will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it.
We will comprehend the word serenity, and we will know peace
No matter how far down the scale we have gone.
We will see how our experience can benefit others.
That feeling of uselessness and self-pity will disappear.
We will lose interest in selfish things and gain interest in our fellows.
Self-seeking will slip away.
Our whole attitude and outlook upon life will change.
Fear of people and economic insecurity will leave us.
We will intuitively know how to handle situations which used to baffle us.
We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us what we could not do for ourselves.
Are these extravagant promises? We think not.
They have been fulfilled amongst others
Sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly.
We will always be true to our principles.

But the truth shall set you free.

That a hero lies in you

But don't let anyone
Tear them away
Hold on
There will be tomorrow
In time
You'll find the way

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive

Look inside you and be strong

A shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her,
Looked around good and from expectations,
So he decided he'd head for the subway stations,
But she was coming and he made a left,
He was runnin' top speed till he was outta breath,
Knocked an old man down and swore he killed him,
Then he made his move to an abandoned building,
Ran up the stairs up to the top floor,
Opened up the door there, guess who he saw?,
Dave the dope fiend shootin' dope,
Who don't know the meaning of water nor soap,
He said ""I need bullets, hurry up, run!""
The dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun,
He went outside but there was cops all over,
Then he dipped into a car, a stolen Nova,
Raced up the block doing 83,
Crashed into a tree near a university,
Escaped alive though the car was battered,
Rat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered,
Ran out of bullets and still had static,
Grabbed a pregnant lady, got out the automatic,
Pointed at her head and he said the gun was full o' lead,
He told the cops ""Back off or honey here's dead"",
Deep in his heart he knew he was wrong,
So he let the lady go and he starts to run on,
Sirens sounded, he seemed astounded,
Before long the little boy got surrounded,
He dropped the gun, so went the glory,
And this is the way I must end this story,
He was only seventeen, in a madman's dream,
The cops shot the kid, I still hear him scream,
This ain't funny so don't ya dare laugh,
Just another case 'bout the wrong path,
Straight 'n narrow or your soul gets cast.",Children's Story,1996

Lose your inhibitions

Like ghosts from another time

In the shape of the blackest birds they once ruled the battlefields
Screaming for courage, screaming for vengeance, reaping the souls of the fallen
And all enemies would flee in fear at the sight of the grim war sisters

I keep straining my ears to hear a sound
Maybe someone is digging underground
Or have they...

Yo man motherfuckers are clowns man; Hip-hop's too nice
It's too pretty
What are you gonna do to it Necro?
Take a razor, and slice it!

[Necro]
Yo, peep this shit like this
Kill the head, kill the body, and knows who I'ma ruin
When I float like a dead body and sting like peroxide on wounds
I'm rollin a fatty like death is comin believe it
Recognize the chain of command I deliver the pain you're receivin
Brain washing has officially begun
Kid you peep a psycho holdin a butcher knife dancin like Re-Run
It's rainin, as God pisses on earth
I drop bile like a vagina dismisses at birth
Devour my shower that's golden
I'm puffing the sacks, rolled in
smoldered flesh, holding the fresh, cancer-infested colon
How can I make my point to you fools?
I'll drop a dead A&R off a roof
and on his chest it'll say, ""Necro rules!""
I'm above the constitution
My shit stays bubblin like burnt flesh
My rhymes are acid in Clorox solution
Your eyes will burn once the acid hits
You'll be blinded like Rosie O'Donnell
jumped up ten feet in the air and flashed her tits
Life is shady G in 1976 my parents created me
I've been flippin since 1983
I always took pain as a game
When I was six I cracked my head open
and looked in the mirror to see my brain
Wonder why I'm like an icicle?
At five I was hit by a car ridin my tricycle, a hit and run son
Mad young in the hospital receivin stitches made me vicious
Peeping cretons with Mephisto in their eyes made me suspicious
Runnin through Glenwood PJ's, as a young buck
I didn't dance that fresh, I burnt ants to death
Taste me you will see more is all you need
Dedicated to how I'm killin you!
You're unhealthy you're a felon P.O. checks your bladder
You're an addict; if you beat me I'll deliver you death on a platter
The customer's always right but this time the customer's left
on a stretcher gaspin for breath
The cipher flows like rolly polly, kill yourself slowly
Plus you're already dead if you're homely
So bitch, there's a little red dot on your skull, so pray
Most of New York's population is filled with mental patients
pretendin to be normal, pretendin to be mental patients
Gotthem got rapists by the pile
Watch out for goons of vile infested smiles
and dreams of molestin your child
You gotta pack a black, glock, with, the,
extra clip when shit gets thick
You gotta punch a kid, dead, in the, nose, 
if he ever tries to front and diss
You need to puff a bag, of, dro's, when,
listening to brutal shit like this
You gotta rock a lamb, skin, with, the, 
spermicide for a nasty bitch
Make sure your girl's syphillis clean
before I slide my tongue up in her
Don't you darrrrrre ruin my dinner!
My ventriloquism hits you like ism
Sprayed with raid mixed with pissim mixed blades butchery sadism
I rip your gat, when I twist my wrists
1 finger, 2 finger, 3 fingers, 4 fingers fuck it the whole fifth
Ran up your wife's ass gets murdered type fast
Blast scum up on your BC mask and dirty flash pipes flash
Call, plumbing we're coming inside like sluts like Kimberly Drummond
You know the steez, I slay my prey, day by day
Kill yourself, on some euthanasia shit
Rockin Timb's with razors on the tip
Today's the day to flip on a decapitation tip
I'm fascinated with, leavin you lacerated split
on point like an assassination hit your knot
Some one to have patience with, I'm better off lettin off
two clips at you face set it off to decide who's better off deaded off
Inject 'til you feel correct, feel the effects of my hex
Force you to have sex with techs, chopped at funeral next
Buy my poison I got triple six in my beeper
I talk to myself cause giving my own self therapy's cheaper
The violence hits you like a spliff filled with some holy pot
Penetrate your skull like an obituary riff from ""Slowly We Rot""
You'll soon be fractions and numerator
of a denominator when I play dominator
When you're dead your brain's enbalmed with data
Peepin Vietnam through Vader, futuristic butcher CD-ROM cremator
Your - spine cracks in 3-D like Imax
You won't be Superman no more feel the pain climax
No anesthesia, even if the doctor takes some codine and combines crack
that's fine packed and mixed with phenobarbital liquid
and a Raid sprayed dime sack, nuttin numbs your future sums
I threw you in a wheel chair you're a crumb
A pebble, a worm, a snail
I'll be a mental patient with a red afro on thorazine when you inhale
Uhhhhh, uhhhhhhm uhhhhhh, another blunt filled with dust
And another blunt filled, and another blunt filled
And another blunt filled with dust
Last week someone tried to put me in a coffin
That's the second time a nigga tried to kill me
I'm starting to feel important
For some cats smilin ain't their style
But there's something so evil about seeing a murderous smile it's vile
Gore is a tattoo on your mind, suicide's a laxative
It'll eat you up inside like you swallowed maggots by accident
I main..line to main-tain
I'm fightin the biggest fight of my life
You gotta pack a black, glock, with, the,

Forget blastin your gut make sure your casket is shut

Yo I'm hungry for your flesh like I ain't eaten in months
Out to get with my axe and let it drag on your tan line
Put hands in the box and stab the handle with cat signs
I'll be in disguise ready to stick you with knives
And leave your arms gross like Forrest Whitekers eyes
Are you ready to die by this machette of mine?
It takes just one strive for your head to divide
Fuckin bludgeoned all night by my games of death
The cops'll struggle to find where your remains are left
They're underneath the weeds rotting in a gentle breeze
Chillin with the flies beetles and the centipedes
A distant memory your existence is gone
You're on your way to the gates where you'll be visiting God

It be the Children of Corn style the killa with sword I'll
Unleash a plague of bees upon a billion a sworn pile
Desolate drug supply the strength of my hug
But when I catch you you're strung up by the flesh of their tongues
Start avengin the script you'll be eventually ripped
Tossed in pendulum pits until you stench of the crip
You'll be hunted for days by thug with guns and grenades
Fuckin punchin your face until you're sunk in the grave
Blades are stuck in your brain laced and stuck in the lake
You should've ducked when I sprayed son you're a fuckin disgrace
Dirty legions on your grill plus excretions will be spilled
Gory missions will be filled must relieve before you're killed
My sinister inside drugged with hundreds of pills
It's a minister midnight better run to the hills
I'm leavin you diseased burning bullets get released
Earth is sure to hear you screech like guitars of Judas Priest
Next step you're check mated your vest is invaded
The hollow tip shells your chest is separated
Your caught up in a mess of tortured long death
From the depth more or less a corpse with torn flesh

",The Sick Room,2003
Necrophagia,"Fingers from the crypt
Attached to friendish eyes
Rising from below
Regurgitated from beyond

It's name-spoken
Upon frayed lips of silence

Twisted into form
By the hands of death
Strangled from within
By an unseen force

Inhuman strength
Breathing poison fires
Into rotten souls
Of the dying





",Upon Frayed Lips of Silence,2003
Necrophagia,"Spits in the face of god
Cast an inverted shadow
Bloodshot eyes
(Talons of) deprovation adorn


Dead as night
Ze Do Caixao
Unholy desires

A torture garden
Inside his soul
In his quest for destiny
His ways are sadistic
Womb of innocence
Defiled with his seed
A bloodline of blasphemySpawning a superior race

Your deficiencies

who are skilful to rouse Leviathan""

Cursed one, son of darkness
Hear the call beyond the gate
Open the book of human flesh
The daemons on the other side awaits
Summon the evil forces of the seven lords
Secret seal before your eyes
Call forth the evil gods

Hear the prayers
Master of spells pass through the gate
Bring the world tremendous evil
Realm of chaos awaits
Lords of desolation
See the revelations across the blackened sky
Break the curse

Reveal the concealed forces of the astral lords
Master - hear the eternal cries
From the dwelling daemons at the other side",The Ancients Gate,1994
Necrophobic,"My prayers have been answered
I'm no longer a victim of God
I died for the right master
The one that I will serve
They'll believe my soul is resting
But how can they be so wrong
This is where life begins
Where it will be everlasting
As a reincarnated soul
I'm rising in this unholy kingdom
A paradise made for the immortals
Where your corpse shall be our feast
Underneath the blackened ground
An unholy ritual is soon to begin
Gathering for a black mass
As I speak the words of Satan

[Chorus]
As darkness falls
Spirits are set free
As darkness fall
Awakening of the dead

From the chalice filled with blood
We drink and increase the immortal power
United in a dance of death
To cause damnation against the false
As you call upon your fake God
Devastation is filling the air
Rising trough the gates of hell
Retaliation of the evil ones

Necrophobic,"At dawn the prophecies were told
Demonic spells surrounded the moon
Infernal flames enlightened the altar
Where the lord awaited the human sacrifice

Before the dawn of time
The devil was cursed from heaven
Condemned to the abyss of hell
Satan seeks for the merciless revenge

In the shadows of the damned
The priest speaks the incantation
A sacrifice to the lord
Shall be made of human blood and flesh

Awaiting at the altar of death
The priest prepares for the dying

Necrophobic,"Engraved on the altar
The name was written in blood
The sign of Lucifer's child
Creation of the unborn son
With inhuman force of evil

Damnation awaits for the sinner
Trapped in a spell of no return
See the flames unholy
With disgrace in your soul you shall forever burn

Necrophobic,"Born in the hands of the church
Nailed to the cross forever
Insanity of denominations
Trapped in a spell of evil

Father, give me the power
To enter the gate of time
The passage of burned and crucified souls
I must pass before I die

Peace in my mind will never be found
Betrayed by life, servant of suicide
Born to earth with visions of hate
Evil spells surrounding me
No escape from ones fate

Countless predictions of lies
The dying enter heaven
You must invoke the lord
So you shall be forgiven

Receive the merciful blessing
Confess your sins to God
By the gracious name of Christ
No mercy for those who are evil

Insanity has soon taken over me
Hypocrisy, to die is my destiny
Sacrifice, soon I shall rest in peace
No escape from the gates of immortality

Necrophobic,"Gaze at the twilight in the blood red sky
The evil gods are rising
Shadows revealed by the darkened moon
Behold the diabolical signs

Nocturnal souls gathered through time
Preparing the unholy right
Seeds of blasphemies on the hallowed ground
Awaiting for the masters arrival

A freezing silence descends in the night
Cold winds whisper damnation
Deathlike shadows rising on the ground
The call of the lord of creation

Evil waits in the realm beyond the sky
As tears of blood fall down
Lords of lords, in a time before time
Are rising from the nocturnal silence

Ancient lords of dreadful evil
Enter through the seven gates

Rising cross the bleeding sky

In the fires without return
No god shall ever live
No lies shall ever be told

And turn the crucifx upside down
Burn the corpse of Jehova
In the flames of hell it shall be done
Devour the holy Messiah
Consume the forgotten son

As it was foretold",Where Sinners Burn,1994
