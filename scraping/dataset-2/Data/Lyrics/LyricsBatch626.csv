Louis Dean Nunley,"We don't eat in no white restaurants
We're eating in a car
Baloney again, baloney again
We don't sleep in no white hotel bed
We're sleeping in a car, baloney again
You don't strut around in these country towns
You best stay in the car
Look on ahead don't stare around
You best stay where you are
You're a long way from home, boy
Don't push your luck too far
Baloney again

Twenty-two years we've sung the word
Since nineteen thirty-one
Amen, I say amen
Now the young folk want to praise the Lord
With guitar, bass and drums, amen
Well I'll never get tired of Jesus
But it's been a heavy load
Carrying His precious love
Down a long dirt road
We're a long way from home
Just let's pay the man and go 
Baloney again

The Lord is my sheperd
He leadeth me in pastures green
He gave us this day
Our daily bread and gasoline
Go under the willow
Park her up beside the stream
Shoulders for pillows
Lay down your head and dream
Shoulders for pillows
Lay down your head and dream",Baloney Again,2000
Louis Delort,"Je sais bien que tout nous sépare
Je sais qu'il faudrait s'enfuir
Mais je n'irai plus nul part
Sans vouloir lui revenir
Sans vouloir nous retenir

Mais d'où vient le feu qui s'empare
De mon âme, ma moitié ivre
Soudain pour un simple regard
Je veux vivre au bord du vide 
Je veux vivre au bord du vide

Pour tomber dans ses yeux
Tomber, m'abandonner au désir
Qui s'embrase
Danser, dans ses yeux
Danser
Je veux tanguer aux accents de l'extase

Avant que la vie nous sépare
Avant que la vie vacille
Je veux succomber sans égard
Et valser au bord du vide
Et valser au bord du vide

Pour tomber dans ses yeux
Tomber, m'abandonner au désir
Qui s'embrase
Danser, dans ses yeux
Danser
Je veux tanguer aux accents de l'extase

Pour tomber dans ses yeux
Tomber, m'abandonner au désir
Qui s'embrase
Danser, dans ses yeux
Danser
Je veux tanguer aux accents de l'extase

Tomber de ses yeux
Tomber comme une larme
A la fin de l'histoire.",Tomber Dans Ses Yeux,2012
Louis Durra,"Every honey bee fills with jealousy
When they see you out with me

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

When you're passin' by flowers droop and sigh,
And I know the reason why

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

Don't buy sugar
You just have to touch my cup
You're my sugar
It's sweeter when you stir it up

When I'm taking sips from your tasty lips
Seems the honey fairly drips

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose",Honeysuckle Rose,2008
Louis Durra,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,2008
Louis Edmonds,"This is hard to say, but as I wandered through the lea
I felt for just a fleeting moment that I was suddenly free of being lonely;
Then I closed my eyes and saw the very reason why.
I saw a man with his head bowed low
His heard had no place to go,
I looked and I thought to myself with a sigh:
There but for you go I.
I saw a man walking by the sea
Alone with the tide was he,
I looked and I thought as I watched him go by:
There but for you go I.
Lonely men around me trying not to cry;
Till the day you found me, there among them was I.
I saw a man who had never known a love that was all his own.
I thought as I thanked all the stars in the sky:
There but for you go I.
I saw a man with his head bowed low
His heard had no place to go,
I looked and I thought to myself with a sigh:
There but for you go I.
I saw a man walking by the sea
Alone with the tide was he,
I looked and I thought as I watched him go by:
There but for you go I.
Lonely men around me trying not to cry;
Till the day you found me, there among them was I.
I saw a man who had never known a love that was all his own.
I thought as I thanked all the stars in the sky:
There but for you go I.
",There But for You Go I,1996
Louis Edmonds,"I want to see your face in every kind of light
In fields of dawn and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

I want to see your face in every kind of light
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes
In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two

Through all of my life
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you
",What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?,1996
Louis Ford,"Well I am a rambling kid, I've been rambling all of my days 
Yes, I am a rambling kid, I've been rambling all of my days 
Well, you know my baby she want me to stop rambling, so she says she'll change her ways 

Well, now it ain't no use to you rambling, when your baby don't want you to ramble around 
Yes, now it ain't no use to you rambling, when your baby don't want you to ramble around 
Well keep on rambling, she be done drove on out of this town 

Now I ain't gonna ramble, babe, I ain't gonna ramble no more

Well, now, I'm leaving, I'm leaving baby, no I ain't gonna ramble no more 
Lord, I'm leaving, I'm leaving baby, no I ain't gonna ramble no more 
Well, you know I have been rambling around here, lose a woman everywhere I go",Ramblin' Kid Blues,2000
Louis Gallaud,"Where's that tiger! Where's that tiger!
Where's that tiger! Where's that tiger!
Hold that tiger! Hold that tiger ! Hold that tiger!

Louis Garcia & His Swing Band,"There is no greater love
Than what I feel for you
No greater love,
No heart so true

There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song
Than what you sing to me

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you

Louis Gasté,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues,1996

Louis Gordon,"She was dressed in a white suit
She looked like a bride too

[Chorus]
It's a burning car
It's a burning car

Then I looked at the sunset
And it felt like a stage set

(Chorus)

Alright

I remembered the time and place

And I breathed in the night perfume
As we met in the dark room

Alright",Burning Car,2002
Louis Gordon,"When she walks out she's illuminous
When she turns 'round she is someone else
And I can't fight
Can't find the rule or the exception

She moves towards me endlessly
Endlessly...
Endlessly...

Turns her face into music...
Into fog...
Voice behind me
Says ""go on""
So I go on towards her endlessly
Endlessly...
Endlessly... 
 
Switch the scene
Sun is rising
Summer trees
Someone smiling
She moves towards me endlessly
Endlessly...
Endlessly...

She walks out she's illuminous",Endlessly,2002
Louis Gordon,"All the kisses taste of dust here
And it's too late to change my mind
I'm still in love with the private world
Sometimes I've got to pull the blinds
Why aren't you dissolving yet?
And why's that car always there?
I got a letter from America
Somebody else lost in the glare
In this city, this city, oh
In this city, this city, oh
I'm walking through this big arena
I'm passing millions, missing some
When someone touches me like a sudden light
I think it's memory but it's still so bright 
There were always dreams of leaving
My face gets dimmer every day
When I can see myself I'm waving
I'm going back into the crowds again
In this city, this city, oh
In this city, this city, oh
In this city, this city, oh
This city, this city, oh",This City,2002
Louis Gordon,"Once in a while
She comes through the walls of my apartment
And once in while she says:
""Come on let's blow it all""

She's amnesia
She's walking out in shattered times
She's a movement
She's a motion
She's moves like smoke before my eyes

Once in a while
I feel somebody move beneath my skin
And once in while I feel that smile
She says: ""Come on, let's begin""

She's amnesia
She's walking out in shattered times
She's a movement
She's a motion
I let that smoke get in my eyes

Once in a while

Once in a while
I turn a corner and I feel that
Once in a while
I take a break from everybody's expectations

She's a motion
You know how smoke gets in your eyes",Once in a While,2003
Louis Gordon,"Oh do you get the smell of burning metal?
Can you feel that heartbeat under the sea?
Well it's just me and Oppenheimer waltzing
With crowded streets in chromakey

And all the glow boys in their lipstick and shadows
And gold leaf on their delicate skins
Well they can filter through your curtains like nerve-gas
They leave their laughter on the wind

And we're dancing
Yes we're dancing
We're dancing like a gun

Nothing I can see looks like an exit
So I'm making you into a door
You've been a guaranteed constant companion for so long
I'll almost miss you when I go

And there's silence in your silver passing
And stardust scattered over your breasts
Then I looked around and found
All the faces of the world
As the ballroom floor gets fused to glass 
 
And we're dancing
Yes we're dancing
We're dancing like a gun

We'll walk in the silent places
In the wake of the storms
Swim through our own cathedral
Trailing the dawn...

Dresses of light and ashes
Proud in display
Lovers and enemies
All waltzing in the waves...

Oh we're dancing
Yes we're dancing
We're dancing like a gun

Like a gun",Dancing Like a Gun,2010
Louis Gordon,"It's time to walk again
It's time to make our way
Through the fountain squares
And the collonades

Your dress is shimmering
Your voice is hiding things
When you say
I've hardly changed

In Europe
After the rain
When the nights are warm
And the summer sways...

The stained glass echoing
The blossom balconies
And voices blow
On a shining wind 
 
Your face is shimmering
Your smile is glimmering
When I say
You've hardly changed

In Europe
After the rain
When the nights are warm
And the summer sways...

In Europe after the rain
In Europe after the rain
In Europe after the rain
In Europe after the rain",Europe After the Rain,2010
Louis Gordon,"Miles away
I'm walking in like someone else again
Miles away
I'm watching summer through an English rain

And I'm a new man when I walk away
It's crazy
Shaking the daze from my head again
I know I must be miles away

Miles away
Miles away
Miles away

Miles away
I reassemble on the morning train
I try to say
My voice just tumbles on a long delay

And there's a new man at the edge of me
It's crazy
Making new plans for the rest of me
I'm looking back from miles away

Miles away
Miles away
Miles away

All the same
We talk on telephones across the haze
Miles away
The planes go glinting on their vapour trails

And I'm a new man when I walk away
It's crazy
Turning my head to the shine again
I'm waking up from miles away

Miles away
Miles away
Miles away",Miles Away,2010
Louis Hayes,"I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stood still

My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew
That unfelt clasp of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still

I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stopped right there

My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken

That unfelt claps of hands

I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still",My Heart Stood Still,1960
Louis Hayes,"Missed the Saturday dance
Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore
 
Though I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore
 
Darling, I guess my mind's more at ease
But nevertheless why stir up memories?
 
Been invited on dates
Might have gone but what for?
Awf'lly diff'rent without you
Don't get around much anymore",Don't Get Around Much Anymore,1982
Louis Hayes,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now,1989
Louis Hayes,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song is You,2000
Louis Hayes,"She's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I","Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered",2001
Louis Hayes,"Here we are trying to mend all the broken hearts
In a world where the pain is the fear

Shine your heart to the universe and get the news
Not alone never have been, never will be
See the truth, not to mention the promise made
See them all, see them all high on judar rhythm

We began at the very first spring
How the promise will come when the promise is made
We will sing at the very first spring
That the promise will come when the promise is made
Promise is made, promise is made

Shake me up, take me up

Lift me up, shake me up

Louis Hayes,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony

My love is a prelude that never dies

Louis Hayes,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street
 
Lover, one lovely day

Louis Hayes,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

You are too wonderful to be what you seem!

The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

Louis Hayes,"I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come-what-may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life from jazz and cocktails

The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distinguish traces that used to be there
You could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day, twelve O'clock tales

Then you came along with your siren song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for awhile that your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness of a great love for me
Ah, yes, I was wrong, again, I was wrong

Life is lonely again and only last year
Everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again a trough full of hearts
Could only be a bore

A week in Paris could ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it
I'll forget you, I will while yet you are still
Burning inside my brain

Romance is mush stifling those who strive
I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And there I'll be while I rot with the rest
Of those whose lives are lonely too

Romance is mush stifling those who strive
I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And there I'll be while I rot with the rest
Of those whose lives are lonely too

And there I'll be while I rot with the rest
Of those whose lives are lonely too

Louis Hayes & Company,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You,2000

Sweeter than the roses in May

When he nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express

Louis Hays,"To lead a better life I need my love to be here...

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking but she doesn't know he's there

I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to meet her everywhere

Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

Louis Hays,"The evening breeze caressed the trees,
Tenderly.
The trembling trees embrace the breeze,
Tenderly.
Then you and I came wandering by
And lost in sigh were we.

The shore was kissed by sea and mist,
Tenderly.

Breathlessly.

And  closed me in..side.

Louis Hays,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2009
Louis Hays,"The song a robin sings,
Through years of endless springs,
The murmur of a brook at eventide,
That ripples by a nook where two lovers hide.

And not a dream,
My heart and I agree,
She's everything on earth to me.

Louis James' String Band,"I was born on a farm out in Ioway
A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree
And we all played just the same ""Goofus"" harmony
And I must admit we made a hit

For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,

Even though there's nothing said
If you stand there like a statue

But you stubbed your toes
When you ups and kicks the bucket

When you get no kicks from loving
And you blow your top instead
It's a fact that you ain't living
Jack, you're dead!

If you just ain't got nobody
Since you've gone and lost your head
Rigor Mortis has set in daddy
Jack, you're dead!

What's the use of having muscles
When your life hangs by a thread
If you ain't got no red corpuscles
Jack, you're dead!

You've been always kicking
But you stubbed your toes
When you ups and kicks the bucket
Just like old man mose

When you get no kicks from loving
And the news begins to spread
All the cats will holler, ""Murder!""

All the breath is leaked out of you
When your friends gather 'round the bed
Look at you and say, ""Don't he look natural""

They reduced my meat and sugar

We set sail from the Coal Quay of Cork
We were sailing away with a cargo of bricks
For the grand City Hall in New York
We'd an elegant craft, it was rigged 'fore and aft
And how the trade winds drove her
She had twenty-three masts and she stood several blasts
And they called her the Irish Rover

There was Barney Magee from the banks of the Lee
There was Hogan from County Tyrone
There was Johnny McGurk who was scared stiff of work
And a chap from Westmeath named Malone
There was Slugger O'Toole who was drunk as a rule
And fighting Bill Tracy from Dover
And your man Mick McCann, from the banks of the Bann
Was the skipper on the Irish Rover

We had one million bags of the best Sligo rags
We had two million barrells of bone
We had three million bales of old nanny goats' tails
We had four million barrells of stone
We had five million hogs and six million dogs
And seven million barrells of porter
We had eight million sides of old blind horses' hides
In the hold of the Irish Rover

We had sailed seven years when the measles broke out
And our ship lost her way in a fog
And the whole of the crew was reduced down to two
'Twas myself and the captain's old dog

He was his father's only son, his mother's pride and joy
And dearly did his parents love the wild colonial boy

At the early age of sixteen years, he left his native home
And to Australia's sunny shore he was inclined to roam
He robbed the rich, he helped the poor, he shot James McAvoy

A listening to the mockingbird a singing a cheerful song
Out stepped a band of troopers, Kelly, Davis and Fitzroy
They all set out to capture him, the wild colonial boy

Surrender in the Queen's high name for you're a plundering son""

Louis Killen,"There was Johnny McEldoo and McGee and me
And a couple of two or three went on the spree one day
We had a bob or two, which we knew how to blew
And the beer and whiskey flew and we all felt gay
We visited McCann's, Maclaman's, Humpty Dan's
We then went into Swan's, our stomachs for to pack
We ordered out a feed, which indeed, we did need
And we finished it with speed, but we still felt slack

Johnny McEldoo turned red, white and blue
As a plate of Irish stew he soon put out of sight
He shouted out ""Encore!"" with a roar for some more
That he'd never felt before such a keen appetite
We ordered eggs and ham, bread and jam, what a cram
But him, we couldn't ram, though we tried our level best
For everything we brought, cold or hot, mattered not
It went down him like a shot and he still stood the test

He swallowed tripe and lard by the yard, we got scarred
We thought it would go hard when the waiter brought the bill
We told him to give o'er, but he swore he could lower
Twice as much again and more before he had his fill
He nearly supped a trough full of broth says McGragh
""He'll devour the tablecloth if you don't hold him in""
When the waiter brought the charge, McEldoo felt so large
He began to shout and barge and his blood went on fire

He began to curse and swear, tear his hair in despair
To finish the affair, called the shop man a liar
The shop man, he through out and no doubt, he did clout
McEldoo he kicked about like an old football
Tattered all his clothes, broke his nose, I suppose
He would have killed him with a few blows in no time at all
Mceldoo began to howl and to growl, by my soul
Through an empty bowl at the shop keepers head
It struck poor Mickey Flynn, took the skin from his chin
An erection did begin and we all fought and bled

Louis Logic,"[Verse 1: L-Fudge]
I metamorph phrases to glaciers
Have 'em come together in liquid stages
Then turn down the temperature and have 'em frozen into a solid foundation
Now added to that this well produced amazement
The crash is enough, to have the world tipped off it's axis a notch
It'll take the likes of, Jedi Minds to construct new longitude lines
In order to get around but now, you're askin' for too much
When mines put together
I'm like an alternative source of energy like, electricity generators
Separators of the wack rap, to the world reknownst individuals
Played in deuce parts life's nara-rators
Rhyme gladiators, is what we're referred as
Food for thoughts tooken offa ya plate instead ya serve thrash
Ikon and Logic serve as my accomplices
And bring our own form of trinity to show y'all onto this
Rhyme patterns come across as astonishing
So I have the right to feel myself to the point of genetelia fondlin'

We the three emcees that rock that shit
Pimpin' talk and jump and knock that shit
""Louis Logic, L-L-Fudge, Ikon the verbal hologram""

[Verse 2: Louis Logic]
I spread around me a viral infectious faculties
Applied chiropractically so rappers cannot come back to me
Simply outta respect, or suffer the consequence
The effect of which is that of absent father neglect
Wreakin' havoc, on egos speakin' magic
Castin' the curse on fashion emcees for region fabric
Send 'em wandering through the labyrinth
As far as cuttin' careers short on mics
I'm what the NYPD is to entrapment
The epitomy of have been, yet schooled
Engineers peep the structure of my mind
Now they wonder how the math went
L was made to ascend, which is evident by my descent
Spreadin' east to west like European settlements
Sequence, but even, I'm captured
Self destructive explosive devices reactin' from my mind is everlastin'
Which makes me a Trojan horse of sorts
Drainin' ya plasma until ya rhythm section hold the contorts
While snatchin' a arm in this sport
Drove off on ya squarely, then the warden report
And the single bullet theory

Hook (x2)

[Verse 3: Ikon the Verbal Hologram]
You fuck wid me you won't survive
Ikon been live since eighty five
Mine'll still have a carat that's tragical crystallized
Hit them guys, in they eyes wid fuckin' shrapnel
Bomb they castle, set fire until they trapped in
Rap colossal, run rappers who wanna battle
Hologram wid two bad hands force you to grapple
Evil wraps you, reverse time and bring diseases
Christians will worship Allah and Muslims will worship Jesus
Kill all ya leaders, wid my savage lyrical thesis
Rip out my fuckin' heart and eat it before I'm defeated
The one who seen it, on the throne was in a forcefield
You'll get tossed and feel lost like holy god feel
Raw deal, rappers decipher that skism
Followed Solomon and brought him in at ya baptism

A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely.

Seemed made for just a boy and girl.

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""

Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Louis Prima,"Down on the Mississippi River in a knockdo dive
I met a trumpet playin' character and man alive
When he began to rip, he really played it from the hip
And when I asked about his name, they told me, that's The Lip
(Yip yip yip yip)
No one plays high notes like The Lip

He's got a tone that's reminiscent of a boy named Bix
He plays so high that only dogs can hear him, just for kicks
And when I asked him does he read
He says, I'll tell you, hon'
I read a little bit but not enough to hurt me none
(Yip yip yip yip)
No one plays high notes like The Lip

I said The Lip
(She must mean Ray Anthony, huh)
I said The Lip
(No, man, she means Harry James)
I said The Lip
(You mean Louis Prima)
I said The Lip
(Noo, Lip er ace)
(Yip yip yip yip)
No one plays high notes like The Lip

I never heard a trumpet player play a note so high
I had to coax a lot before The Lip would tell me why
Then he took out a little jar that's labelled high note grease
And he rubs a little every night on his mouthpiece
(Yip yip yip yip)
No one plays high notes like The Lip

Listen here gal, are you kiddin' about all that high note grease?
No, man, I swear, he had ten in a big valise
Wha', you mean he goes to the drugstore
And gets them from the medicine shelf?
No, some cat's told me he makes it himself
(Yip yip yip yip)
Tell us the secret of The Lip

Well, you take a bucketful of steam
And a dozen rooster eggs
And you mix 'em up gently with a bushel full of goldfish legs
And ya hang 'em on a sky hook in the midnight sun
Mmm and then you fry them until they're done
(Yip yip yip yip)
That's the secret of The Lip",The Lip,1990

Louis Prima,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1999

Louis Prima,"Oh! They say some people long ago
Were searching for a different tune,
One that they could croon 
As only they can.

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro.
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began:

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues.

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail,
And they played that 
As part of the blues.

From a whippoorwill out on a hill,
They took a new note,
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note.

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it,
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",Be Mine (Little Baby),1999

That's the stuff she likes to wade right through
Banana split for my baby
A glass of plain water for me

Now add the cherries
The kind she loves to munch
Skip one banana
Use the whole darn bunch
Drown it with fudge
Six or seven cans
Give her two spoons
She'll eat it with both hands

And a glass of plain water for me

Out of town were the people I knew  
I had that feeling of self-pity  
What to do? What to do? What to do?

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone  
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Had me low and had me down  
I viewed the morning with alarm

Louis Prima,"There's a fruit store on our street
It's run by a Greek.
And he keeps good things to eat
But you should hear him speak!
When you ask him anything, he never answers ""no"".
He just ""yes""es you to death, and as he takes your dough
He tells you
""Yes, we have no bananas
We have-a no bananas today.
We've string beans, and onions
Cabbageses, and scallions,
And all sorts of fruit and say
We have an old fashioned to-mah-to
A Long Island po-tah-to
But yes, we have no bananas.
We have no bananas today.""

Business got so good for him that he wrote home today,
""Send me Pete and Nick and Jim; I need help right away.""
When he got them in the store, there was fun, you bet.
Someone asked for ""sparrow grass"" and then the whole quartet
All answered
""Yes, we have no bananas
We have-a no bananas today.
Just try those coconuts
Those walnuts and doughnuts
There ain't many nuts like they.
We'll sell you two kinds of red herring,
Dark brown, and ball-bearing.
But yes, we have no bananas
We have no bananas today.""

Yes, we are very sorry to inform you
That we are entirely out of the fruit in question
The afore-mentioned vegetable
Bearing the cognomen ""Banana"".
We might induce you to accept a substitute less desirable,
But that is not the policy at this internationally famous green 
grocery.
I should say not. No no no no no no no.
But may we suggest that you sample our five o'clock tea
Which we feel certain will tempt your pallet?
However we regret that after a diligent search 
Of the premises
By our entire staff
We can positively affirm without fear of contradiction
That our raspberries are delicious; really delicious
Very delicious
But we have no bananas today.

Yes, we gotta no banana
No banana
We gotta no banana today.
I sella you no banana.
Hey, Marianna, you gotta no banana?
Why this man, he no believe-a what I say.

Drown it in fudge, six or seven cans

She's a bit gaudy but lord what a pretty personality

Say have you ever met the girl who's the toast of the town
A work of art without a question
You better write her number down, you fools.",The Lady in Red,1994
Louis Prima & His Band,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1994
Louis Prima & His Band,"When I lost my baby (baby)
I almost lost my mind
When I lost my baby (baby)
I almost lost my mind
My head is in a spin since she's left me behind

I went to see the gypsy
And had my fortune read
I went to see the gypsy
And had my fortune read
I hung my head in sorrow when she said what she said

Well, I can tell you, people (people)
The news was not so good
Well, I can tell you, people (people)
The news was not so good
She said ""Your baby's left you""
""This time she's gone for good"" (gone for good)
