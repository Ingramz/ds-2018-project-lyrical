Jack Palmer,"I have to drive
I have my reasons, dear
It's cold outside
I hate the seasons here

I suffer mornings most of all
I feel so powerless and small
By ten o'clock I'm back in bed
Fighting the jury in my head

You learn to drive
It's only natural, dear
You drive all night
We haven't slept in years

We suffer mornings most of all
We saw you lying in the road
We tried to dig a decent grave
But it's still no way to behave

It is a delicate position
Spin the bottle
Pick the victim
Catch a tiger
Switch directions
If he hollers
Break his ankles
To protect him

We'll have to drive
They're getting closer
Just get inside
It's almost over

We will save your brothers
We will save your cousins
We will drive them far away
From streets and lights
From all signs of bad mankind

We suffer mornings most of all
Wake up all bleary eyed and sore
Forgetting everything we saw

(I'll meet you in an hour
At the car)",Have to Drive,2008

If you decide to say goodbye
You're gonna make my poor heart cry
Oh,what, what what can it be
But time will tell if you'll be true
Or if you gonna leave me blue
So I'll just wait-ait and see
If you never gonna kiss me again
And you never hug me again
Oh, oh
What will I do
Oh my dear, I really try
When you're out with another guy
But I can't help feeling sad
This hurt I have within my heart
Is there because you want to part
Why must you treat me bad
Why do you want to leave
You make my poor heart grieve

And if you do remain
You'll set me heart a flame

Jack Parker,"A man works hard then comes on home,
Expects to find stew with that fine ham bone.
He opens the door, then start to lookin',
Says, Woman, what's this stuff you're cookin'?

All that meat and no potatoes
Just ain't right, like green tomatoes.
Here I'm waiting, palpitatin',
For all that meat and no potatoes.

All that meat and no potatoes
All that food to the alligators, yes.
Hold me steady. I am ready
For all that meat and no potatoes.

I don't think that peas are bad.
With meat most anything goes.
I look into the pot. I'm fit to fight
'Cause, woman, you know that mess ain't right.

Jack Parker,"I don't ever care to rise to power
I would rather be with you an hour
For the things that one can buy
Are not worth a lover's sigh

I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart
In my heart I have but one desire
And that one is you, no other will do

I've lost all ambition for worldly acclaim
I just want to be the one you love
And with your admission that you feel the same
I'll have reached the goal I'm dreaming of, believe me

I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart",I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire,2000

You've got to clown on Broadway
Your troubles there are out of style
For Broadway always wears a smile
A million lights they flicker there
A million hearts beat quicker there

Jack Parnell & His Orchestra,"The gentleman is a dope,
A man of many faults,
A clumsy Joe
Who wouldn't know
A rumba from a waltz.

The gentleman is a dope
And not my cup of tea;
Why do I get in a dither?
He doesn't belong to me!

The gentleman isn't bright,
He doesn't know the score;
A cake will come,
He'll take a crumb
And never ask for more!

The gentleman's eyes are blue,
But little do they see,
Why am I beatin' my brains out?
He doesn't belong to me!

He's somebody else's problem,
She's welcome to the guy!
She'll never understand him
Half as well as I.

The gentleman is a dope,
He isn't very smart;
He's just a lug
You'd like to hug
And hold against your heart.

How happy he could be,
But look at me cryin' my eyes out
As if he belonged to me;
He'll never belong to me!

We'll sigh good-bye to all we've ever had, 
Alone where we have walked together, 
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content, you loved me once in April, 
Your lips were warm, and love an' spring were new, 
But I'm not afraid of autumn, and her sorrow, 
For I'll remember, (I'll remember) 
April and you! (I'll remember)

For flames and love live such a little while 
I won't forget, but I won't be lonely, ( Oh, no)

Jack Parnell & His Orchestra,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true

To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,2014
Jack Parnell & His Orchestra,"I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon,2014
Jack Parnell & His Orchestra,"You'll never know just how much I miss you
You'll never know just how much I care
And if I tried, I still couldn't hide my love for you 
You ought to know, for haven't I told you so
 
A million or more times?
You went away and my heart went with you
I speak your name in my every prayer
If there is some other way to prove that I love you

I swear I don't know how

Jack Patton,"Let's build a stairway to the stars
And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song
We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along
Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?
Can't we sail away on a little dream 
And settle high on the crest of a thrill!
Let's build a stairway to the stars
A lovely stairway to the stars",Stairway to the Stars,2003
Jack Patton,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2003
Jack Payne,"Who's that coming down the street?
Good old organ grinder Pete
He's the latest rhythm king
With his organ grinder's swing
Dadya, Pa swings it, so does Ma
Dadya, Ma swings it, so does Pa
Dadya, you swing it, so do I
Dadya, I swing it so do you
 
When he turns that handle down
Music goes around and 'round

Trala, Ma swings it, so does Pa

Jack Peñate,"We made amends but nothing's mended
As what I gave can not be lended
I led you on but leading's wrong

I made a meal of it and stumbled

Jack Peñate,"Got my favourite pair of crepes on
The ones with golden Samaris sewn on
Each step is skipped when they are thrown on
Feet are swift so I bowl on

I got my favourite army dog tag
The one I got one day with my dad
We watched the planes loop and the clouds sag
The sky was filled with smoke drag

Of course, I know that these are all for show
To decorate our limbs and let us know
That through these things a constant love will flow
With them we are not on our own

Got my favourite Westwood coat on
The one from Alice who I dote on
I am a pirate and I float on
Yo, ho, ho, and a bottle of rum

Jack Peñate,"When things have been said so many times
You repeat back as if you're learning lines
It?s so easy to fall into this trap
'cause once you get there, you can't get back

As I get older I wonder what I?ll do
When I make my own choices and they say it's up to you
'cause right now I'm feeling safe, it's all the same
But in a few years if I'm nowhere, it's me to blame, ohh, ohh, ohh, ooh

Picture frame, books and shelves, not afraid by myself
Metal strings, glowing tubes, Bessie Smith sings the blues
Key and lock, dirty clothes, misunderstood poets prose
Dreaming with open minds, repeating back, learning lines
Learning lines, learning lines, learning lines, learning lines

People around seem to have their heads screwed on
But dreaming?s become my life, I'm finding it hard to move on
It?d be so easy if I wanted to charter survey
Knowing my future down to a year or a day, ohh, ohh, ohh, ooh

Picture frame, books and shelves, not afraid by myself

Jack Peñate,"The small divides along the sides of rulers always amazed me
Closer you looked the more it took your eyes off reality
It's very rare that I don't stare at objects to find beauty
Hope I don't seem to talk pompously, try and look abstractly

If you don't see we're all made of codes
Deciphering is the game we're all in
If you don't see we're all made of codes
Deciphering is the game we're all in

The New York sky is cut by lines of metal tubes protruding
When one's within, it gets quite dim as you're just one included
Look between the glossy sheen and the shapes emerging
Heaven laughs while breaking past tiny cracks that's surging

If you don't see we're all made of codes
Deciphering is the game we're all in
If you don't see we're all made of codes
Deciphering is the game we're all in, oh

The different lands are trapped in hands of rulers making us think
The worlds not ours, these ancient scars do not show anything, but
This is trite, it is our right to live that full, we possess
No one owns what nature's grown, this truth they must confess

It's a constant cycle, so hurry
Do all you can before you're buried
Powers try to hide and ferry us through time
Ferry us through life, ferry us through life

'Cause I miss you, oh, how I miss you
You're not my girl you're my town

A weekend away, leave the city today
Don't want the big smoke to leave me behind
The train leaves at 2, Platform 3 Waterloo
50 p to the tramp makes me feel kind

I get a good seat with a window
My feet are up on the one in front everyone stares
But why do they care? Like there's feelings in chairs
Stuck for 3 hours until I get there

My eyes, eyes, eyes are not dry, dry, dry
As I realize-lize-lize
That in a few minutes this train will be gone
Sighs, sighs, sighs, city flies, flies, flies
Wonder why, why, why
Would anyone want to leave where I come from?

I'm torn on the platform

It's 1:58, wish that I had been late
And missed the train and given them an excuse

Do or die, stay or go, what should I choose?

By we, I mean all humanity
Endless universe out in front of me
Some say, earth?s a tiny obscurity

Maybe in size, but if you're wise
And close your eyes, lose all your guise
Part of the deal is do not conceal
That we can feel, this is all real

The stars can't feel a lover's touch
The kiss that makes your body rush
Embrace your sleeping sweetheart with hush
And the words, I love you mean so much

Above in the sky, diamond lights fly
Makes us think, why, we're here then we die
Questions are asked but answers don't last
We look to the past, comfort so fast

The stars can't feel a lover's touch
The kiss that makes your body rush
Embrace your sleeping sweetheart with hush

I can wish upon a star but wouldn't wish to be that far
I can wish upon a star but wouldn't wish to be that far
I can wish upon a star but wouldn't wish to be that far
I can wish upon a star but wouldn't wish to be that far

When the world has gone
There won't be this song
But that isn't wrong

In atoms of tears
Kisses and fears
Live on all years

And their cries smash the stain glass panes?

No dearly beloved gathered for the deceased

And throw me out of the side of a plane

It's not like I'm wanting to know about the door

And I'll watch the souls burn on the funeral pyre

And I'm over and it will change my position
And I'll know that nobody, nobody's listening
And that's easy for me and it's better for the soul

Boys are jealous of me, 'cause I
Never take her where the gang goes,

We forget about our cares,
Rubbing elbows at the Ritz,
With those millionaires.

Pains in my head, feel like old Ned

No joys for me, no company
Even the mouse ran from my house
All my life through I've been so black and blue
 
I'm white inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
I'm so forlorn. Life's just a thorn
My heart is torn. Why was I born?
What did I do to be so black and blue?
 
I'm hurt inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face

Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner,

My friends are gone
And you have too
No peace shall I find
Until you come back

I'm gonna love you anyway

Sometime's down

It will be morning

And I mustn't give in.
When the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,

Jack Sheldon,"[Chorus]
The night is like a lovely tune, 
Beware my foolish heart, 
How white the ever constant moon, 
Take care my foolish heart, 

There's a line between love and fascination, 
That's hard to see on an evening such as this,
For they both give the very same sensation,
When you're lost in the magic of a kiss.

Your lips are much too close to mine, 
Beware my foolish heart, 
But should our eager lips combine, 
Then let the fire start, 

For this time it isn't fascination, 
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart, 
It's love, this time it's love, 
My foolish heart!

Jack Teagarden,"Do you know what is means to miss New Orleans
I miss it, each night and day
The longer I stay away
Miss the moist covered vines
The tall sugar pines
Where mocking birds use to sing
And I like to see the lazy Mississippi
Are hurrying to spring
The mardy grass memories
Of creol tunes that fill the air
I dream of Orleanders in June
And soon I'm wishing that I was there
Do you know what is means to miss New Orleans
And there is something more
I miss the one I care for
More than I miss New Orleans",Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans?,1987

Is there anyone finer 
In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her!

With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

Jack Teagarden,"Oh! they say some people long ago
Were searching for a diff'rent tune,
One that they could croon 
As only they can.

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro.
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began:

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues.

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail,
And they played that 
As part of the blues.

From a whippoorwill out on a hill,
They took a new note,
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note.

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it,
And gave out the news
That the south land 
Gave birth to the blues!",The Birth of the Blues,1991
Jack Teagarden,"One night long ago by the light of the moon,
An old music master sat composing a tune,
His spirit was soaring and his heart full of joy,
When right out of nowhere stepped a little coloured boy.

You gotta jump it, music master,
You gotta play that rhythm faster,
You're never gonna get it played
On the Happy Cat Hit Parade.

You better tell your friend Beethoven,
And Mister Reginald De Koven
They better do the same as you,
Or they're gonna be corny too.

Long about nineteen seventeen
Jazz'll come upon the scene,
Then about nineteen thirty-five
You'll begin to hear swing,

Boogie Woogie and Jive,
You gotta show that big broadcaster
That you're a solid music master,
And you'll achieve posterity,

That's a bit of advice from me.
The old music master simply sat there amazed,
As wide-eyed and open-mouthed he gazed and he gazed
How can you be certain little boy, tell me how?

Because I was born, my friend,
A hundred years from now.
He hit a chord that rocked the spinet
And disappeared into the infinite,

And up until the present day,
You can take it from me,
He's as right as can be,
Ev'rything has happened that-a-way.",The Old Music Master,1992

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

Makes me just throw myself away, 
When I hear 'em play.

It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Were searching for a diff'rent tune,
One that they could croon 
As only they can.

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro.
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began:

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues.

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail,
And they played that 
As part of the blues.

From a whippoorwill out on a hill,
They took a new note,
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note.

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it,
And gave out the news
That the south land 
Gave birth to the blues!",The Birth of the Blues [From George White's Scandals of 1926],1998

That's where the people smile, smile on you all the while.
Hospitality, they were good to me.
I couldn't spend a dime, and had the grandest time.
I went out a dancing with a Tennessee dear,
They had a fellow there named Handy with a band you should hear
And while the folks gently swayed, all the band folks played Real harmony.
I never will forget the tune that Handy called the Memphis Blues.
Oh yes, them Blues.

They've got a fiddler there that always slickens his hair
And folks he sure do pull some bow.
And when the big Bassoon seconds to the Trombones croon.
It moans just like a sinner on Revival Day, on Revival Day.

Oh that melody sure appealed to me.
Just like a mountain stream rippling on it seemed.
Then it slowly died, with a gentle sigh
Soft as the breeze that whines high in the summer pines.
Hear me people, hear me people, hear I pray,
I'm going to take a million lesson's 'til I learn how to play
Because I seem to hear it yet, simply can't forget
That blue refrain.

There's nothing like the Handy Band that played the Memphis Blues so grand.
Oh play them Blues.

On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me","St. James' Infirmary [From ""Birth of the Blues""]",2002

See how he looks
Wait till you hear him laugh

Writers of books

We lived our little drama, we kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I can't forget the glamor, your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I never planned in my imagination a situation so heavenly
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear

Jack Teagarden,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2005

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Mop mop! A guy named Jungle Joe
Was a drummer man in a Zulu band
That made swing history

Why Gate, you old reprobate
I commission you, find a riff that's new
Or your wig belongs to me.""

So scared he was stiff
'Til he noticed the tribe was rockin'
As his knees beat out this mellow riff

Mop mop! Came this jungle beat
Though old Joe is gone, his jive lives on
And it still is making history.

Darling this place is a lover's oasis where life's weary chase is unknown.
Far from the cry of the city, where flowers pretty caress the streams,
Cozy to hide in, to love side-by-side in. Don't let it abide in my dreams.

Just me for you and you for me, alone!

No friends or relations on weekend vacations,
We won't have it known, dear, that we have a telephone, dear.

A sugar cake for me to take for all the boys to see.
We will raise a family, a boy for you, a girl for me, 
Oh, can't you see how happy life would be?

You are revealing a plan so appealing I can't help but falling for you,
Darling, I planned it; can't you understand it is yours to command it, so do.

I'd like to wait there for some future date dear;

Jack Teagarden & His Orchestra,"Oh! they say some people long ago
Were searching for a diff'rent tune,
One that they could croon 
As only they can.

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro.
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began:

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues.

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail,
And they played that 
As part of the blues.

From a whippoorwill out on a hill,
They took a new note,
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note.

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it,
And gave out the news
That the south land 
Gave birth to the blues!",The Birth of the Blues,1997

Due modi diversi
Noi siamo come scuola privata o pubblica

Io sveglio quando il sole è già lontano
Tu invece sveglia presto quindi neanche ci incontriamo
Viviamo due Milano tipo un'altra Italia
Io vivo con il fuso orario tipo dell'Australia
Tu sotto il sole che ti squaglia
Io non reggo il caldo
Come non reggo questa sveglia mentre sto sognando
Col cazzo che mi alzo
Io con la testa parto quando fumo e bevo
Tu mi squadri dall'alto con lo sguardo astemio
Il tuo stipendio che scompare, Sim Sala Bim
Sabato sera nel locale in una sala in
Io sopra 'ste panchine che mi sento un king
In questa notte senza fine come dentro un film
Io a letto alle sette
Tu fuori alle sette
Noi due scuole diverse come fra culo e tette

Tu sei già fuori io dormo
Quando sei sveglia io sogno
Come la notte e il giorno
Non mi cercare qua attorno
Tanto non mi vedrai
Se sono in giro tu dormi
Se sono sveglio tu sogni
Noi come due modi due mondi

E non ci incontriamo mai

Noi siamo come chi cerca coca e chi vuole l'erba
Come un bimbo che gioca affianco a un uomo in guerra
Come uno che risparmia mentre l'altro cede
O come quello che usa un'arma mentre l'altro usa la fede
Come papà che mi diceva suda
E ma' che mi diceva studia
Un frà che mi diceva fuma (e dai)
Come chi fuggirà in cerca di fortuna
Va in cerca di avventura
Chi invece sta qua perchè sa che la vera casa è una
Anche se fuori è guerra, io non scappo mai (mai)
Voglio la vetta di 'sta Terra tipo lo skyline

Come i blocchi di periferia e i palazzi in centro

Io giro con la felpa nuova

Jack the Smoker,"Nella tasca io c’ho una cosa
L’appizzo giusto per scordare ogni cosa
Per affogare nel vizio
Cresciuto da solo gridavo nel vuoto “Ci sei?”
A scuola ero un demonio con la media del 666
Sogno un auto presidenziale tutta di smizzle
Io sposato alle strade buttami il riso
Sti palazzi del cazzo con la parete grigia
Esco solo da fatto: tipo valigia
Giorni uguali che senso c’è
L’odio cresceva dentro me
Sognavo una pila di cash
Alta come la torre Eiffel
Oggi precario, pendolari
Senti il piano che ho per domani
Per mia madre una casa nuova grossa duecento metri quadri

Quanto ci vuole per cambiare sta vita, sta vita, sta vita
Quanto sudore per cambiare sta vita
Chiuso in studio fino alle sei
Chiudo e fumo fino alle sei
Non scordo i guai prima delle sei
Ancora non ho benca chi cazzo sei, chi cazzo sei

Io animale nel freddo un husky
Odio il cash e temo non basti
Ma qua senza soldi è come senza caschi quando in moto caschi
Nati casti in un mondo sporco
Mascherarsi e coprirsi il volto
Sognerei un giorno un colpo al Monte dei Paschi
Questi qua hanno perso già i sogni
Chiusi al bar e senza un progetto
Ora i teknofolli son rimasti sotto e vedono i folletti quando vanno a letto
Io fumo e volo, qua è Nasa
Chi mi dice stai a casa
Dimmi su che cosa si basa
Anzi cosa si basa
Tu dov’eri qua non c’eri no
Fra i dolori della gente mia
Torni soltanto quando vedi i colori dell’argenteria
Resto con la gente mia fino alle sei
Tu alle undici vai via da dove sei

Quanto ci vuole per cambiare sta vita, sta vita, sta vita
Quanto sudore per cambiare sta vita
Chiuso in studio fino alle sei
Chiudo e fumo fino alle sei

Jack the Smoker,"Yeah
Vivi come una leggenda, muori come una leggenda

Quando muoio seppelliscimi coi testi
A fianco a Biggie, Leo da Vinci oppure Shakespeare
Seppelliscimi coi soldi come un mega re
A fianco a Gesù Cristo, a fianco a Giulio Cesare

Rime ricche Rothschild, Smeezy Boy è so fly
Volo appena soffiai, la tua tipa Yorkshire
Mi fermo quando in banca avrò one thousand
A te la porta si spalanca si però Mauthausen
Smeezy bwoah, a sti rapper brucia shoah
Riconosci quanto flow ha, più trance che a Goa
Ti soddisfa, sei un puzzle perchè il flow disfa
Ho jolle grosse tira su gridando ""oh issa""
I miei fan su, canne mica bambu
Tavola rotonda con la bomba nuovo Artù
Per alcuni genio, ma per altri un sottone
Dopo un tot ore, nella mia vita tu chiami un dottore
Tu con quella faccia sembri Yelawolf
Ieri in stanza con la tua cagnaccia che faceva ""wof""
Mattoncino da 3g dentro le Chesterfield
Poi mi faccio viaggi come il Ministro degli Esteri

Quando muoio seppelliscimi coi testi
A fianco a Biggie, Leo da Vinci oppure Shakespeare
Seppelliscimi coi soldi come un mega re
A fianco a Gesù Cristo, a fianco a Giulio Cesare

Fammi un mausoleo più grande quando muoio della piazza
Sotto casa di Bergoglio e copri d'oro l'obitorio
Dopo brucia nel petrolio tutti i miei nemici acerrimi
La tua tipa un foschi, la mia Ratajkowski Emily
Rapper Made in MI ma non mi vedi Ray-Ban
Soldi veri Cayman, tu sei Made In Taiwan
Il tuo attimo in un attimo va via
Se scrivi bene datti alla dattilografia
Lieviti leggero come Brio Blu
Ti sentivi Dio tu, dopo hai visto il mio crew
Così è la vita, entro io la chiudo tripla
Dammi una tastiera a due note perchè Smeezy si fa
Io non voglio nessuno a fianco qua frà
Sto nel deserto la classe non è acqua
Dai '90 ancora con le Converse
Ancora per mostrarti quanto la tua vita è no-sense

Quando muoio seppelliscimi coi testi
A fianco a Biggie, Leo da Vinci oppure Shakespeare
Seppelliscimi coi soldi come un mega re

Jack the Smoker,"Ogni successo è come vuoto se
Non ha uno scopo quando è senza te
Avessi più coraggio ti direi la verità
Scorderei l'orgoglio e direi vieni qua
Ma ogni vittoria è come persa se
Io ne vivo la gioia senza te
Avessi meno orgoglio ti direi la verità
Prenderei coraggio e direi vieni qua

Ora sto solo in alto, ma non sono più libero
Senza nessuno affianco, ho solo guadagnato ossigeno
Il mondo sotto non so più dov'è
Ora che sono solo in vetta affianco ho solo nuvole
Sono fatto così, tu non sai niente di me
Vedi soltanto i miei film chiusi in un mp3
Lo so che fuggo vorrei dire scusa
Ma la faccia sotto sta maschera forse ti lascerà delusa
E le certezze cadono in sequenza è un domino
Dimentica il tuo nome tutti sanno il tuo pseudonimo
Mi sento a posto solo sopra il palco, dinamite
Quando le persone sotto sono macchie indefinite

Ma ogni successo è come vuoto se
Non ha uno scopo quando è senza te
Avessi più coraggio ti direi la verità
Scorderei l'orgoglio e direi vieni qua
Ma ogni vittoria è come persa se
Io ne vivo la gioia senza te
Avessi meno orgoglio ti direi la verità
Prenderei coraggio e direi vieni qua

La mia vita altelena, da un trionfo ad un tonfo
Questa carriera è una galera e poi sei solo al mondo
Gli spettatori qua a teatro fan risate finte
Cerco soltanto il tuo sorriso ora dietro le quinte
E non ho tregua, non voglio stare con chi non mi conosceva
Ti acclamano ma è solo scena
Ricordi l'emozione? Tutta la notte a fare sogni sul balcone
Fino a quando spuntava il sole
E ora potrei avere in mano il mondo intero ma
Non c'è niente di vero qua, il mio sogno che si sgretola
Puntavo a stare come gli aeroplani
Ora ho solo molecole di cielo fra le mani

Ma ogni successo è come vuoto se
Non ha uno scopo quando è senza te
Avessi più coraggio ti direi la verità
Scorderei l'orgoglio e direi vieni qua

Rapper cani chiusi dentro un trasportino
Mi vedi dal vivo mi dici “cattivo fai il freddo tu sei come Helsinki”
Non sono cattivo è che canto dal vivo mica faccio foto coi selfie stick
I tuoi rapper preferiti se mi sentono poi urlano distrutti Munch
Entro e fanno tutti slurp, tu entri e fanno rutti burp!
Non c’è crew come la mia crew tutte le altre crew non vincono

Da morto parlerò con le canzoni in Poltergeist
Siamo grezzi come cassonetti quindi cazzo rappi
Io riempio i locali tu i fazzoletti
Non sei degno della voce fatti il segno della croce, smetti!
I miei bro ascoltano Asap Ferg dicono yessir bevono Sizzurp
Giriamo con i rapper morti sulle t-shirt
Ed i Timberland Boots non i boots with Fur
Do not disturb è una gincana per il nirvana come Kurt
Fatti mille selfie da Trendy Girl
Così prendi più uccelli che in Angry Bird!
Investo soldi però non secondi perché ho poco tempo
Tu sei così vuoto dentro che se ti piscio in bocca dopo un po’ ti riempio
Quindi fatti meno film bevi nei locali in
Ma non reggi mezzo drink nuova scuola nuovo king
Ogni strofa è un evergreen ciò che passa tra un Lord e un Mr. Bean
Kung Fu Tai chi e tu vai giù da ring
Taglio teste col mio team new Mujahidin
Non parlarmi più di hip hop non sei tu Spike Lee
Per me rimani un chi non so io sono un tu sai chi!

Non ci credi ma ti sta accadendo
Resto in piedi mentre stai cadendo
E ti salta il nervo con quel che ho in serbo il tuo gergo pare rap in serbo
Questo è inferno come inferno in disco
Jack uccide questi li colpisco
Non parlano di me dopo questo disco
E non parlano di me perché li zittisco (zitta troia)
Lascia fare ai più grandi bwoy risparmiati sto sforzo
Livelli infantili perciò complimenti per il disco d’orzo
Questi li vedo nei locali invece di pensare a stare sopra un mic
Invece di mostrare che sai fare con le bic
Mi vieni a molestare sulle strade per le pic

Fanculo la fama, tu passi il giorno on line
Fanculo la fama, foto con i vip ai live

Jack Wagner,"Hello love it's been way too long
Since I realized that you're the most important thing in my life
I've gotta the need to tell you I know that I was wrong
Show you how I feel and what's goin' on
I don't know what to say

Except I love that girl so much
But I didn't show it
Started spreading myself too thin
Fool around thought she didn't know it
Such childish games I played I fooled her with my touch
Time has taught me so much
I'm grown enough to say

I was too young but that's no excuse
I had too much too soon I wanted more room
To please my restless youth
Now all this peace
I can't feel your bliss
You treated me so kind, you were all mine
But I just walk away

That sweet smile and face 
Hangs heavy on my mind
Is there a way that you can turn back the hands

The more love that precious time I let slip by
I can't take much more of this
So I gotta try
To get you back and say

I was too young but that's no excuse
I had too much too soon I wanted more room
To please my restless youth
Now all this peace
I can't feel your bliss

Has turned a multitude into mush
Mandibles drop from shock
An old lady at high altitude
Whispering hush

And grabs her tenor pacifier
From its stand
Thirty half steps to the microphone
Smile on her face
Flower in her hand
Oh how a crowd can melt
When they've been dealt
Such a deliciously delicate blow
By a barefooted fairy
Not with a clang but a whisper
Totally stealing the show
Fools desire distraction
And not take to heart
Their faces to their gadgets fall south
Ignoring the beauty of a fog on a hill
And a kitten with a mouse in its mouth
A motley mob settles down
And there's hardly a frown
As the air in the temple turns to mist
A spotlight, a mark and a cleanse of the throat
And her microphone gently is kissed
You can hear a boot lace
And a speck of dust taste
As the babe bravely stared down the herb
But she played not a note
And only one moment spoke

From a height far above,
You and your love brings me ecstasy!

Jack Whiting,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic 
That I always have found it best, 
Instead of getting 'em off my chest, 
To let 'em rest unexpressed, 
I hate parading my serenading 
As I'll probably miss a bar, 
But if this ditty is not so pretty 
At least it'll tell you 
How great you are. 

You're the top! 
You're the Coliseum. 
You're the top! 
You're the Louver Museum. 
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss 
You're a Bendel bonnet, 
A Shakespeare's sonnet, 
You're Mickey Mouse. 
You're the Nile, 
You're the Tower of Pisa, 
You're the smile on the Mona Lisa 
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop, 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom you're the top! 

Your words poetic are not pathetic. 
On the other hand, babe, you shine, 
And I can feel after every line 
A thrill divine 
Down my spine. 
Now gifted humans like Vincent Youmans 
Might think that your song is bad, 
But I got a notion 
I'll second the motion 
And this is what I'm going to add; 

You're the top! 
You're Mahatma Gandhi. 
You're the top! 
You're Napoleon Brandy. 
You're the purple light 
Of a summer night in Spain, 
You're the National Gallery 
You're Garbo's salary, 
You're cellophane. 
You're sublime, 
You're turkey dinner, 
You're the time, the time of a Derby winner 
I'm a toy balloon that's fated soon to pop 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top! 

You're the top! 
You're an arrow collar 
You're the top! 
You're a Coolidge dollar, 
You're the nimble tread 
Of the feet of Fred Astaire, 
You're an O'Neill drama, 

You're Whistler's mama! 

You're camembert. 

You're a rose, 
You're Inferno's Dante, 

You're the nose 
On the great Durante. 
I'm just in a way, 
As the French would say, ""de trop"". 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top! 

You're the top! 
You're a dance in Bali. 
You're the top! 
You're a hot tamale. 
You're an angel, you, 
Simply too, too, too diveen, 
You're a Boticcelli, 
You're Keats, 
You're Shelly! 

You're Ovaltine! 
You're a boom, 
You're the dam at Boulder, 
You're the moon, 
Over Mae West's shoulder, 
I'm the nominee of the G.O.P. 

Or GOP! 

But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top! 

You're the top! 
You're a Waldorf salad. 
You're the top! 
You're a Berlin ballad. 
You're the boats that glide 
On the sleepy Zuider Zee, 
You're an old Dutch master, 

You're Lady Astor, 
You're broccoli! 
You're romance, 
You're the steppes of Russia, 
You're the pants, on a Roxy usher, 
I'm a broken doll, a fol-de-rol, a blop, 

But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top!",You're the Top [1935 London Cast],2001

She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away,
So he waits behind
Writing fifty times ""I must not be

He creeps up from behind.

Now that we're cosy and clinging,

Jack Wilkins,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Jack Wilkins,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1993

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?

And you'll be met there by others like you

Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams

It's ringing with cheer

It rains pennies from heaven

Pennies from heaven

You must have showers
So when you hear it thunder
Don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from heaven
For you and me

Angels composed it for us to dance to.
Our waltz is moonlight trembling with kisses,
Each note a heartbeat throbbing with love.

Never to fade with the dawn,
And though you are gone
Our waltz will play on.

Jack Wilson,"Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around

So I walked on down the road a mile, 
Went to the house that brings a smile
Sat upon my grandpa's knee, and what do you think he said to me?

You will be hangin' on a string from your... 
When you believe, you will relieve the only soul
That you were born with to grow old and never know

Ollie showed me the fork in the road.
You can take to the left or go straight to the right,
Use your days and save your nights,
Be careful where you step, and watch wha-cha eat,
Sleep with the light on and you got it beat.

[Chorus:]

Ollie warned me it's a mean old world,
The street don't greet ya, yes, it's true;
But what am I supposed to do:
Read the writing on the wall,
I heard it when I was very small.

[Chorus:]

Wash my hand in lye water, I got a date with the Captain's daughter. 
You can go and tell your brother. 
We sure gonna love one another, oh! you
May be right and ya might be wrong, 
I ain't gonna worry all day long.

Snow's gonna come and the frost gonna bite,

That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

The night we met
There was magic abroad in the air
There were angels dining at the Ritz
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

I may be right I may be wrong
But I'm perfectly willing to swear
That when you turned and smiled at me
A nightingale sang in Berkeley square

The moon that lingered over London town
Poor puzzled moon he wore a frown
How could he know we two were so in love
The whole damned world seemed upside down

The streets of town were paved with stars
It was such a romantic affair
And as we kissed and said goodnight
A nightingale sang in Berkeley square

How strange it was
How sweet and strange
There was never a dream to compare
To those hazy crazy nights we met
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

Ah this heart of mine
Loud and fast
Like a merry-go-round in a fair
We would dance cheek to cheek
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

The dawn came stealing up
All gold and blue
To interrupt our rendez-vous
I still remember how you smiled and said
Was that a dream or was it true?

And like an echo far away

I had to give it away, had to give you away

And we spent four days on an

It can be perfect hell, perfect

When did society decide that we had to change
And wash a tee shirt after every individual use:
If it's not dirty, I'm gonna wear it.
I take the stairs to the car
And there's fog on the windows.
(And I'm Fighting the words)
I need caffeine in my blood stream,
I take caffeine in the blood stream.
I grip the wheel and all at once I realize:
(And you're getting away)

And everyone's singing along.]

It's when I spend the most time
Thinking 'bout what I've given up
This is a warning

Just to close the curtains

I'm writing you a symphony of sound

Where are you now?

It was you I was thinking of

I read your letter
The one you left when you broke into my house
I'm retracing every step you made
And you said you meant it
There's a piece of me in 
Every single second of every single day
But if its true to tell me how we got this way

Prefer not to be rescued

Painting pictures that nobody sees
From his days in the war

He paces the hall

""Yeah, pop the trunk, he got dope and guns""
Check for warrants, that son of a bitch on the run, I know
Three of his niggas got life, he use to roll with
And told 'em I bodied an upcoming basketball star
Once I heard that, I fell out the cop car, real hard
You bugged out, and thugged out, wanted me to take you back

No disrespect, but you a psycho, honey
Got that S.S.I. money, and you start actin' funny

Them jumbo joints, them shits cost a buck 50 for eight

I know when you got me the red one, that she got the blue
But the way I chew on you, you should of got me two

Tell me that you gon' move with me, I know you lyin', dog

The man'll treat you like a queen, I will bird you

Then damn, I might as well leave, 'cause I don't deserve you
Watch from you face, when you sleep, let the heat disturb you

Take me back, God damn, and scrape marks on my knees

You all can sing this shit too
If you a hoe and you hate another hoe,
You can sing this shit too
If you a bitch and you hate and bitch,
You can sing this shit too
So everybody's gonna sing this shit
I hate hoes, they hate me too
Yup
Yup
Yup
Yup
Yup

Jackie,"I've got a feeling that something is wrong
That look is telling me your not happy
We never listen to our favorite song
Do you remember the way you held me
No I won't let you work this love away
There was a time when you held me tight
Dreams of now and dreams of yesterday
Both have the heartache that you feel inside

You are the sun, I am the sky together we'll live in paradise
Our hopes and dreams will come alive in paradise

So many times I look into your eyes
I see an image a man who's crying
You try to tell me, but I realize
It's had to make it, I'll keep on trying
Open up your heart let's get away
Just take my hand it will be alright
Leave all behind, come out ad play
We'll find the answer deep into the night

You are the sun, I am the sky together we'll live in paradise
Our hopes and dreams will come alive in paradise

You are the sun, I am the sky together we'll live in paradise
Our hopes and dreams will come alive in paradise

Memories of you and me
The many in love
Tell me I'll always be in paradise

You are the sun, I am the sky together we'll live in paradise
Our hopes and dreams will come alive in paradise

You are the sun, I am the sky together we'll live in paradise
Our hopes and dreams will come alive in paradise",In Paradise,2004
