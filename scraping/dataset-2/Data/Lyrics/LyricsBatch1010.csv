Simone Sommerland,"Ein Männlein steht im Walde ganz still und stumm
Es hat von lauter Purpur ein Mäntlein um
Sagt, wer mag das Männlein sein
Das da steht im Wald allein
Mit dem purpurroten Mäntelein?

Das Männlein steht im Walde auf einem Bein
Und hat auf seinem Haupte schwarz' Käpplein klein
Sagt, wer mag das Männlein sein
Das da steht im Wald allein
Mit dem kleinen schwarzen Käppelein?

La la lala lala la
La la la

Kann nur die Hagebutte sein",Ein Männlein steht im Walde,2011
Simone Sommerland,"Es klappert die Mühle am rauschenden Bach
Klipp, klapp! (Klipp, klapp!)
Bei Tag und bei Nacht ist der Müller stets wach
Klipp, klapp! (Klipp, klapp!)

Und haben wir dieses, so hat's keine Not!
Klipp, klapp, klipp, klapp, klipp, klapp!

Flink laufen die Räder und drehen den Stein
Klipp, klapp! (Klipp, klapp!)

Und mahlen den Weizen zu Mehl uns so fein
Klipp, klapp! (Klipp, klapp!)
Der Bäcker dann  Zwieback und kuchen draus bäckt
Der immer den Kindern besonders gut schmeckt
Klipp, klapp, klipp, klapp, klipp, klapp!
(Klipp, klapp, klipp, klapp, klipp, klapp!)

Wenn reichliche Körner das Ackerfeld trägt
Klipp, klapp! (Klipp, klapp!)
Die Mühle dann flink ihre Räder bewegt
Klipp, klapp! (Klipp, klapp!)
Und schenkt uns der Himmel nur immerdar Brot

Simone Sommerland,"Hänschen klein ging allein in die weite Welt hinein
Stock und Hut stehen ihm gut, ist gar wohlgemut
Aber Mutter weinet sehr, hat ja nun kein Hänschen mehr
„Wünsch' dir Glück“ sagt ihr Blick, „Kehre bald zurück“

Sieben Jahr' trüb und klar, Hänschen in der Fremde war
Da besinnt sich das Kind, eilt nach Haus' geschwind
Doch nun ist's kein Hänschen mehr, nein ein großer Hans ist er
Braungebrannt, Stirn und Hand, wird er wohl erkannt 

Eins, zwei, drei, gehen vorbei, wissen nicht wer das wohl sei

Sie kamen an ein Häuschen von Pfefferkuchen fein

Hu, hu, da schaut eine alte Hexe raus
Lockte die Kinder ins Pfefferkuchenhaus
Sie stellte sich gar freundlich, o Hänsel, welche Not!
Ihn wollt sie braten im Ofen braun wie Brot!

Simone Sommerland,"Wer hat die schönsten Schäfchen?
Die hat der goldne Mond
Der hinter jenen Bäumen
Am Himmel oben wohnt

Er kommt am späten Abend
Wenn alles schlafen will
Hervor aus seinem Hause
Am Himmel leis und still

Dann weidet er die Schäfchen
Auf seiner blauen Flur
Denn all die weißen Sterne
Sind seine Schäfchen nur

Sie tun sich nichts zuleide
Hat eins das andre gern
Und Schwestern sind und Brüder
Da droben Stern an Stern

Und soll ich dir eins bringen
So darfst du niemals schreien
Musst freundlich wie die Schäfchen
Und wie die Schäfer sein",Wer hat die schönsten Schäfchen,2012

Mädchen können nicht tanzen, denn ihr habt doch keinen Groove

Da, wo Mädchen sind, ist Wüste, alles lahm, gar nichts los
Hab schon eingeschlafene Füße
Wenn Mädchen rappen, seh ich rot

Für diese richtig dünnen Worte hast du richtig fett geübt
Du bist ja völlig außer Atem, geh mal duschen, denn du glühst

Simone White,"They're always writing songs about a summer love
That never seems to last beyond the fall
But I've a different reason for crying this season
A reason that can hurt you most of all

I didn't have any summer romance
Nobody bothered to break my heart in two
While others were fooled by the sweet words
Someone vowed I was the one who made company a crowd

I didn't walk down the beach in a trance
Or listened to little white lies that sounded true
And no one could be as blue as I was in the fall
'Cause I didn't have any summer romance at all

And no one could be as blue as I was in the fall
'Cause I didn't have any summer romance at all

I hate to see that evening sun go down

If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye

I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more
They want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, then this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that will jump start my heart quicker
Then a shot when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating ""Hey""
You waited this long to stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know you got a job Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem is complicating
So the F-C-C won't let me be or let me be me so let me see
They tried to shut me down on M-T-V
But it feels so empty without me
So come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready 'cause this shit is about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, ""Fuck you, Debbie!""

'Cause it feels so empty without me

Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells ""bitch""
A visionary, vision is scary,
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the air waves a rebel
So let me just revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
And it's a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass you ask for me
Well I'm back, nana-na na na nana-na na na kshh
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in endin' up
Under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting
""Testing attention please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?

Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby, you can get stomped by Obie
You thirty six year old bald headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let it go its over
Nobody listens to Techno
Now lets go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes this shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy
Hey, there's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It will be so empty without me

Now this looks like a job for me

 I waited long time sweatin it 
 I got jerked but now I'm gettin it 
 Hazy like asthma bizarre disaster 
 Stress almost held me down from bein a master 
 The faster preacher poet a teacher 
 ""It's been so long"" like Monifah 
 Believe that I'm needed, in rappin, I breathe this 
 Some pick up a microphone and can't even achieve this 
 Oscar award winning your shit I'm bored with it 
 Stop copy-catting son (why?) cause your dog did it 
 Get your own lingo, make up your own jingle 
 Ten years later you be bitin my single 
 Primo, take it Downtown, Swing it 
 Intervenin on the board, sensimil steamin, yeah 
 Catch the vibe like a tribal dance 
 In the clubs on the low with the be	-boy stance 
 Money rubbin with a shorty got bumped by a chump 
 Tell him, 'Step off, I'm doin the Hump' 
 Yeah 
 I say it's my world, and I won't stop 
 and if you stand in my way you bound to get dropped 
 Some wish that I was gone cause they know I'ma win 
 In a minute I 'll be makin six G's times ten 
 I'm the computer, printin out data take notes 
 then analyze the information and press send 
 Freaky like porno, Ron Jeremy saw no 
 obstacle or pussy to stop him from bonin a hoe 
 Me and the mic double trouble 
 Chicks look at us like twins, all lovable and huggable 
 Prognosis, on the, mic I choke out 
 Had the same effects from coughin blowin smoke out 
 Architect, rap technician, man listen 
 It's no doubt you gonna pump this in your system 
 My skills ill, and all of that above 
 Confidence, I'm not worried bout a street buzz 
 I'm O.C., who you? I never heard of ya 
 Get out my face 'fore I turn into a motherfuckin murderer 
 I want the green like indo, a mansion, a car 
 A wife who's never been a bimbo 
 Too much to ask well to me that's simple 
 want to retire on a yacht called the S. S. Minnow

 And if you stand in my way, you bound to get dropped

 Top choice, this here nigga got poise 
 Ain't a man alive who could stop my noise 
 I snatch a star from the sky, spark up your lye 
 You stand astounded wonderin how I did it 
 Now you're star struck, like I truck gold 
 Treatin me like a nigga havin a million records sold 
 Now a starchild, phenmonen like the X-Files 
 Rappers know I'm comin so they go in exile 
 Czar in this rap shit, comin on your mattress 
 Microphone fiend I make beats do backflips 
 Fear me like genocide, serious 
 How I do it through your stereo, mysterious 
 O.C. do demolition, nil competition 
 Like robot Kong on a destroy mission 
 A matter of life and death you try to fight for breath 
 I snatch your heart from a slice through your chest 
 Who the best, from New York to Bogota 
 Who got face thinkin they scare me with a scar, shit 
 What I be bringin is a terrible sight 
 A performance never again performed on the mic 
 I say it's my world, and I won't stop

So I snatched my booty back

You know you can't be me
I be the one, it ain't two now
And you know it's true

Now move on
I got the fellas jealous cause I flows like none
I got the whole nine, need not pack a gun
No need for greed, see I takes then I feeds 
To the young, sprung on the air that I breathe
You can't concieve how I braids and I weaves
Hear you over there, may appear
Some fear for the smear
We're gonna have in abundance
I write, see I write, see I write

Plop on up and fetch a fierce self-check
I digs how my voice takes muthafuckas over
Trick, back it up 'fore I buck, buck another
Pass me the present cause the future can't hold my soul
I pump fear in the mere mortal, beast control
I blast, punk, that ass fast
Feel the funk, savor 'fore you face defeat
My backbone of stone totes treats to beats

Adapt to my taps, I'm two snaps
I'm too through, ooh, I'm too through
I kicks butt, strut as I gluts for fame
And goes 'can't nobody hold me'

You falls too short, so I be tall in your acetone
Death died so I'm here to stake my claim

Give it up, I funk it up, chick, I spits hits
Look back, you ain't stacked, get to face this
Who's bad? My notepad are flamin' folks
Fire, on fire, koombaya, beaucoup funk
Now pump that in your tire, like that
Terry, bring it back, bring it back like that

Got no time to shoot the shit in no fashion
Pardon my French, I'll kick your ass - me no favor

Come back mary, you've been away so long

And your father's calling, come on home
Won't you come on home, won't you come on home

Come back people, you've been gone a while
And the war is raging, in the emerald isle
That's flesh and blood man, that's flesh and blood

Won't you come on home, won't you come on home

And up on the catwalk there's one thousand postcards
From montevideo, say that I'll be home soon
Get out of bombay and go up to brixton and look around, to see just what is missing
And up on the catwalk, girls call for mother and dream of their boyfriends
And I don't know why

I will be there, I will be there, I will be there
I will be there, I will be there
Tonight, under the crystal light, I'll tell you everything I need
Tonight, under the crystal light, surrender everything to me

Up on the catwalk, and you dress in waistcoats
And got brilliantino, and friends of kim philby
You float through the night time, like manna from heaven
But what, what do I know, and just what do I know
And up on the catwalk, in sweat that glistens
And I don't know why and I don't know why
I don't know why

I will be there, I will be there, I will be there
I will be there, I will be there
Tonight, under the crystal light, I'll tell you everything I need

I don't know why.

Satellites come crashing down
I see them falling out the skies like eagles
All mirrored glass and shattered egos
But in a corner of the world we'd meet to laugh and drink and plan our sequels
'Cause in the alleyways and bars downtown
They're singing up from here to there can we go
This city comes alive at night, see these city walls are heaving
And if these old city walls should crash, amid the rubble you'd find us breathing
Come say what you see in me
'Cause boy, I believe in you
Come say what you're seeing
All gone just ghost dancing, going all the way through

You talk about the Lebanon
You tell me 'bout the Dawn in Eden
You talk about South Africa
I tell you about the Irish children
You say one more Polish Knight could come and blow away the doors to Freedom
And if Mother Ethiopia could blow away the tears that we see run
O blow them away, 
Blow, blow away
We Will blow them away

The car pulled up, the girl she jumped in
The boy he wore a medal that was shining from his skin
With the windows pulled up, their radio tuned in
She's hitting from the stars, he's hitting for the moon

Died of a big disease with a litte name
By chance his girlfriend came across a needle
And soon she did the same
At homethere are seventeen-year-old boys
And their idea of fun
Is being in a gang called The Disciples
High on crack, totin' a machine gun

Hurricane Annie ripped the ceiling off a church
And killed everyone inside
You turn on the telly and every other story
Is tellin' you somebody died

And we're sending people to the moon
In September my cousin tried Reefer for the very first time
Now he's doing Horse, it's June

And everybody still wants to fly

Neighbours just shine it on
But if a night falls and a bomb falls
Will anybody see the dawn

I've got a heart of stone and it's sinking deep inside

If you can see the lights, shout out where you'll be
Summer's gone and I can't tell you lies

A new life screaming out and I can't miss it

My body's shaking, my body's tired
Hookers to the left of me, killers on the inside

The last train left this station long ago
The headlights shine like diamonds in the snow

Like a travelling man, I'm a travelling man
Run away if you can

Cruel world keeps turning I'm dead on my feet
From the blue icy mountains to the white city heat
Factory fire burns like a phoenix tonight
Spread your wings come on darling

And your eyes search for me but I can't see them
And your sweet mouth it speaks to me but I can't hear it
And your, your sweet smile two thousand miles for your warm kisses
And your sweet child I got one last chance and I can't miss it, no no no no

And a halo round your hair

And the questions there were many
Like how can you survive
When it's the moment
You've been waiting for
This is the moment of your life

So every dreamer pass me by
With a fix me Jesus stare in his eyes
I was born to live
I was born to die
With the queen of soul
And the king of light

Pull me through to the shadowland
I was driven by some hidden hand
It's the greatest gift of all

Shake the ghost within you
Get up, meet up, the rising sun
'cause the old days they're the dying days
And the new day's just begun
At the end of every party
Hear the singer sing his song
May his heart stay young forever
And the dream still lingers on

I want to die
I want to live again
I want to keep on keeping on

But the brave they die just once

I feel the faint vibration in the air
Been taken hostage by the one creation
Anticipate the night that's in your hair

Your smile this trial elates, 
In your eyes I see mothers open gates. 

If fortune could smile 
There'd be room here for two of us 
And I would burn myself through the wires. 
With hate concentrated, unearthed, disparate, in time. 

Once in a while, 
If peace held for two of us, 
If we could show mercy awhile, 
With patience transcending this cold never ending through time.

There's no prize for goodbyes, no joy either, either
You're saying I'm insane, oh that's craziness
Craziness, I'm trying to find
It's real meaning, insanity

When I get home again, everything we said
It seemed to hold us back again, again
When I get home then, we try to make it better
In the same damn way again, again

Enough, I've had enough
Oh in love
I've had enough

Enough, I've had enough
Oh in love, I've had enough
I can't take, we can make it
I can't stay there, I can't
No I'm leaving",Enough [DVD][Live],1989
Simply Red,"Ev'ry time we say goodbye, I die a little
Ev'ry time we say goodbye, I wonder why a little
Why the God's above me who must be in the know
Think so little of me, they allow you to go

When you're near, there's such an air of spring about it
I can hear a lark somewhere waiting to sing about it
There's no love song finer
But how strange the change from major to minor
Ev'ry time we say goodbye

Simply Red,"Grandma's hands
Clapped in church on Sunday morning
Grandma's hands
Played a tambourine so well
Grandma's hands
Used to issue out a warning
She'd say, ""Billy don't you run so fast
Might fall on a piece of glass
""Might be snakes there in that grass""
Grandma's hands

Grandma's hands
Soothed a local unwed mother
Grandma's hands
Used to ache sometimes and swell
Grandma's hands
Used to lift her face and tell her
""Baby, Grandma understands
That you really love that man
Put yourself in Jesus hands""
Grandma's hands

Grandma's hands
Used to hand me piece of candy
Grandma's hands
Picked me up each time I fell
Grandma's hands
Boy, they really came in handy
She'd say, ""Matty don't you whip that boy
What you want to spank him for
He didn't' drop no apple core""

We don't have streets, just pure concrete
I'm not glad when I get home
I'm sad old Red, I don't wanna be alone no more

I go whiter in the face, my feet begin to shake
I go upstairs to that heavenly place
I'm not glad when I get home
I'm sad old Red, I don't wanna be alone no more

Sad old Red sat at home
Sad old Red, living on his own
Sad old Red sat at home
Sad old Red, let me take you home

It's a cubic room, two hole peep through
Shadows on the wall, yeah, yeah, of trees so tall
I think of her again, the joy she used to bring
Lay there in bed, two words she said

She said ""Oh Red""
She said ""Oh Red""
All the time, ""Oh Red""
Every night, ""Oh Red""

Well you've lost all the things
That sharing could bring
Thought you were doing right
But violence and flames
And torches and chains are fueling
These new northern lights

Like prisoners working
On infertile land
Took eight years to find out the score
If you're sick then you're lonely
Out of work then you're hungry
The sentence is four years more

Who says poverty and race
Can be kept in their place?
By keeping it all underground
And ruling the country
Are unfaithful husbands
Who spank little boys gagged and bound?

There's got to be a better way
For you and for me
To turn this hypocrisy 'round
The growth of a nation
Cannot be achieved
By keeping the downtrodden down

You'd knock me off my feet
If I said you're a good girl
You'd bore me off my seat
You'll never see me walking
Down a guilty middle-class street
I'm frequently appalled
By them pretending to be poor men

I'd give you all I can now
I don't have enough arms for you
Ask the people with the real cash
Institutions who are taking yours and mine

I won't feel guilty, I won't feel bad
I won't feel guilty, I won't feel bad

In the literature that I've read
Temporary blindness
Breezing through the fog again
You'll never see me walking
Down a guilty middle-class street

You didn't move, you used me and I used you too

Billie Holiday, Cole Porter
When the only sound in the empty street, 
Is the heavy tread of the heavy feet 
That belong to a lonesome cop 
I open shop. 
When the moon so long has been gazing down 
On the wayward ways of this wayward town. 
That her smile becomes a smirk, 
I go to work. 
Love for sale, 
Appetizing young love for sale. 
Love that's fresh and still unspoiled, 
Love that's only slightly soiled, 
Love for sale. 
Who will buy? 
Who would like to sample my supply? 
Who's prepared to pay the price, 
For a trip to paradise? 
Love for sale 
Let the poets pipe of love 
in their childish way, 
I know every type of love 
Better far than they.

I've been through the mill of love; 
Old love, new love 
Every love but true love

And barely can see through the smoke
At the end of my rope from sellin' that dope
Been makin' them dumb-dums out of soap
And I hope to be a better man
Never did I understand what I had
My attitude mad, young and bad
Fila, Levis still sportin' the sag
Walkin' the streets, lightweight thinkin'
Plottin', worryin' my Mama to death
Want to go home, but somethin' won't let me
'Cause I know she got problems her chest
It's a struggle, a puzzle the pieces so scattered
We find 'em, take your time and put it together
Nigga, quit walkin' around like you're blinded
Put your mind on your money, thug
Don't worry about what you got

Bow my head, askin' the Lord for change
Since I started sellin' 'cane
Shit ain't been the same
Began to acknowledge my bang ways
Who can I blame?
Maybe my pain, dealin' with it by callin' it a phase
These are the last days
Carry no shame, everyday thangs
Went from sellin' cocaine to rockin' the stage
The otherside of the game
Where you're rich, my aim to fame
Strange tradin' places, you're dealin' with races
Just wouldn't it be fate
Runnin' with thug, me never replace this
The Lord, I'd like to thank you for my Mo Thug family
Sincerely yours, Thug Queen (Thug Queen)

I remember my first day out of prison
Y'all, it was just me and my cousin
Takin' a ride in his car
We just went puffin' and sippin' on brews
Trippin' up old trues
Layzie asked me, ""What you gonna do? What you gonna do?""
I said, ""I don't know. I'm gonna take it slow
So gimme a couple of days, and I will let you know.""
I had to collect my mind
Knowin' one day I'm gonna shine
Until that day, I will pray
And try to parlay with the struggle God done dealt me
I know that He'll help me
Through the stormy weather
Our families got together and stay strong
But you gotta keep your head up high
'Cause there ain't no reason
Why you got to let it down
Just look around, we platinum bound (bound, bound)

Everything I ever knew since the day I was born
Consisted strictly of some type of a hustle
While my Mama workin' nine-to-five
On some nights, I be sittin' home alone
'Cause she'd be workin' doubles to survive
Makin' ends meet the best way she knew how
Keepin' food up on the table
Teachin' me the ways of the world - pick your friends
Like you do your fruit
Keep your distance from the playa hater
Pray you never have to shoot
I remember also on somedays there'd be nothin'
In our refrigerator except for a box of baking soda
And empty jar of pickle juice
I often wonder why the Lord
Had to create me in a world, oh so, so cruel
It's dog eat dog, I don't know what else to do
Except for call on God
Put my trust in You
No more, we're warriors.

I remember I went to school
With only about three pairs of pants, holes in my shoes
I guess I know what they mean by cold city blues
Ken bagged the stores
Tryin' to get money the best way I know how
How? Me and my brother up there
'Til hustlin' was no longer allowed
I know it's hard times
I'm learnin' this early to be a man
But since then, Ken Dawg flipped a whole new masterplan
Damn, don't nobody understand, but my family
But look at us now: the plan was to create jams
Ken Dawg, do or die, Mo Thug all the way to my dirt
I know it hurt the way we put in work
Can't do nothin', but ride with it, 'til it's over
From Novas to Range Rovers, we're still soldiers

You see a fellow like me
Done had it through all the wicked madness
Everyday I gotta fight this demon
Sadness take over my world of gladness
Then they want to ask me,
""Why do we all stay so high, fiendin'?""
Come kick it the way we roll
That's if you can handle it, baby
Without you tryin' to hate me, never
No more, so fuck 'em, look at this hate
Now stroll and get on my hustle
To keep my pockets swoll for sure
I collect more of those
Still we prefer takin' bills that fold
To hoes, me and my trues decided
To plot you for your dues
Come through with the battle
Ran through your house
And robbed the people next door
Moved out neighborhood
Now, who would you blame it on?
The ghetto?
Why this old crooked system set up to mess us up
But we come up and never fade the soldiers' ghetto

And I want you to know (ooh, I want you to know)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy)
Ask my folks, just ask my folks (just ask my folks)
And I won't blame it on the rain
(We can't blame it on the rain)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game
I won't blame it on the rain (oh, no, yeah)
I can make it through the pain
To the otherside of the game.

Stormy weather tossin' my boat to and fro
Often to the point of shatterin' senses
I don't know which way to go
Somethin' inside persistin' me to move on
Just maintain, hold on, but my son, just keep it strong
Everything gon' be alright
Keep you're head to the sky
Just as long as you keep it real
And strive to reach the golden prize
Did what I had to do to make it this far
A lot of people got stuck
And I took enough battle scars
Took refuge worldwide to replenish my thought
I was not ready to accept them devilish clout
Drop to my knees, and began to do nothin' but pray
Gradually, life began to change
I'm in this Mo Thug game
We statin' our claim
We statin' our claim
We statin' our claim
We statin' our claim

Would you forgive me, Lord
If I killed that man - that man
That tried to run up and rob me blindly
And leave me for dead was his intent?
But, Lord, I may be like that on the outside
Inside I'm one that's searchin' for peace
Right, as we ride deep
And seek holy scriptures, believe
Rollin', nobody knows what it is or who we approachin'
Just strollin', trustin' in the Lord (in the Lord)
As we struggle to make it each day, baby
You can believe that they keep gettin' harder with the time
With haters and evil
And sometimes it's even my people
And it feel like I'm losin' my mind
Fire, you need to burn this entire evil, evil empire

And I want you to know (to know)
That through the rain, cloudy skies
And the thunderbolts, it ain't easy

Through the thunderbolts)

Ain't no familiars in this place where I'm slingin' it from
I got wholesale weight, that low-sale weight
Or any kind of weight that make my dough flow stright

I spit vodka, ain't sober man (say what?)
I'm a bigger guy, need extra pay
Give me a bed so I can lay in my Escalade
You could be black, Puerto Rican or Dominican
Room 219, I don't care, send it in
I'm a jiggy guy, ride one plus the five
Make it a six, big bad son of a bitch

[Chorus: x 2]

[Magoo]
Sin got the Alize from home
Give me Lifestyles, put 'em on my jimmy, it's on
And peep out my manuscript
Mag and Tim party hoes so you gots to strip
And I ain't playin games when I heart
And leave Mag hangin hard suit with Christopher Darden
I take about a hour to bust
Chickens want to get with Mag so they makin a fuss
Told 'em, ""simmer down, you're next
Take my headphones, listen to Funkmaster Flex
I'll be about a minute or less
Stop sittin clothes on, take off your dress""

[Chorus: x 2]

Sin,"Forward yesterday makes me wanna stay
What they said was real makes me wanna steal
Living under house guess I'm living I'm a mouse
All's I gots is time got no meaning just a rhyme

Take time with a wounded hand 'cause it likes to heal
Take time with a wounded hand 'cause I like to steal
Take time with a wounded hand 'cause it likes to heal,
I like to steal

I'm half the man I used to be (this feeling as the dawn it fades to gray)

Feeling uninspired think I'll start a fire
Everybody run bobby's got a gun
Think you're kinda neat then she tells me I'm a creep
Friends don't mean a thing guess I'll leave it up to me.

Take time with a wounded hand 'cause it likes to heal
Take time with a wounded hand 'guess I like to steal
Take time with a wounded hand 'cause it likes to heal,
I like to steal

I'm half the man I used to be (this feeling as the dawn it fades to gray)

Sin,"Question to question
Answer to answer
There's no solution
Just one solution
My self-made suicide
One step to insanity
I feel higher than you

Devil bless me
I feel higher than you
You don't have to forgive me
Another matter
Another injection
The trip seems long
I'm bored and tired
And now I'm falling
Into madness again",Dub01,2004
Sin Bandera,"Caminando veo la vida 
Veo que va desentendida, 
Sin preocupación  
Veo que sin razón el mundo 
Nos aplasta en un segundo, 
Esconde el amor 

Lo que necesito es dejarme descubrir 
Lo único que quiero es detenerme junto a ti 
Aún no te conozco 
Y ya te puedo distinguir 
Quiero hallarte para amarte 

Estás en cada paso, 
En cada instante, 
Siénteme, te puedo tocar 
Y cada vez que mire hacia delante 
Tu mirada me llevará 

Dibujando veo el futuro 
Como un niño me aventuro 
A la imaginación 

Ese mundo sin bandera 
Siempre con la fe de fuera 
Hoy ya no es ilusión  

Lo que necesitas es dejarte descubrir, 
Lo único que quiero es detenerme junto a ti 
Aún no te conozco 
Y ya te puedo distinguir 
Quiero hallarte para amarte 

Cerca te llevo de mí 
Tú eres quien me haré sentir 
Que si a veces duele la vida 
No duele si voy a encontrarte.",A Encontrarte,2002
Sin Bandera,"Buenas noches
Mucho gusto, eras una chica mas
Después de cinco minutos
Ya eras alguien especial
Sin hablarme
Sin tocarme algo dentro se encendió
En tus ojos 
Se hacía tarde y me olvidaba del reloj

Estos días 
A tu lado me enseñaron que en verdad
No hay tiempo determinado
Para comenzar a amar
Siento algo 
Tan profundo que no tiene explicación
No hay razón ni lógica en mi corazón

Entra en mi vida
Te abro la puerta
Sé que en tus brazos ya no habrá noches desiertas
Entra en mi vida
Yo te lo ruego
Te comencé por extrañar
Pero empecé a necesitarte luego

Buenas noches
Mucho gusto, ya no existe nadie más
Después de este tiempo juntos
No puedo volver atrás
Tú me hablaste
Me tocaste y te volviste mi ilusión
Quiero que seas dueña de mi corazón

Entra en mi vida
Te abro la puerta
Sé que en tus brazos ya no habrá noches desiertas
Entra en mi vida
Yo te lo ruego
Te comencé por extrañar
Pero empecé a necesitarte luego

Entra en mis horas
Sálvame ahora
Abre tus brazos fuerte
Y déjame entrar

Entra en mi vida
Te abro la puerta
Sé que en tus brazos ya no habrá noches desiertas (no más noches desiertas)
Entra en mi vida
Yo te lo ruego (yo te lo ruego)
Te comencé por extrañar
Pero empecé a necesitarte luego

Te comencé por extrañar
Pero empecé a necesitarte luego",Entra en Mi Vida,2002
