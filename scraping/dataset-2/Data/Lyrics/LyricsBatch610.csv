Liza Minnelli,"Thank you very much, you're really terrific
And seeing how you are, can I tell ya something, I have a problem
No wait, it's not a big problem, but it is a problem
It's my name, you know I find that still - a lot of people call me Lisa - Wrong
My name is Liza - Liza - has a 'Z' in it
Well, for instance, somebody'll come up to me on the street and say
Hello Lisa how are you, I'll say, I'm fine thank you but it's Liza
Or somebody'll say - Lisa what a nice hat you have on
I'll say thank you very much but my name is Liza and that's my hair
So you can see what I mean
Anyway, I've been trying to figure out a final solution to this whole thing
And I think I've come up with the answer - Jack

It's Liza with 'Z' not Lisa with an 'S', 'Cause Lisa with an 'S' goes SSno'ZZ
It's 'Z' instead of 'S', 'Lie' instead of 'Lee', It's simple as can be, see, Liza
I'll do it again
It's Liza with 'Z' not Lisa with an 'S', 'Cause Lisa with an 'S' goes SSno'ZZ
It's 'Z' instead of 'S', 'Lie' instead of 'Lee', It's simple as can be, see, Liza

Now - if my name were Ada, I'd be Ada, even backwards I'd be Ada
Or if my name were Ruth, then I'd be Ruth because with Ruth what can you do
Or Sally, or Margaret or Ginger or Faye
But when you're a Liza you always have to say

Nn - It's Liza with 'Z' not Lisa with an 'S', 'Cause Lisa with an 'S' goes SSno'ZZ
It's 'Z' instead of 'S', 'Lie' instead of 'Lee', It's simple as can be, see, Liza

Ah - And that is only half of it - there's another way they treat me cruelly
How often I remember someone saying, there",Liza with a Z,1995
Liza Minnelli,"Tu vis dans un silence éternel et muet,
où je traduis tes regards et lis dans tes sourires,
interprétant les mots que tes mains veulent dire
dans ton langage étrange qui semble être un ballet..
Un émouvant ballet que tu règles pour moi
de gestes façinants qui ne sont jamais les mêmes
et quand du bout des doigts tu murmures je t'aime,
j'ai l'impression parfois comme entendre ta voix..
Mon amour, mon amour, mon amour,

mon émouvant amour, mon merveilleux amour, mon déchirant amour
Comme pour te parler, je manquai de moyens me trouvant près de toi,
comme en terre étrangère, ne pouvant me servir d'aucun vocabulaire,
à mon tour j'ai appris le langage des mains, tu ris un peu de moi,
car je suis maladroit, et fais souvent des gaffes,
je n'ai jamais été très fort en orthographe,
mais j'ai tant à te dire et je t'aime si fort..
Mon amour, mon amour, mon amour, mon émouvant amour,
mon merveilleux amour, mon déchirant amour.. x2",Mon Emouvant Amour,1995
Liza Minnelli,"Hey, old friend
What d'ya say, old friend?
Are you okay, old friend?
Are we, are we unique?

Time goes by
Everything else keeps changing
You and I, we can
Continue next week, yeah

Most friends fade
Or they don't make the grade
New ones are quickly made
And in a pinch, sure, they'll do

But us, old friend
What's to discuss, old friend?
Here's to us, who's like us?
Damn few",Old Friend,1995
Liza Minnelli,"Moi certains soirs quand je m'ennuie
Je connais un coin dans Paris
Où l'on se rencontre entre amis
Pour faire une jam

Chacun prenant son instrument
Qu'il soit à corde ou bien à vent
Laisse parler son tempérament
Pour faire une jam

Comme je ne suis pas musicien
Mais que vraiment j'aime ça
Je rythme en frappant dans mes mains et chante
Ta ba da ba da ba da ba da

Car quand on est dans cette ambiance
Les mots n'ont aucune importance
Le principal c'est que ça balance
Pour faire une jam

On perd en l'éclair d'un instant
La notion du lieu et du temps
Et l'on oublie ses embêtements
Pour faire une jam

C'est l'heure, l'heure de l'improvisation
Des chorus et des citations
Car on se donne avec passion
Pour faire une jam

Nos aînés ne trouvent pas normales
Ces explosions de joie
Mais au fond que fait-on de mal en chantant
Ta ba da ba da ba da ba da

En bras de chemise parce qu'on a chaud
On se donne à fond les yeux mi-clos
Car plus ça chauffe et mieux ça vaut
Pour faire une jam

Nos peines, nos joies, nos ivresses
Danses et rythmes se reconnaissent
Il faut la foi de la jeunesse
Pour faire une jam

La batterie roule, la basse craque
Le piano chante, les cuivres attaquent
De toutes parts les notes claquent
Pour faire une jam

Quand on a le jazz dans le sang
Et jusqu'au bout des doigts
Et que l'on est pris cent pour cent, on chante
Ta ba da ba da ba da ba da

Au petit jour, sur le trottoir
Les traits tirés, le teint blafard
Comme à regret on se sépare
En se disant remplis d'espoir
Salut les gars à un de ces soirs
Pour faire une jam",Pour Faire une Jam,1995
Liza Minnelli,"Whether you are here or yonder
Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander
I'm growing fonder of you

Even though your friends forsake you
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you
Give you the break you need

More than you know, more than you know
Man of my heart I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right, whether you're wrong
Man of my heart I'll string along
You need me so
More than you'll ever know

Loving you the way that I do
There's nothing I can do about it
Loving may be all you can give
But honey I can't live without it

Oh, how I'd cry, oh, how I'd sigh
If you got tired and said ""Goodbye""
More than I'd show
More than you'd ever know",More Than You Know,1996
Liza Minnelli,"Chances are 'cause I wear a silly grin
The moment you come into view
Chances are you think that I'm in love with you

Just because my composure sort of slips
The moment that your lips meet mine
Chances are you think my heart's your Valentine

In the magic of moonlight when I sigh, ""Hold me close, dear""
Chances are you believe the stars that fill the skies are in my eyes

Guess you feel you'll always be the one and only one for me
And if you think you could
Well, chances are your chances are awfully good

Chances are you believe the stars that fill the skies are in my eyes

Guess you feel you'll always be the one and only one for me
And if you think you could
Well, chances are your chances are awfully good

The chances are your chances are awfully good",Chances Are,1996
Liza Minnelli,"Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you!
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me,
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me! 

I love all, the many charms about you!
Above all, I want my arms about you! 

Don't be a naughty baby,
Come to papa, come to papa, do!
My sweet embraceable you!",Embraceable You,1996
Liza Minnelli,"When the sun is high in the afternoon sky
You can always find something to do
But from dusk till dawn as the clock ticks on
Something happens to you

In the wee small hours of the morning
While the whole wide world is fast asleep
You lie awake and think about the boy
And never ever think of counting sheep

When your lonely heart has learned its lesson
You'd be his if only he'd call
In the wee small hours of the morning
That's the time you miss him most of all

When your lonely heart has learned its lesson
You'd be his if only he'd call
In the wee small hours of the morning
That's the time you miss him most of all",In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning,1996
Liza Minnelli,"It had to be you, it had to be you;
I wandered around, and finally found - the somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me be blue;
And even be glad, just to be sad, thinking of you.

Some others I've seen, might never be mean;
Might never be cross, or try to be boss,
But they wouldn't do.
For nobody else, gave me a thrill - with all your faults, I love you still.
It had to be you, wonderful you;
It had to be you.",It Had to Be You,1996
Liza Minnelli,"Never let me go
Love me much too much
If you let me go
Life would lose its touch

What would I be without you?
There's no place for me without you

Never let me go
I'd be so lost if you went away
There'd be a thousand hours in the day
Without you I know

Because of one caress my world was overturned
At the very start, all my bridges burned
By my flaming heart you'd never leave me, would you?
You couldn't hurt me, could you?

Never let me go
Never let me go

Never let me go
I'd be so lost if you went away
There'd be a thousand hours in the day
Without you I know

Liza Minnelli,"You stepped out of a dream
You are too wonderful to be what you seem!
Could there be eyes like yours, 
Could there be lips like yours
Could there be smiles like yours, 
Honest and truly?
You stepped out of a cloud
I want to take you away, away from the crowd
And have you all to myself, 
Alone and apart out of a dream, 
Safe in my heart
 
You stepped out of a dream
You are too wonderful to be what you seem!

Liza Minnelli,"What good is sitting, alone in your room? 
come hear the music play! 
Life is a cabaret, old chum! 
Come to the cabaret! 
Put down the knitting, the book and the broom 
It's time for a holiday 
Life is a cabaret, old chum! 
Come to the cabaret! 

Come taste the wine 
Come hear the band 
Come blow your horn

To wipe every smile away 
Life is a cabaret , old chum! 
So come to the cabaret! 

I used to have this girlfriend known as Elsie 
With whom I shared for sordid rooms in Chelsea 
She wasn't what you call a blushing flower 
As a matter of fact she rented by the hour. 

The day she died the neighbors 
came to snick her 
Well, that is what comes from 
Too much pills and liquor. 

But when I saw her laid out like a queen 
She was the happiest corpse I´d ever seen 
I think of Elsie till this very day 
I remember how she´d turned to me and say, 

What good is sitting all alone in your room? 
Come hear the music play 
Life is a cabaret, old chum! 
Come to the cabaret! 

And as for me 
HA
And as for me 
I made my mind up back in Chelsea 
When I go.........
I'm going like Elsie.

Liza Minnelli,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon!

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon,1997
Liza Minnelli,"I was created for one man alone
It wasn't easy to find
Now that I found him, I wonder just how
I could have lived right up to now

Now that I am something completed by you
I am no one, just part of two

Don't ever leave me, now that you're here
Here is where you belong
Ev'rything seems so right when you're near
When you're away it's all wrong

I'm so dependent, when I need comfort
I always run to you
Don't ever leave me, 'cause if you do
I'll have no one to run to

Don't ever leave me alone",Don't Ever Leave Me,1997
Liza Minnelli,"All you preachers
Who delight in panning the dancing teachers,
Let me tell you there are a lot of features
Of the dance that carry you through
The gates of Hea-ven.
It's madness
To be always sitting around in sadness,
When you could be learning the steps of gladness.
You'll be happy when you can do
Just six or seven;
Begin to day!
You'll find it nice,
The quickest way to paradise.
When you practice,
Here's the thing to know,
Simply say as you go

[Chorus]
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step ev'ry day!
I'm gonna get there at any price;
Stand aside, I'm on my way !
I've got the blues
And up above it's so fair.
Shoes ! Go on and carry me there !
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step ev'ry day.

Ev'ry new step
Helps a bit ; but any old kind of two step,
Does as well. It don't matter what step you step,
If you work it into your soul
You'll get to Heaven.
Get bu-sy ;
Dance with Maud the countess, or just plain Lizzy:
Dance until you're blue in the face and dizzy.
When you've learn'd to dance in your sleep
You're sure to win out.
In time you'll get Saint Vitus dance,
Which beats the latest thing from France.
Take no chances on this Paradise ;
Let me give you advice.

In a spot of light stands the singer
Then the band begins and the beat is strong
And the room belongs to the singer

All the people turn to hear her sad refrain
And catch the cry of pain that's in her song
But in her haunted face and in her searching eyes
There is a sign that something's wrong

Now the eager crowd hangs on every word
But the sounds are slurred by the singer
Til' the people feel every aching part 
Of the broken heart of the singer

Still the song goes on about a love she knew
That seemed so sure, so true, but turned out wrong
And from the tears she shows nobody really knows
Is she the singer or the song
Is she the singer or the song

As the sad song ends she hits the final note
It catches in her throat but comes out strong
And as she bows and goes, nobody really knows

It could be Oedipus Rex
Where a chap kills his father and causes lots of bother.
The clerk who is thrown out of work
By the boss who is thrown for a loss
By the skirt who is doing him dirt

It might be a fight like you see on the screen
A swain getting slain for the love of a queen
Some great Shakespearean scene
Where a ghost and a prince meet, and everyone ends in mincemeat.

Come taste the wine
Come hear the band
Come blow that horn

What could permitting some prophet of doom
To wipe every smile away
Life is a cabaret, old chum
So come to the cabaret

I used to have this girlfriend known as Elsie
With whom I shared four sordid rooms in Chelsea
She wasn't what you'd call a blushing flower
As a matter of fact she rented by the hour

The day she died the neighbors came to snicker
""Well, that's what comes from too much pills and liquor""
But when I saw her laid out like a Queen
She was the happiest corpse, I'd ever seen

I think of Elsie to this very day
I remember how she'd turn to me and say
""What good is sitting all alone in your room?
Come hear the music play
Life is a cabaret, old chum
Come to the cabaret

And as for me
And as for me
I made my mind up, back in Chelsea
When I go, I'm going like Elsie

Have tired and tied me with innocent guile
I would have walked out and after all the tears we shed
I should have stalked out gone and painted the town bright red but instead

And you say you never believed in luck

Liza Minnelli,"Remind me not to find you so attractive
Remind me that the world is full of men
When I start to miss you, to touch your hand, to kiss you
Remind me to count to ten

I had a feeling when I met you
You'd drive me crazy if I let you
But all my efforts to forget you
Remind me I'm in love again

Not to mention that I love you

To be sorry that we met
Although I adore you, remind me to ignore you
You're one thing I will regret
So when your charm begins to blind me
I'll simply tie my hands behind me
Don't let me kiss you, please remind me
Unless, my darling, you forget",Remind Me,2010
Liza Minnelli,"Maybe it was the music, or the glamorous sky of blue.
Maybe it was the mood I was in or maybe it was really you, really you.

This heart of mine was doing very well.
The world was fine as far as I could tell.
And then quite suddenly I saw you, and I dreamed of gay amor.
At dawn I'll wake up singing sentimental overtures.

This heart of mine is gayly dancing now.
I taste the wine of real romancing now.
Somehow this crazy world has taken on a wonderful design.
As long as life endures, it's yours this heart of mine.

I feel like Christopher Columbus when I'm near enough to contemplate
The sweet geography descending from your eyebrow to your toe
The possibilities are more than I can possibly enumerate
That's why you fascinate me so

So sermonize and preach to me
Make your sanctimonious little speech to me
But oh my darling you forgive my inability to concentrate
I think I'm dealing with a powder keg that's just about to blow
Will the end result deflate me, or will you annihilate me

Every time we say goodbye, I wonder why a little,
Why the Gods above me, who must be in the know.
Think so little of me, they allow you to go.

When you're near, there's such an air of spring about it,
I can hear a lark somewhere, begin to sing about it,
There's no love song finer, but how strange the change from major to minor,

He/She may be near or ever so far away

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Sharing all the joys we used to know

And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye

Should I go on whistling in the dark,

Lizz Wright,"Dream of a land my soul is from 
I hear a hand stroke on a drum 

Elegant boy 
Beautiful girl 
Dancing for joy
Delicate whirl
Shades of delight
Cocoa hue
Rich as a night
Afro blue

Two young lovers dance face to face
With undulating grace
They gently sway
Then slip away
To some secluded place

Whispering trees
Echo their sighs
Passionate pleas
Tender replies
Shades of delight
Cocoa hue
Rich as a night
Afro blue

Lovers on flight
Upward they glide
Burst at the height
Slowly subside

And my slumbering fantasy assumes reality
Until it seems it?s not a dream
The two are you and me
Shades of delight
Cocoa hue
Rich as the night
Afro blue

Oh shades of delight
Cocoa hue
Rich as the night

You found the waterfalls with treasures in me

What is this strange happiness?

Shining hours were brief
Winter is over
Summer is near
Are we stronger than we believe?

I walked through halls of reputation
Among the infamous too
As the camera clings to the common thread
Beyond all vanity
Into a gaze to shoot you through

Is the kindness we count upon
Hidden in everyone?

I stepped out in a sunlit grove
Although deep down I wished it would rain
Washing away all the sadness and tears
That will never fall so heavily again

Is the kindness we count upon
Is hidden in everyone

Felt wind sweeping over my face
I ran up through the rocks to the old

They congregate around the Metropole.
They wear fancy ties and laces,

They all have got an ace down in the hole!

And that is their ace in the hole,
And others have friends on the old Tenderloin;
That's their old ace in the hole.

Lizzo,"In the quiet of my room
I gather up my thoughts and questions
Could I ever be like you?
Could I ever be a person, so real and so true?
It seems implausible
I look at my reflection
If only I could say
The things I never mention
The things you never knew

And I'd like to thank you for the human I've become
I'm sorry if I've let you down
I'm trying, I'm learning as I stumble along
To see this new world without your eyes

Once upon a time there was a girl who so much loved the world
She gave her only begotten sunshine
And dried her stained eyes on a neck tie
Took the best lies made 'em truths
And spit sad soliloquies in the booth
'Cause people think they know but they barely knew
The reality of what the other-siders do
But I've been there, I've learned that
Seen a whole bunch of world and done came back
Got a reckoning for wrecking in my knapsack
'Bout to journey on foot through the outback
GRRRL PRTY is the label on my snapback
Doin' worldwide shows in a black hat
'Bout to tell your ass a story so take that
Free prophecies from a black cat

Seen his demise with a pair of brand new eyes
It was sickening, guy
Never wanted to be stickin' it to thickening thighs
But now he deeper than the secrets that he keep with a lie
""Mm, tastes good!"" baby say with a cry
Now wait
Thinkin' about it too much, too much
Deepen the profit sooner, sooner
He never wanted to be a loser
But the bruises of losing is oozing through his fingers
The tips that like to brush at my hips
Is now at the hilt of a sword, Lord
On the battlefield, torn, sworn
To never think about another lover
Hopin' he had time to recover but nothing's ever easy
Beware the sting of queen bee (Grr!)

And I'd like to thank you for the human I've become
I'm sorry if I've let you down
I'm trying, I'm learning as I stumble along
To see this new world without your eyes

So many things in he I would like to be
Wiser, more light on my feet
I could look up in the mirror and change me
Or right over my shoulder and save me
Thinkin' about back, back when, when I ain't have nothing
Not a thing or a ring to my name
Now my feet in the game, knee deep, don't speak
Feelin' like Gwen Stefani in this thing
But I can't complain 'cause we asked for this
Feelin' like a workaholic or a masochist
Don't call like I should like it's sacrilege
To make a dollar in a dream into packed venues
Take a second, put your shield down
Laying down my sword, getting off the battlefield now
Makin' bigger moves, bigger pictures in my view now
Get up out of my way I've got ammo for days, pow!

I can feel the weight of wars you've lost
They're victories in my eyes
Every swing you take brings me closer and closer
Open the gates and I'm poised to charge
You told me we'd never get this far
Now we at the final round
There's no way we'll escape battle scars
Battle scars

And I'd like to thank you for the human I've become
I'm sorry if I've let you down
I'm trying, I'm learning as I stumble along
To see this new world without your eyes",New Eyes,2014

Mommy told me something
A little kid should know
It's all about the devil
And I learned to hate him so
She said he causes trouble when you let him in your room
He'll never ever leave you if your heart is filled with gloom
Chorus:
So let the sun shine in
Face it with a grin
Smilers never lose
And Frowners never win
So let the sun shine in
Face it with a grin
Open up your heart and let the sun shine in
When you are unhappy
The devil wears a grin
But oh he starts to run in
When the light comes prowling in
I know he'll be unhappy
Cause I'll never wear a frown
Maybe if we keep on smiling
He'll get tired of hanging 'round
If I forget to say my prayers
The devil jumps with glee
But he feels so awful awful
When he sees me on my knees
So if you feel of trouble
And you never seem to move
Just open up your heart and let the sun shine in
(Chorus)
Suuuuun Shiiiiiine iiiiiin
Suuuuun Shiiiiiine iiiiiin
Mommy told me someting
A little kid should know
It's all about the devil
And i learned to hate him so
If I forget to say my prayers

But he feels so awful awful
When he sees me on my knees
So if you feel of trouble
And you never seem to move
Just open up your heart and let the sun shine in

Lizzy Borden,"The walls are thin, the voices echo through her silent room
A door slams shut, the shouting follows soon
Those deafening familiar screams
Alcoholic haze, lipstick trace a place where lights are low
While mother can't pretend she doesn't know
Hearing all the retread lies
Banning all the reasons why
Bloody Mary, can't find her way home
Bloody Mary, can't do what she's told
Bloody Mary, always on hold
Something's going on around here
It's just not clear....	
Run away, no one cares if you live or why
Lie on your back and watch the virgin die
Daddy's little girl is gone forever more
Banging on a stone cold door
Bloody Mary, can't find her way home
Bloody Mary, can't  do  what she's told
Bloody Mary, always on hold
Something's going on around here
It's just not clear....	
Razor blades, cut deep into the wrist of emptiness
In a suicidal rage of attentions missed
No one knew you didn't know yourself
Still no one heard your cry for help
Bloody Mary, can't find her way home
Bloody Mary, can't  do  what she's told
Bloody Mary, always on hold
Something's going on around here
Bloody Mary, we didn't want you anyway
Bloody Mary, we didn't ever know what to say

Seeping through you with venomous bliss
Until all lie defenseless, a kiss

So numb we can't feel
Malignant, never will you heal

I won't play hide and go seek under the bed

'Cause you're dead serious
You're dead serious

Watching my hawk eyes, I've been patrolled
Release claws dug so deep let me go
You'd rather see me dead than set me free
You'd lock me up and throw away the key

Green eyes on fire
I won't play misty for your jealous desires

Under the sheets, down below your means
Is where I love to be your only
Tear down the satins, unveil the lace
But you say...
I couldn't bear another someone's trace

I'd scratch her eyes out of her head

Said if you're lonely just give me a call

I'm praying and I know who's the same
I'm studying to become somebody else
When I look at you I see myself
I'm so mixed up, I'm out of luck, my god
I want to believe in you, I want to believe in you
I can't fight my moment of doubt
I want to believe in you, I can't see deceit in you
I can't see the truth through the lies

Now I need you even more
I want to believe in you, I want to believe in you
I know you won't let me down
I want to believe in you, I get confused am I through
Trusting you to be around
And even after midnight I can feel you fade away
Oh my love is strong, my faith has gone astray
And even when you're not here, I fall down and I pray
And even after midnight I can feel you slip away
All your love is gone, my soul has lost the way
And even when you're not here, I still want you anyway

Kindergarten people, they use them, they need them 
The over-indulgent machines were their children 
There wasn't a way down on Earth here to cool them 
'Cause they looked just like humans 
At Kresge's and Woolworth's 
But decadent brains were at work to destroy 
Brats in batallions were ruling the streets 
Saying generation landslide 
Closed the gap between them 
And I laughed to myself at the men and the ladies 
Who never conceived of us billion dollar babies 
Militant mothers hiding in their basements 
Using pots and pans as their shields and their helmets 
Molotov milk bottles heaved from pink high chairs 
While Mother's Lib burned birth certificate papers 
Dad gets his allowance from his sonny the dealer 
Who's pubic to the world but involved in high finance 
Sister's out till five doing banker's son's hours 
But she owns a Maserati that's a gift from his father 
Stopped at full speed at one hundred miles per hour 
The Colgate invisible shield finally got 'em

We were young and we knew, and our eyes were alive
Deep inside we knew our love was true

Can love that's lost be found?

Never knew that what was wrong
Baby, wasn't right

Don't know what's come over you
You've found someone new and
Don't it make my brown eyes blue

I'll be fine when you're gone
I'll just cry all night long
Say it isn't true and
Don't it make my brown eyes blue

Tell me no secrets, tell me some lies
Give me no reasons, give me alibies
Tell me you love me and don't let me cry
Say anything but don't say goodbye

I remember the things that we used to do
a kiss in the rain till the sun shined through.
I tried to deny it, but I'm still in love with you.

I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy,
ever since you went away, every hour of every day.
I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy.
No matter what I say or do, there's just no getting over you.

I can see the love shining in your eyes,
and it comes as such a sweet surprise.
It seems believing is worth the wait,
so hold me and tell me it's not too late.
We're so good together, we're starting forever now.

LL Cool J,"His realm is a new horizon of cuts
They expand from his hand as he conducts
Aim a lot of cool projects not photography
Cut-Creator, Philly-Phil's biography

The lyrical virtual also makes his return
All adversaries should be concerned
Ll Cool J is back again
Allow me to introduce you to my friend Cut-Creator

He circumcises DJ's while he's on the airwaves
Till the missions' complete, you're a musical slave
English revision he endure any collision
Like a searcher with a scalpel, he'll make the head decision
As for me I'll annihilate, eggs, I'll let's 'em communicate
You from rappin' and my lyrics are the best
Slow down the rap but not the subject matter
All you sucker DJ's will scatter
Cut-Crea-tor will employ techniques that will absorb toy boy
The real helper of cuts, Cut-Creator is his name
The boys' so nice, my boat is your strain
You could re-arrange but you don't have the brains
To arrange scratch-padders for the audio change
Not trippin' ah, my tree, for the mental geometry
Just Cool J, that's me, I'm dangerous

""I need a beat""

Yeah I made it, don't look astonished
I had to remind you of what I've accomplished
My scenario, four-door stereo
Up-bein' beat, zero is the ratio
Cut-Creator, LL Cool J
Say Ole, to what we just played
Rappers who don't evade instead we invade
And all competitors will be slayed
Any comment is a compliment
No groups' talent can be the equivalent
Of mine and his combined
Total harmony between the cuts and the rhyme
So why listen the greats by the deaf of the bass
Takin' out every sucker, DJin' the place
A performance underrated, it's not narrated
So Cut-Creators social statics can't be alleviated
He's dangerous

Demolishin' DJ's in under a second
I called an old phrase from my last record
The beat alleviates, the scratch excels
Except I came hear to raise some hell
Searchin' up Sykes and cuts like the blade
He can squeeze a dry sponge and make Kool Aid
I drink at steady, the record turns many
Instead of a needle, he uses a machete
He scuffs the bars a-get you involved
As the record revolves, DJ's dissolve
Musically, physically, mentally he's an innovator
Greater, Cut-Creator is on the cross-fader
So try to digest what I invent
On Farmer's Boulevard is where I rest
I'm numero uno, amigo with an ego
Je pan de la francais, and Italiano
From my projects and I'll inject
Into your ears, a new concept
Conceived in silence, to be unveiled
To the Cool J phenomena, all must hail
I'm dangerous",Dangerous,1985
LL Cool J,"Yo Yvette, there's a lot of rumors goin' around
They're so bad, baby you might have to skip town
See something's smellin' fishy and they say it's you
All I know is that you made it with the whole damn crew
They say you're a man-eater during the full moon
Mascot of the senior boys' locker room
They said Yvette walked in, there wasn't too much rap
Her reputation got bigger, and so did her gap
'Cause girl your momma should of taught you better
I'ma sit down and write you a long letter

Dear Yvette

I'm glad you ain't my sister, then again if you was
I'd have to treat you like you was my distant 'cause
I'm not a news reporter, I don't mean to assume
What should I think? I seen ya comin' out the men's bathroom
You wasn't in there alone, wasn't usin' the phone
The door was locked for twenty minutes, all I heard was moan

Dear Yvette
Dear Yvette
Dear Yvette
Dear Yvette

I don't really know if the story is so
I can either ask Curly, or Larry or Moe
Or Earl, Shabazz, Lou, Mookie or Joe
Like Santa Claus said, you're a ho-ho-ho
In every disco you say hello
Like you're a little angel, but we all know
Since you was eleven you been actin' this way
You always got in bed when you wanted to play
You're a freak, you think you're Lady Godiva
Some freaks are live, but Yvette you're liver

Dear Yvette

Dear Yvette

You're a back-seat queen, a elevator pro
A high-powered body makes your Levis grow
See the stories I've heard, they could amaze
I heard she did it on a motorcycle back in the days
So calm down freak, get a G.E.D.
That's a General Education on Decency
One day you'll see, and agree with me
Unless you're gonna be a freak until you're ninety three
For you there's no fee, everything is free
This is from me to you, not you to me
Every night is your night, your leather pants are tight
You try to shake your butt with all your might
I don't really wanna dis nobody
You might think I had a little too much Bacardi
But that's not the problem, the problem's Yvette
How bad can a girl's reputation get?
See she's the kinda girl all the homeboys met
If you're desperate ask Yvette, 'cause she'll say bet

B-Boys are hard on the boulevard
The Reverend at the church said you was barred
Homeboys on the block loved you a lot
You're a real famous freak whether you like it or not
So before you start walking and your beak starts squawkin'
Let me explain to you who is talkin'
I'm L.L. Cool J from around the way
You boogie down to my records almost every day
Go a hundred miles an hour when you're standin' still
You're faster than my Caddy when it's goin' downhill
Won't forget that day in the Y.M.C.A.
The guy at the desk said it was OK
For you to come inside 'cause he knew you'd stay
Greg G. And Garfield yelled ""Hooray""

I said, ""wait!""
""Yo baby, you wanna come to my crib?""
""Have some donuts and milk?""
""Listen to a pop tune maybe?""

Please be his ex and be my bride
Don't blame it on yourself, sweet thing, you tried
Love you claimed to share just wasn't there
You're too good for that, and it wasn't fair
Love's taken its toll, your heart he stole
You was fooled by the face of a phoney role
But I'll take up the slack, support you, baby
Now the knight in shiny armor can only be me
I cry out your name as you hold his hand
If you're not mine soon, girl, my soul is damned
I'm looking out the window at the stormy rain
And the rush of the water makes my eyes drain
All alone in the room, and it's making me sad
Fantasize of the love we could have had
'Cause I never met anyone like you before
And I can give you more

I pour wine for two, even though it's just me
I tried to reach you, but blind men don't see
Your man is the devil, but he gave you a ring
So you believe you saw an innocent angel sing
You're the type that ignores the destiny of two
It's not Romeo and Juliet, it's me and you
You're being handicapped by a Don Juan rap
You can hope I disappear, girl, but I'll be back
'Cause I never met anyone like you before
And I can give you more, yes girl
I never met anyone like you before
And I can give you more

The time has come, the decision's yours
This super love story ain't working no more
Can't you understand that my love spans
Higher and further than any man
You're looking a gift horse right in the mouth
This time hear me out, I don't care if you pout
You're my only desire, I fight to the death
And I'ma scream your name when I breathe my last breath
Ain't getting on my knees, but I'm oh so close
To our love I toast, all he does is boast
'Cause I never met anyone like you before
And I can give you more

A knock on the door and a tap on the glass
Tells me you see it my way at last
You used to reject me, now you wanna kiss me
He called you up and said, ""Yo baby, why you diss me?""
Meanwhile made romance on the sea shore
You want more of what you used to ignore
During this love affair, girl, it gets steamy
Three nights in a row, and you still wanna see me
Make love at night, coffee in the morn'
I be the only blanket that's keepin you warm
'Cause I never met anyone like you before
And I can give you more, uh

I'm good in the morning to the crack of sunlight
But my agony continues till it reaches night
Sweet image of your face appears on the wall
And the scene is so eerie I run through the hall
I look at the sky, then I search for the moon
Realize it's three o'clock in the afternoon
So I dress to impress, exit the house
Go up to the school and watch the kids come out
In the middle of the court yard there you stand
With the man who's deceiving ya, holding your hand
'Cause I never met anyone like you before
And I can give you more, uh

You're the goddess of light, the queen of seduction
You won't get used if you follow my instructions
Your scram my hand, feel the sweat on my palm
Make love to a man and not a cheap Don Juan
And that'll be eroticism, highs die down
You will find your best friend finally is found
I caress ya at night like a virgin in white
'Cause the new world I found is oh so tight
And tender and young, soft and wet
It's hotter than any fantasy could get
'Cause I never met anyone like you before
And I can give you more

I can give you more
Hey girl, I can give you more
I can give you more
'Cause I never met anyone like you before
And I can give you more",I Can Give You More,1985
LL Cool J,"Look girl, I'm not gonna sing
'Cause I just don't do that

I see you in between class when my mind does a task
One glimpse of your eyes and my heart beats fast
A mysterious fantasy, lovely young queen
You're poll so subtle just like the magazine
Come and visit my sister she's in the livin' room
Eat doughnuts and milk, listen to a pop tune
Used to be my baby-sitter, I want you for my woman
Without you girl, my life is bitter like a lemon

I want you
I want you

I day-dream of seeds girl when you pass by
I wonder what the future holds for you and I
I tell my friends favorite tales about me and you
My total devotion for you is true
See you on the bus I trip as I get on
My body gets warm but my mind is torn
I admit you're the queen of elegant
Maybe I'm just another ""puppy love lucids""
I will tell you straight up, not to load on a letter
Opportunity knocks, I feel I just better
Disappear out of sight, rejection is my fright
To me you're like a drug-boy, easy red light

I want you
I want you

To weak or wreak I can't speak I'm messin' up in school
Just to hear your name girl, it's makes me drool
As you sing ""Full Settle"" on the college choir
My temperature level grows much higher
Spent a night over my house with my sister and friends
I wish you wouldn't treat me like I'm your cousin
Your high-school year book under my pillow
You walk by my window, I see your silhou-ette
Candle light is what I desire
But all I get to do is fix your flat tyre
When you ring my bell, perfume I smell
The aroma pierces through my heart-cell
I tell you that my sister isn't here today
You go away but I wish you'd stay
Yes girl, I'm twistin' around your finger
When you leave your perfume lingers

I want you
I want you

The clock tick-tocks as I lay in my bed
It's visions of you circlin' through my head
I sip lemon, Ice-T, read a magazine
Wish we were involved in a sneaky love scene
Saturday night it's time to party y'all
But an unseen force has my back for the wall
All eyes hit the door, red dress shines loud
The moment has come, my fantasy's' here now
You sip Gin & Tonic with the double-hole straw
Finally I get the nerve to by you one more
The bar tender smirks, I whisper, ""he's a jerk""
I'm wearin' leather pants and a thirty dollar shit
Often usin' double mints, sit back, crack a smile
Tryin' to act like y'all relaxed and not a child
See I'm sixteen and you're in college
Love is sweet, then please give me the knowledge

I want you
I want you

See it's easy to detect a line that's been said
What you don't know is your the woman I've wanted to get
Four years and now I'm here sweet dear
Cool in the snow under a polar bear
I light your cigarette with a Raphael lighter
Your dress seems like it's gettin' tighter and tighter
The ice cubes' melt, the heat is felt
The cards' on the table and my deal is dealt

I want you
I want you

I had to subsequent my soul, cowardness kept a hold on me
And the key was analyzed on my role as a man
To instigate romance not break down and cry
When you ask for a dance
Some fellas talk to her but she walks by
She can only say no, it's not do or die
Like Bedstock, it's natures' way
A sweet love story from LL Cool J

Think ya rockin' it on the floor
You look like a moron!
Who let you in the door?
To put the question bluntly
Maybe your feet's deformed
They should slap you in the teeth
When you put your dancing shoes on
You can't dance!

Why don't you just nail your feet to the floor?
Homeboy, what's the use?
Anytime you wanna step inside a party
First think of an excuse
You dance like a fat old lady
Not sayin' that fat old ladies ain't nice
But every time you try to get one move right
The old lady done did it twice
You can't dance!

You big no dancin', disco disaster
The worst I ever saw
They should drop kick you in the neck
And drag you off the floor
In every discotheque, I see you there
In the middle of the crowd
Looking like you got eight or nine left
Feet dragging all around
You can't dance!

Take my advice, don't move!
You'll never get the knack
If I danced like you I'd sneak out the party
And wouldn't be coming back
On the floor you're a dinosaur
Yeah boy, that's how you move
You look like Ralph Kramden or a Donald Duck cartoon
You can't dance!

You wanna come to my party?
I wouldn't give you a chance
You tried to take breakdance lessons
Ended up in an ambulance
Wouldn't it be funny if they put you on solid gold?
You dance like you got arthritis already
What'll happen when you get old?
You can't dance!

Yeah! Why are you so stiff?
Is it something that your mother did?
Maybe you grew up around ""can't dance"" people
When you were a ""can't dance"" kid
You live in a ""can't dance"" house
Went out in a ""can't dance"" car
Your doofy ""can't dance"" father
Got drunk in a ""can't dance"" bar
You take a ""can't dance"" bath
Put on your ""can't dance"" cologne
Go out to a ""can't dance"" party
So you wouldn't have to ""can't dance"" all alone

LL Cool J,"The momentum of this party can only increase
The design of this rhyme is a masterpiece
You'll want to kick steps to the musical feast
And witness the force I'm about to release
You'll rock!

I'm a professional producer of hip-hop songs
In case you're unaware my beats are always strong
I'll exterminate your crew if I don't like you
with one rhyme I subdue my adversaries are through
I'm the best, fascinatin' my names' Cool J
I'm the royalty of rap, what else can I say
Experienced, rhyme skilled, plus my voice isn't waxed
Funky fresh party rocker, so let's face facts
I'll dust a rapper off if I require practice
Vocal cords so rough that I can eat cactus
Choreographer of rhymes, best of all times
Composition technician with the be	-boy's mind
Terrorizin' emcee's instructions in my path
Make your girlfriend ask me for my autograph
I'm the mic dominater, best of all times
And you ain't heard nothin' till you heard J rhyme
You'll rock!

Now I'ma tell you the mean behind the scratchin' sounds
He's Cut-Creator, Philly-Philly as the DJ crown
Me and him are imitatin' but never underatin'
My rhymes and his cuts have been consolidated
The mission ain't complete without the use of his hands
He makes my rhymes so fresher, my beat expands
So I'll like you to meet him, but don't attempt to beat him
A Five Man Crew, me and him will defeat them
He'll scratch and wipe out all foes
Turntable terrorizin' and I think you should know
That were, high calibered and my names' J
And for all you sucker crews it's Judgment Day
To ring this encounter, I'm your rhyme sayer
I have to say it girls, but yes, I'm a player
Materials royal, I'm a'nating all
Like brown with dimples and I'm six-feet tall
And promoter of recordings that I call my own
And I'll love to take one of you ladies home
I'll complete and clear, infiltratin' your ears
My litera-ture is above Shakespeare
Emcee, a sucker natter and I just won't stop
I'm the author and the designer of the jam you'll rock
I'm a lyrical game on the heels of fame
And the world is glad that Cool J came
You'll rock!

Now I'm a dedicate this rhyme to my favorite street
You think about it everytime that you hear this beat
Any other jam you hear just dis-regard
This is the National Anthem of the Boulevard
See I'm loyal to the bully cause it tought me the deal
Certainly the place to be and that's how I feel
Farmers Boulevard, E-Love and me Cool J
In the center of it all is a cute 3-A
Forty-seven will surrender till emcee's in fear
Queens Boulevard is soft, they don't come around here
Quick as L's on my face I will hold my space
And to taste, stimulate, and conduct the bait
You'll rock!

Now I'ma kick it for the beat, check complete my mission
Subtractin' emcee's like a mathematician
Jammin' up the board at the rappin' commission
Soul inventor of this composition
I disintegrate rappers I can and I could
Degrade egg your Al and Ol couldn't write this good
But I'm the Warlord of rap with my own army
Japans' whole military couldn't disarm me
Super bad, cold-crushed, number one be	-boy
Like a paintin' from Picasso, I'm the real McCoy
Crown-Prince of rappin', Godfather of bees
Emcee's that need a new lady to feed
You'll rock!

You know I'm sayin'? Break!
You know I'm sayin'? Break! Break! Break two!",You'll Rock,1985
LL Cool J,"That's right y'all this is the LL Cool J party
Move it, move it, move it, get on the floor baby
That's right, don't try to front like your fly
Get out there!

To rappers I'm a nightmare on Elm Street
Hellafied hotter than heat, guess why the others can't eat?
Cause I'm a carnivore and I can eat much more
Than a fat man after a pack-a-jam
L.L.'s thicker than butter, well-known throw cutter
When I'm involved all the amateurs stutter
There's scared and can't believe that their whole crews
Ain't a rapper alive that can fill my shoes
I'm dope on a rope virgins water elope
I do the hustle and the shuffle and the roper dope
Cause I'm as hard as hard rock in the hard rock town
I gotta .357 and I break it on down

Three hundred and fifty seven reasons
Why you gotta get your butt on the floor right now
We ain't playing, we came here to get ill
Iller than ill, LL you know I'm sayin'?

Just like Ali Baba and the 40 thieves
So nasty you don't know whether to stay or leave
More fear then Evan Bluebeard I serve primrose
A picture of me is like a part of Michaelango's
I don't play the banjo will you ever understand yo
Serving I mean the matter how old I go Rambo
Cocks strong half a block wrong
Illy I'll fire starter hitting harder than King Kong
Not a battle axe not one of the mill
Not easily knocked out or easily killed
Cause I'm as hard as hard rock in the hard rock town
I gotta .357 and I break it on down

A hundred and ninety five pounds punk
More bounce to the ounce and I say what counts
Know I'm saying?
Now get yourself on the floor
Stop acting like a sissy

Boy, I'm better than better is, badder than badder is
I won't scare em or dare em I'll just splatter his
Guts kick his butt while Bob is rocking the cuts
Wanna step in the ring with me you must be mushed
Now ices in a crisis afraid when he's ready or chasing when he's chasing
But filling when the scene I mean I'm icing and acing
Amateurs who like it can't hack it I attack it that's why I'm gonna crack it
The shell and the soul of little kids who can't roll
I told em, scold em, teach em and mold em
Get paid ten knots at a time and then I fold em
I remember the blood and I remember what told em
I can, can't cause I'm down with E yet you have the audacity
To try and mess with him and me
Hypersonic is weak and Supersonic is wack
Sneak around at the minute like a Siamese cat
""Pellum"" (1, 2, 3) catch twenty-two I'm H-A-R-D
I'm as hard as hard rock in the hard rock town
I gotta .357 and I break it on down

Rock the beat now that can be arranged
Yo baby you look fine spread em
Yo homeboy get up against the wall put this in your pocket
Who is this?
Move it, move it, move it

I'm a nappy, sappy crappy imitator of who
If I ever imitated it wouldn't be you, oh
You don't know so many have died when the LL growl was amplified
Get back better yet step back get that
Like shaft in the Mack cause I'm mad and I'm black
I'm a perfect plan a good boyfriend
I'm the reason rap rules and the country out Cool J-A-M-E-S
Fresh as a cliche but so is my forte
This goes out whether the blues is old news
P's and Q's keep me in your shoes
And you're dissing me because I'm young and I'm strong
And cause I'm capable of making a platinum LP
Wrong you was, you assumed I was all in
But boy is for balling they'll never say I'm falling
Calling all cars for the brother in black
L-E-L the Mack back bone of this track
I'm force full of force to put you on your back
Making hit after hit while you sent for a contract
Hotter than hot now watch how hot I can get
Leaving rappers fee's dried and skimmer's dimmer's wet
I'm as hard as hard rock in the hard rock town
I gotta .357 and I break it on down

Now the LL posse is now handing out speed knots
To all those who don't want to get busy
That's right baby get your body on the floor
Move it, move it
.357 at point blank range ain't nothing strange
You're having a heart attack is at your back
Now listen to me bring it, bring it on, 
On down, down, down, down, down, down",.357 - Break It on Down,1987
LL Cool J,"I'm the Ladies Love, legend in leather
Long and lean, and I don't wear pleather
Last of the red hot loving MC's
Looking for a little, that's my theory
It goes quick like lightning, too exciting
Lover of ladies, don't allow biting
Level-headed leader, toy boy feeder
Good love life and a rhyme biter beater
Looking, learning, the one you're liking
Listen and you will love what I'm writing
Ladies love, long, hard and lean
And now you know what L.L. means

[Chorus]
Let's get ill!
Come on now
Let's get ill!
Everybody
Let's get ill!
Everybody
Let's get ill!

Lightning in the sky, L.L. don't lie
I can hold a larger load than those other little guys
My literature is the land's highest law
The man of the brand, one you look out for
I'm loose like the lace in your brand new sneaker
Release the bass in your face like a large Vega speaker
Listen to my rhyme
Here to satisfy the listeners who stood on line
Bought tickets to see me kick it and wasn't late
The love every little bit of the cuts he creates
First not last, leader of the class, see
From London, Long Beach, and down to Tallahassee
Ladies are pleased, I'm not wearing Lee's
The Kangol is mine, the godfather is E
I bust your lip, my level won't slip
Clocking crazy dollars on the L.L. tip
Come on!

[Chorus]

Loose with the ladies, loud like a ref
When I die, there will be no lovers left
I'm the little girl liker, legendary writer
Let's see, I never lost cause I burn like a lighter
My love is long and my lyrics rock loud
Lurking shadow in the shadows like Little McLoud
I'm the Ladies Love, lyrical lord in the club
Ladies Love, the man you dream of

[Chorus]

Never ever lost, not lonely or alone
You can call me the last Capone
Not a little kid playing with garbage can lids
Don't need a legal lawyer, I ain't doing no bid
Cause the ladies know my bass is low
Rocking L after L ever since the intro
Liberace couldn't rock it like the long-legged pro
Two legs, not four like Lassie, I don't eat Alpo
Come on

[Chorus]

All over the land they listen to my jams
Like a cherry lollipop when you're licking your hand
I'm popping and locking, so I can give you a list
All of my lyrics are swift, so the losers never riff
I love giving em bliss, having my name on the list
I'm the life of the party and my rhymes are priceless
Each jam is like a lesson other rappers must learn
Cold laugh cause they don't like it every time I return
Come on

[Chorus: x2]","Ahh, Let's Get Ill",1987
LL Cool J,"Knuckleheads spreadin' gossip all over town 
Every time I drive by you're just standin' around 
Hundred-bottles in your pocket, forty-dog in your hand 
Don't you know you're just a worker and your boss is my man? 
L.L. this, L.L. that, soon as I walk in the place 
I want to take my gun and shoot you in your muthafuckin' face 
You're playin' me too close with the schemin' and games 
I guess the beef and the bullshit is the price of fame 
Movies, records, goin' on tour 
Twenty-thousand people hip-hoppin' on the floor 
Whole parties body-rockin', and everything's chill 
Get back to New York, and the suckers act ill 
See I fought with the devil, made a promise to God 
I have experience in goin' all the way to the top 
It's harder harder than hard 
All the suckers are barred 
You used to try to talk down now your ego is scarred 
See the problem is you want what another man has 
His car, his wife, or his razzamatazz 
But that's weak, you gotta do work on your own 
Cause when you're rich you got friends 
But when you're poor you're alone 
So get your own on your own, it'll strengthen your soul 
Stop livin' off your parents like you're three years old 
Instead of walkin' like you're limp and talkin' yang about me 
Why don't you take your monkey-ass and get a college degree? 
Or write a rhyme and ride a bike and try to live carefree 
Hope my message reaches you before you're seventy-three 
A old man, when people ask you what you did with your life 
You'll say ""I hated L.L. and I carried a big knife"" 
Every day is a chase, every day is a race 
And every day you're being overpowered by my bass 
Too much juice to be a deuce, I had to be a ace 
It's like the fire's in my eyes and the gun's in my face 
I'm stompin' stupid knuckleheads until they bleed 
I'm the leader of the show, so it's up to me to lead 
I'ma lead you away from drugs and petty crime 
Lead you away from wack beats and rhyme 
Lead you to that ticket line 
So you can come in my show and watch the stars shine 
Get busy, not dizzy, want to teach the young 
The last man who didn't listen ended up gettin' hung 
Not that I killed him, it's just 
He didn't want to trust 
The words of a master that's why you must 
Take heed to the speech, it's gonna reach your ear 
Don't try to say you can't hear 'cause the words are clear 
Throwin' flurries, punks scurry and I bury the rest 
You better hurry up and rock a rhyme and give it your best 
Cause tonight's the night we gonna see the big fight 
Twelve-gauge on the stage in case it don't go right 
E-Love drives a tank, he's strong like a truck 
If you're cryin' while you're dyin' we ain't givin' a fuck 
L.L. Cool J is on the microphone 
Tellin' all you punk ducks ""Leave me the hell alone"" 
Cause I'm rated X, born to snap necks 
Straight up and down, no special effects 
I'm the professor, the teacher, the hip-hop dean 
If Russia bombed the U.S., they'd be scared to touch Queens 
Cause that's where I live, and this is what I give 
Turnin' top-notch crews into fugitives 
They run, they frightened, they hide from King Titan 
Like a sniper when he's shootin' or a viper when he's bitin' 
Here I am, tellin' the truth 
And I'm spreadin' the word to my fellow youth 
It goes man-to-man and jam-to-jam 
I got hip-hop, rock, and love song fans 
All you petty MC's in the state of New York 
Gettin' a thousand for a show but you still want to squawk 
Can't get a decent contract, your beats ain't workin' 
Dogged-out Pumas plus you're manager's jerkin' 
Your mic sounds weak, remember that sieezer 
I'm badder than Napoleon, Hitler or Caesar 
I'm a hit man, but I'm not for hire 
Fly girl's desire, the man you admire 
Not only on the stage, I rock in the park 
And I'm a killer in the daytime, and worse after dark 
So don't never ever mess with the king of the sound

LL Cool J,"I know a fat girl, she wears a orange skirt 
You give her twenty dollars and you can do work 
She'll take food stamps and a traveller's check
Because her hair and her face and her life's a wreck 
She wears a bright blond wig, some high heeled pumps 
She's down in the dumps so she's sellin' her rump 
She's a hot little momma and she works every day 
If you want to pay to play, here's where she stays 
She's at the

(The Bristol Hotel) Where that at? (Jamaica, Queens!) 

I seen her standin' there, slutty as could be 
Offering the putty for a itty-bitty fee 
Every red light she'll come over to your ride 
Or she's standin' in the doorway tellin' you to come inside 
The Bristol Hotel, 'cause it ain't no thing 
And her meat tastes better than Burger King 
Japanese executives in three-piece suits 
Glasses all foggy when they come in the place 
The girlies in the Bristol, they're all in cahoots

Party people check the story 'cause the story is ill 
It's the story of two men, one Harold, one Bill 
They went inside the Bristol on a Saturday night 
Harold was cool but Bill felt uptight 
The girlies made attempts but Harold played it cool 
""Never ever rush, that's the golden rule 
I been comin' to the Bristol's ten years of my life 
A-yo, what the hell? Yo, man that's my wife!""

[Chorus]

You see, a Bristol girl is a one of a kind 
And if you know her good enough she won't make you stand on line 
She'll let you inside, make you pay for the ride 
Take off her pants and then it smells like somebody died 
You say ""What the heck"", because you already paid 
Not knowin' that the guy that went before you had AIDS 
Bang bang boogie, she was so amusin' 
Next week you're at the clinic gettin' blood transfusions

LL Cool J,"L.L. Cool J
Serving em well
And as you all know
I am hard as hell

Woke up at 9:30 on a Saturday morn'
Hemmed my remote control, turned my stereo on
Then I reached for a brush since I don't use the picks
And the floor was kinda cold, so I put on my kicks
Walked to the kitchen and ate some cornflakes
As I bop to a tape of Cut Creator's breaks
With hardcore, heavyweight, B-boy blast
Connoisseur of hardcore, and Cut Creator's fast
Jumped in the shower, it was boiling hot
So I stayed there a hour, cause I like it a lot
Jumped out, dried off, put on the Denim cologne
Then I called up Earl on the telephone
He told me 'bout a jam that I could do later on
10 G's plus a limo for one strong song
So I said, yeah, I was with it, hung up and got geared
Got a magnifying glass, then I brushed my beard
Rewound some tapes of some Def Jam tunes
As I waited for this freak to ring my bell at noon
12 o'clock came, left the door crack
The freak walked in, a mink on her back
Put her curt on the rack, threw my sex robe on
Then I threw in a tape of the quiet storm
We drank Round-hill Cavern, ate soft mignons
She said, ""L.L., when you're gonna let me taste your tongue?""
My skin got pale, I wam-bammed the tail
Did it so hard I should of went to jail
She left, Earl came over and we went outside
Jumped in the BM to bust a joyride
Went up to A.J., in my fresh black wheel
I'm not a sucker on the corner trying to scrape up a meal
The girlies want sex, the fellas try to plex
But those who flex end up with broke necks
Signed some autographs for a posse of freaks
Said, ""It's L, baby, I ain't down with Chic""
Conversated with the skeezers for 10 minutes more
Then I jumped in my ride and the freaks slammed the door
Due cause I'm a gangster people think I do crimes
They don't know I'm just a connoisseur of hip-hop rhymes
Some smile, try to call L.L. a hoodlum at times
But he don't know my autograph's on his wife's behind
L.L. has iced all the washed up slobs
Vigilante of rap, so to hell with the mob
Don't run from the cops, making suckers jock
And I'm only 18 making more than your pops
Tormentor of toys and boyscout boys
And I dare any critic to call it noise
Peeped at the clock, it said 6:03
Said 'later' to Creator and broke out with E
Went up to White Castle for a chocolate shake
Thinking 'bout a 100'000 that I'd soon make
Finished up the snack, jumped up, out my seat
E-Love hit the table and he made up a beat
Kicked a few lines, stepped out the door
Since tonight is a bore I'm in the mood for more
We jumped in my ride, I took a peek at the time
It was almost 7:30 and the show was at nine
L.L. Cool J will soon stand at a jam
With thousands of people screaming, ""Touch my hand!""
But since I had a hour plus a half for tat
I was searching for the cutie who's my perfect match
Her name was Renee, her face was okay
But she had the kinda body that made Jay want to play
I said, ""No need to rehearse,"" then I made my approach
Said, ""You got a good team, girl, but you need a new coach""
Said, ""My name's L.L. Cool, if I may introduce
But I'm not here for conversation, I'm here to seduce
Want to mix it up, baby, want to feel you grind
Cause it ain't 5th grade, and these ain't nursery rhymes
And I know that you adore my sure side hardcore
Check out the real L.L. behind closed doors
So tell your buddies you're busy, tell your boyfriend beat it
Forget the silk dress,cause you ain't gonna need it
Unplug your clock, do away with the light
After five minutes or more you hear me say, 'That's right!'
Your body is bad and I heard you got a Caddy
When we make love you can call me daddy
I'm L.L. Cool J, say hey, Renee
I'm not a toyboy, but I still want to play
Promise you I'm not wack when I'm in the sack
After that I leave you starving for me to come back
But in the meantime, put your digits down
And the next time I see ya I'm going to town""
Stepped away from the freak, it was a quarter to nine
When I rolled to the jam I saw the crew on line
Took a trip around the side, so I could get backstage
If you call me a tiger, then the stage is my cage
I rip, stomp and crush, heavy metal bands rust
Them flaky knuckleheads I crumble up like crust
Walked in my dressing room, and then I heard four knocks
They said, ""L.L., you're running late and it is time to rock""
Told Cut Creator what the order would be
Then I said ""Lord have mercy"" and slapped hands with E
Went onstage, I heard the girlies scream
And that's the very moment I woke up from the dream

Sit and lie my homeboy Earl says is that he loves hats
With a hands like a hatcher, Cut Creators in bat

Baddest man with ten fingers you've ever met
And sooner or later we'll have to sit
Cut Creator cut the record so they don't forget

What I'm sayin' is for real this ain't lala land
Got a can full of jams pullin' off the lid
Competition in New York is doin' what I did
Cold sender of a story I paid my dues
I rocked at house parties I was down with crews
Now I'll never be caught I'm on my P's and Q's
And for the rest of your life you wanna be in my shoes
I scar like stones hard like cement 
And I rocked every jam that I ever went
Cause I got a better reppin' than any emcee has
And I'm down like a brother from Alcatraz

I rap the boss is back the only man
you should call when the party's packed
From Paris to L.A they say I'm as sharp as a pin
When it's a Cool J party you gotta get in
So I'm making big steps like Gladys Knight in the pier
One rhyme you're on my tinsels as I leave my lip
Up the block kids are talking and spreading the news
About the new grandmaster the one you'll choose
Cause I'm chuckling I wanna stomp the rest
When I kick it couldn't bore it could only impress
I'm not a Hula-Hoop this isn't a passing phase
Hard work pays I'm getting straight up A's
Cool J is running things I want it understood
Executioner I should wear a black hood
And carry an axe cause I'm ruff on wax

9, 10, 11 'o' clock 12 'o' clock rock!
Gonna rock (What?) rock, rock, around the clock
Three years ago in St. Albans, Queens 
I was rocking at a park called one eighteen
Little kids stood and watched as I rocked the spot 
Didn't know that years later I'll be standing on top 
Living near Farmers Boulevard I was born and base-shaw
Stopped the rich and shaked hands with the poor 
And this is a story about a brother I know
Cut Creator on the fader no watch him go

Go, go cut creator go
Go cut creator go 
Go cut creator go
Go cut creator go
Go, go cut creator go
Go cut creator go
Go cut creator go

When back in the days before I clocked some dough
I used to go to the show and sit in the front row
Hoping and praying one day I'll get on the road
So I had a feeler and a summer and I meet when I'm stoned
Not fearing a thought, got stung like a horse 
Don't make fun of my posse, cause each man is a boss
When his only damn way to pull a jam out the crate
One time for your mind
Check out the guitar break

This jam just wasn't enough for Jimmy Hendrix to see
He could do lessons of mixing take you under his wing
Straight from the heart cause it ain't the money that we came here for
Ain't no thoughts in the room ain't breaking no roles
And in the Rock 'n' Roll land, a big striving plan 
Just my posse learn the vocals what little they had
It's all about us three: Eve, Phil & Jay

[Chorus]

Rock, rock y'all check out the funky cut
It's like traveling through time to the straight cats strut 
Cuts are slicker than Grease needle as sharp as a knife
We'll be do doing the doo for the rest of the lines 
Want to piece of the action, it's time to party, get up
Not a subway bummy singer putting change in a cup 
Want to see you boogie, oogie jumping up and down
Biting your living hold your breath until we come to your town

LL Cool J,"I met this new girl with big juicy lips
And nice round hips, I mean her body's a trip
And when I go over her house, you know what I like?
The way she tells me ""take it off"" and never says ""syke""
Yo, I'm never in need, she's feedin' my greed
She never waits for me to ask, she takes the lead
Her tongue is sticky, and hickeys are her specialty
E wants her, but she saves the good stuff for me
Her name is Kanday, she's dandier than Dandy Don
You're mad and I'm happy that she put me on
I'll never leave her for nothin', only a crazy man would
That's why I had to tell ya that (I, feel, good)

[Chorus]
About Kanday
(I, feel, good)
About Kanday
(I, feel, good)

Now & Laters gum drops, jellybeans
Brothers beg for the leg, she's on the cheerleading team
It feels wicked, every time I stick it, that's right
When we're alone she never ever acts polite
Hey yo, she blows me kisses, she does my dishes
I wished I bust two and she grants my wishes
She's clever in bed, she uses her head
She's the kinda girl that keeps a fat man well fed
Left to right all night, the chick's outta sight
I broke my lamp shade in half because I don't use a light
Man, she's juicy like a berry, chocolate with the cherry
Ask me if it's good and I'll have to say very
Wouldn't leave her for nothin', only a crazy man would
That's why I had to tell ya that (I, feel, good)

[Chorus]

I'm feelin' gooder than good, if you wouldn't I would
If you could, I know you could, she's kickin' back in the hood
When she starts to get off she can knock off a cough
I know 'cough' don't rhyme with 'boss', but she made me her boss
She's the talk of my room whenever I'm in my room
My little brother loves her more than his favorite cartoon
Her body's bad, the girl's built, skin like silk
Wet, steamy and warm just like a hot cup of milk
She's all the way live, keeps me satisfied
I don't go outside, I like to stay inside
Her ways are like a angel, with bright white wings
And I'm crazy 'bout the way Kanday shakes her thing
Wouldn't leave her for nothin', only a crazy man would
That's why I had to tell ya that (I, feel, good)

[Chorus]

Ooh, you couldn't imagine, I'm lickin' my lips
If she was tea I'd take a sip, when I'm in gym I do flips
I'm in love with the pizznoot, it's proper as hell
I'm hittin' harder than hard, always makin' her yell
She's cooler than an iceberg, word to the mother
In the house, down the steps and under the covers
Right away, no sation, or frontin', or playin'
Or delayin', I'm never steppin' off, I'm always stayin'
Her mother knows me well, father hates my guts
He don't know when we're alone she's always feelin' on my niggy-niggy-nuts
For a snack, cornflakes, crackerjacks
Day after day I try to break that back
And man, oh man, damn, you can't and I can
Last time I saw her with man I had to shake almost hands
I said ""what up"", he said ""what up"", ""I took your girl, so what up?""
Gotta walk on the ground with a hole to fill up
All the boys laugh about her, Darryl and Dewayne
Bobcat and Earl, but they must be insane
Michael Spelling's on my side, and big Chuck the Grease
She's my private freaky deak, my own personal skeez
Wouldn't leave her for nothin', only a crazy man would
That's why I had to tell ya that (I, feel, good)

Not bitter or mad just provin' I'm bad 
You want a hit give me a hour plus a pen and a pad

My ace in the hole was this brand new track 
I'ma slow it up and speed it up and now you're gonna eat it up 
Listen to the funky beat, my tongue is gonna beat it up 
I did it, but the devil didn't make me 
I did it for the suckers who tried to shake and bake me 
Proving a point that I'm a serious joint 
You can roll me up and puff me, and then I'll anoint 
Your head with oil--lots of oil 
Make it run like water, watch it boil 
'Cause I made 'em play it, made 'em say it 
Made 'em okay it, made 'em obey it---huh!

I heard your new jam, I don't play that 
It ain't loud enough punk, it ain't hitting 
This year you tried, next year you're quitting 
Last year you thought I was dying out 
But again, and again, and again without a doubt 
It's the gangster boogie, the earthquake sound 
Pump it up and play it so they hear it all around 
I do it up rough, tough, I don't bluff 
And this is an example of funky stuff 
When you want to make hits, you make 'em like this 
They ain't like this they don't hit, they miss 
It's a strong record, a record for the strong

Listen how I won't allow myself to go off track 
Stay back, I got the power, I'm--

Moving and grooving, and always improving a lot of 
People don't know how nice I am 
People sleeping, so now I gotta slice my man 
Like ham in a pan, wrap him up in Saran 
Kidnap him and slap him up inside of a van 
While you're doing your dance I want you to make moves 
Don't run out there ? ? ? 
You know my name and my game and what I'm here to do 
Party people, lemme see if you can dance to--

Ain't holding back, behind the cool without the A.Y. 
I love to ride the groove because the groove is smooth 
It makes me move and I'll improve

When you see me, don't ask if the show's on 
How that sound? Don't came around, playing me close, brown 
Pull on my jock to be down

A killing machine, a savage street talker 
Jason with an axe, but I put it on wax 
To eradicate the suckers who thought I had relaxed

Kicking it mean, keeping it clean 
And you've never seen anybody rock the party 
All you punks ? ? ? this beats Bacardi 
I go to the show, and terrorize emcees, don't you know 
Moving my hand like I'm playing the piano 
Don't touch the dial, don't change the channel

LL Cool J,"Do you remember the first time you fell in love
The way it felt, the way it feels
Bein' able to say from the bottom of your heart
I love you for real

Your eyes, meet, you feel your heartbeat
Palms are sweaty you can't keep still
And when you finally touch 'em, and hug 'em and kiss 'em
Ooh what a thrill

You was always searchin and finally your dream came true
They came strollin' along
And you promised 'em, straight up and down sweetheart
I swear, I'll never do you wrong

Hand in hand, heart to heart
Nothin' in the world could separate the two
And even though you've only known that person for a short time
You tell 'em I love you, you're my heart

You argue witcha parents and they argue back
You're too young to be so serious
You tell 'em that's not true, I'll go on without you
And walk away aggravated and furious

You want 'em to approve, but then again it don't matter
The relationship's yours
You feel you're maturin' and hey
You can fight your own battles and wars

You discuss it with your love and it's the same for them
So the two of you decide we're gonna weather the storm
Life is sweet, kissin' caressin' and huggin'
And keepin' each other warm

But now comes the serious part, 'cause love
Believe me, it ain't a easy task
We'd have one argument too many
And you'd have to ask, am I still your heart?

Am I still your heart or somethin', pullin' us apart
'Cause baby if it is, please let me know what
You run out the door, I tell you come back
I love you, you shout out, so what?

How could you hurt me? How could you treat me
Like you never loved me, were you playing a game?
And if so, I only have one request, sit down and explain

To me the person who treated you right, did you right
And held you tight, every night
Is there another lover in your life, that has you uptight?

'Cause if it is, aww, baby, please, don't do this to me
I'm tryin' to reach you, tryin' to talk to you
It's killin' me 'cause you're my heart
That's right I admit it

You're my heart I refuse, to let you go
I struggle and fight for you against all odds
Get down on my knees and pray to God
That our love is in the cards

'Cause I know you're right for me and I know I'm right for you
There's no way in the world I'll let you slip out of my hands
People say forget about it, move on, but see they don't understand

You're nothin to them, but you're so much to me
So much in fact that I'd give my life
To stare into your eyes and caress your face
As the priest, announces us man and wife

We'd live happily, ever after
White picket fence and the whole nine yards
And anything that anybody said
I'd disregard, if I was still your heart

So make up your mind, 'cause I've made up my mind
I'm beggin' you baby please come back home
I'll be tossin' and turnin', as I lay in my bed
Sorrow surrounds me I can feel it in my bones

This can't be true, I'm losin' you
Oh Lord have mercy, please make it alright
All I wanna do in this whole wide world is hold you tight

I've ripped open my heart, shed tears and cried
Now it's up to you baby, please understand
I forgive you for everything and give you anything
Just let me take ya by the hand

And lead ya, baby I got ya
Protect you like a mother, protects a child
Now it's up to you, I'ma call you in a little while

Not too big, but nothing to play with

LL Cool J,"I was at the mall, sippin' on a milkshake
Playin' the wall, takin' a break
Admirin' the girls with the bamboo earrings
Baby hair and bodies built to swing
That's when I seen her
Her name was Tina
Grace and poise kinda like a ballerina
I said, ""How you doin', my name's Big L
Don't ask me how I'm livin', 'cause, yo, I'm living swell
But then again I'm livin' kind of foul
Cause my girl don't know that I'm out on the prowl""
To make a long story short, I got the digits
Calls her on my car phone and paid her a visit
I was spankin' her and thankin' her, chewin' her and doin' her
Layin' like a king on sheets of satin
That's what time it is, you know what's happenin'
She had a big ole booty, I was doin' my duty
I mean, yo, I admit that my girl's a cutie
But Tina was erotic, Earl's my witness
With the kind of legs that put stockings out of business
When I went home, I kissed my girl on the cheek
But in the back of my mind it was this big butt freak
I sat my girl down, I couldn't hold it in
And said to her with a devilish grin

Tina got a big ole butt

To try to catch a cutie ridin' my jock
My homeboy's jeep, the system blastin'
Cold forty dogs, smilin' and laughin'
Girls all over, the kind I adore
I felt like a kid in a candy store
That's when I seen her
Her name was Brenda
She had the kind of booty that I'd always remember
I said to my man, ""Stop the jeep""
She's only seventeen but, yo, don't sleep
I kicked the bass like an NFL punter
And scoped the booty like a big game hunter
I said to the girl, ""Yo, you look tired
Let's go get some rest, relax by the fire""
I put the big booty on a bearskin rug
She gave me a kiss, I have her a hug
I said to the girl, ""them young boys ain't nothin'
You want to get freaky, let me kiss your belly button""
I circled it and teased it and made her squeal
Grabbed a pack of bullets and pulled out the steel
When I was through, I wiped the sweat from my eyes
When to the kitchen and got some sweet potato pies
Tina busted in my house while I was eatin'
You know what I said
Too bad you caught me cheatin', but

I went to Red Lobster for shrimp and steak
Around the time whe the waitress are on their lunch break
I pulled in the parkin' lot and parded my car
Somebody shouted out, ""I don't care who you are""
I paid it no attention, I walked inside
Because Brian had a nine and he was chillin' in the ride
I walked in the place, everybody was lookin'
And shrimp and steak wasn't the only thing cookin'
I sat down to eat, ordered my food
I said to the waitress, ""I don't men to be rude
But I'll take you on a platter""
She said, ""You got a girl,"" I said, ""It don't matter
You look like you're tastier than a pipin' hot pizza
What's your name?"" She said, ""My tag says Lisa""
I said, ""O.K., you're smart and all that
But when you get off work, yo, I'll be back""
She looked at me and said, ""Make yourself clear
L, where we going?"" I said, ""Right here""
She looked kind of puzzled, I said, ""You'll see""
I pulled up at ten on the D.O.T.
When she walked out the door, I threw my tongue down her throat
Pushed her back inside and pulled off her coat
Laid her on the table and place my order
And have her a tip much bigger than a quarter
On and on to the break 'a dawn
All over the restaurant, word is born
I heard somebody coughin', I checked my watch
I couldn't believe it said nine o'clock
I grabbed my pants, put on my Kangol
Who did I see, Oh, yo, it was Brenda
Yo, she worked at Red Lobster but I didn't remember

We gotta help the junkies tastin' their dream
Fiendin' on the corner
Cause yo we got the power
And man we are the world, so what you wanna do
What you wanna do homeboys and all you fly girls?
Put your cigarette out, throw away your drink
Take a moment of silence to stop and think
Hah, we gotta change our ways huh
Or we'll never see brighter days

Come on, come on, come on, come on
Change your ways

Word up, youknowhatI'msayin'?
All we gotta do is change our ways
And everything will be aight youknowhatI'msayin'?

But we gotta keep fightin', we gotta struggle youknowhatImean?
And we stay alive, only the strong survive
So part of you can change your ways and you'll be aight

Take her blood, bouncin' heads like balls
Murderer, somethin' mutilator of Amiga
I get ill, so blood spills, every time I speak
Drivin' Bombs that inveterate your ego
Suckers all weird, no let the best go migo
They talk and talk, I invade and take over
Forget Mako, you gonna need a make-over
I'm ferocious, animalistic, an animal
On the mic, I'm a cannibal
I eat livers, hearts, legs and arms
They crown me the King of doin' nothin' but harm
I'm two with the Universe and I'ma make you
Diverse, make I kill quick, so you'll win from crew to hers
I'ma Titan, keepin' you frightened

To decapatate, amputate and take titles
The legend of leather, I'ma real live idol
Damn I take souls, condemn we men
And make microphones men again and again
Cause, I'm blood thirsty watch and try to curse me
You'll lose the battle even if you out re-hearsed me
I'ma rip holes watch heads roll, like a mole
When I'm strollin' with my neck on a goal
My battles' like a blackout, you can't back out
Only difference, no time to feel a track out

So come forward, admit you're guilty
Admit that your thoughts of New Jack killed me
Admit you were sleepin' on the skills of L
Now know that I handle mine, very well
I burn buildings, eat emcee's
Smack DJ's and tell the seated girls please
They try to jam hard, but I'ma fan God
And they could never get a piece of the man Todd

The eliminator, and I'ma score tonight
Somethin' like Murley, but it goes much deeper
Now just another rapper with a chain and a beeper
One sample is ample, four emcees'll get trampled
Bein' absent from God, I'ma give you sample
My vocabulary's legendary, my rumpy your temporary
So what your name in the bituary
Step back the conqueror spreads his wings
Kindergarten rappers, I'm back to change things
I rock the clearest, one hell of a learer
Since I can't miss and I'm kinda like a chemist
When I put a potion together it's splendid and fatal
You can never make a move on me cause you're still premado
Grip the mic tight sometimes I get calasis
And when I'm through you face baralysis
I'm gettin' thinner, watch me eat dinner
I'm down to skinner beginner to be a winner

You're a dandelion, I'm a panther
When I pick up the mic, as my fist see mo'
King of Rackadochio, I'm magnifigo
When I rock, hearts roll on and walk bad
Cause I know it's makes the face-sucker-ducks mad
I came back to smack wifes and pull cards
Introducin' the original Todd
Just like a bloodhound but I got this spellbound
Your rhymes are snowbound and I can throw down
I'm like a thundercloud, I drop heavy
Hold steady, get ready, your petti confetti
Techniques and styles, they ain't ready
Ah, ah, yeah, full of horsepower and I'ma devour
Stay clean when I scream you're soft las cauliflower
I set the track and record you like a brown mouse
Then flick and do a Bruce Lee 'roundhouse

LL Cool J,"Just like Pauline you all-in

Oh,
Brace yourself, I'm the ace with grace
I'ma win the race and make you feel disgrace
In any case, yo, I'm moving like a steeplechase
MC soldiers, about face
Now step off, I need room for my takeoff
My custom made lyrics slays, yours are soft
I think you better tape this, yo, you can't escape this
Yo, I planned it out just like a landscapist
Whipper-snapper back up for coming crap up
I plan to trap a MC and kidnap em
Phony, so skip the baloney
You and your cronies need to jump on a pony
And roll, cause you're just a rookie
When it was time for rap school, you must of played hooky
I'm the show-stopper, your rhymes are improper
I'ma teach you like the master taught the grasshopper
Just getting warmer, I'm a transform a
Regular rhyme into a barnstormer
Try to jump I'll bump you chump, my job is thorough
Any MC, state city or borough'll get ragged
I drop like a sandbag
Serious as the mob, I don't play tag
Best of the batch, no man can catch up
Hoes can't be passed, a battle's a mis match
I flip lyrics, like a acrobat
And avoid combat like a diplomat
But when it's time for back lash, jacked or killed
It's a thrill to drill a run of the mill Bill
With my skill, I'm the lord of the rhymes
And I be writing at a rate that pace way past my bedtime
I rock the mic unlike
Some brothers I know, I guess they flow, pysch!
I'm dropping 'em

Dropping 'em

Yo, you're all in, stiff as a mannequin
I'm sharp as a pen and I'ma teach discipline
I get busy like it's two of me
Evidently, I'm hated by a few MC's
But so what? I just max like I'm playing the sax
And take the crowd to the climax
Yo, Cool J, I'll never go astray
I'm funky you can hear me at the Milky Way
You're weak, wick raps, I'm cool as jazz
Got razzmatazz ask my man Shabazz
I know you're afraid because I'm self-made
I invade, and blow up like a hand grenade
MC's are terror-struck, I'ma run amuck
Cause your rhymes suck, you made a record on potluck
Just a toy boy, can't stop my convoy
Rhymes I said last year were just decoys
I'm like a fox, you annoy me like chicken pox
I'm back with a style that's unorthodox
You must of had a teaspoon full of bull
I'm like The Hulk, with more bulk, I'm powerful
They try to get with this, to me that's an insult
Boys shouldn't mess with an adult, that's too difficult
I enter like a giant saying fee fi foe fum
Then rock the auditorium until it's pandemonium
I'm dropping 'em

Yo E, dropping 'em

Don't sleep, cause I'ma go deeper
All you sleepers, I'm the Grim Reaper
My rhymes are rising, the angle's getting steeper
I hated Mussolini Martini so I'ma sweep a
Emcee, like he's one of the two
Break him into fragments right in front of you
Mic check one two, is too fundamental
My rhymes are monumental over an instrumental
In the center, I had to enter
Tormentor mentor experimenter and inventor
Of lyrics, so all you non-believers
It'll echo in your dreams at night when you receive a
Rude awakening, you can't do anything
You enter my kingdom and you cry as men bring
Gifts to the prince of excellence and magnificence
Alarm clock rings, you wake up, and you're convinced
That the crew invader, soloist exterminator
Greater evader of ducks, concert crusader
Is bad, my nickname's the circuit breaker
Eating up the world, acre by acre
I'm dropping 'em

Word to mother, dropping 'em!
Know what I'm saying? Straight til 1999, dropping 'em!

Yo, let me tell you bout a girl named Peg
A D.C. haircut and stewardess legs
Dressed to kill, her physique is ill
Her face belongs on a dollar bill
Her boyfriend's down with the M-O-be	
Driving around in a 300e
Trunk jewelry and all that
Talking bout, ""My man can't fall black!""
Sipping on cham', diamonds on her hand
Taking cash, carrying drugs for her man
Driving around in a kitted up Jetta
Under the seat a automatic Beretta

Telling brothers they need to get off the bra-strap
That's the type of girl she is
Word to Miz, she got the
Full length blue fox, knock you out the box
Big rocks, this girl is hype Hobbes
The type of girl that cold did son wrong
She got the face that you want to spend money on
Her man be smacking her up
Yeah, backing her up
To the wall, get undressed, where you going?
You ain't playing me out with that hoeing
Look in the mirror, check the jewels
Silly rabbit, you know the rules
But he had to leave on another deal
So she's out there with sex appeal
It's the weekend, time for freaking, she's sneaking
Outside, telling her home girls, we can
Do the do, with who-ever we want to
Cause we're the fly girl crew
Not knowing her man messed up the money
Riding around, thinking everything's funny
Went in a disco, came outside
Somebody pushed her in a beat up ride
She had to pay for her man's mistakes

Where the A.C.'s cold, and the girls still strip

Advising, realizing, she's sizing me up
Her bikini, small; heels, tall
She said, she liked, the ocean
She showed me a beach, gave me a peach
And pulled out the suntan lotion
Now I thought that was fast, but this girl was faster
She's looking for a real good time

Cause I'ma hit Jealousy and his posse where it hurts a lot
Him and his boys have a habit, they always smirk a lot

How we living Holmes?  
Get out my face!
I'm complete, in effect, and I can't fall
I rise, surprise, and I advise you all
To stand back and peep, don't sleep or doubt
My skill'll get I'll, I turn the mother out
I'm top-notch, you're still playing hop-scotch
Now I'ma do ya while the party people watch
You're real funny, you really try to go for yours
But I know why: you ain't had no dough before
So you tried and lied to drain my fame
This ain't a game, yo, you know my name
Forget all the MC's who like to mingle
Yo baby, let me see your earrings jingle

(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby 
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby 
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby 

When you first walked in, I ain't know what to think
You grabbed the microphone like your {shit} don't stink
And tried to run down that, I can't get over that
Bullshit you were sayin', you call that a battle rap?
How you gonna go against an army with a handgun?
I'm Cool J, yo you don't understand, son
I'm a legend, on top of that I'm livin'
Now you look stupid like that {bitch} Ms. Givens
Whoever geesed you up, nah, how should I say it?
Whoever set you up, they knew just how to play it
Cause man, YO, I feel for you brother
I'm a bad (Word to my mother!)
Taking out suckers while the ladies pucker
And rolling over niggas like a redneck trucker
Innovating, devastating, and dope on a single, now
Lemme see your earrings jingle

(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby 
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby 
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby 

Yeah baby, you know what I mean?
You like be jingling crazy, word
(yeah yeah yeah)
All over this funky beat
You be like jingling, and your earrings be jingling
And shaking all over the place and all
It's like real, it's real wild to me honey ya know what I mean?
The way you be jingling, word

(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby 
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby 
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby 

Can't believe you tried to grip the same mic as me
Your grip's too weak, you can't hold it, B
You can dream of making progress and getting this nice
But when I roll up, it's like Hip Hop Vice
I serve to curbs, I never swerve I'm superb
Every word you heard played tricks on your nerves
You played your hand, lost track of your plan
When I show up, I blow up, end of story, my man
I'm a play you like a poker chip, that's what you get
I bet your fret, sweat, and regret you met
The titan of fighting, exciting when writing, you trifling toy-boy
I gotta enlighten, so start biting
You know you can't create and get mean like this
When I'm on the court, G, it's strictly swish!
When it's all over, said and done, my friend
They say, ""That {bad motherfucker} just scored again""
So take a step back, give me some room to wreck shop
Here's your token back, you're getting off at the next stop
I'ma deliver and give a speech with vigor
I drink some Olde E and start waxing (niggas)

I excel, they fell, I said, well, hell
L can yell or make 'em melt like gel
I signed the contracts that buils up stacks
Play the wall or fall I stand tall you're small in fact
Step aside, you might get fried
By the super technique that the rapper applied
As a matter of fact, the impact will distract
Your attention away, from the rest who say
They can mess with Cool J the best of to-day
And best 'cause the rhymes are so funky fresh
I'ma attack smack and make 'em stand back
Black strong as cognac I got the knack
To rhyme to the rhythm of this, and give 'em a gift
That's swift, other rappers are stiff and don't riff with
Mr. Smith, 'cause that ain't safe
I get you wide open like an uncut eighth
I write to fight, don't bite, to reach heights
The mic makes right, give me the spotlight
So I can prove the pen is mightier than the sword
LL hard as hell, the lyrical lord
The counterfeit misfits that rap had to admit that
My rhymes are so dangerous, I need a permit to rap
Solo, on the microphone
MC's, don't let me catch you alone
I'm nitro!
Yo, I got the kick of a kettle drum, guaranteed to overcome
You're just a minimum, messing with the maximum
And when I swung my tongue among the high strung
Young MC's, they all got done by the legend
Every second I'm wrecking
Not a mistake you'll find, but you can keep checking
Out the sound you'll find that it's genuine
Bet that you'll rewind this a thousand times
You can taste the bass like it's filet-of-sole
I leave the microphone full of bullet holes
I drop the bomb like I'm in 'Nam and go beyond
The normal boundaries of too much harm
To MC's, but as they say please I freeze
Rhymes like these kill like a disease
Tried to fill my shoes, and caught the blues
Because they get bruised by the rhymes I choose
I kill rappers at random, I don't understand 'em
The ones I didn't get, are on a memorandum
Lines I recite are spontaneous
The nursery rhymes you write, are miscellaneous
So pass the crown, bow down and give in
I'm the Prince of Rap, that's how we livin'
Setting milestones on the microphone
Empires are overthrown, and I ain't even baritone
No joke I spoke then God stroke
As Job tried to sweat the style and got soaked
Conquered and killed on the microphone
MC's, don't let me catch you alone
LL's nitro!
Nitro!
Yo, flammable, like gasoline
Threatening, like a guillotine
It's like a bad dream when you battle my team
I go to every extreme to make MC's scream
I'm clever, I last forever, we can do whatever
With whoever, whenever, I never
Ever got rocked, stopped or dropped
They got popped, by the hip-hop rock that I concoct
I'm so nice yo, flowing with the maestro
Murdering and hurting MC's because I'm nitro
The earthquakes'll kill snakes and fakes
You can't flake, you made a mistake, give me a break, thanks
Now that we're straight and that's clear
Watch all the big mouths, disappear
Disintegrate, deteriorate, fall
I demonstrate, and devastate you all
There's no doubt about the fact I turn it out, the wack
Be on the lookout, LL made a comeback
Full of power, I'ma devour
I stand tall as a tower, I won't allow a
MC to see-O-M-E, see-L-O-S-E

On the microphone, I'm nitro!

Yo (funky)
I daze amaze faze blaze and beat 'em down
Nowadays they crave and praise, the funky sound I pound
Rhymes I write 'em in, recite 'em and then slide 'em in
Order to slaughter comp that start soon as I begin
Total domination, across the nation
Devastation, cut sensation, it's the invasion
Of L the Terrible, devastating rhyming wiz

LL Cool J,"One shot
Oh lord
You know, it's gonna be a lot of negative things surrounding you
Trying to pull you down
But what you have to remember is
It's up to you, it's your choice
You only get one shot in life
And you only get one shot at love

Did you ever notice, every time you fall in love
And it seems like you finally met the perfect match
Everything is perfect, it seems divine
But for some strange reason, there's always a catch
It's a one-way relationship, it hurts inside
One person smirks while the other one cries
Butterflies in the stomach of the one whose in love
It cuts like a knife, the truth mixed with lies

One shot (one shot at love)
One shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)
One shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)
One shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)
That's all you get

Physical and mental, those are two different loves
Physical's a moment, mental is forever
If the physical fades and gets weak, all of a sudden
Remember, it's the mental love that keeps you together
You gotta be strong and endure the hard times
Cause af-ter hard times, good times, always follow
And when you're kissin' and huggin' and makin' love
Treat that person like there's no tomorrow

One shot (one shot at love)
One shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)
That's all you get baby, one shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)
One shot at love, one, shot (one shot at love)
That's all you get 

Jealousy, don't let it interfere
Don't let it come in between
The love you two share, cause jealousy's a hateful God
So merciless and mean
And it's only job in life, is to ruin relationships
And pit two people against, one another
And because of this God, the one you love so much
Will no longer be your lover

One shot (one shot at love)
Aw baby, one shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)
That's all we get, one shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)
I mean this baby, one shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)
That's all

I hope you understand what I just said
All I'm saying is that you only get one shot at love in life
And you have to hold on to that shot, take advantage of it
Cause when you lose it, it's gonna hurt real bad
Take it from me
You only get one shot, and I mean that
One shot

Smoking, doping, keep your ears open
Put me on the flier and I'm guaranteed to rope in
Twenty-thousand people to the place that I play at
And have em even saying how could someone say that

Please give me some more
Of those hooping, scooping, rhymes you be trooping
If you don't know the new dance, Patti Duke'n
Clap your hands, stomp your feet, snap your fingers
I'm snatching airplay, from all you AIDS catching singers
It's a, special delivery on your front step
My picture's on the cover and the rhymes are in effect
Cause, I love to lay down, joints for the playground
And have you OD'n saying, y'know, J sound
Righteous, the brother did what he had to
I didn't talk about this, so I had you
Sleeping, breathing saying yo he ain't keeping
His promise to astonish, from weekend to weekend

Uhh, aww yeah, uhh, ahh
Uhh, aww yeah, uhh, ahh
Uhh, aww yeah!

I'm the wise wizard of the microphone swinging it
Here's a mean joint, all the hip-hoppers are singing it
Doing a dance in tight bike pants
So get up on it (hoe!) you'll only get one chance
To work out, the soreness in your muscles
Do your own thing, even the hustle
MC's I'ma torture, that's already known
But while I'm torturing them, I'ma leave you alone
So you can bump, grind, and rub up against your partner
And look wild like you're tryin to get a part in a
Dirty movie on the hip-hop tip
Now tell me (tell you what?) that brother L ain't tryin to flip
With the

[Chorus]

Moving, grooving, admit that you've been
Shocked and rocked and I'm on top and it's been proven
I'm self-reliant, on stage I'm defiant
All those rumors are small things to a giant
I'm not a cool calm, collected type of brother
I'm kind of hype that's why I'm a good lover
In bed I'm energetic, kind of like a freight train
Going so crazy I have the girlies saying, ""Wait James!""
I do damage, use the beef to build a sandwich
And when I'm done, she'll be saying, ""How did you manage
To make me feel pleasure from my toes to my head?
On top of that, you ran laps around the bed""
So bust out the pumped up funk that I'm revealing
And listen to it, while you're in your car wheeling
On on your Walkman as you're staring at the ceiling
Or when you and your love is sex-appealing
To the

Uhh, aww yeah, uhh, ahh
Uhh, aww yeah, uhh, ahh
Know what I'm sayin?

It's almost like you feel like you're from two different worlds
(Well, we are Todd) I don't think so
You should have a listen to me right now

I can feel it now baby I can feel it now, I can feel that
Even though you're a queen and I'm only a prince
I felt the magical between us ever since
The first time that I laid eyes on you
I want you to be my girl, so I can hold you
Caress you and let you know that I love you
And day by day my love grows

But we're from

Two different, two different, we're from two different worlds
Two different, two different worlds,
I don't understand the way you feel
But it's just a dream and it could never be real
So face to face I can't love you
We're from two, different worlds
Two different, two different, we're from two different worlds

Man things are different, birds and bees
Flowers and trees, you and me
But it really doesn't matter, it makes us stronger
There's more to talk about, we'll be together longer

It goes so deep, girl you're so sweet

You better take a chill and observe the skill
of the man who can, so understand god damn
I got a masterpiece a master plan and a brand new
way to attack the wack cut 'em down to size
to realize LL's back
Don't sleep I'm too sweet to repeat a beat
a lyric or rhyme I wouldn't waste your time
with weak words, that's for nerds, you never heard a rhyme
So you deserve a line rougher than rough enough is enough
I'm, gonna slaughter choke ya smoke ya like a sauna
You don't really wanna
But if you wanna battle on here's a lesson, stop 'fessin
I'm a lethal weapon, you better get to steppin

Why do you think they call it dope?
Why do you why do you think they call it dope?

It seems like people-'ll never understand
On the microphone I'm not your average man
I cool out sometimes, I save my best rhymes
and then the toy boy thinks that he can come and get mine
Let your friends gas him up, talk trash and make bets
then gets played like those kids who tried to rob Goetz
You don't know what I'm sayin?  Yo check it
Give me any microphone and god dammit I'll wreck it!
I'm coldblooded I'm about to mutilate
Last year before I left I told you to wait
But you couldn't stay loyal started goin astray
Thinking Tom, Dick, and Harry can mess with Cool J
Is you crazy? I'm booming, got the talent of two men
The stamina and skill in battle to kill a few men
The heart of a lion, the loyalty of a soldier
I wreck your whole mob then tell ya I told ya!

Cause I don't jab around you, I come inside
Bob and weave, deceive until you get tongue tied
Brawl for all give a lyrical display
and next time you know better than to get in my way
""Yo whassup wit LL?
Will he ever make another 'Rock the Bells'?""
Yo brothers is coming up, ""I think he's falling off
I don't think he's still 'hard as hell'""
See, this is the attitude, of ignorant ones
cause they don't know, all them MC'sll get done
One or two might say, ""Yo L'll be back""
but the rest they be sucking on sugar smacks
Talking that crap about who's better than me
You think so? Just let a MC
make me mad enough, to really wanna battle
I put a L on his ass like he was cattle!

[Chorus]

Just cause I make a love song, or say a simple rhyme
""Boom, move over L, it's Miller Time""
I don't know whether to laugh, get ill or get wild
Cause brothers don't realize, I got so many styles
like tripling up the words, confusing all the nerds
Heard put my sights on mics and ? flipping above the word
to the mother, no other
MC brother, can mess with Ladies Lover
I'm original, I'm bright under color
And when I get on the mic, yo I burn rubber
Can't stand criticism, give 'em an exorcism
Been rocking for years, now I have wisdom
The way I'm kicking the lines you can hear my tongue twist
and it'll have your neck spinning like you're spineless
I'm picking 'em up, throwing 'em down
Hyping 'em up and slowing 'em down
All of these words with only one tongue
Shaking 'em up and then baking 'em up
Smash boom bash scraping 'em up
Now you thought that was hard, I just begun
Cause I'm a roll on the microphone
And take control just like Al Capone
I'm notorious, you're foolish if you sleep on me
Cause I'm too slick to let a rapper get sweet on me
Try to make a move for my heavyweight belt
You get played like the Wizard of Oz witch, you melt
Yo I'm crazy dope, with super hype lines
and a lot of hype lines make one dope rhyme

LL Cool J,"Do you remember, the first time you fell in love
The way it felt, the way it feels
Being able to say, from the bottom of your heart
I love you for real
Your eyes, meet, you feel your heartbeat
Palms are sweaty you can't keep still
And when you finally touch 'em, and hug 'em and kiss 'em
Oh what a thrill!
You was always searching, and finally your dream came true
They came strolling along
And you promised 'em, straight up and down sweetheart
I swear, I'll never do you wrong
Hand in hand, heart to heart
Nothing in the world could separate the two
And even though you've only known that person for a short time
You tell 'em I love you, you're my heart

You argue witcha parents, and they argue BACK
You're too young to be so serious
You tell 'em that's not true, I'll go on without you
And walk away aggravated and furious
You want 'em to approve, but then again it don't matter
The relationship's yours
You feel you're maturing, and hey,
You can fight your own battles and wars
You discuss it with your love and it's the same for them
So the two of you decide we're gonna weather the storm
Life is sweet, kissing caressing and hugging
And keeping each other warm
But now comes the serious part, 'cause love
Believe me, it ain't a easy task
We'd have one argument too many
And you'd have to ask, am I still your heart?

Am I still your heart or is something, pulling us apart
Cause baby if it is, please let me know what
You run out the door, I tell you come back
I love you, you shout out, so what?
How could you hurt me? How could you treat me
Like you never loved me, were you playing a game?
And if so, I only have one request: sit down and explain
To me, the person who treated you right, did you right
And held you tight, every night
Is there another lover in your life, that has you uptight?
Cause if it is, aw, baby, please, don't do this to me
I'm trying to reach you, trying to talk to you
It's killing me, 'cause you're my heart
That's right I admit it

You're my heart I refuse, to let you go
I struggle and fight for you against all odds
Get down on my knees, and pray to God
That our love is in the cards
Cause I know you're right for me
And I know I'm right for you
There's no way in the world I'll let you slip out of my hands
People say forget about it, move on
But see they don't understand
You're nothing to them, but you're so much to me
So much in fact that I'd give my life
To stare into your eyes and caress your face
As the priest, announces us man and wife
We'd live happily, ever after
White picket fence and the whole nine yards
And anything that anybody said
I'd disregard, if I was still your heart

So make up your mind, 'cause I've made up my mind
I'm begging you baby please come back home
I'll be tossing and turning, as I lay in my bed
Sorrow surrounds me I can feel it in my bones
This can't be true, I'm losing you
Oh Lord have mercy, please make it alright
All I wanna do in this whole wide world, is hold you tight
I've ripped open my heart, shed tears and cried
Now it's up to you baby, please understand
I forgive you for everything, and give you anything
Just let me take ya by the hand
And lead ya, baby I got ya
Protect you like a mother, protects a child
Now it's up to you, I'ma call you in a little while

LL Cool J,"When I'm alone in my room
Sometimes I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind
I hear my conscience call
Telling me I need a girl who's as sweet as a dove
For the first time in my life, I see I need love
There I was, giggling about the games
That I had played with many hearts and I'm not saying no names
Then the thought occurred, Tear drops made my eyes burn
As I said to myself, ""Look what you've done to her""
I can feel it inside, I can't explain how it feels
All I know is that I'll never dish another raw deal
Playing make believe, pretending that I'm true
Holding in my laugh as I say that I love you
Saying amore, kissing you on the ear
Whispering ""I love you"" and ""I'll always be near""
Although I often reminisce, I can't believe that I've found
A desire for true love, floating around
Inside my soul, because my soul is cold
One half of me deserves to be this way till I'm old
But the other half, needs affection and joy
And the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy
I need love

I need love

Romance, sheer delight, how sweet
I've got to find me a girl to make my life complete
You can scratch my back, we'll get cozy and huddle
I'll lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle
Give you a rose, pull out your chair before we eat
Kiss you on the cheek and say ""Ooh girl, you're so sweet""
It's De Ja Vu, whenever I'm with you
I can go on forever telling you what I'll do
But where you at? You're neither here nor there
I swear, I can't find you anywhere
Damn sure you ain't in my closet, or under my rug
This love search, is really making me bugged
And if you know who you are, why don't you make yourself seen?
Take a chance with my love and you'll find out what I mean
Fantasies can run, but they can't hide
And when I find you I'ma pour all my love inside
I need love

I need love

I wanna kiss you, hold you, never scold you, just love you
Suck on your neck, caress you and rub you
Grind, mold, and never be alone
If you're not standing next to me you're on the phone
Can't you hear it in my voice? I need love bad
I've got money but love's something I never had
I need your ruby red lips, sweet face and all
I love you more than a man, who's ten feet tall
I watch the sun rise, in your eyes
We're so in love, when we hug, we become paralyzed
Our bodies explode in extacy unreal
You're as soft as a pillow and I'm as hard as steel
It's like a dream land, I can't lie, I've never been there
Maybe this is an experience that me and you can share
Clean and unsoiled, yet sweaty and wet
I swear to you, this is something I'll never forget
I need love

I need love

See what I mean? I've changed, I'm no longer
A playboy on the run, I need something that's stronger
Friendship, trust, honor respect, admiration
This whole experience has been such a revelation
It's taught me love, and how to be a real man
To always be considerate and do all I can
Protect you, you're my lady and you mean so much
My body tingles all over with the slightest touch
Of your hand, and understand, I'll be frozen in time
Till we meet face to face and you tell me you're mine
If I find you girl, I swear I'll be a good man
I'm not gonna leave it, in destiny's hand
I can't sit and wait, for my princess to arrive
I gotta struggle and fight, to keep my dream alive
I'd search the whole world for that special girl
And when I finally find you, watch our love unfurl
I need love

I need love

Girl, listen to me.
When I be sitting in my room, all alone, staring at the wall,
Fantasies, they go through my mind.
And, I've come to realize that, I need true love.
And if you want to give it to me girl, make yourself seen.
I'll be waiting, I love you.",I Need Love,1990

LL Cool J,"Nothin' can save ya 
Nothin' can save ya
Nothin' can save ya
Nothin'

Just throw your hands in the air 
And wave 'em like you just don't care 
Keep 'em there 
Yo, run the jewels, run the jewels, run the jewels 

Can you feel it?

I used to be rollin' like a millionaire 
Cash in a flash, bankroll to spare 
Homeboys hangin', champagne and girls 
Got my main woman diamonds, my mistress pearls 
Everybody laughin' at my corny jokes 
I was stupid, I thought that they were sincere folks 
It turned out they liked the money and the fame 
If I ain't get paid, I'd be that nobody James 
The nobody who dreamed about bein' somebody 
Chief rocker at the party 
And they was hangin' like, ""Yo, I'm your man 
I don't even care about the ring on your hand"" 
We'd go out to eat and chill 
But they would go to the bathroom 
When it was time to pay the bill 
I didn't notice all the chuckles and laughter 
Too busy with a female, tellin' me I'm the master 
I was slick like, ""Huh, do I know you? 
I got play, here, let me show ya"" 
Used to have a girl that was on the ball 
When the cash flow got low, so did her calls 
Used to have a homeboy, always chillin'
My cash went low; he told me I was illin'
And don't call 'cause he don't hang with derelicts 
Broke with no cash, yo; I was in the mix 
Everybody stepped 'cause my pocket wasn't fat 
My girl got a new man; I fixed his flat 
I'm the one that they're laughin' at 
They say, ""Cheesy rat, you ain't all that"" 

[Chorus]
Can you feel it? 
Can you feel it? 
Can you feel it? 
Can you feel it? 
Nothin' can save ya 

I mean crabbin', played out by backstabbin'; I feel like tyin'
A anchor to my ankle and jumpin' right in the ocean 
Cause I'm ashy, and I can't afford lotion 
So-called friends in the jewelry store 
Told me, ""Todd, come back when you get off tour"" 
Souped as hell; I really regret it 
Now the only thing I got in my pocket is bad credit 
How can a man like me 
Be walkin' around in a world of misery? 
And if women like a man with a body, it's not mine 
Cause they be walkin' past me like I'm a stop sign 
My homeboys laugh when they pass the forty 
Sayin, ""Todd, as if he used to have a sporty"" 
The Benz was slammin', the Jeep was pumpin'
Ain't that somethin'? 
I just laugh; this isn't what I was raised for 
When I walk away, it's like ain't this a
Kick in the rear that I'm standin' here 
And can't afford a tissue for my tear 
Should I drink wine and brandy 
Or get a job puttin' stripes on candy 
Or put a hole in donuts? 
Cause when you're broke, your middle name is ""so-what?"" 
I had to learn in an incredibly fast way 
When you ain't got no money, they treat you like an ashtray 
I pawned all my jewelry and clothes 
Right after that, I got dissed by all the hos 
That I thought was mine but really never was 
Soon the whole neighborhood got the buzz 
That my tank was on ""E"", and that means empty 
That Twinkie looks good, so mister don't tempt me 
Everybody thought I was trippin'
I rode the back of the bus, but my grip kept on slippin'
I'm the man that they're laughin' at 
They say, ""Cheesy rat, you ain't all that"" 

[Chorus]

I want to hang with my man like, ""Let's do this"" 
But this man like, ""Who this?"" 
That's right, the brother got two faces 
They got me puttin' the tips on shoelaces 
P on the Puma, a mop and a bucket 
My motto is: I don't care 
I don't give a damn; so what, why try? 
I might as well rob some Blake Carrington sucker for his money 
It's so funny 
Cars ride by, with the boomin' system 
Sayin, ""Leave him alone, my man already dissed him"" 
Now I'm on the cheese-line, poverty-stricken 
As the red tape thickens 
I go to the park; they want to baseball-bat me 
I go to the mall; they throw my old tapes at me 
I'm so horny 
And every girl I know be like, ""He's so corny"" 
I want money in a hurry 
I'm gettin' tired of leftover curry 
I want to fall off, but I don't know where the edge is 
I'm so hungry, I eat my neighbor's hedges 
Now I realize I gotta go for mine 
It's windshield time 
I take quarters, pennies, dimes, and nickles 
And a kiddy's tricycle 
I'm a desperado 
""I'm a steal your rims"" is my motto 
I watch wrestlin' until I'm dizzy sore 
So if you're cashin' your rent check, know how to get busy 
Go to the drive-through, run with a milkshake 
Go to the supermarket, pocket a raw steak 
I need beer 
I'm a catch the Miller truck out there 
You know how they throw the newspapers in the morning?
The owner don't want 'em 
I'm the man that they're laughin' at 
They say, ""Cheesy rat, you ain't all that."" 

[Chorus]

So yo, one more time, one more time 
Party people in the house tonight 

Just throw your hands in the air 
And wave 'em like you just don't care

It was Frosted Flake, she loved to bowl
And although her skin was white she had a lot of soul
Rich female, very debonair
Drivin' a Rolls with rollers in her hair
We was hangin out, pumpin' the stereo
She took me to a club, I think the name was Cheerio's
She walked like she was jumpin' a hurdle
I was happy as a kid that just saw Mutant Ninja Turtles
A guy walked over, said, ""Your earring's cute.""
I said, ""I'm wearin' a earring, but it ain't no Fruit Loop.""
Me and Frosted went to get a drink
But she ordered somethin' bugged, and I ain't know what to think
She ordered potassium, calcium
Carbohydrate scotch with sodium
She took me to her crib, threw me on the couch

I went to Vegas, didn't think it'd do any harm
I walked into this girl named Lucky Charm
For some reason, we walked in the rain
She had a four-leaf clover with a big gold chain
She had a salary that was full of calories, for real
And I was in the mood for a home cooked meal
So we went to be alone
But we had to be quiet, 'cause her corn pops was home
Kissed her neck, kissed her back, kissed her arms
I said ""Forget it, let me see your lucky charms.""
When we began, her hairstyle was neat
But when I left the next morning it looked like shredded wheat
Talked about marriage, I said ""That's risky
Besides, it's such a waste of Rice Crispies""
She had a robe with the velour material
Her pops woke up, I said ""Hello Mr. Cereal
I came this morning to deliver the paper.""
He said ""Stop frontin', I know you caught the vapors
That's my daughter, so save your croonin'
You better find another bowl of cereal to stick your spoon in.""

[Chorus]

Yeah, check this out here

Then there was Pebbles, times was rough
She was turnin' tricks to get her ""coo-coo puff!""
Her mind was gone, but she turned me on, in fact
She was wearin' an Apple Jack hat
With a full-link fox and some pink bobby-socks
Her father had a greedy disease, fried chicken pocks
We called him Hungry Jack
He talked like pops, and then he dressed like The Mack
He invited me out to lunch
With a old army buddy of his, Captain Crunch
The waiter said, ""Jack, what would you like today?""
He said ""I don't know, just make it Special, 'K?""
He said ""Cool,"" came back with the order
That's when I said, ""Hey yo, Jack, I like your daughter.""
He said ""Pebbles? Boy, are your crazy?""
I said ""Nah, I want to ride in a Mercedes
She could sing while I'm swingin' my thing
'Cause her burgers taste better than Burger King.""
He said ""Go party, do some minglin'
You and my daughter, your brain must be jinglin'""
I said ""It's smooth, no disrespect
She'll sign a pre-nup, so she don't get half of my week cheque.""
Then we walked down the aisle
Our honeymoon was milky cereal style

You know what I'm sayin'?

Peace!",Milky Cereal,1990
LL Cool J,"Nah, y'all, nah, y'all, uh-uh
I ain't disrespectin' though

I'm just sayin' it happen to me
It can happen to him
How you doing?
What's your name?
Oh, you're his girl

Hello, my name is Mr. Goodbar
I'm came to offer champagne 
Later on, maybe, I'll tell you my real name
But for now sip your drink and be merry
And be a nice girl and sing me a cherry
Me, I'll have a Cowa-loo and milk
'Cause champagne always stains my silk
You got a man?  That's somethin' we will talk about
He's smart enough to have ya, but dumb enough to let ya out 
I like ya friendly bag, your alligator shoes 
Ya hairstyle, and ya whole point of view 
The way you lick your lips and stare 
You tell me that's a habit, hmm, yeah
Funny coated legs with not one scar
The stylish wardrobe is up to par 
Here's my number; call me in my car
You deserve a visit from Mr. Goodbar 

So how long you been talkin' to him?
Word, nah, he's cool with me, he's cool with me
Oh, he loves you

Honey, open up a bottle of brandy
Better yet, have a piece of Cool J candy
And sweat the man with the master disaster
Break ya like plaster-plan and
The cards on the table, and the deal is dealt
Uh, I'm in the mood for a tuna melt
And I can't make you; I sure wouldn't rape you
Feelin' kinda mellow, and I sure would hate to leave the job half-done (Nah!)
Cause at a time like this you're the one that I'm lookin' for
Callin' on the floor (Woof!)
I'm comin' back for more
If the Mona Lisa's name was Teresa 
I'll get a piece-a of the Mona Lisa, then smoke a cigar
You deserve a visit from Mr. Goodbar

Yeah, so you be callin' on the request line
oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, he's my man; word him too
Yeah, I like Bobby Brown
Tell him he's cool but

Don't be cruel, 'cause you'll be on your own
Cause my, rockin' my microphone
Come and get this ice-cream cone
Or I'll deliver it when your daddy ain't home
Grown and healthy, that's how I like 'em
Big juicy legs and a nice pair of kegs 
Hmm, Mr. Goodbar style
You haven't met a guy like me in a while
I jump out a cake, dance, play, shake I ain't got no Body By Jake
Smooth as Whitester extra dry Moetzer 
Don and I'll slip it in your mouth like a Bon-Bon

Ya know what I'm sayin'?
I'm Mr. Goodbar, (Goodbar) yeah
So, you know next time, uh, your man is out
Check my,
Nah, nah, he's cool
But my girl, oh, I don't know, your man might be with her, uh
Ya know what I'm sayin'?
But I'm with you, yeah, Mr. Goodbar, baby, uh
May I say, may I say that outfit you got on,
Slim, juicy lips; so honey coated,
Yo, he never says that to you
He never gives you compliments 
Yo, he be givin' you flowers, baby
And tellin' you how much he cares for you
Does he hold you, and caress you, and give you affection
I didn't think so",Mr. Goodbar,1990
LL Cool J,"Hey yo, don't go near the speakers 
The big showdown, the display is skill 
I'm the type of Picasso with ya girl on the pill 
Take a family snap shot, kiss ya wife 
'Cause I'm like a knife, the concrete is right 
And I'll take ya life, and take ya like python 
I'm a do you wrong 
Any emcee who you want to name? 
I want pain that I can be tamed 
Talkin' about guns, punk, it don't alarm me 
Got enough cash to make a whole damn army 
I can't hold back the way that I feel 
'Cause when I bust a rhyme it's like ya slippin' off banana peels 
Ya like fruit cake, ya fruit cocktails 
First your title, now I'm takin' your female 
All of a sudden you're so proud of a black 
A baseball hat but you ain't sayin' jack 
The ripper is back, and you can't escape 
'Cause one of my records will sell more than your whole tape 
I want beef, so bring on the rookies 
I got more than just Cool J cookies 
Rip, rock, crush, stop, cop; I'm poison; come and take a drop 
I bet ya teeth will end up around the corner, kid 
Don't ask me why I did it 
I'm civilized damage to a nobody 
And I'm carrying a gun if I'm rhyming at the party 
New York, Chicago, Detroit, LA 
I'll slay wherever ya play 
D.C. or Philly, or Baltimore 
I'm worrying the rich, invading the poor 
Perpetrating in your video; here's the real smoothing 
Country accents, who do you think you're foolin'? 
I play crushable, late night craps
You only knew 'cause ya onto your raps 
And rap city and B.E.T. 
The channel thirty-one, and, but now here I come 
To save the day and the now you're getting done 
Like a hooker, don't try to soul, crumb 
The first sign of the battle you little fake 
It's, comin' out ya kitchen sink 
Your Mic's a baby bottle, son 
Some say they ain't, but I am the one 
The slice is that the fire, boy, it'll break ya 
Servin' or heard 'em; a word occurred to him 
Then he could move; a would get moved on 
Like a shotgun blast, big mouth emcees, I'll bet ya none last 
'Cause they ain't stable or able 
And I bruise the party like jumper cables 
So plug me in, and put me on 
I'm serial hard, so I can battle amore 
From coast to coast fly, cripple, and crazy 
Use a dictionary, but you still don't phase me 
Listen and we can sound cheap 
Reach out for my blackness, but your records ain't wack this 
Your bitin' on the castle door but when you fall in the moat 
I won't see ya no more 
Let's get together and diss LL 
Use his name and ya records might sell 
I can't believe you found a dead maggots 
Crawlin' all over my name, I won't have that 
You better look in the mirror and re-think your plan 
Why walk in quicksand 
When you can stand on your own two feet?
I'm rippin' emcees a funky drum with a big beat 
Name the date and a or Rainer 
Ya three year old ballerina 
I can't believe the suckers try to throw-down 
Whether you're new or older than old town 
Just kick back; I don't like a, psycho rap 
You can't handle the format 
Whether you're swab or swoon 
Ruff or rugged, all I need is a broom 
If I slay the way they slay, punk play the pay 
Mr. Morris has entered the buffet 
Some of y'all are sittin' in rows 
Plates of hot butter rolls, beat ya with balamey 
Slap ya with salami, 'cause when I get hot I get hot like pastrami 
Then I make ya wonder why you don't hear bass 
But you feel the thunder 
You get cooked; I'll knock out your tooth 
We'll be fighting from lobby to the roof 
You are on me like I wrote your dinnertime 
Yo, Marley 
(Whats up?) Spill the time 
(Nah, man, just kick a little warmth) 
Pass the brass knuckles then we break his jaw 
When I'm on the microphone I want silence 
Let KRS-One stop the violence 
Ain't no rivals, ain't no competition 
Punk, I'm beatin' ya into submission 
I'm gettin' busier than ever before 
Never more will I'll slack, I'm a keep it real raw 
Eat ya up like a pack-jam 
Video is poppin' over a Batman 
Rippin' you to shreds, tappin' you on the head 
Then leave the battle lookin' as happy as a newly wed 
Give me a tech-nine to spray 
Save the peep, and put it on law-away 
I'll make a mailman spin and send a jam the fans will understand 
Feel ya weep about the murdergram",Murdergram,1990
LL Cool J,"Something real smooth
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
We'll get into the groove
Power of God move
Something real smooth
Something you need to take heed to

A base-head cleaned up his act
He stopped smoking crack and took his soul back
Decided, he could find a much better way to live
You know the way, positive
Without all the negative chemicals and drugs
Without all the hanging with the envious thugs
Never before was a man so far behind
And came back to rule for a long time
Positive will explode when you light me
My enemies lurked, and they held the dagger tightly
Wanted to taste my blood, but they got scarred
When they felt the power of God

Wickedness got crushed when the Lord came
Down with the King, cause he's evil and vain
He doesn't understand the power of a ?
Doesn't realize I'm rolling with a team
Avenging angels will come and burn
All those who saw, but refused to learn
He has no color, no shape, and no form
And like I told you before, I'm just getting warm
Get up, get down, get on it, it ain't that hard
You can feel the power of God

Money is small and the soul stands tall
All those who don't realize this, fall
The mind of a drunken fool is a useless tool
And it's cool to be in school
And overcome and overpower, but still uplift
Your mind is a gift
You're somebody, whether you know it or not
Outside the weather is hot
People walk around with their minds in a daze
Never take the time to stop and give praise
You're lucky to live in this world
Even the starving boys and girls
Cause life is a gift in itself
And only certain people are blessed with good health
I'm Uncle L, but you can call me Todd
I can feel the power of God

You know I'm sayin
And G is the seventh letter made
Yeah
G is the seventh letter made

The power of God
Yeah
The babies, we gotta teach em, and hold em
Send em to school, so we can teach em, and mold em
Shape em, and make em take form
Cause their mind is like a ball of clay when it's wet and warm
Harmless and innocent
Until they're taught to be violent, and militant
This mentality gotta be erased by faith
The 12th hour is coming, we're close to the 8th
Get a chapter, and gain some knowledge
If not from the Bible or Koran, get a book from college
It's not about being black or white
It's about everybody being a right
I pulled out my mic, and the devil got hit hard
He felt the power of God

And G is the seventh letter made
Power of god
G is the seventh letter made

That was just a word to the wise
Up rise
Cause we definitely gotta unify
And we need unity in times like these
We got to stick together
Cause we as a people
All people
Gotta make it to the promised land

LL Cool J,"Back in the days I made up my mind
That I would be a king, you know, genuine
Reign supreme at the top of the heap
And like working all day, no time to sleep
Destined to rise, in front of your eyes
So we surmise, it's time for the prize
The time has come, we gotta be number one
The world is full of power and we got to get some
No more beggin' and useless teardrops
So I'm trading these teardrops for props
Goin' all the way and with my powerful team
Conquering the world and I'ma rise like cream
All out, putting heads to bed
'Cause I'm a grown man and I hate to get spoon-fed
Wisdom, son, I rose in the east
Till we reach the top, won't be no peace, 'cause it's

[Chorus:]
Strictly business, strictly business
Ain't no way I'm gonna stop
Strictly business, ain't no time to get more
Gotta make it to the top

Everything we do, gotta be brand new
The moves we make, gotta make the earth shake
Sitting at my desk, 'cause I manifest to my team
Big plans that'll make us the best
'Cause we can rule this game we all play
Pop champagne and make everyday a holiday
Smooth as a rose but hard like steel
From now on, I'ma make my dreams real
On a mission, gotta get there
If you want to rule, you gotta be in there
Our masterplan is the best
And ain't a man alive that'll beat us to a conquest
'Cause this is the reason we was born
To rock on and on and on and on
Look at my eyes, it's hypnotizing
Word is bond, we gotta keep on rising

[Chorus:]

I'ma be a legend in all the books and mags
Stuffin' the cash inside garbage bags
Ain't no time to waste, we gotta motivate
Pass anybody that stops to get gas
Forever and a day, my destiny's set
No sweat, I make it rougher than rougher gets
Hold on tight, if not, get blown away
Pick up the pieces 'cause we're known to say
Radical things to get a champion's ring
Give it up, punk, don't make me swing
We planned ahead to get the butter and the bread
Dressed in black and I'm stayin' out the red
So when it comes to like taking charge
Get props for where they do and stop frontin' on tar
Gotta go for what you know to be the cream of the crop
With the power of God, I'ma rise to the top, it's

LL Cool J,"Just kick a little something for them cars that be bumpin'

Yeah alright
But we need a beat that they can front to
Oh, that'll work
Be funky
You know what I'm sayin'?

(Cars ride by with the boomin systems)
(Cars ride by)

Funky
For all the cars out there
And all the brothers
That like to front in their rides
Check it out

You know it's funky, funky, funky cos you heard it from hear-say
A jam that you love that don't be gettin' no airplay
Strictly for frontin' when you're ridin' around
12 o'clock at night with your windows down
Headlights breakin' 'cause your batteries drain
Armor all on your tires and a big gold chain
Parkin' outside of all the hip-hop spots
Push the E-Q and play connect the dots
Leanin' to the side, people everywhere
The trunk full of amps, there ain't no room for a spare
Big beats bumpin' with the bass in back
All the sophisticated suckers catch a heart attack
Cause they don't understand why I act this way
Pumpin' up the funky beat until the break of day
It's because I want attention when I'm ridin' by
And the girls be on my jock cos my system's fly

Girlies wanna ride with a brother like me
Cause they be hear me gettin' funky frequently
They tell me don't drink and drive, I say what is this
Mind your business
Now pass it around
Laid back, hypnotized by the funky sound
People in the street see me bobbin my head
While I'm checking out the rapper and the rhyme that he said
I'm fronting, and I don't care if you know
The backseat of my car is like a disco show
You would think I was a good friend of Al Capone
Crazy air freshener, who needs cologne
Bottom to the bottom to the top to the top
Cruise, it's 3 o'clock
The girlies, they smile, they see me coming
I'm steady huming, I got the Funky Drumer druming
My trunk be shaking, vibrating and rattling
Pumping so loud, all the shorties be battling
A right-hand man's here without the swing
Every chance I get I'm showing off my rings
I can keep it up until the break of dawn
Cos I'm fronting in my ride and my word is bond

Sun roof open, so I can feel the wind blow
I don't give a damn if it cracks my back window
C to the o to the o to the l to the i to the n
To the f to the r to the o to the 'n' to the t to the i to the n
That means I'm chilling
Like Spoonie Gee said, my seats are soft like a bed
They recline way back, so I can get real cosy
I got the gangster tapes in the place
Like a base-head would say I want bass
I want a hit, I want a dose
You're rolling up smiling, but you can't come close
Cos my system is pumping loud
Like Rakim said I wanna move the crowd
I warm it up with Kane, fight the power with PE
Tell the cops you gots to chill with EPMD
This is something devastating that'll break your trunk
And remember, Uncle L is like the future of the funk

You know what I'm saying

Just remember

Rhymes so bizarre 
Everybody knows 
When it come to a situation like this 
Little more effects 
And I can't resist 
So we get funky in the house 
You know what I'm sayin'? 
L.L. Cool J style 
What? 
This ain't on a pop tip 
Check it out 
 
What is a panther? A animal that kills 
I'm like a shark with blood comin' out the gills 
You could never in your wildest dreams 
Get a piece of this gangsta, lean, straight from Queens 
Strong as liquor, to be seen in a limousine 
Now you're gettin' done without Vaseline 
Wouldn't bite because your rhymes are puppy chow 
Made another million, so competitors bow 
Homeboy, hold on, my rhymes are so strong 
Nothing could go wrong, so why do you prolong?
Songs that ain't strong, brother, you're dead wrong 
And got the nerve to have them Star Trek shades on 
Ha, you can't handle the whole weight 
Skin needs lotion, teeth need Colgate 
Wise up you little burnt-up french fry 
I'm that type of guy 
And I slammed you know, just like a sumo 
Put him in pampers, leave my drawers in his hamper 
When I'm through, you need a brand-new identity 
I was scoopin' girls before you lost your virginity 
Your jam is just a dreamin' MC scheme 
gettin' crushed by a L.L. theme 
somethin' like Shaft, put you in a cask', bo! 
You little blood-clot boy, you must not know 
The rep I keep, the MC's I peep, sweep, play cheap 
And freak with a chic, unique technique 
Get rid of the yuk-mouth smile 
'Cause brother, you ain't got no style

But check this out here 
(Rock that shit) 
(To the break of dawn) 
Yeah

Immaculate styles, I used to abuse 
MC's, so light the fuse 
And spread the news, you lose 
To the damager, microphone manager 
Cold crush, and bruise, and bandage a amateur 
That amateur, swingin' a hammer 
From a body bag, so run and get your camera 
Get a flick of the stiff dead-shot to get swift 
But I'm the wrong brother to dance with 
'Cause I don't need a partner to swing 
Keep your eyes on the Cool J ring 
shootin' the gift, but you just don't shoot it right 
You couldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight 
Wouldn't throw a rock in a ghost town 
So don't try to play post, clown 
You know the L.L.'s back in town 
And all the want-to-be sherrifs is gettin' shot down 
Gimme that microphone 
I'm a show you the real meaning of the danger zone 
Stop dancin', get to walkin'
Shut your old mouth when young folks is talkin'
Huh, you little snake in the grass 
You swing a hammer, but you couldn't break a glass 
Gimme a lighter, woof! 
Now you're cut loose 
From that Jheri curl juice 
Cool J is back on the map 
And when I see ya, I'm a give you a slap 
That's right, a little kick for that crap 
'Cause my old gym teacher ain't supposed to rap

Check this out 
Yeah

How dare you stand beside me?
I'm Cool, I freeze I-C-E 
On your trail, and I'm a cut that bull tail 
You're disobedient with the wrong ingredients 
But I'm a drink you down over the rocks 
While I freak on your album cover jocks 
You're gonna hear a real ill paragraph soon 
I took the cover right home to the bathroom 
In the immortal words of L.L., 'hard as hell' 
Your broad wears it well 
She's the reason that your record sold a few copies 
But your rhymes are sloppy 
Like Oscar, and you're bound to get dropped 
And stopped, I ain't Murray the cop 
Nor am I Felix, but I got a bag of tricks 
Mr. Pusherman, gimme a fix 
So I can show you I'm immune to them Romper Room tunes 
You little hip-hop racoon 
I'm not Scarface, but I want more beef 
Before you rapped, you was a downtown car thief 
Workin' in a parking lot 
A brother with a perm deserves to get burned 
So tell me how you like your coat, cream? 
On a cone, in a bowl, or in a wet dream? 
With your tv on channel fuzz 
Uncle L, that's how much damage he does 
Here's five dollars, catch a taxi cab 
Take your rhymes around the corner to the rap rehab 

Keep on 
(To the break of dawn) 
Yeah 
(To the break of dawn) 
I say keep on 
(To the break of dawn) 

Just wanted to funk it up a little bit 
My man Pete Rock is up in the crib 
You know what I'm sayin'?
Over here at Marley Marl house 
Just coolin' out 
My man Clash in the house 
Sippin' on this Bartles and Jaymes premium piece flavor out the cooler 
Loungin' back 
Keep on

LL Cool J,"The President woke and he called the Pope
The Pope climbed to heaven on a golden rope
P.S. the Lord raised Michelangelo from the dead
So he can make a fresh painting of my head
Then I hung out with a king and a queen
And the queen put me down with her polo team
The way I scored points all around the clock
I had her daughter, the princess riding my jock
I knocked the freak off like a crazy retard
Then I took a little trip into a deck of cards
The diamond jack joker and the ace of spades
Was amazed at greater Cut Creator on the fade
Then I played cards with the queen of clubs
The queen of hearts with me cold fell in love
As for the queen of diamonds, she don't like men
Because you know that a diamond is a girl's best friend
The double-trouble spade was named the deuce
And the joker acted stupid, so we gave him the news
There was 52 cards, and I met everyone
That story is over, but my rhyme ain't done

Then I took a trip to the center of the earth
I was kinda scared, so E-Love went first
I met these funny little people, they called em skeezers
So I held on to my wallet like Ebeneezer
Tight leather pants that'll make you grunt
Two nice soft things right up front
The center of the earth ain't got no crime
Just people body rockin' to the L.L. rhyme
If you're kinda confused to what a skeezer is
It's just a girl who's on my jock cause I'm in showbiz
There was a whole lot of skeezers, I dogged everyone
That story is over, but my rhyme ain't done

Woke up late one afternoon
Realized I was in the world of cartoons
He-Man told me he'd beat me up
Because he thought that I looked like Donald Duck
Then I hung out with Spiderman
He told me he was gonna start a comic strip band
The Incredible Hulk was gonna play the drums
Charlie Brown grabbed the guitar and started to strum
Snoopy tried to rock on the microphone
But Tom & Jerry both said he should leave it alone
Then I hung out with Mickey Mouse
He had two freaks, so we went to his house
Mickey's freak was ugly, but mine was def
So I knocked it off until there wasn't none left
They were cartoon characters, I met everyone
That story is over, but my rhyme ain't done

Since I'm a good friend of father time
I'm not getting older as I say this rhyme
I was warming the stove at the Alamo
Before Booth shot Lincoln I stole the show
I was down with George at the Delaware
But I wore a Kangol, not the fake white hair
Me and E-Love met Sitting Bull
We made a peace pipe, then we took a pull
Then he brought more leaves from a golden chest
You thought it was tobacco, the shit was cess
There was a lot of great men, and I met everyone
That story is over, but my rhyme ain't done

11:33, I swear it's no sooner
I went inside my TV, I met _The Honeymooners_
Ralph wanted me to bust a couple of rhymes
But I had my eyes on Alice's behind
Norton came down right about that time
Looking in the fridge, so he could swine and dine
Then I said to myself, I should give em a taste
So I pulled the microphone out my black briefcase
Said, it ain't Bob Hope or Barry Manilow
Then I borrowed Norton's hat, cause I forgot my Kangol
Ralph said, ""I got a scheme, let me get to it""
""Norton, my pal,"" I said, ""Yo, don't even do it""
They were all Honeymooners, and I met everyone
That story is over, but my rhyme ain't done

Cause my tongue cuts sharp, I hit a note like a harp
Or a harmonica, Veronica, I do my part
In a bedroom with leg room I'm strong like a monsoon
Chilled in Maui-Waui and I carry a harpoon
Stopped at the isle that's Mali, cause we got ill
Wrote my name on a rock at the top of the hill
I searched for other ways, made love in caves
And I kicked the ill beats that make the natives raise
Now I'm gonna tell you what all this means
From Farmers Boulevard in St. Albans, Queens
There's a lyrical technician who came to play
Number one b-boy L.L. COOL J
All of this is just a story that I made up
Def lines I say on time with Cut Creator's cuts
Some of it's fiction, and some of it's fact
Not another common rap with a heavy drum track
A whole lot of rhymes, and I wrote everyone
That story is over, and my rhyme is done
Huh!",My Rhyme Ain't Done,1992
LL Cool J,"My radio, believe me, I like it loud
I'm the man with a box that can rock the crowd
Walkin' down the street, to the hardcore beat
While my JVC vibrates the concrete
I'm sorry if you can't understand
But I need a radio inside my hand
Don't mean to offend other citizens
But I kick my volume way past ten
My story is rough, my neighbourhood is tough
But I still sport gold, and I'm out to crush
My name is Cool J, I devastate the show
But I couldn't survive without my radio
Terrorising my neighbours with the heavy bass
I keep the suckas in fear by the look on my face
My radio's bad from the Boulevard
I'm a hip-hop gangster and my name is Todd
Just stimulated by the beat, bust out the rhyme
Get fresh batteries if it won't rewind
'Cause I play everyday, even on the subway
I woulda got a summons but I ran away
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go
But I know I can't live without my radio

Suckas on my jock when I walk down the block
I really don't care if you're jealous or not
'Cause I make the songs, you sing along
And your radio's deaf when my record's on
So get off the wall, become involved
All your radio problems have now been solved
My treacherous beats make ya ears respond
And my radio's loud like a fire alarm
The floor vibrates, the walls cave in
The bass makes my eardrums seem thin
Def sounds in my ride, yes the front and back
You would think it was a party, not a Cadillac
'Cause I drive up to the ave, with the windows closed
And my bass is so loud, it could rip your clothes
My stereo's stompin' like a savage beast
The level on my power meter will not decrease
Suckas get mad, 'cause the girlies scream
And I'm still gettin' paid while you look at me mean
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go
But I know I can't live without my radio
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go
And I know I can't live without my radio

Don't touch that dial, I'll be upset
Might go into a fit and rip off your neck
'Cause my radio's thumpin' when I'm down to play
I'm the royal chief rocker LL Cool J
Let your big butt bounce from right to left
'Cause it's a actual fact this jam is def
Most definitely created by me
Goin' down in radio history
I'm good to go on your radio
And I'm cold gettin' paid 'cause Rick said so
Make the woofers wallop and your tweeters twitch
Some jealous knuckleheads might try to diss
But it's nuthin', ya frontin', ya girl I am stuntin'
And my radio's loud enough to keep you gruntin'
My name is Cool J, I'm from the rock
Circulating through your radio non-stop
I'm lookin' at the wires behind the cassette
And now I'm on the right, standing on the eject
Wearin' light blue Pumas, a whole lotta gold
And jams like these keep me in control
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go
And I know I can't live without my radio

Your energy level starts to increase
As my big beat is slowly released
I'm on the radio and at the jam
Ll Cool J is who I am
I'mma make you dance, boogie down and rock
And you'll scratch and shake to my musical plot
And to expand my musical plan
Cut Creator, rock the beat with your hand

That's right, so don't try to front the move
As you become motivated by the funky groove
You can see me and Earl chillin' on the block
With my box cold kickin' with the gangster rock
See people can't stop me, neither can the police
I'm a musical maniac to say the least
For you and your radio I made this for
Cool J's here to devastate once more
Pullin' all the girls, takin' out MCs
If ya try to disrespect me, I just say 'Please!'
Here to command the hip-hop land
Kick it live with a box inside my hand
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go
But I know I can't live without my radio

Farmers Boulevard
Yeah, you know that's where me and E hang out
Cool out, you know what I'm sayin'?

What the hell are you lookin' for?
Can't a young man make money anymore?
Wear my jewels and, like, freak it on the floor
Or is it my job to make sure I'm poor?
Can't my car look better than yours?
Keep a cigar in between my jaws
I drink champagne, to hell with Coors
Never sold coke in my life, I do tours
Get that flashlight out of my face
I'm not a dog, so, damn it, put away the mace
I got cash and real attorneys on the case

Shooting up ya damn fools.
Leavin' your loser

Now your slobbing Marly's mob
For a dope track.
Coming off like a bra
And its the witness.

A fru ? business
Don't care about no money
Got props in it.
Flipping scripts
With every letter in
The alphabet.
Wanna jump. 
Jump!
And jingle your rump. 
Rump!
Here to pump punks
With real hot lead chunks.
Full-grown
I ain't no baby with
These rhymes kid.
Put the mic down
My peoples know where ya live.
I chop you little
Brittle riddle
Right up the middle
And have the police
Playing the fiddle
In the hospital.
Somebody said, ""He
Couldn't rip with the
Roughness.""
Rhymes kick your teeth
But end up front less.
Soul survivor of a
Thousand beats
Sending funeral wreathes
To all ya use-to-be chiefs.

To a bearlin' in the woods?
Brothers tapes ain't jack
Their best tracks is wack.
I heard you think you
Got a chance to win
But my glock is stopped off
To murder the top ten.
Rough and rugged and raw
I'm like a callous.
The underground can say
""ain't no Fra-zontin
In my palace.""

Well can I be the
Flavor of the month?
I got the flavor
Plus I can bump a chump.
I got the funk
Straight from my
Underground hide-out.
I freak it in the house
And let the hits just
Ooz out.
Bust on the scene
To let ya know I
Wasn't fronting
Got ya screaming for my album
So I had to do something.
Write tonight
To take a bit
Not a bite.
And watch the ?
Freak you with
All my might.
Like ""Here I am to
Save the day!""
I stop the tracks
With the mic
So I say ""To chay""
And ""On Gaurd""
When I'm swinging for your brow.
Cause in the house of hits
Ain't no fronting allowed.

Just when you thought
That it was safe
To try and chop me.
Run for ya life
Now here somes Mr. Funky
And I'm pissed.

I'll be the takeout
Boy ya better look out
I work ya like a cook-out.

And you watch me do my thing.
Because I hit ya with the funk
Of the fly-talker
And make your girl
""Bump-bump! 
Get it, get it!""
Like Luke Skywalker.
I can't front
I love rapping with a passion.
Crash your head front
Into the funk
You think I'm slam dancing
See when you front
You make mad
The alter weight ?
Freak this:
""funky twin powers activate!""
Sheik on the mic
With the cape and muscles.
Crushing MC's
While their girls
Do the hustle.

Try to dis the lords
But yo, your dead wrong.
Dammit, can't we all
Just get along?
We'll see
There simply ain't no

Peace to the Funky Child.

Punching your
God-damn eyebrows
Off
Roughing it up north
Lookin' like your
Laugh off ?
It's a blash smash
And crash from my stash.
Be watching your back kid.
Your girl and the phat path.
Talking bout your macks and tax.
What's with that?
Your getting wet like
Slow sex.
Ripping on that old school kid.
Leaving sliced as a slit
Says I wet your crib.
No question.
Testing the west
And the east and
Once the ammo was released and
I'll make your girl
Come and getcha.
Hope you get the picture.
Boy your better off

In the illest fight.

I'm giving crowds more
Nose jobs than Mike.
Fight sight alright
They bite
Spot light tonight
Is hype
Trigger happy tripe
Don't hit bite
My owner's right.
And ya know it's coming off
So don't ask it.
Snatching the vocal
And hotties on the rap tip.
Macking ya boys up.
Bringing the noise up.

Because my voice cuts.

Your rippers' man applause when he can't get a job

Cause they don't realize what it is to be a black man
In the mornin', a brother feels like a jerk
Seein' black women and white men go to work
So all women fear, the brothers ain't real
Cause they won't give us no jobs, that's the real deal
Hold my hand while I get it all together
They don't deserve me at times of bad weather
Cause I'ma make it out the concrete walls
And there's another way besides basketball
Let me go, let me do what I do
I'm red, black and green, then red, white and blue

You're seein' gold teeth, ya hearin' funky beats
Brothers ride by real slow
You get leary when they got tinted windows
Sittin' on the steps with a blunt
I'm drinkin' Valentine, I wasn't raised up front
My Aunt Ellie always talked about God
Tell me you never cried cause its so hard

And you ain't in between the Isley Brothers' sheets

You'll tell your girlfriends, won't ya? (nah)
Don't lie 
Take it in your eye (why?)
So buckle up, buckle up

I'll put your numbers in the archives

It's so firm, so cushy, it makes me feel mushy

Killin' bears and kickin' snitches right off the pier
Glock full of guts, steady buckin' butts

Conferring emcee scramble, dismantle
Never gamble and try to handle a vandal

Sixteen-now it's about the time to set my first hit off

Rockin' the bells like a madman
Dissin', event-flippin' the script-but then I made my first $50,000

Stick you for ya dough, spit on the flo',
Drag it out of ya, bring it on.
I smack him back down, yo dope, word is bond.
I know you want a piece of the champ,
But you roll too weak, you couldn't make it in my camp.
You thought I went for the flip,
But I'm bustin' off hip-hop, clip after clip.
I kept you out there, ripped you for your wear.
Jump inside your video, bust you with a chair.
Smack, slap, smack, slap, smack, slap, smack.
Just to make it worse and hurt your pride I'll run it back,

So stigetty step up and get your nostrils damaged.
Shootin', lickin', bustin', sprayin', all of that,
And then some, dead, dead, dead, one by one. 
Never step to a real man,
Cause your rhymes only work on a playground program.
They impress your little friends, bring you a little ends,
But you still you gotta ride in your man's benz.

Gotta set you on fire, cause I gassed ya.

You want to take me out, how many bunch ya smoke? 
I'll never slack again, I'm off the job like the mob.

What you gotta deal with is real, made of steel.

Take off your clothes, and taste the steel.

Open up your mouth, and taste my gallot.
When your jaw breaks your gold teeth will fall.
Down will come the monkey, banana clip, and all.

Another plan O.D.'ed over my war hit.
The way I'm workin', and jerkin', and hurtin', brothers converted.
Non-believers get murdered, 'cause I waffle birded.
Get your face out the bill, catch the thrill.
Carry a nine, put your hootchies on the bill.
The thought of you gettin' scared turns me on,
Like my first television with my backup tip hard.

So where's your mouth kid?  Where's your heart, shorty? 
It's all over, cash your chips in, crack a forty.
You look thirsty, you ain't gettin' no mercy, mercy,
And ain't no way that you can rehearse for me.
Murder I wrote, murder I wrote, is what I figure.
It's in my tote, it's in my tote, so I pull the trigger.
Put up your women, your crib, your speakers,
Your dog, your cat, your crate, your speakers,
Your sister, your aunt, your crew, your Knicks.
Got 'em booin', all you mother rappers who think that's too tough.
Bam, bam, here's a hit you wish you had.
A hit that makes you mad, a hit that makes you slap your dad.
Dead, dead, dead, kill, dead, kill, dead.
Try to battle me, I gots to buck you in your head.
I pull your file, click.
I know you're good to style, blow.

What's wrong with these stupid lunatics playin' ""Joint"" for a drag-bit?
I'm harder than-?find in a jar?
People wasn't rippin' these records, all of why'all would get robbed
I'm comin' straight out the barrel with your name on my arm
Blowin' the hoody of your head like a home-made bomb (BOOM!!)
I'm big and so you figured I would relax (nah!)
Don't ever sleep I'll wake ya up with an axe
The Boulevard ain't safe for my beats - drop the herb
Twenty times harder without a curse
Makin' rats flee, hardcore - and that's me!!
The baddest soloist in hip-hop history

My territory's hard, I'm rollin' with one railguard
The microphone is my credit card
Blowin' your boots off, freeload, you're too soft
Usin' a butcher's knife to make your whole root call
I heard somebody said the skills wasn't good
I'm lettin' eighty tigers loose in this neighborhood 
I pop the willies on my bike, lickin' shots
And laughin' everytime you sneak a weak paragraph in
You blowin' your mind, blunted and cocoa and time
Ain't nothing changed, you wrote another wack rhyme
I'll leave your bullet-bittled body on the curb
Lookin' slerve with a t-shirt, don't disturb the herb!
You're the next contestant tonight
Come on down to my shake clown, the slice is right
Rip your jaw out the socket, been rockin' for years
Tell the troop, you're still look with E and drop it!
As I deaf-tify your eye, competition tries to mass my size!
Buryin' the acts and your back will be rhymes and tracks
While you're sleepin' like a ""sleaze-stack"" believe that!

Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on (soul survivor), come on

LL Cool J,"Yeah this one goes out to all the ladies in the house 

I need two to stand by me when the chips are down and 
Stick around while I defend my crown and 
No sell-out, the chip is too rough and 
I'll blow your skin to sofa, leave your mind to be tough 
And I might seem rough but life is much rougher 
To see success sometimes you gotta suffer 
I need a woman that's stronger than material needs 
And isn't motivated by green 
Dry my tear-drops and feelin' my pain and 
Watchin' my back while I strive to maintain and 
Makin' love like a medicine doctor 
I knew that she was bad from the day that I clocked her 

Stand by your, man, stand by your man 
You got to stand by your baby 
Stand by your, man, stand by your man 
You got to stand by your baby 

My enemies come and my break-bread's tough but 
You recognize game from your eyes and walkin' 
Baby ain't no way I'll let the vultures attack you 
So I'll teach you the game and tell you how to react to 
The conversation, sexy vibration 
Visual stimulation, slick persuasion 
Times are hard, I need a woman that rolls by God 
And the only man she loves is Todd 
But will you be around when the raindrops fallin' 
Or could it be you never loved me at all and 
I need a trooper, a soldier, a agent 
I need someone who can roll with my arrangement 
The reap reducer factor and 
The Queen of the Universe, not an actor and 
Standin' by her man till the end 
Not only as a lover but a friend 

Stand by your, man, stand by your man 
You got to stand by your baby (yeah) 
Stand by your, man, stand by your man 
You got to stand by your baby 

Man, do things get better? 
We can look back at the whole aerators 
Remember the times when they said I couldn't do it 
But I was rougher than rough and baby you knew it and 
You held back when your loved jobs called in 
You had faith when they said they're not callin' 
You understood that what we had was good 
You stood by your man like a real queen should 
That's why now I got you livin' your dream as 
A beautiful wisdom, a part of my team and 
As long as I live on this earth 
Anything you want is what your loyalty's worth 

Stand by your, man, stand by your man 
You got to stand by your baby 
(I wanna send this one out to all the ladies in the house) 
Stand by your, man, stand by your man 
You got to stand by your man 
Stand by your, man, stand by your man 
You got to stand by your baby, (word) 
Stand by your, man, stand by your man 
You got to stand by your man (peace) 
You got to stand by your baby 
You got to stand by your man 
Stand by your, man, stand by your man 
You got to stand by your baby 
Stand by your, man, stand by your man 
You got to stand by your man

As soon as I set this off

To make ya jingle.

I make ya maggot ass crawl out the gutter 
For underestimating as I'm creating the butter 
Cliques get clipped like heavy bricks when I'm dropping
I'm wrecking nigga whole shit plus I make a profit 
Wicked with this shout, bodies are fished out 
I'm wrecking niggas one-by-one but then I miscount 
Mispronounced, how do LL bounce

You clowns know when I bring forth the heat

I'm on a journey through the land of fronting niggas 
Nervous motherfuckers with the hands on dirty triggers 
I lay back, niggas beef or let my nuts live

Found his ol' Earth's burner underneath the mattress

I got Higher Learnin' 
And bangin' gets monotonous 
Her ass is classic 
Cheeks was Jurassic 
Servin' a Justice 
Poetic the way I last it 
I touch ground, real windy, with my lyrics 
Make her talk in tongues, and feel the Holy Spirit 
Hear it, pulling light strings 
Got mad cast a swing 
When I do my thing, my ballz is hairy like the Lion King 
I'm in the jungle, layin' down my mack

Running game while you chill with the Demolition Man 
Good love, have fun, tight hugs and flowers 
I have your girl runnin' off to fake baby showers 
Better get down before ya cryin' at home 
I got her standing on the bed gettin' closer to the Drop Zone 
Some brother's won't appreciate that 
Ain't it scary when you meet a real mack?
Let's run it back 
See the flavors in my lifestyle, chill don't even lie to me 
Balls a lethal weapon, dick a menace to society
You ain't a player-hater, kid, you took her off restriction 
I make her tell lies and knock the pulp out of fiction

I hope she screams my name right

Sixteen years, twenty million albums, yeah you're climbin'
I love your joint 'rock the bells', it was mad hot 
Ya record 'bout the radio was blowin' up my spot 
My girl was on your chip when you flipped 'I need love' 
Your backseat count set was mad butter, son 
I loved your boomin' system it was wicked as could be 
You bad, now I'm writin' on your pink cookies 
And you had me screamin' 'mama said knock ya out' 
Ya jinglin', baby, no doubt 
Uh, talk to me (what, what, uh, uh) become a zombie, walk to me 
Ain't a MC alive who fought with me

Ten times platinum your career's looking critical
Reach for this, mother fuck being a criminal
Look in your bitch eyes, the vibe is subliminal
You wanna freestyle fuck that
I need at least seven figures to even touch that
But since everybody was underestimatin' my format
I dropped Ill Bomb and now niggas want more of that
Ain't a rapper dead or alive fucking with me
Ask the last bitch that tried to come and get me
Talk about paper, I can talk about broads
I can talk about movies, I can talk about awards
Fuck the fantasies, yo I got all four
And 2001'll be mine, by law
Why name the Greatest Of All Times?
Because for fifteen years I kept y'all standing in line
Loving the way I shine and my lyrics combine
With the ruggedest, illest beats that Def Jam can find
Fuck them other niggas with their 9 or 10 hits
My hits run deep as the emotions of your bitch
Back in the days it was the M fast stick
But now the Bentley is all get more whores on the dick
This ones for Clue and my Riker's Island niggas

Warm it up sugar, make it hot, shorties'll swarm, 
make me want to bust shots, 
we speak daily on the regular, 
run your jibs all day chip in my cellular
Shoot down to Jamaica, pretty white sand, 
suntan oil, pina' coladas in my hand
Laying up at night, peepin' at stars, 
remember, when we was at the club in the bars?
I told ya my status was that of a don, 
you thought I was a dog and you ain't want to 
Get it on, but my mind has attractin' qualities, 
all the emotions of a young lady
So here you are, smack dab up in the mix, 
shorty this here's about as good as it gets
Word up, I'ma treat you like a queen from the heart, 
crack the bubbly, and let the 
Episode start.

[Chorus]",Loungin,1996
LL Cool J,"Captured effortlessly
That's the way it was
Happened so naturally
I did not know it was love
The next thing I felt was
You holding me close
What was I gonna do?
I let myself go

And now we're flyin' through the star
I hope this night will last forever

I've been waitin' for you
It's been so long
I knew just what I would do
When I heard your song
Filled my heart with your bliss
Gave me freedom
You knew I could not resist
I needed someone

And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever
Oh oh oh oh

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you

I wait for night time to come
And bring you to me
Can't believe I'm the one
I was so lonely
I feel like no one could feel
I must be dreamin'
I want this dream to be real
I need this feelin'

I make my wish upon a star
And hope this night will last forever

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you

And first you put your arms around me
Then you put your charms around me
I can't resist this sweet surrender
Oh my nights are warm and tender
We stare into each other's eyes
And what we see is no surprise
Got a feeling most with treasure
And a love so deep we cannot measure

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you",Ain't Nobody,1996

Yeah,L.O.D.
Keith Murray, Def Squad
Mista, Mista, Mista, Mista Smith
You wanna hit? (You wanna hit?)
Gimme an hour plus a pen and a pad

Yo, I'm here to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
And let my balls hang like I'm on a toilet takin a shit
My style is all that, and a big bag of chips wit the dip
Fuck all that sensuous shit
I represent intellectual violence
And leave your click holier than the Ten Commandments
Like Redman I shift with the ruck
If ya if was a spliff we'd be all fucked up (Word up!)
No need to ask you who is he, Son I get busy
Scuff my Timbs on the boulevard of many ruff cities (Chicago, LA, any of them)
I'll have to Norman Bate ya I love ta hate ya
Cause you'se a freak by nature
Can't wait to face ya, mutilate ya
Drink your style down straight wit no chaser (Word up!)
My verbal combat's like a mini-Mac to your back
As soon as one of you niggaz try to over react
The L.O.D. love good confrontation or vamp (Word up!)
Break your concentration, murder your camp
For the jealous, overzealous, we fellas
Blow the the spot like Branford Marsalis
Niggas coming through and acting wild
Y'all commercial niggas better have a Coke and a smile
I shot ya!

Yo, I conversate wit many men, it's time to begin again
Forgot what I already knew, hey yo you hear me friend?
Illuminati want my mind, soul, and my body
Secret society, trying to keep they eye on me
But I'm stay incogni', in places they can't find me
Make my moves strategically, the G.O.D.
It's sorta similar but iller than a chess player
I use my thinker, it coincides with my blinker
While you wondered what we saying on the records real
Yeah you motherfucking right kid you know the deal
My Mobb is Infamous just like the fucking title read
You get back slapped so hard make ya nose bleed
Some, kids feeling guilty bout the,
But you first baby girl so just face it (alright)
But anyway, back on the real side of things
My niggas sling cracks and wear fat diamond rings
Not only is it inside the songs that we sing (kid)
Everything is real not just a song that we sing (word up, it's real)
From my life to the paper (what), very accurately
Give you all of my two so maybe you can three
Prodigy will forever will S-H-I-N-E (shine baby, just shine)
My shit attract millions like the moon attract the sea
How dare you ever in your life walk past me
Without acknowledging this man as G-O-D
I shot ya fagot ass

Now who the fuck you think you talking to, I pay dues I spray crews
Look I'm Joey Crack, motherfuckers be like he's bad news
Running this racket, from New York to Montego
Slaughtering people, bring a ton of keys from Puerto Rico
I'd rather be feared than loved because the fear lasts longer
These bitch ass niggas know we stronger
Than these weaklings, seeking, for respect that ain't there
Knuckleheads beware, there's mad tension in the air
Tommy guns for fun, shotties for block parties
While fresh lead heats up your insides like a fifth of Bacardi
Call the ambulance, this man's wet
Bullets cut him down from the root up just like a Gillette
Razor, which I keep hidden in my oral
Ready to spatter, at any ad out, that wants to quarrel
These feds want me for some tax evasion
Now that the fact that somebody's getting lucci that's not Caucasian
Bullets be blazing through these streets filled with torture (what the deal pop)
Joey Crack, a.k.a. Kaiser Ceaser

Thug niggas give they minks to chinks
To' down we sip drinks rockin minks, 
Flashing rings and things (what the deal)
Fronting hardcore deep inside the Jeep, macking
Doing my thing fly nigga you a Scarface king
Bitches grab ya ta-ta's, get them niggas for they cheddar
Fuck it, Gucci sweaters and Armani leathers
Flossing rocks like the size of Fort Knox
Four carats, the ice rocks, pussy banging 
Like Versace locs pops (what the deal)
Want ta the creep, on the light raw ass cheeks
I'm sexing raw dog without protection, disease infested
Italiano got the Lucciano
I gets down fucking with Brown Fox extra keys to the drop
Boo I'm Jingling Baby, I got crazy Dominicans who pay me
To lay low, I play slow
Roll with the Firm, Mafiaso crime king pin
It all real nigga what tha deal
I shot ya!

What the fuck? I thought I conquered the whole world
Crushed Moe Dee, Hammer, and Ice-T's girl
But still, niggas want to instigate shit
I'll battle any nigga in tha rap game quick
Name the spot, I make it hot for ya bitches
Female rappers too, I don't give a fuck boo
Word, I'm here to crush all my peers
Rhymes of the month in The Source for twenty years
Niggas scared, I'm detrimental to your mental state
I use my presidential Rolex to be debate
Niggas fight, glock cocked ya temple gets fucked
MC's, that fuck with LL they gets bucked
That's real, what's up with that I Shot Ya deal?
Light shit, niggas slip now how the bullet feel?
New York appeal, in L.A. they gang bang
But if you touch a mic your motherfucking ass hang
That's facts, niggaz don't receive no type of slack
Cause if they do, they ass is always running back
Not this time, but next time I'ma name names

I've been watching you from afrar
For as long as I can remember
You're all a real man could need
And could ever ask for baby
This is more than a crush
Yeah

It was Harlem at the Rukus
I saw you with your man, a smiling, huh
A coach bag in your hand
I was laying in the coupe with my hat turned back
We caught eyes for a moment and that was that

So I skated off as you strolled off
Looking at your legs, god damn, they look so soft (so fine)
I gotta take ya from your man, that's my mission
If his love is real he's got to handle competition
You only knew him for five months, that's right
Besides he drinks too much, and smokes too many blunts

And I'll be working out everyday thinkin' about you
Looking at my own eyes in the rear view
Catching flashbacks of our eye contact
Wish I could lay you on your stomach and caress your back
I would hold you in my arms and ease your fears
I can't believe it, I ain't had a crush in years

[Chorus]
Hey lover, hey lover
This is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover
This is more than a crush, lover
Hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover
This is more than a crush

I see you at the bus stop waiting every day
Your man must think it's safe for you to travel that way
And I don't want to violate your relationship
So I'll lay back in the cut with a crush that's a trip

Still he can't stop me from having daydreams
Tongue'n you down with uh, vanilla ice cream
Kissing on your thighs in the moonlight
Searching you body with my tongue girl all night

I wonder one day could it be, I wonder
Simple dreams could turn into reality
Our love would come down so naturally
We would walk down the aisle of destiny

Would your man get his hustle on, got your type scared
Break your off a little chump change to do your hair
It seems to be enough to satisfy your needs
But there's a deeper level if you follow our lead

[Chorus]

Last week I saw ya at the mall
Standing at the pay phone about to make a call
I had a vision it was me on the other end
Telling you come by and then you walked in

I touched you gently with my hands
We talked about traveling the distant lands
Escaping all the madness out here in the world
Becoming my wife no longer my girl

Then you let your dress fall down to the floor
I kissed you softly and you yearned for more
We experienced pleasure unparalleled
Into an ocean of love we both fell

Swimming in the timeless currents of pure bliss
Fantasies interchanging with each kiss
Undying passion unites our souls
Together we swim until the point of no control

But, it's a fantasy, you won't come true
We never even spoke and your man swears he loves you
So, I'm gonna keep all these feelings aside, that's right
Keep my dreams alive until the right time

[Chorus]",Hey Lover [Radio Edit],1996
LL Cool J,"Greetings, earthlings
We have now taken over your radio

Goin' straight through the hole
You ain't got no game
I'm breakin' ya out the frame
Coming through like a train
Looking to take over the world is my goal
With my unstoppable crew takin' all control
You can't get none of this, we're runnin' this
Well taker, earth shaker, 3 point gunnin' this
Get out the lane, I'm comin' through
And if you don't want to move then I'm comin' right through you

It's like inch by inch and step by step
I'm closing in on your position and destruction is my mission
Though eight is not enough, your whole squad better duck
It's like switch when I bust
Now you're whole crew is dust
Comin' through my area, I'ma have to bury ya
The real scream team on your scream scene
It's like showdown on the range
Go tell me who want to tangle with the
Ghetto witch-doctor neighborhood superhero

We want it all (want it all)
Unstoppable, we run the floor (run the floor)
You can't take none of this hardcore (hardcore)
In the game we take you to war (war)
You ain't seen nothin' like this before
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low

Insane like a runaway train I'm in your lane
Like it's only 3 seconds to score to win the game
Came to bring the ultimate pain upon the brain
Untamed, you won't like it when I change
And you are type strange
Make room, manaical monster in the game
And I got my eye on you
Deadshot aim, as free throws keep comin' down like rain
You feelin' me, I'm feelin' you
The monstar again, I'm tellin' you
Pass me the rock, now I'm headed to the basket
Get up out my way is what you better do
My tactics is unsportsmanlike conduct
You better ask it
Don't get no better than this, you catch my drift
You get stripped by ballhandlers ruled by swackhammer
Danger, you're dealin' with official hoop-bangers
With hang time like a coat hanger
Jump, with thunderous 360-degree type dunks
What up doc the monstar funk

Lightning strikes and the court lights get dim
Supreme competition is about to begin
Above the rim, finessin' and moves is animated
Once I get to ballin', I can't be deflated
I'm rugged raw, my monstars is gettin' money
When clicks get to buggin', I'm snatchin' up their bunnies (uhh)
Every step I take shakes the ground
I'll make you break your ankles, son, shakes you down
This is my planet, I'm bout business
The best that ever done it, can I get a witness (uhhh)
Cumulus clouds bring darkness up above
You in it for the money
Or in it for the love, M.J.
Twenty- three ways to make a pay
Loungin' in the mothership back around my way (uhh)
I'm twenty-eight light years old
If the refs get political, dribble like bob dole
Am I gettin' lyrical
Daddy, I think so
Monstar droppin' flavor fluid so drink slow

We want it all (want it all)
Unstoppable, we run the floor (run the floor)
You can't take none of this hardcore (hardcore)
In the game we take you to war (war)
You ain't seen nothin' like this before
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low

Yo, god bless
Pick up your chest
Here's an example of how I can stress your full court press
With finesse, I bench-press your stress whenever you test
We're speed ballin', on the fastbreak just like the pony express
I'm gonna mingle in your face and take the lid off
Just use your head and forfeit the game
You and your team just need to back off
Get off my block, gimmie the ball, I said it's my rock
I'm startin' a line-up by gettin' why'all to bring the livestock
Throw all your money in the pot
And make sure you bet all your money on my bank shot
When we come right through tell me what you really gonna do
We'll leave your team name in shame and take your talent from you
While you abandon your ship, we take your championship
With nothing left for you to see except the instant replay clip
Money spending, goal tending, stay-bending teams like crash cars
Who do they be
They be the monsters

What are you talking about
Unstoppable, we run the floor (run the floor)
You can't take none of this hardcore (hardcore)
In the game we take you to war (war)
You ain't seen nothin' like this before
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high

Explosions, overpowerin'
Over the competition I'm towerin'
Wrecking shop when I write these lyrics
That'll make you call the cops
Don't you dare stare, you better move
Don't ever compare

That you know I've beef with
Why do you riff with me
The maniac psycho
And when I pull out my jammy get ready
Cause I might go Blaw!
How you like me now?
The ripper will not allow
You to get with Mr. Swift or Rift,
Listen to my gears shift
I'm blasting, I'm blasting
Kinda like shaft, so you can say I'm shafting

I'll devour
I'm gonna tie you up and let you understand
That I'm not your average man
When I gotta jammy in my hand
Damn!
Oh!
Listen to the way I slay

Destruction, terror, and mayhem
Pass me a sissy so sucker I'll slay him

I'm ready (we're ready)

Get down

Pull my lever

Should I surrender when you pursue me
You think a man don't have heart and soul
When a hand's that good, anybody will fold
It's like poetry in motion
But the heart regulates the devotion
Love is floatin' in a sky blue ocean
Think about it
Feel the motion, young queen
It reminds me of a smoothed out movie scene
Two bodies intertwined on the screen
Everybody makes love in their dreams
But this is real, know what I mean
Passion is the way of the world
Electricity when boy meets girl
And making love is the key
A burning flame that will last eternally

You should know that I'm here for you
As long as you see me through 
I would give all I have just to be with you
Don't you see honey it could be me and you

So there's no need for ya to have no fears

When she gets pumpin', it's hard to make the hotty stop
She likes to dance to the rap jam
She's sweet as brown sugar with candied yams
Honey-coated complexion
Music camay
Let's hear it for the girl
She's from around the way

I need that around the way girl (Around the way girl)
That's the one for me (She's the one)
I need that around the way girl 
Ya gotta shook up, shook down, shook up all your lovin'

Silky, bilky 
Your smiles' like sunshine
That's why I had to dedicate at least one rhyme
To all the cuties in the neighborhood
'Cause if I didn't tell you, then another brother would
You're sweet like sugar with your gangsta talk
Wanna eat you like a cookie when I see you walk
With your rayon, silk, or maybe even denim
It really doesn't matter as long as your in 'em
You can break hearts and manipulate minds
Or surrender, act tender
Be gentle and kind
You always know what to say and do
Go flip when you think your man is playing you
No cheap or petty
You're ready for loving
You're real independent, so your parents be buggin'
But if you ever need a place to stay
Come around my way

I need that around the way girl (Around the way girl)
That's the one for me (She's the only one)
I need that around the way girl 
Ya gotta shook up, shook down, shook up all your lovin'

Perm in your hair, or even a curly weave
With your New Edition/Bobby Brown button on your sleeve
I tell you come here
You say meet me half way
'Cause brothers been poppin' that yang all day
Around the way, you're like neighborhood jewel
All the homeboys sweat ya, so you're crazy cool
Wear your gold in the summer with your biking shorts
While your watchin' all the brothers on the basketball court
Goin' to the movies with your homegirl's crew
While the businessmen in suits be hawkin' you
Baby hair pumpin', lip gloss a-shinin'
I think you're in the mood for whinin' and dinin'
So we can go out and eat somewhere
We got a lot of private jokes to share
Lisa, Angela, Pamela, Renee
I love you, you're from around the way

I need that around the way girl (Around the way girl)
That's the one for me (She's all I ever need)
I need that around the way girl (Around the way girl)
Fine as can be (She's all I ever need)
I need that around the way girl (Around the way girl)
That's the one for me (She's the only one)
I need that around the way girl (Around the way girl)
Fine as can be

Ya gotta shook up, shook down, shook up all your lovin'
Ya gotta shook up, shook down, shook up 
Ya gotta shook up, shook down, shook up all your lovin'
Ya gotta shook up, shook down, shook up 
Ya gotta shook up, shook down, shook up all your lovin'
Ya gotta shook up, shook down, shook up
Ya gotta shook up, shook down, shook up all your lovin'
Ya gotta shook up, shook down, shook up
Ya gotta shook up, shook down, shook up all your lovin'",Around the Way Girl,1997

I need a beat, I need a beat (I need a beat, I need a beat)

If it's a Malibu beat, subject of discussion
Malibu beat, subject of discuss-cussion
You're motivated-vated, to aid a percussion-cussion
There's no category, for this story-story
It-it rock-rock in any territory-tory
I syncopate it and design it well-well
Beat elevates-vates, the scratch excels-cels
All techniques are a combination
Of skills that I have, thought narration

Last year my melody, but still complete
Providing musical energy for the street
Lyrics are smooth for maximum effect
Jump track patt-erns on cass-ette
Time-time snare had bass and cymbal
Like that of a cat on the mic I'm nimble
Ba-sic patterns, grouped and changed
Se-quence fre-quent, seek and gain

Break
Break, for narration

Break two, break two

I'm in the center of a, I'm in the center of a
Musical skinner, some say the skins is a blow of torture
They hear me, they fear me, they hear me, they fear me
I'm improving the conditions of the rap industry
The beat will expand, to land on foreign lands
Germany, Italy, France and Japan, it'll
Give you a lift, no need to sniff
No butts no how's no why's or if's
It's you I defeated, they'll say you retreated
Pick up your favorite magazine and read it
Wrapped by a power, a musical shower-shower
A picture-picture of me-of me on the Eiffel-Eiffel Tower-Tower
I need a beat-beat

Doing-doing dirty, I'm your-your thought
You're bein'-being taken-taken, the musical boom
I'm in full treating your eardrums
Increasing the rate of vibration
I wanna rock ya-rock ya, that's all you need to know-know
I need a beat, is the title of the show-show
Providing-providing pleasure on the musical measures
All-all arranged, to alleviate pressure
I'm up on your list, your party thera-therapist
Beat programmer and lyri-lyricist
Ladies love Cool J, studio user
A million or more screaming people abuser
I predict, this jam will hit
The highest plateau in the world of music
Paparazzi, wealth and fame
The total propulsion, of my name
I need a beat

Computer wise, and the engineer's eyes
Have to be very acute, education level high
The product is mine, beat on the rhyme
The control was part of the studio design
Track after track, culminating on wax
The tape has slack, rewind this back
Expensive but useful, the music is the fuel
A perfect place for MC's to duel

I need a beat, Farmer's Boulevard
Ha ha, Queens!
Ladies love Cool J!
Cut Creator!",I Need a Beat,1997
LL Cool J,"L.L. Cool J. is hard as hell
Battle anybody I don't care who you tell
I excel, they all fail
I'm gonna crack shells, Double-L must rock the bells

You've been waitin' and debatin' for oh so long
Just starvin' like Marvin for a Cool J. song
If you cried and thought I died, you definitely was wrong
It took a thought, plus I brought Cut Creator along
Evened up with E-Love down with the Cool J. force
Symbolizin' in the rhymin' for the record of course
I'm a tower full of power with rain and hail
Cut Creator scratch the record with his fingernail
Rock the bells

The king of crowd rockers finally is back
My voice is your choice as the hottest wax
True as a wizard, just a blizzard, I ain't taken no crap
I'm rhymin' and designin' with your girl in my lap
The bass is kickin' always stickin' cause you like it that way
You take a step because it's def and plus it's by Cool J.
Cut Creator on the fader, my right-hand man
We rock the bells so very well cause that's the name of this jam
Rock the bells

Some girl's will like this jam and some girls won't
Cause I make a lot of money and your boyfriend don't
L.L. went to hell, gonna rock the bells
All you washed up rappers want to do this well
Rock the bells

Now I'm world-wide known, whether you like it or not
My one man band is Cut Creator a.k.a. Philpot
He'll never skip it, only rip it when he's on the fader
What's my DJ's name, Cut Creator
Now you know the episode who's on the wheels
He'll drive the cross fader like a cut mobile
So precise with a slice that you know he's greater
What's my DJ's name, Cut Creator
Now you know, what do you know, Earl roles the weed
I go to the store and get Old Gold
So all you crabby lookin' nappy headed girls get back
Cause there's a ten to one chance that you might get smacked
Rock the bells

The bells are circulatin' the blood in your veins
Why are girlies on the tip, L.L.'s your name
Cut Creator's good, Cool J. is good-good
You bring the wood pecker, I'll bring the wood
The bells are wippin' and rippin' at your body and soul
Why do you like Cool J., we like rock and roll
Cause it ain't the glory days with Bruce Springsteen
I'm not a virgin so I know I'll make Madonna scream
You hated Michael and Prince all the way, ever sense
If their beats were made of meat, then they would have to be mince
Rock the bells

So listen to the lines of rhyme, I rhyme on time
He'll cut the record in a second, make your DJ look blind
So all you jerry-curl suckers wearin' high-heel boots
Like ballerinas, what I mean is you're a fruit-loop troop
All you gonna-be(s), want to-be(s), when will you learn
Want to be like Cool J., you gotta wait your turn
Some suckers don't like me, but I'm not concerned
Six-g (s) for twenty minutes is the pay I earn
I'm growin' and glowin' like a forest blaze
Do you like Michael Jackson, we like Cool J.
That's right, I'm on the mic with the help of the bells
There's no delayin' what I'm sayin' as I'm rockin' you well

(Why me, baby) What did I do, girl, what did I do
(Why, why me, baby)
You broke my heart

Check this out, honey
It seems like 99 years have gone by
Since the last time I talked to you, you know
I never realized that somethin` so innocent and so sweet
Could make a man feel so much pain
Times you`d jump out of my car and I`d chase you till I was out of breath
Go to your job and pick you up
But you never showed up that day
Where were you, baby
Who was you seein`, it`s a hurtin` feelin`, sugar
How could you, why would you abuse my love, sweetheart
Cursin` me out in front of my friends
And I could never do anything to you
'Cause there was no way I could hurt somethin` I treasured so much
Thought I was right on time, but it seems like I was too late
You hurt me, baby
But hey, I`m man enough to admit it
What I want to know is why

(Why, why me, baby) {Tell me why, baby, tell me why}
(Why, why me, baby) Tell me, baby
(Why, why me, baby) Tell me, baby
You broke my heart, baby {Check this out}
(Why)

Yo`, the way it happened was crazy
We had a argument
I didn`t see you for two or three days
And then when I go to the movies to get you off my mind
I see you sittin` there holdin` hands with the next man
Caught you on the phone a couple of times, but it was always your cousin
Step off, just a friend
People used to tell me, ¡°L, she was fakin`¡±
But I couldn`t see it, I was blinded by love
Nothin` was too expensive
No night was too rainy
I was always there for you
I did things few call me a fool for doin`
Droppin` your friends off, all that
All I wanted in return was your undivided attention and love
If my heart had eyes it would cry
You`re still in my world
Life is worth livin` love
Tell me why

(Why, why me, baby) Why would you do it to me, baby, yeah, yeah
(Why, why me, baby) You hurt me so bad when you left me, baby
(Why, why me, baby)
You broke my...heart, baby {Tell 'em what time it is, Keith}
(Why) {Tell 'em what time it is}

I walk around talkin` to myself
Do another day gets nothin`
Am I goin` crazy, baby
I look at the photograph that we once shared
And think about the moment, yeah, yeah
About each other
Remember the poems I used to say to you, girl

There`s a right and a wrong way to love somebody
I`ll always give all my love to you
I`m on a merry-go-round and round
Girl, how deep is your love
I`ve got to go outside in the rain
It`s nice to believe that we can last forever
Why, why, why, why me
No, baby, no, baby, no, baby, no, baby, no, baby
No, no, no, no, no
Somethin` natural
Ooh, do you know, do you know how much I love you
You were my woman and I was your man

If the signal was strong enough, and then I'll call your bluff
Like, ""Yo, how many rhymes you got?"" I think I'll go on
For more Milleniums than Mazda's got on the car lot
And there's nowhere to run ta, when I confront ya

Who want to see Canibus get wild, who want to act fly and
Get shot down with a surface-to-air missile

Zero to sixty? I'm already doin' a hundred
When I'm blunted and I give it to any nigga that want it

Stay out the dark, 'cause if I catch you when the sun is down
Run it clown, come up off that, or I'm gon' gun it down
When in doubt, however skull goes, it's gon' be that
See that, that shit'll finish you dog, believe that
Where we at, do your value your life, as much as your possessions?
Don't be a stupid nigga, learn a lesson
I'm gon' get you either way, and it's better to live
Let me get what's between your sock, 'cause it's, better to give
Than receive, believe what I say when I tell you
Don't make me put you somewhere where nobody'll smell you
And when the lights is out, they don't come back on
This ain't a flick you ain't gon' come back on, you ain't that strong

If it ever left my side it'd transform into a time bomb
You don't want to borrow that, you want to idolize
And you don't want to make me mad nigga, you want to socialize

To play yourself out position, and mention my name

LL Cool J,"When you was seventeen and I was nineteen
We feel deep in love growing up in Queens
We didn't know a thing about love
We was innocent sneakin' on the doorstep to hug
Held you tightly and promised you the world
You gave me hickeys and said you was my girl
When I think about it now makes me smile
Cause I ain't felt these butterflies in a while

Funny how you grow up and innocence fades
We used to live for love but now we're afraid (Of what?)
Of the darkness and bitter memories
Lovers who crushed us through infidelity
I promised you I'd love you to the end
Always and forever since way back when
You're like candy the world's sweetest friend
You taste better now than you did back then

[Chorus]
You will always be my candy
One day we will start a family
You will always be my candy girl
(You'll be my candy girl forever)
You will always be my candy
Want your love girl, understand me
You will always be my candy girl

While you sucked caramel apple lollipops
Rain sleet or snow I'm troopin' up the murdock
We used to walk down the block hold hands
I would get you after school 'cause I was your man
And any guys that want to socialize
Just know that I'm a flip on any cat that tries
My peeps used to say I was whipped
All your girls said since you got with him you flipped
But uh they couldn't feel the feelings we felt
Mirrors on the ceiling we melt
I would look up at ya I remember
The afternoon you surrendered
We made love the temperature was high as could be
You said ""Todd promise you ain't lyin' to me""
And as we went our separate ways you turned back
Smiled, I remember all that

[Chorus]

(Take it to the bridge)
Candy girl
You are my world
Look so sweet
You're a special treat
Candy girl
All I want to say
I need your love
Each and every day

When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind I hear my memories call
Of days when love was true I slept and held you
Taste the brown sugar, let your climax melt you
Candy you're occupying all of my thoughts
Turned my soul upside down with lessons you taught
I can feel you even when you're far away you're right here wit' me
Sweet love strictly
And I'm a bend over backwards to keep you on my side
Take you for a mental and emotional ride
Make love to your soul, your heart, and your mind
In your hour of need girl, I'll be there every time
And as long as you support my dreams
Stayin' right beside me as a part of my team
I'll take you where the average man can only dream of
Cause in a world so sour I got the sweetest love

[Chorus]

You are my world
Look so sweet
You're a special treat

LL Cool J,"It's been a long time
People change
I missed you
Word up
I used to always think about you
Even though sometimes I see you
And I try to ignore you
Deep inside I was thinkin' about you
What do you think

You are my life
I have to go on
Havin' me any way you want me baby
Just love me til the tension's gone
And don't you come too soon

I'm patient I never come too soon
When I kissed you you said it was the same old tune
But I missed you my life was filled with gloom
I was hopeless sittin' in an empty room
When you re-appeared I was back in the mix
I put the key up in the lock cause true love fixed
All the drama got to stop baby no more tricks
My broken heart was addicted but now it's fixed
And I cherish you forever believe me you
You's a priceless treasure from my point of view
It took time to change I'll admit that
My back in the days love I had to get back

[Chorus]
You are my star ship
Come take me up tonight
And don't be late 
You are my star ship
Come take me up tonight
And don't be late
And don't you come too soon
(never that)

I never thought that I would ever lay beside you again
Tastin' every inch plus being your friend
Romantic nights with shootin' stars and full moons
Kiss the rose better til it come full bloom
Can you feel it passions overflows in waves
Keep it steady providin' everything you crave
Now you ready I like that my love you save
I love it when a bad girl agrees to behave
It's the motion that makes your love affair complete
But devotion makes it all twice as sweet
Back together reunited bonded once more
Before I was hesitant but now I'm sure

[Chorus: x2]

Well now you know how I feel
And I definitely know how you feel

I'm feelin' this
Word up

LL Cool J,"I swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth,
So help me GOD
I just felt like telling the story of my life
Felt like, maybe somebody could be inspired, you know?
We all feel pain, we all go through things
But it's time to overcome all that

If your plane crashed in the water and everybody died
Would you drown on purpose or try to survive?
I was born handicapped my arm wouldn't move
They called me a cripple pops caught an attitude
Beat my moms smoked lye drove trucks
My moms had a miscarriage, he didn't give a fuck
He sniffed some coke, come home
Beat up on my moms cause she's talkin' on the phone
Come on

Packed up her bags we bounced out the do'
She said, ""I ain't taking these whippin's no mo'
I want to live to see my little Todd grow""
I remember tear drops on my pops face
Looking down at me standing on the staircase
Handsome brother with a smooth goatee
Makes me wonder why he act so ugly, you feeling me?
(I'm feeling you)

[Chorus]

My pops got drunk when me and my moms bounced
Swigged some Jack Dan', sniffed up a ounce
Grabbed the shotty left Long Isle for Queens
Possessed by a demon, a devil it seemed
I was too young to understand the risk
When your moms come home off the midnight shift
She turned around heard the shotgun click
My pops said, ""You think that you could leave me?""
He blasted my moms in the back
She fell down screaming I can't forget that
My grandfather tried to close the do'
He got shot ten times in the stomach yo, for real

[Chorus]

My head was spinning, I had never seen blood
Four years old, this don't feel like love
Anyway, pops disappeared
Grandpops and moms healed up over the years
This therapist got up in her head
Led her to believe without him she'd be dead
You know, they fell in love with one another
Everything seemed right that's word to mother
Until I started getting beatings everyday
Sometimes for going outside to play
Late at night on my knees I'd pray
A young child, wishing the pain would go away
Dad where was you when he made me strip
Beat with belts like a slave with a whip
Kicked me down steps outside in the snow
Punched me in the chest stomped me out on the flo'
That's just the tip of the iceberg look
It's too long for a song but perfect for a book
Word is bond, that's real baby

[Chorus]",Father,1997
LL Cool J,"I was swerving through Queens
Fully growin' Benz
Searching for the butta through my Cartier lens system
Banging out nothing but the blends on the digital startec
Rappin' to my mens
Then spotted the most exotic, cheekiness, half Rachel, half Holly
My fav' is
The smo' mo, crept up nice and slow
Breathin' on my ice, so it shine real nice
Crease my scar piece
Laid back in my seat
Right near Bazely projects, on the back streets
Her name was Keisha, full of street knowledge
Pumped a little trees, but she planned to go to college
Staring at my ice, smellin' my cologne
She lived on the South side, so bring things on
Honey got flavor, and it just don't stop
Does she want me for me, or me for my rocks

[Chorus]
Your car make me hot, hot, hot
You just make me just hot, hot, hot
I like your rocks, rocks, rocks
They make me hot hot hot
Baby boy don't stop stop stop
You keep me hot hot hot
I'm a take you for all you've got
Baby girl just stop stop stop
Check this out, uh

She slid up my whip, like the queen of New York
We jetted to city island to eat shrimp and talk
Sourced up my keys to the valet cat
I glanced at the fatty, I'm a see about that
We blazed in the spizza like Bonnie and Clyde
Scooby dooby hizza
I'm feeling the vibe, cop the blue for some video type shit
Knowing all along how hot these kind of nights get, uh
I've got her right where I want her
Reality about to creep up on her
Stroke her softly, gently with my G
While the light reflects off my ice p
Waiter, ice the Crystal, let it simmer
Lights too bright, here's a grand, make them dimmer
I kept fronting and I just couldn't stop
I don't mind spending paper when it's looking that hot

[Chorus]

You burst out of semi-top
She pulled down the straps to her dress
Reached in the back sparked up sess
Banging some Wu Tang feeling the bass
She said ""Now would you want to sell your soul for chips,
And give up girl to push whips?""
Never miss some, spiritual down to my bone
Why you takin' jumbo in that zone
She said ""I would do anything for money
Give deep pockets to my man's coats
Take off my sleeves
Drop to my knees""
Talking in my face
Breath smelling like cheese
I asked her
Shorty you degrade yourself
Just to throw a little bit of ice on the shelf
You turning me off, I can't lie
Keisha said ""Why?""
I said, ""Yo, how can a man respect that, knowin' if he paid, 
Then he correct that""
Ice is the price for an overnight wife
A true shark caller don't want that in his life
So all you ladies that are selling your souls
You need to put you hooker vibes on hold
Ask for Keisha, she working on the stroll, 
Dead ass broke, but her pimp the man grow

By age 19 Tyheim is turned out
He ain't talking much, keep a dutch in his mouth
Cop the aberrettes
Orange and Blue
Laced the Gore-tex, stepped with his crew
Black superstar, Jesus piece
Who he prayin' to? God or the Beast
Some bust blocks, feared on the block
Traded in the trucks for a silver drop top
Drug money flowin'
Jealousy is growin'
Paranoia got him second guessin'
D-T's on his back got him stressin'
He was at the light blazin' up traum
Around the corner came a tinted out Yukon
Ten slugs in the door made him fall
Guess he should of never hustled at all

Even when he hustled he kept them in his spot
He liked to fuck a lot and make the rubber pop

Chickens showin' love
Cash bubblin' from pimpin' and drugs
He a real pretty cat
He get from his moms
Back in the seventies, she was the bomb
His games top notch, and he don't stop
He hit a reverends daughter in a church parkin' lot
Tay-Kwan is sick, heartless with chicks
He liked to beat 'em up, make 'em suck dick

Not only did he walk away with the HIV
Her man's jealous, jooked him rediculously

Credit cards in ATM machines
Used to make coats, holdin' work got arrest

She a vet, yet she look innocent and sweet
When she wet, ain't no controllin' the heat
For baguettes she give love to ill thugs
Age of 15 she learned to pump drugs
Then she got pregnant, abandoned the kid
Met this drug kid, set him up and slid
Now she 23 full blown in the mix
Sizin' up wits than more cliques is gettin' chips
She down for whatever, as long as it pays
She tipped off the kids and got Tyheim blazed
She was in the same Yukon, laughin' with the thug
He said thanks for settin' Tyheim up
Take a slug

Shorties'll swarm, make me wanna bust shots (BO!)
We speak, daily on the regular
Run your jibs all day chip in my cellular
Shoot down to Jamaica, pretty white sand
Suntan oil, pina colada in you hand
Layin up at night, peepin out stars
Remember - when we was at the club at the bar?
I told ya, my status, was that of a don
You thought I was a dog and you ain't wanna get it on
But my mind has attractin qualities
on the emotions of a young lady (word up)
So here you are, smack dab up in the mix (uh-huh)
Shorty this here's about as good as it gets
Word up, I'ma treat you like a queen from the heart
Crack the bubbly, and let the episode start

Blow your socks off make sure your G spots soft

I'm gonna call you Big Daddy and scream your name

Neva knowin that his woman is in need of love
You got Versace gold link stomach chains wit rocks
Official hair style but you stuck up in the spot
Makin love, Duke is weak then he fallin asleep
You on the phone wit your old peeps dyin to creep 'tween my sheets
So what you got Chanel on your feet
Hot sex on a platter makes the mission complete, uh

Soon as he turn the corner I'ma turn that ass out
Full blown, frontin in the 6 wit the chrome
Yo B, why you leave your honey all alone wit me
Just because you blessed wit cash
doesn't mean your honey won't let me finesse that ass
So see the moral of the story is a woman need love
The kind you so-called players never dreamed of
You gotta try love, can't buy love
If you play your hand then it's bye-bye love

Who do you love (I wanna lounge wit you)

So what you got the cash flow and escro, damn
But your honey ran away like presto, ala-kazam
Man made the money, money never made the man
You still fakin jacks throwin rocks on her hand
See, you put your mack down now you Nino Brown
Rock roller wit' so much ice your cap's polar
I got em smokin beanies, modelin bikinis
Pushin ya whip on the freeway to see me
I keep it steamy, I make it burn when it's my turn
Teachin shorty all the tools that you neva learned
Don't get it twisted, gettin money ain't wrong
But she wanna make love all night long, I'm gone

We feel deep in love growin' up in Queens 
We didn't know a thing about love 
We was innocent, sneakin' on the doorstep to hug 
Held you tightly and promised you the world 
You gave me hickeys and said you was my girl 
When I think about it now it makes me smile 
'Cause I ain't felt these butterflies in a while 
Funny how you grow up and innocence fades 
We used to live for love but now we're afraid 
{Of what?} 
Of the darkness and bitter memories 
Lovers who crushed us through infidelity 
I promised you I'll love you to the end 
Always and forever, since way back when, uh 
You're like candy,

You taste better now than you did back then

I would get you after school 'cause I was your man 
And, any guys that want to socialize 
Just know that I'mma flip on any cat that tries 
My peeps used to say I was whipped 
All your girls said, ¡°Since you got with him you flipped¡± 
But, uh, they couldn't feel the feelings we felt 
Mirrors on the ceiling we melt 
I would look up at ya 
I remember the afternoon you surrendered 
We made love, 
Your temperature was high as could be 
You said, ¡°Todd, promise you ain't lyin' to me¡± 
And as we went our separate ways you turned back 
Smiled, I remember all that

I need your love 
Each and every day 

When I'm alone in my room, 
Sometimes I stare at the wall 
And in the back of my mind, 
I hear my memories call 
For days when love was true, 
I slept and held you 
Taste the brown sugar, 
Let your climax melt you 
Candy, 
You're occupyin' all of my thoughts 
Turned my soul upside down with lessons you taught 
I could feel you 
Even when you're far away you're right here wit' me 
Sweet love strictly 
And I'mma bend over backwards to keep you on my side 
Take you for a mental and emotional ride 
Make love to your soul, 
Your heart, and your mind 
In your hour of need, girl, 
I'll be there every time 
And as long as you support my dreams 
Stayin' right beside me as a part of my team 
I'mma take you where the average man can only dream of 
'Cause in a world so sour I got the sweetest love 

You will always be my candy

You will always be my candy girl

I battle you and then me and meth exchange shifts
For money, to your house arrest anklet
I take it all, if not, here's a thousand
Bricks, be shooting fair ones with bail bonds men
I'm constant, on that paper chase
Blow zip codes from bricks to 8-1-8
Doc serve til you lickin' the plate
Battle royal, in the ring smoking like doc out of oil
Fire thrown to the roof of you apartment
Hit 95 then I hide with the waltons
Down south, the forty-four feela
I'm a dolo nigga, you a polo nigga
I'm an uptown shopper, you a soho nigga
Westside highway running, homo nigga

I'm the sultan of the ghetto
The homicidal aficionado
I empty niggas out like cristal bottles, uh
When I battle, I'm breaking bentleys down to gravel
I got the heat right here, we ain't got to travel
I'm bigger than producers, I figured out you losers
I knew my longevity confuse ya
Big paper game, come on run into these flames
Recognize the power of the royal king james
Phantom menace, that's why niggas make faces like they drinking guinness
When they realize I'm not finished
I've been paid, I've been platinum, been spittin', uh
Been eatin', been ballin' and you know I'm shittin'
Platinum links, chinky-eyed blonde haired honeys sippin' rainbow colored drinks
Black thugs with white minks, ready to jack the brink
Bend your little wifee over help her stretch out the kinks
That's why ya niggas freeze when I step up in the building
The godfather's here giving blessings to his children
Carats shine, the world all mine
Can't believe these cats is poppin' shit about papers in their rhymes
Or bodies they collect, black gotti shot a tech
Them gangsta visions will have you ass up in an ambulance
Cats ain't live, look up in my eyes
We can do this one more time, I'll let you decide
The alize swigger, I clock twelve figgas
Think giuliani's rough I got some real shit for niggas
Never been defeated, niggas retreated
Made the choice to be seated until my mission's completed
Get loose, get loose, method man get loose
What the world gonna do when my dogs get loose?
(blaze one) blaze one (blaze one) blaze one
Blaze, blaze, blaze one

Now four corners, four seasons
Four mc's with four reasons to bring this game to its knees
And why you down there, suck my dick
My whole motto is fuck it
Hit the smoke shop and blow my budget
Mc's abusing my bitch, using my shit
I'm hanging off the roof with one hand, losing my grip
Now y'all don't wanna see me do that, now do you?
Go straight cuckoo and terrorize rap, do you?
I do my best work stressed out and under pressure
Deep inside the mind is where you'll find my buried treasure
I'm still wild, still tical
Still gritty style, foul, crimi-niminal, individual
Sing a song of sixpence
Pocket full of chits
Too many rappers be on john gotti's dick
Now this is something that we don't rehearse
Put that rap shit second, and hip-hop first

Easy, ain't nann niggas spitting like me
Nor murderers motherfuckin' inc
Niggas will pass me, look me in the face, ask me
Are y'all really holdin' weight or did somebody gas me?
Ja be the myth, reggie hand me the fifth let me explain
Your lil' man made me give him a lift
So you ridin' with gangstas
I'm up to a whole lot of other shit
Murderers is the clique, niggas can't deal with
Try it (hataz) you gonna get yours to the heart
Lesson tonight by the four-four
Niggas want more than a little bit, hot shit
L.l. an red
Ja rule with hot nix I'm the best at that shit
So bitches explain this

How you countin' your paper kid, without a GED? 
Slow down, let me do my thing now, hold up 
Maybe that's the reason you stressed, quick to roll up

Makin niggas hit high notes  like the Eisley's 
Finally  some bitches I can touch up 
Tie em to the grill of my Six  pop the clutch up 
Hush up  I rush up, inside your cut 
Make you puss up, then bust up, cause my shit bumps 
This Don's Trumps, kill straight cats and all chumps 
Cause ""Life is like a box of chocolate,"" Mr. Gump 
Uh, the ultimatum, lets abbreviate em 
LL platinum again, don't you hate 'I'm? 
A thin line between darkness and sunshine 
Five Percenters that was raised on swine 
Known to be wise, and you wise to understand 
Bringin me drama is a handstand in quicksand 
I've been hot so long, I'm immune 
Your rap career get cut short like Poom-Pooms 

[Chorus] 
Now, from the streets to the suites and all around the world, 
They all recognize we (Incredible) 
We can stand in the water and can't get wet, 
You can bet your last dollar we (Incredible) 
We gets it on in the worst way 
All the homeboys and the girls say we (Incredible) 
From one brother to another 
They agree with each other, lyrically we both (Incredible) 

Adios, mios, Montageune 
We're too hot to hold and too bold to be controlled 
Your only skin-deep, my ugly comes from the soul 
I find the leaks, and E plug the holes 
I have more beef than filet mignon 
But got smart, and flushed the bullshit down the ?como? 
Rappers just started rappin last week, get a deal next week 
And go platinum next month 
But pass the blunt, so I can stay hy- like -dro 
Don't act like you don't know, I'm about to fly a flow 
I'm three from three from a three-point land 
With more devastation than a nigga can withstand 
Remember me? Untouched by any emcee 
I add verbal assault to your mental injury 
Cause I'm the vogit, toat it, quote it 
Five-0 said freeze, man I blowed it 
Ryhme strategies, no one's bad as this 
I sew up the populace like a seamstress 
A prisoner, doing time and the bit 
A grown man, and don't play with no kids; I'm incredible! 

[Chorus]

Lyrically we are both (Incredible)",Incredible,1999
LL Cool J,"Slow down baby

Cause you can get rugged, tough, hard like P
Tried to play my man but you couldn't touch me
You faggot, no comp' rapper on a quest
To get your head flown boy, you must be loc' on sess
Cause many often wonder is M.D. paid
You're God damn right punk, stay outta my way
Cause I clock G's while you clock Z's
And I don't smoke crack, I smoke MC's
So pick up a pen, cop a squat, and take note
A rapper suffered from bleedin, sprains and slit throats
Cause my style, deadly psychopath schizophrenic
A rapper choke like a carburetor, freeze up and panic
Cause I clock pesos, don't sell llello
'Nother word for cocaine mi amigo
That's Spanish, terminology for friend
Now sit back and ride my bozack as I send
Bass funk, with beats that thump
For speakers and amps, cold lined up in my trunk
My system's crankin my headlights are blinkin
Brothers ridin my tip L, at the same time thinkin DAMN
How could a brother be so nice?
Cause I'm the capital, P-E twice, M-D-E twice
I choose to squeeze, some choose to fight
I like to write but then again some bite
And while you was bangin on tables;
I was bangin Snow White P!

Slow down baby

The Ripper, the master, the overlordian'
Playing MC's like a old accordion
I get the inspiration from unnecessary station
Them sayin I was vacationin'
You can't quote with your weaker throat
Tryin to sneak a peek at how I freak the notes
Major MC's become minor B-flats
So retire the mic, get your chains and your bats
Here's your chance to advance, get in your stance
I shoot the holster off your cowboy pants
Pure entertainment, tonight's your arraignment
You're guilty - face down on the pavement!
No holds barred, it's time to get scarred
You and your squad better praise the real God
The undertaker, droppin' thunder on fakers
When it comes to lyrics I'm as freaky as Seka
So lay the mic down slow and careful
Cause mine is fully loaded and I got another handful
A clip to slip in and start rippin'
Divin' and dippin' and givin punks a whippin' (aww shit)
Just in case you wanna go a few rounds or so
I'm down so that you clowns'll know
Me gettin burnt or hurt won't be tolerated
I got rhymes up the huh forget it I'm constipated L!

Slow down baby

When I come around homeboy, watch your nugget
A master on the beatdown, my style's rugged
When I attack the microphone, close the zone
Rap sees danger, can't roam
Security's packed and wall to wall can't fall
A rap tank is full so I can't stall
My microphone is filled with premium
Any whack MC that flexes, I'm creamin' him
Not with lotion, bust the motion
Flotation when I rock on the mic, I'm like coastin'
I'm unique, fatigued at my peak you still seek
A style cause yours extra weak
New method, to rip the stage at my age
And get loose and kick, like Bruce in a rage
I'm on a rampage

Slow down baby",Rampage,1999

I was swerving thru Queens
Fully growin' benz
Searching for the butta thru my cartier lense system
Banging out nothing but the blends on the digital startec
Rappin' to my mens
Then spotted the most exotic, cheekiness, half Rachel, half Holly
My shit is
The slo mo, crept up nice and slow
Breathin' on my ice, so it shine real nice
Crease my scar peice
Laid back in my seat
Right near Bazely projects, on the back streets
Her name was Keisha, full of street knowledge
Pumped a little trees, but she planned to go to college
Staring at my ice, smellin' my cologne
She lived on the southside, so bring things on
Honey got flavour, and it just don't stop
Does she want me for me, or me for my rocks

We jetted to city island to eat shrimp and talk
Sourced up my keys to the valet cat
I glanced at the fatty, I'm a see about that
We blazed in the spizza like Bonnie and Clyde
Scooby dooby hizza
I'm feeling the vibe, cop the blue for some video type shit
Knowing all along how hot these kind of nights get, uh
I've got her right where I want her
Reality about to creep up on her
Stroke her softly, gently with my G
While the light reflects off my icp
Waiter, ice the crystal, let it simmer
Lights to bright, here's a grand make them dimmer
I kept fronting and I just couldn't stop

You burst out of semi-???
She pulled down the staps to her dress
Reached in the ? sparked up sess
Banging some Wu Tang feeling the ??
She said ""Now would you wanna sell your soul for chips,
and give up girl to push whips?""
Never miss some spiritual down to my bone
Why you takin' jumbo in that zone
She said ""I would do anthing for ?????
Give deep ? to ? man coats
Take off my ??
Drop to my knees""
Talking in my face
Breath smelling like cheese
I asked her
Shorty you degrade yourself
Just to throw a little bit of ice on the shelf
You turnin' me off, I can't lie
Keisha said ""why?""
I said, ""yo, how can a man respect that, knowin' if he paid, 
then he correct that""
Ice is the price for an overnight wife
A true shark caller don't want that in his life

I'm on a mission ain't no stress love

So what I scratch my nuts, how the fuck is that wrong

S-curl hating, Jamaican rum sipping

They rocking cuffs and, put the eight up, repercussion
You know my name, so there's no need for introduction 
I'm Mr. Done it all, so none of why y'all can do me nothing

Stick niggas for not knowing, then teach 'em something 
Bitch niggas talking bout you from the streets you fronting 
I never liked you, and you, I don't know 
So what the fuck you think is 'sposed to happen, we goin' go 
Mano a mano, whatever nigga, I'm goin' dust you 
If you can't pick that afro, I'm goin' bust you 
Walking like you was a lil nigga 'cause you is 
And don't forget that daddy's gonna always love his kids 
Cracking niggas got the nerve to wonder why I rob, why 
You guys will live while everybody else'll starve 
That pretty shit is played, fuck what your name hold 
Break a nigga off something, watch a nigga gain fo' 
Now you laying somewhere cold, stiff as shit 
And all that riffing shit, men's will get you hit, bitch

Right here baby

Look in the mirror while I tell you a tale
About a mogul named Uncle L
Sit on eight figures, man with a vision, move with precision
(He excels, they all fail)
Undisputed, the game got so polluted
That he turned his 'Radio' off
He 'Needed A Beat' so he could 'Jingle' them bells again
Watchin' the plasma TV in the loft (with somethin' soft)
With a leopard print outfit on
Cause he known to flood any mic he spit on
He's a (uh uh, 'Phenomenon')
Ice glistenin', listenin' to 'break of dawn'
He went from, 'Hollis to Hollywood' in fact
Owned the Dow Jones and stacked the NASDAQ
Conference call with his broker, 'What's the yield on that?'
""Exotic Motorcars,"" we want a deal on that

What's this image that I see before me (you know baby)
It's a winner (you go baby) please believe it (you go baby)
I can see it so I can achieve it (you flow baby, you go baby)

'Around the way girls be doin' it well'
They love the way that man look on the (XXL)
On the Money magazine covers
When he stop at the light, it's like his Benz hovers
Smoke blowin' from the chrome exhaust, of his Boxer Porsche
(Look at him, lickin' his lips when his joint pull off)
Ever since 'Boomin' System', damn she missed him
She, couldn't resist him, dreamt she kissed him
In a, warm jacuzzi full of 'Milky Cereal'
She said (I need love from the grand imperial)
I been his biggest fan since five years old
And now I'm twenty two, I love money (ooh)
'Backseat of the Jeep', you need that
(Who do you love?) Baby repeat that
(Who do you love?) You need to keep back
Milk and 'Pink Cookies' he known to eat that

Tryin' to get as much money as possible, no negative consequences
Knahmsayin baby? I'm goin' long, feel me

'Hey Lover', I'm 'Loungin'
'goin' Back to Cali', cop a crib on the mountain
Strobe lights jumpin' off, birdies is bouncin'
'(Four)-to-the-Three-Two-One', he stopped countin'
Eliminated competition quickly
Phantom of the Opera on the low where your clique be
He feel his flow deep down in your artery
Peep her man's checkbook (uh) that's where his heart'll be
'6 Minutes of Pleasure' for 'Jack the Ripper'
Young players fall quicker from chicks and hard liquor (ahahah)
But uh, he's 'Bad', he got 'The Power of God'
In the Four Seasons, laughin' at the L'urmitage?
He been there, mini-bars, RandB stars
Young groupies in the lobby on the search for (Bobby)
Young tycoon in the Steve Wynn suite

I'ma practice both verses, after this, I want you to find a spot
That's close to when the beat drops to the rewind point, locate point
You ain't gotta be on that all night, this the soundtrack
Yo, Yea, Check it
OK, alright, huh OK

The other night I was up at Farmers, politician wit some bloods
They told me ""yo L, in the streets you ain't getting no Love
And Ever since the X's and the Jiggas came out
My niggas ain't trying to the hear that smooth shit you talk about
What's Up wit that cat Canibus, some played you out
Why you didn't answer back correctly, fuck was that about?""
As I sip on some henny, and try to explain some things
About the life of a legend, and all the Drama it brings
Been gone a long time, had a lot of shit on my mind
I decided I don't want to reach my goal if it means losing my shine
Streets is Hip-hop and I'm Hip-Hop, so the streets is Mine
Ballin' as long as you been livin', that's a long time
Hard to Stay hungry when your pockets are so fat
You hit a hot one in every city on the map
And niggas keep sleepin' and you keep coming back
You know better than the gat, but niggas still want to clap

It feels so good to be back Where I Belong
The Streets is Where I Belong
They Had me locked down much too long
Hey Hey

Some Say ""L that's cool, but see times have changed""
Niggas got red bandannas, and the grill in the range
That gold shit is dead, niggas rock platinum chains
Trade O.E. for Henny, Colt 45 for champagne
Hustling niggas found they way into the game
Extorting all these so called ballers wit big names
And you gotta have a squad, 'cause running from Def ain't safe
I know you living good, but ain't no smile up on our face
I'm like a villain, I'm representing on my lyrics
And force feed the world, even if they don't want to hear it
As far as Canibus go, my man is hittin' his ex-broad
I'm getting head from his new piece
While 20 gang-bangers applaud, you came up with that bullshit
Some heads sucked it up, then you dropped that garbage album
And Totally fucked it up, I coulda told ya I knew your moms
From the after-hours spot, when I used to be up in Canada
With the dreads on a black block, before you dick rode Lost Boyz
For a ticket our to Jersey, but being the man I am
I tried to show ya mercy, I could of told the World
The way ya label hates your guts
And how me and Wyclef, got together to set you up
And how he gave me half your budget, don't believe me look it up
Ya A&R promotion niggas, they helped me hook it up
I hate to be responsible, for destroying your career
A one-hit wonder, huh
No Wonder you disappeared, I could of told the world
You get your lyrics from the internet
Then spit 'em word for word
Like you really a rap vet, How you take metaphors from books
And put 'em in your rhyme, and how you really from Canada
And you been frontin' all this time
I heard your second album, that shit is garbage too
LL Cool J and I did this to you
On that note he said
""Yo L, you the man"", I said peace, one love
And Drove off in the Lex Land

[Chorus: x2]

Yea nigga, the jig is up nigga, huh ha
You know what I'm saying?, all that bullshit you was talking
Don't mean shit, you finish now
I'm still the man nigga 
The vanguard award is in my motherfucking living room
You know what I mean? come get that shit, fuck, what
MIC still on my arm nigga, word up
Both arms, I'ma get another one nigga
You Know what I'm saying, this LL you know how I get down
You should of known, when you did it
He probably did it to get some fame
But is this really what you want?",Back Where I Belong,2000
LL Cool J,"You ever get to the point where you so frustrated
You ready to give up?
You ready to end it all?
Don't do it dog, word up
I don't care if you black, white, Latin, Asian, whatever
We all go through pain
When you can't think, use your soul baby

Preliminary discussions is over with, the verdict is in
I took the rap throne back
I reigned like krills in eighty-seven, my name is on the map
It feels like a razor down the middle of my back
They slept on my lyrical ability to blow
Gave another nigga credit for inventing my flow
I'm a child of God, witness the rising son
From the cradle to the grave, I remain number one
This thing of ours, got competition taking red showers
Grieving mothers calling 1-800-Flowers
My repertoire burn your ashes in the urn
Is it God or money that really make the world turn?
Grab your gun, separate the ones from the real funds
Inhale deep and hold it in your lungs
The streets was requesting some original LL
A soundtrack for niggas that was raised in {hell}
They looking for a leader that can guide 'em through the maze
Smoke filled rooms, breathing in purple haze
Po' nigga's on the bricks his whole life
He ain't got nothing to live for, so fucking living right
But if you stay in the rain like hurricane
Gold melts down but it don't fear flames
Toxic, lethal, psychologically evil
Genocide was committed on the black people
And the ghetto is a trap with glass walls
Should I sell drugs, be a rap thug, or play ball?
We end up in the grave anyway
The average cat and LL Cool J
It's a never ending cycle, life and death
Until then may my mic stay blessed, to the death

[Chorus]
I can't think! Why do I feel I'm losin my mind?
I can't think! Could it be the ill beats and rhymes?
I can't think! Even though I'm a one of a kind
I can't think! I want the paper, that's just the bottom line
I can't think! Mo' murder every day around the way
I can't think! I'd rather get paid and parlay
I can't think! It's all about survival God
(You know the epilogue by James Todd)

Put your life on the line, you running out of time
The coroner's calling, she know she on a nigga mind
Amongst the dogs, real cats is hard to find
Even a nigga moms hate it when he start to shine
Get the money and run, dodge the devil and his sons
Spit powerful parables like a sermon has begun
Fuck the turntables up, leave the DJ awestruck
Attitude is what, keep the razor blade tucked
Too much flossin'll get your reputation touched
Too much rappin'll get your big mouth shut
Protect your neck nigga, you'll get it in the gut
You wearing a vest? What if you get your throat cut
Sold your soul for a dollar, now you having bad luck
Used to keep a bad bitch in the crib bagging up
Player here, player there, nigga turned you out
But never told you beware
Never told you that black love supposed to be shared
And you never judge a woman by the texture of her hair
Fancy cars and gold teeth, G-strings and things
The almighty dollar replace the wedding ring
The Ark of the Covenant was held by a king
I ain't trading my soul in for skins and chrome rims

[Chorus]

Think about it yo, think about it
Think about it yo, think about it
Think about it yo, think about it
Think about it yo, think about it
The dawn, of a new millennium, came to pass
The world revolves around sex or cash
The black man's motto, ""Kiss my ass!""
Shorties in kindergarten are strapped, ready to blast
All I ever seen was killers and dope fiends
From FEDS Magazine to the heart of killer Queens
Bronx and Brooklyn and everything up in between
No matter what, you always got a Judas on your team
Giving it to the world and I'm telling it like it is
Tossing lyrical daggers and sending em in your wig
Know where the body's buried, I ain't saying where it is
Raised inside the ghetto, but dammit I wanna live!
The legendary master of lyrical combat
But ain't no competition, ain't nobody to go at
So I'ma take the time and spit a universal verse
Hit the streets with a blessing and erase the curse

When the shit goes down why'all ain't got nothing to say

He kicked the old lady's door in, threw her on the floor
Choked her to death so she don't scream no more
He need some white chocolate, he feel it in his bones
He heard she refinanced and got a bank loan
He used to mow the lawn, take the garbage out
Now she in the closet wit a sock in her mouth
Copped a chain, copped some crills
Crack pipe in his windpipe, twisting like a drill
Run around fronting, buying his men's kicks
Gassed a broad up so she can help her rent a whip
The other killer peeped him out flashing a knot
A well known murderer, check the ill plot
Call up Corey Buns, get him on the block
Niggas gotta eat, plus he front a lot
He came through, straight strip search
He said I'm coming back, and I'ma put in work
Niggas told him, hey yo, leave that shit alone
But pride mixed with crack, had him in a zone
Prepared for more shit than Depends
Eyes bloodshot through a Cardier lens
Niggas said Buns came through looking strange
Yeah, Buns won't stay in his lane
Aight, Buns want ghetto fame
And caught two in the Ukraine at point blank range

Used to smuggle burners up from Texas
Had the ill crib out in Rosedale
Took the money from the trunk and copped a fish scale
Chinese Jamaican, real pretty nigga
Love puffin blunts, throwing bodies in the river
One of the illest niggas that the world ever saw
Used to take loaded nines and throw 'em on the floor
He was from Brooklyn, and I don't know the block
I met him at the flicks he commented on my rocks
We rolled back to back, while I was slinging raps
He was slinging crack, I was seventeen fascinated by the stacks
Running with dangerous niggas and packing gats
Uh, the shit thrill me, looking so clean, and living so filthy
I heard his right hand man disappeared
They found his bike in the street somewhere
Conspiracy theories, niggas talking shit
Small world, I was close to his right hand man's chick
She kept beeping him he never called back
When they found him in the trunk his body was jet black
Pretty Jamaican kept doing his thing
Him and his older brother got caught up in a sting
Out on bail, pressure by the feds, he caught seven in the head

In the ghetto black men are dying at alarming rates
Walking the street is like entering a sweepstakes
You never know if you goin' win or lose
We walk around feeling confused and totally abused
Can't front, I'ma millionaire living like a king
Still feigning for that shrimp, fried rice and chicken wings
Still feigning for the vibe, only the ghetto bring
Pumping songs of pain only real niggas sing
Queens finest, but there's one minus
The bodies on the battlefield that got left behind us
I'm sick and tired of going to wakes
'cause niggas never look the same in the casket
It's bugged out, they skin look like plastic
I shed tears, but use shades to mask it

When it was classified a drug related homicide
It's like until the killer hit the suburbs

LL Cool J,"I just want you to fantasize with imagination
Know what I'm saying, uh yeah, yeah
Uh, yeah I like that
Give me some more, some more of my vocals
You know sex 'em up a little bit
You know what I mean?

You're the honey that I see when I'm riding by
The one giving me a feeling that I can't deny
You got the Prada boots on suede hitting your thigh
Acting like my chrome twenties ain't catching your eye
Sometimes I slow down catch the ass in the mirror
Turn the fog lights on to see the legs more clearer
You're turning me on, keep me standing up
I wish that I could prove to you that I'm man enough
I come up to your job and handcuff your boss
Throw that nigga in the closet and turn the lights off
Then sit you up on the copy machine
Make copies of your kitten with my chin in between
Then I'll take you to the window so the world can see
Baby I'm down on my knees let your world be free
Pearl tongue, come get up on this desk with me
Multiple orgasms is your destiny
Wet dream, ride like you're going to Queens
Like I just gave you fifty thou and ya just turned 18
To hell with your boss
Let that nigga hear you scream
Sounding like that screech on the fax machine
Then we can take it to the ladies bathroom
Make your mascara run till you look like a raccoon
Touch yourself baby tell me it's wet
Squeeze tight so I'll never forget, here we go

[Chorus]
I'ma get you for your paper
Make you leave you girl
(Imagine that)
Make you trick on me around the world
(Imagine that)
Have you calling me your ultimate thrill
(Imagine that)
I got you whipped tell your niggas to chill
(I'ma hit you in the backseat and tell you to slide)
Imagine that
(Me and my fold got my broads collide)
Imagine that
(Knocking girls off two at a time)
Imagine that
(Disrespect you and still make you mine)

Uh, imagine I'm your teacher and you stayed after school
You've been a bad girl you broke all the rules
Forgot your homework, chewed gum in class
And the only way to fix it is to give me some ass
I got a three piece suit on sitting at my desk
I kinda need a shave but my body smell fresh
You're wearing a plad skirt and long white socks
The vibe is thick baby, we both red hot
I kiss your neck unbutton your blouse
Let my fingers make circles on the edge of your mouth
Your apple's so ripe I'm your tutor for life
Got your beggin' me to put you on detention tonight
You could read the Iliad and the whole Odyssey
But no Trojan soldier scold you like me
Match the calculus then measure my frequency
But when you blast on my lap that's the highest degree
Put your hands on the chalkboard scratch it with ya nails
Give me goose pimples when ya put yo tongue on my dimples
Baby feel me now you got yo ass suspended
Got a letter for your parents but I didn't want to send it
I stopped by the crib you invited me in
You convinced me somehow to sip some juice and gin
Then you take me to your parent's room and laid me on my back
You twisting, kissing ya fist like that
Rubber meets the road till the tire goes flat
I filled it up with air again baby hold that
You a bad girl look you got your sheets all wet
Squeeze tight so I never forget the teacher's pet

[Chorus]

You was laughing with your girlfriends, sippin' a drink
When I came up from behind you and wrapped you with my mink
Guided you to the dance floor and held you tight
We in the Tunnel in the back with the dim red lights
I'm rocking the tank top baby nothing but ice
You rocking the baby tee and mini skirts and spikes
The club is so black we can't see our own hands
I know you feel that bulge through them Fubu pants
You bold huh, want to feel it in your hands
Rub your ass all up on it cause you know that I want it
God gave you beauty and you love to flaunt it
Life is a song, you were born to perform it
Drink the Cristal at the same time
Get intoxicated till we lose are minds
The crowd separated as we start to shine
I lift you in the air your skirt starts to climb
We tongue kiss deep in front of the whole crowd
The lights start to flash the music is too loud
We hit the back door and jump in the limousine
You pull up your skirt I put some ice in between
You're tired from the dancing so I kiss your feet
Even though we outside I hear the bass from the beat
Funkmaster Flex chop it up for the freaks
DJ Enuff make the mommies want to creep
No problem uh mi spouse no aqui
Tu muy caliente tu vamos con mi
Si mami I'm the chauffeur make it whip
Take a ride bet you never forget
Here we go

Talking midnight black, nappy hair with peas in the back
Scratch my pipe up every time I hit that (oow)

First you got to love yourself, then you can love me

That's the joint you gotta listen to, why know what I mean?
Check this out why y'all

I got the key that fits the lock of a real dog's mind be	
The answer to the question chicks ask most the time see
Why my man cheat and give some bitch my heat?
Slap me one day then Sunday he's so sweet?
To me and mine, this nigga's hard to define
Cause he beefing when he broke but he arrogant when he shine
It fucks you up, you wonder if you wasting time
Mention marriage, he lit a Dutch and peeped out the blinds
What different niggas feels in they hearts is scary
I used to say shit like,
""see man baby, you should be honored to share me""
She used to throw the cakes up, plus the burger was hairy
I used to have to think of shit to keep 'em coming, you niggas feel me?
Baby or no baby I wasn't loyal or nothing
Just me and my niggas on tour, fronting and hitting something
Red lipstick prints all over my drawers
Oh you want to be an actress huh? Well my movie's hardcore
Like Dungeons and Dragons, getting brains in a Benz wagon
Step out, jeans sagging, crew laughing
Getting blazed by the fiend for ten bones a piece
Nothing but the dog in me needing to be released
This is us

You know that I do, the best that I can
But you don't seem to love me no more, no more
I try to please you, and be your man
But you don't seem to love me no more, no more

The flip side of the coin, what team you want to join?
You in The Tunnel every Sunday exposing your tenderloins
In every rap cat's face, with some ol' flirty shit to say
Need to go home, wash your kids up, and put your tits away
Me and my clique in motion, champagne and Alize
Got your mind bubbling crazy, want to flip Cool J
Spend your last on your hairdo, but you ain't save a dime
To put your child through college baby, now have you?
Go get a job interview, your bad-ass kids a curfew
And skip that ""Bills Bills"" shit broads is goin' through
I know this prostitute who said that life ain't cute
Child born with a destiny only God can dispute
Players giggle and laugh, flashing gats and cash
My dogs don't care about you Boo, they like your ass
Told me if I call and your man answer, ask for L
So he can say, ""No L live here,"" our code is ill
Tell him you about to catch a flick with Sherell
Plotting and scheming in the shower, masturbating on the cell
The neighborhood hustler, that cat we all know
That nigga we grew up with, son from next do'
My dream was to flow and escape the hell below
But the demons in my life set fire to my dough
I thought about murder, I vowed my revenge
Like the devil's pumping hate through my heart with a syringe
This is us

They say a man goin' be a man, but that's only half the scenario
You nag a cat, you giving him a license to fuck a hoe
When a man come home late, he want his girl to say hello
Not hear all that bullshit, bout, ""Nigga where you go?""
Fried chicken ready, t-shirt and panties at the stove
Messages written down, blunt rolled ready to go
Give me a hug, not too long, give me space
When a cat got issues don't need you all up in his face
Rub your breasts, kick back, smile a little
If it's raining outside, chill, listen to the drizzle
Now kiss my chest, call me Superman
Pull down my boxers by the Calvin Klein band
Wash it, enjoy the flavor, I return the favor
This behavior, should save ya
From me all night freaking, with a nineteen year-old
Half naked Puerto Rican, creamy ass leaking
Every man will agree, when she nag it's killing me
I don't always want to talk about how the world is shitting on me
I sip some Alize and meditate the pain away
And get in my own zone where I want to be alone for solo
Reminisce with photos
And missed opportunities to make some dough flow, you know?
Chill, relax baby, support me from the background
Believe in my dreams, instead, you and your girls sat 'round
Complain about, who's trading ass for cash
If there ain't no trust then just us can't last
This is us, I know you feeling that
Think about that shit, word up

Word up
And you say New York City
A-ha-ha, word up (Take me away, baby)

Damn, you and your man had beef
So he left you Uptown, teary eyed, on the back streets
For me to scoop up in the Bentley drop
Long as God hold me down you know I had to stop
What the deal ma? You want to use my cell?
You running solo? This block foul as hell
You said my ex be beating on me
He mad jealous even though he be cheating on me
I said miss, let me tell you something
Bout who's making major moves and who's fronting
Huh, who's talking loud but ain't saying nothing
And those who get the one they want but keep fronting
He don't appreciate the well til it run dry
Love is blind, it's hard to say goodbye {goodbye}
But smart birds choose to fly
Cause we living in the hood girlfriend, it's do or die
Here's my definition, of love everlasting
I would trade all my cash in, for passion
Tiffany jewels and designer fashions
To hear happiness is mine for the asking
Every day on my knees I pray
That I would run into someone that make me feel this way
What you think, you want to ride with L?
Some things are meant to be baby, you never can tell
{I want to ride, with you baby}

[Chorus]
Every night, every day
I just sit and dream about you
You and me, you and me,
Hold me tight, ecstasy
Making love til ever after
Baby you and me, yeah, you and me

Now we dipping on the FDR
It's one of them lucky nights when you can peep out the stars
We speak without talking and the world is ours
When I glance over at ya I can feel your power
You scheming, L want a one-night stand
I'm scheming, she probably in love with her man
But we keep on rolling, hoping there's something more
Dreaming about tomorrow and what life got in store
Living, no drama, we can chill, relax
Sex all night in the morn' count stacks
Sip Grand Marnier and maybe puff a dime sack
But only in moderation, we ain't living like that, ya know?
We jetted up the tavern on the green
To talk about love cause the game's extreme
Domestic abuse and everything in between
Cause I want you to think of me when you need a shoulder to lean on
I'm from Queens, I'ma rep to the fullest
But I'd rather chill with you, 'stead of dodging bullets
Glock in the stash I don't really want to pull it
On some so-called thug cat, that's faker than acrylics
He said your fam' be riding your nerves
And you hate him for never giving you the life you deserve
Remember, the one who hold a grudge is foul
And everything you ever wanted is in front of you now
Whats up?

[Chorus]

I promise you, dreams do come true
There's trials and tribulations that we all go through
When your heart's bleeding, how could the sky seem blue?
But listen up shorty, this is what I want to do
Be there for you, baby care for you
When my dogs stare at you never sharing you
And to my ex-girlfriend, never comparing you
And do the things that your ex never dared to do
Time to bounce baby, I'm taking you home
Look at the moonlight sparkle on the 20 inch chrome
The rocks on my hand got a life of they own
Plus the blend tape's bumping and it's setting the tone
Should I jet to the hotel, is now the right time
Or should I be patient and explore your mind?
You said you grew up in the ghetto and it hurt your heart
Tried to live smart but your dreams fell apart
You dated hustlers and brought 'em customers
They totally destroyed whatever trust their was
Now you hate men and everything they stand for
Cause you want to be treated like a queen, not a whore
Close your eyes, don't be afraid to dream
Open your heart to this cat from Queens
Whatever you want to do, however you want to do it
Back to back baby, we can get each other through it

[Chorus: x3]

Know mean? Word up
Yeah, yeah
See'mon, see'mon
See'mon, see'mon
Yeah,
I just want you to think about that, ya know what I'm saying?
Late at night when you laying there
And you feel like the whole world is falling around you
Remember these words that I said
There's somebody out there for you baby
Might be me, you never know,
Word up, stay strong shorty
Keep your eyes up to the sky, know what I'm saying?
Don't let nobody tell you you can't make it
And don't let nobody around you tell you
That it ain't possible to make your dreams come true
Word up,
Know mean? That's real
Queens represent, rock on

It's so hot it's, LL's version of the East coast chronic
Smoke 'til your lungs collapse
You supposed to be the nigga, where all the drama at?
So ironic, L came back
Flooded the market - got your mens on the wall
holdin his blunt, too fucked up to spark it
Show me a nigga who can do like I do
Then gas your mans up so I can rip that nigga too
Braggin you goin platinum like that shit brand new
I was platinum in eighty-five, what THE FUCK wrong with you, huh?
Come (?) L - what you call rocks to me is minerals
Tried to throw salt on my name, shit's political
The baddest man on the planet
So ill when I'm spittin niggaz take it for granted
Cram to understand it, I'll switch and write it lefthanded
Heat my pinky ring up and leave your bitch branded
Got a voice like a cannon - nigga shoot
I don't think she really hot, your career is a fluke
I'm the best MC to ever touch the pen
Take a look at what I'm doin it will not be done again
As sure I am the descendant of former slaves
I'ma resurrect brothers from they mental graves
Make 'em confess - LL's the most rugged
God, and no man's above it, gotta love it

Droppin bombs - spots get blown
So why would you assume my style wouldn't bloom
When I rap, wack MC's vacate the room
Cause they suck, and that's how I feel
I'ma smack down the A&R who signed the deal
Then wrap 'round his neck yo' reel to reel
So next time he know, how the real feel
Get loose and wrap hand 'round the steel
Leave you in the truck, wrapped 'round ya wheel

And every rapper why'all like, sample my shit
(Name one) I'm nice, and there's no mistakin
I threw a bomb rhyme in the hands of Troy Aikman

Spit more raps to count more stacks
Kicking back in the coup

Kiss the ring, begone
Known and respected on any block you be on
And be on, stand there, get your mad on
I chuckle cause there's nothing to waste energy on
There you have it

The jewels and the papers, sports cars and such

Maybe some day you'll feel, how I feel, it's crazy

Uh, uh, slide out to Venice, my game's in order
Would chip in to vent, but the city's on water
Searchlights and fireworks bling the sky
A vowel on the end of everything we buy
Yellow ice in both ears, I loosen up the tie
I'm lovin' this life style, baby I can't lie
It feels so good it make a grown man cry
Cause I made it out the hood and a lot of my crew died
I guess I had determination
And baby girl kept me in the congregation
Now it's private jets and deep conversation
Hundred G's a month to show appreciation
All eyes on us, the cameras flash
In God We Trust, I don't love this cash
But you was definitely, by my side when my world collapsed
Now I'm, rich for life and I'm payin you back

LL Cool J,"Yeah, this one's dedicated, to my grandmother, and your grandmother
It's all love, let's not forget who raised us, word up

Big Mama, my grandmother, my main girl
I love you much more than the scandalous world
As a young boy you gave me whoopings to save my life
Cursed me out, to keep me out the streets at night

'Cause my momma had me when she was young
So you took on the responsibility to raise your grandson
You taught me if a task is once begun, Todd
Never leave it 'til it's done, Todd

Be thy labor great or small Todd
Do it well or not at all, God
Big Mama, my blood is your blood
When the whole world's against me, I know I got your love

If I was in a cell for the rest of my life
I know I'd hear your prayers in the middle of the night
Used to sit me on your lap and teach me mother with
Early Sunday morning for them salmon and grits

I love you baby, you the one and only, that's a fact
'Til death do us part, I'ma always have your back
You beefed 'cause you heard that I was cursin' in my raps
Eighty-six, still you want to run and get the straps

I love you, I promise you I care for you deep
'Cause when I had bronchitis you would rock me to sleep
Rub me down with green alcohol
Little brown-skinned lady bout five feet tall, Big Mama

[Chorus]
Early one Sunday morning
Breakfast was on the table (you gave me unconditional love)
There was no time to eat, she said to me
Boy hurry to Sunday school (you gave me unconditional love)

I remember when you told me certain friends wasn't real
I didn't want to listen, I swore I knew the deal
Come to find out, everything you said was true
Who I end up goin' to for advice? You

I love you, that's why you got nurses and maids
Ever since I got paid, you ain't never been afraid
That's granddaddy wife, she taught me how to think
How to navigate through life, you made the sacrifice

You kept on livin', 'cause when my granddaddy died
It took all your might, but you ain't quit on life
We took trips down South, biscuits and chicken
Me you granddad and Alison, trippin'

Remember, you used to pick me up from junior high
And classmates laughed when the Buick rolled by
Remember, I pulled my privates out in class
And from Farmers to Dunkirk you straight whooped my (woo!)

The best cookin' a man could ever taste
It's written in my heart, it can never be erased
Thank you so much, you taught me well

How to not get souped up, because I'm LL
How to walk the street, and hold my head real high
How to live with Christ and not be afraid to die

We sipped daiquiris, but you never told moms
We even shared beers, Big Mama my dear
A toast to a woman that raised a man
In popular demand all across the land

You're my lawyer, my teacher, my doctor, my friend
My mother, my father, you with me 'til the end
I love you, I mean that from the bottom of my heart
That's the reason why my record's number one on the charts

I'm a tell it like it is, I love you forever
Dead or alive, we'll always be together
Big Mama I love you

[Chorus]

I dedicate this to the Big Mama's everywhere
The ones who raised us, when nobody else was there
The ones who held us and told us it'll be alright
When gunshots was goin' off every night

Taught us how to lock the door and check the peephole
And how to swallow Vicks when we had a chest cold
How to stay proud, and represent hard
Eat plenty baby, but first say grace for God

Big Mama, I'm a miss you
When one of us leave this earth
But baby for what it's worth, I love you since the date of my birth
And if it wasn't for my children, I would want to go first

You're the reason I'm the man I am today
The inspiration, for me to be LL Cool J
When you told me ""Knock 'em Out,"" I brought you home a Grammy
I learned to be tough from Big Mama and Aunt Cammy

A black man that was raised by black women
On tour, sippin your special honey and lemon
You told me, gargle with vinegar water and salt
The concert was hot, thanks to your support

Girl, you're the one I love
Whether right here with me or smilin' from up above
Trouble or no trouble, you always had my back
So I had to let you know your son appreciates that, Big Mama

Is it the, invisible settings on the baguettes?
The Benzes, Beamers and Corvettes?
Or the, wood-grain in the convertible Lex
Be ease, shopping sprees, what designer is next?
Is it the, Diablo, parked on Rodeo?
Half a mill' in the trunk and I ain't moved no llello
Could it be I'm, anti-pimp, hundred-thousand a clip
Hat low, doing donuts when I pull up out the dealership

The way I brainwash y'all to love one another
And got the whole community bouncing in unity

They say Ladies, Love, Legend in Leather
Simple ain't it, uh, but quite clever
Is it the, fact I melt in liquid ice?
Tapped it once, you felt it twice
Is it the, multiple O's I'm known for those
Temptation Island, wilding cause my neck froze
Is it the, bowlegged, hard-headed
Little honey in my grill with her pinkies wetted?
Forget it

Tell your roommate you ain't dancing no more, yeah
Tell 'em your new man is cooler than before, yeah
Tell 'em bout them twenty-thousand on tour, yeah

The project stairs, I'll be there
Runnin' my fingers through your hair

My lollipop ecstasy's on top of me
Just like I thought, it's a small world after all
I don't care if your neighbors hear us down the hall
Make 'em jealous, what they gon' tell us?
If you don't tell your girls baby, I won't tell the fellas
If you don't plea, I orchestrated icebergisms
Visions of my lollipop's thick risen, for my wisdom

This is hard to say
I want to make sure I go about this in the right way
'Cause lately I been busy a lot
And I know you don't feel appreciated and what not
I used to tell you that you're hair looked fly
Kiss you slow and stare in your eyes
Now I talk real foul and slick
Every other sentence is, ""You make me sick""
Back in the days I was your number one pick
Now your heart's half-broken and that's hard to fix
I had to dig deep inside myself
'Cause I can't see you bouncin' with somebody else

When I was too embarrassed to admit I was in love
And you was my good girl that wouldn't give it up
I can't let us self-destruct

Baby smile today
'Cause I been on that journey always
I'm gon' love you better
When your friends'll see you too
Just when you think there's nothin' else I can do
I'm gon' love you better

When I think about the things we did
And I think about you having my kids
And I think about us sharing a crib
Losin' all that, God forbid
You deserve flowers and candy, the simple things
In addition to the SL's, bigets and rings
Instead I walk around like I'm a king
And having you ain't nothing but a thing
I even stopped tellin' you the lovin' was good
Too busy frontin' in the hood
Baby girl, hold me tight don't ever let go
I'ma do it real gentle baby, nice and slow
One more chance baby and don't say no
'Cause I got another side to show
Some say love is painful it helps you grow
Well it's time for the pain to go, ya'know

Baby smile today
'Cause I been on that journey always
I'm gon' love you better
When your friends'll see you too
Just when you think there's nothin' else I can do
I'm gon' love you better

Do you think I meant to hurt you? (No)
Do you think I meant to hurt you? (No)
So let's laugh together, cry together
God willin' we gon' die together

Do you think I meant to hurt you? (No)
Do you think I meant to hurt you? (No)
So let's laugh together, cry together
God willin' we gon' die together

It's a brand new me, a brand new you
A brand new day, sky so blue
Hold my hand while I walk with you
Sit on my lap, lemme talk to you
No more games callin' you foul names
Actin' like females is all the same
I'm gon' love you better, my mentality changed
From this day forward I'll never be the same
I'ma rub your lower back, share my dreams
I love you, lemme show you what I mean
Give you the deepest love a girl ever seen
Watch you sleep, so peaceful and serene
A toast to the queen, you're back in my life
But this time I'ma do it right
Trust me, from the bottom of my heart
Nothin's gonna tear us apart, promise

Baby smile today
'Cause I been on that journey always
I'm gon' love you better
When your friends'll see you too
Just when you think there's nothin' else I can do
I'm gon' love you better

Actin' like the L's can't bag 'em no more
Nightgown draggin' on the heated marble floor
Flash Cartier when you open up the door, slide these on baby

So butter, still relate to the gutter
Just your life style's different, spirit uplifted
Fell in love with a cat who's gifted
Turn you back to paradise, damn I missed it

Pop a bottle, light a purple candle
I got somethin' that you can't quite handle, that's why you love me
Pour bubbly, glow from the flame make your skin shine lovely

This is for my number one
This is for my number one
True baby for I adore

This is hard to say
I wanna make sure I go about this in the right way
'cause lately I been busy a lot
And I know you don't feel appreciated and what not
I used to tell you that you're hair looked fly
Kiss you slow and stare in your eyes
Now I talk real foul and slick
Every other sentence is, ""You make me sick""

Back in the days I was your number one pick
Now your heart's hair-broken and that's hard to fix
I had to dig deep inside myself
'cause I can't see you bouncin' with somebody else
It's a long journey back to the place we was
When I was too embarrassed to admit I was in love
And you was my good girl that wouldn't give it up
I can't let us self-destruct

Baby smile today
'cause I been imaginin' more ways
I'm gon' love you better
When your friends'll see you too
Just when you think there's nothin' else I can do
I'm gon' love you better

When I think about the things we did
And I think about you having my kids
And I think about us sharing a crib
Losin' all that, God forbid
You deserve flowers and candy, the simple things
In addition to the SL's, baguettes and rings
Instead I walk around like I'm a king
And having you ain't nothing but a thing

I even stopped tellin' you the lovin' was good
Too busy frontin' in the hood
Baby girl, hold me tight don't ever let go
I'ma do it real gentle baby, nice and slow
One more chance baby and don't say no
'cause I got another side to show
Some say love is painful it helps you grow
Well it's time for the pain to go, you know

Baby smile today
'cause I been imaginin' more ways
I'm gon' love you better
When your friends'll see you too
Just when you think there's nothin' else I can do
I'm gon' love you better

Do you think I meant to hurt you?
(No)
Do you think I meant to hurt you?
(No)
So let's laugh together, cry together
God willin' we gon' die together

Do you think I meant to hurt you?
(No)
Do you think I meant to hurt you?
(No)
So let's laugh together, cry together
God willin' we gon' die together

It's a brand new me, a brand new you
A brand new day, sky so blue
Hold my hand while I walk with you
Sit on my lap, lemme talk to you
No more games callin' you foul names
Actin' like females is all the same
I'm gon' love you better, my mentality changed
From this day forward I'll never be the same

I'm a rub your lower back, share my dreams
I love you, lemme show you what I mean
Give you the deepest love a girl ever seen
Watch you sleep, so peaceful and serene
A toast to the queen, you're back in my life
But this time I'm a do it right
Trust me, from the bottom of my heart
Nothin' is gonna tear us apart, promise

Baby smile today

Just when you think there's nothin' else I can do

LL Cool J,"Uh yeah 
See, this is what these mixtapes is all about 
Knah'msayin KaySlay?
Talk to the people, with no interruptions and interference 

Put that mic down, admire the technique and tight tight sounds
Of a Renagade, never been afraid, the time is right now
Before I take my bow and finally allow
My love affair with rap to fade, I'll sink into the page
Pleasure and the pain that came from rulin' the game
And the half Dominican that gave me brains in the fast lane
A seventeen-year reign, simple and plain
When I ruled the rap game and all my peers sold cocaine
One-three-two Uptown, when Rich Porter told me
""See you can push a new car, it's different for a rap star""
And AZ was givin' 50s to the homeless
They never bragged about it ? ""L, we don't condone this""
On the back of the bike with Alpo
Doin' a buck down one-two-five, hopin' to stay alive

Favorite spot rooftop
Me and Big chuckle up when he was hittin' up ""Juicy"" and whatnot
Damn, when Dapper Dan got shot up
Before they made drops when we had to cut the top up
Some cats neglected the fact that L was hot
Cause they warm and electin' me hot when I stepped in the spot
Lyrically reppin' the block on Farmers to rock
But my sex symbol status made me, corny to cop
The microphone strategist ripped the apparatus
Left competition embarrassed but I never held malice

Kinda saw street literature
Used to lose battles on purpose so these cats can dream more
I want to see y'all shine without the use of a nine
You might see a nigga, I see a black Einstein
A diamond in the rough, he's remidin' me as tough
Young girls takin' X, she's blinded by the stuff
Oh my God, where did we go wrong?
Are you doin' what you're doin 'cause I ruined you with songs?
God forgive me, I never knew my power to devour the demons
Y'all know the Devil be schemin'
It's a manifestation of the pain of a nation
That makes materialism the only thing we're chasin'
The real gangstas never talked to me tough
Never told me they was hard, or claimed to be my God
When I first found the courage to bounce up outta Queens
And saw Big Dave comin' up out the store with money machines
My only dream was to rock mics in the spotlight
Joint bumpin' on Marley Show all night
Whoever thought that I would be a movie star?
A rap icon, chokin' the game like a python
Russell turned the hype on, exploded like a pipe bomb 
Just because a young boy, turned the mic on
Still admire skills and cats that are ill
With lyri-kills, nowadays the chorus is payin' the bill
The black man found a way outta the hood
Now it's slaves to mayor's not all good
Don't let 'em take our music and plagiarize the game
Then you call up and request it and pretend it's really flames?
The tip of the iceberg, I'll hold my piece
In the meantime, live smart, watch out for the beast
Lyrical Picasso flow masterpiece
Like Michaelangelo or Rembrant, you know?
Si palare poco Italiano

Más mejor siempre mi amigo
Pero, music is muy muy duro
Tú sabe, que tú quieres es no problema
Te quiero mucho, yo comprendo your dilemma

Yeah I'm still at it, the microphone addict
You get your dome splattered, 'cause homey will not have it
Your ashes get scattered across the Atlantic
For actin' like you a teenage chick with her bra padded
You might laugh at it, but if you do the knowledge
It's really a tad tragic how they runnin' through they cabbage
You know my track record, L battle like a savage
I think and grow rich, that gives me the advantage
Uncle LL, I got product for sale
So I can bail Al Sharpton out of jail
Somebody gotta do it, somebody in the black community
Gotta get this money while y'all march for unity
So march on, I'ma get my Bentley park on
Then get my dogs a platform to bark on

Children shiverin' under the covers
The man in black, the tilted Fedora hat
I'm bringin' it raw, you never want your money back
I'm focused baby, livin' like a quarterback
Playin' in the wishbone, L keep options black

Everybody can see I'm the king of rippin' coliseums
C'mon, youse a male groupie beggin' for per diem
A fruitcake laid out in the masoleum
I'm the richest man in Babylon, nobody could see him
Money's my slave, it do what I say
It cry for me, like Denzel in ""Glory""
But I broke the cycle, no more poverty
I wonder if you hatin' on the low, probably!
But cats know I'm real, I keep 'em on they heels
Damn! Look at my body, coulda been a Navy Seal
But you lack the discipline to do what I do
Reinvention, I'm in the 11th dimension
I'm a value stock pop, get it while it's hot
Cause once I blow, I'ma split and that's it

Aye yo E it's one o'clock
Time to get one and bounce baby
It's time to get one and bounce, 
You know what time it is

I want twenty million, you know he liftin' weights
Last week, me and the President was takin' flicks
Last week, my video dropped and you was sick
Last week, I copped my lil' shorty some kicks
That cost 29 hundred, homey you don't want it
My ears stay flooded like your man stay blunted
My American Express is Black, I'm at the Sumit

For real God is good, he took me out the hood
Got me livin' in a mansion like a big boy should
And I never do Cribs, I ain't gonna have y'all fruitcakes
Knowin' how I live, bed extra big
You sit around, run your mouth, potbelly on the couch
Claimin' you hot but honey what you wove out
When she alone, pump L, I make her bounce
You on the corner riskin' your life to sell a ounce
Wish you was Pablo, lay in the carbo
With a chick named Margo who flew from Chicago
But no, in real life cats catch it

Surroundin' my table, watchin' me like cable
My Dolce hat was low, Versace shades
Had the Prada shoes on 'cause the world is a stage
Lah-lah in the air, it's a sky bar affair
The glamorous life, I had my glass in the air
When my eyes connected with somethin' real real nice
Like she finished her drink and started chewin' on my ice
Her smile was bananas, teeth was pearly white
That's when I realized it'll be a long night

The tools was knockin, honey want to get it poppin'
Try my best to chill, she was fresh out of Brazil
People was walkin' by makin' our drinks filled
What would you do, if you was a Don
In a position to wild out with a Brazilian blond?
Or maybe you a honey and it's hard to keep calm
Cause you sippin' on somethin' and homeboy's the bomb
You dancin' in your seat, and singin' along
And every sip makes you feel like you need to perform
The party is packed, it's just a little too warm
But you take another sip to prove that you strong

I'm a star for real my aura is crazy
Hollywood love me in the streets I'm gravy
Born with a gift to inspire the hood
You want to out do me and I wish you would
I'm the master separate from all these cats
I'm laughin' in '86 I balled like that
Honey catching feeling from sittin' in Maybachs
Cause her project hall is smelling like Ajax
That's understandable but everybody relax
Hate when folk get money and don't know how to act
I'm a multi millionaire homey that's a fact
But it's not the ice that makes ya wife react
Been had an entourage and platinum cards
Been getting Swedish massage in Boca Raton
What you think all them years I ain't pop no Don
Spend a night in Trump Towers with a blue eyed blond
I been did it all my Benzes was kitted
When you talk like a baller you tickle me with it
But yeah there's money out there come on lets get it
But I'm a get it in such a way you never forget it
Let's go twenty platinum albums in a row
Sixty thousand fans a three hour show
I could care less who drop and blow
My name is LL baby that's beyond the flow

These rap cats get upset with me
When security clear out the V.I.P
If honey want to lounge we gone see ID
Ain't no negotiating you gone pay my fee
I'm the boss I call the shots to keep it hot
I don't have competition I'm bigger than the slot
While you waste advances on gray market rocks
I cop municipal bonds and Wal Mart stocks
A family man but hard as a rock
And I die for my kids so stay off my block
They might be impressed with you but I'm not
After all these years I still walk with a bop
Still keep the ink hot
Still scheme like a fox
Still ready to battle
You don't want your career stopped
Industry shocked 'cause I mapped out a plot
And ran around humble with my joint on cock

Hush baby, wanna let ya know
This is how its gonna go
If you wanna come and play
Gotta do it my way
Hush baby, don't talk so much
Just wanna feel ya touch
Everything will be OK
If you do it my way (my way, my way)
Hush baby

You feel so good
Rest of my life I wish I could
Hold you tight and take a flight out the hood
Was I foul or just misunderstood?
Mind-mannered or up to no-good
It really doesn't matter, either way I should
Maximize the moment and hold ya close
Jump in the drop spider and cruise down the coast
Who loved you the most?
I was never ghost
When lives was on the line
Confusion in ya mind
Runnin' outta time
Drama of all kind
But there's faith in our mind
We spiritually inclined
Sometimes I flip
Sometimes you flip
Sometimes we wild out and act like lunatics
We movin' too fast, the whole world's in a rush
Everybody just hush

Hush baby, wanna let ya know
This is how its gonna go
If you wanna come and play
Gotta do it my way
Hush baby, don't talk so much
Just wanna feel ya touch
Everything will be OK
If you do it my way (my way, my way)
Hush baby

Its all a test, the pain, the drama
The villa in the Bahamas
The highs, the lows
The hoop-t, the Rolls
The money flowin'
Certain doors that we go in
The people we meet, the hands that we shake
Whether its Mortans or Sizzla steak
But everything will be okay
[w/ 7 Aurelius] if we do it my way
'cause I believe in romance
Kissin' while ya slow dance
Me bouncin' baby? no chance
No matter the circumstance
Whatever it takes girl, ill swim to France
'cause ya beauty's unmatched
Such a great catch
Unconditional love, forever we are attached
Deal with the drama, we can find our way back
With or without the Maybach

Hush baby, wanna let ya know
This is how its gonna go
If you wanna come and play
Gotta do it my way
Hush baby, don't talk so much
Just wanna feel ya touch
Everything will be OK
If you do it my way (my way, my way)

I can feel ya pain
Like we Siamese twins connected by our brains
Walkin' through the desert in the ice cold rain
Want you in my life and nothin's gonna change
God willin', we still be doin' our thing
When my six-pack's faded
Raps outdated
But that's many years from now so don't rush
Little mama just hush

Hush baby, wanna let ya know
This is how its gonna go

Easy does it
Ladies love it, cats with big budgets

We be gel two jets and Tar Smith luggage
Clowns talkin' rubish and pretendin' they thuggish
But I'm a young livin' legend like Pee Wee at the Rucker's (uh huh)
I was raised outta Queens

But rap kept me off of the cover of Fed's magazine
Put me in a Gulf Stream
Your man done it, push the EX 100
And you don't want it, I got the whole rap game cornered

Watch me flaunt it, damn right I'm iconic
Soon as Nix find an icy track I slide on it

Cats never front on me, they know I drive weight
He's the best that ever did it, they call me Cool J
They platinum selling or, my skins turning gray

Dot the I's cross the T's meticulous
The coldest winter ever and I'm so icicle-ish

The movement is flavorful, bags of licorice
The drop, the rock, the watch, the necklace
There's no forgettin' this, the way that I'm reppin' this
My bodyguard's big but do that make me rebelish
I'm in the Hamptons, game stronger than Sampson
That's why I'm still a teen pop idol like Hanson
Young black and handsome, movin' with the cheddar

Hold up, I don't gamble, I don't play no craps
I was taught early on don't jeopardize the stacks
Before I open my mouth, I get all the facts
I could never fall off, it's too many hot tracks
I'm affiliated with too many hot cats
To end up, crawlin' out of a hole in Iraq
Try to topple my regime
You end up in need of a scalpel to your spleen
Is there a medic on the scene?
Easy children, Queens is in the buildin'
That blank look on your grill'll get filled in
Slow down baby, you actin' like a clown homes
You get your fronts remodeled like a brownstone
You hear my heat rock comin' through your sheetrock
It means you're OD'n homeboy, here come the detox

I do it for the ladies, but it's all money baby

They pay me so much it's hard for them to swallow
When you got 'em by the balls, their hearts and minds follow
Pay yourself first, that's one of my main mottos
Picture Bill Gates on the block dodgin' hollows
I can't see it player that's beneath my vision
I'm beyond focused, every decision is made with precision
It seems like greed's the world religion
But L want cake, save the crumbs for the pidgeons
Black man, get the flies outcha eyes
You can't 'cause where you born but you affect where you die
Until that day, health and welfare, cheers
And after my wake, the hood'll talk, man listen here
He kept a mink and canaries in his ears
Like the Enterprise rollin' over stars for years
Spit bars for years, kept hot cars for years
The dice was loaded but he beat the odds for years, uh-huh!

To be or not to be the man, that's the question
Got a vision in my mind, I can see that I'm destined
To lean up in the backseat, givin' directions
Sweep the block clean as November elections
On the Blackberry readin' cash flow quadrant
Brim to the side, my gorillas is bonded
CLS Vision, four Humers behind it
You forgot I'm from Queens? You can get reminded
I'm a man's man, when you chumps gon' learn
If you play with fire you get poured in a urn
You must have been puffin on blunts of sherm
All my albums is platinum, it's been confirmed
I'm more than a symbol of sex, I get respect
For livin' in the hills but still keepin' it mad real
Stay on course, the boss crush obstacles
You burnin' me, two words: I'm-possible

LL Cool J,"My radio, believe me, I like it loud
I'm the man with a box that can rock the crowd
Walkin' down the street, to the hardcore beat
While my JVC vibrates the concrete
I'm sorry if you can't understand
But I need a radio inside my hand
Don't mean to offend other citizens
But I kick my volume way past 10
My story is rough, my neighborhood is tough
But I still sport gold, and I'm out to crush
My name is Cool J, I devastate the show
But I couldn't survive without my radio
Terrorizing my neighbors with the heavy bass
I keep the suckers in fear by the look on my face
My radio's bad from the Boulevard
I'm a hip-hop gangster and my name is Todd
Just stimulated by the beat, bust out the rhyme
Get fresh batteries if it won't rewind
Cause I play everyday, even on the subway
I would of got a summons but I ran away
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go
But I know I can't live without my radio

Suckers on my jock when I walk down the block
I really don't care if you're jealous or not
Cause I make the songs, you sing along
And your radio's def when my record's on
So get off the wall, become involved
All your radio problems have now been solved
My treacherous beats make ya ears respond
And my radio's loud like a fire alarm
The floor vibrates, the walls cave in
The bass makes my eardrums seem thin
Def sounds in my ride, yes the front and back
You would think it was a party, not a Cadillac
Cause I drive up to the ave, with the windows closed
And my bass is so loud, it could rip your clothes
My stereo's thumpin' like a savage beast
The level on my power meter will not decrease
Suckers get mad, cause the girlies scream
And I'm still gettin' paid while you look at me mean
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go
But I know I can't live without my radio
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go
And I know I can't live without my radio

Don't touch that dial, I'll be upset
Might go into a fit and rip off your neck
Cause the radio's thumpin' when I'm down to play
I'm the royal chief rocker LL Cool J
Let your big butt bounce from right to left
Cause it's a actual fact this jam is def
Most definitely created by me
Goin' down in radio history
I'm good to go on your radio
And I'm cold gettin' paid cause Rick said so
Make the woofers wallop and your tweeters twitch
Some jealous knuckleheads might try to dis
But it's nothin', ya frontin', ya girl I am stuntin'
And my radio's loud enough to keep you gruntin'
My name is Cool J, I'm from the rock
Circulating through your radio non-stop
I'm lookin' at the wires behind the cassette
And now I'm on the right, standing on the eject
Wearin' light blue Pumas, a whole lot of gold
And jams like these keep me in control
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go
And I know I can't live without my radio

Your energy level starts to increase
As my big beat is slowly released
I'm on the radio and at the jam
LL Cool J is who I am
I'ma make ya dance, boogie down and rock
And you'll scratch and shake to my musical plot
And to expand my musical plan
Cut Creator, rock the beat with your hands

That's right, so don't try to front the move
As you become motivated by the funky groove
You can see me and Earl chillin' on the block
With my box cold kickin' with the gangster rock
See people can't stop me, neither can the police
I'm a musical maniac to say the least
For you and your radio I made this for
Cool J's here to devastate once more
Pullin' all the girls, takin' out MCs
If ya try to disrespect me, I just say Please!

Got the girls looking raw in the front

Got a call your man's in town
Tell the bar, a-nother round
Got all my mans holding me down
Kinda thick ma, let's get down, so get wit it

He will make a way, yes he will
Yes, he will

Oh, I do believe that we will make it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Uh uh
I was at rock bottom, my whole life was mo' problems
Reincarnation of a slave pickin' cotton
Stress beamin' down like the sun I felt rotten
To the core, was at war, cause the enemy is plottin'
I hear him knockin', sayin' that we got him
Hot like solar, he wanna burn my soul up
World on my shoulders but I roll back ya boulders
Words have a funny way of comin back to scold ya
Watch what come out of your mouth, you crack a molar
I tried to told ya, he he he
Enemies gunnin', true believers ain't runnin'
Or duckin', we ain't scared of nothin', ya feel me?
They wanna test me and press my buttons, oh really?
Allow Uncle L to hip y'all to somethin', uh, uh
Yeah, uh, check it out
There's a living power, make a man out a coward
Rebuild your strength like the new Trade Towers
I thought that I was over, my life got devoured
Now I'm on top and I pray for all the doubters
Time to shout it, sing it louder

Yeah, we're gonna make it
We're gonna make it (we're gonna make it)
Thank God we made it (yeah)
And I mean it, yeah yeah, oh yeah

I was feelin' like my whole world was spinnin' and spillin'
On the ground and that God wasn't willin'
It seemed like the only ones ballin' was the villains
Dollar signs in they eyes, lyin' to our chillin'
I wanna kill 'em, I'd rather God hit 'em
They sellin' venom and we buyin' it like denim
These world wide webs they weave, we caught in 'em
Old folks is dyin' and CEO's skimmin'
The bat's in your hand and this is the 9th inning
Keep your eyes on the ball when you swingin'
Don't be confused, don't be fooled by the wind-up
Start switchin' your position, make your mind up
Pull your bootstraps tight, get your grind up
Get your life lined up before time's up
Yo, yo, you know what?
Take ten percent of that, dough you tryin' to stack
Send it up to God, I guarantee he send it back
Multiply it by a hundred times, y'all remember that
That's just a little jewel to get the monkey off your back
Uh, yeah, sing it out now

[Chorus]

In the darkest valley, through the loneliest alley
Never give up, press on through the storm
Weepin' man fall, for the night seem long
But if you stand strong joy come within the morn'
And it goes, on and on and on and on and on and-ah
I know it feels like your back's to the wall
Who's sittin' in the crib, and you don't know who to call
(Jesus!) Hangin' on a tight rope, fingers slippin' off
But you ain't by yourself dog, we all been lost
Stay on your course, carry your cross
Ain't no stoppin', got to keep it poppin'
You want it, you can get it, believe me the king did it
Nothin' gonna hold you back, there's no limits
I'm sent to bring truth to rap, not gimmicks
And I'm not finished, man listen
Here's the moral to the thesis, y'all cats need Jesus
He put your life back together, pick up the pieces
Word to the masses, I heard God asked us
For less fake rappers, and more real pastors
Uh-huh, uh-huh, so hereafter

We made it, we made it
Through the storm and rain, yeah
You can make it, yes you can
You can make it, you got me

I know you can, yes, yeah

(It's ridiculous)
It's been months and for some reason I just
(Can't get over us)
And I'm stronger than this

(Enough is enough)
No more walking round with my head down
I'm so over being blue, crying over you

And I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

Gotta fix that calendar I have that's marked July 15th
Because since there's no more you, there's no more anniversary
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you and your memory
And now every song reminds me of what used to be

That's the reason I'm
So sick of love songs, so tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

(Leave me alone)
Leave me alone
(Stupid love songs)
Don't make me think about her smile
Or having my first child
Let it go
Turning off the radio

'Cause I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears
So done with wishing she was still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

Said I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears
So done with wishing she was still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow

Uh-huh (I see you papi, si)

I was in Madrid yo
Had this hot club shooting my video
They was burning up the floor to that reggaeton
Start to bailando soon as they put the record on
I was sweating like a bullfighting matador
It was the sexiest scene that I ever saw
(La fiesta, tu mi a fuego)
But I was still cool in my light blue Kangol
I met this girl, she was off the chain yo
Cooley head model from San Diego
Father was from Trinidad, Tobago
Mother was from Rio, de Janeiro
She said please don't think I'm crazy
But I've been in love with you since the 80's
? cansando baby
Have you ever been with a latin lady

Uh, she said there's one thing you should know

I'm talking more than an autograph and picture
(Tu quiere, benita mi casa)
I mumbled to myself, she's a monster
She said (yo no se lo que no habla)
Don't worry 'bout it lil' mama nada
The chemistry and energy was getting hotter
This ain't like me but I feel like I gotta
She started moving near me
Whispered in my ear so I could hear more clearly
Said grab my waist and look in the mirror
Then started winding it like Shakira
All that shaking and belly dancing
I was going under, I ain't stand a chance man
If I do this, will I love it or regret it
Tempted and I don't know where this is headed

Yeah (si papi, uhh)

Then she kept begging saying let's go
Pulling on my arm, wouldn't let go
Rubbing my face, kissing my neck slow
When we do it say hablando como {?}
She said (ooh papi te quiero mucho)

You dropped out of school on top of that you knocked up

He was yo' crush, you was his crutch
He'll be gone a dime and it's hard to stay in touch
Your moms say you stupid but you love him so much

Y aqui estoi
1, 2, 3 muevete!

The club was far from empty 
It was crowded at the entry 
I slide right through like how I do 
This girl began to tempt me. 
She said her name Shaiyeeda 
I could tell her mama feed her 
When they tight and when them jeans don't fit 
I'm L, nice to meet ya. 
I could feel my body yearnin' 
The room just started turnin' 
Didn't wanna go out on the floor 
But this girl was so determined (Let's dance) 
My brain began to sizzle 
I'm sweatin' just a little 
On the dance floor in the middle, 
She turned around and giggled, 
She said

You got, you got, you got 
What it takes to make me leave my man 

It's hard to control myself 
It's hard to control myself 
You got, you got, you got 
What it takes to make this boy be bad 
It's hard to control myself 
It's hard to control myself 

It's hard for me to control myself 
Get to hold myself 
Back from 
Jumpin' on ya 
Like I wanna, 
Like I wanna, wanna. 

Temptation is a mother, 
How we lust for one another 
We barely know eachother 
Yet we're whilin' like we're lovers (uh huh) 
The air is filled with passion 
The strobe lights are flashin' 
The hustlers throw cash n 
The bar tender keeps splashin' 
Her moves were so erotic 
Her games were so hypnotic 
I bet this girl could stop it 
But she continued to pop it 

You know I know you like it, 
Let me hit you on your sidekick 
Cause the after party is at my body, 
Meet me, you're invited 

You got, you got, you got 
What it takes to make me leave my man

Like I wanna, 
Like I wanna, wanna. 

She licked off 
Her lip gloss 
Her hips toss 
Back and forth 
Side to side and 
Up and down 
She touched the ground 
It turned me out. 
I'm battlin' desire, 
Lord help me douse this fire 
This internal inferno, 
Hotter than a shot of cuervo 
Her top was short and purple 
Belly dancin' in a circle 
When I feel like this I can't resist 
I ? don't make me hurt you

You got, you got, you got

I can't believe it

[Chorus]
Finally I'm walking down that aisle
No need for the coping now
I found the perfect partner waiting for me at the altar
Made a vow before God to love me
And finally I'm walking down that aisle
I will never second guess us how
When we're laughing together, and we're crying together
Having kids together, my life begins right now

Finally the day has arrived
I'm standing at the altar, you're walking down the aisle
My heart skips a beat, emotions run wild
Half of me is crying, the other half smiles
I can feel my stomach turnin' and tossin' and goin' through it
I just can't believe it, I'm really 'bout to do it
Take the vow to be together forever
Plus promise I'ma be there, whenever, wherever
Through the ups and downs, through the darkest clouds
Side by side in the rain 'til the sun comes out
I was blind to love, God showed me you
Now I'm standin' here shakin 'bout to say ""I do""
And I do

[Chorus]

Butterflies, my palms are sweaty
It's a lifetime commitment, I pray that I'm ready
But your eyes tell me not to worry, you're sincere
Can't turn back now, destiny's why I'm here
Our friends laugh as I take you by the hand
But they single and this a feeling that they don't understand
You're my partner for life, I'ma treat you right
Our honeymoon's forever, not just tonight
Knew the time was right, to be husband and wife
Us both dressed alike in the purest white
Such a beautiful gown, friends and family around
Ignore the cold feet now, time to take these vows

[Chorus]

It's a beautiful and heavenly day
As the pastor asks, ""Who gives this woman away?""
Your father says ""I do"" and gives me a hand
Plus the tough guy, and I completely understand
He losin' a diamond and now you're mine and
He don't have to worry, I'm a keep you shinin'
I'm a build us a future, I'm a keep on climbin'
With our family on my back, cause that's my assignment
I'm a work overtime, make sure y'all live
But still find time for you and homework with the kids
Took a long time to learn, I was so hardheaded
But you stuck with me and you won't regret it, ""I do""

[Chorus]

And I do (I do)
Baby I do (I do)
Baby I do
We made a vow baby
I do (I do)
Baby I do (I do)

I'll, never second guess you",Down the Aisle,2006
LL Cool J,"Uh-huh, eh-heh
Lay back on this one (yeah, you know how I do baby)

You only a customer
When you walkin' in the presence of hustlers
Uh, I'm laid back in the cinnamon Range
Two decades and ain't a damn thing changed
Keep my girl, in strawberry swirls
You can taste it, my instict's basic
Lord have mercy, sweet like Hershey
Kisses, diamonds for the misses, ices on the wrist-es
All different colors of the spectrum
The smallest flaw and I reject 'em
Believe me I'm a connoisseur when I inspect 'em
I baguettes them, invisibly sets them
They call me big L-ly Wonka from Compton to Yonkers
Them Chi-Town steppers and them A-Town stompers
These young rookies, fail to understand
Every sumer I return like the ice cream man
Drop what you doin', get-it get-it while you can
By the eighth, by the ounce, when it's gone I'ma bounce
It's the F-L-A-V, no if's or maybe's
You know what I do, drive your taste buds crazy

[Chorus]
Like lemon drops with chocolate kisses
Every bite is more delicious
My favorite flavor
(Mix me and you and we can't go wrong)
Like caramel on vanilla sundae
Have a scoop you'll want some day
Cause you're my favorite flavor
(C'mon, baby baby c'mon) c'mon

My flavor's unreal
Smooth but hard like wood grain on the wheel
Recline your seat baby, enjoy how it feel
Why you crossin' your legs, them high heels of eel?
Kick off your shoes, run your toes on the dash
Now peel off your stockings, c'mon let's get it poppin'
I'm in the mood for cotton, candy and I'm plottin'
To see you in somethin' silky and see-through
Me too! Man you know how we do
Camcorder main feature, damn a preview
I love how the bottom on your body's EQ
Low but thick though like the base in a six-fo'
So here we go (here we go) we bunny hoppin'
I hit the switches baby, you keep it droppin'
It feels marvelous, you in charge of this
I hope you ain't heartless but my guard's now regardless

[Chorus]

(Uh) All I wanna do
Is eat you up 'cause you look so good
(Think I look alright huh?)
(I look better on you, what'chu really wanna do?)
All I wanna do
Is show you boy that I taste good too
(I know you taste good ma)
(What'chu sayin', want a sprinkle of the hood ha? Ha?)

We had it out
Now tell your girls the truth when they ask what I'm about
The cookies and the cream and the peaches 'n praline
Butter pecan themes in your daydreams
All real sugar, no sacca-rhine
Low calorie leave no cavities
Guaranteed no place you'd rather be
Than here with me, mix chocolate in the factory

What I did to you was wrong I admit it
I regret that I did it like a junkie when he's jonzin'
All alone in what used to be a home
But you packed up our joy in that bag you put your clothes in
The voice mail that you left me was scoldin'
Hot enough to burn a hole in a cauldron
Cause it was all true, that's why we all through
Now your girl's pickin' up the cell when I call you
Talkin' slick like she ain't here
She don't want you no more, punk disappear, click
I need to hit her with a brick
But that'll only lead me to a worse predicament
I hope your girlfriend ain't got you on a liquor binge

Every other weekend gone until the mornin'
Sneakin' out to my dirt, dead wrong
Comin' back past dawn with the guilty mask on
And I never counted the cost, took heed to warnings
Try to hurt a rose you get pricked by a thorn
And it don't feel nice, when you wake up nights
Shakin' in cold sweats and your whole life's a wreck
That was the old me, the one I still regret
The one you couldn't respect, the one you should forget
But I'ma keep on callin', fightin' 'til the end
On my knees 'til they bleed, to prove my love again

[Chorus]

To show you I changed shawty
I really did change shawty (I'm tellin' you I've changed)
I wanna show you I changed shawty
(i still love you!) [cars peel]

I don't care if the cops got me surrounded
Swat teams whatever, tell 'em to send the hounds in
My mind's in an altered state
Like I'm headed for a wall, top speed, foot off the brake
I make a fool of myself, girl whatever it takes
I already played the fool when I let you escape
You're as, good as it gets, your friendship your sex
Everything about you and yours connects
From your, beautiful smile to the scent of your skin
The sheets smell different, this is not livin'
It feels like dyin', god knows I'm tryin'
Ain't no sight sadder than a grown man cryin'
Please find it in your heart to forgive me
Realize only god can convict me
We all make mistakes, so have you
If god show mercy on me, then you should too

[Chorus]

To show you I changed shawty
I really did change shawty (i'm tellin' you I've changed)

Or passing go twice in monopoly

So why can't I turn off the radio?

Gotta fix that calender I have
That's marked July 15th
Because since there's no more you
There's no more anniversary
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you
And your memory
And how every song reminds me
Of what used to be

I bet Thomas Jefferson would love be E T
This is a celebration all across the land
Light the fireworks, bring out the marching band

Uncle L, I love the heart land
South Carolina, they lookin' so tan
Out in Kansas, they so outlandish
Up in Nebraska, I know whatcha after

Bubble baths and Budweiser, joy and laughter
A good ol' boy that's not tryin' to gas ya

Yea,

Alright
Call the radio and tell 'em this your song 
(This your song, this your song, this your song, this your song)
Girl come on (girl come on, girl come on,)

I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby

Met this little girl, she was off the hook
I got cold chills when her body shook
Hot sex on the platter no need to cook
I let her steal my heart like a horny crook
Had her grinding and winding against my leg
She messin' with my head, wanna play in the bed
Sexy pumps on, toenails red
Your body's a gun baby, pump me full of lead
It hard to hold you when you movin' vulgar
Peace sign on your eyes like John Travolta
My pulp ain't fiction, it's an addiction
To see your booty clap on the floor in the kitchen
Nasty girl, taught me all the lingo
While mama play bingo, she ride Mandingo
She don't give a damn if I'm married or single
She makes me tingle

[Chorus]
Shawty I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby

She likes Hip-Hop and R&B
Her life time goal is to be on TV
She looking for a man that could give her a break
Like Usher or Justin Timberlake
I'm really not sure if her breasts are fake
Cause with whipped cream on em, they taste just like cake
We drink some beer, inside of daddy's '64
She shot me in the back with cupids arrow
We finish the 6-pac, she push the seat back
Pulled up her dress n she let me peep that
I'm Drunk as a skunk, feeling all dirty
Truck stop bathroom at 7:30
Bought her some dessert, give a damn if its early
Head spinnin' around like roller derby
Everything about her says you don't deserve me
I hope I'm worthy

[Chorus]

(Cause I'm your baby)
You need somethin' like me? (Good luck)
Cause he ain't nothin' like me (no)
You can search but you never gone find
A love thats quite like mine (no)
Need a man that can love you good
And treat you like he should
With me shawty you the shit
He might be good but he ain't like this
Cause I'm your baby

In the back of the pickup, clothes the rip up
She see my chrome wheels, it gets more real
Running and laughing, music blasting
Side over the road, bent over crashing
Mouth all dry, can feel the urge
If you see my mama, don't say a word
The cops wanna know I'm a word are slurred
Don't ask me officer ask her
Wanna another drink baby she like sure
Wanna hit the club she like I don't care
She all in the rear-view doin' her here
Hairspray and lip gloss everywhere
This all happens on an average day
Your life is a trip girl, I'm here to stay
Never had a girl make me feel this way
Even tho I had to pay

When I was away look how I wrote to ya girl,
Wasn't I polite when I spoke to ya girl,
Tricked on you cop that coke for you girl,
I'd do anything but go broke for ya girl,
Since I'm a rapper I wrote a song for ya girl,
Since I'm a gun clapper I keep it warm for ya girl,
Lift some weights and keep it hard for ya girl,

Schizophrenia is hard to define,
Life's a mountain for you,I'm ready to climb,
Become the sun for you I shine,

So you can tell them all to wait in line,
Cause a crime of passions still a crime,

I keep it locked don't ever fear,
When it comes to my man I'm a be right here,
Keep it hustle when times are tough,
Never left me stranded it was all about us,
Kept coming home,
Kept running strong,
This love is meant to be life long,

Life is good when it's me and you together,
And when there's drama then I'm a do what ever,
Keep you warm in the stormy cold weather,
Leave you broken and lonely oh never,
Every work that I say is so clever,
When you feel it in your heart it gets you much wetter,
I am the original go getter,
I don't waste time fronting I go get her,
Stare at the devil and won't blink for ya girl,
Change the way that I think for ya girl,
Put it on paper waste the ink for ya girl,
Walk through the dessert without a drink for ya girl,
Central booking, rock pink for ya girl,
Step in quicksand and sink for ya girl,
Whatever the obstacle I'm a leap for ya girl,
End my life and go to sleep for ya girl,

LL Cool J,"""You better stop foolin' if you want to get along with me""
True
""We grew up on the block, and we know about poverty""
Do you?

Dear hip-hop, I apologize for how you've been treated
I should've fought for my culture, instead I retreated
The game is wounded, I stood and watched while they beat it
My culture starved, I refused to feed it
They sold you for a dollar like slaves in iron collars
A*R's chase you with bloodhounds and rottweilers
You went to the highest bidder, you was pissed on like kitty litter
But far from a quitter, but there's somethin' to consider
Nah, after much deliberation
I decided I'm the hottest cat to ever receive rotation
I'm the foundation, one of the chief architects
Of this dream we're all chasin', I had to speak up
Too much time was wastin' whoa! So here we go
I'm tired of the money talk and the, bitches and hoes
Everybody's always, soundin' the same
I have to walk on water I can't, drown in the game

[Chorus: x2]
""Hip-Hop, was set out in the dark""
""Hip-Hop, was set out in the dark""
""Hip-Hop, was set out in the dark""
""They used to do it out in the park""

I remember your bar mitzvah, that burgundy label
Me and Jam Master had the battle of the big cables
Before the Serratos, real vinyls, real tables
Skills was the motto, no hype, no fables
You seemed so happy, you loved me so much
You popped off and went platinum, at my slightest touch
Over sized hoodies, Yukon trucks
20 years later, it's like lightning struck
They're worshipin' the money, they're prayin' to the bank
They danced on slave ship, slept as it sank
The devil made 'em do it, but only God do I thank
Because we aren't done yet, there's still gas in the tank
You look in a man's eyes, that's how you really tell his rank
Not the size of his account, check him, he might bounce
It's all on the line, this time it really counts
I'll bleed for this one, on down to the last ounce

[Chorus]

They rent a crib they're frontin', they rent a car they're stuntin'
They rent a chain they're bluffin', that's why the culture's sufferin'
And even if you're a millionaire that don't mean nothin'
Unless you build your community and encourage some unity
Too much ego, too much posin'
If he's so hot then, why's the culture frozen?
It's time for a change, the order needs to be rearranged
And this song was pre-ordained
After 2 long decades, LL still remains
And you can blame it on my spirit, not on my brains
Time to put on my armor, go to war for the game
Cause it's on its last leg, and that's more than a shame
This is a lifestyle homey, it's more than champagne
But I will make a toast to Flash reachin' the Hall of Fame
I end it with a line, from the book of King James
Let there be light when I write graffiti on the train

[Chorus]

Let us proclaim the mystery and fame
I pray the Lord my culture be saved
If hip-hop dies before I awake

How come I run, you like my son, I blow the whole god damn city up
Inside that long white milky Bentley like I just picked Diddy up

Hop all off then I bounce back, got 'em looking a wolf pack outback

Do it on the floor, stairs to the chair
Do it on the beat, please, hands to stare
Got you on the beach, you out somewhere
Got your girl screaming that it ain't that fair
Baby come true, got enough bread
Switch to the truck, nothing more said
Kid don't play, just do clean
That's what it is, when I come from Queens
Do my lean, big black truck
Coming through like I'm moving that stuff
I just get checks, just get neck

I feel like an addict, you make me fiend
As if you were dancin' on a triple beam
I watch your body move back and forth
That's the shit that make Strahan want a divorce
The move is such a seductive way
I feel like Reg in the bush with Kincaid
Never seen a girl in the world
That moves her body, like you do
Have to party, invitin' you
Wish I could spend my whole life with you
If that's too much just a night with you
Kick back and turn off the lights with you
As long as it's, exciting you
Whatever it is, I like it too

[Chorus]
When I look in your eyes, I fall in love
Girl every time I look at your thighs, I fall in love
You're number one - tell all the guys I fell in love
You make me feel like I won a prize, I'm so in love
That good good love (I'm gonna make you love me)
(I'm gonna make you love me)
(I'm gonna make you love me)
(Love me, love) Stop playin' girl

If I'm victim of circumstance
It's because you're killin' me when you dance
I jump right out of that ambulance
Like B.I.G. I want ""One More Chance""
I got questions, you got the answers
Your body is a ? but you have to master
I'm not your slave but I'm willin' to play
I'll search for oil, start drillin' away
Turn off your iPhone, we chillin' and hey
We'll be sippin' Patron, couple gallons a day
Let's take our clothes off, bombs away
Pick a song, Chris Brown, Ne-Yo or Ray J
To get you in the mood, now you ready to play
Come to my house, put your clothes away
There's no commitment, you don't have to stay
Just come with me, I'll set you free

[Chorus]

What can I do!?
I'm in love with you!
What can I do!?
I'm in love with you! (Stop playin' girl)

The more I look at you, the more I get
Hypnotized, my nature rise
Before your eyes, I know you're sick
Of all the lies and alibis
From other guys, when I'm watchin' you
I get energized, I realize
We need surprise, variety
Is the spice of life, so I eat you up
Like apple pie, I like your flow
You're the star, this is your show
Speed it up, take it slow
Push it out, take it low
That helps a love like this to grow
If you're feelin' me girl let me know
I know that you are respectable
But this type of healin' is sexual

LL Cool J,"Welcome to Exit 13
I am your host
LL Cool J

You said I was finished
And Father Time was the blame
You disrespected my legacy
And threw dirt on my name
Told DJs he's over
He ain't spittin' the same
What he says is irrelevant
Hip-Hop culture has changed
When I walk in the room
Young boys look at me strange
As if I am a relic
From some long forgotten game
It makes my blood boil
Turns my eyes to flames
I built an empire
They tried to kick me out in the rain
So I called on an inner power
It's hard to explain
It's like a holy spirit
Utilizing hip hop slang
I'm beyond the gold grills
And logos on chains
You see I changed rap forever
I elevated the game
Launched the greatest label
In the history of rap
And for twenty four years
I carried it on my back
I've always shined brighter
When I'm under attack
I might be down for a moment
But I always come back

It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war (Uh, yeah)
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war
It's time for war (Check it)
It's time for war

This is a resurrection
I'm back from the dead
They told me quit a long time ago
But I conquered instead
I had dreams and visions
Swirling around in my head
I had this hunger deep inside of me
That has to be fed
Hip hop will respect
All the blood that I shed
I have a covenant with God
I have swallowed the bread
Hip hop my co-defendant
With this mic I thee wed
I made an entire generation
Obey what we said
I'm talkin' France to Germany
From Italy to Japan
From London to Belgium
To Afghanistan
From Farmers Boulevard
Smokin' a blunt with my man
To writin' rhymes on a ironing board
To build Def Jam
You see, I'm the undisputed
King of all hip hop
Everything after is my legacy
Like it or not
And I will keep making history
I can't stop
LL Cool J
Eternally hot

[Chorus]

Look at how easily I flipped it
And switched the style around
Competition losin' their footing
I see them falling down
They will plot against me
It kills them because I'm ballin' now
Some of y'all didn't pick up the phone
But I got you callin' now
This is a job that must get done
Even if I become public enemy number one
If I had to pick up an Uzi
That weighs over a ton
I will attack hip hop
Until competition is none
Nobody on God's earth wants it with L
You end up tortured
And trapped in psychological hell
And this is the beginning
Of a new era in rap
LL Cool J, feel the impact
It's okay if you call it a comeback
And let them know
I'm ready for combat
Tell those dumb motherfuckers to fall back
The crown looks wrong on your head
I want that

Ever since I spied you
In the rooms of my mind
Now I can't deny you
Bleeding and bruised
Like a vagabond in rags
I've walked the streets to your door
To find just what's in store
I see you
You and many others
In your clean well-lighted place
Where I would find disgrace
But I do
Know I'd find contentment
Just to be your furniture
I need nothing more

Crawl beneath the lowest hell

Sick on paper, the inch to penicillin
I told y'all the real, they started catching feelings
Muthafuck 'em all, throw ya L's to the ceiling
Cool J, still hotter than a helicopter crashing in lava
Still sweeter to the ladies than a box of Godiva

Too many Indians, no chiefs to follow
What I'm sowing today, I be reaping tomorrow
So here's some joyful bars, to replace your sorrow
I'm beyond a legend, I'm iconic
Fall off, rebuild, your man's bionic
Put your trust in me, I never let you down
I always come up with a way to checkmate these clowns
I effeminate these clowns, trynna take me down
Ask Puffy and Nas, who 'hates me now'

I'm fresh like a Wii, them niggas playing jacks
They all a bunch of a rats, they copying off 2Pac's stats
Wearing tuxedos to hide they tight speedo
Chains is tucked in, I'm incognito
Fuck with your ego, and touch your girl's labia
There will never be on flyer, LL Cool J
Taking you higher and higher
The wire, the GOAT, the grand sire
Who good at 24's if you want flat tires
Telling your soul and then performing with a choir
People, please, don't listen to these liars
Ladies and gentlemen, these, niggas is selling you up
Bunch of irrelevant shit, it's not intelligent, is it?
My shit's exquisite, don't follow the yellow brick road
Them niggas faking like the Wizard

You can ask my Jay in the shop
Linden Boulevard, little Coupe, big rocks
Real estate only, I ain't fucking with the stocks
Why not, so our grandkids could feed they grandkids
And they grandkids, can feed they damn kids
And Collin Park throw ya hands in the air
Jump before I turn 'em in a Cool J affair
My word is my bond, every summer I'm there
Ya'll can jump double dutch while I'm laying in the cut
I told y'all I wasn't giving up
I told y'all, I can jump on tracks and switch the rhythm up
Do work, treat rap like a ripped skirt
Sow it up, rep your hood, nigga, throw it up
You'd been standing by my side for years
Sold out concerts, screams and cheers
Front row T-Shirt, L, we here
I bought every album, too many to count 'em
Watch your movies, your the only good thing about 'em
Todd Smith jeans, I can't live without 'em
And the only thing I want from you

Speedin' on the highway
Starin' at the white lines we rollin', we rollin' (white lines)

High speed baby!
It's two o'clock in the mornin', I'm stompin' down on the pedal
Look at my ring on the steering wheel and my ice on the bezel
I made a promise to god that I would run from the devil
When the engine is gunnin' I'm on a whole other level
White lines connected, I'm livin' life like a rebel
My competition is chokin' inside my dust when it settle
Baby look at me now, I'm just a kid from the ghetto
But I'm on top of my hustle, I move the bass and the treble
And I go at your generation, I'm runnin' this era
Ain't no lookin' behind me, my system shakin' the mirror
Top speed in the beamer, my head boppin' to ""ether""
I'm on I-95, clutch burnin' the reefer
Everybody that rides with me becomes a believer
Cause I come from the hood, but I think like a caesar
Went from 0 to 60, four deep in the bentley
Hell yeah I be speedin', that's why niggas resent me; ugh!

[Chorus]

Yeah, uh
I said to hell with the past, it's time to live for the future
Make the muffler backfire and pop like a ruger
Don't have the slightest idea 'bout who you ridin' with do ya?
Just keep your eye on the white lines, feel 'em goin' through ya
Between the lines my mind works like a normal computer
My adrenaline's rushin' like I've been dodgin' the shooter
I get surgical on the road every line is a suture
And you must be a operator if niggas dispute ya
Peelin' off in a hurry, there ain't no reason to worry
Anybody that challenges me is gonna get buried
12 cylinders gunnin' the whole world has become a
Grill low to the ground, like a bull when it's runnin'
My Lamborghini is hummin', it sings a tune to your woman
So if you make me slow down, I'm peelin' off wit'cha onion
You need to stop all the frontin' under your hood there ain't nothin'
You know the exit is 13, come see if I'm bluffin'

[Chorus]

Uh!

Exactly! when we in the car we 22'd up
When we in the big truck we 24'd up, y'knahmean?
When you see me ridin', real fast, your job, is to stay back
Pre-bumper, behind the bumper fam! alright?
Do not race in front of me
I should not be able to see, your license plate
That means there's somethin' wrong here

This is the biggest decision I ever made in my life
You do a hundred miles an hour on the highway at night
You go to fasten your seat belt and make sure that it's tight
Because I'm rippin' the paws just like I'm rippin' the mic
Baby I'm pushin' the limits as if I'm racin' a bike
Tell the highway patrol no need to chase me tonight
The way I'm doin' my thang it's like I'm up in a plane
I hit the stick in the rain, I guess I'm sick in the brain
Rocks hittin' the frame, you think the shit is a game
But I'm ready for anybody that steps in my lane
And I know you afraid, no reason to be ashamed
Nobody's crashin' my party I'm mashin' out on these lames
I devoured the cowards and there is no doubt about it
All these niggaz are too gassed, they can't run without it
Tried to give me a flat tire, I wouldn't allow it
I left y'all in the dust nigga, I'm too high-powered!

[Chorus]

Exactly! when you see us, fast lane middle lane slow lane
It's all the same thing y'knahmean? we go fast
We got a lot of big wheels on our cars, it's what we do
Aight? when you see us, you salute the kingpins, the generals
That's us, y'knahmean?
And matter of fact, we gon' jump off the bridge right now
When you see l, this joint's in fuckin' effect!
I've been dyin' to say that!
I've been dyin' to say that, eighty-six nigga!
You know what it is man, first album
Ten million, no fuckin video, yo ll was there!
I warn you! you gotta stop!
There's too many questions and not enough answers
Too many questions, mind your business knahmean?
This is grown shit right here, aight?
When you see us, we do this for a living
I've been doin' this for a fuckin' minute!
Yo I've been dyin' to talk crazy on a l record

Clap ya hands and to the beat, y'all
Because the heat'll make you, clap ya hands and say
You go the one for the cash, two for the safe
(This is ring tone murder) Let's dog the place

My bars are like a bullet, blow your head right off
Hate on the trigger, pull it, give your mouth a night off
Give your sound man a c-note to cut your mic off
The promoters need me, nigga, you just a write-off
After that, hit the dress room, turn the lights off
Score on the fourth broad, let her break my pipe off
I used the word 'off' seven times in a rhyme
You dumb enough to think I got a limited mind
But before you start tweaking, critiquing, pressing rewind
Einstein understand, that your third eye's blind
You lack creativity, that's why you don't sign
They calling me a genius, it's about time
I'm like the tattoos on your mama's behind
I bounce up and down, and at the end I'mma sign
And I will humiliate anybody that want it
I'm back on stop, it hurts little homey, don't it?

It's obvious these clowns don't know who I am
Most who didn't get the message, nigga, check the spam
Get your facts right, take your dick out your hand
No homo, but you probably on the low-low, damn
They call Uncle L, I'm from the north side of Queens
Now you looking at me, like what does that mean
It means I crush you and every coward in between
For sounding like girls with them sweet sixteens
And I don't give a fuck about who's old or young
From what I hear, the graveyard got room for everyone
Test Big Ellie, come and get your head sprung
Which coffin you want, the blue or the red one?
I ain't gang banging, that ain't the motherfuckin' point
The point is, I spark these niggas like dust joints
The point is you gon' pay me what you owe me plus points
Listen to the sound of revenge, it's my voice

[Chorus]

Run around talking bout I'm twice ya age
But I was rich at 17, you got some shit to explain
Rap game's like a movie, niggas playing the role
But your poker game's too weak, you're forced to fold
All this hating and debating shit, made me cold
Ready to blast, separate ya body from your soul
Conniving ass cowards get dropped in a hole
These niggas is shook like Pinky's ass on the pole
I'm the bridge over troubled water, pay my toll
I'm the rules to the game, you obey my code
I'm the center of the bomb, I'm the part that explodes
You are not hip hop, nigga, go write for Vogue
You are not a king nor prince, you just a toad

V.I.P. locked down, crackin' them hundred dollar bills
Yankee hat low
""Todd Smith"" in rhinestones
Your chick chose him, let bygones be bygones
All these amateur macs with' they're eyeballs watery
Choosin' honeys over money that's how it oughta' be
Meanwhile, he gets his statements quarterly
You're starvin' on the corner actin' drunk and disorderly
Relax in the Maybach gettin' your booze on
Seats is like a couch, get your Tom Cruise on
French pedicure with' the Chimmy Choos on
He wanna' see more he throw somethin' smooth on
The modern day Goldie
Game better than Coby
Style, doper than Codeine
Playin' for his own team
When he walk up in the spot he lookin' so clean
Rubbin' money in your face like cold cream

Let's get it poppin'
They like this boy rotten
I'm like I better pick ? then pick cotton
And sometimes gotta see cats to blow
I was blessed with that twenty/twenty vision fa sho'
See its twenty mil a year twenty years in a row
First twenty mil came when I was twenty years old
I average right around twenty% on my dough
Fast forward twenty years then compare my flow
Difference is I own mine and you still owe
Slackin' in your mackin' can't save a hoe
Speculatin' at the bar over mohetoe
Like I betchya fall off, oh no he won't
So I so spit better, oh no he don't
Under twenty ass fifty if you feelin' to go 
Over thirty ass Rakim I ain't no joke
I'm dirty his jaws drop off wicked and went

Still bangin' both, still hangin'
Look like a, thank god its still rainin'
I'm light on my feet, you can't judge me by the weigh-in
It's hard to grasp some of the shit I be sayin'
It fly's over your head like a second string is
You can't comprehend me 
You couldn't place a decimal on the paper I'm makin'
Fly man can't appreciate on castles creation
No wonder y'all keep hatin'
Is L really ? young boy's debatin'
You play johnny ? I'll keep on cakin'
You can't compare me to them line for line
I'm beyond that I represent ? of time

I'll be relevant forever, get it through your mind
Just watch me

Fuckin' punk, get a speed bump comin' through
A single shot make your knees knock, respect Wu

Ayo I put it on a nigga, shit it on a nigga
Turnin' Christian to a certified sinner
The bomb I release, time pent up (explodes)
While you got set up I was hittin' your ex hoe
Shit I kept low, petro' your metro
Politic, keep the chicken heads gobblin'
Shit I'm drivin' in, come with funk halogen
Terrorize your city, from the spliff committee
Kick ass till both Timberlands turn shitty
Gritty, smack the driver's head in the chin see
When I approach rappers be takin' notes
I drop like I shoulda invented the raincoat
Absolut, I love to burn to the roots
I keep comin' til your pour sperm from your boots
Vigilante hardcore to the penis
Tell you fuck you my attitude is anemic

I'm the illest nigga alive, watch me prove it
I snatch your crown witcha head still attached to it
Canibus is the type who'll fight for mics
Beatin' niggas to death and beatin' dead niggas to life
When you look at me long enough, I start to read your thoughts
If the signal was strong enough, and then I'll call your bluff
Like, ""Yo, how many rhymes you got?"" I think I'll go on
For more Millenniums than Mazda's got on the car lot
And there's nowhere to run ta, when I confront ya
Nigga, I call your bluff like you had a phone number
Who want to see Canibus get wild, who want to act fly and
Get shot down with a surface-to-air missile
I take em on in all shapes sizes and forms and spit on
Anybody who ain't close enough to shit on
Zero to sixty? I'm already doin' a hundred
When I'm blunted and I give it to any nigga that want it

Stay out the dark, cause if I catch you when the sun is down
Run it clown, come up off that, or I'm gon' gun it down
When in doubt, however skull goes, it's gon' be that
See that, that shit'll finish you dog, believe that
Where we at, do your value your life, as much as your possessions?
Don't be a stupid nigga, learn a lesson
I'm gon' get you either way, and it's better to live
Let me get what's between your sock, cause it's, better to give
Than receive, believe what I say when I tell you
Don't make me put your somewhere where nobody'll smell you
And when the lights is out, they don't come back on
This ain't a flick you ain't gon' come back on, you ain't that strong
You knew it was wrong, but you asked for it baby
You'se a pink nigga, ski mask for it baby
So I can hit you up on front teeth, you think I'm sweet?
Want heat? One deep, leave him behind, front seat

When young sons fantasize of borrowing flows
Tell little shorty with the big mouth the bank is closed (yeah, word up)
The symbol on my arm is off limits to challengers
You hold the rusty swords I swing the Excalibur
How dare you step up in my dimension
Your little ass should be somewhere cryin' on detention
Watch your mouth better yet hold your tongue
I'm a do this shit for free this time this one's for fun
Blow you to pieces, leave you covered in feces
With one thesis (""LL Cool J is hard"")
Every little boy want to pick up the mic
And try to run with the big boys and live up to the real hype
But that's like pickin' up a ball, playin' with Mike
Swingin' at Ken Griffey or challengin' Roy to a fight
Snappin', you amateur MC's
Don't you know I'm like the Dream Team tourin' overseas
For rappers in my circle I'm a deadly disease
Ringmaster, bringin a tiger cub to his knees (uh)
In the history of rap they've never seen such prominence
Your naive confidence gets crushed by my dominance (word up)
Now let's get back to this mic on my arm
If it ever left my side it'd transform into a time bomb
You don't want to borrow that, you want to idolize
And you don't want to make me mad nigga you want to socialize
And I'm daring every MC in the game
To play yourself out position, and mention my name
I make a rhyme for every syllable in your name
Go platinum for every time your grimy ass was on the train
Watch your mouth don't ever step out of line

People spread gossip and believe what they must
But I slam dunk and make 'em bite the dust
A minute is needed to make a phony roni bleed
And put him in a bucket like it's chicken feed
Check out the pick of the litter, not a quitter, I'm nice
And I'ma dust you off and dust you off twice

You never heard this so observant all hysterical fan
Natics of the Asiatic Miracle Man
Prominent, dominant, McCoy and I'm Real
Another brother's fan? Forget how you feel
He's so so, I got the instinct, they call me Deputy Dog

Now I'ma do ya while the party people watch
You're real funny, you really try to go for yours

How you gonna go against an army with a handgun?

Your grip's too weak, you can't hold it, be
You can dream of makin' progress and gettin' this nice
But when I roll up, it's like Hip Hop Vice
Serve the curbs, I never swerve I'm superb

Played your hand, lost track of your plan
When I show up, I blow up, end of story, my man

Oh me? My name is L
First of all you a banger, straight up and down
I'm seein minks on your hangers
I know your momma told you don't talk to strangers
That leads to dangerous situations, but I can't be patient
You need communication, appreciation
Respect for your style instead of talkin all wild
One smile, you're daydreamin of walkin the aisle
In the waterbed, rollin around in a money pile
Baby my format is not to be a doormat
But I still pull your chair out at the table and all that
Touch your back softly, whatever it cost me
Time money or energy, you will remember me

Gotta change my answering machine, now that I'm alone
'Cause right now it says that we, can't come to the phone
And I know it makes no sense, cause you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice, anymore
(It's ridiculous) It's been months, and for some reason I just
(Can't get over us) And I'm stronger than this
(Enough is enough) No more walkin 'round with my head down
I'm so over bein blue, cryin over you; and

I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears
So done with wishin, you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

Gotta fix that calendar I have, that's marked July 15th
Because since there's no more you, there's no more anniversary
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you, and your memory
And how every song reminds me of what used to be; that's the reason

I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears
So done with wishin, you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

(Leave me alone) Leave me alone
(Stupid love songs) Don't make me think about her smile
Or having my first child
I'm lettin go, turnin off the radio

I'mma keep you equipped in all of the best whips
Pay attention to detail, even your lipstick
Give compliments when your pedicure switch
When we on the mattress, you won't care if I'm rich
I'll love you deeply, whisper sweetly
Even when you critique me, you can still reach me
Beats me why you sweeter than a peach be
One bite's enough sugar for the whole night
You'll be aight, you rollin with the Elvis of rap
C'mon, move your pelvis and throw it back
I know it's forward and it sounds a little blunt
But love money respect, whatever, pick what you want

That's the reason

'Cause you already know the answer
Keep it between these sheets

Ah ah yeah

I won't tell nobody baby, you can trust me
You swearin' that it's good, I'm thinkin' it must be
I'm kissin' on your thighs, relax, don't rush me
Let me take my time, make your pretty face ugly
Hands by your side, stop tryin' to touch me
Let me soak it in, breathe, you smellin' lovely
Kiss yo belly button, and fill it with bubbly
Take a taste, let it drip down your waste
Have it all over my face, outer body experience like you're floating out of space
Come back down gently
Grind your hips on me, you set with the melody
And let the words that I say live on in your memory

I'm a tell you a lil secret
Do you think you could keep it?
Keep it between these sheets
Keep it between these sheets aha
Baby, no need to ask questions
'Cause you already know the answer
Keep it between these sheets

Ah ah yeah

Eye contact, kiss me, I kiss back
Right there, I miss that, I can't resist that
And I'll be climbing up over walls and ignoring all of my calls
Stuff all the things, pause, 'cause you're giving me your all
But I never had a lover make me feel this real
Hold it up in the room, all night, all day
All week I'm strung out like a freak
Got me tapping on my arm for a fix
In-between your sheets
Work you out to this beat, it's just you and me in the suite
My tongue is all on your feet, sheets covering me
I'm kissing all that I see, exactly how it should be

I’mma love it, boy, I won’t you stop 
(you don’t stop) 
Bring it closer and closer 

You was reminiscing and wishin' 
For L to deliver what the game’s been missin' 
Beast that knock rhymes that lock with precision 
Hot like when Pac first popped out of prison 
Two schools of thought headed for a collision 
Did it big for a minute then you lost yo vision 
Skinny jeans, a wedgy and a dance rendition 
Tycoons wouldn’t choose that mission 
These cats is all hyped, that‘s why I don’t listen 
I’m too tank fittin' right, I see yall slippin' 
Ain’t no hate love, nah I ain’t trippin' 
Still love jewelry and champagne sippin' 
Bank roll healthy, ice is still sickening 
Couldn’t get fresh if you broke up, get slicking 
We Diddy bop, y'all out here skippin'
Baby just ignore these fools, they trippin'

Bishop Lamont, need to give em a sermon 
How soon we forget when the chrome is turnin' 
Models in the backseat burnin' 
But even if I wasn’t LL Cool J 
I had the same girl that I have today 
And that’s not something most of these cats could say 
Your whole hand’s different than you’re payin' a mistake 
Now some of y'all gonna feel some kind of weight 
That’s yo prop in which you, you know how we play 
Grown, we’re the bad, grinding all day 
Fool, you got a edge when you take that away baby 
The moment of truth and the jacuzz on 
Like that news, play some rhythm and blues 
Worry bout the water baby, leave on your shoes 
Toast to the gold, my heart don’t lose 

Give it up 
I’mma love it, boy, I won’t you stop

LL grown up man 
Couldn’t give a damn if a young boy’s my fan 
Long as his mama 2 step to my jam 
While she cleanin' up her house, mop in her hand 
It’s how I changed the game, now you understand? 
I got that old money, weak rubber bands 
Cats playin' themselves, getting out of hand 
Show two features to chase teenage fans 
Well I got it right, I cram to understand 
How you trendy shorty, L’s a brand 
Raised on hip-hop, the grownup fans 
Hands in the air, rocking in a stance 
I’ve been made, ain’t no making of the bands 
Save the techno and glow sticks for Disneyland 
I’m sayin 5 features on every other jam 
You like them? Listen to em, we don’t give a damn 

Give it up 
I’mma love it, boy, I won’t you stop

Honestly, I'm afraid to give love
Deep down I'm afraid to be judged
That's why I pull back, don't speak no rap
Put on the beat, man every time we hug
It's deep, I'm afraid of heartbreak so much
The thought alone feels like my soul got cut

Life is a desert and for love I'm thirsty
You lead me to the water, I'm afraid to drink
You hand me a glass, still don't know what to think
Your love is terrifying, I'm standing on the brink
I'm floating in your eyes then I start to sink
Girl, I never knew that I could feel so weak
Flying on a cloud in-between these sheets
I'm one with myself, why do I retreat?
It's a battle just to try to go to sleep

Everybody knows that falling in love's easy, timing out's hard
So I only wasn't really, raise my thoughts as God
It's crazy, I hold you in the highest regard
But us having true love? What's the odds?
That's scary, what if I get hit that hard
So hard I can't get up, heart got lit up
Too weak to move, can't eat, no sit up
Mommy used to say – don't worry, it's just a hiccup
But even she can't help
When your heart's on fire, about to melt
So everything I really feel, I keep it to myself
So I don't end up hurt like everybody else
Took love off the bat, burn I put it on the shelf
With the books I never read about pain I never felt
Love is a problem, baby I need help
My card's on the table and my heart's breaking me up

Give me love
I swear all I need is your heart (I swear)

It was the best of times, it was the worst of times
When the last chapter's done, I hope your mine

I know you had some problems but I'm here now
You'll never be alone long as I'm around

So I kick up the pieces, erase your frown
And I show my true colors when we paint the town
I hate to hear you cry, I don't like the sound
So my love is turned up, sheets get turned down
I know it hurts now, the drama's the worst now
It's forth in a hundred but love's a first down
A quarterback to come back right now
When a hail Mary works the world, it's like wow
You down for the count, I ain't having it baby
They can all go to hell, I know they callin me crazy
But you're my sunshine when the world gets shady

Turn yo back on it and the sun still shines
Grapes get old and they turn into wine
The deeper the roots, the stronger the vines
These lines on my face just a sign of the times
You could cry on my shoulder if you're inclined
I used to be a Casanova in the lunch room line
That is more important things occupying my mind
Like being there for you, breathing the air for you
Keep trust false and truth to dare for you
The weight of the world I'm prepared to bear for you
The haters get cynical and call you spoiled
Not knowing about the drama in which you embroiled
The numerous pit falls, the tussle and the toil
The farmer still want me to put seeds in the soil
And here comes the harvest, this part's the hardest
I'm still here in darkness

We came to party, we came to party
Hey look, I've got my hands all on your body

Ain’t no problem, I’m on it oldest man in the club
Also one of the richest, a hundred bottles of bub
It’s just me and the Russians, we get all of the love
They was aware of the image, they wanna see what he does
TMZ in my face, Oprah all on my couch
Now I’m hosting the Grammys, what is this all about?
International baller, I must admit I had doubts
If they wasn’t callin’ me back, they was callin’ me out
Game moved to the South, I just closed my mouth
Intellect like Belichick when he be switching the routes
I’m too old for the games, no time for the lames
Next challenge? Get this generation screaming my name
Who could do what I did? Boy, I must be the shit

People texting my wife, tryna ruin my night
So I help ‘em mind they business with some bottles on ice

Ice so cold you can see it through the fog

And if you step by the pockets, you gon’ be up in the morgue
The peoples is peepin’, peepin’
The bitches is dippin’, dippin’
So this is the mission, listen, I turn this shit up
It’s the party-rocking, nonstopping, four-hopping, rip and rock
Drippin’ in this motherfucker, burn up, now turn up!

We ain’t flirtin’, we talkin’ – we ain’t dancin’, we walkin’
Teenagers is pointin’, couple cougars are hawkin’
I don’t come here that often, but it’s totally awesome
When you livin’ for real, I don’t consider it flossin’
Panty lines are crossin’, I’m proceedin’ with caution
I don’t shit where I eat, gotta manage your portions
LL Cool J, I’m like the old-school orphan
Representing alone, sittin’ on factory chrome
Shades on, in the zone – Kool Aid smile on my face
My security’s strapped, ain’t no beef, just in case
Me and my man Rich Whites, we in Vegas tonight
Claudine on the celly, make sure that money is right
Red carpet and tuxes, always where the bucks is
Paparazzi are snapping, I can’t believe this is happening
Frustrating the haters, they’re so sick of me rapping
I’m enjoying your blog, I’ve got the same type of passion

You can't take my God from inside of me
Crosses up, light up the sky with me
I got a lot of crazy crazy on my mind
Like what's the real reason that the pope resigned?
I got Van Halen, I don't need a bassline
I knew we can do it, it was just a matter of time
Put the axels back on the street and break on the vine
I came back to take back everything that was mine

LL Cool J,"To the man that waited on me at the Starbucks down on Main, I hope you understand
When I put on that t-shirt, the only thing I meant to say is I'm a Skynyrd fan
The red flag on my chest somehow is like the elephant in the corner of the south
And I just walked him right in the room
Just a proud rebel son with an ‘ol can of worms
Lookin' like I got a lot to learn but from my point of view

I'm just a white man comin' to you from the southland
Tryin' to understand what it's like not to be
I'm proud of where I'm from but not everything we've done
And it ain't like you and me can re-write history
Our generation didn't start this nation
We're still pickin' up the pieces, walkin' on eggshells, fightin' over yesterday
And caught between southern pride and southern blame

They called it Reconstruction, fixed the buildings, dried some tears
We're still siftin' through the rubble after a hundred-fifty years
I try to put myself in your shoes and that's a good place to begin
But it ain't like I can walk a mile in someone else's skin

‘Cause I'm a white man livin' in the southland
Just like you I'm more than what you see
I'm proud of where I'm from but not everything we've done
And it ain't like you and me can re-write history
Our generation didn't start this nation
And we're still paying for the mistakes
That a bunch of folks made long before we came
And caught between southern pride and southern blame

Dear Mr. White Man, I wish you understood
What the world is really like when you're livin' in the hood
Just because my pants are saggin' doesn't mean I'm up to no good
You should try to get to know me, I really wish you would
Now my chains are gold but I'm still misunderstood
I wasn't there when Sherman's March turned the south into firewood
I want you to get paid but be a slave I never could
Feel like a new fangled Django, dodgin' invisible white hoods
So when I see that white cowboy hat, I'm thinkin' it's not all good
I guess we're both guilty of judgin' the cover not the book
I'd love to buy you a beer, conversate and clear the air
But I see that red flag and I think you wish I wasn't here

I'm just a white man
(If you don't judge my do-rag)
Comin' to you from the southland
(I won't judge your red flag)
Tryin' to understand what it's like not to be

I'm proud of where I'm from
(If you don't judge my gold chains)
But not everything we've done
(I'll forget the iron chains)
It ain't like you and me can re-write history
(Can't re-write history baby)

Oh, Dixieland
(The relationship between the Mason-Dixon needs some fixin')
I hope you understand what this is all about
(Quite frankly I'm a black Yankee but I've been thinkin' about this lately)
I'm a son of the new south

And I just want to make things right

Llaneros de Guamuchil,"En una mesa señores
Perdí lo que mas quería
Era una medalla de oro
Que me dio mi madre un día
La cambie por un tequila
Malagrada suerte mía.

Un domingo en la mañana
Un amigo me avisaba
Que la mujer que yo amaba
Con otro hombre se casaba
Me diriji a una cantina
A ver si hay la olvidaba.

Serian las 11 o las 12
O las dos de la mañana
Borracho y ya sin dinero
La sinfo no la tocaba
Me desprendí la medalla
Era lo que me quedaba.
Dicen que yo llegue al baile
Cuando mi Aurora rayaba
Al ver en brazos de otro hombre
A la mujer que yo amaba
Le descargue la pistola
Cuando de mi se burlaba
Por eso tras de las rejas
Al cielo perdón imploro
Matarla no me arrepiento
Aunque fue mi gran tesoro
Lo que lloro y lo que siento
Es la medallita de oro.",La Medallita de Oro,2008
Llew Hird,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1995
Llewellyn,"Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you

So then I took my turn
Oh what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow

Llewellyn,"Consider this a sign.
This is a train in the night
And now it's time for you to go
You know you've had a healthy life, boy.

You walk this world like you're a ghost
Your hands are coming through the needles
Sick of your tragic and the evils
I am the keeper of the songs of everyone

Look into the sun and see your soul is dying
Used to feel the faith, but now you're tired of trying
Should have left alone what you have stolen from everyone
How are you feeling?
Seem a little sick to me now

This is a coming of the times
You are a witness to the movement

If all you're seeing is your lies
You had your chance, but now you've blown it.
You want this world so you can own it
I am the keeper of the songs of everyone

Look into the sun and see your soul is dying
Used to feel the faith, but now you're tired of trying
Should have left alone what you have stolen from everyone

How are you feeling?
You seem a little sick to me

From the light on high
A chance to change your fate
Forgiveness falling down
On those who chose to wait
Remember the time
Find yourself home again
Deep within your life
Find yourself a home again find yourself home again
It's a choice
You have chosen your own

In the old days
When the world was young and bright 
If you raise the mask, who will lead us home tonight

Look into the sun and see your soul is dying
Used to feel the faith, but now you're tired of trying
Should have left alone what you have stolen from everyone

I'm invisible to the naked eye
I'm apart of everything you're doin'
I'm apart of you down deep inside

I'm the part that sings those goofy love songs
I'm the part of you you can't control
I'm the part that fucked up your promotion
I'm the part that hurts when you're alone

On this beautiful night
By the bright Disco light
We will dance till the pain is all gone

If love is alive why can't I touch it?
Does it feel like Jello or a fire?
I could tell by te taste it was not poison
But is sure did mess up my insides

There's nothing else like you on my planet
You see me now in my true form
I did not come here ina Spaceship
I came the moment you were born

And do it one more time

Baby, feeling of me thinking about you is driving me crazy
'Cause I just wanna give you all this love
And I hate it
When I have to wait oh baby I'm tryna be patient
But my heart is in a rush
I want you, I need you
Right now, baby right now
I can't do, without you
Na nah, baby I'm so gone, girl I

Girl I think I'm falling, and I don't wanna get up
And even if I'm dreaming, I don't wanna wake up
Tell me can I have you baby, 365 oh yeah
Coz everytime we touch, I be in a trance and I just wanna do it again
Oh baby can we do it again
Oh baby can we do it again

You make me wanna do it again
Wake up in the morning yeah do it again
Sweatin' by your job at lunch break you in
And let you know what you gonna give when you get home
Baby we can lead our lives on
(If you wanna) Make our own movie on your phone
(If you wanna) How about one more time for the road
If you wanna, you wanna, yeah yeah you wanna

Ain't nothin' but the street life
That's money cars and hoes
It's the only life I chose
Street life , nothin' but the street life
They love they way I shine
This world is mine, all mine

[Rick Ross]
Up early in the morning, got gold in my eye
Got a 4-5 that'll leave a hole in the sky
Sitting at this table, why, to take this 
Music and the street life that's a whole 'nother side (right)
Hoes used to call me small time
My clothes ain't know what to call mine
No logos or no tags in it
No polos 'til I started bag-gin' it
Way before my first key
My nigga E showed me
How to parlay a Z (good lookin' nigga)
I know my mama pullin' overtime
Pocket full of dimes
So I'm out here pullin' mine

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
You can't close shop, not on my block
I'm 24/7 like IHOP
Came from the bottom to the skybox
Now a penthouse, you can call me Hi-Top
Hop up in the 40-40, got 'bout forty on me
Fifty grand in a band, I'ma roll it homie
Brick layin' cost 'bout another dub
Ten grand for a pound of the bubble bud
Twenty birds in a room down in Atlanta
I caught a bird, but the birds can't buy a camper
Just an example, by an ex-trapper
Dress the coupe in the shoes, now that's dapper

Street life, sellin' dope, fuckin' hoes
Big E, smoke comin' outta nigga nose
Candy paintin' on the corner, sellin' everything
I'm on the move, I ain't called mama in a couple days
This life and nothin' will ever change that
I love the game and we'll never give the game back
We lost a lot of good niggas in the game
But in the game, all the good niggas get a name
I got a name, everybody don't die the same
Like all dope don't fly the same
M-I-Yayo, boy I buy them things
It's like the people want me to come fly the plane

Tryin' to show you somethin', shorty
Hey, baby girl, they say the world is a beautiful place, that's right
I'm tryin' to help you open yo' eyes and see that
Ha ha, this some shit, cool shit, real playa like

[Chorus:]
Hey, shorty, we can do it real playa like
We can go a few places that you say you like
See what a day is like when you be my a-alike
Girl, just lay back, I'll do it the way you like
(Said, it's the flyest thing, just the way we swing)
(Me and you, how we do, be so fly)

[Fabolous]
You need to leave them burgers alone and make a steak upgrade
I'm fillet mignon with a tape-up fade
I see things clear through these Mark Jacob shades
Like the clarity in these jewels that Jacob made
You sleep better knowin' you gon' wake up paid
Hairstyled, nails filed, makeup made
We can shock South Beach, shake up Dade
In a drop top Phantom with the Drakov blades
I'm a stop by the barber; you can hit the shops in the harbor
Then get the chops or the lobster
Prime on twelve, dinner for dos
We begin with a toast, end with a dose
Of the light green cheeba, rolled in a cohiba
It's Sunday, so you know the Forge is
Weather gorgeous, not a cloud in the sky
We can show the world how to be fly, yes

[Chorus]

[Fabolous]
If you want to act Hollywood, fine; but, shorty, let's do it
When we sittin' on the hills like the Hollywood sign
And every man lies, but not every man flies
Privately to Van Nuys
Range on the runway, driver to pop doors
Straight to Barney's, somethin' we need to stop for
She like, ""It's early, what we gonna shop for?""
How 'bout green grass breakfast, top floor
Later on Fred C, or Max Fields
Real playa like dress, good black heels
No 'Hanas, we can do Katana's
You, me, and ooo-wee marijuana
Then slide through Hyde, might include Mood
Maybe go to Area, if it's in the area
The Friday's young, try things my way, hun
Malibu ride, highway one

[Lloyd]
Nothing is too much, everything you touch turns to gold
You make me better (you make me better)
I'm fly as I can be, but when you're with me
I can't help but notice I'm more focused (but you're the coldest)
Girl, you are so...

[Fabolous]
Hey, shorty
Bring the Maybach, we got a long way to go
Just lay back; you had a long day, I know
And they whack, do it the wrong way, I know
I play back but have the song playin' low
While we six-deuce and let you fix Goose
In a glass with some ice, maybe mix juice in
On the way to L.I., well I, could a took the hell-eye
But we do more behind wheel
Hampton home, two floors, for nine mill'
Real playa like, two doors from Seinfeld
White marble, new floors that shine still
And the help keep food stored, wine chilled
Hey, you gotta live one day, right? (Right)
Well, how 'bout from Friday to Sunday night?
Then back 'fore they notice back up in Lotus
Let the world know we back and we focused

[Chorus]",Real Playa Like,2007
Lloyd,"I'm sick and tired of lyin' here and thinkin'
With informercials sinkin' in
And I can't find my remore
I won't accept the terms of this surrender
'Cause there is something bigger
And I feel it here today

I can't just stand around and wait for somethin'
'Cause I know there is nothing here that I know I can believe
There's a lady on the television telling me
That I can find my destiny if I look up to the stars
But I can see that it's right in front of me
It's here and it's clear

[chorus]
I don't wanna know if the world will end tomorrow
'Cause I feel just fine
I don't wanna know all the answers on this earth
All I need to know is that You're always right there
That's all I need to know

Well I know they say they've figured out the questions
But it's hardly ever mentioned that they always change their minds
The psychics on the phone are always selling me
The future they can see for me, well they can sell to someone else
'Cause I can see that it's right in front of me
It's here and it's clear

[chorus]

Everything we kow is nothing more than drops into an ocean

You're the only thing that never fades away

See a nigga like me gonna get money till I get rich
Ride with a couple hundred G's in a biscuit
Stay down for whatever forever hustle with my mystic hoes
And soon you gonna see just how crunk this shit be once we get rich
Till then it's back to hustlin' with my misfits
Deep, on a creep, fifty songs tucked under the prone
Fifty songs tucked under the prone

I keep a big old nigga beater heater
It's in the trunk of my four-door and my two seater
I'm make them say skeeter skeeter
Keep up and grab the ball back just like I'm Derek Jeter
I know you want to fuck my hoe but you too scared to meet her
See you ain't got enough bread to even start to treat her
The way a pimp did, and in the bed I'm even sweeter
I hustle, I got more Franklins in me than Aretha
If I had Oprah Winfrey I would marry her and keep her
I spit as much knowledge as preachers and teachers
Just as long as the message reach us we all fill up the bleachers
I'm the MJG, I get in yo' shit
I ain't trying to run yo' clique, that be your friend so quick
Come on, where my money, let me hit the stage
Fuck them long interviews, just give us the front page
Black G apostrophe S us, forever bust
Them lyrics that make the people say that he got nuts

Sticky weed kickin in, big Ball steppin in
Straight flying when I hustle, that's how I represent
Bounce, if you feelin what I'm spitting up in your ear hole
I been rocking mics since I was seventeen years old
Smoking up, drinking up, kicking dust, and fucking up
Everybody want a piece and we ain't got enough for us
Yeah, I touched a brick or two, pounds I done smoked a few
Got my bread and didn't do what the fuck I was supposed to do
Money blinds players, turns them into evil spirits
Niggaz die trying to live out these old rap lyrics
I try to give it to them just how it come to me
Real and unedited, not like it be on T.V
Be myself and don't be what those haters want me to be
Take the good the bad hit my knees set me free
Make the bad good, put that on my leather and wood
Cinderella with my fellas deep off in the hood
Nigga

See a nigga like me gonna get money till I get rich
Ride with a couple hundred G's in a biscuit
Stay down for whatever forever hustle with my mystic hoes
And soon you gonna see just how crunk this shit be once we get rich
Till then it's back to hustlin' with my misfit's
Deep, on a creep, fifty songs tucked under the prone
Fifty songs tucked under the prone

You need to stop sticking your hand out and trying to (?)
Turn around the broom handle and trying to hold it
It's plenty dirt to be swept, and leaves to be raked
Now you need to leave from my face, take heed to mistake
That you just made, thinking a player could get played
Thinking that a rapper could get wrapped and phone tapped
My whole life I learned the hard way to spot liars
And it seems like it's usually the ones that's right by ya

Jumping up out the tip with pistols sittin' up

Then come out the back of your head, now your just a memory
Graphic how I got it illustrated, rated triple X

Just watch your mouth, talkin' down in the south

Umm hey
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from
Oh yea
Oh yea

Kids get killed in ghettos, shot up over their carmelo's
While they mom was at home, tears hittin' the pillow
Reverend in the middle of a sermon and funereal
Shed a tear 'cause they lost a son the same way a year ago
It's the same ego spiritual, we thuggin' in harmony
They say death brings life, there exchange no robbery
If I'm wrong then pardon me, I'm just tired of poverty
Why them niggas in the hood never hit the lottery
Unless they go lottery, first round in the draft
First we dustin' off the rounds and we slip in the mag'
Then slip on the masks, and go out and mash
And we call it feeding our family, ya'll call it a tragedy, damn
How I could just kill a man
Watch his blood flow like a river and rinse his blood off of my hand
If you hearing me speak please lord give me a chance
And forgive for my sins, 'cause we cleansed where I'm from

Me and my niggas ride even when the sun don't shine and it's cold outside
I never run in or hide, 'cause some niggas hate it
But I can't be fadin' 'cause I done made it
Instead of struggling, just strive
Find my way out these ghetto streets of mine
This is coming from where I'm from (I'm from)
We all walk back in line

Everybody know that everybody said nobody can hide from beef
Except but us, who surprised when these kids get killed on the streets
Look how these animals eat that's how they talk bout us
While they shed they joke and laugh puttin a choke round us
Can I get a moment of silence
'Cause they claimin' it's the murderers that's causing all the violence
But what about the ones that protect to serve our honor
Poppin' that blue colla', with shots soon to follow
The ghettos in horror, 'cause in this boy shot went back
And now the neighborhood's hot and he can't move the crack
When it's all about the dollars
And he'll individually get murdered 'cause money is power
But then these snitch's get to talking and it's colder than ours
Cuffed and crimed on the bus heading straight to the island
He was only thirteen, but tried as an adult in the highest of courts
Because ain't no more children in the ghetto where I'm from

This is coming from where I'm from, I'm from
We all walk back in line (yeah)

We ain't all killers in prison
Matter fact that's a stereotypical thought of livin'
'Cause they don't know about the hood and them love in it
Summer time top down with the wood finish
Pushin' hard uptown windows slightly tinted
Back to back Benz' and Jeeps, blowin' weed with my niggas
On our way to a house party, gonna fuck with some bitches
Let's get some liquor for shorty who said she make us some chicken
And if we get 'em drunk enough we probably could freak 'em
And do it every other weekend
If I don't have to kill niggas, I never would leave the ghetto
I'm like an angel that put on a halo
Cradle the grave of my niggas that we lost in the ghetto
'Cause where I'm from in the ghetto we rock white tee's and Nike's
Roll three dice and name our dope ice cream
Set trends and ya'll follow our lead
But in New Yitti niggas follow they dreams, where I'm from

Me and my niggas ride even when the sun don't shine and it's cold outside

But if I should die before I wake
Pray for the Lord, my soul to take yeah

Nobody cares
Trouble's like a cancer, you gotta get it early
You don't get it early it gets to big, it kills you
Nobody cares

That's why you gotta cut it out
Nobody cares
Capeesh
Worry about yourself, your family, and people that are important to you

Let me tell you something
When your alone late at night in the bed
Just you and her under the covers
You're only allowed three great women in your life

(Is it better to be loved or feared?)
They come along like the great fighters, once every ten years
Nobody cares (That's a good question
it's nice to be both but it'd be very difficult)

That's it, capeesh
(If I had my choice I'd rather be feared, see fear last longer than love)
Don't forget where you came from

To take this ride with me
To see the top of the globe
Courtesy of Murder I-N-see's

Provided privacy
Nobody'll know
Yeah I know I brought the mob with me
'Cause obviously

A lot of niggaz snitch on the low
Just open your eyes
And see all these blind lies he done told
I realize how niggaz fantasize

And the unreal truth gets sold to the youth
While others try to provide their souls to the booth
Fuck that, I'm bustin' back through the roof
Thugs tact or not, hard top or drop

Show em' how to rock and rock and roll and rock
How to breed low cake and open shop
Bringin' everything I know I got

Break some pies we'll see on the side of the road
Where everyday different bodies decay
Niggaz is rotten in graves gettin' dropped in a hole

Hide with and keep your eyes on watchin' for the po's
'Cause they don't know about
Where we be hidin' out better turn up your jets

Headed right there yet, better build up your rep
'Cause my niggaz cash checks from Hollis to the Dec
Holla at me my nigga I gotta good connect
Outbid for the complex, polishin' the Lex

You just got to do it for yourself

Yeah, yo
Look here my lil' nigga, let me talk to you for a minute
I'm a tell you about this business and these cash incentives
About these fake ass bitches and these bitch ass niggaz

How to spot the cowards from the killers
The flowers from the spitters
This industry is all smoke and mirrors
But we in the street niggaz so our focus is to finish niggaz off

How often do we put a nigga on
So you must be the chosen one
Your priority concern is never leave your residence without your gun
'Cause you'd rather be caught with than without one

Trust me I'm like that old gangsta named Lucky
Niggaz know that my hands are dirty but still can't touch me
In this game, if you clean, you can get all the money
When it starts gettin' dirty they look at you funny

'Cause it's ""A Bronx Tale"" like Calogero and Sonny
And that bus don't stop for everybody, call it
Keep your nose clean fuckin' with addicts and alcoholics
'Cause I'll have us on the bed with some hood bitches from Georgia

That's ATL for you, New York's no different
It's L.A. and Miami that's how they visit
Keep your eyes on these snitches and fraud ass niggaz
They claim to be gangstas as soon as you see em' split em'

It's a cold world, be grateful that the Lord's forgiving
And be happy you ain't dead, sick, or in prison

[Verse 1:]
Now see it was Monday afternoon
Very first day of school
Back of the class makin' girls laugh
Teacher's mad 'cause I'm cuttin' a fool
I'm just doin' what I usually do
Errything's cool, chillin' with the crew
Sayin' ""finally, the bell's bouta ring""
That's when this new student walked in the room
My jaw dropped, I felt my heart stop
She's flaw to flaw
This girl's so raw
So this girl got me hooked like a bra
Like climax, man I paused
See this girl is sick like the flu
Wish I knew who she was
She's hot like curry, my vision is blurry
But why should I worry

[Chorus 2x:]
'Cause I'm a G
Can't let her get to me
But her voice sounds sweeter than a symphony
But I know, know that eventually
She'll find someone else and forget of me

But I'm a G
(I'm a G)
I'm a G
(I'm a G)
So what could it be
(What could it be)

[Verse 2:]
Now later on got home set down my bags
Got homework, chores: need to take out trash
But see this girl's got me all off task
My hearts beaten fast who could I ask?
Got the phone called Tez
He said ""Lloyd what's crackin'?""
I said ""Dawg you won't e'en believe what happened.""
""I'm chillin' and this girl walked up in the class and
Swear she look just like Janet Jackson
So should I write a letter to her
Or should I send a messenger
I tried to vibe and connect with her
But I didn't have enough guts to step to her
And I really want the best of her
But can I get the rest of her?""
So he told me ""Lloyd don't sweat it.""
And I said ""You're right. Forget it.""

Can't let her get to me
But her voice sounds sweeter than a symphony
But I know, know that eventually
She'll find someone else and forget of me

This is my life yeah

[Chorus]
This is my life
Baby ohhh
This is life

January 3, 1986
Busting out for the fix 
Took my first steps
No clue at how physical life gets
Round uptown Calio projects
Whole life stopped when my daddy got popped
One shot to the head he was dead on the spot
Now I'm running around with my stomach in knots
Knowing memories is all I got

[Hook]
Ohh nobody knows about the struggling I been through 
that's why I hustle like I do
I gotta provide for my people
Yeah
And nigga I done worked too hard
I done came too far to loose
can't stay still gotta stay on the move
Leave everyday with a point to prove

[Chorus: x 2]

Mama jumped ship
Hoping shit gone change
Now I'm A-Town bound nigga down for the grain
I'm feeling like I'm loosing my sane
Cause nigga?s round me been using cocaine
Now my dreams of fortune and fame won't be slain
Just gotta except that I'm on the road that was chose from above
Nigga love is pain

[Hook]

[Chorus: x 2]

I go and know you been waiting for a long time
Shorty keep a strong grind
Never give up the sun don't shine
See I'm where I belong now yeah
[unknown]
Cause if the shit hits the fan and times get hectic
I'll fall to my knees and thank god that I'm blessed with
The strength to hold on and deliver the message

Tell that nigga that's how the fuck ya feel, nigga
Ya feel like ya look nigga, ya feel good nigga
What's happening nigga? Let's get it, ay, let's go

Red paint, inside's peanut butter
They seeing me, but I don't see them suckers
I ain't gon lie, man my shit tight
Hoes jocking, got 'em stopping like a red light

Wake me up, this a sick dream
Got the Alpine with the flat screen
These niggaz ain't aware, mayne
12's in the trunk sounding like an airplane

A 757 jet
He ain't know? You dealing with a fucking vet
Niggaz cold like banana splits
That's why I cop the are with banana clips

Sitting 24 inches off the ground
(That's how ya feel)
A young nigga sellin' fruity by the pound
(That's how ya feel)
And I got the best white in the town
(That's how ya feel)
45 on my lap, it's going down
(That's how ya feel)

Sitting 24 inches off the ground
(That's how ya feel)
A young nigga sellin' fruity by the pound
(That's how ya feel)
And I got the best white in the town
(That's how ya feel)
45 on my lap, it's going down
(That's how ya feel)

I got a project chick with a lot of kids
She say, she like my flow but love my ad libs
I was saying, ""Yeah"" before Usher
Never scared like T I and Bone Crusher

Any problem, Jeezy take care of it
Them ugly hoes say a nigga arrogant
Real slow is how I drive past
Got everybody looking, sweating like a gym class

I see you funny niggaz got jokes
Disrespect the Chevy, still riding on spokes
You fucking with a player
We don't just say, ""No"", we too busy saying, ""Yeah""

Sitting 24 inches off the ground
(That's how ya feel)
A young nigga sellin' fruity by the pound
(That's how ya feel)
And I got the best white in the town
(That's how ya feel)
45 on my lap, it's going down
(That's how ya feel)

Sitting 24 inches off the ground
(That's how ya feel)
A young nigga sellin' fruity by the pound
(That's how ya feel)
And I got the best white in the town
(That's how ya feel)
45 on my lap, it's going down
(That's how ya feel)

I'm a motherfucking problem, who wanna solve me, dog?
Got six cell phones, who gon' call me dog?
This ain't a movie, we are not actors
Still use a duck ass nigga for target practice

Infrared beam on the Mausberg pump
Hit his ass with it twice, make him A-Town Stomp
In gats we trust
Niggaz play a lot of games dog, but not with us

Call me, 'Jack In The Box', hop out with two clips
Cook ya faster than a T-bone at Ruth Chris
You still hating, looking stupid
I'm in the SL, looking real Coupe-ish

Sitting 24 inches off the ground
(That's how ya feel)
A young nigga sellin' fruity by the pound
(That's how ya feel)
And I got the best white in the town
(That's how ya feel)
45 on my lap, it's going down
(That's how ya feel)

Sitting 24 inches off the ground
(That's how ya feel)
A young nigga sellin' fruity by the pound
(That's how ya feel)
And I got the best white in the town
(That's how ya feel)
45 on my lap, it's going down
(That's how ya feel)

[Verse 1]
Got one baby mama, no bitch, no wife

Face like Trina, and an ass like Jacki-o (ohh)
Got a gangsta on a mission (mission)
Best believe I know all the right positions (that?s right..)
She like it slow from the front, fast from the back (back)
Put the pound game on her, hit her from the back (Jeahh)

He can make love to you, I?ma beat it up?

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Me & shawty in the coop, lord knows she?s a star (star)
For some strange reason she likes to do it in the car (damnn)
She ain?t the type that be running her mouth (nope)
So I keep it gangsta with her, let her come to the house (eyy)
Let her play matter wit slick, when we in the bedroom she like to play with the stick (yea?)
Know just how to handle her (how?)
No amateur baby, I got stamina (jeah)
Jeezy in the deck, now she grindin to the beat (beat)
Legs vibratin, now she messin up my sheets (ha haa)
Got a fistful of hair, and a fistful of ass (ass)
She came first, I came last, roll tha grass?(eyy)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 ""Slick Pulla""]
We pull bad hoes, rip them, push them to the side
'cause real players, keep reserves when its clinch time
Matter fact, my bottom bitch love to ride pine
She know when daddy leave the block, that its cut time
I'm in the trenches, getting riches wit my comrades
We 4 hoes up, like slacks in the player path
Pretty skin, silky hair, plus that ass fat (uh huh)
Fresh kicks on your feet, ya I?m diggin that
Slick consako, ya boys slingin wood bitch
You want that straight drop dick
Come to the hood bitch
I like scout them ghetto hoes up in 20 grand
'cause them the ones be wit that freaky shit man
2 drinks, 3 beans, now she rollin man
The tool in her throat, I?m just tonsil patrollin man
True pro's with this shit, we ain?t new jacks
We drill hoes and switch ?em up like fitted caps

Lloyd,"[Chorus: Lloyd]
Ain't nothin' but the street life
That's money cars and hoes
It's the only life I chose
Street life , nothin' but the street life
They love they way I shine
This world is mine, all mine

[Rick Ross]
Up early in the morning, got gold in my eye
Got a 4-5 that'll leave a hole in the sky
Sitting at this table, why, to take this 
Music and the street life that's a whole 'nother side (right)
Hoes used to call me small time
My clothes ain't know what to call mine
No logos or no tags in it
No polos 'til I started bag-gin' it
Way before my first key
My nigga E showed me
How to parlay a Z (good lookin' nigga)
I know my mama pullin' overtime
Pocket full of dimes
So I'm out here pullin' mine

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
You can't close shop, not on my block
I'm 24/7 like IHOP
Came from the bottom to the skybox
Now a penthouse, you can call me Hi-Top
Hop up in the 40-40, got 'bout forty on me
Fifty grand in a band, I'ma roll it homie
Brick layin' cost 'bout another dub
Ten grand for a pound of the bubble bud
Twenty birds in a room down in Atlanta
I caught a bird, but the birds can't buy a camper
Just an example, by an ex-trapper
Dress the coupe in the shoes, now that's dapper

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
Street life, sellin' dope, fuckin' hoes
Big E, smoke comin' outta nigga nose
Candy paintin' on the corner, sellin' everything
I'm on the move, I ain't called mama in a couple days
This life and nothin' will ever change that
I love the game and we'll never give the game back
We lost a lot of good niggas in the game
But in the game, all the good niggas get a name
I got a name, everybody don't die the same
Like all dope don't fly the same
M-I-Yayo, boy I buy them things
It's like the people want me to come fly the plane

[Chorus: x3]",Street Life,2006
Lloyd,"[Fabolous]
Tryin' to show you somethin', shorty
Hey, baby girl, they say the world is a beautiful place, that's right
I'm tryin' to help you open yo' eyes and see that
Ha ha, this some shit, cool shit, real playa like

[Chorus:]
Hey, shorty, we can do it real playa like
We can go a few places that you say you like
See what a day is like when you be my a-alike
Girl, just lay back, I'll do it the way you like
(Said, it's the flyest thing, just the way we swing)
(Me and you, how we do, be so fly)

[Fabolous]
You need to leave them burgers alone and make a steak upgrade
I'm fillet mignon with a tape-up fade
I see things clear through these Mark Jacob shades
Like the clarity in these jewels that Jacob made
You sleep better knowin' you gon' wake up paid
Hairstyled, nails filed, makeup made
We can shock South Beach, shake up Dade
In a drop top Phantom with the Drakov blades
I'm a stop by the barber; you can hit the shops in the harbor
Then get the chops or the lobster
Prime on twelve, dinner for dos
We begin with a toast, end with a dose
Of the light green cheeba, rolled in a cohiba
It's Sunday, so you know the Forge is
Weather gorgeous, not a cloud in the sky
We can show the world how to be fly, yes

[Chorus]

[Fabolous]
If you want to act Hollywood, fine; but, shorty, let's do it
When we sittin' on the hills like the Hollywood sign
And every man lies, but not every man flies
Privately to Van Nuys
Range on the runway, driver to pop doors
Straight to Barney's, somethin' we need to stop for
She like, ""It's early, what we gonna shop for?""
How 'bout green grass breakfast, top floor
Later on Fred C, or Max Fields
Real playa like dress, good black heels
No 'Hanas, we can do Katana's
You, me, and ooo-wee marijuana
Then slide through Hyde, might include Mood
Maybe go to Area, if it's in the area
The Friday's young, try things my way, hun
Malibu ride, highway one

[Lloyd]
Nothing is too much, everything you touch turns to gold
You make me better (you make me better)
I'm fly as I can be, but when you're with me
I can't help but notice I'm more focused (but you're the coldest)
Girl, you are so...

[Fabolous]
Hey, shorty
Bring the Maybach, we got a long way to go
Just lay back; you had a long day, I know
And they whack, do it the wrong way, I know
I play back but have the song playin' low
While we six-deuce and let you fix Goose
In a glass with some ice, maybe mix juice in
On the way to L.I., well I, could a took the hell-eye
But we do more behind wheel
Hampton home, two floors, for nine mill'
Real playa like, two doors from Seinfeld
White marble, new floors that shine still
And the help keep food stored, wine chilled
Hey, you gotta live one day, right? (Right)
Well, how 'bout from Friday to Sunday night?
Then back 'fore they notice back up in Lotus
Let the world know we back and we focused

Lloyd,"Yeah, Willie The Kid
Bright lights, street lights

Summertime in apartment 409,
Had to clean up the kitchen with 409,
It Was cookin' up work, while my granny at work
My big cause he ain't understand me at first,
He said, the court room or the casket,
I'm like dude, either way you need cash and a nice suit,
The street lights where I found my strength
Be with four rich men, and you bound to be the fifth
Let's go

I lost my daddy at a early age,
Told my mama don't cry for me,
If I trade tomorrow in for yesterday, oh how much different my life would be,
But that's in my dreams, back to reality,
Tryna get outta these street lights, so I won't have to live this street life,

No more, no more 
No more, no more no

Just gotta learn to deal with problems,
If you're young and from slum with no father,
Got killed when you was little, still got mama,
She try to tell him go to school, but why bother
When gettin' paid is the only way to solve 'em
Seems the stars get farther and farther
Out of my reach, out of these streets,
Will they ever make it big

Cause I lost my daddy at a early age,
Told my mama don't cry for me,
If I trade tomorrow in for yesterday, 
Oh how much different my life would be,
But that's in my dreams, back to reality,
Tryna get outta these street lights, 
So I won't have to live this street life,

No more, no more 
No more, no more no

I ain't ashamed to say that I shed a tear
Thinkin bout my dad I wish I had him back,
I'd give up everything just to have him here,
After this storm and rain I have no fear,
Gotta keep holdin on, hold my head up strong,
I know it won't be long until we'll be together again, foreal

I'm livin' for the moment
If I could turn back the days
Sure, you could turn this back
Hey, I was born with the hustle, never been a sucker
Daddy wasn't in the crib, dat made me tougher
Momma struggled with the bills, dat made me stuff up
Powder in a sack, which made me dumber
Now I'm standin' on the corner, bag full of Marijuana, Crack
Pistol my pocket for anybody who disrespect
In the trap chillin' where robbers and killers, kick it at
My arms up in the feds for ten, they say I'm goin' in
Ha, bet dat I'm a stretch that, backish to this rappers
Show these niggas what I'm best at
Get a lil' check, flip it and invest that
Years later, oh now you see what my heads at
Like meals chasers, we be everywhere the bread at
You keep on hatin', you'll be layin' where the dead at
You rappers suckers, you can tell them that I said that
If nothin' else but the hustle, you gon respect that

Oh yeah
I lost my daddy at a early age,
Told my mama don't cry for me,
If I trade tomorrow in for yesterday, 
Oh how much different my life would be,
But that's in my dreams, back to reality,
Tryna get outta these street lights, 
So I won't have to live this street life,
No more, no more
No more, no more
No

Guess, this is my life
And I wanna live it right

So want you ride with me, my ghetto queen
You're all that I need
Cause she my ghetto queen, I give her what she need
Money ain't a thing, she stay down like a G [x2]

[Chorus: Lloyd]
Girl I done been around the globe and you the realest lil'lady I know
Don't wanna ever let you go - cause oh
Everytime I call you be there for me
Baby girl I love you by my side
So anything you need, that means you got me
So just my ghetto queen gon' take that ride

[Verse 1: Trae]
Look here lil'momma I'm gangsta
Prolly nothin like you done delt with on the day to day
Some say that I'm a star, but in the hood I'm better known as Trae
I'm from around the way - where not too many make it out
And even if I did it's in my blood I'll never take it out
You say you got a man but I ain't tryna take his spot
I'm tryna be ya partna while I'm late night flippin on the block
So we can post up on this glass, tippin the Chevrolet 
And get it, how we get it, then I'm gettin right back out ya way
I'm in my zone so all that drama you can leave at home
Ya man can lock you down, but me ain't nothin - rollin stone
And if you wanna chill tell his ass to leave you alone
Cause if he run up on me, I'm a run my fist upside his dome
Understand when I say I'm grown, and on that other shit
I'm tryna make a team but I ain't feelin all that lover shit
I'm tryna hit the lights and take it to you on that rubber shit
And keep it G, and leave it on that undercover shit

[Chorus: Lloyd]

[Verse 2: Rich Boy]
Ay lay back with me, feel free lil'momma
We can go the Bahamas in the summer
Lookin for the fat[? ], fuck the dumb hoes
And know that you'll ride with me baby fuck the po - po's
No pressure I ain't gotta test ya
I can leave you in my house with a hundred thousand on the dresser
Me and you - my beautiful bitch, so glamorous
So bad niggas pullin out they cameras
Together baby the world can't handle us
Hoes can't compete, no challengers
Summer time, we float on the boat
While I sip a lil'lean, and you puff a lil'smoke
I'm married to my money, but you could be my honey
The groupie bitches dump me - but I know that you love me
So on that note you can take this
Me and you be shinin harder then them diamonds on my wrist, M.O.B!

[Chorus: Lloyd]

[Verse 3: Rich Boy]
We can ride in my drop and spend some money on some Fendi
You never ask what type of gold diggers try to get me
Them hoes are silly, but I pass 'em in the Hemi
If a mothafucker touch you - I'm a hit 'em with that semi
You down like my nigga, so you know I got yo'back
Anybody put they hands on you, I'm a lay 'em flat
So spread ya wings baby come on let's fly
I'm down with my lady till the day that I die

[Verse 4: Trae]
Say lil'momma what you waitin on - actin like you don't know no better
You say you tired of that shit, then roll with me and it's whatever
When in the presence of a gangsta don't worry I got ya
And fuck the stress, give me a sec - I'm a get that up out ya
So get ya spot I'm on the grind right now
I'm prolly less then two seconds away from shine right now
You can post up and be the bitch I'm tryna find right now
And if you can't see that I'm tha truth baby you blind right now, Yeah

Lloyd,"I said, ""What time you get off?""
She said, ""When you get me off""
I kinda laughed but it turned into a cough
'Cause I swallowed down the wrong pipe
Whatever that mean, you know old people say it so it sounds right
So I'm standing there embarrassed, if we were both in Paris
I would have grabbed her by the waist and kissed her, but
We in the middle of whole foods, and those foods
Ain't supposed to beef, but you'd think they hated tofu
Check-in line got rowdy, my vision got cloudy
I started seeing circles like some Audi
Emblem, I'm hearing them say, come on man
Do this own your own time, get the hell on, man
I walked out, hm, I got bout
Half-way to my car when I heard shorty shout
""Three thousand, forgot your credit card, smart move
By the way, my little sister loves your cartoon""
Well, here's my name and numb
If I ain't the one, lose it, if I am, use it
If a man chooses, and he can, do's it
And he don't, don't take it personal, he might be might be swamped
With making mozzarella, no, making worlds better
Cheese will come, believe me, I'm, never focused on the cash
Ask Mel Gibson, Jesus Christ, I'm bout the pass, ion

Stop, baby bring that thang back
You know where my heart at
Shorty, show your boy some love

Thank the Lord everyday
Must be heaven sent from above (oh baby)

And I don't know what to do
I can't stop loving you
But it's cool 'cause I'm learnin' the truth
So I Can't deny to myself
That I'm crazy over you
Now my heart beats for two
But it just ain't enough to let you know
Girl, you gotta feel it in you soul

If it feels a dream, don't wake me
The thought bein' with you just takes me
To moon and the stars
The world revolves around my heart
We're travelin' at the speed of light
And my heart beat from this just with the thought of
Just one night with you (yeah)
You are my dream come true (oh yeah)
I only dream of you (oh baby)
You are my dream come true (girl, I can fly)

So get on the floor,
And continue to hypnotize me the way you do.

Time of day to show you why.
I'm not like those other guys.
Girl you might just be surprised.

Drop it on the one, girl.

Gone let me get close some more.
You might be the one, girl.
For someone who won, girl.
All those others might not be them.
You might be the, you might be the one, girl.

[Verse 2:]
It's just you and me,
What you wanna do?
Baby let me inside your mind.
Because I know that I can be,
Be the one for you.
Won't be no other girls on the side.
I'm tired of livin' trife,
Think I need a wife.
Let me be your provider.
And I know that she's a rider.
Freak the night away until she's tired.

And cherish every moment that you're around.
Let me change your mind, about me now, 
And show you what my love is about.

I was in my old school, she was in the Escalade.
She pulled off on the exit, then I pulled up next to her,
No time for flexin' now, I knew I had to get next to her,
All black she love shades,
Classy as she wanna be.
Could tell how I'm jockin' she could have me if she wanted me.
Now that I got her I'ma need a doctor if she leave me,

Am I so blind that I can't see I am wrong

Broke my heart, on what you had in the stroller
On the low, that could of been me, Huggie down
Fly and handsome, talk about little Starksky
With little Barkley's, little car seat
Two years later, here comes little Sharneese
I'm saying, are you involved, what's up with you?
And where homeboy at? Oh word, ya'll through?
Eff him, you know how I do, when I come through
Shut the whole block down like I got something to prove
But um, besides the lane, you look the same
Still blowing beauty marks, sitting under your bang
Ankle bracelets, that Donna Kay shit
I saw one rope for your throat, yo, it cost about 8 chips
Hoodrats, they be wearing that fake shit
Like her, she wear the same bag, like it ain't shit

Don't worry, let's breeze the bar
And in case I ain't tell you, those jeans is hard
And those is the snitches, mean mugging, can't fight
Run into the police, fuck them niggas
I pull out, like a tooth, when the back is rotten
Finish 'em off, like your menstrual, after you spotting
Ghost can't complain, 5'6"", swinging those hips
And my miss got me wanting to sing
Walking down the street, watching ladies
I got by watching you, watching you
I want you, like if I ain't got nothing to do

Focused cause you know we on

We ain't gotta stop we grown
And I don't really give a fuck who's calling
I don't really give a fuck who's ballin'
Call me A. Keys, who's ""Fallin'""
You's fallin', that's dude's problem

Everyday of the week I floss
Look off white rocks, no denim
Look off white drop, no rental

Something start blowing up my iPhone
Like where ya at? where ya been?

From the back, while I'm on the sink
While you smoke your blunt while ya drinking drinks
While them other broads blowing up ya phone
While ya pulling my hair with ya Nike's on

Her smile will keep me happy

Hey Mama Patti,
I think I need some advice.
See my girl talkin' bout how
I don't love her right.
See I give her everything if she a good girl,
But I need her to stay down like a hood girl.
See I don't wanna run the streets all my life,
But the problem is she's never satisfied.

But son do you tell her
I love you,
Or I
Need you?
Tell her I want you,
Or do you just sit down there and tell your girl

Lay your head on my pillow
Lay your head on my pillow
Lay it down,
Lay it down,
Lay it down,
Oh lay it down.

So I'm lookin' at the problem son,
And I have some advice.
(Tell me mama)
She, she told me how your more in the club
Than in the bed at night.
(But she be lyin' on a nigga, mama)
Now if you really wanna keep a good girl,
Then why you run the streets with a hood girl?
If you wanna keep this girl in your life,
You better straighten up
And treat this girl right and tell her I,
Love you,
I, need you.
Honey I, want you,
I do
Instead of tellin' your girl to

Lay your head on my pillow.
Lay your head on my pillow.

Lay your head on my pillow.

This what I'll do for you baby.

I'ma tell my girl how much I love her I'ma do right girl
I'ma stay up out the club 'cause I know that you right

You don't have to change,
Stay the same
Just switch it up a little

She's gonna love you more if you do

You know I like you so I gotta put a ring on that
You the one that I wanna put everything on that

Come on let's ride

She used to wake up to The View
Now she wake up with a view
Used to wake up to a kiss
Now she wake up to a shoe
Used to dream about millions
Now she workin' with a few
Used to know one Porsche, now she know two
Chanel handbags stuck to her like glue
Minks and chinchillas, whole closet like a zoo
Agent Provocateur, Louis and lots of Dior
All her friends wearing Gucci so she don't rock it no more
Every time we in Jimmy Choo, they gotta lock up the store
Walk out with boxes galore, next week she cop her some more
Alexander McQueen 'cause she my queen
Spent an Aston Martin on the ring, so you ain't gotta,

You ain't gotta say bye bye, baby this is hello
Put your hands in the sky, 'cause that's where we go go
You know I like you so I gotta put a ring on that
You the one that I wanna put everything on that
Let's go, baby this is hello

Come on girl, let's ride

Soon as them butterfly doors go up on that Ferrari
She step outside the car on there, stumble into Bulgari
Fall in that Y-cell, try it on, you fly as hell
Don't really like it, but I'm buying it, might as well
Have her own reality show, no drama
Grab your girl, we're shooting real housewives in the Bahamas
2-piece Hermes, Bottega Veneta flats
I heard Diddy out here so you know where the party at
(We on)and I ain't even gotta ask twice
'Cause when we hit the room she up and down like the gas price, damn
Got chills thinking of last night
I swear you was a goddess in your past life so,

You ain't gotta say bye bye, baby this is hello
Put your hands in the sky, 'cause that's where we go go
You know I like you so I gotta put a ring on that
You the one that I wanna put everything on that
Let's go, baby this is hello

Come on girl let's ride
Girl I know you wanna get away
This hotel room, that's where it goes down
And I know we never get away
Just give me a couple minutes and I'm in it
We all over the table, ain't no problem with you sweating on me
And I ain't pulling out, I'm tryna have fun
I know you tryna have fun

You ain't gotta say bye bye, baby this is hello
And you ain't gotta front for your friends
You know I have your hat
And the Louis Vuitton I got for your birthday
That was hello
And them bottles that we popped last Thursday
That was hello",Hello,2011

She, she used to be a really special lady (My everything)
I guess she’s feeling kinda freaky lately
It’s such a shame cause now the pussy’s changed (That pussy changed, yeah)

You the primer on the lime bean green box
When I couldn’t afford a Ford
Clean socks scooting 'cross the floor
In your, grandmama house
Hand on your mouth
You yap too much about the Penny-Ante
This mechanic's so uncanny
X-Men, X-Men
Your ex-boyfriend should thank me that I took you off his hands
Know I can bring another beach to the sand
And know I am well aware that you can bring a man to his knees
And get what you need without saying please but
Can you bring a man to his feet when defeat is on repeat
And they gone put this man’s Grammy’s on the street?
What? Why so quiet?
Hate that all of our memories happen in a Hyatt
You were perfect before you went on a diet
You was way thicker
You think I don’t remember
Shit, the magazine got to your head
Now somebody you don’t even know got you in bed
Bet your buddy don't even know you don’t like red
Or was it fuchsia, fuck it, our future is dead

Oh, no (I thought a pussy cat had 9 lives man) I need to know

Niggas study you, shawty know what a hundred do
Actually the nigga backing me
Is right in front of you
Raising a daughter
Sometimes depend what her father do
Niggas stunt on you, front on you
Niggas can't even ball but bunt on you
Them niggas lame
I hope you get testicular cancer in the brain
Dickhead, by the time you get fed
I be somewhere with a six pack and a six pack
Her lips and her hips thick
My boxers are covered in her lipstick
Her pussy fat but eatin' good, so that's a misprint
I'm a misfit, I did it and beyond
Shiny watch, lookin' like the old Diddy on my arm
Highly flammable, barely keep getting in Canada
Run this rap shit, I got stamina
You an amateur, I aim at 'cha,
I bang at 'cha, hope a plane hit 'cha
Fuck you and whoever came witcha
Trying to express the beautiful pain witcha
Like a tattoo of a framed picture
Of a dead homie, maybe a family member
I got some gambling scriputres like um
Scared money don't make no money
Bet now motherfucker gonna take them from me
Got ounces of loud you can hear me smoking
I be coughing on the crowd you can hear me choking nigga

Oh I feel so fly
Came so far, but I still wanna fly
So come on in this car, this yacht, this plane
You see what this beautiful pain, provide
Baby look into my eyes
I'd be the man or I'd rather die, rather die

You talk about hurting
Try washing clothes with no detergent
Daddy deserted so now we serve sandwich serving
Dreaming we had a furnace,
It's cold we sleeping on the curtains,
What can I say it got me highly motivated
Mama two job working, banana companies emerg
Need a two week notice
Before they say don't need your service
I'm too young to have burdens
But still feel I should be further
But who am I kidding
I had bridges but I just burned them
My mama need earnings
Ain't have no time for higher learning
Call me a hypocrite, backslider
You name it I done heard it
The way that they speak of me
You think I've already murdered
It's hard to be laid back
My haters so assertive, but
I gave my life up, I gave my rights up
I gave my dice up and I gave my dykes up
I gave my vice up and every club that lights up
And this is were the intern with no perm lights up

You don't see my pain
I guess it's beautiful pain
It gotta be beautiful pain, uh, yeah, yeah

Sometime, you don't gotta say much

Oh I feel so fly
Came so far, but I still wanna fly
So come on in this car, this yacht, this plane
You see what this beautiful pain, provide
Baby look into my eyes
I'd be the man or I'd rather die, rather die

Life is a game of inches,
Every move leads to something better,
There is no time to pay the benches
Gotta get in the game and live forever, and ever

It's getting extremely hard for the man to roam
With little kids putting this picture on the camera phone
Shit change now that the cameras on
A bitch will jeopardize the marriage to fuck you when they man is gone
These niggaz ramblin on about the paper that they getting stop it
I got more money than you in my little pocket
Yeah I'm stingy so it's stretch long
With G-Unit sweats on thread needle to Teflon
Des'Eagle and vest on, cause everybody ain't enthused
That's your name's around about good news, FUCK YOU!!!

And the way I flow is very
Ginsu or machete,
Way my pencil move is deadly
Platinum band platinum bezzie
Make a straight girl out of lezzie

Keep my windows like the prezzie
Press a button than I'm stuntin'

Pockets fat, necks studded
Boy my nick name should be Ruben
My Colombian connect told me the Mexicans have moved in
And he know just how I get it so we bout to introduce him
Got a girl named cigar called her that because she Cuban
Got a black chick that be boosting
Got a white girl that be boofin'
Gotta watch her cause she use it
But she fuck me like she stupid
And she always ready
To give me that Becky
Last time it was so good I almost crashed my Bentley
Hit the club, order bottles see them sparks in the sky
Will have this whole bitch lookin' like the fourth of July
But if you pussy's get to frontin' and the pushing lead to shoving
We just bussin' and we leaving like its nothin'
If it ain't the Gucci or the Louie than its Polo or its Rugby

Now I've got task on a nigga's ass
Tell me will they blast me
I think of an alias in case these crooked bitches ask me, now
It's gettin' crazy after dark
These narcs be like tryin' to shut me down but I'm too smart
Now picture me scared of the penetentiary
I've been movin' these things since the days of elementary
Now tell me what ya need when ya see me
I'm stackin' G's buyin' all the things on TV, believe me
I got some killas on my payroll and they know
When it's time to handle business nigga lay low
Although I'm young I'm still comin up
I'm gettin' paid pullin' razors on niggas when they runnin' up
The first to pull the strap when there's drama
Buster you ain't heard?
I been slicin' motherfuckers since I lost my mama
There ain't a cop that can stop me
My posse is cocky and they don't wait until they drop me
I'm loyal to the game

I do my thing respect my hustle I ain't playin'
(Nigga I'm loyal to the game)
You get in my way and I cock and pop that thing
(Man I'm loyal to the game)
If you know what I know then you know I ain't playin'
(I'm loyal to the game)
Nigga get in my way and I'll blow out your brain

Possessed by the streets you can't tell me that this ain't home
I can't eat if the rest of this shit ain't gone
I'm gettin' used to the needles on the bathroom sink
Gotta close my door because the bathroom stink
See, daddy don't work, and mama don't drink
But daddy do dope, and mama can't think
So look like I'mma be the man of the house
Gotta have somethin' to put in the air when it's out
Up early in the mornin' the first to get it
They say if you really want it then come on with it
Sacrifice my life for this ice and these cars
And I only spent 30 days behind bars
I ain't never had a job but my rent got paid
I handled any beef that they sent my way
So send me to the pen but you know I won't change
It's thug in my veins
I'm loyal to the game

I do my thing respect my hustle I ain't playin'

Nigga get in my way and I'll blow out your brain

Yeah
It ain't my fault I came up fast
And your the name niggas bring up last
And all the dames get a king up ass
10 grand on every ring I flash
Deep frog--and I'mma have to fling your ass
I'm on the block where it's scorchin' hot
If you get caught in the crossfire they have to throw you off the block
I get 'dro by the pickle jar
These broke niggas wanna get the star
So I don't keep the four-nickel far
My lips is zipped I'm loyal to the game
Bring your bitch around me I'm spoilin' her brain
Get more slugs to boil in your frame
Cause you got rocks and they got aluminum foil for a chain
The paint's the same color as oil in the Range
I'm stingy ain't got nothin' for you but some change
I'm good now but the fact still remains
That the struggle that I'm from is attached to my name

I do my thing respect my hustle I ain't playin'

Roll through the hood wit an arsenal
Lookin for a bitch to put the sausage to
You niggas fallin off, I'm startin to feel like I'm responsible
The reason they won't sponsor you
All my niggas jump the gun
You sneeze and they stompin you
Back, neck, knees, and ya arms is threw
Ya album was a bad brick
Homeboy, I been hot since freddy krueger's last hit
I'm incredible, the one thing I won't ever do
Is slip up, and tell you that these bitch niggas ahead of you
Real niggas, be on point game tight (game tight)
Bag a new bitch and fuck her the same night (same night)
I could take care of these niggas on my own
Patiently waitin for Yayo to come home
Get the fuck out my way, I'm in the zone
Mutha fuck a fist fight I hold the chrome

Bitch southside til the day I die
Now you mutha fuckas know where I'm from
Niggas are jealous of the things I buy
So I gotta move around wit my gun
If you don't smoke the kinda weed I smoke
Don't bring ya bullshit around me

So be satisfied wit 2 or 3

Three'd be hat trick
Gave him more shots than the pediatrics
Came to his house and shot his left hand out
Left him with more scars than Mr. Def Jam South
To reach the sky, how far would a star go
To handle more cigars than a Cuban cargo
Makin money from everything I spoke in this
Wrapped by more ice than a broken wrist
Got ability to make missy a little tipsy
I'm more P.I.M.P than Mississippi (git it? Uh!)

I know you like to show off you're bust in gowns
'cause you go around jugglin guys nuts around
And we don't gotta wait till you're ass confesses
'cause you go around showing off you're ass in dresses
You watchin porn sittin there at you're macintosh
With you're hand in you're ass like you're jackin off
And you try goin harder than star wars Anakin
'cause you practice at you're house with a anus manikin

got a belt full of steel you can call me santa
You better keep your eyes peeled like a fuckin banana
And don't try to shoot me like some dumb retards
'cause I miss bullets like I'm sendin them e-cards 
Always equipped with the vest so don't aim for the bell-ay
'cause I dodge bullets like I play for LA
And I'm invisible 'cause you can't even see me son
But you're soft as shit I could shoot you with a bb gun
They call me stretch where I'm from 'cause I'm extended out
Find your ass in my house and I'll send it out

Here we go now 
Everybodies in a rush to try to get the throne
I just get on the track and try to set the tone
Ain't trying to use nobody as a steppin' stone

But don't compare me I'm better off just left alone
And I ain't even tryin' to go there with record sales
I'm just tryin' to keep it humble and respect myself
Say what what up keep steppin' and just rep D12

Keep my nose clean stay away from weapons jail
And livin' wreckless, but if you would check my belt
You may see soemthing else I use to protect myself
A vest to stop a ruger and deflect the shells and

Send em back at you faster than they left the barrel
And I don't even carry guns no more I don't got to
Got under cover cops that'll legally pop you
And I done seen a lot of people crossed the line

But this motherfucker Ja mustve lost his mind
That X has got him thinkin' that he was DMX 
Then he switched to Pac now his tryin' to be him next
So which one are you X Luther Pac or Michael ?

Just keep singing the same song recycled
We'd all much rather get along than fight you
Me and hailey dance to your songs we like you
And you don't really want to step inside on my group

Come on now you know the white boy will bite you
I'll hurt your pride dog and you know I don't like to
But I will if I have to 
With syllable after syllable ill just slap ya

Killin' you faster 
Than you poppin' pill after little pill of them tabs of
That shit you on but if you want it you got it 
You'd bump this shit too if we didn't diss you on it

But if we lock horns we can charge harder than Busta
We bump heads with any motherfucker that wants ta
So what's the deal where was all of the tough talk
When I walked up to ya like Ja what up dog

How come you didn't say you had a problem then
When you was standin' there with all you men
We could've solved it then I'm a grown man dogg come holla
All you did was slap hands smile and swallow

Another one of them lil x pills in front of me
And tell me 50 Cent was everything you want to be (Cmon)

[Chorus: x2]
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You can talk I'm still the m.c
You don't want to bump heads with me

You couldn't slug me if my father helped you
My punchlines is hot my bars would melt you
Ja, you... stuart little, shells will lift you
Every other week I'm buyin' a new pistol

I clap at yo ass with this chrome 38
And put 6 through yo hat so seven in 3 eights (?)
Erv you ain't shug knight you shook light
I put my knife in ya wind pipe

Then freeze on this turn pike
You know and I know who took ya chain
You got rolled two times so your ass is lame

But if you get too close, I'm gonna clap you
It's too real out here to be scared
A real nigga gonna do whatever he has to
A man is the last thing you should fear
It ain't considered a crime unless they catch you
We all die one day (Obie Trice go!)

Niggas when I step up in the bar, faggots wanna look
Like you motherfuckers got Obie Trice shook
Like I'm gonna stand here as a man and
Let some queer ass funny looking nigga get the upper hand
I got issues, got no time, got guns that mourn niggaz' moms
Shoot up clubs and destroy niggaz' vibes
Everybody running for their motherfucking lives
Tough club niggaz, we leave early, cock back surely
Open up your fade, your grey brain meets motor city pave
Your nervous system still twitch off Jay Z
Ho's in animal skirts get mirked
Don't ever let a nigga tell you slugs don't hurt
Don't ever let a nigga tell you play the bar hard
Trust in ""God""? It's 'cause you're about to catch a bullet scar
I give a fuck where you from, who you be with
Keep this a secret, right by the nuts
A 4-5 that'll light niggaz up and this 4-5 high make me not give a fuck

But as long as I'm here, I'm gonna grab checks
And make my cash stretch longer than giraffe necks
Poverty will make your ass bet on words
Touch niggaz in jail make them wanna finish their last set
They say you live by the gun and die by the next nigga gun
If that's the case, then get a bigger one
You don't think I'm packed to pump cause I'm out of the hood
That's a stereotype like everyone that's black can jump
I'm in a white mink, the fabric is done
Cop rings like Mike, Larry, Magic and them
Out in Dallas in a palace where the Mavericks is from
Living lavish, I'm established, so the cabbage'll come
I'm the clouds, you don't see me in the train
I travel first class, you ain't even got a TV on your plane
You should be easy on my name, cause I ain't going back and forth
Your boss and your captain's soft (Bitch)

Niggas know what I'm about out here
I don't toot my own horn 'cause I don't have to

You want it? you gon' get it
Name 'em we gon' hit em, chew em up and spit em out

Too much venom, and if you roll with 'em
We gonna fuck you up with 'em
I got too much momentum moving in my direction to lose
My shoes will explode, soon as you go to step in 'em (BOOM)
You know how we do it, when we do, how we do it, when we come through
G-Unit, D-1-2 and Obie, we all move like assassins
Ski masks and gloves Consider this as a warning
Disaster comes faster than you can react to it, just ask Muggs
But we are fizast, fuck your little bitch ass up
We are not killers my vato will have you shot though
Drag through the barrio and fucked like Kim Osario
Little sorry hoe ass, go ask be Real
We burn source covers like fuckin' Cypress Hill
Did in the 90s, when you was in diapers still
Shady Records, ""you better believe the hype is real""
This is no joke, I don't smoke
But I toke enough second hand to make my fuckin ""P.O."" choke
I'm an OG you fuckin with a GI Joe
Bia Bia, mia meo a Vida loco
I'm a psycho, Mariah ain't got shit on me
When I retire I'll be spitting baby food on people
At San Ysidro Ranch, huddled up next to her
With Hello Kitty slippers on, humping her legs
You ever had your cap peeled back, or your shit pushed in?
I put my blade in you like a fucking pin cushion
Slice your ear clear off, Smirnoff and indo
I'll show you how to kill a fucking man like Sen Dog
Nobody told you that I'm loco, esse?
I lack every sane chemical in my membrane
I'm Slim Sha ""D"" in the ""Dy"" is for ""deez nuts""
And you can get each one for free so feast up
I pee in a cup for three months I'm having an E party for Easter, please come squeeze guns

We gonna bring it to anybody who want it
You want it? you gon' get it
You name 'em, we gon' hit em, chew 'em up and spit em out
Too much venom and if you role with 'em
We gonna fuck you up with 'em
You can do all them push ups to pump up your chest
I got a 12 gauge Mossberg to pump up your chest
Have you gasping for air after that shell hit your vest
Fear me like you fear God cause I bring death
Silverback gorilla in the concrete jungle
I'm the strongest around you know how I get down
I watch gangster flicks and root for the bad guy
And turn it off before the end cause the bad guy die
If you trying to buy guns, I'm the nigga to look to
So what they got bodies on 'em, they still look new
You can raise your voice like you fiendin' to touch something
When I raise my knife, shit, I'm fiendin' to cut something
See I walk like Ron O'Neil and talk like Goldie
If the bitch think I love her, then the bitch don't know me

We're in a different time zone, your records don't reach us
No, I ain't here to save the world, just roll up a blunt
Come with me out front, I'll tech you how to stunt

[Chorus]

[Young Buc]
Chain so icy, you don't have to like me
In a throwback jersey, with the throwback Nikes
I know you probably seen me with Cash Money from back in the days
The only thing changed is the numbers on the range
I bought me an old school and blew out the brains
The Roc the Mic tour, I threw off my chain
My sprewell's spinning man, I'm doing my thing
And whodi now in trouble now that you in the game
Come on now, we all know gold is getting old
The ice in my teeth keep the crystal cold
G-Unit homie, actin' like y'all don't know
Look, I can't even walk through the mall no more
I just pull up, get out, and get all the hoes
They never seen doors lift up on a car before
Don't be mad at me dog, that's all I know
That's how to show these fougaisies how it's supposed to go

[Chorus]",Stunt 101,2003
Lloyd Banks,"I need you to pray for me and
I need you to care for me and
I need you to want me to win
I need to know where I'm heading cause I know where I've been
The flow is bone crushing, it's nothing, I come up with something
Come through your strip fronting, stunting
It's something you want, 745 chrome spinners
Haters hate that I'm winning
Man, I've been hot from the beginning
Motherfuckers envy the kid, control your jealousy
Cause I can't control my temper, I'm finna catch a felony
Pistol in hand, homie, I'm down to get it popping
Once I squeeze the first shot you know I ain't stopping
'Till my clip is empty, I'm simply
Not that nigga you should try your luck with or fuck with
Hollow-tip shells struck you with your bones broken, guns smoking, still locing
What nigga, lay your ass down, paramedics get you up feeling

Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead,so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy

Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead,so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy

I done lost my bigger nigga and I didn't cry
To young to understand the consequences of a man
Living a lie, I gotta get that money
I'll be damned if I'm bummy
Gotta watch my back around these niggas cause they funny
20 years of watching my mama's tears got my heated, heavily weeded
Smoking that bong cause I need it
These niggas don't want me balling, they want me buried
Bogged in the dirt from shots flurried
Laying with bugs under my shirt
I got plans to hop up in that Hummer
Cause I'm a stunner, I sit back and wonder
When them angels gonna call my number under
My chest is a heart of a lion
I ain't lying, bounty hunters got me flying
With my iron, high as a giant
I'm running from nothing, my stomach is touching what I'm clutching
To give you more than a concussion, end of discussion
My blood is colder so I'm bolder
Hennessy and soda, hood on my shoulder
Look in the mirror, I see a soldier

Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead,so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy

Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead,so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy

These are my ideas, this is my sweat and tears
This is shit that I saw with my eyeballs, my ears
This is me, who's gotta be what you see on TV
What you hear on CD, what appears easy
Man these teenie boppers see me on these magazine covers
In these beanies and these rags living fantasies
Fronting like it's all fun and games 'til the shoot 'em up bang
And you see your brains hang and you see we ain't playing
Ain't saying we ain't laying down at night and ain't praying
I bullied my way in this game, man, I'm done playing
Man, I'm done saying that I'm done playing
I'mma start laying into these motherfucking cocksuckers
There's no way I'm back down like a god damn coward
I can't, how would I look as a man bowing to his knees?
Like the mad cow disease, let somebody lash out at me
And not lash back out at 'em, please
Oh, whoa, yo, ho, hold up, oh no, not me, not Marshall
You wanna see Marshall? I'll show you Marshall
I try to show you art, but you just pick it apart
So I see I have to start, showing you fucking old farts
A whole other side I wanted to not show you
So you know you're not dealing with some fucking marshmallow
Little soft yellow, punk pussy, whose heart's Jello cause

Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead,so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy

Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me

She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada
That BCBG, Burberry, Dolce and Gabana
She feed them foolish fantasies, they pay her cause they wanna
I spit a little G man, and my game got her
A hour later, have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear saying they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar trying to get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country, think she like me cause I'm from New York
I ain't that nigga trying to holla cause I want some head
I'm that nigga trying to holla cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed

From the backseat of my V, I'm a P-I-M-P
Girl we could pop some champagne and we could have a ball
We could toast to the good life, girl we could have it all
We could really splurge girl, and tear up the mall
If ever you needed someone, I'm the one you should call
I'll be there to pick you up, if ever you should fall
If you got problems, I can solve'em, they big or they small

So if you scared of conflict don't come outside
Get your hands on a gun
Cause ain't no one gonna repspect you as a man if you run, dial 9-1-1
I'm hear talkin' to the street now
That's only gonna lead to bulletwounds and beatdown's, retreat clown
You still strugglin down to your last rock
G-Unit is gorillas and Blackchild's the mascot
You thought you wouldn't hear my voice
I'm in the hood cause I'm hood
You in the hood cause you ain't got no choice
Your top seller gettin' sticked for his shine
Either I'm blind, or Ashanti's sideburns is thicker than mine
I'm youngest in charge with my dick in a dime
Grippin' the nine, sippin' that lime
Becardi in a party, you sorry
I'm blowin' wet green right out the safari
That'll put you in a left lean higher than a marley

She's buys anything I desire, prolly cause I'm on fire

My neighborhood breed ballers that slam dunk
Cross overed to crack now they can't even jump
I leave with any panties I want, the industries new face
I'm in a bitch mouth every morning like toothpaste
Place your bet, Envy pull out a few crates
I got enough 16's to battle 2 states
I'm in a spaceship, neck full of grey shit
Bigetes in the braclet, expect nothing basic
Respect and embrace it, your sketch in the basement
I'll have them try to find where the rest of your face is

Yea, you laughing and dancing 'til they stick you
And have you holdin' your chest like I'm singing the National Anthem
Have your worried bout the reprecussions after the tantrum
I'll be alone in a mansion, and it's snowing in the Hamptons
Regardless of what these fools say, I'ma be around longer than 'Cool J
Armed with a new K
So dumb in a new way, If I don't fuck Monday, I'm gone hit it Tuesday
My charm get it usually
You put a lot of years into rap, these lil' starvin' chumps
Start your career from the back of a milk carton
Your gased up from whatever he must of told ya
But everything in Army fatigues ain't a soldier
In my upbring we wore the same socks
And buckets in the living room to catch the rain drops

You now lookin at the hood meal ticket seven thou on my wrist
It's kinda hard to keep the balance with this
It keeps the challengers pissed
I vacate to different islands and twist

And back home where the violence exist, now silencers fixed
You buy mileage as gifts as well as man's best friend
And I don't own no rottweillers and pits
It's getting extremely hard for the man to roam

With little kids putting this picture on the camera phone
Shit change now that the cameras on
A bitch will jeopardize the marriage to fuck you when they man is gone
These niggaz ramblin on about the paper that they getting stop it

I got more money than you in my little pocket
Yeah I'm stingy so it's stretch long
With G-Unit sweats on thread needle to Teflon
Des'Eagle and vest on, cause everybody ain't enthused
That's your name's around about good news, FUCK YOU!!!

Drag my family with me 'cause that's how real niggaz get down
If it wasn't for 50 I probably wouldn't be around
Caught up in the temptations, sitting in jail or underground
And for that if you snap a finger I'll lay a nigga down
Its fucked up when your only facial expression is a frown
A hood rat a put a future in a fools pants
Till she find out you can't buy furniture with food stamps
A year ago I made a decision before I shut my eyelids
Pray to God I get shot tomorrow 'cause I don't like surprises
When you hot as a oven, they embrace you with open arms
When you cold as a freezer, niggaz treat you like they don't need ya'
Some people call it they vapors, me I call it amnesia
Live my life principle driven, never bite the hand that feeds ya'
Never mind all the haters, fuck them all, let them die slow

Pop the bag, pass the dro'
Blow about a half a O

You gotta agree, these motherfuckers a probably have me Latin
Before they find a nigga hotter than me
We on top as far as I can see
And since the hood watching me
My regular trip to the mall is a shopping spree
I'm the number one draft pick, none of y'all topping me
I move around with the plastic, you ain't dropping me

Haters mad they can't look inside cause I pitched the tints
I enter the club with baggies of that chocolate
Second-hand smoke will make a nigga wanna start shit.

Raise up a lighter and fuck up the whole apartment.

Although betrayal is not forgiven
I do this for my niggas locked up that's comin' home to lobster livin'

Just so I could see her pop the ribbon.

Weed rollin', G-strollin', bad-mouthin', mofucker
Law breakin' Pimp, slappin niggas for the fuck of it
Hip-hop an zip lock an rip rockin' gang banger
Thought you was an actor, thought I was a singer
Thought about ridin' but you say you wanna hang tough
D-P-G-Unit sounds like danger
You might wanna manage your anger
Hang with us and stop smokin' on the same stuff
Now lay back on the loft

I'm so fly, I got money
So that's good enough reason to buy the things I buy
I'm so high, I'm on point
And I could tell that your jealous just by the look in your eye
And when I ride by
I don't care, G-Unit's going straight to the top this year
Nigga I'm so fly, I got money
So that's good enough reason to buy the things I buy

[Verse - Lloyd Banks]
Uh, Banks is fresh out the gutter
Too smooth to stutter
The cig a melt a brother like two scoops of butter
Before I leave the crib I tell my mother I love her
Grab the burner
But she ain't concerned 'cause he's a earner
My bitch lays it out real nice for me to murder
We fight, wake up and fuck like Ike and Tina Turner
Its a privilege to ride with a celeb'
'Cause them girls over here don't got a problem giving head
Paranoia is on ya', that's why ya' llama's in ya' bed
Fuck some real Chinchilla, buy some Llama for ya' head
Where the block I'm from
Niggaz be damn near forty and still tucking
And niggaz baby mama's is pregnant and still fucking
It's either 'cause they boyfriends a scrub like Brillo
'Cause Banks is cooler than the other side of the pillow
The chronic is blown
For my niggaz that got locked up and deported
And now they gotta go back home

[Chorus]

[Verse - Lloyd Banks]
Don't confuse me with the suckers
'Cause when I spit, You'll hear more ?Oh's?
Then a Skip-to my-Lou move at the Rucker
Thank God for giving Banks the gift
You think that bandana makes you look gangsta
But all I see is a handkerchief
Nigga there's no one out the click that freezes
Believe that, 'cause I ain't scared a shit but Jesus
Look dog, I don't run with the poodles
Difference is, I'm eating in Rome and you eating Roman Noodles
Ya' boy is corrupt kid
Banks a send a bitch to the store
Just for a piece of cheesecake like Puff did
You chumps can't afford these homes
Look around I got forty clones
Now look down, that's forty stones
And that's only in the necklace
I'm bony and I'm wreck lace
It's Tony in a Lexus
I'm fresh out the gutter, scrap what ya' man thought
I'm in the hood with more straps than a Jan sport

[Chorus]

[Verse - Lloyd Banks]
When I travel I know I'm gon' get stuck
'Cause they harass us in the airport
Like I'm the one that's blowing shit up
I got the patience of a High School teacher
And a bright future
Why the fuck would I have a bum on my sneaker?
All the goodie girls back off us
My hearts colder then Jack Frost's
We pack shows and attract bosses
Black clothes with my black Forces
A black rose for a rats coffin
I'm blowing O's of that black coughing
Blow on the road then I'm back flossing
No one knows how much that's costing
Fuck ass, only the green moves me
I got a clean Uzi
A pair of gloves and a mask from the Scream movie
So if you plotting on popping off, then scheme smoothly
Or get a little red splatter on ya' cream Coogi
My name ring each state
So you ain't gotta go all the way to L.A. to get ya MC ate

You can hear the sound of gunspray e'ryday

I'm rap's LeBron, Teflon Don
Baguettes on arm, the next Sean, John
By any means I protect my charm
Blade'll bubble you up, like Moet, Chandon
I'm only calm, when I'm blowin that chron'
Gettin them flashbacks like baby hold onnnnn
I never thought I'd sweat so long
And re-enact the scene of my ghetto song
Eyes wanderin off, breath all gone
Stomach all swoll up, neck all warm
Head still spinnin off that Seagram and vodka
And you know who shot ya, bitch get the doctor!

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
(If you so gangsta)
Then why you tuck your chain in when you walk in the club
(And if you so gangsta)
Why you a grown man, still gettin your pockets dug
(If you so gangsta)
Then how come everytime you get into beef you tell
(And if you so gangsta)
Why niggaz know you for that in the street so well

[Lloyd Banks]
Now every now and then, a new kid gotta win
Yeah - but unfortunately for you, I'm him (I'm sorry!)
In my new tan trucks with the blue dot end
Hoppin out that big truck with the new wide rim
While you cramped up, on your Jet Blue ride in
We air the G-4, let the crew dive in
Before Lloyd Banks tail pop on sale
I feed a nigga a shell like Taco Bell
I'm flyin out to Japan to attract new fans
Let 'em get to know the man with the tattooed hands
Them gem stars'll leave your face all fat
So learn to stash yours in your baseball cap
I'm either gettin money out of state or off rap
So I'm tryin to figure out what made Ma$e fall back
And them niggaz in New York know the man is a monster
And I ain't from Atlanta but I A-Town stomp ya muh'fucker

[Chorus]

[Lloyd Banks]
It's like everywhere I look and, everywhere I go
It's a bitch sayin somethin slick, but you can suck my dick
I'm grade A nigga, you don't know who you fuckin with
They run up on your ass, you'll think you drunk your lip
Now I got money bags as big as a pumpkin get
And pistol as long as the hand Shaq dunkin with
I ain't the type that's desperate
I'm modelin diamonds now, you can call me +Icin+ Beckford (ow!)
My down bitch holds the metal, she got a Coke bottle figure
And a ass that's shaped like a bowl of Jell-o
You ain't even almost rich
They fuckin yo' ass, like the models in my porno flicks
Therefore you can't afford no 6
So before you hop your ass on camera get your wardrobe fixed
Banks don't house, want no bitch, so if there's five of her
Then she probably gon' suck 4 more dicks

[Chorus]",If You So Gangsta,2004
Lloyd Banks,"Nobody there knew they would die before they woke
They probably started off a beautiful day with weed smoke
Out of last night's pussy, the murder that she wrote
Cold sweatin' from a nightmare, mind on a see-note
You leave the door with intentions of fulfillin' your visions
Constantly sidetracked, thinkin' 'bout who's your man or who isn't
Maybe it's necessary - maybe you're overreactin
Maybe your actual downfall is that ho that you're clappin'
Maybe your pillow conversations been controllin' the actions
Maybe your homey overheard and never told you what happened
You look behind you when you turn the corner, cause death is promised
You done seen some niggaz go before ya, the threats are honest
And with that lingerin' in the back of your head
You know it's possible that you won't make it back in your bed
The confusion and jealousy and dishonor'll spin ya
But then none come worse than when that gunpowder's in ya

[Chorus]
If you my nigga, you my nigga til the end
Fuck a bill, fuck a bitch, fuck a Benz
Let's toast til we die
Roll up the weed and blow the smoke in the sky la da da
If you my nigga, you my nigga til we go
One of the few I would take a bullet fo'
Let's toast til we die
Roll up the weed and blow the smoke in the sky la da da

The smell of marijuana wreaks often
I raise hell 'fore I speak softly, quotin the Knicks
Put at least a hungred grand on one hand, bought him a 6
Acknowledged the weaknesses that his man taught him to fix
We ain't never left the hood, so we camcorded the trips
I done watched the nigga go from BET to the Bricks, shit
The slanted eyes what the chocolate thai gave me
I'm a bachelor, nigga you ain't knockin' my lady
A lot of these niggaz been jockin' mine lately
And I hope you catch the long and that rock-a-bye baby
We two brothers, pitched outta different mommas
Close enough to conflict and put the shit behind us
Your baby boy meet the daytime
Oldest watchin' and these niggaz tryin to get mine
Remember back then the lines in your flat top
Hopin' your moms ain't the momma on crack rock

[Chorus]

Keep my, mind on my money, and my head to the sky
I never really smile much, if you was here you'd know why
There's frustration and fire if you look in my eye
The media fuckin' me up, right hookin' my high
Niggaz hated on us 'fore the game took us inside
Then they opened they arms wide, took the whoopin' and cried
I got a platinum plaque hangin' on the wall of my crib
And handsome's one of the things they been callin' the kid
They watch you close when you coppin' all the VS stones
If you ain't tryin to get it poppin', leave the BS home
I got a saditty broad that gives the best dome
And I'm blowin' on some of the finest weed that's grown, homes
You won't know when they gon' dump a slug
But you can tell I'm gettin' money from the line out in front the club
My whole click caked up, you can't compare the dough
And if it's only one bitch, then we gon' share the ho

Even the paranoya of a female'll change ya
Waking up every morning laying next to a stranger
I'm on the move, smooth, with one eye out for the snakes
Who can't stand hearin your name all throughout the states
Tune into BET and watchin your video
Pretending to be your friends but the smart ones really no, so
If that's your man warn him
'Cause there's enough bullets in here to hit every NBA patch on him

These niggas wanna see me
'cause of the way I shine
But it ain't that easy
To get mine
You get ya ass laid down

Down,
The paint is peelin'
Now,
When the chips are down
Down,
You gotta lose all feelin
Now,
Your head goes round n' round

Funny how the world revolves around my click
'cause just a year ago a nigga ain't have shit (damn)
Me and my right hand share the same outfit
Which fueled the fire that I air the game out with (whoo)
It's amazing the way that boy came out quick
For that platinum niggas'll blows ya brains out, shit (bap)
I'm the new nigga the others can't stand
The rubber band man be god damned if I can (oh)
Let another nigga fill my spot
If a niggas steal from me it's the steel I pop
I'm on my grind so if you thought I chill, I'm not
Gon' stop lettin' that steering peel on the block, why not?

[Chorus: x2]

Banks they think I'm yayos replacement, nah
I borrowed his gunits to walk through the matrix
I'm signed to the Doctor I ain't got no patience
So he put me with 50 Cent now I got a face lift
Magazines wanna know where they fuck L.A. been
It almost died in the same car Suge got grazed in
2001 I was playin' my PlayStation
I heard 9 shots , I'm face down with my heart pacing
All I could think about as hidin' my gun and my drugs in the basement
It was either that or the state pen
I woke up out of that coma
Police waitin' for a statement, (heart monitor beeps to flat line)

[Chorus]

Pass the weed and let a nigga get into a zone
Papa left me all alone in the world to roam
But now I'm grown, millionaires on my cell phone
A year past now, caw dead and L gone
And I'm sick, bought chopper with a long click
So think about that before you make your songs dick (dick)
Or lose a limb, please don't get me confused with him (uh uh)
Cause I'm down to go a whole round, lose or win
If I should die, ride a G through the hood with pride (ride)
Every strip, block, and projects is on my side
I'm ghetto calm by the 100 grand on my arms (arms)

And stand yo ground
These bullets burn
They hit who evers standin' around
I never learn even after I took a couple shots
I just got me some band-aids and bought a couple glocks
Had to go on a rampage and hit a couple blocks
Once they hear that 12-gauge that's when the trouble stops

If its beef then I'm ready to ride
Just come to casheville you can find me on the south side

Leave anti-social with a case of lockjaw
Just cause shorty look good, don't mean that you should go
Puttin' ice on the bitch like she won the Superbowl
Even the chips are low, for all these so-called old heads
Just ain't the same niggas I used to know
I got a Houston ho - nah she ain't the sharpest knife
In the drawer but she a damn good booster though
See I could fuck a supermodel with my ? works

Here I go, caught up in some he say she said
'Til I go, put a slug in my enemy's head
The Tahoe's, bulletproof so you can't get through
Then follow, your ass and whoever ran with you
And you about as assed-out as two jammed pistols
Bleedin' around a bunch of niggas who can't fix you
So bring yours, cause you know I got mine with me kid
The 8'll make you lose weight like Missy did
The O.G.'s tryin' to hide they phony smilin'
Reputation always arise in Coney Island
I'm at your local newsstand jerk
While the only X-X-L you been in as a shirt
And, speakin' of shirts, get a new white T
God damn it feels good to be me, nigga!

I'm growin', knockin' international broads down
They know him, they're not gonna even pat the star down
I'm holdin', a glock so don't even act that hard now
You might bust your gun but your gat's in the car clown
So break your lil' weed up and crack your cigars down
Cause I ain't tryin' to start my visits, with the fuckin' judge
Givin' niggas life like it's parkin' tickets
Now I get to go to bed with a model
And the crib is bout as big as it is on the Belvedere bottle
I got all kind of ex' I could ram in they faces
Red and blue pills like the man in The Matrix
You might have spent some paper on your lil' charm but
My piece is bout as heavy as Lil' Jon cup
But, it's never tucked, nigga I don't give a fuck
I'll get bucked 'fore I give somethin' up, yup!

Cause a nigga thugging don't mean he don't 
Don't wanna see you smile baby 

I wanna be the reason you smile 
I wanna be the reason you smile 
I wanna be the reason you smile 
After you wipe away your tears and dry your eyes 

I'm getting the feeling you wanna take revenge 
From the conversations we have and the way it ends 
You wanna discuss me in front of your lady friends 
That's why it's just me and my Mercedes Benz 
It all depends, maybe if we make amends 
We can start from scratch 
Learn to control your temper and remarks in fact 
We plan to be platonic with our hearts in tact 
So every time we separate, somebody's marching back 
You're amazing in the sack 
Eyes slanted like you're Asian, but you're black 
God Bless whoever gave you alla that 
If you seen her from the back 
You'd understand why dis feel like that 
And ain't a flaw to her toes, the Lord knows 
Her pussy good enough to miss award shows 
And I ain't gotta say nothing, she just knows 
By the way I look at her to take off all her clothes 
Up and down

Whenever I'm not around, and you feeling down 
Let the thought of me be (I be the reason you smile) 
I don't wanna see you frown, like them kids watch a clown 
I wanna bring you joy and be (I be the reason you smile) 
Baby, you know my style, you know how I get down 
I provide by any means to be (I be the reason you smile) 
We done been through ups and downs, had drama for a while 
I'm just happy I'm around to be (I be the reason you smile) 

The main reason I been looking at you pitiful 
What about the half of this shit I done did to you 
Violated and tip toed into a crib or two 
I've come clean to be a bigger individual 
Even though you're busy boo, the evening's when I visit you 
Kinda makes me feel lucky, cause I see niggas 
when you tease 'em with your physical 
She wanna rack up her brooms, I ain't got no more room left 
Wild drama, section 8 princess 
My foreign chick bad, but she been stressed 
Cause it's hard to communicate 
Cause she don't speak-a no English 
I been around the world from state to state 
But now I'm back busting in your bathroom 
Got you laughing in your shower cap, let's get it on 
Cause I'm leaving in a hour, fly-through, don't matter she's mad 
Even when I holla back 
All I really need your attention for a while 
And, I bet you I can make you smile

Lloyd Banks,"[Verse One]
Guess who's the man this winter, straight out the land of sinners
The Range is tan with spinners, check out the white mirrors
Blow with the damn winners while you and your man's finished
Two in your Rams fitteds, turn off your lightswitch
Holdin my torch down, even when the force 'round
You let your wife roam, she want a divorce now
You niggaz ain't this gully, play it I paint your skully
You never take this from me the riders and all the gangsters love me
You shouldn't be a problem, I ain't be a problem
See you later I'll red your head, you'll be a Rodman
I know your type, hoppin all over beat screamin
You call it hypin yourself up, I call it street dreamin
I do it for all the haters, the players roll with the gators
They lookin forward to favors, gossip is all they gave us
You niggaz wasn't quiet, meet the whales and the fishes
You leak the precinct up, play tattletale with the snitches
Even my momma knows, I got all kind of hoes
They wait outside of shows strict after the diner close
I'll get designer clothes, without the wine or rose
Take off my baby blue mink, and Carolina vogues
come here, take a look inside a entertainer's closet
I never trust a bitch, I blame Lorena Bobbitt
Niggaz stay in pocket, I know you're mad at me
But shit ain't all peaches and cream, and I ain't Sara Lee
Bitch!

[Chorus]
Don't ice me, you starin at the wrong one
It's a lot of girls here, go and get a grown one
We at the bar poppin bottles 'til they all gone
If you ain't leavin here with us, you can walk home
Cause someone else will, they know how we ride
If you a playboy, you got one on the Eastside
Keep your mouth closed, we don't let the beef ride

.. (what) right .. (what) right .. (what) right .. (right, damn!)
(Let's go)

[Verse Two]
I do this for the hood, niggaz stuck in the slammer
I smile cause I'm good, you act tough for the camera
Run from the lil' kids, they fuckin with Santa
Cause they like 2Pac more - word?  Word to my grandma
I figure I might as well leave here with my glock drawn
Cause they'll take to jail, even when you're not wrong
Dawg you're not this flashy, jux you got to blast me
Every rock is classy nobody on your block can match me
You shouldn't want a fight, unless you want to fight
for your life in the hospital a hundred nights
I know your type, run behind your girl rushin
You call it quality time, I call it handcuffin
I'm on a beach in Miami, so you ain't reachin my family
All weekend with panties from Puetro Rican Cammie
You niggaz wasn't tough, I shoulda snapped two flicks
You wore your pants tight, played pitty-pat with the chicks
Even my father knows, where the revolver goes
I bring the beef to your front door like dominoes
And my diamonds froze, that mean my time is froze
Me in the club from when it's poppin 'til the time it close
Half of these so-called real niggaz'll probably sing
Nah I ain't pullin over, learned that from Rodney King
So tell your homey chill, you know I hold the steel
Everything be jabs and hooks, and you ain't Holyfield
Nigga!

[Chorus]

Everybody on the left get yo' hands up
Everybody on the right get yo' hands up
Everybody up front get yo' hands up
And everybody out back get yo' hands up
And if you in here with a strap get yo' hands up
Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!) Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!)
Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!) Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!)
Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!) Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!)
... man fuck what he said man, put 'em up!
Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!) Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!)
Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!) Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!)
Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!) Now put 'em up! (Put 'em up!)

Lloyd Banks," 

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

I done learned from mistakes like who's my men, and who's not
Like who's gone run, but who's not
Like who's gone shoot if you shot
Who gone hold it and who's not
Who gone change spots

[Chorus]
In the streets of New York, you can't trust nobody
Niggaz'll run up on you with a 12-gauge shotty
Loyalty comes free, smokin' weed is my hobby
You want to rob me, you gotta leave here with a body
In the streets of New York, You can't trust nobody
Niggaz'll run up on you with a 12-gauge shotty
Loyalty comes free, smokin' weed is my hobby
You want to rob me, you gotta leave here with a body

[Verse 1]
When I was ten years old, I seen a nigga take three in the head
Probably around the same time he used to pee in the bed
I stayed awake, cause my nightmares was seein' 'em dead
Smelled the burnt tires peelin' after leavin' him lead
The killer fled, with a fuckin' laugh
My heart pumpin' on blast
I just started at him, slumped in the grass
Arms movin', fingers shakin', spittin' up blood
DNA mixed in the mud, another ditch to be dug
There I stood, stiffer than wood
See homey used to buy me candy
Now he's gone, who gone provide his family?
My earring, shoulda been runnin'
I never thought I'd be that sick
Damn, I wasn't 'posed to see that shit
That's when I thought
It was more than three shots
He coulda been waitin for me, maybe he circled around the block
I turned around at my pops, he like ""what happened?""
This nigga rolled up and just started clappin'
I can still hear him laughin'
[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
It was a regular day in South Side, sprinklers and kids runnin'
All of a sudden, head's turnin', somebody did somethin'
This nigga named, I forgot, fuck it, he lived around the block
Regular gettin' money nigga, but loved to clown a lot
Walked across the park, stuntin', frontin'
Diamonds in his ear, diamond watch on
Eatin' a bag of popcorn
Walked up behind a shorty, grabbin' her waist
She pushed him away, so he threw the bag in her face
She felt disrespected, shorty couldn't accept it
Called him a pussy, told him she'd be back in a second
But he din't pay her no mind
Called her a bitch about four times
Stayed in the park, wit' no niggaz wit' em and no nine
And them in no time, older nigga from behind
Swung a baseball bat, left his face all crack
Told him ""take all that""
Hit him again, popped his chain wit' a frown
And left the clown, with a stain on the ground

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
All my days go by blowin' that sticky, icky
California made me picky
Chicken head tried to stick me wit' a hickey
If we, blow up quickly, stickly, somewhere tipsy
The location don't matter, I'm South Side until' they hit me
I'll be DEAD
If looks can kill, I'm from the ghetto boys
But I don't know Scarface, I push wit' bill
My heart spills
For the kids that ain't got nothin' ain't got it still
And for my, cousin I lost
Humped over the steerin' wheel

[Chorus]",South Side Story,2004
Lloyd Banks,"Remix, Lloyd banks, ha ha

It's like a throne that he don't even own
He won't sit down, give him a crown, he just throws it around
It's like a joke, he's like a king, but he don't rule a thing
He don't want the diamonds, want the gold, don't want the jewelery

He don't want the fame, don't want the loot, he's in it for the sport
Runnin' circles 'round his competition on the court
He appreciates your support but he ain't beggin' for it
And you can love it, you can hate it but you can't ignore it

You can't be that ignorant but you can try to sell him short
But you can't fuck with his last joint or the one before it
And he was born to raise hell like them country boys
And if I'm frontin' then you better come confront me for it

This is the story of a warrior and now you know it
True warriors go ahead make some noise
It ain't healthy to be makin' niggaz paranoid
Hit your corner with my weapon I don't need my boyz

I'm doin' a hundred twenty on the fast lane
Kick back, just relax, let me do my thang
Don't give a fuck about you sucka's gotta maintain, yeah
Money, power and respect in this rap game

He's straight out of a neighborhood where niggaz hate
They see you go and eat your dinner off a bigger plate
Your stomach's ache while he's loungin' at the big estate
And he hops in a hundred thousand with a nigga's skate

House's with just a bigger gate, houndin' him is a big mistake
He won't surrender, he'd rather give up a rib to break
'Cuz he remembers when they wouldn't lend a helpin' hand
So he was sittin' on green like a Celtic fan

Created a buzz so that you gotta mention his name
When you discussin' the illest playa that's in the game
And he's ridin' with Em, 50 Cent, Doc and them
G Unit records ain't no motherfuckin' stoppin' them

This is the story of a warrior and now you know it
True warriors go ahead make some noise
It ain't healthy to be makin' niggaz paranoid
Hit you're corner with my weapon, I don't need my boyz

I'm doin' a hundred twenty on the fast lane
Kick back, just relax, let me do my thang
Don't give a fuck about you sucka's gotta maintain
Money, power and respect in this rap game

He's no magician man, he can't make sometin' outta nuttin'
So now niggaz from his hood act like he owe 'em somethin'
They talk crazy 'til he send niggaz to where they buck 'em
Ask 'em if it's a problem and he'll say na it's nothin'

He's was gonna help 'em out, but since they fronted, fuck 'em
He don't care how they feel they can hate 'em or love 'em
He hold his own on his own the kid is really thuggin'
He's rich now, he ain't changed so niggaz think he buggin'

He bulletproof everything 'cuz niggaz try to buck him
Keep two pistols on his hip, I'll show you where he tuck 'em
Niggaz say they gon' get at him but they can't touch him
Try to catch 'em slippin', they creepin' and start bustin'

This is the story of a warrior and now you know it
True warriors go ahead make some noise
It ain't healthy to be makin' niggaz paranoid
Hit your corner with my weapon, I don't need my boyz

I'm doin' a hundred on the fast lane
Kick back, just relax, let me do my thang
Don't give a fuck about you sucka's gotta maintain
Money, power and respect in this rap game

I can give you niggaz somethin' you can talk about
I can turn you're smile upside down
You ain't no G, you're a fuckin' clown
I can take your girl a turn and turn her out

Don't hold it in, let it all out
I can give you fuckas somethin' to be mad about
Invite her in, send her back out
With my DNA all in her mouth

You handcuffin' that bitch, she don't wanna be wit'chu
All she want is your chips, my lil' nigga beat it too
Sneak the heaters through, so we can party good

The buddha is purple, be rude and I hurt you

Stadiums clubs, ladies and thugs, the hood to the burbs
I'm on the red carpet 'cause I'm good with my words
I'm ready for war and stackin' my chips, you flappin' your lips

Ridin 'round with my niggaz, hand crushin' that 'dro

50 made me a star, now they know who we are
Out on top of the charts, your condo is my car
Income is my chain, stashbox is my watch
I'm fairly new in the game, I ain't passin' the rock

All I'm sensin' is hate, ever since I been straight
'Cause they stuck in the hood, hand crumbs on they plate
And I'm strappin' the nine, in case they wanna combine
Gather up on a nigga, I ain't rappin' no line

Keep your eye on your money, stop eyeballin' mine
You drop somethin' every year, flop all of the time
Stop makin' your records, I ain't answerin' shit
Why don't you get off my dick?

All money ain't good money, this i know
But i still love hood money, it gets my dough
And as a youngster, that nigga went through so much church
That still turned out fucked up, i did so much dirt
Told to bang the neighbourhood, i put in so much work
Did a whole lot of time, caused mom so much hurt
On everythang, that boy wasn't done on purpose
Who knew that all my darkness was really gon' surface
I was stuck on that bullshit jus runnin' the streets
Without some type of beef, the week wasn't complete
Its like a nigga felt better after dumpin this heat
On feet, just to see the body slumped in the seat
Its like a whole 'nother rush to me, bussin' was sweet
Now im smarter, im all about something to eat
Im on the road spend 30 days a month in the suite
But im still gon' hustle and cheat, Lets Go Now!

Yeah, uh
Now walkin down the block without your weapon
Its a first class ticket to a lesson (uh huh)
I first cast tickets to perfection, me and Ben got a connection (yeah)
That's why i bring the Benz out to impress him (yeah)
Caught in my zone, all alone, homes rattlin' my bones
Cuz he yappin' off his lips and if i hit him i be wrong
Cuz he ain't never gon' be shit, i done work so hard
But i will make you a corn of the cob, you be performin for God
Either that or rob you on your boulevard
Bet you never thought for a second niggas would pull your cards
I don't know about y'all star, cuz my nigga gone
H.P tatted on me so his memory lives on
Engagin in drama without your llama
There'll be funeral arrangements for your momma
I learnd that when i was in pajamas watchin Micheal and Madonna
Now i got the appetite of a piranna, nigga

When nobody knows all the walls you go through
You can't even talk to those that supposedly know you
Some of the levels that these people'll go to, for crumbs
Damn tell me, is this what that dough do?
That's when you find yourself talkin to Pro Two
There's not to many people who ever can walk in Loc shoes
Its good as hell that my heart contains
I explain, so many different parts of pain
Im clean, but still some marks remain
From the past, when that crushed weed sparks to brang
The cash made some people start to change
I feel hate when i pulled up and parked the range
Ya damn right i got rich, but my heart the same
And practice makes perfect with the harder aim
You ain't really got the heart to bang
You ain't start to hang, till you find out I cought the chain..

A millionaire that won't spend a dollar on a ho
I'm still in here tryin to get a model out the do'
High blowin bottle after bottle of that dro
Slidin on the road, groupie in my vehicle that I don't even know
And If I wasn't Banks shorty probably wouldn't roll
From the Benz to the lobby from the lobby to the do'
If you ain't with the program ma you gotta go

Fo' Fo' beside me, hoes know to find me
Wherever there's money, yeah I'm the shit honey (WOO!!!)
Hood nigga with the rubberband grip money
If I go broke I make you and your man strip dummy
Yeah nigga, you don't want it with them their bigger
Cross us, your on somethin we bare niggas

Freeze up and you'll end up in your lawn
It's the protege of 50, inspired by Biggie
Burns more than Ziggy, them lil' niggas dig me
I been stressed out lately, so I'm smokin more than ever
Dead smack in the hood good pokin out my leather

'Cause were always focused we move around with the toasters
Push the rock to the smokers, warnin do not approach us
We in the club with the pokers steppin in Gucci Loafers
Stuntin in Testerossas, stylin in front of vultures
Ma quickly to call us, baddest bitches they know us
After the show they blow us, and do all type of shit to us
Now I can speak for me 'cause me everywhere I be
Niggas know I'm a G, got it locked got the keys
We move from bundles to D sippin on Hennessy
Buck rollin the trees, Banks countin the cheese
We get the paper then breeze, nigga we overseas
You stuck in the hood, aw that ain't good
Different town, different tour, different telly, different whore
Triple X, wet sex, who's next, latex
Condom, condo, I'm tight my money long though
You lookin for a drink bitch I ain't what you lookin for

Some G-Unit shoes, body full of tatooes
'Bout to stomp me a bitch, put the pump to his lips
Tell him talk that shit, now y'all wanna trip

I make it hot 

{Lloyd} 
Olivia, let's go 
What's up ladies, I'm back baby 
The boy wonder got the club goin' crazy 
I'm two-steppin' in my armor, in my 80 
But I ain't in the VIP unless they pay me 
It's like I practice stuntin' 
Ma, I have ya mattress jumpin' 
And I know it sounds like I'm frontin' but I ain't 
Jerk, jerk ya body and work, work 'em proudly 
Go and hurt somebody if I don't hit that 
If you don't see 'em with me don't ask 'bout 50 
'Cause if he was here he'd be standing right here 
And if you don't care so much about my fame 
Then why you keep starin' at my chain 
I'm doin' my thing 
From the club to the telly on a late night 
Box of Magnums, sippin' Henn, finna get right 
Checkout time ain't 'til daylight 
From the club to the telly on a late night 

{Olivia} 
Ooh babe, you know I like it when you feel on me 
Pullin' on my waste, I'm feelin' energy 
Gettin' kinda hard to keep ya hands off me{Yeah, right there} 
So slide a little lower, put ya hands on my thigh 
Maybe I know you like it if that's right 
I'ma show you how to make it last all night 
Now let me see you shake it 

{Chorus}: 
Twist it, shake it, bend but don't break it 
Work that body, gettin' so crazy 
Don't hurt nobody up in this party 
Twist it, shake it, bend but don't break it 
Twist it, shake it, bend but don't break it 
Work that body, gettin' butt-naked 
Don't hurt nobody up in this party 
Twist it, shake it, bend but don't break it 

Mix a little hypno with some Hennessey 
Like the way this jig goes when it goes through me 
Think I need to stop because I'm feelin' tipsy 
{One more drink} 
Baby now I can't stop 'cause I'm in the zone 
Shorty keep it comin' boy, I'm grown 
I don't want to finish this dance alone 
Ooh I want to see ya 

{Chorus} 
Row, row, row down low, shake it fast for me 
Work your body, don't hurt nobody up in this party 
Now let me see ya 
Row, row, row down low, shake it fast for me 
Work your body, don't hurt nobody up in this party 
Now let me see ya

Lloyd Banks,"Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh huh

Comin' up I was confused, my mommy kissin' a girl
Confusion occurs comin' up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out commitin' felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, ""Check check out My Melody""
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin', niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothin' good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me

I told Dre from the gate ""I'd carry the heat for ya""
First mixtape song I inherited beef for ya
Gritted my teeth for ya, G-G-G-G for ya
Put Compton on my back when you was in need of soldiers
At my last show I threw away my N.W.A. gold
I had the whole crowd yellin ""Free Yayo!""
So niggas better get up outta mine
For I creep and turn your projects into Columbine
And I'm rap's MVP
Don't make me remind y'all what happened in D.C
This nigga ain't Gotti, he pretend
Mad at us 'cause Ashanti got a new boyfriend
And it seems your lil' rat turned out to be a mouse
This beef shit is for the birds and the birds fly South
Even Young Buck can vouch, when the doubts was out
Who gave the West coast mouth-to-mouth? (Hahaha)

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me

From the beginnin' to the end, losers lose, winners win
This is real we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in, is full of pressure and pain
I thought it would change, it's stayin' the same

How many of them boys is witcha'
When you had that little TV you had to hit on to get a picture
I'm walking with a snub, 'cause niggas do a lot of slick talkin'
In the club 'til they coughin' on the rug
Ain't never had much but a Walkman and a bud
My role model is gone snortin' up his drug
Bad enough they want me to choke, my boy just got poked in the throat
Now it's an RIP shirt in my coat
Now I'm speedin', reminiscin'
Holdin' my weed in, never listen
If I see him I'ma lift 'em
And maybe that'll even the score
But if not, it'll be me on the floor

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me

I started out at 15, scared as hell
I took 30 off a pack and I made them sales
As a youth, man I used to hustle for loot
With that lil' deuce-deuce and my triple fat goose
Sippin' Easy Jesus, rockin' a Alesis
My momma whipped me when she found my pieces
I look back on life and thank God I'm blessed
We the best on the planet so forget the rest

You know I'm still nice with my cook game
Look man, it's a hood thang; that's why I'm loved in Brook-lyn
I handle mine just like a real nigga should
If I do some time homey, I'm still all good
Let me show you what a thug 'bout, born to die
I took the bullets outta 50 put 'em in my fo'-five
And I ain't even got my feet wet yet
A seven figure nigga who ain't seen a worthy check

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
