Mike Robinson,"Va savoir c'est peut-être ça l'amour
Une lettre froissée, un disque rayé
Qui tournera encore pendant des années
Même s'il est usé
Va savoir c'est peut-être ça la vie
Battements de secondes, minutes de plaisir
Et des heures encore à s'appartenir
Même si le temps gronde
Et si le hasard un jour nous sépare
Faudra surtout pas lui en vouloir
Même quand tout va bien
Pourquoi toujours penser a demain
Allez viens
Va savoir c'est peut-être notre histoire
Si j'pleure c'est pour rire
Juste pour te dire
Que tu m'as laissé
Comme un goût de miel
Pour l'éternité, babe",Va Savoir,1999
Mike Robinson,"Qui ose dire qu'il peut m'apprendre les sentiments
Ou me montrer ce qu'il faut faire pour être grand
Qui peut changer ce que je porte dans mon sang

Qui a le droit de m'interdire d'être vivant
De quel côté se trouvent les bons ou les méchants
Leurs évangiles ont fait de moi un non-croyant

La vie ne m'apprend rien
Je voulais juste un peu parler, choisir un train
La vie ne m'apprend rien
J'aimerai tellement m'accrocher, prendre un chemin
Prendre un chemin

Mais je n'peux pas, je n'sais pas
Et je reste planté là
Les lois ne font plus les hommes
Mais quelques hommes font la loi
Et je n'peux pas, je n'sais pas
Et je reste planté là

À ceux qui croient que mon argent endort ma tête
Je dis qu'il ne suffit pas d'être pauvre pour être honnête
Ils croient peut-être que la liberté s'achète

Que reste-t-il des idéaux sous la mitraille
Quand les prêcheurs sont à l'abri de la bataille
La vie des morts n'est plus sauvée par des médailles

La vie ne m'apprend rien
Je voulais juste un peu parler, choisir un train
La vie ne m'apprend rien
J'aimerai tellement m'accrocher, prendre un chemin
Prendre un chemin

Mais je n'peux pas, je n'sais pas
Et je reste planté là
Les lois ne font plus les hommes
Mais quelques hommes font la loi
Et je n'peux pas, je n'sais pas
Et je reste planté là

Je n'peux pas, je n'sais pas
Et je reste planté là
Les lois ne font plus les hommes
Mais quelques hommes font la loi
Et je n'peux pas, je n'sais pas
Et je reste planté là

Mike Rofé,"Maybe it's been too long for me
Maybe I'm too far gone
I'm not looking for sympathy
But I know something's gotta be wrong

Remind me now what it means to kneel
Get me out of the way
I'm learning still that your love is real
You've proven it's not a charade

I don't know how much I can take
Mighty fences are slipping away

You slowly break me down
You slowly turn me around
I'm learning how to live, I'm learning how to love
Now that you're here slowly showing me how

How do you say the things you say?
Do you really think I can change?
You love me with so much abandon
And you move in me with such grace

I am finally coming awake
Mighty fences are fading away

You slowly break me down
You slowly turn me around
I'm learning how to live, I'm learning how to love
Now that you're here slowly showing me

What I would be if I never let you in
What I would be if I am giving up my skin
What I would be if I let you in

You slowly break me down
You slowly turn me around

You slowly break me down
You slowly turn me around
I'm learning how to live, I'm learning how to love
Now that you're here slowly showing me how",Slowly,2006
Mike Rogers,"Every limbo boy and girl
All around the limbo world
Gonna do the limbo rock

All around the limbo clock
Hey, let's do the limbo rock

Limbo lower now
Limbo lower now

Mike Rubin,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me","Lover, Come Back to Me",2000
Mike Rud,"How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?

Mike Rud,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,1997
Mike Rud,"It's not the pale moon that excites me 
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
It's just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
It's just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,1997
Mike Rud,"The shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow of Your Smile,1997
Mike Rud,"I'll be seeing you in all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces all day through
In that small cafe, the park across the way
The children's carousel, 
The chestnut trees, the wishing well

I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I'll find you in the morning' sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you
I'll find you in the morning sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you",I'll Be Seeing You,2007
Mike Rupert,"There's a certain girl I've been in love with a long, long time.

Mike Russell,"Tell us what to do black-eyed Susan
Should I leave you where I found you
Or take you back to him
We first met at night that's why we were never friends
Tell us what to do black-eyed Susan

This is gonna be a dark road
We bother believed ion something, had it taken from them
You'll want to forget about this road
Till it reached inside your pockets

Tell us what to do black-eyed Susan
There's a top writer from a business college
That once paid for our home and spoon collection
Tell us what to do black-eyed Susan

This is gonna be a dark road
We both believed in something, had it taken from them
You'll want to forget about this road
Till it reached inside your pockets

Mike Rutherford,"The scattered pages of a book by the sea 
Held by the sand, washed by the waves 
A shadow forms cast by a cloud
Skimming by as eyes of the past
But the rising tide absorbs them, effortlessly claiming

They told of one who tired of all 
Singing ""Praise him, praise him"" 
""We heed not flatterers,"" he cried
""By our command, waters retreat
Show my power, halt at my feet"" 
But the cause was lost, now cold winds blow

Far from the north, overcast ranks advance 
Fear of the storm accusing with rage and scorn
The waves surround the sinking throne 
Singing ""Crown him, crown him"" 
""Those who love our majesty, 
Show themselves!"", all bent their knee

But he forced a smile even though his hopes 
Lay dashed where offerings fell
Where they fell

""Nothing can my peace destroy
As long as none smile""
More opened ears and opened eyes
And soon they dared to laugh

See a little man with his face turning red 
Though his story's often told you can tell he's dead",Can-Utility and the Coastliners,1972
Mike Rutherford,"Get 'em out by Friday
You don't get paid 'til the last one's well on his way
Get 'em out by Friday
It's important that we keep to schedule, there must be no delay 

I represent a firm of gentlemen who recently purchased this 
House and all the others in the road
In the interest of humanity we've found a better place for you 
To go, go-woh, go-woh

Oh no, this I can't believe
Oh Mary, they're asking us to leave

Get 'em out by Friday
I've told you before, 's good many gone if we let them stay
And if it isn't easy
You can squeeze a little grease and our troubles will soon run away

After all this time, they ask us to leave
And I told them we could pay double the rent
I don't know why it seemed so funny
Seeing as how they'd take more money
The Winkler called again, he came here this morning
With four hundred pounds and a photograph of the place he has found
A block of flats with central heating 
I think we're going to find it hard 

Now we've got them
I've always said that cash cash cash can do anything well 
Work can be rewarding 
When a flash of intuition is a gift that helps you excel-sell-sell-sell

Here we are in Harlow New Town 
Did you recognize your block across the square, over there 
Sadly since last time we spoke
We've found we've had to raise the rent again
Just a bit

Oh no, this I can't believe 
Oh Mary, and we agreed to leave

This is an announcement from Genetic Control
It is my sad duty to inform you of a four foot restriction on 
Humanoid height 

I hear the directors of Genetic Control have been buying all the 
Properties that have recently been sold, taking risks oh so bold
It's said now that people will be shorter in height
They can fit twice as many in the same building site
They say it's alright
Beginning with the tenants of the town of Harlow
In the interest of humanity, they've been told they must go
Told they must go-go-go-go

I think I've fixed a new deal 
A dozen properties, we'll buy at five and sell at thirty four 
Some are still inhabited
It's time to send the Winkler to see them
He'll have to work some more

With land in your hand, you'll be happy on earth 
Then invest in the Church for your heaven",Get 'Em Out by Friday,1972
Mike Rutherford,"Walking across the sitting-room, I turn the television off
Sitting beside you, I look into your eyes
As the sound of motorcars fades in the night time
I swear I saw your face change, it didn't seem quite right
And it's hello babe, with your guardian eyes so blue 
Hey my baby, don't you know our love is true

Coming closer with our eyes, a distance falls around our bodies
Out in the garden, the moon seems very bright
Six saintly shrouded men move across the lawn slowly
The seventh walks in front with a cross held high in hand
And it's hey babe your supper's waiting for you
Hey my baby, don't you know our love is true?

I've been so far from here
Far from your warm arms
It's good to feel you again
It's been a long long time
Hasn't it? 

I know a farmer who looks after the farm
With water clear, he cares for all his harvest
I know a fireman who looks after the fire

You, can't you see he's fooled you all
Yes, he's here again
Can't you see he's fooled you all?
Share his peace, sign the lease
He's a supersonic scientist
He's the guaranteed eternal sanctuary man
Look, look into my mouth he cries
And all the children lost down many paths
I bet my life you'll walk inside 
Hand in hand
Gland in gland 
With a spoonful of miracle
He's the guaranteed eternal sanctuary
We will rock you, rock you little snake
We will keep you snug and warm

Wearing feelings on our faces while our faces took a rest
We walked across the fields to see the children of the West
But we saw a host of dark skinned warriors standing still below the ground

Waiting for battle

The fight's begun, they've been released
Killing foe for peace, bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang
And they've given me a wonderful potion
'Cause I cannot contain my emotion
And even though I'm feeling good
Something tells me I'd better activate my prayer capsule

Today's a day to celebrate, the foe have met their fate
The order for rejoicing and dancing has come from our warlord

Wandering in the chaos the battle has left
We climb up the mountain of human flesh
To a plateau of green grass, and green trees full of life
A young figure sits still by a pool
He's been stamped ""Human Bacon"" by some butchery tool
He is you

Social Security took care of this lad
We watch in reverence, as Narcissus is turned to a flower
A flower? 

If you go down to Willow Farm
To look for butterflies, flutterbyes, gutterflies
Open your eyes, it's full of surprise
Everyone lies like the fox on the rocks
And the musical box
Oh, there's Mum and Dad, and good and bad
And everyone's happy to be here

There's Winston Churchill dressed in drag
He used to be a British flag, plastic bag, what a drag
The frog was a prince
The prince was a brick, the brick was an egg, the egg was a bird 
(Fly away you sweet little thing, they're hard on your tail) 
Hadn't you heard? (they're going to change you into a human being!) 
Yes, we're happy as fish and gorgeous as geese
And wonderfully clean in the morning

We've got everything, we're growing everything
We've got some in, we've got some out 
We've got some wild things floating about 
Everyone, we're changing everyone
You name them all, we've had them here
And the real stars are still to appear
(All change!) 

Feel your body melt
Mum to mud to mad to dad 
Dad diddley office, Dad diddley office
You're all full of ball
Dad to dam to dumb to mum 
Mum diddley washing, Mum diddley washing
You're all full of ball

Let me hear your lies, we're living this up to the eyes
Ooh, aah, na-na-na 
Momma I want you now

And as you listen to my voice
To look for hidden doors, tidy floors, more applause
You've been here all the time
Like it or not, like what you got
You're under the soil (the soil, the soil)
Yes, deep in the soil (the soil, the soil, the soil!)
So we'll end with a whistle and end with a bang 
And all of us fit in our places

With the guards of Magog, swarming around
The Pied Piper takes his children underground
Dragons coming out of the sea
Shimmering silver head of wisdom looking at me
He brings down the fire from the skies
You can tell he's doing well by the look in human eyes
Better not compromise, it won't be easy

666 is no longer alone
He's getting out the marrow in your backbone
And the seven trumpets blowing sweet rock and roll
Gonna blow right down inside your soul
Pythagoras with the looking glass reflects the full moon
In blood, he's writing the lyrics of a brand-new tune

And it's hey babe, with your guardian eyes so blue
Hey my baby, don't you know our love is true?
I've been so far from here, far from your loving arms
Now I'm back again
And babe, it's gonna work out fine

Can't you feel our souls ignite?
Shedding ever-changing colours
In the darkness of the fading night
Like the river joins the ocean
As the germ in a seed grows 
We have finally been freed to get back home

There's an angel standing in the sun
And he's crying with a loud voice
""This is the supper of the mighty one""
Lord of Lords, King of Kings
Has returned to lead his children home
To take them to the new Jerusalem",Supper's Ready,1972
Mike Rutherford,"A carved oak table, 
Tells a tale 
Of times when kings and queens sipped wine from goblets gold, 
And the brave would lead their ladies from out of the room to arbors cool. 

A time of valor, and legends born 
A time when honor meant much more to a man than life 
And the days knew only strife to tell right from wrong 
Through lance and sword. 

Why, why can we never be sure till we die 
Or have killed for an answer, 
Why, why do we suffer each race to believe 
That no race has been grander 
It seems because through time and space 
Though names may change each face retains the mask it wore. 

A dusty table 
Musty smells 
Tarnished silver lies discarded upon the floor 
Only feeble light descends through a film of grey 
That scars the panes. 
Gone the carving, 
And those who left their mark, 
Gone the kings and queens now only the rats hold sway 
And the weak must die according to nature's law 
As old as they. 

Why, why can we never be sure till we die 
Or have killed for an answer, 
Why, why do we suffer each race to believe

Mike Rutherford,"Watcher of the skies watcher of all 
His is a world alone no world is his own, 
He whom life can no longer surprise, 
Raising his eyes beholds a planet unknown. 

Creatures shaped this planet's soil, 
Now their reign has come to an end, 
Has life again destroyed life, 
Do they play elsewhere, do they know 
More than their childhood games? 
Maybe the lizard's shed its tail, 
This is the end of man's long union with Earth. 

Judge not this race by empty remains 
Do you judge God by his creatures when they are dead? 
For now, the lizard's shed it's tail 
This is the end of man's long union with Earth. 

From life alone to life as one,

You've got to go faster than that to get to the top. 
Dirty old mountain 
All covered in smoke, she can turn you to stone 
So you better start doing it right 
Better start doing it right. 

You're halfway up and you're halfway down 
And the pack on your back is turning you around. 
Throw it away, you won't need it up there, and remember 
You don't look back whatever you do. 
Better start doing it right.

Mike Rutherford,"When you're asleep they may show you 
Aerial views of the ground, 
Freudian slumber empty of sound.

Fields of incentive covered with green. 

Mesmerized children are playing, 
Meant to be seen but not heard,

Sometimes entangled in your own dreams.

Soon as you're tired and ill.

Mike Rutherford,"Mad Man Moon
Was it summer when the river ran dry, 
Or was it just another dam. 
When the evil of a snowflake in June 
Could still be a source of relief. 
O how I love you, I once cried long ago, 
But I was the one who decided to go. 
To search beyond the final crest, 
Though I'd heard it said just birds could dwell so high. 

So I pretended to have wings for my arms 
And took off in the air. 
I flew to places which the clouds never see, 
Too close to the deserts of sand, 
Where a thousand mirages, the shepherds of lies 
Forced me to land and take a disguise. 
I would welcome a horse's kick to send me back 
If I could find a horse not made of sand. 

If this desert's all there'll ever be 
Then tell me what becomes of me. 
A fall of rain? 
That must have been another of your dreams, 
A dream of mad man moon. 

Hey man, 
I'm the sand man. 
And boy have I news for you; 
They're gonna throw you in gaol 
And you know they can't fail 
'cause sand is thicker than blood. 
But a prison in sand 
Is a haven in hell, 
For a gaol can give you a goal 
[and a] goal can find you a role 
On a muddy pitch in Newcastle, 
Where it rains so much 
You can't wait for a touch 
Of sun and sand, sun and sand... 

Within the valley of shadowless death 
They pray for thunderclouds and rain, 
But to the multitude who stand in the rain 
Heaven is where the sun shines. 
The grass will be greener till the stems turn to brown 
And thoughts will fly higher till the earth brings them down.

To disbelieve the sea.

Mike Rutherford,"Blue girls come in every size
Some are wise and some otherwise
They got pretty blue eyes
For an hour a man may change
For an hour her face looks strange
Looks strange, looks strange

Marching to the promised land
Where the honey flows and takes you by the hand
Pulls you down on your knees
While you're down a pool appears
The face in the water looks up
And she shakes her head as if to say
That it's the last time you'll look like today

Sail away, away
Ripples never come back
Gone to the other side
Sail away, sail away

The face that launched a thousand ships
Is sinking fast, that happens you know
The water gets below
Seems not very long ago
Lovelier she was than any that I know

Angels never know it's time
To close the book and gracefully decline
The song has found a tale
My, what a jealous pool she is
The face in the water looks up
She shakes her head as if to say
That the blue girls have all gone away

Sail away, away
Ripples never come back
They've gone to the other side
Look into the pool
Ripples never come back
Dive to the bottom and go to the top
To see where they have gone
Oh, they've gone to the other side",Ripples,1976
Mike Rutherford,"The streets were deserted though the police were alerted
They considered the phone call a hoax
Furtively glancing the jauntily prancing
The youth caught the guards unaware

Slipping between them he ought to have seen the
The eyes and their owner so near
With torch shining bright he strode on in the night
Till he came to the room with the safe

""Hello son, I hope you're having fun""
""You've got it wrong Sir, I'm only the cleaner""
With that he fired, the other saying as he died
""You've done me wrong"", it's the same old song forever

Robbery, assault and battery
The felon and his felony

He picked up the diamonds and bundles of fivers
He pushed them well down in his sack
But the alarm had been sounded, he was completely surrounded

But he had some more tricks up his sleeve

""Come outside with your hands held high""
""You'll not get me alive Sir, I promise you that Sir""
With that he fired, the other saying as he died
""You've done me wrong"", it's the same old song forever

""I've got clean away but I'll be back some day
Just the combination will have changed
Some day they'll catch me, to a chain they'll attach me
But until that day I'll side the old crime wave

If they try to hold me for trial
I'll stay out of jail by paying my bail
And after I'll go to the court of appeal saying

Alive at both ends but a little dead in the middle, 
A-tumbling and a-bumbling he will go. 
All the king's horses and all the king's men 
Could never put a smile on that face. 

He's a sly one, he's a shy one 
Wouldn't you be too. 
Scared to be left all on his own. 
Hasn't a, hasn't a friend to play with, the ugly duckling 
The pressure on, the bubble will burst before our eyes. 
All the while in perfect time 
His tears are falling on the ground 
But if you don't stand up you don't stand a chance. 

Go a little faster now, you might get there in time. 

Mirror mirror on the wall, 
His heart was broken long before he ever came to you. 
Stop your tears from falling, 
The trail they leave is very clear for all to see at night 
All to see at night. 

In season, out of season 
What's the difference when you don't know the reason. 
In one hand bread, the other a stone. 
The hunter enters the forest. 
All are not huntsmen who can blow the huntsman's horn 
By the look of this one you've not got much to fear. 

Here I am, I'm very fierce and frightening 
Come to match my skill to yours. 
Now listen here, listen to me, don't you run away now 
I am a friend, I'd really like to play with you. 
Making noises my little furry friend would make 
I'll trick him, then I'll kick him into my sack. 
You better watch out you better watch out. 

I've got you, I've got you, you'll never get away. 

Walking home that night 
The sack across my back, the sound of sobbing on my shoulder. 
When suddenly it stopped, 
I opened up the sack, all that I had 
A pool of bubbles and tears - just a pool of tears. 

All in all you are a very dying race 
Placing trust upon a cruel world. 
You never had the things you thought you should have had

Mike Rutherford,"Bored of the life on the city of gold 
He'd left and let nobody know. 
Gone were the towers he had known from a child, 
Alone with the dream of a life 
He traveled the wide open road, 
The blinkered arcade, 
In search of another to share in his life. 
Nowhere. 
Everyone looked so strange to him. 

They've got no horns and they've got no tail 
They don't even know of our existence. 
Am I wrong to believe in a city of gold 
That lies in the deep distance, he cried 

And wept as they led him away to a cage 
Beast that can talk, read the sign. 
The creatures they pushed and they prodded his frame 
And questioned his story again. 
But soon they grew bored of their prey 
Beast that can talk? 
More like a freak or publicity stunt. 
Oh 
No. 

They've got no horns and they've got no tail 
They don't even know of our existence. 
Am I wrong to believe in a city of gold 
That lies in the deep distance, he cried 

And broke down the door of the cage and marched on out. 
He grabbed a creature by the scruff of his neck, pointing out: 
There, beyond the bounds of you weak imagination 
Lie the noble towers of my city, bright and gold. 
Let me take you there, show you a living story 
Let me show you others such as me 
Why did I ever leave? 

They've got no horns and they've got no tail 
They don't even know of our existence 
Am I wrong to believe in a city of gold 
That lies in the deep distance, he cried 
And wept. 

And so we set out with the best and his horns 
And his crazy description of home. 
After many days journey we came to a peak 
Where the beast gazed abroad and cried out. 
We followed his gaze and we thought that maybe we saw 
A spire of gold - no, a trick of the eye that's all, 
But the beast was gone and a voice was heard: 

They've got no horns and they've got no tail 
They don't even know of our existence 
Am I wrong to believe in a city of gold 
That lies in the deep distance

Burning in my blood like it's setting me fire.

And I feel like a cloud is closing in, I know it is

Sooner or later moonshine in my brain
Turning me around till there's madness in the air.

Turning water into wine, till there's nothing left to burn

I know they are.  I've got to try to find the door
Sooner or later it will turn me inside out
Begone all those who would torment me
I've an answer for you now.

And I'm glad it's not late to give it up, I know it's not
All I need's a year or two to rearrange, to rearrange

There must be some kind of mistake
I waited in the rain for hours
You were late

Now it's not like me to say the right thing
But you could've called to let me know
I checked your number twice, don't understand it
So I went home

Well I'd been waiting for this weekend
I thought that maybe we could see a show
Never dreamed I'd have this feeling
But seeing you is believing
That's why I don't know why
You didn't show up that night

There must be some kind of mistake
I was waiting in the rain for hours

I rang your home but got no answer

Mike Schmid,"Well winter came and went
But your heart was frozen over and it never thawed again
I know he hurt you, cut you deep
And you can feel me in your daze and in your dreams
And all the scars he gave, in seasons they could fade away
Where you can live them out again and again
But after all that you've been through
There is nothing left of you
Everything within, without, withdrew, withdrew, oh

No one can touch you now, you've hidden away your heart
No one can touch you now, it's safer where you are
If I can't get through your doubt, I'll find a way around
'Cause no one can touch you now, you've hidden away your heart

Well the summer chased away the storm
But your heart is frozen over so you cannot feel the warmth
I won't hurt you, can't you see
But you still feel him in your daze and in your dreams
And all the scars he gave, in seasons they would fade away
Where you can live them out again and again
But after all that you've been through
There is nothing left of you
Everything within, without, withdrew

No one can touch you now, you've hidden away your heart
No one can touch you now, it's safer where you are
If I can't get through your doubt, I'll find a way around

Overlooking Findhorn Bay
Cluny Hill in the distance
Summer on the way

Blue skies and sailing boats
Like a picture in a book
I can't believe I got here
Or how long it took

Living one step at a time
Putting one foot in front of the other
It sure feels right

Healing on my mind
Been a long way
Been a long way to the light

I'd made it to Manhattan
Built myself a nest
I meant to get right back to doing
Exactly what I do best

Plugging in an electric guitar
Leading a band
Well, if you want to give God a laugh
Tell him your plans

Summer in the city
Wilting in the heat
Buzzing up and down to Bearsville
And back to Hudson Street

I learned meditation
And how to visualize
Just breathing, being still
Never felt more alive

Living one step at a time
Putting one foot in front of the other
It sure feels right

Healing on my mind
Been a long way
Been a long way to the light

I spent the fall in transit
Circling the moon
Like a cat on a hot tin roof
Like a fiddle without a tune

I found what I was searching for
In Mrs. Caddy's book
I had to go there straightaway
Have myself a look

I flew back to Scotland
Anticipation in my bones
The old country welcoming me
Like a prodigal coming home

I knelt and kissed the tarmac
In the wild Atlantic rain
Felt the fiery Gaelic blood
Rising in my veins

Living one step at a time
Putting one foot in front of the other
It sure feels right

Healing on my mind
Been a long way
Been a long way to the light

I spent the night in Glasgow
Flew to Inverness
I found the place and at the first
I was not impressed

Nobody said hello
The faces left me cold
Back then how was I to know
All that would unfold?

I entered the Sanctuary
Heard the voice of a girl
Sending out a circle of light
Clear across the world

I shuddered in the Power
Like a seedling in a storm
I've been traveling to this place
Since the moment I was born

I flew back to New York City
Singing the big city blues
The sand of Findhorn Bay
Still clinging to my shoes

Tried to restart my life
But the life I knew was gone
I had to let go everything
But that's another song

Living one step at a time
Putting one foot in front of the other
It sure feels right

Healing on my mind
Been a long way
Been a long way to the light

So I'm sitting in my bedroom
Overlooking Findhorn Bay
Cluny Hill in the distance
Summer on the way

I'm watching the sailing boats
Bobbing to and fro
Time to hit the road
The only way I know

Putting one foot in front of the other
It sure feels right

There must be some word today
From my girlfriend so far away

Mike Sheridan,"You said hello and loneliness said goodbye then
It made me so glad that I almost had to cry then
I never believed in love at first sight
But when you held me tight that night
I knew with you it wasn't a lie

Oh my, my, my, my, my, my
What a sweet thing to do

Your soul was sweet your lips were warm and tender
I wanted your kiss I couldn't resist surrender
I could have sworn that violins played 
'Cause when the rhythm swayed with you so near
I heard the sound of your sigh

Oh my, my, my, my, my, my
What a sweet thing to do

I heard you sighin'
I felt like cryin'
You weren't lying
No no
What a sweet thing that was
And then I heard you whisper the word forever
I knew that we'd spend the rest of our lives together
That feeling we shared 
Was too much to bear
And when you said you cared, I swear
I felt that I was ready to die

Oh my, my, my, my, my, my
What a sweet thing that was

Do I follow my instincts blindly
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening
Do I sit here and try to stand it
Or do I try to catch them red-handed
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin
I make the right moves but I'm lost within
I put on my daily facade but then
I just end up getting hurt again

(Watching everything spin)
I can't look past
(Its starting over again)

If I turn my back I'm defenseless
And to go blindly seems senseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on
Then they'll take from me 'till everything is gone
If I let them go I'll be outdone
But if I try to catch them I'll be outrun
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer

Crawling in my skin

There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface...

Ah, Crawling in my skin, (Crawling in my skin)
These wounds, they will not heal... (Wound, they will not heal)
Fear is how I fall, (fear is how I fall)
Confusing... Confusing what is real...
Confusing what is real...

There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing,
This lack of self-control, I fear, is neverending.
Controlling, I can't seem
to find myself again. My walls are closing in...
(Without a sense of confidence, I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take.)
I've felt this way before, SO INSECURE!!!

Crawling in my skin,
these wounds, they will not heal.
Fear is how I fall,
Confusing what is real.

Discomfort, endlessly, has pulled itself upon me,
distracting, reacting,
Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection,
It's haunting, how I can't seem...
To find myself again, my walls are closing in.

There's nothing there to see
Nothing but my own mistakes
Staring back at me


Everything has to end, you'll soon find, we're outta time, left to watch it all unwhind
Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down
Everything has to end, you'll soon find, we're outta time, left to watch it all unwhind
Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down

I've lied
To you
This is the last smile
That I'll fake for the sake of being with you
(Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down)
(Everything has to end, you'll soon find, we're outta time, left to watch it all unwhind)
For sake of being with you
(Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down)
The sacrifice is never knowing

Why I stayed with you
Just push away
No matter what you see
You're still so blind to me


I've tried
Like you
To do everything you wanted to
This is the last time
I'll take the blame for the sake of being with you
(Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down)
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
(Everything has to end, you'll soon find, we're outta time, left to watch it all unwind)
The sacrifice is never knowing

Why I stayed with you
Just push away
No matter what you see
You're still so blind to me

Reverse phsycology's failing miserably
It's so hard to be, left all alone
Telling you is the only chance for me
there's nothing left but, to turn and face you
When I look into your eyes, there's nothing there to see
Nothing but my own mistakes staring back at me
Asking why...
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie (why)
The sacrifice is never knowing

Come crashing in
Into my little world
Painful to me
Pierce right through me

All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm 
Vows are spoken
To be broken
Feelings are intense
Words are trivial
Pleasures remain
So does the pain
Words are meaningless
And forgettable

New York to Cali, New Jersey to Crenshaw
Speak the gift while you bleed the fit
My team is sick, we eat, sleep and breathe this shit

Rough and rugged, kill 'em soft
We don't leave one standin' when we breakin' 'em off
Takin' a loss? Not a chance in your life
If being fresh is wrong, I don't wanna be right

Stop, drop and roll, we got soul
Safety popped off when we lock and load

If not for the jewels, I drop the chunky neck
I'm funky fresh equipped with a rusty tick
Am I the best? Well, I gotta put it bluntly, yes

You can't touch me, the flows'll get ya
Squeeze breath outta your chest like boa constrictors
I'm a killer and I usually know my victims
So I catch a lot of bodies on the homie system, uh

Don't get it twisted, I'll break your jaw
You'll be sippin' fried chicken through a crazy straw
Liquid diet, bitch, we official pirates
I ghost ride the ghost ship, drinkin' and drivin', yeah

You can find me at the gym, bench pressin' the weight
Gettin' diesel on that ass and I'm so disgustin'
I'ma tell the whole god dang globe to suck it

I'm bad, now you feelin' something surround you
My chemical mix, they got you pumpin' the Valium
The audience closed in and they had a reaction
Similar to explosions off of battery acid

My rhymes a razor, to slash your neck with
So findin' my trip past your neck or exit
Into the dungeon, what you bringin' a bucket?
No one's hearin' your screams, so start playin' the trumpet

I'm outta your reach now, so give me some rock a few
Hookin' a beat down and do the impossible
A couple of months later, the record was done
So you can check on the rep, yep, second to none

Mike Shinoda,"I was an outcast, outsider
Trouble-maker
A lost soul, outta control
In danger
Didn't have a care in the world
My feelings were numb
Never showing emotion
Is easy for some
I don't know how it happened
How I got to this point
But I needed a way out
I was stuck in a ploy
I needed another path or I'd self destruct
I was down on my luck
My head was so fucked
A menace rollin' the streets is what I was
Holdin' my heat and rollin' with the serious thugs
You couldn't tell me a thing
I was like my brother
Words went in one ear and out the other
Slangin' and bangin'
With a chip on my shoulder
An insane, hit the brain
Certified street soldier
So close to the grave
You at an early age
Can't tell you the price I've paid

[Chorus]
Oh, the sky overhead
Is like a canvas of gray
I dunno how much time
I'm beginnin' to save
From the first spring to light
To the end of the day
I'm just livin' my life
Till they come carry me away

I've been there in LA nights
In the block where I came up
My pops used to hate
When we hanged with them bangers
Guess he knew one day that we'll become us
That's just how it is when you live where we come from
Fight, don't run
Is the motto we live by
Get 'em on the ground
And stomp a mind about ten times
Sure we was just kids back then
I had no remorse for what we did back then
Six of us, one call, we'd all pack in
Hit the strip, and go and get the shit crackin'
Gun wars, and drug deals, I seen 'em happen
When I started losin' homeboys I wasn't laughin'
I looked all around and seen
None of 'em there
That's when I figured out
That nobody cared
If we lived or die
We'll just get high and ride
And I wasn't gonna let this happen one more time

[Chorus]

My mother would stand for me
Every step of the way
She did not judge me
She told me I'd win some day
When I was at my lowest
When I had no focus
She pulled me out the gutter
Said I wasn't hopeless
Every night she prayed for me
I was out on the street
Chillin' on the corner with the hand on my heat
Eyes open wide for the pigs and foes
It's an every day hazard when you hustle for doe
So many nights I didn't come home
She thought the worst
Maybe somebody shot me down
Without any remorse
Maybe I hurt somebody and I was stuck in a cell
Well, I regret all those times that I put her through hell
When I reflect back on those days, my heart aches
And everybody I lost or let down
I wish I could take it all back
And make it better, but I can't
So I try to make amends
And be there, through thick and thin

Somewhere far under the ocean waves
Up on a ledge I was looking down
It was far enough to keep me safe

And the waves are still breaking

No one's left to answer me

My inside's out, my left is right
My upside's down, my black is white

And wait for dawn, but there's no light

And my eyes were made sober
World was turned over
Washing out the lines I'd seen
And my heart is still breaking
Now that I awaken
No one's left to answer me

My inside's out, my left is right
My upside's down, my black is white
I hold my breath, and close my eyes
And wait for dawn, but there's no light

I'm a call without an answer
I'm a shadow in the dark

If there's some who like to trick, who like a chick
And +come out the pocket like Michael Vick+
Or some who want a patient man
....or go with a payment plan
...wanna go to department stores
Then they want the keys to your apartment door
Nowadays a girl'll come with a price tag
And give it up for nice shoes and a nice bag
+they must have bumped their head, give them an ice bag+
And I ain't thirst, but show em.....

[Chorus: Fabolous]
All I got is hard dick and bubble gum
And guess what, I'm fresh out of bubble gum
But I happen to have a whole lotta dick and a whole lotta chicks
Who wanna get sum
Hurry up if you wanna get some
Hurry up girl if you wanna get some
Hurry up girl if you wanna get some
Hurry up girl if you wanna get some

[Verse Two: Fabolous]
Now a chick who gold dig, look for a nigga who roll big
Rather than a nigga who hold gigs
Unless you bring her what you bringin home
Keep her finger with the bling and chrome
She try ta cling on everything you own
Even singin on them ringin tones
I rather be single and swing alone
+before you do me like ginger did sam+
+they catch you if they can like the ginger bread man+
But I know it's all about the benjamins mam
And maybe another man responds to you
At the most I could get you in the ???
Cause I'm not interested in buyin a chick
But you can call me about tryin ta dick
1-800-GIT-SUM....
.......

[Chorus: Fabolous]
All I got is hard dick and bubble gum
And guess what, I'm fresh out of bubble gum
But I happen to have a whole lotta dick and a whole lotta chicks
Who wanna get sum
Hurry up if you wanna get some
Hurry up girl if you wanna get some
Hurry up girl if you wanna get some
Hurry up girl if you wanna get some

You're the kinda girl that has a little bit more fun

Cause' I never seen a ass so big with a waist as little as yours hun
And by the expressions on them hotties grills
I know they want to holla at somebody real
And I'm usually lookin' for somebody skilled
Enough to make a nigga say aye aye aye yo niggas get mad 'cause I may slay they hoe
But I don't want to let the a.k. spray so
Stop face fightin' me, like ya face frighten' me
I do this every year so I ain't never scared
I do this everywhere and you ain't never there
They sayin' this everywhere, how could you never hear

[Chorus: Sean Paul]
If you want to roll with the thugs tonight
Lights, camera, action can you feel the hype
Hit cruise control blazed Kryptonite
Well its alright, baby its alright
If you want to live up and free your life
Come through let we kick it 'til a morning light
If you want to roll with tha thugs tonight
Well its alright, baby its alright

So get with it, we want (to) hit it, we nah quit it

I want you give me some of it because minute by minute
Temperature it all a rise because you thighs and all you hips, style
You shockin' it, you a rock it, you a kill it
And a one thing the Dutty Paul want to predict
Say by tha end of tha night you will be chillen' with tha click
Flossin' it, money we tossin' it

Over here the liquor is light blue, the chronic is light green
They wearin' the right shoe, they put on the tight jeans
They bringin' me right through', I walk with a slight lean
My style excites you, I know what that might mean
Aye, I'ma freaky scorpio
Yo, tryna' leave with your skio

You'd rather swim in a pool of pee
Then see the one you love in the vehicle with me

can't even go love another man,

Can't even maintain your thangs,
And its insane the way, that she gave me brain

Shorty don't try to fake it,
Just up and face it,
Your time is being wasted, your mans a basic

See it all in his face, that he's cheap and tasteless,
But life is what you make it, just watch the bracelet

I bet your man can't do it like me,
His veins don't pump pimp fluid like me,
He's nowhere near or like me,
And he probably think keeping you in check,

Is buying you a pair of Nike's 
Why wouldn't I.. get dough from her,
When the digits on my checks, look like phone numbers
Fuck It,

You might as well tell that buster skid addle,
Not even Catherine can help him in his custody battle
Yeah.

[Mike Shorey]
You can catch me in the club, with a case of bub
And a thick chick to rub, niggas hate because
When they sit in the truck, they be quick to fuck
When I'm getting a nut, they just lick it up

I'm in favor if, bust a flow is dangerous,
I don't aim to give shortys our relationships,

And sometimes I know you get impatient
But you don't put to on a show to get patience
Take it to court and go through litigations
And I respect ya gangsta
Treat you like a princess
And put something on your neck to thank ya
She's my pinch hitter
When the starting lineup ain't playing right
I come off the bench wit her
It might sound like I'm gassing ya
But it took time to get from the back seat to the passenger
We been creeping and sneaking
Just to keep it from leaking
We so deep in our freaking
That we don't sleep on the weekend

A little bit uptight
Wondering why he coming home in the middle of the night
It'll be alright if y'all bump heads it'll be a fight
But I said it'll be alright

But I gotta be real with you (real with you)
I can't leave you alone (lone)

Can't leave you alone (lone)
And I know I'm living wrong
But I can't let ya go

You ain't ever step out of line
Or get out a pocket
So I made sure canary sent out your locket
To protect you, I'll get out and cock it
And you know the barrel of my gun is big enough to spit out a rocket
Oh, you gonna play dumb if cops do come through
I gotta keep the top up if my drop do come through
But I know the boutiques and the shops you run through
So I cop her one, and cop you one too
You always get a daily page, weekly ring
Plus you ain't too shy to do them freaky things
I ain't gotta put a band on your finger
I worry about you telling the whole world I'm your new Allen Springer
At first you were something I denied
Something I would slide
Just do something in the ride
But shorty
There's something that you provide
Cause the entree ain't as good without something on the side

But I gotta be real with you (real with you)

And I know I'm living wrong
But I can't let ya go

Uh oh, I might be leaving the earth soon
My girl gonna kill me if she smells the scent of your perfume
Its gonna be a clip towards if I go back
With stains of your lip gloss on my throwback
She won't care if I'm a platinum rapper
If she catch me with an empty magnum wrapper
So keep it on the down low call the carsely
You seen what happened with Mr. Big and R. Kelly

You know I get from you
Anytime this chick is there for you
Feelings I'm'ma share wit you
Which makes it a Lil Mo clear for you

Fab... [5X]
Can you be my be	-A-be	-why?

[M.S.:] I'll never call another lover mine
[Verse 1: Fabolous]
And why would I, and why should I
When I seen a lady tonight, with my good eye that I would try and make
My..(baby..baby)
I was up in the club putting my hood high
When I saw you, and I stood by
Just lookin at your onion girl I could cry, and I could lie
I mean I could try and say you ain't sweep me off my feet
But only one thing could keep me off the street
And that's if you be my, be	-A-be	-why
I can be why you always be fly
And I'm from be	-Stuy, just like B.I...G. was, that's how F-A-be	 does
We can sip something 'til we both be buzzed
In a V-dub and that's only be-cause

[Chorus: Mike Shorey]
Need someone to be my (baby)
Kind of girl you find in the club rockin those (baby) Phat jeans
Gonna find someone to be my (baby)
..I see some ladies tonight that should be having my (baby, baby)

[Verse 2: Fab]
After the baby talk, the goo goo ga ga
You like this, that, you do bla bla
Couple good jokes, a few brouhaha's, it's time to do you mama
First I'ma put you on your back
And make you scream out (baby)..just like I put you on the track

Then I'ma lay you on your side
And slowly stroke you while you telling me the way you feel inside
But my sex drive won't make me play you on the side
You know you get the keys any day you want to ride
And my baby know how to start me up
You got the kind of kiss that'll speed a heartbeat up
And you got the kind of touch that'll gimme the chills
I ask you 'cause I know you gonna gimme it real
It won't be fake, and don't we make a good couple
And won't we make a good...(baby)?

[Bridge: Mike Shorey]
Ooh, if I seem just a bit taken, pardon me
But you're so amazing
I just want us to do this exclusively
Say you'll be my baby

[Verse 3: Fab]
My baby's the only one I bring to the villa
That can get the bling and the scrilla
Girl, I know you smooth enough to spring a chinchilla
And still take a sting of Tequila, the way you swing is a thriller
I'm watchin that like the boxing match in the ring of Manila
I want to keep it comin like the singles of ""Thriller""
I mean if you still uh..my be	-A-be	-why

Clean button up wit the rich young pairs

So you know I came with the heat y'all!
You know I got a little money, got a little fame
But you know I came from the streets y'all

But pimp enough to not give a fuck
They say I'm old enough to know better
But young enough to not give a fuck
Tell Stella to move back, if she want Her Groove Back
I get my young man on, then the young man gone
Let's get money again, and even if you ain't
I'll make you feel twenty again, so!

And you can tell I'm too blessed to be stressed

So I ain't a player that need assistance to score

In them little cars with those big wheels
With a little box full of those big steels
Pretty little chicks in those big heels

Whether they stayin' or goin'
They stare at the Airs and be sayin' it glowin'
And they like my style and the way I be flowin'
But that's when I bud in and say that I'm blowin'
Now you could make the choice if you stayin' or goin'

We could go any place in the world
And the jet hold twelve so theres space for ya girls

Keep frontin' like you spend
While ya pockets get lighter and lighter like Michael's skin
On the other hand
I'm the kind of brother man
With fifty thou of ice just up on the hand
Bentley bright and rocky covered band
And a zone that'll tell the time in another land
Girls spread they legs same day I bagged 'em
Its the Mustard Gut, Mayo Magnum
In the twenty twos with the butter knife shine
That's why every body and they mother like mine

Make a joke, keep it light 
Used to do without it 
Let it go without a fight 
Used to cry about it 
Wonder when, wonder how 
Pray somehow, pray somehow 

Well it's easier now 
I took some time to find out 
And it's really a matter of 
The benefit of the doubt 
When all you love is what you do 
You're doing what will get you through 
Just make this vow 
And it's easier now 

Used to hold a candle 
In the wind, in the rain

For a light along the way 
Far down another road 
See a sign, see the end 
See a true friend, see a true friend 

Well it's easier now 
I took some time to find out 
And it's really gone beyond 
A shadow of a doubt 
When all you need is what you love 
You'll always be reminded of 
The eleventh hour 
It makes it easier now 

Easy, easier now 
So easy, it's easier now 

Used to lose the battle 
Run away from the fight 
Used to face the struggle 
Didn't know the wrong from right 
Used to be afraid of 
What I thought, what I knew 
Was the truth, was the truth 

Well it's easier now 
I took some time to find out 
And it's really a question of 
What you can do without

The thing that sets your whole world free 
Just listen to the sound 
And it's easier now",Easier Now,1997

Thought you couldn't lose when you played this game 
Then everything changed 
And you could go on 
But your world's all wrong 

So you count to ten, then open your eyes 
What you really want is to be surprised 
But they're telling you lies 
And you could go on 
But your world's all wrong, your world's all wrong 

And this house of cards you're living in 
Is falling down on you 
It's a one way street you're driving on 
The signs are all around you 
And this shooting star you're hanging on 
Won't make your dreams come true 

Now it feels like it's already done 
Now you realize that you weren't the one 
You're losing the sun 
It doesn't seem real 
It's not what you feel 

So you live alone like you are possessed 
Look at your life like it's some kind of test 
Go on give it your best 
Try and move on 
But your world's all wrong, your dreams are gone

Mike Shupp,"In a letter to Annette 
I wrote down all the things 
We haven't done yet 
In case we forget 

It was a glorious affair 
Ten minutes long and destined 
For nowhere 
But I do care 

And now you're halfway across the country 
And I am walking on streets you know 
And you would think it was raining money 
On this place we want to go 

So I put away my pen 
Put on a stamp and sent 
You a picture 
Of the future 

And have I found you well 
Have you anything to tell 
Of your new life 
Of the good life 

Annette, Annette 
Are you fine, are you strong 
Well you guessed wrong 
I did not forget, I did not forget",Letter to Annette,1997
Mike Shupp,"I paint a picture of myself 
Until I look like someone else 
Now don't try to find me 
Don't try and remind me 
Of some way I ought to be 
Of things that I should have 
Should have seen comin' 

I paint a picture of myself 
Flattering portrait on your shelf 
Don't want you to worry 
Won't ever be sorry 
Make things nice as can be 
Live life so easily 

In love 
In love

I paint this picture by myself 
Never thought to ask for any help 
I suppose you will blame me 
But who would not do the same things 
Life comes down hard and brings 
Rain clouds over everything 
Life comes down hard and brings 
Rain clouds over everything 
Over everything, over everything

Mike Shupp,"I wake up to a brand new day 
And the world waits just to turn my way 
I see all that can be 
And you find something wrong with me 

I once slipped into your world 
And watched as your design unfurled 
Can't say that I knew you well 
Been a long time comin' out of that hell 

Well I'm out of the dark and lonely place I've been 
Into the wide open arms of a friend 
Like a broken record I'm so sick of that song 
Why do you always have to prove me wrong 

I walk through a December night 
And the weight of the world feels right 
Desperate feelings in my soul 
Gonna take every last ounce of control 

Well I'm out of the dark and lonely place I've been 
Into the bright and shining light again 
Take a number if you can wait that long 
Are you still gonna try to prove me wrong again 

Wrong, prove me wrong 
Prove me wrong again 
Wrong, prove me wrong

Mike Shupp,"You walk through the door 
I'm not listening anymore 
And the only sound is the wind 
You twist my words around 
Or am I just feeling down 
Can't explain this state I'm in 

What's right for you is not right for me 
Now I see what you want me to be 

Are our wires just crossed 
Or am I really lost 
I sit and stare through the glass 
Looks like rain's on the way 
Looks like whatever you say 
Yes I'm afraid to ask 

What's right for you is not right for me 
Now I see what you want me to be 
Sunrise in the wrong constellation 
Star sign pointing to my destination 
Take my place in a long line of confusion 
Just a taste of my own brand of illusion 
Brand of illusion 

Like battle lines are drawn 
Everything I say is wrong 
And the silence cries out to us 
Should we leave well enough alone 
Or take what we call our own 
Is it love we do not trust 

What's right for you is not right for me 
Now I see what you want me to be 
What's right for you",Right for You,1997
Mike Shupp,"Like a river to the sea 
You will come back to me 
Into the waiting night 
You will be the light 

Like the rain that fills the ground 
You are falling down 
And to this empty earth 
You will be returned 

Like a ship that sails alone 
You are far from home 
And through a raging storm 
You will be reborn 

Until your journey's through 
I will wait for you 
And when this circle ends 
I will have you again

You will come back to me 
You will come back to me",River to the Sea,1997

It's up to me 
I can see it in your eyes again 
Up to me 
I can hear it, hear it in your lies my friend 
You let me down again 

Straight from the heart you say it comes 
I want to believe but you leave me numb 
""Leave it up to me"" are you still reassuring me 

Took a long time to see the game

I'm gonna break this into 
A million pieces

Relatively unscathed

For so many months 
No time to scheme and plan 
Hit the ground start running as fast as I can 

Got my head on straight tonight 
Gonna find out what went wrong 
And make it all right 
Sometimes I feel this way 
Can't seem to make this feeling stay 
Make it stay, make it stay

It's all you can do 
Find your way through the pain 
That's inside of you 

Purge the poison from your veins 
More than you knew 
Turn your face up to the rains 
They'll wash over you 

When love comes down from so far away 
And leads you out of your darkest day 
There's no more obstacles in your way 
Don't fight it 
You never will deny it 
Don't let it go 

Open your heart and let it in 
And love will take hold 
Give in to your only sin 
Your chances are sold

If I missed your smile 
My life is still the same

Of wanting you 

Could it be any sadder 
When you hide your tears 
Has nothing really changed 
After all these years 
Ordinary days, ordinary ways 
Of wanting you 

And you never had a clue 
Or gave a second thought 
Love can't find you where you are 
That's not what you were taught 
But you never take the chance 
Always too much to lose 
It's easier to make amends 
And never have to choose 

But I won't wait any longer 
Just to feel your touch

Überall Blitzlicht doch heute blendet's mich
Weil jeder Augenblick ohne dich verschwendet ist

Hey girl, just imagine me and you, along the road
Switchin from silent gear to a moany mode
All you gonna hear is that's the motor, of course
(But don't let it get hot, or you'll feel the force 
Hello, my name is Kangol Kid (You can call him Kangol, if you choose)
I'm Dr. Ice (How can you tell?) You can tell by the mous'

And Mixmaster) woo-hah (The four is back)

Mine can do tricks (What can yours do?)
Mine won't disagree with me, it's never frontin'

After those command my ride will stand
Taller and prouder than any man
Crashin' through vicious, on wet roads even
In other words, it's (Skeezin season!)
And brakes of course for my protection
So I don't waste my fuel injection
I'm makin' it clear, the way I steer
I'll reach my destination (Ah, I'm here)

I got a ride 
I got a ride, and you can look inside
And if I ever die, I want to die with my ride
I love the way it hugs, the way like it does
You want to know why? Well, because

It only takes one passenger when it's hot
Unless I want to share it, okay, why not?
Just imagine a volcano when it's bound to erupt
(You want to ride?) Come on girl, hurry up
Tell your mother where you're goin', and don't forget
If your mother want to come, tell your pops: ""Don't fret""
If he wants you home soon, tell him that's insane

And if I catch a flat, girl, give me a blow
'Cause I don't carry spares, cause spares, they cost
And plus my nuts are too hard to come off

You see, my ride is not a stretch-limo Cadillac
To tell the truth, I think my ride is much longer than that
So if you ever see my ride, girl, face to face
I doubt that it'll fit in your parking space
But I'll (push) if you want to (push) if I gotta
And we can even (push) for the hell, why nada?
It's lovable and huggable and bendable
I won't sell it to ya, baby, but it's rentable

A lotta fuel you give it, premium or regular
Any kind of fluid from a female etcetera
Four-wheel drive, so I can get there in a giffy
And turbo-jogs in case I'm lookin' for a quickie
But the tighter the roads, the harder I'll pursue
And my goal in my life with my ride is to shoot
For the finish line, so I can get there quick
Ask Bobby, Jimmy, Jack, or you can even ask (Dick)
You can even ask my mechanic
When she saw my ride, she didn't panic
You see, I got garages all over these parts
So I can park the ride whenever it gets dark
I got a sunroof, so wide, you can't miss it
Before I stick my head out, I gotta unzip it
Hey yo, I never got a ticket, if I do one day
They'll have a hard time towin' this baby away

And if I catch a flat, girl, give me a blow
'Cause I don't carry spares, cause spares, they cost
And plus my nuts are too hard to come off
(You dig it?)
You see, my ride is not a stretch-limo Cadillac
To tell the truth, I think my ride is much longer than that
So if you ever see my ride, girl, face to face
I doubt that it'll fit in your parking space
But I'll (push) if you want to (push) if I gotta
And we can even (push) for the hell, why nada?
It's lovable and huggable and bendable
I won't sell it to ya, baby, but it's rentable
And if you're wonderin' why, I'll tell you what for
(They don't make rides like this no more)

I got a ride
I got a ride, and you can look inside
And if I ever die, I want to die with my ride
I love the way it hugs, the way like it does
You want to know why? Well, because

You see my ride 
A lotta fuel you give it, premium or regular
Any kind of fluid from a female etcetera
Four-wheel drive, so I can get there in a giffy
And turbo-jogs in case I'm lookin' for a quickie
But the tighter the roads, the harder I'll pursue
And my goal in my life with my ride is to shoot
For the finish line, so I can get there quick
Ask Bobby, Jimmy, Jack, or you can even ask (Dick)
You can even ask my mechanic
When she saw my ride, she didn't panic
You see, I got garages all over these parts
So I can park the ride whenever it gets dark
I got a sunroof, so wide, you can't miss it
Before I stick my head out, I gotta unzip it
Hey yo, I never got a ticket, if I do one day
They'll have a hard time towin' this baby away

I got a ride",The Ride,1996
Mike Slap,"Last night the sky's turned purple and
Past lives in light tunnels
Light tunnels

In the back of a town car, staring at myself in a tux
Maneuvering through the people out front
Police barricade, orange cones and we're stuck
Twenty minutes late and my manager blowing me up
Security guard in the garage at the entrance
Rolled down the window and showed him our credentials
[?] flash the pass and he let's us continue
Metal detectors, phone booths and reception
I should be grateful this my nine to five
I walk into the green room, alright, alright
I get on Youtube tryna learn how to tie on my tie
Fuck it, I'll wear the bolo tonight, night, night
I probably shouldn't have done the drugs I've done
A couple of days ago, detox son
I forgot my belt at the hotel
Fuck, now my team all scared my [?] sucks
I need something to cope, ain't nothing to cope
I eat a banana and I drink a cup of throat coat
I wish I had the homies with me here but nope
Most of the artists that I know don't get invited to this show
Because success to them determines our value
The make-up, the power, the hairspray, perfume, make-up and powder
The ratings come down to who's popular now in the song in the hour
Knock at the door, I let them in, hair and make up now, red carpet in ten
She covers up my freckles, concealer on my chin
I look orange but she swears it looks natural with my skin
The show is starting, they take me to my seat
Walk in the arena building, ego of elites
Like the whole industry is staring at me
A row away from Taylor, two away from Jay and B

Last night the sky's turned purple and
Past lives in light tunnels
Light tunnels
So that's who we are
Just like the stars
Shine your light on
Shine your light on

Curtain opens up, host walks out
We stand in unison and applaud real loud
I watch the other people that have been around for a while
Just excited I got invited, feeling cool in the crowd
Thinking such and such is bold, look at such and such's gold
Damn, such and such in real life, looks really fuckin' old
Such and such is fine, she's with such and such, oh
I'm here but I'm barely even watching the show
Cause tonight we toast to our accomplishments
Insecurity dressed up as confidence
I said tonight we toast to our accomplishments
Insecurity dressed up as confidence
An award is given out, commercial, re-set the scene
They keep saying ""coming soon is the Biebs""
Watch celebrities take selfies with celebrities
It feels so make believe
They want the gossip, they want the drama
They want Britney Spears to make out with Madonna
They want Kanye to rant and to go on longer, cause that equates to more dollars
They want talking topics, they want trending topics
They want outfits to be outlandish, they want sideways glances
Beef and problems, they want nipple slips
Cause they live for clips, this is economics
So we Botox our skin and we smile for the camera
Might as well get a new nose while we're at it
This is America and insecurity's our fabric
And we wear it and we renamed it fashion
I look to my right, there's a cameraman snapping
Picture after picture after sister after sister
Of the line of Kardashians, mind so distracted
Realized there's an ovation and everyone's clapping

Last night the sky's turned purple and
Past lives in light tunnels
Light tunnels
So that's who we are
Just like the stars
Shine your light on
Shine your light on

It's just weird when the camera's on you
Gotta remember to still clap if I lose
I see myself on the screen
Split into five different artists on TV
And just look normal, don't get turned into a meme
Relax, breathe
Me
There's a stranger holding my award
I give her an awkward hug she says ""It's yours""
Think I'm supposed to kiss her on the cheek
Man, I should have prepared an acceptance speech
Do I talk first? Is it Ryan? Is it me?
Fuck it, I'll take the lead, grab the mic, say my piece
Do I look at camera one? Do I look at camera three?
I promise, I'm honored, I'd like to thank God, my momma and father
I'd like to thank Trisha, the mother of my daughter
I couldn't have done it without you all in my corner
Especially the fans, been here since the beginning
Supported the music, allowed us to be independent
And I know, I shouldn't be long winded
Wait hold up, don't play the music let me finish
This feels so narcissistic
Dressed as a celebration to conceal it's a business
Me, me, me, my my image
My, my songs, my self interest
One big reality show that is scripted
And I could keep trying or get out the competition
I rather run out of my fifteen minutes than have life
Pass me by and I forget to live it
But, that doesn't mean retirement
But I don't like who I am in this environment
I forgot what this art is for
I didn't get through freshman year to get out as a sophomore
Here I am in this arena, yeah I'm scared
I got the people's attention don't want to lose it here
Thinking about my career, miserable here
But wanna make sure I'm invited next year
To the same damn party, celebrities on isle
Same blank stares, same fake smiles
Same big budget production
I know now who I am when the lights go out and it falls down
And the curtain closes, nobody notices
Wanted to throw up the Roc, wanted to be Hova
Wanted to be Wayne with the accent from the NOLA
Thought I'd feel better when the award show was over
But I guess I showed up late
Almost got cut off when they closed the gate
Just in time, what will I say?
Time to explain this unruly mess I've made

A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear

Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me

Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak

I would be, caught in the undertow

With the time red six hundred call it a sled
Little yak little greenery to clear my head

The landlord callin' the baby sitter is flippin'
You ready to drop everythin' you think about skippin'
But you strong and you gon' make it all good
Back to the wall and you gon' keep it all hood

The clubs packed everybody is fresh to def

Circle round the room still
Breaking my will

Know I can't have you here

And you made it start, can you make it stop?

Following the power lines

And your skin is so white
Underneath the black night
And your voice calls out for the Coup de grace
When the lights go out will there be a trace?
I don't know Silvia
That I loved, Silvia
That I loved, Silvia",Silvia,2009
Mike Snow,"I met you on the palisades
The sun was spilling kerosene
And I was feeling wide awake
Girl, you can be so obscene
And when you sang a lullaby
A missionary called your name
You disappeared and hopped a flight
For the Serengeti plain

Tell everyone you know
Open up the door
Tell everyone you know
Open up the door

When your love has gone
You carry on
This is her song
This is a song for no one
This is a song for no one

I think I own a photograph
That shows her in the freezing rain
With the Italians on the bank
They know how to entertain
A string of pearls behind your hair
A music box to catch your tears
Now call your mother in L.A.
She hasn't heard your voice in years

Tell everyone you know
Open up the door
Tell everyone you know
Open up the door

When your love has gone
You carry on
This is her song
This a song for no one (x3)

When your love has gone
You carry on
This is her song
This a song for no one

You can jump a ride
But don't ask why
And don't close your eyes

This a song for no one (x3)",Song For No One,2009
Mike Snow,"Early in the morning, up and fly away
You know why you don't walk here round the sun, no, my face
Couldn't get back to celebrate
And I know you're backing off, you want it both ways

At night, I'm trading, gold diamonds for stars
Blinded by fire, showing me who you are
Fuck it, fade away, child 'til another day, child
Gotta keep my state of mind

Maybe I have to wait a while
Maybe I have to wait a while
Maybe I could change your mind
Maybe I could change your mind, woah, oh

Step into the backroom, take your breath away
Even though it's been some time, you still love my taste
Trying to meet your eyes, I keep my sanity
Though I know you're backing off, you want it both ways

At night, I'm trading, gold diamonds for stars
Blinded by fire, showing me who you are
Fuck it, fade away, child 'til another day, child

Maybe I have to wait a while
Maybe I could change your mind
Maybe I could change your mind, woah, oh

I could feel the waves from you and I
Slamming on shore on the other side
But I have to wait 'til it's time
Fly away, fly away
I could feel the waves from you and I
Slamming on shore on the other side
But I have to wait 'til it's time

Mike Sponza,"Somewhere in this big city a fine young lady's getting dressed
She's going down to the blues club to hear the sounds that she loves best
Modern music just don't move her
Rap and country 'n' all the rest

She's going out all alone to check out a new blues band
Her girlfriends won't go with her, no they just don't understand
That's too bad, but she don't need them
And she ain't lookin' for a man

To her nothing sounds so good as a ringing slide guitar
She loves it slow and deep, and she feels it in her heart
She says ""hush, I'm trying to listen""
When men hit on her at the bar

A lady so fine and soulful can still be blue that's for sure
She might make lots of money, but a troubled heart can make her poor
And if blues is her sadness
Then blues music is her cure",Blues Lover,2012

De nuevo la vi, por cómo está mirando 
Casi puedo jurar, la estaba conquistando 

Se la pasa con su amiga vacilando

Yo quiero ser el hombre que te lo da todo 
En mí ahora todo cambio 
Me convertí en esclavo cuando vi sus ojos

Since I became the undead
Spreading my stain on the world
From all the slaves I've bled

Dance around a fire wearing goat skin legs
The cult of personality none shall resist
I'm bigger than then the devil combined with schindler's list

You won't pay for your sins
I'll absolute every one of them
So offer your soul for Sgt. D. to claim you
Cloven hoof is with your tail between your legs
Beelzebub you're through

Carve a swastika into your head
Dance around a fire wearing goat skin legs
The cult of personality none shall resist
I'm bigger than then the devil combined with schindler's list

Yes I'm bigger than Christ and his cross
Yes I'm bigger than Buddha he's lost
Yes I'm bigger than Allah and his lot
Yes I'm bigger than the devil, his disciples and flock

Where there's no redemption

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

Mike Strickland,"I once had a girl 
Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath 

And when I awoke I was alone 
This bird had flown 
So I lit a fire

Mike Strickland,"Back down memory lane, I began as my mother's bright idea
A short time later they all watched in awe and all of a sudden I'm here
She was also my father so I hardly got to see her
I was afraid of the dark, but it was only 'cause I was a believer

I was told when I was two years old
She swore that I would be special

So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Down, down came the sun
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part

opening doors,
finally knowing 
the one that I wanted was yours,
Making my entrance again,

Sure of my lines,
no one is there.

I thought that you'd want what I want

I'm starting to make ends, I ain't worried about fake friends
Cause I'm chillin' with the same ones
We just havin' fun, and they just talk about a bunch of shit they haven't done
And I come from a small town with city dreams
Like girls in chuck tays and skinny jeans

Livin' fast, ricky bobby, and got my homies beside me
And I put one in the air like
Don't care if it's wrong if it feels right
And i'm, I'm flyin' by the seat of my pants
Rather do what I want instead of meetin' demands
Do you believe in what they say?
Success is a journey but we treat it like a place
And it doesn't make sense if you don't enjoy the ride
Livin' young, wild, and free 'till the day that I die
Ridin' with my friends everywhere I go

Like we ain't got no other options
Tee it up every night, call that Bubba Watson
Cause I ain't tryin' to look back at what we shoulda had
Cause age is just a number and I was never good at math

Were asking how you did it

She was daddy's little girl, came from a small town
The type of chick that everybody would talk about
Only nineteen, but her body was mean, she was a beauty queen
So she moved to Hollywood to pursue a dream
And just like she thought she would, she hit it big
Signed a deal, and every day she had a gig
It was crazy all the sudden, she had all the success now
But the pressure had her stressed out
And she was always getting drunk now, always in the club now
With all the cool new friends, who had the drugs round
So they would skip the lines, then they'd sniff the lines
And pretty soon, she was doing this shit all the time
And it was cool; at least she thought it was
Till she couldn't smile without all the drugs
She was a beautiful girl, but inside she was hurting
That's why she's hiding cuts all under her David Yurmans

Was the kind of kid who never put his football down
See, his mama was a teacher and his pops used to play
Back in the day, he was top quarterback in the state
But hey, nowadays his son's wearing that letterman
Pops been drilling him his whole life to play like a veteran
Damn, all of these touchdowns have always been part of the plan
But that plan wasn't his
Life feeling like a lie, he was scared he couldn't live any longer
That's why them pain meds getting stronger
The same ones that he said for his shoulder
Thoughts in his head getting colder
'Cause his reality was too embarrassing to let his parents in
And anybody at all, he had nobody to call
They wouldn't get it or accept it
So he filled his mouth up with pills so they'd never know

Running in circles and I'm searching to know where it ends
Or where it begins, over and over and over again

Drowning in your lies and I can't breathe a word of truth

You're ruining my life, but I forgot if I should care
'Cause even though you're wrong for me, I love that you belong to me
And honestly when you're gone, where you are is where I wanna be
And I should know better, enough is enough
Killing those who love me for the one that I love

Had I not restrained my love for you
Would I still be lying next to you
Had I not restrained

[Chorus]
And I don't know why
I do the things I do
Yeah I don't know why
I never seem to make it through
Had I not complained to you
Had I not restrained from you
If I never had lied to you
Where would I be now
Should have shown respect for you
Should have never neglected you
Had I not complained to you
Where would I be now

Had I not complained could I still be here
And my finest hour growing near
Had I not complained
Had I turned my back on bad advice
Could I still be here for the big surprise
Had I turned away

[Chorus] 

Where would I be
If I had just
Followed you everywhere
Where would I be
Had I not complained",Had I Not Complained,1998
Mike Tramp,"Have you ever told your mother
That she was more than God
And for all the life she gave you
You would give her twice as much
Have you ever told your father
You were angry that he left
And when both of you got older
Did you tell him you'd forgive
Yes I have

Have you ever loved your woman
With everything you got
Have you told her that without her
Life is really not a lot
Have you ever held your new born
And looked into his eyes
When you saw your own reflection
Were you man enough to cry
Yes I was

Should have done it long ago
Now I know
What I didn't long ago
And I know that life gets shorter
Every day we lose a day
So I want you all to know
That I love you

What do we wait for
When we keep our feelings
Locked up and to ourselves
We hesitate but soon we all regret
When we find the door has closed
And we're too late

Have you ever held a loaded gun
And pressed it to your head
Did you think of all the ones you loved
And the life that you have left
Have you ever told your friends
That they mean everything to you
Did you tell then that you'd be there
And help their dreams come true
Yes I have",Have You Ever,1998

From her eyes there shines a light
She can calm the wind
And heal a wounded soul
She has fire in her heart
One that warms you from the start

And when she cries
All rivers flow
On wings she flies
Where no one knows
She goes where no one knows

Maybe I won't make it through
But if I live tomorrow
I won't beg and borrow

No loving woman is enough
Cause the road I travel's
Got a hold on me
I ain't got no home address
Never striving for success
I just live from day to day
I lay my body down
On the barren ground
Camp fire light will keep me
Warm and safe from harm

From what she thought was just a dream
Looked around and saw it all was real
Packed her bags and ran away
Nothing here to make her stay
Free again she set out on her own

She never knew her life could be
All the things she dreamed of
If only she had realized
That there were so much more than

Living a lie, living a lie
Cause you're missing out
When you are living a lie

Flowers in the summer rain
How good it feels to smile again
Love is real when you are not afraid
Sally looked into his eyes
And saw a glimpse of paradise
Could it be what love is meant to be

She's not afraid not anymore
To seek what she desire
She dare to live the life she dreams
She wants to feel alive. not

Show with everything but Yul Brynner, you know 

Time flies, doesn't seem a minute

All change, don't you know that when you
Play at this level there's no ordinary venue

It's Iceland or the Philippines or Hastings or this place
One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but the pearls ain't free
You'll find a God in every golden cloister
And if you're lucky then the God's a she
I can feel an angel sliding up to me

One town's very like another
When your head's down over your pieces, brother
It's a drag, it's a bore, it's really such a pity
To be looking at the board, not looking at the city
What do you mean, ya seen one crowded, polluted, stinking town

Some are set up in the Somerset Mount suite
Get Thai'd, you're talking to a tourist
Whose every move's among the purest

To the ultimate test of cerebral fitness

Controlling it

The kind of mate I'm contemplating
I'll let you watch, I would invite you
But the kind of queens, they just won't excite you
So you better go back to your bars, your temples
Your massage parlors 'cause we're not having it

Glad to chow on some squid
What the germs did at that gig
Made him do what he finally did
He fit the thunderbroom to the thundertune
Stuffed the thing in the hole

Drove up from Pedro, from Pedro he drove
Now he still live in Pedro

And for work he does gigs
But from time to time he seems to find
For inspiration he's got to dig

Mike Wheeler,"Soda pop-popping soldiers with their eyes
Everybody wakes up with their eyes

Men and their knuckles will win
Because men and their knuckles give in
To the pounding flesh in the rot masquerade
Like dinks that piss in a piss-piss parade

Souls that rots in soldiers with their eyes
Everybody gonna freeze up from their eyes

You and your ribs will win
And the constant right corporals will win
The peacocks gleam in the bush parade
And the burning glaze portraits are a flashing charade

I'll talk for the queen
At Poisoned Falls, the royal scene
I bet they'll hiss like fiends
Oh baby, wake up

Days die in the myriad possible
I think you're jealous

Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again
Seems like pretending it isn't the ending

Two friends, but one broken heart

Sweetheart, when you are not near
All that you claim must be true

I never mind the rain from the skies
If I can find the sun in your eyes
Sometimes I love you, sometimes I hate you
But when I hate you, it's 'cause I love you
That's how I am, so what can I do?

Mike Wofford,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

One place I may never go in my life again
Was I just off somewhere just too high

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, I love you,
And steal a kiss or two

So I does it but imagine if I wasn't, fascinated
Wit the sense of heat that stressin me, fled to frustrated
Ticked off, pissed off, tried to get my dick off

If there was no negativity to keep the balance?

What if eighty seven never happened?
No innovative hip-hop, no crack kingpin, no park hand-clappin

Or if world wars ain't take place and didn't interrupt our times?

The main suspect is society for committing this mistake
Categorizing everything, I sit back and dig up some more ""what if's""

Everything on my side is lookin' alright
It's high power original, b-boy traditional
Raw bass material, huh, when individual
True brand imperial you're hearin' on your stereo
Transcribe the live, the Mos, Def init-ial
Sit BACK, and listen, you ain't, in no position
To deal with my conditional mentally and physical
Strength is indivisible, crews be comin' pitiful
Speech be sound typical, downfall habitual
Ock, I'm not feelin' you; don't know what your label
Tellin' you or what magic beans they sellin' you
I can flow, you can't though, example
Of a cat who just a modern day Sambo (yeah)
Who be bitchi'n out to A&R demands so
You can collect your little petty cash advance HOE

Yo, yo, you on the injured, I'm hot to death
I'm foul, plus I'm winnin', you think I shot the ref?
Rock a vest if you out of turn speakin'
'Cause I'm right there like nightmares;
I catch MC's while they sleepin'
I'm back these rap cats is wildin'
Got 'em in the studio poppin' Valiums, remasterin' they album
I'm about to re-up and restructure the case
You stuck, you about to get rearranged and replaced
I got plans for this rap game (uh-huh)
Put your head in the toilet and look son,
If you think my shit done changed
My shit is, out of your range, rip you out of your frame
Cop your tape, and the next day, copped an exchange
If you ain't, rockin' raw, what you rockin' for??
Without heat, y'all MC's, ain't hot no more
So for you lame cats tryin' to put your hit out
Try rockin' back and forth
It might be easier to get your shit out!

I'm Jedi Master, Mase Windu, what you been through
Keep MC's heads wrapped like Erykah Ba-do
Hip-Hop's Cleon Jones, when Eon Jones
Wackest MC's, we pee on those
No need to impede The High and Mighty mystique
That shit would be as ignorant as Jimmy the Greek
Claimin' they Godzilla's when they really Godzooki
Got a mill' from Charlie Brown, when I kidnapped Snoopy
Eon, sale or performance, in any ordinance
Rhyme menace, that burst your verbal nuisance
In accordance, with all the laws from the cordless
Starbuck coming through, leavin any pimp whoreless
Stereo stompin' defeatin' me is like
Latrell chokin' up John Thompson, Charles Bronson

Mikel Erentxun,"Mi amor te di en un viejo hotel
Las flores de mi corazón

Fue tu silencio nuestro adiós
Y al caer el sol la piel se separó
Y al caer el sol

Los años pasan sigo aquí
Sentado junto al surtidor
¡Qué grande es el colchón sin ti!
Y al caer el sol pienso solo en ti
Y al caer el sol

Mi amor al viento le pedí
Te traiga pronto junto a mí
No pierdo fácil la ilusión
Y al caer el sol vuelvo a estar sin ti
Y al caer el sol

Golpe certero
Rendido a tus pies
Y en un instante caer

",Caer,1992
Mikel Erentxun,"Armas de mujer
En noches de champagne
Hoy te puedo ver en la oscuridad
En la oscuridad te puedo ver

Ya son las diez
Tú te has ido y no sé qué
Desayunar si tú no estás
Me conformo con café
O con algo más

No sé por qué
Si no como al despertar
Me siento mal ya sabes que
De mañana es especial sin prisa

No hay nada en la televisión
No queda pan
Quizás un poco de champagne
Me haga reaccionar
Me haga controlar la situación

Horas muertas que se van
Estando a solas tú y yo
Con un poco de champagne

No sé qué hacer
En Madrid o San Sebastián
Si no estás tú será el champagne
Me recuerda aquella vez
Contigo en KU

Burbujas frescas del calor
De un buen cristal
Son noches secas de sabor
Las que tú me das
Las que tú me das sabor de amor

Armas de mujer
En noches de champagne
Hoy me beberé lo que tú me des
Lo que tú me des sorpréndeme

Quiero inventar tu corazón

Reír llorar sin miedo
Color pintar un sueño
Los dos tumbados a ver quién pasa
Solo la luna se nos escapa

De tu armario una sonrisa en la mano
Descubre oculto el placer cotidiano
Entre semana yo te amo

Una nota en la pared

Fui el dueño de la llave maestra

Y aprendí a entenderte sin hablar
Pero los espejismos se desvanecen
Si sólo se tocan por curiosidad

Deja que te quiera sin reservas
Deja que te quiera otra vez
A pleno sol sin nada que temer

En la almohada del mundo descansaremos
Abrigados por la despreocupación
Inventando un nuevo abecedario
Que sólo forme palabras de amor

Quiero que me abraces por sorpresa
Y recuperar el tiempo que se fue
A pleno sol sin nadie alrededor

He vestido mis ojos de amianto
Porque los tuyos vigilan de cerca
Como un ave de mal agüero

Solo he muerto de amor una vez
Pero aun me queda otra muerte pagada

Ahondaste en el poniente

Con tu nombre a la deriva

Y ya me deja

Un recuerdo en torno de tu nombre
Tan distinto a mis oídos pero el ensalmo
Ha sido roto en mil olvidos

Dime a quién

Veo el tándem, veo el seto sin podar
Y los vendados ojos del sol

Que está firmado por el mismo autor
Por la misma pasión

Que estés sin mí
Sólo me sabe mal

De tanto recorrer tu alma
He acabado por sentir
Una nube en mi esperanza
Y una ampolla en mi corazón

De vivir un amor tan real

Igual que un tatuaje
Hecho de recuerdos

Aún te llevo a flor de piel

Sin remordimientos

Sabes que siempre hallarás
Un pasaje en mi corazón
Por si tú quieres volar conmigo
Por si decides volar

Para ti es fácil hacer
Leña del árbol caído
Y yo tenía las de perder
Vuelvo a nacer

De mis cenizas y lo cierto
Es que tal vez cometa
El mismo error

En las calles, quién, quién si no
Y rara vez se acallan los bosques

Rara vez me buscas en sueños
Rara vez te sirves de mí

Ni en qué calle ni en que portal

De infancia en mi pero siempre a sido así
Cuando menos lo merezca ámame
Porque será cuando más lo necesite

Hoy te escribo esta carta porque siempre te quejabas de que nunca te enviaba cartas de amor.
Decías que era frío, que era todo indiferente y buscaste un continente para entregar tu calor.
Tal vez tu ONG se pueda ocupar de resucitar a hombres que siguen vivos.

Las cartas que no envías sólo son cartas marcadas, te regalan una mano pero nunca un corazón.
Mi casa está pidiendo una mano de pintura y algún punto de sutura para hacer punto final.
Y si estás en un país del Africa Central busca pronto un hechicero que me enseñe a olvidar.

Cartas de amor cuando ya no hay amor.
Cartas de amor, pero sin dirección.

Mi hospital de campaña, mi amuleto de la suerte, una firme barricada... lo eras todo para mí,
Pero hay cosas en la vida que son mucho más reales que los ojos que las miran.
Dime que fuí para ti. Dime que fuí para ti. Dime si en algún momento me llegaste a querer.

He descubierto que eres
Solo una moneda de tres caras
Y que nunca ganare contigo
Por muchas trampas que haga

Me enseñaste laberintos
En las citas con tu piel
Y me perdí en ellos
Sin saber porque ni para que

Ahora tengo mucha prisa
En llegar a ninguna parte
En viajar por tierra
A una isla alejada del mar

En alquilar un piso viejo
En un barrio que no exista
En doblar una esquina
Y que al doblarla no haya nada más

He dejado sólo una maleta
Medio llena en tu casa
Y el resto de mi vida
Sobre una cama sin hacer

He olvidado hace tiempo
La manera de olvidarte
He olvidado hace tiempo
La manera de volver

Eres sólo una
Moneda de tres caras
Eres sólo una
Moneda de tres caras

",Moneda de Tres Caras,2006
Mikel Erentxun,"Tú me enseñaste a ver
Roma en el espejo
Y a quererlo atravesar

Tú me ayudaste a ver
En mi oscuridad
Una noche de sol

Hay una fuente cerrada
Por todos los deseos
Que se negaba a conceder

Y hay otra fuente aquí
Donde te desee
Al empezar a anochecer

Pensaré que la ciudad eterna
Tiene los días contados
Que cualquier cosa es más pequeña
Que todo nuestro amor

No, no quiero promesas
Tu solo dame un día
Y yo pondré otro día más

Hoy, hoy quiero estar contigo
En búsqueda y captura
Y no tener que escapar

Pensaré que la ciudad eterna
Tiene los días contados
Que cualquier cosa es más pequeña
Que todo nuestro amor

Mikel Erentxun,"Di una vuelta al mundo
Y ninguna a tu corazón
Compre un billete que me traiciono

En mi viaje de ida
Tarde un minuto o dos
No sé cuanto empleare en volver

A tu lado, a tu lado

Sé que todo llega
Si quieres esperar
Todo sabe mejor
Si lo dejas enfriar

Hay cosas que no son
Lo que pueden parecer
El secreto está en saber mirar

El barro en los zapatos
Es otra cosa en realidad
Pequeños accidentes de andar sin mirar

Pero encontrarme contigo
Es el mejor final
Para un viaje que no debió empezar

Sé que todo llega
Cuando sabes esperar
Puedo viajar cien vidas
Sin llegarme a cansar

Descarrila mi tren
Cuando pase junto a ti
Asegúrate de que parara

Asegúrate
De que me quedare

",Todo Llega,2006
Mikel Erentxun,"Ellos se pasan por aquí
Al llegar su día
Nunca se olvidan de regresar
Son mis fantasmas visitantes

Ellos son parte de mí

Mis amigos se quedaron
Para siempre en un arcén
Discutiendo con la oscuridad
Sobre daltonismo y velocidad

¿De que intentaban escapar esa noche?
¿De quién querían escapar
Con la luna de detrás?

Ellos me suelen evitar
El resto de los días

A veces se presentan sin avisar
Y me sonríen desde los posos del te
No sé a qué abismo intentaban escapar
Con el mundo detrás

Mikel Erentxun,"Un adiós en la pared, dos palabras
Algún día volveré, rabia amarga 
No se es fiel con la razón si con el alma  
Una tarde tu y yo, cuerpo a cuerpo  
Abrazado pienso en ti es que tengo miedo  
Pierdo a pulso el corazón, no te miento 
He esperado en el andén de tus ojos 

Y mi voz se quiebra en dos, no hay retorno  
Llueve triste dentro de mi me llueve otoño 
Y él vuele al norte y busca su estrella 
Y él sueña que la alcanza y con ella muere

Me van contando mi soledad

Antes que me eches de menos
Dejaste vi­as muertas tendidas al pasar
Nunca te he esperado tanto

A un minuto de ti, voy detras de ti
A un minuto de ti, te seguire

El viento se ha calzado sus guantes de piel
Se entretiene con mi pelo
Bebo el agua que viene conmigo, estoy
Estancado en tu reflejo

Solamente de ti, gota a gota
Solamente de ti, veneno y sed
Llegare, solo hasta el umbral
Que puedo perder
Me atrevere, cuento un paso mas
No soy como tu

A un minuto de ti, voy detras de ti
A un minuto de ti, te seguire

Voy a arder, braceo en espiral
Me vuelvo a repetir
Saltare, planeo en derredor
No soy como tu

Evertime I see you slippin'
I go and reach for my mac 10
Victims of my devils playground

(Koopsta Knicca)
Damn I'm about to bust a cap up in these tricks
Chris
I'm thinkin' deadly and I'm scopin' with that infarred
Kickin' it with the hardest click
Leavin' bodies rottin' up in them ditches
Man what's done if my tongue hits like a ton of brizicks
Koops not concerned
I let you burn and burn and burn
Everything in the prophecy has been demonically read
So I learned
Deep in the morgue
Lie corps in the quateras
They want to face in a line of order
Can you place this shit
When you crawled up on the red man
You bounce set up in this bitch
Sittin' man and thinkin'
Though my dreams I hear little kids screamin
Poor preachers I waited for hangin'
Which got me like bored in the psycho ward like daily
The 6-6-6 mystery man
Is takin' me straight to insanity
Could it be a dimension of witches that bring out voices
That issue more tragedies
The seas of cries
Will soon be turning
Your fuckin' life over
Left the priest and island bleeding of four leaf clover
Then I crinkle enough of these slugs
?? I'd rather be mugged to drink up a pint of his blood

Mikey Dan,"Baby I'm going out of town to handle some business
For a few days
But don't you worry
'Cause I'll call you
Like it's not
Long distance
'Cause I hate being away
I hate being away from you 
I gotta go
Even though I don't want to
I'd rather stay 
Than to be away from you

Since absence
Has been known to 
Make the heart grow fonder 
Then you know 
That I miss you 
And this song 
Is just a reminder 
I hate being away 

[Chorus: ]
I hate being away from you
I've gotta go, even though I don't want to
I'd rather stay 
Than be away from you 
I can't wait to see your smiling face 
And cuddle up in front of the fireplace
I'd rather stay
Than be away from you 
 
Sometimes I find myself
Reaching for you
When talking on the phone
Is all we can do
But it won't be long, until I'm back to you
I'm counting the seconds
The minutes
The hours
The days 
Until we're face to face
'Cause I hate being away

Here we go again
My heart keeps giving in
To you and your crazy love
It's back to this again
My heart keeps giving in
To you and your crazy love

I hadn't heard from you in a while
Since I said it was over
So when you called me the other day
It was a total surprise

You said you still love
Miss me need to be with me
But the days are still passing by
In three months I'll be hearing that same ol' thing
That's how I know it's all lies

[Chorus]

You said you would call the next day
How I waited and prayed
That you would
Hell, it's been five days since that
I should have known it 
Even your bond on your word ain't no good
If you love me
You'd work a real job
You wouldn't need all them cars

You wouldn't need all that ice on your arm
Anything to be with me
You would do it
But instead your choose to put me through it, oh

I so want to believe in you
But you keep making it so hard to
How much more can my heart take
Is hanging on to us a big mistake

Mikey Dan,"Everybody needs a little sunshine in your life
Sometime to brighten up your day
Everybody needs a little sunshine in your life
Sometimes if it's only but a ray

There are days when we all feel like
We are lost in a maze, nothing's going our way
It's just one of those days
Can I get a witness, oh now

At some point we all need something
Or someone to come through with a kind word or two
Something so small can make all the difference
In the world, that's why

Everybody needs a little sunshine in your life
Sometime to brighten up your day
Everybody needs a little sunshine in your life
Sometimes if it's only but a ray

Have you ever just needed a hug
Or a pat on your back, feels so good to be loved
Something so small can make all the difference
In the world, ooh

Everybody needs a little sunshine in your life
Sometime to brighten up your day
Everybody needs a little sunshine in your life
Sometimes if it's only but a ray

Every now and then when the clouds move in
They're somewhat overbearing
But before you know, the sun is in control
And into your eyes it's staring

Everybody needs a little sunshine in your life
Sometime to brighten up your day
Everybody needs a little sunshine in your life
Sometimes if it's only but a ray

Everybody needs a little sunshine in your life
Sometime to brighten up your day
Everybody needs a little sunshine in your life
Sometimes if it's only but a ray

Everybody needs a little sunshine in your life
Sometime to brighten up your day

So why don't we stop all the talking girl
Why don't we stop wasting time?

You say once I'm with you, I'll never go back
You say there's a lesson that you want to teach
Well here I am baby, practice what you preach

Girl it's just you and me, so many things 
I could do to you and so many ways I can please

Why don't you start turning down the lights
And show me what you can do?

Mikey Spice,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

To kids from one to ninety-two

Before life removed all the innocence
My father would lift me high
And dance with my mother and me 
And then
Spin me around 'til I fell asleep
Then up the stairs he would carry me 
And I knew for sure 
I was loved

If I could get another chance
Another walk
Another dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
How I'd love love love 
To dance with my father again

When I and my mother 
Would disagree
To get my way I would run 
From her to him
He'd make me laugh just to comfort me
Yeah yeah
Then finally make me do 
Just what my mama said
Later that night when I was asleep
He left a dollar under my sheet
Never dreamed that he 
Would be gone from me

If I could steal one final glance
One final step 
One final dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
'Cause I'd love love love to 
Dance with my father again

Sometimes I'd listen outside her door
And I'd hear how mama would cry for him
I'd pray for her even more than me
I'd pray for her even more than me

I know I'm praying for much to much
But could you send her

He works hard to give her all he thinks she wants
But it tears her apart 'cause nothing's for her heart
He pulls in late to wake her up with a kiss goodnight
If he could only read her mind, she'd say

Buy me a rose
Call me from work
Open a door for me what would it hurt?
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things
I need the most in my life

Yeah

Now the days have grown
To years of feeling all alone
As she sits and wonders if all she's doin' wrong
'Cause lately she'd try anything just to turn his head
Ooh, would it make a difference if she'd say, if she'd say

Buy me a rose
Call me from work
Open the door for me what would it hurt?
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes

The less that he tries
To show her the love that he holds inside
And the more that she gives
The more that he sees
This is the story of you
And me

On the way home from work
To open the door to a heart that I hurt
And I hoped you noticed this look in my eyes

Down those city roads
When a man asked me
“May I please have some gold?”
So I reached within
I gave him all that I could loan
And he said ""in my return
I'll play you the last great song""

And so he reached for his guitar
He put the notes in proper tone
And before he began he said
""There’s something you should know
Now the words they aren't done
And I probably sing it wrong
But if you look beyond the flaws
You will hear the last great song""

And the man began to play
And the melody would grow
To the mountains high
From those valleys below
And as it came to an end
He held the last note long
And then he said ""My friend
You've just heard the last great song""

He said ""I'd love for you to stay
But I'm sure you've got to go
But whatever song you play
Make sure that all the people know
That the words they're never done
And you'll probably sing it wrong
But if they look beyond the flaws 
They will hear the last great song""

And his voice stayed in my head
And his melody would grow
To the mountains high
From those valleys below
And as it came to an end
He held the last note long
And then he said ""my friend
You've just heard the last great song""

And so I walked on my way
Walked about a block or two
When someone must have paid
Cause’ I swear I heard the tune
Of a sound so sweet
Of a sky so blue
And he played it complete 
‘Til everybody knew

And the man sang loud
And it echoed through the dark
From 14th street
Through all of Central Park
And as it came to an end
He held the last note long
And then he said ""My friend
You've just heard the last great song""

The last great song

You've just heard the last great song""",Last Great Song,2008

And keeps you alive

Cause you're the star
You know she's a talented beauty
She will steal your heart

That love was meant for beauty queens
And high school girls with clear skinned smiles
Who married young and then retired.
The valentines I never knew
The Friday night charades of youth
Were spent on one more beautiful
At seventeen I learned the truth.
And those of us with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social graces
Desperately remained at home
Inventing lovers on the phone
Who called to say come dance with me
And murmured vague obscenities
It isn't all it seems
At seventeen.
A brown eyed girl in hand me downs
Whose name I never could pronounce
Said, Pity please the ones who serve
They only get what they deserve.
The rich relationed hometown queen
Married into what she needs
A guarantee of company
And haven for the elderly.
Remember those who win the game
Lose the love they sought to gain
Indebentures of quality
And dubious integrity.
Their small town eyes will gape at you
In dull surprise when payment due
Exceeds accounts received
At seventeen.
To those of us who know the pain
Of valentines that never came,
And those whose names were never called
When choosing sides for basketball.
It was long ago and far away
The world was younger than today
And dreams were all they gave for free
To ugly duckling girls like me.
We all play the game and when we dare
To cheat ourselves at solitaire

Miki Howard,"I guess it was yourself you were involved with, 
I would've sworn it was me.
I might've found out sooner 
If you'd only let me close enough to see.
 
That ain't no way to treat a lady, no way to treat your baby,
Your woman, your friend.  That ain't no way to treat a lady, 
No way, but maybe it's a way for us to end.

Your woman, your friend.  That ain't no way to treat a lady, 
No way, but maybe it's a way for us to end.
There's a funny kind of consolation keeping me sane,
And I'd really like to share it, crawl on deep in my brain;
And see the times you never felt me lovin' you or needin' you,
So leavin' you now, you still won't know how to feel the pain.
 
I was lookin' out for my happiness
While you were lookin' within
And before you knew your own reflection
Always starts to tire you, it's happened again.

You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

Yellow Viper, yellow Hummer, Yellow Benz
Yellow PT Cruiser, yellow 'Lac on rims
Drop yellow 'Vette and a platinum Rolls Royce
That's seven different cars, everyday I got a choice
On my way to pick up Joyce, she be makin me moist
Givin me head while she hummin, she can play with her voice
And she got nice thighs, a big plump ass
She could ride a dick too, make me cum fast
I like them modelin bitches, I love them swallowin bitches
Where them hoes headed at, I'm 'bout to follow them bitches (let's go)
I know you with your folks, but that nigga is broke
You might as well open your legs up and let a nigga poke
I'm a show you what it is not to be a window shopper
Mama you can have Fendi, mama you can have Prada
All you gotta do is break a nigga off proper
You could be with your man, I ain't tryna stop ya

[Chorus: Mannie Fresh]
(Shine) - From my head down to my shoes

[Lil Wayne]
And the name be fire Wayne, ice and change
You can catch me in an aqua range, squattin things
With them twenty-two inch chopper blades
Diamond face, diamond brace
More colors than the game Simon Says
Go, 'hind me
And mami on forty-fifth she told me ""I'm a lez""
And she ain't like too much of dick 
but give the bombest head, and so I took it anyway
But bitch I got family, don't need your pussy anyway
OK, let's talk about this ice that I'm carryin
All these karats like I'm a fuckin vegetarian
Niggas play, I bury them, why'all already knowin
I threw up my arm and bitches thought it started snowin
See I'm a keep it goin, Big Tymin, you heard's me?
Dog I got cake like everyday my birthday
Wait, don't think they heard me
I say dog I got cake like everyday my birthday

Ride fly daily, all year 'round I shine
Ain't a nigga and they mama gonna stop me dog
Come through on dub-dueces, they jock me dog
Glock cocked for haters tryna block me dog
Catch 'em so low, they geezy, don't shock me dog
Well get the fuck, slide on out the way
And let B.G. ease down the shinin linen
Let the diamonds and the jewelry light shit up
Each piece of jewelry I own, I ice it up
You don't want to put your vehicle next to us
'Cause all of our vehicles, we dress 'em up
With television, Dreamcast, DVDs
Nice sounds, buttons, it's twenties
I'm a Cash Money Hot Big Tymer nigga
That'll hold a pinky finger up and blind ya nigga

Steady stackin my ends on dubs, twenty-four/seven
Every car you wish you had, we got it, we got it
Bentleys, Hummers and Jags, big bodies, big bodies
Love to floss, no secret stun'ner's
Niggas steady baller block, can't take nothin from us
Young nigga, livin a life surrounded by ice
Hoes be like, ""Damn, them boys, they're nothin nice""

Better think twice, get it right dog

To fit my ride, I put a dove in the inside

Hey, eh, uhn-uhn-ah, uhn-uhn-ah hold on, ro, huh

Oooh-wee, bad mother fucker, chrome pipes, and chromed out mufflers
Paint my cars, and dip these rods
Re-do the inside, 'cause stunna gon' ball
Shine my teets, when I hit these streets
Call hot boy Elvin, to slide me a piece
Slipped it girl, fed her some gas

Brawlers, bars, and marble's garage
Minks on the floor, with them platinum toys
Its 500 degrees, it's hot as fuck (uh uh-a, uh uh-a)
Believe me boy, my shit diced up
I stay one way, I play every day
Its February 15th, stunna, how's the day?

[Mannie Fresh]
Now if you believe, like I believe
We can get to the mountain top
We can achieve what Martin was talkin' bout
what's all the barkin' bout?
I'm a man playa, on my two feet, that's how I'm walking out
a lot of these chumps niggas say I just bling too much
But a lot of y'all ain't doing nothing, y'all just dream too much
And all of y'all niggas ain't coming up to nuttin but a big ole zero
And in case you didn't know nigga, I'm the hood hero

[Chorus - Gotti]
It's like a sunny day, plus I'm getting money today
With no funny play, 'cause I got the gun at my waist
And like stunna say, feeling like a hunter today
Million, mommy fine, but she got bumps in her face
But it ain't nothing but a G thang baby
So I'ma hit it in the back of my Mercedes
We on dubs, it's all love, this shit crazy
And Cash Money is the label that made me

[Mikkey]
Mikkey take em church, its on you what you take from this verse
We like a cedar, we just straight from the dirt
So it's in us, we stuck, like it's in us to
Cock..that..thang..back..and dump
Please, you don't want it wit us
Now they say money makes the world go round
But for the right price,
Stunna said yo girl done with the opposite of up
More than music this is rap hustlin'
This is money mackin' and publishin'
Death before struggling, that's shine daddy

[Chorus]",Sunny Day,2002
