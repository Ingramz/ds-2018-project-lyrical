The Jealous Girlfriends,"When I found this my languaje in a way I began to speak
My soul was free on a gust of inspiration
She was soaring over the walls built with shame 
Self doubt, and a midnight curfew
A form I had not yet seen engulfed me...
I was standing on the deck in the rain listening to jazz
Smoking a reefer cigarette and I swear
I swear I didn't think of you once
But I thought maybe

love is what you've been missing
Cause love is not what you've been giving
Maybe getting is all you've known till now
Or maybe you've forgotten how

he said ""do you write for you or other people?""
I said ""other people, I want them to see the beauty
That I can but just can not seem to touch,
Which is only a metaphor for all of us.""
I said ""I think I'm trying to capture a moment
I think my whole life I've been trying to capture
That moment..""
He said ""one thing you can be sure of, is that you 
Never will""
I thought maybe 

love is what I've been missing, 
Cause love is not what I've been giving
Maybe getting is all I've known till now
Or maybe I never even learned how

so I said ""lets try and keep things out of the space
That divides."" you said ""tha cracks between where we lie""
And we lie around so much, we lie around, lie around
Lie around, we just lay around the truth. so much.
Until you are. getting, getting, getting,
Going. gone!
You are getting, getting, getting, going, gone. 
You are for your love for your love
Cause I don't wanna wait today for you love. no.
I don't wanna wait today for you love.

The Jealous Girlfriends,"Yeah, so I'll be on my way
With only memories to fade
And all I carry with me
All the things I never see
I'm gonna look now

If I jump and fall and land
Flat on my face again
Then I know this too shall pass
Cause never ever really lasts
No not even the bad

And it's true my heart's a mess
Oh, but it was never really clean I guess
I have said all I will confess to you

Now it's just open road and open eyes
And right where the water meets the sky
Is where I'll hold you my dear
No you'll never be so near
As when my eyes are on the horizon

And it's true my heart's a mess
Oh, but it was never really clean I guess
I have said all I will confess to you",Carry Me,2007
The Jealous Girlfriends,"Wake up in red sheets
Smell the day
Taste the salt
Your fingertips are hieroglyphics
Waiting to behave themselves
And I'll not try
As ancient as we are
I'll not bleed your wasted fantasy

I don't know why you care 'cause I don't

Give me your break neck faceplate again
For heavens sake don't you
Forget about it
And I'll come running back
When love's on the line
For the second time
I'll be your pet
And you'll be mine

I don't know why you care 'cause I don't

You're just a throw away
You're just a throw away
A stone's throw away
From the center of a pyramid

The Jealous Girlfriends,"Frankly I'm not impressed
With the issue you've undressed
And you never come around
Little fingers creep up and under my neck tie

You can bury me with your bullets and your smile
They're one and the same and I won't blame you for trying
You can bury me with your bullets and your crime
They're one and the same and I won't blame you for trying

It's a stop in every town
Turn the ground upside down
When you say the world is there for me
Too bad I never liked the taste of oysters

You can bury me with your bullets and your smile
They're one and the same and I won't blame you for trying
You can bury me with your bullets and your crime
They're one and the same, I won't blame you for trying

You don't scare me with your tiny little eyes

The Jealous Girlfriends,"Say, say you want to go, well, then don't hesitate
It's been so long since you've been clear on anything
Lovers and police pull you back every time
And you ran with your hand in your mouth and a smoking gun

So don't leave your organs on the kitchen floor
And don't forget to close the door
Cause I am always here
There I am but where is he

You're living with mom again
You're waiting for will to kick in again
You're doing time at the food mart
With your eye on your purse
And your thumb in your heart

And then there's that saying that if you love something
You have got to set it free
But if it comes back then you are just
You're as broke as can be

So don't leave your organs on the kitchen floor
And don't forget to close the door

The Jealous Girlfriends,"Left your secret identity by the kitchen sink
Poisoned all this composure running in too deep
But I just sing
I've got all that I am needing
I've got all the life I'm breathing
Everything will be alright

Oh oh oh

When you feel there's nothing left to say
When one more day turns into one more day
Well just sing
I've got all that I am needing
I've got all the life I'm breathing

The Jealous Sound,"Dear, it's a lot like the way that we don't talk
Every day that I'm away I will be there
In the parking lot with the drugs we bought
The hope I had

I haven't got a prayer
I haven't got a prayer
And you're small and feeling used
Just stare and stay confused

Don't say what we've become
And, dear, I promise you
A change is overdue
By the time that I arrive I will be done

Whatever I do
Whatever I say to make you feel better
And every hour of every day it's all I ever
Hand me your hope

Just stay together
And they're all down with watching you drown
It's now or never here
It's about the things you see when you figure out

What the hell is going on
Bury me beneath the overpass and the empty streets
It's  better when I'm gone
And in the dark you say my name

I call you and you came
And it's more than I can bear
You're lost and left alone
And hope is never home

What's wrong is everywhere
Ask me I'm sure I'll tell you how we sing together now
And it leaves me
Ask her

I'm sure she'll tell you more
Just sing it like before

Well, don't you know these are days that leave you empty
They're leaving you cold
And say to me as we grow old
These are the days that last forever
Never let it go

And I braved what I could
And I stand where you stood
And I never breathed a word

And I could pray you never leave
This constant ache, I do believe
Reach down and deliver it
Swear to me now, ever since I hold my side
You're not convinced
And I'm told it's deliberate

And I braved  what I could
And I stand where you stood
And leave
Well, please watch
Please watch over me

I thought this day would never come
You're dealing with a sad one
I stay away, I'm deaf and dumb
I'm telling everyone
God, it's priceless

And I braved what I could
And I stand where you stood
And leave

Please watch over me

The Jebbs Band,"I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms

If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me, oh

If I can see it, then I can be it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

But you and I, we've been through that, and that is not our fate,
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late""

While all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl

The Jesus and Mary Chain,"Grass grows greener
On the other side
Corn grows sweeter
On the other side
And I watch, And I watch, And I watch
And I see too much
And I broke my face
And my head grows too much

On my soul
There's something dead inside my hole

In my hole
In my hole
In my hole

I step crueler
But less defined
Striped cats cooler
But so is mine
And I want to see
What I want to be
And I see me on a touching screen
And I'm dancing to a scream

It's too cool
To get something done
Too many things move fast
I can't quite get a grip at last
And all the stars don't shine
And all the stars don't shine
And all the walls fall down
And all the fish get drowned

Here it comes
Can't you hear the sound of it
Just like a big brass drum
And some cunts always scratching it
Just like a voice is pain
Just like the taste is pain

You have to learn to fly

The Jesus and Mary Chain,"Well I quit my job down at the car wash
Left my mother a goodbye note
By sundown I left Kingston with my guitar under my coat
Hitchhiked all the way down to Memphis
Got a room at the YMCA
For the next three weeks went hunting at nights
Just looking for a place to play
Well I thought my picking would set them on fire
But nobody wanted to hire a guitar man

Well I nearly starved to death down in Memphis
I run out of money and luck
So I bummed me a ride down to Mecon, Georgia
On an overloaded poultry truck
Thumbed on down to Panama City
Started picking at some of them all night bars
Hoping I could make myself a dollar making music on my guitar
Got the same old story the moment I'd appear
There ain't room around here for a guitar man
Don't need a guitar man son

So I slept in the hobo jungles
I roamed thousand miles of track
Till I find myself in Mobile, Alabama
At a club they call Big Jacks
A little four piece band was jamming
So I took my guitar and I sat in
I showed em what a band would sound like
With a swinging little guitar man

Show em son
If you ever take a trip down to the ocean
Find yourself down around Mobile
Make it on out to a club called Jacks
If you got a little time to kill
Just follow that crowd of people
You'll wind up out on his dance floor

Up and down the Gulf of Mexico
Guess who's leading that five piece band

You left there at the bart

You even let her drive your car
She wears your ring, you treat her oh so fine
But you're telling me that I'm the one that's on your mind

When she took a walk to the ladies room
You didn't hesitate to run to me
I don't want to be caught in the middle of you
But your charm keeps gettin the best of me

For our passage to arise,

Inside your golden garden
Got my ladder leaned up against your wall
Tonight's the night we planed to run away together
Come on Dolly Mae there's no time to stall
But now you're telling me
I think we better wait 'till tomorrow
Yeah, yeah,
I think we better wait 'till tomorrow
Girl what you talkin' about
I think we better wait 'till tomorrow

Got to make sure it's right
So until tomorrow goodnight
Oh what a drag

Oh Dolly Mae, how can you hang we out this way
On the phone you said you wanted to run off with me today
Now I'm sanding here like some
Turned down serenading fool
Hearing strange words stutter from the mixed-up mind of you
And you keep telling me that ah
I think we better wait till tomorrow,
What are you talkin' about
I think we better wait till tomorrow
Ah, I can't wait that long
I think we better wait till tomorrow

Got to make sure it's right
So until tomorrow goodnight
See if I can talk to this girl a little bit

Oh Dolly Mae girl you must be insane
So unsure of yourself
Leaning from you unsure window pane
Do I see a silhouette of somebody pointing
Something from a tree
Click bang
Oh what a hang your daddy just shot poor me
And I hear you say as I fade away

We don't have to wait till tomorrow
Hey
We don't have to wait till tomorrow
What you say
We don't have to wait till tomorrow

It must not have been right
So forever goodnight

We don't have to wait till tomorrow

We don't have to wait till tomorrow

The Jimi Hendrix Experience,"Angel came down from heaven yesterday
She stayed with me just long enough to rescue me
And she told me a story yesterday,
About the sweet love between the moon and the deep blue sea
And then she spread her wings high over me
She said she's gonna come back tomorrow

And I said ""fly on my sweet angel,
Fly on through the sky,
Fly on my sweet angel,
Tomorrow I'm gonna be by your side""

Sure enough this morning came on to me
Silver wings silhouetted against the child's sunrise
And my angel she said on to
""Today is the day for you to rise,
Take my hand, you're gonna be my man,
You're gonna rise""
And then she took me high over yonder

And I said ""fly on my sweet angel,
Fly on through the sky,
Fly on my sweet angel,
Forever I will be by your side""",Angel,1994
The Jimi Hendrix Experience,"The morning is dead
And the day is, too
There's nothing left here to meet me
But the velvet moon
All my loneliness I have felt today
It's like a little more than enough
To make a man throw himself away

And I continue
To burn the midnight lamp
Alone

Now the smiling portrait of you
Is still hangin' on my frowning wall
It really doesn't, really doesn't bother me too much at all
It's just the ever falling dust
That makes it so hard for me to see
That forgotten earring layin' on the floor
Facing coldly towards the door

I continue
To burn the midnight lamp
Lord, alone

Loneliness is such a drag

So here I sit to face
That same old fire place
Gettin' ready for the same old explosion
Goin' through my mind
And soon enough time will tell,
About the circus in the wishing well
And someone who will buy and sell for me
Someone to toll my bell

And I continue
To burn this old lamp
Lord, alone
Darlin' can't ya hear me callin' you?
So lonely
Gonna have to blow my mind

A tyrannosaurus launched a sneak attack
They fought, first Kong went down then up again
The fight went on, no one knew who would win
Kong reached and seized the monster with both hands
And summoned all his strength at his command

He beat his hairy chest and looked around

But will they ever want me?

The Jimmy Dorsey Orchestra,"Down on an island in the Southern Seas,
There lives a lassie named Minnie Breeze;
And all the natives agree that she's
The hottest thing in Trinidad!

When Minnie dances, I guarantee
With every move of her vertebrae
The temperature jump up ten degree!
In Trinidad that isn't bad!

Aye aye aye, they call her Minnie from Trinidad,
Aye aye aye, they all love Minnie from Trinidad,
Aye aye aye, and all the natives would be so sad
If Minnie ever left Trinidad!

Although the natives love Minnie so,
Minnie had herself a steady beau;
A fellow known as Calypso Joe,
And Minnie swore they'd never part!

But fate stepped in only as fate could,
Min won a contest for dancing good,
So she went away to Hollywood;
When Joe heard that it broke his heart!

In Hollywood Minnie traveled far,
They changed her name to Minnie La Mar,
And pretty soon she became a star,
The siren of the picture show!

But one day Minnie got awful mad,
A guy got fresh and she said, ""You cad!
My heart belongs to my Trinidad,
My Trinidad Calypso Joe"".

Aye aye aye, they call her Minnie from Trinidad,
Aye aye aye, in Hollywood Minnie met a cad;
Aye aye aye, but there is only one native lad
Gets chinny with Minnie from Trinidad!

So Minnie gave up her dough and fame,
And she went back to from where she came;
And when she got there she heard with shame
That her Calypso Jo was dead!

When she heard that, she almost died,
She got a gun to try suicide!
But as she started to shoot, she cried,
""I think I'd rather live instead!"".

But now the natives are mighty glad,
'Cause Minnie came back to Trinidad!

Aye aye aye aye aye aye aye,

On the school yard swings
When we exchanged graduation rings
One lovely yesterday
Time was when we wrote 
Love letters in the sand
Or lingered over our coffee and
Dreaming the time away.

Sleigh rides and never apart
Hikes in the country and 
There's more than one tree
On which I've a place in your heart

To tell everybody the whole tale about the 'Island',
Flint's treasure and Mr. Silver.
Keeping nothing back but its position and that only,
Because the major part of the treasure has not been lifted yet.
I personally think we would never have begun this adventure
And set course with the 'Hispaniola', if we had known
What would happen and that some of us would never return,
Having lost their lives. Sometimes the whole story haunts dreams
And brings me the worst nightmares I ever had.
That's when I hear the cries of the fallen,
The waves pounding the rocks on the coast and Captain Flint's
Raw voice screaming: 'Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight! Ha ha hah!'.
And I tell you, no oxen and wain ropes will ever take me
Back to Treasure Island!

Mr. Bones is fighting 'Black Dog'
He want to split him to the chine

Horse-hooves trampling his spine

Won't you change partners and dance with me?

Your eyes that promise sweet nights,
Bring to my soul a longing, a thirst for love devine.
In dreams I seem to hold you, to find you and enfold you,
Our lips meet and our hearts, too, with a thrill so sublime

Those cool and limpid green eyes -
A pool wherein my love lies.

So deep that in my searching for happiness
I fear that they will ever haunt me,
All through my life they'll taunt me
But will they ever want me?
Green eyes, make my dreams come true.

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,

What you percieve is to be truth
It is all so subjective
So what you believe is up to you

But what are we to believe in
Between the lies and the truth? Youth
Media has vested interest
So what you believe is up to you.

But how are we to make sense of these turbulent times
When all they do is censor our minds
Only telling what they want us to know
Only half of the story told

So what is wrong? What is right?
No truth can there be seen
Well it's all there in your new religion
Just turn on your TV screen

Watch the sex and drugs and all that violence
Look what they are feeding you
Propaganda yes indeed its,
Its all there to confuse

But how are we to make sense of these turbulent times
When all they do is brainwash our minds
Only telling what they want us to know
Only half of the story told

And if the truth can't be found
I'll find my own underground
And if the truth is never to be seen
I'll find my own in between

I know we'll be the best of friends.

Now its a month since your visit
And your memory lingers on,
Somehow feels like your around,

Take it all, I know you want my soul
And feel, what you want me to feel
But I will only conceal just a little more
From you
You're all alone, you're all alone
And you draggin everyone in
All alone and you don't even understand
Don't even understand

So I'll obey, listen to what you say
'cause you are in full control now
But you're so scared, so scared of losing it all somehow
You're all alone, you're all alone
And you draggin everyone in
All alone and you don't even understand
Don't even understand

See if you don't got the time to show just a little respect
You won't get any in return
And if you don't got time to have an open ear
You won't have anything to learn

Don't know why you don't even understand
Don't know why you don't even understand
Don't know why you don't even understand

Have you noticed that the shepherd is gone?
So walk gently lady
As you walk along

I've seen all but your Crusades succeed
And it's growing sour

Side of them

And then you know all that you think you might need to know
But even then, my little wing, you'll have to grow
You'll have to grow

So have you been to your God lately?
No Jesus Christ, he ain't nowhere to be seen

When I think about these cats running the world with hate
I say: something's gotta give

Got the whole world fighting for the Texas tea
Got a little for you, I got a little for me
But the kettle's leaking like a sieve

There's a puddle on the floor
There's a puddle in the sky
The kettle's leaking so much man it's burning my eyes yeah
Can't you just throw that damper out

On the subject of throwing stuff away
I know some deaf men who can't hear a word we say
No matter, No matter how loud we do shout

And I say...

Something's gotta give right now boy
Something's gotta give right now for you
Something's gotta give right now man
Something's gotta give right now

I was reading the newspaper just yesterday
Got the headlines reading God bless the USA
And I thought: God Bless Everyone

God bless the people in New York when they were attacked
God bless the children being bombed there in Iraq
God bless the goddamn junkie with a monkey on his back
God bless everybody under the sun

Cause the world ahead will end if we don't got love
Do your job and pay attention to God above
But eventually the only guarantee will be that the tea in your tank will run dry

Because without love you know there ain't no life
You can duplicate it and bottle it up all you like
But it doesn't mean you're gonna get another try
Get another try boy

Something's gotta give right now boy
Something's gotta give right now P-Yoo

Backstabbed man nothing forgotten

The more we fight we sink
And vengeance gives us hope

At least that's what we think, cause

As we make amends by
Getting our revenge
We sort nothing out
Just add to the doubt
And with God on both sides
Death is justified
Whatever the name
Then we're all to blame

So as the spirits fly
To honor those who've past
We've got to get along
While the time still lasts
Bury the hatchet deep
So we all can weeo 
And heal all this pain 
So, so we can live again
So, so we can live again

Things don?t seem to go my way
Got a dark cloud that's hanging
And it seems to follow me

Boy, won?t you just wake up 
And feel the humming
This good world is given you
Better start running
Catch up with your life
Catch on up
Before the whole thing is through

Have you once, have you twice
Have you even concieved
Go out and take another better look around
You are just another white boy Thinking your so hard
Go take a step out side 
See what?s shaking in the real world

Go take a step out side and see what?s shaking in the real world 
Go take a step out side and see what?s shaking in the real world

But you don?t know how my heart laments 
I've really got a good excuse to complain
My parents got divorced can?t heal the pain
Now there is only cheap regrets
I guess that?s just the way it be
Is it world, how I see me

Boy now you are really bugging
Really bugging 
Yes you are bugging me
Can?t you just shut right up
Your cup is overflowing
Overflowing
And you think it is empty
You don?t even know what side
You are fighting for
Boy would you turn your Game Boy off
Stop pretending it?s you against the world
I am sick and I am tired 
Of hearing you always say
""I really got a good excuse to complain
My parents got divorced can?t heal the pain""

Go take a step outside and see what?s shaking in the real world
Go take a step outside and see what?s shaking in the real world

Our parting ways, have met again
This is goodbye today

And if you do, someday you'll find
That I was right, and you were wrong
About the tie, that binds

The tie that binds, our love sweetheart
Was torn to shreds by you
But if you'll piece them up again
We'll start our life anew

And I may shed some better tears
My love I cannot hide",Maybe You Will Change Your Mind,1987
The Johnson Mountain Boys,"You'll never find a sweeter love
Than the love you gave to me
But I would not be satisfied
Now you no longer care for me.

   Now you've gone and left me alone 
   Oh why did I ever let you go?
   In this world I can never find
   A sweeter love than yours I'll never know.

Now my future looks so cold
So cold without you my dear
I realize that I'm to blame
But for my wrong I'm paying dear.

Now I think of you both night and day
I'm sorry dear I ever let you go
I know now that it's too late
A sweeter love than yours I'll never know.

As the fiddles played their music so low
I was happy as a king with the girl of my dream
Until she whispered sweetheart I must go

   You found me when my heart was low
   Now my heart will always yearn
   'Til the day when you return
   And we'll dance to the Old Virginia Waltz",Virginia Waltz,1987
The Johnson Mountain Boys,"I don't love you anymore not the way I did before
And since you've found someone new I think it's best
I don't cry and walk the floor I don't love you anymore
Trouble is I don't love you any less
I don't love you anymore for I've got no more love to give
You drained my heart of all its love with every sweet caress
I keep saying o'er and o'er I don't love you anymore
Trouble is I don't love you any less
[ steel + el.banjo ]
I held you close to me one time kissed your lips and called you mine
Then another came and thrilled you more I guess
I cried as you walked out the door I don't love you anymore
Trouble is I don't love you any less
I don't love you anymore...
Trouble is I don't love you any less
",I Don't Love You Anymore,1988
The Johnson Mountain Boys,"I'm wanting someone that's loved and lost
Someone that's known the thrill and paid the cost
Someone that says they'll never take a chance
On another broken heart, lies, false romance

   Wanted an unwanted love
   To share all the misery and pain
   Of a heart that's unwanted and loved
   And unwilling to gamble again

I don't want to love again I'm sure
Someone whose love is not sincere
I don't want someone who hasn't known
How it feels to love and be alone

I know there are others like me
Alone, footloose and fancy free
Yet chained to a love they'll never claim
And afraid to ever love again

   Like I cried through all those lonely years
   But I can't dry your tears it's been too long since love was here
   And I've already gave you my better years

And so the pages of time kept right on turning
They never stopped for us to harvest the years
And old embers of love kept right on dying
For there was no one to drown my tears.

But I've tried not to blame you
and I try not to shame you
All I can do now is wish you well
But if you should need a friend
I'll be there until the end
Just don't ask me to love you again.

   And don't come back to my doorstep a' crying
   Hoping for what's been dead so long
   For the embers have all turned to ashes
   There's nothing here but old memories and this song.

WITH MELBA MONTGOMERY

I'm dreaming tonight of the mountains that's where I long to roam
The roosters crow at the break of day in my Dixie home sweet home
Old people here they just don't care I never saw the beat
That road ahead is mighty long but it's Dixieland for me
I'm going back to my old home in the mountains far away
Where the wild red roses smell so sweet and the rippling waters play
Old people here they just don't care...
This city life is not for me I'm going where the neighbors speak
That road ahead is mighty long but it's Dixieland for me
Old people here they just don't care...
That road ahead is mighty long but it's Dixieland for me

Writers George Jones and George Riddle
Copyright 1966

Won't you beckon to our lonely Christmas call?
You left a year ago this Christmas and we're wondering if you miss us.
Don't know why you up and left and went away.
The kids are lonely here without you, even wrote old Santa about you.
Please don't leave them all alone this Christmas day.
Don't you miss their arms around you? Do their memories surround you?
Don't you know it's not their fault things are this way?
Why not show consideration to the ones whose heart you're breaking?
Give them your gift of love this Christmas day.
If you could see their little faces, as round the tree they take their places,
They're looking for the biggest gift of all.
So why not show consideration to the ones whose heart you're breaking?
Won't you beckon to our lonely Christmas call?

And sing all at the same time

On that broomstick pony of mine""

When the bad guys had to be stopped
And somehow his bullets never drew any blood
But the bad guys dropped when he shot""

He'd sent a thrill right up the aisle
And the endin' would always send us home

The Jordanaires,"There's a legend of a famous matador
Who went to meet El Toro
Though he fought as he had never done before
He could not beat, El Toro

The bull El Toro, brought him defeat and pain
And to his sorrow, the matador knew shame

They said time would never heal the many scars
Brought by the great, El Toro
And the bitterness that burned deep in his heart
Caused him to hate, El Toro

The bull El Toro, brought him defeat and pain
And to his sorrow, the matador knew shame

So one night, when no-one was on sight
The matador, went to finish the score
In the lonely fields, beneath the pale moonlight
He fought the bull...and they fought once more

When they found the matador and saw him dying
He'd never see tomorrow
Now they say that on the spot where he was lying
Still walks the proud El Toro

The bull El Toro, brought him defeat and pain
And to his sorrow, the matador knew shame
",El Toro,1963
The Jordanaires,"Pedro the bull was a killer
King of the bullfighter ringer
He'd wipe up the floor with each brave matador
And have matador stew for his dinner

He heard the crowd shouting ""Olé""
But he met his master that day

The bullfighter was a lady
And it was true love at first sight
Her red cape was waving but Pedro was shaking (or shaving?)
He wanted to date her that night

Olé

Pedro the bull he was smitten
First time the love bug had bitten
He once was a mad bull, a wild and a bad bull
But now he was mild as a kitten

The people were starting to hiss
But Pedro just wanted to kiss

The bullfighter was a lady
And Pedro he liked what he saw
He floated on air with a rose in his hair
As he waltzed with that sweet matador

His fate was a bad one, his tale is a sad one
It's hanging right over her door

A restless wind that yearns to wander
And he was born the next of kin

And I guess the sound of the outward bound
Made me a slave to his wandering ways

The Jordanaires,"What a beautiful thought I am thinking
Concerning a great speckled bird
Remember her name is recorded
On the pages of God's Holy Word.

All the other birds are flocking 'round her
And she is despised by the squad
But the great speckled bird in the Bible
Is one with the great church of God.

All the other churches are against her
They envy her glory and fame
They hate her because she is chosen
And has not denied Jesus' name.

Desiring to lower her standard
They watch every move that she makes
They long to find fault with her teachings
But really they find no mistake.

She is spreading her wings for a journey
She's going to leave by and by
When the trumpet shall sound in the morning
She'll rise and go up in the sky.

In the presence of all her despisers
With a song never uttered before
She will rise and be gone in a moment
Till the great tribulation is o'er.

I am glad I have learned of her meekness
I am proud that my name is on her book
For I want to be one never fearing
The face of my Savior to look.

When He cometh descending from heaven
On the cloud that He writes in His Word
I'll be joyfully carried to meet Him
On the wings of that great speckled bird.",Great Speckled Bird,1969
The Jordanaires,"I once was lost in sin, but Jesus took me in, 
And then a little light from heaven filled my soul
It bathed my heart in love and wrote my name above,

Now let us, have a little talk with Jesus, 
Let us, tell him all about our troubles, 
He will, hear our faintest cry, 
And he will, answer by and by
Now when you, feel a little pary'are wheel turning, 
And you, know a little fire is burning.
You will, find a little talk with Jesus makes it right. 

Sometimes my path seems drear,without a ray of cheer, 
And then a cloud of doubt may hide the light of day
The mists of sin may rise and hide the starry skies,
But just a little talk with Jesus clears the way. 

I may have doubts and fears, my eyes be filled with tears, 
But Jesus is a friend who watches day and night
I go to m in prayer, he knows my every care, 
And just a little talk with Jesus makes it right.",Just a Little Talk With Jesus,1969
The Jordanaires,"What a Friend we have in Jesus, all our sins and griefs to bear!
What a privilege to carry everything to God in prayer!
O what peace we often forfeit, O what needless pain we bear,
All because we do not carry everything to God in prayer.

Have we trials and temptations? Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged; take it to the Lord in prayer.
Can we find a friend so faithful who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness; take it to the Lord in prayer.

Are we weak and heavy laden, cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Savior, still our refuge, take it to the Lord in prayer.
Do your friends despise, forsake you? Take it to the Lord in prayer!
In His arms He'll take and shield you; you will find a solace there.

Blessed Savior, Thou hast promised Thou wilt all our burdens bear
May we ever, Lord, be bringing all to Thee in earnest prayer.
Soon in glory bright unclouded there will be no need for prayer
Rapture, praise and endless worship will be our sweet portion there.

I never knew that I could feel this way.
And heartache number two was when you came back again 
You came back but never meant to stay.

Every day you love me less, each day I love you more.
Yes, I've got heartaches by the number, a love that I can't win
But the day that I stop countin', that's the day my world will end.

Heartache number three was when you called me,
You said that you were coming home to stay.
With hopeful heart I waited for your knock on the door,
I waited but you must have lost your way.

Millions screamed to see him do his thing
Elvis touched the life of every ear that heard him
And they couldn't help but listen when he sang

It's a long way from Memphis to that mansion in the sky
But he kept his faith in Jesus all along
It's a long way from Graceland across Jordan to the Promised Land
But Jesus finally came to lead him home",From Graceland To the Promised Land,2000
The Jordanaires,"I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't be the same dear, if you're not here with me

And when those blue snowflakes start falling
That's when those blue memories start calling
You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue blue blue Christmas

You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas",Blue Christmas,2000
The Jordanaires,"God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen,
Let nothing you dismay;
Remember Christ, our Savior,
Was born on Christmas day,
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.

In Bethlehem, in Jewry,
This blessed Babe was born,
And laid within a manger,
Upon this blessed morn;
That which His Mother Mary,
Did nothing take in scorn.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.

From God our Heavenly Father,
A blessed Angel came;
And unto certain Shepherds
Brought tidings of the same:
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by Name.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.

""Fear not,"" then said the Angel,
""let nothing you affright,
This day is born a Savior
Of pure Virgin bright,
To free all those who trust in Him
From Satan's power and might.""
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.

The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind,
And left their flocks a-feeding,
In tempest, storm, and wind:
And went to Bethlehem straightway,
The Son of God to find.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.

And when they came to Bethlehem
Where our dear Savior lay,
They found Him in a manger,
Where oxen feed on hay;
His Mother Mary kneeling down,
Unto the Lord did pray.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.

Now to the Lord sing praises,
All you within this place,
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace;
This holy tide of Christmas
All other doth deface.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy",God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen,2000
The Jordanaires,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,2000

Sing in exultation,
Sing all that hear in heaven God's holy word.

Just like the ones I used to know
Where those tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleighbells in the snow

With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

The Jordanaires,"On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross the emblem of suffering and shame
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross and exchange it some day for a crown
[ piano ]
Oh that old rugged cross so despised by the world is a wonderous attraction for me
For the dear lamb of God left this glory above to bare it to dark calvary
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross...",The Old Rugged Cross,2000
The Jordanaires,"I was the world's champion lover to my baby
Undefeated and I treated baby right
I won every easy round against temptation
And I went right home to baby every night

Then I met an old flame that I used to train with
She gave me knock out kisses to the mouth
When baby learned there'd been a main event in secret
Oh she counted ten and throwed old champion out

But I'll make a comeback comeback this ain't the end
This has been champ will be a champion again
I was punch-drunk to cheat and lose my baby
For the second time they're twice as hard to catch
That's why I'm in training now to ask forgiveness
Getting in condition for my greatest match

I'm defending my claim to the title
I just can't lose I've got too much to win
And when I'm sure all the low blows are over
She'll say champ take off those gloves and come on in

That'll be my comeback comeback she'll kiss me and then
This has been champ will be a champion again
That'll be my comeback comeback she'll kiss me and then
This has been champ will be a champion again",The Comeback,2000
