Neil Diamond,"When the night returns just like a friend
When the evening comes to set me free
When the quiet house that wait beyond the day
Make peaceful sounds in me
Took a drag from my last cigarette
Took a drink from a glass of old wine
I closed my eyes, and I could make it real
And feel it one more time

Can you hear it, babe
Can you hear it, babe
From another time
From another place
Do you remember it, babe

And the radio played like a carnival tune
As we lay in our bed in the other room
When we gave it away for the sake of a dream
In a penny arcade, if you know what I mean

Here's to the songs we used to sing
And here's to the times we used to know
It's hard to hold them in our arms again
But hard to let them go

Do you hear it, babe
Do you hear it, babe
It was another time
It was another place
Do you remember it, babe

And the radio played like a carnival tune
As we lay in our bed in the other room
When we gave it away for the sake of a dream
In a penny arcade, if you know what I mean",If You Know What I Mean [#],2003

Neil Diamond,"Love on the rocks
Ain't no surprise
Pour me a drink
And I'll tell you some lies
Got nothin' to lose
So you just sing the blues all the time

Gave you my heart
Gave you my soul
You left me alone here
With nothing to hold
Yesterday's gone
Now all I want is a smile

First, they say they want you
How they really need you
Suddenly you find you're out there
Walking in a storm
When they know they have you
Then they really have you
Nothing you can do or say
You've got to leave, just get away
We all know the song

You need what you need
You can say what you want
Not much you can do
When the feeling is gone
May be blue skies above
But it's cold when you love's on the rocks

First, they say they want you
How they really need you
Suddenly you find you're out there

Sometimes carry me

You'll know, by the love in my eyes
And the beat of my heart

You'll know, cause you'll never be lonely again
Anytime anywhere
This I promise 
If you Marry me

Promise you'll stay with me

Will come true, who knows

There you will say
They're in need of a mountain of love.
Sail away, and you reach all the way down to China.

That we can go higher still than we ever dreamed of.
Don't you know
There are magical places inside the heart?
Come on, let's go.
We got room on that mountain of love,
Room enough to surround every living thing we seel
Room enough to include even you and me.

The stars are brightly shining,
It is the night
Of the dear Saviour's birth

Long lay the world
In sin and error pining
Till He appeared

The weary soul rejoices,
For yonder breaks

Once in a while I would call asking only to know
And once you were mine long ago when the evening was warm and free
Once you were mine when the evening was full with that glow

Knowing the way we were
Once in a while, once in a while

And who could have known we'd have flown far away from the way we were

And I was night time
I one day woke up
To find her lying
Beside my bed
I softly said
""Come take me""

For I've been lonely
In need of someone
As though I'd done
Someone wrong somewhere
I don't know where
Come lately

You are the sun
I am the moon
You are the words
I am the tune
Play me

Song she sang to me
Song she brang to me
Words that rang in me
Rhyme that sprang from me
Warmed the night
And what was right
Became me

You are the sun
I am the moon
You are the words
I am the tune

That I came to travel

Yeah, that's how I feel
When I look in your eyes,
I feel primitive

Uncivilized
Like something
From out of the heart of the jungle,
Uncivilized

Foolish mind
Believing that passion
Is somehow a rational thing at all
And that's when you take that fall

I'm livin' my life
In such a primitive way
I was doing alright before you came
I said okay,
You said okay, it's okay

Tentative
There's nothing about you
That's even the slightest bit tentative
But you remain,
Still you're a woman
And yet in a way representative
Of woman kind,
Believin' the notion
That love and devotion will rise again
Why can't we just be friends

I'm living my life in such a primitive way
I was doing alright before you came
I said okay,
It's okay, it's okay

Just look at me
Feel like a river of quivering jelly,
No man at all

Calling from the street below
Baby, since I've been without you
Well, it's the only song I know

And I keep hearing rainy day songs
Tapping on my window sill
Some that soon won't be forgotten
Some that probably never will

Say, I know you never did believe in rainbows
But hey, you know the sun is somehow gonna shine
And babe, we only have to look and we can find it
If we want to, if we need to

It's just another rainy day song
Way beneath the sorry sky
And when I try to understand it
I only end up asking why

But still I hear those rainy day songs
Calling out to me and you
I only hope that you can hear them
'Cause rainy days are made for two

Say, you know there's always gonna be a rainbow
And hey, you know that sun is always gonna shine
Come on babe, we only have to look and we can find it
If we want to, if we need to

Can you hear that rainy day song
It's such a lost and lonely sound
But baby when I have you near me

I got a story to tell you
About an unlikely hero
Dig it

Rudolph the red nose reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glowed
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
""Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""
Then how the reindeer loved him,
As they shouted out with glee
""Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer
You'll go down in history!""
Yes you will
Yes you will

And just remember all you kids out there
If the other kids laugh at you
Just cause you're a little different
Hey, you could be just like Rudolph
A hero some day
An inspiration
You'll remember that now, won't you

We'll pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man

As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made

And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun
With mister snowman

Neither one of us taking the middle ground

Now, I know better

Neil Diamond,"I knew a man, Bojangles and he danced for you 
 In worn out shoes 
 Silver hair, a ragged shirt and baggy pants 
 The old soft shoe 
 He jumped so high 
 He jumped so high 
 Then he'd lightly touch down 
 I met him in a cell in New Orleans, I was 
 Down and out 
 He looked to me to be the eyes of age 
 As he spoke right out 
 He talked of life 
 He talked of life 
 He laughed, clicked his heels and stepped 
 He said his name, Bojangles and he danced a lick 
 Across the cell 
 He grabbed his pants, a better stance 
 Oh, he jumped so high 
 Then he clicked his heels 
 He let go a laugh 
 He let go a laugh 
 Pushed back his clothes all around 
 Mr. Bojangles 
 Mr. Bojangles 
 Mr. Bojangles 
 Dance 
 He danced for those in minstrel shows and county fairs 
 Throughout the south 
 He spoke with tears of fifteen years how his dog and him 
 Traveled about 
 The dog up and died 
 He up and died 
 After twenty years he still grieves 
 He said I dance now at every chance in honky tonks 
 For drinks and tips 
 But most the time I spend behind these county bars 
 He said I drinks a bit 
 He shook his head 
 And as he shook his head 
 I heard someone ask him please 
 Please

Denies the worried look that's on my face
Connected through the years
It somehow took us both in separate ways
Was on a day that time forgot
Another day that time forgot
Oh no
Oh no

Should've held you till the storm went by
We had nothing left to hang on to
Too many words you said
But not the words connected me to you
Just another day that time forgot
Another day that time forgot
Oh no
Oh no

The two of us we both just let it fly
Didn't see it leave; didn't even try.
I only know that we were moving on
Suddenly it's gone; Heaven knows why.
Oh no
Oh no

Don't have a reason I can give
At least not one that I can understand
Just somehow disappeared
It slipped beneath the fingers on my hand
It was on a day that time forgot
Another day that time forgot
Oh no
Oh no

We had it once, but we just let it fall
Should've held it close; could've had it all.
I'm thinking about the life we could have made
Lost the one we had somewhere along the way
Oh no
Oh no

I woke up all alone again
A half-remembered dream inside my head

Followed me at night into my bed

May be time to start thinking again.

But till that's clear
Then don't go there.

This thing is liable to take some funny turns
The only thing, a real concern to me
Is having you protect yourself

No, life ain't fair
Don't go there.

Once you're in, you might not get out.

They got a new drug for your mood that'll surely thrill you.

But I could not fight what I knew was true I was

With my back to the wall l use to be I'd go straight ahead

Was like I had no power at all

I never knew before that two was more then one and one
Until that night
There's nothing I could do but think of how I'm losing you
And it shook me it shock me
You locked me out there

Looking for a place I could hide
Searching for a corner to turn  
Left me here alone for one night
Showed me I had something to learn
I tried not to need you but I needed you anyway

I knew that it was getting late
But I hung on I had no choice at all
It was either walk away or crawl and

I think I'm falling deeper into that hole
Deeper then I thought I could get
Like a bug that's stuck in a bowl climbing out is impossible
Yet he keeps trying harder,
Harder then he thought he could

I finally understood
I could hear I could see and the truth came through

Catch those sounds of your heartbeat before it's leaving
You say you want satisfaction
Just steaming away from the action
Get some traction
Between you and the scenery

Say hello way
Not to fast
It don't last
Just follow my reflection

See that view
It's for you
Just pay some affection

Forget about competition
Your dover and intuition
Stop your wishing
Won't get there by dreaming

Slow it down you
Take your time
Even last and reclaim

To find my soul in need of care
Whose name is called
To answer when that need is there
A name that sings, who's music sours
Whose name is called

A quiet that belongs to me
To be released
From on a loud and angry scene

Thinking she'll be there but she never comes
And then I wake up and wipe the sleep from my eyes
And I rise to face another day without her
Do do do, do do do do, do do do

It's just no good anymore
When you walk through the door of an empty room
And then you go inside and set a table for one
It's no fun when you spend a day without her
Do do do, do do do do, do do do

We burst the pretty balloon
Took us to the moon, it's such a beautiful thing
But it's ended now and it sounds like a lie
If I said I'd rather die than live without her
Do do do, do do do do, do do do

Love is a beautiful thing
When it knows how to swing and it moves like a clock
But the hands on the clock tell the lovers to part
And it's breaking my heart to have to spend a day without her

And no one cried, they simply turned away.
And when he died,
He left a table filled with nails and pride.
And with his hands he carved these words inside:
""For my children""

Morning light, morning bright.
I spent the night with dreams that make you weep.
Morning time,
Wash away the sadness from these eyes of mine,
For I recall the words an old man signed:
""For my children""

And the legs were shaped with his hands,
And the table made with oaken wood.
And the children that sat around this great table,
Touched it with their laughter, and that was good.

Morningside, the old man died.
And no one cried, he surely died alone.
And truth is sad,
For not a child would claim the gift he had.
The words he carved became his epitaph......

For a sleigh ride together with you
Outside, the snow is falling

And friends are calling: ""You hoo""

For a sleigh ride together with you

Just look at the snow
We're riding in a wonderland of snow

Just holding your hand
We're gliding along with the song
Of a wintry, wonderland
Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like

Birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

There's a birthday party
At the home of Farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs
We love to sing without a single stop

At the fireplace
While we watch the chestnuts pop
There's a happy feeling
Nothing in the world can buy
When they pass around the coffee

And the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print
By Currier and Ives

We remember all through our lives

We'll pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: ""Are you married?""
We'll say: ""No man""

When you're in town

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

And in the meadow
We can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun
With mister snowman
Until the other kids
Come knock him down

You don't think that you will
But you do
But I know that I don't have time enough
And I'll never get over losing you

I've been hungry
But not for awhile

No, I'll never get over losing you",Losing You,2010
Neil Diamond,"The words I have to say
May well be simple but they're true
Until you give your love
There's nothing more that we can do

Love is the opening door
Love is what we came here for
No one could offer you more
Do you know what I mean
Have your eyes really seen

You say its very hard 
To leave behind the life we knew
But there's no other way
Now it's really up to you

Love is the key we must turn
Truth is the flame we must burn
Freedom's the lesson we learn
Do you know what I mean
Have your eyes really seen

Love is the key we must turn

Just you and me lyin' out in the sun
I knew that somebody would soon come to get you
Was hopin' that maybe I could be the one

Knew that I wanna be

And now everywhere I go
I go havin' you on my mind

Were hopin' that maybe the right train would come
I heard myself startin' a conversation

Lookin' at me with a strange kind of smile
I knew that you'd take me where I'd never been to
Was hopin' you'd ask me to stay for a while

Get it right with a few small corrections
Find a groove, you just got to stay with it
Got to move, it's your life got to live it

Spirit down, look around
There's a cold wind a-blowin'
Being strong's what you long for
But you've got to show it
You're too vain to complain and ashamed
No one knows you at all

And you're alone at the ball
You're all alone at the ball

Got a car
Cadillac
El Dorado
Take it far, up to high Colorado
Got to move, it's your life got to live it
Find a groove then you got to stay with it

Hey this life's all about striking out taking chances
What's the point of it all if you call no one answers
Spend your time make rhyme
Just to find no one dancing at all

Then you're alone at the ball
You're all alone at the ball

Sing your song move along
'Cause the future awaits you
Free your brain from the chains
That remain to enslave you
Took your hits kept your wits
Never flinched stayed yourself through it all

Now you're alone at the ball
You're all alone at the ball
All alone, at the ball
You're all alone
Alone at the ball
You're all alone

Neil Diamond,"She said, it’s time to teach you the art of love
She said, we’re gonna reach to the heart of love
A place you never knew, a place that lives somewhere inside of you

I know I’m on a journey I won’t forget
I know I had it in me to give and yet I never could
Before I had to, if I wanted to be yours

You made me see I’d have to be a brand new man
He lives in me, so here in me is where I began

You showed the kind of lesson I can’t erase
You showed a way to get from that lonely place
To where love comes alive
And you’d be waiting there when I arrived

The truth was clear,
Love’s not a place you go to find
It lives in here
Just leave it space, give it time

I learned that I could stumble and maybe fall
I learned in being humble I’d have it all
A brand new way to live,
That love’s not what you have but what you give
And the art of love is who you share it with",The Art of Love,2014
Neil Diamond,"Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
First time
How do you feel?
Little bit strange it's little unreal that
First time
You're far from home
Finally out there on your own and it's
Your time
For making it happen
It's your time, and it's gonna happen your way
Every step you take from now on,
Be taken as far as you can
You oughta be moving along
Singing your song, and making your plans
First time, first time

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
First time
Like a Ferris wheel
Scared to go, but it's no big deal that
First time
It's always the best
Remember it's still you forget all the rest it's
Your time
So live in the moment
It's your time, you don't want to throw it away!
Still remember the first word you wrote
And every single note that you've played!
Got a book and you learned it by road
Long time ago, remember that day?
Make rhyme
So fine
First time!

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
First time
It comes unaware,
You're un-rehearsed, and unprepared for that
First time, you're free and unbound
No planet's safe gotta jump on the sound it's
Your time
And good things will happen
But this time, you gotta put your heart in the game!
You're out for the very first time,
But you're not really out there alone
Keep doing it, and words gonna spread
Get out of your bed, set out on your own.
Keep trying
Be fine
First time!
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh

This time
The whole world is watching
This time, you better put your heart in the game!
You're rocking for the very first time

And every single ? Going out
Leaves less of a doubt, it's all in the past!

You shine
You're flyin'

How do I leave behind everything we knew?
Looking inside of myself, where my heart it'd be
And all I see is you there too

Two of us goin' around in a state of denial, girl
Neither believin' the way it all came down
Didn't count much lost in paying the cost for a while, girl
Then this old world stopped spinning 'round

In better days we had it all
In better days when love came easy
We had it all but I never knew
How much there was when I had you
In better days, in better days

I remember a time there wasn't a dime between us two
We lived in a little old place on the side of a hill
Gave it our best in love, did the rest for me and you
Too young to lose, too hot to chill

In better days we had it all
In better days when love came easy
We had it all but I never knew
How much I lost when I lost you
In better days, in better days

Why do we promise forever and never stay that long?
Why do we swear to care until we die?
And what does it mean when two lovers sing loving songs
Then move along, and not know why

In better days we had it all
In better days when love was easy
We had it all but I never knew
How much there was between me and you

In the middle of a bad dream
Like I took on the whole world
And I never had a chance, girl

Was a one-way conversation
I never got the invitation
The sharpness of her words deceiving
And I couldn't stop the bleeding

And Lord, I tried to be forgiving
But getting by don't mean you're living
And on that highway going nowhere
Was an exit overdue

And all she had to give was heartache
So she broke my heart in two
Yes, she did

You found me drifting in a small boat
In the middle of an ocean
You were there on my horizon
And I didn't have a notion

Unprepared to comprehend it
Felt alone and unattended
Said my prayers and reached my hand out
And you appeared to me that day

Came and led me to a new shore
I had never been there before
Put me in the right direction
And you led me out of Hell

And if it wasn't for your good heart
I'd have never broke her spell
'Cause you promised me tomorrow
But I learned that lesson well
Yes, I did. Oh yes, I did

You're the sum of all my heartbeats
You're the only truth my heart needs
Showed me how to make the journey
I can't let you walk away, no, not today

'Cause I've already slept with heartache
Time to chase the night away
Just the two of us together
And does forever sound okay?

Neil Diamond,"She had a sunny disposition
He had a cloud that never went away
She woke up singing almost every day
It turned him all around
And brought him in from the pouring rain

She had a sunny way of talking
And when she finished she'd always smile
It wasn't flashy but she had style
She touched him so profound
That he was never to be the same

First she had him walking
Then he'd be talking
Walking and talking
And soon he'd be laughing out loud

Never would believe it
If you couldn't see it
She came to be someone that he could not be without

They made a sunny combination
You wouldn't think so but it was true
They heard a voice coming from the blue
True love was calling out
And it was calling them both by name

Started with a whisper
Pretty soon he kissed her
That's when that whisper
Turn into a mighty roar

More than just affection
Made a real connection
That's when he knew she was what he was missing before

She gave him plenty inspiration
And every song he wrote from then til now
Had something about it explaining how
She turned his life around

Before her sunny disposition
He didn't know where he was going
She had a funny way of knowing
And knowing felt so right
When she became his wife
She brought her disposition",Sunny Disposition,2014

Or do I sing like a bird released

Slung in a hammock
Gathering reams of space and time

Hanging in the light above the bed

I guess I'll be all right
But tonight it's driving me mad

Fail to materialize
Way beyond my understanding
Find my only comfort in your hands

Hold me now

Say what lies between us
A host of everyday distractions

At the height of summer; see a boy of five
At the water's edge so nimble and free
Jumping over the ripples, looking way out to sea

Now a man comes up from amongst the throng
Takes the young boy's hand, and his hand is strong
And the child feels safe, yeah, the child feels brave
As he's carried in those arms up and over the waves

Deeper water, deeper water, deeper water, calling him on
Let's move forward now and the child's seventeen
With a girl in the back seat, tugging at his jeans
And she knows what she wants; she guides with her hand
As a voice cries inside him: ""I'm a man! I'm a man!""

Deeper water, deeper water, deeper water, calling him on
Now the man meets a woman, unlike all the rest
He doesn't know it yet, but he's out of his depth
And he thinks he can run; it's a matter of pride
But he keeps coming back like a cork on the tide

Well the years hurry by, and the woman loves the man
Then one night in the dark she grabs hold of his hand
Says: ""There, can you feel it kicking inside?""
And the man gets a shiver right up and down his spine

Deeper water, deeper water, deeper water, calling him on
So the clock moves around, and the child is a joy
But Death doesn't care just who it destroys
Now the woamn gets sick, thins down to the bone
She says: ""Where I'm going next, I'm going alone.""

So watch me walking, out the door""

On Olympic to her door

Walking in slow motion like he'd just been hit

Neil Finn,"Come on baby I want your love to be
Based in real life better than TV
What was before the action of desire
Becomes a deeper need for comfort, inspiration

Somehow to realise no trouble is in vain
It’s a reason for and how it came to pass
If there is a chance if there is a chance
That you wanted to dance, that you wanted to sing
Don’t die wondering,
Was there something missing?

Come on baby I want your love to be
Big and strong enough to rise above me
Don’t leave your best designs buried in your dreams
They’re sneaking up on you, give you an adventure
Our destiny is better than before
Those old familiar foes can’t hurt you anymore
And it’s a war I’m waging with the enemy
If there is a chance, if there is a chance
That you wanted to jam that you wanted to sing
Don’t die wondering
If there is a chance, if there is a chance
That you wanted to dance that you wanted to sing
Don’t die wondering

If we both get carried away
I’d be happy to see
At the end of the world

As we lay in the bath
Letting our hair down

If we end up paying the price
For this beautiful scene
At the end of the world

In my blood …the sparkle in your eyes
In my blood …the moment when I die

How I wish that I could do this again

Her cries mistaken for the sound of loneliness
There are far too many stars
On the earth there is but two of us
Gingerly down there for my hand is a thief
I’m bound to fumble when the moment is right
As another one is lost its a kind of release
And it’s coming to me with a sense of relief

Ancient dragons and the cicadas come
The edges jagged as you’re coming undone
On the white soft feathers of your bed

On the rack where your reputation lies
Do you want to exist
Between the lightning and the mental bliss

With the colours that you choose

I make any excuse to stay home
But I can’t do that and I must come back

Watching a game of thrones
And wondering what comes next
Well you can’t do that and you must come back

Pronouncing that she won’t get burned again
Her armour’s very shiny and her message is divine
But I wish she’d take a day off now and then

She said it clears your head when you come back from the dead
With your sword as sharp as anything that cuts
And to prove it she bisected three young tourists from Utrecht
Which rapidly displayed a lot of guts

She says we need to
Raise a brand new army
And the flag of France
So proudly she unfurled
And the people that
She hated will be neatly bifurcated
And the British will
No longer rule the world

(She says) it was a mistake to let them burn her at the stake
And she learned a lesson back there in the flames
So she’s going to kill the queen and then she’ll rescue Old Orleans
And it’s really hard to hang around with saints

I think I ought to tell her that the English left in failure
And they don’t go back to France except on hols
But I saw her vivisect a man who wanted to correct her 
And the playground soon resembled Grand Guignol

She says we need to
Raise a brand new army
And she marched us
Round until we couldn’t stand
She says the nation
She abhors will soon be writhing on the floor
And the British will
No longer rule her land

And she’s waiting for the dauphin who will come across the ocean
And knows that God agrees with her complaints
So I’m hoping she’ll ignore my English accent in her war

Heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demands

We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong
Searchin' our hearts for so long
Both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield

You're beggin' me to go then makin' me stay
Why do you hurt me so bad
It would help me to know
Do I stand in your way, or am I the best thing you've had
Believe me, believe me, I can't tell you why
But I'm trapped by your love and I'm chained to your side

Searchin' our hearts for so long
Both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield

We're losing control
Will you turn me away or touch me deep inside
And before this gets old, will it still feel the same
There's no way this will die
But if we get much closer, I could lose control
And if your heart surrenders, you'll need me to hold

You'd decide where and when
Just when you think you got it down
Your heart securely tied and bound
They whisper, promises in the dark

Armed and ready, you fought love battles in the night
But too many opponents made you weary of the fight
Blinded by passion, you foolishly let someone in
All the warnings went off in your head
Still you had to give in

Just when you think you got it down
Resistance nowhere to be found
They whisper, promises in the dark

But promises, you know what they're for
It sounds so convincing, but you heard it before
'Cause talk is cheap and you gotta be sure
And so you put up your guard
And you try to be hard
But your heart says try again

You desperately search for a way to conquer the fear
No line of attack has been planned to fight back the tears
Where brave and restless dreams are both won and lost
On the edge is where it seems it's well worth the cost

That you were sent from up above
Give me a sign - let's not waste any more time
Cause what we got here is True love, yeh, yeh

Cancel my membership, I won't be needing it no more
Found something else to occupy my nights
And baby it's just the right

Maybe I just wouldn't know what to do with my strength anyway

Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?",Over the Rainbow,1973
Neil Larsen,"We don't exist
We are nothing but shadow and mist
In the mirror we look as we pass
No reflection's revealed in the glass
Don't you know that the blood in your vein is as lifeless as yesterday's rain?
It's a game where we come to conceal the confusion we feel
But as long as we're nameless our bodies are blameless
You cried when we kissedIt was nothing but shadow and mist
Two illusions who touch in a trancemaking love not by choice but by chance
To a theme that we tore from the past to a tango we swore was the last
We are shadows who dance

Neil Larsen,"This is a strange affair
The time has come to travel 
But the road is filled with fear
This is a strange affair
My youth has all been wasted 
And I'm bent and grey with years
And all my companions are taken away
And who will provide for me 
Against my dying day
I took my own provision, 
But it fooled me and wasted away

Oh where are my companions?
My mother, father, lover, friend, and enemy
Where are my companions?
They're prisoners of death now, 
And taken far from me
And where are the dreams I dreamed 
In the days of my youth
They took me to illusion when they 
Promised me the truth
And what do sleepers need to make them listen,
Why do they need more proof?
This is a strange, this is a strange affair

Won't you give me an answer?
Why is your heart so hard 
Towards the one who loves you best?
When the man with the answer
Has wakened you, and warned you, 
And called you to the test
Wake up from your sleep that builds 
Like clouds upon your eyes
And win back the life you had 
That's now a dream of lies
Turn your back on yourself and if you follow,
You'll win the lover's prize
This is a strange, this is a strange affair",Strange Affair,1993

Neil Sedaka,"You think you know me pretty well,
But how can you tell,
You never get inside my head.
The times we talk, we never speak,
We play hide and seek
So many things are left unsaid.
 
Why can't you see
What's on the other side of me,
The side of me that reaches out to you.
Sweet thoughts and dreams,
Like drops of rain on rippling streams
That wind and bend,
Rivers with no end,
Flowing on the other side of me.
 
It seems I always get unstrung
I trip on my tongue
With words that come out something else.
I'm so afraid the things I say
Might chase you away,
I have to hide behind myself.
 
Why can't you see
What's on the other side of me,
The side of me that reaches out to you.
Why must I hide
These feelings that have been denied.
Only you can set me free
See what's on the other side of me.

Promises won't help us stay together

And it's all that I can do to keep from running after you

I let you walk away

My hands begin to tremble and my knees shake
Somewhere along the line I hope we can make amends

Wet down the painful sting of sweet love lost
Let evening find us whispering in our whiskey
Come and sit beside me for a while

At least we tried to reach an understanding

Who lost his love through his indifference
A heart that cared, that went unchecked
Until it died in his silence

And solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him, takes him down
And by himself, it's easy to pretend
He'll never love again

And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire

Another day, a lonely day
So much to say that goes unspoken
And through the night, his sleepless nights
His eyes are closed, his heart is broken

And solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him, takes him down
And by himself it's easy to pretend
She's coming back again

And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere

You messed me up for good right from the very start 
Hey now, go play Robin Hood with somebody else's heart 
You got me jumping like a crazy clown
and I don't feature what your putting down 
Well since I kissed her loving lips of wine 
the thing that bothers me is that I like it fine

'Til I met you Sunny.
You cleared my cloudy skies
Pretty little Sunny.
You made the rain disappear,
It's just like magic when I hold you near.
Oh Sunny, stay by me.
 
I never wore a smile
'Til the day I found you.
Now all I do is smile
Whenever I'm around you.
It's such a wonderful world,
Say that you'll always be my sunshine girl.

My life was sad and lonely,
I never saw the sun.
But the very moment that I held you tight
I walked out of the darkness and into the light.
 
I love no one but you

Love me for ever as you do today.

What am I gonna do on Wednesday night
When I used to call you on the phone,
What am I gonna say at the Record Hop
When I show up alone.
There all ask me what's become of you,
Darling can't we make up soon
'Cause I don't know what I'm gonna do.

At the movies or at the football game,
Please believe me, nothing's gonna be the same.

will remember stage door Jenny,
Well I saw her last night 
and man she looked like she wasn't gettin' any 
Oh - Rock 'n' roll kind of took its toll 
when she shed her inhibitions,
Too many scenes in limousines 
and dressing room intermissions.

She was the queen of nineteen sixty four
But the truth of the matter is 
nobody wants her any more.
There was a time she could have shown them how,
But nobody wants an over-age groupie now.

When it came to a superstar, 
Jenny was a bragger,
She spread it around to everyone in town 
that she made it with Mick Jagger
Oh - but there's no doubt, when the truth comes out, 
true love will always conquer,
She didn't get Mick, but she got a kick 
and a black eye from Bianca.

She was the queen of nineteen sixty four,
What a pity she became a shadow of the girl she was before.
She passed her prime, it seems a shame somehow,
But nobody wants an over-age groupie now.

Dwee da da da da da da , dwee da da da da.
Dwee da da da da da da da da, da da da da da,

I'm afraid that this morning's trade 
had a sad obituary,
There'll be no more Jenny at the door, 
They took her to the cemetery 
Just an autograph book and a stereo, 
there was no one she was close to,
She was found with her arms around an Elvis Presley poster.

She was the queen of nineteen sixty four,
Tonight there'll be a moment of silence at the Troubador.
There was a time she could have shown 'em how,
But nobody wants an over-age groupie now,

Because my Angel Eyes ain't here

They glow unbearably bright
Need I say that my love's mis-spent
Mis-spent with Angel Eyes tonight

Voa tao leve, mas tem a vida breve
Precisa que haja vento sem parar

Follow the fellow who follows a dream.
Follow the fellow, follow the fellow,
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.

'Twas a sumptuous gift bequeathed to a child.
Oh, the lure of that song 
Kept her feet running wild.
For you never grow old and you never stand still
With a whippoorwill singing beyond the next hill.

So, I bundled me heart and I roamed the world free.
To the east with the lark
Tow the west with the sea.
And I searched all the world and I scanned all the skies.
But I found it at last in my own true love's eyes.",Look to the Rainbow [From Finian's Rainbow],1995

For she found someone new.

How, how was I to know she'd soon go,
And leave me longing in the moon glow?

Since she's gone I'm alone,
I have no sweetheart of my own.
Just a memory of a love that's grown cold,
And a tarnished moon of gold.

Neil Sedaka,"Hey Lord, won't trouble never end.
Tell me, are you still my friend?
I got such a heavy load.
When will I reach that glory road?

[Chorus]
One more mountain to climb;
One more river to cross.
I come such a long long way, and, still,
I got a long way to go.
Weary all of the time,
I've been tumbled and tossed;
There's always one more mountain to climb,
And one more river to cross.

Hey Lord, I'm nothing but a man;
I try to do the best I can.
Sometimes the road is hard to see.
Please, Lord, won't you walk along with me?

[Chorus x 2]",One More Mountain to Climb,1998
Neil Sedaka,"You tried to wake me in the morning;
This was our moment of goodbye.
You asked me once: how long I'd love you.
I told you: till the day I die,
And now, at last, my life is over.
You cannot go where I have gone.
I won't be there to share tomorrow.
I love you so, but life goes on.
Dry your eyes, Rosemary Blue;
Take a look outside.
There's a world that waits for you.
Live your life, Rosemary Blue;
Put your lonely tears away.
Wait an' see; there'll come a day
I'll be with you.
 
We used to walk the world together
And found our love along the way,
But now you must go on without me;
We cannot live in yesterday.
Don't bring your flowers to the church yard;
Only the past is waiting there.
You should be out somewhere, forgetting;
Wearing those flowers in your hair. 
Dry your eyes, Rosemary Blue;
Take a look around.
There's a world outside that waits for you.
Live your life, Rosemary Blue;
Put your lonely tears away.
Wait an' see; there'll come a day
I'll be with you.

Images of yesterday from nineteen seventeen.

Laurel and Hardy, hello, how are you?

I can't hear your voices
But it's clear to me,
You prove that there was once a time
When life was trouble-free.

Stop and count 'til ten,
Remember all the happy days and smile again.

Neil Sedaka,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Neil Sedaka,"In the spring when the feeling was chronic
And my caution was leaving you flat,
I should have made use of the tonic
Before you gave me that!
A mental deficient you'll grade me.
I've given you plenty of data.
You came, you saw and you slayed me,
And that-a is that-a!

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all.
What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will,
You've made your kill
'Cause you took advantage of me!
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow.
So what's the use,
You've cooked my goose
'Cause you took advantage of me!

I'm so hot and bothered that I don't know
My elbow from my ear.
I suffer something awful each time you go
And much worse when you're near.

Here am I with all my bridges burned,
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned,
So lock the doors
And call me yours
'Cause you took advantage of me.

When a girl has the heart of a mother
It must go to someone, of course;
It can't be a sister or brother
And so I loved my horse.
But horses are frequently silly-
Mine ran from the beach of Kailua
And left me alone for a filly,
So I-a picked you-a.

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all.

In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

Baby, you and I keep the well from runnin' dry
And that's why I pray for rain

Long and empty nights of life without your love
Like a barren waste of arid desert sand
Start to flower and the juices start to flow
When I met you it was rainin' and little did I know

That I would pray for rain
Look for love to keep on fallin'
Baby, you and I keep the well from runnin' dry

Neil Sedaka,"When I was young, no worries in my head,
I used to flap my arms, and fly around the bed,
Just like a super bird, zoom, zoom, zoom.
Up and down the chandelier, all around the room.

When I told the people that I could really fly,
They said that little boys ain't supposed to lie.
Poor little super bird sitting on the ground,
No zoom, zoom, zoom, when anyone's around.

Fly, fly, fly super bird, super bird.
While you're young super bird, super bird.
There's time enough to wreck your dreams.
Have your fun, super bird.

They said I couldn't, so what did I do then?
I cried myself to sleep and never tried again.
Poor little super bird they woke you up too soon.
No Santa Claus or green cheese on the moon.

It skipped my mind for years, at least until tonight,
When I tucked the kids in bed and I turned out the light.
There at the doorway, you'll never guess what I heard
""Zoom, zoom, zoom, super bird.""

The only way to keep her, is to keep it to myself.

Making plans was so much fun
We set our goals and reached the highest star

Come to marry his fortune with a hand full of promises
To find they've closed the door they don't want him anymore

Will remember Stage-Door-Jenny
Well, I saw her last night and man, she looked
Like she wasn't gettin' any
(Awwwwwwwww!)
Rock and roll kinda took its toll
When she shed her inhibitions
Too many scenes in limousines
And dressing room intermissions

She was the queen of 1964
But the truth of the matter is
Nobody wants her anymore
There was a time she could've shown you how
But nobody wants an overage groupie now

When it came to a superstar
Jenny was a bragger
She spread it all around to everyone in town
That she once had Mick Jagger
(Ooooooooooh!)
There's no doubt when the truth comes out
True love will always conquer
She didn't get Mick but she got a kick
And a black eye from Bianca

She was the queen of 1964
What a pity she became a shadow of the girl
She was before
She passed her prime, it seems a shame somehow
But nobody wants an overage groupie now

I'm afraid that the Morning Trade
Had a sad obiturary
There'll be no more Jenny at the door
They took her to the cemetary
(Awwwwwwwwwww!)
Just an autograph book and a stereo
There was no one she was close ta
She was found with her arms around
An Elvis Presley poster

They said that little boys ain't supposed to lie.

Who lost his love through his indifference
A heart that cared that went unshared
Until it died within his silence

And solitaire is the only game in town
And every road that takes him, takes him down
While life goes on around him, everywhere
He's playing solitaire

And keeping to himself, begins to deal
And, still, the king of hearts is well concealed
Another losing game's come to an end

His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.

Neil Stacey,"He deals the cards as a meditation
And those he plays never suspect

I know that diamonds mean money for this art

The way I never felt before and
All the mistakes that I made

And invitations to teenage parties
""Dress in white"" one said, with quotations
From someone´s wife, a famous writer
In the nineteen-twenties
When you´re young you find inspiration
In anyone who´s ever gone
And opened up a closing door
She said: ""We were never feeling bored

´Cause we were never being boring
We had too much time to find for ourselves
And we were never being boring
We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends""
And we were never holding back or worried that
Time would come to an end

When I went I left from the station
With a haversack and some trepidation
Someone said: ""If you´re not careful
You´ll have nothing left and nothing to care for
In the nineteen-seventies""
But I sat back and looking forward
My shoes were high and I had scored
I´d bolted through a closing door
I would never find myself feeling bored

We had too much time to find for ourselves
And we were never being boring
We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends""
And we were never holding back or worried that

You could always rely on a friend

In rented rooms and foreign places
All the people I was kissing
Some are here and some are missing

The creature that I always meant to be
But I thought in spite of dreams
You´d be sitting somewhere here with me

Said she was gonna go and get herself a real man instead

Behind the cricket pavilion and the bicycle shed
Trembling as your dreams came true

You've forgotten all the promises of that first friend
It's bad enough, she knows how you feel
But she's not prepared to share you with the memory

Awkward as an elephant
In the crowded court of your love

And clumsy as I felt
At stumbling on this theft
To save further embarrassment

Neil Warner,"[On a late night in the spring of 1827 
The city of Vienna is experiencing the largest lightning storm in its long history. 
Within a large disheveled room, 
Ludwig Von Beethoven is slumped over his piano 
And on the piano sits the just completed manuscript for his tenth symphony. 
It is his final, and he is certain, his greatest work.]

Since the time when ra and isis
Raised the sphinx out of the sand
And apollo dreamed athena
And men began to understand

That when darkness folds on darkness
In the restless tides of night
And lightning raises shadows
And for moments gives them life

It's been said by those who ponder
That it surely is a sign
That a life touched by the stars
Is now running out of time

And that somewhere in that darkness
In the heart of that great storm
The world returns a soul
That the gods caused to be born

And this was such a storm
The kind one rarely sees in life
For in a room now filled with shadows
The great Beethoven was spending

His last night

[From the shadows a beautiful spirit, fate, 
And her deformed dwarf son, twist, 
Emerge to inform Beethoven of what he has already deeply suspected, 
That this is to be his last night on earth. 
They are accompanied by numerous spirits and ghosts from his past.]",Overture,1986
Neil Warner,"To dream the impossible dream 
To fight the unbeatable foe 
To bear with unbearable sorrow 
And to run where 
The brave dare not go 
To right the unrightable wrong 
And to love, pure and chaste from afar 
To try when your arms are too weary 
To reach the unreachable star 
This is my quest 
To follow that star 
No matter how hopeless 
No matter how far 
To fight for the right 
Without question or pause 
To be willing to march
March into hell 
For that heavenly cause 
And I know 
If I'll only be true 
To this glorious quest 
That my heart 
Will lie peaceful and calm 
When I'm laid to my rest 
And the world will be 
Better for this 
That one man, scorned 
And covered with scars
Still strove with his last 
Ounce of courage 
To reach the unreachable
The unreachable
The unreachable star 
And I'll always dream 
The impossible dream 
Yes, and I'll reach

Neil Wolfe,"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Neil Young,"I think this song is an instrumental. And it's also a Beachboy cut from the 
Petsounds album. I remember that for two reasons--listening to the album and 
not being sure why a Beachboy song would appear here, and reading a Rolling 
Stone review.
I remember this Rolling Stone Magazine article complaining about the fact that 
Brian Wilson used the song at the end of the album. I'm pretty sure that 
""Let's Go Away For Awhile"" was a Beachboy song from Petsounds that Brian used 
at the end of Journey Through the Past. And I think Brian was involved in the 
album's production. 
Because the last few tracks have the sound of surf--at least that's the way I 
remember it--it would make sense. I enjoyed the album, especially the Buffalo 
Springfield stuff, and because I have been a Neil Young fan since I was in the 
seventh grade when I heard the first Buffalo Springfield song, I really don't 
care what critics say. I try to appreciate his artistry. It's an interesting 
way to end a great album.",Let's Go Away for Awhile,1972

They were planting in the full moon
They had given all they had for something new
But the light of day was on them,
They could see the thrashers coming
And the water shone like diamonds in the dew.

And I was just getting up, hit the road before it's light
Trying to catch an hour on the sun
When I saw those thrashers rolling by,
Looking more than two lanes wide
I was feelin' like my day had just begun.

Where the eagle glides ascending
There's an ancient river bending
Down the timeless gorge of changes
Where sleeplessness awaits
I searched out my companions,
Who were lost in crystal canyons
When the aimless blade of science
Slashed the pearly gates.

It was then I knew I'd had enough,
Burned my credit card for fuel
Headed out to where the pavement turns to sand
With a one-way ticket to the land of truth
And my suitcase in my hand
How I lost my friends I still don't understand.

They had the best selection,
They were poisoned with protection
There was nothing that they needed,
Nothing left to find
They were lost in rock formations
Or became park bench mutations
On the sidewalks and in the stations
They were waiting, waiting.

So I got bored and left them there,
They were just dead weight to me
Better down the road without that load
Brings back the time when I was eight or nine
I was watchin' my mama's T.V.,
It was that great Grand Canyon rescue episode.

Where the vulture glides descending
On an asphalt highway bending
Through libraries and museums, galaxies and stars
Down the windy halls of friendship
To the rose clipped by the bullwhip
The motel of lost companions
Waits with heated pool and bar.

But me I'm not stopping there,
Got my own row left to hoe
Just another line in the field of time
When the thrashers comes, I'll be stuck in the sun
Like the dinosaurs in shrines

To give what's mine.",Thrasher,1979

Singin' with too much soul
I heard you got out on parole
Workin' for the queen.

Landscape again
Keepin' all the grounds around her clean
Workin' for the queen.

Don't take out the magic pen
Don't draw on the infinity board
Your buildings, if they rise again
Would do much better on the ocean floor
They'll never feel the way they did before
They did before.

Out on the ocean floor, out on the ocean floor
What could be stranger than the unknown danger
That lies on the ocean floor?

Breakers crash on the beach
I count them like lambs in my sleep
They come at me steady
They know I'm not ready
They pound on my mattress door
Have they got a big one in store.

Plays echoes in the alleyway

Claims another day

Rises on the runway
The pilot understands
The money changes hands
Inside the jet the briefcase snaps, goodbye

Through nets, by hooks, and hungry bears.

And my belly's scraping on the rocks
I still think someone really cares
And I'll keep swimming till I stop.

Never lose the will.

I'm like a singer on the stage
With the golden lights and liquid rage
Down from the mountains to the sea

It keeps my gills from getting dry
But it distorts things in my eyes
Sometimes I see what really isn't there
Like my true lover, and I care.

Got the will to love, the will to love.
I'll never lose it, never lose the will to love,
Never lose the will.

And I repeat myself till all my friends are gone
And get lost in snow and drown in rain
And never feel the same again.

I remember the ocean from where I came
Just one of millions all the same
But somewhere someone calls my name
I'm a harpoon dodger, and I can't, won't be tamed.

I'll never lose it, never lose the will to love,
Never lose the will.

I'll know my river has run dry

Train train, comin' 'round the bend
Well it took my baby, but it never will again (no, not again)

Train train, comin' down, down the line
Train train, comin' down the line
Well it's bringin' my baby, 'cause she's mine all, all mine

Neil Young,"Rainin' in my heart
Since we been apart
I know I was wrong
Baby please come home

You got me cryin'
'Bout to lose my mind
Don't let me cry in vain
Try my love just once again

Spoken:
Honey, I need your love
Darlin', you know why
If you would come back home
There'll be no need for me to cry

With a dollar bill in my hand.
Gonna go fishin' in the afternoon,
Got a simple plan.
Oh yeah, baby.

I got to hold on,
I got to be strong,
I got to live long,
And be with you.

Lonely nights and lonely days,
When I'm not with you.
Learned to trust and I learned to give,
Found a love that's true.
Oh yeah, baby.

I got to hold on,
I got to be strong,
I got to live long,

Girl it shouldn't be too hard,
To live with you.
It's really not complicated,
Until I get the blues.

Come on over and sit right down,
Let me take your hand,
I got a love gonna fill you up,
Take you to the promised land.
Oh yeah, baby, oh yeah.

Got to be strong now,

Neil Young,"On the hill where Custer was,
Making his last stand,
With the Indians all around,
And his gun in his hand.

Such a wind was blowing that day,
Through the battleground,
I could feel it in my hair,
As I turned towards downtown.

Weaving through the buildings,
Cutting though the streets,
Slicing through the culture,
Piling on the weeks.

Going home, I'm going home.
Going home, I'm going home.
Going home.

Dropping in on you my friend,
Is just like old times,
Said the fool who signed the paper,
To assorted slimes.

It's hard to get blood from a stone
But for you I'll give it a try,
To provide your accomodations,
And leave you satisfied.

You'd think it was easy,
To give your life away,
To not have to live up to,
The promises you made.

Going home, I'm going home.
Going home, I'm going home.
Going home.

Elusively she cut the phone,
Moved from cell to cell,
Really looking remarkable,
And obviously doing well.

She made a turn on a wooden bridge,
Into the battleground,
With a thousand warriors on the ridge,
She tried to turn her radio down.

Battle drums were pounding,
All around her car,
She saw her clothes were changing,
Into sky and stars.

Going home, I'm going home.
Going home, I'm going home.
Going home, I'm going home.
Going home, I'm going home.
Going home.",Goin' Home,2002

I got some friends that I could go to working for
Still I wish you'd change your mind,
If I asked you one more time
But we've been through this a hundred times or more

Four strong winds that blow lonely, seven seas that run high
All those things that don't change, come what may
If the good times are all gone, and I'm bound for moving on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way.

If I get there before the snow flies, and if things are looking good
You could meet me if I sent you down the fare
But by then it would be winter, not too much for you to do
And those winds sure can blow cold way out there

Four strong winds that blow lonely, seven seas that run high
All those things that don't change, come what may
If the good times are all gone, so I'm bound for moving on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way.

Neil Young,"Born and raised in a prairie town
Just a kid full of dreams
We didn't have much but an old radio
Music came from places we'd never been

Growing up in a prairie town
Learning to drive in the snow
Not much to do so you start a band
And soon you've gone as far as you can go

Winter nights are long, summer days are gone
Portage and Main fifty below
Springtime melts the snow, rivers overflow
Portage and Main fifty below
Portage and Main fifty below

All the bands in a prairie town
Try to outdo the next in line
Learning records out of Liverpool
Dreams of England on their Minds

On the other side of Winnipeg
Neil and The Squires played the Zone
But then he went to play
For awhile in Thunder Bay
He never looked back and he's never coming home

Just a band from a prairie town
Sometimes we'd drive from coast to coast
One call from LA and we'd pack and fly away
But in our hearts we're always prairie folk

Looking back at a prairie town
People ask me why I went away
To fly with the best, sometimes you have to leave the nest
But the prairies made me what I am today",Prairie Town,2004
Neil Young,"It's time, I'm walkin' to New Orleans
I'm walkin' to New Orleans
I'm gonna need two pair of shoes
When I get through walkin' to you
When I get back to New Orleans

I've got my suitcase in my hand
Now, ain't that a shame?
I'm leavin' here, today
Yes, I'm goin' back home to stay
Yes, I'm walkin' to New Orleans

You used to be my honey
Till I lost all my money
No use for me to cry
I'll see you bye and bye
When I get back to New Orleans

And I got no time for talkin'
I've got to keep on walkin'
New Orleans is my home
That's the reason why I'm goin'
