Craig Fletcher,"Even the bad times are good when you're round
Darlin', you kiss away all my blues
Even the hard times are easy to face
'Cause I know that your love will come through.
 
You light up my flame, then you drive me insane
There ain't nothing that you cannot do
Then you grab for my heart, you just tear it apart
As I shoot all my love into you

[Chorus]
Lovin' is easy with both eyes closed
You know that's the best way to feel it
Lovin' is easy with both eyes closed
Just get a hold and watch how it grows.
 
Now even the bad times are good when you're round
Darlin', you kiss away all my blues.
Even the hard times are easy to face
'Cause I know that your love will come through.
 
You light up my soul, and then fill up the whole
Of your being, your love, your desire
Then you grab for my heart you just tear it apart
As I shoot all my love in your fire

Lovin' is easy ...",Loving Is Easy,2001
Craig Fletcher,"Rain, sea, surf, sand, clouds and sky
Hush now baby, don't you cry
There's a mocking bird
Singing songs in the trees
There's a mocking bird
Singing songs
Just for you and me 

Rain, sea, surf, sand, clouds and sky
Time will see your tears run dry
There's a mocking bird
Singing songs in the trees
There's a mocking bird
Singing songs
Just for you and me 

Rain, sea, surf, sand, clouds and sun
Bless the tears of love now gone
There's a mocking bird
Singing songs in the trees
There's a mocking bird
Singing songs
Singing just for me",Mockingbird,2001
Craig Fletcher,"All the nights that I've missed you
All the nights without end
All the times that I've called you
Only needing a friend

Now your eyes shine with beauty
That I missed long ago
Guess the truth is I love you
I can't say any more

'Cause I need you
Yes I want you
Yes I love you 
As I look from my window

To the streets where you stand
I am gazing through dark glass
We can't walk hand in hand
Though your friends try to tell me

Though your friends you defend
They keep my heart from your heart
We must be in the end

'Cause I love you
Yes I need you
Yes I love you 

All the nights that I've missed you
All the nights without end
All the times that I've called you
Only needing a friend

Now your eyes shine with beauty
That I missed long ago
Guess the truth is I love you
I can't say any more

'Cause I need you
Yes I want you
Yes I love you",Poor Man's Moody Blues,2001
Craig Fletcher,"When I was a young man
Money was my hero
Something to believe in
Something to be seen 
Now looking at the big lie
Looking back on my life
I'm adding up the zeros
In the book of might have been 

When I was a young man
I was someone's hero
Someone to be seen with
Someone to believe 

Now looking at the big lie
Looking back on my life
All that dirty water
In the river of my dreams 

All that dirty water in my dreams 

When I was a young man
Being cool came easy
Playing in the big lights
Trouble came for free 

Now looking at the big lie
Looking back on my life
Trying to find the good seed
Now I'm down here in the weeds 

All that dirty water in my dreams 
All that dirty water in my dreams 

When I was a young man
Music was my saviour
Took me to the fast lane
Answered all my needs 

Now looking at the big lie
Looking back on my life
All it did was show me
All the things that might have been 

All that dirty water in my dreams
All that dirty water in my dreams
All that dirty water in my dreams
All that dirty water in my dreams",River of Dreams,2001
Craig Fletcher,"She said, ""Why don't you come and stay with me
Far away from people we know?
We could live our lives together
Happiness wherever we go""
And I will always love her
And I will always care
And I will always love her

Wasn't long before she grew tired of me
And the life she thought would redeem
All the love she'd thrown away as a child
All the things she thought she had seen

And I will always love her
And I will always care
And I will always love her

And I will always love her
And I will always care
And I will always love her
",She Said,2001
Craig Fletcher,"I woke up to a feeling, it was cold by my side
You had gone with the sunrise, leaving tears in my eyes
I got up with a feeling of an emptiness inside
To the noise of the sidewalk and the silence of my mind 

Well I walked out this morning, down a street with no name
To a club called ""The Loser"", like a dog that's gone lame
Took the club elevator to the floor with a view
I took out life subscription, it's the only one they do 

I stepped out on the guard rail, saw the crowds slowly part
Heard a voice shouting ""Don't jump, please for God's sake let me move my car!""
Felt a hand on my shoulder, heard a voice cry ""Just in time!""
Felt the quick push, felt the air rush
Felt the sidewalk, fell in line",Suicide,2001
Craig Fuller,"Well the night that was high, we got into town
Was the night that the rain, it froze on the ground
Down the street I heard such a sorrowful tune
Comin' from the place they call the Spanish Moon

Well I stepped inside, and stood by the door
While a dark-eyed girl sang, and played the guitar
Hookers, and hustlers, filled up the room
I heard about this place they call the Spanish Moon

One false step, you get done in
It's a cold situation
If that -- that don't -- kill you soon
The women will down at the Spanish Moon

I pawned my watch, and I sold my ring
Just to hear that girl singing, (hear that girl sing)
Don't take long, to wake up ruined
The women will down at the Spanish Moon",Spanish Moon,2008
Craig Furkas,"I miss you, miss you

Hello there 
The angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim 
Of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends

I miss you, I miss you
I miss you I miss you

Where are you?
And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick strange darkness
Comes creeping on so haunting every time
And as I stared I counted
The Webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop the pain tonight
Stop this pain tonight

Don't waste your time on me 
You're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me 
You're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)

Don't waste your time on me 
You're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me 
You're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me 
You're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me 
You're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)

I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you",I Miss You,2005
Craig G,"Listen closely, so your attention's undivided
Many in the past have tried to do what I did
Just the way I came off, man I'm gonna come off
Stronger and longer, even with the drum off
I keep on goin' and flowin' just like a river
I got a whole lot to give so I'm-a give a
Little at a time, new trails are blazin'
Action is in effect, and always stays in
Yeah, just like a shot from a cannon
I am the man in charge and I've been plannin'
A jam strong enough that it can life your soul
I'm the originator, and my rhymes are made of gold
Once you hear the capital ""a"" rap, it'll stay
With you for awhile, it won't go away
Unless you force it, because it stays with you, my friend
And if you toss it away, I'm-a hit ya again
I project my voice so it's right in the crowd
There's a sign at the door: no bitin' allowed
And if you didn't read it I suggest you do so
Or you'll be stranded, just like caruso
Sleep if ya want to, go 'head, get some shut-eye
A man broke his jaw tryin' to say what I
Say on the microphone, you shoulda left it alone
Just for the record, let it be known
That my ego's only partially grown
And never will I ever condone biting in any form, yo I'm only warm
That verse was the calm, now here's the storm
Next up (yo, I believe that's me)
Craig g, light up the mic for the symphony

This jam is dedicated to all un-optimistics
That though I wasn't coming out with some exquisite rhymes
But that's alright, 'cause now I'm back
To kill all the rumors and straighten the facts of me
Not rockin' rhymes like I always used to
But you jumped on hte tip when you heard me and the juice crew
You said, ""mmm mmm mmm, ain't that somethin?
Yo craig, I head you in that jam, and it's pumpin'
I apologize, oh yeah, and uh, can I have your autograph for me and my grandma?""
That's how I'm livin': all surprise mode
Don't even sleep, try not to keep your eyes closed
'cause if you do, when you awaken, your so-called spot will be taken
I'll take you over like a greedy executive, 'cause on the mic my prospective is
To be the best in all rap events, and since I have a call, I call experience
Next up(yo, I believe that's me)
Cool g rap, light up the mic for the symphony

Yo, marley gives the slice, I get nice
And my voice is twice as horrifying as Vincent Price
Goes deep, till you fell in a spell of a sleep
And while I'm countin' the money, you count sheep
When g rap strikes the mic, I recite the type of hype that you like
And make the people unite
I grip up hips and zip up lips, step on reps, you flip and want to sip on my tip
Take a deep breath, because you don't have another left
Comin' back like I'm avengin' my brother's deat
Makin' veterans run for medicine
'cause I put out more lights in a fight than con edison
Rip the damn cage like I'm on a rampage
And if you want rage, I'm-a make front page
Read the headlines, suckers, today's the deadline
Your head is way past bedtime
Can't kill though, solo, 'cause you're still all soft like a pillow
My rap is rougher than brillo
So fear me, don't dare dare me
And don't compare me to him when you hear me
Talk about a battle but you ain't yet ready for war
Your metaphor sucks more than a whore
You can't replace me, ice me or ace me, bass me, face me, slice me or race me
Bite me or taste me I'll show you that I got force
My rap burns your mouth like hot sauce
Run for water while I break your tape recorder
Server-to-sucker: the order is manslaughter
Another rapper, g rap wrecks, he's rated x, to mean the boy is sex, next
The amplifier gets used and abused, pumps so loud, we might blow a fuse
This is anger, madness, ready to hang 'er
Rapper or singer I'm puttin' up my middle finger
Next up (i believe that's me)
Big daddy kane, get on the mic for the symphony

Settin' it off, lettin' it off, beginnin'
Rough to the endin', you never been in
To move the groove with the smooth rap lord
Like a bottle of juice, rhymes are being poured
Down your ear, crisp and clear
As I prepare to wear, tear and smear then I'm outta here
With a mark left that you can all cling
'cause rockin' a party? yo, it's a small thing
I rip many places on regular basis, and broken down mics were the only traces
That I'd been there and there at the party
The mic had my prints, and on it was a body
So take caution, I'm not horsin' around in a throwdown, clown
I'm takin' yours son
So just acknowledge the way that I kick it
'cause if rap was a house, you'd be evicted
And dismissed from the microphone, chokin' on a bone, 'cause daddy's home
And battlin' me is hazardous to health
So put a quarter in your ass, 'cause ya played yourself
Like a game in the arcade, you need a far aid
I'm walkin' the path that allah made
I'll attend and then begin to send a speech to reach and teach
So just say when
So I can let lyrics blast like a bullet
My mouth is the gun on suckers I pull it
The trigger, ya figure, my pockets gettin' bigger
'cause when it comes to money, yo, grant's my nigga!
You've got the groove, mcs, freeze, stand still, nobody move
It's a sabotage, as I take charge, don't barge, 'cause gotdamn, I'm livin' large
Like a giant, you're nothin' but a midget, a small digit
You ain't hit it, forget it, quit it
I reign superior, always takin' care o'ya
No-frill rappers, you will evaporate, disintegrate, deflate to your fate
As the great will dominate straight to the state
Of reignin', gainin, so put kane in, that category, period, end of story",The Symphony,1988

Craig G.,"Listen closely, so your attention's undivided
Many in the past have tried to do what I did
Just the way I came off, man I'm gonna come off
Stronger and longer, even with the drum off
I keep on goin' and flowin' just like a river
I got a whole lot to give so I'm-a give a
Little at a time, new trails are blazin'
Action is in effect, and always stays in
Yeah, just like a shot from a cannon
I am the man in charge and I've been plannin'
A jam strong enough that it can life your soul
I'm the originator, and my rhymes are made of gold
Once you hear the capital ""a"" rap, it'll stay
With you for awhile, it won't go away
Unless you force it, because it stays with you, my friend
And if you toss it away, I'm-a hit ya again
I project my voice so it's right in the crowd
There's a sign at the door: no bitin' allowed
And if you didn't read it I suggest you do so
Or you'll be stranded, just like caruso
Sleep if ya want to, go 'head, get some shut-eye
A man broke his jaw tryin' to say what I
Say on the microphone, you shoulda left it alone
Just for the record, let it be known
That my ego's only partially grown
And never will I ever condone biting in any form, yo I'm only warm
That verse was the calm, now here's the storm
Next up (yo, I believe that's me)
Craig g, light up the mic for the symphony

This jam is dedicated to all un-optimistics
That though I wasn't coming out with some exquisite rhymes
But that's alright, 'cause now I'm back
To kill all the rumors and straighten the facts of me
Not rockin' rhymes like I always used to
But you jumped on hte tip when you heard me and the juice crew
You said, ""mmm mmm mmm, ain't that somethin?
Yo craig, I head you in that jam, and it's pumpin'
I apologize, oh yeah, and uh, can I have your autograph for me and my grandma?""
That's how I'm livin': all surprise mode
Don't even sleep, try not to keep your eyes closed
'cause if you do, when you awaken, your so-called spot will be taken
I'll take you over like a greedy executive, 'cause on the mic my prospective is
To be the best in all rap events, and since I have a call, I call experience
Next up(yo, I believe that's me)
Cool g rap, light up the mic for the symphony

Yo, marley gives the slice, I get nice
And my voice is twice as horrifying as Vincent Price
Goes deep, till you fell in a spell of a sleep
And while I'm countin' the money, you count sheep
When g rap strikes the mic, I recite the type of hype that you like
And make the people unite
I grip up hips and zip up lips, step on reps, you flip and want to sip on my tip
Take a deep breath, because you don't have another left
Comin' back like I'm avengin' my brother's deat
Makin' veterans run for medicine
'cause I put out more lights in a fight than con edison
Rip the damn cage like I'm on a rampage
And if you want rage, I'm-a make front page
Read the headlines, suckers, today's the deadline
Your head is way past bedtime
Can't kill though, solo, 'cause you're still all soft like a pillow
My rap is rougher than brillo
So fear me, don't dare dare me
And don't compare me to him when you hear me
Talk about a battle but you ain't yet ready for war
Your metaphor sucks more than a whore
You can't replace me, ice me or ace me, bass me, face me, slice me or race me
Bite me or taste me I'll show you that I got force
My rap burns your mouth like hot sauce
Run for water while I break your tape recorder
Server-to-sucker: the order is manslaughter
Another rapper, g rap wrecks, he's rated x, to mean the boy is sex, next
The amplifier gets used and abused, pumps so loud, we might blow a fuse
This is anger, madness, ready to hang 'er
Rapper or singer I'm puttin' up my middle finger
Next up (i believe that's me)
Big daddy kane, get on the mic for the symphony

Settin' it off, lettin' it off, beginnin'
Rough to the endin', you never been in
To move the groove with the smooth rap lord
Like a bottle of juice, rhymes are being poured
Down your ear, crisp and clear
As I prepare to wear, tear and smear then I'm outta here
With a mark left that you can all cling
'cause rockin' a party? yo, it's a small thing
I rip many places on regular basis, and broken down mics were the only traces
That I'd been there and there at the party
The mic had my prints, and on it was a body
So take caution, I'm not horsin' around in a throwdown, clown
I'm takin' yours son
So just acknowledge the way that I kick it
'cause if rap was a house, you'd be evicted
And dismissed from the microphone, chokin' on a bone, 'cause daddy's home
And battlin' me is hazardous to health
So put a quarter in your ass, 'cause ya played yourself
Like a game in the arcade, you need a far aid
I'm walkin' the path that allah made
I'll attend and then begin to send a speech to reach and teach
So just say when
So I can let lyrics blast like a bullet
My mouth is the gun on suckers I pull it
The trigger, ya figure, my pockets gettin' bigger
'cause when it comes to money, yo, grant's my nigga!
You've got the groove, mcs, freeze, stand still, nobody move
It's a sabotage, as I take charge, don't barge, 'cause gotdamn, I'm livin' large
Like a giant, you're nothin' but a midget, a small digit
You ain't hit it, forget it, quit it
I reign superior, always takin' care o'ya
No-frill rappers, you will evaporate, disintegrate, deflate to your fate
As the great will dominate straight to the state
Of reignin', gainin, so put kane in, that category, period, end of story",The Symphony,1988

Lead, kindly Light, amid th?encircling gloom;
Lead thou me on!
The night is dark, and I am far from home;
Lead thou me on!
Keep thou my feet; I do not ask to see
The distant scene?one step enough for me.

I was not ever thus, nor pray?d that thou
Shouldst lead me on.
I loved to choose and see my path; but now,

Lead thou me on!
I loved the garish day, and, spite of fears,
Pride ruled my will. Remember not past years.

So long thy pow?r hath blest me, sure it still
Will lead me on
O?er moor and fen, o?er crag and torrent, till
The night is gone.
And with the morn those angel faces smile,
Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile!","Lead, Kindly Light",2001
Craig Jessop,"Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored,
He has loosed the fateful lightening of His terrible swift sword
His truth is marching on.

[Chorus]
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
His truth is marching on.

I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps
They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps
l can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps
His day is marching on.

[Chorus]

I have read a fiery gospel writ in burnish`d rows of steel,
""As ye deal with my contemners, So with you my grace shall deal;""
Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel
Since God is marching on.

[Chorus]

He has sounded form the trumpet that shall never call retreat
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment-seat
Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him! be jubilant, my feet!
Our God is marching on.

[Chorus]

He has sounded form the trumpet that shall never call retreat
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment-seat
Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him! be jubilant, my feet!

With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me:
As He died to make men holy, let us live to make men free,
While God is marching on.",Battle Hymn of the Republic,2001

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2000

If our love was the deal
You told me, we got it goin' on

No comp for combat with bwoy like Supercat
Show you where my head's at I crack you with a bat
Where the funk? Hear the trunk a bit and fat knit
Rearrange the skit make it fit so you can't sit
Now ain't that some shh I rip it
I snap a jaw, I stabba jab a dinosaur

Trust my flavor G, I make ya want to pee-pee
I got what you can't see, somethin' like a leprosy
I slow it down, somethin' like this
When it's time for me to stun 'em
Mc's I warned them
I'll put 'em on the moon without funk to listen to
Then again, my vibration
May give the sensation they're on vacation
Y'all brothers need a jig changer
Real rugged alligator MC hater from the fader
You little tic-tac, tryin' to act like a lumberjack
Sit back and watch how the earth crack
You funk around, you lay around, that's how it goes
And I suppose MC's still want to try me
King of the mountain is a hard rock
Do you understand, smile and I'll take you out like the mob
Check it black, after the Mack there's no recoup
Not even soup, get out shake the hula hoop
Comin' out the ground
Gettin' down

Who has a date and thank you for waitin'
There my bad, I thought you took a beatin' in the brain
Then you learned from rap that rap's a mistake
You won't get a break
Big as a cake for me to make, and you bake
So, bonsai here comes the flyest guy
That you ever heard in your lifetime (yup yup yup)
I do a behind
And rewind, I want to kick some more shit
Down your faucet, I pours it
Mighta lost it, but then I retrieve it

Rain like bad weather, reign like whoever never
You can't bite my style
'Cause my style ain't a style that is a style
So I can go buckwild

Now I'm about a second from the hook, duk
Scrap ya rap book, 'fore you get ya wet style shook

Burning MCs leaves a foul scent
See, I'm like what ya call, king a yes ya'll
My style's rick, sick, I mean real sick
Shit's thick, I come with the ammo
The real whammo slammo stuff that I be droppin'
And I'll wake the great, let's warm up the hot plate
I'm changing fate from the neck I'ma castrate
My rap loves to alienate
Shake ya ass to 'til it stank, you stomp, I dominate
See, I ain't scared of you muthafuckas
To me ya all suckers 'cause I make the ruckus
Don't try to buck us, we roll bulletproof
No cooth, on the roof, bitin' like a sabertooth
I pound on the ground when I get down
So let me get down, let me get down

Can I get down, get on down

Can leap a tall building, crush the Earth for fun
But I'm sayin' ain't no fair, yo, when MC's run
The mic's now in the right hands
'Cause the Mack's on the Earth just to spoil your plans
More pep than the pepper that's in ya pepper shaker
Ruff earthquaker, couldn't take me if ya mama make ya
I back up the funk that I bring with unknown to man slang
With bigger bite than the Devil fang
I ain't met who could hang
If ya testin' in ya lesson
Got me dressin' for ya funeral session
Man, it won't even matter no more
Craig in '94 just won the war

Rhymes that's bumpin now at your backdoor
Never figured Mack got funk for days (what)
When ""Project: Funk Da World"" brought the brand new craze

When the genuine take out deep max on your mind
I'ma hit you with the boom pow
Bolder than Moscow, MC's your judgment's now

MC's, your judgment is, now (now MC's)
MC's your judgment day is now (it's time, here it comes)
MC's, your judgment is, (hah) now

Here it comes, boy

Here comes the one they call King MC
If you're tired of those phony fake rhymes that be (fake)
I'm back with this deeper than Minds of Minolta
Preachin' better than preacher up on an altar
(Amen boy)
I feel that I have pardoned, pardoned
No need for bad grammar startin in my MC garden

And I'ma kinda hungry tonight
So I pulls out the ground a fat rhyme to recite
I don't means to boast but the most is me your host
On post, kickin flav til they ghost (ghost)
Craig Mack is here to stay
Rugged as a mountain bike on MC judgment day

From now until the Earth's gone
In the chess game of rap, MC's ain't nothin' but a pawn

As the rap romps through your town (through your town)

MC's (MC's) your judgment is, (hah) now (Mack the dope)
MC's your judgment day is now (with the flav, gettin down)

It was a rumble tumble, I put the bee inside the bumble
Kickin' wicked type of hyper, won't never fumble (ah)
I float like a tugboat do
Watch the virus, Mack the dope, start affectin' you
Is rap real? You can't deal, what's the matter?
The badder the Don Dadda is still gettin' fatter
You be lovin' how it sound and shit
And have you dance when I battle for the sponsorin'
And you can thank Bad Boy for that
A technique for layin MC's on the mat
Scat, scoot, pussy couldn't make a louder hoop
When I pollute, the world with funk to the roof
Mad rhymes we bust, in God we trust
And MC's don't discuss when ya turn back to dust

Mark the year, 1994, when MC's hit the floor

MC's, your judgment is, (hah) now
MC's your judgment is now (Final Call, MC's, we get down)

Funk weight that's greater than George Poppadopalous
Now even fools are better
Rap's new trendsetter, at makin' MC's wetter
So plug in the mainline 'til ninety-nine
For funk the genuine now vote for mine (vote for Mack)

From the way they take a picture MC further than a flyin' saucer

Let me tell you something real
Is how the Mack feel
I ain't no criminal and represent no steel
I tell you one thing though
MC's better walk slow the Mack's on the earth to let you know
I'm on a mission from the kingdom of God
To do away with MC's dat represent nimrod
You MC's have been too bad
So where you go now ice ya gonna wish you had
When MC's disappear it's my fault
It's time to put all the madness to a flying halt
And radio needs to be ashamed
For pumping murder, murder, murder all up in our brain
I'll tell ya now Big Poppa don't like it
Representing truth when the Mack starts to mike it
I hope the subject don't turn ya away

You can front now, but when God comes
You can't get straped for when God comes

When your ass on the camera you ain't nothing but a whore
Ladies you need to help out your man
Instead of frontin' at the club with a drink in your hand
The Black family is now pre-history
And we don't need psychic healing from Dionne Warwick
We all need to be down on our knees beggin' please
Lord help us shake this disease
And MC's don't take these rhymes for a joke
Craig Mack pen is mightier than the sword you stroke
So take heed to the words that I send

I ain't seen a saint that might make me faint
How long can we sing that song
Knowing that the shit ya kicking brother is dead wrong
And don't figure Mack new to get started
'Cause flip out an old fat verse from get retarded
I'm talking from veteran chair prepare
MC's nightmare only there's no need to fear
Shape up ya Lord about to strike
With thunder claps that can turn day into night
With something similar to Gabriel's horn
The first flag up my tribe of Judah's now been warn
Peace to Bad Boy for bringing me here
People of the world presenting Mack this year
No need for fronting his time has almost came
And the last rhyme ya hear bears Craig Mack's name

You can front now, but when God comes
You can't get straped for when God comes

Worth more than the coke that they selling by the pound

Hop to kick a paragraph, floating on the funk like a life raft
Down with Sista, it's the MC brezzle twister
Mackalicious boy I'll pop you like a blister
Craig Mack's a Jedi Knight with The Force of course
I can run MC's through my teeth like dental floss
So back up and don't sweat me down

Hitting wicked like the funkalicious rhymes that's phat, 
And we can get back in forth off the back

When I farts I poops cash from my ass

I'm not greedy, I feeds the needy, I smokes a beady
I feel, the need to stroke the weedy
Oh big daddy, is you ready *slurp*
To slurp me in your mouth like spaghetti?

Grant your wishes everytime
Breaking dishes when I bust a rhyme
I know one thing the whole world least expected
Was how we all connected to break fool on the same record
Five new flavas on beat, feel the fuckin' heat
I really think you should retreat while we blow up the street
Instead of copping pleas just freeze
Maintain the focus while we smoke these marijuana trees

Yo, this for my niggas, though, special delivery
Spit like this, get my wrists all glittery
Get cake, snakes get slithery
Lean in, show why'all the meaning of chivalry
Rap ruler, you could ask Buddha
Right jab like Zab Zuda
Every member on my team is the shooter
Tight like a womb, no room for intruders
Spark Buddha, twistin' the Philly
And Good Humor, don't be silly
It's gravy baby, I got it all smothered
Like makeup, I got it all covered
Want a jewel, don't be cruel
It's authentic, don't be fooled
By these phony accusations
Backlash and slanders
Front, and they put pits in ya
Stunts and propaganda

In chief, I never stop like beef
Gimme a break, I might shake the building place
Say vacate all women and children

Filthy, but milky like cereal
Bang this in ya stereo

Gimme two hands, few grams and the shaker
Hit the block, watch the kids bake up
Your girl keep coming around
Then I'ma take her to Jamaica
And I give her a reason to get curious
But ya pain, it ain't that serious
MC's ran with this and that
But change your name to Saran 'cause it's a Wrap

Past a field of hay that had just been mowed

When a third-grade education,
Was all the school you needed,
To work the family farm.

He'd take time off on Sunday,
Him and all his family,
warm a pew,
And give thanks to the Lord.

There was no gray, only black and white.
Didn't need no-one to tell him,
What was wrong or right.
'Cause he had God, Family, and Country.

He set aside his plow,
In early 1940,
Said goodbye to his small town,
And put on the Army green.

Hard Times on the front lines,
Writin' letters on wet paper,
Not one word about the awful things he'd seen.
His was a generation,

That answered without question.
They knew they had to win,
'Cause they were fightin' for...
God, Family, and Country.

Sits the family Bible,
Where just last year he added,
A little boy to the family tree.

Craig Morgan,"As he climbed in the chute, the crowd held it's breath
He was seconds from glory or moments from death
They knew with this bull, it could go either way
He said, ""Let her go boys, and pray?

He hung on for eight but he couldn't get loose
That's when a clown they call Crazy came to his rescue
When the dust finally settled, they both walked away
Yeah, they became best of friends that day

The cowboy and clown, close as two brothers
Chips up or down, they could count on each other
Buckles and beers, winning and losing
Laughter and tears, broken hearts and bruises
They lived for the next final round, the cowboy and clown

From Denver to Dallas, to the Calgary stampede
They took all those towns, and a few in between
But it ended one night, in a West Texas town
The bulls either got faster, or old Crazy slowed down

Five hundred pick-ups, lights on, driving slow
A tent on the hill at the end of the road
When the last bible closed, one cowboy stayed
He said, ""Let her go boys, and pray?

The cowboy and clown, close as two brothers
Chips up or down, they could count on each other

No pot of gold at the end of my rainbow

The midnight sky has a blanket of stars and the moon
And baby I got you

Life alone just wouldn't be worth living
Love would be a wish that never came true

But he's still goin'
There's a melancholy in his eyes, for all of you who care enough to wonder why
Let me tell you
It all started back in 1957 when ole Walt Disney took him by surprise
Thats the day Old Yeller died
Well that twelve year old became a man eleven years to soon in Vietnam
With his best friend Tommy
They were tough as nails and southern born and awfully proud to wear that uniform
Then things got scary
On April 4th, Tommy left for heaven the same year the world was taken by surprise
That's the day Martin Luther died
So before you judge him you need to know there's more to that old man
Then what you see there on that barstool with the bourbon on his hand
You heard about his younger years but don't leave now theres more to hear
That might explain the pain in that old man
How quick America forgot about the only war they'd lost and life goes on
That's what they tell ya
No ticker tape no reason why, might have never seen the end of that chapter in his life
If he hadn't met Betty
They married in December 1980, no doubt it was the best day of his life
Two days before John Lennon died
So before you judge him you need to know there's more to that old man
Than what you see there on the barstool with the bourbon in his hand
Now we've covered chapter two I can almost see a change in you
There's still a lot of life in that old man
He hadn't had a drink in at least a year, to tell the truth I'm shocked he's here
But as long as he wants'em I'm gonna pour'em
Before you came in I asked him why, he raised his fragile head and wiped his eyes
Then he told me
I've seen so much in my life I've never questioned, this time the good Lord took me by surprise

So I could see her bend over in her tight blue jeans
I was eye to eye with Taz and a Tweety tattoo
Forced to play a little game of peek-a-boo
Then she led me down the aisle by the pipe and glue
Asked me if I had any plumbing to do
Hands planted firm on the curve of her hip
Looked to me like she was lookin' for a little lip to lip

She even did that little finger thingy through her hair
Practically undressed me with her Playboy stare
I gave her back that look that she was lookin' for
I think that she forgot that we was in that store

And fumbling for the dome light

Since they pulled over, her hearts been beatin' faster
Without that song, who knows, he might have never asked her

It's been almost two years and guess what made him stop

Bacon's on, coffee's strong

Hits the Y for aerobics class
Drops by the bank, stops at the store
Has on a smile when I walk through the door
The last to go to bed; she'll be the first one up
And I thought I was tough

She's strong, pushes on; can't slow her down
She can take anything life dishes out
There was a time
Back before she was mine
When I thought I was tough

We sat there five years ago
The doctors let us know; the test showed
She'd have to fight to live; I broke down and cried
She held me and said it's gonna be alright
She wore that wig to church
Pink ribbon pinned there on her shirt
No room for fear, full of faith
Hands held high singing Amazing Grace
Never once complained, refusing to give up
And I thought I was tough

She's strong, pushes on; can't slow her down
She can take anything life dishes out

Got memories in our head in every room

When it walked out your front door
Where you fell down to your knees
And can't forget the kind of suitcase
That was packed out on the sidewalk
While you cried there beggin' please

You can lie and tell yourself
You're over it and someone else will take love's place
And this is for the best
You can lie in that bed
In a stranger's arms reachin' for comfort
Close your eyes and still get no rest

Cause love remembers
The smell of a summer day
Lying in a hammock over fresh cut grass
And the promise of forever
Yeah love remembers
The sound of the pouring rain
Beatin' down on the top of a car
On the side of the road
Where it couldn't wait
Yeah love remembers

You might convince yourself
There's shelter in a bottle
For a while there it might numb the pain
But when it hits you, then it hits you
That love's still gone and you'll be wishin'
That you'd poured it down the drain
'Cause love remembers

The taste of cotton candy lip gloss
On the lips of a long kiss
And the plans they made together
Yeah love remembers
To feel the fingertips
Running through soakin' wet hair
On the bank after a midnight swim
Yeah love remembers

Yeah love remembers

I wanna run with the bulls through the streets of Spain
Dance with my baby in the thunder and rain
Do everything I can with the days I’m given

That pushes me a little past extreme

I ain’t gonna get to my rockin’ chair
Scratchin’ a head full of silver hair
And look back on a bunch of things I wished I did

With the one arm man name Phil

And do a bull at the Holiday Inn
'Cause it was Panama City, you were drunk and she was pretty
The paramedics gave you a prefect ten

And when we're old and rocking on the porch
Re-living all our glory
You might have a few less scars
But I'll have better stories

If you never been bitten by a snake in a church
While you sang ""Amazing Grace""
If you never had to bribe a border guard
To overlook that one suitcase

If you never hustle pool in a biker bar

Just to watch them all fall like dominoes

If you never been banned from a Taco Bell
If you didn't fry your nest's egg

You might have both brain cells left

Hitched up my old john boat
To see if it would still float

So she took off her shirt
Said I’ll get a little sun

I rubbed it in real good, and I didn’t miss a spot

But if we get a nibble
I want to be the one to reel him in
I said “baby you got it”

Won’t you lay right here beside me, she didn’t have to ask me twice

I kissed her lips
As the sun went down
We lost track of time
As we floated around

All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""

Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

It's like trying to find a shadow in the dark.

Too tired to sleep
I'm incomplete
Like a day without sunshine

This faded soul will stand alone
Waiting on sunshine.

And everything is blue for him and himself

Still the rain keeps pouring down
I can't break through uh-oh

Your first lesson given to you by (Mr. Smith!)
KC MO stand up, young niggas represent

Ey, ask me what I wanna be when I grow up, I ain't just gonna blow up
I'm a star I got astronomers tryin' to get a close up
Telescopes and cameras, rappers wanna use glamors
But I'm gleamin' from the planets, homie, mine is called Kansas City
The cloud in my pocket's gotta rain on 'em
Such a star I saw Heaven's walls and wrote my name on 'em
So comfortable at the top I hopped on a plane and claimed Everest
You might as well say the boy is Himalayan
I rent my rooms on the moon, Mr. Smith is comin' soon
The angels feedin' me cereal with a silver spoon
My hair line is Craig Smith Airlines
A ride from Kansas City to LA is as long as a fan line
I'm high as '08 gas prices, my votes are
Twice as high as Obama's and I ain't gotta ask nice
I'm high as Tech's tour bus, the light skinned one
So if you're lookin' for me dog look up and try to find the sun

[Chorus: x2]
I'm in the air
High in the air

KC, Nesto!

Yeah, don't mean to brag but I froze my piece
And I'm gettin' higher then a nose bleed seat
Don't bring her to my session, if your ho sees me
She'll drop dead in the studio like ODB
Yeah, it's the owner and I'm very cool
Plus this weed keep me higher than an air balloon
Copy cat, like what I'm wearing dude?
I'm so fly, I walk around with a parachute
And even rappers lie too
But I'm the only human with an astronaut suit
See yo entire verse? Say that your iron squirt
When you only shootin' in the air like fireworks (Pussy)
If suckers still on that hatin' shit
I'll stuff 'em in a bag like potato chips
I'll bend they ass up like a paper clip
Tech, sign me and see how quick your paper flip

[Chorus: x2]

I ain't gotta introduce myself, y'all know what it is

Why call me underground when I rock the stars?
And even they can't see me with a pair of binoculars
My hip-hoppin' gave a good side swipe to Mars
One-Third an extinction hit, which left the limelight Ajar
You want your scripts to fly, not in my solar system
Cause I'll dismiss 'em like they wished to die
Mack mother-nature and I ripped her, why?
Civilian ladies love me, so bro, excuse her while she kiss the sky
Call me master more exalted than a priest, a pastor
Blasphemy have me blast fags fast with Magma
In the air like Dancer and Dasher
High in the sky, above all mountains off in Alaska
Higher than a million heroin hits if it'll last ya
Super-Celestial when everyone's stuck off in the pasture
The wack, I will cast ya down, below those who get caught up in my Rapture
Don't be callin' me ""dog"" cause I want you to say it backwards

Craig: Hahahaha, check it out, uh

Its a hard knock jaw drop life for me
Last year I was in front of mic's for free
Now I'm winning its nice to see
Because if you ever tried to make it out of here, you would know its all bull
And I'mma show them how to steer with it
Had a clear vision head light deer sittin'
Thought it would be easy because Craig's got a clear image
Gotta shift out of gear LeBron James
They know that I'm a king but I remain in the cavalier
I was a rolling stone and now I'm sky-scrapping
I'm hella dope they high from songs im making
Like a Jamaican and I can BUCK BUCK
What was y'all thinking I'm hot for no reason
Summer summer time James lemonade
I'm in season and springing into the rain
You don't wanna get wet in it
I stepped in it
And got respect
And now I ask Tech what's next

I got my duffel bag, my swag and my A.M.X
I got my girlie all done up for some S.E.X
I got my heat under the seat in case them fools they flex

Ay yo whats next up on the menu
What show? A different venue
When you thought that it was over no sir its to be continued
Too many people know you
Too many bitches on you
So you ditching on the exact same thing you want to go to
From the outside looking in
They don't be understanding
Because from every fan that loves you thats an inch away from family
My name is Obergeek but you refer to me as Grammy
It's just pre-mental planning maybe you will understand me
Started as a local, haha
Now I'm on the vocals lala
The time it took to do this shit was kinda loco
I know
Put me on the beat then I flow
I'm fuckin' with green because I go
Seems like I speed through obstacles like my life's on nitro
I see the light posts I'm speeding through the night glow
My miles per hour says I should be insured for Geico
I took a stop at Ollie Gate
As as soon as I stepped up in the place
He asked me what is on my plate
I said I got

[Chorus]

I'm tryin' to make it so the whole world can hear that
Real raw and severe rap
Television showing how humongous my career's at
Me popping bottles when the enemies watching poppin' beer caps
They feel severe slaps from here clear to Iraq
I'll near trap but this here's cracked
And I get them chicks with their boobies lifted and rears fat
What me and Travis doing every year after year stacked
Then we off in the Bahamas where the peers at cheers cat
And we don't fear packs cause we standing near straps
Come to me with that queer crap you'll get your vaneers cracked
Yeah I might be a weird brat
But I get them tears from your dear 
That'll have her speared in the lair when her brazier snaps
Watch who you sneer at
Because if we see a rat he's smeared flat
He's about to feel snakes and hear bats
So whats next is a mere splat
On her face because the P was shear wack, haha

We were like children posing
Playing at games, acting out names
Guessing the parts we played

Oh what a hit we made
We came on next to closing

Love left the masquerade

Fate seemed to pull the strings
I turned and you were gone
While from the darkened wings
The music box played on

She didn't grow up, she grew out
Mama thinks she's pretty and she's bein' kind
Papa thinks she's lovely and he's half blind
Don't let her out much except at night
I don't care 'cause I'm all right

Oh, the sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home
And the young folks lay on the floor
Oh, the sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home
Keep them bad times away from my door

Brother Gene, he's big and mean
He don't have much to say
He had a little woman that he'd whoop each day
But now she's gone away
Got drunk last night kickin' mama down the stairs
And I'm all right and I don't care

One and all
At the ugly bug ball

While the crickets clicked their tricky melodies
All the ants were fancy-dancing with the fleas
Then up from under the ground
The worms came squirming around

Oh they danced until there legs were nearly lame
Every little crawling creature you could name
Everyone was glad
What a time they had
They were so happy they came

Everyone was glad! What a time they had!
They were so happy they came!

Come on let's crawl
Gotta crawl, gotta crawl
To the ugly bug ball
To the ball, to the ball
And a happy time we'll have there
One and all!
At the ugly bug ball.

Then our caterpillar saw a pretty queen
She was beautiful in yellow, black and green
He said, ""Would you care to dance?""
Their dancing led to romance.

And she sat upon his caterpillar knees
And he gave his caterpillar queen a squeeze
Soon they'll honeymoon
Build a big cocoon
Thanks to the ugly bug ball

Come on let's crawl
Gotta crawl, gotta crawl,
To the ugly bug ball
To the ball, to the ball
And a happy time we'll have there
One and all!

As she took the stage
But she was convinced if she got up there
That she'd be discovered some day
So she belted it
She hit the high notes fearlessly
Oh, she melted them
She brought them to their feet

She was a big star
At Banana Joe's Bar
Where she sang karaoke every night
She said if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight
She was a big star

She made the local cable shows
Where the camera fell in love with her face
After a couple of weekends
The groupies were crawling all over the place
And she signed autographs
Like she was Garth Brooks in a skirt
And in the aftermath
That small time town was hers

She was a big star
At Banana Joe's Bar
Where she sang karaoke every night
She said if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight
She was a big star

Hey, she doesn't care anymore
That her high school girlfriends cut her down
The only thought she entertains is where they aren't
And where she is now

A few old neighbors swear they are certain
She slept her way to the top
She knows you don't get where you're goin'
Unless you got something they ain't got
So she sings tonight
To twenty thousand plus
And the young girls scream out loud
Man that could be us

Just before she performs every night

Why do I always feel so unimportant?
To other egos my mind clings and inside these voices ring
That I'm just a carbon copy of everyone else

And now I'm searching out my own identity
Something down inside telling me that I'm like no one else but me
But as of yet I still don't know
Who is this guy that I am and for his life what does he have to show?
Who am I?
What am I for?

I wait for answers from the sky, the only audience I find
But no comfort finds my ears just silent mocking
And I know I was created but I just can't figure out why

I want to see something in me that is unique.

But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Cranberry Singers,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

I know I'm right, or close anyways

That I was made for her, and she me too
And I'm confident that she'll think so too
And she'll be coming back, soon

Mornings we have toast and tea
I gaze across the table, she glares right back at me
And when we're getting low on jam
I give her the last spoonful, that's just the way I am
And I drive her to work each day
Even though it's early and work is far away
And I don't even say a thing
When she plays the radio so loud you cannot think

[Chorus]

I can't stand her goddamned friends
But I will tolerate them, even though I hate them
And I will put up with her parents
Cause she says I'll not meet someone who is so kind and sweet
Ever again

Two up top, two beneath

We've been fighting like cat and dog now here's what we've go to do
This life in the city is killing the love that we one knew
We could be happy in the country

We would spend so many lovely days
We'd have chickens and cows and corn and whatever it is farmers raise
At breakfast each morning we'd fry up our own hand-picked eggs
We could be happy in the country

So let's pack our bags up together
And we'll be in the clear forever

We'll just sit right back and watch while our crops grow
While we listen to gals like Kitty Wells on country radio
Weekends we's two-step at some cowboy bar just down the road
We could be happy in the country

I know that the local folks will make us feel right at home
We'll have homemade whiskey and ramble down country roads

That we'd once been city folks that owned sporty cars and fancy homes

I know you would not mind
You'd send away the ghosts that haunt me now
And the things I fear
Just wouldn't seem so near
And when I stroll out late at night
There would be nothing rattling at my hells

There are nights when all my aching bones won't let me sleep
And demons come to plague me as I lie in bed
But I know if you were sleeping there beside me then
That you could fend them off and they would let me rest

There are nights
When the wind comes howling through my old place
I have dreams
And I wake up with the sweat pouring down my face
And I wait till the morning comes

There will come a time I fear when all my days are done
And they will come collect my corpse and bury me

Gonna eat it too, make no mistake
'Cause if it's a question of to be or not to be
I'll put on my boots and go see what I can see

My grandpa, well a good Christian life he led
Worked like a dog just to put a roof over his head
He said that when he died he'd get his reward

Bring me flesh and bring me wine 
Bring me pine logs hither
Thou and I will see him dine 
When we bear them thither
Page and monarch, forth they went
Forth they went together 
Through the rude wind's wild lament 
And the bitter weather

Sire, the night is darker now
And the wind blows stronger
Fails my heart, I know not how
I can go no longer
Mark my footsteps my good page
Tread thou in them boldly
Thou shalt find the winter's rage 
Freeze thy blood less coldly

In his master's steps he trod
Where the snow lay dented
Heat was in the very sod 
Which the saint had printed

Wealth or rank possessing
Ye who now will bless the poor 
Shall yourselves find blessing",Good King Wenceslas,2002
Crash Test Dummies,"'Twas in the moon of wintertime
When all the birds had fled
That mighty Gitchi Manitou
Sent angel choirs instead
Before their light the stars grew dim
And wandering hunters heard the hymn

Jesus your King is born, Jesus is born
In excelsis gloria

Within a lodge of broken bark
The tender Babe was found
A ragged robe of rabbit skin
Enwrapp'd His beauty round
And as the hunter braves drew nigh
The angel song rang loud and high

Jesus your King is born, Jesus is born
In excelsis gloria

The earliest moon of wintertime
Is not so round and fair
As was the ring of glory
On the helpless infant there
The chiefs from far before him knelt
With gifts of fur and beaver pelt

Of an answer to the what, where or how.
We're talking 'bout freedom while we're locked in a cell,
Dreaming of a world without war,
Forced to live on the boundaries of hell
Like no-one's ever thought of peace before.

What's the point of talking love if you think that love ain't real?
Where's the hope in hopelessness? Where's the truth in lies?

Frail little flames in the gale,
Lost little people who just can't cope,
Just knocking their heads on the nail.

What's the point of preaching sharing as you accumulate your wealth?

Building little castles in the sand.

How does it feel to be the mother of a thousand death?
Sunken eyes, lost now; empty sockets in futile death.

Your arrogance has gutted these bodies of life,
Your deceit fooled them that it was worth the sacrifice.
Your lies persuaded people to accept the wasted blood,
Your filthy pride cleansed you of the doubt you should have had.
You smile in the face of the death cause you are so proud and vain,
Your inhumanity stops you from realising the pain
That you inflicted, you determines, you created, you ordered -
It was your decision to have those young boys slaughtered.

You never wanted peace or solution,
From the start you lusted after war and destruction.
Your blood-soaked reason ruled out other choices,
Your mockery gagged more moderate voices.
So keen to play your bloody part, so impatient that your war be fought.

To be twisted and torn in filthy war.

You accuse us of disrespect for the dead,
But it was you who slaughtered out of national pride.
Just how much did you care? What respect did you have
As you sent those bodies to their communal grave?
You buried them rough-handed, they'd given you their all,
That once living flesh defiled in the hell
That you inflicted, you determines, you created, you ordered -
It was your decision to have those young boys slaughtered.

You use those deaths to achieve your ends still,
Using the corpses as a moral blackmail.
You say ""Think of what those young men gave""
As you try to bind us in your living death,
Yet we do think of them, ice cold and silence
In the snow covered moorlands, stopped by the violence

This is no natural aggression composing death, I am afraid for beauty when I see the fist,
The perfect hand that turns against itself, the perfect hand that holds a gun or wields a butcher's blade, or leads to death,
Leads to death the used-up bull or incarcerates the hopeless fool or takes the forest with a single flame
Leaves the nest an empty shell. Human kind condemns the hunting beast yet their own choice leaves behind such ragged meat.
The military dream of blood, their sweet wine flowing in the veins of men who work towards our bloody end.

The fantasy that you're the toy providing endless fun,
You're not a human being, you're their daughter or their son.
You bring them lots of happiness when you're very small,
But when you lose those darling looks no-one cares to call,
'cause you're no more the cuddly toy for them to hug and hold,
You're not an individual and they're just getting old.

But somehow fate hadn't meant her for me 
And though I sailed with the tide in the morning 
Still my heart's on the Isle of Capri

Blue Italian sky above 
I said ""Lady, I'm a rover, 
Can you spare a sweet word of love?""

And then as I kissed her hand I could see 
She wore a lovely meatball on her finger

I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My god I thought you were someone to rely on
Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart
Now I've found a real love
You'll never fool me again

I was petrified
Kept thinking I could never live
Without you by my side

Thinking how you did me wrong
I grew strong
I learned how to carry on
And so you're back
From outer space
I just walked in to find you here

I should have made you leave your key

Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle

And a hi hat with a souped up tempo

Rock man lovers driving Lamborghini
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps are acting ill because they're so full of eight balls
Gunshots ranged out like a bell
I grabbed my nine
All I heard were shells
Fallin' on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm tryin' to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene

Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town, that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed
This is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step with this

Cut like a razor blade so fast

And you'll always wonder why... because you never tried

Oh, you better know your maker

So you might even notice, there's not a single one
Who agrees the things you've seen in visions can be done
So you gotta realize
That the truth that makes you wise, also makes you Faith rise!

There will always be somebody who got something to say

And it don't matter 'bout your status or mistakes you made in your past
If God is for you He got your back like a coat tag
Trust me, you can note that, in Him there is no lack
You can drick from His fount in Zion's Mountain With no cash
Man, ya life is on smash, but you're in ya room
With a box of tissues, wiping sniffles, wishing for Ya tomb
But the sky is the limit God knew you in the womb

To live with one who wasn't there
Like an ocean fish who swam upstream
Through nets, by hooks, and hungry bears.

I know I can't go back again.

And my belly's scraping on the rocks

And I'll keep swimming till I stop.

I'll never lose it, never lose the will to love,
Never lose the will.

I'm like a singer on the stage
With the golden lights and liquid rage
Down from the mountains to the sea
Cool running love keeps cleansing me.

It keeps my gills from getting dry
But it distorts things in my eyes
Sometimes I see what really isn't there
Like my true lover, and I care.

Got the will to love, the will to love.
I'll never lose it, never lose the will to love,
Never lose the will.
It's like something from up above.

Sometimes I ramble on and on
And I repeat myself till all my friends are gone
And get lost in snow and drown in rain
And never feel the same again.

Just one of millions all the same
But somewhere someone calls my name
I'm a harpoon dodger, and I can't, won't be tamed.

They were planting in the full moon
They had given all they had for something new
But the light of day was on them,
They could see the thrashers coming
And the water shone like diamonds in the dew.

And I was just getting up, hit the road before it's light
Trying to catch an hour on the sun
When I saw those thrashers rolling by,
Looking more than two lanes wide
I was feelin' like my day had just begun.

Where the eagle glides ascending
There's an ancient river bending
Down the timeless gorge of changes
Where sleeplessness awaits
I searched out my companions,
Who were lost in crystal canyons
When the aimless blade of science
Slashed the pearly gates.

It was then I knew I'd had enough,
Burned my credit card for fuel
Headed out to where the pavement turns to sand
With a one-way ticket to the land of truth
And my suitcase in my hand
How I lost my friends I still don't understand.

They had the best selection,
They were poisoned with protection
There was nothing that they needed,
Nothing left to find
They were lost in rock formations
Or became park bench mutations
On the sidewalks and in the stations
They were waiting, waiting.

So I got bored and left them there,
They were just dead weight to me
Better down the road without that load
Brings back the time when I was eight or nine
I was watchin' my mama's T.V.,
It was that great Grand Canyon rescue episode.

Where the vulture glides descending
On an asphalt highway bending
Through libraries and museums, galaxies and stars
Down the windy halls of friendship
To the rose clipped by the bullwhip
The motel of lost companions
Waits with heated pool and bar.

But me I'm not stopping there,
Got my own row left to hoe
Just another line in the field of time

To give what's mine.",Thrasher,1979

I rock the block with glocks
And brass knuckles.
A pocket full of weed
And a B-Boy belt buckle.

Running amok as we
Fuck up the stage.

Around the universe.

High class, white trash,
Rolling a classic hovercraft.
In strange days,
The wickedest ways
Become the norm.
But it's far from the norm
When we perform.
Check it.
B-boys make some noise.
Get connected.
Respect it.
You should expect the unexpected.
B-girls reping at the front
Of the show.
I'm a bad ass b-boy two
Triple O.

[Chorus]

Dope thoughts come
When I hear a kick drum
A bass beat transforms
The level of the street
And the lyrics
Boulevard status.
Yo, I'm the baddest
Beach front punks,
They insist I'm the raddest
Thing to ever hit since L.S.D.
Hallucinate while I dominate.
I bring Satan to the table.
When I rock, there is not
A label for it.
Critics adore it.
Homicidal as it gets.
Your wrist slit
When I make suicidal imprints
On your brain.
I induce pain, so I'm insane.
Hell bent burnt you like acid rain.
Extraordinarily, I lyricize,
Specialize.
In body rocking, rapping,
And macking.
Two triple O, I came to get down.
With my clique Crazy Town.
We came to get down.
Yes, yes y'all
We came to get down.

[Chorus]

Put your mind over matter
Gather 'round the sound
Yeah, gather 'round the sound.
It don't get better, gather
'Round the sound
Come on, gather 'round the sound.
Put your mind over matter
Gather 'round the sound
Yeah, gather 'round the sound
It don't get better, gather
'Round the sound
Come on, gather 'round the sound.

Crazy Town,"Now people say I'm jinxed
I got some kind of voodoo hex
Life is so complex
There's no telling what could happen next
Life on the edge,
Fuels the sickness in my head
It embeds the type of thoughts
That got a lot of brothers dead
The smarter brother knows
To keep his foes close
And I'm the type of brothers
That smarter than most
A cold hearted overdose
Of lyrical antidotes
The cure to make sure
My karma can't take me down
Up to the same old tricks
I wonder if I'll stick around

Is a penny really lucky
If you find it on the ground?
I can't figure it out
My karma crashing down
In the form of a black cloud

[Chorus: x2]
I've got a little black cloud,
That follows me
Everywhere I go
It takes over me

I'm sick
I've got an ill disposition
My intentions are pure
But there's a cure for my condition
My decisions
Put me in the wrong positions
Chasing pipe dreams
Of fame and recognition
The Epic
Not only a name
A definition
My game remains no matter the pain
I stay a charmer
The Don of Karma
I navigate like the Dalli Lama
I ain't a saint
But I've got joi de vie
And I'm the one to blame
If the cloud rains on me
I can't complain about it
Or even let regret
Provoke the energy it takes
For me to get upset

A bad boy since birth
So I can't forget
what goes around
Comes around
And it ain't got me yet
I've gotten wise in my age
And tame the treat of my rage
I've got allot to learn
And I've got money to spend
To pretend is reaping more
Than sewing ever could mend

[Chorus]

Trade my torches for a dime
Black cloud's lifted for the light
The pressure's fading away now
A thousands cigarettes
Won't change the way we feel
The pressure's fading now
Can you bare the though of knowing truth?
Knowing truth?

I was rapping in the rain
Hoping that my luck would change
And if there's any truth
To all those all sayings
'Cause if I kill a spider
Would my house catch on fire?
If I walk under a ladder
Would it matter?
I tend to laugh
When a black cats cross my path
Break mirrors in half
Just to test the aftermath
Now here comes the rain
I protect my pain
Trying to make sense
Of these crazy things
I'm a diamond in the rough
Could I suffer enough?
I'm getting high for a living
Not giving a fuck
These hard times got me stuck
Stuck in a jam
Disastrous
Took time to master this
And the past
Is just a map to capture this
In the darkness
I'm force to adapt to this
I would change the past
If I could have one wish

Fierce nipple pierce you got me sprung with your tongue ring
And I ain't gonna lie 'cause your loving gets me high
So to keep you by my side there's nothing that I won't try
Butterflies in her eyes and looks to kill
Time is passing I'm asking could this be real
'Cause I can't sleep I can't hold still
The only thing I really know is she got sex appeal
I can feel too much is never enough
You're always there to lift me up
When these times get rough I was lost, now I'm found
Ever since you've been around
You're the women that I want
So yo, I'm putting it down

I don't deserve you unless it's some kind of hidden message
To show me life is precious
Then I guess it's true
But to tell truth, I really never knew
Til I met you. See I was lost and confused
Twisted and used up
Knew a better life existed but thought that I missed it

My lifestyle's wild I was living like a wild child
Trapped on a short leash paroled the police files
So yo, what's happening now?
I see the sun breaking down into dark clouds
And a vision of you standing out in a crowd

Come come my lady
You're my butterfly

Come my lady you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Hey sugar momma, come and dance with me
The smartest thing you ever did was take a chance with me
Whatever tickles your fancy
Girl it's you like Sid and Nancy
So sexy, almost evil talkin' about butterflies in my head
I used to think happy endings were only in the books I read but
You made me feel alive when I was almost dead

You filled that empty space with the love I used to chase
And as far as I can see it don't get better than this
So butterfly, here is a song and it's sealed with a kiss
And a thank you miss

Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
So come and dance with me

Come come my lady

With a door that spins.
Goes in and out,
Out and in,

Would love to be living.
Since a kid, I've been surrounded
By beautiful women.
And slippin' in them

Still something's missing,
'Cause deep inside I'm suffering
Of a lonely heart condition.
Wishing I could find a girl
That would take me away
From the chaos of the city
And the everyday part that I play.
Tell me why lay low,
Why say no
When I got girls serenading at
My window.
Ladies good to go

Unless you're coming back for more,
Well then you know what's up.
You know the routine
Girl, you're not the one.
You're just a one night fling.
Some ass to hold this Casanova over.
Till the right girl pass,
I'll drop this lifestyle fast.
'Cause what I'm really looking for
Is the one will last
And make my present past.
My adolescence surpassed.
By the will to chill,
I'm looking for something real.
In a world of fake hos in high heels
I'll drop hot wax on your nipples,
Causing trouble.
And when you ride me,
Yo, I'll be throwing up that triple double
My sex drive's kicking.
I'm sexually exploring.
So many possibilities,
It seems my life could never get boring.
'Cause I'm not fucking around.
I'll rub you down the right way.
I'll rock your world nightly.
So, can I hit it lightly?
Yo, girl, I like it like that.
Let me hit it from the back.
I'm a natural aphrodisiac.
Better known as a Mac.

Dreamlands of danger
Darkside pleasures 
Bad behavior
Dreamlands of danger
Darkside pleasures 
At their best

Punk rock, shell toes,
Horns and halos.
Wicked white wings and 
And pointed tails.
Devil's eyes and nine inch nails
Nocturnal renegades.
The eternal drug raid.
I go by the name of
Mr. Shifty switchblade.
Getting paid in the shade,
As lyrics ricochet,
Off the walls
From the ceiling to the floor,
Off the door
And down the hall.
I'm evil like Knievel
Kicking white trash.
Psycho cerebral, palsy, ballsy
Bad ass.

From the wrong side of the tracks.

Into evil territory.
I'm surrounded by Voyeurs
And crack smoking lawyers.
No shame. Burnt lips,
Tripping on acid rain.
Legally insane, deranged,
Some people never change.

Nasty na na, ha, ha
Darkside marijuana.
Fueled of the drama.
Drifting on the darkside.
I'm the black eye bomber.
Do what I do on a darkside
Rendezvous.
Raising hell, out the shell.
Of fantasies I never tell.
Dispersin' untamed perversion.
My bad brain's working,
Circle jerking, rocking riddles,
Sex pistol, sexperts
Acting uncivil.

Forced to see all the things that I still don't know

It's never too late to take a fucked up life to a beautiful state 
'Cause I came from the bottom so I treasure the top 
At times it seems the dreams are just a long shot 
When the worlds crashing down, when the drama won't stop

I was down by broken dreams and when I felt the world owed me 
I'd sit and hit the walls until my fists were cut and swollen 
My soul was cold and drowning from the tears iv tried to hold in 
Overwhelmed by my emotions, and haunted by the past 
My head was overheating and my heart was in a cast 
My mind was in the gutter, my ass was in a sling

Crazy Town,"Now can you hear the cling-clang of my ball and chain gang?
The sound of heavy metal that tastes like cellophane
Collapsing every vein like umbrellas in heavy rain
My passion is pain
I do dirt to bury shame
I'm victimized an institution's no solution
A place where you're defenseless and guilt's the prosecution
Where necks are bound into slipknots of shallow souls
Walking narrow roads to be hung from gallows poles
Nobody knows me success has exposed me
To narrow-minded souls with goals to overthrow me
Suppose that I chose to live my life low-key
Would you act like you could teach
When there is nothing you can show me
Don't you understand I'm the head of the class
A straight A student not regretting the past

[CHORUS]
You see I'm okay now but I don't think it will last
Because reality is something I can't seem to grasp
Candy-coated pain is like a ball and chain
Pulling me closer to death, I feel closer to death now
Candy-coated pain is like a ball and chain
We only dig deeper by running away

It's deeper than what it looks like
We never got an equal shot so we took mics
Packed the candy-coated pain in the first pipe
That said my name and the candy-coated pain is the worst type
You got it nice my every day is like your worst night
The world is digging in my wounds screaming out I bet it hurts right?
But it hurts more I got regrets but
I'm glad I took the prize behind the first door
What's the hurt for?
Everybody hungers peace but they thirst war
It's crazy I'm not complaining because I probably would have tried better
And if the people that I trusted weren't lie tellers
So keep your candy-coated pain to make the vibe better
Now all the songs I'm writing sound like suicide letters

[Chorus]

Guilty or innocent whatever pick the verdict
Sometimes a perfect picture's not so perfect
Thought I could reverse the mixture it isn't worth it
Because my life seems to work no matter how bad curse it
I only know a little but I feel so much
The pain brings me down but it reveals the rush
See I got my arms up just to shield the dust
Because I lust for the things I can't seem to touch
Arrest me if I follow you
You congest me I'm so hollow from your gift
You infect me when I cut you
Still the same still insane
I think I love you
(But fuck you)

Stereotypical minds 
Got me falling from my pinnacle the minute I climb 
Now these subliminal thoughts got individuals blind 
I'm trying to look beyond the lies 
Just to see what I'll find 
I'm like a flower in a cave 
Another hour in the maze 
And I'll cower to the power of my criminal ways 
The sun is shining but I'm catching minimal rays 
It's time for me to grow out of this childish phase 
My life is like a battle that I'll probably never win 
'Cause I keep thinking big and risking everything 
Life's a challenge and I wonder if I'll ever find the balance 
Mixed emotions and confusion topped off with many talents

Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever change 
Can I change 
Would I change 
Or am I always gonna be the same 
I blame the world for making me such a freak 
But the world wants to blame it on me 
(my life is twisted) 

My finger's pointing in the mirror 
I'm the one now 
I see my shadow in the sun dial 
Am I really out of change 
Put my freedom in a cage 
Slow down 
Man I got a son now 
There's nothing new they all said it 
And I know it but I had to go through it myself 
I'm hard-headed 
That's the only way I'll learn 
Get caught in the fire there's no escaping the burn 
And it burns 
Change this 
Change that 
Change is full of lies 
I remain the same cat wear a good disguise 
Living life looking through my third blind crooked eye 
So if I change I'd be changing for the worst wouldn't I?

I want to run but if I run I'm only running form myself 
Would it be easier if I were someone else 
I'm like a child playin' with matches that's never been burned 
Relearning all the lessons that I've already learned 
On a highway to a destinatin I've earned 
So many exits, but I've never bothered to turn 
I'm like a piece of shard glass laying on a frame of a window 
That was broken by the bricks of pain 
Sometimes I feel just like the devil's guinea pig 
He's watching me just to see how deep I can dig 
I admit I'm fucked up and got a lot to learn

Am I drowning, am I fading away,
Or am I living up to all your dreams that made me this way
Am I drowning, am I drowning, am I drowning, am I drowning..

Looking at myself trying to get things right

Not a minute left, I feel the darkness lifting!

I was a skull in the ground now I'm a star in the sky 
I went from crawling around to being able to fly 
Saw no future for me until I opened my eyes 
I was a skull in the ground now I'm a star in the sky 

I tried love, heaven, hope and takin' chances 
And all I got were broken dreams and failed romances 
Suffered to a life of skin covered in scratches 
Looking for the light but I could never find the passage 
Tension, stress, pain yeah you best believe it 
Nose bleeding from my false way to relieve it 
Enough confusion to make serenity sick 
All my fake friends became my enemies quick 
Everyday I found another way to make excuses 
Took the ropes I was supposed to climb and made nooses 
Being stupid always giving in to the myth 
That life wasn't even worth living like this 
A grown man trapped inside a young man's skin 
With resentment very very deep within 
On a mission to end up either dead or in jail 
No wonder everybody always said that I would fail 

[Chorus: x2]

I found myself locked in a cell and I was just another number 
The thin ice was cracking and I was sinking under, in with sorrow 
Worried 'bout today dread would happen by tomorrow 
Who knows the answers well nobody knows for certain 
The evil things I did when I chose to close the curtain 
Perhaps I should relapse quit relapse quit 
Force it back and relax with a sack of good shit 
Now I find myself in a candlelit depression 
Using sex like drugs just to handle my aggression 

[Chorus: x2]

i had a little, had a lot, had it all and then I lost it 
Stars are in my eyes and skeletons are in my closet 
Now when I open my eyes and I rise from the dead 
Take control of my soul cause the lies are in my head 
The right way is the left way and the left way is wrong 
So I'm left with the right way and the right way is long 
So for once in my life I truly feel like I belong 
So I'll appreciate today and every day until I'm gone

I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy. 

Such a sexy,sexy pretty little thing
Fierce nipple pierce you got me sprung with your tongue ring 
and I ain't gonna lie cause your loving gets me high
So to keep you by my side there's nothing that I won't try
Butterflies in her eyes and looks to kill
Time is passing 
I'm asking could this be real
Cause I can't sleep I can't hold still
The only thing I really know is she got sex appeal
I can feel too much is never enough
You're always there to lift me up
When these times get rough I was lost Now I'm found 
Ever since you've been around
You're the women that I want 
So yo, I'm putting it down.

I don't deserve you unless 
it's some kind of hidden message to show me life is precious
Then I guess it's true
To tell truth, I really never knew 
Till I met you I was lost and confused
Twisted and used up
Knew a better life existed but thought that I missed it
My lifestyle is wild I was living like a wild child
Trapped on a short leash paroled the police files
And yo. What' s happening now? 
I see the sun breaking shining through dark clouds 
and a vision of you standing out in a crowd.

Hey sugar momma, come and dance with me
The smartest thing you ever did was take a chance with me
So, what ever tickles your fancy
Girl it's you like Sid and Nancy
So sexy, almost evil
Talkin' about butterflies in my head
I used to think happy endings were only in the books I read 
but you made me feel alive when I was almost dead
You filled that empty space with the love 
I used to chase and as far as I can see 
it don't get better than this
So butterfly, here is a song and 
it's sealed with a kiss and a thank you miss.

Now ladies come, ladies go,
Out my revolving door
Some ladies never come back,
Most come back for more.
I've got a house in the hills
With a door that spins.
Goes in and out,
Out and in,
'Round and 'round again.

I live a life these player haters
Would love to be living.
Since a kid, I've been surrounded
By beautiful women.
And slippin' in them
To win them
The unforgiven.
Still something's missing,
'Cause deep inside I'm suffering
Of a lonely heart condition.
Wishing I could find a girl
That would take me away
From the chaos of the city
And the everyday part that I play.
Tell me why lay low,
Why say no
When I got girls serenading at
My window.
Ladies good to go
We's major league
The new breed. No so-so.
Highly advanced and got the game
To get in any girl's pants.
And romance her stone
'Cause I more than hold my own
They call me Shifty Capone
I make them moan
Yes, I'm the one.
Between the sheets,
I amaze and stun.
Ain't no need for me to brag
About the way that I'm hung.
Let's just say I got the skills

I keep my girls in rotation,
Door rotating.
You looking for a good time,
I'm always on vacation.
You could stop by baby,
If you want to try your luck.
But don't waste my time,
Unless you're down to fuck.
Unless you're coming back for more,
Well then you know what's up.
You know the routine
Girl, you're not the one.
You're just a one night fling.
Some ass to hold this Casanova over.
Till the right girl pass,
I'll drop this lifestyle fast.
'Cause what I'm really looking for
Is the one will last
And make my present past.
My adolescence surpassed.
By the will to chill,
I'm looking for something real.
In a world of fake hos in high heels
I'll drop hot wax on your nipples,
Causing trouble.
And when you ride me,
Yo, I'll be throwing up that triple double
My sex drive's kicking.
I'm sexually exploring.
So many possibilities,
It seems my life could never get boring.
'Cause I'm not fucking around.
I'll rub you down the right way.
I'll rock your world nightly.
So, can I hit it lightly?
Yo, girl, I like it like that.
Let me hit it from the back.
I'm a natural aphrodisiac.
Better known as a Mac.

Dreamlands of danger
Darkside pleasures 
Bad behavior
Dreamlands of danger
Darkside pleasures 
At their best

Punk rock, shell toes,
Horns and halos.
Wicked white wings and 
And pointed tails.
Devil's eyes and nine inch nails
Nocturnal renegades.
The eternal drug raid.
I go by the name of

Getting paid in the shade,
As lyrics ricochet,
Off the walls
From the ceiling to the floor,
Off the door
And down the hall.

Kicking white trash.

From the wrong side of the tracks.

Into evil territory.

And crack smoking lawyers.
No shame. Burnt lips,
Tripping on acid rain.
Legally insane, deranged,
Some people never change.

Fueled of the drama.
Drifting on the darkside.

Raising hell, out the shell.
Of fantasies I never tell.
Dispersin' untamed perversion.

Circle jerking, rocking riddles,
Sex pistol, sexperts
Acting uncivil.

I'll be down for you homie, when my brain got peeled,
But when your blood spill, who gone be around?

I thought I had it all figured out
But time's an empty hole and it becomes filled with doubt
Born a man, hopin to become the boy
Lived a life, only to be destroyed
From birth to death, the baby's first steps
Didn't affect the purest state that we have left
Best to start slow though pressure becomes past
The innocence is lost and ignorance grows vast
It all happens so fast when you're facin to the wind
You better count the chips before its time to cash em in
'Cause by then you'll realize that you've lost your drive
While workin a 9 to 5 until you turn 95

While speakin of how you felt you can call yourself retired

I am but a reoccurring cycle of light
Bound to this physical vessel until I reach the afterlife
And I might escape as my soul is undressed
I'll fall through all the answers that I saw this time press
Wait and find a different person staring in the mirror
Left to pull my life together from the pieces of a stranger's dream
A vague haze of past days last breath, sun sets, same story, new day, next scene
It's just bickering energy trading places
More like repeating different names and changing faces
The soul's eternal but the body soon wasted
Walk into the new light as the past is slowly faded
I'm falling from earth, return through rebirth
Carry body, open wings, a freedom far from all the hurt
So when my cycle's complete, I'll return to innocence
With nothing else to guide me but the traces of my inner sense

Let me tell you a tale
Where justice does not prevail

About an ill-fated life
So very full of strife
Where two wrongs do not make a right

So

When I was born
I did surely scorn
My proud parent's name
Then their lives went down the drain
Drove them insane
My birth was a curse
I bit the nurse
Oh, but I love the worst

I deserve to be slowly submersed
Dried out then laid in a hearse

When I was two
I poured super glue
Into my fathers hair
As he sat unaware
In his arm chair
Much to his dismay
Had to cut it all away
Oh, but it felt great

I deserve to be cut and filleted
Then tossed about in disarray
Until the pieces melt away

I am not a bad man
Even though I do bad things
Very bad things
Such horrible things
But it's not quite what it seems
(Not quite what he seems)
Not quite what I seem

Aw, hell
It's exactly what it seems

When I was four
I'd wait by the door
With a knife in my hand
And a most devious plan
It would be quite grand
As the mail fell through the slot
The sharp edge he got
Oh, but I love the thought

I deserve to be tied in a knot
Broken bones and blood clots

When I was six
I used to trick
The next door neighbor's son
In the woods we would run
Time for fun
Hide-and-seek has a cost
He would be forever lost
Oh, but I love to scoff

I deserve to have my head lopped off
Hidden and covered in moss
Until this memory's forgot

I am not a bad man
Even though I do bad things
Very bad things
Such horrible things
But it's not quite what it seems
(Not quite what he seems)
Not quite what I seem

Aw, hell
It's exactly what it seems

When I was eight
I used to hate
The color of my house
So as quiet as a mouse
I burned it down
To the ground
When no one was around
Oh, but I love the sound

I deserve to be quickly put down
Rotting six feet underground

When I was ten
I used to pretend
To drown in the sea
'Til they'd come to rescue me
Then preceed
To laugh in their face
Such a disgrace
Oh, but I love the taste

I deserve to have my brains displaced
All over the fireplace
Until this life has been erased

I am not a bad man
Even though I do bad things
Very bad things
Such horrible things
But it's not quite what it seems
(Not quite what he seems)
Not quite what I seem

Aw, hell
It's exactly what it seems

When I was twelve
I used to delve
Into evil schemes
Just to elicit screams
Boost my self-esteem
Pushed my sister down a well
She just fell
Oh, but I love to dwell

I deserve to roast deep down in hell
Where no one can hear me yell

When I was sixteen
Life was frightening
My brother was quite dull
So with laughter in my skull
Pushed him in a hole
Then buried him alive
He barely survived
Oh, but I love the cries

I deserve to be battered and fried
In an electric chair that's set on high

Now that I'm eighteen
I still hate things
From this padded cell I call my home
No friends, no phone
No life to call my own

Until my blood begins to dry
And I return to the darkness from whence I came

Komm mit mir auf 'ne Capri-Sonne von der Tanke
Und 'ne Runde um den Block (ey)
Mit 'ner Machete durch den Jungel in mei'm Kopf (ey)
Wo sogar der Mond verdunkelt ist vom Smog
Brauche ich nur Kunst und 'ne runde Summe von dem Stoff, aus dem Träume sind (Träume sind)
Bisschen Lila mit was Bläulichem (ja)
Ja, sieben Stellen wären ein Neubeginn (ey)
Hier ist Sin City, Matrix, Industriegebiet
Und viel zu viele Gesichter hier
Von denen man hofft, dass man sie nie wieder sieht
Aber nicht einer, der Liebe gibt (ey)
Ja, ich zieh' mir den Weltschmerz rein, würde gern Feldherr sein
Doch bin nur Bauer und schätze meinen Selbstwert falsch ein
In einer Welt, in der die Helden nicht gewinnen
Weiß ich noch nicht mal selber, wer ich bin (ja)
Oft ist es nicht trist, sondern schwarz
Vor Sonnenaufgang ist es am dunkelsten
Doch ich weiß, du bist für mich da

Minus mal Minus ist Plus, du weißt
Du bist nicht allein, nein
Dein Neid halbiert sich, wenn ich's mit dir teil'
Und ich lass' dich nicht im Stich, kommt vorbei
Minus mal Minus ist Plus, ich weiß
Ich bin nicht allein, nein
Mein Neid halbiert sich, wenn du's mit mir teilst

Drehen eine Runde, eine Runde um den Block
Eine Runde durch jedes Viertel, 'ne Runde in mei'm Kopf
Keine Runde durch alle Ecken und Kanten meiner Stadt
Jetzt sag', merkst du etwas?
Die Runde dreht uns im Kreis
Bei Hektik bleib' ich locker und sag' „Bruder“
Aber fuchtel' mit der Hand
Ich wichs' den Kopf von deinen Schultern, Jiggo
Denn sie verwechseln Angst mit Respekt
Aber meine Augen sprechen, dass ich beiß', wenn ich bell'
Guck mich an, ich hab' nichts zu verlieren
Ist bei mir leider keine Floskel
Ich setz' und riskier' alles, alles
Ich lasse keinen zurück, der beweist
Ich bin ein Traumfänger, guck
Ich hab' mein Viertel mitgesigned, jap
Ich lasse dich nicht im Stich heißt (Stich heißt)
Stich deiner zu, soll es mich teilen (mich teilen)
Und zerreißt es mich in zwei
Hab' ich mein Leid nur geteilt

Minus mal Minus ist Plus, du weißt
Du bist nicht allein, nein
Dein Neid halbiert sich, wenn ich's mit dir teil'
Und ich lass' dich nicht im Stich, kommt vorbei
Minus mal Minus ist Plus, ich weiß
Ich bin nicht allein, nein
Mein Neid halbiert sich, wenn du's mit mir teilst
Minus eins mal Minus eins - wir(d) zwei

Wir leben in einer Welt, in der man Schwache nicht beschützt
Wirst du müde, hilft dir keiner, nein, sie lassen dich zurück
Und du wächst auf mit Angst davor, mal den Anschluss zu verlieren
In 'nem System, das alle einreiht und Charakter unterdrückt
Du bist nicht frei, du bist nur frei von Macht (ey)
Denn hier ist nur frei, wer Scheine hat (ey)
Ey und du bist nur der Esel, den man mit 'ner Angel Futter vor die Nase hält
Während man ihn reitet und die Angst nach Futter - rasend schnell
Aber schnappen wirst du's nie
Dabei willst du nur zur Sonne, aus dem Schatten, aber wie?
Man zeigt dir den ganzen Kuchen und die Krümel sind für dich
Mit den Jahren kriegst du 'n Knacks in deiner Psyche und zerbrichst
Und man lügt dir ins Gesicht mit Erfolgsdaten
Denn es gibt nur zehn Münzen, nicht alle können neun haben
Alles wird sich ändern irgendwann
Ey und bis zu dem Tag, bin ich für dich da - Disarstar

Just vanity insanity fusion cannot stand it see
No man fascist man will ever get me outta the land
So understand Fusion plan to stop them with a bang
We sang and sang to make the people all unite
Not fight but fight because the leaders don't think right
You burnt us in the past you know it won't happen again
So black and white take a stand and all try to defend
All of the people and the children who are living in the past
Just blast and blast don't make the fascist man last

All the leaders and the rulers who are putting up the fence
It's dense immense and you say you're talking sense
Bull, bull I want to say it full
But people on the radio you know will make a pull
So I try to tone it down to make the whole world know
That the language of my violence will proceed in my show
Flow, flow to make the fascist man know
that unity is here and unity will grow

No appeal on the docket today
Just my own sin
The walls are cold and pale
The cage made of steel
Screams fill the room
Alone I drop and kneel
Silence now the sound
My breath the only motion around
Demons cluttering around
My face showing no emotion
Shackled by my sentence
Expecting no return
Here there is no penance
My skin begins to burn

(And I said oh) So I held my head up high
Hiding hate that burns inside
Which only fuels their selfish pride
(And I said oh) All held captive
Out from the sun
A sun that shines on only some
We the meek are all in one

I hear a thunder in the distance
See a vision of a cross
I feel the pain that was given
On that sad day of loss
A lion roars in the darkness
Only he holds the key
A light to free me from my burden
And grant me life eternally

Breaking trance   so silent 
So I can stay the same

Shackled by my sentence

But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then Is this the end?

Momma told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then Is this the end?

Sometimes I be wakin up at high noon
sayin, ""Why me Lord?"" -- folks thinkin I'ma die soon
I just tell em keep seekin, but when they sleepin
I be concealed up in my room, knowin that it could happen
I'm just tryin to maintin, because the future is untold
till the static unfolds that the good die young
Please God let a Bad Boy die old
Do you think I wanna lie cold
Or better yet have many shots come close to the head
Shirt soaked til it's red
The most that was said was that my homies had a toast to the dead
Do I need a pack a vest for stress so I can rest
Cause even though I'm blessed in my flesh
It all came down to a test
A motherfucker wanna go and put a tattoo on my chest
Now I'm caught up in the mix and I can't do shit, but still
I can't ride with program, fearing no man
Hit the car door let the door slam it's a blessing that he had slow hands
But he's still right behind me
All these heartless fools is steady comin after my P
So many phony niggaz lovin to hate Sean
So many cheddar niggaz comin after my cheese
Is it my car that they're losin, are we all for the choosin?
Or is it all in confusion?  Better yet all an illusion
Shots rang through the hall bullets cruisin for bruisin
Don't let this heartless bastard take my life away
I don't wanna conceive takin his either
Dipped into the back and took a breather
Heard steps steady in closin with the bullet skeezer
Gotta do somethin, I ain't scared to go
but yet my heart is steady pumpin for somethin
I refuse to be the one that they be dumpin
Gotta get away before the techs start gunnin
Bodies start jumpin, wreckin my brain not to try and understand
but withstand, is it cause I'm a rich man
Or just to try to put a brother down in the dirt like quicksand
But no matter what the reason, I don't wanna stop breathin
There's dreams to fulfill still
Can't complete em with a still kill
Face to face with enemies still grill
Forgive me for the pain I've caused and the sins I've committed
even though I'm not hopin to go
I wish someone would open the do'
This man's holding the trigger and his finger's steady choking it slow
Is this the end?

Momma told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then Is this the end?

Just, can't, let, go Is this the end?
I, just, don't, know
Wish it would've happened then

Did I just hear a tight jam, now it's on let make my maneuver
Hit the alley saw a man in a landcruiser
In his hand was a Ruger, dipped in a Lex like Luger
Heard shots from a steel bruiser
Teflon in the seat took a pale stress
Felt the hate on my chest as I placed on my vest
What's wrong with the brakes in the LX?
Ran straight into a lightpole, just before I got my life stole
A car came to the rescue
I bailed in and said, ""Bless you
But what made me the man you would wanna show help to?""
I proceeded to ask him, and he said with a passion

I could never watch a soul die, plus you the man lookin too fly
But who are you?  The pimp nigga named Twista from the cold Chi
When the sun's shy gotta keep one eye, nigga I been shot at and stole on
No protection from one time, only caught for my prime
So I asked the Father what I did so wrong?
Cause shit it's been hard for me besides chief
and the smell of sweet news when the beef brew
Motherfuckers steady ballin but steady fallin
right in detours, bout to hit my feet soon
So I just presume, deep into the rhymes of a rapper
Prepare my mind for the capture
Thinkin Ginuwine like the bachelor
But why these niggaz wanna make us into crime with the rapture?
Ego for dispersin us, don't even hurt the clutch
Cause he's coldblooded and merciless
Steady bustin shots at both of us, was the strap close to us
Then for survival we both to bust
But Renaults get to roast to crush, cause he steady gettin closer
Paranoid like a crackfiend when the gat seen
scream when the bullet hit me in the shoulder
Don't wanna die til I get older
Try to visualize the beholder, he's inconceivable
so now my sight is gettin dark a lot
Best to step off in this parking lot where them dogs bark a lot
And try to wait until his ma get hot
I can make a person fight to survive whether good or connivin
You never know when it's your time to leave
Smokin weed to keep my mind at ease, let's go back to the car
but wait, I can't find the keys
Plus we didn't chill long enough, the footsteps are comin close
Is it one of them unholy men?
With a strap ready to boldly sin
Mama told me it was comin, but I wish she woulda told me when
Is this the end?

Momma told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then Is this the end?

It's about time, about time to find pieces of me I have lost
Without any choice I move on

Hey time you're no friend of mine

You cover yourself you cover your skin
Your cover yourself like you cover your sins
Please untie my hands

When I fall'
It's so very clear
You left me when I had no one at all
No one at all

Creedence Clearwater Revisited,"As long as I remember
The rain's been comin' down
Clouds of mystery pourin'
Confusion on the ground

Good men through the ages
Tryin' to find the sun
And I wonder, still I wonder
Who'll stop the rain

I went down Virginia
Seekin' shelter from the storm
Caught up in the fable
I watched the tower grow

Five year plans and new deals
Wrapped in golden chains
And I wonder, still I wonder
Who'll stop the rain?

Heard the singers playin'
How we cheered for more
The crowd then rushed together
Tryin' to keep warm

Still the rain kept pourin'
Fallin' on my ears

There's a calm before the storm,
I know; it's been comin' for some time.
When it's over, so they say,
It'll rain a sunny day,
I know; shinin' down like water.

I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain
Comin' down on a sunny day?

Yesterday, and days before,
Sun is cold and rain is hard,
I know; been that way for all my time.
'Til forever, on it goes
Through the circle, fast and slow,
I know; it can't stop, I wonder.

I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain
Comin' down on a sunny day?

Yeah!
