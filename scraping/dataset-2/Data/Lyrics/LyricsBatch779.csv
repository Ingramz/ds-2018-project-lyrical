New Order,"Who saw those dark eyes
Who saw those dark eyes
These years gone by
Deep within
Burn my skin
All those years gone by
In the heat of the night
All those years gone by
 
Who felt those cold hands
Who felt those cold hands
Touch my skin
Deep within
Burn my soul
Fell to the ground
Where I was found
All those years ago
All those tears ago
All those years ago
 
Everybody makes mistakes
Everybody makes mistakes
Even me
Just be free
This is a place
Where in the end
It happens in
Our world within
 
Time to go
Time to go",Ultraviolence,1983
New Order,"When a new life turns towards you
And the night becomes a day
We shall remain forever
Everyone who meets this way
Oh, our love is like the flowers
The rain, the sea and the hours
Oh, our love is like the flowers
The rain, the sea and the hours
 
When the rain falls to the sea
They'll be waiting for you and for me     
And the sky reflects our image
Trying to sleep right through our lives
 
Oh, our love is like the earth
The sun, the trees and the birth
Oh, our love is like the earth
The sun, the trees and the birth
 
I am still here two days later
Same place, same time
And I'm stuck here two years too long
Same place, the wrong time
 
Oh, our love is like the flowers
The rain, the sea and the hours
Oh, our love is like the flowers
The sun, the sea and the hours
 
Their love died three years ago
Spoken words I cannot show",The Village,1983
New Order,"Three miles to go
Three miles to go

New Order,"Ah

Careful what you do to me

You've caused me some problems, you've taken my place

Why can't you see what you mean to me?

It's called love
And somehow it's become unmentionable

And it belongs to every one of us
It's called love

New Order,"Ever since I've seen your face
This life of mine has gone to waste
I was young and you were old
And I always knew you were cold
At the start you had a heart
But in the end you lost your friend
Can you see your own dark face?
It's dying in a lonely place

Oh, how I cannot bear the thought of you
I said, oh, how I cannot bear the thought of you

As we get old, we lose our place
Reflecting back the world's disgrace
I feel so low, I feel so humble
Sometimes in life we take a tumble
Don't let anybody tell you that you're no good
Cause you know they would
Don't let anybody tell you what you should do
Cause it's not that way and...

Oh, how I cannot bear the thought of you
I said, oh, how I cannot bear the thought of you
We were young and we were pure
And life was just an open door
I said oh, oh, how I cannot bear the thought of you

You were me and I was you
This world of ours it felt brand new
You took me a little further...
I heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I can't hear it anymore
Your hair was long, your eyes was blue
Guess what I'm gonna do to you

New Order,"Oh I've just come from the land of the sun
From a war that must be won

Your freedom we will save
With our rifles and grenades

I want to see my family
My wife and child waiting for me
I've got to go home
I've been so alone, you see

You just can't believe
The joy I did receive
When I finally got my leave
And I was going home
Oh I flew through the sky
My convictions could not lie
For my country I would die

I've come so far to see you all
I can see your deep blue eyes
They sleep beneath the open sky
Before you stands one like your brother
Swear to God he needs no other
But how can I afford to be
Here with you so carelessly
You know what you did was so unkind
You search for the life we need to find
There's right and there's wrong
And there's good and there's bad
And there's an answer to this I wish I had

Oh, you know what I mean, yes you do
Oh, you know what I mean, yes you do

Well we had a party in our hotel last night
It ended up in an awful fight
My friend left me and my heart too
I hope I don't end up like you

Oh, you know what I mean, yes you do
Oh, you know what I mean, yes you do

Your country is a wonderful place
It pales my England into disgrace
To buy a drink that is so much more reasonable
I think I'll go there when it gets seasonable

New Order,"I've been waiting to hear your voice for too long now
One way conversations do not work somehow
Tell me how does one get your soul in touch with the one above
When one way conversations pay a price for the use of love
I tried so hard last night you would not talk to me
I live with the fear of the few with the gift
And I know what's going to be

Why did you never speak my name in front of my family
You gave a gift that you then took away
Like you never did before
Your name might be God but you don't say that much to me
Your name might be God but you don't say that much to me
We might be your black sheep
But you forgot us a long time ago
We might be your lost sheep
But it's time you remembered us now

As we spend our days together, nothing can go wrong
No one told the truth about it because it was so strong
If you ever think of me, if you hear my name
If you read between the lines, you'll hang your head in shame
These ? ears will never hear, the ice will never freeze

All pleasure nothing to gain

I've grown used to your wooden heart
Now you know my name
You search your empty brain in vain

You'll end up here with me unraised (???)
Without you they'll never know
Without you my life won't flow
Without you they'll never show
Without you the night won't go
Without you I'm left alone
Without you I'm on my own
Without you I lay in pain
Without you I've gone insane

Now you must decide
What good's a lie when you've nothing to hide
Maps they'll never show
They're dumb like you, they never know
It's time we said goodbye
Bury your head and silence your cry
Know the feel of pain
Join our world and play our game

Without you they'll never know
Without you my life won't grow
Without you they'll never show

One of these days
I like walking in the park
When it gets late at night
I move 'round in the dark (the dark)
And leave when it gets light
I sit around by day
Tied up in chains so tight
These crazy words of mine
So wrong they could be

I always try, I always miss (woah)
One of these days you'll go back to your home (one of these days)

I like talking in my sleep
When people work so hard
They need what they can't keep
A choice that leaves them scarred

You've lost what you had
What do I get out of this?

Who died at the hands of a desperate man
He trusted those who he thought he knew
He trusted those who he looked up to

He'd laugh and he'd cry and he'd ruin my place
He'd drive me crazy, and he'd drive me wild
I used to scream and shout all day long

Now I hope you know this song
Is about a child who now has gone

How many ways

You never knew
With open arms I came to you
Judging me so safe to be with

New Order,"It was January, nineteen-sixty-three
When Johnny came home with a gift for me
He said I bought it for you because I love you
And I bought it for you 'cause it's your birthday, too
He was so very nice, he was so very kind
To think of me at this point in time
I used to think of him, he used think of me
He told me to close my eyes
My gift would be a great surprise
I saw tears were in his eyes
He never meant to hurt me
Oh, God, Johnny, don't point that gun at me
There's so many ways our lives have changed
But please, I beg, don't do this to me
Johnny, don't point that gun at me
Can I save my life at any price?
For God's sake won't you listen to me?

And though he was ashamed that he had took a life
Johnny came home with another wife
And I often remembered how it used to be
Before that special occasion, nineteen-sixty-three
There was too many ways that you could kill someone
Like in a love affair, when the love has gone
He used to think of her, she used to think of him

And I bought it for you because it's your birthday, too
He was so very nice, he was so very kind
To think of me at this point in time
I used to think of him, he used think of me

He never meant to hurt me

But please, I beg, don't do this to me

You built a wall of love and tore it right down in front of me
And you think you know what's going on
You keep telling me that I am wrong
I don't care about what you do
Cause if you mess with me, I'll get rid of you.

The picture you see is no portrait of me
It's too real to be shown to someone I don't know
And it's driving me wild

It makes me act like a child.

You think I am crazy, but what can I do
You waste your time, like my money
It ain't so funny, but it's true
Don't waste my money, baby
Now you can't tell me what's going on
And that I am weak while you are strong

Do you really know, cause it doesn't show.

Tell me it's not true

Get down on my knees

And you took my heart

Now you've gotta know
I want you to stay

Don't leave me alone
You'll tear me apart

You were not real
You came to stay

But now we kneel

You got the world if you want it
I ain't done with you yet

I work hard just to keep you by my side
Every day and almost every night
In the end you took away my heart
Left me alone

Lived through their vocations

They will turn away no more

To say what I need to say

I can and shall obey
But if it wasn't for your misfortunes
I'd be a heavenly person today

In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her!

With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

If it's blues you are cravin' just come on down.

It's drivin' me insane,
Can't keep still, tho' it's against my will;
I'm on my P's and Q's I just can't refuse.

There goes that melody, it sounds so good to me,
And I am up a tree,
It's a shame, you don't know the name;
It's a brand new blues, 
The Royal Garden Blues.

Everybody grab somebody And start jazzing 'round

Hon don't you hear that trombone moan? 
Just listen to that saxophone.
Gee, hear that clarinet and flute, 
Cornet jazzin' with a mute,
Makes me just throw myself away, 
When I hear 'em play.

That weepin' melancholy strain, 
Say, but it's soothing to the brain;
Just wanna get right up and dance,

Def be the beat that I'm rockin'
Yo so, come get a hit
And put your thinking cap on, you've been forewarned
I call upon the inner forces that I've got brewin' in my cauldron

That means my nugget, sometimes I'm rugged
The style I posses be havin', the other brothers buggin'
And this is for those who oppose
To propose to overexpose disclose
Pose a threat to my brother

What do you expect to win when you're used to playing craps?

Do that, do that somebody

It's gettin' tricky, I mean it's a sticky situation
To resurrect a groove with feeling and give it this much affection
Passion flows and who knows what lurks in the gallows of my mind
I put my foot in the ass of Jim Crow

12 inches of non-stop sole
I'm on a roll with P, it's time for the show
So do that, do that somebody
Wave your hands in the air

Give yourself a bone

To layin' some chrome upside some motherfuckers dome

After all the things that we've been through
You gave your body to another in the name of fun
I hope you had some, baby, if not - boo hoo

Like a day without sunshine
It's so bad but I hate you
Cause you're all that's ever on my mind

Honey I hate you
Now every day will be a waste of time
Cause I hate you

I never thought that I could feel this way
To fall in love was a table reserved for fools
Say you're sorry if you want to but it's all in vain
I'm out the door, sweet baby, that's right
We're through
(rpt 1)

(This court is now in session
Will the defendant please rise?
State your name for the court...never mind
You're being charged with one too many counts
Of heartbreaking in the first degree
I don't give a damn about the others
My main concern is you and me)

Your honor, may I call to the stand
My one and only witness?
A girl that knows damn well
She didn't have no damn business
I know what you did, how you did it and who you did it with
So you might as well plead guilty
Cause you sure can't plead the fifth
Now raise your right hand
Do you swear to tell the whole truth
Not the half truth like you used to, so help you God?
Nod your head one time if you hear me
If you don't, I'll have to use the rod
Anything to make you see, that uh, you're gonna miss me
Yeah, you're gonna miss me

(If it pleases the court
I'd like to have the defendant
Place her hands behind her back
So I can tie her up tight and get into the act
The act of showing her how good it used to be
I want it to be so good she falls back into love with me
Close your eyes
I'm gonna cover your ass with this sheet
And I want you to pump your hips like you used to
And baby, you better stay on the beat)

Did you do to your other men
The same things that you did to me?
Right now I hate you so much I want to make love until you see
That it's killin' me baby to be without you
Cause all I ever wanted to do was to be with you
I hate you because I love you
But I can't love you because I hate you...

Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along
And so you're back
From outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock, I should have made you leave your key

Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
Do you think I'd crumble
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
And I've got all my love to give and I'll survive
I will survive, hey, hey

It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
Kept trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh-so many nights just feeling sorry for myself

But now I hold my head up high and you see me
Somebody new
I'm not that chained-up little person and still in love with you
And so you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free
Well, now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's loving me

Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win

Makes me stop just before I begin

I seem like someone else.

I don't see why he moves me.

Should I scream and shout?

Don't you think it's rather funny, 
I should be in this position.

So calm, so cool, no lover's fool, 
Running every show. 
He scares me so.
I never thought I'd come to this. 
What's it all about?
Yet, if he said he loved me, 
I'd be lost. I'd be frightened.

New World Philharmonic,"Daylight, see the dew on the sunflower
And a rose that is fading
Roses whither away like the sunflower
I yearn to turn my face to the dawn
I am waiting for the day

Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone in the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days, I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every street lamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in when the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun if you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is

Look
A new day has begun",Memory [From Cats],2011

It's keeping me awake,
And every breath I take,
Feels like it's my last
I want to be fine,I want to be sure
I want to be a lot of things,
And none of them include you.
I keep telling myself,
I'm not miserable
I keep telling myself,
I'm better off without you

I believed that you meant
Everything you said,
Goodbye,and thanks for the memories
For the pain and the lies
Every time I had to cry
Goodbye,and thanks for the memories

I don't understand,
Cause it doesn't make sense
The way you broke it off,
Took away my heart,
Took away all of my friends
I want to go out
And get out of this house
Bet to begin again 
Is gonna take more than
I think I'd ever have to give.

All the time that was spent,
Being used,I should have said,
Goodbye and thanks for the memories.

I want to know why,
You're such an idiot,
I want to know how
You can even live with it.
I wanna know why,
I should even give a damn
About you missing me so terribly.

I'm starting to sleep,
A little easier now.
Now that I'm over this
And I've made up my mind 
To never fall in love again,
With someone like you
Someone so confused
I just wish I would have
Realized that a long 
Time before I had.

New York Choral Society,"'Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care
In the hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there
The children were nestled all snug in their beds
While visions of sugar plums danced in their heads.
Mom in her kerchief and I in my cap
Had just settled down for a long winter's nap.
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter
I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter
Away to the window I flew with a flash
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash
The moon on the breast of the new fallen snow
Gave a luster of mid-day to objects below.
When what to my wondering eyes should appear
But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer
With a little old driver so lively and quick
Well I knew in a moment, it must be St. Nick
More rapid than eagles, his coursers they came
And he whistled and he shouted and he called them by name
""On Dasher, on Dancer, on Prancer and Vixen
On Comet, on Cupid, on Donner and Blitzen!
To the top of the porch, to the top of the wall
Now, dash away, dash away, dash away all!""
As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly
When they meet to an obstacle mount to the sky
So up to the rooftop the coursers they flew
With a sleigh full of toys and St. Nicholas too.
And then in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing, the pawing of each little hoof
As I drew in my head and was turning around
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound
He was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back
And he looked like a peddler just op'ning his pack
His eyes, how they twinkled, his dimples, how merry
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry
His droll little mouth was drawn up in a bow
And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow
The stump of a pipe, he held tight in his teeth
And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath
He had a broad face and a little round belly
That shook when laughed (ho, ho, ho, ho) like a bowl full of jelly (ho, ho, ho, ho)
He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf
And I laughed when I saw him in spite of myself
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread
He spoke not a word but went straight to his work
And filled all the stockings and turned with a jerk
And laying a finger to the side of his nose
And giving a nod up the chimney he rose
He sprang to his sleigh, and to his team gave a whistle
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle
But I heard him exclaim as he drove out of sight
""Merry Christmas to all and to all..goodnight
Goodnight.""",'Twas the Night Before Christmas,1988

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.

It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2008

With my little girl who was back in the States
I was stranded in the jungle, afraid, alone
Trying to figure a way to get a message back home
But how was I to know that the wreckage of my plane
Had been picked up and spotted and my girl in Lover's Lane

Meanwhile, back in the States


Baby, baby, let's make romance
You know your old-time lover hasn't got a chance
He's stranded in the jungle, sad as he can be
So come on pretty baby, just you and me


Meanwhile, back in the jungle


The boys in the jungle had me on the run
When something heavy hit me like an atomic bomb
When I woke up and my head started to clear
I had a strange feeling I was cooking gear
I smelled something cooking and I looked to see
That's when I found out they was cookin' me
Ooga booga, lemme outta here!


Meanwhile, back in the States


Baby, baby, let's make romance
You know your old-time lover hasn't got a chance
He's stranded in the jungle sad as he can be
So come on pretty baby just you and me


Meanwhile, back in the jungle


I jumped out of the pot, I finally got away
I was frantic, worried about what my baby would say
So I jumped in the ocean and started to swim
My chance of surviving was gettin' slim
So I thumbed down a whale that was headed my way
And I reached the States in about half a day
When I got to Lover's Lane I was almost dead
Heard him talkin' to my baby, and this is what he said


Baby, baby, the man's no good
Baby, baby, should have understood
You can trust me just as long as you please
So come back pretty baby where you used to be
Cause I love you (I love you, I love you, you're fine baby)
Cause I love you (So damn fine)
Cause I love you (I got a job; I have money too)
Cause I love you (Did I show you my vehicle)
Cause I love you (I'll take you for a ride)
Cause I love you

I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had Spring fever
But I know it isn't Spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be Spring

See how you've changed in your fight to be free
Political intervention
Is something we shouldn't mention
But I've seen your face on every screen
And it's looking at me

You used to be so close
I could have touched your hand
I see your picture now
And you've become a no-man's land

I long to visit you
But now it seems too late
Don't let these modern times
Make you one more mistake

Take my heart, take my soul
You've captured all of me
If you can't let me go
Then live in peace and set me free

Distant horizons you're surprising me

Political intervention
Is something we shouldn't mention
But I've seen your face on every screen
And it's looking at me


You're reaching out to me
I hide inside your smile
It's time for us to love
But we must wait a while

I long to visit you
And there live out my fate
Don't let these lying eyes
Lead you to hesitate

Take my heart, take my soul
You've captured all of me
If you can't let me go
Then live in peace and set me free

Distant horizons you're surprising me
See how you've changed in your fight to be free

Distant horizons you're surprising me
If you can't let me go, in peace let me be

Capturing me, looking at me, capturing me

Brought a new spot to my life

There's so much left that I want to do
Automatically I think of you

Chorus:

You beginning and you to end
You were the first you never bend
You walk beside me everywhere I go
Our secret's safe they'll never know
But here we are walking on down Electric avenue
Part of today in every way Electric avenue

I'm insecure and I'm not so sure
Cause you mean this much to me
Your heart is cold and you won't grow old
I'm full of tricks so watch and see
I can disappear without a trace
Just say the word I'll be gone from this place
There's so much left that I want to do
I'm automatic that I think of you

You held me close and turned away
And you were gone
I said I couldn't understand
Why you need a foreign land
What's wrong with home?

I need to breathe
Need to see what this life's got in store for me
Take a chance while I can
Not one also ran

Chorus:

I'm on a flight and its taking me closer
Home to a heart that's been left for so long
Time is all that holds me now
And the days have come and gone while I have flown
I'm coming home

I've read your letters, heard of your success
Does that mean happiness? Yes or no?
Temptation that lay across your path
Is it to much to ask to think of me?

I had to fight to be right
There was never a champion for me
Knights in armour don't exist
It's been such a risk

",Flight,1983
New York Renaissance Band,"Day by day I'm feeling the need
To search to find
Hear the voices speaking to me
They're in my mind
It's Majik, it's tragic

What is happening to me?
Another no name tragedy
Majik (can't you understand)
Majik (the children are close at hand)

Once so long ago I'd explain
Each feeling clear
Now the thoughts they dance and they weave
To disappear
It's Majik, it's tragic

What is happening to me?
Another lost game lost to me
Majik (have the rights to resist)
Majik (before it takes to the wrist)

Surround yourself in a cloak of stars
This must be heaven
You've held to answer the early hours
They have been given to you

What is happening to me?
Another lost game lost to me
What is happening to me?
Lost in twilight memories
Majik (now your life's in a test)
Majik (feel your voice in a fist)

What is happening to me?
Another lost game lost to me
What is happening to me?
Another no name tragedy
What is happening to me?
Hear the voice I speak to me
What is happening to me?

Another no name tragedy
What is happening to me?
Another lost game lost to me ...



",Majik,1983
New York Renaissance Band,"It's tragic--keeps on happening all the time
It's the kind of thing that I fear
I feel I'm making no headway
Walls I know are starting to disappear

It's like they'd never existed, strange but true
As sure as I'm talking to you
Now you see it, now I don't want to frighten you
But I'm simply here standing alone

Chorus I:

Trapped in these shadows that belong to missing persons
Names faded from memory join the list and then mark time
Once I would have been glad to have made your acquaintance
Now I feel a danger brought about by circumstance

Obsessed, the quality of life escapes me now
It's one of the things I lack
From the east and to the west
I feel it's time that I was heading back

I can't control these feelings that I have
I've never been one to hide
Become a pillar of society
But don't let your morals slide

Chorus II:

Or you can find that you've become a missing person
A here today gone tomorrow breeze and lost in the night
Once I would have been glad to have made your acquaintance
Now I feel a danger brought about by circumstance

But I know in the end, I'll be safe, we'll be happy
After finding myself we'll be fine
Any problems we have will be gone in a moment
I'll become just a state of the mind

I want you close
I need you near
You have to be here
I turned around
You've gone again

So much pain to see that love betrays
I will never love again
For love lies, and it will die in the end

If I had known it all somehow
Always believing love is deceiving
I could have held my shattered dreams
Seen all the things I should have seen

Here I am: I'm lost, and love's astray
I can never love again

But now I know that love just lies
Leaving me hollow, nothing to follow
So I will never give my heart
And I will be a woman apart

Now I know love is bound to die

And love was nothing but a need
Devoured by an empty greed
The ashes fill my empty heart
I will always stand apart

A kiss, the questions never asked
And now I know that love just lies
I know love is bound to die

Was tinged with the sadness

Again, I was wrong

And only last year
Everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again

If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it till that eagle grins

'Cause I found out that nobody wants you
Nobody wants you when they find out
That you're down and out
In your pocket, there's not not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

Just let you get back up on your feet again

And candle lights on little corner tables

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The song that Crosby sings

And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light

New York Theatre Orchestra & Chorus,"Daylight, see the dew on the sunflower
And a rose that is fading
Roses whither away like the sunflower
I yearn to turn my face to the dawn
I am waiting for the day

Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone in the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days, I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every street lamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in when the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun if you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is

Look
A new day has begun",Memory [From Cats],1988

That this heart of mine embraces all day through
In that small cafe, the park across the way
The children's carousel, 
The chestnut trees, the wishing well

I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

And high above
The moon was new
And so was love

Lover where can you be

Love had its day

New York Trio,"The weather is frightening.
The thunder and lightning
Seem to be having their way.
But as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day. 
The turn in the weather
Will keep us together
So I can honestly say,
That as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day
And everything's okay.

Isn't this a lovely day to be caught in the rain.
You were going on your way, now you've got to remain.

Just as you were going, leaving me all at sea,
The clouds broke, they broke and oh what a break for me.

I can see the sun up high, though we're caught in a storm.
I can see where you and I could be cozy and warm.

New York Trio,"My thoughts go back to a heavenly dance
A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts' content

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

There 'neath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon

The moon descended
And I found with the break of dawn
You and the song had gone
But the melody lingers on",The Song Is Ended,2008

New York Twelve,"Our little dream castle with every dream gone,
Is lonely and silent, the shades are all drawn,
And my heart is heavy as I gaze upon
A cottage for sale

The lawn we were proud of is waving in hay,
Our beautiful garden has withered away,
Where you planted roses,the weeds seem to say,
A cottage for sale.

From every single window, I see your face,
But when I reach a window, there's empty space.
The key's in the mail box the same as before,
But no one is waiting any more,
The end of the story is told on the door.

New York Unit,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
