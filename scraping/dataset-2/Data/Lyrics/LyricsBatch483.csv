John Leven,"When light goes down, I see no reason
For you to cry. We've been through this before
In every time, in every season,
God knows I've tried
So please don't ask for more.

Can't you see it in my eyes
This might be our last goodbye

Carrie, Carrie, things they change my friend
Carrie, Carrie, maybe we'll meet again

I read your mind, with no intentions
Of being unkind, I wish I could explain
It all takes time, a whole lot of patience
If it's a crime, how come I feel no pain.",Carrie,1986

John Leven,"They lived in peace, not long ago
A mighty Indian tribe
But the winds of change,
Made them realize, that the promises were lies.

The white man's greed, in search of gold
Made the nation bleed
They lost their faith
And now they had to learn
There was no place to return
Nowhere they could turn.

Cherokee - marching on the trail of tears.

They were driven hard, across the plains
And walked for many moons
Cause the winds of change,
Had made them realize, that the promises were lies.

So much to bear, all that pain
Left them in despair
They lost their faith
And now they had to learn
There was no place to return
Nowhere they could turn. 
",Cherokee,1986
John Leven,"I was heading for the mountains
I had saved so much for you
And in the town I left behind me
There was nothing left to do.

I knew that you were waiting
For me to share your life
Cause I told you when I left, that
When I come back you'll be my wife.

But someone was waiting
In the shadows of the night
Someone was waiting
It just didn't feel right.

Danger on the track
Something told me there were
Strangers on my back
And I was so right.

Maybe I should surrender
Maybe I should give it up
But the strength I had inside
Told me you can never stop.

The men wanted to break me
Steal and bring me down
But I fought for you and later
They were lying on the ground.

John Leven,"We're leaving together,
But still it's farewell
And maybe we'll come back,
To earth, who can tell?
I guess there is no one to blame
We're leaving ground
Will things ever be the same again?

It's the final countdown,
We're heading for Venus and still we stand tall
Cause maybe they've seen us and welcome us all
With so many light years to go and things to be found
I'm sure that we'll all miss her so.",The Final Countdown [Live][*],1986
John Leven,"I've told you once and I've told you twice
Wait for that day, when our love will rise
To that song that brought our hearts together.

Even though you're mistreating me
I know the girl that you used to be
For me those days were meant to last forever.

Time after time I'm wondering why
Am I to be all alone
Day after day I pray that you'll stay
Cause you've got a heart of stone.

I walk the streets like a broken man
Oh I wish that you would understand
Even though you're still the one I wait for.

I guess in love there's no guarantee
Sometimes it's not what it seems to be
Even though you're still the one I care for. 
",Heart of Stone,1986
John Leven,"Someone's at your door tonight
Someone wants your love
Is it real or just imagination
You decide to wait inside 'til the break of dawn
In dreams you see yourself seeking affection.

He'll know just who you are
He'll know just where you've been
He'll know just what to do.

Love chaser - If you look deep in his eyes
Then you're in for a big surprise
He can take your breath away
There's nothing you can do or say.

You can feel that someone's at your back
You can hear his pounding heart
But something tells you not to be afraid
Cause even in the darkest night
Someone's at your side
But when morning comes it all starts to fade away. 
",Love Chaser,1986
John Leven,"Tell me the story, tell me the legend
Tell me the tales of war
Tell me just one time,
What it was like before
Bring me the feeling, right in that moment
When a heart for battle cries
Find me the treasure where the legend lies.

If I were a noble ancient knight
I'd stand by jour side to rule and fight
It will always feel the same
When I call out your name.

Ninja survive, in dreams I walk by your side
Ninja survive, with you there's no need to hide.

A handful of sayings are more than a reason
For me to feel this way
I'd like to be near you
Maybe for just one day
So tell me the legend, tell me the story
Tell me the tales of war
Tell me just one time
What it was like before. 
",Ninja,1986
John Leven,"Running out on the streets
He lives from day to day
Looking for something to do
He needs to get away.

Hoping that maybe one day
He could be someone
Praying that maybe someday
He could be number one.

In his world of make believe
He always tends to be

On the loose, so young, so tough, so wild

On the loose, again.

Dreaming, dreaming about
All the things he'd like to do
Trying, trying so hard
To make it all up to you. 
",On The Loose,1986
John Leven,"I've gone through changes
I've gone through pain
But there's not enough reason for me to go insane
I know the feeling, when it grows
I'm in a rage up from my head down to my toes.

You know it ain't easy
Running out of thrills
You know it ain't easy
When you don't know what you want.

Rock now, rock the night
'Til early in the morning light
Rock now, rock the night
You'd better believe it's right.

I know my limit
Just what it takes
When things ain't good enough
I just pull the brake
Sometimes it's easy
Sometimes so tough
But just have one thing clear
I can't get enough.",Rock The Night,1986
John Leven,"Long for the sailor, beneath the skies
Long for the white dove, no matter where she flies
Long for the stranger you know so well.

Pray for the soldier, who's wounded bad
Pray for the dreamer, he's still so sad
Pray for the stranger you know so well.

Cause I'm coming home.

Now the time has come

For me to come back home.

Long for the eagle, on wings so strong
Long for the hunter, he won't be long
Long for the stranger you know so well. 
",Time Has Come,1986
John Leventhal,"We tried to make ourselves pay for something we've never done
We threw the best parts of life away on street talk strangers and drugs
What we really want is love what we really need is love
[ guitar ]
I want to call out your name I want to hold out my hand
A woman silent in the mirror tonight wants to talk to your mirror man
And what they really want is love and what they really need is love
[ guitar ]
We are ships in the night the water is deep in between
There is reason and we can't find the light so we sail off into our dreams
And what we really dream is love and what we really need is love
What we want is love what we need is love
[ guitar ]
We tried to make it feel right in someone else's world
We sat and looked out my window last night
And knew that things had changed with this girl
Cause what I really found was love cause what we really need is love
What we really want is love what we really need is love
What we want is love what we need is love",What We Really Want,1995
John Leventhal,"All I want is a room somewhere
Far away from the cold night air

Lots of chocolate for me to eat
Lots of coal burnin', lots of heat

John Levy,"Love walked right in and drove the shadows away
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello

One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

John Levy,"Just picture a penthouse way up in the sky
With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by
A sweet slice of Heaven for just you and I
When we're alone.

From all of society we'll stay aloof
And live in propriety there on the roof.
Two heavenly hermits we will be in truth
When we're alone.

We'll see life's mad pattern
As we view old Manhattan
Then we can thank our lucky stars
That we're living as we are.

In our little penthouse we'll always contrive
To keep love and romance forever alive
In view of the Hudson just over the drive,
When we're alone.

John Levy,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,
John Lewis,"What a day this has been!
What a rare mood I'm in!
Why, it's almost like being in love
 
There's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why it's almost like being in love
 
All the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing for me

I would swear I was falling
I could swear I was falling

John Lewis,"Love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing
But night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere

John Lewis,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!

But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame

For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul",Body and Soul,1960
John Lewis,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?

The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble

That makes the lonely winter seem long

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you

Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Quand la menace
Du fond de la cour
Grimpe et me glace

Regarde là-bas
Au bout de mon doigt
Si rien ne bouge
Le ciel devient rouge

Est-ce que je t'ai dis
L'histoire de cet homme
Qui voulait tout
Des femmes, de l'opium

Moralité
Il est mort alité
Tout passe, tout casse
Le joint, le cul lasse

J'te dis encore
Que l'hiver est mort
Rallonge tes tresses
Planque tes fesses

Quand les amoureux
S'ramassent à la pelle
Toutes les feuilles mortes
Se marrent entre elles

Et Il y a des chances que rien n'bouge
Ll y a des chances que rien n'bouge

Où elle va cet ombre?
Se perdre au loin
Sur qu'un grand nombre
N'y verra rien

Mon petit feu
J'tembrasse sur les yeux
Je quitti l'enveloppe
J't'aime plus qu'un peu

Et il y a des chances que rien
N'bouge
Il y a des chances que rien n'bouge

John Lewis,"Evenings are crowded with memories
Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
 
Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye
Wonder does she keep remembering
Promises of mine
When the moon is shining
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart

",In a Little Spanish Town,1994
John Lewis,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April,1999
John Lewis,"I was a humdrum person
Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw it away
That's why I ask the Lord in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream
'Til somebody else came near
Somebody else came near you
I felt the winter's chill
And now I sit and wonder night and day
Why I love you still?",What Is This Thing Called Love?,2001
John Lewis,"You're the sweetest thing
That I have ever seen
I really love you, baby
I'm gonna shake your tree

Lovey dovey, lovey dovey
All the time, all right
Lovey dovey
I can't get you out of my mind

Every time you kiss me
You just thrill me so
I'll never, never, never
Ever let you go

Lovey dovey, lovey dovey
All the time
Lovey dovey
I can't get you out of my mind, all right

I sigh with the feeling
When you're near me
I'm as high as the ceiling

Otis, hear me 'cause I love you, baby
More and more every day
You're something good to me, baby
You're just so sweet to me

Love you, baby, like I do my ma
I love you, love you, baby
And your sweet little charms

Lovey dovey, lovey dovey
All the time, come on
Lovey dovey
I can't get you out of my mind

Said, ""I sigh with the feeling
When you're near me
I'm as high as the ceiling
Otis, hear me""

'Cause I'm sayin' that I love you, honey
Place no one above you
You do something good, baby
I'm felling you, baby, you're just a

It's gotta be sunny to me

John Lewis,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her

I'm discontented with homes that are rented so I have invented my own.
Darling this place is a lover's oasis where life's weary chase is unknown.
Far from the cry of the city, where flowers pretty caress the streams,
Cozy to hide in, to love side-by-side in. Don't let it abide in my dreams.

Just me for you and you for me, alone! 
Nobody near us, to see us or hear us, 
No friends or relations on weekend vacations,
We won't have it known, dear, that we have a telephone, dear. 
Day will break and you'll awake and start to bake 
A sugar cake for me to take for all the boys to see.
We will raise a family, a boy for you, a girl for me, 
Oh, can't you see how happy life would be?

You are revealing a plan so appealing I can't help but falling for you,

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Were inspired to choose a form that was
The exact dimensions and the shape of the state whose name she bore

Yes the ship was shaped like Arkansas
And the hull was formed without a flaw
Every detail had been reproduced on a scale of one to one

I was on the coast of Arkansas when I saw her colors from the shore
And I sadly waved my handkerchief as the ship began to sing:

I'm the ship that's shaped like Arkansas
And my hull was formed without a flaw
Every detail has been reproduced on a scale of one to one

Avast, me hearties
Ahoy, me state
Ahoy, there
Avast, there

And the waves roll over Arkansas
Will the ship return to anchor there and replace the sunken state?

And I don't think I can stand any longer in this bed
Since I figured out Montana was a leg

I wasn't sure but now I know
And I can finally go
Give out my lungs
Give up and tell the information to the man in the next bed down
In the morning he'll tell someone the last thing that I said
When I told him that Montana was a leg

From the beginning there was something about it staring me
In the face I should have guessed it right away
When it started with a feeling that ended in a leg

It's ridiculous, how you put your lips on this
Don't kiss right there girlfriend I'm ticklish (heheh)

Get em all strung from the tip of my tongue
Lick em places niggas wouldn't dare put they faces (c'mon)
Before I die, hope I, remake a flow by
In the brand new treasure on a old try
Now when my third dry, even when the smoke lie
Eat the mami's chocha and drive her loca
We never ride far, packed five in a car
Save money for the drinks, I'm about to buy the bar (yeah)
And everywhere I drive I'm a star, little kids
All on the corner scream, ""That's my car!""
It was days couldn't be fly, now I'm in a T.I.
Come in clubs with B.I., now a nigga V.I. (uh-huh)

A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

My love is a prelude that never dies

With nothing fancy
Nothing much

My love is a prelude that never dies

John Lockwood,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low (Trio Only),2016
John Lockwood,"It's hard to learn 
How tears can burn one's heart
But that's a thing that I found out
Too late I guess, Cause I'm in a mess

My faith has gone 
Why lead me on this way?
I thought there'd be no price on love
But I had to pay.

If I could perform one miracle
I'd revive your thoughts of me
Yet I know that it's hopeless
You could never really care.
That's why I despair!

Someday you'll learn
The flame in my heart, Dear,
Forever will burn!",Yardbird Suite,2016

Making of my days.

Counting up the ways
Happiness is lazy.

If you can't put the words to the tune,

Travellers in a storm,

I was hearing, hearing your voice
And the things that you said
Well, they left me, left me no choice

And you told me we had the power
And you told me this was the hour
That you don't know how
If I could show you now

Well I dreamed last night
You were calling, calling my name
You were locked inside of you secrets
Calling my name

And you told me, lost, was the key
And you told me, how you long to be free
That you don't know how
Oh, let me show you now

Like a bird on a far distant mountain
Like a ship on an uncharted sea
You are lost in the arms, that have found you

Don't be afraid
Love's plans are made
Oh, don't be afraid

If there's a time and a place to begin love
It must be now
Let it go, set it free

Oh, I dreamed last night
I was hearing, hearing your voice
Why did you say those things
That have left me, left me no choice?

When you told me, we had the power
Why did you tell me, now, was the hour
But you don't know how
Oh, let me show you now

Like a bird on a far distant mountain
Like a ship on an uncharted sea
You are lost in the arms that have found you

Oh, don't be afraid

Don't be afraid

If you could cast a little light on someone

And lonely is the night

I knew from the silence
That something was wrong
Turning I realised
I wanted to cry

And who will be your guide
And which way will you turn

'cause I never told you
No you'll never really know

And in secret doorways
Were love's hiding places
With nowhere to go
Goodbye
To the fields and byways

I don't want to leave
'cause you, were all, there was to know
About me

On this crazy island
A familiar stranger
Sleeps so far away
Wonder in the eyes of children
And the smile of fortune
Helps the memory fade

Feels good, rockin' my life away
I'm movin' and groovin' and I'm havin' fun night and day

Streamline, fleet line, military brat
I got the general's daughter, taught her where it was at
I'm rockin', rockin' my life away
I'm movin' and groovin' and I'm havin' fun night and day

I know a gal from Texas, she chilli pepper hot
She knows hot to reel it and knows how to rock
I'm rockin', rockin' my life away
I'm movin' and groovin', havin' fun night and day

You know, I like to party and I like to have fun
I'd like to kill her, I've got-a rock on
C'mon, rockin' my life away
Movin' and groovin', I'm havin' fun night and day

How about you girl?

You know, I like some long and I like some lean
I like the way that you shake that thing
I'm rockin', rockin' my life away
I'm movin' and groovin', I'm havin' fun night and day

I gotta have it one more time girl

John Longhurst,"It's a grand night for singing,
The moon is flying high, 
And somewhere a bird 
Who is bound he'll be heard 
Is throwing his heart at the sky! 

It's a grand night for singing,
The stars are bright above.
The earth is a-glow
And to add to the show,
I think I am falling in love! 
Falling, falling in love. 

[Chorus]
It's a grand night for singing,
The moon is flying high,
And somewhere a bird
Who is bound he'll be heard,
Is throwing his heart at the sky!

Maybe it's more than the moon,
Maybe it's more than the birds,
Maybe it's more than sight of the night,
In a light too lovely for words. 

Maybe it's more than the earth
Shiny in silvery blue.
Maybe the reason I'm feeling this way
Has something to do with you! 

[Chorus]

It's a grand night for singing,
The stars are bright above.
The earth is a-glow
And, to add to the show
I think I am falling in love! 
Falling, falling in love! 

Margie and Pat:
It's a grand night for singing,
The moon is flying high,
And somewhere a bird 
Who is bound he'll be heard,
Is throwing his heart at the sky!

John Lord Fonda,"This is my life
Its not what it was before
All these feelings I've shared
And these are my dreams
That I'd never lived before
Somebody shake me
'cause I 
I must be sleeping

[Chorus]
Now that we're here,
It's so far away
All the struggle we thought was in vain
All in the mistakes,
One life contained
They all finally start to go away
Now that we're here its so far away
And I feel like I can face the day I can forgive
And I'm not ashamed to be the person that I am today

These are my words
That I've never said before
I think I'm doing OK
And this is the smile 
That I've never shown before

Somebody shake me 'cause I
I must be sleeping

Please don't shake me
Afraid of waking
Please don't shake me",So Far Away,2006
John Lunn,"I'll count the days till I am yours
I'll save your notes from distant shores
I'll count the days hoping they'll fly
I'll spend the nights staring at the sky

Time stands still now
The world's stopped spinning
Nothing's ended or beginning

I'll count the days till, till I hold you
My heart won't rest until I do
I'll count the days till they are through
Then I'll count the years of loving you
So many years of loving you
So many years of loving you

John Lydon,"World Destruction
Speak about destruction. (x3)
This is a world destruction, your life ain't nothing.
The human race is becoming a disgrace.
Countries are fighting with chemical warfare.
Not giving a damn about the people who live.
Nostradamus predicts the coming of the Antichrist.
Hey, look out, the third world nations are on the rise.
The Democratic-Communist Relationship,
Won't stand in the way of the Islamic force.
The CIA is looking for other detectives.
The KGB is smarter than you think.
Brainwash mentalities to control the system.
Using TV and movies - religions of course.
Yes, the world is headed for destruction.
Is it a nuclear war?
What are you asking for?
This is a world destruction. Your life ain't nothing.
The human race is becoming a disgrace.
The rich get richer.
The poor are getting poorer.
Fascist, chauvinistic government fools.
People, Moslems, Christians and Hindus.
Are in a time zone just searching for the truth.
Who are you to think you're a superior race?
Facing forth your everlasting doom.
We are Time Zone. We've come to drop a bomb on you.
World destruction, kaboom, kaboom, kaboom!
Iæ?¦ going out of my mind that makes two of us-Iæ?¦ going out of my mind
This is the world destruction, your life ain't nothing.
The human race is becoming a disgrace.
Nationalities are fighting with each other.
Why is this? Because the system tells you.
Putting people in faceless categories.
Knowledge isn't what it used to be.
Military tactics to control a nation.
Who wants to be a president or king? Me!
Mother Nature is gonna work against you.
Nothing in your power that you can do.
Yes, the world is headed for destruction.
You and I know it, the Bible tells you.
If we don't start to look for a better life,
The world will be destroyed in a time zone!
Iæ?¦ in a time zone (x3) Speak about destruction (x1) Iæ?¦ in a time zone (x3)

A one way journey, everybody died
It's not unusual, many go that way

But what can I do but hope you're still alive
This is what happens when opposites collide
Public, and private, arbitrary death
'Cause war is power and power is business

We are but numbers, statistics on a sheet
This is what happens whenever humans meet
No need for fingers, we know who to blame
Intolerance will end and start this game

I write this letter while taken for a ride
Maybe I'll see you on the other side
Let's hope it's not a grave
Two fingers crossed, hope it's not a grave

John Maclean,"I think I cracked my skull on the way down 
I think I lost my head when I lay down 
The fear of facts presented in the cold light of day 

I say the time has come for decision 
Better steer my boat for a reason 
Lost the way I went over horizon 
She went out of sight 
The girl lost me a lifetime 

Sometimes I feel, ['m washed up under] 
Sometimes I feel, [I'm washed up under]

Lost on the way I went over horizon

Scarlet ribbons for my hair.""

And all the streets were dark and bare. 
In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair.

And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons.

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

Satisfied her hunger was
Billows calmed on raging seas
For the souls of men she craved

Turned their head in disbelief

Disfigured and disdained

On Sunday a king
Laid down in grief
But woke with the keys
Of hell on that day
First born of the slain
The man Jesus Christ laid
Death in his grave

So three days in darkness slept
The morning sun of righteousness
But rose to shame the throes of death
And overturn his rule
Now daughters and the sons of men
Would pay not their dues again
The debt of blood they owed was rent
When the day rolled anew

On Friday a thief
On Sunday a king
Laid down in grief
But woke holding keys
To hell on that day
The first born of the slain
The man Jesus Christ laid
Death in his grave

On Friday a thief
On Sunday a king
Laid down in grief
But woke with the keys
Of hell on that day
First born of the slain
The man Jesus Christ laid
Death in his grave

And seated us above the fall
In desperate places he paid our wages

Track me in my sleep

John Mark Nelson,"So complete and so breathe deeply for the life in which you wake
Grateful heart and helpless mind that reels with every chance you take
Dreams never take me far away, hide me from your love
Wake to call your name
And when you slow down you'll surely say

I know blowing in the wind there's a voice that calls my name
""Don't fear your life boy, grow and change”
It came running through the Earth where
The pine and tall grass grew
Leading me always, close to you

In the clearness of the spring, heard you calling heard you sing
""This marks the end of all that's through, I have a better plan for you”
Still, I'm afraid of what I am, save me from my soul
You can't make me whole
Still I find my voice and say

I know blowing in the wind there's a voice that calls my name
""Don't fear your life boy, grow and change”
It came running through the Earth where
The pine and tall grass grew
Leading me always, close to you

For a hundred years we wait, and with every breath we take
Learn to bury our mistake
Do I lead myself towards pain?
Every song we raise in vain, every fire only flame
Raise the children now to keep, every virtue that you seek
Hoping one day they'll receive
""We are nothing but the dust that gathers down below the plain
We'll be gone and you'll remain""

Now what was far away draws near, teach me to belong
I know longer fear

I know blowing in the wind there's a voice that calls my name
""Don't fear your life boy, grow and change""

The pine and tall grass grew
Leading me always, close to you",Boy,2014

The night we met 
That night we sat 
Entwined 
Under summer skies 
I looked into your eyes 
You looked into mine 
You said ""you're not like the rest"" 
And I nodded 
""No one understands me"" 
you said 
And I nodded once again, 
As if to agree that all men are indeed the same 

Somehow, you said, I was different 
For months on end I maintained 
A veneer of sincere interest 
As if I were listening 
As you re-lived every page 
Of self help and new age that you had read 
And 
I went in for the kill 
I'd read the same books 
I learned to ape the motions of a 'sensitive' human being 

And we were 'oh so happy' 
But you found things to fix 
And I knew it was time 
To move on 
So now you have me completely figured out 
You feel sorry for me 
I can't express my feelings 
I can't tell the truth 
We are all alike 
At puberty I was sworn to secrecy 
By the international brotherhood 
Of lying fickle males 
I can't tell you anything 
And 
I can't commit 
You're right 
I can't commit, to you 

I will always cherish our time together 
I don't feel enough of anything

Pulled my foot from my mouth, answer back the things i've said. 
Wander through the valley of the shadow of the dead

I never count the gloomy hours I let them slip away. And I realize I'm away.

Tell me why I'm not dead with them in the valley down below.

I never count the gloomy hours I let them slip away. And I realize I'm away.

John Martyn,"This tune was composed by Spencer the Rover
As valiant a man as ever left home
And he had been much reduced
Which caused great confusion
And that was the reason he started to roam

In Yorkshire near Rotherham, he had been on the ramble
Weary of traveling, he sat down to rest
By the foot of yon' mountain
Lays a clear flowing fountain
With bread and cold water he himself did refresh

With the night fast approaching, to the woods he resorted
With woodbine and ivy his bed for to make
But he dreamt about sighing
Lamenting and crying
Go home to your family and rambling forsake

'Twas the fifth day of November, I've reason to remember
When first he arrived home to his family and friends
And they did stand so astounded
Surprised and dumbfounded
To see such a stranger once more in their sight

And his children come around him with their prittle prattling stories
With their prittle prattling stories to drive care away
And he's as happy as those
As have thousands of riches
Contented he'll remain and not ramble away

As valiant a man as ever left home
And he had been much reduced
And caused great confusion
And that was the reason he started to roam

I'm screamin' ya name from a mountain in hell
I'm so low that the grounds above me
It seems as if no one cares to love me
Maybe I'm crazy, addicted to pain
Maybe the cocaine destroyed my brain
Private conversations with kurt cobain
I'm drownin' my fears in the acid rain

chorus
Demonic intentions take ova your mind
Like leaping from a building for the 50th time
Stay away from drugs little boys and girls
Unless you wanna live in the under world

(the under world the under world unless you wanna live in the under world x2)

the sun goes down as the darkness prevails
Loss of conversation with jazabell
She's so high always treatin' her nose
Her blood run black when her cycle flows
Maybe I'm psych'd out for layin' her down
Knowin' she done been wit every man in town
Maybe I'm hellbound for living insane
I'm drowning my pain in the acid rain

chorus:
Demonic intentions take ova your mind
Like leaping from a building for the 50th time
Stay away from drugs little boys and girls
Unless you wanna live in the under world x2
(the under world the under world unless you wanna live in the under world x2)

All of the heartaches and all of the pain
All of the tear drops from acid rain
There's one drop gone 'cause they think I'm insane
Its all in my mind with the use of cocaine
Like drinkin prefusily and flying a plane
So intoxicated I can't stay in my lane
Private conversations with kurt cobain
Drownin' my fears in the acid rain

The lonely game you're playing
Will haunt you once again.

So don't believe you're always on your own;
Your love will surely bring you home.

At patterns in the rain.

And know it's there to wash away the pain.
It's easy when your loved to start again.
It's easy when you're loved..

For cutting them all down

Every time, look at each wrinkle

Sure as clock, sure is fine

Write sometimes 'til the chicks noodles
I got screws loose
I pull words out the air like blue tooth

I'm a sandwich short of a picnic
Ignorant thoughts come across
You've sworn that I written this but I didn't
So maybe it's good to be crazy

3000 times last night

I was all right outside, but inside I had to cry.

Low today and high tomorrow, I see that it's real
One man's meat's another man's sorrow, do you know how
it feels
To be dead drunk on the floor
To get up and ask for more?
To be lying in the dark crying.

If I can't be a peaceful man, I will be who I can
If I can't get everything I want, I'll just get what I
can
I was alright before I walked out the door
I was alright inside

But outside I had to look again, again, again

A love
Love again
A love supreme, divine

John Martyn,"Cain slew Abel,
Seth, he knew not why. 
For, if the children of Israel were supposed to multiply,
Why must any children die? 
So he asked the L-rd.

And the L-rd said: 
""Man means nothing, 
He means even less to me 
Than the lonliest cactus flower 
Or the homeless yucca tree. 
He chases round the desert hah! 
Chasing after me ('cause he thinks he might find me there).
L-rd, that's why I love mankind
(He's so stupid).

I recoil in horror from the fondness of thee, 
From the squalor and the filth; all your misery 
Oh, how we laugh up here in Heaven 
At the praise you offer me. 
That is why i just love mankind hah!"" 

The Christians and the Jews, 
They had a great, big jamboree. 
The Buddhists and the Hindus 
Joined in on satellite TV.
They picked the four greatest priests 
They began to speak.

They said:
""Plague is on the world 
L-rd, no man is free. 
The temples that we've built to you, 
They just tumbled to the sea;
L-rd, if you won't take care of us, 
Please let us be!"" 

And the L-rd said
The L-ord said:

""I burn down your cities:
How blind you must be;
I take away your children:
You say how blessed are thee; 
Y'all must be crazy, now, men, 
To put your faith in a man like me:

And handed him the poisoned drink.

Keeping to God's own laws.

May you never lose your temper
If you get hit in a bar room fight
May you never lose your woman over night

May you never lay your head down
Without a hand to hold
May you never make your bed out in the cold

Please won't you please, please won't you bear it in mind

Won't you please won't you bear it in mind for me

And I look at you there's nothing more to say, it's too bad I love you

But I'm never gonna give it up

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past

And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Put your eyes on the prize, hitting switches
And getting bitches with plenty riches
And if you bang homie, do that
But when your ass gets slapped with that 25, handle that
And all you see is the glamor and gold
Don't know the other side of the game is where it's scandalous and cold

Bangs with me, nigga let me swang with you
Hop in this cut dog, and split this game to ya
I see them niggas that got ya tatted and called it paddering
A clutch and a glock, banging on niggas at the bus stop
Putting in work, leave you broke, cloke white shirt
Doing dirt trying to gain strikes for the turf
Loc, what up, shit I knew your brother
You used to bang with him, when you was a little motherfucker
Until they amputated both of my legs, circled the block
Caught your brother slippin' and flippin' the lead

And just start division, fool listen

You can either hit the jackpot
Stack a not and get a calf shot

Don't get pumped up to dump and get cracked

It's not the same as it used to be
And it's not too late to realise our mistake
We're just not right for each other

Love has slipped away left us only friends
We almost seem like strangers
All that's left between us are the memories we shared
Of times we thought we cared for each other

There's nothing left to do but go our separate ways
And pick up all the pieces left behind us
And maybe someday, somewhere along the way
Another love will find us

Some day when she's older, maybe she will understand
Why her mom and dad are not together
The tears that she will cry when I have to say goodbye
Will tear at my heart forever

Don'tcare that we stand and see
As we pass by their bars to the next attraction
The horses the birds in their cages
Such a shame thay can't be free

And at night there's always a meal and a show

I crawled out of this wilderness, a debt I had to pay
I must have tipped the scales somewhere way back

So now I travel backwards, looking for a man of stone

A foggy night, a neon light I've seen him standing there
Movin' where the shadows creep, no he never did play fair
And one night I almost got him, but I knew you'd tapped my phone
And communication is dangerous, lookin' for a man of stone

With Juan in Argentina I thought I saw him in the street
In a seaplane over Hydra he sat in the captain's seat
And I've chased him from the Colosseum down the Spanish steps in Rome
And history just gets hazy, lookin' for a man of stone

In the mornin' out your I saw him leanin' on a tree
Wearin' a snappy suit of grey and then he motioned to me
He pointed with his finger, as if to say my soul he owned
But I had sold that long ago to you, lookin' for a man of stone

Now I sit in this burnt out barn they call The Raven's Nest
Drinkin' Bloody Monkeys 7, your name tattooed on my chest

And sometimes I don't think of anything but lookin' for
(That's right)

John Mayall,"When I was a boy of eleven years I never saw my pa
Never understood what divorces were I hadn't grown that far
Loading our belongings on a little horse and cart
Mama said that she and daddy were now apart

These are the things I still remember from so long ago

Going to the seaside once a year, castles in the sand
Going to the fairground with my pennies counted in my hand
Going to the circus crying if I saw a clown
Walking on my six foot stilts and never falling down

These are the things I still remember from so long ago

Yelling at my brother, he's in hiding, won't play in the snow
Everything I do he just won't follow, doesn't want to go
Playing in the fields pretending I'm a Buccaneer
Threw a sword, accidentally hit him in the ear

These are the things I still remember from so long ago

Playing up the garden always building huts of turf and mud
Playing in the woods when an owl attacked me, mopped away the blood
Blowing up a rubber boat and patching up the holes
Falling in the water, dripping wet and catching colds

These are the things I still remember from so long ago

I crawled out of this wilderness, a debt I had to pay
I must have tipped the scales somewhere way back

So now I travel backwards, looking for a man of stone

A foggy night, a neon light I've seen him standing there
Movin' where the shadows creep, no he never did play fair
And one night I almost got him, but I knew you'd tapped my phone
And communication is dangerous, lookin' for a man of stone

With Juan in Argentina I thought I saw him in the street
In a seaplane over Hydra he sat in the captain's seat
And I've chased him from the Colosseum down the Spanish steps in Rome
And history just gets hazy, lookin' for a man of stone

In the mornin' out your I saw him leanin' on a tree
Wearin' a snappy suit of grey and then he motioned to me
He pointed with his finger, as if to say my soul he owned
But I had sold that long ago to you, lookin' for a man of stone

Now I sit in this burnt out barn they call The Raven's Nest
Drinkin' Bloody Monkeys 7, your name tattooed on my chest

Left us a magic we can all share

There's a lonely girl who's now fifteen
Since I've been gone
She's kept a part of me and something seen
Remembering

I took her home
We rode a car through rushing trees
The moon and night
It seemed so wrong to say goodbye
Things unsaid, it wasn't right

She's sneaking out her back window
I'm waiting in Saw Mill Gulch Road
She couldn't see me ride away

Lots of things for memories

Of the feelings that I have

She went back to the hills with the party
She was falling, helpless and stoned
Followed her through the night of the desert
And I waited till she slept alone

John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers,"The real me is a southern girl with her Levis on and an open heart
Wish I could say the save the world, like I was super girl
The real me is to laugh all night lying in the grass just talking about love
But lately I've been jaded life got so complicated

I'm still thinking about it almost forgot what it was like
Do you know what it feels like?
'Cause with you
I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground
With nothing but a T-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby as I do now
Now that I'm with you
With you
Now that I'm with you

You speak and it's like a song
And just like that all my walls come down
It's like a private joke just meant for us to know
I relate to you naturally
Everybody else just fades away
Sometimes it's hard to breathe
Just knowing you found me
'Cause I'm still thinking about it almost forgot what it was like
Do you know what it feels like?
'Cause with you
I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground
With nothing but a T-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby as I do now
Now that I'm with you
With you

Come and take me
Love you save me
Like nobody else
Now I can be myself
With you

With you
I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground
With nothing but a T-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful

She was working undercover
Oh the woman knew all of the moves
She really had me rompin'
We were barefoot stompin'
She just kept igniting my fuse

I was blinded by the blackness
Of her long silk stockings
She was rocking with an optical illusion
This ain't how I'd thought it'd be
She just kept on keeping me
In a total state of confusion

She took me for a ride
Rattled me down to my shoes
And I found out
She was an undercover agent for the blues

She never really needed love
Omnidirectional
I was just an innocent bystander
She kept on getting kinkier

Played the blues in Denmark, but women there they was way too old

Couldn't find a chitlin Pizza, at any price I pay
