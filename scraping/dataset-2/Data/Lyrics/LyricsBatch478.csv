John Dahlbäck,"Blue road, half a mile
Distant wing of your missin' smile
Long journey, is that all I can get?
Blue road, half a mile
Hear me out for a little while,
Flash in the eye, I can't forget

Little more, little more, little more, little more lovin'
Little more, little more, little more, little more lovin'
Give me a little more, little more, little more, little more lovin'
Little more, little more, little more, little more lovin'

Little more lovin'

Blue road, almost mine
Waved goodbye now a faded line,
This memory, isn't all that I get?
Tell me, I'm fine
Echoing through a clouded mind
Please wake me up, so I won't forget

Little more, little more, little more, little more lovin'
Little more, little more, little more, little more lovin'
Give me a little more, little more, little more, little more lovin'
Little more, little more, little more, little more lovin'

Little more lovin'
Little more lovin'",A  Little More,2015

The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan,1989
John Dankworth,"Ooh

Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,
God of love, please look down and see my people through.

Do unto others as you would have them do to you.

And have a brighter by and by.

A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies

John Dankworth,"Music is playing inside my head
Over and over and over again
My friend, there's no end to the music...
Ah, summer is over
But the music keeps playing
And won't let the cold get me down
Pictures are forming inside my brain
Soon with the colors they'll rain together and grow
Then don't you know, don't you know there'll be music...
Ah, it's not always easy
But the music keeps playing
And won't let the world get me down.

John Dankworth,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me.

Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be.

Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me,

Cause loving you I've been awaken
The earth starts quaking
I'm blown away I'm overtaken
By the miracle, the miracle of you

John David Webster,"Star of wonder, star of might
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light

From the beginning the Father
Had a magnificent plan
Revealed through the law and the prophets
To fulfill the redemption of man

You spoke after centuries of silence
In the midst of a still, starry night
And Emmanuel came down among us
And the Father said, 'Let there be light'

Let there be light, let it shine bright
Piercing the darkness with dazzling white
Hope for the hopeless was born on that night
When God sent His Son and said, 'Let there be light'
Let there be light

People who walked in great darkness
Gathered from near and afar
Shepherds with flocks in their keeping
Three kings who follow a star

Together the poor and the richest
Witness that Bethlehem night
And the sky full of Angels announcing
The birth of a glorious light

Let there be light, let it shine bright
Piercing the darkness with dazzling white
Hope for the hopeless was born on that night
When God sent His Son and said, 'Let there be light'
Let there be light

We who are His have this calling
To praise Him and make His name known
So one day the presence of Jesus
Shines in every heart and every home
(Shines in our home)
(Star of wonder, star of beauty bright)

Let there be light, let it shine bright
Piercing the darkness with dazzling white
Hope for the hopeless was born on that night
When God sent His Son and said, 'Let there be light'
Let there be light

Let there be light, let it shine bright
Piercing the darkness with dazzling white
Hope for the hopeless was born on that night
When God sent His Son and said, 'Let there be light'
Let there be light",Let There Be Light,2005

I'll be tired of you  when stars are tired of gleaming
When I am tired of dreaming, then I'll be tired of  you.

When grass is tired of growing, then I'll be tired  of you.

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

John Davis,"I've seen a thousand people kneel in silence
And I've seen them face the rifles with their songs
I always thought that we could end the killing
But now I live in fear that I was wrong

The killer and the cynic waltz together
Their eyes are turned into their skulls
They do not feel the bullets in the bodies
They do not hear the dolphins or the gulls

If we do these things in the greenwood,
What will happen in the dry?

If we don't stop there'll come a time when women
With barren wombs will bitterly rejoice
With breasts that dry and never fill with promise
Gladly they'll not suckle one more life

Is this then the whimper and the ending?
The impotence of people raised on fear,
A fear that blinds the sense of common oneness
Common love and life or death are here

If we do these things in the greenwood,
What will happen in the dry?

Will no one light the candle in the darkness
Will no one be my guide, not let me fall
I've lost the sense that tells me where the path is
I feel the chill of winter in my soul

There's no way I can say the words more plainly
There's no one left to point at anymore
It's you and me and we must make the choice now
And not destroy the life we're living for

John Davis,"I want to share these words with you
Don't turn away
It's you I'm singing for
I'm blinded by the things you do
The things you say
I wanted so much more
And when I say these words to you
In honesty
Oh will you understand
You don't know what I'm going through
So promise me
You'll let go off my hand

You mean so very much to me
Your every touch
A vampire's gentle kissSurrendering so helplessly
So good - too much
The moments I will miss
So now I have to say goodbye
So torn apart
And black is all I see
To stay would mean I'd surely die
A broken heart
Your love is killing me

It's tearing me apart - your love
It's tearing at my heart - your love
It's tearing me apart - your love
It's killing me
and tearing deep into my heart - your love
Tearing me apart - your love
It's tearing at my heart - your love
Oh your love, your love, your love is tearing me apart

The ghost of love is haunting me
It's her I fear
Her poison is so sweet
The flame of love is burning me
For you so dear
Oh God I feel so weak
I'll love you 'till the day I die
Forget me not

And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low

How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight

Trailing the rails, I'm a roamin' the seas.

And when I'm weary, mother nature makes me a bed. 
I'm just goin' along as I please, 
Breezin' along with the breeze.

(I don't recognise it) I don't recognise it
(I don't recognise it) I don't recognise it

Eccomi, su di un letto, mi radono il petto
Mi mettono gli elettrodi, iniettano gettiti
Sotto cute, loro sotto tute tipo Chernobyl
Danno vari comandi, mani con aghi colanti
Calmanti che inalo, tutti davanti qui, Halo
Più sangue che ad Halloween, i battiti in calo
Le lastre coi raggi X, di parti di cranio
Raccolta d'urina come gli addetti in autogrill
Accende indicatori, pulsioni sul led
Le bende, i tamponi, convulsioni, Tourette
Prelievo campioni tipo Rhythm Roulette
Già vedo dottori sulla mia silhouette
E fitta, che vomito
Zig zag nel monitor
Bisturi sull'omero
Oh, oh, omicron

John de Leo,"Rullino i tambur nuovi calembour
Dischi e ancora tour, Whisky, Troubadour
In hotel frutta in più nella nuova DUS
Non ho figli col grembiule nello scuolabus
Quando ascolto i miei coetanei sembrano più grandi
È il vissuto che fa l'età non i compleanni
Io che mi comporto ancora come i loro pargoli
Tra le mani gli album e non riesco a completarli
Qualcosa sta bloccando l'ingranaggio
""Siccome immobile"" sto sul palco del 5 Maggio
Cantavo per fuggire dal mondo in un solo slancio
Ora che cantare è il mio mondo ne sono ostaggio
Non sono più lo stesso di un secondo fa
Nel mio caso, fidati, pure un secondo fa
Al mattino la mia voce roca brontola
Dice ""mettici una croce sopra"", Golgota

And if you call my name

If I look at my face

Ma quale tribuno del popolo
Mi viene sonno dormo più a lungo di Totoro
Fuori salta tutto in aria con le molotov
Mentre sul divano accorcio il divario con Oblomov
Annoiarmi come fanno gli altri in fondo è meglio
Passo gli anni come Mastroianni in ""8 e 1/2""
Scrivo, va bene
Rileggo, non va bene, esco
Vita breve, tipo ""di Adele"" senza le scene lesbo
Attaccato alla penna come la stampa al cronista
Le parole crociate come santa conquista
Da stacanovista a ""staccanovista"" perché stacco spesso
E quando scrivo un pezzo qua stappano Crystal
Tanto per quanta fama ricevi
Avrà sempre più paganti la fontana di Trevi
Non ha senso recitare la parte degli incompresi
Con tutti dalla mia parte, con tutti così cortesi

Non mi riconosco più, prosopagnosia
Sto cantando ma il mio volto non è divertito
Quasi non capisco più quale brano sia
Ogni volta mi riascolto e sono risentito
Un video di chirurgia ricorda a me stesso
Che può essere sgradevole guardarsi dentro
Fino a diventare oggetto del proprio disprezzo
E dire ""Sono io sputato quello nello specchio!""
E non aspetto altro (e non aspetto altro)
Che avere un altro aspetto
A sorpresa vengono fuori come un terno secco
Bollori che tengo dentro come un termos, ecco
Si tratta ancora di me ma non è lo stesso
Di riposo non ce n'è, qua non è l'ostello
Faccio un ulteriore passo, non dello Stelvio
Via da questo umore basso, livello sterco

Why do you try to resist
Every time I insist

Every time you bring me up
You bring me down
It really breaks my heart

John DeFaria,"Mesmerizing point of view, hypnotic conversations
Contemplative swinging moods, drew me to you
Never mattered when or where, who you'd been with
The color of your hair, baby, I always cared

But you couldn't see inside of me
You didn't notice my intentions
Nothing but dreams is all that I carry, oh
Is all that I carry with me

Cynical attitudes, the center of attention
I wonder if you understood you could've changed my life
Focusing my energy, setting expectations
Trying to convince myself, she loves me

A little look here, a little smile there
Moments and memories that we've shared
Roses and things, silly it seems is all that I carry
Dreams that I carry, dreams that I carry with me
Dreams that I carry, dreams that I carry with me

We had no chance, never made plans
So many things slipped through our hands
Don't wanna look back, too late to look back
I gotta get her off my mind

I got no more dreams, it's over for me
Our dreams all I carry, dreams that I carry
Dreams that I carry, dreams that I carry with me
Dreams that I carry, carry, yeah
Dreams that I carry, dreams that I carry with me, baby
Dreams that I carry

John DeFaria,"I love you
It'll never be the same
Not this way again
With someone new

But someone new
Will just have to do
'Cause you never loved me at all
You told me yourself

Why'd you stay with me, baby?
You'd let me take the chance
Left me making plans

For nobody, nobody
You said you were waiting
For your heart to fall in love
But you never loved me at all
I was just your friend that's all

But they say, time heals all wounds
I guess you made up your mind, baby
Time heals all wounds
And I hope the time can heal my heart
Heal my broken heart

'Cause I loved you and I was true
You know I've been carrying a failure's cross
I did everything to win your heart
But you never loved me at all
I was just your friend that's all

And they say, time heals all wounds
And I guess you made up your mind, baby
Time heals all wounds
And I hope the time can heal my heart

And what of the nights
When you looked in my eyes
And you told me, you loved me?

You made me feel in my heart
It was real not a spark
But a flame burning inside
Who can put out this fire inside?

Time heals all wounds
And I guess you made up your mind, baby
Time heals all wounds
And I hope the time can heal

Time heals all wounds
Time heals all wounds
And I hope the time can heal my heart
Time heals all wounds

Time heals all wounds
Time heals all wounds
Time heals

John Defereri,"I know you're the wayward kind
The way you always drag behind
Show me a horse and I'll feed it hay
Show me the cart and I'll throw it away
Prettiest face I've ever seen
It looked like something in a magazine
To a blind man it's plain to see
That I need you and you need me

I've got cold feet, it's a-crazy chasin'
When things get serious, time is a-wastin'
I'd cross my fingers but they don't seem to meet
There's no need to tell me that I've got cold feet, a-ha-ha

Took me home to tell your dad
That you were the best girl I've ever had
I stayed for dinner, I couldn't refuse
I spilt the tea and I ate the news
Ah, you must think you're really neat
Got me tied down to my seat
I can't move, it's hard to think
With cramp in my eyelids and I can't blink

Well, I've got cold feet, it's a-crazy chasin'
Things get serious, time is a-wastin'

Everybody knew it was bound to be a hoot
What can you do when nothing else is cooking
Make your own amusement, bring a pile of loot

There was Alice the butcher, Tidy and Gunn
Who couldn't see where they were heading
It was sixteen days and sixteen nights,
And it weren't even nobody's wedding

What a great reception, all the people cried
Who stole the groom and who stole the bride
How did the countess slide underneath the door
Why is the wild boy chopping up the floor?

John Defereri,"I'm Darby the tinker and my brother is Tam
We go where the work is, my boys, and we work where we can
With the mending and fixing, it's together we stay
Intending our fortunes to try on the old changing way
We come to your cities and we call on your wives
We'll fix up your kettles, please dear missus, we'll sharpen your knives
And we always agreed that together we'd stay
Intending our fortunes to try on the old changing way
At times they grew scanty and the money grew thin
We worked for a song but the money it didn't come in
Now brothers are kindred but hard times betray
And so we stumbled apart on the old changing way
We never agreed to divide our tin
And when you're out of love with your brother, your hard times begin
For the spikes and the brothels, they're shameful to see
But don't you travel alone, boys, this warning you take from me
You must share with your nearest till the end of your days
Or else it's forever you're on the old changing way
",The Old Changing Way,1972
John Defereri,"It's a grey, grey morning, the rain it do fall
I'm feeling hungry and low
My bed's so empty, how I wish I could call
On the painted ladies I know
When you've got no credit, don't hold no sway
With the painted ladies I know
It's a ''thank you for nothing, we'll see you someday''
The painted ladies I know

Leave at home what you value enough
And laugh all your senses away
When you want to love everyone, how can you love
The painted ladies all say
Those film stars and beauties will please you tonight
If you go to bed with a book
But they can't hold a candle to something that trembles
If you need to do more than look

They come from rich fathers and twinkle their eyes
And you're begging them please not to go
When you're starved for some loving, they can make you feel special
The painted ladies I know
If you're seeking fortune, if you're seeking fame
And you're looking yourself in the eye
And God help the children, playing their game
The end of the game is goodbye

They pass through your vision like thoughts in a dream
Your good times are slipping away
It's time to move on or go down with the ship
The painted ladies all say
",Painted Ladies,1972
John Defereri,"Was there ever a winter so cold and so sad
The river too weary to flood
The storming wind cut through to my skin
But she cut through to my blood

I was looking for trouble to tangle my line
But trouble came looking for me
I knew I was standing on treacherous ground
I was sinking too fast to run free

With her scheming, idle ways
She left me poor enough
The storming wind cut through to my skin
But she cut through to my blood

I would not be asking, I would not be seen
A-beggin' on mountain or hill
But I'm ready and blind with my hands tied behind
I've neither a mind nor a will

With her scheming, idle ways
She left me poor enough
The storming wind cut through to my skin
But she cut through to my blood

He'll always believe what they say
They tell him it's hard to be honest and true
Does he mind if he doesn't get paid?

Where the rain came through

'Cause she doesn't have a dress
Without a patch for the party to go

Because she's living in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of a family man
Daddy's goin' to buy you a dream to cling to
Mommy's gonna love you just as much as she can
And she can

It's a good thing you don't have bus fare
It would fall through the hole in your pocket
And you'd lose it in the snow on the ground
Walkin' to town to find a job

Tryin' to keep your hands warm
But the hole in your shoe lets the snow come through
And it chills to the bone
Boy, you better go home where it's warm

And you can live in the love of the common people

And the chills stay away
You take them in stride, family pride

You know faith is your foundation
With a whole lot of love and a warm conversation
And many a prayer
Making you strong, where you belong

I don't know what to do
So my little darlin'

You dun stomped on my heart
And you mashed that sucker flat
You just sortta stomped on high aorta

I felt us drum apart
And every step you took
Was a stomp upon my heart

I onty hope that someday you get
Them low down blues

In some smokey honky tonk

You looked down at your shoes
You'll think about that tender heart
That you crushed beneath them soles
With your cold bustin' stompers
You left my head so full of holes

John Denver,"My old man had a rounder's soul.
He'd hear an old freight train.
Then he'd have to go.
Said he'd been blessed with a gipsy bone.

That's the reason they guessed
He'd been cursed to roam.
Came into town back before the war.

Didn't even know what it was
He was looking for.
He carried a tattered bag for his violin.

It was full of lots of songs
Of places that he'd been.
He talked real ea-sy had a smiling way

To pass along to you
When his fiddle played.
Making people drop their cares and woes.

To hum out loud those tunes
That his fiddle howed.
Till the people there began to join that sound.

And everyone in town was laughing.
Singing, dancing round.
Like the fiddler's tune was all they heard that night.

As if some dream said
""All the world is right""
His fiddler's eye caught one beauty there.

She had that rollin' flowin'
golden kind of hair.
He played for her as if she danced alone.

He played his favorite songs.
Ones he called his own.
He played until she was the last to go.

He stopped and packed his case
And said he'd take her home.

All the nights that passed a child was born.
All the years that passed.
That love would keep them warm.
All their lives they'd share a dream come true.

All because she danced
while his fiddle tuned.
My old man had a rounder's soul.

He'd hear an old freight train.
Then he'd have to go.
All that I recall said when I was so young.

No one else could really
Sing those songs he sung.",My Old Man,1969
John Denver,"When I get older, losing my hair, many years from now
Will you still be sending me a Valentine, birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out 'till quarter to three, would you lock the door?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me, when I'm sixty-four?

Hmmmmmmmmh
You'll be older, too
Aaah, and if you say the word, I could stay with you

I could be handy, mending a fuse, when your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside, Sunday mornings, go for a ride
Doing the garden, digging the weeds, who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me, when I'm sixty four?

Every summer we can rent a cottage in the Isle of Wight if it's not to dear
We shall scrimp and save
Ah, grandchildren on your knee, Vera, Chuck, and Dave

Send me a postcard, drop me a line stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say, yours sincerely wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form, mine forever more
Will you still need me, will you still feed me, when I'm sixty four?",When I'm Sixty-Four,1969
John Denver,"It's late December the new years never coming
Time passes slowly in a two room walk up flat
The sun is silent
As a cold rain gonna come on
No one to talk to
But my lady's yellow cat
Rain drops talling on the flowers
In the window box
Plastic roses that I planted yesterday
I didn't think it does too soon
But there all withered now
Seems like everything I touch
Turns out that way

Well I guess I'll just go walking
The cats no good tor talkin'to
He are don't know what I'm saying
And the rain is always
Playing on my mind
On my mind

Street lights driring through the blinds
That cover window panes
Blending soflly with the bare lights over head
Then together
They run swiflly through my memory
And every image of a strange and empty bed",Yellow Cat,1969
John Denver,"I told you that I loved you
 You said that is so good
 I called you my darlin'
 I thought I always would
 But now you've gone and left me
 I don't know what to do
 So my little darlin'
 I write these words to you
 You dun stomped on my heart
 And you mashed that sucker flat
 You just sortta stomped on [(high) s/b my] Aorta
 You started going out with guys
 I felt us [(drum) s/b drift] apart
 And every step you took
 Was a stomp upon my heart
 I only hope that someday you get
 Them low down blues
 In some smokey honky tonk
 You looked down at your shoes
 You'll think about that tender heart
 That you crushed beneath them soles
 With your cold bustin' stompers
 You left my head so full of holes

John Denver,"Today is the first day
Of the rest of my life
I wake as a child
To see the world begin
On monarch queens
And birthday wonderings
Want to put on faces
Walk in the wet and cold
And look forward to my growing old
To grow old is to change
To change is to be new

To be new is to be young again
I barely remember when
My memories are stolen by the moming
Blotted out by the suns hypnotic eye
Today is the first day
Of the rest of my life
I wake as a child
To see the world begin
On monarch queens
And birthday wondenngs
Want to put on faces

John Denver,"In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who sings
Of the dreams that he brings from the wide open sea.
In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who sleeps
While the river bank weeps to the old willow tree.
In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who dies
Full of beer, full of cries in a drunkin' down fight.
But in the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who's born
On a muggy, hot morn by the dawns early light.

In the port of Amsterdam where the sailors all meet
There's a sailor who eats only fish-heads and tails.
He will show you his teeth that have rotted too soon.
That can swallow the moon that can haul up the sails.
And he asks to the cook with his arms open wide.
Bring me more fish, put it down by my side.
And he wants so to belch, but he's too full to try.
So he gets up and he laughs and he zips up his fly.

In the port of Amsterdam you can see sailors dance.
Haunches bursting their pants, binding woman to paunch.
They've forgotten the tune that their whiskey voice croaks.
And they're aplitting the night with the roar of their jokes.
And they turn and they dance and they laugh and they lust.
To the rats it sounds of the accordion burst.
Then it's out into the night with their pride in their pants.
With a slut that they tow underneath the street lamps.

In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who drinks.
And he drinks and he drinks and he drinks once again.
He drinks to the health of the whores of Amsterdam.
Who have promised their love to a thousand other men.
And they darken their bodies and their virtue long gone
For a few dirty coins. And then when he can't go on
He plants his nose in the sky And he wipes it up above
And he splits like I cry for an unfaithful love.
In the port of Amsterdam.
In the port of Amsterdam.
In the port of Amsterdam.

John Denver,"See the sun rise
Open up your eyes
Today is the very first day
Watch the morning come
Now the night is gone
Yesterday is so very far away
Trouble, you get out of my sight
You know I can't look at you when the sun is so bright
You know everything's coming together now
Can't you see

And I live my life in cel-e-bra-tion

And geese in flight and dogs that bite

Still I'm on the dark side of the moon

John Denver,"Oh lay me down in Forest Lawn in a silver casket.
Put golden flowers over my head in a silver basket.
Let the Drum and Bugle Corp blow taps while cannons roar;
Let sixteen liveried employees pass out souvenirs from the funeral store.

I want to go simply when I go.
They'll give me a simple funeral there I know.
With a casket lined in fleece,
And fireworks spelling out â??Rest in Peace,â??
Oh take me when I'm gone to Forest Lawn.

Oh lay me down in Forest Lawn; they understand there.
And they have a heavenly choir and a military band there.
Just put me in their care and I'll find my comfort there,
With sixteen planes in a last salute, dropping across in a parachute.

I want to go simply when I go,
And they'll give me a simple funeral there I know.
With a hundred strolling strings,
And topless dancers with golden wings
Oh take me when I'm gone to Forest Lawn.

Oh, come, come, come, come...
Come to the church in the wild wood,
Kindly leave a contribution in the pail.
Be as simple and as trusting as a child would,
And we'll sell you the church in the dale.

To find a simple resting place is my desire.
To lay me down with a smiling face comes a little bit higher.
My likeness cast in brass, will stand in plastic grass
While weights and hidden springs will tip it's hat to the mourners filing past.

I want to go simply when I go.
They'll give me a simple funeral there I know.
I'll sleep beneath the sand,
With piped-in tapes of Billy Graham.
Oh take me when I'm gone to Forest Lawn.

Rock of ages cleft for me--
Forest a slightly higher fee.

Oh take me when I'm gone to Forest Lawn!

Amen",Forest Lawn,1970
John Denver,"Isabel is waiting
In a room of many shadows
Her eyes like flashing diamonds
Shining brightly from the sea
Her hair in silken tresses
Like a robe around her shoulders
Hiding tantalizing treasures
That the sun has never seen

Isabel is watching
Like a princess from the mountains
For the first soft snows of winter
And the icy winds they bring
With a whisper of her sadness
In the passing of the summer
Her crown is wild red roses
With a lace of forest green

And she wraps her arms around me and she sighs
And she sings to me in silence with her eyes
And her hair upon my pillow comforts me

Isabel is weeping
And her eyes are full of wonder
She knows that it's the time for her
And she cannot understand
She's a mistress of the moonlight
To the stars she is a sister
And the morning now awaits her
To betray her once again

And she whispers as she sadly slips away
Then she smiles because there's nothing left to say
And she takes with her the sadness and the sun",Isabel,1970

The engines are rumbling.
The coffee's all brewed.
Get up Jimmy Newman, there's work to be done.
And why do you lie there still sleeping.
There's a waiting line forming
To use the latrine.
And the sun is just opening the skies.
The breakfast they're serving just has to be seen.
And you've only to open your eyes.

Get up Jimmy Newman my radio's on.
The news is all bad, but it's good for a laugh.
The tent flap is loose and the peg must be gone.
And why do you lie there still sleeping.
The night nurse is gone
And the sexy one's here.
And she tells us such beautiful lies.
Her uniform's tight.
Oh her marvelous rear.
And you've only to open your eyes.

Get up Jimmy Newman you're missing the fun.

They're talking us next, Jim.
It's time to go home.
It's over for us there's no more to be done.
And why do you lie there still sleeping.
It's state side for us, Jim.

I ran away from home
I went to join the circus
Went to see the cotton candy whirl

Someday soon I will return to her

Then I made the big time

I've been a long time looking for rainbows
Trying to find a way to believe tomorrow

There was a time I think when I remember dreaming
There was a reason I can't find it now

In worn out shoes
Silver hair, ragged shirt and baggy pants
The old soft shoe
He jumps so high, jumps so high
Then he'd lightly touch down

I met him in a cell, in New Orleans it was
Down and out
He looked to me to be the eyes of age as he
He spoke right out
He talked about life, talked of life
He laughed, slapped his leg instead

He said the name Bojangles and he danced a lick
Across the cell
He grabbed his pants and took a stance and he jumped so high
He clicked his heels
He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh
Shook his clothes all around
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles dance

He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs
Throughout the South
And he spoken in tears of fifteen years how it's dogging him
They traveled about
The dog up and died he up and died
After twenty years he still grieves

He said I dance now at every chance and honky tonks
For drinks and tips
But most the time I spend behind these county bars
'Cause I drink a bit
He shook his head now, he shook his head
I heard someone ask please

The oceans were blue

Nights there were breezes?

All of my days on the road with no one beside me
All of my dreams of a place that I can call home

Somewhere in the shade near the sound of a sweet singin' river
Somewhere in the sun where the mountains make love to the sky
Somewhere to build me a faith, a farm and a family
Somewhere to grow older, and somewhere a reason to try

Cause I'm tired of big cities and so tired of big city ways
Scratchin' off sunsets, and walkin' around in the maze
Some sweet taxi dancer's tryin' to save me from bein' alone
Ah, it's much worse than lonely, there is no place that I really belong
I want to be home

I'm leavin' tomorrow and all of the old yesterdays
I'm leavin' the trash cans, the bright lights, the telephone lines
I'm leavin' my sorrows and all of my memories behind
To see what I find

Well, she danced around the bar room and she did the hoochy-coo
Yeah she sang her song all night long, tellin' me what to do

Blow up your TV throw away your paper
Go to the country, build you a home
Plant a little garden, eat a lot of peaches
Try an find Jesus on your own

Well, I was young and hungry and about to leave that place
When just as I was leavin', well she looked me in the face
I said ""You must know the answer.""
""She said, ""No but I'll give it a try.""
And to this very day we've been livin' our way
And here is the reason why

We blew up our TV threw away our paper
Went to the country, built us a home
Had a lot of children, fed 'em on peaches
They all found Jesus on their own",Blow Up Your TV (Spanish Pipe Dream),1971
John Denver,"Casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walkin'
Down the stairway to the subway in the shadows down below
Following their footsteps through the neon darkened coridors
Of silent desperation, never speakin' to a soul

The poison air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dyin'
'Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain
But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
Of the clickin' of the turnstile and the rattle of his chains

""Oh"", she said ""Casey it's been so long since I've seen you""
""Here"" she said, ""Just a kiss to make a body smile""
""See"" she said, ""I've put on new stockings just to please you""
""Lord"" she said, ""Casey can you only stay awhile""

Casey leaves the underground and stops inside the Golden Crown
For somethin' wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bones
See'ing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
Who reach for anything they can to keep from going home

Standing in the corner, Casey drinks his pint of bitter,
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by
Then he stumbles as he's leavin' and he wonders if the reason
Is the beer that's in his belly or the tear that's in his eye

""Oh"" she said, ""I suppose you seldom think about me""
""Now"" she said, ""Now that you've a family of your own""
""Still"" she said, ""It's so blessed good to feel your body""
""Lord"" she said, ""Casey, it's a shame to be alone""

John Denver,"Riding on the City of New Orleans
Illinois Central, Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail
All along a southbound odyssey
The train pulls out of Kankakee
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields
Passin' towns that have no name
Freight yards full of old black men
The graveyards of the rusted automobiles

Singing good morning America, how are you?
Saying, don't you know me I'm your native son?
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done
 
Dealing cards with the old men in the club car
Penny a point, ain't no one keeping score
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels a rumbling beneath the floor
 
And the sons of Pullman porters
And the sons of engineers
Ride their fathers' magic carpet made of steel
And mothers with their babes asleep
Rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel
Singing good morning America, how are you?
Saying don't you know me, I'm your native son?
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done

Night time on the City of New Orleans
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee
Halfway home and we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness rolling down to the sea
But all the towns and people seem
To fade into a bad dream
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news
The conductor sings his song again
The passengers will please refrain
This train has got the disappearing railroad blues

John Denver,"Just out of the infantry this morning,
I had to pay my dues across the sea,
But no one back in boot camp ever warned me,
What the readjustment blues would do to me.
""Welcome to Havannah"", said the pilot,
""We must have made a wrong turn on the way.""
""Let's buy some cigars and keep it quiet,
If they don't know we're here we'll get away.""
Just as I had realized he was joking,
I saw we were in Washington D.C.,
'Cause there was all the patriotic buildings.
Just like I had seen them on T.V.
It must have been a holiday,
'cause there was this parade.
People carried signs I couldn't read that they had made.
'Till I got closer and my heart fell to my socks;
There was a battle raging and
The air was filled with teargas and rocks.
There was the flag I'd fought against so often,
The one I fought for hanging upside down,
The wind was blowing hard, the dirt was flying,
It made the city sky look dark and brown.
I saw a girl, she could have been my sister,
Except her hair was long and in her face,
She explained this was a demonstration,
Against the war and for the human race.
Now I've seen a lot of strange things in my travels,
Cannibals, yes, and aliens galore,
But I never thought I'd see so many people
Saying we don't want your + + + war!
The troops all had on uniforms
Just like the one I'd worn,
But they were all domestic and my duty chose war.
They carried guns just like the ones across the sea,
Except this time I was the citizen
And they were pointing their guns at me,
Yes, I was just a citizen and
I was walking down the street,
And it was just then that the Readjustment Blues
Got through to me.

",Readjustment Blues,1971
John Denver,"Well, I wake up late in the afternoon,
I eat my eggs to the evening news,
And the sun's gone down 'fore I find my shoes,
Music fills the air, but it's all the blues.
And she won't let me fly away
She won't let me fly away
Well, we got no heat and the window's broke,
The storm rains came, ev'rything got soaked
And there's no bread left, nothing here to smoke,
Then the Lord looks down sayin',
""Can't you take a joke?
The palm tree's just a picture on a postcard,
The ocean's just a mem'ry in my dream,
Then a man comes a T.V. sellin' soapsuds
To dirty up my rivers and my streams.
Like a myst'ry movie without an end,
When you think it's over, it just begins,
It's not always true that the good guy wins,

John Denver,"Once upon a time in the land of Hushabye
Around about the wondrous days of yore
I came across a sort of box
Bound up with chains and locked with locks
And labeled kindly do not touch; it's war
 
Decree was issued 'round about
All with a flourish and a shout
And a gaily colored mascot tripping lightly on before
Don't fiddle with this deadly box, or break the chains, or pick the locks
And please, don't ever play about with war
 
Well, the children understood
Children happen to be good
They were just as good around the time of yore
They didn't try to pick the locks, or break into that deadly box
They never tried to play about with war
 
Mummies didn't either
Sisters, aunts, grannies neither
Cause they were quiet, and sweet, and pretty in those wondrous days of yore
Well, very much the same as now, not the ones to blame somehow
For opening up that deadly box of war
 
But someone did
Someone battered in the lid
And spilled the insides out across the floor
A sort of bouncy, bumpy ball made up of guns and flags 
And all the tears, and horror, and the death that goes with war
 
It bounced right out
And went bashing all about
And bumping into everything and stored
And what was sad and most unfair is that it didn't seem to care who much it bumped
Or why, or what, or for
 
It bumped the children mainly
And I'll tell you this quite plainly
It bumps them every day, and more and more, and leaves them dead and burned and dying
Thousands of them sick and crying
Cause when it bumps, it's really very sore
 
Now, there's a way to stop the ball
It isn't difficult at all
All it takes is wisdom; I'm absolutely sure that we could get it back into the box
And bind the chains and lock the locks
No one seems to want to save the children any more
 
Well, that's the way it all appears
Cause it's been bouncing 'round for years and years
In spite of all the wisdom since those wondrous days of yore
And the time they came across the box
Bound up with chains and locked with locks
And labeled ""kindly do not touch, it's war""",The Box,1971
John Denver,"The prodigal son, he'd been away awhile
He was workin' his way back home now
Over many a ragged mile
When he finally crossed the river
And his father saw him near

And it made good sense to me
Talkin' 'bout reapin' what you're sowin'

Now we got new names and faces

Though He knew that He had not long to live
He took care of the business
Teaching us how to fly

While others are bought and sold

Sitting in her rocking chair
A dulcimer in her lap
A feather in her hair

With the rhythm of the rocking chair
She was a-sitting and a-singing and a-swaying
Her cheeks were red I declare

Was just her natural skin
She wore no makeup

She was a natural mama with the red cheeks

Well I finally realised
There was hunger in my stare
In my mind I was swaying
With the woman in the rocking chair
But the lady I was living with
Was standing right by my side
She saw my stare and she saw my hunger
And Lord it made her cry
So with anger on her face
Yes and the hurt in her eyes
She scratched me and she clawed me
She screamed and she cried
Oh you don't give me near
All the loving that you should
Yet you're ready to go and lay with her
You're just no damn good¡±

Oh I guess I'm probably wrong

Up in Eastern Wyoming
Another lazy day
Lookin' for the sun

In a droughty old cabin
Outside a whiskey basin
Another shining light
And a good man on the run

There's a lady back in Laramie
And her reason no one else can see
For him to spend
The winter on his own

Nothing much for him to do tomorrow
Just a matter of survival
Another friendly fight
In a life chocked full of fun

It's a special kind of medicine
And all that you can do is win
Though it tastes so sweet
You can refuse

Fill your fountain with moonshine

And the coming of the winter
Fear that is within you now
It seems to never end

You want to be my friend

And you wonder where we're going

To seek the wisdom of the children
And the graceful way of flowers in the wind

Are my sisters and my brothers

And a blessing for today

And the towers fall around us

And it's colder than the sea

It is written from the desert
To the mountains they shall lead us
By the hand and by the heart
They will comfort you and me
In their innocence and trusting
They will teach us to be free

John Denver,"(Lady's Chains)
Jessie went away last summer, a couple of months ago.
After all our time together, it was hard to see her go.
She called me right up when she arrived, asked me one more time to come,
but living on an LA freeway ain't my kind of having fun.
I think I'd rather be a cowboy, I think I'd rather ride the range.
I think I'd rather be a cowboy than to lay me down in love and lady's chains.

When we were just beginning, it was such an easy way.
Laying back up in the mountains making love for sunny days.
She got tired of picking daisies and cooking my meals for me,
she can live the life she wants to, yes, it's all right with me.
I think I'd rather be a cowboy, I think I'd rather ride the range.
I think I'd rather be a cowboy than to lay me down in love and lady's chains.

I'd rather live on the side of a mountain than wander through canyons of concrete and steel.
I'd rather laugh in the rain and sunshine and lay down my sundown in some starry field.

Oh, but I miss her in the morning when I awake alone.
The absence of her laughter is a cold and empty sound.
But her memory always makes me smile and I want you to know,
I love her, yes I love her just enough to let her go.

You can do whatever you want to do
Wherever you want to go it's up to you
And wouldn't it be fine
Following your heart, playing your own part

You and me out on a farm, let the sun be our alarm
Kickin' off your shoes, doin' what we choose
And wouldn't it be fine
Knowing that your mine anytime you want to be

But I don't want to own you
I just want to hold you
I don't want to need you
I just like to see you smile and stay for awhile

And if the times get rough, being free might be enough
To see us through the storm and keep our feelings warm
And wouldn't it be fine
Looking back and knowing that we helped each other find

You can do whatever you want to do
Wherever you want to go it's up to you
And wouldn't it be fine
Following your heart knowing from the start
It's up to you
It's up to you
It's up to you

Headin' down from Canada on a gravel road a mile from Montana
Then my Daddy read a sign and took us in the wrong direction

And I'm told some years were lean
They had a storm in forty-seven

He lost the wheat and lost his home
But he found a family Bible
Faith as solid as a stone

You've given back my joy in life
And filled me with new meaning

I've come with my gift too

That brotherhood surrounds you
That you may know the warmth of love

All of the other reindeer used to laugh and call him names,
They never let poor Rudolph join in any reindeer games.

Then one foggy Christmas Eve, Santa came to say,
""Rudolph with your nose so bright, won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""
Then how the reindeer loved him and they shouted out with glee,
""Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer, you'll go down in history.""

Sing songs of the sunrise into the night
The stars as your timepiece, make it all right
Make friends with the darkness, talk to the moon
And when the light lifts, you can let out a tune

I've been to the mountains, climbed through the sky
Shouldered their whiteness, watched their gold fly
Shared in their treasures, shook at their might
Spoke softly of wonders, Cowboy's Delight

Last night while I was out drinking
Trying to have a good time
The lady with whom I was speaking
Thought I was feeding her some old line
 
When I spoke of a cold winter's morning
A duck blind and a river of gray
The sound of the snow softly falling
When I thought I heard somebody say
 
I took two shots, got no ducks, and cold, cold hands
 
I could tell by the gaze of my comrades
That I was the one who had spoke
Their eyes held a message of patience
The thrill of the hunt and of hope
 
But when I spoke again how they listened
For the wisdom of what I might say
If the good Lord had meant us to shoot one
He'd surely send more ducks our way
 
I took two shots, got no ducks, and cold, cold hands
 
Well the lady with whom I was speaking
She laughed lightly and she wandered away
My heart, like the snow in my story
Fell silent, I'd hoped she would stay
 
It's so nice to talk to somebody
To find someone who's willing to share

Ten thousand years ago
Between the swan and Hercules
Where even dark clouds glow

To live with grace, to ride the swell
To yet be strong of will
To love the wind, to learn it's song
And empty space to fill

Apollo taught me to rhyme
Orpheus taught me to play
Andromeda cast down her sign
And Vega lights my way

Smoke rings in a galaxy
An endless flight through time
Lyra gave her harp to him
And left him free to climb

A winter's journey from the moon
To reach the summer sun
To rise again, to sing for you
A song that's yet unsung

Orpheus taught me to play

Born in the month of June
No silver spoon to help you out
Your Mother had you naturally
Naturally's the way you came out

You know your your own mind
And you show it to me
Give me the high sign
When you want to be free
And open up my eyes
To the wonders that you see

See the airplane fly
See the trees rush by
Be brave and strong when you hurt yourself
And don't you have a worry in the world

For the love that's been given you
Is the one thing time can't erase
And evryday it's growin'
Like the knowin' smile upon your face

You're startin' out strong
You get a kick out of life
You like to sing songs
Be in the spotlight
And when everybody's watchin' you
You shine so bright

See the airplane fly
See the trees rush by
Be brave and strong when you hurt yourself
And don't you have a worry in the world

You know your your own mind
And you show it to me
Give me the high sign
When you want to be free
And open up my eyes

See the trees rush by
Be brave and strong when you hurt yourself
And don't you have a worry in the world

John Denver,"If your driving down the road and you come across an old man
Holding out his thumb in the wind
His clothes are old and dirty and dirty that doesn't matter
It's his eyes that tell where he's been
If you're not afraid to take your chances on a stranger
He might have some company to lend
Why don't you pull off to the side and let that old man have a ride
He can tell you all the crazy things he's seen

I'm an old hitchhiker
The highway is the only home I know
Where you're headed I don't mind
I ain't been there in some time
And it's just exactly where I want to go

I can tell you how I started in the circus as a barker
Drawing people in from far and wide
They never did regret the dollar that it cost 'em
We always left 'em feeling good inside
We were headed for Montana when we hired us a dancer
Her beauty it was more than I can say
Then one summer night she set my soul on fire
Lord, I wish that she was here with me today

I'm an old hitchhiker, I wonder what's a waiting 'round the bend
I don't know what I might see and I don't need no guarantee
Just a ride from here to there and back again

I was only seventeen when I took the open highway
Took it for my teacher and a friend
I've been thirty years a-thumbing
Some might call it bumming
But it's better than just crying in the wind
So if you're driving down the road and you come across an old man holding out his thumb in the rain
Why don't you pull off to the side let the poor boy have a ride
He can tell you all the crazy things he's seen

Build a home in some small town
But within my heart I know I never will

John Denver,"The old folks don't talk much
They talk so slowly when they do
They are rich, they are poor
Their illusions are gone, they share one heart for two

Their homes all smell of time of old photographs
And an old fashioned song
Though you may live in town
You live so far away when you've lived too long

Have they laughed too much
Do their dry voices crack
Talking of things gone by
Have they cried too much

A tear or two still always seems to cloud the eye
They tremble as they watch
The old silver clock
When day is through

Tick tock, so, so slow
It says 'Yes', it says 'No'
It says, ""I wait for you""

The old folks dream no more
Their books have gone to sleep
The piano's out of tune, the little cat is dead
And no more do they sing on a Sunday afternoon

The old folks move no more
Their world become too small
Their bodies feel like lead
They might look out a window

Or else sit it a chair
Or else they stay in bed
And if they still go out
Arm in arm, arm in arm

In the morning chill, it's to have a good cry
To say their last goodbye to one who's older still
And then they go home to the old silver clock
When day is through

Tick tock, so, so slow
It says 'Yes', it says 'No'
It says, ""I wait for you""

The old folks never die
They just put down their heads and go to sleep one day
They will hold each others hands
Like children in the dark but one will get lost anyway

And the other will remain
Just sitting in a room which makes no sound
It doesn't matter now
The song has died away and echo's all around

You'll see them as they walk
Through the sun filled parks
Where children run and play
It hurts to much to smile

It hurts so much
But life goes on for still another day
As they try to escape the old silver clock
When day is through

Tick tock, so, so slow
It says 'Yes', it says 'No'
It says, ""I wait for you""

The old old silver clock
That's hanging on the wall
That waits for us all

A wise man seeks an answer, burns his candle through the night
Is a jewel just a pebble that found a way to shine
Is a hero's blood more righteous than a hobo's sip of wine
 
Did I speak to you one morning on some distant world away
Did you save me from an arrow, did you lay me in a grave
Were we brothers on a journey, did you teach me how to run
Were we broken by the waters, did I lie you in the sun
 
I dreamed you were a prophet in a meadow
I dreamed I was a mountain in the wind
I dreamed you knelt and touched me with a flower
I awoke with this: a flower in my hand
 
I know that love is seeing all the infinite in one
In the brotherhood of creatures; who the father, who the son
The vision of your goodness will sustain me through the cold
Take my hand now to remember when you find yourself alone

It fills the endless yearning of the soul

Your destiny's your own
You go as far as you can go
And if there's time to sleep
There's time to make love
 
I came, I saw, I conquered
But I rode off in the sun
But I know the look she left with me
Keeps telling me she won
Her face is the only thing I see
Whispering those words of prophesy
 
I may come easy, but I don't come free
You're never gonna see the last of me
Baby, you look good to me tonight
I was born to love you now can't you see
Baby, you look good to me tonight
I'm ordinarily very shy
But I take the time to satisfy
Baby, you look good to me tonight","Baby, You Look Good to Me Tonight",1977
John Denver,"To sail on a dream on a crystal clear ocean
To ride on the crest of a wild raging storm
To work in the service of life and living
In search of the answers to the questions unknown
To be part of the movement and part of the growing
Part of beginning to understand

Aye Calypso the places you've been to
The things that you've shown us
The stories you tell
Aye Calypso, I sing to your spirit
The men who have served you so long and so well

Like the dolphin who guides you, you bring us beside you
To light up the darkness and show us the way
For though we are strangers in your silent world
To live on the land we must learn from the sea
To be true as the tide and free as a wind swell
Joyful and loving in letting it be

John Denver,"Jessie went away last summer a couple of months ago
After all our time together it was hard to see her go
She called me right up when she arrived asked me one more time to come
Living on a L.A. freeway ain't my kind of having fun

[Chorus]
I think I'd rather be a cowboy
I think I'd rather ride the range
I think I'd rather be a cowboy
Than to lay me down in love and lady's chains.

When we were just beginning it was such an easy way
Layin' back up in the mountains singin' songs for sunny days
But she got tired of pickin' daisies and cooking my meals for me
She can live the life she wants to, yes, and it's all right with me

[Chorus]

I'd rather live on the side of the mountains
Than wander though canyons of concrete and steel
I'd rather laugh with the rain and the sunshine
And lay down my sundown in some starry field

Oh, but I miss her in the mornin' when I awake alone
And the absence of her laughter is a cold and empty sound
But her memory always makes me smile and I want you to know
I love her, yes, I love her just enough to let her go

Thinking about the good times
Thinking about the rain
Thinking about how bad it feels alone again

I'm sorry for the way things are in China
I'm sorry things ain't what they used to be
But more than anything else
I'm sorry for myself
'Cause you're not here with me

Our friends all ask about you
And I say you're doing fine
And I expect to hear from you almost anytime
But they all know I'm crying
And I can't sleep at night
They all know I'm dying down deep inside

I'm sorry for all the lies I told you
I'm sorry for the things I didn't say
But more than anything else
I'm sorry for myself
I can't believe you went away

John Denver,"On the road of experience, I'm trying to find my own way.
Sometimes I wish that I could fly away

And to find out who I am
And I'm looking to know and understand
It's a sweet, sweet dream
Sometimes I'm almost there 
Sometimes I fly like an eagle
And sometimes I'm deep in despair

All alone in the universe, sometimes that's how it seems
I get lost in the sadness and the screams
Then I look in the center, suddenly everything's clear
I find myself in the sunshine and my dreams

And I'm looking for space
And to find out who I am
And I'm looking to know and  understand

And sometimes I'm deep in despair

And to find out who you are
When you're looking to try and reach the stars

John Denver,"This old guitar taught me to sing a love song
It showed me how to laugh and how to cry
It introduced me to some friends of mine
And brightened up some days
It helped me make it through some lonely nights
Oh, what a friend to have on a cold and lonely night

This old guitar gave me my lovely lady
It opened up her eyes and ears to me
It brought us close together
And I guess it broke her heart
It opened up the space for us to be
What a lovely place and a lovely space to be

This old guitar gave me my life, my living
All the things you know I love to do
To serenade the stars that shine
From a sunny mountainside
And most of all to sing my songs for you

And it pleases me to have you here

While we open up the spaces
Try to break some chains

They will never come again

Catch me camping out on the open sea

Just how good this good life feels to me - feels so good

Every shallow, every tree
Surely my loves shining like the sea
 
I can make you happy
If I can I'll take you away on a wave in my arms
Never leave you on the edge all alone

Rolling like the water across my sleepless night

Way back up in the woods among the evergreens

But he could play a guitar just like a-ringing a bell

Go, go, go Johnny go
Go, go Johnny go
Go, go Johnny go
Go, go Johnny go

Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
The engineers would see him sitting in the shade
Strumming to the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by would they would stop and say
Oh my but that little country boy can play

Well his mama told him some day you will be a man
You will be the leader of a big old band

Maybe some day your name will be in lights
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight

Were way out of time

Have drifted between us

Much greater then mine

A fire that consumes us

For our father is with us
Our mother will teach us
What we need to learn

Down and out

He spoke right out
He talked about life, talked of life
He laughed, slapped his leg instead

He said the name Bojangles and he danced a lick
Across the cell
He grabbed his pants and took a stance and he jumped so high
He clicked his heels
He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh
Shook his clothes all around
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles dance

He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs
Throughout the South
And he spoken in tears of fifteen years how it's dogging him
They traveled about
The dog up and died he up and died
After twenty years he still grieves

He said I dance now at every chance and honky tonks
For drinks and tips
But most the time I spend behind these county bars
'Cause I drink a bit

He was stranded in some tiny town
On fair Prince Edward Isle
Awaitin' for a ship to come and find him
A one-horse place, a friendly face
Some coffee and a tiny trace
Of fiddlin' in the distance far behind him

A dime across the counter then
A shy hello, a brand new friend
A walk along the street in the wintry weather
A yellow light, an open door
And a welcome friend, there's room for more
And then they're standing there inside together

He said I've heard that tune before somewhere
But I can't remember when
Was it on some other friendly shore
Or did I hear it on the wind
Was it written on the sky above
I think I heard it from someone I loved
But I never heard it sound so sweet since then

Now his feet begin to tap
A little boy says I'll take your hat
He's caught up in the magic of her smile
And leap the heart inside him went
And off across the floor he sent
His clumsy body graceful as a child

He said there's magic in the fiddler's arm
There's magic in this town
There's magic in the dancers' feet
And the way they put them down
People smilin' everywhere
Boots and ribbons, locks of hair
And laughter and old blue suits and easter gowns

Now the sailors' gone, the room is bare
The old piano settin' there
Someone's hat's left hanging on the rack
And empty chairs, the wooden floor
That feels the touch of shoes no more
Awaitin' for the dancers to come back

And the fiddle's in the closet
Of some daughter of the town
The strings are broke and the bow is gone
And the cover's buttoned down
But sometimes on December nights
When the air is cold and the wind is right
There's a melody that passes through this town

",The Ballad of St. Anne's Reel,1980
John Denver,"Played a wedding for the money and I wish I could have told the bride and groom
Just what I think of marriage, what's in store after the honeymoon.
I was rumbling through the verses about how men and women ought to live apart,
How a promise never made could not be broken and would never break a heart.

Suddenly from out of nowhere this little girl came spinning across the floor
Her crinolines were billowing beneath the skirt of calico she wore.
As her joy fell on the honored guests each one of them was drawn into her dream
And they laughed and stamped and clapped their hands and hollered at her, ""Dance little Jean!""

They said:
Dance little Jean, this day is for you,
Two people that you love stood up to say 'I Do.'
Dance little Jean, the prayer that you had was answered today-
Your Momma's marrying your Dad.

Well this cynic's heart just melted as I figured what this get together meant 
And how it ended years of tears and sad confusions that the little girl had spent.
They told the band to pack it up about the time the couple cut the cake
But we stayed and we played all night long for love and laughs and little Jeanie's sake

We played: 
Dance little Jean, this day is for you,
Two people that you love stood up to say 'I Do.'
Dance little Jean, the prayer that you had was answered today-
Your Momma's marrying your Dad.

We sang:

Everybody's got the dancin' fever
Everbody'd love to rock and roll
Play it loud and baby play it better
Funky music gotta stretch your soul
 
Just relax and let the rhythm take you
Don't you be afraid to lose control
If your heart has found some empty spaces
Dancin's just a thing to make you whole
 
I am one who dances with the mountains
I am one who dances with the wind
I am one who dances on the ocean
My partner's more than pieces more than friends
 
Were you there the night they lost the lightning
Were you there the day the earth stood still
Did you see the famous and the fighting
Did you hear the prophet tell his tale
 
We are one when dancing with the mountains
We are one when singing in the wind
We are one when thinking of each other
More than partners much more than pieces more than friends

I saw the quiet slender
Of a field of columbine
I skied on crystal pathways
To a mountain peak so tall
And I walked the mighty summits
With the one who made it all
 
And I fell in love with a lady
'Cause I've seen her at her best
And I've walked her wild and rugged paths
Through her open wilderness
And now I never can betray her
Steal her riches and be gone
'Cause when you love a mountain lady
You're gonna sing a mountain song
 
Now people come from everywhere
To see what they can find
And some take lots of pictures
And some just take their time
But they're some who take her beauty
That can't be bought or sold
And they think of only money
While destroying wealth untold
 
But you fall in love with a lady
When you've slept upon her breast
And I've walked her wild and rugged paths
To her open wilderness
And you never can betray her
Steal her riches and be gone
'Cause when you love a mountain lady
You're gonna sing a mountain song",The Mountain Song,1980
John Denver,"I don't drink as much as I used to
Lately it just ain't my style
And the hard times don't hurt like they used to
They pass quicker like when I was a child

Somehow I've learned to listen
For a sound like the sun going down
In the magic the morning is bringing
It keeps my feet on the ground

Don't the midsummer days sit so heavy
But don't they flow like a breeze through your mind
And nothing occurs in a hurry
To make up for someone's lost time

Somehow I've learned to listen
For a sound like the sun going down
In the magic the morning is bringing
It keeps my feet on the ground

Somehow I've learned to listen
For a sound like the breeze dying down
In the magic the morning is bringing
It keeps my feet on the ground",Song for the Life,1980
John Denver,"Whalebones and crosses
Stand against the arctic sky
Wind blows through the graveyard
Where our fallen fathers lie

Eternal snow that covers them
The shadows of the sun
The mighty struggle on the seas
A way of life is run

I'll sing for you my father
For the ancient sacred ways
How the hunter loved the hunted
How the night becomes the day

The circle of the mighty spirit
Keeps us in its fold
The warmth of understanding
Like a light shot through the cold

Then bring to me my people
Touch them with your loving hands
Lead them from confusion
Lead them back unto the land

For a sickness seems to block their path
It clouds my peoples eyes
The promise that an idle truth
Will reap a golden lie

Whalebones and crosses
Stand against the arctic sky
The wind blows through the graveyard
Where our fallen fathers lie

The timeless hunt a journey back
To what we once came from
Compassion and nobility
Beneath the midnight sun

The mighty struggle of the seas
A way of life is run

John Denver,"Sunday and it's raining in Alaska
Seven days, I haven't seen the sun
Flying bush, flying low along the shore lune
Doing everything I can to make it home

I can't wait to see the Wrangle Mountain
I can't wait to do what I will do
Honey, did I never say how time goes by so slowly
When I can't wait to get back home to you

Three years from the war and settled down now
I did my time and served my country well
In the freedom I defended I fly beneath the North Star
And I just don't know a better way to feel

I can't wait to see the Wrangle Mountain
I can't wait to do what I will do
Honey, did I never say how time goes by so slowly
When I can't wait to get back home to you

It's a quiet life out here among the mountains
In a cabin that was built with these two hands
McCarthey lies asleep beside the Glacier
It's colder now, winter's in the air
If you think they're wild it's just because they can't be broken
It's a strong and gentle people living there

I can't wait to see the Wrangle Mountain

When I can't wait to get back home to you",Wrangle Mountain Song,1980
John Denver,"And you say that the battle is over
And you say that the war is all done
Go tell it to those with the wind in their nose
Who run from the sound of the gun

And write it on the sides of the great whaling ships
Or on ice floes where conscience is tossed
With the wild in their eyes it is they who must die
And it's we who must measure the loss

And you say that the battle is over
And finally the world is at peace
You mean no one is dying and mothers don't weep
Or it's not in the papers at least

There are those who would deal in the darkness of life
There are those who would tear down the sun
And most men are ruthless but some will still weep
When the gifts we were given are gone

Now the blame cannot fall on the heads of a few
It's become such a part of the race
It's eternally tragic that which is magic
Be killed at the end of the glorious chase

From young seals to great whales from waters to wood
They will fall just like weeds in the wind
With fur coats and perfumes and trophies on walls
What a hell of a race to call men

And you say that the battle is over
And you say that the war is all done
Go tell it to those with the wind in their nose
Who run from the sound of the gun

And write it on the sides of the great whaling ships
Or on ice floes where conscience is tossed
With the wild in their eyes it is they who must die
And we who must measure the loss
With the wild in their eyes it is they who must die
And we who will measure the cost
",You Say the Battle Is Over,1980
John Denver,"Because he called the forest brother
Because he called the earth his mother
They drove him out into the rain
Some people even said the boy from the country was insane

Because he spoke with fish in the creek
He tried to tell us that the animals could speak
Who knows, perhaps they do
How do you know they don't
Just because they've never spoken to you

Boy from the country, he left his home when he was young
Boy from the country, he loves the sun

He tried to tell us that we should love the land
We turned our heads and laughed
And we did not understand
Sometimes I think that the boy from the country
Is the only one who sees
Because the boy from the country
Doesn't want to see the forest for the trees

Boy from the country, he left his home when he was young
Boy from the country, he loves the sun",Boy from the Country,1981
John Denver,"If our lives could lie before us like a straight and narrow highway
So that we could see forever, long before we took the ride,
We would never look to heaven, make a wish, or climb a mountain,
'Cause we'd always know the answer what's on the other side.

But life ain't no easy freeway, just some gravel on the ground.
You pay for every mile you go, to spread some dust around.
Though we all have destinations, and the dust will settle down;
This life ain't no easy freeway, just some gravel on the ground.

So let's walk the road together.
Who knows what we'll find tomorrow;
Maybe good times, maybe sorrow will be waitin' 'round the bend.
Given time, two hearts discover what they're feelin' for each other;
At the best we'll end up lovers, at the least we'll make a friend.

But life ain't no easy freeway, just some gravel on the ground.

John Denver,"His Daddy was a simple man, just a red dirt Georgia farmer
And his Momma spent her young life having kids and baling hay
He had fifteen years and an ache inside to wander
So he hopped a freight in Way cross and wound up in L.A.

Lord, the cold nights had no pity on a Way cross, Georgia farm boy
Most days he went hungry, then the summer came
He met a girl known on the strip as San Francisco's Mabel Joy
Destitutions child born of an L.A. street called Shame

Growing up came quietly in the arms of Mabel Joy
Laughter found their mornings brought meaning to his life
Yes, the night before she left sleep came and left that Way cross, Georgia boy
With dreams of Georgia cotton and a California wife

Sunday morning found him standing neath the red light at her door
When a right cross sent him reeling, put him face down on the floor
In place of Mabel Joy he found a merchant mad marine
Who growled, your Georgia neck is red but sonny, you're still green

He turned twenty-one in a gray rock federal prison
The old judge had no mercy for a Way cross, Georgia boy
Staring at those four gray walls in silence he would listen
To that midnight freight he knew would take him back to Mabel Joy

Sunday morning found him standing 'neath the red light at her door
With a bullet in his side, he cried, Have you seen Mabel Joy?
Stunned and shaken someone said, why, she's not here no more
She left this house four years today, they say she's looking for some Georgia farm boy",San Francisco Mabel Joy,1981
John Denver,"This song was first released on the Some Days Are Diamonds Album. It is the only album it appears on.

For someone who's got everything, life can still be rough
If things are what you're lookin' for, there's never quite enough
And all the tea in China won't make a house a home
You can be a millionaire and still be sleepin' alone

There might be some one night stands to ease the pain inside
Or someone you can call around if you've lost all your pride
Please don't be mistaken. I don't mean to put that down
I know there's times when anything is better than sleepin' alone

Sleepin' alone can make a bottle just about your dearest friend
Sleepin' alone can make you swear to God this night will never end

You know it's not company you are lookin' for
You know it's not just pleasure, you know it's somethin' more
You know it's not the answer if it's not like comin' home
If the one who's there doesn't really care, it's worse than sleepin' alone

Sleepin' alone can make a bottle just about your dearest friend
Sleepin' alone can make you swear to God this night will never end

For someone who's got everything, life can still be rough
If things are what you're lookin' for, there's never quite enough
And all the gold that glitters won't make a house a home
You can be a millionaire and still be sleepin' alone
You might be a millionaire and still be sleepin' alone

",Sleepin' Alone,1981
John Denver,"Down down down deeper into love
All around I can feel your love
All my life I've been dreaming
Night into morning
Until you opened my eyes
 
Love love love such a mystery
Golden light shining down on me
Soft and warm as the warming
But I never saw it
Until you opened my eyes
 
Floating in circles I'm flying
It feels so good that I'm crying
 
Down down down deep inside of me
Love sweet love's all that I can see
Golden light keeps on shining
Shining forever since you opened my eyes",Till You Opened My Eyes,1981
John Denver,"January back in '55 we rode a Greyhound bus through the Georgia midnight
Grandpa was sleeping and the winter sky was clear
We hit a bump and his head jerked back a little and he mumbled something
He woke up smiling but his eyes were bright with tears he said...

I dreamed I was back on the farm
Twenty years have passed boy
But the memory still warms me
Wild flowers in a mason jar

He told me those old stories about that one room cabin in Kentucky
The smell of rain and the feel of the warm earth in his hands
He slowly turned and stared outside
His face was mirrored in the window
And his reflection flew across the moonlit land

And he dreamed he was back on the farm
He tilts his head and listens to the early sounds of morning
Wild flowers in a mason jar

An old man and an eight year old boy
Rolling down that midnight highway
Warm Kentucky memories from a winter Georgia night
I started drifting off and Grandpa tucked his coat around me
I think I tried to smile as I slowly closed my eyes
And I dreamed I was with him on the farm
Grandpa, I can hear the evening wind out in the corn
Wild flowers in a mason jar and the bus rolling through the night",Wild Flowers in a Mason Jar (The Farm),1981

For other folks it just drags on
Some folks like the taste of smokey whiskey
Others figure tea's too strong

I don't like all this bouncing back and forth
Me, I want to live with my feet in Dixie
And my head in the cool blue north

In a small suburban garden
Not a single neighbour knows our name
I know the woman wishes we would move some place
Where the houses aren't all the same

Jesse, I wish you would take mewhere the grass is greener
I couldn't really say where it may be
Oh, some place high on a montain top
Bown by the deep blue sea

And there we'll do just as we please
It ain't nothing but a breeze

One day I'll be old gray Grandpa
All the pretty girls will call me ""Sir""
Now where they're asking me how things are
Soon they'll ask me how things are

Well, I don't mind being an old gray Grandpa
As long as you'll be my gray Grandma

My song is a cry of desperation
All of the words I hear
Have lost their meaning

My life is a well of confusion
Drowned out by the sound of the lost and lonely
Only the voice inside
Speaks your name to me

If they only knew the things that I know
If they only could see the things that I see

Like fire and water against each other

And danced the sky on laughter silvered wings
Sun ward I've climbed and joined the tumbling mirth
Of sun-split clouds and done a hundred things

Hovering there I've chased the shouting winds aloft
And flung my eager craft through footless halls of air
 
The higher we fly, the farther we go
The closer we are to each other
The darker the night, the brighter the star
In peace go my sisters and brothers
 
Up, up, the long delirious burning blue
I've topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace
Where never lark nor even eagle flew
And while with silent lifting mind I trod
The high trespassed sanctity of space
Put out my hand and touched the face of God

About laying to rest and then flying
How the moment at hand
Is the only thing we really own

Why is it thus we are here
And so soon we are gone

Is this life just a path
To the place that we all have come from
Does the heart know the way
And if not can it ever be found
In a smile or a tear
Or a prayer or a sigh or a song

And if so I sing for my father
And in truth you must know I would rather
He were here by my side
We could fly on the wings of a dream
To a place where the spirit could find us
And joy and surrender would bind us
We are one anyway
Anyway we are more than we seem

There are those who will lead us
Protect us each step of the way
From beginning to end
For each moment forever each day
Such a gift has been given
It can never be taken away

Though the body in passing must leave us
There is one who remains to receive us
There are those in this life
Who are friends from our heavenly home
So I listen to the voices inside me
For I know they are there just to guide me
And my faith will proclaim it is so
We are never alone

From the dark of the night to the dawn

He is here he could never be gone

Somethin' about a river the way it runs to meet the sea
There's somethin' about a rainfall and it's like the gift of living
There's somethin' about that water that makes me sing

Oh somethin' about the mountains rising right straight up to heaven
And somethin' about a canyon in the shade of a cottonwood tree
Somethin' about the desert in the afterglow of evening
There's somethin' about the west that makes me sing

There's somethin' about the way you love me baby
There's somethin' about the way your lips meet mine
There's somethin' about the way you like to touch me
It really turns me on and makes my little light shine

There's somethin' about the way you love me baby
There's somethin' about the way your lips meet mine
There's somethin' about the way you like to touch me

There's somethin' about the country on the very first day of springtime
There's somethin' about a wheatfield, oh you know I love the prairie
There's somethin' about the land that makes me sing

Still longer since I've walked with you
For the first time I know what I'm missing
Some answers are no longer true

So I question the course that I follow
I'm doubtful and deep in despair
My heart is full of impossible notions
Can it be you no longer care?

How can I leave you again
I must be clear out of my mind
Lost in a storm I've gone blind
Oh, how can I leave you again

How can I leave you again
I must be clear out of my mind
Lost in a storm I've gone blind
Oh, how can I leave you again",How Can I Leave You Again,1984
John Denver,"There are children raised in sorrow
On a scorched and barren plain
There are children raised beneath a golden sun
There are children of the water
Children of the sand
And they cry out through the universe
Their voices raised as one

I want to live I want to grow
I want to see I want to know
I want to share what I can give
I want to be I want to live

Have you gazed out on the ocean
Seen the breaching of a whale?
Have you watched the dolphins frolic in the foam?
Have you heard the song the humpback hears five hundred miles away
Telling tales of ancient history of passages and home?

I want to live I want to grow
I want to see I want to know
I want to share what I can give
I want to be I want to live

For the worker and the warrior the lover and the liar
For the native and the wanderer in kind
For the maker and the user and the mother and her son
I am looking for my family and all of you are mine

We are standing all together
Face to face and arm in arm
We are standing on the threshold of s dream
No more hunger no more killing
No more wasting life away
It is simply an idea
And I know its time has come

I want to live I want to grow
I want to see I want to know
I want to share what I can give
I want to be I want to live",I Want to Live,1984
John Denver,"I didn't think it could happen again
I'm just too old and set in my ways
I was convinced I would always be lonely
All of the rest of my days
Maybe I give up on romance
In my longing to give up the pain
I just didn't believe I would ever love again

I was like one who had shut myself in
Closed the windows, locked all the doors
Afraid of the dark and the beat of my heart
Yet knowing there had to be more
Though it sounds like a great contradiction
It's the easiest thing to explain
You see, I was afraid I might never love again

What does it take for a blind man to see
That there's more there than just meets the eye
What are the ways that the magic comes in
That can turn a song into a sigh
Sometimes I think that I'm dreaming
Or maybe I'm going insane
Or maybe it's just that I'm falling in love again

Here I am standing beside you
Oh life's such a wonderful game
Look at me now, I'm falling in love
Look at me now, I'm falling in love
Look at me now, I'm falling in love again",Love Again,1984
John Denver,"Perhaps love is like a resting place
A shelter from the storm
It exists to give you comfort
It is there to keep you warm
And in those times of trouble
When you are most alone
The memory of love will bring you home

Perhaps love is like a window
Perhaps an open door
It invites you to come closer
It wants to show you more
And even if you lose yourself
And don't know what to do
The memory of love will see you through

Oh, love to some is like a cloud
To some as strong as steel
For some a way of living
For some a way to feel
And some say love is holding on
And some say letting go
And some say love is everything
And some say they don't know

Perhaps love is like the ocean
Full of conflict, full of pain
Like a fire when it's cold outside
Or thunder when it rains
If I should live forever
And all my dreams come true
My memories of love will be of you

And some say love is holding on
And some say letting go
And some say love is everything
And some say they don't know

Perhaps love is like the ocean
Full of conflict, full of pain
Like a fire when it's cold outside
Or thunder when it rains
If I should live forever
And all my dreams come true
My memories of love will be of you",Perhaps Love,1984
John Denver,"Of course we have our differences
You shouldn't be surprised
It's as natural as changes
In the seasons and the skies
Sometimes we grow together
Sometimes we drift apart
A wiser man than I might know
The seasons of the heart

And I'm walking here beside you
In the early evening chill
A thing we've always loved to do
I know we always will
We have so much in common
So many things we share
That I can't believe my heart
When it implies that you're not there

Love is why I came here in the first place
Love is now the reason I must go
Love is all I ever hoped to find here
Love is still the only dream I know

So I don't know how to tell you
It's difficult to say
I never in my wildest dreams
Imagined it this way
But sometimes I just don't know you
There's a stranger in our home
When I'm lying right beside you
Is when I'm most alone

And I think my heart is broken
There's an emptiness inside
So many things I've longed for
Have so often been denied
Still I wouldn't try to change you
There's no one that's to blame
It's just some things that mean so much
And we just don't feel the same

Love is why I came here in the first place
Love is now the reason I must go
Love is all I ever hoped to find here
Love is still the only dream I know
True love is still the only dream I know",Seasons of the Heart,1984
John Denver,"It's funny how you sound as if you're right next door
When you're really half a world away
I just can't seem to find the words I'm looking for
To say the things that I want to say
I can't remember when I felt so close to you
It's almost more than I can bear
Though I seem a half a million miles from you
You are in my heart and living there

And the moon and the stars are the same ones you see
It's the same old sun up in the sky
And your voice in my ear is like heaven to me
Like the breezes here in old Shanghai

There are lovers who walk hand in hand in the park
And lovers who walk all alone
There are lovers who lie unafraid in the dark
And lovers who long for home
I couldn't leave you even if I wanted to
You're in my dreams and always near
And especially when I sing the songs I wrote for you
You are in my heart and living there

And the moon and the stars are the same ones you see
It's the same old sun up in the sky
And your face in my dreams is like heaven to me
Like the breezes here in old Shanghai

Shanghai breezes, cool and clearing
Evening's sweet caress
Shanghai breezes, soft and gentle
Remind me of your tenderness

And the moon and the stars are the same ones you see
It's the same old sun up in the sky
And your love in my life is like heaven to me
Like the breezes here in old Shanghai

And the moon and the stars are the same ones you see
It's the same old sun up in the sky
And your love in my life is like heaven to me
Like the breezes here in old Shanghai
Just like the breezes here in old Shanghai",Shanghai Breezes,1984
John Denver,"He was born in the Bitterroot Valley in the early morning rain
Wild geese over the water heading north and home again
Bringing a warm wind from the south
Bringing the first taste of the spring
His mother took him to her breast and softly she did sing

Oh Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies

His mother died that summer and he never learned to cry
He never knew his father and he never did ask why
And he never knew the answers that would make an easy way
But he learned to know the wilderness and to be a man that way

His mother's brother took him in to family and his home
Gave him a hand that he could lean on and a strength to call his own
And he learned to be a farmer and he learned to love the land
And he learned to read the seasons and he learned to make a stand

Oh Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies

On the eve of his twentyfirst birthday he set out on his own
He was thirty years and running when he found his way back home
Riding a storm across the mountains and an aching in his heart
Said he came to turn the pages and to make a brand new start

Now he never told a story of the time that he was gone
Some say he was a lawyer, some say he was a John
There was something in the city that he said he couldn't breathe
And there was something in the country that he said he couldn't leave

Oh Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies

Now some say he was crazy, some are glad he's gone
Some of us will miss him, we'll try to carry on
Giving a voice to the forest, giving a voice to the dawn
Giving a voice to the wilderness and the land that he lived on

Oh Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies

African sunrise, show us a brand new way
Give us a brand new morning
Show us forever beginning to stand on our own
African sunrise, smile on my African home

In this hour of quiet contemplation
The stillness of the dawning calms my mind
I face the day with heartfelt exaltation
The light is both a promise and a sign

In the darkness we have lost the son of our sister
Though the beauty of his spirit lingers still
This was a child of love, a child of laughter
Who cannot understand the way I feel

Is it not the sun that gives the seasons
Is it not the sun that brings the rain
Our throats are choled with dust, but we're still singing
Our song will not be silenced by the rain

All around the village I could hear the roosters crowing
There was a time it was like music to my ears
Now all I can hear is the sound of hungry babies crying
I pray for rain to wash away their tears

African sunrise, light of a brand new day
African sunrise, light of a brand new way
With one who will be our brother
And one who will be our partner and teach us to know

In the north, the scarlet council talks of war
And the long knives have massacred the tribe and burned corn

No more songs of the hunters on the buffalo plain
No more smoke from sacred fires touch these hills
And the numbers of the people grow fewer every mile
And our children will not leave the Great Spirit's ways
 
There will be a trail of tears
There will be a trail of pain
And Jackson will have the Mississippi and the twenty dollar bill
But for us the trail is all that will remain
 
On the streets of rapid City
On the road to Wounded Knee
There is whiskey for forgetting everything
But the old ones say there may be time learning from each other
The way that it had once been meant to be
 
There is still a trail of tears
There is still a trail of pain

Lost in the night all alone
With nowhere to hide, crying inside

The nights are so dark and so long
Dreaming of touching your face in the moonlight
Filling the silence with song

Living without you the days are endless
The clock winding steadily down
Imagining footsteps, your hand at the gatepost
The wind shuts the open door
the wind shuts the open...
There, I almost got caught again
Lost in the night all alone
With nowhere to hide, crying inside

The songbird, she trembles all day long
She sings as if her poor heart must break
Watching the freedom that flies past her window
Dreaming won't fit in a cage

Fly away songbird, the wind she loves you
Your prison is forsaken at last
Follow your dreaming, you're bound up to heaven
You're reaching for something more
Reaching for something...

Lost in the night all alone
With nowhere to hide, crying inside

All I wanted was you by my side, baby, you're only along for the ride, only along for the ride

Convertible dreams running wild in the streets in the all time American town
When you played the thrill queen, baby, I heard the jazz of joy

John Denver,"Hey there, Mr. Lonely Heart, if you could find the time
I would like to sit and talk, to see if we could find
The answer to the mystery of love's most precious seed
Is it in a touch or in a kiss or simply in the need

Or is it really love itself that always wants to give
The heart and soul of all of us and everything that lives

Hey there, Mr. Cold, Cold Heart, I know I could be wrong
To think that life could be so sweet and love could be so strong
As to gather everyone of us, like one big family
To share with one another all we have and all we see

It's true the deepest part of us is everywhere the same
And that the only differences are really just the names

We can join the children's song and show them that we care
Let them know we're on their side, no matter when or where
We can free their hearts from fear and hunger reconcile
We can give a child a chance and give a child a smile

True love is still the answer, and we are still the way
The gift is in the giving, and in living what we say

And if you have a lonely heart, this song is just for you
To ask for all that you can give and all that you can do
Remember that the mystery of love's most precious seed

Is in the heart of all of us, true love is all we need
It's in the heart of all of us, true love is all we need
Within the heart of all of us, true love is all we need

Within the heart of all of us, true love is all we need

The world turned out this way
And all of the times that you've asked yourself
About the games that people play.

About the politics of hunger
And the politics of need,
How the politics of power
Seem to be the politics of greed.

For all of the times that you've struggled in an effort
To work your way back up stream,
And all of the times you've held on to it,
When most of us had lost the dream.

And for all of the ones who have walked with you,
By your side or way back home,
Maybe much more than any of us
You know that no one is really alone.

Because the heart is still a hunter,
It's like a beacon in the night.
Though the heart is just a lover,
It's never afraid to fight.

We are fighting for more than survival,
We are working for more than peace,
We are giving ourselves to each other,
Making sure all injustice will someday cease.

And you can see how far we've come,
All the separate parts all the hundreds of hearts
That are beating together as one.

John Denver,"Christmas like a lullaby steals across the land
A breeze upon the water, rainfall upon the sand
We celebrate a baby born from spirit into man
And Christmas like a lullaby steals across the land

It's morning in Australia in fact it's Christmas Day
And Colorado never seemed so very far away
Back where night has fallen and it's still Christmas Eve
And snow is on the mountains where I always hate to leave

Here I am down under with a brand new family
And Christmas bells are ringing and there's presents 'neath the tree
I know that it's been said before and now I know it's true
That home is where the heart is and Christmas lives there too

On this morning Peace On Earth is still our fervent prayer
And I can hear it being whispered softly everywhere
And guns are called to silence and anger called to still
And brotherhood and sisterhood surrounded by goodwill

Christmas like a lullaby steals across the land
A breeze upon the water, rainfall upon the sand
We celebrate a baby born from spirit into man
And Christmas like a lullaby steals across the land
",Christmas Like a Lullaby,1990
John Denver,"The first Noel, the angel did say,
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep,
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the the East, beyond them far;
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

And by the light of that same star,
Three wise men came from country far;
To seek for a King was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

This star drew night to the northwest,
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest;
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place where Jesus lay.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

Then entered in those wise men three,
Full reverently upon their knee;
And offered there in his presence,
Their gold, and myrrh, and frankincense.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.",The First Noël,1990
John Denver,"Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer doey doey
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it doey oey
You would even say it glows

All of the other reindeer 
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
""Rudolph, with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight""
Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
""Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history""","Rudolph, The Red-Nossed Reindeer",1990
John Denver,"Two days before the moon was round
You felt the urge of sun's light beams
The muffled world of dolphin sound
Slipped down and back into your dreams

For nine full months that passed before
You learned of all of life's ancient rhymes
Then mother sensed a farther shore
And brought you forth into these times

So taste the air of your new world
And gently guide us to your mind
It knows the winds and sails unfurled
And holds to heart the dolphin kind

Welcome precious earth made child
We met you first in your father's songs
And mother's smile and waters wild
It's in this place you now belong

I know you know of all these things
And feel the faith of a dolphin's sigh
For you were born on silver wings
To taste the high blown crystal sky

To sing one day to all of us
The songs you learned in dolphin lair
Giving hope to life as all we must
And teach us how their grace to share",Ancient Rhymes,1990
John Denver,"Horses are creatures who worship the earth
They gallop on feet of ivory
Constrained by the wonder of dying and birth
The horses still run they are free
My body is merely the shell of my soul
But the flesh must be given its due
Like a pony that carries its rider back home
Like an old friend that's tried and been true

I had a vision of eagles and horses
High on a ridge in a race with the wind
Going higher and higher and faster and faster
On eagles and horses I'm flying again,

Eagles inhabit the heavenly heigths
They know neither limit nor bound
They're the guardian angels of darkness and light
They see all and hear every sound
My spirit will never be broken or caught
For the soul is a free-flying thing
Like an eagle that needs neither comfort nor thought
To rise up on glorious wings

I had a vision of eagles and horses
High on a ridge in a race with the wind
Going higher and higher and faster and faster
On eagles and horses I'm flying again,
I'm flying again, I'm flying again

My body is merely the shell of my soul
But the flesh must be given its due
Like a pony that carries its master back home
Like an old friend that's tried and been true
My spirit will never be broken or caught
For the soul is a free-flying thing
Like an eagle that needs neither comfort nor thought
To rise up on glorious wings

John Denver,"The Earth is our mother just turning around
With her trees in the forest and roots underground
Our father above us who's high is the wind
Paint us a rainbow without any end

[Chorus]
As the river runs freely the mountain does rise
Let me touch with my fingers and see with my eyes
In the hearts of the children of pure love still roams
Like a bright star in heaven that lights our way home
Like the flower that shattered the stone
 
Sparrows find freedom beholding the Sun
In the engine and beauty we're all joined in one
I reach out before me and look to the sky

As the river runs freely the mountain does rise
Let me touch with my fingers and see with my eyes
In the hearts of the children of pure love still roams

John Denver,"Imagine a month of Sundays
Each one a cloudy day
Imagine the moment the sun came shining through
Imagine that ray of sunshine as you
 
Remember your darkest hour
With dawn still far away
Remember the way that you longed for morning's light
And think of yourself as a candle in the night
 
Make believe this is the first day
Everything all brand new
Make believe that the sun is your own lucky star
And then understand the kind of gift you are

You are the promise of all the ages
You are the Prodigal Son
You are the vision of prophets and sages
You are the only one
 
Dream of a bright tomorrow
Know that your dream will come true
Carry your dream in a sparkling crystal jar
Then you will know the kind of gift you are

Down from the great white north
More than enough and then some
Swept her up on his own

Keep her steady cowgirl
Don't let go of the reigns
You are ready now girl
Never mind the growing pains

Worlds out there are waiting
Big and wild as the sky
No more hesitating
It's now or never, do or die

Keep her steady cowgirl
Don't let go of the reigns
You are ready now girl
Never mind the growing pains

As hard as you imagined
It being without me
We'll both be wishing it were that easy
Don't give me a pull, give me some room
When this round up is through, I'll be coming back home

Wide open spaces
Between these two prairie hearts
Wondering where their place is
In a world so far apart

Don't let go of the reigns

John Denver,"[Chorus:]
I watch you sleeping little angel face
And on behalf of the human race
Welcome to this crazy place

I watch you sleeping innocent and free
I don't know what your dreams may be
You don't know what you mean to me

You have never heard thunder
You have never seen the rain
But you can still feel the wonder
You can still feel the pain

And sometimes you look at me
So wise and so sure
I could easily believe you have been here before

I won't be here forever
But as long as I'm around
I promise you I will never let you down
To help make a world you can feel worthy of
I will teach you to fly on the wings of my love

John Denver,"The sun sinks behind me in the west
This is the time of day I love best
Salt breezes murmur through the coconut palm
As the colors change, they set a scene of tropic calm

Seagulls headed back to land
Over the mangrove and the salt pan
By a lazy creek with a six pack and a fishin' line
Win back some memories and losin' track of time

[Chorus]
I head a little further north each year
Leave the cities behind; out of sight, out of mind
Up where my troubles can all disappear
I head a little further north each year

Feeling the night wrap around me
Eases my mind's serenity
Ocean waves are hummin' on the outer reef
These balmy days and sultry nights are a welcome relief

John Denver,"Goin up to Alaska
Up to the land of the midnight sun
Where the whale and the polar bear run
Oer the icy blue sea

Goin up to Alaska
Up to the north and the pioneer life
Where courage and strength still survive
And a man can be free



 


American Child, does the call of the wild
Ever sing through the mist of your dreams
Does it fly with the wind when you waken again
When its gone do you know what it means

Can you picture the time when a man had to find
His own way through the cold
To come back again to all that youve been
Cant you see that its time to come home

To the flowers and seas and the rivers and the trees
And the earth whos the mother of all
A promise once made - will it shine, will it fade
Will we rise with the vision or fall

Goin up to Alaska
Up to the land of the midnight sun
Where the whale and the polar bear run
Oer the icy blue sea

Goin up to Alaska
Up to the north and the pioneer life
Where courage and strength still survive
And a man can be free

Men can be free
Goin up to Alaska
Goin up to Alaska
Goin up to Alaska

Raven's child
Is chasing salvation
Black beak turned white
From the crack and the snow
On the streets of despair
The answer is simple
A spoonful of mercy
Can set free the soul

The drug king sits
On his arrogant throne
Away and above and apart
Even children
Are twisted to serve him
And greed has corrupted
What once was a heart

Raven's child
Keeps vigil for freedom
Trades for the arms
That once made her strong
With nuclear warheads
And lasers in heaven
Fear does the choosing
Between right and wrong

The arms king sits
On his arrogant throne
Away and above and apart
Bankers assure him
That he needn't care
And greed makes a stone of
What once was a heart

Raven's child
Is washing the water
All of her wing-feathers
Blackened with tar
Prince William shoreline's
An unwanted highway
Of asphalt and anger
An elegant scar

The oil king sits
On his arrogant throne
Away and above and apart
Lawyers have warned him
He mustn't speak
And greed has made silent
What once was a heart

You know there are walls
That come tumbling down
For people who yearn to be free
Still there are hearts
That long to be opened
And eyes that are longing to see

Raven's child is our constant companion
Sticks like a shadow
To all that is done
Try as we may
We just can't escape him
The source of our sorrow and shame
We are one

The true King sits
On a heavenly throne
Never away nor above nor apart
With wisdom and mercy
And constant compassion
He lives in the love
That lives in our hearts

John Denver,"Stone haven Sunset the water's on fire
My true love of singing, we kiss and conspire
Sing a song for the ocean a song for the sky
A song for tomorrow love sweet by and by
For the child who is coming and for dreams that come true
Sing a song for each other for me and for you
Sing a song for all lovers all the stars in the skies
Sing of Stone haven water home, Stone haven Sunrise

Stone haven Sunset the desert's on fire
Christ on the cross again burns with desire
They are shooting at random though they aim at us all
It's the children who rise up and children who fall
All the angels are weeping the sweetest of tears
Fall like rivers of mercy to wash all our fears
Sing a song for Old Glory and a future that dies
Sing of Stone haven desert home, Stone haven Sunrise

Stone haven Sunset the city's on fire
The soldiers just smile and say this gun's for hire
Give in to the beast boy give in to the thrill
It's just human nature to hunt and to kill
We all die together and yet somehow alone
Just together we have memories and many are gone
Singing songs for old soldiers a chorus of sighs
Sing of Stone haven city home, Stone haven Sunrise

Stone haven Sunset the mountain's on fire
My spirit is lifted, rising higher and higher
All the prophets are laughing they say we told you so
It's one thing to play guessing games, another to know
For the needs of many are the sins of a few
And the day is forthcoming when accounting is due
Sing a song for sweet justice with a fire in her eyes
Sing of Stone haven mountain home, Stone haven Sunrise

Stone haven Sunset the water's on fire
My true love of singing, we kiss and conspire
Sing a song for the ocean a song for the sky
A song for tomorrow love sweet by and by

On the death night anniversary of the king
The pretenders talking dirty in the palace
But it doesn't have that old familiar ring
 
I see there's been some changes in the valley
All the renegades have finally settled down
Now they worship in the temples of their rivals
And desecrate the holy heart of town
 
Can't you hear all those sweet voices singing?
Takin' care of the chosen ones
Can't you hear all those mission bells ringin'?
Say a prayer for the chosen ones
 
I read they're pourin' oil on troubled waters
Yet they cast a giant shadow on the land
Let's spend another night across the border
And bury all our secrets in the sand

They swear there is no master and his slave
But the future's lookin' dim for the lonesome cowboy

Safe home at last
No cannon fire dockside
No flags half-mast

Like destiny's children
Souls lost at sea
No room on the lifeboat
You can hold on to me

Now the voyage is over
We're back on dry land

Ye who are weary come home
Softly and tenderly calling
Home, come on home
 
Sometimes when I'm feeling lonesome
And no one on earth seems to care
I'm all by myself in the darkness
With no one and nothing to share
 
Just when it feels like it's hopeless
And I'll never make it alone
I hear the voices of angels
Tenderly calling me home
 
Home, come on home
Ye who are weary come home
Softly and tenderly calling

I try to keep it together
I never let on that I'm scared

John Denver,"They say they love each other
I've no doubt they do
They say they'll always be together
That may not be true
 
They come from different places
Different points of view
They find themselves in different spaces

Two different directions
Too many different ways
One always on the road somewhere
The other one always stays
Too often unhappy
Too often on your own
When you are moving in different directions
True love is all alone
 
Old stories start to surface
Patterns from long ago
And loving quickly turns to anger
For reasons they don't even know
The strongest heart can be broken
With one insensitive word
The deepest feelings remain unspoken
 
No one is seen and nothing heard
Two different directions
Too many different ways
One always wants to work things out
The other one wants to play
To ready for changes
To much that just can't wait
When you are moving in different directions
True love can turn to hate
 
If opposites attract each other
What's the reason for
One being like an open window
One just like a closing door
 
Two different directions
Two many different ways
One likes to see the morning sunrise
The other one sleeps in late

To many times too late

If you are committed to different directions
True love will have to wait",Two Different Directions,1991

In rocky cathedrals that reach to the sky
I am the hawk and there's blood on my feathers

But time is still turning they soon will be dry
And all of those who see me, all who believe in me
Share in the freedom I feel when I fly

Sail over the canyons and up to the stars
And reach for the heavens and hope for the future
And all that we can be and not what we are",The Eagle and the Hawk,1993
John Denver,"A heritage of vision
Was given to us all
To smell the rose's fragrance
To hear the songbird's call
To watch the distant moonlight fill
The coming of the tides
To understand that life is more
Than always choosing sides
 
And some have seen what can be seen
Of sailing ships and kings
And some are given feet of clay
And some are given wings
And some must struggle just to breathe
Some have a golden spoon
And some will never leave the nest
While some walk on the moon
 
And don't you know the life that lives
Within the silent hills
Is just as rich and beautiful
And just as unfulfilled
As man with all his intellect
His reason and his choice
Oh, who's to say the nightingale
Has any less a voice
 
The silver dolphins twist and dance
And sing to one another
The cosmic ocean knows no bounds
For all that lives are brothers
The whippoorwill, the grizzly bear
The elephant, the whale
All children of the universe
All weavers of the tale
 
So palomino lie back down

And freedom on the run
I can hear her spirit calling me

To the rivers, I will be strong
To the forest, I'll find peace there
To the wild country, where I belong
 
Oh, I know some times I worry
On worldly ways and means
And I can see the future killing me
On a misbegotten highway
Of prophecies and dreams
A road to nowhere and eternity
 
And I know it's just changes
Yes, and mankind marching on
I know we can't live in yesterday
But compared to what we're losing
And what it means to me
I'd give my life and throw the rest away

John Denver,"Four strong winds that blow lonely, seven seas that run high
All those things that don't change come what may
Now our good times are all gone, and I'm bound for moving on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way.

Guess I'll go out to Alberta, weather's good there in the fall
Got some friends that I can go to working for
Still I wish you'd change your mind, if I asked you one more time
But we've been through that a hundred times or more

Four strong winds that blow lonely, seven seas that run high
All those things that don't change come what may
Now our good times are all gone, and I'm bound for moving on

If I get there before the snowflies, and if things are going good
You could meet me if I sent you down the fare

John Denver,"Where the walker runs down to the Carson Valley Plain
There lived a maiden, Darcy Farrow was her name
The daughter of old Dundee and a fair one was she
The sweetest flower that bloomed o'er the range
 
Her voice was as sweet as the sugar candy
Her touch was as soft as a bed of goose down
Her eyes shone bright like the pretty lights
That shone in the night out of Yerrington town
 
She was courted by Young Vandamere
A fine lad was he as I am to hear
He gave her silver rings and lacy things
And she promised to wed before the snows came that year
 
But her pony did stumble and she did fall
Her dyin' touched the hearts of us one and all
Young Vandy in his pain put a bullet through his brain
And we buried them together as the snows began to fall

They sing of her beauty in Virginia City too
At dusky sundown to her name they drink a round
And to young Vandy whose love was true",Darcy Farrow,1995

This is the way you lose your very best friend
This is how it feels when it's all over

When there is they just don't seem to hear
Words don't seem to matter much anyway
They can't describe the pain
They can't explain the fear

Still you hate to see the morning come
Somehow tomorrow doesn't matter much anymore

I guess he'd rather be in Colorado
He'd rather spend his time out where the sky looks like a pearl after a rain
Once again I see him walkin Once again I hear him talking to the stars he makes
And asking them for bus fare
I guess he'd rather be in Colorado
He'd rather play his banjo in the morning when the moon is scarcely gone
In the dawn the subways comin in the dawn I hear him hummin'
Some old song he wrote of love in Boulder Canyon
I guess he'd rather be in Colorado

In the end a quiet cough is all he has to show

John Denver,"I know how it feels to be head over heels
To be lost in true love and the light of the moon
When everything seems to be coming up roses,
Every word seems to be rhyming with June
And suddenly all of your dreams have come true,
Happiness lives in your heart
Then out of nowhere, one becomes two,
And everything seems to be falling apart

Is it love?
When your heart feels like it's broken
Is it love?
And you just can't take anymore
Is it love?
When there's nothing that's left to be spoken
Is it love?
And there's nothing worth listening for
Is it love?

I know what it means to get caught up in dreams
And in prayers that are answered with each passing day
When loving and laughter are birds of a feather,
And sharing and caring just one simple way
You know you'll never be all alone,
Someone will always be near
Then you turn around and your best friend is gone,
Oh where do they go when they just disappear?

Is it love?
When your heart feels like it's broken
Is it love?
And you just can't take anymore
Is it love?
When the good times have all been forgotten
Is it love?
And you fear there won't be any more
Is it love?

There's no answer, there seems to be nothing to say
In your anger, would you even hear anyway
It was magic, but somehow you've broken the spell
It was heaven, but somehow it's turned into hell

Is it love?
When you know that your heart has been broken
Is it love?
And you just can't take it anymore
Is it love?
When you feel more than you could imagine
Is it love?
Now there's nothing that's worth living for
Is it love?
Is it love?

You could be falling in love

Born just South of Cobly, Kansas
He was his mother's pride and joy

Gold is just a windy Kansas wheat-field
And blue is just a Kansas summer sky

And all the stories that he told me
Back when I was just a lad
All the memories that he gave me
All the good times that he had

Growin' up a Kansas farmboy
Life was mostly havin' fun
Ridin' on his Daddy's shoulders
Behind a view beneath the sun
 
Well, I guess there were some hard times
And I'm told some years were lean
They had a storm in forty-seven
A twister came and stripped them clean

He lost the farm and lost his family
He lost the wheat and lost his home
But he found a family Bible
Faith as solid as a stone

So he came to live at our house
And he came to work the land
He came to ease my Daddy's burden
And he came to be my friend

John Denver,"Me and my uncle went a ridin' down
From Colorado, west Texas bound
We stopped over in Santa Fe,
Part it being about half way
Besides it was the hottest part of the day

We led our ponies into the stall,
Went to a bar boys, bought drinks for all
Two days in the saddle, my body hurt.
It being Summer, took off my shirt
And tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt.

West Texas cowboys, all over town,
With gold and silver, they're loaded down.
Just in from roundup, you know it seemed a shame
And so my uncle, starts a friendly game.
Hollow Jack the winner takes a gain.

From the beginning my uncle started to win
Them Texas cowboys, they was as mad as sin
Some said he's cheating. Aw, but that can't be!
Because my uncle, he's as honest as me.
And I'm about as honest as a Denver man can be.

One of them cowboys, you know he started to draw.
I grabbed the bottle, slapped him on the jaw
I had to shoot another, now he won't grow old
In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold,
We hightailed it down to Mexico, Mexico, way down to Mexico

God bless cowboys, God bless gold.
God bless my uncle, God rest his soul.
He taught me well, boys, taught me all I know.
Taught me so well that I grabbed the gold
Left him lying there by the side of the road

It showed me how to laugh and how to cry
It introduced me to some friends of mine and brightened up some days
It helped me make it through some lonely nights
Oh, what a friend to have on a cold and lonely night

This old guitar gave me my lovely lady
It opened up her eyes and ears to me
It brought us close together I guess it broke her heart
It opened up the space for us to be
What a lovely place, a lovely space to be

This old guitar gave me my life, my living
All the things you know I love to do
To serenade the stars that shine from a sunny mountainside
Most of all to sing my songs for you
I love to sing these songs for you, yes, I do, you know
I love to sing my songs for you

Somewhere in Alaska, somewhere in the sun
I hear them singing a song for all lovers
A song for the two hearts beating only as one

Imagine the morning no longer alone
The arms of another, a place to belong
No longer the struggle, no longer the night
And ever becoming in the quickening light

To see the darkness, to listen within
To answer in kindness, to ever begin
To ever be gentle, to always be strong
To walk in the wonder, to live in the song

 In a place of enchantment where the wild things are known
Will the future remember when the lovers are gone?

It seems that the mind runs wild when you're all alone
The way that it could be
The ways that it should be
Thing's I'd do differently if I could do them again

I've always loved spring time, the passing of winter
The green of the new leaves and life going on
The promise of morning
The long days of summer
Warm nights of loving her beneath the bright stars

I'm just an old cowboy from high Colorado
Too old to ride anymore, too blind to see
I sleep in the city now
Away from my mountains
Away from the cabin we always called home

I dream I left there
On an old Palomino
Whispering Jesse rode right by my side
I long to hold her
To hear her soft breathing
The touch of her cool hands on my fevered brow

Whispering Jesse still rides in the mountains
Still sings in the canyons
Still lives in my heart

John Denver,"A frosty Christmas Eve, when the stars where shining
I traveled for the home, where westward falls the hill
And for many, many a village, in the darkness of the valley
Distant music reached me, peels of bells were ringing.

Then spread my thoughts to olden times, to that first of Christmases
When shepherds who were watching, heard music in the fields
And they sat there and they marveled, and they knew they could not tell
Whether it were angels, or the bright stars a-singing

But to me heard a far, it was starry music
The singing of the angels, the comfort of our Lord
Words of old that come a traveling, by the riches of the times
And I softly listened, as I stood upon the hill
And I softly listened, as I stood upon the hill

We are born & born again most gracefully
Thus the winds of time will take us
With a sure and steady hand

Antiques would be modern, we would be the rage
Silk would be in fashion, we would dress in lace
Love would be the passion and the saving grace
 
I slept one rainy night with you in Paris
Made up for a thousand wasted years
Dearest Esmeralda, you are magic
I close my eyes and you make love appear
 
Dancing in the shimmer of a crystal chandelier
Shadows singing so low only we could hear
Moving to the glimmer, shaking to the storm
Outside it was raging, but inside it was warm
 
We said goodnight in the candlelight and thunder
Now I wake and find you're never there
I'm becoming old enough to wonder
Happy that I'm still too young to care
 
Masterpieces crumble, empires tumble down
Refugees and fantasies go underground
Romance lasts forever, love don't fade away
They may take our future, but they don't stop yesterday

we were part of some artist's design

Did you think our time together was all gone?
Lady, you've been dreaming, I'm as close as I can be
And I swear to you our time has just begun

Close your eyes and rest your weary mind
I promise I will stay right here beside you
Today our lives were joined, became entwined
I wish that you could know how much I love you

Lady, are you happy? Do you feel the way I do?
Are there meanings that you've never seen before
Lady, my sweet lady, I just can't believe it's true
And it's like I've never, ever loved before

Close your eyes and rest your weary mind
I promise I will stay right here beside you

I felt a bump and heard an 
Oh, beg your pardon
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said 
May I have the next one
In my frightrnrd arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage made of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ever after
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss my pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1996

You know sometimes I can't get to sleep at night
I can't quiet my heart or my mind
I toss and turn, I ache and burn
I get caught in the passing of time

It's like too many miles, too many heartaches
Too much that needs to be done
Yes and too many sidewalks, too many people
Too many hours done

What's on your mind
What's on my mind
Is really quite the same
I've been working so hard
And I'm ready to play
I know just the right game

What's on your mind
Is what's on my mind
That's the way it's gonna be
I'm gonna find me a place I can hide
I want you right next to me

On I've never seen a more beautiful day
It's my favorite time of year
The colors are changing, she's rearranging
And I'm so glad to be here

I've been up and around, I've been lost, I've been found
I've seen love face to face in my dreams
And the things that I know and the things that I show
Are not always just what they seem

What's on your mind
Is what's on my mind
It's just that way
It's like catching a ride
On a beautiful river
Let it carry us all away

What's on your mind
And what's on my mind
Is really nothing new
I want to get you alone
I want to make you my own
Baby, I want to make love with you

What's on your mind
And what's on my mind
Is really quite the same
I've been working so hard
And I'm ready to play
Baby, I know just the right game

What's on your mind
And what's on my mind
Is really nothing new
I want to get you alone
I want to make you my own
Baby, I want to make love with you

This song appears on three albums, and was first released on the John Denver
Album, and has also been released on the Reflections and The Country Roads
Collection Albums.

Born on a quiet morning
Just a dream in someone's eyes
A dream that's like a promise meant to be
Giving rise to speculation
On a place called paradise
If I've ever been there
It's when you were with me

You're so beautiful
I can't believe my eyes
Each time I see you again
You're so beautiful
That I'm in paradise
Each time I see you again

I remember some hidden valley
Where the skies are never still
And alpine meadows burn in the evening light
I remember the path to glory
And the way around the hill
I remember true love's eyes
Shining in the night

You're so beautiful
I can't believe my eyes
Each time I see you again
You're so beautiful
That I'm in paradise
Each time I see you again

And if paradise is everything you see
Then the place you must be coming from
Is ecstasy

You're so beautiful
That I can't believe my eyes
Each time I see you again
You're so beautiful
That I'm in paradise
Each time I see you again

Just want to see you again
I want to be with you again
I just need to love you again
Just wanna touch you again
I just need to love you again
I want to be with you again
Touch you again
Love you again
With you again

",You're So Beautiful,1996
John Denver,"When you asked how I've been here without you
I'd like to say I've been fine and I do
But we both know the truth is hard to come by
And if I told the truth that's not quite true

Some days are diamonds, some days are stones
Sometimes the hard times won't leave me alone
Sometimes a cold wind blows a chill in my bones
Some days are diamonds, some days are stones

Now the face that I see in my mirror
More and more is a stranger to me
More and more I can see there's a danger
In becoming what I never thought I'd be

Driving the cattle over snow covered plains

Ours is the sky and the wide open range

Back in the cities they have different ways
Football and eggnog and Christmas parades
I'll take my blanket, I'll take the reins
It's Christmas for cowboys, wide open plains

A campfire for warmth as we stop for the night
The stars overhead are Christmas tree lights
The wind sings a hymn as we bow down to pray
It's Christmas for cowboys and wide open plains

It's tall in the saddle we spend Christmas Day
Driving the cattle over snow covered plains
So many gifts have been opened today

Daddy, what's a train? Is it something I can ride?
Does it carry lots of grown-up folks and little kids inside?
Is it bigger than our house? Well how can I explain
When my little boy and girl ask me 'Daddy, what's a train?'

When I was just a boy and living by the track
Us kids would gather up the coal in big 'ole gunnysacks
Then we heard the warning sound as the train pulled into view
The engineer would smile and wave as she went rolling through

She blew so loud and clear, we had to cover up our ears
And we counted cars just as high as we could go
I can almost hear the steam those big old drivers scream
A sound my little kids will never know

Daddy, what's a train? Is it something I can ride?
Does it carry lots of grown-up folks and little kids inside?
Is it bigger than our house? Well how can I explain
When my little boy and girl ask me 'Daddy, what's a train?'

I guess the times have changed, kids are different now
'Cause some don't even seem to know that milk comes from a cow
My little boy can tell the names of all the baseball stars
I remember how we memorized the names on railroad cars

The Wabash and the TP, Lackawanna, the IC
The Nichel-Plate and the good old Santa Fe
Just names out of the past, I guess they're fading fast
Every time I hear my little boy say

Daddy, what's a train? Is it something I can ride?
Does it carry lots of grown-up folks and little kids inside?
Is it bigger than our house? Well how can I explain
When my little boy and girl ask me 'Daddy, what's a train?'

We climbed into the car, drove down into town
Right up to the depot house, but no one was around
We searched the yard together for something I could show
But I knew there hadn't been a train for a dozen years or so

All the things I did when I was just a kid
How far away those memories appear
I guess it's plain to see they still mean a lot to me
'Cause my ambition was to be an engineer

Daddy, what's a train? Is it something I can ride?
Does it carry lots of grown-up folks and little kids inside?
Is it bigger than our house? Well how can I explain
When my little boy and girl ask me 'Daddy, what's a train?'

John Denver,"When Jenny was a little girl she only dreamed of trains
She never played with dolls or lacy kinds of things
Jenny counted boxcars instead of countin' sheep
She could go anywhere when she went to sleep

All she ever talked about was gettin' on to ride
She was livin' in another time you could see it in her eyes
Everyday after school she'd head don't to the tracks
Waitin' for the train that was never comin' back

Jenny dreamed of trains
When the nighttime came
Nobody knew how she made it come true
Jenny dreamed of trains

The depot's been boarded up, the rails have turned to rust
There hasn't been a train through here since the mill went bust
No one believed her when she said she heard the train
Said she was just a little girl actin' kinda strange

Jenny dreamed of trains
When the nighttime came
Nobody knew how she made it come true
Jenny dreamed of trains

Jenny laid a penny on the track one day
In God we trust she walked away
The very next mornin' all that she could find
Was a little piece of copper squashed flatter than a dime

Nobody knew how she made it come true
Jenny dreamed of trains

Moved to Tucumcan when the ironwork got show
He was cornbread and hard scrabble and scratching for every dime

Now he's The Last Hobo
Riding the last boxcar
On the last freight train
Leaving here

Now he's The Last Hobo
Riding the last boxcar
On the last freight train 
Away from here 

He tried his hand at lots of jobs 
And he did 'em all with pride
From shoeing mules to driving trucks, 
He mastered what he tried
It must have been Ramona, 
She was all he cared about
When she ran away and left him 
You could see the fire go out

Now he's The Last Hobo
Riding the last boxcar
On the last freight train 
Away from here

We hardly ever see him
Once or twice and he would stay a day or two
He'd ask about Ramona
Then he'd say that he was only passing through 
Now he knows every railroad bull along the right of way
And every hobo jungle from New York to Santa Fe
He's looked for his Ramona on the far side of the hill
Now his sun is sinking lower and he's looking for her still

John Denver,"There was a little railroad train with loads and loads of toys
All starting out to find a home with little girls and boys
And as that little railroad train began to chug along
The little engine up in front was heard to sing this song
Choo, choo, choo, choo
Choo, choo, choo, choo
I feel so good today
Oh hear the track
Oh clickety clack
I'll go my merry way
 
The little train went rousing on so fast it seemed to fly
Until it reached a mountain that went almost to the sky
The Little engine moaned and groaned and huffed and puffed away
But halfway to the top it just gave up and seemed to say
I can't go
I can't go 
I'm weary as can be
I can't go
I can't go
This job is not for me
 
The toys got out to push but all in vain alas alack
And then a great big engine came a whistling down the track
They asked if it would kindly pull them up the mountain side
But with a high and mighty sneer it scornfully replied	I 
Don't bother me
Don't bother me 
To pull the likes of you
Don't bother me
Don't bother me
I've better things to do
 
The toys all started crying 'cause that engine was so mean
And then there came another one, the smallest ever seen
And though it seemed that she could hardly pull herself along
She hitched on to the train and as she pulled she sang this song
I think I can
I think I can
I think I have a plan
And I can do most anything
If I only think I can
 
Then up that great big mountain with the cars all full of toys
And soon they reached the waiting arms of little girls and boy
And though that ends the story it will do you lots of good
To take a lesson from the little engine that could
Just think you can
Just think you can
Just have that understood
And very soon you'll start to say

John Denver,"I caught a ride on the Dreamland Express last night
I was sailing on an ocean of blue
And right there by my side, much to my surprise, was you

I said, come on over baby, let me look in your eyes
Let me see the very heart of you
And I couldn't believe it, or conceive that my dream would come true

'Cause you said, hey there sweet daddy, everything is alright
You know for miles there's not a telephone line
There's not a soul to disturb us
Just come and be mine

You said, let me be the end of your rainbow
Let me be the stars up above
Let me be the one that you long for baby
Let me be the one that you love, oh
Let me be the one that you love

But now it's four in the mornin', I can't sleep
I can't seem to get you out of my mind
I keep tossin' and turnin', I'm yearnin' for the sun to shine

I'd like to send you a ticket on the Dreamland Express
And take you far away with me
I've got a vision of heaven, you livin' there with me

Let me be the end of your rainbow
Let me be the stars up above
Let me be the one that you long for baby
Let me be the one that you love, oh, oh
Let me be the one that you love

Let me be the end of your rainbow
Let me be the stars up above
Let me be the one that you long for baby
Let me be the one that you love, oh
Let me be the one that you love",Dreamland Express,1997
John Denver,"There are dreams that sail away to sea
And some that stay at home
There are dreams in need of company
And some that stand alone
There are dreams that stay inside all day
And never see the light
And if dreams come true
I swear to you
I'll dream of you tonight
 
In a corner bar the local star
Destroys a passing chord
He sits behind a Mason jar
And dreams of his reward
Then he takes his break
And he counts his take
A dollar buys a beer
A quarter of his life is gone
And what's he doing here?
 
Times are hard
The old backyard is covered in cement
The people seem afraid to dream
And dream don't cost a cent
 
There are dreams that stay inside all day
And never see the light
And if dreams come true
I swear to you
I'll dream of you tonight
And if dreams come true
I swear to you
I'll dream of you tonight",Dreams,1997
John Denver,"The sun is slowly fadin' in the Western sky
Sometimes it takes forever for the day to end
Sometimes it takes a lifetime
Sometimes I think I'll never see the sun again
 
In the east a shaded moon is hangin' lazily
I do believe I saw the old man smile
I do believe I did
I do believe he's been hangin' all the while
 
I think it's kind of interesting the way things get to be
The way that people work with their machines
Serenity's a long time comin' to me
The fact I don't believe I know what it means
 
There's a heavy smog between me and my mountains
It's enough to make a grown man sit and cry
It's enough to make you wonder
It's enough to make the world roll up and die
 
I think it's kind of interesting the way things get to be
The way that people work with their machines
Serenity's a long time comin' to me
The fact I don't believe I know what it means any more
 
When the sun is slowly fadin' in the Western sky
Sometimes it takes forever the day to end
Sometimes it takes a lifetime
Sometimes I think I'll never see the sun again

John Denver,"All of her days have gone soft and cloudy
All of her dreams have gone dry
All of her nights have gone sad and shady
She's getting ready to fly

Fly away, fly away (fly away)

Life in the city can make you crazy
The sounds of the sand and the sea (I'm of the sea)
Life in a high-rise can make you hungry
For things that you can't even see

Fly away, fly away (fly away)

In this whole world there's nobody as lonely as she (nobody as lonely as me)
There's nowhere to go and there's nowhere
That she'd rather be (I rather be)

She's looking for signs of the spring (where is the spring?)
She listens for laughter and sounds of dancing
She listens for any old things

John Denver,"Well I guess that you probably know by now
I was one who wanted to fly
I wanted to ride on that arrow of fire right up into heaven
And I wanted to go for every man
Every child, every mother of children
I wanted to carry the dreams of all people right up to the stars
 
And I prayed that I'd find an answer there
Or maybe I would find a song
Giving a voice to all of the hearts that cannot be heard
And for all of the ones who live in fear
And all of those who stand apart
My being there would bring us a little step closer together
 
They were flying for me
They were flying for everyone
They were trying to see a brighter day for each and everyone
 
They gave us their light
They gave us their spirit and all they could be
They were flying for me
They were flying for me
 
And I wanted to wish upon the Milky Way
And dance upon a falling star
I wanted to give myself and free myself, and join myself with it all
 
Given the chance to dream, it can be done
The promise of tomorrow is real
Children of spaceship Earth
The future belongs to us all
 
She was flying for me

John Denver,"Inch by inch, row by row
Gonna make this garden grow
All it takes is a rake and a hoe
And a piece of fertile ground
 
Inch by inch, row by row
Someone bless these seeds I sow
Someone warm them from below
Till the rain comes tumbling down
 
Pulling weeds and picking stones
Man is made of dreams and bones
Feel the need to grow my own
Cause the time is close at hand
 
Painful rain, sun and rain
Find my way in nature's chain
Tune my body and my brain
To the music from the land
 
Plant your rows straight and long
Temper them with prayer and song
Mother Earth will make you strong
If you give her love and care

From his perch in yonder tree
In my garden I'm as free
As that feathered thief up there",Garden Song,1997
John Denver,"When I was a little bitty boy just up off the floor
We used to go down to grandma's house every month end or so
We'd have chicken pie, country ham
Homemade butter on the bread
But the best darn thing about grandma's house
Was the great big feather bed

It was nine feet high and six feet wide
And soft as a downy chick
It was made from the feathers of forty 'leven geese
Took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick

It could hold eight kids and four hound dogs
And a piggy we stole from the shed
We didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun
On grandma's feather bed

After supper we'd sit around the fire, the old folks'd spit and chew
Pa would talk about the farm and the war
And granny'd sing a ballad or two
And I'd sit and listen and watch the fire till the cobwebs filled my head
Next thing I'd know I'd wake up in the morning
In the middle of the old feather bed

It was nine feet high and six feet wide
And soft as a downy chick
It was made from the feathers of forty 'leven geese
Took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick

It could hold eight kids and four hound dogs
And a piggy we stole from the shed
We didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun
On grandma's feather bed

Well, I love my ma and I love my pa, I love granny and grandpa too
I've been fishin' with my uncles, I wrestled my cousin
I even kissed Aunt Lou, ew!
But if I ever had to make a choice I guess it oughta be said
That I'd trade them all plus the gal down the road
For grandma's feather bed
I'd trade them all plus the gal down the road

It was nine feet high and six feet wide
And soft as a downy chick
It was made from the feathers of forty 'leven geese
Took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick

John Denver,"I haven't seen all there is to see
But I've seen quite a bit
Some things I'll always remember
Some things I wish that I could forget
I haven't quite been around the world
But I've been around the block
I know that distances are meaningless
Like the hands that move around a clock
And I know that love is everywhere
Always safe, always true
And exactly where it comes from
Is where it's going to

Your heart to mine
My heart to yours
Talk about opening windows
Talk about opening doors
My heart to yours
Your heart to mine
Love is a light that shines
From heart to heart

Here I am sitting in old Hong Kong
The harbor and the lights
They're like diamonds in the heavens
Enough to brighten the darkest of nights
There's another side to sorrow
As there is to everything
Like the other side of lonely
Is falling in love again
And then you know that there's an answer
To the suffering we see
And though it isn't easy
It's still as simple as you and me
And you'll know that love is everywhere
Always safe, always true
And exactly where it comes from
Is where it's going to

Your heart to mine
My heart to yours
Talk about opening windows
Talk about opening doors

John Denver,"This song appears on two albums, and was first released on the One World Album. It has also been released on The Country Roads Collection album.

Funny thing about this little heart of mine
All the ways that it can say
(I love you)
Longer than forever
Till the end of time
No matter baby come what may
(I love you)
Look at me now sittin' all by myself
Face another sleepless night all alone
All I look forward to is lying here living this song

I can't escape thinking every day about you
Can't escape wishing dear you were still mine
Can't escape thinking maybe I still love you
Can't escape caring for you all of the time

Listen to the music on the radio
Top forty hits of yesterday
(I love you)
Leavin' on a Jet Plane
Blowin' in the Wind
The Silly Games that People Play
(I love you)
Each of them carries your memory still
I can still see that look in your eyes
The one that preceded your kisses and followed your sighs

I can't escape thinking every day about you
Can't escape wishing dear you were still mine
Can't escape thinking maybe I still love you
Can't escape caring for you all of the time

Every rain in the morning reminds me of you
Every night when it's cold outside
Every time that I ache inside
(I love you)
(I love you)

Sometimes I wish it was ten years ago
We were starting all over again
Yet the way that I feel is much more than just remembering when

I can't escape thinking every day about you
Can't escape wishing dear you were still mine
Can't escape thinking maybe I still love you
Can't escape caring for you all of the time

All of the time
All of the time

",I Can't Escape,1997
John Denver,"Another day is over
I'm on my way home
Knowing you'll be waiting
Is all I need to know

'Cause I'm in the mood to be desired
Wrap your arms around me
I'm in the mood let's build a fire
Till the embers retire
We'll be lost in a world of ecstasy

Forget about your troubles
Forget about my woes
You're the one who comforts me
Whenever I feel low

'Cause I'm in the mood to be desired
Wrap your arms around me
I'm in the mood let's build a fire
Till the embers retire
We'll be lost in a world of ecstasy

You're everything I could imagine
You fill me up with such passion
Eternity is not long enough for you and me

Still you would hear my tune
I'd give you a day, without a time
So it won't end too soon

Anything, I would do
And that really is my point of view
If ever, my darling in my life
I ever had a chance to love you

I'd build you a world made of the dream
That dances on your head
Take a rainbow with colors bright
To hang over your head

Anything, I would do
And that really is my point of view
If ever, my darling in my life
I ever had a chance to love you

Fate's been waiting for the right time
To put us in each other's arms
But why should we sit and waste time
To start right now would do no harm

Ooh, give me a sign and I will show you
The magic of when I speak
Open your heart, let me come in
My love is yours to keep

John Denver,"In the grand way she loves me
The way she holds me close to rest with me
And to know she is my life to me
My empty days are done
My running days are run
And for the first time I love the morning

Burning sundown, coloured autumn trees
Mountain rivers, country livers put my mind at ease
And to realize such perfect harmonies
I'm standing in the dawn
Of a new day coming on
And I'm looking for no tomorrow

I can still hear the lonely sound
The engines of a midnight freight train northward bound
And to feel my life slowly losing ground
I never quite understood
And it seems like I've just seen dreaming",In the Grand Way,1997
John Denver,"You came looking for the answers
To some questions on his mind
Seeking truth and understanding
In the hope that he would find
A way to better serve his brothers
And his sisters in the sun
Sharing all that he has given
Giving all to everyone

Come and listen to the story
Of a journey once begun
Of a people and their plenty
And their season in the sun
And how they gave themselves to symbols
And things that they could hold
Living lives in desperation
In the fear of letting go

It amazes me
And I know the wind will surely one day
Blow it all away
It amazes me
And I'm so very grateful that you made the world this way

For our plans have come together now
Where do we go from here
Will our differences divide us
Must we always live in fear
For there are things that we must move through
Some things to cast aside
But our father watches over us
Our mother will provide

It amazes me
And I know the wind will someday surely
Blow it all away
It amazes me
And I'm so very grateful that you made the world this way

John Denver,"This song appears on two albums, and was first released on the It's About Time album, and has also been released on the Country Classics album.

There's a full moon over India and Gandhi lives again
Who's to say you have to lose for someone else to win
In the eyes of all the people the look is much the same
For the first is just the last one when you play a deadly game

It's about time we realize it we're all in this together
It's about time we find out it's all of us or none
It's about time we recognize it these changes in the weather
It's about time, it's about changes and it's about time

There's a light in the Vatican window for all the world to see
And a voice cries in the wilderness and sometimes he speaks for me
I suppose I love him most of all when he kneels to kiss the land
With his lips upon our Mother's breast he makes his strongest stand

It's about time we start to see it the Earth is our only home
It's about time we start to face it we can't make it here all alone
It's about time we start to listen to the voices in the wind
It's about time, it's about changes and it's about time

There's a man who is my brother, I just don't know his name
But I know his home and family because I know we feel the same
And it hurts me when he's hungry and when his children cry
I too am a father and that little one is mine

It's about time we begin to turn the world around
It's about time we start to make it the dream we've always known
It's about time we start to live the family of man
It's about time, it's about changes and it's about time
It's about peace and it's about plenty and it's about time
It's about you and me together and it's about time

",It's About Time,1997
John Denver,"Usually in the morning I'm filled with sweet belonging
And everything is beautiful to see
Even when it's raining, the sound of heaven singing
Is simply joyful music to me

Sometimes I feel like a sad song
Like I'm all alone without you

So many different places, a million smiling faces
Life is so incredible to me
Especially to be near you and how it is to touch you
Oh paradise was made for you and me

I know that life goes on just perfectly
And everything is just the way that it should be
Still there are times when my heart feels like breaking
Anywhere is where I'd rather be

Oh and in the night time I know that it's the right time
To hold you close and say I love you so
To have someone to share with
And someone I can care with
And that is why I wanted you to know

Like I'm all alone without you, without you

John Denver,"Almost exactly a year ago
I came here for the very first time
Looking up at the Spanish window
From a trail on the edge of the timberline
I've been off on a journey to find myself
Maybe find my way back home
Been many an hour all by myself
In the darkest of nights
I was never ever alone

Back in the San Juan Mountains again
On a ride with some good old boys
Telling stories around a campfire
The sound of laughter is the loudest noise
There's something in a night in the wilderness
It's a magical thing to me
Like the sky is just a little bit brighter
And your life is everything that you'd like it to be

There'll be snow on the passes tomorrow
You can feel it in the chill of the wind
Let the rain wash away all my sorrow
Today is the day that my life starts all over again

I guess that it's just about over now
Everything is about to change
Everything is a brand new number, darling
Everything is a brand new game
And it's funny I could even call you that

Ah, but time is the master of healing
Love is the master of everything that we do

All the things I've done and how it's been
And I can't help believing in my own mind
I know I'm gonna hate to see it end

I've seen a lot of sunshine
Slept out in the rain
Spent a night or two all on my own
I've known my lady's pleasures
Had myself some friends
And spent a time or two in my own home

And I have to say it now
It's been a good life all in all
It's really fine to have a chance to hang around
And lie there by the fire
And watch the evening tire
While all my friends and my old lady
Sit and pass the pipe around

And talk of poems and prayers and promises
And things that we believe in
How sweet it is to love someone
How right it is to care
How long it's been since yesterday
And what about tomorrow
And what about our dreams
And all the memories we share

The days they pass so quickly now
Nights are seldom long
And time around me whispers when it's cold
The changes somehow frighten me
Still I have to smile
It turns me on to think 
Of growing old
For though my life's been good to me
There's still so much to do
So many things my mind has never known
I'd like to raise a family
I'd like to sail away
And dance across the mountains on the moon

I have to say it now
It's been a good life all in all
It's really fine to have the chance to hang around

John Denver,"I've got rippling waters to wake me to the morning, my woman in love,
Tall pine trees are pointing us easily to Heaven above.
Blue Spruce flaming on the grate in the evening, takes the chill away fine,
Cut the telephone line, the story's the same.
There's a worn red chair by the window that she found at a sale down the way,
When some old woman said that they needed more room for the winter.
People like pulling out the stuffing when they sit down, so it passes the time,
Cut the telephone line, the story's the same.

Ooh, like a bubble on a windy day start to flutter when I hear you say,
That you feel too good to go away and you make me feel fine.
And you made the world a warmer place, by the sparkle of your diamond face.
On a gray spot, put a little lace and you make me feel fine,
Warm as a mountain sunshine, on the edge of a snowline, in a meadow of Columbine.

Oh, little Jennifer, I'd give a penny for what you've got on your mind,
Seems like most of the time you're lying there dreaming.
Maybe in your vision you see how our mission is, slightly less than defined,
Cut the telephone line, the story's the same.
Now rippling waters flow through the ceiling and the walls and they're keeping me warm
And the closest I've been to my family for days is my music.
But to silently stare in the morning sky is like hearing her calling my name,
Cut the telephone line, the story's the same.

John Denver,"He was born in the summer of his 27th year
Coming home to a place he'd never been before
He left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again
You might say he found a key for every door

When he first came to the mountains his life was far away
On the road and hanging by a song
But the string's already broken and he doesn't really care
It keeps changing fast and it don't last for long

But the Colorado rocky mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
The shadow from the starlight is softer than a lullabye
Rocky mountain high (Colorado)

He climbed cathedral mountains, he saw silver clouds below
He saw everything as far as you can see
And they say that he got crazy once and he tried to touch the sun
And he lost a friend but kept his memory

Now he walks in quiet solitude the forest and the streams
Seeking grace in every step he takes
His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand
The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake

And the Colorado rocky mountain high
I've seen it raining fire in the sky
You can talk to God and listen to the casual reply
Rocky mountain high

Now his life is full of wonder but his heart still knows some fear
Of a simple thing he cannot comprehend
Why they try to tear the mountains down to bring in a couple more
More people, more scars upon the land

And the Colorado rocky mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
I know he'd be a poorer man if he never saw an eagle fly

John Denver,"So many years ago, I can't remember now
Someone was waiting for me
I had the answers to all of my questions
Love was so easy to see, I didn't know

When I was younger, I should have known better
I thought nothing was new
Through all the spaces, and all of the changes
What I lost sight of was you
I didn't know, I didn't know

I could see you in singing skies and dancing waters
laughing children growing old
And in the heart and in the spirit
And in the truth when it is told

My life became shady, and I grew afraid
And I needed to find my way home
I just couldn't see you, I thought that I'd lost you
I never felt so much alone, are you still with me

Somehow in reason, I lost sight of seasons
I'm growing out, growing in
Sometimes in evenings, when daylight was needed
I thought I'd never see you again
Are you still with me, are you still with me

I'm with you in singing skies and dancing waters
laughing children growing old
And in the heart and in the spirit
And in the truth when it is told

If my faith should falter
And I should forsake you, and find myself turning away
Will you still be there, will you still be there

And in the truth when it is told",Singing Skies and Dancing Waters,1997

I'd like to say I've been fine and I do

Sometimes the hard times won't leave me alone

More and more is a stranger to me

John Denver,"Well, I'm weary and tired, I've done my day's riding
Nighttime is rolling my way
The sky's all on fire and the light's slowly fading
Peaceful and still ends the day

Out on the trail night birds are calling
Singing their wild melody
Down in the canyon cottonwood whispers
A Song of Wyoming for me

Well, I've wandered around the town and the city
Tried to figure the how and the why
Well, I've stopped all my scheming
I'm just drifting and dreaming

Watching the river roll by
Here comes that big old prairie moon rising
Shining down bright as can be
Up on the hill there's a coyote singing
A Song of Wyoming for me

Now it's whiskey and tobacco and bitter black coffee
A lonesome old dogie am I
But waking up on the range
Lord I feel like an angel

Free like I almost could fly
Drift like a cloud out over the badlands
Sing like a bird in the tree
The wind in the sage sounds like heaven singing

From dirty words and muddy cells your clothes are soiled and stained
But the dirty words and the mud of cells will soon be judged insane
So only stop and rest yourself and you'll be off again

Oh take off your thirsty boots
And stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh
And maybe I can try
Lookin' for the evenin'
And the mornin' in your eyes

Then tell me of the ones you saw
As far as you could see
Across the plains from field to town
Marchin' to be free
And of the rusted prison gates that tumble by degree
Like laughing children one by one
They look like you and me

So take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh and maybe I can try
Just lookin' for the evenin' and the mornin' in your eyes

I know you are no stranger down the crooked rainbow trial
From dancing cliff edge shattered sills to slander shackled jails
Where the voices drift up from below as walls are bein' scaled
Yes all of this and more my friend your song shall not be failed

Oh take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary, from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh, and maybe I can try

The wind is the bearer of bad and good tidings
The weaver of darkness, the bringer of dawn
The wind gives the rain, then builds us a rainbow
The wind is the singer when sang the first song

The wind is a twister of anger and warning
The wind brings the fragrance of freshly mown hay
The wind is a racer, a wild stallion running
The sweet taste of love on a slow summer's day

The wind knows the songs of the cities and canyons
The thunder of mountains, the roar of the sea
The wind is the taker and giver of mornings
The wind is the symbol of all that is free

Follow her summons when she calls again

Lift up your voice then and sing with the wind",Windsong,1997

Western Oklahoma nineteen forty three
I always felt grateful to live in the land of the free
I gave up my father to South Korea
The mind of my brother to Vietnam
Now there's a banker who says I must give up my land
There are four generations of blood in this topsoil
Four generations of love on this farm
Before I give up I would gladly give up my right arm

Why keep on feeding the war machine
We take it right out of the mouths of our babies
Take it away from the hands of the poor
Tell me, what are we making weapons for

He was so like my father, he was so much like me
To be a good comrade was the best that he dreamed he could be
He gave up his future to revolution
His life to a battle that just can't be won
For this is not living, to live at the point of a gun
I remember the nine hundred days of Leningrad
The sound of the dying, the cut of the cold
I remember the moments I prayed I would never grow old

Why keep on feeding the war machine
We take it right out of the mouths of our babies
Take it away from the hands of the poor
Tell me, what are we making weapons for

A slave to the ways of the powers that be
And I fear for my children, as I fear for the for the future I see
Tell me how can it be we're still fighting each other
What does it take for a people to learn
If our song is not sung as a chorus, we surely will burn

As we go marching, marching
We battle too for men
For they are women's children
And we mother them again
Our lives shall not be sweetened
From birth until life closes
Hearts starve as well as bodies
Give us bread, but give us roses
 
As we go marching, marching
We bring the greater days

Means the rising of the race

With the things they don't believe in

By giving it all for the things that they believe

When I was just a wee little boy, full of health and joy
One Christmas morning I received a marvellous little toy
A wonder to behold it was, with many colors bright
And the first trime I laid eyes on it, it became my heart's delight

It went zip when it moved
Bop when it stopped
Whirrr when it stood still
I never knew just what it was
And I guess I never will

The first time that I picked it up I had a big surprise
For right on it's bottom were two big buttons
That looked like big green eyes
I first pushed one, then the other, then I twisted it's lid
And when I set it down again, this is what it did

It went zip when it moved
Bop when it stopped
Whirrr when it stood still
I never knew just what it was
And I guess I never will

It first marched left, then marched right
And then marched under a chair
And when I looked where it had gone it wasn't even there
I started to cry, my daddy laughed, he knew that I would find
When I turned around my marvelous toy chugging from behind

It went zip when it moved
Bop when it stopped
Whirrr when it stood still
I never knew just what it was
And I guess I never will

The years have passed too quickly it seems, I have my own little boy
And yesterday I gave to him my marvelous little toy
His eyes nearly popped right out of his head, he gave a squeal of glee
Neither one of us knows just what it is but he loves it just like me

It still goes zip when it moves
Bop when it stops
Whirrr when it stands still
I never knew just what it was
And I guess I never will
I never knew just what it was
And I guess I never will

John Denver,"Played a wedding for the money and I wish I could have told the bride and groom
Just what I think of marriage, what's in store after the honeymoon.
I was rumbling through the verses about how men and women ought to live apart,
How a promise never made could not be broken and would never break a heart.

Suddenly from out of nowhere this little girl came spinning across the floor
Her crinolines were billowing beneath the skirt of calico she wore.
As her joy fell on the honored guests each one of them was drawn into her dream
And they laughed and stamped and clapped their hands and hollered at her, dance little jean!

They said:
Dance little jean, this day is for you,
Two people that you love stood up to say 'i do.'
Dance little jean, the prayer that you had was answered today-
Your momma's marrying your dad.

Well this cynic's heart just melted as I figured what this get together meant
And how it ended years of tears and sad confusions that the little girl had spent.
They told the band to pack it up about the time the couple cut the cake
But we stayed and we played all night long for love and laughs and little jeanie's sake

We played:
Dance little jean, this day is for you,
Two people that you love stood up to say 'i do.'
Dance little jean, the prayer that you had was answered today-
Your momma's marrying your dad.

We sang:

You could talk to me without speaking
You would look at me and I'd know

Days, I think of you
And remember the lies we told
In the night, the love we knew
The things we shared when our hearts were beating together

Days, that were so few
Full of love and you
Gone, the days are gone now
Days, that seem so wrong now

Life, won't be the same
Without you to hold again in my arms
To ease the pain and remember
When our love was a reason for living

The grandest lady I had ever seen
Outside the heavy rain had grounded all the planes
So I asked her if she'd like some company
In my rhinestone studded suit, my cowboy hat and boots
I must have been a sight for her to see
But she said, ""pull up a chair"" as she fumbled with her hair
A more unlikely pair you'll never see

I was Mogen David wine, she was Chablis '59
But there we sat, the cowboy and the lady
She was evenings at the opera, and summers in Paree
I was Grand Ole Opry, Nashville, Tennessee
The cowboy and the lady, as different as could be
But it seemed so right that rainy night in Tennessee

And somewhere in between her Harvey's Bristol Cream
And the beer I drank and the easy company
We somehow came together, for a night of stormy weather

There's a little bit of cowboy in the lady

From the first time I flew with my father a singing
I knew that I'd wind up a bush pilot's wife

We sleep near the sound of a slow running river
And wake up most mornings to a drizzling rain
And we face every day like the first or the last one
With nothing to lose and heaven to gain

Here's to Alaska, here's to the people
Here's to the wild and here's to the free
Here's to my life in a chosen country
Here's to Alaska and me

Oh, for the fire on a cold winter's night
And once more to gaze at the great northern lights
For all of the beauty my children will see
Here's to Alaska and me

Here's to the wild and here's to the free

John Denver,"A country girl in Paris, moonlight on the Seine
Memories of Tennessee, Nashville in the rain
It's such a contradiction, a heart that's filled with pain
A country girl in Paris, dreamin' Nashville in the rain

She walks along the boulevard, Champs Alysee
Thinks about a country boy three thousand miles away
Pride is such a hard thing, it's such a price to pay
To be all alone in Paris with true love so far away

Up upon Mont Martre when she stops to rest awhile
All the artists look at her and they long to paint her smile
For even in her sorrow there's something in her eyes
That makes the young men jealous, makes the old men sigh

They say the loss of innocence is always linked to pain
For once the heart is opened nothing ever is the same
And so the evening lends itself to lovers and romance
The way to heal a broken heart is to give true love
One more chance

One Sunday morning as I was walking
By Brisbane Waters I chance to stray
I heard a convict his fait bewhaling
As on the sunny riverbank he lay

I am a native of Erin, Ireland
But banished now from my native shore
They stole me from my independence
And from the maiden whom I do adore

I've been a prisoner at Port Macquarie
At Norfolk Island and Emu Plains
At Castle Ule and Curstune Garbby 
At all these settlements I've been enchained

But of all places of condemnation
And penal stations in New South Wales
To Moreton Bay I have found no equal
Excessive tyranny each day prevails

For three long years I was beastly treated
And heavy irons on my legs I wore
My back from flogging was lacerated
And oft times covered with my crimson gore

And many a man from downright starvation
Lies smouldering now beneath the cave
And Captain Logan he had us mangled
On the triangles of Moreton Bay

Like the Egyptians and ancient Hebrews
We were oppressed under Logan's yoh
Till a native black lying bare and ambush
Did deal out tyrant with his mortal stroke

My fellow prisoners be exhilerated
Let all such monsters like death shall find
And when from bondage we're extricated
Our former suffering shall will fade from mind

It's a long and a dusty road.
It's a hard and a heavy load
And the folks we meet ain't always kind.

Some are bad and some are good.
Some have done the best they could.
Some have tried to ease our troubling mind.

Chorus:
And I can't help but wonder where I'm bound, where I'm bound.
Can't help but wonder where I'm bound.

I have traveled across this land
Just a-doing the best I can.
Tryin' to find what I was meant to do.

And the faces that I see
Are as worried as can be.
Looks like they've been wonderin', too.

Chorus

I had a buddy, way back home,
But he started out to roam
And I hear he's out by Monterey,

And sometimes, when I've had a few,
His voice comes singin' through
And I'm a-goin' out to see him some old day.

Chorus

If you see us passin' by
And you sit and you wonder why
And you wish that you were a rambler, too.

Nail your shoes to the kitchen floor,
Lace 'em up, bar the door
And thank the stars for the roof that's over you.

Chorus

And I can't help but wonder where I'm bound, where I'm bound,
Can't help but wonder where I'm bound.

Here to save our country from a communistic plot

And the day we get Red Skelton won't that be a victory
Oh we're the John Birch Society, the John Birch Society

But the John Birch Society knows he spilled the beans
He keeps on preaching brotherhood, but we know what he means

John Denver,"Did you ever hear the story of the Christmas tree?
Who just didn't want to change the show
He liked living in the woods and playing with squirrels
He liked bicycles and snow

He liked wolves and eagles and grizzly bears
And critters and creatures that crawled
Why bugs were some of his very best friends
Spiders and ants and all

Now that's not to say that he ever looked down
On a vision of twinkled lights
Or on mirrored bubbles and peppermint canes
And a thousand other delights

And he often had dreams of tiny reindeer
And a jolly old man in a sleigh
Full of toys and presents and wonderful things
And a story of Christmas day

Oh, Alfie believed in Christmas alright
He was full of Christmas cheer
All of each and every day
And all throughout the year

To Him it was more than a special time
Much more than a special day
It was more than a beautiful story
It was a special kind of way

You see some folks have never heard a jingle bell ring
And they've never heard of Santa Claus
They've never heard the story of the Son Of God
And that made Alfie pause

Did that mean that they'd never know of peace on earth
Or the brotherhood of man
Or know how to love, or know how to give
If they can't, no one can

You see, life is a very special kind of thing
Not just for a chosen few
But for each and every living, breathing thing
Not just me and you

So when you're at Christmas prayers this year
Alfie asked me if I'd ask you
Say a prayer for the wind and the water and the wood
And those who live there too

I can hardly stand to look at you it makes me want to cry
Get your tongue out of my mouth because I'm kissing you goodbye

Oh, I suppose I'll never know why things turned out this way
And why the one you love the most is the one you drove away?
Yes, and I suppose I'll never, ever really understand
How I could think that you'd make me a happy married man

So now I sit and contemplate the reason for it all
The climb to heights of ecstasy, the failure and the fall
If a broken heart is purposeful it's in the lesson learned
But no matter what the reason is it hurts when you get burned

Now I don't care, I don't think I'll ever love again
Kemosabe used to mean ""a good and trusted friend""
But now it stands for therapy and all the tears I cry
Get your tongue out of my mouth because I'm kissing you goodbye
Bye, bye goodbye
Get your tongue out of my mouth because I'm kissing you goodbye

John Denver,"Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Nighttime would find me in Rosa's cantina
Music would play and Felina would whirl

Blacker than night were the eyes of Felina
Wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was deep for this Mexican maiden
I was in love but in vain I could tell

One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing
With wicked Felina, the girl that I loved

So in anger I challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor
Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance, and that was to run

Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I caught a good one, it looked like it could run
Up on its back and away I did ride

Just as fast as I could from the West Texas town of El Paso
Out to the badlands of New Mexico

Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life, nothing is left
It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death
I saddled up and away I did go
Riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet will find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart

I can see Rosa's cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Felina I go

Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me
I have to make it to Rosa's back door

Something is dreadfully wrong, for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
I'm getting weary, unable to ride

But my love for Felina is strong and I rise where I've fallen
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

From out of nowhere Felina has found me
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss, then Felina goodbye.",El Paso,2002
John Denver,"Well life on the farm is kinda laid back
Ain't much an old country boy like me can't hack

Well, my fiddle was my daddy's till the day he died
And he took me by the hand and held me close to his side
Said, ""live a good life and play the fiddle with pride
And thank God you're a country boy""

Well, my daddy taught me young how to hunt and how to whittle
Taught me how to work and play a tune on the fiddle
Taught me how to love and how to give just a little
And thank God I'm a country boy

The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
'Til he appeared and the soul felt
Its worth
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees, oh hear
The angel voices
Oh night divine, oh night when Christ was born

John Denver,"Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
Rudolph, with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?
Then how the reindeer loved him
And they shouted out with glee
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history

When people pass by her tent, they always stop and take a double-glimpse

I wish her narrow quirt always whips me gently

John Denver,"There was never a doubt, never a doubt in my mind
We weren't meant to be lonely
Never a doubt I knew that I'd find you some day
There was never a doubt, after all of those nights alone
All those desperate mornings
Never a doubt, there was never a doubt in my mind

I suppose there have been times when you felt like a room filled with darkness
Not a window around
There must have been moments you felt you were truly alone
Then again each  of us knows, in a night of unbearable sadness
Still a light can be found
In each morning the promise that someday your true love will come

I suppose there are some people who never believe in the magic
Oh the magic of love
They think nothing is precious and life is just pleasure and pain
Then again each of us knows, when a heart has been broken it's tragic
Oh the magic of love
Even that which is broken with love can be mended again

All the things that you fear, at the most they mean nothing
All the sorrow and sadness can just disappear

There was never a doubt, never a doubt in my mind
We weren't meant to be lonely
Never a doubt I knew that I'd find you some day

John Denver,"Horses are creatures who worship the earth
As they gallop on feet of ivory
Constrained by the wonder of dying and birth
The horses still run, they are free

My body is merely the shell of my soul
But the flesh must be given its due
Like a pony that carries its rider back home
Like an old friend who's tried and been true

I had a vision of eagles and horses
High on a ridge in a race with the wind
Going higher and higher, faster and faster
On eagles and horses I'm flying again

Eagles inhabit the heavenly heights
They know neither limit nor bound
They're the guardian angels of darkness and light
They see all and hear every sound

My spirit will never be broken or caught
For the soul is a free flying thing
Like an eagle that needs neither comfort nor thought
To rise up on glorious wings

Try to break some chains
And if the truth is told
They will never come again

Never find a better way

And I have to say it now
It's been a good life all in all
It's really fine
To have a chance to hang around
And lie there by the fire
And watch the evening tire
While all my friends and my old lady
Sit and pass the pipe around

And talk of poems and prayers and promises
And things that we believe in
How sweet it is to love someone
How right it is to care
How long it's been since yesterday
And what about tomorrow
And chat about our dreams
And all the memories we share

The days they pass so quickly now
Nights are seldom long
And time around me whispers when it's cold
The changes somehow frighten me
Still I have to smile
It turns me on to think of growing old
For though my life's been good to me
There's still so much to do
So many things my mind has never known
I'd like to raise a family
I'd like to sail away
And dance across the mountains on the moon

I have to say it now
It's been a good life all in all
It's really fine
To have the chance to hang around
And lie there by the fire
And watch the evening tire
While all my friends and my old lady
Sit and pass the pipe around

And talk of poems and prayers and promises
And things that we believe in
How sweet it is to love someone
How right it is to care
How long it's been since yesterday
What about tomorrow
What about our dreams
And all the memories we share","Poems, Prayers and Promises/All of My Memories (Reprise)",2005
John Denver,"So you speak to me of sadness
And the coming of the winter
Fear that is within you now
It seems to never end

And the dreams that have escaped you
And the hope that you've forgotten
You tell me that you need me now
You want to be my friend

And you wonder where we're going
Where's the rhyme and where's the reason
And it's you cannot accept
It is here we must begin
To seek the wisdom of the children
And the graceful way of flowers in the wind

[Chorus]
For the children and the flowers
Are my sisters and my brothers
Their laughter and their loveliness
Could clear a cloudy day

Like the music of the mountains
And the colours of the rainbow
They're a promise of the future
And a blessing for today
Though the cities start to crumble
And the towers fall around us
The sun is slowly fading
And it's colder than the sea

It is written from the desert
To the mountains they shall lead us
By the hand and by the heart
They will comfort you and me
In their innocence and trusting
They will teach us to be free

[Chorus]

And the song that I am singing
Is a prayer to non believers
Come and stand beside us
We can find a better way",Rhymes and Reasons,2005

In rocky cathedrals that reach to the sky

Share in the freedom I feel when I fly

Sail over the canyons and up to the stars
And reach for the heavens and hope for the future
And all that we can be and not what we are",Eagles and the Hawk,2005
John Denver,"When I was just a wee little boy.
Full of health and joy.
One Christmas morning I received
A marvelous little toy.
A wonder to be hold it was
Many colors bright.
And the moment I laid eyes on it
It became my heart's delight.
It went ""zip"" when it moved,
""Bop"" when it stopped,
""Br"" when it stood still.
I never knew just what it was
And I guess I never will.

The first time that I picked it up.
I had a big surprise.
For right on it's bottom
Were two green buttons
That looked like big green eyes.
I first pushed one.
And then the other.
And then I pushed on its lid.
And when I set it down again
This is what it did.
It went ""zip"" when it moved,
""Bop"" when it stopped,
""Br"" when it stood still.
I never knew just what it was
And I guess I never will.

It first marched left.
Then marched right
And then marched under a chair.
And when I looked where it had gone
It wasn't even there.
I started to cry.
My daddy laughed.
He knew that I would find.
When I turned around my marvelous toy
Chugging from behind.
It went ""zip"" when it moved,
""Bop"" when it stopped,
""Br"" when it stood still.
I never knew just what it was
And I guess I never will.

Well, the years have passed
Too quickly it seems.
I have my own little boy.
And yesterday I gave to him
My marvelous little toy.
His eyes nearly popped
Right out of his head.
He gave the squeal of glee
Neither one of us knows just what it is,
But he loves it just like me.
It still goes ""zip"" when it moves,
""Bop"" when it stops,
""Br"" when it stands still.
I never knew just what it was
And I guess I never will.
I never knew just what it was
And I guess I never will.",The Marvellous Toy,2005
John Denver,"Up in a meadow in Jasper, Alberta
Two men and four ponies on a long, lonesome ride
To see the high country and learn of her people
The ways that they live there, the ways that they die
One is a teacher, and one a beginner
Just wanting to be there, wanting to know

And together they're trying to tell us a story
That should have been listened to long, long ago
How the life in the mountains is living in danger
From too many people, too many machines
And the time is upon us, today is forever
Tomorrow is just one of yesterdays dreams

John Denver,"Dear friend of my mine
Weather's fine
Today, I saw some ruins
Of the Roman world's decline

And I climbed all those Spanish steps
You've heard of them no doubt
But Rome has lost its glory
I don't know what it's about

I wish you were here
When the shadows fall
And all the rushing traffic's still

I wish you were here
When the bells are ringing
On the seven hills

I make my way to a small cafe
I wonder what you did today
Wish you were here

Dear one at home
I just flew in from Rome
Paris is a postcard
All decked out in color chrome

And so, I climbed the Eiffel Tower
And prayed at Notre Dame
But I just can't find the romance
And I wonder why I came

I wish you were here
On the Champs Elysee's
Lovers walk hand in hand

I wish you were here
They take one look at me
And seem to understand

This city of light is a lovely site
The first bright star I see tonight
Wish you were here

Now, I write this from the plane
Drinking cheap champagne
And wondering why
Two people got so far apart

I wish you were here
Here in London
Where the rain the pouring down

I wish you were here
On this airplane
Headed back to New York Town

I'll never leave you alone again
I'm coming home but until then
Wish you were here

I wish you were here
Wish you were here",Postcards from Paris,2006
John Denver,"There's a name for war and killing
There's a name for giving in
When you know another answer
For me the name is sin
But there's still time to turn around
And make all hatred cease
And give another name to living
And we could call it peace

And peace would be the road we walk
Each step along the way
And peace would be the way we work
And peace the way we play

And in all we see that's different
And in all the things we know
Peace would be the way we look
And peace the way we grow

There's a name for separation
There's a name for first and last
When it's all for us or nothing
For me the name is past
But there's still time to turn around
And make all hatred cease
And give a name to all the future
And we could call it peace

And if peace is what we pray for
And peace is what we give
Then peace will be the way we are
And peace the way we live

Yes there still is the time to turn around
And make all hatred cease
And give another name to living
And we can call it peace

I'll cling to the warmth of your hand
I'll do anything to keep you satisfied

And the wind will whisper your name to me
Little birds will sing along in time
Leaves will bow down when you walk by
And morning bells will chime
 
I'll be there when you're feeling down
To kiss away the fears if you cry
I'll share with you all the happiness I've found
A reflection of the love in your eyes
 
And I'll sing you the songs of the rainbow
A whisper of the joy that is mine
And leaves will bow down when you walk by

John Denver,"When I was a little bitty boy just up off the floor
We used to go down to grandma's house every month end or so
We'd have chicken pie, country ham
Homemade butter on the bread
But the best darn thing about grandma's house
Was the great big feather bed

It was nine feet high and six feet wide
And soft as a downy chick
It was made from the feathers of forty 'leven geese
Took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick

It could hold eight kids and four hound dogs
And a piggy we stole from the shed
We didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun
On grandma's feather bed

After supper we'd sit around the fire, the old folks'd spit and chew
Pa would talk about the farm and the war
And granny'd sing a ballad or two
And I'd sit and listen and watch the fire till the cobwebs filled my head
Next thing I'd know I'd wake up in the morning
In the middle of the old feather bed

It was nine feet high and six feet wide
And soft as a downy chick
It was made from the feathers of forty 'leven geese
Took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick

It could hold eight kids and four hound dogs
And a piggy we stole from the shed
We didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun

Well, I love my ma and I love my pa, I love granny and grandpa too
I've been fishin' with my uncles, I wrestled my cousin
I even kissed Aunt Lou, ew!

That I'd trade them all plus the gal down the road

I dreamed of Alaska so far away
And I dreamed I was flying over mountains and glaciers
Somehow I knew that I'd live there one day

And a little bit of trouble to get on the move
And I felt like a loser but I turned out the winner

Raised in hard times but I had a good life

I knew that I'd wind up a bush pilot's wife.

And wake up most mornings to a drizzling rain
And we live every day like the first or the last one
With nothing to lose and heaven to gain.

John Denver,"He was born in the summer of his 27th year
Coming home to a place he'd never been before
He left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again
You might say he found a key for every door

When he first came to the mountains his life was far away
On the road and hanging by a song
But the string's already broken and he doesn't really care
It keeps changing fast and it don't last for long

But the Colorado rocky mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
The shadow from the starlight is softer than a lullabye
Rocky mountain high (Colorado)

He climbed cathedral mountains, he saw silver clouds below
He saw everything as far as you can see
And they say that he got crazy once and he tried to touch the sun
And he lost a friend but kept his memory

Now he walks in quiet solitude the forest and the streams
Seeking grace in every step he takes
His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand
The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake

And the Colorado rocky mountain high
I've seen it raining fire in the sky
You can talk to God and listen to the casual reply
Rocky mountain high

Now his life is full of wonder but his heart still knows some fear
Of a simple thing he cannot comprehend
Why they try to tear the mountains down to bring in a couple more
More people, more scars upon the land

And the Colorado rocky mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
I know he'd be a poorer man if he never saw an eagle fly

Thinking about the good times
Thinking about the rain
Thinking about how bad it feels alone again

I'm sorry things ain't what they used to be

John Denver,"He was born in the Bitterroot Valley in the early morning rain
Wild geese over the water heading north and home again
Bringing a warm wind from the south
Bringing the first taste of the spring
His mother took him to her breast and softly she did sing

Oh Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies

His mother died that summer and he never learned to cry
He never knew his father and he never did ask why
And he never knew the answers that would make an easy way
But he learned to know the wilderness and to be a man that way

His mother's brother took him in to family and his home
Gave him a hand that he could lean on and a strength to call his own
And he learned to be a farmer and he learned to love the land
And he learned to read the seasons and he learned to make a stand

Oh Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies

On the eve of his twentyfirst birthday he set out on his own
He was thirty years and running when he found his way back home
Riding a storm across the mountains and an aching in his heart
Said he came to turn the pages and to make a brand new start

Now he never told a story of the time that he was gone
Some say he was a lawyer, some say he was a John
There was something in the city that he said he couldn't breathe
And there was something in the country that he said he couldn't leave

Oh Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies

Now some say he was crazy, some are glad he's gone
Some of us will miss him, we'll try to carry on
Giving a voice to the forest, giving a voice to the dawn
Giving a voice to the wilderness and the land that he lived on

Oh Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies

John Denver,"I am the son of a grassland farmer, 
Western Oklahoma, nineteen forty-three.
I always felt grateful to live in the land of the free.
I gave up my father to South Korea, 
The mind of my brother to Vietnam,
Now there's a banker who says I must give up my land.
There are four generations of blood in this topsoil, 
Four generations of love on this farm.
Before I give up, I would gladly give up my right arm.

What are we making weapons for? 
Why keep on feeding the war machine?
We take it right out of the mouths of our babies, 
Take it away from the hands of the poor,
Tell me, what are we making weapons for?

I had a son and my son was a soldier, 
He was so like my father, he was so much like me.
To be a good comrade was the best that he dreamed he could be.
He gave up his future to revolution, 
His life to a battle that just can't be won.
For this is not living, to live at the point of a gun.
I remember the nine hundred days of Leningrad, 
The sound of the dying, the cut of the cold,
I remember the moments, I prayed I would never grow old.

What are we making weapons for? 
Why keep on feeding the war machine?
We take it right out of the mouths of our babies, 
Take it away from the hands of the poor,
Tell me, what are we making weapons for?

For the first time in my life I feel like a prisoner, 
A slave to the ways of the powers that be.
And I fear for my children, as I fear for the future I see.
Tell me how can it be we're still fighting each other? 
What does it take for a people to learn?
If our song is not sung as a chorus, we surely will burn.

John Denver,"I've been lately thinking
About my life's time
All the things I've done
And how it's been
And I can't help believing
In my own mind
I know I'm gonna hate to see it end

I've seen a lot of sunshine
Slept out in the rain
Spent a night or two all on my own
I've known my lady's pleasures
Had myself some friends
And spent a time or two in my own home

And I have to say it now
It's been a good life all in all
It's really fine
To have a chance to hang around
And lie there by the fire
And watch the evening tire
While all my friends and my old lady
Sit and pass the pipe around

And talk of poems and prayers and promises
And things that we believe in
How sweet it is to love someone
How right it is to care
How long it's been since yesterday
And what about tomorrow
And what about our dreams
And all the memories we share

The days they pass so quickly now
Nights are seldom long
And time around me whispers when it's cold
The changes somehow frighten me
Still I have to smile
It turns me on to think of growing old
For though my life's been good to me
There's still so much to do
So many things my mind has never known
I'd like to raise a family
I'd like to sail away
And dance across the mountains on the moon

I have to say it now
It's been a good life all in all
It's really fine
To have the chance to hang around
And lie there by the fire
And watch the evening tire
While all my friends and my old lady
Sit and pass the pipe around

And talk of poems and prayers and promises
And things that we believe in
How sweet it is to love someone
How right it is to care
How long it's been since yesterday
What about tomorrow

And all the memories we share","Poems, Prayers & Promises",2010

To ride on the crest of a wild raging storm
To work in the service of life and living

Part of beginning to understand

The things that you've shown us
The stories you tell

To be true as the tide and free as a wind swell

John Denver,"Did you ever hear the story of the Christmas tree
Who just didn’t want to change the show
He liked living in the woods and playing with squirrels
He liked icicles and snow

He liked wolves and eagles and grizzly bears
And critters and creatures that crawled
Why bugs were some of his very best friends
Spiders and ants and all

Now that’s not to say that he ever looked down
On a vision of twinkled lights
Or on mirrored bubbles and peppermint canes
And a thousand other delights

And he often had dreams of tiny reindeer
And a jolly old man in a sleigh
Full of toys and presents and wonderful things
And a story of Christmas Day

Oh, Alfie believed in Christmas alright
He was full of Christmas cheer
All of each and every day
And all throughout the year

To him it was more than a special time
Much more than a special day
It was more than a special story, it was more than a beautiful story
It was a special kind of way

You see some folks have never heard a jingle bell ring
And they’ve never heard of Santa Claus
They’ve never heard the story of the Son of God
That made Alfie pause

Did that mean that they’d never know of peace on Earth
Or the Brotherhood of Man
Or know how to love, or know how to give
If they can’t no one can

You see, life is a very special kind of thing
Not just for a chosen few
But for each and every living, breathing thing
Not just me and you

So when you’re at Christmas prayers this year
Alfie asked me if I’d ask you
Say a prayer for the wind and the water and the wood
And those who live there too

It's in every one of us to be wise. 
Find your heart, open up both your eyes.
We can all know everything without ever knowing why.
It's in every one of us, by and by.

It's in every one of us to be wise. 
Find your heart, open up both your eyes.

They talk so slowly when they do
They are rich they are poor
Their illusions are gone
They share one heart for two

John Doan,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,1994
John Doe,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me

There's an answer right before your eyes, but you're just not thinking this through
Nunzio knows, when he's cutting my hair
Trim a bit here 
And then trim a bit there
Just a modest adjustment
Can fatten the bottom line

What if we cut back personnel?

How about a few salary trims?

We could lower the price of the paper

Shaving is tricky: The razor should float
Shave me too close 
And you may slit my throat
Its the simplest solutions
That bolster the bottom line

If we charge the Newsies sixty cents per hundred instead of fifty

They'd have to sell ten more papers just to earn the same amount as always

It's genius

It's gonna be awfully rough on those children

They'll be learning a real life lesson in economics 
I couldn't offer them a better education if they were my own
Give me a week and I'll train them to be
Like an army that's marching to war
Proud of themselves and so Grateful to me
They'll be begging to pay even more

For God's sake, relax
Why throw them out?
All we need is some wax
Listen well to these barbershop lessons
For they'll see you through

When you're stuck in the muck you'll be fine
You'll erase any trace of decline

And a snip

And a shine

And the power of the press

A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear
My heart beat like a hammer, my arms wound around you tight
And stars fell on Alabama last night
 
We lived our little drama, we kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I can't forget the glamor, your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama last night

You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise

John Douglas,"On the sunset, horses silhouette 
All is calm tonight 
New horizon, keep your eyes on those stars 
Lighting a way 

Take me somewhere out there 
Through the fields, in the night 
All the dark horses ride 
No more reining in 
Now my aim is in sight 
To the wild and the light 

Out of harm's way, where the traps all lay 
Tying you down, selling you out 
Beating you down - they're all over town 
Know your true self, or your truth might bend 
They will turf you out in the end 
Don't heed a word they say 
Keep heading away 

Faraway, slow in motion 
Through the fields, in the night 
All the dark horses ride 
No more reining in 
Now my aim is in sight 
To the wild and the light 

Long-lost summer days 
Are shining around again, 
Sky ablaze, ride away...",All the Dark Horses [Live][*],2009
John Douglas,"I discover the wheel and watch the buildings go by 
You talk a little soft, turn off the radio 
I just want to hear all the past times 
The rushed hours, the endless lives 
Don't become a burden 
Say the word and be free 

You will find a great weight lifting 
Easing your mind, a great weight lifting 
Just leave it behind, a great weight lifting 
And you will find a great weight lifting 

It's been a lonely winter hibernating away 
You need a little sunlight on that face 
How long can you stay in the darkness? 
Dust round the empty nest? 
You could make you way out 
If you lay down the load 

You will find a great weight lifting 
Easing your mind, a great weight lifting 
Leave it behind, a great weight lifting 
You will find a great weight lifting 
Just leave it behind, a great weight lifting 
And you will find a great weight lifting",Weightlifting [Live][*],2009
John Doyle,"Last night I dreamed my head was in fever
Last night I dreamed it never was so far
To reach the shore of safety and redemption
And a gaze upon the bright morning star

I dreamed I was by friends all put abandoned
I dreamed I was alone but for my scars
And blinded by the tears that fell like water
No more to see the bright morning star

The streets of dreams never looked this lonely
The streets of dreams never felt this hard
And I heard my voice barely of a whisper
As the clouds denied the bright morning star

Sometimes this life is no more than a moment
And sometimes this light is lost unto the dark
But courage hears the sound of dawn approaching
And each our own, bright morning star

I woke to find every window open
I woke to find the heavy door jar
And I walked outside and stood upon the hilltop
And gazed one small bright morning star

I walked outside and every bird was singing
As I found again my bright morning star
",Bright Morning Star,2014
John Doyle,"I can tell by the way you're walking
You don't want company 
I'll let you alone and I'll let you walk on 
And in your own good time you'll be 

Back where the sun can find you
Under the wise wishing tree 
And with all of them made we'll lie under the shade
And call it a jubilee

And I can tell by the way you're talking
That the past isn't letting you go 
But there's only so long you can take it all on
And then the wrong's gotta be on its own

And when you're ready to leave it behind you
You'll look back and all that you'll see 
Is the wreckage and rust that you left in the dust
On your way to the jubilee

And I can tell by the way you're listening
That you're still expecting to hear 
Your name being called like a summons to all
Who have failed to account for their doubts and their fears

They can't add up to to much without you
And so if it were up to me, I'd take hold of your hand 
Saying come hear the band
Play your song at the jubilee 

And I can tell by the way you're searching
For something you can't even name  
That you haven't been able to come to the table
Simply glad that you came

When you feel like this try to imagine
That we're all like frail boats on the sea 
Just scanning the night for that great guiding light
Announcing the jubilee 

And I can tell by the way you're standing
With your eyes filling with tears 
That it's habit alone that keeps you turning for home
Even though your home is right here

Where the people who love you are gathered
Under the wise wishing tree 
May we all be considered then straight on delivered
Down to the jubilee 

Because to people who love you are waiting
And they'll wait just as long as need be 
When we look back and say those were halcyon days 
We're talking about jubilee",Jubilee,2014

John Duffey,"Casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walking down
The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below
Following their footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors
Of silent desperation, never speakin' to a soul
The poison air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dying
'Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain

John Dulieu,"High flying, adored, so young, the instant queen
A rich beautiful thing of all the talents, a cross between 
A fantasy of the bedroom and a saint 
You were just a back street girl 
Hustling and fighting 
Scratching and biting 
High flying, adored, did you believe in your wildest moments 
All this would be yours, that you'd become the lady of them all? 
Were there stars in your eyes when you crawled in at night 
From the bars, from the sidewalks
From the gutter theatrical? 
Don't look down, it's a long, long way to fall
High flying, adored, what happens now, where do you go from here? 
For someone on top of the world, the view is not exactly clear 
A shame you did it all at twenty-six
There are no mysteries now 
Nothing can thrill you 
No-one fulfill you 
High flying, adored, I hope you come to terms with boredom 
So famous, so easily, so soon, is not the wisest thing to be
You won't care if they love you, it's been done before 
You'll despair if they hate you 
You'll be drained of all energy 
All the young who've made it would agree 

High flying, adored, that's good to hear, but unimportant 
My story's quite usual, local girl makes good, weds famous man

No-one else can fill it like I can","High Flying, Adored [From Evita]",1998

Yesterday, perhaps
Danced with Jim and Paul

You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,

Houses sit in white picket frames like Rockwells in a row
I've always been a rebel son but daddy didn't mind
He wanted me to chase my dreams the way he did one time
Now he's on the front porch as I get out of my car
And as my father's eyes meet mine there's one wish in my heart
I'm wishin' my daddy was forty again

He would be young and I would be ten
We would go fishin' throw an old ball around
Wash his truck go into town
We can never go back to the way it was then
Just for today I wish he was forty again

Now we'll sit and talk for hour of life out on the road
What I've seen and where I've been and journeys left to go
Mama looks at both of us ""you're like two kids I swear""
Then the stories turn to laughter before the leaving turns to tears
I'm wishing my daddy was forty again

He would be young and I would be ten
We would go fishin' throw an old ball around
Wash his old truck go into town
We could never go back to the way it was then

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,

Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind

If we had the chance to do it all again

I must have been a sight for her to see

I'll be your shelter from the storm.
Break away the chains that bind you.
Let the truth of my love find you
Just look into the eyes of my heart and see...

And when you need someone to comfort you in sadness
Just reach your hand out, and I'll be there.
I'm with you everywhere, you're never too far.
I'll let you know that you can...

",Eyes of My Heart,1997
John Elefante,"Moving through time on a carousel dream
Beneath me the ground won't stop spinning
All is fair in my pursuit of the brass ring
I'm running a race no one's winning

And I search through the forest for a diamond in the rough
And I stumble on a pot of gold, but it's never enough
And I cover my eyes and pretend I don't see
I should be looking for You instead of looking for me

(Chorus)
When I fall in You, when I fall in You
I'm covered by love and submerged in Your truth
When I fall in You

Tearing down mountains, repainting the sky
Pretending to be my own hero
I strive for independence, on me I rely
Pride is a wound that can't heal

Take my soul on a journey, try to find rainbow's end
I throw caution to the wind, I get knocked down again
But I'll hold on for what I know I must do
Cause I don't need what I want
What I need is what's true

When I fall in You, when I fall in You
It becomes clear to me who you want me to be
When I fall in You
",Fall,1997
John Elefante,"A lonely tree upon a mountaintop
A city street where people never stop
There You are
A smile upon a little child's face
A lonely soul in a forgotten place
There You are

But way beyond a winter's dream
There's a song without a theme
I understand as we dance
Deep into the starry night
The song plays on till morning light
It never ends

[Chorus]
Every time I feel the wind blow
Every time I see a rainbow
I know You're there
Every time I see a tear fall
Every time You hear my heart call
I know You're there

Cause You are the Author of all that we are
Father of Fathers
We're never too far
From You Lord, from You

Old man looking out the window
Wondering where did all the time go
There You are
A mother praying for her lost son
Wondering why on earth did he run
There You are
Holding back tears like a river of years that have all gone by

Cause You are the Author of all that we are
Father make sure that we're never too far
From You Lord, from You

[Chorus]",I Know You're There,1997
John Elefante,"There are times when silence is golden
There are times when words are misunderstood
There are times we can't abort our feelings
I'll shed light on the truth, regardless of my shame

And when all is said and done
There is only an audience of one
And all that I long to hear
Familiar and ever so clear
When you say these words to me...

(Chorus)
I'll love you forever
I'll love you until time marries you
I'll be there to hold you when you fall

And in a moment I will be waiting
And in a moment You will be there
I belong to what's true and what's loving
I belong to You without a care

And maybe when I don't hear You
It doesn't mean that I'm not listening
Your words will go straight to my heart
Familiar and oh so clear
When You say these words to me...

(Repeat Chorus)

You hear when I call out loud
You hear when I call in silence
And here I stand center stage
With You alone as my audience
You've heard my every song
So don't make me wait too long
Till I hear You say again, I love you

(Repeat Chorus)
",I'll Love You Forever,1997
John Elefante,"Just another early morning as the sun begins to rise
Like a million other mornings just the same
The people of the town begin their ordinary lives
Unsuspecting of a world about to change

This was not just any other day...no
Not just any other day

Little did they know that on the other side of town
The sin of all humanity would bleed beneath a crown
Of a man whose only blame was being born a king

(Chorus)
And I wish that I could have felt the rain on me
I wish that I could have felt that rain
I would have looked into Your dying eyes and
Stared at You in disbelief and thought,
""Is this what you've been telling me 2000 years!""

It was business as usual, nothing different at all
As dusk would cast a shadow and the night began to fall
But no one stopped to notice that before this day would end
The sick and the afflicted needn't ever hurt again

Not just any other day...
It was not just any other day

As a small crowd gathered just beneath the dying Son
The fulfillment of a promise had been done

And I wish that I could have felt that rain on me
I wish that I could have felt that rain
I would have heard with my own ears
As you shouted out in fear and said,
""Father why have You forsaken Me!""
",Not Just Any Other Day,1997
John Elefante,"I recall a time in my life when I was scared to share my heart
With anyone
Afraid of who I really was I'd hide behind a wall
Where no one could see
Then the stones that formed the wall began to crumble
And your whisper knocked me off my feet
And took me to my knees

When you said, talk to me, let's have a conversation
I hear more than just words, I can hear down in your soul
So talk to me, I'll do more than listen
I stood where you're standing
And I know just how you feel
Talk to me, talk to me

Aimless I'd go searching for a twisted play on words,
That made me feel I was alright
Striving for perfection when the only perfect thing I had
Was weakness
Then strength began to build in me
All it took was Your words to get me to my knees,
And You said...

Talk to me, let's have a conversation
I hear more than just words, I can hear down in your soul
Won't you talk to me, I'll do more than listen
I stood where you're standing and I know just how you feel
Talk to me, I've been right where you are
I know every breath you take, every feeling in your heart
Talk to me, tell me what you're feeling
Know I'm always here for you, whenever you need me

And the stones that formed the wall began to crumble
All it took was Your words to get me to my knees
",Talk to Me,1997
John Elefante,"How many times has psychology?
Made you analyze what you should be
And how many times has some philosophy
Made you spin around, too dizzy to see?
And how many times have we looked too deep
For what we should have seen so obviously, tell me?

Does anybody know what makes the wind blow?
And can you tell me why the rain falls from the sky?
If we really want to know all the answers
They're in the Treasures of Heaven

And how high is the price you'll pay
For an ounce of truth that will fade away?
And how hard will you hold on
To your freedom reign that will soon be gone?
And how many fools will believe till they
Understand that we don't agree and still?

Does anybody know what makes the wind blow?
And can you tell me why the rain falls from the sky?
If we really want to know all the answers
And why does the sun warm each and every heart?
These are questions we can't answer
Till we open up and find the Treasures of Heaven
Treasures of Heaven

Just think about it for a short moment
Think about the Treasures of Heaven

Does anybody know what makes the wind blow?
And can you tell me why the rain falls from the sky?
Why each and every one of us has the right
To choose between darkness and light?

Does anybody know how the moon controls the tide?
Why You had to come and die for me?
If we really want to know all the answers
It will always be a mystery why You gave Your only Son for me
Till we open up and find the Treasures of Heaven
",Treasures of Heaven,1997
John Elefante,"I thought we would always be together;
Never be apart.
You said that our love was made in heaven;
And you'd never break my heart.


But it got hard along the way
and our love began to stray
Now I'm standing here alone
with nothing left to say, but...

Chorus:
Where, where does our love go from here?
Which road to we follow to find our way clear?
Where does our love go from here?
When will we finally find our way home?
And where does our love go, oh, from here.

Days gone by can never be recovered.
Now they all are yesterdays.
But the love we shared can be rediscovered
like a treasure cast away.

But the things we take for granted
sometimes disappear
And the moment that they're gone,
you start wishing they were here.

(Repeat Chorus)

",Where Does Our Love Go,1997
John Elefante,"We spoke with the tongues of angels
But we didn't have love, no we didn't have love
We had faith that could move any mountain
But it wasn't enough, 'cause we didn't have love
We had wings but we did not fly
We had vision but we didn't have sight
Can we forgive, so the whole world can live


CHORUS 
Love, Love one another
Leaving the past, believing in the power of love
Love one another
'Cause we're all in this together
Love one another


No one would live forever
If it wasn't for love, God's love
No one would stay together
If it wasn't for love


Disillusioned by the stained-glass sea
But there is truth for those that hope and believe
Now I can see, that the greatest of these is love


CHORUS
Love one another
Leaving the past, believing in the power of love
Love one another
'Cause we're all in this together
Love one another.

John Elefante,"Three a.m. - a baby boy; a new life began 
I held him in my arms and 
knew one day he'd be a man 
And soon I'd have to tell 
him that this world is not our home 
We must give our lives to Jesus; 
we are not our own

But for now just let me hold you,

I took her by the hand 
For better or for worse we vowed 
that with Jesus we'd stand
We would instill upon our children 
that this world is not our home

treasure is the promise that we own

You know we'll be together in 
an everlasting life.""

Too many nights I lie awake crying for your love
But you don't care my hearts about to break
Oh here it comes.

I feel heartache coming on, I feel heartache and it's coming on.

What is the reason that you kick me down
Well I feel like custard, at the little big horn
You shot your arrows straight through my heart, through my heart
And you left me in down for love and it's tearing me all apart
Took away all that I had, when you took away your love
Did you have to leave me all so glad
Oh here it comes.

Why must I always tell you all I want is this?

No one bites back as hard on their anger
None of my pain and woe can show through

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free

When my fist clenches, crack it open
Before I use it and lose my cool
When I smile, tell me some bad news
Before I laugh and act like a fool

And if I swallow anything evil
Put your finger down my throat
And if I shiver, please give me a blanket
Keep me warm, let me wear your coat

No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man, to be the sad man

John Entwistle,"You can't see evil, but it's there
Feel its presence, it hangs in the air
When trouble knocks and enters the room

Sometimes things don't go quite the way we plan
Sometimes you have to choose to be a boy or be a man
The signs of life are far and few
It seems at times just me and you

About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

A crowd of people turned away

Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy

And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

Spending my money, honey, I didn't care
Taking my friends out for a mighty good time
I drank that good gin, champagne and wine

Just as soon as my money got low
I couldn't find no friends and I had no place to go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it till that eagle grins

'Cause I found out that nobody wants you
Nobody wants you when they find out
That you're down and out
In your pocket, there's not not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

Just let you get back up on your feet again
Here they all come telling you their your old long lost friend
And this I wanna tell you and about it I have no doubt
Nobody wants you, nobody needs you
Nobody wants when you're down and out

John Etheridge,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2003

Wanneer een schutter rust
Wanneer de boog zich mag ontspannen
Z'n pijl het laatste doelwit kust

Wanneer is een mens tevreden
Merkt hij voor een keer als hij kijkt
Over de schutting van de buren
Dat 't het gras net iets groener lijkt

Zeg me waar moeten we zoeken
En wat is nou die wens
Waarna we niet meer verder hoeven
Waar en wanneer ligt die grens

En waarom wil ik alsmaar verder
Als ik ergens ben
Wat maakt het onbekende beter
Dan al hetgene dat ik ken

En waarom ben ik nooit compleet gelukkig
Met wat er hoort bij mij
Waarom moet er toch steeds weer iets bij
Waarom nooit eens een keer
Ietsje minder dan meer

Jobs he does around town for free or at most a dollar
And I'm guessing 99% of you have either laughed in Whitey's
Face or ruthlessly made fun of his feet or voice or sister
Or shortness when he wasn't looking
But the next time you'd see him he'd still go out of his way to 
Smile and wave at you and ask you about your mother's
Operation or something like that because he, unlike us,
Actually cares about someone other than himself

The reason I bring this up to you is because I was the worst
Offender of all
My life was simply going nowhere
Then a tiny little man rushed to my side
He should've gotten a big thank you
Instead he got a Porta-Potti ride

I was such a shithead
But he never quit on me
'Til I told him he was useless
And his sister was freaky
Once when we were watching Sunday football
A fuzzy screen was all that we could see
Whitey came over with a hanger
And spent the game atop our T.V.

And when the lightning struck him
He let out a wicked, loud yell
But we just turned up the volume
And ignored the burning smell
We should all rot in hell

I went to high school with Whitey
As a joke I told him to meet me at the prom
When he got there, I said:",Bum Biddy,2002

Someone maybe will come my way, until that day
No one comes close to you

I see you in all those up market movies
You talk on the talk shows, I stare at the tv
What can an old friend say
I know you don't feel this way
I'm taking this chance today, to let you know

Of all the lovers I've ever known, you stand alone

Ever alone and isolated
And deep within the soul
And ever optimistic
That one day we'll reach the goal
An inner voice deeps pushing
Saying we must do our best
While all the time we know
That we'll be settling for less
But we're not angels
We're not angles

Well things are moving faster
That we'll ever comprehend
Now to some it's a comfort
To have faith that life don't end
Always hoping for a second chance
To fulfill our desires
We got looking for a saviour
When we fall into the fire
But we're no angels
We're no angels
I never said I was an angel
We're no angels

So some on and spread your arms
Like wings on wind
Trying to get up higher
To be a little like an angel
To be like gabriel
There's a demon dwelling down below
Darker than us all
Though once he was a pretty angel
Who never thought he would fall
So we follow dreams
We seek what's real
Always knowing that we
Will never be

John Farnham,"There's a young girl working the corner
There's an old man lost at sea
They could tell you a million stories
About the wrong side of the street

There's a rich man making money
From a poor man's misery
It's always the same

Always the same, fight for survival
Whatever we do today
Don't make tomorrow the same

Fight for survival
Forget about yesterday
Don't make tomorrow the same

There's a runaway looking for shelter
An innocent heart that bleeds
There's a blind man playing for pity
Says it's the only way to make ends meet

And he's living of his hard luck story
Says he's a victim of society
It's always the same

Always the same, fight for survival
Whatever we do today
Don't make tomorrow the same

Fight for survival
Forget about yesterday
Don't make tomorrow the same

And all the questions of why
How will we ever know if we never try?

Always the same, fight for survival

The moon was bright and high up in the east
I stretched out to touch what I was seeing
And then I looked up and found it out of reach

Diamonds on the water
I saw star fire on the sea
There were diamonds on the water
You don't need to sleep to have a dream

I believe that certain things can happen
To change the very nature of the beast
And I have been a witness to survival
And nothing really has to rest in peace

Diamonds on the water
I saw star fire on the sea
There were diamonds on the water
You don't need to sleep to have a dream

Here I am, I'm standing on the edge of here and now
Here I am, my time is coming round
Here I am, dust to dust I carry ancient ground

I am in a perfect situation
But thoughts intrude on me just like a thief
They steal me back to all that I would run from
Back from where I really want to be

Show you 'round

By her own admission, it had all been a lie
Now she fairly stands accused

They found her by the road, her hands were tied
Was she the victim or the mastermind?

Oh, she's gonna be someone
Everyone will know her name
Knew what she wanted all along

And made her sign her name
Many said, she went too far

Is she ever gonna live this down?

And he learns to love, been taught to hate
To carry on the way it has been done

All our lives it's debts to repay
Maybe someday we can put the past away

Some will die for you, some will lie to you
There's all kinds of people in this world
Turn the world around, tear the borders down
There's all kinds of people in this world

Some will die for you, some will lie to you
There's all kinds of people in this world
Turn your fear away, find a better way
There's all kinds of people in this world, yeah

Then in a moment things can change
One look behind, it's never the same

Some will die for you, some will lie to you
There's all kinds of people in this world
Turn the world around, tear the borders down
There's all kinds of people in this world

Some will die for you, some will lie to you
There's all kinds of people in this world
Turn the world around, tear the borders down
There's all kinds of people in this world

Some will die for you, some will lie to you
There's all kinds of people in this world
Turn the world around, tear the borders down
There's all kinds of people in this world

Some will die for you, some will lie to you
There's all kinds of people in this world
Turn the world around, tear the borders down
There's all kinds of people in this world

Some will die for you, some will lie to you
There's all kinds of people in this world
Turn the world around, tear the borders down
There's all kinds of people in this world

John Farnham,"Today such a lonely day
I try to find my way
But you only you occupy my mind

And I try to understand the reason why
You're pushing me away
And I try to understand the reason why

Don't let it end, 'cause I can't pretend
I'm not gonna cry if you do
Don't let me go darlin' you know
My heart is breaking in two
Don't let it end why can't we mend
These wounds left open so long
Don't let it end 'cause I can't pretend
To stop loving you

Today I heard you calling me
But it's just the storm outside
And today I want you next to me
Your heart playing with my mind

And I try to understand the reason why
You're pushing me away
And I try to understand the reason why

Don't let it end, 'cause I can't pretend
I'm not gonna cry if you do
Don't let me go darlin' you know
My heart is breaking in two
Don't let it end why can't we mend
These wounds left open so long
Don't let it end 'cause I can't pretend

I know it's holding on too hard
Even if dreams have passed me by

Don't let it end, 'cause I can't pretend
I'm not gonna cry if you do
Don't let me go darlin' you know
My heart is breaking in two
Don't let it end why can't we mend
These wounds left open so long
Don't let it end 'cause I can't pretend
To stop loving you

John Farnham,"Are Desalvo, and a Roman
See the lovers in the faded photograph
She's making funny faces, he's trying not to laugh
Do you remember the way we used to be
When love lifted us up, made us feel so free

How we betrayed each other
Trying to rediscover
That feeling once again
This is not the end

There's no ghost from the past, that we can't shake
Have a little faith in us (have a little faith in us)
There's no history that we can't remake
Have a little faith in us
For all we know the best is yet to come

We like the wind under our wings, you and I
We stay on the ground too long, we get that urge to fly
And it seems that the grass world be more green
In any other place, with any change of scene

Here is the love we long for, open the secret door
And it will take us in
And sweep us off our feet again

There's no ghost from the past, that we can't shake
Have a little faith in us (have a little faith in us)
There's no history that we can't remake
Have a little faith in us (have a little faith in us)
There's no ghost from the past, that we can't shake
Have a little faith in us (have a little faith in us)
There's no destiny that we can't create
Have a little faith in us
For all we know the best is yet to come

And we can climb that mountain and go
Where this love has never gone before
And in our wildest heart of hearts we will know
That we have been reborn

There's no ghost from the past, that we can't shake
Have a little faith in us (have a little faith in us)
There's no history that we can't remake
Have a little faith in us (have a little faith in us)
There's no ghost from the past, that we can't shake
Have a little faith in us (have a little faith in us)
There's no destiny that we can't create
Have a little faith in us
For all we know the best is yet to come",Have a Little Faith (In Us),1996
John Farnham,"See celli, a levin, and j ponti
And then time stood still
We touched, in the heart of the fire
We crossed over lines
The magic we shared in our perfect desire
Then love came undone ... in the spell ...
Of something that's broken .. we danced ...
In the night of satin and lace, we were suddenly woken

Now we've got another moment to share
And I can't believe, this has happened to me!

Take a little piece of my soul tonight
Take a little piece of my one and only
Take a little piece of my soul tonight
Take a little piece of my one and only heart

And then one became two
Look at me I'm so lost in the world
Without you by my side
Till the end of my life tell me, what can I do?

Now we have another secret to share
And I can't explain how it always feels so new

Take a little piece of my soul tonight
Take a little piece of my one and only
Take a little piece of my soul tonight
Take a little piece of my one and only heart

Take a little piece of my one and only
Take a little piece of my one and only heart

A little piece of my soul (my soul)
Take a piece of my heart (a little piece of my soul)
A little piece of my soul

Now we have another moment to share
I still can't explain how it always feel so new

Take a little piece of my soul tonight
Take a little piece of my one and only
Take a little piece of my soul tonight
Take a little piece of my one and only heart",Little Piece of My Heart,1996
John Farnham,"May you never lay your head down
Without a hand to hold
May you never make your bed out in the cold

You're just like a great and strong brother of mine
And you know that I love you true
You never talk dirty behind my back
And I know that there's those that do

Please won't you, please won't you bear it in mind?
Love is a lesson to learn in our time
Please won't you, please won't you bear it in mind for me?

May you never lay your head down
Without a hand to hold
May you never make your bed out in the cold

Oh, you're just like a good and close sister to me
And you know that I love you true
You hold no blade to stab me in my back
And I know that there's those that do

Please won't you, please won't you bear it in mind?
Love is a lesson to learn in our time
Please won't you, please won't you bear it in mind for me?

May you never lay your head down
Without a hand to hold
May you never make your bed out in the cold

Well, you're just like a great and strong brother of mine
And you know that I love you like I should
You never talk about me behind my back
And I know that there's times you could

Oh, please won't you, please, please bear it in mind?
Life is a lesson to learn in our time
Won't you, please won't you bear it in mind for me?

May you never lose your temper
If you get hit in the bar room fight
May you never lose your woman overnight

May you never lay your head down
Without a hand to hold
May you never make your bed out in the cold

Oh, please won't you, please, please won't you bear it in mind?
Life is a lesson to learn in our time
Won't you, please won't you bear it in mind for me?

Yeah, please won't you, please won't you bear it in mind for me?
Please, please, please won't you
Please, won't you bear it in mind for me?

John Farnham,"Richard pleasant, and a tanner
In the light of the dashboard
Something flickers then dies
The last cigarette 'til the next town

I'm driving through dreamland
Strange and familiar
And the rain is coming down

Head's down low, moving so slow
And i really don't know
Why i feel so alive when i look in your eyes

It's over my head. night makes a burning sky
Over my head. voices are calling
Over my head. angels will beat their wings
God only knows why it all goes right over my head

Send me away to think about it
I've driven two thousand miles or more
And the rain keeps on coming down

Head's down low, moving so slow
And i really don't know
Why i feel so alive when i look in your eyes

It's over my head. night makes a burning sky
Over my head. voices are calling
Over my head. angels will beat their wings
God only knows why it all goes right over my head

And the singer says ""you're just marking time""
And the dj says ""it's your love on the line""
Calling your name ...

It's over my head. night makes a burning sky
Over my head. voices are calling
Over my head. angels will beat their wings
God only knows why it all goes right over my head",Over My Head,1996
John Farnham,"J Kimball, and are Van Warner
There's no hero in this story
And the ending is so sad
In the ruins of my dreams we lie
I would kill to win you back
I should send you fields of roses
Say I'll always wish you well
But I had cast you as my Juliet
And you have cast me into hell
For those who have been wounded
Where love has missed it's mark
Bow your head and say a prayer
Tonight for Romeo's Heart
In this wine I taste your kisses
With this bread I break my word
I will not die upon this cross for you
All I feel for you is hurt
I know the moon will rise again
But there will be no starlight in my eyes
For those who have been wounded
Where love has missed it's mark
Bow your head and say a prayer
Tonight for Romeo's Heart",Romeo's Heart,1996
John Farnham,"We all have a second skin
(Sometimes it's superficial)
From without or from within
(Can be beneficial)
When you have your second skin
(All of it essential)
You can be almost anything
(Very superstition)
We all have a second skin
(A real infatuation)
From without or from within
(Cause hyperventilation)
When you have your second skin
(A close examination)
You can be anything
(And you'll see the superstition)
These lyrics are from the CD insert.
Thanks,
Diane",Second Skin,1996
