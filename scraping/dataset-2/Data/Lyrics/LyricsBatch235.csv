America,"Sarah, please
Where is the love you said you'd save for me
Am I a fool to think that something's strange
I think you've changed

Golly, dad
She was the best thing that I ever had
Torn and battered now and due for repair
But she's not there

What does it matter and who really cares
With no one to turn to when she's not there
Ah, but it's all right, I'll get by

Miles apart
Left here standing with a broken heart
Call me names but I'll refuse to cry
Don't ask my why

What does it matter and who really cares
With no one to turn to when she's not there
Ah, but it's all right, I'll get by",Sarah,1977
America,"I hear you knockin' but you can't come in 
You wear your stockings like you think it's a sin 
Don't try to tell me you ain't been where you been 
'Cause I know that you've been messin' round with him 

So slow down 
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down) 
Come on down 
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down) 
Oh down 
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down) 
Before it gets too late 
Before it gets too late 

I met you dancin' at the high school gym 
You rubbed against me my head started to spin 
You turned around gave me a wink and a grin 
And then you told me that you'd like to be friends 

Don't slow down 
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down) 
Don't slow down 
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down) 
Don't slow down 
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down) 
Don't slow down 
Before it gets too late 
Before it gets too late 
Take it! 

(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down) 
On down 
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down) 
On down 
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down) 
Don't try to tell me 
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down) 
You'll never sell me 
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down) 
Before it gets too late 
I said before it gets too late 
You know before it gets too late 
Oh, hey

America,"These brown eyes of mine

America,"How 'bout a tear for the year of 1960 
I watched the fins of the Cadillac fall 
I remember Dad explained about the Berlin Wall 

How 'bout a tear for the torment and the trouble 
That was brewing in the Asian way 
I wore a smile like the faces that surround L.A. 

In the city of the lost and found 
It's hard to get a break 
Hard to stop from getting turned around 
And make the same mistakes 

My reputation's on the line 
The final day of '59 
But like the sun, just watch me shine 
Today 

How 'bout a cheer for the piano virtuoso 
I practiced 61 minutes a day 
I could never reach the keys 
But it was all OK 

How 'bout a cheer for the humour in my brother 
That could brighten up the darkest nights 
It's just another sign of love 
Whenever we would fight 

It's all the same twenty years ago 
As it is right now 
Like a tour at the closing show 
When I take my bow 

My reputation's on the line 
At the start of '79 
But like the sun, just watch me shine 
Today 
I've played this part so many times 
Since the end of '59 
But like the sun, just watch me shine 
Today

America,"We were dancin' in the middle 
We could hardly hold our heads up

I remember wondering what they'd think

We were trying not to laugh 
Then you made me cry instead 
I remember wishing I was dead

It's been too long a time now please 
Just say you will, we can call it a day

",No Fortune,1979
America,"One morning when the mist came down 
I woke up early and I looked around 
My baby slept, the sky was blue 
I started walkin' thinkin' only of you 
Up the hill and down the road 
Past the people that I barely know 
Round the bend to the run-off wash 
I found a feather that a quail had lost 

Where are you goin' now my friend 
Where are you goin' now 
Are you going to see them on the mountain now 
Goin' to see them trees 
Goin' to watch the circles take a bow 
Goin' to help agree 
To be 
Today 

Some people like to play out loud 
I like them always, they're a laughing crowd 
To catch the wind then come slidin' down 
You reach the bottom fallin' upside down 

Touch a hand and see the world turnin' circles 
Brushin' every curl back again 
To those sunset walks 
That special summer and those all night talks 

",One Morning,1979
America,"Golden rings and hair tied with ribbon 
Early spring when winter's forgiven 
Laughing past pleasures warm by the fire 
Come inside 

Silver vase, take a drink flower petal 
Whistling songs like steam from the kettle 
Carry silence like driftwood that rides 
On the tide, on the tide, on the tide 

Tall treasures, large as Alaska 
There forever, never put out to pasture 
Then the night will fall 
Bringing peace to all 
Darkness there together 

Soft light bells and tea, draw the curtain 
China cups, some shatter for certain 
Laughin past pleasures warm by the fire 
Come inside 

Tall treasures, large as Alaska 
There forever, never put out to pasture 
Red river runs here beside us 
Grey morning will never divide us 

",Tall Treasures,1979

I do, I do believe in you 
And everything that we do 

We used to run with the dangerous crowd 
Where the flame was hot and burnin' out 
We knew we'd have to give 
It hit us where we lived

After all that we've been through together 
You took away my darkest nights (nights)

She turned into a pumpkin pie, sweet kiss at midnight 

She moves, oh so fine 
She's like a perfect valentine 
She's not one to fall in love

Who lay on the deck of his catamaran some night

Suspicions rise, why does she whisper 
Someone's hiding something 
What's going on 

She smiles and finds an excuse to go out 
Meets him somewhere on the edge of town 
For one more night of real love 
How can it be wrong 

'Cause when they turn out the lights 
In their rented room tonight 
Two lovers won't be lonely anymore 

When it's a desperate love, risk is high 
Cheating hearts making alibis 
In the shadows someone is waiting 
Waiting for their lover to come tonight 

A cheater's conscience has no pride 
To spend the night with another man's wife 
Lie to his best friend and never think twice 
He knows where to find what he longs to have 
And do anything 'cause he wants her that bad 
Love has many faces, faces to hide 

'Cause when they turn out the lights 
In their rented room tonight 
Two lovers won't be lonely anymore

On a moonlit night on wings of silver
As the enchanted stars sail serenely by
Do they know where do unicorns go
Where winged horses fly
Narwhales lost at sea and never seen again
Go, go and ask the magpie
Where do unicorns go

In the trees the birds have learned to speak
Gaily colored they keep their secrets
In a parade of clouds playing hide and seek

And the last lion roars at the last dusty fountain
In the shadow of the forest though she may be old and worn

And you look to the north and a pale moon is rising
And it seems like all is dying and would leave the world to mourn
In the distance hear the laughter of the last unicorn

I'm alive, I'm alive
When the last moon is cast over the last star of morning
And the future has passed without even a last desperate warning
Then look into the sky where through the clouds a path is torn
Look and see her how she sparkles, it's the last unicorn

And two eyes made out of coal

How he came to life one day

There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Was alive as he could be
And the children say
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said, ""Let's run
And we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away""

With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there
All around the square
Saying, ""Catch me if you can""

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
He only paused a moment when
He heard them holler, stop

Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye

Was wasted time but then I chose to lay it on the line

Ahí no sé contigo que pasará
Solo te digo mamita que ya no te quiero mirar

Yo no sabia lo que perdía
Y me castigo todos los días al no tenerte
Que solo vivo de tus recuerdos solo suspiro
Pues te he perdido ahora lo sé
Y un día te fuiste sin despedirte

Hoy solo le doy besos al aire
Me estoy muriendo por tocarte
Hoy solo le doy besos al aire
Como quisiera acariciarte

Ya no te intereso no me extrañas
No me quieres ni mirar, ni mirar
Por un beso yo acabé las tentaciones
Veo tus labios lo siento mucho has perdonado
Las traiciones
Mira ahora por ser cobarde
En vez de darte besos a ti solo le doy
Besos al aire

Si alguna vez te dije te quiero
Yo te ofrecí un cariño sincero
Y que pasó te ganó la tentación
Y me partiste en dos el corazón
Ahí no sé contigo que pasará
Solo te digo mamita que ya no te quiero mirar

Hoy solo le doy besos al aire (no te quiero mirar)

America To Mars,"Just for the record let's get the story straight
Me and Uncle Tom were fishin' it was gettin'
Pretty late
Out on a cypress limb above the wishin' well
Where they say is got no bottom say it take
You down to Hell.
Over in the bushes and off to the right
Come two men talking; in the pale moonlight
Sheriff John Brady and Deputiy Hedge
Haulin' two limp bodies down to the water's edge
I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin oh yea
I know a secret that I just can't tell
They didn't see me and Tom in the tree
Neither one believin' what the other could see
Tossed in the bodies let 'em sink on down
To the bottom of the well
Where'd they never be bound
I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin oh yea
I know a secret that I just can't tell
I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin
Know a secret that I just can't tell
I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin
Know who put the bodies in the wishin' well
Soon as they were gone me and Tom got down
Prayin' real hard that we wouldn't make a sound
Runnin; through the woods back to Uncle Tom' shack
Where the full moon shines throught the roof tile cracks
Oh my God Tom who re we gonna tell
The sheriff belongs in a prison cell
Keep your mouth shut that's what we're gonna do
Unless you wanna wind up in the wishin' well too.
I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin
I know a secret that I just can't tell
I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin

American Aquarium,"Well I burned my fair share
Of bridges here and bridges there
And I gave into every hazard of the occupation
For years I called a highway home
But I never got good at sleepin' alone
And I earned every letter of my bad reputation

See it's a blurry line between wrong and right
'Cause what feels so good on a Saturday night
Hurts like hell come Sunday mornin'
I's standin' there when she walked in
And her eyes lit up with a sideways grin
Head got light and my chest caved without warnin'

If it weren't for that woman, Lord, I don't know where I'd be
I gave up the drinkin' 'fore she gave up on me

Well I might as well have been an Irishman
'Cause me and old John Jameson
Spent many nights burnin' both ends of that candle
Back in my wild and younger days
Boy, lemme tell ya, I could put 'em away
But come closin' time, oh man, I's hard to handle

If it weren't for that woman, Lord, I don't know where I'd be
I gave up the drinkin' 'fore she gave up on me

It was late one summer in old Cow Town
We were shuttin' down the Motor Lounge
Then and there it hit me 'bout as serious as a heart attack
So I ordered one last drink and I paid
And I bid farewell to my ramblin' days
And I walked out that front door and I didn't look back

American Aquarium,"Wide-eyed and twenty-one, 'nother shot of Jameson
To calm my nerves before this nightly masquerade
What people saw as nonchalant, a complex conditioned response
A chemical reaction, brown liquor and self-doubt

So that I can stand up on this stage like a guilty child avoidin' blame
I'd kick, I'd scream, I'd curse the names of the girls who walked away
You see the man left holdin' the pen controls how every story ends
And truth becomes a martyr for the sake of the song

Yeah I'm in a good place
I'm a-walkin' that straight line
I'm just gettin' along, rightin' these wrongs
One day at a time

For years the drinks were just a crutch until the drinks were just too much
I guess it comes with the job, hail, hail, rock'n'roll
You see songs fulfill a human need to sit back and watch another man bleed
So for a moment, we don't have to feel sorry for ourselves

And this imaginary confidence became the first line of defense
If you don't let 'em in, boy, they'll never let you down
But she broke through and took control, my sweetheart of the rodeo
And for the first time I found somethin' I couldn't afford to lose

Yeah I'm in a good place
I'm a-walkin' that straight line

As the world outside passed us by
When the morning's embrace
Shed a light on your face

When the only thing harder than the work is the luck

Tough times don't last
Tough folks do

See I come from a long line of Carolina farmers
For years, tobacco was the answer
It kept the lights on and put food on the table
'Til the doctors started callin' it cancer
So we took to the hills of the Blue Ridge Mountains
With a harvest of corn and some copper line
And we found you can get a little slice of heaven
With some sugar yeast water and a whole lotta time

Life ain't fair
Saddle up, boy, and see it through
Tough times don't last
But tough folks do

Where I'm from a man's only worth the weight of his word and
Respect ain't handed out, it's earned
I've been runnin' with my back to the wall for seventeen years now
And if it's one thing that I've learned, it's ...

I've seen visions in my sleep
Of a man running through the wild
With all these ghosts, a lonely gho-ost

Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road
Sit tight, take hold, Thunder Road

Well, I got this guitar and I learned how to make it talk
And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk
From your front porch to my front seat
The door's open but the ride ain't free
And I know you're lonely for words that I ain't spoken
But tonight we'll be free, all the promises'll be broken

There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away
They haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned-out Chevrolets
They scream your name at night in the street
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet
And in the lonely cool before dawn
You hear their engines rolling on
But when you get to the porch, they're gone on the wind
So Mary, climb in
It's a town full of losers, I'm pulling out of here to win",Thunder Road,2005

American Buckaroo Orchestra,"Spanish is the lovin' tongue
Soft as springtime, light as spray
There was a girl I learned it from
Living down Sonora way
Now I don't look much like a lover
Yet I say her love words over
Late at night when I'm all alone
""Mi amor, mi corazon""

There were nights when I would ride
She would listen for my spurs
Fling that big door open wide
Raise those laughing eyes of hers
And how those hours would get to flyin'
Pretty soon, I'd hear her cryin'
""Please don't leave me all alone
Mi amor, mi corazon""

Then one night I had to fly
I got into a foolish gamblin' fight
I had a swift goodbye
In that black unlucky night
And traveling north, her words kept ringing
And every word I could hear her singing
""Please don't leave me all alone
Mi amor, mi corazon""

Well, I ain't never seen her since that night
I can't cross the line now
She was Mexican, and I was White
Like as not, it's better so
And yet I've always sort of missed her
Since that last wild night I kissed her
I left my heart, but I lost my own

Nothing they wouldn't do
To have you along

I got too many problems
They just don't understand
They think their every wish
Is my command

You're in a win or lose affair
Wish I could be there

Dance turn into a romance

Get up, get down, move around, cover ground
Throw it on the brother now, you swore

Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,1991

Make it like when 'The Breeders' were big,
Everyone would sing along, sing along our favorite songs

I got a picture of a photograph of you,
Riding in my car playing 'Big Star'
It's never growing old blasted mellow cold.

How we love to sleep
At the close of day
When the joys of the day fade away and the memories sweet
Of the day repeat 
In our dreams they creep
While we sleep, sleep, sleep
It seems that daytime was just made for laughter and song
Evening brings romance to lovers as they stroll along
Night time brings rest to the weary
Sooths all the hearts that are dreary
Leaves us alone with our day dreams
Brings back sweet golden love dreams while we sleep, sleep, sleep

Blending in a soft and sweet refrain
As around the floor, dear, we are dancing
Swaying to a fascinating strain
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low 
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
 
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
Ev'ry little movement of the band

Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Time running dry

And pickled animal parts

For the well-preserved at heart

Doctor I feel fine

Every grape on the vine

Hey look here it comes
My great big luxury ufo
Now drive this thing and go fast
Why are we moving so slow

Around the animal pen
I'm running happily in the sun
I'll end up in the shade again

American Music Club,"The wind pulls me around
And everything it touches turns weak
An antique or an eyelash stuck in your cheek

The paper thin skin of a crowd chasing you
Down a lost and dead-end trail
With a guilt no alibi can curtail

The world is held together by the wind
That blows through Gena Rowland's hair

Land ahoy I fill my weak lungs with this joy
Dizzy on the deck hopin' that I'd last until we land
With an envelope burning a hole in my hand

Bearing the names of the winners who walked away
From the games that the slaves love to play
To replace the air and the sea, leaving you no way to fly to me

The world is held together by the wind
That blows through Gena Rowland's hair

Through the window, the warm summer air does a two-step
I wish I could think of some way I could keep it
And clear away the mission street in my head

That keeps this watery weariness in our bed and
Sets up more windmills that all waste my time missing
When it should just be your lips that I'm kissing

Don't tell me that you don't wanna hear
The clock ticking on the shelf by our bed, oh it's so near
Let the light turn green and leave us just like fear
There's a light turnin' green leavin' us without a prayer

That blows through Gena Rowland's hair

With my penny's worth of hope, that's not funny but it's a joke
And I got a good one for the collection agency
It's a wish that I could wish the world away, I could wish the world away

Don't watch TV, it's all lies, I watch TV day and night
I believe everything I see and I can't turn it off
The only thing that kept me together in the good old days
Was a wish that you could wish the world away

Yeah, you could wish the world away

Mother@#$%&! comes up in my face
And says ""I'm livin' my final glory and you've got nowhere to run
No one to answer to but my gun""
Take your hate shelf my pride
I'd fly low to get you high
I'd embrace I'd lie
Anything just to free your mind
Control never comes so easy when you're suckin' your final breath
Your mind is tellin' you there's seconds left
Well I've held my hand to nothin' and I've pushed my fears away
But now I fear I've seen the darkest day
Take your hate shelf my pride
I'd fly low to get you high
I'd embrace I'd lie
Anything to free your mind
Take your place do your time anything just to
The choice is made drop the blade my head is sinkin' anyway
My choice is fate another victim of the system under hate
Take your place do your time
Anything just to¡­

That's okay man we're all dyin'
To just give it away
Sorry it don't live here anymore
You know just exactly what it's for
And I didn't feel like fallin' down today

How long?
I say not long

We'd carry their crosses if we were kings
Straight if you could just stay straight with me
I'd stay around

Could we would we fly away

American Pearl,"Coming down before you
Is easier than spillin' on the ground
Pour my soul inside you
It's all that you can do now to spit it out
Fallen down around you
Another name to pick up off the floor
Colors bleed right through you
It's from your mouth where your true colors pour
Now I'm rearin' my ugly head
Spinnin' wheels and blinded
Took seven years to find it
But I'm learning to fly
Fallin' down around you
Walls are leaning hard on your grace
Crumble in and abort you
Wreckin' ball the walls of this place
Rear my ugly head
Took seven years to find it
But I'm learning to fly

American Pearl,"Look through these eyes do ya know what you're seein'
Once held the blue sky now colors are fadin'
God in your soul hell in your hands
Swallow it down whole mother depression
I could lead the way forget my hell to pay
I would die if it would just make you believe
But would you let it go this I gotta know
If you could let it be
Found my religion cut on a table
Mirror stares back at a man who's not able
Words of a savior ringin' through my head
Give to us this day our daily bread
I would stand like a king ruling under one love
I could be your hero and you the truth I'm thinkin' of
I would stand like a king ruling under one love
I could be your hero if only you could let it be
The truth would set you free

American People's Chorus,"In seventy-six the sky was red
thunder rumbling overhead
Bad King George couldn't sleep in his bed
And on that stormy morn, Ol' Uncle Sam was born.
Some birthday! 

Ol' Sam put on a three cornered hat
And in a Richmond church he sat
And Patrick Henry told him that while America drew breath
It was ""Liberty or death."" 

What kind of hat is a three-cornered hat?
Did they all believe in liberty in those days? 

Nobody who was anybody believed it.
Ev'rybody who was anybody they doubted it.
Nobody had faith.
Nobody but Washington, Tom Paine, Benjamin Franklin,
Chaim Solomon, Crispus Attucks, Lafayette. Nobodies.
The nobodies ran a trea party at Boston. Betsy Ross
organized a sewing circle. Paul Revere had a horse race. 

And a little ragged group believed it.
And some gentlemen and ladies believed it.
And some wise men and some fools, and I believed it too.
And you know who I am.
No. Who are you mister? Yeah, how come all this?
Well, I'll tell you. It's like this... No let us tell you.
Mister Tom Jefferson, a mighty fine man. 
He wrote it down in a mighty fine plan.
And the rest all signed it with a mighty fine hand
As they crossed thier T's and dotted their I's
A bran' new country did arise. 

And a mighty fine idea. ""Adopted unanimously in Congress July 4, 1776,
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created 
equal.
That they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable 
rights.
That among these rights are Life, Yes sir!, Liberty, That's right!
And the pursuit of happiness."" 
Is that what they said? The very words.
That does sound mighty fine. 

Buildiing a nation is awful tough.
The people found the going rough.
Still nobody who was anybody believed it.
Everybody who anybody they stayed at home.
But Lewis and Clarke and the pioneers,
Driven by hunger, haunted by fears,
The Klondike miners and the forty niners,
Some wanted freedom and some wanted riches,
Some liked to loaf while others dug ditches.
But they believed it. And I believed it too,
And you know who I am.
No, who are you anyway, Mister? 

Well, you see it's like this. I started to tell you.
I represent the whole... Why that's it!
Let my people go. That's the idea!
Old Abe Lincoln was thin and long,
His heart was high and his faith was strong.
But he hated oppression, he hated wrong,
And he went down to his grave to free the slave. 

A man in white skin can never be free while his black brother is in 
slavery,
""And we here highly resolve that these dead shall not haave died in 
vain.
And this government of the people, by the people and for the people
Shall not perish from the Earth.""
Abraham Lincoln said that on November 19, 1863 at Gettysburg, 
Pennsylvania.
And he was right. I believe that too. 

Say, we still don't know who you are, mister.
Well, I started to tell you...
The machine age came with a great big roar,
As America grew in peace and war.
And a million wheels went around and 'round.
The cities reached into the sky,
And dug down deep into the ground.
And some got rich and some got poor.
But the people carried through,
So our country grew.

Still nobody who was anybody believed it.
Everybody who was anybody they doubted it.
And they are doubting still,
And I guess they always will,
But who cares what they say whem I am on my way 

Say, will you please tell us who you are?
What's your name, Buddy? Where you goin'? Who are you?
Well, I'm the everybody who's nobody, 
I'm the nobody who's everybody.
What's your racket? What do you do for a living? 

Well, I'm an
Engineer, musician, street cleaner, carpenter, teacher,
How about a farmer? Also. Office clerk? Yes sir!
That's right. Certainly!
Factory worker? You said it. Yes ma'am.
Absotively! Posolutely!
Truck driver? Definitely!
Miner, seamstress, ditchdigger, all of them.
I am the ""etceteras"" and the ""and so forths"" that do the work.
Now hold on here, what are you trying to give us?
Are you an American? 
Am I an American?
I'm just an Irish, Jewish, Italian, 
French and English, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, Polish, 
Scotch, Hungarian, Swedish, Finnish, Greek and Turk and Czech 

And that ain't all.
I was baptized Baptist, Methodist, Congregationalist, Luthern, 
Atheist, Roman Catholic, Jewish, Presbyterian, Seventh Day Adventist,
Mormon, Quaker, Christian Scientist and lots more.
You sure are something. 

Our country's strong, our country's young, 
And her greatest songs are still unsung.
From her plains and mountains we have sprung,
To keep the faith with those who went before. 

We nobodies who are anybody believe it.
We anybodies who are everybody have no doubts.
Out of the cheating, out of the shouting.

Deep as our valleys,
High as our mountains,
Strong as the people who made it.
For I have always believed it, and I believe it now,
And now you know who I am.
Who are you?

So we started to dance
In my arms, she felt so inviting
And I just couldn't resist
Just one little kiss, so exciting

Then I heard the guitar player say
""Vamos, Jose's on his way""
Then I knew, yes I knew I should run
But then I heard her say, yeah

""Come a little bit closer
You're my kind of man
So big and so strong
Come a little bit closer
I'm all alone and the night is so long""

Then the music stopped
When I looked the cafe was empty
Then I heard Jose say
""Man, you know you're in trouble plenty""

So I dropped my drink from my hand
And out through the window I ran
And as I rode away
I could hear her say to Jose, yeah

""Come a little bit closer
You're my kind of man
So big and so strong
Come a little bit closer
I'm all alone and the night is so long""",Come a Little Bit Closer,1999

It's a Braveheart party y'all
C'mon

Throw your hands up 'cause we want to dance
Don't be afraid just take a chance
'Cause this beat will rock your body
Get up on the floor and party
Now y'all tell me what y'all want to do
Thinkin' while I have a drink or two
Throw your hands up everybody
Get up on the floor and party

I move at night, respect my gangsta
Ready for whatever you bring, the mood is right
The club is righteous, tight with family
Squeezin on big old bubbles with no panties
Ladies who's sexually free
And once in a while live on the wild side, kinky & nasty
Middle fingers up and say ""Fuck the world""
Throw your hands up, they can't fuck with you girl
And my fellas, two time felons, two nine tote and lethal
Quick to leave you wide open, if you gettin' tore down
Blowin' a blunt cloud, and the DJ's makin' you feel thugged out
Put yo hands up

Throw your hands up 'cause we want to dance
Don't be afraid just take a chance
'Cause this beat will rock your body
Get up on the floor and party
Now y'all tell me what y'all want to do
Thinkin' while I have a drink or two
Throw your hands up everybody
Get up on the floor and party

I pull in a V12 drop all red
Look at ma with that cat paw tat on'er leg
Come here girl can I kiss you, let me lick you
Show you what your body made for, you're official
You could be my baby mama lookin like that
What you drink, champagne or Cognac
What you like dancin diamonds, Dolce Gabbana
Fendi, Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Prada
A nigga like Jungle to always come through
Shine in yo hood whenever the fuck you want to
Cause I'ma B.R.A.V., E.H.E.A.R.T. from QB
Put'em up...

Throw your hands up 'cause we want to dance
Don't be afraid just take a chance
'Cause this beat will rock your body

Let's drink, no fights (Let's drink, no fights)
Party all night (Whachu wan' do?)
Let's drink, no fights (Drink up...c'mon, yeah, yeah...)

I'm blaze, haze for days
Blackout thinkin' of ways to get paid
Mac out corner I got it's all laid
Shorty, with a nice round ass in my face
Now do she want me to touch her?
Or do she want me to see?
Fuck is she comin wit me
A true BHG Wiz, not complex
Chin checks if it get hectic
Nigga Braveheart respected
Get bent at the bar, talk shit, walk it
And if I can't talk it, the false big cop a case
I'm here to blaze, roll up a dutch and take it to the face
Throw yo hands up

Throw your hands up 'cause we want to dance

If you need me baby I'm, for, real
The rest of your life, I'll take you to paradise,
If you want it baby just, be, real
The rest of your life, I'll take you to paradise,
I'm gonna give-a-you all my love, yeah

We went through this before
Actin' like the L's can't bag 'em no more
Nightgown draggin' on the heated marble floor
Flash Cartier when you open up the door, slide these on baby

So butter, still relate to the gutter
Just your life style's different, spirit uplifted
Fell in love with a cat who's gifted
Turn you back to paradise, damn I missed it

Pop a bottle, light a purple candle
I got somethin' that you can't quite handle, that's why you love me
Pour bubbly, glow from the flame make your skin shine lovely
I'm saying baby

Touch it why don'tcha (oh) touch it why don'tcha (oh)
Touch it why don'tcha (hey) touch it why don'tcha (mm)
Hey girl, aw, girl!
Hey girl, I want to rock your world

The rest of your life, I'll take you to paradise,
(Paradise, is very nice)
If you want it baby just, be, real
The rest of your life, I'll take you to paradise (uh, uh)
I'm gonna give-a-you all my love, yeah

Next phase is this
Black sand, Tahiti, ten days to reminisce
God's my witness (uh)
I paid the price for paradise, so I'm livin' this

I never limit myself, the L's fearless
Lay back while I illuminate the darkness
Like it smooth don'tcha
Make it move won'tcha, think I won't?

Take you to your peak I know them other cats don't
And it won't stop, this is beyond paper
First I get your mind right, then I might drape ya
Never pimpin', raise my girls well

Young thoroughbreds get schooled by Uncle L.L.
See-double, L tattooed on the bubble
I lay the mink down, let you walk over a puddle
True love is so rare
But don't you worry I ain't going nowhere

[Chorus] 

Trust me, trust me, trust, me, baby
Rest of your life I'll take you to paradise
I'll take you to paradise, oh
So won't you try me, try me, try, this, lady
Rest of your life I'll take you to paradise
I'm gonna give-a-you all my love, yeah

Belly to belly, one hand on the jelly
At the telly on the celly, get that money Elle
Please believe it, if the mind can conceive it
Then the man can achieve it, you gotta breathe it

And I breathe deep, I'm one with the universe
Minimum, ten percent go to God first
Lay back baby, close your eyes
Ice on the pinky finger froze your thighs

So much shade baby, the water bed fries
Walk around nude in the suite yelling, ""Recognize!""
Do your dance, baby pour me a class
It feels so good to have the world in a smash

Touch it why don'tcha (oh) touch it why don't ya (oh)
Touch it why don'tcha (hey) touch it why don't ya (mm)
Hey girl, aw, girl!
Hey girl, I want to rock your world

Yea yea, gotta keep your eyes on the prize baby
Sky's the limit
If you can see it, you can be it
Ha ha, it's on you, word up
Everybody put your hands in the air
It's high time baby
One love, one God, recognize

If you need me, just call me
Said if you want me, just be for real
And if you like me, come and talk to me
And if you want me, tell me how you feel

Amerie,"Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, Nas, uh, yo, yo
Life, they wonder, can they take me under?
Nah, never that, nah, yo, yo

I come from the housing tenement buildings
Unlimited killings, menaces marked for death
Better known as the projects where junkies and rock heads dwell
Though I owe to it my success
With survival of the fittest, everyday is a chal'
I would think I'm a part of U.S.A. and be proud
Confronted with racism, started to feel foreign
Like, the darker you are the realer your problems
I reached for the stars but I just kept slipping
On this life mission, never know what's next
Ancient kings from Egypt, up to Julius Cezar
Had a piece of the globe, every continent
Yo, there's Asia, Africa, Europe, France, Japan
Pakistan, America, Afghanstan
Yo, there's Protestants, Jews, Blacks, Arabics
Call a truce, world peace, stop acting like savages
No war, we should take time and think
The bombs and tanks makes mankind extinct
But since the beginning of time it's been men with arms fighting
Lost lives in the Towers and Pentagon, why then?
Must it go on, we must stop the killing
Tell me why we die, we all God's children

World is hating, that's forever (uh, c'mon)
It's time that we stand together (yeah, for the world)
Everybody wants to rule the world (what, what, what, what, what, c'mon)
World (peace), world (peace), world (peace), world

Yo, there's brothers on the block, posted up like they own it
That's they corner, from New York to California
Got blocks locked down
Like, ""dog you safe whenever you with me, see this is my town""
So the youngsters, grows in ghettos, goes to prison
At an early age, already know it's against him
So in order for him to survive, one day he must
Open up his eyes to the set backs and rise
'Cause, everybody wants a shot, in this land of opportunity
Look at what this country's got
There shouldn't be nobody homeless
How can the president fix other problems when he ain't fixed home yet
The earth wasn't made for one man to rule alone
To all colors increases, to home it belongs
I want land, mansions, banks and gold
The diamonds in Africa, oil in my control
The world's natural resources, all it's residuals
But then comes foes, I have to guard it with missiles
And I become the most wanted
But is it worth hearing a million people problems and followed by Secret Service
I guess, attempts at my life with loaded barrels
So move over Colin Powell or just throw in the towel, yo

World is hating, that's forever (uh, c'mon)
It's time that we stand together (yeah, for the world)
Everybody wants to rule the world (what, what, what, what, what, c'mon)
World (peace), world (peace), world (peace), world

Y'all know that's my style, to hit you at the right time
No other compares to what Nas write down
Tell you my dreams, show you my pain is yours
You could get what you love, be a chain in cause
You alive right now
There's so many that's dead or locked up inside the beast, I'm a hot light now
It's whatever man think of manifest to the real
The plan is to wake up 'cause time reveals
All this hate can't forever last
All my ghetto heroes in Heaven, it's like you right here and never passed
You just transcend, I know I'm goin' see you again
Hoping I reach the world leaders and win
Ain't nothing without struggle, listen up, it's critical
We used to fear arms, now the weapons are chemical
In Hip-Hop, the weapons are lyrical
To be the best you challenge the best, then the blessings are spiritual
Top of the world for the kid and unless
Popping any rapper's head off his shoulders no contest
I know the Most High hear me, so fly you can't near me
You scared of a mirror, my theory is that - knowledge is power
To every projects and every street corner, we gotta get ours now

World is hating, that's forever (uh, c'mon)
It's time that we stand together (yeah, for the world)
Everybody wants to rule the world (what, what, what, what, what, c'mon)
World

Yo, niggas ain't forget shit, know what I'm saying?
Niggas ain't forget nothing
Men, women and children killed by the police and shit
Niggas ain't gon' forget that, you know what I mean?
Yo, what this war just show me is like, whatever you want out of life
Whatever you feel is rightfully yours, go out and take it
Even if that means blood and death
You know, that's what I was raised up on, that's what this country's about

Listen, yo
Little Royce Nickel Nine, eyes wide with sight
With a future as bright as the light in the eyes of Christ
Ready to take on the world and whatever is in it
Proof read, sign, and seal whatever you finish
I can only lead you while you're on your quest for knowledge
I'ma teach you to have sense and to respect the dollar
Hope for the best, and you'll see, your world will be solid
I'ma teach you the truth, even behind worldly logic
This is life, cut and dry, days is bright, nights is dark
Fights get sparked, it's almost like to get ahead
You got to be twice as smart, the realities of life is harsh
Just know that God's keeping you level
He'll even speak through the ghetto to reach you
Just to teach you that the streets is the devil
Everybody's dishonest, different
Which means that we're dying by livin'
Oblivious to the time that we're given
So you don't prepare for the death, you live for the life
And live right like, do right by your kids and your wife
Have fun as a child, yo them years is precious 
The future brings fear and stresses as the year progresses
You're gonna turn a lot of them down, you're gonna feel rejection
You're gonna tell a lot of lies and you're gonna hear confessions
It's a two way street when you deal in his presence 
Only your life can show that everything is real in this message
This is life

[Chorus]

[Royce]
Yo, the whole world is upon you, the pressure is on
And you can probably sum your life up the best when you're gone
Upon the creation of all men, destiny's born
For us to reproduce, so you can keep the legacy goin'
I know you think I'm Superman, but I got weaknesses too
I keep a firm leash on things by believing in you 
And after I'm gone I live on breathing through you 
And anything I had in this life, I leave it to you
Aim for the sky and fly till you come back down
I had you the baton and you run, till you come back 'round
Let your heart tell your temper, ""Put that gun back down!""
Dry your tears up and turn that frown upside-down
It'd be plenty to cry for, think life, not death
You got much more to live for than to die for
But you got to stay humble 
Cause just as hard as your work to get it
There's people working harder to take it from you
Cause life, something that people take for granted
As time passes, you're gonna want something back
But you won't get it cause history is made every second
So you crave every lesson and save every blessin'
No matter how you view the world yo, you never will get it
The world will be the world through the eyes of whoever is in it
But things ain't gonna always go right
Look at it like, yo this ain't your day, but this your life, and live
Life

But don't let them, don't let them, don't let them bring you down

[Chorus:]
Said it ain't to much for me 
To have you next to me 
I can't believe it 
All the things I do 
To keep you loving me 
And its just to much for me 
To not have you by my side 
Cause no matter what your going through

That be up in the coats I wear 
Wherever I go so there ya have it 
Cashmere fabrics never caught in last years garments 
Holsters under armpits chauffers and the charms lit 
And the coders holding on the dons wrist

I can't imagine life without you
My mama, my roll dog

Anything you need from me, Ma, you know that it's yours
You're the only woman in my life that I adore
I remember back in the days when we couldn't get much
TV's wasn't covered and the floor was tore up
How you juggle three jobs just to take care of me
Yo baby boy, Bow Weezy
Late night shifts, daytime to the AM
Comin' home late, there was my best friend
My soul mate, yes, my big brother
The one who tucked me in, put me under the covers
When I had nightmares, you came right away
Read me bedtime stories and chased them away
My beautiful black queen, my everything
The one that keeps this heart pumpin' everyday
I'm a young man now
But my plan is to show you that I really understand
Mom, I love you

[Chorus: x2]

Look at you now
You sittin' up on top of the world
Got a X5 and a Benz just to swerve
Gotcha dream house now
Sittin' on big land, big money, big jewels, big game plan
You told me one day I'ma make it this far
Have God in my life and I'm goin' be the star
I did it, well, look where we at
Don't have to worry 'bout past due bills and all that
Don't have to worry 'bout them bill collectors all on yo back
Don't worry
If you ain't got it, I got your back
Don't even worry 'bout you working 3 jobs real late
Don't even have to worry when you have no food to put on the plate
Back then, I didn't understand but I do now
I look back and I reminisce on how it all went down
Went from bad to good, from frowns to smiles
Mom, I really love you, understand now
I love you

[Chorus: x2]

Thank you for loving me
Say what now
Thank you for holding me down
Say what now
I know that you care for me
Sing that
Cause you've always been around
Kick it back and
Thank you for loving me
Say what now
Thank you for holding me down
Say what now
I know that you care for me
Say what
Cause you've always been around

Amerie,"[Chorus]
I don't care, I just wanna be yours
I know I told you I'd
Never love you the way that I did again
After all that you did to me
But I got to say
I don't care, I just wanna be yours
And I am trying everything in my power
To never ever say
Please come back to me
But I got to say

Promised me
You'd always be
You'd never let me go
You took the ring and
All the things that came with being my girl

The tragedy as I walked through that door
You had your feet up over the seat
All I heard was screaming
It was just like a movie
Too real to be
That just can't be my bride to be, no

I was shocked this could be
Never thinking one day I'd take
This blow blow blow
I was starting to feel like
I should kill everything that was moving, whoa
Never been in hell like this
Somebody wake me up

[Chorus]

Crazy boy was he just kept going
'Cause she was the only one that had noticed me
Staring into the eyes
That I will one day call my babe
How could I've fallen so in love
With someone I'd known for years
Not even know that
She'd be the one
To reveal my worst fears

It was just like a movie
Too real to be that just can't be my bride to be no
I was shocked this could be
Never thinking one day I'd take
This blow blow blow
I was starting to feel like
I should kill everything that was moving, whoa
Never been in hell like this
Somebody wake me up

I didn't mean to do
All those things to you
Tell me what to do to make it up to you
I'll do everything, anything that you want me to

I didn't mean to do
All those things to you
Tell me what to do, oh, to make it up to you
I'll do everything, anything that you want me to

Should I leave should I go
Should I break apart
My mama said you would break my heart
I can't believe you would sleaze you a slut a hoe
Now you want to have a change of heart
Who'd have thought that you would deceive me
Love of my life

You're my queen like Evie
And you didn't even tell me you leaving
I had to hear about it on Escandalo T.V.
Now who's this man creeping in the back door
Out to hit him with the fo fo fo
I know you keep saying that you loving me so
But why the hell you crushing him for, god damn now!

I don't care that's what Ricky says
And if I catch him then he'll be dead
I don't play that mommy
Now back to the jerk you go
I left your Reebok's by the front door, kick rocks bitch

Pretty memories coming back to me but I remember
What you said to me when you walked away the other day
Is what I remember most
Trying to get past the things you said

Wishing I could just replace
Trying to erase all the pain

Our love what we once treasured
Your ways what I remember most of all
Can't quite get away from the days we love so heavenly
Your kiss such a sweet surrender
That day when I let my temper get the best of what we used to have
Now I got to ask you can you make it

[Chorus]
Like it used to be
Bring back your love to me
I remember when our love was new
And all I needed in my life was you
And baby it felt so right to me
Please make it like it used to be

Now I won't usually press nobody
But why can't worse as hastily
Before God had forgiven me
Thought the love that we had count for anything else
Only one way to find out how and you know how

[Chorus: x2]

Ohhh, don't want to lose your love
And I can't stand to lose your touch
Ohhh, I can still remember when our love was strong

But I can't help it but love ya

Why can't you say that you've been at her place
You hurry wash your clothes, the scent of her perfume

That's why I kiss her explicitly

She don't let nobody, no, no
She don't let nobody
Nobody but me

Some dudes, they think she's teasing
They think she wants to play
But she's so doggone pleasing
And hey, that's just her way

And no one's gonna steal her
She does what she wants to
She only lets me feel her
And then I know it's true

She don't let nobody, no, no
She don't let nobody, no, no
She don't let nobody, no, no
She don't let nobody, no, no

She don't let nobody, no, no
She don't let nobody
Nobody but me

In a day and age when you can't be sure
I've got one with a love that's pure
Guess you'd call her my lucky star
She goes out, but she don't go far

She don't let nobody, no, no
She don't let nobody
Nobody but me

Some dudes, they think she's teasing
They think she wants to play
But she's so doggone pleasing
And hey, that's just her way

And no one's gonna steal her
She does what she wants to
She only lets me feel her
And then I know it's true

She don't let nobody, no, no
She don't let nobody, no, no
She don't let nobody, no, no
She don't let nobody, no, no

She don't let nobody, no, no
She don't let nobody
Nobody but me

Sometimes it's gonna be days like this
Sometimes it's gonna be rain like this
Sometimes you're gonna feel pain like this
Sometimes you gotta work hard for it

Because when you feeling low
And you can't get no lower
That's when you know your close
Sometimes you gotta work hard for it

Woke up in the morning
It's another cloudy day
But that never mattered too much to me
'Cause it's still a new beginning
And I know I got it in me
Had my share of ups and downs
But now I know I can do anything

Some people think I'm aggressive
'Cause I know what I want
But that never mattered too much to me

Show me some body with no goal
Show me some body with no control
'Cause life is for living
So go and get it
When times get rough remember

[Chorus]

Because when you feeling low
And you can't get no lower
That's when you know your close
Sometimes you gotta work hard for it

Oh gotta get it
Hey hey hey
Sometimes the road may seem too far
You never really know for sure
If you're ever gonna make it
Sometimes the end may seem so far
You never really know for sure
If you got the strength to make it

But you gotta remember

[Chorus]

Because when you feeling low
And you can't get no lower
That's when you know your close
Sometimes you gotta work hard for it

Days like this
Rain like this

Do it cause I love it
Feel like this
Gotta work hard for it",Gotta Work [Album Version],2007
Amerie,"Now you've been around the world,
And you'd seen alot of girls,
But, you ain't neva seen a girl (look so fly like),
Now you've rolled through some hoods,
There's some girls that look good,
But, you ain't never seen a girl (look so fly like),
& you partied in some clubs
& some girls show you love,
But, you ain't never seen a girl look so fly like me
Baby, But chu never had a girl look so fly like me.

Now I'd done been around the world thought I'd seen it all
Er color, er shape, what I need and all,
Switch like seasons, when the summers, spring, & fall,
& back seat of my jeep, I'm chrome veet & all.
On the hunt for these girls were like my day to day,
I get em alone I jump em and then fade away,
I give it good so some of them won't stay away,
They try to lock me up, but I break away.
& to the day I lay my eyes on the princess,
& yu can tell she was a dime from a distance,
It took a minute to come to my senses,
She's the perfect match and God is my witness,
Now for the first time I've opened my eyes,
Put the glass in the air, now I toast to the sky,
Feels like I'm in heaven, & I'm hopin' to fly,
Baby girl come along for the ride, yu know why cuz I....

Now you've been around the world,
And you'd seen alot of girls,
But, you ain't neva seen a girl (look so fly like),

& some girls show you love,
But, you ain't never seen a girl look so fly like me
Baby, But chu never had a girl look so fly like me.

Now I ain't neva had a girl that was so fly,
Other guys come around, you actin' so shy,
You got em shakin' in their boots, and I know why,
Cuz they can't handle the truth and that's no lie,


As for me, I'm the one that you been dreamin' on,
& wen yu saw me I'm the one that yu were steamin' on,
& when yu need it I'm the shoulder that yu would be leanin' on,
Take off that Gucci and keep them vickie secrets on,
Let's take a flight because the world is our playground,
And buy houses from the lou, to the A-Town,
It's silk sheets so it's soft when yu lay down,
Ching-a-ling yea, I get down, and stay down,
There's no one better baby girl you'sz a blessin',
You got me headin' in a positive direction,
You got my vote, when yu re-up for election,
Cuz all I wanna do is give you love and affection.

Now you've been around the world,
And you'd seen alot of girls,
But, you ain't neva seen a girl (look so fly like),
Now you've rolled through some hoods,

Baby, But chu never had a girl look so fly like me.

Why yu wastin' your time, & boy, runnin' the streets,
When you can just come to me? [huh]
You know I got what you need,
I got what you want,
Boy, won't you come and see?
What if you never, [seen] a girl like me ever, [like me before]?
Won't you come inside, let me keep it dry,
Cuz, I'm, so, flyyyyy.

Right now you are probably wondering 
Where I am who I'm with and why you are reading this
But before I go into.. 
What I'm up to let me confess
Dear sweetheart 
I know about you're secret 
Where you've been, who you with, I saw you out with her
And yet you always try to maintain
How I got a good thing and I can't do better
Do you remember what you told me? 
Cause I remember it well (how could I forget)
Do you remember how you said no one could want me
And I said time will tell

that's why I'm so sorry 
That I couldn't be there 
To see the look up on your face
And I'm so sorry that it took me so long 
So long to put you an your place

I'm writin you this letter 
Just to let you know that 
That I still love you 
But I won't be comin back
You had me at hello 
Now I gotta say goodbye 
Cause one too many times you made me cry

I'm hopin that this find you well..

But you put me through a living hell

Keys are gone and I ain't lovin
So don't even bother 
To call my number 
Cause I got it changed

I gave my heart, gave my time 
And I got nothin
So it shouldn't be surprising

Do you remember how you said no one would want me

Thank you for everything you put me through
I've come so far alone

Never ever put me down
You're only made me strong

When I was younger girl nobody told me about the facts of life.
I was living in the clouds I didn't think about whats wrong or right.
So I didn't understand that playing games is what some people do.
I swore I didn't start my life until the day I fell in love with you.
And you kept taking me higher just to drop me off

Do you feel like a man? 
Cause you've got my heart in your hands.
And you took me high as you can, 
Higher just to drop me off.
Tell me did it make you feel good? 
(Ha) Treating me the way you would. (Ha)
Cause you took me high as you could. 
Higher just to drop me off.

When I was a younger girl nobody told me I would have to fight.
To keep my sanity I couldn't love because I'd lose my sight.
So mostly everything you did is send another gift you broke my heart.
Until you came around again, and I was right back at the very start.
And you kept taking me higher just to drop me off

Do you feel like a man? Cause you've got my heart in your hands.
And you took me high as you can, higher just to drop me off.
Tell me did it make you feel good? (Ha) Treating me the way you would. (Ha)
Cause you took me high as you could. Higher just to drop me off.
Higher just to drop me 
Let's go.

Does it make you feel good to know broke me that's what people say.
Does it make you feel good you broke me down. (Uh)

I give you all I have, till there's nothing left, 
And all the time I spent, I can't get that back so
I think of what to do, 
What I wish I knew, 
How to keep away from you. (Hey hey hey)

So do you feel like a man? 
Cause you've got my heart in your hand.
And you took me high as you can, higher just to drop me off.
Higher, higher, higher, you take me higher just to drop me off.
(hey, hey, hey hey hey, hey, hey, hey hey hey)
Tell me did it make you feel good? (Ha) 
Treating me the way you would. (Ha)
Cause you took me high as you could.

Amerie,"How can we make it love
When I don't trust
How can we make it love

How can we make it love
When I don't trust you we need more than love
Cause Everything is everything when were just making love

How can we make it love
When I don't trust you we need more than love

It's a bad situation
And I'm tired of pretending
Everything is alright when we argue half the time almost every night

It's a hard road I'm facing
So maybe I should keep it moving
Cause I can only trust you baby
As far as I can see what's in front of me

You keep telling me that I keep asking you these questions 
That don't make no sense but we both know they do.
Now we arguing and now you're leaving once again 
And I just sit here wondering what will I do

[Chorus]
How can we make it love
When I don't trust
How can we make it love

How can we make it love
When I don't trust you we need more than love
Cause Everything is everything when were just making love
How can we make it love
When I don't trust you we need more than love

Answer me this, now do you really wanna go there
Cause if we go just know we won't make it back
Just cause yo girlfriend said it don't make it fact
If anything her corny ass just make it wack.
We all say shit then take it back
I think I listen to too much drake in fact
Cause I'm the best you ever you had
Your friends just mad cause I'm the best they never had
If you don't trust nothing you can trust that
I come with new shit and have em like what's that
That's low so, encase you didn't know so
And trust me I don't even trust me

[Chorus]

How can we make it love
When I don't trust you we need more than love
Cause Everything is everything when were just making love

How can we make it love
When I don't trust you we need more than love

And I don't care that you're thinking
Every time you turn around I'm trippin'
I got my intuition and I got receipts
I ain't seeing things

It's hard to live with the question
Who you with and what you're doing
I'm keeping one eye open
So don't even try to Jedi my mind

You keep telling me that I keep asking you these questions 
That don't make no sense but we both know they do.

Now we arguing and now you're leaving once again 
And I just sit here wondering what will I do

[Chorus]

It's a hard road baby, it's a hard road baby
It's a hard road baby, loving you loving you yea
I don't trust you baby, I don't trust you baby
But I love you baby,
More than me, more than love, more than you",More Than Love,2009

Turned my sorrow into treasured gold

On a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her mama and her daddy
With the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was running low
On faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was going away too fast
And before she knew
She was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both her lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even had time to crash
She was so scared she threw her hands up in the air

Jesus take the wheel
Take it from my hands
Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
So Jesus take the wheel

It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat
Sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said I'm sorry for the way
I've been living my life
I know I've got to change
So from know on tonight

Take it from my hands

The moment you've all been waiting for,
In this corner, weighing a hundred and seventy five pounds,
With a record of seventeen rapes, four hundred a**aults, and four murders,
The undisputed, most diabolic villain in the world:
Slim Shady!

[Chorus]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
O-oh o-oh, b****es hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them
And there's really not that many of us.
Ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust.
It's on till the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk

OK, let's go

Back with Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk
Picture us, you'll just be another one bit the dust
Just one of my mothers sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt. Lick the wonder cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must I redeem my name and haters get mushed.
B****es lust. Man they love me when I lay in the cut.
Fist the cup. The lady gave her eighty some paper cut.
Now picture us. It's ridiculous you curse at the thought
Cause when I spit the verse the s***
Gets worse then Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary. The elephants have entered the room.
I venture to say we're the center of attention it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance so here's the signal
Of the bat symbol. The platinum trio's back on you hoes.

[Chorus]

Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre

They see that low rider go by they're, like Oh my!
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick 'cause I know why.
I dip through in that six trey like sick 'em Dre.
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they sick of me.
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA.
Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends.
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again.
I'll be dammed, just f***ed around and crashed my Benz.
Driving around with a smashed front end
Let's cash that one in.
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Dorado
The hell if I know.
Do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions
Garage looks like Precision Collision.
Or Maaco beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though

And I take great pleasure in introducing, 50 Cent!

The money ain't a thing when you party with me
It's what we into it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm the bomb the don I'm King Kong
Get rolled on wrapped up and reigned on
I'm so calm through Vietnam ring the alarm
Bring the Shaun Dawn burn marijuana do what you want
N**** on and on till the break of what
Get the paper man I'm caking you know I don't give a f***
I spend it like it don't mean nothing
Blow it like its supposed to be blown
Motherf***er I'm grown
I stunt I style I flash the s***
I gets what the f*** I want so what I trick

These white boys trying to Backstreet they asses
Back in? The game done already had them
I handed they asses back at 'em

Escaped it, face it, it's too late, bitch
I'm gone now, chasing all that fame, haha

Downers, uppers for cowards
Wowzers, and you push me around-er?
Downwards is where you're going for now-ward
Yowzers, still complaining about your
Album like you were supposed to go platinum?
How can that happen, that I can't even fathom
Random how you went from digging in trash cans
On the streets of Hollywood to joining a clown clan
Bow down, on your knees, balls on your chin now
How about some deep-throating, let it all go down
Stick to your town, I'm here with Deuce Nation
Split it right there in the middle at Gower, blaow-blaow
Don't worry about our last encounter
Been counting all the minutes my final hour

Right by your side when you were in trouble

Trying to hit notes, the industry puzzled

Always pretending that you were my brothers
So I could get closer to you fuckers

Oh! The engineers would see him sittin' in the shade
Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by they would stop and say
Oh, my but that little country boy can play

Guess who's back 
Back again 
Shady's back 
Tell a friend 

Now everyone report to the dance floor 
To the dance floor, to the dance floor 
Now everyone report to the dance floor, alright stop
Pajama time 
Come here little kiddies, on my lap 
Guess who's back with a brand new rap 
And I don't mean rap, as in a new case 
Of child molestation accusation aah aah aah aah aah
No worries, pappa's got a brand new bag of toys 
What else could I possibly do to make noise, I done touched on everything, 
But little boys 
And that's not a stab at Micheal, that's just a metaphor, 
I'm just psycho 
I go a little bit crazy sometimes 
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes 
Good God, dip, do a little slide 
Bend down, touch your toes and just glide, up the center of the dance floor 
Like T-P for my bung hole and it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know who'd hear it 
Give a little ""poot poot"", it's OK 
Oops my C-D just skipped 
And everyone just heard you let one rip, 

[Chorus] 
Now I'm gonna make you dance, it's your chance, 
Yeah boy shake that ass, 
Oops I mean girl 
Girl girl girl (Now you know you're my world)

Oh baby Aah aah, Oh baby baby aah aah 

It's Friday and it's my day, chance to party 
All the way to Sunday, maybe till Monday, I dunno what day 
Everyday's just a holiday 
Crusin' on the freeway feelin' kinda breezy 
Get the top down, let my hair blow, 
I dunno where I'm goin' 
All I know is when I get there, someones gonna touch my body 
Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk 
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work 
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair 
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out, yeah 
Now what's your name girl, what's your sign?
Man, you must be up out your mind 
Dre aah aah, beer goggles, blind, I'm just trying to unwind, now I'm

It's Tuesday and I'm locked up, 
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened 
They say I was running butt naked 
Down the street screaming aah aah aah aah aah 
Your honor I'm sorry, I don't remember 
All I know is this much, I'm not guilty 
They said save it boy, we got you on tape 
Telling an old lady to ""touch my body"" 
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down 
It gets real tense, no one makes a sound 
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now 
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves 
Now step back to reality, look it's B.Rabbit, you signed me up to battle?
I'm a grown man chuba chuba chuba chuba chuba chuba
I don't have any lines to go right here so 
Duba duba teletubie fella's what? fella's yeah? 
Grab you left (nut), make right one jealous what? 
Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls, tall girls, small girls, 
I'm calling all girls 
Everyone report to the dance floor, it's your chance for a little romance or 
Butt squeezing it's the season
Just go aah aah aah aah, it's so appeasin'

Now I'm gonna make you dance, it's your chance, 
Yeah boy shake that ass,

I smacked him in his face with an eraser,
Chased him with a stapler
Stapled his nuts to a stack of papers (Ow!)

Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup

Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn!)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper

You know you blew up when the women rush your stands

Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh!)

Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady

Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee.""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD

All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you

I'm like a head trip to listen to, ‘cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than 90% of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can
Kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, ‘cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm 30
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up

And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

I go tit for tat with anybody who's talking this shit and that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby, you can get stomped by Obie
You thirty six year old bald headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let it go its over
Nobody listens to Techno
Now lets go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes this shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy
Hey, there's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It will be so empty without me

Now this looks like a job for me

Put this cake in your face

But I wanna lick the icing off
Give it to her it in the worst way

But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife, in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight, while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off of love drunk from my hate
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more that I suffer
I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown
She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me,
And I love it, wait
Where you going, I'm leaving you
No you ain't, come back
We're running right back, here we go again
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful
I feel so ashamed, I snapped, who's that dude
I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her
I'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength

You ever love somebody so much
You can barely breathe, when you're with them, you meet
And neither one of you, even know what hit 'em,
Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're getting fucking sick, of looking at 'em
You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em,
Now you're in each others face,
Spewing venom, and these words, when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em,
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments, when you're in 'em
It's the rage that's the culprit, it controls you both
So they say it's best, to go your separate ways,
Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday
Yesterday is over, it's a different day
Sound like broken records, playin' over, but you promised her
Next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance,
Life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave,
Out the window, guess that's why they call it window pane

Now I know we said things, did things
That we didn't mean and we fall back into the same patterns
Same routine, but your temper's just as bad, as mine is
You're the same as me, but when it comes to love, you're just as blinded
Baby please come back, it wasn't you,
Baby it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens When a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much, to walk away now
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity, in my voice when I talk,
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall
Next time, there will be no next time
I apologize even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fucking leave again
I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

Tied up in sorrow, lost in my soul

And if you don't come back, come home to me, darling
You know that there'll be nobody else in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight

Ameritz - Tributes,"She was driving last Friday on her way to Cincinnati on a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her mama and her daddy with the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go, and she was running low on faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind, and she didn't pay attention
She was going way too fast
Before she knew it she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
And save me from this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel

It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said, ""I'm sorry for the way
I've been living my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight

Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands

I never bone alone, I got a nine in chrome
I used to be out of luck, now when I get a boner
it often means vagina miner get to the moaner
I mean really cause it's silly ? bumps that I broken
I guess you're gettin dumber ? in the summer
I didn't know a rap song could make your jock that long
Where's your mattress, is it strapped off?
I got a girl, now my dick it need a little rest
Can't be a freak, AIDS killin niggaz every week
So when I see the booty on a cutie
got to turn the other cheek
word to the diggidy diggidy D
So now I got damn groupie on my snoopy
A year ago, now you're up in the butt
Though I didn't know, that I would know, so many is good hoes
By the look that you chose, you're undercover pros
Praise the Lord, bless your soul
In your Gap and your tight clothes and your fake gold
I forgot the hair, gettin paid for your derriere
Shakin it and bakin it, while a nigga steady takin it
for a ride in a Benz or a Beamer
304 have you seen her? Have you seen her?
AM, pump with the trunk of funk
Won't luck fuck for a trunk of stuff
Wouldn't give me the play when I was Jay, now I'm G
She got the okay, she seen my CD (bitch)
And oh how she jocks
Callin in my shit on the Video Jukebox
Baby, I won't say maybe, I just say noooooooo
Don't be a 304

Now for the deuce, fans want to know who is who
Tres with the bass, mo' go 304 is a groupie
Stompin, AMG ain't from Compton
Better yet Bed-Stuy, N.Y.
Some of ladies want to know why I say bitch
To get rich or to make a point about a trick
A bitch is a woman who sucks and fucks
a dumb nigga for his duc's and bucks
A hoe is a girl that'll do the same
with no shame, and less game
And baby, I don't want neither
Bitches or hoes, I keep my shit in my Girbauds
or wrap it up tight in a jimmy hat
for a red bombudd and a hootie mack

Like playin craps with your dick in your hand, you understand?
So this is for the college and the high school crew
Cause why'all be out fuckin like a zoo

Rhea burnin' everytime you take a pee uh
So when you see a nigga out with his girl
Then baby play like you don't know me & we'll keep in a twirl

Buzzin off the kamikaze that I consumed 
Talk,kiss,grind tryin' to get get my balls off first

Hot bare back until I felt that quake

Goddamn I don't want to get sprung 
Take it out the pussy bust a nut on her tummy 
Ran home to tell my nigga Top 
About this cock that just wouldn't stop yeah

Pick up mine, bitch, here take a look

I want to see that rip

Yo, it ain't nothin' new (ain't nothin'), just a change in the name
Sheist done came and changed the game unexplained
Ways for days show you how to wait for your pay
Cause when Shade fuck up your sales, all your checks delay
And now niggas mad cause Shade can pull up in a Jag 
Hands free, chaperone all gettin' the door
And I ain't even interested in stealing your whore
So why these niggas actin like they want to marry the floor?
Like they ain't seen me breeze past all the gaurds at the door
Like I'm just wearin' this jacket to be hot
I flash the juice card, man this shit ain't hard
And It's the same thing at the same spot
What's my name?

I see that they just don't get it like my Nextel signal

Cards on the table, you can hit me or split 
And see now I fucked around and got Quik on the shit
So just imagine how many hips break when they dip
And all the excessive paper cuts from counting the grip
And how my legs hurt from humpin' back and forth in the whip
At only 35, coverage is a bitch on a six
And I ain't even got my first plaque yet (plaque yet)
Sheist, will still run circles over niggas who want it
And we ain't even gotta make the bets yet
Nigga what's my name?

Not up under the seat, up under my cheek
Like so close to me that when I move it squeaks
I ain't no big buff dude I'm a rap singer
I exercise one muscle that's my strap finger
And I can't call it how I see it no more
Cause these niggas'll take ya words back and twist em' like a pretzel
And these bitches be the same too
Comin' with that sob story crocodile tears trying to gang you
And that's exactly what the game do
And if you ever get caught dirty with a nigga she gon' blame you
So what in the hell you want to floss her for?
It's supposed to be bout' what a baller nigga cost that ho (yeah)
You givin' a game of black eye in ya S-5
While you niggas kick back poppin' X you let that 'cause' dry

Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.

Tu, sempre tu
Tornerai
Come un'onda da questo mare
Per poi andare via
Tempesta e desiderio mi lascerai
In questo ocean cuore che plu pace non ha
E mi trascinerai dove terra non see'e
E come la marea fuggirai via da me
Lontano da me fuggirai

Tu, solitudine profonda
Che nei silenzio griderai
Tu acqua e fuoco che m'inonda
Tu che non togli sete mai
Tu che non togli sete mai

Tu, sempre tu
Tornerai
Come un'onda da questo mare
Per poi andare via
Tempesta e desiderio mi lascerai
In questo ocean cuore che pace non ha
E mi trascinerai dove terra non see'e
Fuggirai via da me

It's not in the way it's you face in every street sign

I can recall every single time that we kiss

It's a struggle just for us to stay the same

Tonight I feel you come back home
Like a drifter finding shelter in these arms
Tonight I feel you've come back home
Yeah, and I know you were never really gone

It's not in the way you ignore me when I'm too proud
It's not in the way that you mock me when I'm too loud
No, it's not in the way that you comfort me when I cry
No, it's not in the way that you came back into my life

Oh life, it was why you were away
Made me wonder whether everything had changed

Tonight I feel you come back home
Like a drifter finding shelter in these arms
Tonight I feel you've come back home
Yeah, and I know you were never really gone

And we do the best we can
'Cause there is no choice
To choose this is something we can leave, oh no

Oh, but tonight I feel you come back home

She's only happy when it's grey

She never gets used to it
Used to it, used to it, yeah
Feels like a shadow
Of what she used to be, used to be

Thinking she had that certain something
But she learned it's just a trait
And it's worse the older that you get

So you don't come around, yeah
You're wasting your time

But I feel as though someone
Closed the sky
And you're a shadow, a shadow
Another woman I feel like I used to know

Yeah

Don't you patronize
Don't you look at me
With your drunken eyes
My indifference is a lot like yours
Though I can't escape

And your new life, baby
Throw caution to the wind
Everyone knows you're not coming back again

Because you're so beyond
That seems as though I never knew you
Here and now I see right through you
What have we become?

Is it too late to turn around?
To leave it all behind you?
With your shadow it served you well

But I will still hold on to pictures
Of the way that we used to be
And the way that I knew you once before
(Knew you once before)

You had me from the start
Our love was like communion
At peace with who we are
And what we could be
Singing in your car
Singing lines from movies

Staring in the dark
We were both so free
Things remind me of you lately
Looking back it drives me crazy
What have we become?

Is it too late to turn around?
To leave it all behind?
With your shadow it's served you well

Just enough of today's misery

But I'll be fine
I'm a little bored and lonely but that's life
It just seems to go one hundred zero
It never does pan out for me though
I'm hopeful that it will in good time

I'm dreamin' of the sound
Illuminated by the echo of the crowd
I wipe the window filled with snow
And look out at the open road

We talk all night though I'm not sure
He can hear me with closed eyes
But he tells me what I need to hear
Then he drifts away and disappears
And I'm older than my skin is in this life

I'm dreamin' of the sound
Illuminated by the echo of the crowd
I wipe the window filled with snow
And look out at the open road

I'm dreamin' of the sound
Illuminated by the echo of the crowd

And I know that they can not hurt me now
Yeah I know that they can not touch me now

Music makes me fly higher and higher
It drives me on, the heat under my skin
Music you're my brother, sister, lover
You complete me from without and from within

I've been cruel, I've hurt and left before
Looking back I only wanted more
You were there right from the very start
It was you, the one to win my heart

And I know that they can not hurt me now
Yeah I know that they can not touch me now

I can buy some gas

Amigos de Gines,"Follow that dream, I gotta follow that dream
Keep a-movin', move along, keep a moving
I've got to follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
I've got to follow that dream to find the love I need

When your heart gets restless, time to move along
When your heart gets weary, time to sing a song
But when a dream is calling you,
There's just one thing that you can do

Well, you gotta follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
You gotta follow that dream to find the love you need

Keep a-movin', move along, keep a moving
Got to find me someone whose heart is free
Someone to look for my dream with me
And when I find her I may find out
Just what my dreams are all about

I've got to follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
I've got to follow that dream to find the love I need

I've got to follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
I've got to follow that dream to find the love I need

Amigos de Gines,"There's a legend of a famous matador
Who went to meet El Toro
Though he fought as he had never done before
He could not beat, El Toro

The bull El Toro, brought him defeat and pain
And to his sorrow, the matador knew shame

They said time would never heal the many scars
Brought by the great, El Toro
And the bitterness that burned deep in his heart
Caused him to hate, El Toro

The bull El Toro, brought him defeat and pain
And to his sorrow, the matador knew shame

So one night, when no-one was on sight
The matador, went to finish the score
In the lonely fields, beneath the pale moonlight
He fought the bull...and they fought once more

When they found the matador and saw him dying
He'd never see tomorrow
Now they say that on the spot where he was lying
Still walks the proud El Toro

The bull El Toro, brought him defeat and pain
And to his sorrow, the matador knew shame

Amigos de Gines,"Ayer baje de la sierra 
Ya me estaban esperando 
Eran 100 hombres de verde 
Tenían el paso bloqueado 
Pero se llevaron plancha 
Yo venia por otro lado 

Al barrio de tierra blanca 
Muy cerquita del infierno 
Voy a ver a mi borrada 
A escondidas del gobierno 
Son 2 pendientes que tengo 
Que ahí noches que yo no duermo 

No se apunten zopilotes 
Que todavia no me he muerto 
Por que me puse perjumenes 
Ustedes piensan que apesto 
Si deberás me traen ganas 
Nomas arriesguen su resto 

Me gusta pescar charales 
Para echarlos de carnada 
En la ciudad de Nogales 
Me tiraron por la espalda 
Si me quieren rematar 
Los espero en Ensenadaa 

No es que me guste la bronca 
Pero aprecio la emocion 
Que me toquen con la banda 
Esa pieza del barzón 
Después voy para las quintas 
Me lo pide el corazon

Amigos de Gines,"Dicen que venían del sur
En un carro colorado
Traían cien kilos de coca
Iban con rumbo a Chicago

Así lo dijo el soplón
Que los había denunciado
Ya habían pasado la aduana
La que está en El Paso, Texas

Pero en mero San Antonio
Lo estaban esperando
Eran los rinches de Texas
Que comandan el condado

Una sirena lloraba
Un emigrante gritaba
Que detuvieran el carro

Para que lo registraran
Y que no se resistieran
Porque si no los mataban
Surge un M-16

Cuando iba rugiendo el aire
El faro de una patrulla
Se vio volar por el aire
Así empezó aquel combate

Donde fue aquella masacre
Decía Lino Quintana
Esto tenía que pasar
Mis compañeros han muerto

Ya no podrán declarar
Y yo lo siento sheriff
Porque yo no se cantar
De los siete que murieron
Solo las cruces quedaron

Cuatro eran del carro rojo
Los otros tres del gobierno
Por ellos no se preocupen
Irán con Lino al infierno

Dicen que eran del Cantil
Otros que eran del Altar
Hasta por ahí dicen muchos
Que procedían del Parral
La verdad nunca se supo
Nadie los fue a declarar

Pick up the pace quick, why worry about a replacement?
When I stepped in came wit' my feet in the pavement
Leave niggas in amazement

Amil,"[Chorus]
If you a playa, get it now like a playa
Get it down like a playa, spit a round like a playa
If you a playa, roll an ounce like a playa
Get an ounce like a playa, bounce like a playa
If you a playa, get it now like a playa
Get it down like a playa, spit a round like a playa
If you a playa, get an ounce playa, bounce, playa
Bounce, bounce, bounce

When I step in the club, bitches know my name
I don't do a lotta talkin' bitches know my game
Don't gotta buy a lotta drinks bitches know my aim
Y'all get them whores drunk just to get some brain
When the Roc in the place, they go berserk
We make em bounce till they motherfuckin' shoulders hurt
Bitches lift up skirts, take off shirts
Fine babysitters take off work
Lose they jobs, panties, shoes and bras
Niggas mad at us 'cause they lose they wives
I don't step up in the club without a weapon in the club
'Cause niggas get drunk and kick crap up in the club
That's why my tool be cocked, niggas mad 'cause my shoes be blocked
And my jewels be rocked
If you a playa, you wouldn't be in my pocket
If you a playa, you like it, you see it, you cop it

[Chorus]

If you a playa, you got the three basic niggas
Your trick your lick and your dick niggas
The object never fall in love wit 'em
Run to the malls and the clubs for them
If you a playa, then you choose 'em like a playa
Use 'em like a playa,then you lose 'em like a playa
I bet I'll still be they favorite bitch
Some bought me ice, some paid for whips
C'mon you know the rules in this playa shit
Ain't no such thing as a relationship
If you a playa, get it now like a playa, get it down like a playa
Spit a round like a playa
If you a playa, roll an ounce like a playa, get an ounce like a
Playa, bounce like a playa
If you a playa, bounce, bounce like a playa nigga, bounce, bounce

[Chorus]

Jiggaman ya heard?
If you a playa, will you pull up to the curb
Niggas chicks fly the coup when you pull up to them birds
Why the fuck would you bring her
When the rocks on that man got his whole hand lookin' like E-T's finger
If you a playa, keep your cars with the year (year)
Your watch game tight (tight) your hustle over there (uh-huh)
Your house outta sight, your enemies close
And your family tight and never try to make a ho your housewife

This one for the future
Everybody want to be a Roc-a-fella gangsta
Hard for the street, sicka for the club
Sometimes for the ladies, but this one for my thugs

Hey yo, niggas want to drive by the hood and dump
Come on stupid, I clap up from your hood to the trunk
Foot on the floor, back on the wall, good with the pump
Blast through your stomach, stupid, you can look through your lunch

Is this what you want? Niggas that's clappin that priest
Runnin the streets, lawless, blastin police
Stickin Furby's out the window, snatchin your niece
And nah, we don't just rap we clap you past the seats

Me with the twin eagle, B. Sigel and Bleek
And I got the whole city ready to throw toast wit' me
I'm loved, niggas want to throw slugs with Jigga
All they, need is a reason to show love for Jigga

Niggas want to go back to back, till both of our gats clack
Till we reload in three seconds flat, I'm back
Niggas ain't met ya hat till we entered through ya shoulder
And we exit out ya back, gangsta nigga

Bleek not frontin now

We suit up for war with no button down
We clip up and zip up, hit your wip up
Put 4 in your cage, the other 4 in your face
And you don't want that

I catch a nigga, who ain't pump at
Send 'em to one of my custy's and bring a lung back
Me, Bean, Jay, shit you can't front that
Weed, coke, dope, Bleek nigga pump that

Stay in the game for my beef, I tote up 
Sit blow in the seat, my weed I roll up
Smoke one to the head, come between my stomach and leg
Yeah I'm the thuggin the street 

You don't want nothing with Bleek
Its Roc-A, Fella for life, you know that shit
Get your guns, get your ones, nigga throw that shit

Yo I live for the sheets, I die for the sheets
And I got spit for beets, like I ride for my peeps

Yo I love this glamour shit, but bitch I been gutter
Before can I get it and double excel covers
I thought I heard somebody say they want some hardcore
I like everything from my dick to my bras raw

Now, is my street niggas no into this
Now, is my street bitches not into this
Wild loud like my thugs do up in the tunnel
You know the rock ??? itchy finger the tussle

This territory locked, no more room in this hustle
Check the sound scan we getting platinum plaques and bundles
Verses I lye them down, they never die down
If the crowd rile down then fire another round

Voice so ill you'll want to speak my shit
Joints so hot you'll want to leak my shit 
Plus haters sneak peak my shit 
But still I be the only one to freak this shit

[Chorus]
Ya'll dead wrong
If you think you can be fuckin' with this 
And you'll know
That ya'll got nothing on this
Ya'll want that or you want something like this
Those who hate
Yeah ya'll just fronting on this

Why chicks don't want to rap on the same song as me
You need a verse ma it's on me 
See all this publishing belong to me 
Just imagine how the secong album gonna be 
Non-stop party hopping 
Roc roc rocs and keep on rocking
Everything I spit be popping
Anything Amilliyon want she copping
Whoop whoop ain't nothing change
And I play more ballers then them rucker games
Light gray studs, ring, watch, plus the chain
Will I ever be broke what's my name?
Have you ever seen a chick like this?
Ever heard one spit like this
I dead'em all put my word on that
All money is legal and I murder tracks

[Chorus]

Cute as a button
Can't tell this bitch nothin
Ghetto fab whole chick bubbling
Diana Ross the boss of the rock 
Shit you know me I got to floss at the spot
With a dime as nigga who be tossing knots
Every bitch hating 'cause I'm scalding hot
It can't be because I got begets on
Cause niggas love this bitch even with sweats on
I'm the A-m-i-l-liyon
Strictly be on that shit major coins be on
I got joints making competition want to drop dead
I got joints making you bop your head 
I got joints that will have your eyes blood shot red
Fuck the doe I want my props instead 
Stay real with it
Might pack steel with it 
You can hate but you still gotta deal with it

Straight from da borough of dem B.K. niggas

Where we rob for the fun of it, hustle for the drug of it
Rap money in rubber-bands, just for the love of it
Straight from my ghetto, we listen to heavy metal like
Desert eagles, street sweepers, loud metal

It's hit an run now, motherfuck anyone of you

Pop up with the gun in ya
Release one for zero-zero M Bleek R O C dot com

Still throwin' crack at it
Still fuckin' with them crack-atics
Still bust 'em with them black matics

It's ain't the bucks, it's the rush
You tryin' to get my ass at it
They say I think ass backwards
Fuck how I act, as long as I stack, it's all mathematics

Our tracks nice, hug the block ta tract dice
Late night, club night, mac attract dikes

Two guns, you know mac pack gat twice

Gets that crack back wit that ice
No joke wit the coke, I wips that right
No doubt, never droubt, gets that price

Hold Franklin's like a Aretha now
In the SL two seater now
And I'm in nuthin' but diamonds

I'm the illest female that you heard thus far
Five-five with the thirty-four B-cup bra
I fuck wit dem cats who ain't up to par
I get niggas for cash, clothes, jeweleries, plus cars

I'm talkin' rent money, I'm talkin' bank money
I'm talkin' Martha Keats step of with the rent money
Movin' on up, two in the sauna
Still ride through the block, pull up on the corna, plus

Give me an inch so I can take a mile

Yo, y'all niggas truly ain't ready for this dynasty thing
Y'all thinkin' Blake Carrington, I'm thinkin' more like ""ming
I got four nephews, and they all right in
They all young and wild, plus they all like things

And I'm havin' a child, which is more frighting
But y'all about to witness is big business kid
Big bosses, cocky, and big benzsesses
Come through flossin'em shiny rims it is

An office don't pop up in their sentences
I think you understand what type of event this is
I don't think you know I focus young Memphis is
Or I see was so real, when you add on Amil

This is much more than rap, it's black entrepreneur
Clothin', movie, and films, we come to conquer it all

You could bullshit wit rap if you want, muthafuckers
When it's all said and done, we gon' see what's what

Amil,"[Verse 1]
Call this bitch yor nigga when time is rough
I lost a lot when you fell, life is hard to bluff
You think its hell where you at 
Shit its hell on the streets
You maintaining in the Bing, I'm surviving to eat
Don't think am wilding, flexing whips and stuff
Thinking I'm lost laying down
Sex for trips and stuff
I'll admit it I'm use to the finer things,
We had major names even on the minor things
Everywhere we went, mad bitches sizing me up
You know they tight now, shit I get to drive the trucks
But I wish you were spreading it riding it rough
I think I miss that more then you buying me stuff
Since you got knocked your man tried to hollar at me
And those nigga's you stuck, they throwing dollars at me
But you know this gaming, and I'm just keeping it real
Holding you down until you back on the field

[Chorus 2x]
Feels like I do
I feel when feeling down
In the ground feeling down
It can be most anyday

[Verse 2]
Don't worry 'bout these streets I'm conrolling these grounds
I might slip and miss a V-I but I'm holding it down
Got the kids to take care its hard out here
And its tearing my heart to play my part out here
I seen that snitch and you know I got plots 4 years
And your bid make me feel like I got the chair
But ain't nobody tapping this I rather tap my own
Watching tapes we made while I'm resting alone
Wishing you home, pictures of you flipping the chrome
What kind of chic will leave her man when he out the zone
Me without you is like a stickman without a silencer
Got me X-ing off days on the calendar
I miss loading the glock so you could control the block
I miss watching you work the dogs to tighten the lock
Think of the time boo pushing it like a 6 double o
You get your weight up I'm a drain you once they let go

Chorus

[Verse 3]
I can see us back on the bricks, me on your shoulder
Letting bitches know they wishes to have you are over
So you ring your broads while you locked away
I know its hard for a nigga on top not to play
See Amil's the one you kept draped in ice
I'm the one waiting silk down caked in spice
Waiting for your calls or my box to vibrate
Hoping you want me to come scoop you not being more weight
I fell from Gucci sandals back to no name brands
From a six and a mansion to beating the sands
Staying true make ends meet to have enough for the love I take
All-savage and stuff
Have a brick where most F.E.D.S. dare to touch
Fear none to see the cash, and us popping the clutch
Chopping a Dutch-flip cop twice as much living low key
A minute then heist and stuff
If I have to wait while you gone I'm a take what comes
If you don't see cash, know its hard in the slums
Cause I ran through the stash and it ain't no funds",Anyday,2000

Didn't think you wanted to do me
Started taking me to dinner and the movies
Had me open off the minks and jewelry
Buying me things that you know I wanted
Begging me for loving and you know I fronted
Now we doing more then getting blunted
And we both know we shouldn't of done it
Because wifey  at home and that's a no, no

She could cook dinner and mop the floors
Just keep giving me a lot of doe
And give me some loving before you gotta go
Once you get home your girl be beefin'
Wondering where you was this weekend
Her cousin told her that she seen us creepin'
I guess by now she know you cheatin'
She must of found my number cause she calling me
Couldn't talk cause her man was all in me
Told her call me back at a quarter to three
Now that's the way real players ought to be
Shall I tell her bout the S he ordered me
So hy you fuckin' with him?
Cause he can afford me

It was the money that made me get with you
But right now I'm trying to get rid of you
Cause you always at my house like I live with you
want to lock me down like I got kids with you
See I knew from the gate that you was taken
If I told you that I loved you, I was only faken
Shit it ain't like that I want to keep you
But I'll beep you when I need you
Now who getting played better you than me
Cause I know you could never be true to me
If you did it to her you could do it to me
Start slippin' and you might be losing me

Acting like my peeps, but I know that's how you tricked me
Love to see me get high, love to see my tipsy
Heard you even wanna stick a little chip in me
You been trying to play me close ever since my shine
Wanna take me to dinner, feed me shrimp and swine
You said, ""Amil I want you to meet a good friend of mine
His name is Money and we partners till the end of time""
Introduced me to your clique, hate, envy, lust and greed
Said you want the whole world in ya custody
And if I give you my soul you'll give me luxuries
Said you could hit me up wit power, it's just up to me
I turn you on when I'm in short skirts and tight jeans
You want my kids to write Santa and celebrate Halloween
Told me sell my people crack and get rich off fens
You love the number six but hate the number thirteen

We'll have some quarrels
Some disappointments
And a whole lot of problems
And you will except me

You wanna, be the one to pick me up when I fall
Told me hang Casear bojease on my living room wall
It was always something bout you that made my skin crawl
You turned me into a player and showed me how to ball
You give me rewards when I rob and steal
Want me to abort my babies and get on the pill
You put burners in the hood so each other we kill
I see your eye watching me on the dollar bills
When I got the scoop on you, it just made you mad
Cause I moved out your crib, packed all my bags
Them days I turned to you was the days you laughed
You used to smile every time I pledge allegiance to the flag
We speak now and then but we ain't smacking hands
You be up in the clubs asking me for a dance
Still trying to convince me to go cheat on my man
Begging me to please give you just one more chance

We'll have some quarrels
Some disappointments
And a whole lot of problems
And you will except me

When we was kids you was the one who taught me how to lie
Said I could always use you as my alibi
And you kept me from knowledge, wisdom, and the most high
Had me believe God had blonde hair and blue eyes
Our relationship went sour since I found the truth
You know you can't have me so you fuck with my youth
You got all my phones tapped, I gotta talk at booths
I learned an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
You built Sodom and Gomorra for us all to live in
When we was cool you used to tell me all your visions
Like how you gonna rule the nations under one religion
You got this New World order, it's like a big prison
You said you wanna be worshipped from noon to noon
Nothings gonna get better is what we all assumed
Cause nights is getting shorter and it's snowing in June
I see you working overtime cause you out of here soon

We'll have some quarrels
Some disappointments
And a whole lot of problems
And you will except me

We'll have some quarrels
Some disappointments
And a whole lot of problems
And you will except me

Amil,"My life
Is in the arms of the man upstairs
Through trials and tribulations
He'll always be there
You see I know he loves me
And I know he cares
And he'll bever put more on me
Than I can bear

[Verse 1]
Is it a blessing to live or a blessing to die?
Let me finish out this hell with no questions why
I should be happy I'm on and dressing fly
But is the game changing me for the extra pie
If you could look into the life I live
Three sixty catching up to all the trife I did
Got my people up north trying to slice the bid
While I'm in love with a nigga with a wife and kid
Maybe if my pops ain't abandon me
I wouldn't let so many niggas take advantage of me
Using me some even put their hands on me
I wonder what the most high got planned for me
My life line getting shorter when I look in my palms
Swore I'll be nothing like my biological mom
She ain't raise me so naturally I never felt a bond
At 16 got my GED never saw a prom

[Chorus]
I been weak and I been strong
I been through the fire, I been through the storm
Try to do right and I know I do wrong
Just be happy for me when my life is gone
Cause no more hurt and no more tears
There'll be no more pain and no more fears
No more people in my face that's not sincere
So smile 4 me when I'm no longer here

[Verse 2]
At a young age I let the world turn me out
Pellets and purple haze been burnt me out
A hard knock life is all I learned about
Trying to eat the only thing I be concerned about
Telling my youth everything happens for a reason
Let him know ain't that his father wanted to leave him
If it wasn't for the streets he'd still be breathing
Trying to raise him myself but I know he need him
Me and my seed used to live off mostly welfare
Only two checks a month for us both to share
I remember making sure that the coast was clear
So I could boost us some muthafucking clothes to wear
Had to hustle 'cause them food stamps just wasn't enough
Upstate back to Broadway gott to go re-up
All this fast cash only turned the heat up
Can't afford to get knocked but who gonna feed us

Chorus

[Verse 3]
Can't shake these thoughts of suicide
Anyone I ever loved or was close to died
Ones I trusted or thought was being true lied
A lifetime of tears but only a few I cried
Try to take my past stick it up on a shelf
But my actions stem from all the pain I felt
I'm just trying to make the best out the hand I dealt
If I fall who can I turn to for help
Hope my man with me or with my health
Will he be there through good and bad sickness and health?
Does he want the real me or somebody else?

Call me on the telephone

Whether, 2-1-2, or 7-1-8
Or 9-1-4, I love it hardcore
When it's over the phone, it's safe to do it raw
Imaginary worlds we could both explore
(Hello) Baby what you wearing right now?
(Hot pants) My girl ain't around, let's get down
And I hope the phone's tapped, let's pretend you on my lap
(I'm bouncing up and down with my shoulders back)
(Nigga you like that?) You see I'm running up my bill
Momma might hear me, but you just too ill
I got your flicks lined up, stereo low
Cherry flavored grease beneath my elbow
If I was there what would you do? (I'd lay you on your back)
(Ride or die daddy, and I love it like that)

[Chorus]

You the freak of my dreams, the reason that I keep on baggy jeans
(Oh, I love me a nigga from killer Queens)
(I'ma rub up on your muscles, ride 'til I'm sweating it)
(I bet you I can make you cum first) Throw the bets in
I'm a nasty nigga, made to order
Kiss below the border with a warm glass of water
Is you wit me? (Yeah) Tell me how it taste
I promise I'll keep the telephone right in my face
How it feel? (Feels good) Where you at? (In the hood)
(Talking on the phone like a good girl should)
(To my nig', baby I'ma reach my peak)
Strawberry shortcake, good enough to eat
(And I taste mad sweet) We big freaks
Blasting off on the phone seven days a week

[Chorus]

I throw sugar in the water so the ice tastes sweet
To make sure your ex-man can't compete
Shower curtain on the bed, warm baby oil
G-string sitting like a snake in a coil
(Hold on, I think somebody on the other line)
Interrupt this nut I'ma bust, you out your mind
Lay back, imagine us chest to chest
Tongue-kissing deep while we spark a sess
(Everything is crazy, L do it the best)
Riding rough baby, put my pipe to the test

I want to make you moan until it's a dial tone
However you want it baby, I'm raw to the bone

Ay yo I got a resolution
This year I'm playing right
No six fifteen this year
You can stay the night
We can go bowling it ain't like before
Can't y'all see that I'm growing?
I was so immature
I was young and having money
Having honeys come to the crib
Thinkin' they shit and they couldn't get cab money from me
Some bad chicks didn't get pass the bridge
I went to One Trump Plaza on their asses'
No room service just snacks and shit
Work with those Lil' Debbies and when your done get ready
The chicks I was fiendin' to smash
Let 'em lean on the cash
Will take 'em on long trips
Break 'em with long dick
There was no such thing as strong relationships
But I'm off that playa shit
I need a chick that practice top cheese
That still can by weed
And can give me some good head
And I'll make her remind me, uh-huh

Them chrome wheels spinning on them new rims
Home suspended from school again
I'm grown, still ill ladies love to be a deal, like Bleek
Can I feel up on your wood and grill?
It's a hood thing, wood grain, off the chain
She give me good brain
Love the way I push my slang
Callin' my jack soon as the hop in my V
They catching contact, weed smoke all up in the weave
Bet'cha man can't do it like this, like this
I bet his wrists ain't bluish like this, like this
And I'm from Marcy you catch me on anybody's block

I was the worse
I used to switch chicks every day
Had niggas mad for real like ""I wish he was gay""
Cause they knew sooner or later hun was gettin' with Jay
Just a matter of time she was gettin' with Jay
I'll have your chick in the summer tropics sippin' on 'zae
Spittin' up in the Pacifics smoking spliffs in the shade
She used to love ya, but she feeling different today
You used to smother her, look at your honey slippin' away
Consorting with hustlers, niggas that be giving her space
She said she feel free when she's around me
I'm letting her do her and in turn she's doing me
She on the phone with her friends like how cool is she

She brought the Yukon 2000 black
Through a screen and a DVD
Twenites on the truck that'll piss you off
In return I sent her on a tour thru Sacks
With tengrand shoping spree to get back
I brought her a five that look nice when she drive

Militants niggas see less, chrome spinnin'
Got a lust for them grown women
Classy skirt, work-type chicks that own linen and
Hate sneakers, only accept cellies, won't chase beepers
Understand space when needed they relate deeper
Respect hustle, pretty wit' they lewie duffle
Via Spigga wit' the stacks over they Huey Russle
I style wit' 'em, smile, sit 'em down, child wit' 'em
Lay it down if it's love then I'm outa town wit' 'em
Show 'em some new shit, then give 'em some new dick
Help 'em really confront on who they fucking wit'
Feel a nigga? I'm made for this, remain flawless
I'm like the same song never change chorus
It's real, from the hood, but fortune and still
Lost in the hills, niggas soft in the grill

Eight wonder, poker face, aces under
Embrace the mink weather but relate to summer
New wardrobe, chicks wit' they waistes younger
Big coupes kitted up, you can taste the hunger
Hang wit' me, watch how the ladies exchange wit' me
Leavin' the club laughing like them came wit' me
Cop heavy, feel rhythmatic I rock steady
Regardless of the pussy you can have it I'm not petty
It's plain, never meant for the heart but the brain
Depart from the pain, that's the art of the game
Forgive if I ever did, involve your wiz'
That's no reason for niggas, not to father they kids
I'm don, New Guinea born, city calm, with the Russian varn
Looking pretty, all fitted strong, could see it's me

Beyond live, we leave all that stuntin' to you
Did the swish shit, and all the mistress
Niggas wives wit' they wrist slit
And still a nigga never did kiss
I'm cold, cris bottles, six bottles
Spit it like and Iceburg novel and chicks follow
Finesse, I move off the love of the sex
And if it's over you can bet my hands is huggin her neck
All the respect never one to try and spoil her rep
But if she stress gotta play the chick more to the left

Que con tu mirada le robas
A cualquier distraido su atencion
Y esa mirada penetrante
Que hace juego con tu mirada
Hace que un hombre pierda la razon
Y ese cuerpo tan prohibido quiero dibujarlo
Para tenerlo conmigo si es noble y sagrado
Quiero ser un pintor como leonardo y con pincel en mano
Y hacer de ti otra monalisa
Y decir que tienes la misma mirada

Ayudenme para enamorarla
No quiere aceptarme ramos de flores
Y yo solo quiero dibujarla
No se tranza como deja morir a un hombre

Ella dice que yo no meresco
Ser el hombre de toda su vida
Porque se turba cuando me mira
Es que acaso ella me tiene miedo

Ayudenme para enamorarla
No quiere aceptarme ramos de flores
Y yo solo quiero dibujarla
No se tranza como deja morir a un hombre

Ay me cuentan que vive orgullosa
De que yo sea su enamorado
Y por dios que no entiendo a esa mujer
Me esquiva si yo voy pasando
Discimula si le estoy hablando
Para no despertar su interes
Pero yo le puse una trampa y dije que marchaba
Muy lejos a dos
Vuelve a molestarla
No pudo contener el llanto
Y vi en su mirada un adios a mi vida
Y pudo notar que me amas muchacha

Porque soñar un amor que no existe en ti 
Porque fijar la esperanza en algo que ya ha muerto 
Si al final de la ilusión no hay un día que no sea gris 

Sembre semillas de amor en culmanes de niño 
La cuide con ilusion rodeandola de cariño 
Y alguien sembró una pasión que acabo lo bonito 
Pero recogí dolor porque nací en un espino 

Quise cultivar un amor y me he quedado solo 
Creo que sembré tierra mala o no supe sembrar 
Pues creo que sembré bien dios me lo enseño todo 
Entonces eres tierra mala porque no nació en ti 
El amor que yo soñé nunca floreció, en ti 
El amor que yo soñé nunca floreció 
En ti el amor y muy solo me quede 

Porque tenias que fingir un amor que no sentías 
No tenias necesidad aparentar que me amabas 
Si me hubieras explicado te hubiera entendido 
Pero mas duro me dio al saber que te casabas 
Nunca pensé que tuvieras un corazón de piedra 
Donde la semilla nace pero no echa raíces 
Crece solo de apariencia y luego se marchita 
Por eso no resulto haber sembrado en tu vida, si si

Quise cultivar un amor y me he quedado solo 
Creo que sembré tierra mala o no supe sembrar 
Pero creo que sembré bien dios me lo enseño todo

But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man

And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he

He isn't good, he isn't true

But I don't care

I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot

I would do things that I would regret (trying to get you to)
To understand how I felt for you
I tried real hard time and time again but I

But I, stayed around thinking you would learn to love

And we both know you're wrong
There's nothing you can do, to ever undo what you've done to me
I loved you, deep in my heart I know you couldn't love me
But baby I just kept holding on, I should of let you go

I should of known, damn I should of known
This wouldn't last long, when you didn't come home some nights
And now I'm on, in the zone, handle business on my own
So respect the queen on the throne, alright
Here's some strong advice, move on, that's life

I’m back where I started
I’m prisoner of my own success
But hardly caring enough to know that I’m dead without it

No bright lights, no bitches, no big stage
But f-ck it I’m in a better place
And I’m talking in third person in case you couldn’t relate

No difference from Kidz Bop, book 'em in the Hilton

Got a bad lil' mama, and she always with the shits
Put a hundred in my pocket, then a hundred on the rims
That's my lil' bitch, that's- that's my lil' bitch
That's my lil' bitch, that's- that's my lil' bitch
Put a red dress on her and some gas for the trip
Got a hundred in my pocket and a couple on the tint
That's my lil' bitch, that's- that's my lil' bitch

Amine,"Hé ouais ça y est, je me suis mouillé
T'entends les cris de guerre arriver
Hé woi Je suis grillé ! Hé woi ! Je veux me marier!
Hé woi Enfin fonder une famille, koi !
Yahla ! C'est le grand jour, ya la arrosa
Au levée, je suis tressé mais toujours en pyjama.
Ma mère est toute existée à l'idée de marier son petit dernier.
Ce qu'elle sait pas c'est que j'ai passé la nuit à angoisser.
Elle me répète qu'il est midi et qu'hier j'étais de sortie
Et que c'est vraiment pas sérieux pour un bon futur mari.
Je sais mais il est temps de me laver, de me raser en deux temps
De m'habiller! Hop la! En trois mouvements me voilà face à mes beaux-parents
Ma mère équipée, sucre, couronne l'événement
Et c'est qu'une fois dans le salon que beau papa me saoule de ses questions
Gouli wachta te hendem dans la vie ? Bah! je suis rappeur
Toi t'es rappeur ? Non, non je travaille à la mairie !
Après avoir dealé ma dulcinée, crachée la dote pour me marier
Ma carte bleue devenue verte y a plus qu'à remballer.
On se tient à ce qu'on a dit rendez-vous dans un mois à la mairie.
REFRAIN AMINE (en arabe - traduit en français)
Tous ça c'est que du cinéma
Ça nous a ramené que des soucis
Pourtant les gens sont heureux pour nous
Laisser moi me marier avec elle
Tous ça c'est que du cinéma
Ça nous a ramené que des soucis
Pourtant les gens sont heureux pour nous
Normal la bouffe est prête

Sur le coup j'en reviens pas Merlich faut qu'on décolle
Monter dans la FIAT Panda, arrivée derrière la salle c'est le saloon
Coffre ouvert tu bois quoi Rhô ? Ricard ! Bienvenu chez Mimoun
A l'intérieur les darones courent après les mômes,
C'est dur pour elle avec tout l'or qu'elles ont sur les épaules
Appelle ça Brinks, convoi de fonds ou même banque de France
Et c'est serbi la banque Charbi sur la piste de danse
Et les darons parlent de bénéfices 21 euros 10 dirhams 90,
Quant aux cadeaux qui font 3 mètres de hauts
A l'intérieur une fourchette et un couteau
Ridicule mon poto, sinon j'aperçois Zoubida
Pour qui j'ai le coeur qui bat la prochaine fois lnch'Allah
Le mariage ça sera elle ou moi.

Normal la bouffe est prête


En une heure tout est réglé, me voilà déjà devant la salle
Avec un verre de lait, une datte je vous remercie j'avais la dalle
Avec ma princesse au bras on est prêt à affronter tout ce monde
Je vois que la famille est au complet mes beaux-parents qui tapent une ronde
Il paraît qu'aujourd'hui je passe un cap et que j'ai grandi
Mais dans les yeux de ma mère hier j'avais encore 7 ans et demi
A peine arrivés depuis 10 minutes on embarque déjà ma femme
Il faut qu'elle se change 7 fois mon fils aujourd'hui ça devient une dame
Reloue la vieille et là je me retrouve tout seul je sais pas où me mettre
Tout le monde me scrute, je sais pas ce qu'il y a quoi j'ai une tache sur ma veste
Ma femme déboule au galop putain la première danse
Je lâche un sourire décontracté mais tout le monde sait que je suis en transe
Je réfléchis deux minutes et me dis qu'il ne faut pas faire de gâchis
Alors je sors mon pas funky même sur du CHEB MAMI
Tout le monde est heureux pour nous et moi je le suis encore plus
Ce soir c'est mon jour, ma nuit, ma sensation montagne russe.

Grâce à ta présence mon cœur n’est plus noir

Pour un tête à tête ou je t’ai rencontré
Toujours en retard tu t’ fais belle pour moi
Et comme d’habitude j’ t'attend en bas

Arrivés on s’installe je commande pour toi
J’te connais par coeur j’ prend la même chose pour moi
Tu me sens nerveux tu m’ demandes ce qu’il y a

C’est tellement difficile ta réponse m’effraye

Des rumeurs, des messages
Tu n'sait plus, tu n'sait pas
Baby, Baby tu paraissait si sùr de toi

Seul à seul parle moi
Dans les yeux regarde moi
Tes humeurs, tes émois
Baby, j'ai peur tu me fais douter de toi

Soit franche, dit le moi
Si tu pense que le temps est venu d'une pau-ause

Ne soit pas fausse, ne me ment pas
Ce que j'envisageais, tu n'en voulu pas
Ne soit pas fausse, je n'le suis pas
Les yeux dans les yeux, non ne dévie pas
Mais à qui la faute si on n'en est là?
La dignité d'un homme ne se monnaie pas
Mais à qui la faute si on est là?
Si tu veut partir, je te retient pas, te retient pas

Seul à seul, à quoi tu penses?
Mes inquiétudes et ton silence
Entre nous, un vide immense
Baby, Baby, tu ne nous laisse aucune chance

Seul à seul, je l'ai voulu
Seul à seul, tu m'a déçu
Seul à seul, je ne veut plus
Je sens, qu'au fond,
De ton coeur tout est perdu

Amine,"Je sens que mon absence
Te rend différente
J’ai le sentiment
Que c’est un mauvais présage
Je rentre le soir
Plus un regard
De tes grands soupirs
J’ai bien compris le message

Toutes ces années
J'ai tout donné
J'ai bossé dur pour ton bonheur sans hésiter
J'ai tout misé
Sans me soucier
De notre amour pourtant si pur mais en danger

Refrain
T’as longtemps hésité
Je n’ai jamais su pourquoi
Tout fait pour m'éviter
Je n’ai jamais su pourquoi
T'as même pas essayé
Je n’ai jamais su pourquoi
J'n'ai jamais voulu ça
Je n’ai jamais su pourquoi

Je t'ai toujours aimée
Tu n’m’as pas laissé le choix
Regarde où on en est
Tu n’m’as pas laissé le choix
Ce qui est fait est fait
Tu n’m’as pas laissé le choix
J'n'ai jamais voulu ça mais
Tu n’m’as pas laissé le choix

Ce soir j'vais tout préparer
Lui montrer qu'je l'aime
Qu'entre nous rien n'a changé
Les heures qui défilent
Et pas un coup d'fil
J'appelle même ses copines
Mais personne sait où elle est

J'pars la chercher
Dans le quartier
En espérant qu'il ne lui est rien arrivé
Et là j'la vois
Juste devant moi
Avec un autre, plus d'doute je n'y crois pas

Tout ce temps à t'aimer
Sans jamais douter
Je te vire de ma vie
Et tout s'arrête ici
Stoppe tes larmes et tes remords
Entre toi et moi c'est mort

C'est pas c'que tu crois
Alors c'est quoi
Ne me laisse pas
Vas-y lâche-moi
Tu te sépares de moi
J't'ai dit lâche-moi

The 8 Bus run the same, dogs howls when the train
Comes like me ex girl and next girl
Used to rock the S curl
Wanted me a Nextel but my momma copped a Razr
That's why I couldn't blame her
Flipping through my past like I used to flip the phone
They kicking out the blacks and all the houses getting clones
Friends used to do pills and only eat at Du's Grill
The food was pretty good but the times was better
These are the only days I missed
Like the first shawty I kissed
I used to have dreams now I dream

I look around and I see nothing in my neighborhood
Not satisfied don't think I'll ever wanna stay for good
Packed up my bags, told mom and dad I've gotta go, go
And once I do they'll finally see the inner me

Everybody wanna be a star, everybody want a nice car
Everybody wanna live great, have a good damn time, never trip with the law
The popo up in PO, dirtier than VO
Bullets from the past act like I'm they fucking hero
Living in LA for the weather, I FaceTime mom when I miss her
I got some homies that'll never leave my home
Well I pull up to the corner, it smell like Miley Cyrus
I told em' I don't smoke, they say ""boy, you fucking wildin'""
Innocent and young, reckless and we dumb

Mentality the same from my folks
Momma wanna see me happy, she don't wanna see me broke
I said ""red wine, Sauvignon, Rastafar', Babylon""
Our youth will never die if I live it like a prize (hey!)
Who knows who I am, who knows who I are
Most people pretty sketch like a night at Echo Park
That's why I just keep it cool but my time is in a leisure
Every time I'm home I catch emotion like a seizure

I slip and slide through the tides of my youth
What's the age? Too young to worry, too old to dream
What's the age? Imagination to me, tragedy to some
What's the age? I guess we find out when we're older. Touché

Back when putting on a condom had me really scary

Is better than learning from someone who doesn't

Love is what I cherished and Miss Parrish
Flew all the way to Paris and we made out on my terrace
I kept it on the low low, 'cause I was in love
And the shade I had in my room was already enough
I'm going on some dates and I'm making some plans
But it's hard to find some love if the girl is a fan
And after we fuck, she want a picture with me
She got me feeling like Paper Boi, but I cry when she leaves

I'm on your magical mystery ride

Nos cœurs qui s’érodent
C’est le temps qui les entailles, entailles, entailles

Plus rien ne m’agite
Une étincelle, ou je m’éteins sans toi
Plus rien ne m’agite
Si ta peau hésite
Prends moi la flamme et je brûle avec toi
Si ta peau hésite

And I know
Your fire took away my pride
And it's burning down inside

And I know
That only you can turn the tide
Lift me up and make me glide

Viens le temps des anges
Qui nous ramène en arrière

On goûte aux mensonges
La vérité est amère, amère, amère

Juste à la limite
Entre la queue et les envies d’encore
Juste à la limite

Si ta peau me quitte
Que reste t’il pour faire chanter mon corps
Si ta peau me quitte

And I know
Your fire took away my pride
And it's burning down inside

And I know
That only you can turn the tide
Lift me up and make me glide

And I know

Pour aller chercher ce destin qui me ressemble

J’ai beau parcourir le monde
Tous mes chemins mènent à toi 
Il y a mille étoiles mais au dessus un seul ciel

J’ai beau parcourir le monde
Mais mon seul pays c’est toi
Même loin de tes yeux je serai toujours fidèle

Je reviendrai comme on plonge
Enfin dans le bain de la vie
Je te vois même dans mes songes 
Comme le jour cherche la nuit
Je trouverai enfin tes bras

Je suis allé si loin pour trouver la liberté
Là ou ne vivent que le chagrin et le silence
Sans peur du lendemain j’ai reçu comme j’ai donné
J’ai perdu souvent j’ai retenté ma chance

J’ai beau parcourir le monde
Je ne vois qu’un seul visage

Il y a mille étoiles et pourtant je ne vois qu’elle

J’ai beau parcourir le monde
Elle est mon seul paysage
Une voix qui s’élève et vient chanter l’essentiel

Je reviendrai comme on plonge 
Enfin dans le bain de la vie 
Je te vois même dans mes songes 
Comme le jour cherche la nuit 
Je trouverai enfin tes bras 

Je prendrais tous les tournants, tous les tourments 
Pour te revenir 
Et sans attendre mon tour, je prendrai tous les détours 
Puisqu’il y a l’amour à bâtir

Denn nur ein Traum sorgt dafür, dass meine Hoffnung wächst
Besitze weder Geld noch Gold, nur einen schlechten Ruf
Doch du verteidigst deinen Jungen bis aufs letzte Blut
Allaha şükür, denn diese sehr kranke Zeit
Ist dank dir und deinem Lächeln plötzlich Vergangenheit, ah
Du hast gesagt schreib's dir hinter die Ohren
Wer mich betrügt, hat mich für immer verloren!
Das ist nicht neu für mich, Azizam, ich weiß, dass
Loyalität selten ist und ihren Preis hat
Nur die Geschichte eines Jungen aus der Vorstadt
Stark wie ein Löwe, doch bei dir wurd' ich sofort schwach
Komm nicht her, du gehst unter hier in meinem Sumpf
Das Leben zeichnet dich, doch wir sind keine Kunst

Nur du und ich, nur wir zwei
Haben nicht viel, doch sind unendlich reich
Brauchen uns so wie Bonnie und Clyde
Wie Bonnie und Clyde, für die Ewigkeit
Nur du und ich, nur wir zwei
Gegen den Rest dieser Welt allein
Ein Königreich für die Unendlichkeit
Wie Bonnie und Clyde, wie Bonnie und Clyde
Wie Bonnie und Clyde, Baby

Ah
Nur wir zwei gegen den Rest der Welt
Ich lass' die Sorgen hinter mir und bleibe für immer hier
Ich mein' hier bei dir, hier hab' ich mein' Platz gefunden
Können Sterne tanzen oder ist die Nacht betrunken?
Betrunken und ehrlich, jung und gefährlich
Lass uns leben als wären wir unsterblich
Oder lass uns beide heute Nacht gemeinsam sterben
Denn so müssten wir niemals einsam werden
Du hast gesagt warum sollten wir ängstlich leben?
Wir haben das worüber die andern ständig reden
Ihre Herzen sind gefroren, ihre Blicke, sie sind leer
In dieser undankbaren Zeit hat ein Bitte keinen Wert!
Doch bitte sag mir was ist nur aus uns geworden?
Du lachst und sagst all die Helden sind jung gestorben
Selbst Bonnie und Clyde haben sich nie unterworfen
Das heißt der Abschaum von heute ist Kunst von morgen, he?

Nur du und ich, nur wir zwei
Haben nicht viel, doch sind unendlich reich
Brauchen uns so wie Bonnie und Clyde
Wie Bonnie und Clyde, für die Ewigkeit
Nur du und ich, nur wir zwei

Amir Sulaiman,"I am not beautiful, I am an elegant beast
A well-mannered monster, a charming barbarian
I will pillage your heart with language so lavishly violent
You will curse me for coming and curse me for going
Your crying and your moaning will share the same sound

Put pen to paper the first time when I was barely eight or
Maybe nine, that was the late eighties, Reagan time
Put in the freshest tape, rewind, wait, let me take my time
The entire landscape of that blank page was mine
Created space to climb inside, escape the crazy times
Reshape the climate, break it down, that was my frame of mind
Thank the divine great designing this as my sacred shrine
I made myself a place to shine, wait, let me spray this rhyme
When I was thirteen I met KRS, he put me on the stage
Suggested I read up on Malcolm X, y'all know the rest
So much pushing down on my chest
Both my folks got laid to rest
Loved ones wishing me all the best
I'm a ball of stress, yet I digress
I've spent my every hopeless dream and my unspoken secret
You hear it floating through your speakers in my old releases
My fanbase began to grow beneath and crowd around me
I never tiptoed 'round here shy, I spit it loud and proudly
The U.S. government profiled me and the sponsors dropped me
Some of my listeners felt away so they no longer got me
I knew that telling that truth is costly, no one alive can stop me
I rolled that flag out on the ground and prostrated my body
This is more than music to me, this is ancestors
Speaking through me at the tomb of Rumi
My mic’s a rifle, I’m honor-bound to fire my weapon truly
Whether they jeer me, cheer me, boo, salute me or just shoot me
Let it be known, my whole life I break that cycle set it in stone
I'd still rather be known as a man that stand on my own
Rather than beg at a throne cold
You know I still honor my own code that go down to the bone
We just want to get it on shooting at the devil
With a megaphone till we dead and gone

Something in the way of things
Something that will quit and won't start
Something you know but can't stand
Can't know get along with
Like death
Riding on top of the car peering through the windshield for his cue
Something entirely fictitious and true
That creeps across your path hallowing your evil ways
Like they were yourself passing yourself not smiling
The dead guy you saw me talking to is your boss
I tried to put a spell on him but his spirit is illiterate

I know things you know and nothing you don't know
'cept I saw something in the way of things
Something grinning at me and I wanted to know, was it funny?
Was it so funny it followed me down the street
Greeting everybody like the good humor man
But an they got the taste of good humor but no ice cream
It was like dat
Me talking across people into the houses
And not seeing the beings crowding around me with ice picks
You could see them
But they looked like important Negroes on the way to your funeral
Looked like important jiggaboos on the way to your auction
And let them chant the number and use an ivory pointer to count your teeth
Remember Steppen Fetchit
Remember Steppen Fetchit how we laughed
An all your Sunday school images giving flesh and giggling
With the ice pick high off his head
Made ya laugh anyway

I can see something in the way of our selves
I can see something in the way of our selves
That's why I say the things I do, you know it
But its something else to you

Like that job
This morning when you got there and it was quiet
And the machines were yearning soft behind you
Yearning for that nigga to come and give up his life
Standin' there bein' dissed and broke and troubled

My mistake is I kept sayin' ""that was proof that God didn't exist""
And you told me, ""nah, it was proof that the devil do""
But still, its like I see something I hear things
I saw words in the white boy's lying rag

Said he was gonna die poor and frustrated
That them dreams walk which you 'cross town
S'gonna die from over work
There's garbage on the street that's tellin' you you ain't shit

And you almost believe it
Broke and mistaken all the time
You know some of the words but they ain't the right ones
Your cable back on but ain't nothin' you can see

But I see something in the way of things
Something to make us stumble
Something get us drunk from noise and addicted to sadness
I see something and feel something stalking us

Like and ugly thing floating at our back calling us names
You see it and hear it too
But you say it got a right to exist just like you and if God made it
But then we got to argue

And the light gon' come down around us
Even though we remember where the (light or mic??) is
Remember the Negro squinting at us through the cage
You seen what I see too?

The smile that ain't a smile but teeth flying against our necks
You see something too but can't call its name

Ain't it too bad why'all said
Ain't it too bad, such a nice boy always kind to his motha
Always say good morning to everybody on his way to work
But that last time before he got locked up and hurt, real bad

I seen him walkin' toward his house and he wasn't smiling
And he didn't even say hello
But I knew he'd seen something
Something in the way of things that it worked on him like it do in will

And he kept marching faster and faster away from us
And never even muttered a word
Then the next day he was gone
You want to know what

You want to know what I'm talkin' about
Sayin' ""I seen something in the way of things""
And how the boys face looked that day just before they took him away
The is? in that face and remember now, remember all them other faces

And all the many places you've seen him or the sister with his child
Wandering up the street
Remember what you seen in your own mirror and didn't for a second recognize
The face, your own face

Straining to get out from behind the glass
Open your mouth like you was gon' say somethin'
Close your eyes and remember what you saw and what it made you feel like
Now, don't you see something else

Something cold and ugly
Not invisible but blended with the shadow criss-crossing the old man
Squatting by the drug store at the corner
With is head resting uneasily on his folded arms
And the boy that smiled and the girl he went with

And in my eyes too
A waving craziness splitting them into the jet stream of a black bird
Wit his ass on fire
Or the solomNOTness of where we go to know we gonna be happy

I seen something
I SEEN something
And you seen it too
You seen it too
You just can't call it's name name name name name name name",Something in the Way of Things (In Town),2002

Once again, I'm staring at the phone
I'm trying to find the words to tell you how I miss you
How it's changed since you've been gone

And you might not understand if you've never loved a man
So deep and so strong that you'll keep on holding on

To that road the leads me back to you every time
To the voice that's telling me to leave it all behind
My heart's still beating to the rhythm of your love
And nothing else can be enough, no no

I can't remember now what could have been so bad
Whatever made me let you go
And I know that time has made me blind to the reasons
It's a sugar coated memory, that I know

And you might not understand if you've never loved a man
So deep and so strong that you'll keep on holding on

Once again I wonder, why I love you still?
Why I just can't let go of the past?
'Cause in my heart, I know that it was over long ago
But being without you is just too hard

So don't try to understand 'cause I don't think I even can
Why it's so deep and so true, the way I'm loving you

Once again I wonder, why I love you still?
Why I just can't let go of the past?

But being without you is just too hard

With you it seems I've broken every rule
But I believe in chances and I'm going to take a chance on you

'Cause when I rest within your arms
It feels like I'm finally found

And it's plain to see, yeah, that baby, I believe this is love
(Love has finally found me)
And I can't hold back now, I've finally found you, my love
I have finally found my love, my love

And it feels like I should be right here with you to stay
'Cause I want to know this kind of peace within me always
Never known just how it felt to not be scared
So I'll put myself in your hands 'cause I know you'll always be there

'Cause when I rest within your arms
It feels like I'm finally found

And it's plain to see, yeah, that baby, I believe this is love
(Love has finally found me)
And I can't hold back now, I've finally found you, my love
I have finally found my love, sweet love
",This Love,2003
Amity Dry,"I've always been kind of brave
Never one to watch what I say
And people think my heads in the clouds
But I believe in dreaming out loud

'Cause all my life I have wanted more
The chance to prove what I know I'm here for

So I can't wait another day
I'm going to pack my bags and find my way
And I know I'll see it through
'Cause it's all I've ever wanted to do

I've always seen it so clearly
Always known where I'm meant to be
I know my life has a purpose
And there are great things waiting for me

'Cause all my life I have wanted more
The chance to prove what I know I'm here for

So I can't wait another day
I'm going to pack my bags and find my way
And I know I'll see it through
'Cause it's all I've ever wanted to do

And I know it won't be easy
But nothing is for free
And if I just keep believing
I will find my dream

So I can't wait another day
I'm going to pack my bags and find my way
And I know I'll see it through
'Cause it's all I've ever wanted to do
",Wait Another Day,2003
AMM,"When you're drowning
When you're freezin'
When you're feeling cold
There's a light in the darkness
As the elder always told

When the winter's coming closer
And the autumn is passing by
Then the world will sink in silence
And I think we all should try

Oh, I wanna live my life in a fairy tale
Where the end is always good and never sad
Show me the way to another world
Where the sun is always shining in the end

And we fight back the tears, and we lose our fears
Let the world remain in silence for a while
Sun in our minds in a world full of ice
Let silence remain for a little while

Somebody came and slammed the door
Took the feelin' away from our hearts
And the horror took hold of a place
In our hearts filled with love

What is left behind the ice
Behind the make up and the lies
Tell me what goes on inside our minds?
There is a hole in our sky
Getting bigger, growing wide
No more answer, but we hold the line, oh yea

See and hear what we have done to us all
We wanna be free more than anything
Do you hear what I say to you?
We will make it through, the sun shall shine

Hear the words we say and see the light of day
We never will be free until the sun is shining for us all

Carry on, carry on and make our dreams come true
And for a little while we stay together
Carry on, carry on, may all our lovin' stay
And for a little while we stay together, forever
Together, forever
Together, forever
Together, forever
