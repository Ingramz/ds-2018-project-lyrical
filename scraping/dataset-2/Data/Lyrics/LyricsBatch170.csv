Doris Justis,"Dancing in the dark Till the tune ends,
We're dancing in the dark and it soon ends,
We're waltzing in the wonder of why we're here,
Time hurries by, we're here and gone;

Looking for the light of a new love,
To brighten up the night, I have you love,
And we can face the music together,
Dancing in the dark.",Dancing in the Dark,2005
Doris Justis,"Lying in my bed
I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flash back warm night, almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after

Sometime you pictured me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
Then you said, ""go slow, I fall behind""
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time

After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to grey
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm ok
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time

If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time

You said, ""go slow, I fall behind""
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time

Dóris Monteiro,"Lá se vai mais um dia assim,
E a vontade que não tenha fim, este sol
É viver, ver chegar ao fim,
Essa onda que cresceu, morreu aos seus pés
E olhar pra o céu que é tão bonito,
E olhar pra esse olhar perdido
Nesse mar azul
Uma onda nasceu, calma desceu sorrindo,
Lá vem vindo
Lá se vai mais um dia assim,
Nossa praia que não tem mais fim, acabou
Vai subindo uma lua assim,
E a camélia que flutua nua no céu",Nós E O Mar,1997
Doris Payne,"Just one look and I fell so hard

Forever and always uh oh uh oh

Doris Spears,"Day by day I'm falling more in love with you
And day by day my love seems to grow
There isn't any end to my devotion
It's deeper dear by far than any ocean

I find that day by day you're making all my dreams come true
So come what may I want you to know
I'm yours alone, and I'm in love to stay
As we go through the years day by day",Day by Day,2000
Doris Spears,"Everyone knows him as Old Folks
Like the seasons, he'll come and he'll go
Just as free as a bird and as good as his word
That's why everybody loves him so

Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away
Looks like we warm the steak

Someday there'll be no more Old Folks
What a lonesome old town this will be
Children's voice at play, will be still for a day
The day they take the Old Folks away",Old Folks,2000
Doris Spears,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You,2000
Doris Spears,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,2000
Doris Spears,"Don't know why there's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together,
Keeps rainin' all the time

Life is bare, gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather
Just can't get my poor self together,
I'm weary all the time
So weary all the time
When he went away the blues walked in and met me.
If he stays away old rockin' chair will get me.

All I do is pray the lord above will let me walk in the sun once more.
Can't go on, every thing I had is gone
Stormy weather

Since my man and I ain't together,
Keeps rainin' all the time",Stormy Weather,2000
Doris Spears,"I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms

If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me, oh

If I can see it, then I can be it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day

You seem to be without

Is it so hard to see
That I'm not invisible?
Feel like a fly on the wall

Not like your superman
But living and loving

To get your prescription filled
I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy

(I just want to hold you baby
I just want to hold you)
I just can’t see myself

And girl I’m hoping you hear me now
Because I meant every single word that I say
I’m just hoping you feel the way that I do
I’m just hoping you say that I love you too
And girl I’m hoping you hear me now
Because I meant every single word that I say
I’m just hoping you feel the way that I do
And girl I’m hoping one day you'll say I do

I know you think that I'll let you down
But I promise girl that I'll always be by your side
And no escape to give my love a try
But as time goes by, you’ll see that It ain't no lie, no ohh
(I don’t know what you've done to me
But whateva it is then I've been quakin' it)
Girl I think about you every single second of the day
I just can’t help myself breath
(And even though you're far away
You've been thru my heart, but you always leave)
It’s like you never even went away a day, no

And girl I’m hoping you hear me now
Because I meant every single word that I say
I’m just hoping you feel the way that I do
I’m just hoping you say that I love you too
And girl I’m hoping you hear me now
Because I meant every single word that I say
I’m just hoping you feel the way that I do
And girl I’m hoping one day you'll say I do

And girl I’m hoping you hear me now
Because I meant every single word that I say
I’m just hoping you feel the way that I do
I’m just hoping you say that I love you too
And girl I’m hoping you hear me now

When we called out for another drink
The waiter brought a tray

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

She said: ""there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see.""
But I wandered through my playing cards
And would not let her be

One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might just as well be closed

Could feel your tenderness

Now I'm burning with fire
Passion burnt along with desire
And I'm standing here waiting for the night
You belong to me
I'm burning op for you, so deep inside my soul

All I want it your love
It's the stuff
Where dreams come from
All I want it your love
Take me there with your magic touch
All I want is your love
Can't get enough

I'm caught inside a web of mystery
Holding on to what I think I need
And I'm lost here without you
I know I'm a fool to allow you
And I wonder when it was
That I said you can't feel good
I'm burning up for you,now I might loose control

I'm burning up for you, you're all that I need
The heat that I want
Is what I breathe",All I Want,1998
Doro,"Alles ist gut
Es wird schon immer irgendwie weitergehen
Alles ist gut
Wir werden nur nicht alle é»?erleben
Was wird so sein wenn ich jetzt geh
Word ich Dich jemals lebend wiederseh'n
Es sieht so aus, als ob's ein kurzer Weg war
Das alles irgendwie zu Ende geht
Ich weiss nur ich will uberleben
Und werde mich niemals ergeben
Ich lieb Dich besser jeden Tag
Und hoff dass nicht auch schon alles war
Alles ist gut
Ich hange doch so sehr an diesem Leben
Alles ist gut
Ich wurde darum alles dafur geben
Ich komm nicht druber weg mitanzusehen
Wie dunkle Machte uber Leben gehn
Alles ist gut
Vielleicht word ich's ja gar nicht mehr erleben
Alles ist gut
Was ist denn schon mein kleines Menschenleben
Es sieht aus wie ein kurzer Weg
Ich hoff das er noch nicht zu Ende geht
So lieb mich besser jeden Tag
Und wenn es geht auch noch danach
Alles wird gut
Es wird schon immer irgendwie weitergehen
Alles wird gut
Ich hoffe nur ich word es uberleben
Alles ist gut
Alles wird gut

Alles wird gut
Vielleicht gibt es ja danach noch ein Leben
Alles wird gut
Vielleicht word ich dich dann ja wiedersehen
Wiedersehen ........ wiedersehen ...........



",Alles Ist Gut,1998
Doro,"You like to play with me
You drive me wild
You hurt me really deep
And I don't know why
It seems to me that I'm a long,long way from home

I went to far on the road to nowhere
It's you and me in a living nightmare
I gave up everything just to stay
Close to your heart

You make me haul like the wind
I don't know how you got under my skin

Crying, shake it up
If I cry like you baby
Does it do it for you
Crying, am t enough
If I cry till forever
Will I ever get trough

I see the trouble
And I feel the danger
Is my heart heating for a heartless stranger

Just say a word and make me
See the things I don't understand

I'm freezing cold
And its getting colder
I'm losing hope
I can't wait no longer
If I could read your mind
I wouldn't come around here no more

You better know that I'm losing my bead
And when I go love will never come back

You gotta know' that you pushed me to far
You'll soon know how that feels
I tell you now there's only one way out
My last chance is, I'll turn it around",Cryin',1998
Doro,"I feel my days
Are running away like rain
I'm trying to hold on
Even though it's in vain
Off and on
Every day we change
All and all
Love and pain remains

I wish I could exist
Without your love
I wish I wouldn't be
Dependent on
Don't lie to me
To make it all alright
When your eyes
Are telling me good-bye

Don't go
You're all that I have
Don't go
Cause I love you so
Don't go
You're all that I have
Don't go
Cause I love you more than you know

I wish that I could rise
Above the pain

Can you see the fear I'm holding back

You can't imagine what it's like
I'm getting chills
I hear your voice each time

And every time we talk
I get shivers down my spine
I can't deny
You're always on my mind

I never had this feeling, never so strong before
With every day, I want you more
I can't stop believing, can't stop dreaming
Oh God, I wish I would know

What can take me into your heart?
What can I do?
Would you help me from falling apart?
Is my love enough for you? Enough for you

Everywhere I go
I wish you would pass me by
I keep on waiting for you anytime

And every night I pray
You would think of me sometimes
Hope I could move your heart
Your soul, your mind

Would it really matter if I knew you better
Oh, would you know which way to go
I can't stop believing, can't stop dreaming
It's you or no one in this world

What can take me into your heart?
What can I do?
Would you help me from falling apart?
Is my love enough for you? Enough for you

Never had this feeling, never so strong before
With every day I want you more
No, I can't stop believing, can't stop dreaming
Oh God, I wish I would know

What can take me into your heart?
What can I do?
Would you help me from falling apart
Is my love enough for you?

'Cause you're in love again
There's nothing to hide
Of all the other ones you've had
Baby you can't fool me,
I take no prisoners
I have no demands
But baby let me make you understand

I don't know
What you did last night
Keep your secrets, maybe I'll keep mine
Watch your step
Like I told you to
I'm keeping my eye on you
Keeping my eye on you

You got the best of me
I think that's alright
But don't you mess with me
You'll never survive
'Cause there's a part of you I feel
That drives me crazy

I've learned to trust myself
And nobody else
It's in the way you look at me
I can tell
You try so hard to make me feel good
Baby I don't buy it

I take no prisoners

Nothing at all
I know I'm falling apart

It's heaven with you only knowing
It's hell without you, are you going away
To leave me here a broken soul
In the cold and screaming dark
It's heaven with you, was I dreaming
It's hell without you, were you leaving me
And all good things come to pass
Walking tall on broken glass
From my heart
Heaven with you

Standing here in the shadows
All alone, feel it deep inside
Hanging on to forever
With you here it would be so right
Now I find myself coming apart at the seams
Hand in hand with a memory
On a road of shattered dreams

I can feel you when I'm sleeping

What did I do
Do you remember
I meant everything to you

Till the very last day of my life
Are you saying now it's time to die

Till the very last day of my life
Are you saying that you'll change
Your mind tonight

Oh I don't know
Where it started
But I know where it will end
And I pray that you'll still love me
Cause my life is in your hands

I'm lost inside without you
I hope you are as well
And I feel my soul is stranded
Alone in this living hell

You said it's forever
What did I do
Do you remember
I meant everything to you

Alone bore in the dark
Collecting all the pieces
Of another foolish heart

Doro,"I've been looking 'round and this is what I found
There's not one of us
Who wants to be somebody else
We would trade places, even trade faces
But when it comes to the heart
We wanna stay true to ourselves

There's not one of us like the rest of us
There's no two of us alike
And that will never change
All of us know it and all of us show it
But when it's down to the heart
I guess all of us are the same

All of us cry, all of us try to find someone
Whose love will last forever
All of us know, all of us are on our own
It's up to us, to make ourselves feel better
All of us so alone together

If it were not for you
I don't know what I'd do
And I just hope we go to heaven when we're gone
I've heard it's nice up there
You just sort of walk on air
And the best part's knowing
Nobody ever has to walk alone

All of us cry, all of us try to find someone
Whose love will last forever
All of us know, all of us are on our own

Doro,"I remember the day we met
My heart started speeding up
When you walked in the rehearsal room
I couldn't help it, fall in love
It wasn't the way you smiled
That blew my breath away oh no
It wasn't anything you said
It was all in the way you played

Let's rock forever
Take me up to heaven with that black guitar
Let's rock together
Play me that song that'll stir my heart
Let's rock forever, on 'n' on 'n' on
Let rock forever live on

(I like the way you do it)

Hey baby I'm amplified
Let me tell you what's on my mind
Bend the strings inside my heart

Keep it goin' in overdrive
Be the power that'll keep me alive

Inside these flames
When time has no meanin'
Where seasons don't change

And I don't feel no shame

There's an island
In my soul
There's desire
Burnin' deep down, down below

Dance demons
Lose control
This is a metal a metal tango

I might explode like a bomb in your hands

Could it be my heart desperately
If the tears I cry bring you to your knees
Could you ever feel desperately

Now the dream I had is over
Somehow I know it wasn't me
Oh my god there was ice when you ran
What I need to believe is the reason of time

Can't you listen
I hear a heartbeat
Or maybe thunder

I'm waitin'
See on the other side of town
I've seen the walls come tumblin' down
So I've come here to make you shake

So get up get up, get up get up
Oh come on, come on,
Come on why don't you come on

When east meets west
There's gonna be one hell of a mess
When east meets west
There's gonna be one hell of a mess
When east meets west

There's a finger on the trigger of a very troubled mind
Working for the love of satan
There's no blisters on his fingers
There's no blood on his clothes
But I've seen the world that he's been makin'

So get up, get up, get up, get up
Oh come on, come on, come on, why don't you come on

There's gonna be one hell of a mess

I'm hoping that you'll fall in love again

",Fall for Me Again,1998
Doro,"I never got into magic, but the magic got into me.
I'd been tangled up in love, but afraid of being free.
Men... I don't understand them.
They take you for all you got
And leave you howling at the moon
And thinking of... I don't know what...
Yeah, I do. Thinking of that man.
Is he alone? Is he thinking of me?
Does he still love me?
I needed some answers. Deep answers ...
So there I was on the side of town where the beggars sleep.
It was late. Real late ...

But I knew she'd be open. Gypsies love the night.
I heard that from a friend who once knew one.

Sure enough her light was on and her door was cracked.
The smell of incense made the night air cry out in desperation.

But I didn't care. I was looking for revelation.
So I walked in and made my way through a curtain of beads.
I put some money on the table
And she reached for a deck of cards and said: ""Sit.""
She told me to look in her eyes.

I did... But I also kept my eye on that deck.
She gazed at a card and then she said ...

I can see that you don't really want to know
What your future holds as you travel down the road
You'd rather believe that dreams do come true
Than to find out they can lie to you

She picked the money up from the table and stuffed it in her blouse.
I said, ""Wait a minute ... I was expecting a little bit more than that.""
She said, ""What do you want me to do? Turn myself into a cat?
I could you know. And I believed here.
Everything got deadly quiet.
Man, I was scared, but I didn't show it.
Then she broke the silence. ""Why are your palms sweating, child?""
God, this woman was good.
I asked her to read my palm. She said,
""All right, but it'll cost you another fifty,
And then I'm going to bed. Gypsies hate the night...
Gimme your hand. I'm gonna read between the lines.""

I can see that you don't really want to know
What your future holds, as you travel down the road
You'd rather believe that dreams do come true
Than to find he might be leaving you

She said ... I can see that you don't really want to know
What your future holds as you travel down the road
You'd rather believe that dreams do come true
So does the man who's followed you.

Doro,"There is a statue - out on an island
Lady Freedom's got nothing much to do
Just stands alone, her face set in stone
It reminds me of me... without you

And in case you didn't get my letter
I ain't been making any head-line news
I just walk around and wish we were together
I'm gettin' nowhere without you

Millions of people... I'm that much more lonely
I'm seeing you - in every single face
My mind's insane, my heart's in pain
Without you here I feel so out of place

And if it makes you feel any better
I ain't been doing things we used to do
I just walk around and wish we were together
I'm gettin' nowhere without you

Too late to explain - why I came here
It was just something that I had to do
But take it from me - you're all I need
'Cause I'm still in love with you

That forever is just a lie

When my only true love died
But last night I got the feeling
There was a spirit in the air
I lit a candle and I held my breath
I swear I saw you standing there
You spoke to me in whispers
And I melted at what I heard
There were echoes from the other side
In each and every word

Said love is undying
True love never dies
We'll meet up again
â??Cause love has no end
Love is undying
I'm so glad I saw you
I shivered inside
When you closed your eyes
But love is undying

And last night I dreamed a dream of you
Where you took me to the other side
You looked so happy, not a trace of tears
And I could not help but cry
You said I wasn't ready
To tell my world goodbye
But you'd wait for me until the end of time
And forever is not a lie

Listen well and I'll set you free
You can trust me
For eternity

No promise
Is honest
In a world of change

I rule the ruins with passion and pain
I rule the ruins
Sinner or saint
Fortune or fate

Alive and well in this livin' hell
I survived it all, now it's time to tell
Can you hear me
Do you hear me

Once a tattered soul on bended knees
With one hand to God, I felt the devil's breeze
I begged help me
Won't you rescue me

One promise dishonest
And everything will change

Don't touch me

Listen well and I'll set you free
You can trust me

No promise
Is honest
In a world of change

I rule the ruins with passion and pain
I rule the ruins
Sinner or saint
Fortune or fate

Alive and well in this livin' hell
I survived it all, now it's time to tell
Can you hear me
Do you hear me

Once a tattered soul on bended knees
With one hand to God, I felt the devil's breeze
I begged help me
Won't you rescue me

One promise dishonest
And everything will change

Wohl tausend mal und mehr ...
Ich war mein Freund
Ich war mein Feind
Gefangen und verlor'n

Versuchung macht mich schwach
Hab's wieder nicht geschaft
Geké??pft ein Leben lang

Tausend mal gelebt
Als hé??t' ich tausend mal geliebt
Tausend mal ein Leben
Lang nur dich gesucht

Tausend mal gelebt
Als hé??t' ich tausend mal gekillt
Hab' dich tausend mal begehrt
Es hat mich tausend mal zersté°?t

Ich hab' immer viel gegeben
Und doch war's nie genug
Hab' ein Leben lang geweint
Und nur unter Qualen
Word' ich weich ...

Denn ich kam um I'm Feuer
Und ertrank I'm tiefsten Meer
Doch nichts schmerzte mich mehr
Denn ich liebte viel zu sehr

Tausend mal gelebt
Als hé??t' ich tausend mal geliebt
Tausend mal vergebens
Nur nach dir gesucht
Tausend mal gelebt
Als hé??t' ich tausend mal gekillt
Hab' dich tausend mal begehrt
Es hat mich tausend mal zersté°?t

Ich hé??te alles drum gegeben
Um dich nur ein einziges Mal zu lieben ...
Hé??te dir ewige Treue geschworen
Hab' meine Seele total an dich verloren

Hab' dich tausend mal begehrt

The walls of my room fade away in the blue,
And I'm deep in a dream of you.

You come to my arms, may this bliss never end,
For we love anew just as we used to do
When I'm deep in a dream of you.

Then from the ceiling, sweet music comes stealing,
We glide through a lover's refrain, you're so appealing
That I'm soon revealing my love for you over again.

Dorothy Ashby,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind

Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind

Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find
In the windmills of your mind",The Windmills of Your Mind,1997

That magic night we kissed
There in the moon mist

Little pleasures they will share

I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,

And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.

When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.

I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.

Looks like we both agree

A-though I danced each girl in a twist and a-twirl
Ney one would do.
And I went a-my way 'til the fatal day
In the fling I was flung a-with you.
Oh

Now my heart is prancin'
A-gay as a lark and happy as a king.
The years I'll weather, in the hame on the heather,
With my one and only highland fling.
I thought you were fallin' for Andy MacPherson.

Ney, ney. He became an impossible person.
But what about you and that Connie MacKenzie?
She talked when I putted and drove me to frenzie.
But what of the lad known as Bobby MacDougal?

It pays to be thrifty, but he was too frugal.
And weren't ya daft about Megan McDerrmot?
I tasted her cooking. T'would make me a hermit.
How jealous I was of McDonald McCutcheon.

His neck had a head on, but there wasn't much in.
And what about Sandy?

His hands were too handy.
And wasn't there a Jenny?

I'm not wantin' any
I'm not wantin' any but you.

When I went a-dancin'
No special lad I was encouragin'.
Every lackly laddie was
My highland fling.

No glance I was glancin'.
Well, nothin' really worth a-mentionin'.
Hopin', watchin', waitin' for the
Real, real thing.

Ney one would do.
'Til it came to pass to this lucky lass
In a fling I was flung with you.

And I study the piano
And I never look behind me.

Lots of gardening and fixing,
All very outdoors.
In the driveway is a sports car

And I sew a little there

And the castle needs repair
And I never shed a tear
And I never turn a hair

Full of pleasant little things,
Full of scintillating dinners
With neighbouring kings.
There's a castle in the country
For weekends of rest
And we entertain at parties
In the little time remaining
And we're entertained by others
And it's very entertaining.

An efficient little kingdom,
The dominion of the Queen,
Where at any given moment
The ashtrays are clean.
There are many little battles
Which never are fought.

And if on occasion I think about you,

And I head another drive

And the dinner guests arrive,

You would think we were alive.

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

The moon may be high

So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night

Makes me stop before I begin

Dorothy Donegan,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Funny, but here's that rainy day

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Ludwig Von Beethoven is slumped over his piano 
And on the piano sits the just completed manuscript for his tenth symphony. 
It is his final, and he is certain, his greatest work.]

Since the time when ra and isis
Raised the sphinx out of the sand
And apollo dreamed athena
And men began to understand

That when darkness folds on darkness
In the restless tides of night
And lightning raises shadows
And for moments gives them life

It's been said by those who ponder
That it surely is a sign
That a life touched by the stars
Is now running out of time

And that somewhere in that darkness
In the heart of that great storm
The world returns a soul
That the gods caused to be born

And this was such a storm
The kind one rarely sees in life
For in a room now filled with shadows
The great Beethoven was spending

His last night

[From the shadows a beautiful spirit, fate, 
And her deformed dwarf son, twist, 
Emerge to inform Beethoven of what he has already deeply suspected, 
That this is to be his last night on earth. 
They are accompanied by numerous spirits and ghosts from his past.]",Overture,1959

And blame all your charms that melt in my arms

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Dorothy Lamour,"Would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a mule

A mule is an animal with long funny ears
Kicks up at anything he hears
His back is brawny but his brain is weak
He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak
And by the way, if you hate to go to school
You may grow up to be a mule

Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a pig

A pig is an animal with dirt on his face
His shoes are a terrible disgrace
He has no manners when he eats his food
He's fat and lazy and extremely rude
But if you don't care a feather or a fig
You may grow up to be a pig

Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a fish

A fish won't do anything, but swim in a brook
He can't write his name or read a book
To fool the people is his only thought
And though he's slippery, he still gets caught
But then if that sort of life is what you wish
You may grow up to be a fish

A new kind of jumped up slippery fish

And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo
Every day you meet quite a few
So you see it's all up to you
You can be better than you are
You could be swingin' on a star",Swinging on a Star (From Duffy's Tavern),2003

And lately I often do,

Dorothy Lamour,"When Madam Pompadour was on a ballroom floor
Said all the gentlemen ""Obviously,""
""The madam has the cutest personality""

And think of all the books about do Barry's looks
What was it made her the toast of Paree?
She had a well-developed personality

What did Romeo see in Juliet?
Or Figaro in Figarette?
Or Jupiter in Juno?
You know!

And when Salome danced and had the boys entranced
No doubt it must have been easy to see
That she knew how to use her personality

A girl can learn to spell and take dictation well
And never sit on the boss's left knee
Unless she's got a perfect personality

A girl can get somewhere in spite of stringy hair
Or even just a bit bowed at the knee
If she can show a faultless personality

Why are certain girls offered certain things
Like sable coats and wedding rings?
By men who wear their spats right?
(That's right!)

Telling of the wonders they can do.
There's con men and there's boosters,
Card sharks and crap-shooters.
They congregate around the Metropole.
They wear fancy ties and laces,
But where do they get their aces?
They all have got an ace down in the hole!

Some of them write to the old folks for coin,
And that is their ace in the hole,
And others have friends on the old Tenderloin;
That's their old ace in the hole.

They'll tell you of trips that they're going to take
From Florida to the North Pole.
The fact is, their name would be mud,
Like a chump playing stud,

But now we only kick it everyother blue moon
And a lot of that is my fault
But a lot of that is yo fault

Shit everytime we hit town 2 kick it
And visit so everything is everclear

Before the fame before the game
My nigga you was wit me
Talkin 2 all my niggas we was riddin round 6 deep
No homo but this money done came between us
My baby gurl growin up ain't you and even much seen her
Its funny the savage ways of money
And you and I both kno that niether of our mommas raised dummies
If the knew we wasn't talkin like we used 2
Or chillen like we used 2
They wuldnt like it much 'cause seein us was all they was eva used 2

'cause I kno that you kno that we kno
That we both ain't got nuthin but love 4 eachotha

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose

When they see you out with me

When you're passin' by flowers droop and sigh,
And I know the reason why

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

Don't buy sugar
You just have to touch my cup
You're my sugar
It's sweeter when you stir it up

When I'm taking sips from your tasty lips

Dorsey Brothers Orchestra,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic
That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,
To let 'em rest unexpressed.
I hate parading my serenading
As I'll probably miss a bar,
But if this ditty is not so pretty,
At least it'll tell you how great you are.

You're the top! You're the Colosseum,
You're the top! You're the Louvre Museum,
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss,
You're a Bendel bonnet, a Shakespeart sonnet,
You're Mickey Mouse.
You're the Nile, You're the Tow'r of Pisa,
You're the smile on the Mona Lisa.
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop,
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

Your words poetic are not pathetic
On the other hand, boy, you shine
And I can feel after every line
A thrill divine down my spine.
Now gifted humans like Vincent Youmans
Might think that your song is bad,
But for a person who's just rehearsin'
Well I gotta say this my lad:

You're the top! You're Mahatma Ghandi.
You're the top! You're Napolean brandy.
You're the purple light of a summer night in Spain,
You're the National Gall'ry, You're Garbo's sal'ry,
You're cellophane.
You're sublime, You're a turkey dinner.
You're the time of the Derby winner.
I'm a toy balloon that is fated soon to pop.
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

You're the top! You're a Ritz hot toddy.
You're the top! You're a Brewster body.
You're the boats that glide on the sleepy Zuider Zee,
You're a Nathan Panning, You're Bishop Manning,
You're broccoli.
You're a prize, You're a night at Coney,
You're the eyes of Irene Bordoni,
I'm a broken doll, a fol-de-rol, a blop,
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top.

You're the top! You're an Arrow collar.
You're the top! You're a Coolidge dollar.
You're the nimble tread of the feet of Fred Astaire,
You're an O'Neill drama, You're Whistler's mama,
You're Camembert.
You're a rose, You're Inferno's Dante,
You're the nost of the great Durante.
I'm just in the way, as the French would say
""De trop,""
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top.

You're the top! You're a Waldorf salad.
You're the top! You're a Berlin ballad.
You're a baby grand of a lady and a gent.
You're an old dutch master, You're Mrs. Aster,
You're Pepsodent.
You're romance, You're the steppes of Russia,
You're the pants on a Roxy usher.
I'm a lazy lout that's just about to stop,
But if Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

You're the top! You're a dance in Bali.
You're the top! You're a hot tamale.
You're an angel, you simply too, too, too divine,
You're a Botticelli, You're Keats, You're Shelley,
You're Ovaltine.
You're a boon, You're the dam at Boulder,
You're the moon over Mae West's shoulder.
I'm a nominee of the G.O.P. or GOP,
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

You're the top! You're the Tower of Babel.
You're the top! You're the Whitney Stable.
By the River Rhine, You're a sturdy stein of beer,
You're a dress from Saks's, You're next year's taxes,'
You're stratosphere.
You're my thoist, You're a Drumstick Lipstick,
You're the foist in the Irish svipstick,
I'm a frightened frog that can find no log to hop,
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!",You're the Top,

Now only use four-letter words

If low bars you like, 
If old hymns you like, 
If bare limbs you like, 
If Mae West you like, 
Or me undressed you like, 
Why, nobody will oppose. 
When ev'ry night the set that's smart is in- 
Truding in nudist parties in 
Studios. 
Anything goes. 

When Missus Ned McLean (God bless her) 
Can get Russian reds to ""yes"" her, 
Then I suppose 
Anything goes. 
When Rockefeller still can hoard en- 
Ough money to let Max Gordon 
Produce his shows, 
Anything goes. 
The world has gone mad today 
And good's bad today, 
And black's white today, 
And day's night today,

Find out Vanderbilts and Whitneys 
Lack baby clo'es, 
Anything goes. 

If Sam Goldwyn can with great conviction 
Instruct Anna Sten in diction, 
Then Anna shows 
Anything goes. 
When you hear that Lady Mendl standing up 
Now turns a handspring landing up- 
On her toes, 
Anything goes. 
Just think of those shocks you've got 
And those knocks you've got 
And those blues you've got 
From that news you've got 
And those pains you've got 
(If any brains you've got) 
From those little radios.

Can broadcast a bed from Simmons

Her only answer is one little smile,

 And change my lonely song to happiness

Loved the sky above.

And saw everything was love, love, love.

And a piece of mud --

To be flesh and blood.
And then along came the devil
Up out of the ground --
He tempted the woman,
And that spread sin all round, all round, all round.

On that apple tree,
There?d be no tears or sorrow,
We?d live eternally.

Dorville,"Voici, contée sur une valse musette,
L'histoire en quelques mots
Du beau roman d'une jeune midinette,
Et d'un petit Parigot
Tous les refrains d'amour sont un peu bêtes,
Celui là l'est aussi
Mais si vous reprenez en chœur ma chansonnette,
Je vous dirai: Merci!

Elle était jeune et belle,
Comme de bien entendu !
Il eut le béguin pour elle
Comme de bien entendu !
Elle était demoiselle,
Comme de bien entendu !
Il se débrouilla pour qu'elle ne le soit plus!
Comme de bien entendu !

Ils se mirent en ménage
Comme de bien entendu !
Elle avait du courage
Comme de bien entendu !
Il était au chômage,
Comme de bien entendu !
Ça lui faisait déjà un gentil petit revenu...
Comme de bien entendu !

Voulant faire une folie,
Comme de bien entendu !
Il offrit à sa mie,
Comme de bien entendu !
Un billet de la loterie,
Comme de bien entendu !
Ça ne lui fit jamais que cent balles de perdues...
Comme de bien entendu !

Mais il se mit à boire
Comme de bien entendu !
Elle ne fit pas d'histoires,
Comme de bien entendu !
Mais pour ne pas être une poire,
Comme de bien entendu !
Elle se consola en le faisant cocu.
Comme de bien entendu !

Il la trouva mauvaise
Comme de bien entendu !
Mais elle ramenait du pèze,
Comme de bien entendu !
Au lieu de ramener sa fraise,
Comme de bien entendu !
Il se contenta de lui foutre son pied au cul,
Comme de bien entendu !

Et, depuis, l'on raconte
Comme de bien entendu !
Qu'il y trouve son compte,
Comme de bien entendu !
Et, quand chez lui, on monte,
Comme de bien entendu !
Il s'en va faire un p’tit tour au P.M.U.

Oh yes, I did, ah, but this lass
It came to pass

Had a dark and different plan
She admired my own sweet man
She admired my own sweet man

We were friends, oh yes, we were
And she just took him from my life
Oh yes, she did, so young and vain
She brought me pain

But I'm wise enough to say
She will leave him, one thoughtless day
She'll just leave him and go away, oh yes

Dory Previn,"He lives alone in his great big house
With collages on the walls and cathedral halls

And he eats at a table with room for eight
And each course is served on a separate place
And he sits by his pool and he waters his plants
And he does not dance, he does not dance

He lives alone in his great big house
With his Jacobean chairs and his marble stairs

And he sleeps in a room with a dozen locks
And his money is kept in a cardboard box
Underneath his bed
(With his mother's ring)
And he will not sing, he will not sing

Nothing burns in the fire place
Leather bound are the books
A silent film star lived there once
And a lady comes in and cooks
And looks after him
(Because he pays her well)

He lives alone in his great big house
And when his pulse begins to pound
At an alien sound

Then he calls in a voice that can't be heard
To a room down the hall where no woman stirred
And he thinks of her and he wishes her there
And he cannot share, he cannot share

He lives alone in his great big house
With collages on the walls and cathedral halls
And he thinks of her and he wishes her there
And he cannot share, he cannot share
He cannot share, oh no, he cannot share

I know I got some handicaps t'overcome
I mean y'seen one midget, y'seen 'em all
Oh yeah, midget, oh yeah, small

And that's as far as you can see
Is that the sum
And total substance of me?
Midgets dwarfs chimps in a zoo
They all look alike to you

Well listen good 'cause I don't lie
There's a whole lot more to me
Than meets the eye
And it fills my little soul with midget hate

The way that people will not learn
To differentiate, yeah, sure midget
That's what you say
And that's as far as it goes

But have you ever said
That's a Hungarian midget?
Or that's a midget
With a wart on his nose?

Have you ever taken the time to notice
A midget with curly hair
It isn't fair, there are skinny midgets
Fat midgets, gay midgets, flat midgets

There are midgets in deep despair
Half a soul half a brain, half a heart
And twice the pain, sure they're cute

And they're a lot of fun
But would you want your sister
To marry one?

Midget small, that's it and that's all
The classification it is made
Midget runt, well, now I gotta be blunt
I wish I was born

I wish I was born a spade
Sure I would still be a midget
But I would have such
Such beautiful coloration

And among my fellow midgets
I would be a sensation
Talk about standing out in the pack

I wish I was black
Midgets dwarfs chimpanzees
Ain't it all relative
When you're on your knees?

So don't tell me, don't tell me
About minorities
I wish to Christ, I wish to Christ
I was black

On bend and battered wings
In search of mythical kings
Mythical kings

Sure that everything of worth
Is in the sky and not the earth
And I never learned to make my way
Down, down, down where the iguanas play

I have ridden comet tails
In search of magic rings to conjure
Mythical kings
Mythical kings

Singing scraps of angel-song
High is right and low is wrong
And I never taught myself to give
Down, down, down where the iguanas live

Astral walks I try to take
I sit and throw I ching aesthetic bards
And tarot cards are the cords to which I cling
Don't break my strings

(I wish you would)
Or I will fall
(I wish I could, I wish I could
I wish I could)

Curse the mind that mounts the clouds
In search of mythical kings
And only mystical things
Mystical things

Cry for the soul that will not face
The body as an equal place
And I never learned to touch for real
Or feel the things, iguanas feel
Down, down, down

Where they play
Teach me, teach me
Teach me, reach me

Screaming at the night
Screaming at the dark
Screaming at fright

I wasn't doing nothing
Just drive about
Screaming at the dark
Letting it out

That's all I was doing
Just letting it out

Well, along comes a motorcycle
Very much to my surprise
I said, ""Officer, was I speeding""
I couldn't see his eyes

He said, ""No, you weren't speeding""
And he felt where his gun was hung
He said, ""Lady, you were screaming
At the top of your lung""

And you were, doing it alone
You were doing it alone
You were screaming in your car

In a twenty-mile zone
You were doing it alone
You were doing it alone
You were screaming

I said, ""I'll roll up all my windows""
Don't want to disturb the peace
I'm just a creature
Who is looking for a little release

I said
""And what's so wrong with screaming
Don't you do it at your games
When the quarterback breaks an elbow?""
When the boxer beats and maims

But you were, doing it alone
You were doing it alone
You were screaming in your car

In a twenty-mile zone
You were doing it alone
You were doing it alone
You were screaming

I said, ""Animals roar when they feel like
Why can't we do that too
Instead of screaming 'Banzai baby'
In the war, in the human zoo""

He said, ""I got to take you in now
Follow me right behind
And let's have no more screaming
Like you're out of your mind""

So he climbed aboard his cycle
And his red-eyed headlight beamed
And his motor started spinning
And his siren screamed

He was doing it alone
He was doing it alone
He was screaming on his bike

In a twenty-mile zone
He was doing it alone
He was doing it alone

I was doing it alone
I was doing it alone

You answer with your mother's worn clichés
And in another life, your father hears his wife
And I see his fury blazing in your gaze

An echo hears an echo and my mother's fist is raised
The hand I clench at you shows her distrust
The way one behaves is determined in the graves
Of all the great grandparents gone to dust

Our fathers fight through us
As they fought their father's war
And the same old scene's repeated
As before and before and before
And before and before

And when I tell you how I hate you
Before the birth of Jesus
Before the death of Caesar
Before Siddhartha
Before Ulysses
Before the Trojan war

I tell you how I hate you

And behind an ancient door

With a perfect little bow around the middle
And a black man on a white horse
Or a white man on a black horse
It's got all these tired parts where
We don't even sing at random
Princess, raise the drawbridge
We don't serve your kind
It ends where it begins
And the beginning isn't pretty
Can't forget that not-so-perfect 
Bow around the middle ('round the middle, 'round the middle...)
Har-bour (???) [said like har-bow?]
And it goes a little something like this..
[Aesop Rock]
New walk in a broken sole (???), pedigree incessant
Got (Gut?) the cruddy (???) frame
The zealots enveloped inside the belly of the blame
Cut-throats the result of pope jokes soaked in poacher constants
And now the jewel emits cold, wander prominent.. honour (honour)
I bought up silkworms by the bucket like starter kits
So you first bought a stitch 
Joined damaged mammoth brigading caper
Nurse the tantrum with a fantasy chaser
I keep the spare wings strapped to my fuses
In case the hackers snatch the plumage
[Dose One]
So you mean these things are worth money
Now drifting off
This is the who-you-calling-homeless
Mock me fearful
Twisted ???? ???? and I got front row seats at the d-d-d-d-dead concert
And you're in it, Ichabod (???)
Running out of most (???) from the Alamo (???) we're moseying 
My kind of people ???? ???? ???? ???? moseying (???)
With my eyes patched ???? ???? ???? universe
So I back it and gave my verdict (???) ???? ???? ???? ????
[Aesop Rock]
Oh it'll be soon (real soon)
???? ???? immune to doom blends
I eat ditch (???) in the kitchen 'til every spoon bends
A glance along tomorrow, sorry
Looking not at hopefuls (???), where's the raindance
My little flint never dreamed would flood unpotable
See I sanitize nothing for the sake of contemporary taste
Contemporary taste made my lip drop in the first place (incoming)
Hmm, yo why not be a czar, analyze fallen heroics
Recognize root of the worship, search and hold it
Who put the fun in dysfunctional? I..
Chronicle sun combustible, donkey-punching pinholes
In uncomfortables and conjunctionals for good (good)
Dr-rink up, slop a goblet of dirt wine (???),
I nurse a single application of introvert, serpentine
[Dose One]
Now a sunset without a scrape of red an-an-and plastic bag
Now sunk around his head (???) sick-sick-sick-sick... (???)
???? ???? ????
The sickness likeness in the roofer's eyes and his alone
And nothing terrible happened to the bag
???? ???? ???? ???? ????...
And brought on out...
And clouds...
The hiss cuts out... (???)
Suppose it's noise...
And the piano...
And the window frrraame... (???)
Sky and dirt that's fresh... kept
From where I'm going... holy other
Holy other, holy other, holy other...
[Aesop Rock]
be	-be	-be	-be	-be	-But
I've got charcoals in my heart, I've got charcoals in my heart
I've got charcoals by the armfuls that burn my armor apart
I've got charcoals in my heart, but I've got charcoals in my heart
I've got charcoals by the armfuls that burn my armor apart
[Dose One]
And before, when I said 'Shut the fuck up, it's none of your business'
That was to be in vain
You shoulda locked that up when you're all finished
Finished yet? Now uhm...
I usually finish this number with uh... my skull up (???)
[Aesop Rock]
Everybody rally around the novel burners, spit, murder the matches
Where the junkies trade diseases and the gullible trade passions
Then the masses want to lean on me like 'O Captain, my Captain'
Not considering maybe this oarman hosts orbit attachments...
[Dose One]
Button, button, who's got the button (???)
Take my name, please...
Button, button, who's got the button (???)
Leaks the little checker-men made out of lightning in my ????
Oh, you like to help with goats (?!?) see what I got in this here locket

La haine a pris le pas sur les quelques principes qui me restaient, croix sur eux
Une seule manière de donner la vie, 10 000 manières de donner la mort
Ca fait déjà deux semaines que j'y pense: où, quand, que faire du corps?
Je nous revois tits-pe jouant dans cette insouciance propre à notre jeune âge
Bien avant que la rue nous charme, bien avant de tomber dans l'engrenage
On s'est fait nous-mêmes nos repères (nos repères)
T'étais mon frère d'une autre mère
Mon coeur fut pénétré par toutes sortes de sentiments plus noirs les uns que les autres
Putain mais qu'est-ce qu'il t'a pris sale enfoiré?
T'as trahi le clan, t'es plus l'un des nôtres

Je t'ai aidé à te refaire après ta première peine de prison ferme
J'débitais à mort donc je suis très vite monté (oui)
T'avais peut-être un peu le mort, du moins c'est ce qu'on me racontait
Mais moi, t'étais mon frère (mon frère)
Alors qu'est-ce que j'ai fait, hein?
Je t'ai fait prendre part aux affaires (oui) et on est devenus associés

Ouais, pour moi c'est ça la famille
Ton billet c'est mon billet
Mon billet c'est ton billet

Combien de fois j'ai fermé les yeux sur les trous que tu faisais dans la caisse
Combien d'embrouilles j'ai calmées chaque fois que tu douillais des mecs de la tess (hein)
Tu fumais le fric dans tes tchoins (tes tchoins)
J'ai compris que t'étais à l'Ouest le jour où j'ai appris
Que tu sniffais ta propre cess dans la raie de leurs fesses
Il fallait donc que ça cesse
J'ai décidé de mettre un terme à notre collaboration dans le business
Rien ne bouge, tu restes mon frère c'est juste qu'il n'y a plus d'affaires entre nous
Et tu sais quoi la tête de ma mère que tant que je serais en vie
Tu ne te retrouveras jamais sans-le-sou, gros
Mais non pour toi c'était trop, monsieur était touché dans son égo
Sans compter ces faux rebeus, ces faux négros qui te montaient la tête, te bourraient le cerveau
Des PD à qui on ne donnait même pas l'heure
Ils se sont servis de toi pour essayer de m'atteindre
T'as pas de principe igo, t'as pas de valeurs

26 Janvier 85
Une lionne à mis pas
Un cri déchirant dans la chaleur d'une nuit
Je suis né à ris-Pa
J'ai grandis seul auprès de ma mère
Et je suis prêt à te faire beaucoup de mal si tu lui nuit
Ta dépouille au sol, petit fils de pute
Y'a bien eu 12 coups mais il n'est pas minuit (oui oui)
Tu sais quoi je vais pas faire le miskine mais j'ai connus de vrais périodes de dèche
Quand j'avais 9 piges je faisais le tour des parc-mètres
Je me niquais les mains mais je chopais un peu de fraîche (oui!)
Au putain que j'en ai mangé du riz au sardines et des nouilles au thon
Ma seule routine c'est de charbonner, sache qu'en aucun cas je ne joue pas au con
Plus jamais les huissier, plus jamais les huissiers, plus jamais les huissiers
Je les ai vus tout vider chez mon vieux
Lui laisser que son pieu
Gros, j'étais médusé
Plus facile de me la raconter que de me raconter
Moi je voulais monter, je toujours tombé à côté

Je peux vous jurer que je ne voulais de mal à sonne-per
J'oeuvre juste pour le bien des miens
(Tout pour la famille, oui tout pour le squad)
Tant que ma paire de Margiela est propre frère (oui!)
Tant pis si j'ai du sang plein les mains

Soit la rue te prends la vie, soit elle t'apprends la vie
Fréro c'est un fait
Dans les 2 cas sois bien sur d'un truc
C'est de finir avec du plomb dans la tête (hey!)
Je sais pas ce qui est pire sur le plan de la morale
Que je bicrave de la dope ou le fait que j'en éprouve pas plus de remords que ça
Je n'ai rien d'adorable (hey!)
Tentes pas de me la mettre
Fais pas de plan sur la comète
Toi et moi c'est Versace contre Com-8 (Yeah!)
Mais crois pas que je suis fier des méfaits que j'ai pu commettre
La fin, les moyens rien de neuf
Faut déjà connaître

Je peux vous jurer que je ne voulais de mal à sonne-per
J'oeuvre juste pour le bien des miens

J'suis pas sorti d'affaire, il m'arrive encore de faire des coups
J'ai un showcase calé dans le k-end-wee
20 minutes chrono, j'récupère mes sous
J'suis au volant d'mon fer, j'roule en direction du bando
J'écoute des prods, j'bosse ma zik et ma zipette, réfléchissant au coupé sport
J'suis toujours avec les mêmes pules-cra
Chulvanij m'a signé sur Def Jam mais sans grande attente
J'sais qu'l'industrie m'respectera pas tant qu'j'aurais pas mis le roro dans la fente à sa tante
Donc je charbonne, charbonne
Maintenant ces putes me reconnaissent en club
Elles sont v'là bonnes, v'là bonnes
Elles kiffent sur les gros brava du nègravo et son regard de thug
Elle a pisté mon Insta', m'a direct ajouté sur pe-sna
Photos, vidéos, capte pas, wesh qu'est-ce qu'elle veut, igo j'capte pas

Elle veut que j'lui ramène des pilules, de la CC et toutes sortes de psychotropes
Elle est venue avec une de ses potes, man j'sais pas c'qui lui trotte
Elle m'a l'air pire que hot
Elles m'attendent dans une suite au Mariott
Elles sont chaudes comme les braises de l'enfer
Moi j'suis sur scène j'assure le show, pensant au le-sa que j'vais leurs faire
Elles aiment se khabat, avant de se faire casser la boîte
Elle me dit qu'son délire c'est d'me ce-us la B
Pendant que j'la tire par les veuch' et qu'j'la braque
J'sais qu'j'suis pas l'seul négro sur l'dossier
Mais ma chérie je n'en ai rien à battre
Tant qu't'es avec moi comme si tu n'es qu'à Dosseh, j'ai une pile de taff à abattre
Faut pas que j'me disperse, j'ai un album à finir d'écrire
Y'a ma maison d'skeud' qui m'presse
J'dois construire une nouvelle Rome en un seul jour comme Kanye West
Leggings, talons, taille fine, fesse

Dot Rotten,"Hey
Can you hear me?
I just wanted to let you know
Hm

I hope you can hear what I write to you
How could I say goodbye to you?
When I'm a life that came out of the inside of a life that was inside of you
I gotta respect the way you provided food, for the whole fam'
You came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man
Cold double 8, 8 kids bare wheels
Plus racists full of hatred in your own plant
3 jobs in a day
Rest in life in you working but you were never stress free
Just locked in a cage slaving
They said they were gold in the pavements
But you came and saw the road to amazement
Broke your heart
But still you were prone to last and your sorrow was over fast
I hope your listening right
I still think of you every Sunday
No one can top your chicken and rice
Even through the darkness times
You held us all up because your vision was bright
I knew your strength was your wisdom inside
You never let anyone see your heartache
You just got on with it
Anyone tells me that they knew you said you were beautiful
And your words you would stand strong with it
'Cause they were like warmth on a winter night
But I was just too young to go on with it
And there somethings I could try to do
But it's an impossible task for me to even try to say goodbye to you
I couldn't do that, I owe my life to you.

And of the pieces of my soul
(Because I need a sign, I hope this pain will heal in time)
You know I never want to be alone

I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
Can I say goodbye to you, oh

I think you phoney
I was younger with the knowledge of things that I know now
I would be by your side when you needed me
Instead of asking you 'Nan can I go out?'
Standing in a road with the gangs that I know now
Everyone's missing you loads, Jessica's grown up
Warreen, Lauren and Alex are fine and I'm living with hope
It's been a while since I've seen C and the mouths
I miss seeing a family, being a family
And us agreeing with smiles how it used to be as a child
But as time goes by, the bridge seems longer
Family problems have never been funny
In my heart the only one that dissed me was Sonia
She took all our inheritance money
Left the rest of us to pick up the pieces
I never forgive the way she betrayed us.
There ain't a big enough reason
Before I sell out my fam' I'll be giving up breathing
But I guess that everyone's different
Or should I say no one's perfect?
She had happiness in front of her
But chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing.
Since you gone the foundations crumbled
So building it back up is my next step
I got all the bricks and the cement but
It's hard when it's done, I don't know what to expect
So give me the strength that I need to perform this task
Make it right, I must do
And I ask cause I trust you
It goes way beyond a song when I say I love you.

And of the pieces of my soul
(Because I need a sign I hope this pain will heal in time)
You know I never wanna be alone

I can see the stars as a cold the wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
Can I say goodbye to you, oh

It's just for now so I should hush
I'll never get enough, I'll see you, when I see you but,
I miss you
Ohh how I miss you
It's just for now so I should hush
I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but,
I miss you
Ohh how I miss you

There ain't enough words to describe
How sorry I am for the pain that I caused
Sorry for when I stuck up my own blood
We were young and he said it was raping his broad
And for the day police came to the door
I'm sorry for being such a bad youth
Stealing from your purse and making you mourn
I never been able to say this before
'Cause I was so inconsiderate
You loved me unconditionally
And I took advantage of it like a idiot.
Not seeing the pure soul that I was living with
I really hope that you can forgive me
You going away was a punishment
But I won't let go I'm holding you with me
But I still fight the emotions within me.

I can see the stars as the cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
And can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down your face,
Feel the chill of your warm embrace?
And can I say goodbye to you?

I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air,
And will you think of me up there?

Dottie Dodgion,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",He's Funny That Way,1996

Your eyes that promise sweet nights,
Bring to my soul a longing, a thirst for love devine.
In dreams I seem to hold you, to find you and enfold you,
Our lips meet and our hearts, too, with a thrill so sublime

Those cool and limpid green eyes -
A pool wherein my love lies.

So deep that in my searching for happiness
I fear that they will ever haunt me,
All through my life they'll taunt me
But will they ever want me?
Green eyes, make my dreams come true.

Dottie West,"There goes my only possession there goes my everything
I hear footsteps slowly walking as they gently walk across a lonely floor
And a voice is so softly saying darling this will be goodbye forever more
There goes my reason for living there goes the one of my dreams
There goes my only possession there goes my everything

As my mem'ry turns back the pages I can see the happy years we shared before
And the love that kept this old heart beating
Has been shattered by the closing of a door
There goes my reason for living",There Goes My Everything,1967
Dottie West,"Walk through this world with me go where I go
Share all my dreams with me I need you so
In life we search and some of us find I've looked for you a long long time
And now that I found you new horizons I see
Come take my hand and walk through this world with me
[ guitar ]
Walk through this world with me go where I go
Share all my dreams with me I search for you so
And now that I found you new horizons I see
Come take my hand and walk through this world with me




",Walk Through This World With Me,1967
Dottie West,"A bright array of city lights as far as I can see
The great white way shines through the night for lonely girls like me
The cabarets and honky tonks their flashing signs invite
A broken heart to lose itself in the glow of city lights
Lights that say forget his name in a glass of cherry wine
Lights that offer other guys with empty hearts like mine
They paint a pretty picture of a world so gay and bright
But I can't say I love you dear to a street of city lights

Lights that say forget his love in a different atmosphere
Lights that lure are nothing but a masquerade for tears
Yes they paint a pretty picture but my arms can't hold them tight
And I just can't say I love you to a street of city lights",City Lights,1967
Dottie West,"Now blue ain't the word for the way that I feel
And a storm's brewing in this heart of mine
This ain't no crazy dream, I know that it's real
You're someone else's love now, you're not mine

Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
For my yearning heart keeps sayin' you're not mine
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed
And that's why I'm lonely all the time

So please take the treasured dreams I had for you and me
And take all the love I thought was mine
Someday my crazy arms may hold somebody new
But now I'm so lonesome I could cry

Blue's not the word for that way that I feel
And the storm brewing in this heart of mine
This is no treasured dream, I know that it's real
You're someone else's love now, you're not mine

Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
But my yearning heart keeps sayin' you're not mine
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed
And that's why I'm lonely all the time

Please take the treasured dreams I had for you and me
And take all the love I thought was mine
Someday my crazy arms will hold somebody new
But now I'm so lonely all the time

Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
But my yearnin heart keeps sayin you're not mine
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed
And that's why I'm lonely all the time",Crazy Arms,1967
Dottie West,"Heartache number one was when you left me
I never knew that I could hurt this way
And heartache number two was when you come back again
You came back but never meant to stay

Now I've got heartaches by the number, troubles by the score
Every day you love me less, each day I love you more
Yes, I've got heartaches by the number, a love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting, that's the day my world will end

Heartache number three was when you called me
And said, ?That you were coming back to stay?
With hopeful heart I waited for your knock on the door
I waited but you must have lost your way

Now I've got heartaches by the number, troubles by the score
Every day you love me less, each day I love you more
Yes, I've got heartaches by the number, a love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting, that's the day my world will end",Heartaches by the Number,1967
Dottie West,"I don't hurt anymore, all my teardrops are dried
No more walking the floor with that burning inside
Just to think it could be time has opened the door
And at last I am free I don't hurt anymore

No use to deny I wanted to die
The day you said we were through
But now that I find you're out of my mind
I can't believe that it's true

And I've forgotten somehow that I cared so before
And at last I am free, I don't hurt anymore

No use to deny I wanted to die
The day you said we were through
But now that I find you're out of my mind
I can't believe that it's true

And I've forgotten somehow that I cared so before
And it's so wonderful now, I don't hurt anymore",I Don't Hurt Anymore,1967
