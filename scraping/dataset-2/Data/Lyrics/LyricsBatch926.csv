Richard Whitmarsh,"Desert shadows creep across purple sands.
Natives kneel in prayer by their caravans.

There, silhouetted under and eastern star,
I see my long lost blossom of shalimar

You, Misirlou, Are the moon and the sun, fairest one.

Old temple bells are calling across the sand.
We'll find our Kismet, answering love's command.

You, Misirlou, are a dream of delight in the night.

To an oasis, sprinkled by stars above,
Heaven will guide us, Allah will bless our love.","Misirlou Twist, for pops orchestra (arrangement of 'Misirlou')",2001
Richard Whitmarsh,"The shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow of Your Smile,2001
Richard Whitmarsh,"I was born on a farm out in Ioway
A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree
And we all played just the same ""Goofus"" harmony
And I must admit we made a hit
","Goofus, song",2003
Richard Whitmarsh,"You came, I was alone
I should have known you were temptation
You smiled, luring me on
My heart was gone, you were temptation
It would be thrilling 
If you were willing
If it can never be
Pity me for you are temptation and I am yours

Here is my heart, take it and say
We'll never part
I'm just a slave
Only a slave to you, temptation
You were born to be kissed
I can't resist.

You are temptation and I am yours
Here is my heart, take it and say
We'll never part
I'm just a slave
Only a slave to you, temptation","Temptation, song (from the film Going Hollywood)",2004
Richard Whitmarsh,"Please forgive this platitude
But I like your attitude
You are just the kind I've had in mind
Never could find

Honey, I'm so keen on you
I could come to lean on you
On a random bay, give you your way
Do what you say

Gee, it's all fine and dandy
Sugar candy, when I've got you

Then I only see the sunny side
Even trouble has it's funny side
When you're gone, my sugar candy
I get so lonesome, I get blue

But when you're handy
It's fine and dandy
But when you're gone
What can I do?",Fine And Dandy,2004
Richard Whitmarsh,"Ain't she sweet? See her walking down that street.
Yes I ask you very confidentially, ain't she sweet?
Ain't she nice? Look her over once or twice.
Yes I ask you very confidentially, ain't she nice?
Just cast an eye in her direction, oh me oh my, ain't that perfection?
Oh I repeat, well, don't you think that's kinda neat?
Yes I ask you very confidentially, ain't she sweet?

Richard Whitmarsh,"For once in my life I have someone who needs me
Someone I’ve needed so long
For once unafraid I can go where life leads me and somehow I know I’ll be strong

For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew
Someone warm like you
Who have my dreams come true

For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before

For once I have someone I know won't desert me
I’m not alone anymore

For once I can say 
This is mine you can’t take it
As long as I know I have love I can make it
For once in my life I have someone who needs me

For once I can say
This is mine you can’t take it

As long as I know I have love we can make it
For once in my life I have someone who needs me",For once in my life,2005

Richard Wiegel,"Blue days, black nights
Blue tears keep on fallin', for you dear
Now you're gone
Blue days, black nights
My heart keeps on calling for you dear
And you alone

Memories of you make me sorry
I gave you reason to doubt me
But now you're gone and I am left here all alone
With blue memories, I think of you

For the times I have made you blue","Blue Days, Black Nights",2003
Richard Wiegel,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues,2003
Richard Wiegel,"Hold me close and hold me fast
The magic spell you cast
This is la vie en rose

When you kiss me, Heaven sighs
And though I close my eyes
I see la vie en rose

When you press me to your heart
And in a world apart
A world where roses bloom

And when you speak 
Angels sing from above
Every day words 
Seems to turn into love songs

Give your heart and soul to me
And life will always be 
La vie en rose",La Vie en Rose,2003
Richard Williams,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?",Over the Rainbow,1960
Richard Wilson,"I had a dream,
A long happy dream,
That kind of dream you don't wanna wake up from.

I had a dream,
I thought you were with me,
Let's move away where nothing can touch us.

I had a dream,
And maybe you'd like to follow me,
To the country.
Where nothing really happens.

I have something you can call a weakness.
I cannot breathe the air I so desperately wanted to breathe,
In this town.

I have a feeling,
It could be simple.
A horse and lake,
And then just the forest.

And you and me are riding from all the troubles.
From all the people,
All the houses,
We have passed,
They follow us,
But nobody can catch us.

I have something you can call a weakness.
I cannot breathe the air I so desperately wanted to breathe,
A couple of years ago.",Dreaming,2007
Richard Wright,"It was meant to be a holiday
Building castles by the sea
Another way to live for you and me
Time to pause, consider what we've done
The wind is blowing, so come,
Let's take a holiday

How was I to know quite so soon
That dreams can turn a life,
Around it seems
There is no single way to live our days
Between these lines I know you see a man
Who's not quite sure who he is
Or where he stands

Sail on
Sail on, across the sea
Ride the waves, feel the breeze
Sail on
There's no other way I'd rather be

Destiny, reality are just a dream
Raise the sails, the wind is free
Every day I become more confused
Which way to go, how to choose

Back at home, what holds me here
Shut in not moving, only half a life
Clouds hang heavy, they leave me cold
It doesn't have to be this way
The wind is blowing, so come,
Let's take a holiday

Sail on
Sail on, across the sea
Ride the waves, feel the breeze
Sail on
There's no other way I'd rather be

Sail on

Richard Wright,"You feel her warmth, feel it like a summer day 
Shining from, the cloudless sky, it lights her way.

With darkness gone, like a distant road
We travelled all nigh until the morning rose.

Now we're turning, towards the sun, unfolding everyday
From out behind, the clouded mind,
With more than words to say.

We're half-naked souls and a harmony
Is a song of tears, all washed into the sea,
As we stand along the shoreline.

We were cut off from our lives, by a wall of pain,
It can't be seen, it's so routine, it has no face or name.

But now the day has broken, can see in better ways,
A path leading to the light, a hope that never fades.
All power to the brave.

You feel her warmth, feel it like solar rays,
See how, they kindle fire, illuminate her face.

Free as the sunlight that shines down from above,
That opens us all to feel love",Along the Shoreline,1996
Richard Wright,"I can see you through a pool of darkness 
I stretch out my hand to reach you 
I know you are there 
So please look at me 
How I've missed you 
How I've missed love 
My hand is here 

If you still know me 
Then touch my fingertips 

I see the waters move above your face 
I feel your naked hand 
Please don't let it go again 

Your sacrifice 
That meant so much 
Left us with no place to stand 
Please let me touch 
And let me near 
Let me near",Blue Room in Venice,1996
Richard Wright,"I can take or leave it, won't be the woebegone
Don't need a model universe to hang your pictures on.
You hide somewhere, you die somewhere
And then this senseless thought,
By hating more you're feeling more
And that's how you get caught.

They're never going to make it easy
Of this you can be sure.
I greet you from the wilderness,
I'll stay inside your door.

There's no cage or prison, they have no fence too tall,
You die more times that anyone, there's still no place to fall.

They're never going to keep it simple
This comes down from above.
I have no helm, no secret realm,
I dream to be at the heart of love, a part of love.

I bet you can conceal it, but that's just a dead-end track,
I'll cover you like the driven snow and then I'll bring you back.
You'll see ! you feel like, you feel like a banner,
Unfurled and gently blown,
And there before your opening eyes
The self you've never known.

They're never going to make it easy
Of this you can be sure.
You feel untied, beatified
And loved for evermore",Breakthrough,1996
Richard Wright,"A part of herself, she thought love was dying, 
The game of opposites, a hateful lie. 
She can't hang on at all, she's giving up the fight. 
She's locked in a wall of ice, 
Through half the day and half the night 
On a path that's been prescribed. 

Nothing comes, but she can't leave her life 
Or hear the falling rain, or the heart race in her. 
And dark as it grows at night, with fear of light's change 
She's drowning away 
In what she can do and what she contains 
And her heart it so low. 

Now, because I could not cope with the pain, 
How things are not the same, she's got no remedies. 
A heartbreaking fall and I fear a change of course 
I feel like we were born insane, 
I hear the love, I fear the love 

For the heart is low, see how it grows apart. 
And deep from the other side, we live so plain 
We have no night, we have no day, we have no falling rain. 
Not love in our eyes, not love in our stare 
Felt more like inner sea, had no quality 
So says those who drown at night 
Far from the harbour wall, far from the harbour wall.",Far from the Harbour Wall,1996
Richard Wright,"Why do we feel this adult pain
And hold these secrets that don't belong?
This loneliness has no place with us
The silence grows, it has no place with life.

You outward joy holds back the fears
Which deepen inside of us.

We travel all alone
And carry the guilt of those who disappear

Our childlike hopes,
In disarray
This pain no child should feel
We disappear.",Hidden Fear,1996
Richard Wright,"Now you feel it, a shiver and you begin
Frozen breath that scrapes across the skin
And a sound you've never heard before, you screaming

Welcome to the world of random noise
Where you simply haven't got a choice
When they push your levers and pull your strings

It's another world, it's a better world that we bring

Here you are on the planet of hot and cold
Where you'll do as exactly as you're told

In a world of a 1000 furry toys
You can hear the screams
Of little girls and boys
It's a charming noise
If you really want that kind of thing, mama

Now you feel it, a shiver and you've begun
When they pull those strings how you'll start to run!
And there's no stepping off or stepping down

It's another world and it's a better world,
That's what we have found",Night of a Thousand Furry Toys,1996
Richard Wright,"I'm ill with a fever, I feel like a child 
I lay in the dark 'til morning came. 
It's so unoriginal 
And I feel it worse at night 
I know it's not terminal 
But I'm near half-dead fright 
And freezing cold. 

But sooner than woke up 
To find it all unchanged 
I'll sleep through the day til the daylight ends. 
'Cause it's all so familiar 
As it comes around again 
The same taste to everything 
The same unbroken chain 
That still remains. 

With morning I rise, 
A dream that won't leave me, 
You're sad, naked and pale 

And you're reaching for the rail 

You took a look inside, how could you peel away 
Or break the shell, the hurt you've hidden so well 
For all your days. 

And you're going down 
As you slip beneath the waves, 
Won't make a sound 
Won't even leave a trace before you. 

I hear an appalling sigh from the streets below 
And it's creeping fear congealed in stone 
That paves the crazy road. 
And all are succumbing and they look so hopelessly 
At the heartbreak, it's easy to deal with, 
Just take these and you'll really never feel it.",Reaching for the Rail,1996
Richard Wyands,"As long as there's music and words of romance
The spell of a theme starts
You to dream there's always a chance
As long as there's music, whatever the song

As long as there's music for sweethearts to sing
I'll sing you, my love, melodies of the birds on the wing
My loneliest days will never seem long
As long as there's music and you are the song

As long as there's music for sweethearts to sing
I'll sing you, my love, melodies of the birds on the wing
My loneliest days will never seem long
As long as there's music and you are the song",As Long as There's Music [Take 2],1978
Richard Wyands,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see

And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Your tender kiss,
And the wonderful things we would do.

Richard Wyands,"Someone that I belong to
Doesn't belong to me
Someone who can't be faithful
Knows that I have to be
Wonder if I am wrong to give her my loyalty

Why should I be a lone soul
Why can't I be my own soul
Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisner of love
For one comand I stand and wait now

From one who's master of my Fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another
For I'm not free

Up on my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping

I'm white inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
I'm so forlorn. Life's just a thorn
My heart is torn. Why was I born?
What did I do to be so black and blue?

Richard Wyands,"Let's build a stairway to the stars
And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song
We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along
Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?
Can't we sail away on a little dream 
And settle high on the crest of a thrill!

Richard Wyands Trio,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!

Understanding how to hold onto you,

If i had to choose,
I'd be by myself,
I want to be in love,

Goes so slow whenever you're away,
Made up my mind and i'm positive,
I thought love would never come my way,

Open your mouth up you lost, I'm blinding these boys

I'm swanging four's and thinking thoed, banging hoes and changing clothes
Smoking dro and doing shows, paper stack can never fold

Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, 'cause nigga I'm a G

'Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man
I'm sitting on Dubs, kinda like a blank tape
You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something

Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top

Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine

You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car

'Cause it's my favorite holiday
But all this years been a busy blur
Don't think I have the energy
To add to my already mad rush
Just because it is the season 
The perfect gift for me would be 
Completions and connections left from last year 
World tour, aeroplanes and babies. 
Met some guys but never the time 
Most of 98 was along those lines. 

So deck the halls and trim those trees
Raise up the cups of christmas cheer
I just need to catch my breath 
Christmas with my mates this year

Calendar picture
Frozen landscape
Chill this room for twentyfour days 
Evergreens, sparkling snow, get this winter over with
Flash back to spring time, 
Sunny again
Would have been good to go for lunch 
Couldn't agree when we were both free 
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch, 
We didn't of course till the summer time,
Out to the beach to his boat could have joined him 
No this time, it was me, sunburn in the third degree
Now the calendars just one page
And of course I am excited
Tonights the night but I've set my mind 
Not to do too much about it.

'Cause I bundled up too tight 
Last minutes have-to-dos
A few cards, a few calls 
Because it's are S V P 
No thanks, no party lads 
It's christmas eve, gonna relax
Turn down all of my invites 
Last fall I had a night to myself
Some guy called halloween party 
Waited all night for him to show 
This time his car wouldn't go 
Forget it, it's cold, it's getting late 
Trudge on home to celebrate 
In a quite way I unwind, 
Doing christmas right this time

Tesco has provided me with the world's smallest turkey
All ready in the oven, nice and hot 
Oh damn, guess what I forgot 
So it's on with the boots back out in the snow 
To the army all night garage but when to my wondering eyes should appear 
In the line that guy I've been chasing all year
Spending this one alone he said
Give me a break this years been crazy 
I said me too, but why are you... 
You mean you forgot the papers too 
Then suddenly we laughed and laughed 
Caught on to what was happening
Christmas magic's brought this down to a very happy en-ending.

Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, same old dream

At every stop that we made

Where your kiss filled me with thrills

Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,

That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.
Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

He'll lift his head and brush his eyes with gentle strokes
That will only blindly mislead him
Into the first day of creation which he only sees in limitation

Now he sits upon his empty bed
His heart is warm, his heart is full and he can see
But it is impossible for him to retain me
For his arms are without form, he cannot know the word
As his mind cries out absurd

Now he's standing inside the doorway
He is afraid but he believes all that he sees on the floor
Where everything is merging
And pictures he sees are tragic as he begins to believe in magic

Now he lies down in a hole
Down in the ground where it is cold and now he knows
Now he realizes his biggest mistake
That he never had to grow old, and he never had to grow cold and die

Let the sun-rain fall and let the dewy clouds enfold you
And maybe you can sing to me the words I just told you,
If all the things you feel ain't what they seem.
And don't mind me 'cos I ain't nothin' but a dream.

The mocking bird sings each different song
Each song has wings - they won't stay long.
Do those who hear think he's doing wrong?
While the church bell tolls its one-note song
And the school bell is tinkling to the throng.
Come here where your ears cannot hear.

And close your eyes, child, and listen to what I'll tell you
Follow in the darkest night the sounds that may impel you
And the song that I am singing may disturb or serve to quellyou
If all the sounds you hear ain't what they seem,
Then don't mind me 'cos I ain't nothin' but a dream

The rising smell of fresh-cut grass
Smothered cities choke and yell with fuming gas
I hold some grapes up to the sun
And their flavour breaks upon my tongue.
With eager tongues we taste our strife
And fill our lungs with seas of life.
Come taste and smell the waters of our time.

And close your lips, child, so softly I might kiss you,
Let your flower perfume out and let the winds caress you.
As I walk through the garden, I am hoping I don't miss you
If all the things you taste ain't what they seem,
Then don't mind me 'cos I ain't nothin' but a dream .

The sun and moon both arise
And we'll see them soon through days and nights
But now silver leaves are mirrors, bring delights.
And the colours of your eyes are fiery bright,
While darkness blinds the skies with all its light.
Come see where your eyes cannot see.

And close your eyes, child, and look at what I'll show you;
Let your mind go reeling out and let the breezes blow you,
And maybe when we meet then suddenly I will know you.
If all the things you see ain
quote t what they seem,
Then don't mind me 'cos I ain't nothin' but a dream .
And you can follow; And you can follow; follow...

Richie Havens,"There's a high flyin' bird, flying way up in the sky
And I wonder if she looks down, as she goes on by
Well, she's flying so freely in the sky

Lord, look at me here
I'm rooted like a tree here
Got those sit down
Can't cry, oh Lord, gonna die blues

Now the sun, it comes up and lights up the day
And when he gets tired, Lord, he goes on down his way
To the east and to the west
He meets God every day

Lord, look at me here
I'm rooted like a tree here
Got those sit-down, can't cry
Oh Lord, gonna die blues

Now I had a woman
Lord, she lived down by the mine
She ain't never seen the sun
Oh Lord, never stopped trying

Then one day my woman up and died
Lord, she up and died now
Oh Lord, she up and died now
She wanted to fly
And the only way to fly is die, die, die

There's a high flyin' bird, flying way up in the sky
And I wonder if she looks down as she goes on by
Well, she's flying so freely in the sky

Lord, look at me here
I'm rooted like a tree here
Got those sit-down, can't cry
Oh, Lord, gonna die blues

Morning, morning 
Feel so lonesome in the morning 
Morning, morning 
Morning brings me grief 

Sunshine, sunshine, 
Sunshine left upon my face 
And the secret of the shining 
Puts me in my running place 

Evening, evening 
Feel so lonesome in the evening 
Evening, evening 
Evening brings me grief 

Moonshine, moonshine 
Moonshine dots the hills with grace 
And the glory of the shining 
Seems to break my simple pace 

Nighttime, nighttime 
Feel so lonesome in the nighttime

Does not bring me to relief

Chills the moon upon my cheek

Richie Havens,"I got the blues from my baby 
Down by the San Francisco bay,
The ocean liner's gone so far away
Didn't mean to treat her so bad, 
She was the best girl I ever have had,
She said goodbye, 
I can take a cry, 
I want to lay right down and die

I ain't got a nickel 
And I ain't got a lousy dime
If she don't come back, 
I think I'm going to lose my mind
If she ever gets back to stay, 
It's going to be another brand new day,
Walking with my baby down by the San Francisco bay

Sitting down looking from my back door,
Wondering which way to go,
The woman I'm so crazy about, 
She don't love me no more
Think I'll catch me a freight train, 
'Cause I'm feeling blue,
And ride all the way to the end of the line, 
Thinking only of you

Meanwhile, in another city,
Just about to go insane,
Thought I heard my baby, Lord, 
The way she used to call my name
If I ever get her back to stay, 
It's going to be another brand new day,
Walking with my baby down by the San Francisco bay,
Walking with my baby down by the San Francisco bay,
Walking with my baby down by the San Francisco bay",San Francisco Bay Blues,1967

There were three crosses upon the hill
Each one wore a burning hood
To hide its rotten heart of wood

And I cried
Father I hear the iron sound
Hoofbeats on the frozen ground

Down from the hills the riders came
Lord, it was a crying shame
To see the blood upon their whips
And hear the snarling of their lips

And I cried 
Mother I feel a stabbing pain
Blood flows down like a summer rain

Each one wore a mask of white
To hide his cruel face from sight
and each one sucked a hungery breath
Out of the empty lungs of death

And I cried
Sister raise my bloody head
It's so lonesome to be dead

And when he gets tired, Lord, he goes
On down his way to the east and to the west
He meets God every day

Lord, she lived down by the mine
She ain't never seen the sun
Oh Lord, never stopped trying

Then one day my woman up and died

It was told a million times though it need not be told twice. 

A soldier came down from Diem Ben Phu, with silence in his eyes. 
He told of many an evening when fire was the sky. 
He told of many a morning when the bravest of men would cry, 
Knowing, through Satan's earthbound magic, many more would have to die, 
Many more would have to die.

Richie Havens,"As you brush your shoes
And stand before the mirror
And you comb your hair
And grab your coat and hat
And you walk, wet streets
Tryin' to remember
All the wild breezes
In your mem'ry ever. 
And ev'rything looks so complete
When you're walkin' out on the street
And the wind catches your feet
And sends you flyin', cryin'
Ooh-wee! 
The wild night is calling. 
And all the girls walk by 
Dressed up for each other 
And the boys do the boogie-woogie 
On the corner of the street 
And the people passin' by 
Just stare in wild wonder 
And the inside juke-box 
Roars out just like thunder. 
And everything looks so complete...

Come on out and make romance....",Wild Night,2004
Richie Havens,"The sweet pretty things are in bed now, of course
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse
But the town has no need to be nervous
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
To Jezebel the nun, she violently knits
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce

Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues

The hysterical bride in the penny arcade
Screaming, she moans, ""I've just been made""
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
And says, ""My advice is to not let the boys in""
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride
""Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride
You will not die, it's not poison""

Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food

Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief
Saying, ""Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?""
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly
Saying, ""Death to all those who would whimper and cry""
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
Saying, ""The sun's not yellow, it's chicken""

Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues

The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves
Puts the pied pipers in prison and fattens the slaves
Then sends them out to the jungle
Gypsy Davey with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him, he tramps
With a fantastic collection of stamps
To win friends and influence his uncle

Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food
I'm in trouble with the tombstone blues

The geometry of innocence, flesh on the bone
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter
Now, I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille
He could die happily ever after

Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues

Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
And the National Bank at a profit sells road maps for the soul
To the old folks' home and the college
Now, I wish I could write you a melody so plain
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Of your useless and pointless knowledge

Well, what is a vigilante man?
Tell me, what is a vigilante man?
Has he got a gun and a club in his hand?
Is that is a vigilante man?

Rainy night down in the engine house,
Sleepin' just as still as a mouse,
Man come along an' he chased us out in the rain.
Was that a vigilante man?

Stormy days we passed the time away,
Sleepin' in some good warm place.
Man come along an' we give him a little race.
Was that a vigilante man?

Preacher Casey was just a workin' man,
And he said, ""Unite all you working men.""
Killed him in the river some strange man.
Was that a vigilante man?

Oh, why does a vigilante man,
Why does a vigilante man
Carry that sawed-off shot-gun in his hand?
Would he shoot his brother and sister down?

I rambled 'round from town to town,
I rambled 'round from town to town,
And they herded us around like a wild herd of cattle.
Was that the vigilante men?

Have you seen that vigilante man?

Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,2002
Richie Kamuca,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Richie Kamuca,"Artilleryman: We're gonna build a whole new world for ourselves. Look, they clap eyes on us and we're dead, right? So, we gotta make a new life where they'll never find us. You know where? Underground. You should see it down there, hundreds of miles of drains, sweet and clean now after the rain, dark, quiet, safe. We can build houses and everything, start again from scratch. And what's so bad about living underground, eh? S'not been so great living up here, if you want my opinion.

Brave New World

      Artilleryman
      Take a look around you at the world we've come to know
      Does it seem to be much more than a crazy circus show
      Maybe from the madness, something beautiful will grow
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men,
      We'll start... we'll start all over again!
      All over again! All over again! All over again!

      Artilleryman: We'll build shops and hospitals and barracks, right under their noses, right under their feet. Everything we need: banks, prisons and schools. We'll send scouting parties to collect books and stuff, and then like you we'll teach the kids. Not poems and rubbish; science, so we can get everything working! We'll build villages and towns, and... and we'll play each other at cricket! Listen, maybe one day we'll capture a fighting machine, eh, learn how to make 'em ourselves, and then: WALLOP! Our turn to do some wiping out! WHOOSH! With our heat ray! Whoosh! And them running and dying, beaten at their own game, man on top again!

      Artilleryman
      Now our domination of the earth is fading fast,
      And out of the confusion a chance has come at last,
      To build a better future from the ashes of the past,
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men,
      We'll start all over again!

      Look, man is born in freedom, but he soon becomes a slave,
      In cages of convention from the cradle to the grave,
      The weak fall by the wayside but the strong will be saved,
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men,
      We'll start all over again!

      I'm not trying to tell you what to be,
      Oh no, oh no, not me...
      But if mankind is to survive, the people life alive,
      They're gonna have to build this world anew
      And it's going to have to start with me and you... YES!

      I'm not trying to tell you what to be,
      Oh no, oh no, not me...
      But if mankind is to survive, the people left alive,
      They're gonna have to build this world anew
      Yes and we will have to be the chosen few...

      Just think of all the poverty, the hatred and the lies,
      And imagine the destruction of all that you despise,
      Slowly from the ashes the phoenix will arise,
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men
      We'll start all over again!

      Take a look around you at the world you've loved so well,
      And bid the aging empire of man a last farewell
      It may not sound like heaven but at least it isn't hell
      It's a brave new world with just a handful of men,
      We'll start, we'll start all over again!
      All over again! All over again! All over again!
      I'VE GOT A PLAN!

      Artilleryman: Can't you just see it? Civilization starting all over again! A second chance! Heh- we'll even build a railway and tunnel to the coast, go there for our holidays! Nothing can stop men like us! I've made a start already. Come on down here and have a look.

In the cellar there was a tunnel scarcely ten yards long. It had taken him a week to dig. I could have dug that much in a day, and I suddenly had my first inkling of the gulf between his dreams and his power.

      Artilleryman: It's doing the working and the thinking that wears a fellow out. I'm ready for a bit of a rest. How about a drink, eh? Nothing but champagne now I'm the boss.

We drank, and then he insisted upon playing cards. With our species on the edge of extermination, with no prospect but a horrible death, we actually played games. Later he talked more of his plan, but I saw flames flashing in the deep blue night, red weed glowing, tripod figures moving distantly, and I put down my champagne glass. I felt a traitor to my kind, and I knew I must leave this strange dreamer.

Richie Kamuca,"It seems totally incredible to me now that everyone spent that evening as though it were just like any other. From the railway station came the sound of shunting trains, ringing and rumbling, softened almost into melody by the distance. It all seemed so safe and tranquil.
Next morning a crowd gathered on the common, hypnotized by the unscrewing of the cylinder. Two feet of shining screw projected when suddenly, the lid fell off. Two luminous, disk-like eyes appeared above the rim. A huge rounded bulk, larger than a bear, rose up slowly, glistening like wet leather. Its lipless mouth quivered and slathered, and snakelike tentacles writhed as the clumsy body heaved and pulsated.
A few young men crept closer to the pit. A tall funnel rose and an invisible ray of heat leapt from man to man, and there was a bright glare as each was instantly turned to fire. Every tree and bush became a mass of flames at the touch of this savage, unearthly heat.
People clawed their way off the common, and I ran too. I felt I was being toyed with, that when I was on the very verge of safety this mysterious death would leap after me and strike me down. At last I reached Maybury Hill, and in the dim coolness of my home I wrote an account for my newspaper before I sank into a restless, haunted sleep.
I awoke to alien sounds of hammering from the pit and hurried to the railway station to buy the paper. Around me, the daily routine of life, working eating, sleeping, was continuing serenely as it had for countless years. On Horsell Common, the Martians continued hammering and stirring, sleepless, indefatigable, at work on the machines they were making. Now and again a light like the beam of a warship's searchlight would sweep the common, and the heat ray was ready to follow.
In the afternoon, a company of soldiers came through and deployed along the common to form a cordon.
That evening, there was a violent crash and I realized with horror that my home was within reach of the heat ray.
At dawn, a falling star with a trail of green mist landed with a flash like summer lightning. This was the second cylinder.",Horsell Common and the Heat Ray (Everybody Gather),2006
Richie Kamuca,"I suddenly noticed the body of a parson lying on the ground in a ruined churchyard
I felt unable to leave him to the mercy of the red weed, and decided to bury him, decently

Nathaniel! Nathaniel!

The parson's eyes flickered open
He was alive!

Nathaniel, I saw the church burst into flame, are you all right?

Don't touch me!

But it's me, Beth! Your wife!

No! You're one of them - a devil!

He's delirious!

Lies! I saw the devil's sign!

What are you saying?

The green flash in the sky
His demons were here all along, in our hearts and souls
Just waiting for a sign from Him
And now they're destroying our world!

But they're not devils, they're Martians

We must leave here!

Look, a house still standing, come Nathaniel, quickly

We took shelter in a cottage, and black smoke spread, hemming us in
Then a fighting machine came across the field
Spraying jets of steam that turned the smoke into thick, black dust

Ulla!

Dear God, help us!

The voice of the Devil is heard in our land!

Listen, do you hear them drawing near
In their search for the sinners?
Feeding on the power of our fear
And the evil within us?
Incarnation of Satan's creation of all that we dread
When the demons arrive those alive would be better off dead!

There must be something worth living for
There must be something worth trying for
Even some things worth dying for!
And if one man can stand tall
There must be hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

Once there was a time when I believed
Without hesitation
That the power of love and truth could conquer all
In the name of salvation
Tell me what kind of weapon is love when it comes to the fight?
And just how much protection is truth against all Satan's might?

There must be something worth living for
There must be something worth trying for
Even some things worth dying for
And if one man can stand tall
There must be some hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

People loved you, and trusted you, came to you for help

Didn't I warn them this would happen?
Be on your guard, I said, for the Evil One never rests
I said exorcise the devil!
But no, they wouldn't listen, the demons inside them grew and grew
Until Satan gave his signal and destroyed the world we knew!

No Nathaniel, oh no, Nathaniel
No Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the love we used to know
(No) Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the light that we have lost

Now darkness has descended on our land
And all your prayers cannot save us
Like fools we've let the devil take command
Of the souls that God gave us
To the altar of evil like lambs to the slaughter were led
When the demons arrive the survivors will envy the dead!

There must be something worth living for
(No, there is nothing!)
There must be something worth trying for
(I don't believe it's so!)
Even some things worth dying for
If just one man could stand tall
There would be some hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

Forget about goodness and mercy, they're gone!

Didn't I warn them? Pray, I said! Destroy the devil, I said!
They wouldn't listen! I could have saved the world!
But now it's too late, too late!

No Nathaniel, oh no, Nathaniel
No Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the love we used to know
(No) Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the light that we have lost

Dear God!
A cylinder's landed on the house
And we are underneath it, in the pit!

The Martians spent the night making a new machine
It was a squat, metallic spider with huge, articulated claws
But it, too, had a hood in which a Martian sat
I watched it pursuing some people across a field
It caught them nimbly and tossed them into a great metal basket upon its back

Beth! She's dead! Buried under the rubble Why?
Satan! Why did you take one of your own?

There is a curse on Mankind
We may as well be resigned
To let the devil, the devil take the spirit of man

As time passed in our dark and dusty prison
The Parson wrestled endlessly with his doubts
His outcries invited death for us both - and yet, I pitied him",The Spirit of Man,2006

I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.

But nevertheless I'm in love with you
Maybe I'll win, maybe I'll lose
And maybe I'm in for crying the blues
But nevertheless I'm in love with you

Somehow, I know at a glance, the terrible chances I'm taking
Fine at the start, then left with a heart that is breaking

Maybe I'll live a life of regret, 
And maybe I'll give much more than I get
But nevertheless, I'm in love with you

In spite of all I could do
I went ahead falling for you

I made my bed, that's where I'll lie

An airline ticket to romantic places

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings

When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1956
Richie Powell,"When I'm worried and I can't sleep
I count my blessings instead of sheep
And I fall asleep counting my blessings
When my bankroll is getting small
I think of when I had none at all
And I fall asleep counting my blessings

I think about a nursery and I picture curly heads
And one by one I count them as they slumber in their beds
If you're worried and you can't sleep
Just count your blessings instead of sheep
And you'll fall asleep counting your blessings

Richie Ray,"Just yesterday mornin', they let me know you were gone
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
I won't make it any other way
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain now
Na na na. Na na na na na na na na na na. Na na na na na na na na

Richie Ray,"Yo adivino el parpadeo
de las luces que a lo lejos
van marcando mi retorno.

Son las mismas que alumbraron
con sus palidos reflejos
hondas horas de dolor.

Y aunque no quise el regreso
siempre se vuelve
al primer amor.

La vieja calle
donde me cobijo
tuya es su vida
tuyo es su querer.

Bajo el burlon
mirar de las estrellas
que con indiferencia
hoy me ven volver.

Volver
con la frente marchita
las nieves del tiempo
platearon mi sien.

Sentir
que es un soplo la vida
que veinte anos no es nada
que febril la mirada
errante en las sombras
te busca y te nombra.

Vivir
con el alma aferrada
a un dulce recuerdo
que lloro otra vez.

Tengo miedo del encuentro
con el pasado que vuelve
a enfrentarse con mi vida.

Tengo miedo de las noches
que pobladas de recuerdos
encadenen mi sonar.

Pero el viajero que huye
tarde o temprano
detiene su andar.

Y aunque el olvido
que todo destruye
haya matado mi vieja ilusion,

guardo escondida
una esperanza humilde
que es toda la fortuna
de mi corazon.

(I don't care what it did to them the game's been good to me)

Oh, you tink life is yours?
Life ain't no something you can rap with
Ooh come no ordinary game
The game no something you can rap with
Me's a player you know?
I do not, play in no game
Me just, make money, dollars, every time seen?

Now how can I explain how this game laced, plus with this fame
I got enemies do anything to break me, my attitude changed
Got to the point where I was driven, twenty-four seven
Money's my mission, just a nigga trying to make a living
These buster tricks don't want no mail
They spending they riches on skinless bitches
Who'll stay petrified in jail
It's hell, plus all the dealers want a meal ticket
Jealous-ass bitches, player-hating but we still kick it
Always keep my eyes on the prize, watch the police
Seen so much murder, neighborhoods getting no sleep
But still, I get my money on major, continuously
Communicating through my pager, niggas know me
Don't have no homies cause they jealous, I hustle solo
'Cause when I'm broke I got no time for the fellas, listen
Ain't nothing popping 'bout no work nigga, I ain't no joke
Fuck what they say and get your dough nigga
Heavy in the game (Game's been good to me)

Who the bumba clat him a come try take mine?
Oh, me see you rushin' up (Game's been good to me)
I throw I'm blood claat P.M. to A.M.
All, all the bumba come ya take dis ting
For ya take dis ting for joke?
(I don't care what it did to them the game's been good to me)
Oh! Dat's right

Well lemme shoot some of this how heavy type of shit,
Certain niggas wanna stick to the game, yousea trick to the game
Waiting upon your turn, so when will you learn?
Ain't no turns given, niggas be twisting and taking shit
Putting they sack down, then putting they mack down
Me myself I hustle with finesse yes I'm an Oakland baller
Rule number one: check game, and fo' sho' you gon' respect game
Be yo' own nigga meaning buy yo' own dope
'Cause that front shit is punk shit, something I never funked with
Be true to this game and this game will be true to you
That's real shit, disrespect, see what this here do to you
That jacking and robbing, despising your homie
Ain't healthy, niggas be ending up dead 'fore they get wealthy
But not me though, I'm sewing something major
So what I reap is boss, that's why my public status is floss
Went from a, young nigga living residential
To a, young nigga working presidential (Game's been good to me)

Me nigga Tu-pac always look good
You know that's true I'm look good every time
Ooh, pussy war? Step up (Game's been good to me)
Can yi know I'm serving up blood claat
Playing yi fucking games
Ooh, we take game, we won!
(I don't care what it did to them the game's been good to me)
Any by now, all, yi haffa forget fi we won!
Every time

I'm just a young black male, cursed since my birth
Had to turn to crack sales, if worse come to worse
Headed for them packed, jails, or maybe it's a hearse
My only way to stack mail, is out here doing dirt
Made my decisions do or die, been hustling since junior high
No time for asking why, getting high, getting mine
Put away my nine, cause these times call for four-five sales
'Cause life is hell and everybody dies
What about these niggas I despise, them loud talking cowards
Shooting guns into crowds, jeopardizing lives
Shoot em right between them niggas eyes, it's time to realize
Follow the rules or follow them fools that die
Everybody's trying to make the news, niggas confused
Quit trying to be an O.G. and pay your dues
If you choose to apply yourself, go with the grain
And come the riches and the bitches and the fame
Heavy in the game (Game's been good to me)

Boy, ya nah bitch!
Major that's true we look good every time
When we at Beers Diamond
And Tupac drives vintage car (Game's been good to me)
And fi them frame them look good, oh no?
This whole world ya call on
Gonna mass on a face 
(I don't care what it did to them the game's been good to me)
For any, section of bumba ras claat, oh!
Flush it! Oh!
Nobody wan come test me ya know
True them we a drive pretty car
Wanna no part of any ting
And now you wan come drown a gun
But ya see we know, you haffa show I'm maximum respect
For when a blood clat run or when a pussy walk up
We look good every time
'Nough dollars, dollars!
Ya know about dollars Them right?
But we nah talk no shit
We haffa walk de walk for we a talk, see it?
'Cause action, action speak louder dan words
You know the record!
Don't blood claat ting at ALL",Heavy in the Game,1995

My 7-duce, produce, 'cause the zues was pissed off 
I'm still gettin' zips off 
Niggaz feelin' ripped off, an clipped off 
Until they told me, it was Knumskull, Yuk an Dru 
Now what you want to do? 
It's thirty five-hundred for the straight laced triple gold, wit the vogues 
That's what they cost in the store, yeah 
An you can reach, but you can not touch 
Ever figga, scared nigga that you feared too much? 
If you scared go to church, I know it hurts 
To find out, she works for me 
Brought me that Jeep 
That's why I, keep my bitch business in the cut 
That way I gets yo skrilla, plus I get to fuck, 
'Cause we. 

[Chorus]

I'm steadily stackin' up on the green 
Ballas will use the triple beam 
Shot calla use they words 
Hustlas will use they shoulders, playas sit back an get served 
Now observe the definition of the pimp-mode 
I take hoes, an break hoes, an hoes is stayin mobile, really though 
Doe is what I love, so what's up? 
Nigga who you tellin, that life always been tough 
Nigga I had it rough 
An nigga it ain't no bluff 
An potna I had my own mama sufferin', that's sumpthin' 
Yeah okay 
I turned straight into a hustla 
Crap on bustas 
Skrilla fo reala from them suckas 
I gave my mama half, me half, I'm out the door 
Ready to bubble 
I turned into a balla, shot calla 
Two for twamp 
With in a year I'm back on the spot 
Zippas in zipper, I'm ready to hit some fences, it's so wicked 
Bitch you jack rabbit call me Bugsy 
Four-four up in the Paddy wagon, to break my niggaz love me 
An I'll be sure the next time niggaz see me I'll be high 
Do or die, throwin up the 5, in the 5th lane right 
Side, I'm watchin' the rearview juss for po-po's 
I swerve to the curb, about 3 an you know that I straight broke that 
Hoe. 

Fa sho. G-A fo checks 
Pimp bitches fo sex, might as well go all out an pimp the whole block 
Wit 4 techs 
Niggaz on this, on the move in many 
Plenty taken, playa hatin', Caddy's 
That ain't my thang ruger 
It's good to roll skrill that's the best thang 
My S-S-I check came, you gotta be a big mack to do some shit like that, 
An issued this game 
My buddies, who ever can better my Operation Stackola 
Smack, mack, the greenery an crackola 
Homies want to be down rollin' big stacks 
You want to make an effort towards paper, then bitch get crack 
So sick wid it 
That's why I shitted on raps fo luck 
I'm like what ever it takes to make a buck 
Could never be stuck 
I'm facin' a life of brokeness already 
Fuck the pain, it juss make sense fo me to stay on my hustle and game 
Blame no nigga fo my down fall 
But pimpin' is the final frontier, I gets around y'all 
We all.

Nah nah nah, we got to show these motherfuckers whats up though
This is for the honeys, the super ?
I don't want to be her man, I want to be her nigga
You feel me?
Well let em know

You fuckin' wit' niggas that's insecure, watered down, my shit is pure
Write down my number but don't call me til you sure
I ain't beggin' just tryin' to relocate between ya legs
Drippin wet, as we experiment in sweaty sex
When you met me you wouldn't let me, and now
You straight beggin to sex me got you undressin' to test me and uh

Shut me down if ya want, and miss the chance to do it live
When I stroll by, I see that look in yo' eye
You want a nigga, but think that you can't have a nigga
Don't cheat yourself, instead treat yourself
If you scared go to church, I know it hurts
To find out me and your man be sharin' skirts

I hopin' you don't take this the wrong way
But your body is bangin' got me attracted in a strong way
After a long day of tryin' to make my songs pay
Makin' love all day against the wall in the hallway
Ya fantasies come alive, ya heart rate
Shall increase when we meet up in this dark place
You might think you're happy with him
But that's a lie, so give this Thug a try
I'd rather be ya nigga

I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A

Have no intentions of bustin' until you learn ya lesson
Now many questions are often asked, a drop top, 500 Benz
And plenty cash, to help a nigga get the ass

You can ride out the spoke coke, to get your lobster and crab
Cause all I got is conversation and a gang of stab
And I'm a listen when it hurts, I'ma hang out but never stay
Smoke blunts but leave them stunts up to Super Dave
I'll be your nigga, as long as we can understand
That I's the nigga whose spoke coke can be the man
He wine and dine, but me and you we whine and grind
And when I'm on the field keep him on the sidelines

It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a Thug in your life

Now it's time for the moment of truth, I got ya naked
Totally sweatin', let's see how hot I can make it
Tongue kissin' til yo' head swang, I'm so into you
Witness a nigga make the bed bang
If it's all mine, then let me know, now scream my name out
Do you want it fast or shall I hit it slow?
Not to mention, the multiple positions I inflict
A boss playa, freaky motherfucker, can I dick

Uh, it's on and poppin', now you seed what I was seein'
Why yo' eyes rollin', Luke seen ya girl I ain't goin'
Nowhere, let's let that sucker stay out there
While he's stressed out and knock I stretch out the cock
Hold da boots, and let da nigga execute
And though you got it right, I'm goin' home tonight

Pollytaim busta you cracked in half 
Claimed you fooled a bank 
But I know your bank stank 
I lived around the corner 
I've seen you fully smoked 
Must I say some more 
You ain't a buck or four 
You sold your tv for a buck 
'cause it was way to leigh 
And when they send you up state, I heard you gain some weight 
So you're a baller 
Lined on a youngsters quip 
Got to think your sick 
To representing your click 
But you're a old school 
Thinking too much hype 
Yo, buy some timmy on right, it got, *eeehhh* rally strike! 
If they know your identity 
You probably be a victim of a sticky 
You ain't got to lie to kick it

I lash on my enemies for multiple centuries 

Forcin' my adversaries to bleed when they seein' me 

Though east coast born, I'm west coast raised 

Sent so much dick throughout the click that now they Deathrow slaves 

Father forgive me for thug livin', I'm through with this drug dealin' 

I leave with the click and all the niggas that love prison 

Brothas be ballin', bitch if need me, call

Let's duff these niggas and hit they ass with some heat 

Blow they chest up, 'cause they hatin' and segregatin' 

Niggas crossin' lanes, it's time to blow your brains 

Before I shot this nigga, I heard him scream one love (ONE LOVE!) 

Fifteen in the clip, I only used one slug

Hey! Now picture me rollin' 

Biggie Smalls got his eyes swollen 

My hands on my nuts, I gives a fuck, I'ma die holdin' 'em 

Makin' these hoes pause, while schemin' on no drawers' 

No money and ball, down to pussy, dick, and alcohol 

Picture me rollin' (what) corny hoes get they holes dug 

I might show 'em thug passion but I'll never show 'em love 

Can't hit me in combat, relentless when I ride 

Strategize on my enemies, plottin' till they die 

Ask me why I'm high, and my reply ""Till the day I die"" 

Don't want to picture this cold world through sober eyes 

Thugs don't die we multiply 

Connect with the spirits of fallen homies and bustas, then we ride 

surprise niggas when they seen us, they duck down

Puff on it!
9-6 (baby) Richie Rich, Rame Royal, hmm

When I wake up in the morning, first I yoke out
Then I ???? pimp, so I can smoke out
Good green opening up my third eye for sure
As I contemplate on which spot I'd like to go today
Damn, should I CDB again, I feel like loccin
Fallin thru every bomb spot in Oakland
I got the good but I just can't trip
Skyball TWAMP TWAMP for a piece of crip
Danl ???? that's the place to go
And my partner on the corner got the sack for sure
'84, I'm quick to look for booty hook
And if I'm fienin I need to see beamin
Cos, aah, them young brothers smoke the same way I smoke
But now all day I'm comin up short
Uh, I hope the town still love me
For some reason and my deceasing and my zoot's ain't fluffy
I need a pillow

Lay a drop on the pillow (Yeah baby)
And just relax, relax, relax (Cos that was made for you)
Lay a drop on the pillow (yeah baby)
I'll fly free sack (fly free sack), fly free sack
(Cos that was dove for you)

By chance it might seem strange, many nights I dream
Of trees on the range with branches of light green
Women slumbering get tossed like salad with cucumber
But can't stop me from gettin lost on the lands of broccoli
High! I shut em, close my eyes, cough, too much spirit goes
The cloud nine where I'm a lyrical wiz
Magical like Willow wit automatic flowin pillows
Get rolled in a bliz and consumed, that's how Rame Royal is
In my room at the villo, sun shines thru blue blinds
On the window, lettin me know it's time
To go back to reality
Oakland, Cali
And a sack of indo left on the bed
Next to my rizzy's head
Fulfillin wishes, I'm fillin phillies, Vegas and swishes
Wit twenty reefers, sticky weed - minty and delicious
All I need and can axe for, a twamp to crunch
Probably won't want another blunt til lunch

Fell thru Sophia's but didn't see her
Now I'm convinced that it's on when I fall thru this red fence
I shoulda flipped the whole thang when I had the chance
But that done broke my back like a bald bozack
On a late night, I lurk for sure and got a lot of dough
For the first cat with the platinum sacks
And, naw, it ain't a jack, you can hold my scraps
But pull a move and catch a lump to the back behind the scak
Richie Rich might walk a country mile, smilin all the way long
Wit dreams of pullin bongs, writin bomb songs
Buzzin with my cousin at the villo
Stressin off a pillow

Lay a drop on the pillow (yeah baby)
And just relax, (just) relax, relax
(I know, I know, I know the sack was one for you!)
Lay a drop on the pillow (yeah baby)
I'll fly free sack, (fly free sack), fly free sack

Yeah ba-by!
Oooh yeah
Here we are gettin night endeavour
Don't worry cos it's gonna get better

Why do brothers bump they gums and debate on me
Why when I ride by and don't stop
You feel I disrespected your block

If you had a top-notch lezbo, straight from Peanuts
Sexin', tell me would you hit it without protection, uh uh
Let's make it harder, what if she had a friend
Both down for nut huggin, off the Hen, would you spend

Chips, what if I come off the hoe with six-six
Will I get back in the mix, drop some grip, or just quit
What if O.J. verdict was different thing
Would we swing, start lootin' and shootin' with Rodney King

If it was a fifth, would you share it with ya folks
So we could ride out and get smoked
I wonder if I dropped a hundred dollars would you give it back (no)
I wonder if we cool like that (hell no)

[Chorus]

You got three cute flees, one fine, one got a job, one with patience
What would you dick for a long term relation
Money is the thing, fine ones can start hatin
I'm broke so I need one with patience

If I was hella dirty, look like Mr. Furley, 
With lint up in my curly hair
Would you groupie-ass girlies stare
What if I didn't have a car to skee-skirt in
Would you still be flirtin' or would it be curtains

If you got your teeth knocked out, would you re-freak the old ones
Or rush to the dentist for some gold ones
If you had forty dollars, and a hooker wanted thirty
Could we catch you out in Vegas doin' dirty

If you got one gritty and five niggas
Would you speak on the choo-choo shit to make the situation bigger
She'll do it, but now she on some new shit
You gotta go down town, enjoy the fluid

[Chorus]

How many blunts must I take to the face to be straight, forty
If I don't got five on the eighth would you fake or, smoke it
Get loaded or hold it like a buster to get cluster
Should I be rollin' with big hustlers

Would I take one and a heisteses
Want to bubble, but you can't keep up with the prices

And then I ask you, what if I sold a million plus
Should I renegotiate with that nigga Russ

To a, six-seven coupe left wit a luggage rack,

",Yay Deep,1997
Richie Rich,"To all my hustler niggas
To all the muthafuckas out there that's rollin'
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Fuckin' with the birds

Check this out
Bring me back a soda and I don't mean a Sprite
I need the armor hammer so my shit'll bounce right
I was cookin' dope, bringin' back full moons
Fuck till November, I be gone till June
Summer ain't shit if you ain't got the coke
Flipped a drop-top with the all-gold spokes
Oakland gettin' money, nigga, fuck what you heard
Out of town niggas livin' half a bird

What you fuckin' with?
Tell em what you fuckin' with
I'm pushin' birds

Seen my nigga in a Benz and he spin in a ditch
He be movin' things for like thirteen point six
Try to tell his nigga how he hatin' the game
Let's get them driver numbers, eighteen a thing
Want to-be niggas can't tell him shit
Two weeks pass, heard that nigga got hit
Found him in the hills with a dick in his mouth
Stupid muthafucka, game turned him out

Smoked
The nigga got smoked
Violated fuckin' with them birds

Niggas round the world screamin' they want some
Used to get my shit from a straight Columb'
Cracker fucked around and locked the connect down
Now only Mex hold weight in the Town
Dippin' in the thangs feelin' cash for dubs
Now that's the type of shit that get your ass fucked up
I'm spendin' big bread so I need the cream
Cook ten zips, bring back fourteen
Heard em in a drop on the strength of a
Holdin' all that dough but I swear it ain't him
Niggas in the Town gettin' mad at the rich
Learn the game, punk, buy your dope through a bitch

'Cause I ain't fuckin' with you
Snitch nigga, I ain't fuckin' with you
Have your bitch get your birds

I'm puttin' up numbers so I'm changin' the stats
You all know by now, yes, a nigga need gats
All my Israeli with the Gaza chops
Fully automatic, brand new in the box
A funny style nigga but his guns be good
He used to own a liquor store right up in the hood
Smelly muthafucka, sto' filled with nats
Never woulda thought he had the gats
Made his ass a offer at a thousand a bird
With this type of shit I knew his ass'll stay in fur
Either way it go I'm spendin' loot
'Cause niggas got the word that it's birds in the coop

And they stay in there
Nigga, AK's in there
Come and try to get my birds

Two point two thirty-six or a g
Hard or soft, that be I-R-D
Man's best friend, nigga, fuck a dog
Never got to feed him, plus he bought me a hog
My bike worth fifty, Benz worth a hun'
Unrecouped, I do this rap shit for fun
Don't get it twisted, nigga, catch it cause it's real
Had a presidential way 'fore I had a deal

Believe me
I'm born and raised with em
Nigga, I stays with em
Pluckin' feathers off the birds

To all my muthafuckin' cola-rollers
Out of muthafuckin' controllers
Understand me?

Come out and play...

(Woman's Voice)
Playboy...

(Richie Rich laughing)

(Woman's Voice)
Playboy...

(Richie Rich)
Whatchu know about that? Ahhhh...
All bad bitches, lock windows
lock doors
Fake pimps lock hoes
Niggas with diet game too late stole clothes
Real bitches fuck with deez and not those
When I'm at the club and they pop the doze
Nigga keep ya eyes open, watch the hoes
Could it be the walk foo? 
The shoes, or the clothes?
Or maybe they be bound to the game i throw
Its the raspy, genuine, into mine
When I'm on the field keep him on the sideline
That soft shit you spit, it ain't tight
I never known the hoes to bite on game light
'cause it ain't right
To slide through in S Fish
Lauren's a dish and deals with the best bitch
Trick I shoots this
Like Marcus Ray-Boy
I bring it to life 'cause I'm a true playboy nigga...

(Chorus)
Playboy, he's runnin the game straight raw
Playboy, he's givin you much much more
Playboy, he's runnin the game straight raw
Playboy, he's givin you much much more...

(Richie Rich)
I just knocked a euro-bitch in a mazarate
See Rich pimp hoes in tennis shoes and gym clothes
But I'll boot a bitch
Who got ass like she's black
Love to fuck me, Bruce Lee sucky-sucky
Now I run hoes of all nationalities
And when I'm in the zone
Her breasts might be silicone
Might catch me on the stroll with a bad bitch
I'm checkin' loot
Nigga listen to the game I shoot
When I'm out alone
I seem to knock straight hoes
Be on the lo-lo
But niggas screamin dat's they hoe
You come and get this bitch
'cause double-are got more
And what I do
My stable stays stuffed like glew
I put my vocal on it
And call me raspy nigga
9 hoes, fine hoes
Don't even ask me nigga
I ace 'em up
My shoes, my bitches, lace 'em up
It's the real McCoy
A O.G. Playboy foo'

(Chorus)

(Some beat boxing)

(Richie Rich)
Since I'm gonna be
here's a map, for the want to-be's
The game pick up niggas
Stick away quick
Why push 19s, when I could slip on dubs
And check this
Once or twice a day switch fits
Be a heat packer
Safe from the street jackers
I rock ice
The type of cat to hit a block twice
Call up once, sac run up, baby no fronts
Smoke blunts
Only let her hit the light once
Compare
So damn different than a playa
The first one
He be the worst one
Bitches to the left
Me and my cat Hew Hef
Play me
Ya lose the L and pay me in ?? toes
that's the type of shit I tell hoes
Prefer puppies
That drown in the game like guppies
Now they swimmin
Straight lakes, born to chase women
Play it slow
My lifestyle's smoother than Trojan nigga

Some real shit, some real talk
Na, na, whoa, oh, whoa

Ugh, check my watch, check my chain

As I bounce and mash, count this cash
Floss and flash, cop and blow a zip wit Bash

Since everything is big in Texas then where's the zag's?
I'm across the finish line, tell me where's the flags?
Brought my rag top, should have brought the Jag
On the beach me and Beesh, look at all this ass

I could tell you stories but can show you cash
Give you game and secrets that I know you'll pass
To the next playa hater and he'll break like glass
Now I got a bunch of people digging' through my pads

So I choose to floss 'cause who's the boss, let's ink it
It's Richie Rich for those who thought re-think it
Some yell it and tell it, I blow it and smoke it and smell it
Let's spend tokens wit my people who sell it, what?

I can show you better than I can tell ya
I can show you better than I can tell ya

I could bend the block and make it hotter than a Forman grill
I got the keys to the Chevy Caprice
I could show you mother fuckin' snitches straight to Belize

Now that's low, fa sho', conspiracy and parole
I could show you real cats doin' time over a ho
I could show you poor and happy, or rich one's that lose they mind
I could show you dime pieces in school fashion design

I could show you streetlights and heart beak hotels
I could show you young cats gettin' popped wit yayo

Disappointed to the point where I'm runnin' by myself
Never knowin' where I'm goin' start to wonder myself, yeah
Money was a necessity, my greed got the best of me
You think you smokin' Uncle be, who got the recipe?

I'm sayin' it's nothin', I say it sincerely, and speakin' clearly
I'd rather you respect me than fear me
I came a long way and still I got a while to go

So if you hate him for it, boy you fakin' and know it

Puff on it!
9-6 (baby) Richie Rich, Rame Royal, hmm

When I wake up in the morning, first I yoke out
Then I ???? pimp, so I can smoke out
Good green opening up my third eye for sure
As I contemplate on which spot I'd like to go today
Damn, should I CDB again, I feel like loccin
Fallin thru every bomb spot in Oakland
I got the good but I just can't trip
Skyball TWAMP TWAMP for a piece of crip
Danl ???? that's the place to go
And my partner on the corner got the sack for sure
'84, I'm quick to look for booty hook
And if I'm fienin I need to see beamin
Cos, aah, them young brothers smoke the same way I smoke
But now all day I'm comin up short
Uh, I hope the town still love me
For some reason and my deceasing and my zoot's ain't fluffy
I need a pillow

Lay a drop on the pillow (Yeah baby)
And just relax, relax, relax (Cos that was made for you)
Lay a drop on the pillow (yeah baby)
I'll fly free sack (fly free sack), fly free sack
(Cos that was dove for you)

By chance it might seem strange, many nights I dream
Of trees on the range with branches of light green
Women slumbering get tossed like salad with cucumber
But can't stop me from gettin lost on the lands of broccoli
High! I shut em, close my eyes, cough, too much spirit goes
The cloud nine where I'm a lyrical wiz
Magical like Willow wit automatic flowin pillows
Get rolled in a bliz and consumed, that's how Rame Royal is
In my room at the villo, sun shines thru blue blinds
On the window, lettin me know it's time
To go back to reality
Oakland, Cali
And a sack of indo left on the bed
Next to my rizzy's head
Fulfillin wishes, I'm fillin phillies, Vegas and swishes
Wit twenty reefers, sticky weed - minty and delicious
All I need and can axe for, a twamp to crunch
Probably won't want another blunt til lunch

Fell thru Sophia's but didn't see her
Now I'm convinced that it's on when I fall thru this red fence
I shoulda flipped the whole thang when I had the chance
But that done broke my back like a bald bozack
On a late night, I lurk for sure and got a lot of dough
For the first cat with the platinum sacks
And, naw, it ain't a jack, you can hold my scraps
But pull a move and catch a lump to the back behind the scak
Richie Rich might walk a country mile, smilin all the way long
Wit dreams of pullin bongs, writin bomb songs
Buzzin with my cousin at the villo
Stressin off a pillow

Lay a drop on the pillow (yeah baby)
And just relax, (just) relax, relax
(I know, I know, I know the sack was one for you!)
Lay a drop on the pillow (yeah baby)
I'll fly free sack, (fly free sack), fly free sack
(I know this sack was wrong for you)

Yeah ba-by!
Oooh yeah
Here we are gettin night endeavour

Don't exist, but true and plain now he's coming back
And now he's coming quick now you can just close your eyes
And live your live and just run and hide
While you deny under a pile of lies, but it won't
Coincide with the fact that he'll just crack the skies
And catch most guys off guard and just by surprise
So who if not you made the sun and the moon and
How many knew just when he came from the tomb that
What he would do is just rise just for you, then how
Can ya run from the truth when its true man . . .

Rode fiery chargers through the clouds

Now they ride their thunder through the heavens

There's a world in every drop of rain
Embracing oceans sweep us home again
Come along with me, come along with me
Seek the truth, you shall not find another lie

They say for every living thing
There's a guide up in the sky
That helps you pass from world to world
So you never really die

Then with scythe and cloak
Death comes waltzing to your side
As the visions pass you ask
If there was meaning to your life
As you strain to hear the answer, spirits sing, and devils fiddle
As he bends to whisper in your hear, he leaves you one more riddle

Oh, the answer lies beyond the pain
All the questions in our minds, we surely ask in vain
Come along with me, come along with me
Seek the truth, and you shall find another life

And now my life is like a storm
Growing stronger every day
Like the unrelenting wind
That comes to blow our lives away
So I live each day like I know it's my last
If there is no future there must be no past

Now I know the answers never meant a thing
And with each instant that I breathe
I feel the joy that life can bring

Forever winding
Where it leads us I don't know
In it together
For better or worse
Searchin' for our pot of gold

Time leaves a trail of broken hearts
So many arrows just keep missing
Their mark - but baby that ain't us

Nothin' else matters if you're in it for love
Together we can only go higher
We can reach any rainbow that we're
Dreamin' of
Nothin' else matters at all 
When you're in it for love

We'll share in the laughter
We'll share in the tears
In the promises we keep
Life can be crazy

Love can be cruel
But it's always been a two way street
You try to give it all you have to give
So many people don't know how to forgive

Born down by the factories, cross the Jersey City line. 
Raised on radio, just a jukebox kid, 
I was alright.
Just a small town homeboy, with big dreams, 
Following his conscience, in a world full of extremes. 
Fresh outta high school, only seventeen, 
I was alright.
Blinded by my vision, there was just no turning back, 
Like a runaway train, life was steaming down the track.
You'd say I'd never made it out, but I kept on hanging on, 
Every night I prayed to Jesus, and held my head up strong.
I was alright, I landed on my feet, 
Made in America, I was brought up on the street. 
My old man's independence, seemed good enough for me, 
I was made in America, made in America.
Never cared much about politics,'til I was twenty one, 
But I woke up when Lennon, found the wrong end of a gun. 
He left his inspiration, before he said goodbye, 
And we were alright.
We all lose our innocence, it's impossible to hold, 
I didn't know it then, I had a pocket full of gold. 
When I kissed those younger days goodbye, it almost broke my heart, 
I was going through my growing pains, I was driving in the dark.
But I was alright, I landed on my feet, 
Made in America, I was brought up on the street. 
I'm facing up to freedom, and chasing down my dream, 
I was made in America, yeah I was made in America.
Yeah we all lose our innocence, it's impossible to hold, 
I just didn't know it then, I had a pocket full of gold.

Met this little girl, she was off the hook
I got cold chills when her body shook
Hot sex on the platter no need to cook
I let her steal my heart like a horny crook
Had her grinding and winding against my leg
She messin' with my head, wanna play in the bed
Sex with pumps on, toenails red
Your body's a gun baby, pop me full of lead
It hard to hold you when you move the (volter?)
Peace sign on your eyes like John Travolta
A pulp main fiction, its an addiction
To see your booty clap on the floor in the kitchen
Nasty girl, taught me all the lingo
And while mamma play bingo, she ride man dingo
She don't give a damn if I'm married or single
She makes me tingle

'Cause shawty I'm your baby,

Ses she like Hip-Hop and R&B
Her life time goal is to be on TV
She looking for a man that could give her a break
Like Usher or Justin Timberlake
I'm really not sure if her breasts are fake
Put sum whip cream on em, they taste just like cake
We drink some beer, cider, daddy 64
She shot me in the back with cupids arrow
We finish the 6-pac, she push the seat back
Pulled up her dress n she let me peep that
I'm drunk as a skunk, feeling all dirty
Truck stop there threw my 7:30
Bought her some dessert, give a damn if its early
Head spinnin' around like roller derby
Everything about her ses you don't deserve me

Running and laughing, music blasting
Side over the road, bent over crashing
Mouth all dry, can feel the urge
If you see my mama, don't say a word
The cops wanna know I'm a word to (slurd?)
Don't ask me officer ask her
Wanna another drink baby she like sure
Wanna hit the club she like I don't care
She all in the rear view doin' her hair
Hairspray and lip gloss everywhere

Trying to write another chapter in my life
Driving down this lonely highway deep inside
And where I'm going I don't really know
But here I go
Trying hard not to leave too much life behind
Is there something out there that I'm trying to find

I believe in love
Believe in us
But there are days when it's not enough

I'm not gonna change who I am
But I ain't gonna give up the fight
I don't care who's wrong or right
When the push comes to shove
And you tell me you've had enough
You're thinking of giving up on love
I'm still willing to try

Here I go
Step into this spotlight on the stage
Finally realizing that I've come of age
Running my own race down life's lonesome road
So here I go
We only get one life we got to live
Let's hope we find the strength just to forgive.

If you believe in me
Like I believe in us
There ain't no way we're giving up

I'm not gonna change who I am
But I ain't gonna give up the fight
I don't care who's wrong or right
When the push comes to shove
And you tell me you've had enough
You're thinking of giving up on love
I'm willing to try

When you're all alone
Feeling so far from home
Just hold on
'Cause I'm willing to try
When you're crying deep inside
Holding on to your pride
Just hold on cause I'm willing to try

If you believe in love
Believe in us
Gotta find the faith
To never give up

I'm not gonna change who I am
I'm not gonna give up the fight
I don't care who's wrong or right

Your voice in my head
I'm lying here alone
Restless in a faraway bed
The stars are falling down
And I'm a half a world away
I'm just trying to close the distance
To feel each breath that you take
breath

When the bridge is burning and I'm losing my faith
And I'm trying to find my way towards the truth
Like a wild arrow flying and I'm blindly running
From everything I thought I knew
Every road leads home to you, home to you

So you got me to believe
Made me turn on a dime
The writing on the wall
Right in front of me
Every song, every rhyme
But I don't need thousand words
I need you safe in my arms
I'll be standing strong, I'll keep holding on
When life tries tearing us apart

When the bridge is burning and I'm losing my faith
And I'm trying to find my way to the truth
Like a wild arrow flying and I'm blindly running
From everything I thought I knew

No, I ain't regretting just how lost I'm getting
Or the red lights I've been blowing through
My foot will find the pedal as I'm counting the lines
Every road leads home to you
Every road leads home to you
Home,
the road still leads me home to you
Sometimes I don't see the signs, 
The headlights make me blind
The road still leads me home to you

When the bridge is burning and I'm losing my faith
And I'm trying to find my way to the truth
Like a wild arrow flying and I'm blindly running
From everything I thought I knew

No, I ain't regretting
Just how lost I'm getting

The ditch you dig it might just be your destiny
I might just rise above the odds regain my victory
Ay, do right, do right, do right, do right, do right
Do good, do good, do good, do good, do good

The world is a cycle
And everything weh happen, yes it come 'roun' in a circle

So if I see you stumble I'll catch you 'fore you fall
They say the world is round and it's spinning like a ball

Who advise to see let them see
What drop off a head drop pon shoulda
Think about the youths think about them future
Babylon dem caan stop the youths from get wiser

Sweet inna di sky it, ah, go fall inna your eyes
In everything you do rememba to pray
Your prayer a day chase the devil away
In everything you do remember to pray
And let the prayer a day chase the devil away

In everything you do remember to pray
A prayer a day chase the evil

The world is a cycle
And everything weh happen, yes it come 'roun' in a circle

Earth a come, earth a come, earth a forward
As it was in this iration so shall it be in this sign one
Jah is the key still I'm ago master
Whatever you does, does so you shall prosper

The world is a cycle
And everything weh happen, yes it come 'roun' in a circle

Every breath you make

And I dreamed the night
and almost half the day away
I just got up so that
I can hear her say
She's still in love
and no one can take her love away
Ooo love wakes me up everyday
And I thought no one
would ever make me feel this way
It feels me up every time
I hear her say
She's still in love
and no one will take her love away
I wanna be love

And I mean all these words I said
And you don't have to guess
what's going on inside me head
Just try to know
All the things that our heart says
Listen to love and always
get love to lead the way
Whenever you love

You know for love
I'd go anywhere
I would go there
For love to the end of nowhere
And for your love
(And for your love)
I would,
I would
I would love
To just spend all my time
With a girl who makes me
feel her love is mine
Someone you see
Who would only dream of me
And she be in love
just because she wanna be
She wanna be loved

There's nothing better than love
What in the world
could you ever be thinking of
It's better by far
So let yourself reach for that star
And go no matter how far
To the one you love

Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

I'm caught in a cross-fire
from the miles that we spend apart,
The road to our happiness
is the trust in our hearts.
It's hard not to cry sometimes,
when the thoughts run through my mind
It cuts like a knife,
without you in my life.

Refrain
After all the pain we've been through
After all the lies, I'm still in love with you
After all.

I sit all alone here
With a vision of you in my mind
The feelings locked in my heart,
Your key will open up in time.
I think of the love that we shared
When I gaze into your eyes.
Back on track again,
Our destinies collide.

Refrain

If we can't work it out,
Our lives would be through
We're gonna make it right
Just between me and you

Refrain 
",After All,1992
Richrath,"

My heart is left unguarded for you
My mind is lost inside without you
I've seen a million faces
Chased a million dreams
But now that I'm here forever,
What does that mean?

My heart's on fire.

I lie awake all night just thinkin'
How to make this damn thing work through
The good times turned to bad
And all the tears that we shed
But now that I'm here forever,
What does that mean?

Refrain
My heart's on fire
Can it really be you?
You've set my heart on fire
It finally happened to me & you.
My heart's on fire

I never met a woman
Who made me feel like Holly would
She wrapped her arms around me
And made me feel like nobody could
She'd do the things that nobody else would
She'd do the things that nobody else could

I left her arms
in the deep heat of the summer
That decision that I made then
Forever makes me wonder
I'll always love being misunderstood
But still she loves, like nobody else could

CHORUS
Holly would, she'd do the things
that make my heart sing
Holly would, I found heaven with Holly.

My eyes are open,
the woman I love is gone
She left these arms that loved her
and the years have proved me wrong
She'd do the things that nobody else would
She'd do the things that nobody else could

Whoa, whoa, whoa that's the way you do it,
Making money with your charms
Out on the street
You're no good doin' wrong

Refrain
Where were you? Where are you going?
All that you could ever be
You've spent a long time running from me
Clipped your wings 'cause you're flyin' high
Committed murder by suicide
Committed murder by suicide

Whoa, whoa, whoa that's the way you want it
All that fortune with all that fame
Out on the boulevard
Your life's not a game.

Where were you? Where are you going?
All that you could wanna be
You spent a long time running from me
Clipped your wings, 'cause you fly too high
Committed murder by suicide.

Repeat first verse.
Refrain 
",Murder by Suicide,1992
Richrath,"Back when our hearts were young
We danced to a native drum
We'd wait and wait til the midnight coming
I'd hear the window rattle,
and I knew it was time for battle
The boys are here and
we're back in the saddle.

Oh, we made history those nights
We were the outlaws,
that made all wrongs right
But how I missed the mysteries of the night
Oh, where are my outlaws tonight?

We were once the chosen few
But now I know our time is through
All through the years we lost
Our dreams out the window

But now my heart's alive and new
And I've found a new gang, too
We're the cowboys that rise
through the shadows.

Repeat chorus (3)

Oh, we made history those nights
We are the outlaws, and made all wrongs right
But how I miss the mysteries of the night
Oh, where are my outlaws tonight?

CHORUS
Where are my outlaws? (outlaws?)
Where are they? Where are they?
Where are my outlaws, tonight?
 
",Outlaws,1992
Richrath,"The words you said today
I hope it'll go away
Oh Lord, they just can't be true
Even though I'm still in love with you,
Today.
Still in love with you, today.

I never wanted our love to be
A faded, old memory
So baby, where did I do you wrong,
To tear my heart out of this song?
Today...
Still in love with you, today.

Refrain
Looking back at our memories
Shattered dreams is all they'll be
There's nothing left for you to say
So don't go away, today
I'm still in love with you, today.
Still in love with you, today.

Refrain

Our love is here to stay, today...
So don't go away, today.

",Today,1992
Richrath,"You know the truth
It's written on your face
Nothing left to do
You're one step closer
to puttin' me away
I gave you all I have
What a high price to pay.

Chorus:
I'm driving into my own tears
Can't stop what my heart fears
The end is near for you and me
It's a tragedy.

You broke the rules now
then threw 'em all away
I've everything to lose now
We're one step closer
Blood on the tracks
I'm going under
There's no turning back.

Chorus

Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust
There's nothing more left of us
You've dug a hole and buried me
It's a tragedy.

There was a time when
our hearts beat together
Even though we had nothing, we had it all
I thought this love would last forever
But the higher we climb, the harder we fall.

Chorus

Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust
There's nothing more left of us
You've dug a hole and buried me
It's a tragedy.
 
",Tragedy,1992
Richrath," got your call just the other day
You say you're leaving,
You can't live your life this way.
All those rumors,
they just can't be true, no
Even though, I wanna believe in you.

Refrain
In all of my life, I've never loved this way
From the moment we touched,
it must have been heaven-made
I want you back, and I'm here to stay
In your heart is where I pray.

You say you've found another,
but your mind's on me, yeah
Can't escape our paths of destiny
You can run, but you cannot hide, no
You can never change your feelings,
inside.

I come form the West Coast small town south side
Born in OC grew up in 805
Flew the nest and ended up in LA
Still a villain' still chillin' still smokin' on the challis
They're like dogs in this place
Other people pissin' on other people's real estate
It's hard to live here
People are aggressive so people live in fear
With a lock you protect your block pop, pop goes the gloc
Cause everybody else always wants what you got
So stay on top of your game and try to retain
Your own domain
It ain't easy holdin' down the throne
But California is where we call home
Hell yeah we live like kings fuck bling bling
Take a look at all these beautiful things
Every single day the sunshine state
Every single meal avocado on my plate
Every single girl got a beautiful face
Hell yeah I love this place
Kali kings on the beach we sing
Ain't really trippin' on a thing
Can't really be worried
About what tomorrow brings
Kali kings on the beach we sing
Ain't really trippin' on a thing
Can't really be worried
About what tomorrow brings
I come from the coast with the most
A host for parasites up close in tight long summer nights
I ain't talkin' shit I ain't braggin'
My pants are still saggin' and I'm still taggin'
Grew up on the beach so that's where I got slurs in my speech
I got stitches from skatin' ditches
We call 'em hynas not bitches
I'm devout to chillin' out
This lifestyle here is what I'm all about
No matter how we figure it out
Just keepin' real y'all no doubt
Life style so simplistic all y'all must of missed it
Don't understand how we get on the pimp shit
Live it every single day
It's just another sunny day in LA
Come on Cali
Every single day the sunshine state
Every single meal avocado on my plate
Every single girl got a beautiful face
Hell yeah I love this place
Kali kings on the beach we sing
Ain't really trippin' on a thing
Can't really be worried
About what tomorrow brings
Kali kings on the beach we sing
Ain't really trippin' on a thing
Can't really be worried
About what tomorrow brings
Cali love is what I go t
Whether I'm here or whether I'm not
It's the good times sunshine on my mind al the time
Friends like these are hard to find
We're just some cats with some tats
Still misunderstood
Still hangin' out in the neighborhood
It's all good we're just doin' our thing
Kickin' back with Johnny Richter and the Kottonmouth Kings
Now there's a new face gracin' this fat ass track
Swingin' harder than a motherfuckin' baseball bat
I'm comin' strong repin' Cali all day long
See we the kings of California home to bongs and thongs
Now from the 310 to the 714
So many people down to clown when it's time to get raw
Don't try to test the waters we like hungry piranhas
We'll leave you in a state of trauma
Cryin' screamin' for your momma
It's time to stand tall and take a look all around
Remember where you're from I'm from P town
Time to go and chase your childhood dreams
Time to learn to fly so go and spread your wings
Open up your eyes take off your shades and see
You got to aim high you gotta believe
Do what you want be what you want to be
Dreams do come true just take a look at me and see
Kali kings on the beach we sing
Ain't really trippin' on a thing
Can't really be worried
About what tomorrow brings
Kali kings on the beach we sing
Ain't really trippin' on a thing
Can't really be worried
About what tomorrow brings

I could show you poor and happy, or rich one's that lose they mind
I could show you dime pieces in school fashion design

I could show you streetlights and heart beak hotels
I could show you young cats gettin' popped wit yayo

And from the looks of thangs the popo's ain't understandin' me

I think about losing

Can't you tell me why do you hurt me
I guess some people never see
Especially a fool like me

My hands keep shaking

I thought it was you, but my hopes were washed away
I picked up the telephone, it sent a shiver down my spine
I wanted to hear your voice, and talk about old times

Remember the days when we walked
The times that we talked for hours and hours
Remember the way it used to be, just you and me
Remember the days

Think it over what I say
I know it could be just like it used to be
Do you believe it baby, do you share my point of view
You know that I mean it baby, and all you have to do is

What can I do without you, how can I live without you
The day's gonna come, when I'm on the run
So I'm begging you baby please

Do you believe it what the papers say?
They're driving me insane they push me over my limit
Do you believe it they catch me every time?

There ought to be a reason for turning black to white
Sometimes get the feeling that it's done to spite
They don't need a reason to turn your world around

I'm waiting for the bell to ring
I want the children to sing
And I'm waiting for the bad man to fall

Do you believe it, when politicians talk
And make, make the people walk into the fire
Do, you concede, is there no reprieve
From their power game, I know there's someone to blame

We ought to be forgiven for taking in their words
They don't even write them now is that absurd
They don't need a reason to tear your world apart

(Repeat chorus)

And I'm just about done with it all

With it all

And I'm waiting, you know I'm waiting
For the angels to sing for the freedom it brings
For the bad man to fall

I saw my friends and my family
I couldn't believe how they'd changed
They where laughing and crying

It was so good to feel it too

I know just what it means

When you love someone, it feels so right
When you love someone, they hold you tight
When you love someone, it feels so good
When you love someone, it's understood

Are giving life to the love they feel
They count the days expectantly
And they, they know just how it feels
Yeah they do, and they, they know just what it means

They set the wheels in motion Adam and Eve
The beginning of romance
He was a lonely man I do believe
So he thought he'd take a chance

I know just how he was feeling
He'd been advised not to fall
But when his senses were reeling
That man he wanted it all

Honey this is some kinda love
You are my sweet temptation
Honey this is some kinda some kinda love

Like a moth to a flame all you gotta do is call my name
I'll come running to you
I was a lonely man until you came
Life was black life was blue

Without a word being spoken
I saw you then I knew
Now my defences are broken
There's not a thing I can do

Honey this is some kinda love
You are my sweet temptation
Honey this is some kinda some kinda love oh baby
Honey this is some kinda love
We're just one step from heaven
Honey this is some kinda some kinda love

Oh girl there's a fire in my soul
I'm just burning for you
Oh girl I'm out of control
Tell me can you feel it too

I'm burning up I'm burning up
There's a fire in my soul
I'm burning up I'm burning up
For you

Honey this is some kinda love
You are my sweet temptation
Honey this is some kinda some kinda love
Honey this is some kinda love
We're just one step from heaven
Honey this is some kinda some kinda love

The people ask me how,
How I've lived till now.
I tell them I don't know.

I guess they understand
How lonely life has been.
But life began again
The day you took my hand.

And, yes, I know how lonely life can be.
The shadows follow me, and the night won't set me free.
But I don't let the evening get me down
Now that you're around me.

And you love me, too.
Your thoughts are just for me
You set my spirit free.
I'm happy that you do.

The book of life is brief
And once a page is read,
All but love is dead.
That is my belief.

And, yes, I know how loveless life can be.

But I don't let the evening bring me down

A fairground's painted swings

I knew somehow this had to be

The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

The scent of smoldering leaves the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh how the ghost of you clings

Remind me of you

How strange, how sweet, to find you still
These things are dear to me

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Shadows on the hills 
Sketch the trees and the daffodils 
Catch the breeze and the winter chills 
In colors on the snowy linen land.

And how you tried to set them free

Flaming flowers that brightly blaze 
Swirling clouds in violet haze 
Reflect in Vincents eyes of china blue 

Colors changing hue 
Morning fields of amber grain 
Weathered faces lined in pain 
Are soothed beneath the artists loving hand.
 
Now I understand 
What you tried to say, to me 
And how you suffered for your sanity

To tell the story of how great a love can be
The sweet love story that is older than the sea

There'll never be another love, another time
She came into my life and made the living fine
She fills my heart

She fills my heart with very special things
With angels' songs , with wild imaginings
She fills my soul with so much love
That everywhere I go I'm never lonely
With you my love, who could be lonely
I reach for her hand-it's always there

Then let the fire start

If the g's brung' you up then you would have known this
Now witness the coldest

Park them cars in the back cause them hoes know your whip
Identified by what you drive
The streets don't have a face but it has ears and eyes
And sharp muhfukng teeth it will eat your ass alive
Living dangerously high this hustle is a drug this game is a bitch the only one i love

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Rick Braun,"The overplayed disco song
Pumps into the ceiling
Where my poached eggs
Run over my teeth
It's mother's day
I delve into
The almost creature ovary
That's suspended
On my toast
On mother's day

The waitress's mother
Comes in for a kiss
Happy mother's day mama
I'm bathing in diner scenes
And strained caffeine tea
The waitress is a stranger
Who nourishes me
On mother's day",Mother's Day,2003
Rick Braun,"Your smile beams like sunlight on a gull's wing
And the leaves dance and play after you
Take my hand and hold it as you would a flower
Take care with my heart, oh darling, she's made of glass

Your eyes feel like silence resting on me
And the birds cease to sing when you rise
Ride easy your fairy stallion you have mounted
Take care how you fly, my precious, you might fall down

In the pastel skies a sunset I have wandered
With my eyes and ears and heart strained to the full
I know I tasted the essence in the few days
Take care who you love, my precious, he might not know
",Turquoise,2003
Rick Braun,"Back when I was a child
Before life removed all the innocence
My father would lift me high
And dance with my mother and me 
And then
Spin me around 'till I fell asleep
Then up the stairs he would carry me 
And I knew for sure 
I was loved

If I could get another chance
Another walk
Another dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
How I'd love love love 
To dance with my father again

When I and my mother 
Would disagree
To get my way I would run 
From her to him
He'd make me laugh just to comfort me
yeah yeah
Then finally make me do 
Just what my mama said
Later that night when I was asleep
He left a dollar under my sheet
Never dreamed that he 
Would be gone from me

If I could steal one final glance
One final step 
One final dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
Cause I'd love love love to 
Dance with my father again

Sometimes I'd listen outside her door
And I'd hear how mama would cry for him
I'd pray for her even more than me
I'd pray for her even more than me

I know I'm praying for much to much
But could you send her 
The only man she loved
I know you don't do it usually
But Dear Lord
She's dying to dance with my father again

Every night I fall asleep
And this is all I ever dream",Dance With My Father,2004

Got Jimmy Stewart smiling at me
I've got my home baked apple pie
Feels good to be in tonight

And I, I can't wait for Christmas
No I, I can't wait for Christmas

The mood is right and the lights are low
I make my angels in the snow
I've got the star at the top of the tree

The Christmas lights, they shine outside

Rick Carter,"Baby what do you say we just get lost
Leave this one horse town like two rebels without a cause
I've got people in Boston, ain't your daddy still in Des Moines
We can pack tomorrow, tonight let's flip a coin

Heads Carolina, tails California
Somewhere greener, somewhere warmer
Up in the mountains, down by the ocean
Where don't matter long as we're goin'
Somewhere together, I got a quarter
Heads Carolina, tails California

We can load what we own in the back of a U-Haul van
Couple modern day Moses' searchin' for the promised land
We can go four hundred miles before we stop for gas
Hey, we'll drive for a day and then we'll take a look at the map

Heads Carolina, tails California
Somewhere greener, somewhere warmer
Up in the mountains, down by the ocean
Where don't matter long as we're goin'
Somewhere together, I got a quarter
Heads Carolina, tails California

We're gonna get outta here if we gotta ride a greyhound bus
Boy, we're bound to outrun the bad luck that's tailin' us

Heads Carolina, tails California
Somewhere greener, somewhere warmer
Up in the mountains, down by the ocean
Where don't matter long as we're goin'
Somewhere together, I got a quarter
Heads Carolina, tails California","Heads Carolina, Tails California",2002
Rick Carter,"I heard he was gonna marry some girl from Denver
Then my sister came over, had the Sunday paper with her
There was the girl on the social page
Lookin' in love and all engaged
We decided she don't take a very good picture

It may be my family's redneck nature
Rubbin' off, bringin' out unlady-like behavior
It sure ain't Christian to judge a stranger
But I don't like her
She may be an angel who spends all winter
Bringin' the homeless blankets and dinner
A regular Nobel Peace Prize winner
But I really hate her
I'll think of a reason later

I drew horns and blacked out her tooth with a marker
Childish, yes, but she made such a thin little target
I couldn't be happier on my own
But I've got the slightest of a jealous bone
And seein' her with him tends to enlarge it

It may be my family's redneck nature
Rubbin' off, bringin' out unlady-like behavior
It sure ain't Christian to judge a stranger
But I don't like her
She may be an angel who spends all winter
Bringin' the homeless blankets and dinner
A regular Nobel Peace Prize winner
But I really hate her
I'll think of a reason later

Inside her head may lay all the answers
For curin' diseases from baldness to cancer
Salt of the earth and a real good dancer
But I really hate her
I'll think of a reason later

Well, it was just one tooth
Did I mention I don't particularly care for her?
She makes me sick",I'll Think of a Reason Later,2002
