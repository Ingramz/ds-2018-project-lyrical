[Petey Pablo]
It's the dippy dippy don now you heard that
Let's take you back, where the original Tim the bird at?
I got shit here to make you down on twelve-pack

Call Rudy, tell him hook us up a twenty sack
See'mon see'mon see'mon, we ballin why'all
Where my cats think you feel me at?
Alla why'all, and when we earn that

They finally let the dish and the pan
Then I start with some cash
Let me get to Virginia (V-A) link up with Timbaland
Now I'm bustin they ass

Now they callin me The Incredible Man
I'ma shit it sick like YEAHHH
And there is one thing to understand
Why'all know what it is and Petey is just what I am

Spit what I spit cause I don't give a damn
Spin like just like why'all spin at the mall in blue drawers
On some do-rag, it's 'bout to be the all that is
New broad, new day, new cars, new motherfuckin deal

Heyyyyyy

[Chorus: Petey Pablo]
Heyyyyyyyyyy baby bubba
If why'all feel it let me hear you say
Heyyyyyyyyyy baby bubba
We lost the music selector
Heyyyyyyyyyy baby bubba
If why'all feel it let me hear you say
Heyyyeyyyeyyyyy baby bubba
Well he caught me in the van, the gun chat lean fah-ward

[Timbaland]
Check me out in my black Trans-Am dippin on that man, who that be?
TIM-BA-land, now haters want to get at me
Just because we three brothers dippin in the FLY RIDE
He don't care though, nigga we just three FLY GUYS

All up in your local mall pickin all your local broads
HOLLA - if you want to get into a local brawl
We the in-timidators, why'all in-timidated
By our bling bling ring ring, and I can't debate it

LOWRIDERS (bzz bzzt) hittin on switches
As we PASS BY YA (bzz bzzt) in sun fire - see'mon!
What why'all need to do is throw that shit up, shit up
For the cool amigos with Tequila in the gut

What why'all know about them Southern girls with them big butts?
What why'all know about them buckshots bustin from a truck?
Yeah, yeah - that's that Southern hospitality
The come of the me, the come of the Pete
The come of the 'goo, the come of the G

[Chorus]

[Magoo]
Mag spit it 'til I die fucker
You wit your label kissin ass like a damn sucker
Meanwhile, Mag in Virginia in some house shoes, watchin the news
Do my album when I'm ready, tell my label to sue

If I got it I'ma get 'em, it's cornered and sell some (?)
From N-why to floater while I'm humpin your daughter
Stayin in the French quarter and listen to Juvenile
I like that South shit, all my niggaz is wild

You gotta come up with a new plan, I'm sayin man
South boys ain't fuckin playin - check them
This week got OutKast and No Limit, and Eightball
Scarface, Ludacris, and Goodie Mob, UHH

We do it country cause we proud of this shit
All those that want to hate on hip-hop can eat a dick
I ain't a thug and I ain't tryna be
They tryna take my love man and it bothered me

[Chorus: x 2]",Baby Bubba,2001
Petey Pablo,"""Love Me""
(feat. Tweet)

And we're back.. playing the hottest mu-sic on your radio
Coast to coast.. worldwide shore to shore sea to sea
I am your host.. DeBruca
And you're listening to the hottest radio station, in all the land
W-poon-poon-P..

[Tweet]
What a revelation (lation)
You're the reason that I breathe
Innocent creation
I can use you as I please
The only one to tell my story
when words are hard to catch
Of all that comes with fame and glory
You let me rock you best
Ooooohh.. oooh-weeee..
Ooooohh.. oooh-weeee..
Ooooohh.. oooh-weeee..
Ooooo-oooh, ooooo-oooh..

Such a sensation (sation)
Hypnotizin melo-dy
No limitations
I can stroke yo' every key
And you'll give me that do-re-mi-so
And sometimes double-time
And sometimes you'll love me nice and slow
Makes me want to sing this rhyme
Ooooohh.. oooh-weeee..
Ooooohh.. oooh-weeee..
Ooooohh.. oooh-weeee..
Ooooo-oooh, ooooo-oooh..

[Timbaland]
I be creepin' in backyards, dippin in alley ways
My brother in the 360, I'm in a escalade
We piled ride high, sittin' on low pros
Petey in the back of us, with his range rov
Bold ladies sittin' in back, one ridin' in the front
No smokin' in here, so put out your freakin' blunt
This how we gon' do it, so pay attention to the rules
Women in sexy gear, draws down and no shoes
That's why we keep it live, 'cause we keep ours alive
For that alcohol is full of, full of surprise
That's how we're gonna ball, walk before we crawl
This here, this here, is that party why'all

[Chorus]
Roll Out (ROLL!)
Get crunked (ROLL!)
Get your girls (ROLL!)
Get your boys (ROLL!)
Hit the switches (ROLL!)
Bring the noise (ROLL!)

Roll Out (ROLL!}
Get crunked (ROLL!)

[panting noises]

[Petey Pablo]
Roughest, toughest, fastest, one of the baddest
Rappin' asses, tickin' on a Timbaland classic
Layin' in traffic, shiftin gears in the automatic
Tryin' to get past this old couple in a Maverick
Beepin' my horn at 'em, flickin' on my hazards
G. callin' me, on his cell phone laughin'
Thinkin' his chick hang out the sunroof flashin'
I done went in the grass, like to kill a rabbit
Swerve back into traffic, radio blastin'
Slammed on the brakes [SKRUT!], ya old bastard
Tim zig-zaggin', hell, he in the back and
Girls sittin' on the trunk, droppin' wine glasses
Wind blowin' dresses up, showin' off the panties
Polka-dot stripe thongs crammed in they fannies
WHOOP! You could be Ms. Barry, fine as you is
Tim, pull it over, let 'em ride in here

[Chorus]

[Smokey]
Catch me in a chick, and her name is Kim
Tryna tell you who I hit 'cause I ran out of Bim
Fast food so dangerous that I'm crackin' my rim
Like why Taco Bell drive-through so damn slim
I'm out north too, no top on the Benz
Big body, too, just like I walked out the gym
Man, I'm sppeding through, not just feeling the wind
Look, the needle to the gas tank is right at the end
Now, I'm needing to sin, lying again
Pumpin' gas in the Benz, with no money to spend
And every kid that walk in, cashier turning again
So it's a good thing that lady walked in her twins

[Chorus]

[Magoo]
All I do is listen to Eightball, with the hoes on call
High dank in my gas tank and eat raw franks
Grill in my bed and serve 2 steak and siemen
And I'm scheming on your daughter with on condom and Clairborne
Don't get it twisted, I'm gold-toothed and two-fisted
Both arms ready to roll, chrome-wristed
I'm past being beserk, I go to work
Tell the boss ""Go 'head give me some sugars and hot sauce""
With an atrack of Diana Ross playing
And drunk off some moonshine, I passed out and woke up at noontime
Thought it was crack of dawn, but ass was in my face
Said them draws was versache, I thought she had versace

[Chorus]",Roll Out,2001
Petey Pablo,"[Timbaland]
Wha-what what-what-wha-what, wha-what what what-wha-wha-what

Put me with them models, put me in new models YO
Gimme face lifts, manicures you silly hoe
You was bowlegged now you walk pigeon-toed
You came in the front, I kick you out the back do'
I'm a landlord, drug dealers cockroach(?)
Who got the forty-five, I got the crossroads(?)
I'm chillin in Cuba, chillin in the Pocanos
We some down-to-earth fools, who don't act first
We gettin rowdy and we bust them things yo
That's what you get, for messin with us country folk

[Chorus: Petey Pablo]
It's SERIOUS! We came to handle our business
Handle these niggaz, handle these bitches

And we ain't gon' never foul out
[repeat 2X]
It's SERIOUS!

[Magoo]
Put me in that Lex', let her give me head in it
Put me in the room, hit her on the bed in it
Get me on the corner I'ma sell the whole load
Niggaz try to rock when the nine out unload
Unload my world like a St. Louie Ram
Put it down like a Florida at the screen jam(?)
why'all fuckin with the ultimate
Shit in the park punk and now you eatin it
Rip off your shine, take out the hardest line
You (?) me actin funny like a Valentine
You fuckin with wilderbeasts when you come to VA
You niggaz ain't even try I know you niggaz don't spray
UHH - put me on the corner liquor store with whores
A slice of white bread and a Mary Jane warehouse
I know I spit on the track, walk around a pimp fox
One all in my cash, rubbin on my fuckin socks

[Chorus]
[Timbaland]
Timbaland! I'm that man!
Watch that man! Stop that man!
Bitch, don't you dare grin
No favors, you been what I been
I'm a hot tomale no you a hot tomale
Don't give a hell what they say or read about me
I'm a rich man, invest in stock man
I buy land from the (freaky-freaky) white man
I move to Atlanta with Country Grammar
and move to 'bama with nails and hammers
to put the posters on Havannah
Move to China to move through miners
Then move to shirts, drawers, pants, and to the panty-liners
I got them cars, I got them thangs
I got them planes, I got a whole squad entertained
Timbaland, I'm the man
So ladies.. wave ya hands, what!

Killin' one from the top of the stash and I'm feelin buns
Plus I'm do' low at a table, I'm fuckin with this chick,
with a phat body and the ring up in her navel
Dances around, she struts with the ""fuck"" walk
Touches her toes, and she can make her butt talk
Do whatcha gotta do, I ain't mad at 'chu
Know a lot of haters when they seen and as bad as you
You's a real bad girl, a nigga need that
Sippin' on ya Henny, askin' where the weed at

Petey Pablo,"It won't until i was dead broke and about to go crazy 
Half a tank of gas, two cigerattes
scraping up change in an ashtray.
Had a voice said,

It was only..............

    (Verse 1)

Damn,
this song for dat n**** south,
that I was tellin why'all bout.
why'all check dis n**** s*** out
Remember the song i told you came on sound like,
how he was at a point on his own,
and the promblems seem to be takin a toll 
that he been fightin for so long.
Seemed like erthang he did went wrong,
But he found the strength to keep on goin.
And wrote  songs about it later on.
You know that s*** hit me home,
especially when he would talk about the money he owed.
How he took the bills andhe  payed somethin on each one.
Like he put sometin on his light bill,
somethin on his phone.
He'll get a lil money,
and he'd pay a lil mo.
He ain't have a lot so he just payed what he could on it.
And somehow he just managed to keep all this stuff goin.
It won't nothin but the grace of the Lord,
'cause I remember 
I was............

    (Chorus)

It won't until i was dead broke and about to go crazy

    (Verse 2)

So it seemed ertime he got himself off the ground,
somethin'd come and knock him right back down.
Sometimes he wanted to just lay on out for the count,
fustrated and tired,
but he got on up anyhow.
And wit a smile I'm talkin bout.
Make you ask yourself ""How?""
And then 'cause just  broke it down for me he said....

(Singing and Pablo talkin in the background)
I ain't neva been dis happy in my life.
Ain't got a dime more then i had.
But everything seems alright.
And they say he ain't know...
Havin the joy of a piece of mind
is more than any problem i ever had at the time.
And now I know and I'm so glad.

It was only
a sign of the tide.
It was only
askin me why should i cry.
It was only
Singing be glad your alive today.
Only a test of my faith.

    (Pablo)

Man that boy can sing that song.
Play this s*** ermorning,
just ta get my lil day goin.
You just don't know how this had touched my soul to find out i won't da only 
one that been through somethin.
Almost the exact same somethin,
was eatin me up.
Knew what it was, 
just could'nt put it in words.
I ain't neva been the type to really talk to nobody
so all the problems that i had,
I just kept em all inside.
why'all had enough of ya own
 to worry bout,
the lil situation i had goin on.
But you know God won't let you suffer too long.
I ain't even had da radio on,
I was out on the porche,
den Boom.
From the Heavens above,
just when I was at that point,
when I was just about to mess up,
Man Buda played this song fo me 'cause and i just shook my head like 
""uh uh uh""

It was only
a sign of the tide.
It was only
askin me why should i cry.

Time is tickin', with a hole in the hourglass
Startin' guns, been five
And I ain't tryin to come in last
Ain't no need for me to be upset
And ain't no need for you to be mad
If a man got his own pad
And whether he want forty-karat
He gonna have to do that there, prove yourself
The greed words, you had that there
What a dream, he would always had
And it ain't right, but that's the way it is
In this life, you don't get to deal
You can climb to the roulette wheel
I want something I can leave my kids
The memories of what they wish their daddy had did
If I could leave them all a couple of mill
And show em how this cruel world can really get the best of a nigga
I'd show em life through the eyes of a demon
The only thing that matters is the root of all evil

I got a hundred problems and there's only one way I'm gonna solve em
I'm gonna have to get my grind on
Hustlin' and using my muscle tryin to bring the prize home
I ain't the only nigga with issues and I know that
But I ain't concerned with nobody's issues by mine Jack
I invented jail, invited(??) em back
Hell, I'm still in that
The only thing left now is six feet of cold black
Flower bringin' and church singin'
In a grave stiffed up and stankin'
And you can tell that I've been thinkin' can't cha(can't cha)
Now maybe you can understand my anger
And while I'm still out there candy slangin'
And while I'm out there, chasin' them banks
And why I gotta smoke a pound of dank
You never know when your day gonna be your last day
Better get this money when it should've been made (maaade)

[Petey Pablo]
I'm sorry it had to come to this (to this)
I know I'm really disrespecting your family members
That really love to care
It ain't ya'll, cause ya'll know me better than this
I guess it's just the way that I'm is
And maybe I'm a deadbeat kid
Maybe I really don't deserve to live
Maybe they should have gave me life in prison
Only takin' what they give me
Cause out here, I'm stuck in menace
Cause out here, I'm a threat to niggas
I'm like smokin' and pumpin' gas
Light the fire loose to the filter (whew)
You don't feel the vibe we givin'
Cause if you'd did, you'd done been the hell up
You'd done been stickin' ahead of your business
You'd of been, shittin' embarrassed to hit me
You'd of been, sent them boys to get me
Nah ah ah
And I don't repent cause I ain't that nigga
And anything I done, I meant it (you meant it, you meant it)

Petey Pablo,"Now how can one get up off the spot
God damn raise a family get up off the block
Where the city don't love and they don't care
But I will take you there

Now how can one get up off the spot
God damn raise a family get up off the block
Where the city don't love and they don't care
But I will take you there

Tell the sister like blood, little brother a thug
And how to survive the cracks in the middle of the mud
I'm the OG gangsta VL in the truth
Every nigga, in my city know how to tussle and shoot

My lil' homey got killed over a key and a pound
So when I pump, pump blood I'm a hold it down
His sister and his moms when I come around
Showin' love to the family when ya' lose your ground

Wassup lil' man had to write you a rap
Just to let you know this nigga, still got yo' back
Ain't too much change still doin' my shows
Stayin' away from fake niggas, and busta ass hoes

But enough about me and everything in my world
Congrats lil' dad heard you had a lil' girl
If there's anything they need and they ever in a jam
Don't hesitate to ask y'all call ya' Fam

Now how can one get up off the spot
God damn raise a family get up off the block
Where the city don't love and they don't care
But I will take you there

Now how can one get up off the spot
God damn raise a family get up off the block
Where the city don't love and they don't care
But I will take you there

But can you see life roomin' with no crack and pipe
And no weed to smoke no Gs in sight
And no cris to bust no wheels on bikes
And no pussy to fuck nobody to like

But can you see life roomin' with no money and goods
Big money heavy weights with nobody to cook
Nobody to book nobody to look
Tryin' to get back what motherfuckers they took

All you see is that platinum shit
A ghetto nigga, on stage grabbin' his dick
But you don't know what I have seen
From the bitches to the riches, to the triple beams

The project bricks the old school kicks
The early mornin' capers and the late night flicks
But since I moved on things ain't the same
I chose rap you chose the game

Now how can one get up off the spot
God damn raise a family get up off the block
Where the city don't love and they don't care
But I will take you there

Now how can one get up off the spot
God damn raise a family get up off the block
Where the city don't love and they don't care
But I will take you there

See your mom still strugglin' you up in the pen
But mom just wonderin when the end gon end
When the guns gon stop from spinnin' the bin
Or when the hood gon block the dope in the pen

Or when the light shot out you up in the park
The white trunk out your homey got marked
Or every nigga, that talk or rat in his heart
Or every nigga, that talk should die in the dark

I never forgot you and what we did
And how we came up and where we lived
I'm seven forever turn coke to never
Hard head 'til I'm dead until I'm 'bout my cheddar

Gotta get my ends wanna push a Benz
Eat steak live great and raise my twins
I can't believe I'm talkin' to ya' now that ya' gone
I luv ya' bruh and this is my song

Now how can one get up off the spot
God damn raise a family get up off the block
Where the city don't love and they don't care
But I will take you there

Now how can one get up off the spot
God damn raise a family get up off the block
Where the city don't love and they don't care
But I will take you there

Good and thick and what you give her she'll work wit' it (she'll work wit' it)
Pretty face and some cute lips
Earing in her tongue and she know what to do with it (know what to do wit' it)
Made a name for herself and she do her shit well and know how
to keep her business to herself
Come over anytime nigga call check
1 o'clock, 2 o'clock  (ding dong) and she right there
And she know why she came here
And she know where clothes suppose to be (off and over there)
Sniff a lil' coke, take a lil' x, smoke a lil' weed, drink a lil' bit
I need a girl I could freak wit' (freak wit')
And want to try shit and ain't scared of a big dick (big dick)
And love to get get her pussy licked by another bitch

I love when do that girl
Til it come time for me to give her hers
Tell me what you want
Do want it missonary with your feet cramed to the head board
Do want it from the back with your face

Do you want it on the floor, do want it in the chair

Do you want it in your pussy, do you want it in your ass

Y'all ready ..
Y'all ready ..
Y'all ready ..

[Verse 1 - Petey Pablo]
One of the illest rhymers that ever came outta Carolina, put this whole shit
On the map
Went back got two states, y'all crammed way to the back
And brought 'em up to the where the rest of 'em at (cause I can do that)
Granddaddy was real strong, daddy was in the Army
I was a bad motherfucker, slightly retarded
Mentally institutionalized, since the '85
Buildin tree houses (that the wind couldn't blow down)
Look at me now, holdin it down
Doin it well, I ain't triple platinum yet (but ain't gon' worry 'bout it)
I'm wearin the good damn crown, man I'm the president
And reppin both states (back here in Carolina)
Where the hell did you find 'em? (boy is an animal)
His flow is incredible, style is bananas
I just wanna go to the Grammy's and I don't care if I win
Just to say I've been god dammit (god dammit)

[Chorus - Petey Pablo - 2X]
Get on dis motorcycle
Get on dis motorcycle
And that way you can ride wit a ... (y'all ready)

Get on dis motorcycle
Get on dis motorcycle
And get your hips on in the big ass truck (y'all ready)

[motorcycle engine]

[Verse 2 - Petey Pablo]
On the hurl and dirt road, them big ass pot holes
Lay in a - old home, lay in a - screen doors
Car in the back yard, dog chain tied up
Ain't drove it in years, sittin on nothin
Spit crunk mosquito buckets, hot wood heaters
Hooked up Honda Accord, with house speakers
Bag, phone and beeper, corduroys and sneakers
Pit Spike Lee's and them shell toe Adidas
You don't know shit 'bout Petey (Petey)
Real definition of the greasy, grimy and gritty
You really fittin to sellin drugs for another nigga
Always lookin at me like your trigger finger itchin
I give ya my best witness, when you come to handle your business
You better be ready to get it, cause I don't be bullshittin
I'm up into plastic bottles cause if I keep on feelin the way I'm feelin
I'ma blow up in this motherfucker

[Chorus - 2X - w/ ad libs]

[Verse 3 - Bubba Sparxxx]
Twenty-seven dollars to my name, headed up
85 pissy drunk, Petey still made me drive
Left off from LaGrange, passin through Squattenburg
On the way to High Point and my speech startin to slur
Better tell these sons of bitches, boy to move won't allow for me
To stop and say I'm sorry to this dude and this scout
It was just a little bump, shit you dented my Ferrari
Don't call the law, shit is rented, look I'm sorry
All we have done in the name of the south
Gave these ugly motherfuckers somethin to ""Raise Up"" about
But I'm still unfulfilled, since my daddy still drivin
That fuckin school bus, know that Bubba still strivin
I want me a label, want me a mansion
Timmy can't give it to me, Jimmy ain't spit it to me
Rest assure though, the day is approachin
When these old country boys ain't just playin, they coachin

[Petey Pablo - talking]
Get on dis motorcycle ..
Y'all ready, get on dis motorcycle

Get on dis motorcycle ..
Y'all ready

When He spoke to me
(So sweet, so sweet, yeah)

Sound of His voice
(So sweet, so sweet)
Send that chill in my body
(So sweet, so sweet)
And I was lifted
(So sweet, so sweet)

I tried to deny the ways I was feeling
'Cause the world had me all messed up
Controlling my decisions
Had me at the point where I hated who I was
Something had a hold on me and wouldn't budge at all

I felt myself sinking until this all
Now all I could say was help me, Lord
And by God it hurted, I know it hurt because

When He spoke to me

(Shh, wait a minute)
Just when I thought it was over
(Shh, wait a minute)
And I was 'bout to go into town

My heart was heavy with a bird
Left being a bird in the world and not being able to fly
My heart was heavy
And if you don't know what I'm talking about
You must be crazy

You need to stand up, stand up
Stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up
Good is God been enough
You better stand up, stand up
Stand up, stand up

I just wanna say thank You for everything
Thank You for everything, thank You for everything
Thank You for everything
Every little thing, for every little thing

I just wanna say thank You, thank You
Thank You, thank You, everything You've done for me
Everything, everything, thank You, thank You

I wanna say thank You, thank You

Petey Pablo,"(Chorus)
I swear, I would lock the door if the cops came and tell em you gone
I swear, I would rest in eternal sleep if they would let you live a little bit more
I swear, I'd give em my right arm, if they would just leave yo alone
Tell the truth, how much do I love ya
Tell the truth, more than you'll ever know

(Verse 1)
I'd tell you I'm tired of it, but nigga I will always be wit ya
Through hell or hot water it'll be me and you nigga
This can go down in the test of time
whether Ripley believe it or not, make it happen once in a lifetime
Kinda hard to find, two niggaz that growed up on two different sides of town
That get down like I get down, and done his like I done mines
Hit it off first time around, and been solid as the foundation under the house
This some, shit for us to brag about (bout it bout it)
We answered the question and never had to take the time to thank out
That's why I'll ride for my nigga, cry for my nigga
Die for my nigga
Hold ya one hand in the sky for ya nigga
Tell them you gone always remember

(Chorus)

(Verse 2)
you know you one of the reasons I'm still breathin cause without you I don't know where in the hell I'd be
(homeboy)
You know life's been hard at home (homeboy)
That's what made us turn to the streets (homeboy)
I think that's what had us claimin thugs, sellin drugs
Duckin from the fuckin police, indulgin in
Boughshe women, foolish niggaz
Young, dumb, and off the leash
Outta control, but I wouldn't change it
If I could I would do it the same (if I can do it)
But if it wasn't for the game, teachin us game
We prolly would be stuck with the lames (but DAWG)
Somehow we made it, and I'm glad that I can tell ya today
That my nigga gone always be my nigga
'cause that's the way it's ‘pose to be

(Chorus)

(Bridge)
Sometimes I want to play some ball, Sometimes I want to walk through the mall
(Sometimes I want to play some ball, and just walk through the mall)
Sometimes it ain't about the broads, and I just want to spend some time alone
(Sometimes it ain't about the broads, and I just want to spend some time alone wit my niggaz)
Sometimes I want to hop in the car, and drive till tomorrow
(Sometimes I want to hop in the car, and just drive till tomorrow)
Sometimes I want to pick the phone, just to see what's goin on
(Sometimes I gotta pick up the phone, just to see what's goin on wit my niggaz)

I got my homeboy Bryan in the house tonight
We gone represent, Carolina we back baby
Holla atcha boy

[Verse 1]
We came to fill the gap in the game
The helicopter man took and bought him a plane
Now I guess I'm just gone have to pick me a name
To place cross the face of my new runway
International roller, while y'all still ridin round local
Crusin through in somethin' chopped off at the roof
Tearin up my baby doll new hair-do
Candy painted sittin on some brand new shoes
ain't studying nothin' lesser than them 22's
Actin a fool, by the hip-hop and the music
Doin tricks, hittin switches like (uh uh uh)
All us sittin on dubs, and all our guls cut 'cause
y'all broke, and can't get shit from us
Besides a motherfuckin dick to suck (C'mon)

Awww Shit, gotdamn, get off yo ass and jam

[Verse 2]
Carolina nigga got the game on lock
You can tell a pimp nigga when you see his car
Still tickin passin him with two bad hoes
Window rolled down so his curls can blow
That boy from the west coast, naw I don't thank so
I thank he from down south, where they get low
(To the windowwwwwwwwww!) dual pipes and vogues
Sippin gin, head in the wind, you seen it before
You know how we roll, cars both sides of the road
Like a motherfuckin pimp nigga, watch me hoe
Cut that shit down, what he talking bout
He just mad 'cause, his girlfriend turned out
Look at that bitch in that truck, bouncin that butt
(Look at that bitch in that truck, bouncin that butt)  

[Chorus]

Aight, now what we do right now, we gone go back
Way back, c'mon c'mon

Yo momma, yo daddy, yo greasy greasy grandmammy
These girls scandalous, got holes in they panties
Got big behinds like Frankenstein
Breathe smeel just as shitty 
And meatballs on they titty
And scrambled eggs down 'tween they legs
ain't yo girlfriend pretty

YEEAAAAH! This is another Lil'Jon production

[Petey Pablo: Talking]
Ladies and gentlemen, I am proud to present to you today
The new album from Petey Pablo, ""Still Writing in My Diary: The 2nd Entry""
The boy hot now; he been gone for a little while, had a little vacation, enjoyin' life
But that's what you're supposed to do when you get there: enjoy your life
why'naw'mean, 'cause this ain't promised to us tomorrow, we can lose this shit tonight
Ya understand what I'm sayin'
but this young man that I'm bringin' before you today, has done it all
He's been at the lowest of the low, he's been at the top of the world
And he still remains grounded, that's a trill nigga, street cat
A fine young man, and I'm very proud to
be able to say that I even know the young fellow
But without further ado, because I know you've been waitin'
Still writin' in his diary, the 2nd entry

My mama said, ""Can you give her 3 dollars for a 5 dollar book of food stamps
so she can get her some cigarettes?"" (laughs)

Ya see, I go through some shit called voice exercisin'
When I go in the booth, and I go in there
and I just lay a hook now 'n then, know what I'm sayin'
Like this shit right here

[Chorus: Repeat 2x]
Time to take them shirts off again (put 'em back up in the air)
Represent, represent (put 'em back up in the air)
I really need you to mean it, mean it, mean it (put 'em back up in the air)
Start up that South shit again (put 'em back up in the air)

[Petey Pablo]
What you want this time, more fire?
Your problem, I got it (I got it)
y'all better be ready to call the motherfuckin' firetruck
to come up in this bitch an' put me out (yeah, yeah)
Petey Pab, back in the house, puttin' it down (I brought this fire, baby)
Stronger than we've ever been baby boy
y'all in trouble now (now now now now now now)
If y'all ain't ready (ready), better find your door
it's time to go and y'all gotta get out
All up in the wheels and under your heels
and let the best thing to roll you out
If you been there, I ain't got to talk to you about it
It don't get more gangsta, gangsta than it gets in this South

[Chorus: Repeat 2x]

[Petey Pablo]
Got another rake, got another lawn mower, got another hoe
A brand new weed wacker, with diamonds on the top where you hold
Got a water hose, anything you want it up on
Carolina (?) painted float to go with my post
I be out there in that water 'round them rich white folks
And caught me fishin', but guess what, dog, I look good in that boat
I'm just as country as the day I was born, I love it
Change my name for me (Mmmmmm mmmmmm P-P-Petey Pablo, ?)
Bob your head, get your thang off, show yourself
Look around ya boy, if that ain't there the South at its best
We run this shit here, all this shit here, nigga, look at me man
Your Jack ain't why you should be worried, it's the Ace in my hand

[Chorus: Repeat 2x]

[Petey Pablo]
I'm sellin this song out to everybody that took the time when I ain't got my shit
Record store, bootleg, under hung and everywhere that my CD is at
I take my hat off, if it weren't for y'all, I wouldn't be nothin' at all
And Carolina would still be two states, y'all motherfuckers used this to drive across
Do you see anything on my goddamn face that look like I'm playin'?
Have I said anything tonight, that y'all motherfuckin' niggaz ain't understand?
That I leave when I had a reason, talk to me man!
Naw I stayed, 'cause this where I was born and raised
(And I) I swear on everything I love
I'ma do my best to keep doin' it for us
And I don't need a gold on a black to black
just some down at home country love (country love)
I don't ask for much (huuuuuh huuuuhhh)
that's enough to keep my heart in the court (huuuuuh huuuuhhh)
Tell the truth, it's really messin' me up
to see all y'all niggaz still raisin' up (ooooooooooh)

Petey Pablo,"Who rang my phone?
That boy gon be a singer one day fo real
Naw, man get serious for a minute
I said and I said and I said
'cause he told me, 'cause he told me, 'cause he told me

Why should I worry about what people say?
When they gon talk about me anyway
They gon make up all sort of thangs
I just got to be the bigger man and let it roll off

The talk don't bother me
I believe in me if nobody else does
And let it roll off just like the one
And only feather of a dove's back, yeah, I said

You know it probably wouldn't worry me so much
If I was out there and behind closed doors
I was what they call caught up
Stealin' donkin' and drugs, livin' reckless
And takin' advantage of all I worked so damn hard for

Really needed help, but afraid to ask
Lonely, depressed, or just needed someone else
On the verge of givin' up, paranoid, scared
Totally overlookin' how much I been blessed

How could you understand what you say they said
And most of all why they said it, and I just nod my head
When you wrong you're wrong, I?ll admit it
I?ll confess to anything if I did it

But to spread unnecessary lies, I don't get it
How could you find enjoyment in my business?
You know what, forget it, talk my nigga
If you wasn't talkin' about me, I probably miss ya

Why should I worry about what people say?
When they gon talk about me anyway
They gon make up all sort of thangs
I just got to be the bigger man and let it roll off

The talk don't bother me
I believe in me if nobody else does
And let it roll off just like the one
And only feather of a dove's back, yeah, I said

Petey doin' this, Petey doin' that
I seen Petey here, but what he doin' there?
Why you don't come and ask, it ain't gon make me mad
I respect that more than you doin' it like you have

Botherin' my family scarin' them to death
Why you talking to them about me
When you can talk to me yourself
I might blast back, lose it and tear into your ass
Or I could be a man about it and talk and clear the air

But you don't never know that 'cause you won't take the chance
What that mean? You missin' somethin' in the crotch of your pants
He can make me laugh, 'cause sometime the story can be so outrageous
Can't say nothing but damn you know what I really am?

Beyond that her momma told me somethin' one day
And I ain't forgot it if they scared to my lie
To my Heavenly Father?s precious name
Then who am I to complain?

Why should I worry about what people say?
When they gon talk about me anyway
They gon make up all sort of thangs
I just got to be the bigger man and let it roll off

The talk don't bother me
I believe in me if nobody else does

But that shit you don't talk that huh?
That shit shocked everybody

Put the money in the bag bitch before I blow yo head off
Get yo ass on the floor nigga think a motherfucka playin' with y'all
This right here came from Mr. Charles its long and it ain't got Sears on it
Anytime I got a personal problem this the only homeboy I call

I wonder how many thought about Petey Pab
When I was apache rappin' in the penetentury yard
Eatin' wieners outa chanteens
Smokin' on roll-ups, strokin' on my love meat

Waitin' for the day cut in the term and free
So I could get out here and make mama proud of me
And do the right thing run up on the right man
That can pull the right string get to where I'm posed to be

Had to get ejected cause the game a cold
Anywhere and when the motherfucka slammed the door
Oh no, hell naw, get lost wait a minute dog
Fucked around one night went out in New York

When I met one of the brothers ""Up-in-ala-boys""
Ever since then money been a real long head
That bout says it all

Put the money in the bag bitch before I blow yo head off
Get yo ass on the floor nigga think a motherfucka playin' with y'all
This right here came from Mr. Charles its long and it ain't got Sears on it
Anytime I got a personal problem this the only homeboy I call

Is just something that a carry with me all the time
Just in case one of these motherfuckers loose they mind
And run up on me like I ain't gone hold it down for mine
I can show you better than tryin' to tell ya 'bout it

See once upon a time I think Pitt was the county
Where these niggas used to run around armed and robbin'
There was this little boy by the name of Moses
Had to run home keep from gettin' me jewelry stolen

Till one day nigga caught a hold to him
Did what they wanted to em stole my little Gucci coat
Oh naw , shit yeah they did, what the fuck you think I did?
Told Grama, granny told Granpa

Granpa took his grandson in the backyard
Gave me somethin' supposed to take the pressure off
Instead he teach me how to shoot at the mouth

Put the money in the bag bitch before I blow yo head off
Get yo ass on the floor nigga think a motherfucka playin' with y'all
This right here came from Mr. Charles its long and it ain't got Sears on it
Anytime I got a personal problem this the only homeboy I call

They ain't certified till a nigga run in they house
Put the thang in they mouth and blow err thing they think out
Run around actin' like bitches, you gone make me loose it all
I wasn't gone talk about it but, God damn it

This motherfucker bout to piss me off
And this dick ridin radio station ass motherfuckin'
Nigga down here in Raleigh

And the couple of spins that y'all son-bitches

Come on the motherfuckin road with us
If I said anything I ain't spossed to said
And hurt anyone of y'all them fuck it

Round here we gangstered out, this ain't no titty bar 
We let it all hang out

Crawl up behind her and cram all of it in her
Ride her ass like a bicycle, hold right there

Just as show as yo ass is fat, there's some 26 inch rims on a Cadillac
Like spinners, sittin on a sixty-seven
At the car show bumpin Funk Master Flex

Get the hell up outta here, leave me alone

You looking at a kid that ain't scead to dirty
This little knotty head nigga been thirsty
Just enough sugar fo, for one cup of cool-aid
I've been all the way, I mean all the all the way down
But looking at this nigga now I never could've told it
And I don't blame 50 Cent dawg turned the game around

Look at here, there he is, flyin out the side door
Time to rock & roll, bought a bag of dominoes
Bet it up, set it up (uh ha ha, what be at the time)
North Carolina, ba-ba-back out on the road
Used to push 22's now I'm on them 24's
A lot of shit done changed, since a Range Rover
Couldn't turn them burgers over, cause the flame got too high on him
Made it a little slower for folks in them paddle boats
I might have a little motor but mines been worked on
Carefully took them two preachers and let em prayed on
Told me I can do anything that I put my name on

[Verse 3]
Every breath that I take, move that I make
Song that I sang, been fo these states
The eyes in my face, hold so much pain
And seen so much hate, I'm shamed to even say it
But thangs they done changed through GOD and his grace
My folks and they faith, these hearts that don't break
The dirt roads they laid, have just been paved
By state my claim, and stand my name
Cross the top of the tallest wall up
Rock for my prison niggas 'cause I done been crossed up
Locked up, 'cause I made a wrong turn ,but guess what
I took it as a lesson learned

Petey Pablo,"I come, they go, I run, they slow
I ain't ashamed that I did what I did
I just live how I live, you don't like it, say so
Ain't a singer on my payroll

I'm platinum, they're probably that gold
Buckhead bouncing, move a little ounces
Talking out loud, but I ain't low
Wait for the day that Bubba can't blow

And get them fo?sho, bitch can't blow
S.V. style, you know what I'm talking about
Mo?fucking bank account, you say Os
These hoes better stay on their toes

The big play threat, I just may go
87 yards in the blink of an eye
It really don't matter what you think of the guy
'cause I'm eager to try this style, and that style

And stack piles of cash, while sayin' something
Dudes agile, hear that? Wow, a bad child that turned good
Now, I've earned good, but I've burned better
That cush, please just sush, wuss, I'm the team captain
Get your first letter, bitch
(Pussy)

You thinking, you dead, boy?
Know where I'm at, boy?
I'm on the other side of the room, your lady feel frisky
Tell her come get me, I'm on the other side of the room

If you came to party, let's go get it started
I'm on the other side on the room
Whether you with me or you're against me
I'm on the other side of the room

I remember when we used to carry them things
Back in the days
Hot as a flame and I'm setting through the blaze
Homey, full of hate

Dollar bill full of cane
It?s the mister motherfucker with a hundred different names
Ain't fuck with nobody
Can't roll no problem, diamond

Never could quite understand a man that never talked how to
Stay to himself, quiet as kept
With a coldness in his eyes that will scare you to death
I was on my way, man I had one foot in the grave

Motherfucker, I stayed contemplating about my last and final day
I'm supposed to be nothing, they were supposed to give me life in prison
Last pick, misfit, probably did a full twenty, hey, I'm right here, head up
Got the whole world shaking for me, I said

You thinking, you dead, boy?
Know where I'm at, boy?
I'm on the other side of the room, your lady feel frisky
Tell her come get me, I'm on the other side of the room

If you came to party, let's go get it started
I'm on the other side on the room
Whether you with me or you're against me
I'm on the other side of the room

Maybe death and taxes ain't the only thing certain
To come unnerved from out behind the closed curtain, bubba skirting
What's the word? You must have heard a lot of BS was asserted
Since none of us is perfect, wonder who it was unnerving

Not me, not you, grin and bear it? Got to
If they ain't worried about you, then they ain't worried about you
Hear, hear, get it clear, disappear from out my hemisphere
If indeed you've got some business here, then state it crystal clear

All this fake innuendo from little minnows
Is gonna make the big goldfish unload on the fish hole
Fuck Cane and Nate, baby tell me that it is so
I?d rather watch my momma get low than quit this, fo? sho, yo

You thinking, you dead, boy?
Know where I'm at, boy?
I'm on the other side of the room, your lady feel frisky
Tell her come get me, I'm on the other side of the room

If you came to party, let's go get it started
I'm on the other side on the room
Whether you with me or you're against me
I'm on the other side of the room

Hit him in the part where he talk from

Unlike these other hoes in ya crew you don't jock me
I'd like to get ya phone number just to see what you about
Call you for breakfast to get you out
And see if you just some eyes without a face
Let me see ya crib - take me to ya place
I wanna show you that it's mo'to me then fuckin on my mind
'cause in yo mind I bet you fuckin all the time
Come to find you only out tryin to go to school
And tryna go to school and pay bills is hard to do
I see you fool so go on and do ya thing
But when you tired of showin ya titties give me a ring
I like a woman gettin hers cause that's better
Then her tryna come up off mine I can't let her

Go on and let a nigga peak, go on and let a nigga poke
Give me some assistance as I manuver my long stroke
I hope you don't think I'm payin'for it that's the wrong hope
'Cause I know you wanna be Z'Rollin over chrome spokes
Bitch I know you wanna tell ya girlfriends how it was
To get hit from the back, in the back of the 'Lac by a thug
And to get ran through until you get carpet burns off the rug
And to get nutted on by nine niggaz with diamond grills and guns
And how you got on my microphone and sung a sixteen
Ya performance deserves a grammy check out my big screen
Most bitches don't know but you know what suckin a dick mean
Yeah the head was fed but what up with that in them jeans
I can see the pussy (?)lookin like a big bee
Make ya cycle start early my shovel be diggin deep
I don't wanna relationship, I just want me some relations
Go on and let a nigga poke hoe, and stop shuckin with my patience

Then bring it back to daddy that's how you can get this dick

And we can blow dro in the Benz while I smash on the gas

All my warriors is lovin my rep
How I took it to the world from the project steps
Playin touch with my broad like my children
And it ain't like back in the days when we ducked behind buildings

Especially if she poor and she need to be gettin no bullshittin

I pull up on a hot block and come and get ya
Wit' a pistol cocked to handle all issues

After all we stood for, you would start snitchin'

Cause trust is just something you just don't get involved

Tout le monde me dit, ""tu sais pour ton avenir on a peur
On voudrait que tu sois un médecin, toi tu veux être un rappeur""

Ma meuf m'a dit, ""tu m'aimes pas assez, on dirait que tu t'es lassé
Qu'est ce qui s'est passé?
T'as plus le même regard quand t'as fini de m'embrasser""
Je m'endors avec mes coups de blues
Plus personne ne croit au coup d'foudre
La voisine est venue me voir pour me dire qu'elle en avait marre de mes
Engueulades avec ma mère, à chaque fois c'est pareil quand je m'énerve
Je tape dans la porte et je casse mes affaires
Puis je m'endors et quand je me réveille je regrette (ah, ah, ah)
Tout le monde me parle
Tout le monde croit savoir ce que je dois faire de ma vie
Ce qu'il y a dans ma tête

Mais j'n'écoute que moi et je me répète que 

C'est pas grave
Ce soir tu danses
La nuit porte conseil
Faut pas que t'y penses

Ça ira mieux demain
Ça ira mieux demain (demain, demain, demain, demain, demain)
Ça ira mieux demain (demain, demain, demain, demain, demain)

""T'es comme les autres en fait, tu m'apportes que des problèmes
Allez sors de ma vie
T'façon je le pensais pas, quand je te disais, 'je t'aime'""

On nous répète qu'avant c'était mieux
On croit en l'amour qu'une semaine sur deux
Le temps passe vite, on est des jeunes vieux
Hier un petit m'a appelé Monsieur
Par la fenêtre j'attends un signe
J'pense à mon avenir qui doucement se dessine
En attendant je me remets ce vieux son de Biggie
Celui qui fait, ""it was all a dream""
Un seul sourire, et mille pleurs, on attend la surprise comme les Kinders
Pour éviter de dire, ""les enfants j'ai rencontré maman sur Tinder""
Toutes les questions sans réponses se baladent dans ma tête
La main sur le cœur, des fois j'ai trop peur qu'il s'arrête
Mais j'n'écoute que moi et je me répète que

Know I'm just nigga rich

Blame myself, I had no control

Leave my body, soul go afloat
On a roll that never ends

Getting high, I feel low

But only foolishness to them that don't believe
They may say that I'm a fool for the cross that I proclaim
But the gold that I must seek won't be found in earthly things
When the crowns of gold are laid before His feet

The hunger pains drive them to the street 
Wond'ring if today they'll eat

Some find it harder just to live when they can die with ease.

The least of these is sick.

You used to play their games
You used to stay the same
They used to hold you back
They knew the best attack
They thought they had a better hold on you
They thought that you would always stay true blue
They couldn't stop you - they had no defense
You went under the wire - you went over the fence

Defector - you broke the chains away
Defector - a higher power you obey
Now they have no hold on you - you've broken through
But don't forget to read the signs 'cause
You still live behind - enemy lines

They used to drag you down
They used to have you bound
Just like a ball and chain
But they could not restrain
They thought that you could never break away
They thought that you would always go their way
They had you tied up habitually
They never figured you could ever get free

You got away clean but it don't come free
Another man paid with His on agony for...

Where are the amber waves of grain
When one of our homeless native sons has hunger pain
Under the overpass they build a fire for heat
They can't remember when they had a meal to eat

Some sleep in doorways waiting for the day
Some sleep in boxes we have thrown away

Under the red, white and blue
Right down the street in our view
We're not doing all we can do
To shelter the homeless few
Shelter the homeless few

Standing in line for soup and bread
Hoping tonight the downtown mission has a bed
Dreaming about the home they thought they'd never lose
Sleeping on benches covered by the daily news

People who pass them by just turn their heads
Making them feel like they've been left for dead

Under the red, white and blue
Right down the street from our pew
We're not doing all we can do
To shelter the homeless few
Shelter the homeless few

It's up to me
It's up to you

In the evening when I start to pray
I think about this day
Another page is turned forever
Another yesterday
And as the story of my life unfolds
I know You've read it all
Another line to be continued
Will I stand or fall

Open book - to You I am an open book
You know every page by heart
From the ending to the start
Open book - my life is like an open book
As I read between the lines
It's Your love that truly binds this open book

When the cover of this book is closed
The final chapter read
I hope You find it worth the reading
I hope 'well done' is said

And what I want to be
As You read the pages of my heart
Please tell me what You see

Based on Ezekiel 22:30, 1 Timothy 2:1, James 5:16

There's no feeling
Like when you have a friend in need
Their heart is wounded -
And you can feel your own heart bleed
And you wonder
Will they pull through this attack
You feel so helpless - you want to be fighting back
Don't think it's over - don't pull away
It's time to stand in - it's time to pray
Set the wheels in motion
With your devotion

Stand in the gap
Coming boldly to His throne of grace
Stand in the gap
He will hear you when you seek His face
Put your weapon to its use
And believe it will produce
Stand in the gap
Until all hell...
Until all hell breaks loose

In the conflict
It seems like He doesn't hear
Be encouraged - He still has an open ear
It's not for nothing
It's not in vain
Make your petitions
Call on His name
He will bring assistance
Through your persistence

The enemy is gonna have to fold his hand

Based on Hebrews 6:1a, Romans 1:17, Philippians 1:6

We're content to pitch our tent
When the glory's evident
Seldom do we know the glory came and went

Moving can seem dangerous
In this stranger's pilgrimage
Knowing that you can't stand still, you cross the bridge

(Chorus)
There's a higher place to go, beyond belief, beyond belief
Where we reach the next plateau, beyond belief, beyond belief
And from faith to faith we grow
Towards the center of the flow
Where He beckons us to go, beyond belief, beyond belief

Leap of faith without a net
Makes us want to hedge our bet
Waters never part until our feet get wet

There's a deeper place to go
Where the road seems hard to hoe
He who has begun this work won't let it go

And it takes so long to see the change
But we look around and it seems so strange

We have come so far but the journey's long
And we once were weak but now we're strong



",Beyond Belief,1990
Petra,"I believe in God the Father, maker of heaven and earth 
And in Jesus Christ His only Son 
I believe in the virgin birth 
I believe in the Man of Sorrows bruised for iniquities 
I believe in the Lamb who was
Crucified and hung between two thieves 

I believe in the resurrection on the
Third and glorious day 
And I believe in the empty tomb and the
Stone that the angel rolled away 
He descended and set the captives free 
And now He sits at God's right hand
And prepares a place for me 

[Chorus]
This is my creed, the witness I have heard 
The faith that has endured 
This truth is assured 
Through the darkest ages past 
Though persecuted, it will last 
And I will hold steadfast to this creed 

I believe He sent His Spirit to comfort and to reveal 
To lead us into the truth and light, to baptize and to seal 
I believe that He will come back the way He went away 
And receive us all unto Himself, but no man knows the day 

I believe He is the Judge of all men, small and great 
The resurrected souls of men receive from Him their fate 
Some to death and some to life, some to their reward 
Some to sing eternal praise forever to our Lord",Creed,1990

The earth is shakin?
It?s like a bad dream

Comin? apart at the seam but
I am on the Rock

Everywhere I?m turning it?s only bad news
This bomb is tickin? and we?re getting to the end of the

And though the floods may grow

Based on 1 Timothy 4:1, 2 Thessalonians 2:11, 2 Timothy 4:3-4

Somewhere in the darkest night a stranger has lost the way
Cold wind and a distant light has carried his heart away
Some say he was one of us, a prodigal gone astray
But inside he's as cold as ice to the truth that he won't obey
He won't discern - the point of no return

(Chorus)
In the last daze - the final haze
There was strong delusion to believe a lie
In the last daze before the blaze
They couldn't see beyond their misty trance
To grab the truth and have a fighting chance
In the last daze

Cold chills when the Spirit speaks that some shall depart from the faith
All ends in calamity just when they thought it was safe
They followed the lies - the fables men devised

Some say it's a certainty, a sign of the times I am told
But I weep for the souls of those who will never return to the fold



",Last Daze,1990
Petra,"First I want to thank You Lord for being who You are
For coming to the rescue of a man who's drifted far
For calling me to be Your son and calling me to serve
Lord the way You've blessed my life is more than I deserve

Keep the ones I love so dearly
Fill their emptiness while I am gone
And fill the loneliness in me

[Chorus]
This is my prayer
Lifted to You
Knowing You care even more than I do
This is my prayer
Lifted in Your name
Your will be done I humbly pray

Let me be the evidence of what Your grace can do
To a generations struggling to find themselves in You
May they come to know the love of God
May their eyes be made to see
Give me the opportunity to share the truth that sets them free
And may unity in all things
Be the banner of Your church
And let revival's fire begin to burn

[Chorus]

As we face the last and final hours
Turn a wayward country back to You
And keep us from the evil that devours
Keep us on the path and lead us through
Keep us in Your light until Your kingdom comes
And our work is done

Lifted to You
Knowing You care so much more than I do

Look at the front page, turn on the tv
They fire another round at you and me
Their guns are loaded, they're taking aim
Nobody told them we're not all the same
No paranoia, nobody could
Just write it off as being Hollywood
The innuendo between the lines
Leaves no confusion 'bout what's on their minds

(Chorus)
I won't go underground
I won't turn and flee
I won't bow the knee
I won't go underground
I won't turn and hide from the rising tide
I won't go underground
I won't compromise what the world denies
I won't go underground
And I'm not ashamed of the cross I've claimed

They're taking notes on what we say
You know they'd like to lock us all away
Can't stop the movement, can't make it slow
Persecution always makes us grow
They got my number, it's no surprise
I'm here and wearing no disguise
Bring on the lions and heat up the fire
It's not enough to stop this man's desire

(2nd Chorus)
I won't go underground
I won't turn and flee
I won't bow the knee
I won't go underground
I keep holding fast till the very last
I won't go underground
I will turn my cheek, I will boldly speak
I won't go underground
I am not ashamed of the cross I've claimed

I know the Spirit behind this force
It's not surprising if you know the source
I pray for freedom for helpless ones
And I keep standing till the new day dawns

And I won't lay low as the hatreds grow

Is love

Got a hold of my life and I'm here to stay

And the seed of life within began its start
Now I've finally found security
Now I finally see I'm Yours eternally
You've got Your hand on me

That You won't let me go

Feeling You're a million miles away
I just want to know without a doubt
I will always feel Your loving hand is reaching out

I feel Your touch every night, every day

That I love You so

I've been to the party and I left alone
And I've danced with a few that I'd be better off on my own
I've been to the altar and I know I kneeled
But I ended up dancing in the grass of another field
Then someone told me I heard someone say

(Chorus)
Dance with the one who brung ya
Dance with the one you know who got you there
Dance with the one who brung ya
Don't change hats, you know it's the one you wear

My feet start moving down inside my shoes
But I don't want to settle for the beat of a lonely blues
And there's no use dancin' to a different drum
When I've seen what happens and I know what will become
I can testify it's never worth a try

I looked high, I looked low
You're never gonna find someone who loves you so
Stand tall, stand strong
You're only gonna see you're right where you belong

Don't try to fix what has never been broke

Based on Jeremiah 1:5, Acts 17:25

It could have gone either way when it came down to the choice
To keep the life within a life that had no voice
It must have surely seemed the harder road to choose
To be so young to have to say who had the most to lose
But she came through like a champ and she blessed the world that day
Then gave the hope of a better life when she gave him away
Now the innocence and joy is there each day he wakes
Expressions of his love of life in every breath he takes
He could have been thrown away before he had a chance to say

(Chorus)
Hey world, I am here and I have something to give
Hey world, I'm alive and I am wanting to live

He turned to lock the door as he wiped away a tear
The hopelessness of missing love, his adolescent fear
As he struggled for the strength to put the gun away
He found the courage and the hope to face another day
He could have been blown away before he had a chance to say

Down the corridor or life in between our death and birth
We may start to lose our way in the search to find our worth
Our value comes in the fact we live
Life is a gift only God can give

I'm waiting on You
Just a word will get me through

I need to hear from You
Before this night is through
I need to hear from You
So I'm waiting, waiting just to hear from you

My whole world is turning upside down
When I'm lacking in direction
I don't care if it takes all night
I need to feel Your sweet affection

So let me hear words of life
I'm lost without You
Speak to me the way You do

I've been here in this place before
And You're not the one to blame
I need to know what You have in store
So I'm on my knees callin out Your name

Enough of the sidelines, gotta get in the game
When nothing is ventured, nothing is gained
He's callin' the numbers play by play
We're either out or we're in all the way

Get in the action whatever the cost
Nothing can equal the worth of the lost
Shoulder to shoulder, hand to the plow
Today is the day and the right time is now

And the field is ready for the new reserve
We will bring the harvest with a will to serve

Ready, willing and able
To advance the light and defend the right
Ready, willing and able
Lifting up the cross to the waiting lost
Ready to serve and willing to go
Able to stand against the foe

Bases are loaded, it's our turn at bat
Pressure is mounting, the tension is hot
Heaven is watching to see what we've got
There is strength in numbers
There is hope in One

With bold convictions leading the way

So we gotta keep staying loyal
Cause our feet are gonna leave this soil
When we burn the midnight oil
Burn the midnight oil
Some wait from the top of the mountain
Away from the world below
Some work while there's still a harvest
No rest when there's seed to sow
We go out to wait for the bridegroom
Some bring oil of readiness
Some lamps will be burned out waiting
Left out in there emptyness
Will our lamps be full at parousia?
When the bridegroom comes will hear the call

Petra,"(Verse 1)
Once a year for sacrifice just one priest could pay the price
And step inside the inner veil to make the people free
Temple stood the same for years till the Nazarene appears
Things will never be the same since 33 A.D.
When He spoke and bowed his head
He who saved the world was dead
Then the earth began to shake
Heaven's wall began to break
Opening the Holy place
The temple veil is torn in two
The way is clear for me and you

(Chorus 1)
We can enter in, enter in
Into Heaven's Holy place
We can enter in, enter in
Boldly by His blood we can approach His throne of grace
We can enter in a new and living Way
By our faith He will receive us when we pray

(Verse 2)
Now without a second look we forget what all it took
To be seen as innocent by His Holy eyes
Never thinking foolishly there is something He won't see
For our lack of righteousness there is no disguise
He won't look the other Way
Someone's life will have to pay
Once for all it has been done
Taken out upon His Son
He remembers it no more
Now for us He is the Door
Opened up forevermore

(Repeat Chorus 1)

We can enter in, enter in
We can enter in His gates with thankfulness and praise
Into the once forbidden Holy place
We can live in goodness and in mercy all our days
We can enter in a new and living Way
By our faith He will receive us when we pray
We don't have to be afraid to seek His face
We can enter in",Enter In,1995
Petra,"The fearless giant faces a brave young shepherd boy
He said, ""Your God is dead and your nation soon destroyed""
But the son of Jesse proved what God can do in the heart of a hero

Three men refused to bow to the idol made of gold
They knew they could burn for not doing what they're told
They'd rather face the fire than to kneel to a god made by hands

(Chorus)
It takes the heart of a hero
To stand for what's right
It takes the heart of a hero
to lay down your life

There are idols to be worshipped and giants in the land
They'll drag you down, attack your faith and slay you if they can
So let your heart be filled with the courage and strength of the Lord

(Repeat chorus)

Have the faith of a child
And the power of God
And when you call on His name
He will give you the heart of a hero

Will you stand for what's right?
Would you lay down you life?
Do you have a heart?

Petra,"(Verse 1)
I saw Your picture hanging on the wall
Just an artist rendering that was all
The way You looked down in Your agony
Jogged my memory
And helped me to ssee
If a picture's worth a thousand words
Then it won't help me at all
Only words are never gonna say
What I feel for You today

(Chorus)
More than a thousand words won't say
More than my life will not repay
More than a thousand things I do
Won't make it up to You

(Verse 2)
I stopped a moment sitting all alone
Without a waiting call on the phone
Looked like a picture from a magazine
More serenity than I've ever seen
And if words cannot describe this day
Or the beauty of this scene
Tell me, how can I expect the words I say
To reflect the things I mean

(Repeat Chorus)

More than a thousand words won't tell
How You forgave me when I fell
More than a thousand words won't do

Until I cross the barrier
Mortal words will have to do

As long as it takes to pass
Till you have no more doubt you'll endure
And you faith will emerge true and pure

No doubt it'll be alright
With God it'll all work together for good
No doubt in the end it will be understood
No doubt it'll all work out

No doubt in the power of Jesus
And after all is done we find out
All we really need to have is no doubt

There's a time to take a reckless leap of faith
There's a time to be cautious and wait
And there's a way of learning from the past
That this time of trouble won't last
And sometimes we want to think we know
The ways He will choose to make us grow
But it's never the way of our choosing
And we can't always see what He's using

No doubt it'll be alright
With God it'll all work together for good

No doubt in the power of Jesus
And after all is done we find out
All we really need to have is no doubt

There will be winters in the seasons of our soul
With a cold and bitter wind that chills our lives
But our faith can be building a fire
That will warm us till spring time arrives

No doubt it'll be alright
With God it'll all work together for good
No doubt in the end it will be understood

Fool's gold in a city coming down 
I'll leave the gold I can't afford 
For the higher prize I'm pressing toward 
I'll preach the foolish cross of Christ 
And wait for my reward 
Fool's gold 

The wisdom of the cross is easy to receive 
But only foolishness to them that don't believe 
They may say that I'm a fool for the cross that I proclaim 
But the gold that I must seek won't be found in earthly fame 

When the crowns of gold all lay before His feet

If we all maintain our silence
Even stones will cry out so loud
His creation will praise Him

In the end every tongue will confess
Every knee will eventually bow
His creation will praise Him
It's so easy to go for it now

And it's gonna be me

When the weight of the world begins to show
When the flames of faith begin to die before I know
Time to be rekindled by the everlasting Source
The all Consuming Fire, illuminating Force
Like a blacksmith bellows aim
He fans the embers to a flame

I'm all fired up - I'm all fired up
There's a flame burning in my soul
And my heart is a burning coal
I'm all fired up - I'm all fired up
Those who wait up on the Lord
Find their strength has been restored
The flames of renewal burn within
I'm all charged up in my spirit again
I'm all fired up - I'm all fired up tonight

I've been told not to let my feelings go
I've been told my emotions never had the right to show
But I have this feeling burning deep within my heart
Won't wait to let this heavenly celebration start
When the Spirit gives me the nod
I'll get excited 'bout the things of God

I feel my faith renewing - I feel revival brewing
All over the world there's a burning desire
I feel the Church is stirring and it's gonna keep occurring
Till we're all baptized in His Holy Fire

Based on Psalm 37:23-24

Standing on the corner I was losing track of time
When away in the distance saw an old friend of mine
He was smiling when he walked up held a tract out in his hand
Then he told me Jesus loved me and said ""so do I, man""
Told me Jesus wants to save me from the fiery pit of hell
Then I told him I was livin' there I knew that place well
I was just about to leave when a love came over me
Like nothin I had felt then we kneeled and we prayed
Right there in the street we prayed

And now, after all those years of falling down
I fell up in the arms of love
When I heard Him call

(Love was calling I was falling)
He was there and I could hear Him callin'
I was fallin' up into His arms
Love was catchin' me that day and somehow
I was fallin' up then
And I'm fallin' up now
I'm fallin' up now

I remember that same feeling I'm reminded everyday
See, Jesus lives inside me and I know He's there to stay
Sometimes I start to fall down just like any other man
But His arms are there to catch me
And lift me up again

After all those years of falling down
I fell up in the arms of love
When I heard Him call

Now - couldn't live without Him
Now - wanna know more about Him
Now - I'm falling once again
Now - falling up to heaven

Addiction of a different kind

He?s got 20/20 vision making a decision
He?s so unaffected by what he has rejected
Rooted and grounded -
He?s standen up to be counted
And he?s already proved
That he will not be moved

He will not bend to
The pressures and persuasions
He knows the lies
He won?t compromise

Everybody has to say their goodbyes
While they wipe away the tears from their eyes
Everybody bids a fonder farewell
When they know there won't be any sequel
Everybody says a Sayonara
When they know they won't be back tomorrow
Everybody hopes to have reunions
Back together with the ones they knew once

There's a salutation that's reserved for heaven's own
Hello again- we're back together
Hello again- we're here forever
Hello again- rejoined in heaven
Hello again

Everybody's gonna be there waiting
They just want to see you graduating
Gonna see the ones who've gone before us
They'll be cheering in a mighty chorus
Everybody will be glad to see ya
Even if it wasn't their idea
Every argument will be forgotten
We remember them for now but not then

When we see each other there'll be just one thing to say...
Say goodbye to the loneliness forever (Never be alone)
Say hello to the garden once again
Say goodbye to this world of stormy weather
Say hello to the One who calls you ""friend""

I can't wait until we're reunited and we say...",Hello Again,1998

I wear my seatbelt in the car I buckle up for safety
I run for cover from the storm
I wear a band aid on my knee I look both ways when crossing and I flee
Any danger I can see
And if I try each day to save my life in every way I can
How could I understand the way
You died for me
'Cause I don't know if I could even if I think I would
If I had to die for someone
If I had to die for someone else
How could I ever give my life to set the guilty free
When I cannot imagine
If I had to die for someone else like me
Someone else like me
I keep away from falling rocks and I don't play with matches
I lock the door I don't know why
It seems to me I'm much too old to wear a scarf out in the cold but
I want to live until I die
I guess I love my life a little more than I should love it
And if I had to I don't know if I could
Lay it down
And I am glad that You are not at all like me
'Cause You laid down Your life and did it willingly
It still amazes me to know
It's me that You were thinking of
No One else could have a greater love

Did you ever want to turn the hands of time back to your
Childhood?
Back to the time you had it made, you had it so good
What would it take to see mistakes before they happen?
What would you do with all the choices that you made then?

It's just a matter of time
It'll all be over (And it makes you wonder)
It's just a matter of time
Better think about it (How did it go so fast?)

Earth bound treasures that will fade away 
There ain't nothin' that will last him through the judgement day

Petra,"Shadows of a different kind
Come and cloud my mind
And make me wonder
Am I still in touch with You?
Or could it be my doubting point of view?
Seems like only yesterday
I was seeing clearly through the haze
Now I find I'm not so sure
When a shadow casts it's doubt upon my ways
Beyond a shadow of a doubt
I seem to find You waiting there
Behind the wall of my own reason
I discover how You care
Lord, I know You won't ignore my prayer
Through faith I'll find You waiting
Beyond a shadow of a doubt
I know You are waiting there
I can hear You when I'm listening
I can't see You clearly now
And I know that I am missing all You have...
I will follow You although I cannot see my way
Cast Your light upon these shadows
Make them go away
If I hear Your voice I will obey
Help my unbelief and help me go...
",Shadow of a Doubt,1998

In each soul a desperate cry 
To know if life has some true meaning 
Or if we simply live and die

In each heart there is a longing 
Only Jesus satisfies 

In each life there comes the question 
Is there more than meets the eye 
And what will we see of the eternal 
When the well of days runs dry? 
So we search with so few finding 
The difference between truth and lies 
While in each heart there is a longing 
Only Jesus satisfies 

Mystery on a hillside 
The purest love expressed 
Guilty lips cry forgive me 
In that moment I found rest

The difference between truth and lies 
While in each heart there is a longing

We have prayed to you for rain
We have cried your compassion
To renew the land again

More hungry than before
Now we're on your steps of mercy and we're knocking at your door

How long
Before you drench the barren land
How long
Before we see a righteous man
How long
Before your name is lifted high
How long
Before the weeping turns to songs of joy

Lord, we know your heart is broken
By the evil that you see
And you've stayed your hand of judgment
For your plan to set men free
But the land is still in darkness
And we've fled from what is right
And we've failed the silent children
Who will never see the light

But I know a day is coming
When the deaf will hear his voice
When the blind will see the savior
And the lame will leap for joy
When a widow finds a husband
Who will always love his bride
And the orphan finds a father
Who will never leave her side

Before your glory lights the skies
How long
Before your radiance lifts our eyes
How long
Before your fragrance fills the air
How long
Before the earth resounds with songs of joy

Petra,"By Bob Hartman
Based on Rom. 7:15

I have a secret that I let nobody see
An evil shadow that's been hanging over me
My alter ego that I try to hold at bay
But despite my good intentions he can always get away

He does the things that I don't want to do

Sometimes I feel like Jekyll and Hyde
Two men are fighting a war inside

I have this secret that I let nobody see
It's like a split personality
And the one I feed is the one who lives
The one I starve will be the one who gives

He won't do things that I know I should do

Sometimes I feel like Jekyll and Hyde
Two men are fighting a war inside
One gives, one takes, I have to decide
Sometimes I feel like Jekyll and Hyde

I need somebody to rescue me
When personalities clash
I know which person I want to be
With no defiance
Just God-reliance



",Jekyll & Hyde,2003
Petra,"Some believe this world is bound to get much better 
They think utopia is just around the bend 
They like humanity to come up with the answers

Our hopeless band-aids are all counterfeit 

In a perfect world, God's throne will come 
In a perfect world, in a perfect world 
In a perfect world ruled by His Son 
In a perfect world, in a perfect world 

Some still worship Mother Nature in her glory 
They do a good thing when they stand up for her right 
But Mother Nature has a Father in the heavens 
And His creation went astray but never left His sight

A whole new heaven and a new earth

Based on Proverbs 3:6, 1 Peter 5:8, Matthew 16:24

Smell the burning powder?
There's danger in the air
A voice from deep inside is telling you, 'you must beware'
Then enemy is watching
Every step you take
To find his opportunity in every choice you make

And it's no game
When someone lives without His grace
And who's to blame
When it blows up in their face

It's a mine field - you'd better follow Him through
God knows the way - you'd better stick like glue
It's a mine field - better stay on His heels
'cause the enemy kills and the enemy steals
So keep your head down and keep you eyes peeled
'cause life is...
Life is a mine field

Think the grass is greener?
You'd better look around
Everywhere you look another casualty is found
The enemy is waiting
For you to start to run
Waiting like an itchy finger on a loaded gun

Some may feel
They can wander out too far
They may heal
But they may always wear the scar

Better leave the navigation to the One who knows the Way
He will bring illumination
He will light your path each day

It's a mine field - better watch where you tread
Step off the path and you could end up dead
It's a mine field - better stay on His heels
'cause the enemy kills and the enemy steals
So keep your head down and keep your eyes peeled
'cause life is...
Life is a mine field

She couldn't ever look any better
But she knew she'd fail the test
She knew he would forget her

Triumphant was the way she felt
As she acknowledged the applause
Triumphant was the way she'd felt
When she saw him at the dressing room door

She was happier than she'd ever been
As he praised her for her grace
But his expression changed, she had seen
As he leant to kiss her face
It ended there
He claimed a late appointment
She quickly turned
To hide her disappointment
She ripped her glittering gown
Couldn't face another show, no
Her deodorant had let her down
She should have used Odorono",Odorono,2005

Relax and let your mind roll on

'Bout what makes a man, a man
Was it brain or brawn, or the month you were born
We just couldn't understand

Our old man didn't like our appearance
He said that only women wear long hair

So me and my brother borrowed money from mother
We knew what we had to do
We went downstairs, past the barber and gymnasium
And got our arms tattooed

I'm a man now, thanks to you
I expect, I'll regret you
But the skin graft man won't get you
You'll be there when I die, tattoo

Would play that ol' Opry show

I'd fall asleep in my chair
And dream that I was right there
Just singing the whole night through

When my folks would come home
They'd be humming a song

There ain't a thing in this world
To make you fall in love girl
Like the San Antonio stroll""

And he played something stately and slow

Hugger upp och rimmar, flyter på int på bosetimma, cirka tre timmar
Från Stocholms city står vi mitt I city-Helsinki,
Knäckt och fet o lämnar ingen skinka
Ja vi lika knyter bam Skandinavien I ett,
Helt komplett, komplett! som ben och knot
You're ett skelett som ligger tätt, respekt!
Yo till ni som insätt vätt, det var ett sätt att få,

Blir stadig vid brand, för det här, permanent!

Det är så logiskt, alla fattar utom du
Du har inte en aning, du har inte en aning, aning
Det är så logiskt, alla fattar utom du
Du har inte en aning, att jag tänker på dig precis just nu

Hej jag heter petter är 33 nånting, vet knappt ut eller in, jag fattar ingenting
Jag e fylld av begär, varje dag det tär
Helt förblindad av mig själv och min egen karriär
Jag dricker för mycket, men det förnekar jag
Om du frågar mig om sanningen så tvekar jag
Saknar röka gräs, ba en liten gås
Jag hade nog torskat på droger om jag inte fått en psykos
Nog torskat på det mesta om jag inte hållt mig I skinnet
För det kostar o festa när du trollar med sinnet
Brukar skylla på trycket men jag krökar för mycket
En vinare varje kväll, det är så långt ifrån nykter
Försöker mörka mitt sätt men det blir ofta fel
Du kanske känner igen mitt problem
Det är då jag hatar mig själv, för jag e patetisk och vaknar upp 
I hell och ba känner mig så dekis

[Chorus]
Det är så logiskt, alla fattar utom du
Du har inte en aning, du har inte en aning, aning
Det är så logiskt, alla fattar utom du
Du har inte en aning, att jag tänker på dig precis just nu

Hej jag heter petter jag är egocentrisk
Totalförändrad men på skalet identisk
Kan dö för min fru men det är inte sanningen nu
Jag kommer springa in I väggen o ba ramla itu
Innan jag fattar va som hänt, vilka broar jag bränt
Går 12-stegs programmet, dom o alla ja kännt
Brukar va svartsjuk som få, men de va värre då
När du lämna mig ibland blev hela världen grå
Jag vet knappt va som e bra med mig
Varför du kämpar på o ba vill va med mig
För jag träffar min familj för lite o när jag ser dom så jobbar 
jag konstant o ägnar knappast tid med dom
Jag tänker mest på pengar o mina framsteg
Men sanningen bakom ridån är nåt jag ibland ser
Det är då jag hatar mig själv, för jag e patetisk
De är som o leva I hell, fan vad jag e dekis

Det är så logiskt, alla fattar utom du

Hej jag heter petter, mitt liv är som ditt
Vet inte om du sett det, men de liknar mitt shit
För jag ser allt svart på vitt, alltid missnöjd med nåt
Grubblar över saker som jag nog aldrig förstått
Deprimerad mellanåt, de jag bär på e svårt
Jag tycker synd om mig själv när jag jobbar för hårt
Lovar o inte håller, det som driver mig finns där
Jag gillar dom som delar mitt synsätt o flyger I min sfärd
Kanske tappat det helt, spelat för många spel
Målat in mig I ett hörn, fått en törn
Det är då jag hatar mig själv, å kommer på det
För jag har ingen jävla aning om vafan jag håller på med*

Petter,"Varje gång är som den första gång vi sågs
Även om det är över nu
Allting har förändrats
Men du finns kvar
Allt var svävande men nu så ser ja klart

Du var gammal
Jag var äldre
Och nu sågs vi igen
Gått så lång tid så länge sen
Decennier tillbaks
Men jag minns det såväl
Varför kärleken brunnit
Utav olika skäl
Varför jag aldrig släppt det och aldrig gett upp
Trotts min väg vart lång kantats med gupp
Jag stått utan för din port så många gånger
Så många brev många sånger
Minns varje ord varje rad jag skrivit
En längtan så stor
Minns varje dag jag lidit
Har gått genom livet med en övertygelse
Att jag satt något spår
Som har haft betydelse
Aldrig besvarad aldrig tillmötes
En kärlek så varm utan den vilket öde
Från vinter till vår
Sen sommar till höst
Trots att tiden vart svår så gav kärleken tröst
Hjärtan som slår
Vi står där vi stod
Minns det som igår
Första gången du log
Som om jag snubblade pladask
På marken och bara dog

Varje gång är som den första gång vi sågs
Även om det är över nu
Allting har förändratas men du finns kvar
Allt var svävande men nu så ser jag klart

Jag var ung du var yngre
När vi sågs första gången
Rusade förbi mig snabbt på perrongen
Blev hjälplöst förälskat
Obeskrivligt tagen
Som om jag låg ner på marken och blev slagen
Betraktade ditt hår
När det fångades av vinden
Som att svimma på en bergstopp utav svindeln
Sen den stunden satt jag fast i ett nät förtrollad bunden
Tappa hjärtat i knät
Kunde inte tänka logiskt eller sunt
Och för varje sekund som du inte fanns där blev det tung
Började sakta uppvakta på avstånd i brev
Men det spelade ingen roll vad jag skrev
Du hade inte fastnat än inte fattat än
Vilken kärlek som fanns att bara hämta hem
Men efter ett tag
Det började korresponderas
Mina förhoppningar dom väcktes
För att sen raseras
Du flyttade utomlands någon annanstans
Gav bort din hand till en annan man
Och breven som skrevs dom kom aldrig fram
Men mitt hjärta det brann och min åtrå var sann

Jag gav aldrig upp dig när du försvann
Långa dagar blev till nätter sen till år

Varje gång är som den första gång vi sågs
Även om det är över nu
Allting har förändrats
Men du finns kvar
Allt var svävande men nu så ser jag klart

Ååå

Nu står du där på gatan
Sargad av tiden
Huden är grå
Din hållning förvriden
Vill säga nånting men jag kan inte tänka klart
Känslor bubblar upp utan att tänka tillbaks
Trevar mig fram för att etablera kontakt
Tar tag i din hand
Vi brister ut i ett skratt
Det var så länge sen
Men det finns där än
För passionen vi kände kommer alltid igen
Har ett hjärta utan rynkor
Det består intakt
Och drömmar i mitt liv har jag aldrig förlagt
Aldrig nått fram så jag älskat på avstånd
Nu är det mitt tåg och dags för avgång
Stiga på aldrig tveka en minut
För att allt som flyger upp måste landa till slut
Kan inte titta tillbaks trots min vilja är stark
Vi vandrar iväg utan vidröra mark

Varje gång är som den första gång vi sågs
Även om det är över nu
Allting har förändrats
Men du finns kvar
Allt var svävande men nu så ser jag klart

Du är som att andas för
Jag gav aldrig upp dig när du försvann

I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

I'd surely be Spring,

Say, if I were a bell,

That you're my every dream
Yet you're afraid each thing I do

Keeps us so far apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind 
And melt your cold, cold heart

Made your heart sad and blue

Could make me be true, could make me be blue
And even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you

Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss, but they wouldn't do

It's my man

And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me

He isn't good, he isn't true

But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms

I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot

This refrain would never stop
As he tapped away
Working all the day. 

At his bench there was he
Just as busy as a bee
Little time to lose
With the boots and shoes. 

But his heart went pop
Inside the little shop
When a lovely girl
Set him all a whirl. 

She had come to choose
Some pretty dancing shoes
And he heard her say
In her charming way, 

""Shoes to set my feet a-dancing, dancing,
Dancing, dancing all the day.
Shoes to set my feet a-dancing, dancing, 
Dancing all my cares away."" 

Then he tapped and he stitched
For his fingers were bewitched
And he sewed a dream
Into every seam. 

Making shoes, oh so neat
Just like magic on her feet
And he hoped she'd know
That he loved her so. 

But she danced, danced, danced
As tho' she were entranced
Like a spinning top
All around the shop. 

On her dainty feet 
She whirled into the street
And he heard her say 
As she danced away,

Dancing, dancing all the day.

Suddenly there's a valley
Where friendships never end

Swept clean by the waving grain
Surveyed by a happy bluebird
And kissed by the falling rain

Could make me feel this way, yay 
Since I met you I just can't forget you
I love you more each day, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah 

There may be some tears through the comin' years 
Ooh, all the while I know you'll be smilin' 
Your love will guide me through ev'ry mile 'cause

Petula Clark,"For all we know we may never meet again
Before you go make this moment sweet again
We won't say ""Good night"" until the last minute
I'll hold out my hand and my heart will be in it

For all we know this may only be a dream
We come and go like a ripple on a stream
So love me tonight; tomorrow was made for some
Tomorrow may never come for all we know

So love me tonight; tomorrow was made for some
Tomorrow may never come for all we know",For All We Know,1998
Petula Clark,"If a picture paints a thousand words,
Then why can't I paint you?
The words will never show the you I've come to know.
If a face could launch a thousand ships,
Then where am I to go?
There's no one home but you,
You're all that's left me too.
And when my love for life is running dry,
You come and pour yourself on me.

If a man could be two places at one time,
I'd be with you.
Tomorrow and today, beside you all the way.
If the world should stop revolving spinning slowly down to die,
I'd spend the end with you.
And when the world was through,
Then one by one the stars would all go out,
Then you and I would simply fly away",If,1998
Petula Clark,"Now if there's a smile upon my face 
it's only there trying to fool the public
but when it comes down to fooling you 
now honey that's quite a diff'rent subject
Don't let my glad expression 
give you the wrong impression really I'm sad
Oh, sadder than sad, you're gone and I'm hurting so bad
like a clown I pretend to be glad
 
Now there's some sad things known to man 
but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown, when there's no one around
Oh yeah, baby,
 
Now if I appear to be carefree, 
it's only to camouflage my sadness
in order to shield my pride 
I try to cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But Don't let my show convince you 
that I've been happy since you decided to go,
I need you so, I'm hurt and I want you to know
but for others I put on a show
 
Now there's some sad things known to man 
but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown,
when there's no one around
 
Just like Pagliacci did
I try to keep my sadness hid
smiling in the public eye
but in my lonely room I cry 
the tears of a clown
Oh, yeah baby
 
Now, if there's a smile on my face
Don't let my glad expression
Give you a wrong impression
Don't let this smile I wear
Make you think that I don't care

but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown, when there's no one around",Tears of a Clown,1998

Yours until the rivers all run dry

Baby I'm Yours,
Baby I'm Yours
And I'll be yours until the sun no longer shines, 
Yours until the poets run out of rhymes
In other words until the end of time

I'm gonna stay right here by your side, 
Do my best to keep you satisfied,
Nothing in the world could drive me away,
Every day you'll hear me say

Petula Clark,"I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon [From Finian's Rainbow],1998
Petula Clark,"You're the only one that I rely on
A shoulder there for me to cry on
And the hours alone that I'm without you
All I ever do is think about you

No one knows that you're so understanding
Even though my love is so demanding
Every time you look at me
Then you'll know we'll both agree
That no other love could be

I couldn't live without your love
Now, I know you're really mine
I gotta have you all the time

Didn't like you much when I first met you
But somehow, I couldn't quite forget you
Said you didn't want a friend or lover
That your life was happy with another

But as time went by, my love grew stronger
Knew that I just couldn't wait any longer
For I couldn't let you go
And I had to tell you so
That I loved you, then you'd know

I couldn't live without your love
Now, I know you're really mine
I gotta have you all the time

Now, the tears are gone and I'm not cryin'
When you say you love me, you're not lyin'
So, when people want to stare
I know I don't really care
Just as long as you are there

I couldn't live without your love
Now, I know you're really mine
I gotta have you all the time

I couldn't live without your love

I gotta have you all the time",I Couldn't Live Without Your Love,1999
Petula Clark,"I was five and he was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight

[Chorus]
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down.

Seasons came and changed the time
And I grew up, I called him mine
He would always laugh and say
""Remember when we used to play?""

[Chorus]

Now he's gone, I don't know why
And till this day, sometimes I cry
He didn't even say goodbye
He didn't take the time to lie.

Petula Clark,"When I'm feelin' blue, all I have to do is take a look at you,
Then I'm not so blue.
When you're close to me I can feel you heart beat 
I can hear you breathing in my ear.
 
Wouldn't you agree, baby, you and me got  a groovy kind of love.
We got a groovy kind of love.
 
Any time you want to you can turn me on to anything you want to. 
Any time at all.
When I taste your lips 
Oh, I start to shiver can't control the quivering inside.

Petula Clark,"I'm sitting in the railway station. 
Got a ticket to my destination. 
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand. 
And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band. 
Homeward bound, 
I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 
Ev'ry day's an endless stream 
Of cigarettes and magazines. 
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories 
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be, 
Homeward bound, 
I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 

Tonight I'll sing my songs again, 
I'll play the game and pretend. 
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity 
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me.

I've come home at last!

And this time will be bigger,
And brighter than we knew it.
So watch me fly, we all know I can do it
Could I stop my hand from shaking?
Has there ever been a moment with so much to live for?

So much to say not just today but always.

We'll have magic in the making.

When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all I've done
You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you
I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to

The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days my mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world
They were all I desired
They are illusions
They're not the solutions they promised to be,
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

There's nothing more
I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do is look at me
To know that ev'ry word is true

Where the spirit free of the lies
And all else we despised

They've forgotten all about God

And end up selling flowers instead.
Begging for his bread and water,
While his husband has his breakfast in bed.

How humiliating! How delightful!

When she hammers on my door in tears and rags.
Miserable and lonely, repentant and contrite,
Will I take his in or hurl his to the walls?
Give his kindness or the treatment she deserves?
Will I take his back or throw the baggage out?

But, I'm a most forgiving man,
The sort who never could, never would,
Take a position and staunchly never budge.
A most forgiving man.

Let his shiver, let his moan,
I'll slam the door and let the hell-cat freeze!

La baguette d’une fée
M’a touchée
Belle, comme la nuit est belle
Au souffle d’un vent nouveau
Que c’est beau

Des inconnus
Me font des signes de la main
Les quotidiens n’ont rien à dire ce matin
On est heureux
Tout est bleu…

Tendre.
Comme la vie est tendre
Je me sens dans du coton
Que c’est bon
Sonne le téléphone sonne
Aussi doux que la chanson
D’un grillon

Tu es venu
Avec des fleurs pleins les bras
Tu as perdu
Ton air boudeur d’autrefois
Tu dis bonjour mon amour

Simple.
Comme la vie est simple
Quand il suffit d’exister
Et d’aimer…

Mm….

Petula Clark,"On the day I was born, 
said my father, said he,
I've an elegant legacy 
waiting for ye.
Tis a rhyme for your lips 
and a song for your heart,
To sing whenever the world falls apart.

Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow it over the hill and stream.
Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.
Follow the fellow, follow the fellow,
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.

'Twas a sumptuous gift bequeathed to a child.
Oh, the lure of that song 
Kept her feet running wild.
For you never grow old and you never stand still
With a whippoorwill singing beyond the next hill.

So, I bundled me heart and I roamed the world free.
To the east with the lark
Tow the west with the sea.
And I searched all the world and I scanned all the skies.
But I found it at last in my own true love's eyes.",Entr'acte (Look to the Rainbow) [*],2004
Petula Clark,"I hear a bird, Londonderry bird,
It well may be he's bringing me a cheering word.
I hear a breeze, a River Shanon breeze,
It well may be it's followed me across the seas.
Then tell me please

How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that little brook still leaping there?
Does it still run down to Donny cove?
Through Killybegs, Kilkerry and Kildare?

How are things in Glocca Mora?
Is that willow tree still weeping there?
Does that lassie with the twinklin' eye
Come smilin' by and does she walk away,

Sad and dreamy there not to see me there?
So I ask each weepin' willow and each brook along the way,
And each lass that comes a-sighin' too ra lay

If this isn't love, the whole world is crazy.
If this isn't love, I'm daft as a daisy,
With moons all a-round and cows jumping over,
There's something amiss, and I'll eat my hat if this isn't love.

If this isn't love, then winter is a summer,

Those days are all gone now but one thing is true
When I look and I find, I still love you

You can't turn back the clock, you can't turn back the tide
Ain't that a shame? Ain't that a shame?
I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride
When life was just a game

No use in sitting thinkin' on what you did
Find more lyrics at ※ Mojim.com
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids
Sometimes it seems like lately, I just don't know
Better sit back and go with the flow

'Cause these are the days of our lives
They've flown in the swiftness of time
Those days are all gone now but some things remain
When I look, I find no change

Those were the days of our lives
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing's still true
When I look and I find, I still love you

I still love you, I love you
I still love you, love you
I still love you, I still love you
Still love you, ooh yeah",These Are the Days of Our Lives [#],2008

Can't take my eyes off you.
You'd be like heaven to touch. 
I want to hold you so much.
At long last love has arrived. 
And I thank God I'm alive.
You're just too good to be true. 
Can't take my eyes off you. 

Pardon the way that I stare. 
There's nothing else to compare.
The sight of you leaves me weak. 
There are no words left to speak.
But if you feel like I feel. 
Please let me know that it's real.
You're just too good to be true. 
Can't take my eyes off you. 

I love you baby, and if it's quite all right,
I need you baby to warm the lonely night. 
I love you baby.
Trust in me when I say: 
Oh pretty baby, don't bring me down, I pray. 
Oh pretty baby, now that I found you. Stay. 

And let me love you, baby. Let me love you

Just the faithful and holy pair,
Lovely boy-child with curly hair,
Sleep in heavenly peace!

Love from your holy lips shines clear,
As the dawn of salvation draws near,
Jesus, Lord, with your birth!

From the heavens' golden height
Shows the grace of His holy might

Where today all the might
Of His fatherly love us graced
And then Jesus, as brother embraced.

As our Lord, free us of wrath,
Since times of our fathers He hath
Promised to spare all mankind!

Duro como un tipo que no habla
Duro como pija de preso
Eso es espeso

Te hace queso
Es al pedo emigrar
Es igual cualquier lugar

Pez,"Yeah, for all the festival heads, check it out

Alright it's that time of the year you've been waiting for, for months now
Saving up your pay trying to figure all your funds out
It's kinda funny when you think of all the fun
How it's taken this long to shake last year's comedown
Forget the past, as soon as December starts
Grab your parents' credit card and hope that you don't get in last
Yeah, 'cause if you let it pass these days
A week late can mean paying triple when you bpay off ebay (true)
It's hard to figure out what tickets you want, should it be Falls Festival or Pyramid Rock?
Well for me, I really don't care 'cause I don't listen to rock, or hip hop
I just wear earplugs and sit there and watch
If your favourite band's there you'll think you'll never forget
You'll probably get that wasted you won't remember their set
But if you're a festival head then you already know the plan
Go and pack up all your shit 'cause you're going on a trip for those summer days

Summer days
Oh, summer days
Summer days
For those summer days
I love summer days

Man I'm not squishing in the back
I'm telling you, shotgun front
Nah, bullshit man

Now when you finally make it there from driving up with your crew
You better get your mind set on finding something to do
'Cause you'll be stuck there lining up in the queue
Moving bumper-to-bumper until your arse hurts, all to get your car searched
And if your alcohol you're stressing 'cause you need it bad
Stashing bottles of vodka up in your sleeping bags
Maybe get a spare tyre with a heap of cans
It doesn't matter, everybody has their secret plan
Once your crew start picking your spot
Unpacking, realize all the things you forgot, or shit that you lost
Man, I swear I brought my pillows and socks
And dudes too excited already sitting there sloshed
It doesn't take long before you find somebody blazing up

Man, how cold is it inside this tent?
I know, it's freezing man, Jesus Christ!

Now as soon as the sun rises you'll be ready to start
At six o'clock standing there outside your tent with a glass
You're in it for the long haul, it doesn't end when it's dark
We all know you've got your friends to make your energy last
And you gotta time it so you peak it while the acts play
Try and jump the fence and start sneaking into back stage
If you get caught by police then try to act straight
Nah, they're not those pills, I need them for my back pain
And dudes are flying, saying to their mates ""I love you man!""
Or on a walk so they can go and call their Mum and Dad (it's Pez)
And then there's people who so desperately just need a friend
They're going up to anybody trying to have a D&M (yeah, my family)
The next stage is you won't even watch the bands live
You're having too much fun talking shit around your campsite
Getting wasted while you bake in the sun
What can I say, yo, it's a fucking good way to get drunk

Hey, what happened to you guys last night?
I didn't even hear the countdown or anything

Now by the last day you're probably thinking summer's the worst
'Cause all that time out in the sun left you covered in burns
And smothered in dirt, the sight of all the dunnies is worse
And all the food shops are gone when you're so hungry it hurts
All you wanna do is sleep but you got packing to do
Then squash up in that car and jump back in a queue
Yeah, I know we all complain about the pain when it ends
But next year we’ll save up and do the same shit again

I'm not sayin' that it's wrong 'cause it's not

That's why they say if you ever get chosen
You made it 'cause anything goes
That's why we find ourself in a time where
People deny what's really inside them, frightened
Mighta feared that the outcome is doubtful
Not knowin' in itself that's the downfall, it's weird right
See we think we'll never make an impact
Since a young age we've been trained to think that
That's the only reason we're beaten
They know they can feed us this shit and we'll believe it, either
You can struggle through life or take your story
And then turn it into something you like it's all up in your mind
And in mine man, I'm leavin' on a plane

È sveglia, mi guarda, non so.

Sale adagio verso me.
E la vita nel mio petto batte piano,
Respira la nebbia, penso a te.
Quanto verde tutto intorno a ancor piú in là,
Sembra quasi un mare l'erba,
E leggero il mio pensiero vola e va
Ho quasi paura che si perda...
Un cavallo tende il collo verso il prato
Resta fermo come me:
Faccio un passo, lui mi vede, è già
Fuggito...
Respiro la nebbia, penso a te.
No, cosa sono adesso non lo so
Sono come, un uomo in cerca di se stesso
No, cosa sono adesso non lo so
Sono solo, solo il suono del mio passo...
Ma intanto il sole tra la nebbia filtra già:

in una delle molte feritoie della notte
con un bisogno d'attenzione e d'amore
troppo, ""Se mi vuoi bene piangi ""
per essere corrisposti,
valeva la pena divertirvi le serate estive
con un semplicissimo ""Mi ricordo"":
per osservarvi affittare un chilo d'erba
ai contadini in pensione e alle loro donne
e regalare a piene mani oceani
ed altre ed altre onde ai marinai in servizio,
fino a scoprire ad uno ad uno i vostri nascondigli
senza rimpiangere la mia credulità:
perché già dalla prima trincea
ero più curioso di voi,
ero molto più curioso di voi.

E poi sospeso dai vostri ""Come sta""
meravigliato da luoghi meno comuni e più feroci,
tipo ""Come ti senti amico, amico fragile,
se vuoi potrò occuparmi un'ora al mese di te""
""Lo sa che io ho perduto due figli""
""Signora lei è una donna piuttosto distratta.""
E ancora ucciso dalla vostra cortesia
nell'ora in cui un mio sogno
ballerina di seconda fila,
agitava per chissà quale avvenire
il suo presente di seni enormi
e il suo cesareo fresco,
pensavo è bello che dove finiscono le mie dita
debba in qualche modo incominciare una chitarra.

E poi seduto in mezzo ai vostri arrivederci,
mi sentivo meno stanco di voi
ero molto meno stanco di voi.

Potevo stuzzicare i pantaloni della sconosciuta
fino a vederle spalancarsi la bocca.
Potevo chiedere ad uno qualunque dei miei figli
di parlare ancora male e ad alta voce di me.
Potevo barattare la mia chitarra e il suo elmo
con una scatola di legno che dicesse perderemo.
Potevo chiedervi come si chiama il vostro cane
Il mio è un po' di tempo che si chiama Libero.
Potevo assumere un cannibale al giorno
per farmi insegnare la mia distanza dalle stelle.
Potevo attraversare litri e litri di corallo
per raggiungere un posto che si chiamasse arrivederci.

Nel paesino di Sant'Ilario
Tutti si accorsero con uno sguardo
Che non si trattava di un missionario

C'è chi l'amore lo fa per noia
Chi se lo sceglie per professione
Bocca di rosa né l'uno né l'altro
Lei lo faceva per passione

A soddisfare le proprie voglie
Senza indagare se il concupito
Ha il cuore libero oppure ha moglie

Bocca di rosa si tirò addosso
L'ira funesta delle cagnette
A cui aveva sottratto l'osso

Non brillano certo in iniziativa
Le contromisure fino a quel punto
Si limitavano all'invettiva

Si sa che la gente dà buoni consigli
Sentendosi come Gesù nel tempio
Si sa che la gente dà buoni consigli
Se non può più dare cattivo esempio

Così una vecchia mai stata moglie
Senza mai figli, senza più voglie
Si prese la briga e di certo il gusto
Di dare a tutte il consiglio giusto

E rivolgendosi alle cornute
Le apostrofò con parole argute
""Il furto d'amore sarà punito""
Disse ""dall'ordine costituito""

Ed arrivarono quattro gendarmi
Con i pennacchi e con le armi

Spesso gli sbirri e i carabinieri
Al proprio dovere vengono meno

C'era un cartello giallo
Con una scritta nera

Non ha bisogno di alcun giornale
Come una freccia dall'arco scocca
Vola veloce di bocca in bocca

Fra un miserere e un'estrema unzione

Che siano I più forniti della virtù meno apparente
Fra tutte le virtù la più indecente

""Non avrai altro Dio all'infuori di me, 
spesso mi ha fatto pensare: 
genti diverse venute dall'est 
dicevan che in fondo era uguale. 

Credevano a un altro diverso da te 
e non mi hanno fatto del male. 
Credevano a un altro diverso da te 
e non mi hanno fatto del male. 

Non nominare il nome di Dio, 
non nominarlo invano. 
Con un coltello piantato nel fianco 
gridai la mia pena e il suo nome: 

ma forse era stanco, forse troppo occupato, 
e non ascoltò il mio dolore. 
Ma forse era stanco, forse troppo lontano, 
davvero lo nominai invano. 

Onora il padre, onora la madre 
e onora anche il loro bastone, 
bacia la mano che ruppe il tuo naso 
perché le chiedevi un boccone: 

quando a mio padre si fermò il cuore 
non ho provato dolore. 
Quanto a mio padre si fermò il cuore 
non ho provato dolore. 

Ricorda di santificare le feste. 
Facile per noi ladroni 
entrare nei templi che rigurgitan salmi 
di schiavi e dei loro padroni 

senza finire legati agli altari 
sgozzati come animali. 
Senza finire legati agli altari 
sgozzati come animali. 

Il quinto dice non devi rubare 
e forse io l'ho rispettato 
vuotando, in silenzio, le tasche già gonfie 
di quelli che avevan rubato: 

ma io, senza legge, rubai in nome mio, 
quegli altri nel nome di Dio. 
Ma io, senza legge, rubai in nome mio, 
quegli altri nel nome di Dio. 

Non commettere atti che non siano puri 
cioè non disperdere il seme. 
Feconda una donna ogni volta che l'ami 
così sarai uomo di fede: 

Poi la voglia svanisce e il figlio rimane 
e tanti ne uccide la fame. 
Io, forse, ho confuso il piacere e l'amore: 
ma non ho creato dolore. 

Il settimo dice non ammazzare 
se del cielo vuoi essere degno. 
Guardatela oggi, questa legge di Dio, 
tre volte inchiodata nel legno: 

guardate la fine di quel nazzareno 
e un ladro non muore di meno. 
Guardate la fine di quel nazzareno 
e un ladro non muore di meno. 

Non dire falsa testimonianza 
e aiutali a uccidere un uomo. 
Lo sanno a memoria il diritto divino, 
e scordano sempre il perdono: 

ho spergiurato su Dio e sul mio onore 
e no, non ne provo dolore. 
Ho spergiurato su Dio e sul mio onore 
e no, non ne provo dolore. 

Non desiderare la roba degli altri 
non desiderarne la sposa. 
Ditelo a quelli, chiedetelo ai pochi 
che hanno una donna e qualcosa: 

nei letti degli altri già caldi d'amore 
non ho provato dolore. 
L'invidia di ieri non è già finita: 
stasera vi invidio la vita. 

Ma adesso che viene la sera ed il buio 
mi toglie il dolore dagli occhi 
e scivola il sole al di là delle dune 
a violentare altre notti:

Now you're fighting you fears but they never fight fair
Gone are all the endless summer days

I believe that they're still there
Though the storms will surely come
So let me ask you can you look to sky
And strain to see the sun again

You harbor the hurt and you shelter the pain
Too proud to ever confess fallen again
But don't you long for mercy's tender embrace

Remember the words you spoke from you heart
Its a pity those phrases have fallen apart
Gone is every promise that you made

Just how much true love can change a man

It's off to work and then home again
She wonders if this will ever change
Clutching her pillow, she hides in a dark
Room in her heart

How long has it been
Since love touched her and she let in
Chased out the shadows, filled emptiness
With her head in her hands, she cries
""Come back again, I need you, my friend""

We fight on our knees but don't often see
The battles that rage being won
But fight on, we will and tarry until
Love comes to carry us on
To kneel with the broken in spirit
And call upon the Son

So many holes here within
Torn apart and then blown by the wind
Hell and high water come crashing in
Pride says to fight but he cannot defend
This means to an end

The truth cuts like a blade
Bleeding all of the plans that he made
Nothing but faith in the One who came
Can ever bring peace to the spirit again
Will he understand?

We fight on our knees for those who might see
The battle is over, it's won
Not by our hands, by the Son of man
He who is has overcome
Death and the grave hold no power
To those who call upon the Son

We fight on our knees but don't often see
The battles that rage being won
But fight on, we will and tarry until
Love comes to carry us on
To kneel with the broken in spirit
And call upon the Son

Vamos a cortar cabezas con alambres de púas
Vamos a secuestrar gente desnu'a y arrancarle las tetas

Miren como me están viendo
Tengo ganas de ocasionar un incendio
Con una batería botando gasolina par de cables
Enrollado en al barriga un rollo de teipe algo de babilla
Y de tomar con alegría
Tu no sabes lo que yo daría por ver tus estrías descociendose
Y botando sangría
Todos los días yo rezo pa' que pase eso

Y estoy escuchando el mismo zumbido en mi oído para
Tranquilo acuéstate en la camilla
Tomate esta pastilla
Ahora aguante la respiración que por ahí va la inyección

Voy decidido a fusilar el reggaeton

Like snowhite clouds floating through the night

Yo, I was just wonderin' if I could give you this rhyme I wrote
Go ahead man, I ain't hatin', go ahead, yo

It's all about me, me, and did I mention me?
I'm the dopest rapper in the Gospel Rap industry
I kill more white rappers than snipers
I'm the one they call to get the crowd hyper
Yo, all y'all cats need to retire

With your played out raps, I'm the roughest and toughest
I love the spotlight, yo, you better make sure this mike sounds right
Or I'll charge you double on this honorarium
Don't ask me to speak words of encouragement
'Cause, yo, I got the dopest skills

Don't ask me to do what God wills
It's all about keepin' it real and makin' sure
I get me a fat type of record deal
Give the crowd something they can feel

Toss God a bone every once in a while, have a Coke and a smile
Yo, I been doin' this a long while, man, like two months even
So what if I look like a heathen, I can still kill the Ruckus Demon
I got all the girls fiendin' , I put emcee back into emceeing

I'm acheivin' what I want, these skills is what I flaunt
Yo, you can't get me, so tell me what you got
Man, I live and die for the God of Hip Hop
I mean God and Hip Hop, so y'all fools need to stop

Showin' faces in the places where we blessin' at
Tryin' to battle, got respect for your skills
But skill alone don't get you props, it takes integrity

When rappin' for Christ on microphones

Who's this Babylon emcee with the audacity, approaching me?
As if I got a stamp of approval for his fallacy
I hear you talkin' 'bout yourself
And claim, you keep it real but I ain't feelin' it
I'm feelin' to your flesh but only kill the little light so dimly shinin'

I question why you rhymin'?
Is ministry in mind and does God direct your timin'?
Or do you even put it in to put it out? What you about?
Do you use him as a jewel well then your crown?
And you clout your time will tell

In life he must prevail, a living example is needed to rap it well
See, the ministry begins the minute you step up in from the stage
Is your character the essence of the life
You hear in the pages of his very word?

'Cause if not face his rage
You ain't understandin' he demands a higher standard
Stayin' true to Hip Hop can't be found in his commandments
Take notice because the atmosphere is about to get tense

Wanna find relatin' truth to, some gone take it offense
Young cats, heed the message of this elder emcee
Who got responsibility to let you know what kind of abilities to key?
But it seems that some of y'all ain't caught the vision as we

There's a light we can love on the way.
There is a wonder and wildness to life,
And freedom for those who obey.

A pardon for all who believe.
Hope for the hopeless and sight for the blind
To all who've been born of the Spirit

And who share incarnation with him;
Who belong to eternity, stranded in time,
And weary of struggling with sin.
Forget not the hope
That's before you,
And never stop counting the cost.

The minute that you touch the ground
The rhythm and the sound of the joy and love is bound
To make you want to stay, live a new way
Or just change your life around
And if you're down, cool 
We'll go together me and you
Only the chosen ones will fly
In the land of love take me too

If you see, you believe,
Stay true travel amazed, find a way

If you find love hold on tight

don't push, your love away
Don't push, your love away

then on the walk on my way back home
I get a call from a friend on the telephone
He says come here I've got this girl to see
But beware, love isn't always free
Upon first glance, I got so hungry
Forbidden fruits, you gotta taste them
I took one bite, we all take chances
Poison lips, doomed romances

don't push, your love away (don't push your love away)
Don't push, your love away (don't push your love away)

a kiss of death, on the door
That's what you get, for takin home a whore
I shouldn't say that, it doesn't sound nice
Faith removes my fear sometimes
I'm too shy, you're too sharp
Together we can work eachother out
Loves too quick, she's always been
We're in your bed, drunk with adrenaline

don't push, your love away (don't push your love away)
Don't push, your love away (don't push your love away)

and I can see better days
We can share, love can save
You can hide in yourself
We can go our separate ways

and I've seen better days
Pass me by in a haze
And we've seen better days
Pass us by in a haze
I've seen better days

Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low 
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
 
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
Ev'ry little movement of the band
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low

Pharoah Sanders,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending

You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Pharoah Sanders,"I believe that children are our future;
Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier;
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.
 
Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

Pharoah Sanders,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,1987
Pharoah Sanders,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1987
Pharoah Sanders,"All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
So you see, I've got to say no, no
All or nothing at all",All or Nothing at All,1989
Pharoah Sanders,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,1991
Pharoah Sanders,"It's not the pale moon that excites me 
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
It's just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
It's just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me

To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,1991

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star

Brought to you by the world famous wake-up show!

Bobby Steels, Staple' tails, M-C's get your lips stapled
Project Killa Hill is stamped on the map like the compass
Sacred sword play tongue-twist, piercin' holes in you
You can't escape, 70,000 kilowatts blast through your box
Woke wit alarm clocks, cars drivin' slow down the block
One stopped, parks pops his trunk
Snare pops loud as glock shots
Bass like an M-80 in your face, cops stop, give us citation
We pause for radio station identification
Wake up wake up wake up!

When I Woke-Up, I got the mic and never chocked up
Busted a verse and all the G's in Cali loc'ed up when I was summoned
Styles were mixed like the Drummonds, Killer Clown is comin'
Look around, your town is crumblin'
This Big Tech from the midwest, leavin' M-C's lipless
On The Wake-Up Show, make up no, stories about my shake-up flow
Put me off in a cipher? Potna, you can't fuck wit the sniper
Your flow's premature, clean your dirt diaper
Mic heister, psycho, alpha-schizo
Hypno, chryo-gat flow, guru and ain't nobody tighter
Sway and Tech heard me flow and its sealed
Now I got Swedish women yelling ""Tech N9nes's vild""

This place is my house, I might as well erase my face wit white-out
Cause y'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows (where you at?)
Climped out of a nice house,
Through the front window and heard this guy shout
""Hey that's my couch, bitch!""
Pull a nine out during a rhyme bout
While I'm rippin' this shit, put a clip in it spit five rounds
And murder you hoes worse than a convertible flippin' vertical
Nose first wit the top off landin' upside-down
You're tied down and duct-taped, fuck rape
I'd rather just hump a slut's leg wit my nuts shaved
And Sway and Tech, two disk jokeys
Breakin' so many friggin' needles I wonder if they inject

Lo and behold, better than platinum or gold
Yes God bless success, never forsake your soul
Xzibit take control, locked loaded and ready to roll
Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold
Cause your tape sucks, find a new hobby that you can take up
Or listen to my niggas Tech and Sway so you can Wake-Up
The X-man, catch me doin' drills in the Danger Room
Big game hunting, from high-noon to the full moon

Wit synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush
From minimum thrusts, bust multiple assaults in small interims
As horrid as Borris Kolaf was
When I cut your neck, leave a little piece of flesh
So the head won't fall off, hauled-off
Sawed-off shotgun blast, he asked
Why did he have to die like cast metal?

Pharoahe Monch,"My mom is in the bedroom, cryin' again
Sister's on the street corner, lyin' again
Just heard about another one of my niggas dyin' again
I'm tryin' again to make moves
I'll be damned if we go hungry
Ever since my pops passed the responsibilities belonged to me
This song you see is like an ode to God
That he blessed my last breath to be Allahuakbar
And this city is hard, tenement buildings are barred
Incarcerated and scarred, no sentiment for when it becomes 
Time for war I'm tryin' to score like Bernard King
My vocal box sling verbal cocaine like the government
I told you I'd hurt the music
Travellin' back, bustin' shots at before Christ was persecuted
Mathematically we live at right angles
Fuck the star spangled, the makers of fallen angels
Danglin' from moon crescents, I persevere, breathe the air
Inhale the effervesence of life
This street game is stiflin' I'm triflin' upholdin' a rifle
Peerin' from behind the eyes of God, we at odds with ourselves
What is it worth when this barren metropolis prevail
Scale the walls of hell trail of a octopus

I seen it all through the eyes of a needle
Depletion of the planet, brainwash of the people
Niggas'll never learn (shit) we just concern about
Who's fuckin' who, when time is of significance
Ghost, we disregard the most magnificent
Eat of the fruit that is poisonous and lethal
Stuck in the crux of the spell with the evil
Credits about to roll and hell is the sequel

Incarcerated scarfaces in all places
Crack sales rise, failed lives, cops and robber car chases
Y2K fuck up, you're left faceless
Hustlers bury money in Garcia Vega cigar cases
Give the drummer some, pianos, guitar basses
Trumpet in tune, Pharoahe and Prince legitimate reasons
To why they thumpin', hi I'm the most endangered species
By all means, survival is what I teach these
First time offenders catchin' seven to fifteen
Now my vision of life, is hell and heaven on split screen
Bust your shit like Mitch Greene (snitch) I switch scenes
Bring drama to that ass, that's how we on it in Queens
What? Stray bullets continue shatterin' dreams, batterin' spleens
I'm gatherin' schemes, had only cream just as bad as a fiend
Take food from a table and get drunk to your death
Now feel it in your heart from the love in my breath

I seen it all through the eyes of a needle
Depletion of the planet, brainwash of the people

After we done recorded dozens of albums
And made 'em hundreds of thousands of dollars, they still dropped us
We giving niggas what the fuck they want
A holocaust, stomping niggas with a Thousand Man March
I ain't living in hell, hell's living in me
That's why I'm always screaming on you fucking emcees
The shit that I quote, float wit the buoyancy of a boat
With the potency of a scorpion sting to the throat
Overdose that's extremely fatal
Doctors in white lab coats scramble for an antidote to save you
You can't breathe, your chest feels painful
Your skin color's going from dark brown to beige-blue
Your whole room's full of angels
All in your ear trying to tell you which God you should pray to
You pray to Jesus, but He don't want to save you
'Cause you unfaithful, so He gives you to Azazel

But look her body is immaculate I'm attackin' it from all positions
Of thinkin' inside my mind-ah
Hopefully it won't be too inappropriate if I walk over there and say
""Excuse me, can I have your number please?

And slid her to the dance floor, now she like ""wow""

You're quicker with the tongue, givin' me rhythm now huh

You still pop shit? I face off like fembots
And I'm the six million motherfuckin' dollar man
With a six million muh'fuckin dollar plan
For thug niggaz and pimp players and drug niggas
Your technique, I sweep under the rug niggas
Out of queens, shit I serve with the fiends and bug niggas
I'm above niggaz, but all in all, I love niggas
Like my man benny rat (uh) showed me the rap game
Told me never to act sane on a record or rap plain
Now the name reign supreme, seen major cream
Rhymes, sicker than lyme disease and gangrene
I'm the most obligated, nigga creatin' havoc

Unobtainable to the brain it's unexplainable what the verse'll do

Y'all heard of me, I pack Macs and crack vertebraes
Leave niggas with third degree burns and back surgery

Pharoahe Monch,"Yo
Truth had me up against the ropes 
And semi-conscious without no boxing skills
Fear of it makes hair on my neck grow like minoxodil
Watchin' the clock is ill when, faced wit the truth
Parallels observing, amateur video tapes of
Twenty-one top notch NYPD cops get ill
Fill they minds not to kill still son, never revealed
True feelings, we speakin' on the truth right now in itself is a healing
See The Creator, created existence and balance
At right angles, unless it was conceived and stated
So whoever shall stray away from right lives wrong
The deliverance of the word false opposite of truth off course
Sure as my slave name sending
Troy Donald Jamerson paves the path, enabling truth
To stay stable and cling to earth!
Sorta similar to the way static electricity sting see
Truth brings light, light refracts off the mirror
Visions of yourself and error could never clearer
The truth is that you ugly, not on the outside
But in the inside on the outside you frontin' you lovely
The discovery of these things and all are well-hidden
But when you in denial of self it is forbidden, that's the truth

In due time we will find

Let the truth be told from young souls that become old
From days spent in the jungle, where must one go
To find it, time is real, we can't rewind it
Out of everybody I met, who told the truth? Time did
We find kids speakin' 'cause it's naturally in us
But the false prophets by tellin' us we born sinners
Venders of hate, got me battlin' my own mind state
At a divine rate, I ain't in this just to rhyme great
See the truth in the thighs of a stripper, the eyes of my nigga
If it's only one, then why should it differ
So constantly I seek it
Wonderin' why I gotta drink a six pack to speak it
Took a picture of the truth and tried to develop it
Had proof, it was only recognized by the intelligent
Took the negative and positive, 'cause niggas got to live
Said I got to get more than I'm given
'Cause truth'll never be heard in religion
After searchin' the world, on the inside what was hidden
It was the truth

Truth, truth, truth, truth, truth, truth
In due time, we will find

Check it, on my neck I still got marks from the nooses
The truth it produces, fear that got niggas on the run like Carl Lewis
The truth is my crew is the smoothest bits of saliva juices like the roots is
More organic than acoustics
Heavenly, what will set you free and kill you in the same breath
That shit you gotta get off your chest before your death, unless
The way you speak is lighter than a pamphlet
'Cause the truth give the words away to the planet goddammit
I ran wit what God planted in my heart and I understand it
To be the bring the light to the dark, breathe some life in this art
This must be the truth (why?) 'cause we keep marchin' on (True)
The truth lay the foundation of what we rockin' on (True)
You can't see it if you blind but we will always prevail (True)
Life is like the open sea, the truth is the wind in our sail
And in the end, our names is on the lips of dying men
If ever crushed in the earth, we always rise again
When the words of lying men sound lush like the sound of a violin
The truth is there, it's just the heart you gotta find it in

You will find
You will find
You will find
You will find

Uhh, no thank you
What are you doin' with that shotgun 

In short was that I had shot him, several times in the head
Mount Sinai, 6:15, pronounced dead
The news reporter said the assailants fled the city
Meanwhile I'm shacked across the street, in some
Shitty-ass hotel, waitin' til things get a little quiet
Dunn I could try to bounce, but now why should I even try it?
The riot that ensued, I viewed bird's-eye
Fifteen floors up behind the curtains in the nude
Took three-hundred and sixty-five to get close to him
Boast to him, roast, when I put the toast to him
Dangerous, the most heinous crimes have been committed
Through painless means, more famous lives have been acquitted
To hell he went, bent, sent, government issues
With my initial in print, ah, we'll never miss you
In the streets, understanding that you made it hard to eat
Complete the cypher, or, make ends meet
Twenty-five years my father spent hard labor you suspended him
From the force, placed his head beneath the pendulum
Peripheral vision now, doorknob shiftin'
Optical illusion or the coke that I'm sniffin'
Think, primal instinct, maybe it's me
Hit the lights must hit the floor simultaneously
Seems as though this is manifested through some amazin' dream
Dazed cops entered the room with guns and lazer beams
But dazed it seems we blast at, one another

Dazed wagglin' my leg, imagine I'm not afraid
Grazed and bruised, amazed at who's surroundin'
Cop guns, cocked back, SWAT teams, astoundin'
From rooftops, troops glock to smack my melon
Felon, Seargenat yellin' for me to come out like Ellen
Propellin' walked through the lobby and the front door
Packin' hand grenades and strapped with see-4
The more swine, the merrier, Harrier jets overhead
Ready to riddle my body with bullets of lead
A dead man walking, destination devil's lair

Bass like an M-80 in your face, cops stop, give us citation
We pause for radio station identification
WAKE UP WAKE UP WAKE UP!

[Tech N9NE]
When I Woke-Up, I got the mic and never chocked up
Busted a verse and all the G's in Cali loc'ed up when I was summoned
Styles were mixed like the Drummonds, Killer Clown is comin
Look around, your town is crumblin
This Big Tech from the midwest, leavin MC's lipless
On The Wake-Up Show, make up no, stories about my shake-up flow
Put me off in a cipher? Potna, you can't fuck wit the sniper
Your flow's premature, clean your dirt diaper
Mic heister, psycho, alpha-schizo
Hypno, chryo-gat flow, guru and ain't nobody tighter
Sway & Tech heard me flow and its sealed
Now I got Swedish women yelling ""Tech N9NE's filled""

[Eminem]
This place is my house, I might as well erase my face wit Withe-out
'cause why'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows (where you at?)
Climped out of a nice house, 
Through the front window and heard this guy shout
""Hey that's my couch, bitch!""
Pull a nine out during a rhyme bout
While I'm rippin this shit, put a clip in it spit five rounds
And murder you hoes worse than flippin a convertible
Nose first wit the top off landin upside-down
You're tied down and duct-taped, fuck rape
I'd rather just hump a slut's leg wit my nuts shaved
And Sway & Tech, two disk jokeys 
Breakin so many friggin needles I wonder if they inject

[Xzibit]
Lo and behold, better than platinum or gold
Yes God bless success, never forsake your soul
Xzibit take control, locked loaded and ready to roll
Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold
'cause your tape sucks, find a new hobby that you can take up
Or listen to my niggas Tech & Sway so you can Wake-Up
The X-man, catch me doin drills in the Danger Room
Big game hunting, from high-noon to the full moon

[Pharoahe Monch]
Wit synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush
From minimum thrusts, bust multiple assualts in small interims
As horrid as Borris Kolaf was
When I cut your neck, leave a little piece of flesh
So the head won't fall off, hauled-off
Sawed-off shotgun blast, he asked
Why did he have to die like cast metal?
O, huh, see now like Omar Credle
We pone pedal at a high resolution 
On the Wake-Up Show wit Sway, Tech and DJ Revolution

[Kool G Rap]
I sway the tech wit the Tech and Sway
Step away, wet and spray, rep the day
Who over debt to pay get swept away
Across the whole board like checker play
When I blaze your whole sect' arrays
Wake-Up Show for those slept away
Niggas that the trey, hit the deck and pray
DJ Revolution, spinnin like lead from out the heck-AK
Tearin your neck away, flood up the street wit bloody decora'
Until the head of jake investigate

[Jayo Felony]
What? Sway can give it to you, but Whatcha Gon' Do wit it
Tech can give it to you, but Whatcha Gon' Do?
Rev can give it to you, but Whatcha Gon' Do wit it
I can give it to you, Wha Wha Wha What What!

[Chino XL]
Yo yo Chino makes the world go 'round
Fuckin up entire record companies like Harrel did to Motown
Vominous talk, poison pen, hominous walk
What flow will I destroy wit this time, the most commonest thought
The drama that's brought, caught us in a midst of sibling rivalry
For instance, there's nothing in existence that can survive wit me
Clone me like sheep, I clean house like Tony Rand-all
Wit style filed for sexual harassment like Tisha Camp-bell
You're wack like Will Smith, your rhyme style is pansy
I fuckin murder your young style like JonBenet Ramsey
Now who the master to beg? Your demo gets passed on the reg'
You shouldn't have been signed if you had a Withe cast on your leg
I'm Wake-Up Show reppin wit Sway & Tech
My tec's like Tekken, the industry weapon
I'm Chino X, bring KRS in

[KRS-One]
De de de de de de da di day, KRS-One comin wit the Tech & Sway
Yo, I rock up the littlest set, and on the biggest set
As ill as it gets I still manage to wiggle your neck wit sweat
Never forget, the bigger the budget the bigger the debt
You gotta be willin to rock in the middle of dry and in the middle of wet
But I'm willin to bet, on a Sway & a Tech
They stay in effect, never been a pain in the neck, they gainin respect
Nevertheless I WRECK YOU, now you know what Sway & Tech do
I'll be back but for now just sackle!

Check it, ye-yeah, ye-yeah
East east, west west, south south..

[chorus: dj hurricane]
I got that east coast connect, west coast connect
Dirty south connect, so show some respect
When my niggaz comin through you see we comin correct
Who are you, what you do, who you tryin to threat?

[xzibit]
I'm the wrong cat to call out; we fall out
The police gon' have some dead bodies to haul out
All out in the open for the world to see
Avire-x to the z-I, be-I-t
V.i.p., you're small time, three on three
Cause you can't ball accurately, tackle the beast
Stomp it down, slap it with heat, bitch behave
Shit, we blaze to make a nigga act his age
I'm tryin to write the phrase that pays
You kick it with gays, dykes, and all type of wackness
Preach what you practice
Here we separate the real niggaz from the actors
A&r's, mc searchin, suck my cactus!
Blackness surround your sight and sound
As xzibit hit you and you hit the ground
My chips ain't never gon' be down, watch me smoke
And flatline the first nigga to cross this line

[chorus]

[gipp]
It's the gipp goodie, we kick the soul slang
To yo' block, or they streets, we all gon' hang
We like to shine and ride, bump corners in our bumper cars
Top down, with the candy paint job
Import export up and down the highway
Old ladies transportin straight through the skyways
In the corner in the five(? ) I got purple haze
Fat knot short sess with the tree ton(? )
These streets we run, rapper refund
You ridin up but we want yo' flows old like girbauds
We hold, everything it takes to create the odes
To north to the west to the south again
If it's war that you want just pull the pin
Rules we don't break 'em, we refuse to bend
If you don't build right you better take yo' ass home
Cause some catch stray bullets all alone

[chorus]

[pharoahe monch]
I got the chevy impala shit, street scholar with
Collarless, japanese aikido with, rottweiler mixed
Top dollar dick now, swallow my whole nut rap
Gun in my mouth, pop shit, still sayin, ""fuck that""
You have to listen, brew, trapped in a tragic addiction
Styles, multiply like japanese mathematicians
Cut cause chaos - my kicks kill criminals
I'm the subliminal adolf
I'm the bomb that's attached to the time of a ticker
Figure or swastika
Quicker to pick a form of execution, pull it
Bullet, to the head instead of eletrocution
The rambunctious, bump in yo' trunk shit
Totally insane, hurricane with pharoahe monch, gipp
Xzibit the west coast (? ? ) (? ? ) we got
New york wearin slippers and the south wearin hoodies

[chorus 3x]

[dj hurricane]
Ye-yeah, uh-huh, ye-yeah
Give it up, uh-huh (dirty south) ye-yeah, ye-yeah
Give it up, uh-huh, give it up, shake it
Uh-huh, kick it (dirty south) uh-huh
Shake it.. uh-huh, shake it
C'mon, give it up (dirty south)

Pharoahe Monch,"Yeah, one for the treble
Two for the bass
Welcome to the great incredible paper chase
Keep your boots laced if you want to keep pace

Oh no
Niggas ain't scared to hustle
It's been seven days, the same clothes
Ask them originals cause they know
Mos Def, Nate Dogg, and Pharoahe
Step away from the mic they too cold
The funk might fracture your nose

Say my name, say my name
Observe how I stake my claim
I independently laid down and played my game
My own two raise my flame
'Cause dick ridin' ain't my thing
I earned what they said I wouldn't
I got it the way they said I couldn't
But now I'm gettin' it and their whole grill is crooked
Mad cause I'm getting caked out from my bookings
When ya'll was askin' permission I just stepped up and took it
What!? The kid's better buy my rookie card now
'Cause after this year the price ain't comin' down
And if you got a joint bubbling then get money now
'Cause in a minute there's gonna be some real trouble coming out
Just a warning, as usual some cats won't heed it
The hard headed always gotta feel it to believe it
It's a shame that jealous gays is too short to see it
But when their face hit the cement, they nod in agreement
We could play nice and decent
Or dirty like the 7-1 precinct
Call it a day or make it a long evening
You keep on scheming, making me some more reasons
To have the women in your mama's church screamin' ""Lord Jesus!""
Harder than ya'll cause I'm smarter than ya'll
I know that deep down it's got to be bothering ya'll
Pay attention, watch fly gon' get larger than ya'll
Put your pride on the rocks, make you swallow it all
The mathematic problem for y'all, it just get harder to solve
Every day that the saga evolve
The do or die stay rumbling and bumbling hard
And when we move, we ain't got no discussion at all
East coast on your neck and you ain't shrugging it off
Try to bullyfoot and end up stumbling off
I'm Daddy Brooklyn, y'all niggas are the sons of New York
Getting spanked when there's too much trouble to talk
Respect mine

Oh no
Look at who they let in the back door
From Long Beach to Brooklyn they know
We rock from the east to west coast
Queens salute (they know)
Step away from the mic they too cold
The funk might fracture your nose

Very contagious raps should be trapped in cages
Through stages and wackness, foul rats is blazin'
And it amazes me how you claim thug,
But go two ways without Skytell pagers
I'm intellectual, pass more essays
Than motorcade police parades through East L.A.
More beef then deli's
Thus what I vent is just, what you lust to vent is irrel'
Halleluja, Pharoahe marching through ya
Maintain the same frame of mind school ya
Get the picture, sit ya, seat ya, greet ya with scriptures
I'ma quit the rip ya reach ya
Pharoahe and Mos is verbal osmosis
Coast to coast, we boast to be the most explosive here
Ferocious, the lyrical prognosis
The dose is just leaving you mentally unfocused here
Emcee's just come on 'round
You're the next contestants on ""catch a beat down""
Don't be hesitant sound cracks to sediment
It's evident we're medicine for your whole town
Sky's the limit, game's definite when I'm in it
All window's is tinted, how you seeing me when I'm in it
Rap, we got it on lock man, stop that
Put that mic back down, boy, drop that
Pharoahe's slows blows shows like afros
We hate ya'll though
That's why Nate Dogg goes

Cause when I get beyond enemy lines
I might snipe that ass like John Kennedy's mind
Thou shall not get caught, that's the remedy
Disinfect gun wounds on my last bottle of Hennessy
Bleed to let the seeds remember my memories
It's killed or be killed here son that's the penalty

Hybrid
I've been diggin in crates ever since I was livin in space
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits
I mastered numerology, big band theology, performed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology
Invented the mic to so I can start blessin it
Chin-checkin' kids to make my point like an impressionist
Many men have tried to shake us
But I twist mic chords like double helixes to show them what I'm made of
I buckle knees like leg braces,
Cast a spell of instrumentalist on all of you MC's who hate us
So you can try on, leave you without a shoulder to cry on
From now to infinity, let icons be bygones
I fire bombs, ghostly notes haunt this
I tried threats, but moved on to a promise
I stomp shit with or without an accomplice
And run the gauntlet with whoever that wants this

High voltage
The unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringin you up and takin you down
High voltage
Comin at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

Akira, I've put a kink in the backbones, of clones, with microphones
Never satisfied my rhyme jones
Spraying bright day over what you might say
My blood types krylon, Technicolor type A
On highways ripe with road rage
Cages a win, cages a tin, that bounce all around
Surround sound
Devouring the scenes
Subliminal gangrene paintings, over all the same things
Sing songs karaoke copy bullshit
Break bones verbally with sticks and stones tactics
Fourth dimension, compact convention
Write rhymes with ease while the track stands at attention
Meant to put you away, with the pencil
Pistol, official, sixteen line, a rhyme missile
While you risk your all
I pick out at your flaws
Spittin' rah blah, blah, blah you can say you saw

High voltage
The unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringin you up and takin you down
High voltage
Comin at you from every side
High voltage

Who's the man, demanding you hand over your Land Rover
The man's bolder than the Pharoahe when he jams you glance over
I am visclorosous, the most ferocious
When I spy my third eye, it's extremely high voltage

That's why I need ruby quartz glasses,
'Cause when I glance there's a chance
That I might blast the masses
Subliminals transmitted through piano
Integrated in flow, calculated to nano

I use skills when I need pleas sees the rhyme
I hear when I bleed as I proceed through time
I walk through walls and the inanimate obstacles
By inducing the reduction of cells and molecules

I bring the knowledge the you swallow a state that's a hologram
I botch your head, fatten your lip like collagen
The telepath deliver verses with no postage
Pharoahe Monch, Mike Shinoda, we are high voltage

High voltage
The unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringin you up and takin you down
High voltage

My vendetta in this form of musical song
Is to enlighten and brighten the mind through instrument and rhyme
And fix those inadequate flows that don't adapt
Makin' snacks on wax plates for DJs to scratch

Fast slash, cross hatch slash, cross patch
Every word of mine will be verbally so tight to match
That or that I hit you harder than Caterpillar trucks
In the lab where we collaborate or matter will erupt

From a, music martyr, bust mortar, break the order
Torch your sound texture, fire water's in my aura
Your future forefather, your new wave slave wrapped in chains and amulets
And hard to earn assets

Yo, niggas game playin' but not name sayin'
My aim's sprayin', I get mine that's why you stay waitin'
And vacatin', whether you know it or not, I'ma blow up the spot
If you owe me a lot, I'ma show up with Glocks

And you're still wet, pull up your socks, suspend the art
Sizzle like woks, underground spots, from the city to the boondocks
Bounce, double wishbone suspension like shocks

I spit fire satire, indeed bleed, phenomenal demographics
Broadcast my rhyme forecast to eager addicts
Pave a path many can't outlast
Who these cats who blast gats rehearsin' lines for a movie cast?
But as a central, blaze the track engage
Instamatic sporadic insight pays for days
With their sickening floss, flip on tracks like Dominique Dawes
Pause, date back, flows is gettin' flashback

My existence, spirits in animated film
Three-dimensionally roller scoped
With cloakin' devices, skates, stogies and a motor boat
I hold the Pope for ransom, it's
The handsomest, assassinatin' Satan 
Leavin' the world Marilyn Manson-less
I'm in the streets like Sesame
The recipe - to kill, attain da mil/DeMille like Cecille B.
The rest'll be the aftermath, the most got statistics
Pharoahe Monch, Steve Post about to lift it

I gotta get mine, give it back so you can get yours

I gotta get mine, give it back so you can get yours
Yo yo uhh what

I'm leavin' your staff mated, makin' these crabs hate it
I lotta fags rate it and thought I got stagnated
I'm not some rap nigga that you're dyin to meet
Just another hungry brother real hungry and tryin' to eat
And in the streets you better rely on your feet
Babies is feelin' iron, cryin' to sleep
Plus the government is supplying the heat
They goin' psychotic in prison 'cause of the economic additions
Plus sex and drugs in the bleachers

3-4 come up, run up in beefcake gun butt-ups
Crush truck chains, the wiry gold frames
Chains sums up, the dollars, white collar, blue Range
Eat my dust up, ten in the bucket in the left lane gainin' momentum
Cum sendin' comers, fair game, a lot of sumtin' sumtin'
All in or nothin', silence the sufferin'
Can't stand the strugglin', some resume games to stain jugglin'
I muscled in and scribbled my name

Belittle your brain, the true grain riddle your frame
Got you forfeitin' the bitch by the middle of the game
Hostile, impossible to stop below the free
Buck em down, shook em nothin' at the top of the key
Prince, I'm nippatant, magnificent moves, strategic
Smash joints, leavin' the track paraplegic
Repeat it for those who need it, niggas catch the vibe
Fish 'n grits, hot sauce, forever embedded inside

So I can switch my residence, get a truck and a Lex
Fuck a check, I no longer have to wait for 'em
I made a couple ends, lost a couple friends
I light a blunt 'cause never will the struggle end
So you can judge a nigga, but you ain't got it, you ain't in the role
So you really can't budge a nigga' you oughta love a nigga
For the fact that it's my world and my life but still I'm a rugged nigga
They say you buggin' nigga, fuck it, I'm a thuggin' nigga
You talkin bullshit then kick it with another nigga
I got a bigger bed and I need a cover nigga
And I ain't got friends - I got enemies
So if they with me, then that means they my brother nigga

Is a blunt to the head, a prayer for the dead
Run around hustlin', scared of the feds
They said death is eternal sleep
But the only thing is you ain't really sure if you prepared for the bed
So often we get merked in the head, instead of big money
They got big momma hurtin' instead
My life is makin' the verse, but the handcuffs
The bullpens, the jail cells is makin' it worse
Tell mom I don't go to the church, tell Oc' I don't' go to mas
I blow blunts, hold guns, and I'ma be right there when the soldiers'll march
I play the part, and my heart seem colder than March
But on the flipside of things, it's still warmer than June
I have talks with the Lord and he'll be callin' me soon, what

With skeletons in her closet, traded herself for drugs and stayed

Became alcoholics, in the fetal position bent over toilets
And calling for earl with pains in their bladders so people listen

And if I got it straight shit, what if it's straight?

Battin' her eyelashes, finaglin' her baby arm
And all up in my space, next day I'm on her myspace top eight
We contemplating a hot date
Got poolside flicks for the cool fly blogs
With the rules I kicked about the yuletide logs
She like low cut jeans with the real high clogs
And dig music so much she got two iPods
I'm tryna make it to third base like A-rod
Threw a couple of Guinness stout back just to stay
So qu'est-ce que c'est, now let's just say
I'm tryna get horizontal like yesterday, she say

The sound of provocative thinking the pieces of puzzles

Sheet covers her face, paramedics are leavin'
Her eyes are closed, it's apparent she's not breathin'
I'm a little confused about what it is I'm seein'

Plus, there's a naked man on my lawn
Police in the livin' room with all of they guns drawn
Out and the last thing I remember is
Uh, last thing I remember is

I received a text page from Julio
Who expressed that I left my cell phone in the studio
Right underneath the disc with the Pro Tools
Next to a six pack of O'Douls and some soul food

Yeah, and I was on my way home
Exit the expressway to use the payphone
But fuck it, 'cause my wife isn't back from her trip
I sneak ? into the house
And she'll never expect it, except that

Told me go take my revenge
Killin' him won't make it go away

I tied his hands behind his back to the night stand, fast
Ropes made bruises on his light skinned ass
See, I can play games too
Yeah, that's what I told him when he came to

Now look, see what the game and the fame do?
Made a deranged mind out of someone in your same crew
Fuck man, we grew up together
Run DMC, tougher than leather

With the same outfits, forty deuce
Takin' flicks like what, shit
Why did you fuck my wife, man?
You should've took my life, man

I switched the gun into my right hand
The sweat accumulated on his forehead, I saw red, he said
Now was it worth it, man?
Was it everythin' you imagined? Was it perfect?

Told me go take my revenge
Killin' him won't make it go away

Took you to be my lawfully wedded wife
To have, to hold, to love and cherish but
Death did us apart, what a coincidence
Now, perhaps the police will be convinced

That it was an accident
If I'm accurate and careful with the evidence
This motherfucker trespassin' up my residence
And to believe those vile set a precedence
From the start I should have been obvious, I never did

Prevalent, the wicked debauchery and decadence
Was carried out with such masterful excellence
And this is the stick where you rip my heart
It was natural to transform murder into art

And the weight of my conscience would knowingly carry
365 days to the date that we was married
Thoughts of how would achieve the murder would vary
We're closer than ever, together we'll be buried 'cause

Evil eyes that bide, how they go
You ? lied to me, what did they see?
I just lost control, had to let you go
I cry but slowly you try, so slowly you die

Buried alive in the grave, too exhausted to climb out
Before dirt was tossed on me, come to find out
Old friend of mine she sleepin' with committed the crime
In the past three years, switched identities six times

And all the while I'm devoted to love and loyalty
They plotted on my publishin' checks and royalties
She's thinkin' it's true love, he's scammin' her for the quop
? to devise my own intuitive plot

Put the pros on him, launched the probe on him
Now harm him, pen him, get him exactly where I wanted him
Cornered him, now his mission is aborted
You are about to be professionally extorted

Guess who you're 'bout to murder tonight?
Miss pretty brown eyes while she sleeps under the moonlight
Do it and bounce, the keys to the crib, you'll find under the mat
In the front of the house, just do it, word out

You ? lied to me, what did they see?
I just lost control, had to let you go

Never give somethin' that's not respectable
Never spit somethin that's not incredible
Never sold my soul for numbers left of the decimal
I done fucked up movements like cerebral palsy
You don't know me, don't pause me, I'll throw lead at you
Mean I earned e'ry stripe and you know it

Before shots land on your head and push it forward

I organize a street massacre
You haters know I broke bread with at least half of ya
Out of town, hundred pound weed trafficker
Got niggaz rockin' Long Beach fitteds in East Africa
I been stabbed, I been shot, a imperfect part
Like my Grape Street niggaz I got a Purple Heart

Individuals in order to force people to adhere to one way of life
An independently funded organization called (garbled speech)
Hired 100 assassins to infiltrate the headquarters where files were kept
Of these 100, 97 were captured, tortured, and executed
Only three remained
The third of which was said to own an arsenal
That would rival an entire city's police force
The second was rumored was to be able to move throughout space and time
And the first

Fasten your seatbelts for the last of the three assassins on Earth
The first flashin' her purse with a heat stealth
They call me Jean McCoy, the beast in me employed
To ploy deplorable through audibled, destructive actions attractive to Coy
Hey, pass to the Troy after, I'm passing your life over
He'll deliver it through river sticks, Hades, I'm cold, deliver it lady
My flow is limited, pray me some craze, whispering
""Stay on ya toes villains"", it's Grae and your day's whittling
Blistering lines packed in six stick to spine
Rap with a sick mind trapped in thick bitch frame
Drug you with strychnine and I drinks you drunk and it's my kidney you dick
Brain?I'm just itching to slit veins
Stitch lines! Rip game!? Fuck yo lives
Sick range visions nigga, kick rocks or kick rhymes until the pain?
(Liquor it or liver) Sippin' it, sippin' it like Capri Sun
Ignorant as ever, she clever, equivalent be none
A ball breaker, call fakers out with passion
You got the gall bastard to brawl with the broad bashers?
The ball's in your court, pass it!
You're worn in four faster than acid
With AIDS slapped on the back of a Kardashian
The wall crasher, you're all in the forecast
The gas pour in the corridors racking your doors blacking out
Catch Grae backing out the back door, cacklin'
Still make it back to the bar for last call

They ask me why I'm highly regarded, this god body probably
Monch is a mixture of Marcus Garvey, Miles Davis, and Bob Marley
Never skateboard slang like ""gnarly""
More like, we in our whip on our way to the top like Charles Barkley
You are hardly prepared to spar with a marksman spot me
I'm gambit with the ace of spades, I'm masterin' archery
Vermicular, particularly the vernacular
Specifically the fits so when I spit it's spectacular and accurate
When I attack I'm more like Acura
Flip Bloomberg the bird, bitch, more blood than Blacula
More Christian scriptures encrypted with backwards vernacular
But sicker than most of Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction
I am, that nigga for real
Per capita smackin' the next rapper that uses the term ""swag"" or thereafter
These three assassins get to ass whippin'
Prepare to for a professional ass that can shape shifts
Spit, hollow tip clips mainly
Sick, ain't he? (Mind control)
Make you shoot your best friend in the face, Dick Cheney
My life is like a documentary film
Depicted in black and white, flicks grainy (Geronimo!)
I'm on Guantanamo Bay takin' pics in a Captain Morgan pose
With my left foot on a pile of detainees screamin' ""we are renegades!""
Fuck you, pay me

I be ridin' around with a stripper slash Burlesque model
I make it pop like my cock in Durex condom
I'm a, opposite artist I find irony in goin
From bein' like a stone in the grass to rockin' the Garden
The same irony as goin' from fully automatic in the backyard
To havin' the whole machine behind me
I take my Australian bitches and show some other thangs
She know my stroke is deadly so she gave me bloody brain
Don't try to get familiar, if I don't feel you in person
I'll flip the script and I'll accidentally kill you on purpose
The baddest when I'm flailing, I got so many furs
PETA gonna paint splash me when they see me, no matter what I'm wearin
Your bitch bout to open up, sniff some blow off of my dick
Guess you could say she on my coconuts
I'm on point like Chris Paul
You on point like an Atlantic City hooker that licks balls
I'm bout to flip in this bitch like Dominique Dawes
And shut shit down like a car when it stalls
I am the deadliest rapper, you claimin' that you flow like water
But really ya'll niggas Evian backwards
Marshall hit the jackpot with this flow that I got
I know when I'm hot
It's my show to stop holdin' my crotch
