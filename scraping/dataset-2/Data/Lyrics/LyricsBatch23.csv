Carmen McRae,"Is there anyone around who cannot see
It's the well-known runaround you're giving me?
I suppose you'll tell me I'm all wrong.
It's a bitter pill to take,
Coming from you,
Though I've made a big mistake,
What can I do?
I don't know what makes me string along.

[Chorus]
I don't want you,
But I hate to lose you,
You've got me in between
The devil and the deep blue sea.
I forgive you,
Cause I can't forget you,
You've got me in between
The devil and the deep blue sea.

I ought to cross you off my list,
But when you come knocking at my door
Fate seems to give my heart a twist,
And I come running back for more.

I should hate you,
But I guess I love you,
You've got me in between
The devil and the deep blue sea.",Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea,1993
Carmen McRae,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon,1993
Carmen McRae,"There goes my young intended
The thing has ended
Regrets are vain
I'll never find another half so sweet
And we'll never meet again
I got impatient
Told him goodbye
Sad eyes out in the rain

He was too good to me
How can I get along now
So close he stood to me
Everything seems all wrong now
He would have brought me the sun
Making me smile, that was his fun

When I was mean to him
He'd never say go away now
I was a Queen to him
Who's gonna make me gay now
It's only natural that I'm blue
He was too good to be true",He Was Too Good to Me,1993
Carmen McRae,"My story is much to sad to be told
But practically everything leaves me totally cold
The only exception I know is the case
When I'm out on a quiet spree, fighting vainly the old ennui
And I suddenly turn and see your fabulous face

I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you

Some get a kick from cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
That would bore me terrifically too
But I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time I see you standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to me, you obviously don't adore me
I get no kick in a plane, flying too high with some guy in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do, yet I get a kick out of you
I get a kick every time I see you standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to me, you obviously don't adore me
I get no kick in a plane, flying too high with some guy in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do, yet I get a kick out of you

I get a kick out of you",I Get a Kick Out of You,1993
Carmen McRae,"I was doing all right
Nothing but rainbows in my sky
I was doing all right
'Til you came by

Had no cause to complain
Life was as sweet as apple pie
Never noticed the rain
'Til you came by

But now whenever you're away
I can't sleep nights and suffer all the day
I just sit and wonder
If love isn't one big blunder

But when you hold me tight
Tingling all through, I feel somehow
I was doing all right
But I'm doing better than ever now

But now whenever you're away
I can't sleep nights and suffer all the day
I just sit and wonder
If love isn't one big blunder

But when you hold me tight
Tingling all through, I feel somehow
I was doing all right
But I'm doing, yes, I'm doing
I'm doing much better than ever now

",I Was Doing All Right,1993
Carmen McRae,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this: a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

When we were young last night",Last Night When We Were Young,1993
Carmen McRae,"My romance doesn't have to have a moon in the sky
My romance doesn't need a blue lagoon standing by
No month of may, no twinkling stars
No hide away, no softly guitars

My romance doesn't need a castle rising in Spain
Nor a dance to a constantly surprising refrain
Wide awake i can make my most fantastic dreams come true

My romance doesn't need a thing but you
My romance doesn't need a thing but you",My Romance,1993
Carmen McRae,"Because you're mine the brightest star I see looks down
My love, and envies me because you're mine
Because you're mine because you're mine
The breeze that hurries by becomes a melody
And why, because you're mine, because you're mine
I only know for as long as I may live
I'll only live for the kiss that you alone may give me
And when we kiss that isn't thunder dear
It's only my poor heart you hear, and it's applause
Because you're mine! because you're mine!
 
Because you're mine the brightest star I see looks down
My love, and envies me because you're mine
Because you're mine because you're mine
The breeze that hurries by becomes a melody
And why, because you're mine, because you're mine

Carmen McRae,"Don't ever leave me, now that you're here
Here is where you belong
Everything seems so right, when you're near
When you're away, it's all wrong

I'm so dependent when I need comfort
I always run to you
Don't ever leave me, 'cause if you do
I'll have no one to run to

Carmen McRae,"I try to keep you out of my heart
But somehow I find
Trying to keep you out of my heart
I'm out of my mind
I tell myself ""I'm through with you
And I'll having nothing more to do with you""
I stay away, but every day
I'm just foolin myself

Tell my friends that I don't care
I shrug my shoulders at the whole affair
But all know it is't so
I'm just foolin myself

And ev'ry time I pass
And see my face in a looking glass
I tip my hat and say
""How do you do, you fool
You're trowing your life away""
I'm acting gay
I'm acting proud
And every time I see you in a crowd
I may pretend
But in the end
I'm just foolin myself",Foolin' Myself,1993
Carmen McRae,"I'm riding high and I approve of the trend,
Look what I've found me,
I've got myself a gentleman friend.
The sun is kind, seems like it never will end
When he's around me,
I'm referring to my gentleman friend.

His kind of kissin' 
Suits me to a tee,
What I was missin'
In the used-to-be
I'm getting frequently!

And so goodbye to cares that hound me,
Is it any wonder that I wanna laugh and sing and cry?
Gonna love him till I die,
My gentleman friend.

Carmen McRae,"Life is just a bowl of cherries
Don't take it serious
Life's too mysterious

You work, you save, you worry so
But you can't take your dough
When you go, go, go

Keep repeating, it's the berries
The strongest oak must fall
The best things in life to you were just loaned
So how can you lose what you never owned

Life is just a bowl of cherries
So live and laugh at it all

Keep repeating, it's the berries
You know the strongest oak has got to fall
The sweet things in life to you were just loaned
So how can you lose what you never owned

And think nothing of it, you can't do without it
There's no two ways about it
You live and you laugh at it all",Life Is Just a Bowl of Cherries,1993
Carmen McRae,"Once upon a summertime, if you recall
We stopped beside a little flower stall
A bunch of bright forget-me-nots was all I'd let you buy me
Once upon a summertime, just like today
We laughed the happy afternoon away
And stole a kiss in every street cafe
You were sweeter than the blossom on the tree
I was as proud as any girl could be
As if the mayor had offered me the key to Paris
Now, another wintertime has come and gone
The pigeons feeding in the square have flown
But I'll remember when the vespers chimed
You loved me once

Carmen McRae,"I have almost ev'ry thing a human could desire,
Cars and houses, bear-skin rugs to lie before my fire
But there's something missing,
Something isn't there,
It seems I'm never kissing the one whom I care for.
I want Something To Live For
Someone to make my life an adventurous dream
Oh, what wouldn't I give for 
Someone who'd take my life 
And make it seem gay as they say it ought to be.
Why can't I have love like that brought to me?
My eye is watching the noon crowds 
Searching the promenades seeking a clue
To the one who will someday be my 
Something To Live For.

Carmen McRae,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Carmen McRae,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, just for you only,
Why haven't you seen it?
I'm all for you, body and soul!

I spent my days in longing
And wondering why, why it's me that you're wronging?
I tell you that I mean it
I'm all for you, body and soul!

I can't believe it, it's hard to conceive it
That you turn away romance
Are you pretending? Because it looks like the ending
Unless I could have one more chance to prove dear...

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours just for the taking
I would gladly surrender,
Surrender myself to you, body and soul!

You know I'm yours, I'm yours for just the taking
I would gladly surrender, myself to you

Carmen McRae,"A foggy day, in London town
It had me low, and it had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
The British Museum, had lost it's charm

How long I wondered, could this thing last
But the age of miracles, it hadn't past
And suddenly, I saw you standing right there
And in foggy London town, the sun was shining everywhere",A Foggy Day [Live],1994
Carmen McRae,"What good is sitting, alone in your room?
But come, hear the music play!
Life is a cabaret, old chum!
Come to the cabaret!
Put down your knitting, your book and your broom
It is time for a holiday
Life is a cabaret, old chum!

Come to the cabaret!
Come taste the wine
Come hear the band 
Come blow that horn
Start celebrating
Right this way your table's waiting
What good's permitting some prophet of doom?
To wipe every smile away
Life is a cabaret, old chum!
So come to the cabaret!

I used to have this girlfriend known as Elsie
With whom I shared for sordid rooms in Chelsea
She wasn't what you call a blushing flower
As a matter of fact she rented by the hours
The day she died the neighbours
Came to snicker her
Well, that is what comes from 
Too much pills and liquor

But when I saw her laid down like  a queen
She was the happiest corpes I'd ever seen
I think of Elsie till this very day
I remember how she'd turned to me and say
What good is sitting all alone in your room?
Come hear the music play
Life is a cabaret, old chum!
Come to the cabaret!

And as for me 
And as for me
I made my mind up back in Chelsea
When I go I am going like Elsie
Start by admitting
From cradle to doom
It isn't that long a stay 
Life is a cabaret, old chum!
It's only a cabaret, old chum!
And I love a cabaret!",Cabaret,1994
Carmen McRae,"Gee, but it's tough to be broke kid
It's not a joke kid, it's a curse,
My luck is changing, it's gotten from
Simply rotten to something worst

Who knows, someday I will win too
I'll begin to reach my pride
Now, that I see what our end is
All can spend is just my time

I can't give you anything but love, baby
That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby, dream a while

I never wink back at fireflies
But now that the stars are in your eyes

Or candlelight on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low

Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark

Then there'll be, so much misery,

The maestro took bow after bow

With distant gay traces
That used to be there you could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day

To tempt me to madness!
I thought for a while that your poignant smile was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me.

Ah yes! I was wrong
Again,
I was wrong.

Life is lonely again,
And only last year everything seemed so sure.
Now life is awful again,
A troughful of hearts could only be a bore.
A week in Paris will ease the bite of it,
All I care is to smile in spite of it.

While yet you are still burning inside my brain.

I didn't know what day it was
You held my hand
Warm like the month of May it was
And I'll say it was grand

Grand to be alive, to be young
To be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch
Hear your voice say, ""I'm all your own""

I wanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes

I can hear a lark somewhere, begin to sing about it,
There's no love song finer, but how strange the change from major to
Minor,

And candle lights on little corner tables

The beauty that is Spring's

These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

Alone where we have walked together

Carmen McRae,"Once I lived the life of a millionaire
Spending my money, honey, I didn't care
Taking my friends out for a mighty good time
I drank that good gin, champagne and wine

Just as soon as my money got low
I couldn't find no friends and I had no place to go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it till that eagle grins

'Cause I found out that nobody wants you
Nobody wants you when they find out
That you're down and out
In your pocket, there's not not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

Just let you get back up on your feet again
Here they all come telling you their your old long lost friend
And this I wanna tell you and about it I have no doubt
Nobody wants you, nobody needs you
Nobody wants when you're down and out

Across the plains of Texas from sea to shining sea

Of his two door Chevy Cavalier
And the other one was runnin'
Through the waves of her sandy hair

It was well past twelve
When they pulled into her parents drive
She didn't think anyone was watchin'
When she kissed him goodnight, busted

Her momma told her
She was grounded for a year
Her daddy said that boy
Ain't welcome around here

She ran up to her room screamin' down those stairs
You can say what you wanna say
Lock me up, throw the key away
But if this is really fate then love will wait, love will wait

Two months later her momma
Finally let her off the hook
She said, ?I'm headin' uptown
To return a few library books?

But she climbed in the Cavalier
Sittin' at the Amoco station
He told her time don't matter
Love was worth the waitin', a love sweet, oh yeah

Her momma told her
She was grounded for a year
Her daddy said that boy
Ain't welcome around here

She ran up to her room screamin' down those stairs
You can say what you wanna say
Lock me up, throw the key away
But if this is really fate then love will wait, oh yeah

Now there's a little white house
On the edge of a country lake
And daddy's workin' on that
Rusty old Chevy in the driveway

The kids are playin' with the dog
Throwin' frisbee in the front yard
And mama's sittin' on that front porch
Swayin', starin' at that car where it all started

Her momma told her
She was grounded for a year
Her daddy said that boy
Ain't welcome around here

She ran up to her room screamin' down those stairs
You can say what you wanna say
Lock me up, throw the key away

A tall cool glass of Mama's lemonade
Sold from a stand that me and my sister made

Playing cops and robbers and the Civil War
We'd all meet up at the swimming hole
With marshmallow sticks and our homemade fishing poles

Knowing I was in above my head 
For all that I could see I never saw the truth. 
Now I'm alone. 
  
Heaven only knows how much I'm missing you, 
Knowing I had heaven in my hands. 
  
And there will be tears, 
Tears are mixed with rain. 
Keeper of my flame. 
  
Time and tide is on my side, 
It stands forever. 
There will be nights of love 
And, yes, there will be tears. 
  
I will not sleep tonight. 
There will be tears tonight. 
I will not sleep tonight. 
There will be tears. 
  
The silent telephone, the turning of the key. 
You're still inside of me, I'm not ashamed. 
For all that I can do, I can't forget your face. 
I call your name. 
  
Heaven only knows what I've been crying for, 
What I'm crying for. 
And all I've done to keep this love alive. 
  
Even through my tears, 
Tears are mixed with rain. 
Keeper of my flame. 
  
I will pray you're on my side, 
We stand forever. 
There will be nights of love 
And, yes, there will be tears. 
  
I will not sleep tonight (oh oh). 
There will be tears tonight. 
I will not sleep tonight (oh). 
There will be. 
  
Soon there will be tears 
Rolling down my world. 
Keeper of my flame. 
  
Time and tide is on my side, 
It stands forever. 
There will be nights of love 
And, yes, there will be tears

And blinking, step into the sun
There's more to see than can ever be seen
More to do than can ever be done

Through the sapphire sky
Keeps great and small on the endless round

And it moves us all
Through despair and hope
Through faith and love

Carmina Cabrera,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find 
In the windmills of your mind!",Les Moulins de Mon Coeur,2005

Invento o cais
Invento mais que a solidão me dá

Invento lua nova a clarear
Invento o amor
E sei a dor de me lançar

Eu queria ser feliz
Invento o mar

Eu quero mais
Tenho o caminho do que sempre quis

E um saveiro pronto pra partir
Invento o cais
E sei a vez de me lançar

Why do I only feel hate
Why did you do this to me

You touched my innocent skin
You said it wasn't wrong

I wish that you would feel my pain

I kill you in my thought
I strangle you in my dreams

Carnal Forge,"I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
By becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take!

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
By becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

And I know I may end up failing too
But I know you were just like me with someone disappointed in you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
By becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Carnaval de Mia,"Por la esquina del viejo barrio lo vi pasar
Con el tumbao' que tienen los guapos al caminar
Las manos siempre en los bolsillos de su gabán
Pa' que no sepan en cuál de ellas lleva el puñal

Usa un sombrero de ala ancha de medio lao
Y zapatillas por si hay problemas salir volao'
Lentes oscuros pa' que no sepan qué está mirando
Y un diente de oro que cuando rie se ve brillando

Como a tres cuadras de aquella esquina una mujer
Va recorriendo la acera entera por quinta vez
Y en un zaguán entra y se da un trago para olvidar
Que el día está flojo y no hay clientes pa' trabajar

Un carro pasa muy despacito por la avenida
No tiene marcas pero toos' saben ques' policia uhm
Pedro Navaja las manos siempre dentro el gabán
Mira y sonríe y el diente de oro vuelve a brillar

Mientras camina pasa la vista de esquina a esquina
No se ve un alma está desierta toa' la avenida
Cuando de pronto esa mujer sale del zaguán
Y Pedro Navaja aprieta un puño dentro 'el gabán

Mira pa' un lado mira pal' otro y no ve a nadie
Y a la carrera pero sin ruido cruza la calle
Y mientras tanto en la otra acera va esa mujer
Refunfuñando pues no hizo pesos con qué comer

Mientras camina del viejo abrigo saca un revolver, esa mujer
Iba a guardarlo en su cartera pa' que no estorbe
Un treinta y ocho esmithanhueson del especial
Que carga encima pa' que la libre de todo mal

Y Pedro Navaja puñal en mano le fue pa' encima
El diente de oro iba alumbrando
Toa' la avenida, se le hizo facil
Mientras reia el puñal le hundía sin compasión
Cuando de pronto sonó un disparo como un cañon

Y Pedro Navaja cayó en la acera mientras veía, a esa mujer
Que revolver en mano y de muerte herida ahí le decía
Yo que pensaba hoy no es mi día estoy salá
Pero pedro navaja tu estas peor, no estas en na

Y creanme gente que aunque hubo ruido nadien salió
No hubo curiosos, no hubo preguntas nadie lloró
Sólo un borracho con los dos cuerpos se tropezo
Cojio el revolver, el puñal, los pesos y se marchó
Y tropezando se fue cantando desafinao'
El coro que aqui les traje y da el mensaje de mi cancion

La vida te da sorpresas. sorpresas te da la vida ay dios
Pedró Navajas matón de esquina
Quien a hierro mata, a hierro termina

La vida te da sorpresas
Sorpresas te da la vida ay dios
Valiente pescador, al anzuelo que tiraste
En vez de una sardina, un tiburón enganchaste

La vida te da sorpresas
Sorpresas te da la vida, ay dios
Ocho millones de historias tiene la ciudad de Nueva York

La vida te da sorpresas
Sorpresas te da la vida, ay dios
Como decía mi abuelita
El que último rie, se rie mejor

La vida te da sorpresas
Sorpresas te da la vida, ay dios
Cuando lo manda el destino
No lo cambia ni el mas bravo
Si necesitas un martillo del cielo te caen los clavos

La vida te da sorpresas
Sorpresas te da la vida, ay dios
De barrio cuidao en la acera
Cuidao camara que no corre vuela

A petición de tu orgullo me iré
Aunque eres mi necesidad, te dejó

Respirar tu aliento
Me voy pero te llevo

Atendiendo a tu razón, me marcho
A petición de tu orgullo, me voy

Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away

If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

Goodbye everybody I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth

For me
For me

Carnival in Coal,"Screams break the silence
Waking from the dead of night
Vengeance is boiling
He's returned to kill the light
Then when he's found who he's looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him

Bark at the moon

Years spent in torment
Buried in a nameless grave
Now he has risen
Miracles would have to save
Those that the beast is looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him

Bark at the moon

They cursed and buried him
Along with shame
And thought his timeless soul had gone
In empty burning Hell-unholy one
But now he's returned to prove them wrong

Howling in shadows
Living in a lunar spell
He finds his heaven
Spewing from the mouth of hell

And when he finds who he's looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him

Return me to the womb

And the punishment is death
I wish you had left me unborn
I shit my pants as I wait for the reaper
Lie in fetal position
Tears stream down my cheeks
As I call out for my mother
And say an act of contrition
We'll fight this war with germs and atoms
Destroy our only home
Our mutated descendants battle the next
With sticks and stones
Are we not savages
Innately destined to maim and kill?
Blame it on the environment
Heredity or evolution we're still responsible
Our intelligence may progress
At geometric rates
Yet socially we remain belligerent neonates

For a special rendez-vous
To see a man of miracles
And all that he can do

I checked in at reception
Put my hat onto my lap
And when he walked in dressed in white
I had a heart attack

First I caught my breath, and ran
For endless observation
In the hands of Superman

Caro Emerald,"I know that he's mine - Caro Emerald
Three o'clock on a late Sunday-morning
The candles have burned to their end
Found the pictures we've taken, and now I'm awaking, and sleeped my invisible friend
So I'm staring to the hands of my wall-clock
Seems like both of us just hanging round
Got no-one to want me, and nothing to hold, my body needs what he don't have

Without him
I really don't mind
A little bit lonely
He'll make up in time
As long as he loves me
He'll answers his crime
The door stays wide open
I know that he's mine

The tracks of my tears keep on freezing
I'm melting the cold in the halls
Feel like I'm drowning, there's no-one around, and now I'm just climbing the walls
Perhaps if I played the seductress
A passionate woman or gall
He'd be there in a minute, the heat won't diminish, I'd wear nothing more than a smile

Without him
I really don't mind
A little bit lonely
He'll make up in time
As long as he loves me

Charlie keeps singing that chanson
Your words always makes so much sense
And though they're in French, I've got no defense, I know that I'm reaching the end
The rumors keep flying around me
It's you I refuse to believe
He's right from the corner, he knows that I'm home now, and nobody calls me naive

Caro Emerald,"Hey handsome have you got the time
I've been watching you since the moment you arrived
A white suit from London, and shoes from Paris
Don't'cha wanna spend about an hour with me

The scent and the aroma refuses to breathe
It's more like a haze that is trying to succeed
It's drawing me in and pulling me to you
And every thought I have turns the language blue

All it costs is just a minute now
For one dollar you can show me how
I'll take your hand and then your worries too
In just one dance I'll make your dreams come true

Don't know why you play hard to get
I'm here to kiss away any thoughts of your regret
The silk tie from Siam shows elegance and class
Handsome as the heavens that a film would never cast

But underneath the mask I see the skin of a man
Smooth and seductive who's really got a plan
It's drawing me in, magnetically to you

All it costs is just a minute now
For one dollar you can show me how
I'll take your hand and then your worries too
In just one dance I'll make your dreams come true

Smoldering endless desire
How long will your flame burn

Reality is kicking in and so is my beer
I don't make excuses when it's all my fault
If a heart is made of money he's cleaned out my vault

I feel a little wounded and it isn't fair
To sit inside a parlour and see him standing over there
As smug as a robber that a cop can't catch
The lipstick on his collar doesn't seem to match mine

(Mine, doesn't seem to match mine, mine)

Now Joe behind the bar is offering advice
Cause I'm a broken record and he has to tell me twice
Why don't I understand that he just can't change
I wanna be his woman not his weekend dame

Now Joe has eyes a'rollin' says it's just too bad
And he'll be back tomorrow for my heartbeat crash
I'd like to say goodbye, but hello is the match
Though the lipstick on his collar never seems to match mine

Where they play cards

He played that much

You know the room by heart

I may never see a night like this

Starts happening when you are cheek to cheek
Could you ever dream it

How many times
Have I been waiting by the door
To hear these chimes
To hear that someone debonaire has just a arrived
And opened up to see
My world before my eyes
That silhouette creates an image
On the night I can't forget
It has the scent of something special
I can't rest
If I resist temptation
Oh, I know for sure that I will lose the bet

Slip up high, that shows off your wares
And when he's arriving, give him that invitation
Keep on wishing on his dollars and cares

Even though you are begging him please, please

Six days a week is way too much
I'm gonna make

Go on little getaway

Start it up and head for the green
Of endless countrysides
And go somewhere I've never been

I'll stop
Kiss my blues goodbye
Breathe until I
Soar outside my crazy nights
And live the riviera life
I'll stop
Thank you for today
I'm sure that by
Candlelight, I'll be alright

And live a riviera life
The road can wind like my hidden hair bow
You clear my face so I can feel the breeze
And down below
It's Monaco
And mister, I don't know a soul

I'll drop off the keys at valet
Look out my window bay
One afternoon martini
Wouldn't want it any other way

I wish that I was beachin' down on Saint Tropez
Or sitting in the lobby at the fabulous Pierre
With diamonds on my fingers and not a single care

Instead I'm on the Avenue where nobody goes
With fields of green that wilted like a last summer rose
Some people call it paradise, but I call it pain

And dreams painted yellow like the colour of gold
And dine with kings and queens until the food gets cold

This dream is now a comedy I don't wanna see

Caro Emerald,"Who needs a captain on a love ship?
Someone with no clue of the destination due bow
Ain’t that a trip?

Who needs a diamond on a hand of stone?
Someone with the hurt who couldn’t make it work,
A trophy because you slipped

Love can’t conquer anything
If it’s lost without a trace
You might be tough, you might even be strong
But not when you’re in this place

Secret lovers, get lost in the secrets they tell
They make lovers blind when they cover every inch of their lies
Secret lovers, it’s just your place of mind
A smoke and some wine is the life of the Black Valentine

Who needs a journey on a runaway train?
Your ticket isn’t worth half of what it hurts
When heart beats overwork

Who needs redemption from a guiltless crime?
Someone caries dreams from scene to scene
'Til they tear apart your mind

Love can’t conquer anything
If it’s hurting in the deep
You’ll be awake, you’ll twist your fate
That’s not someone you should keep

Secret lovers, get lost in the secrets they tell
They make lovers blind when they cover every inch of their lies
Secret lovers, it’s just your place of mind
A smoke and some wine is the life of the Black Valentine

This is their demand for another night they spend in self-conversation
It’s a will they came to pose in a letter left they’ve composed
To repeat the situation
They lie in a loop

Secret lovers, get lost in the secrets they tell
They make lovers blind when they cover every inch of their lies

And something has me really turning red

I'm gonna wear blue
And find a pair of flat black leather shoes

And whispers ""baby, will you take me home?""

Caro Emerald,"I recall the days that I was single
Used to flirt, fool around and mingle

Sharing stories where you think you’ve been
Your style must be grand, without a passport stamp
Can’t you see the twister that you’re in
Lie down inside a sea of words
You’re going under, now you won’t get hurt
So just give it a rest, this time your more is less

To create and fill this emptiness
Freedom that lies underneath
Let it fall and let them breathe
Bodies are not meant to be so bound
I’m the dancer of the dance
Let the socialites in her hands
Let them love me when I’m not around
When they speak their words of my demeanor

I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

Or on a crowded avenue

You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view

Carol,"If the thoughts in my head could reach a great distance
And somehow get into your mind
They'd tell you much more than all the words I could speak
From now till the end of time

Lady, now are you a lady
Do you like the one your beauty's been sold to
How does it feel when he holds you

As you reap the sad harvest of wanting too much
Determined you still feel alive
Now and then looking back to all you've forsaken
Nothing to do but survive

Lady, now are you a lady
Do you like the one your beauty's been sold to
How does it feel when he holds you

Knowing what you know, how could you sell

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

Never were, really are, nearly are?

Will you ever be done traveling
Always unraveling you, you?
Running away could lead you further astray
And as for fishing in streams for pieces of dreams
Those pieces will never fit

Look and see, can you be far from home?

Everywhere I turn I can see them
Little girls, little girls
Night and day I eat, sleep and breathe them

I'm an ordinary woman with feelings
I'd like a man to nibble on my ear
But I'll admit no man has bit
So how come I'm the mother of the year?

Little cheeks, little teeth
Everything around me is little
If I wring little necks
Surely I will get an acquittal

Some women are dripping with diamonds
Some women are dripping with pearls
Lucky me, lucky me
Look at what I'm dripping with little girls

How I hate little shoes, little socks
And each little bloomer
I'd have cracked years ago
If it weren't for my sense of humor

Some day I'll step on their freckles
Some night I'll straighten their curls
Send a flood, send the flu
Anything that you can do to little girls

Some day I'll land in the nut house
With all the nuts and the squirrels
There I'll stay tucked away
Until the prohibition of little girls

Had heebie-jeebies for Beebe's, Bathysphere
I got through Shirley Temple, and I'm here

I've gotten through Herbert and J. Edgar Hoover
Gee, that was fun and a half
When you've been through Herbert and J. Edgar Hoover
Anything else is a laugh

I've been through Reno, I've been through Beverly Hills, and I'm here.
Reefers and vino, rest cures, religion and pills, and I'm here

Then you career from career to career
I'm almost through my memoirs, and I'm here

I love the moonlight
I love the old fashioned things
The sound of rain
Upon a window pane
The starry song that April sings
This year's fancies
Are passing fancies
But sighing sighs holding hands
These my heart understands
I know I'm old fashioned
But I don't mind it
That's how I want to be
As long as you agree
To stay old fashioned with me

Carol Burnett,"
Life is not a highway strewn with flowers,
Still it holds a goodly share of bliss,
When the sun gives way to April showers,
Here is the point you should never miss.

Though April showers may come your way,
They bring the flowers that bloom in May.
So if it's raining, have no regrets,
Because it isn't raining rain, you know, (It's raining violets,)
And where you see clouds upon the hills,
You soon will see crowds of daffodils,
So keep on looking for a blue bird, And list'ning for his song,
Whenever April showers come along.

My little memories, those precious memories

They say you wrecked my home I'm a husband that's gone wrong
They don't know the sorrow that we've had to bear
For the one that I'm tied to was the first to be untrue
Yes they call our love a back street affair

We have each other now that's all that matters anyhow
Oh the judgment of gossip's never fair
We'll just be brave and strong then someday they'll see they're wrong
Let them call our love a back street affair
We'll be free for love someday when all the talk is dead away
And the happiness we've hoped for then we'll share
I'll climb a mountain high and then the world will hear me cry
That our love is not a back street affair",Back Street Affair,1995

Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand

Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

An old familiar feeling settles over me
And it's your face I see and I believe that you are there

In the garden when I stop to touch a rose
And feel the petal soft and sweet against my nose
I smile and I suppose that somehow maybe you are there

When I'm dreaming and I find myself awake
Without a warning and I rub my eyes and fantasize
And all at once I realize it's morning

And my fantasy is fading like a distant star of dawn
My dearest dream is gone

Pretend the dream is true and tell myself that you are there",You Are There,2005

Beside the legendary fountain

In its clear and gentle waters

You may lead me to the chasm
Where the rivers of our visions
Flow into one another

At the mist that they created
And lose myself within it
Cleanse my mind and body
And I know at this moment
As I stand in that cathedral
I will want to dive
Beneath the white cascading water

And she may argue with her logic

Carol Liebowitz,"Yesterday you came my way,
And when you smiled at me,
In my heart I felt a thrill you see,
That it was love at sight and
I was right to love you as I do.
Still I never dreamed that you could love me too.

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.

When you are not around.

Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else

My mother won't mind
And my father won't slight you
For your lack of kind.

And this she did say,
""It will not be long love
Till our wedding day"".

As the swan in the evening
Moved over the lake.

So softly she entered,
That her feet made no din.

And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day

And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Those come-what-may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life
From jazz and cocktails

The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distingue traces
That used to be there
You could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clock tales

Then you came along with your siren song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for awhile that your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me
Ah yes, I was wrong
Again, I was wrong

Life is lonely again
And only last year
Everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again
A trough full of hearts could only be a bore

A week in Paris could ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it

I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still
Burning inside my brain

Of those whose lives are lonely too",Lush Life,1999

Carol Sloane,"When I take you out, tonight, with me,
Honey, here's the way it's goin' to be:
You will set behind a team of snow white horses,
In the slickest gig you ever see!
Chicks and ducks and geese better scurry
When I take you out in the surrey,
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top!
Watch that fringe and see how it flutters
When I drive them high steppin' strutters.
Nosey pokes'll peek thru' their shutters and their eyes will pop!
The wheels are yeller, the upholstery's brown,
The dashboard's genuine leather,
With isinglass curtains y' can roll right down,
In case there's a change in the weather.
Two bright sidelight's winkin' and blinkin',
Ain't no finer rig I'm a-thinkin'
You c'n keep your rig if you're thinkin' 'at I'd keer to swap
Fer that shiny, little surrey with the fringe on the top! Did you say 
the fringe was made of silk
Wouldn't have no other kind but silk
Does it really have a team of snow white horses
One's like snow, the other's more like milk
All the world'll fly in a flurry
When I take you out in the surrey,
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top!
When we hit that road, hell fer leather,
Cats and dogs'll dance in the heather,
Birds and frogs'll sing all together and the toads will hop!
The wind'll whistle as we rattle along,
The cows'll moo in the clover,
The river will ripple out a whispered song,
And whisper it over and over:
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever?
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever?
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever and ud never stop
In that shiny, little surrey with the fringe on the top!
I can see the stars gettin' blurry,
When we drive back home in the surrey,
Drivin' slowly home in the surrey with the fringe on top!
I can feel the day gettin' older,
Feel a sleepy head on my shoulder,
Noddin', droopin' close to my shoulder, till it falls kerplop!
The sun is swimmin' on the rim of a hill;
The moon is takin' a header,
And jist as I'm thinkin' all the earth is still,
A lark'll wake up in the medder.
Hush, you bird, my baby's a-sleepin'!
Maybe got a dream worth a-keepin'
Whoa! you team, and jist keep a-creepin' at a slow clip clop.

Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.

It is seldom that a dream comes true,
To me it's clear
That he'll appear.

Some day he'll come along, the man I love
And he'll be big and strong,  the man I love
And when he comes my way,
I'll do my best to make him stay.

He'll look at me and smile, I'll understand
And in a little while, he'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word.

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday,
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day.

Carol Welsman,"That certain night
The night we met
There was magic abroad in the air
There were angels dining at the Ritz
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

I may be right I may be wrong
But I'm perfectly willing to swear
That when you turned and smiled at me
A nightingale sang in Berkeley square

The moon that lingered over London town
Poor puzzled moon he wore a frown
How could he know we two were so in love
The whole damned world seemed upside down

The streets of town were paved with stars
It was such a romantic affair
And as we kissed and said goodnight
A nightingale sang in Berkeley square

How strange it was
How sweet and strange
There was never a dream to compare
To those hazy crazy nights we met
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

Ah this heart of mine
Loud and fast
Like a merry-go-round in a fair
We would dance cheek to cheek
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

The dawn came stealing up
All gold and blue
To interrupt our rendez-vous
I still remember how you smiled and said
Was that a dream or was it true?

Our homeward step was just as light
As the dancing feet of Astaire
And like an echo far away
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

En svag nyans av ljus nånstans men ändå

Vem vill do vara kan do förklara det för mig?

Så gömmer också do en hemlighet
Stjärnor jag ser dom vill gärna ta ner nå'n till dig
Där bortom himlen finns en evighet
Om do vill upptäcka den här med mig
Ta första stegen och visa mig vägen I kväll
En känsla och jag litar på den
Se'n blir vår kärlek aldrig främmande igen

Its just that I thought we were doing fine
Baby did I hear you say you want to go?

Wont you run it by me one more time
Its just that I thought we were doing fine
I wont break so you dont have to worry
Cause I know what I can take
Too much has been taken
And I wont break
So you can come and go 
Because its all my mistake
And one that I wont make again 

Turn the radio up loud
Make it seem like there's a crowd
Wonder how it is I didn't know
Well I guess its true that love is blind
I thought were doing fine

Carole Bayer Sager,"You don't know me
If you did
You would know if I loved you
Part of it's trust
And part of it's just being
When you loved me
Did you know
How I lived my life for you
Part of me died
And part of me just cried out
Say goodbye now
Don't lie anymore
When it's gone
We'll walk away
We'll move on
But if you loved me
Even now
Would you watch as I leave you
Maybe you would
And maybe I'd still be here
You don't know me
Don't try anymore
When it's gone
We'll walk away
We'll move on
But if you loved me
If you did
Would you watch as I leave you
Maybe you will
And maybe I will still be here

Maybe I will still be here",Stronger Than Before,1981
Carole Bayer Sager,"Somebody's been lying
Somebody's been calling me
Telling me he still loves me
But not the way I thought it would be
He's making fun of me and laughing at my dreams
And I know that he keeps saying not to worry
He's telling me to just hold on
But he's not here to lean on
And words won't warm my bed now he's gone

It seems so funny letting go of what we had
And I guess I'm just scared
And I still believe him though
And I'd be wiser to go on my own way

Somebody's been lying
And I know you're telling me
Only the things you want to
I guess I lie as much as you do

It seems so funny letting go of what we had
And I'm much too afraid
And I'm much too alone

Carol Bayer Sage
(C.B Sage / B. Bucharach)


Sometimes late at night you say you love
Even if you don't well I guess that it don't matter
Very much it all
Sometimes it don't matterâ?¦ it all

Fairy times you just so far to love me
I don't know who you are
And I wonder till I put you there to watch you fall
Sometimes it don't matter it all

I'll keep onâ?¦ I 'll hold onâ?¦
Even though I don't know how will in
And I could spend this life of mine with you
And I still have more to give you

I'm tryingâ?¦ be with meâ?¦
Even though I don't know how will in
And I could spend this life of mine with you
And I still have more to give you

Sometimes late at night you say you love
Maybe you still do
And maybe you just sweetness this I can't recall
Did you ever love meâ?¦ at all?

I'll keep onâ?¦ I 'll hold onâ?¦
Even though I don't know how will in
And I could spend this life of mine with you
And I still have more to give you

I'm tryinâ?¦ be with meâ?¦
Even though I don't know how will in
And I could spend this life of mine with you
And I still have more to give you

I'm tryinâ?¦ be with meâ?¦
Even though I don't know how will in
And I could spend this life of mine with you
And I still have more to give you

I'm tryinâ?¦ be with meâ?¦
Even though I don't know how will in
And I could spend this life of mine with you
And I still have more to give you (fade out)

Carole Bishop,"Daddy always thought that he married beneath him 
That's what he said, that's what he said. 
When he proposed he informed my mother
He was probably her very last chance.
And though she was twenty-two, 
Though she was twenty-two, 
Though she was twenty-two
She married him. 

Life with my dad wasn't ever a picnic
More like a ""come as you are.""
When I was five I remember my mother 
Dug earrings out of the car. 
I knew they weren't hers, but it wasn't 
Something you'd want to discuss. 
He wasn't warm.
Well, not to her.
Well, not to us 

But
Everything was beautiful at the ballet. 
Graceful men lift lovely girls in white. 
Yes,
Everything was beautiful at ballet, 
Hey!
I was happy at the ballet. 

That's when I started class. 

Up a steep and very narrow stairway 

To the voice like a metronome 
Up a steep and very narrow stairway 

It wasn't paradise. 

It wasn't paradise. 

It wasn't paradise. 

But it was home. 

Mother always said I'd be very attractive 
When I grew up, when I grew up. 
""Diff'rent,"" she said, ""With a special something 
And a very, very personal flair.""
And though I was eight or nine,
Though I was eight or nine, 
Though I was eight or nine, 
I hated her. 

Now, 
""Diff'rent"" is nice, but it sure isn't pretty.
""Pretty"" is what it's about. 
I never met anyone who was ""diff'rent""
Who couldn't figure that out. 
So beautiful I'd never lived to see. 
But it was clear, 
If not to her,
Well then to me 

That everyone is beautiful at the ballet. 
Every prince has got to have his swan.
Yes,
Everyone is beautiful at the ballet. 

Hey! 

I was pretty 

At the ballet. 

Up a steep and very narrow stairway 
To the voice like a metronome. 
Up a steep and very narrow stairway, 

It wasn't paradise. 

It wasn't paradise. 

It wasn't paradise. 

But it was home. 

I don't know what they were for or against, really, except each other. 
I mean, I was born to save their marriage 
But when my father came to pick my mother up at the hospital he said, 
""Well, I thought this was going to help. 
But I guess it's not."" 
Anyway, I did have a fantastic fantasy life. 
I used to dance around the living room with my arms up like this. 
My fantasy was that it was an Indian Chief 
And he'd say to me, 
""Maggie, do you wanna dance?"" 
And I'd say, ""Daddy, I would love to dance."" 

But it was clear. 

When he proposed. 

That I was born to help their marriage and when 

That's what he said. 

That's what she said. 

I used to dance around the living room. 

He wasn't warm. 

Not to her. 

(""Do-do-doo's"") 

It was an Indian chief and he'd say
""Maggie, do you wanna dance?""
And I said, ""Daddy, I would love to""
Everything was beautiful at the ballet. 
Raise your arms and someone's always there. 
Yes, everything was beautiful at the ballet,
At the ballet,
At the ballet!! 

Yes everything was beautiful at the ballet. 

Hey! 

I was pretty 

I was happy 

""I would love to.""

Carole Carr,"There's a doctor livin' in your town
There's a lawyer and an Indian, too
And neither doctor, lawyer nor Injun chief
Could love you any more than I do

There's a barrel of fish in the ocean
There's a lot of little birds in the blue
And 'Neither fish nor fowl"" says the wise old owl
Could love you any more than I do

No! No! No! it couldn't be true
That anyone else could love you like I do
I'm gonna warn all the *dead-eyed dicks*
That you're the chick with the slickest tricks

And every tick of my ticker ticks for you, follow through
Tell the doc to stick to his practice
Tell the lawyer to settle his case
Send the Injun chief and his tommy-hawk

Back to little Rain-In-the-Face
'Cause you
Know! Know! Know! it couldn't be true
That anyone else could love you like I do

(No! No! No! it couldn't be true)
(That anyone else could love you like I do)
And, confidentially, I confess
I sent a note to the local press

That I'll be changin' my home address for you, follow through
Tell the doc to stick to his practice
Tell the lawyer to settle his case
Send the Injun chief and his tommy-hawk

Know! Know! Know! it couldn't be true

No! No! No! it couldn't be true
That anyone else could love you like I do
I'm gonna send a hot *communeek*
To warn the boys down at Cripple Creek

That every dimple on your dimpled cheek is mine, so to speak
Tell the (doc!) to stick to his practice
Tell the (lawyer!) to settle his case
Send the (Injun chief!) and his tommy-hawk

Carole Carr,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,1990
Carole Carr,"There's a story the gypsies know is true
That when your love wears golden earrings,
She belongs to you.
An old love story that's known to very few,
But if you wear those golden earrings,
Love will come to you.

By the burning fire,they will glow with ev'ry coal.
You will hear desire whisper low inside your soul.
So be my gypsy,
Make love your guiding light,
And let that pair of golden earrings
Cast their spell tonight.",Golden Earrings,2006
Carole Cook,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",Lullaby of Broadway,1994

You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea
I forgive you, 'cause I can't forget you
You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea

[Repeat: x2]
I ought to cross you off my list
But when you come a-knocking at my door
Fate seems to give my heart a twist
And I come running back for more
I should hate you, but I guess I love you

Pas l'soleil qui m'chatouille les yeux 
Fin du rêve et motel sordide 
C'est la télé qui m'sort du bleu 
Allez, debout 
Ça fait combien d'temps que je suis là  
A rêver d'endroits où j'vais pas 
A me rabâcher que quand t'as plus rien 
Ta fuite au moins, elle t'appartient 
A droite une montagne invincible 
A gauche le précipice m'attire 
Plus l'choix, plus l'choix, devant moi plus qu'ça 
Cette route où je roule, je roule, je roule, je roule 
Loin de moi, loin d'ici

Loin pour une autre vie

Carole Fredericks,"J'ai beau chercher ta trace à travers les jours qui s'écument
Traîner sur les terrasses ou me balader sur la lune
J'ai beau changer d'espace, m'inventer d'autres quais des brumes
Rien de nous deux s'efface malgré le temps et l'amertume
J'ai beau chercher sans cesse à travers les astres et les lois
Les erreurs, les faiblesses qui ont témoigné contre moi
J'en voulais des promesses, elles m'ont toutes éloigné de toi
Elles ont tué l'ivresse qui claquait au bout de nos doigts

Et doucement, j'oublierai tout doucement
Je f'rai semblant doucement
En attendant ton retour, comme dans une vieille chanson d'amour

J'ai beau chercher des rimes à travers les lignes du destin
Entrevoir d'autres signes perchés sur les monts tibétains
Mais elles sont hautes les cimes quand on a le cœur orphelin
Y a que dans les contes de Grimm que les histoires se finissent bien

Et doucement, j'oublierai tout doucement
Je f'rai semblant doucement
En attendant ton retour, comme dans une vieille chanson d'amour

Et doucement, j'oublierai tout doucement
Je f'rai semblant doucement
En attendant ton retour, comme dans une vieille chanson d'amour",Doucement,1995
