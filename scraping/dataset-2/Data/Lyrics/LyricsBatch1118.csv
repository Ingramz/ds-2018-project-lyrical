Bernie Marsden,"If you're leaving close the door.
I'm not expecting people anymore.
Hear me grieving, I'm lying on the floor.
Whether I'm drunk or dead I really ain't too sure.

I'm a blind man, I'm a blind man and my world is pale.
When a blind man cries, Lord, you know there ain't no sadder tale.

Had a friend once in a room,
had a good time but it ended much too soon.
In a cold month in that room
we found a reason for the things we had to do.

I'm a blind man, I'm a blind man, now my room is cold.
When a blind man cries, Lord, you know he feels it from his soul.",When a Blind Man Cries,2014
Bernie McGann,"I am not such a clever one
About the latest fads
I admit I was never one
Adored by local lads
Not that I ever try to be a saint
I'm the type that they classify as quaint
I'm old fashioned
I love the moonlight
I love the old fashioned things
The sound of rain
Upon a window pane
The starry song that April sings
This year's fancies
Are passing fancies
But sighing sighs holding hands
These my heart understands
I know I'm old fashioned
But I don't mind it
That's how I want to be
As long as you agree
To stay old fashioned with me

I'm old fashioned
But I don't mind it
That's how I want to be
As long as you agree
To stay old fashioned with me
Oh won't you stay old fashioned with me
Oh please stay old fashioned with me",I'm Old Fashioned,2006
Bernie Nerow,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?",How About You?,1957
Bernie Nerow,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

It might as well be spring",It Might as Well Be Spring,1957
Bernie Nerow,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay",Love Is Here to Stay,1957
Bernie Nolan,"I'm nothing special, in fact I'm a bit of a bore
If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
She says I began to sing long before I could talk
But I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

I've been so lucky, I am the girl with golden hair
I wanna sing it out to everybody
What a joy, what a life, what a chance!

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me",Thank You for the Music,2004
Bernie Nolan,"I don't wanna talk about things we've gone through,
Though it's hurting me, now it's history.
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too,
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.
The winner takes it all,
The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.
 
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there,
I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,
But I was a fool, playing by the rules.
The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice, 
And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
The judges will decide the likes of me abide,
Spectators of the show always staying low.
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend,
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.
 
I don't wanna talk if it makes you feel sad,
And I understand you've come to shake my hand.
I apologize if it makes you feel bad seeing me so tense, no self confidence.",Winner Takes It All,2004
Bernie Ostrowski,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,2000
Bernie Parke,"Bye bye baby
Time to hit the road to dreamland
You're my baby

Dig you in the land of nod

Hold tight baby
We'll be swinging up in dreamland
All night baby

Where the little cherubs trot

Look at that knocked out moon
Been a-blowing his top in the blue

Never saw the likes of you

Bye bye baby
Time to hit the road to dreamland
Don't cry baby
It was divine but the rooster has finally crowed

Time to hit the road

Bye bye baby

Bye bye baby

Well it was divine but the cuckoo has finally crowed

Bernie Parke,"In my imagination, I'm finding consolation
Somewhere along the Rio Grande
Sadly I'm reminiscing, madly again I'm kissing
Someone along the Rio Grande
 
It happened in Monterey, a long time ago
I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I'm afraid that it was mine
It happened in Monterey
Without thinking twice
I left her and threw away the key to paradise
My indiscreet heart, longs for the sweetheart 
That I left in old Monterey
 
Making believe I'm merry
In ev'ry glass of sherry
I see the sparkle of her eye
And when I hear the cello
Tender and sweet and mellow
I hear the music of her sigh

Bernie Parke,"Don't need no palace paved with gold
Don't need more cash than banks can hold
When I get to feelin' a feelin'
For something there ain't too much of
My sweet lil' darlin' gives me her love
 
Don't catch me chasin' round at night
I'm not impressed by glamor sights
Lil' darlin' may not be as pretty 
As some other gals you can see
But my lil' darlin' only loves me",Li'l Darlin',2007
Bernie Parke,"Another bride, another June
Another sunny honeymoon
Another season, another reason
For makin' whoopee

A lot of shoes, a lot of rice
The groom is nervous, he answers twice
Its really killin' that he's so willin' 
To make whoopee

Picture a little love nest 
Down where the roses cling
Picture the same sweet love nest 
Think what a year can bring

He's washin dishes and baby clothes
He's so ambitious he even sews
But don't forget folks,
Thats what you get folks, for makin' whoopee

He doesn't make much money
Five thousand dollars per;
Some judge who thinks he's funny
Says, ""You pay six to her.""

He says, ""Now judge, suppose I fail?""
The judge says, ""Budge, right into jail.
You'd better keep her
I think it's cheaper
Than making whoopee.""",Makin' Whoopee,2007

Bernie Parke,"I was a hum-drum person
Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lawd up in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream
'Til somebody else came near
Somebody else came near you
I felt the winter's chill
And now I sit and wonder night and day
Why I love you still",What Is This Thing Called Love,2007
Bernie Paul,"There'll be no strings to bind your hands
Not if my love can't bind your heart
And there's no need to take a stand
For it was I who chose to start
I see no need to take me home
I'm old enough to face the dawn

Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Then slowly turn away

Maybe the sun's light will be dim
And it won't matter anyhow
If morning's echo says we've sinned
Well, it was what I wanted now
And if we're victims of the night
I won't be blinded by the light

Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Then slowly turn away
I won't beg you to stay with me
Through the tears of the day, of the years
Baby, baby, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)",Angel of the Morning,1996

Caroline, your lovin' came so strong

They warned me of my fate, but I was quite prepared to meet it
You'll go to Hell they smiled at me
And told me of the roaring fires
But I was happy living wild
And fueling my own desires
I was a wild man
Drinking, smoking and messing around with women
Lots of women
No, not swimming, women

I wanna go to Heaven
The place to be is right up there
I wanna go to Heaven
It's gonna be good so I won't despair

I decided to reform and pray
Beg mercy for my soul
I prayed in church
Threw away my bad habits
Prayed out of church
Adopted an entirely different role
I gave my money to the poor until I was poor
But at least I ensured that I would go up there
Instead of down below to the Inferno
Where the evil flames of desire
Burned higher and higher and higher

I'm gonna go to Heaven
Paid my dues so I'm getting in
I'm gonna go to Heaven
It's looking good if I abstain from sin

Neatly side-stepping the long queue
Waved hi to St. Peter
Who checked my card and let me through

Laughed and got arrested

Your behaviour is a disgrace
Here we pray every hour, on the hour

No laughing in Heaven
Let me out, I just can't stay here

This wan't what I expected
Here was what looked like a bunch of manic depressives
Can I get a transfer, I screamed
But no, once you're in Heaven, you're here for good
The good of your soul, but that's no good for me
If you want to go to Hell you've really got to be bad
Okay, okay, I'll be bad
Too late
What do you mean too late
Too late
No

Bernie Tormé,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky",Smoke on the Water [Live],1981
Bernie Williams,"In every heart there is a room 
A sanctuary safe and strong
To heal the wounds from lovers past
Until a new one comes along

I spoke to you in cautious tones
You answered me with no pretense 
And still I feel I said too much 
My silence is my self defense

And every time I've held a rose
It seems I only felt the thorns
And so it goes, and so it goes
And so will you soon I suppose

But if my silence made you leave
Then that would be my worst mistake
So I will share this room with you
And you can have this heart to break

And this is why my eyes are closed
It's just as well for all I've seen
And so it goes, and so it goes
And you're the only one who knows

So I would choose to be with you
That's if the choice were mine to make
But you can make decisions too
And you can have this heart to break

And so it goes, and so it goes
And you're the only one who knows",And So It Goes,2003
Bernie Williams,"I get up in the evening
And I ain't got nothing to say
I come home in the morning
I go to bed feeling the same way
I ain't nothing but tired
Man I'm just tired and bored with myself
Hey there baby, I could use just a little help

You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Message keeps getting clearer
Radio's on and I'm moving 'round the place
I check my look in the mirror
I want to change my clothes, my hair, my face
Man I ain't getting nowhere
I'm just living in a dump like this
There's something happening somewhere
Baby I just know that there is

You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

You sit around getting older
There's a joke here somewhere and it's on me
I'll shake this world off my shoulders
Come on baby this laugh's on me

Stay on the streets of this town
And they'll be carving you up alright
They say you gotta stay hungry
Hey baby I'm just about starving tonight
I'm dying for some action
I'm sick of sitting 'round here trying to write this book
I need a love reaction
Come on now baby gimme just one look

You can't start a fire sitting 'round crying over a broken heart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
You can't start a fire worrying about your little world falling apart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Finding another world.

Of paradise, where roses grew

To sit in prison then deal with reality and big decisions

The reason I Stevie Wondered about your depth of inner vision

every night I pray
tomorrow brings a sunny day and happy things

Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss

Shining in her eye

Tanta claridad
De sol desolador

¿Cómo bajar de un rito?
Que te va a estrellar

Y el alma se te iba yendo, yendo, yendo

Bersuit,"Aquella bombacha que fue blanca
Hoy se encuentra casi casi toda negra
Pero es un trofeo de guerra
De muchas incansables maratones
y no pienso devolver esos calzones
Ni tirarlos porque nadie ya los usa
Son el alma verdadera de esta musa
y el ritmo que late en mis canciones
Están guardados en una cajonera
Junto a otros objetos fetiche
y le rindo culto al cocoliche
Al linyerismo voyeur de la borrachera
Junto recuerdos y mil hojas rotosas
Todo manchado por viejas sensaciones
De hermosas corridas y reuniones
Donde podría sucedernos cualquier cosa
El negro Dante transitando en las cornisas
O Valentín empernando en los balcones
y los secuaces de Hugito acovachados
En un rincón atrás de los mirones
El Menduco siempre duro como un perro
y los mareados desmayados por doquier
Las chicas agitando las caderas y calentando
La croqueta de la gente hasta arder
Es la flor de mis heridas
Que se abre cualquier día
y me despierta por las noches
Sudando y extrañándote
Festejos infinitos sin motivo
Quilombos espontáneos de semana
Revueltas furibundas en la cama
Ingestas continuadas sin estilo
Pero todo lo que tuvo que pasar pasó
Siempre uno you otro modo haya pasado
Por eso es que los trastos van guardados
Para que nunca nada se me olvide
y en abierto homenaje a aquellos días
A las noches desbordantes de locura
Evocando increíbles aventuras
Cargo historias de múltiples quilates
Galanes, divas y primates
Psicópatas y locos de remate
Todos mezclados en una misma pieza
Servidos como peces en bandeja
A veces en las noches de mal sueño
O en las tardes de domingo domingueras
Hurgo en los placeres encerrados
Entre prendas y papeles olvidados
y descubro de pronto en mi guarida
Tu sucia bombacha preferida
La huelo muy profundo y cobra vida
Tu fragancia femenina que es la flor de mis heridas
Es la flor de mis heridas
Que se abre cualquier día
y me despierta por las noches
Sudando y extrañándote
Es la flor de mis heridas
Que se abre cualquier día

Como cuando pendejos
Sin miedo al malestar
Queríamos pisar baldosas flojas

Hundiendo los pies en la espuma fría

Sos el último en la cola”
Dejamos pasar el tiempo que nos condena
Que pena
Y la mierda que nos rodea aun queda
Zapatos rotos, cordones flojos
Y un sueño:
De nuestro mundo somos dueños
Queríamos saltar sobre los charcos
Con zapatillas blancas
Para que se enoje mamá
Queríamos que se inundara todo

Y sentía que era extraño en esa orquesta
Que aburría de sonar en sol mayor

¿Por qué, ese palo que te amasa
Que te afofa, que te aplasta

Lo queres acariciar
No hay nada, lo amas

Hoy su cara está en todas las remeras
Es un muerto que no parra de nacer

Aburridos en sus casas

Para lavar las culpas

Porque salimos del agua
Porque soñamos y la tomamos

Te aviso que para mi es el vicio
De este payaso sin risas

Que de lágrima se ahoga
Tiré la soga
El barba no dio bola
Dijo: “hijo no te inundes
Sos el último en la cola”
Dejamos pasar el tiempo que nos condena
Que pena
Y la mierda que nos rodea aun queda
Zapatos rotos, cordones flojos
Y un sueño:

De nuestro mundo somos dueños
Queríamos saltar sobre los charcos
Con zapatillas blancas
Para que se enoje mamá
Queríamos que se inundara todo
Y las bocas de tormenta
No alcancen a desagitar
Y también patear por la orilla del mar

Hundiendo los pies en la espuma fría

Por puro placer, sin ninguna red

I loved you
You turned around and
Walked right out the door
Seems like holding your hand
Was not enough
So I want to do something more

Wanna hold it near baby
Wanna hold your ear
Until you hear that
I love you

And I want to hold your eyes baby
Lovely shape and size baby
Want to hold your eyes
So you'll see and realize that
I love you

I wanna hold your nose
I wanna hold your toes
I won't let you breathe or eat
Until you know the truth 
I love you

Oh I wanna hold your hair baby
Show you that I care baby
And it's only fair to tell you
What I intend to do
I'm going to keep what I hold dear

Your eyes
Your tooth
Your ears
And I'm gonna hold them 'till
You say you love me tooo!

With a little bit of this

And a little bit of that

You can get what you see

And I bet that you're all a little bit excited

If you need a autograph, honey I can write it

I got a girl the smart one on the planet

Some called Whitner, some called Jenny

I got a girl in Paris

I got a girl in Rome

I even got a girl in the vatican dome

I got a girl right here, I got a girl right there

And I got a girlfriend everywhere.

I got a girl on the moon

I got a girl on mars

I even got a girl that likes to dance in the stars

I got a girl right here, and one right there

And I got a girlfriend everywhere


From Miami beach to Valuga Bay

From the Milky Way to East Soley

From San Chope to my home Cafe

That's my way and I do it like day by day

In Africa, America, Europe and Australia

Asia, Canada I take them on a meria

India, Arabia, to the girls in Germany

All around the planet you can be my fantasy

Makes a sleepy noise 
Underneath their blankets 
Go all the girls and boys

Maria rings the bell 
Big Bird swings the lantern 
To show that all is well

Where our train will ride 
But all the little travelers 
Are warm and snug inside

How could he know we two were so in love

And as we kissed and said goodnight

To those hazy crazy nights we met

Like a merry-go-round in a fair

Brings morning dreams to alight upon my bed

If dead men swam the waters deep
Then fish would cry all in their sleep

To lift my hat from the depths as you walk by

Now banjos ring and fiddles play
A candle burns to light my way
And turning in my sleep
I dream again of your love, your love to keep

Who saw their seeds for all they're worth
Who cry for rain all summer long
And weep for the day when winter's passed and gone

If cherry trees bore fruit of gold
The birds would die, their wings would fold
They'd sing no more their song of love
Nor await the morning sun that lights the sky above

If war returns like it did before

They'd cry for love and their candy too

Bert Jansch,"Your love was like a child upon a rockin' horse
The color black who rides
Through a forest of dreams and laughs
At the evils that cannot be seen

Yet like the aging of a child at play
Your love is broken and fades away
And borne in the wind are the seeds
That burn in the hearts of boys a-passing your way

When the first day's light has dawned
You wake to find your troubles gone
Then love only life as it grows
And trust every flower but not the red, red rose

Spread your wings and fly, my love
Dance upon the clouds above
Harvest your thoughts of love

Bert Jansch,"There were three brothers in merry Scotland
In merry Scotland there were three
And they did cast lots which of them should go
Should go, should go
And turn robber all on the salt sea

The lot it fell first upon Henry Martin
The youngest of all the three
That he should turn robber all on the salt sea
Salt sea, the salt sea
For to maintain his two brothers and he

They had not been sailing but a long winter's night
And a part of a short winter's day
When he espied a stout lofty ship
Lofty ship, lofty ship
Come bibbing down on him straight way

""Hello, hello"", cried Henry Martin
What makes you sail so nigh?
I'm a rich merchant ship bound for fair London Town
London Town, London Town
Would you please for to let me pass by?

""Oh no, oh no"", cried Henry Martin
This thing it never could be
For I have turned robber all on the salt sea
Salt sea, the salt sea.
For to maintain my two brothers and me

Come lower your tops'l and brail up your mizz'n
And bring your ship under my lee
Or I will give you a full cannon ball
Cannon ball, cannon ball
And all your dear bodies drown in the salt sea

Oh no, we won't lower our lofty topsail
Nor bring our ship under your lee
And you shan't take from us our rich merchant goods
Merchant goods, merchant goods
Nor point our bold guns to the sea

Then broadside and broadside and at it they went
For fully two hours or three
Till Henry Martin gave to them deathshot
The deathshot, the deathshot
And straight to the bottom went she

Bad news, bad news to old England came
Bad news to fair London Town
There's been a rich vessel and she's cast away
Cast away, cast away
And all of her merry men drowned

He could drive young ladies wild with a tune his wires would sing
He could fiddle the fish out of salt water, water from a marble stone
Or milk from out a maiden's breast though baby she had none
There he played in the castle hall and there he played them fast asleep

Looking so sadly, all upon the swift tide

On the banks of the meadow, on the banks of the meadow

And as she sat weeping a young man came by
And as she sat weeping a young man came by
What ails you my jewel? What ails you my jewel
What ails you my jewel and makes you to cry?

Well I once had a sweetheart and now I have none
I once had a sweetheart and now I have none
He's gone and leave me, gone and leave me
Gone and leave me in sorrow to mourn

Last night in sweet slumber I dreamed that I did see
Last night in sweet slumber I dreamed that I did see
Mine own dearest true love, mine own dearest true love
Mine own dearest true love come smiling to me

But when I awokened I found it not so
But when I awokened I found it not so
Mine eyes were like fountains, mine eyes were like fountains
Mine eyes were like fountains where the waters do flow

My false love will weep for me after I'm gone

And that was the beginning of my misery

And likewise a silk handkerchief to tie up his head
To tie up his head as sailors will do
And he said my pretty Polly will you come too

Now this maid being young and foolish she thought it no harm
For to lie into bed to keep herself warm
And what was done there I will never disclose
But I wish that short night had been seven long years

Next morning this sailor so early arose
And into my apron three guineas did throw
Saying take this I will give and more I will do
If you'll be my Polly wherever I go

Now if it's a boy he will fight for the king
And if it's a girl she will wear a gold ring
She will wear a gold ring and a dress all aflame

Who had two sons and one daughter dear. 

One told his secrets to no other,
but to his brother this he said,

I think they have a mind to wed.
I'll put an end to all their courtship,
I'll send him silent to his grave."" 

A day of hunting was prepared,
Where only bush and briars grew.
And there they did this young man murder,
And in the brake his body threw. 

""Now welcome home, my dear young brothers,
Our serving man, is he behind?""
""We've left him where we've been a-hunting,
""We've left him where no man can find.""

She thought she saw her own true love;
She dreamt she saw him standing by her,
She saw his coat was red with blood. 

""Don't weep for me, my dearest jewel,
Don't weep for me nor care nor pine,
For your two brothers killed me cruel-
In such a place you may me find. 

""Rise up, my love, tomorrow morning,
Go straightway to that brake you know,
For there you'll find my body lying,
Where only bush and briars grow."" 

She went out early in the morning,
And in the garden brake she stood
And there she found her own dear jewel,
All covered o'er in a gore of blood. 

She took a kerchief from her pocket,
And wiped his eyes though he was blind.
""Because he was my own true lover,
My own true love and a friend of mine."" 

Three days and nights she did sit by him,
And her poor heart was filled with woe,
Till cruel hunger crept upon her,
And home she was obliged to go.

A dream, it came to me
I thought I heard a piper play
The sweetest melody

People gathered round a dancing
And singing so merrily
They're all singing and dancing, Caledonia, ever free
Singing and dancing, Caledonia, ever free

From the busy heart of Glasgow
To Lochranza by the sea
O're the water to Kintyre
The pretties pace you'll ever see

To the pubs and bars of Oban
They're all proud of their old country
They're all singing and dancing, Caledonia, ever free
Singing and dancing, Caledonia, ever free

On the road to Drumnadrochid
There's music everywhere
For the piper plays for Nessie
A sweet and tender air

Through Glengarry's running rivers
Cascading to the sea
To the tranquility of Ullapool
Ah, now that's Scatland to me
Come wild and windy weather, Caledonia, ever free

When the fiddle plays from Scotland
They hears the piper's song
They came o'erthe sea to join him
They danced and they sang along

From the granite city southward
On the road to bonny Dundee
They're all singing and dancing, Caledonia, ever free
Singing and dancing, Caledonia, ever free

Now if you ever come to Scotland
Ever come to visit my home
You can hear the piper playing
Standing all alone

For he plays from Edinburgh Castle
That looks out to the sea
He'll have you singing and dancing, Caledonia, ever free

On a wild, wet, windy day
I heard a sweet voice cry in the wind

Fingers cut down to the core
Saw the light of a lady
She was sitting alone on the shore

""Lady all alone, please tell me
Why do you cry for me?
Why do sit in the cold and sing
Sing out to the sea?""

""Well I sing for my loved ones
Lost in the silvery sea
Sing for my homeland so dear
Sing to draw your heart near

So please, kind sir, will you help me
To find my way home?
I've traveled the seven blue oceans
Now I'm stranded here all alone

My brothers they are dying
From a plague running wild and free
Their bodies all covered in the blackest of oil
That floats on top of the sea

And my sisters are in hiding
Afraid others may see their shame
Their bodies all twisted, broken and lame
Deep in the watery main

So please, kind sir, will you help me
To find my way home
I've traveled the seven blue oceans
How I'm stranded here all alone

If you promise you will take me
To the edge of the silvery sea
I'll give you all your heart's desires
All your eyes they do see""

O'er the jagged rocks I carried her
To the edge of the silvery sea
I laid her down and kissed her sweet lips
Saying, ""Lover, now you are free""

And she would not let me be

Bert Jansch,"I'll sing you this October song
There's no song before it
The words and tune are none of my own
For my joys and sorrows bore it

Beside the sea the brambly briars
In the still of evening
Birds fly out behind the sun
And with them I'll be leaving

The fallen leaves that jewel the ground
They know the art of dying
And leave with joy their glad gold hearts
In scarlet shadows lying

When hunger calls my footsteps home
The morning follows after
L swim the seas within my mind
And the pine trees laugh green laughter

L used to search for happiness
L used to follow pleasure
But l found a door behind my mind
And that's the greatest treasure

For rulers like to lay down laws
And rebels like to break them
And the poor priests like to walk in chains

L met a man whose name was time
He said I must be going
But just how long ago that was
L have no way of knowing

Sometimes l want to murder time
Sometimes when my heart's aching
But mostly l just stroll along
The path that he is taking

I'll sing you this October Song
There is no song before it
The words and tune are none of my own
For my joys and sorrows bore it

Beside the sea the brambly briars
In the cool of evening
The birds fly out behind the sun
And with them I'll be leaving

Bert Jansch,"Cold mountains they are all around me
Cold waters rolling down the stream
Oft in my sleep I think I see you
But when I wake it's just a dream

I've often thought, I've often wondered
What makes young women love young men
They're like the stars on a summer morning
First they appear and then they're gone

I'd rather be in some God holler
Where the sun don't ever shine
Than to see you with another
And know you never would be mine

I've wandered down your lonesome highways
I've chased the stars most of my days
I'm going back to East Virginia
The place where I was born and raised

Cold mountains they are here around me
Cold waters rolling down the stream
Oft in my sleep I think I see you
But when I wake it's just a dream",Cold Mountain,2004
Bert Jansch,"There lived a lady by the North Sea shore
(Lay the bent to the bonnie broom)
Two daughters were the babes she bore
(Fa la la la la la la la la la)

alternating with each of the lines below>

As one grew bright as is the sun,
So coal black grew the elder one.

A knight came riding to the lady's door,
He'd travelled far to be their wooer.

He courted one with gloves and rings,
But he loved the other above all things.

Oh sister will you go with me
To watch the ships sail on the sea?

She took her sister by the hand
And led her down to the North Sea strand.

And as they stood on the windy shore
The dark girl threw her sister o'er.

Sometimes she sank, sometimes she swam,
Crying, ""Sister, reach to me your hand!

""Oh Sister, Sister, let me live,
And all that's mine I'll surely give.""

""(It's) your own true love that I'll have and more,
But thou shalt never come ashore.""

And there she floated like a swan,
The salt sea bore her body on.

Two minstrels walked along the strand
And saw the maiden float to land.

They made a harp of her breastbone,
Whose sound would melt a heart of stone.

They took three locks of her yellow hair,
And with them strung the harp so rare.

They went into her father's hall
To play the harp before them all,

But when they laid it on a stone
The harp began to play alone.

The first string sang a doleful sound:
""The bride her younger sister drowned.""

The second string as that they tried,
In terror sits the black-haired bride.

The third string sang beneath their bow,
""And surely now her tears will flow

Bert Jansch,"Let's get away, you say, find a better place,
Miles and miles away from the city's race,
Look around for someone lying in the sunshine
Marking time, hear the sighs, close your eyes...

Ba - da - pa do da da - ba - pa do da da...

Stepping from cloud to cloud passing in their flight
Visit the frosty stars in the backwash light
Star becomes a vision, never mind the meaning,
Hidden there, moving fast, it won't last...
Time passes all too soon, how it rushes by,
Now a thousand moons are about to die
No time to reflect on what the time was spent on,
Nothing left, far away, dreamers fade

Ba - da - pa do da da - ba - pa do da da...

Strange visions pass me by, winging softly thru the sky
Over the water, oooohh

Bert Jansch,"It was homeward bound one night on the deep
Swinging in my hammock I fell asleep
I dreamed a dream and I thought it true
Concerning Franklin and his gallant crew

With one hundred seamen he sailed away
To the frozen ocean in the month of May
To seek a passage around the pole
Where we poor seamen do sometimes go

Through cruel hardships they mainly strove
Their ship on mountains of ice was drove
Only the Eskimo with his skin canoe
Was the only one that ever came through

In Baffin's Bay where the whale fish blow
The fate of Franklin no man may know
The fate of Franklin no tongue can tell
Lord Franklin along with his sailors do dwell

And now my burden it gives me pain
For my long lost Franklin I'd cross the main
Ten thousand pounds I would freely give
To say on earth that my Franklin do live",Lord Franklin,2004

Gone and left me in sorrow to mourn 
Last night in sweet slumber I dreamed I did see 
Last night in sweet slumber I dreamed I did see 
My own darling jewel sat smiling by me 
My own darling jewel sat smiling by me 
But when I awakened I found it not so 
But when I awakened I found it not so 
My eyes like some fountain with tears overflowed
Eyes like some fountain with tears overflowed
I'll venture through England, through France and through Spain
I'll venture through England, through France and through Spain 
My life I'll venture on watery main 
My life I'll venture on watery main
I'll set sail of silver and steer toward the sun

And my false love will weep, my false love will weep 
False love will weep for me after I'm gone 
After I'm gone, After I'm gone, After I'm gone...

Not a soul would look up, not a soul would look down
Not a soul would look up, not a soul would look down
To show me the way to fair Nottamun town

I rode a gray horse, a mule roany mare
Gray mane and gray tail, a green stripe down her back
Gray mane and gray tail, a green stripe down her back
There wasn't a hair on her be-what was coal black

She stood so still, she threw me to the dirt
She tore -a my hide and she bruised my shirt
From saddle to stirrup I mounted again
And on my ten toes I rode over the plain

Met the king and the queen and a company more
A-riding behind and a-marching before
Came a stark-naked drummer, a-beating a drum
With his heels in his bosom come marching along

They laughed and they smiled, not a soul did look gay
They talked all the while, not a word they did say
I bought me a quart to drive gladness away
And to stifle the dust for it rained the whole day

Sat down on a hard, hot cold frozen stone
Ten thousand stood round me and yet I's alone
Took my hat in my hand for to keep my head warm
Ten thousand got drowned that never was born

Bert Kaempfert,"Strangers in the night, exchanging glances
Wondering in the night, what were the chances
We'd be sharing love before the night was through
Something in your eyes was so inviting
Something in your smile was so exciting
Something in my heart told me I must have you

Strangers in the night, two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment when we said our first hello, little did we know
Love was just a glance away, a warm embracing dance away
And ever since that night, we've been together
Lovers at first sight, in love forever
It turned out so right for strangers in the night",Intro: Strangers in the Night,1968

She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura,1970

Anything that it would tell me
That's the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life's
The thing thing that I can't win

And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you

That he'll only break me heart again
Should I decide to stay

I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels

They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

She may search this whole wide
World over

Bert Poncet,"It’s everything I ever wanted but to be completely honest
We couldn’t do this without you
It’s been lade on our hearts to travel all around the world
Telling all that we meet there’s a thing called love
This is love, this world is not enough
If we did this for the money we’d have quit long ago
It’s because all of you we can let the world know
This is love, this world is not enough
From the sweat that we shared at the show you were there
To the songs that we wrote where you scream every note
From the shows that we played to the house that we stayed
You made us who we are today
It’s everything I ever wanted but to be completely honest
We couldn’t do this without you
With my friends by my side, I could do this until I die
We couldn’t do this without you
From the bottom of my heart to the tip of my tongue

When did everybody stop singing about something that mattered

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,1987
