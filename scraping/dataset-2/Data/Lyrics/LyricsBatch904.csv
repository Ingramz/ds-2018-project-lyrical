Beach Slang,"The night is alive, it's loud, and I'm drunk
Kissing the mic and singing about us
The songs that I make, I barely rehearse them
They're hardly mistakes, they're meant to be honest

Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

I'm way out of tune, turned up to eleven
Floating around noisy heaven
Most of the words stuck in my mouth
But I mean all the ones that punch their way out

Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

Our heads are blurry
Our hearts are sharp things
I bet on you
To make me nervous
To stay dangerous
Good love is not safe

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

The night is alive, it's loud, and I'm drunk",Noisy Heaven (Quiet Slang),2018

Beachfront Property,"It had to be you, it had to be you.
I wandered around and finally found the somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me feel blue,
And even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you.

Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss,
But they wouldn't do.
For nobody else gave me a thrill.
With all your faults, I love you still,
It had to be you, wonderful you,

Nice teacher, teach me something.
I'm as awkward as a camel, that's not the worst,
My two feet haven't met yet,
But I'll be teacher's pet yet,

I pick myself up,
Dust myself off,

And pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,

But you'll be a man, my son!

Will you remember the famous men,
Who had to fall to rise again?
So take a deep breath,
Pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

I'll get some self assurance
If your endurance is great.
I'll learn by easy stages
If you're courageous and wait.

To feel the strength I want to,
I must hang on to your hand,
Maybe by the time I'm fifty
I'll get up and do a nifty.

Those days, those days are gone 
It's time to stop wishing for endings

Empty bottles sitting on a shelf

Talk about lonesome
Enough for you, enough for me, 
And then some

All those loves that you took for granted
Like trees that you never planted
Everywhere is where you've been

Talk about lonesome
Enough for you, enough for me,

Came to me in my darkest hour
Down from Heaven like an angel from above

Beacon,"The feeling’s gone, you waited for too long
But if you just stay the night, we can find some more
We can find some more
We’ll pick up, right where we left off

Though I don't know what to save you from and why

Always doing something
What can I do to stop them from haunting you again?

Little girls and little boys

Girl is the princess, boy's the prince
Feeling secure from the ogre who's sitting in the playground
They've got a jingle in case they fight
That will decide who is wrong or right
Gotta be friends and behave if they both are ever gonna be crowned

Boy's got a toy gun in case of war
And that is just what he's waiting for
Girl rocks the doll's pram pretending the barbie is a baby
Boy tries his best to be hard and cool
Girl to be soft as cotton wool
Prince is the gentleman and the princess is the finest lady

They know exactly what to say

But he wants to show her that she is together with a winner
Outside the doll's house the ogre starts
Shaking the house 'til it falls apart
Princess and prince gotta run unless they're gonna be his dinner

Running together with equal goals
Better be home playing with adults
Mom's saying it's just a game and they don't have to worry
Inside the kitchen the game begins

You listen to the world going wrong looking through a hole in the wall
Shoving our loving away, leaving our light on the side
Never once looking to say, ""We got the ride of our lives""

Did we ever find a way to steer
Through the cold light of day?

And it ain't what you done but it is what you do

With the moon and the room on the wrong side

Just taking a walk in the sun
In time
In just a second like the ghost of a bad idea
I feel myself getting the fear

But firmly they compel us cuckoo, cuckoo

Once again as predicted left my broken heart open
And you ripped it out

Stopped me from believing
Turn me around again
Said that we can do it
Why'know I want to do it again

Who you know who can spit till he pop the real
Never thought about rappin' 'til he coped his deal
I really held down my block for real
All I do is crack rock and how to pop the steel
How to box niggas in where they can barely move
Roll wit straight thugs never scary dudes
Keep bodies on them guns and we share our tools
Deuce one ball for Philly like Larry Hughes
Keep the desert eagle wit the beam tucked by the scrotum
Get locked in jail run a block sell open
Mind went to jail I get dro el's roll 'em
Rookie nigga clippin' niggas like L Odom
I got dough I choose not to spend it

And the trees look around for the sunlight they mention.
Tears fall from the mildew of morning
So dust cannot live when it's placed in its hands by the ocean
It can dream of becoming glass like the sand.
Flames dance on the wall in the house that is dead
Scared of what it's becoming
As water laughs at the heat that's emitted
Now a flame cannot burn when it's starved of the air
That a human must breath in order to hear it's own lies.
See the place where I'm bound
We'll take these comforts so I may drown.
Dig out all my shame leave the dirt for the world to gain.
Rain falls like a bullet that's fired from a gun that is wet
'cause it's unprotected now
Rust forms in the barrel now.

And the rust erodes away under your skin.
Well I am on my hands and knees!

The cage get bust off, the shaft and the stock get cut off
Your cash and your block get cut off

That's Right
Journey Through the life of some real niggas
Some real niggas, You'll never see what I've seen

When I sleep I dream of bodies in streams of blood
Naked bitches, dead nigga's ghost, Feds with toast 
Knockin' my door down sweat poor down my body 
Roast from the heat so I soak my sheets
Wake up shiverin', pull my hoe close to me, she sexy
Every night is different pussy since my girl left me
And I tried to make her stay with me, but I stay busy
And her friends are cut-throats, they deep throat to lay with me
I reminisce how I miss a stare in this space
Resort to the lips of a stripper, sprayin' their face
Lampin' in a mansion, home alone
I hear footsteps, shit I kicks just not lyrics
I hold a fifth, wonderin' if ten shots can stop spirits
If nigga's try to rob me then I won't hear it
Cause it's different from the streets, I'm missin' my hood now
Missin' all the blocks cuz I'm surrounded by woods now
It's supposed to be good now
It's like I'm walkin' tight rope and can't look down
Fire below me
Now the fantasies I have for women are unholy
Success, thousand dollar bottles impress
Models with fat ass and big breasts
Floor seats, Knicks vs. Nets, private jets
Millionaire heir to Antigua, with Ananda, the MTV diva
Nas, how do we survive all this mess? (I didn't survive)
East vs. West the rap game where words became flesh
A whole pound of herb won't desolve my stress
Still I ride to the death, love hip-hop
Cause Afrikabababa was def, a lot of respect
Feel Me? Fuck to the rock Sean John jury
I got the same hands of crap platinum and the crap pyramids
Write about the black experience, sell it to Marimax
Tell me if you feelin' that

Take a journey through the life of these real niggas
The things that they seen it would thrill niggas
If you've seen what they've seen, you would wonder
Through the rain and the pain and the thunder
By the time that you realized that it's goin' down
You may find yourself going underground
When they see that this life is upon us
We would see that there's no one that we can trust

You can never see what I see, motherfucker
Beanie Sigel, the realest nigga from the streets was taught
Stay cased up nigga, stay deep in court
Reminiscin' on that cold cell, deep in thought
Gettin' skinny, couldn't eat, cause the meat was poor
Ya'll niggas couldn't live my life, I've been through it
Streached up in hospital beds, fed fluid
Two bullets hit my leg, one passed through it
Saw the blood and the hole in my calf, looked through it
My life's no joke, I don' played dice with soap
Upstate the case niggas slice your throat
Wear your boxers in the shower when you gaurd your soap
I done seen the biggest nigga's in the yard get broke
I done took blocks through war, took blocks for fall
Took blocks to Wall for box of raw
What you think 33 in the glock is for?
Black fatigues, skullies and binoculars, 
C4, block your doors, nigga's can't stop this war
I show you faggots what this Swatz' is for
Hidding spots in the door for the glocks is for
Read the papers, '94 I took the cops to war
Half of ya'll niggas livin' a lie
Only reason you switchin' up your droid is cause you keep gettin' robbed
I looked that nigga in the eyes before I send him to God

Aiyo, Aiyo, Gansta, Gansta
The Bible has words that Christ wrote, evil men sacrifice goats
I speak all my life under oath
Since a kid, troublesome
Thrownin' shit at little girls jump ropes
Bustin' B-B Guns at stray cats, that was way back 
Watched it die, covered in flies
Then I picked up a stick, try to dig in it's eyes
Makin' dirt pies, na, being buggy-eyed shit
And every other nigga that rap, sound like my shit
I wear chrome 45's with ice on the grip
I don't shoot it, I roll with killers and criminals
With heroin habits they picked up from the penile
They let you have it, all I do is give them a smile
Lifestlyes of the realest, you ain't ruthless you bitch
I got a pine box just your size, I know it'll fit
Your whole life's a mistake, stop holdin' the pen
Kill yourself, come back as a man over again
Cause in this lifetime I'm reignin', slay men
Leave your whole body cold
Your nails grow long, you get gray skin
May this nigga rest in peace, Amen
I run with brave men, straight out the housin', we wildin'
Names engraved in the pavement
Brick building, grown ladies jump off the roof
Nigga get paged, then murdered at the phonebooth
New York streets made me nigga, it's crazy nigga

I'm out for the skrilla
Face it ain't no replacement for this killa
Keep your hands where I can see em
Don't make me nervous
This 4-4 auto mat
You don't deserve this shit
Kids either don't make me make you a believer
I do a lotta talkin' I speak wit the heater
I'll run up in your crib put some in your wig
Your baby's cryin' pop pop pop put some in the crib
And I want everything not just some of the shit
Got niggas comin' home at night like you son of bitch
Nigga done took me off yeah you shook and soft
You can't blink around no crook

Yo what you really know what a thug about
Locked up in the bing no grub about
On the block doin' your thing slingin' drugs about
Tell me what you really know what a thug about

A true thugs speeds his game linked up in bubble
While niggas stay in one lane like the Lincoln tunnel
I refuse to limit my game to one hustle
I don't only sling crack or let the cards shuffle
I know how to play cee-lo set it off like cleo
Ain't no tellin first union or mellan
First nigga that move put two up in his melon
From the 9-2 emberetem parabellum
And I run through cats
I'm a true gun cat
One nickel
One black
Who want that
I done schooled my youngins
Gave tools to my youngins
Broke food wit my youngins
Broke rules wit my youngins
Spark my way outta shit and had bad run in's
Talked my way outta shit and near death come in
Real thugs do what they want say what they feel
They never front they keep it real

[Chorus: x2]

Niggas claim to be thugs you real fuckin' suckas
Quick ass runnin' good fuckin' duckas
Obey the rules when my glock unloads
Cause when I start firin stop drop and roll
Duck behind cars hide behind poles
Know I live by the code anything goes
Real thugs stand up straight they never fold
And they don't know shit if anything ever blows
Thugs don't wanna talk shit out
They wanna spark shit out
Till the cops come an chalk shit out
Blaze wit the toasta extra clip in the leg holsta
Face off like Cage and Travolta

Talk behind their back a thug gonna approach ya
Right amount of stack a thug gonna ghost ya

When I'm giving you everything that I am
Tell me why
When you know you can't deny
The way that I bring it
Cause no one can bring it to you the way that I do 

[Chorus]
When will you see
That there's no one like me (no one no one)
No matter how hard they try to be
Cause they just don't flow (they don't flow)
The way that I flow (The way I flow)
So baby don't fight it

It seems the more that I try
The harder you make it for me to get by
If you only knew how I felt inside
I'm sure you would be so blind 
Cause another like me you won't find

You better think it over before you try 
To say that no one can give you what you like
Cause I know just what you want
And there's no way you can front on me
I hope you see
That you belong to me

[Chorus]

So don't fight the way it feels when I do my thing
Trick don't leave for ten months
Flip on my for those ?
Jay, my friend blunts
I'm tight though, mad that you're platinum plus
Let me find out that some broad got you acting up
Spread your wings so I figure you'll be back in touch
Wondering if whats-his-name will he tap my stuff
Yo, all I wanna do if get this doe together
Even if you want this on the low whatever
Fuck around, it's gonna be a hoe forever
Cause when it's beef, I know that we're gonna throw together
But we got issues nigga, cause what you did for me lately
To be a little skanky with them bitches that hate me
You know the kind, door knockers hollering at that
Them bootlegging bitches, I don't even blink at that
Stop playing, Especially when I'm ? or black

Spin with the drop
Hammer cocks, sent you a shot
Brooklyn motha fucka, we blend with the blocks
Live niggaz, type to spend 10 on a watch
Face lift it
Hit it straight nuttin' to taste wit it
Fuck shots
Cop bottles, whole case wit it
Street war
Niggaz don't beef no more
See the kill for real or don't eat no more
Sleep no more
Hollow tips'll eat you raw
Straight through the right cheek of your jaw (blaow)
Lets get it on
With the guns drawn
Ride or die

Y'all can't do nothing with this here
For one, I pack three 9s like the year
Y'all funny money hustlas

I hold bank dough, dough 6-5-4
While you ho talk that, look for a walk dough
Petty crime niggas
Petty time niggas
Sold petty drugs came up wit petty thugs
Now you got game in you
Wanna be a menace and you got Kane in you
I'll put them thangs in you
I'm a hot lil' nigga
I ain't gotta tell niggas
You came too deep, one fell niggas
I'm layin' in the cut but
Still don't give a fuck
Roc-a-fella forever, Memph man, what what

Peep the kid from P-H-I-L-L-Y

Spit it for them bitches and
Niggas who stay fly
B-Mack, Roc-a-fella till I die
Met Jay, dropped on a album in a week
Without unsigned hype or battle of the beats
The first time niggas heard me
Spit it in the streets
I gave y'all a thousand bars wit Memphis Bleek
Stay strapped, heat in the car under the seat
6 hammers even though we only 3 deep
We clap up niggas
Smack up niggas
Duck tape, rope, and wrap up niggas
Think shit a joke, go head crack up niggas
Get treated like Coke and get capped up niggas
The only thing funny
Is y'all never seen big face money
Till them big face 20s

[Chorus: x2]

Roc-a-fella shit

You about to witness a dynasty

Other
Get down or lay down Ya heard!
No publishin' for niggas
I know y'all niggas wonderin, like,
When them niggas gone stop? (come on)
We got a date for you-
February 31st, 19-neva hate (ha ha)

When you live by the sword, you die by the sword
I'll probablly die in the vocal booth spittin' out raw
Die on stage, rippin' down tours
Die from aids, trickin' out-a-town whores
Die cause I didn't have one in the pipe
Might go out like Raymond, went out on his bike
And die on a death mission, two tec's spittin'
No vest section from my chest missin'
Die cause the jewels in my necklace glisten
In a V twizzy in a wreckless collision
Or die in the streets over somethin' petty
Cause a broke ass nigga tryed ta say I assed bet 'em
Die from a shot from a cig war glock
>From a kid on the block while sittin' in the drop
Or die cause I was on, ain't see 'em comin'
Too late, eight shots got my body nummin'
Die for fuckin' his bitch in his bed
Die cause a nigga thought I snitched ta the feds
Die wit a knife six inches in my head
I could die on death row, sentenced to the chair
Or die cause a nigga pulled his Rosco out quicker
I was high off vodka, hydro, and malt liquor
Die cause I knew I shoulda laid that man
Die cause the cops tricked me ta say that man
Die cause I hesitated ta spray that man
Die cause I hesitated ta pay that man
Die cause my man passed me a empty tool
Die cause I panicked, I couldn't keep my cool
Die cause I mixed all them pills wit Hennessy
Or die cause them niggas in jail, envied me
Die tryin' ta steal the fate of my enemy
I could go out from a case of mistaken identity
Or die cause the door wasn't open, it was locked
Die cause the 4 was broken, it wouldn't cock
Die cause a nigga wasn't focused on the block
Die cause them niggas thought tha coke was in the spot
Die cause another nigga said I said somethin'
Die cause that newsy bitch said I did somethin'
Die cause a nigga was tryin' ta get a name
Or die cause it was just my time ta feel the flame
Might get sparked, might not feel no pain
Or Might go out like dark-skinned Jermaine
Take a couple shots ta the heart, or ta the brain
Got all the dough, don't know the cost of the game
Young buck didn't wanna come off the chain
Couldn't handle the rock, got horsed in the game
I could catch a bad break like Big or Pac

Deke what I tell you! What I tell you!
Look at they face now! You cats cannot be me it's only one me
Look at they face now! Stupid! All of them!
I'm not the second nobody , it's one me
I told you it was gon happen!
You can be that way if you want , it's me
Now look at they face! Look at them crawlin on they knees!
Sigel

[Beanie Mac]
Why niggas can't never just play they part
Gotta be the first ones that say they talk
Say they shared , first ones to say they did
Can't never be they self gotta play that kid
You know the same young buck you let touch the coke
And now that he come up he want to cut your throat
And you gave from the block , put em to your neck
Now he givin you a glock puttin it to your neck
You know that same bitch said don't fuck with him
That nigga no good ain't no trust in him
Two days later see her in a truck with him
Two years later now that bitch stuck with twins
That nigga been broke why now she fuck his friends
Got a lap dance in bars and touch them ends
Time uncovered a veil over people's plots
And the dumb shit they do to get on top

CHORUS: Nafeisa and Beanie Mac
Everybody wants to be a star
Everybody want to be a star , don't want to be who they are
Everybody wants to be a star
Every bitch want to hop in your car , every hater want to give you scars

[Beanie Mac]
Man every fucking day , these no flow niggas
Always in my face , with they promo niggas
I thought I told y'all , I don't know Jigga
I'm not Beanie Sigel , and I don't flow neither
What happened to your keys and dreams of being cracklords
Now it's Trinities , MP's and trackboards
I switched my hustle to get this cream
Now everybody and they mom want to spend $16
I got niggas wastin they change to get in this game
Like shit gon change when they get in this game
You think it's just rhymes and beats
Man this shit's stress time and heat , deadlines to meet
Everybody want to come cry to me , come spit they little lines to me
You shouldn't of lied to me , naw dog you can't rhyme wit me
Like you tied to me , like I don't see what you tryin na be

CHORUS (addition)
Stop tryin na be a star, be who you are
Maybe you will go a little far

[Beanie Mac]
Man I ain't gon lie I thought all the glitz was gold
And like Jay (I watched the truth unfold)
And now that I got a little time in with this rhymin
I found out everything that shine ain't a diamond
Everything that come in a jar ain't dro
ain't no use you spittin them bars you can't flow
ain't no use you gettin that are if it don't glow
And ain't no use you gettin a car if you can't go
Get out the streets , haters will draw you back
Like an automatic weapon that'll pull you back
Load somethin in the brain just to see you snap
I try to maintain but I see they trap
See they plot , you can see me not
You can be me not , niggas want to see me bopped , see me locked
See me in the block , send me shots , do anything to be on top

You must of thought that we was friendly when we told you we was rappers
We Jackers
We want the money

We want the package
Under the god damn mattress
And if the brain splatters don't matter
that's what we practice

Blast the rocket 
Knock off your leg 
Tear through your forearm
Sit you in a chair make your niggas call you short arm
Pellets in your hand You'll never put shorts on

So why don't you come out and play
Make my mother fuckin' day

Potatoes like augrotten

Act like mac won't come through and spark shit up
Where the fuck you get heart from
Little bitch ass nigga started commin' out the fuckin' dark from

And for another nigga to try to take my place is in the wake
It's time I retaliate
I'll make you mother fuckers pay
Now point me to the motherfuckin' yay

You lookin' at a sick bastard
This stick up shit I got it mastered
Glove and ski mask it
Any body move a lick gettin' blasted
When I'm in the crib for your shit and a thick plastic

I got this duck tape stuck in my pocket for one reason
You can stop screamin' stop squermin' or stop breathin'
Cause I didn't come here to stay or play your babysitter 
I came here to split your mother fuckin wig nigga

If your block gettin' money nigga I want in
Run it in

Little suburb nigga never saw the streets
Silver spoon ass nigga never drawed your heat
I keep it the truth what's all the fakin' for
God dam every week I got to break a jaw
And you wonder why I smack up niggas
Shit it's either that or Macs gonna clap up niggas
What y'all want me to do hun soften up 
so my raps can start to soften up
Shit never that
Dog forever my Beretta cat

H4y yo it's over in here
God damn somebody bring me some juice in here

I used to be a drug dealer
Hangin in the cut sellin' dime rocks
Gettin' cash to eat with 
Punchin' a time clock
In the ghetto makin' small change
Slingin' till the sun up
Got to pay my phone bill focusing on the come up
Got 6 shots numbers strait
Crank bout 38 
Big boys trippin' on me tryin' to nigga hate
This 17 year old Tony Montana type

Beanie Sigel,"This shit is not a fuckin game

Chorus 2X
Pac man, y'all niggas know my name
It'll take a quarter key to survive in my game
They call me Pac man, and ain't a damn thing change
Even though I got signed I'ma still slang thangs

Verse 1
Ay yo I cop power pellets (and y'all call 'em bricks)
I make little dots (and y'all chop rocks to flip)
Before junior, they had me out on a chase
Running from these ghost monsters y'all calling the jakes
All I do is stack loot
Run around and eat fruit
And harass these lady cops named Pinky and Sue
My whole life been a maze in a chase
Can't keep still without these monsters on my back invadin my space
I got two hitmen that'll bury you brothers
They rule the underworld
you know'em as the Mario brothers
Straight cannons 
And won't hesitate to shoot you
And they stay goin to war wit that latin King Koopa
I got a worker named Frogger
When I say jump he leap
A highway boy who be runin the streets
Wit that package
Dodgin through traffic that's narrow
And my nigga Donkey Kong bringin weed in by the barrels

Chorus 2X

Verse 2 (Missing Verse)

I take over blocks section by section
Shake under cover cops and make 'em change direction
They best bet is to relax and chill
Sonic couldn't catch me I'm good at track and field
I might run up in your spot
When I'm runnin' from the cops
Sling work a Dime a dot
A hundred a rock
I give out cooked 
Yeah But I only get raw
And I keep a nice stash in case I have a Pitfall
I got a worker named turtle that be movin my snow
He bring strait dough
He just move it too slow
I don't fuck with them crabs I had to blast those boys
I caught them breakin down my rocks like asteroids
Met ms. pac told she could go on a mission
But first she got to let me put in pole position
I wish I woulda knew then what I now know sooner
Cause 10 towns later here come pac Jr.

Chorus 2X

Verse 3

I got drugs for every race, color, and creed
I sling mushrooms to white boys in club Centipede
Donkey Kong was gettin money from slinging weed
I don't know why he want to start a pie factory
We can be partners
That's murda, us connecting
Wit the right blow 
And Burger Time doing the cheffin
We can get doe
Can't let the cops catch us
And if it move slow (still stack blocks like tetris)
Whoever don't want to get down, they stupid
Not the one to jump around these blocks like Q-bit
Ain't nobody out there making no noise
Wit they own route but that nigga Paper Boy
We can take his stuff
He ain't tough he a nut
He always letting Dig Dug pump em up
I pull a plug on 'em niggas if they don't want to set it 
Game over niggas, I'll see you next credit

Don't gotta buy a lotta drinks bitches know my aim
Y'all get them whores drunk just to get some brain
When the Roc in the place, they go berserk
We make em bounce till they motherfuckin' shoulders hurt
Bitches lift up skirts, take off shirts
Fine babysitters take off work
Lose they jobs, panties, shoes and bras
Niggas mad at us 'cause they lose they wives
I don't step up in the club without a weapon in the club
'Cause niggas get drunk and kick crap up in the club
That's why my tool be cocked, niggas mad 'cause my shoes be blocked
And my jewels be rocked
If you a playa, you wouldn't be in my pocket
If you a playa, you like it, you see it, you cop it

If you a playa, you got the three basic niggas
Your trick your lick and your dick niggas
The object never fall in love wit 'em
Run to the malls and the clubs for them
If you a playa, then you choose 'em like a playa
Use 'em like a playa,then you lose 'em like a playa
I bet I'll still be they favorite bitch
Some bought me ice, some paid for whips
C'mon you know the rules in this playa shit
Ain't no such thing as a relationship
If you a playa, get it now like a playa, get it down like a playa
Spit a round like a playa

Playa, bounce like a playa

Jiggaman ya heard?
If you a playa, will you pull up to the curb
Niggas chicks fly the coup when you pull up to them birds
Why the fuck would you bring her
When the rocks on that man got his whole hand lookin' like E-T's finger
If you a playa, keep your cars with the year (year)
Your watch game tight (tight) your hustle over there (uh-huh)
Your house outta sight, your enemies close
And your family tight and never try to make a ho your housewife

How to box niggas in where they can barely move
Roll wit straight thugs never scary dudes
Keep bodies on them guns and we share our tools

Keep the desert eagle wit the beam tucked by the scrotum
Get locked in jail run a block sell open

Lay back, exhale, put the heat up
No stress, no scale, no jail could keep us
Only case we catching now would be a misdemeanor
Remember we used to hustle thinking life would cheat us
Not knowing if we struggled life would treat us
Think on how mommy carried us
Where life gon lead us
Knowing if we getting married
Our wife will need us
If at one time you could look into my mind
When I close my eyes and remember them times
No gas, had a hot plate heat our dinners
No cash, most nights ate sleep for dinner
Welfare and white landlord, that life ain't easy
The only ones moving up was George and Weezy
All my sugar water babies who live in autos, it's crazy

Living life no means of wealth
Eating shit I can't believe myself
That's not a joke

Yeah the road was rough but I made a route
Now picture running extension cords from your neighbor's house
To get lights, fuck Max on the latest routes

Aiyyo, from Boyz II Men to the End of the Road
Yo we boys to the end never been in the cold
You got me, I got you till our souls grow old
He shot you, he shot me, how we supposed to roll
I take a shot for my nigga gimme two to the ribs
Run a spot for my nigga, while you doin your bid
Fuck a step pop these see's gonna know who you is
I get it through to your wiz that it's due to the kids
For my dog, I swear to God I'll sit in a box
Gimme three hots and a cot before I snitch to the cops
Six foot ditch pam box covered with rocks
Tombstone ready die for the love of his block
Know what I want in my life I want for my brother
Know what I want for my wife I want for my mother
It ain't a question on what I would do for my squad
Ask yourself if you really true to your squad

CHORUS 2X
I'ma ride with my niggas
Die with my niggas
Get high with my niggas
Flip pies with my niggas
Till my body get hard, soul touch the sky
Till my number get called and God shut my eyes

[Beanie Mac]
We gon ride 95 till it ain't no gas
Flip and divide ties till it ain't no cash
And til the computers crash, and the dough on plastic
Everything in our path, go through and smash it
Put our niggas over bitches, niggas over riches
Niggas over drugs for my niggas I get slugs
I know my niggas thugs for my niggas I shed blood
My niggas y'all don't owe me shit, just show me love
I'ma get us out these streets, help our family eat
Move us out the hoods, put us in the Woods
Gimme just a second my flow ain't yet perfected
But damn when it is, shit then when it is
I speak the truth don't take this here as no song
Till I'm gray at the roots and my beard grow long
It's me and you ride or die let's weather the storm
Take on the world playboy whatever it's on

CHORUS 2X

[Beanie Mac]
I took bread with my niggas, spot rushed for funds
Took lead with my niggas, and we bust our guns
I shook feds with my niggas, knew where to duck and run
ain't care, where and when and who the fuck would come
We knew we'd ride till the day we die, till the day I fry
Told y'all till I touch the sky
We gon roll, gon flip, touch them pies
Know if I got the six you can touch the five
For my true block niggas I'ma spark for them
I get shot a million times lay in chalk for them
Gimme that 5 by 8 where it's dark and grim
I give anything to see my dog walk again
You can trust me with your wife, trust me with your kids
Trust me with your life, trust me where you live
Nobody know but me, you, and God
Your seed, your girl, mom and my word is my bond

When it's beef people let them desert eagle speak
So whoever, wherever I don't care where we meet
Stop, chill, don't talk shit sideways outta your mouth
I will slap spit sideways outta your mouth
Bitch niggas talk indirect it don't matter
When you got snitch niggas right in your set
That's why I know where you niggas sling coke and pump D at
Same spot that you liable to see me at
Gun and a mask, one in the stash where the seed at
Stop, all my young bucks huggin the block
Stop puttin drugs in your sock
You makin it easy for the cops to catch you
They hooked to that stash and that trash and that bag of pretzels
You gotta hustle smarter than that
Cop coke harder than that, keep your dough apart from your crack
Keep a stash in the dark for the trap
Man you never know when the narks gon launch an attack

HOOK: repeat 2X

Chill, I spit it for my niggas keepin it street
Keepin they steel, all my niggas keepin it real

You can shuffle up the cards I'ma learn the deck
When I do the game is mine, man I'm aimin high
Niggas talk about guns don't be carryin none
Every two hammers I cock I'm buryin one
I'ma dress in all stash this year, whenever I'm near
From the First Union, to Madison Square
Stop, chill, 'cause I know y'all niggas like Mac fuckin that track
Let me show you somethin dog it ain't nothin for Mac
It come all natural like I'm bustin my gat
Or I'm stuck in a spot crushin the crack
Got ice in a pot, fluffin the crack
Takin backs to the block so don't stuff in them packs
Doin life on the Roc ain't nothin fuckin with that
Me, jail, dog, you can put me under the ground
Where I'm from all my niggas they from under the ground
You can hear us when we come it's a thunderous sound
Trees, stompin, Roc jeans and a bunch of white T troopers
Stay on post with they toast and they like to shoot you

I could go before your honor sit and peep my game

Stuck on this mission, go home, my girl fussin and bitchin
Motherfucker won't you change your life, I'm thinkin
Motherfucker won't I change my wife
Ignorant bastard laughin like fuck the rap shit
It's just another hustle, another way for niggas to touch you
Now they know the face of Beans
Now they, see my face on screens and I ain't even chase this dream
I feel sorry for those who did
y'all niggas can't stop the boar, whether rock or raw

And them hoes I gave you
I'm that nigga that'll come and pour salt in your wound

You gotta see what I've seen, look where I've looked
Touch what I've reached, and take what I've took
You gotta go where I've gone, walked where I've walked
To get where I'm at to speak what I've talked
You gotta lay where I've laid, stay where I've stayed
Play where I've played to make what I've made

Niggas want to know if Beanie Sigel life is real
Nigga twenty-five ta life is real
I get a body, take me right ta jail
I know what it's like in hell
I did a stretch in a triflin' cell
What you know about twenty-three and one
Locked down all day, underground, neva seein' the sun
Vision stripped from you, neva seein' your son
You got bricks on the strip, neva see 'em get done
What you know about all day
Them Little Debbies and them Chi Chi's, they makin' you sick
You gotta wash out your drawers same water you shit
Brush, gargle, and spit same water you piss

Or a jailhouse hunger srike
Or you sittin' in your cell and just zone one night 
And you think ""damn, I'm neva comin' home one night""
You got 5 years in, neva been flown a kite

Lifes cold, you be eatin' them swags

In a V twizzy in a reckless collision
Or die in the streets over somethin' petty
'cause a broke ass nigga tried to say I assed bet 'em
Die from a shot from a cig war glock
From a kid on the block while sittin' in the drop

Die 'cause I panicked, couldn't keep my cool
Die 'cause I mixed all them pills wit Hennessy

Die tryin' to steal the fate of my enemy
I could go out from a case of mistaken identity

Or die 'cause the door wasn't open, it was locked
Die 'cause the 4 was broken, it wouldn't cock
Die 'cause a nigga wasn't focused on the block
Die 'cause them niggas thought the coke was in the spot
Die 'cause another nigga said I said somethin'
Die 'cause that newsy bitch said I did somethin'
Die 'cause a nigga was tryin' to get a name

Might get sparked, might not feel no pain
Might go out like dark-skinned Jermaine

Sometimes for the ladies, but this one for my thugs

Hey yo, niggas want to drive by the hood and dump
Come on stupid, I clap up from your hood to the trunk
Foot on the floor, back on the wall, good with the pump
Blast through your stomach, stupid, you can look through your lunch

Runnin the streets, lawless, blastin police
Stickin Furby's out the window, snatchin your niece

Before can I get it and double excel covers
I thought I heard somebody say they want some hardcore
I like everything from my dick to my bras raw

Now, is my street niggas no into this
Now, is my street bitches not into this
Wild loud like my thugs do up in the tunnel
You know the rock ??? itchy finger the tussle

This territory locked, no more room in this hustle
Check the sound scan we getting platinum plaques and bundles
Verses I lye them down, they never die down
If the crowd rile down then fire another round

[Chorus]
Jay-Z: I flow hard for the street, sicka for the club
 Sometimes for the ladies, but this one for my thugs

Fuckin with a crazy cat

Win on stick-ups turn thou' avalanche pick-ups
For the soft and the cooked up they lost when they looked up
Why you think I roll with the Roc?

Shit, everybody I roll wit Hash-E
Everybody I roll wit got
Ain't stopping me from takin over blocks

Beanie Sigel,"Once again 'gain, ladies and gentlemen, yo adrenaline

Yo I'm in the eye of the storm, where the pressure's on
And MC's is dressed funny like a leprechaun
I chop rappers up like chicken seczuan
Sells a squads off like a slave auction
Aiyyo my zodiac sign read caution
On stage, I make your seed to an or-phan
Yo, my age an algebraic equation
Niggas want some? I hit em wit a portion
Son, The Fifth foursome, armed at the door son
M-illi-tilla, Dice Raw, quick draw son
You don't want no more son? That's when more come
And drag a nigga Eerie Avenue to Oregon, you're all done
Ladies and gentlemen
Select the weapon at the gate upon entering, The Roots instrumentaling
Spark shit, them niggas try to talk shit
We hit em like the L at 60th and Market
South Philly clip a hold into a nigga park it
Take sneaks, chains and rings and bracelets
Split back this like we the therapist
Adrenaline, Fifth mic terrorist, once again

Once again 'gain, ladies and gentlemen, yo adrenaline

Zigga zigga zigga tryin to get a grip but still slip, so lift me up
Ever since I was a pup I was designed to erupt
You get to know me, you poke me slowly, when caught puzzin'
Some niggas thought they was, when of course they wasn't
Punked em wit a dozen of pellets all in they skelet
Transform, from the norm, start to brainstorm
Yeah Malik be from The Roots, he ain't gone
I took the wrong exit, the sign said Langhorne
I'm trapped up in about five worlds wit live pearls
Shouts to Armour Akquan who's name is Jalil
The moat is deep water so let your hand expand it
Demandin', takin' you back like Knots Landing
I'm Ralph Cramdon, we out, you'll see in Hampton
Yo what the what the what the, what the what the what the
Pivot on this concrete earth until I rot
Didn't figure how to conquer it yet but still I plot, once again

Once again 'gain, ladies and gentlemen, yo adrenaline

Beans passed the mack and we held em, like hostages
Rappers see me, hide they face like ostriches
Dice'll grind your brain into little sausages
Underwater rap, you know who the bosses is
North Philly baby, that's where that Raw shit is
You'll get blown out the sky once you get talkative
A-D devise rise, I fathered it
So when you see me on the street, don't bother kid
Just be on your merry way, or you might get slit
Ask around, wonderin' what Dice Raw did
Lay you on floors like ya gettin' carpeted
You need a special kind of mic for retarded kids
Me against you's like Kane verse the Partridges
You want to battle, change your name to The Forfeiters
Cause that's what you do, face to face wit raw niggas
I give you a bad case of the fucked-up jitters, once again

Once again 'gain, ladies and gentlemen, yo adrenaline

They used to talk shit, but I'ma quiet them
Kick in the door wit my boys stick to riotin'
First nigga that flinch, I'ma fire em
Tape 'em up, grip his hands, and plyer em
Know the bricks is in here, where you hidin' 'em?
Don't die in the shit that you lyin' in
Used to get fronted bricks, now I'm buyin' 'em
Used to cop off my man, now I'm supplyin' him
Paid the front row seat watchin' Iverson
First class air crafts what I'm flyin' in
To L.A., Shaq, Eddie, Kobe Bryant and them
Save the jokes for Chris Tucker, Richard Pryor and them
Used to shotgun in cars, now I'm drivin' 'em
Used to hustle 'round bars, y'all was robbin' them
Ran up in y'all spot wit Rob and them
Grew up, two-four, wit Pie and em
But do my dirt, twenty first, wit Kyle and them
Nigga Pop, nigga Buzz, little Mark and them
Brother news, nigga schooled Marley Park and them
Nigga jump, pull a pump, low sparkin' 'em
I know shit right now gettin' dark to them
Tore they body all up, ain't no chalkin' 'em
Too sharp for them, move out in the dark on em
These Illadel foul streets what I'm stompin' in once again

Once again 'gain, ladies and gentlemen, yo adrenaline",Adrenaline!,1999

I'm sick of niggaz talkin bout they whips - when they bustin 'em out
Summertime come around, don't nuttin come out
Snappin on they bitch, cussin her out
Mad cause they crack, ain't no crack, they sufferin a drought
Man you know how Mac play when I sling my butter
Take my show state to state like the Ringling Brothers
Keep clowns high-wired off the shit I juggle
F.B.I. eyes spyin from the shit I smuggle
Keep the trunk of the car lined with coffee grounds
The cops pull us over it throw off the hounds
Got a bitch that let me stash shit in the crib
Break her off, every week, to fix up her wig
Man I stay on a mission with whores (shit)
Cause I get down, and ""Get Around,"" like the late Mr. Shakur
Stay in the kitchen with raw
I'm the shit when I whip, I always turn two into four

til you get the shine right and get, that, dough
Stay on the low-low, duckin the po'-po'
Tuck in the fo'-fo' and get, that, dough
You get your team right, and that's the green light

It won't stop why'all, until I drop why'all
I'ma hug the block why'all and get, that, dough

And I'm the chef, I bake, I don't order cakes
If I'm short, shit you caught a break
I can make twenty look like twenty-eight off of water weight
I'm the shit when I'm twistin my wrist
In the kitchen with that thang that got fiends skitzin to hit
From the drugs that I drug in, the NARCs be buggin
I keep my eye on the block and a pie in the oven
Smokers come straight, I ain't breakin off nuttin
Got two thirty-eights, I can break off a dozen
You know how Mac play, when it come to that yea
I got 'em locked up on the block like it's crack day
I fucks with the pipers, ducks from the bikers
Punks on the righteous, bust at the sheisters
Stay in the kitchen with a block of raw
Razor blade play partner straw, yo

Yo, yo, aiyyo I cops that coke, cooks that coke
Chops that coke and give out perks work
Makes that dough, gets them ends
How you want it dog, pipe or syringe?

Ghetto Vision, Roc-A-Fella
Man it's outrageous
And we out",2 Glock 9's,2000
Beanie Sigel,"Here's a couple of suggestions of how you could finesse it
You find a dude in town, you send him a short message
Say, ""Hey, I'm new in town, I don't know my way around
But I got some soft white that's sure to come back brown
I get that butter all night
Cause most niggaz don't know a brick from a bike
They keep buyin hard white
And if you free tomorrow night we can meet and discuss price
FYI, I never been robbed in my life""
Or, you find a chick, shit, you hole up in her crib and
Let her introduce you 'round town like her man
Shake hands, make friends like it's all innocent
Then, before they look up you sellin the town cook-up
Or, gorilla pimp, come up on that killer shit
Take a nigga brick, smack him, then you sell it back to them
Still there Brooklyn?

Yeah yeah that's gangsta, I think I'ma roll with that one

Make out a check for eight hundred dollars
Jigga Man, holla 

1-900-Hustler, Sigel, holla at your boy
Whassup Sig?  This Chris out the Young Guns dog
Whattup?
I'm ready to smash these niggaz in the rap game
The niggaz takin too long with that advance money and shit
Yeah
Talkin 'bout chill, chill don't pay the bills
Yeah I feel that
I know you well connected dog
Let me holla at somebody real
Aight look, I got the perfect person for you, hold on
Bleek, line two

Listen shorty, you wanna roll just give me the word
I ain't got time for a sentence all that shit is absurd
You find a strip first, if you don't cook find a bitch first
If you don't hustle find a nigga who pitch first
You new in town, no red and blue in town, there's gangs
Don't get fresh, let 'em know you small change
The strong move quiet, the weak start riots
We know you got a brick but sell 'em twenties til they tired
With no credit, you know you sick with that gotta eat fetish
And other niggaz who gettin it, dead it
Make 'em an offer that they can't refuse
He resists, box him in, til he can't be moved
Here's the rules: chop it, bag it, stash it, stack it
Get in, get out, that's a O.G.'s classic
900-Hustler, you pass it around
Wanna speak to me direct, hit extension trey-pound, I'm out

1-900-Hustler, Sigel, holla at your dog
What seem to be the problem young boy?
Yo whattup, this Murder Def Kill Homicide Nigga
I got two freaks
Yo watch your fuckin mouth man
Fuck you mean watch my mouth nigga?
Been on hold for about two hours nigga
I don't give a fuck how long you been on the line
Shut the fuck up!  Matter of fact, hold on
I know this nigga ain't just put, put me on hold man
This bullshit-ass elevator music
Free, pick up line five

First things first, watch what you say out your mouth
When you talkin on the phone to hus-tlers
Never play the house, think drought, keep heat in the couch
When you sittin in the presence of cus-tomers
Never hold out, pull out, throw heat and be out
If a nigga ever think that he touchin-ya
Lay low, get cake, whip all over the state
Stash dough, whip yay with, right amount of bake (hoe!)
Nigga too close went right around his place (yo!)
You stoppin dough when we clutchin the gats?
I know you heard ""Friend or Foe,"" this ain't different from that
Make sure you got your four-four and he can slip if he like
Young, Jon Benet daughter missin tonight and yo
Until you up stay away from them dykes and whores
Three smuts, two straights and a dyke
Can pause one-three rumbles two streaks and a pipe for sure
And if it's tight, then he might come back for more
Nine and four, everyday back and forth

I shoulda known better, and I planned to
But dog they be takin me out of my zone like a nigga with a handle

I need to know, cheah cheah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah

You see me with a bodyguard that means police is watchin
And I only use his waist to keep my glock in
But when shit goes down you know who's doin the poppin
And if you don't know, guess who's doin the droppin
S dot again, y'all got him in a bad mood
Bad move that's bad news
How many times have I got to prove?
How many loved ones have you got to lose
Before you realize that it's probably true?
Whatever jigga say, jigga probably do
Shit I paid my dues, I made the news
I came in the door for dolo, blazed the crews
And the streets say jigga can't go back home
You know when I heard that?  when I was back home
I'm comfortable dog, Brooklyn to Rome
On any martin luther, don't part with your future
Don't ever question if I got the heart to shoot ya
The answer is simply too dark for the user
And as a snot-nose they said that he got flows
But will he be able to drop those before the cops close in?

He's probably somewhere where the liquor is takin it's toll
But I ain't mad at you dad, holla at your lad
I grew up pushin snowflake to niggaz that was pro-base
The stress'll take a young nigga, give him a old face
All I did was smoke joke, think and drink
Copped 'caine and complained, front row watch game
I seen niggaz before me, with a chance to write they own script
Slip up and change the story
I seen young niggaz go out in a blaze of glory
Before reachin puberty, scared a nigga truthfully
I took trips with so much shit in the whip
That if the cops pulled us over the dog'd get sick, sniff
Smell me nigga?  The real me nigga, minus the rumors
Holla if you feel me nigga

The streets is not only watching but they talking now?

Hit his click sig' up you fell at it you're dense
I get word to the street like bell Atlantic express
I feel the vibes and I hear the rumors
But fuck it, I'm still alive and I'm still in ju'maa I know 'stafallah
Niggaz wanna press me, put my back to the wall
But pressure bust pipes I know, I spat it to y'all
To know me is to love me, you see me, can't be me, hate this
Fuck you I got guns like Neo in Matrix
Cross the family, think mac's sweet like Cairo
Or soft like play-doh get knocked off like Fredo, Corleone
They find you with a hole in your dome
I roll with niggaz that'll follow you and go to your home
Thought you ball, but nigga you fall to my defense
Catch you while you reachin, clip you then I cross you then I'm leavin
Apply full court pressure
Like four-four ? Get you out of here, pull pressure
To the trigger, bullets fly in three's
You forever rest under bullshit, dirt lies and leaves
I do bullshit, dirt, tell lies then leave
Look in my eyes, realize it's beans

And straight up, divide they team
Trade they man for some pies and a couple of things

Beanie Sigel,"See I was, born in sewage, born to make bomb music
Flow tight like I was born Jewish
Used the streets as a conduit, I kept arms 
38 longs inside my mom's buick
At any given moment shawn could lose it, be on the news
Iron cuffs, arms through it, or stuffed with embalmin fluid
Shit, I'm going through it, mom dukes too
Tears streamin down her pretty face, she got her palms to it
My life is gettin too wild
I need to bring some sort kinda calm to it
Bout to lose it voices screaming ""don't do it!""
It's like '93, '94, bout the year 
That big and mag dropped; and ""illmatic"" rocked 
Outta every rag drop, and the west had it locked
Everybody doing 'em, I'm still scratchin on the block
Like ""damn, I'ma be a failure""
Surrounded by thugs, drugs, and drug, paraphernalia
Cops courts, and their thoughts is to derail us
Three time felons in shorts with jealous thoughts
Tryin figure where your mail is, guesstimate the weight you sellin
So they can send shots straight to your melon wait!
It gets worse, baby momma water burst
Baby came out stillborn, still I gotta move on
Though my heart still torn, life gone from her womb

I'm thinking damn, how my older sister gon' make me tougher
When steel sharpens steel, I'ma keep it real
I'm tired of trying to hide my pain behind the syrups and pills
Dead to the world, stretched out like a corpse for real
Y'all niggaz thinking what y'all reading in the source is real
What my life like, you looking at the source, it's real
What your life like?  mine dog, of course it's real

I guess you all on your deen and I ain't on mine
Stop that akki, 'fore I send shots though your body
Make 'em feel feel hell on earth before allah drop thee
I feel the line's drawn here, nuttin more can stop me
Till them feds pick me up, or them boys pop me
There's only three things that make mac not act like beans
Amatullah tisha, po aldin, samir amin

Shit I know that I'ma see 'em when I leave dog

Now as I walk into the studio, to do this with jig'
I got a phone call from one of my nigs
Said my homeboy reek, he just lost one of his kids
And when I heard that I just broke into tears
And see in the second hand you don't really know how this is
But when it hits that close to home you feel the pain at the crib
So I called mine, and saddened my wife with the bad news
Now we both depressed, countin our blessings cause brad's two
Prayin for young souls to laugh at life through the stars
Lovin your kids just like you was ours
And I'm hurtin for you dog, but ain't nobody pain is like yours
I just know that heaven'll open these doors
And ain't no bright side to losin life but you can view it like this 
God's got open hands homey, he in the midst, of good company
Who loves all and hates not one
And one day you gon' be wit your son

Hey, hey dad, yeah it's your boy
Remember me? I wanna talk to you scrap

I remember being kicked out the house
'cause I looked just like you
Said I'd be nothing but a crook
Just like you
The niggaz in the hood was shook
Where the just like you
'Cause all they said was little whitey look
I'm just like you
But dog I can't see it at all, shit
We never kicked it at all
We never pitched or kicked at a ball
Dog, you never taught me shit
How to fight, ride a bike, fix a flat
None of that sorts of shit

Fuck you left me out to dry, stuck
Gotta  teach news to box
Gotta teach news to bop
And that aint the half of it man
I gotta teach news to block

How they grew to be men and father they sons
Father they daughters
Nigga, you left a fatherless daughter
I never follow your orders
Nigga you make me sick
Pussy you could, ooh
How you gonna leave these memories in the back of my mind
I can see it clear as day you smackin my mom
I 'member that day you showed me that gat, that 9
Put it in my palm when I was young
And said that would be mine, you turned me out
The reason why I hit the block
Reason why I tried to hit them cops
Reason why I started hittin shots
Reason why I started gettin licked
And drinkin syrup and skippin court
Ginger bread man never think of gettin caught
Look at your hand man damn you fought
Nigga you left my mom
Left us with no good-bye's
You left us out to dry
You left us with no letters, notes, (nothing!) no replies
No digits numbers was unlisted
You left us with some of my loneliest night
Nigga some of my hungriest nights
Shit, one of the reasons for years (shit embarrasin)
Damn we used to think money was white
Yeah you gave us life like, fruit from a plant
We aint eat right from them foods from them stamps

Wanted to talk just like him (word)
Often momma said I look too much
And I thought just like him (it could happen)
Wanted to drink Miller nips
And smoke Newports just like you
But you left me, now I'm goin to court just like you
I would say ""my daddy loves me and he'll never go away""
Bullshit, do you even remember December's my birthday?
Do you even remember the tender boy
You turned into a cold young man
With one goal and one plan
Get mommy out of some jam, she was always in one
Always short with the income
Always late with the rent
You said that you was comin through
I would stay in the hallway (waitin)
Always playin the bench (waitin)
And that day came and went
Fuck You! very much you showed me the worst kind of pain
But I'm stronger and trust me I will never hurt again
Will never ask mommy ""why daddy don't love me?
Why is we so poor?, why is life so ugly?
Mommy why is your eyes puffy?""
Please don't cry everything'll be alright
I know it's dark now, but we gon' see the light
It's us against the world
We don't need him, right? (right)

And only a few fit in, your lifestyle's written
So who you supposed to be, play your position
I used to write to the wall, about the Porsche
Now I write for the house and the rob report
I used to think, Bleek and the baddest bitch
Now the, baddest bitch is a average bitch
All I need her is for head and to stash my lead
Push my V, take this key to hempstead
And you run through backwoods, I twist backwoods
And greenery, sha shoo with heavy machinery
You know exactly who these streets belong to

I ship gold, you better watch me now
Many middle in this game, at the top I'm found
I wanted these cats, repping my hood, then go back
Be on the same old bench, with the same old rap

Till the gun is coming through the drivers side of your car
Using my name in vein like I won't damage the boy
You think niggas was shooting you out of canons before (I'm that nigga)

Than they turning over Rovers like they want it with Hovah
It's not about rich and po', nigga, it's about Richard Poe
Understand I'm here to get this dough
It ain't about Brooklyn or Harlem
No more them it's about fame or stardom
It's about me being on blocks you borrowed from

Gripping a bag tight while y'all living a mad life

Head back to the honeycomb to break down figures
I love 38's but the trey pounds bigger
Throw in the bank, trucks the size of tanks now nigga

And dog when the crack ain't around, the smokers'll brawl
Streets like a bullet in cancer, it'll swallow you up
Or eat you from the inside and hollow you up

And everyday like a test, you know life got rules
And its sorta like checkers and chess
I went to school and took the lessons punk
Know a pawn get kinged, a bishop get juiced

A rook get jumped
Faggot niggas took the easy route
They either coked out, smoked out, doped out
Niggas took the needle route

And I ain't tryin to take either route
I'm tryin to stop get weeded out
Really, tryin to weed it out
No the flipside we choosin your way

And this artist only speaks on the signs of the time
And I pop pills in purple rain to state my pain
They say I'm just like my father, bold and too cold

But you know that's how a thug ride
I send a kite through a dove in a jail where the thugs cry
I feel your pain when you restrained and your love die
And make your heart hard, the blood in your vein fry

Feel like I'm trapped and I'm blindfolded
But my eyes wide open to see it
Feel like the O'Jay's, climbin those stairways hopin
Heaven's gates wide open for me

Look towards a lie, Sige in direction
Still I spin in every direction, seekin directions
Tryin to balance out the good with the imperfections
Yeah I know I still move with nowhere to go

Just to make it to the bottom to see faces of the people that I shot
When I get high late night, flow through the bottom

See she just died, she got cancer from smokin and drinkin
The same shit that I'm drinkin and smokin
I can't lie, wish life would just open its handcuffs
And let me go, I feel like I'm doin a bit

I can't slide, so what I'm a rapper?
I can't escape the wrath of the law if I crash up my whip
Or get, blast in the jaw
Prick, masterded his fifth

I might go triple platinum, become a household name
After a long day of out of town work make my way to the plane
Plane fast in the tenth

Bullet in ya gut a have a bag catch ya feces

20 months, vision quest, sleeping in a tepee
Since my dad died, attitude worsened
That's why I stole cars before I could write cursive
Thousand miles from being rich, stuck on my grind

Try to sale nickel bags like Louie Baton
I'm young, I'm good, best shape of my life
One shot from big shit a blow you out of ya Nikes
Only a dick head wouldn't want to be rich

And do his car like school and drop out in the 6
You could look at my wrist, It wasn't shit on it
But I was determined to get a little gliss on em
The 40 ounce bottles done turned to Cris on em
And every bitch that was fronting, I'ma piss on em

But you remember those latter days
Them tubleware, soul food platter days

That was ya mom little hustle on a Saturdays
Back then, when it really didn't matter days
You would take that beating
'Cause you wasn't trying to be

The only one who missed the house party on the weekend
Knowing that them project chicks was in there freaking
Grinding off ""As We Lay""
Walk with me why'all

Back in the Day, you and ya man slap tapping away
Pitching chains, playing craps everyday
Getting high on the block
Green bottles of private stock

2 dollar 40's
Sparks tell ya story

[Sparks]
I come up fragile and timid
Pressed to the limit
12 years old, no household
From the start I was finished

Disowned by the biologicals
And adopted by rolling stones on corners, sipping Thunderbird
Banging needles and pushing stolen Regals
And with no hoe and no money, layered my hunger pains daily with rice and gravy

Stuck between a rock and a hard spot as a juvenile
Just made me want to holla ""Lord help me""
But I had will power
Stole a burner from Uncle Lester

And that .22 long blossomed to wild flower
Now when I enter rooms the conversation stop
And them cock suckers whisper
These faggots ain't got no cahunas

So if they so much as touch me
I cock back and put like bananas on them mokey motherfuckers
Show no love for these cock suckers
Weeping

Who can't deal with life situations cause that's money to me
Uhh

The youngin' out the clique
Moves like Carl Lewis when it's coming out the clip
Uh, Still in school, all the learning I can get

Focused, trying to purchase all the burners I can get
I know plenty niggas fell, trying to chauffer through this shit
These niggas tell, then a murder gon exist
It's no joke in the hood

Especially when the boat ain't make it across
And we ain't got no coke in the hood
That's where rap come in at, more notes in a book

Do even asked me the reason...

[Freeway] 
Yeah I know,you hear freeway everywhere you go
Before rap you see freeway everywhere you at
You can bounce, he move yayo heavy with the crack
Now I'm in there like Prego with the ROC

Thick like labels with mack
Now I do doughnuts on the cops,keep cradles of stacks
And you now when you hot when niggas hate on ya' tracks
And you know when you shot when bullets come out ya' back

For words coming out your mouth watch the way you rat
'Cause I'm from the streets and you will hate the way I act
With a SK, Nine, or a Dillinger pick the heat
Mad cause' I lounge in a 8 Cylinder pick a beat

Fuck it up, holla at Julio get it checked
My squad do circles like Hula-hoops with ya' freaks
Send her home after giving us neck, you can't sleep
Wonder why ya' girlfriend not giving you sex
Same nigga you told can't stop hustlin' won't eat,uhhn!

[Chorus: x 2]
Tell me how we know,
This we lead will take us places that we don't want to go
Now I really want to change,but I'm chasing change
Trying to ease the pain, shelter for the rain
I don't want to hurt no more

[Omilio]
Yo, since a buck I been a knuckle-head
Half of the stuff you said, went in one and out the other ear
You break ya' neck for what I asked for
Pops wasn't around one of the reasons why I'm hustlin' now

One of the reasons why you strugglin' now,
Wit' three one your own, workin' the night shift and leavin' us home
It's cool mom, I just couldn't got to school mom
'Cause of rappin' cause' of that you 'bout to move mom

Boy make moves mom, soon mom, trying to get us away
From them nosey neighbors and the boys in blue mom,
But I remember them times, no food in the crib
Nobody taking timeout schoolin' the kids

In school with the kids they got they Timb's on
Buttered up, it wasn't right
I'm up in there my slim's on button up, it's alright
But they ain't never clown me, they see pain up in me
I had a little Sugar Shane up in me

[Chorus: x 2]

[Beanie Sigel]
Why that cat gotta be pushin' them Bently's
Back to back like that , cause' god meant me 
You little dirty punks ain't ready for the boy
Load four thiry chunks and eatin' seventy more

What makes you say that is it cause I'm laid back
Spinnin' through them wheels of fortune like Sajak
Pump your brakes scrap, I only spit it for ya'll
Niggas like my nigga Mark eatin' space packs

Ya'll niggas want R.I.P but I'm CEO
I remember I use to see CC
Cop, cook, and collect 
My nigga Kyle use to cook it the best

But for you crooked cops I got a 40 cal that'll cook up
Ya' chest, paralyzed my man, slimmed his legs and
Paralyzed his chance, I know Allah got plans 
But still I reminisce at night this can't be us this
Can't be right

[Chorus: x 2]

[Omilio]
It's funny me chasing change
Made my whole life change, got me a range
Slammed in the bing, freedom snatched away
Hug my momma from a K, 

Watchin' a tear roll off her face 
But mom is hurting no more

Beanie Sigel,"[Verse 1]
I been seeing crack rock, since the age of thirteen
Out the same crack spot to the same damn dope fiends
Burnt up glass and the coke screens
You know that balled up cash where that dough cream
Hit the block before the birds start chirpin'
Scope the set before I serve one person
In between cars, never out in the open
I don't trust vans and I hate black suburbans
Crack that I'm servin', pure buck tour, nigga
Uncut raw, nigga. I don't fuck with bake
I don't never get stuck with weight
Open shot, every smoker wit' a straight, brush my gate
You ain't makin' no dough 'cause you stretchin' your shit
Fuck tryin' to make more, dog, I'm stressin' to flip
Keep smokers on them red caps, stressin' to hit
Dope fiends with they hair back, catchin' they drip
I'm tryin' to show you where the bread at. You catchin' my drift?
But I see where your head at, you stressin' to bitch
Give me that hot plate and pyrax pop
Shit, I'll show you how to fire that rock, supply that block
Pee pop set up shop, wit' a half a block
Lock down half the block
Turn that half a block to other half his' block
Then I'll lock down the other half a block....

I don't give a fuck about the chatter in the background
Never put my straps down, nigga
This is Mack Town, nigga
Ask around, bitch nigga I never was
Kept leather gloves and the 38 tar snub
On the real, ya niggaz don't know me
Don't get found in the lake wit' eight shots like Kobe
It's the Gouch, what you talkin' bout homie?/ 
I'll make your bus stop short like Gary Coleman
""I got more pots and strips then you..."" (I make it hot)
""....niggaz won't even sell nicks to you."" (not a rock)/ 
I spit phrases that'll thrill you
I got gats wit' clips wit' lasers that'll kill you
Got myself an uzi brother, nuzi two nines
These thugs gon' getcha (getcha), slugs gon' hit cha
""I got more gats and tecs than you..."" (I'll make it hot)
""... niggaz won't even stand next to you"" (I tear the rock)
When I clap down, back down your wack friends
For that ""Cash Money,"" pull out ""Mack 10's""

You dudes ain't worth it, keep them funny jewels (whoa!)........

I spit shit like my ass talk, dog, it's Mack Mittens
Don't make me raise up and put my hands on you
??a house sellin raids nigga, I'll put my grams on you??
Man, I'm so fuckin' deep in the game
Got one foot to the street, the other feet to the fame
I'm seesaw, tryin' to balance shit out
Until then, I got a six gon' silence shit out
Want to make the transition, from the street to the fame
But I can't let it weaken my game, man listen
Picture Mac flippin' like a transmission
Little nickels, wit' slick fifty's tryin' to stick me
Knowing one shot from a glock could stop my injured block
So I quickly move, oars like Jiffy Lube

Reputation is everything so go at with ya life
It's just like credit the minute ya fuck up you ruined it ya know

Yo as young adolescents (aha) mommy said we was so precious
I mean who knew round to O.D to Heron and I'd catch cases
Let my life slip inside the hands of these judges
Where did we go wrong ha?
Was it these missing father figures?
Or watching mom struggle and feed us
Come on I need answers
It's gak on the judges for turning burners on niggas who try to merk us
On the day of judgement who knows
Until then we'll never know so for now I'm a do Omilio
Drunk then a muthafucka disrespecting bitches

My life make me want to holla sometime and throw in my hand
But I won't fold you know how I roll
I live that life of a trouble man and play by the code
Where I'm from just make me want to holla sometime and go get my gun
Go all out but I think of my sons
Then I look where I was at how far did I come

You see lady's prostituting wearing tight leopard
My sneaks was dogs like Pit bulls and German shepherds
Fuck where it came from I needed money fast
White boys bangin' Led Zeppelin went in twenty bags
So I got my first pack on fifty first and Market
I ain't want clothes I just wanted some boss to mark it
No moms to call no dad to be
Stuck on the streets stomach growlin' like a dog showin' his teeth
Life ain't sweet life ain't a game
I know life is more real then Slick Rick chain
Everybody get a hand so play the hand you dealt
And there's nobody to blame fuck it blame yourself
You can go all out and try to reveal
Like a nuclear staying how you write in a cell
You just better pray a liar and hope you prevail
I know living in the hood is hell, come on

My life make me want to holla sometime and throw in my hand
But I won't fold you know how I roll
I live that life of a trouble man and play by the code
Where I'm from just make me want to holla sometime and go get my gun
Go all out but I think of my sons
Then I look where I was at how far did I come

Yo right now I'd like to take the time to thank my family members
And phoney homies for turning they backs on me
Make me stronger help me deal with snakes and side guys
Going but I was grooming like a rodent
And I swear these streets will turn us boys to men
I'm the pain with juice and gin try to stack them Horace Grants to a million
Playing Caesar how I blessed them bitches
Excuse my arrogance but baby clone me
This petty world a kill me slowly take away my grandma mami hold me
Life obstacles is getting stressful that's why I don't come around
Written between the paper line examples of my lifestyle
So read inside the guidelines ain't no sunshine
Until you break the chains and fly freely 'cause I know for a fact
Somewhere out in the world somebody need me
To make em smile and appreciate em believe me
But main'tain in the main while baby
Omilio'll be there for you knahmean shit I'm a trouble man

Why must I push the crack
I was forced into it
I was going through it pushin' that Buick
It wasn't all good a week ago (eh ah)
Shit been bad for a while
I was forced to put that crack in the vile (You know it)
Pockets was low, mind wasn't right
So I had to play the corner with the nine every night
So I crushed competition
Killed the drama
Sold goods like Excedrin
Syrup like Aunt Jemima
Money was coming, niggas was hatin'
Send bullets through they fame till they Harlem shakin'
Treated crack like rap
And I move them units
And the way I tuck paper niggas thought I was Jewish
Had the fiends snortin' blow like the K-9 unit
And I finally got that paper to park that Buick
Got the aero dynamic Benz wagon
So carefully crafted
When I pulled on the block I just smashed it

Keep your eyes open youngin'
And tell them fiends I said no short, no change
And I'm payin' em weekly
And I'm payin' silly
You pay em' Friday you won't see em' for the rest of the weekend

Cause some like to skim off the top
Mixing they little caps in with my rock

And dog when the crack ain't around, the smokers'll brawl
Streets like a bullet in cancer, it'll swallow you up
or eat you from the inside and hollow you up
And everyday like a test, you know life got rules
and its sorta like checkers and chess
I went to school and took the lessons punk
Know a pawn get kinged, a bishop get juiced
A rook get jumped
Faggot niggas took the easy route
They either coked out, smoked out, doped out
Niggas took the needle route
And I ain't tryin to take either route
I'm tryin to stop get weeded out
Really, tryin to weed it out
No the flipside we choosin your way
Like gettin fat from losin the weight
or losing that from, usin the weight
I feel like I'm speeding and I'm 'bout to crash
No where to go and I'm gettin there fast

Ooouu hooouu, I got nowhere to
Ooouu hooouu, got nowhere
Ooouu hooouu, I got nowhere to run

We in the streets player get your man
There's only two places to go, we either dead or in jail
What the
Ooouu hooouu, I got nowhere

Eh yo I'm caught up in the system where the blind lead the blind
and this artist only speaks on the signs of the time
And I pop pills in purple rain to state my pain
They say I'm just like my father, bold and too cold
But you know that's how a thug ride
I send a kite through a dove in a jail where the thugs cry
I feel your pain when you restrained and your love die
and make your heart hard, the blood in your vein fry
Feel like I'm trapped and I'm blindfolded
But my eyes wide open to see it
Feel like the O'Jay's, climbin those stairways hopin
Heaven's gates wide open for me
Look towards a lie, Sige in direction
Still I spin in every direction, seekin directions
Tryin to balance out the good with the imperfections
Yeah I know I still move with nowhere to go

[Chorus]

It seems like we grind from the bottom
just to make it to the bottom to see faces of the people that I shot
When I get high late night, flow through the bottom
My aunt's house, one of the places that I stopped
See she just died, she got cancer from smokin and drinkin
The same shit that I'm drinkin' and smokin
I can't lie, wish life would just open its handcuffs
and let me go, I feel like I'm doin a bit
I can't slide, so what I'm a rapper?
I can't escape the wrath of the law if I crash up my whip
or get, blast in the jaw
Prick, mastered his fifth
I might go triple platinum, become a household name
After a long day of out of town work make my way to the plane
Plane fast in the tenth
Hear mayday, mayday, control's outta work
How the hell can life end like this? Nowhere to go

When it come to coke you cant outwit me, mine cheap
Bout to take over the city of Philly like John Street
Nigga ask all y'all fiends, they call me Chef Boyar-Beans
Beanie Crocker, cook coke proper
Right amount of flour siffin' it up
Coke spots runnin' by the hour shiftin' it up
Graveyard shifts, move packs in bundles
Braveheart kids, use gats don't rumble
Gorilla niggas goin' ape in this concrete jungle
Banana clips'll make them monkeys humble

Beanie! Sigel was the name that they gave me
Beanie! Sigel was the name that they gave me
Beanie, Beanie Sigel was the name that they gave me
Beanie! Yeah, but guess who back

It's Mack, bitch uh-huh, back in the mix or the scuffle
I'm in the hood with them chips like Ruffles
Boxman, Frito Lay, for that free dough boxin'
You will lay, nigga I'm not playin'
Listen, whether I make cash or take cash
I'm in the hood eatin' with my dog like when we break-fast
B's on the hood and the wheel and the brake pad
Shit when I skate past, bitches shake ass
I sit four-thirty deep in wheels
You bout, four-thirty cheap in wheels, small Benz
Look at your small rims, small wheel, small grill
Big Beans, sittin' in Bentley my heart peels
Zero to sixty so quickly how you want it? You can have it
Drop top, stick shift, automatic
Back wheels still smokin'
64 still rolling, 3 wheel motion, it's ferocious

[Chorus]

Mack, hey yo
On the low doe (shh!) the whole city is mine
I'm trying to flood the whole city with dimes (yeah)
I'm in the kitchen yeah, with that vision wear
Get them digits clear you can come and get them pigeons here
Niggas talk about the crack game slowed up, bullshit
You switch to hustle when the rap game showed up (uh-huh)
While you wastin' your time spittin' the rhymes
I'm gettin' mine spittin' them rhymes, but still pitchin' them dimes
And the spot still sick with da grime
Glock 26 nigga but I'm sicker than nine
I'm live with the pound, small silencer calmin' the sound
Stick with the seven, strickly smith with the seven (shit)
When I drop back and cock back
And pop that, I'm poppin' for keeps
I'm not gettin' stopped in the streets
Imagine that a nigga tryin' to rock Mack
Only nigga did it was Jay and he did it when I signed the contract

Fuck with that money paper then

Light as a rock, gonna light up the block
Don't believe in cases, goin all out
Paintin' faces, switch my picture, like tradin' places
For that money what?

Everybody hands up, or hands down money tucked
I flip the money trucks, money I don't give a fuck
Ay money, shut the fuck up
It's only a stickup

You don't stand a chance, give it quick up
You 'bout to turn into an ambulance pickup
Enough with the cocky stuff, fuck all that stocky stuff
Don't get smacked like a hockey puck

I ain't wit' that rocky stuff
I'm strapped got this gat (Blah blah blah blah)
What?

I'm high off them cocktails
Dangerous gone broke, my aim is no joke
Duct taped, roped, strangle your folks

Box cut across the throat (nope)
Bang the four 'till it's broke
Prey on niggas in a circlular pattern
Catch you playin' craps, car in reverse

I'm circlin' back
Man I stay up in them dice games, fuck a ice chain
A Ice ring, I'm tryin' to come up on some nice change
Incase a nigga might swing, they gets a might thang

Pull out the right thang, show em it's a spike thang
Make you do the right thing, like a Spike Lee joint
Bang that pussy and his right knee joint
You get the sergeant and cap couldn't tell mack (freeze)

I'm like a rat dodgin' traps when it come to the cheeze
Backwards wrapped my trough
Won't hesitate to clap ya folks
I'm on tilt like a rapid (?)

Back now nigga, all black down nigga
Mack now, loaded up wit' black towns nigga
Frontline, clap down, backround niggas
One nine clap crowns, and smack down niggas

Keep rope to hogtie you pork ass niggas
Stuffin' the boot to shoot hoops you sports ass nigga
Wouldn't shoot a game of pool
8-ball in the corner pocket, stop it

You niggas flippin' Guess jeans profit
Disrespectin' eskell, expectin' to sell
You got seeds in ya weed, disrespectin' the L
Don't got 20's on ya wheels disrespectin' the car

You burnin rubber and that squad, disrespectin the tar
You niggas wore ass backwards, 'vessinal gat
Same thing with your hustle, rustled and packed
The ball back on missions

Drop the east the mack more vicious
Back to snatch or crack off dishes

man, I paint word pictures on the canvas of life
but I don't control the colors

Yo, I'm ten steps ahead of niggas, that shit scary
sometimes I feel ahead of myself
I hear this voice in the back of my mind
like ""Mac maintain, just grind, dog, better yourself""
So what I do?, I take heed and pick up the pace
can't explain it when I pick up my son & look at my face
I'm like a black rose growin' in the concrete crack in the pavement
there that voice go again ""Mac practice for greatness,
get paid for them immaculate statements""
Keep thinkin of them hotlines, like a physic, I can't explain it
There's no pen when I write it, there's nothing like it..

God damn, what you want from me, what you want me to tell you huh?
Niggas thought that I would stutter huh, thought I was dumb

But I ain't used to use my mind, I used to just... use my 9
and run wild with my boys, in the streets wild with these wars
now the Qu'ran and 48 laws, they polish my floors
I'm moving niggas like puppets with no strings attached
It's nothin' for Beans, so you know it ain't a thing for Mac
to look in your eyes, see through your heart, know what you fearin'
pick you apart, like you niggas is transparent
(I see right through you niggas)
It's like Mac was born with advanced parents
I'm like the Sun shining at night,
imagine it dog, I know you want to see me gradually fall
but I'm walkin on air, braking every gravity law
nothing like it...
I spit words that skip through air
let the words of a true thug hit your ear,
it change colors like blue blood when it hit the air
it's nothin' like it...

God damn, shit, I can't explain it
Fuck y'all niggas

I changed my whole life.. in about 9 months, just like sperm in a womb
these young niggas never learn 'til they doomed
try to tell them ""you can burn young punk, without smelling the fuse""
make you shiver in the middle of June,
paintin' pictures so vivid, you can hang it up in your room
shine bright like a prism, displaying colors like Crayola
think of the prisons with straight soldiers
think about the niggas who fucked us and played over us
think about the mothers who suffered and prayed over us
Just look at the the picture I've painted, it's so perfect
open your eyes motherfuckers, you can't duck us
no survivors every soul shall suffer,
I'm loadin them revolvers every shell shall touch ya
I promise I'll light your ass with these mags, I'ma bust ya
God damn it's nothin'  like it, I'm serious

can't explain how I write it..",Nothing Like It,2001

Get on the floor, clap a second time
And make sure I flat-line you
Let a whole round go, hit niggas behind you

Twin sub oozies, can't budge or move me
Nickels stay chubby, smokers never choosy
Don't gotta yell up the block, they come to me
Packs with colorful tops just like coochies
New jacks with they pack they like, who he?
I'm not playin, knock them things off quick
Got game still think off shit
What you say?

[Bleek]
With a partner like Sigel, don't come a dime a dozen
We could be brothers, we better known as cousins
As we climbed the chart with who the fuck want what
My hood to your hood, we showed the world crew love
Who want to play with that Roc-A-team?
Know that I tote that thing that knock sixteen
You walk around talkin' this and that
How I sound like Jay and all my records is wack
But when I dropped the LP, niggas thought it would fold
Thirty days later, Coming of Age went gold
What you sayin?

Now party people it's time for this question
No knock knock, who's that? who's there? or who is it?
It's the M-A-C-K
Yes the gun clapper, the duct tape, rope, black mask and kidnapper
The flow dope, the beats just blazin

For a sucker to attack the cat with two gats
Yo Bleek, you got my back, show 'em how we do

I spit 9 to 5 nines, Bleek for hire
Your crew murderize, see the guns that I'm bringin
In an all out battle, Bleek come out swingin'

Can you feel it? I know the truth hurts

Simple - harsh life, harsh verses
""I can't believe the mouth of this prick
He said put his mouth on his dick,""
I know we gotta talk bout that, I know you salt bout that
You on the tip like I don't like you
I got four kids, three baby mothers, I'm just like you
Sometimes I wanted to just fight you, shit
Swing on you - think I'm playin man, I'm just like you
I was a kid with a puzzle
With missing pieces tryin to put it together dawg, you put it together
You made me have to foot through the weather
In the storm with no raincoat
I don't only speak on me, I speak upon the kids in the same boat
Ridin the same water, same situation
Same fatherless daughter - I hate you, that's in your mind
Don't get caught up in the rhyme
You think I dissed you now, that I don't miss you now
Don't be a hater now, be glad I made it now
I know I probably rubbed you the wrong way
But fuck what the song say, for the record, check it

Still got love for you, though you left me in the cold
To face this world alone, and make it on my own
I still got love for you, but I just can't fight the pain
It's so hard not to hate, but you grow up in a way

Listen - that was my hurt in my heart talkin, along with the truth
I would thirst often as a youth cause of you the person
Moms nursing self-esteem issues
Round the house it's hard to find a clean tissue, minus her tears
To rewind this time I promise I minused my years
To the day to take the pain away
Seemed sunny outside, always rained on Jay
Pop you my umbrella, come help your son with the weather
Soon we come together like man and man and build
Play space, cards face up, I've come to deal
In order to get right we gotta deal with this wrong
And the pain I felt all my life you feel in the song
Your lack of warmth left a chill in the morn'
Your lack of love, left me loveless, and I'm of your breath
I'm your mind body and soul, your heart, your flesh
Your alcohol, your smoke, in results I'm a mess
And dad, still I love you no less dad
Hope you didn't think success would make me less mad
But not mad, just disappointed - we wasted years
I swear to God, may you take me away from here
If you taught me anything
The one thing you taught me is to face my fears, coward
How could you let me grow without you?
Grind in this rap game, take dough without you?
Wear my Pro Keds close to the sole without you?
Family pictures pose without you - WHY?!
Why shouldn't I be mad?
Monster's parents separated, Monster had his dad
These parents had they problems, he still came to the pad
He bought 'em new bikes, imagine what that felt like
Used to have to butt my head to go to sleep at night
Nigga you did me wrong but the love is strong, let's move on

Omillio Sparks, the young gun
My life as an adolescent, said I'll go through something
Other guys try to stand in my way like brick walls
So I kept guns in my palm like Messiah scripts in Psalms
I should fear no man but God
So, Lord knows we could get it on
Guns baptized guys testing my pride
Clearing my conscience in the liquor store
With a fifth of Thunderbird, but I be guzzling hard
Playing the corners with a washed-up old-head
Chant tunes by the Whispers
Same corner where I banged at with niggas
Cops drive by and grin on us
If they grabbed then 
One of them nosy neighbors done snitched on us (Again?)
Hey, this game juicy got me puffing loosies
Every two days interrogated by the police
See, this life I live cost more than your Roley's money
It cost my homey Nook his whole life, ya heard me?
When he was here, it was easy to love him like a brother
Now that's he's gone I find it difficult to talk to his mother
I mean, what do you say to a woman
That's just lost her only son to the game and the gun, except 
""Mami, I'm a ride for him.""?
The look that she gave me like, ""Sparks, you got some nerve.""
'Cause most of these niggas don't keep their words
Now I'm under pressure
And I can't even break that type of promise 
And y'all niggas paint that picture
Risking your freedom
On the strength of memories of him
The time he made you laugh
The time he bust his gat when them other niggas ran
How real is that?
Omillio Sparks, niggas, holla back

[Chorus x 2]
In this life you not promised tomorrow
So take the bitter with the sweet and maintain
In these vicious streets

I'm back to the block with it
Wait, let me clear that up
I'm back to the blocks that you get when your block get it
Get hard with that hot water when the pot hit it
Get large with a little water when you pop wit' it
I send hope to late scramblers
Sling coke to you late you scramblers
Go broke, sling soap to you late night scramblers
No joke, I'm a crook; catch hooks broke; late night gamblers
Look, you loose limbs when fuck with him
That be I strapped and high
FBI all on back, want to trap the guy
Got niggas in all black want to snatch my pies
Never that, too many gats
Too many guns
Too many vests
Tough guys, not too many left
Where they at?
Dead or locked behind bars in jail
I know I ain't too far from hell
I'll spit the devil these bars in hell
Dog, I been through it, son
Look at my scars and tell
Catch Mac in a Chevy truck slightly tented
No excuses on who might be in it
You know passenger twisting backwoods
Slightly spinning
Crack the window, the indo slightly scented
Splash of haze and hash lightly blended
Put the pressure on niggas who might be timid
Like, you got like a minute
To put the cash in this bag or ya ass just might be in it
In small piece, I'll snatch your family up
Start from tall nephews to your small nieces
Bitches

When I was five years old, I realized it was a road
But at the end, I ain't seen lots of pots of gold
I seen a long cell block, the box, the hold
Six hundred fenced in, some innocent, some rotten souls
Some men with men, stop it, whoa
I ain't runnin' up in shit but a broad on her back
Tryin' to cop a small hammer, move out like Shawshank
with Redemptions, I got my mind on revenges
They tryin to kill me at the same time keep me alive
I'm movin' out like Adebisi on +Oz+
With my skully on tilt, two whacks in my palm
Posted up in the yard, everyday I think of pokin' the guard
Throw a crack a nigga turnin' me in
Tryin' to crack a nigga turnin' me thin
Food soakin' in lard, news fools get opened in cards

Can you tell me what you live like?
Can you tell me what that bed like, what's that cell like?
What's livin' in hell like? Tell me do you eat right?
Do you even sleep right?
Yo, tell me what your life like
Tell me do you sleep nights, tell me what that life like?
Gettin' no kites like, no flicks like
Make you want to quit life

That's forever like a motherfucker
Without a letter from a motherfucker?
It ain't even bout the cheddar from a motherfucker
Write a kite, some flicks from a motherfucker
Some drawers, some socks, some kicks from a motherfucker
I can't believe I'm doin' this bid for you motherfuckers
I'm down for another joker case
I was dealt this hand, and I'ma play it with my poker face
On the block ready to poke a face
I got an L goin' around with a smokin' case?
You steal the deodorant out of CVS, you locked for retail theft
I got it body half a block stolen DT vest
My rap sheet read three D abreast
Dangerous, duct tape daughters
I take to the street, like a duck take to water
Get your duck game in order
My bust game in order, I fluffs 'caine with water

and can't do shit, but suck it up, be strong and shit

Told the law about the drops you make
How your clientele first started to escalate
Givin' him keys to your crib, was your next mistake
At that dinner table, breakin' out that extra plate
You can't turn a career addict off his coke habit
Put him on post with the toast that promote static
Back to the operation, they got you locked at the station

Aiyyo, I've been kickin murder - since Adidas with thick strings

Four finger rings, black belts with brass names
I was spittin flames since niggaz was pitchin change
I'm a hard knock kiddo, always played the middle
Threw flacks in the crack game, getchu if I can getchu
Since a buck, played the highway, dodgin the troop boys
Jumpin in and out of Coupes, wavin for Duke boys
Always chased a penny, copped quarter waters
Tried to make a dollar chased my pop's boss daughters
Tryin to make my name, global, in all four corners
Philly baller, gamin in all four quarters
Never worked, never will - all my hoes buy my clothes
I can't go broke, never will - all my bros buy my O's
I'm the best thing that linked up with New York since Sprewell
I murder, nuttin further - fill in the details

When I drop, why'all gon' realize it's all real
Bein left for dead, tied up, smoke 'til I was dried up

Life was rough, but now it's nothin to hide
Used to click and be quick to put this gun to yo' side
Be like, ""That chain nice - I like that pal.
Matter fact {*click click*} I'd like that now.""
You've got game? Call the name, just spell the name right

It's prophecized I'd write, spit scriptures mind blowin
'til my coffin top close and heaven skies open
Fear no man's my slogan, I hope why'all believe
I'm just like you, fear nuttin human that bleeds
My mind breed two movies, six ab-lums, a hundred poems
Thirty R&B joints, I'm beyond the norm, why'all just mad
I'm just glad, got my time to shine
why'all the type to hit three hundred bars and run out of rhymes

Gets back abrasions from cap grazin, defy gravitation
Pull my shit back squeeze bust it like masturbation
Hold fort, hold the blow torch, leave your soul scorched

When the gun blows...and the shots fall...and the smoke clear... 
Man I be hearin' you murder (you ain't here!) 
Nobody hit up in the cross 'cause I'm observin' (you ain't here!)

Flipped a bird outta flip a bird switch up my plates

Takin it to some motherfuckers domes

And we gettin' stronger hope you got a vest
Already got them macs, already got them techs
Served a few dimes, Beans got pearls

It's not a game I'm from Philly
Go by the name P, Prizzy Mac Milly
Used to with Young Crizzy in the back rolling on twigs
People want to know who run with me, nobody but the bang, bang

Streets will forgive me, street vocals searching the city, sing
Peddi, Peddi, I heard that they got your number
The alias you've been living under the mack goes thrriiing
Peddi, Peddi, I heard that they watch your mother

Got a hit on your brother, like motherfucker don't - blliinng
Crack, smack a tooth out your choppers
Any wrong move, I blast the tool up on you fuckers
Wait, that's just enough for you to follow

Heavyweight rap, I spit for much for you to swallow 
Blap, Blap, number one with a bullet
Play with them guns to the fullest
Your stupid ass get, clapped, bap

About my past and my future, you disrespect it, I'll shoot you
Treat it just like that...

First the mack go ring, and when it's done it go ting

There's still six million ways to D-I-E
I'll smack your P-why-T, with the bun and the nine, nigga
I live me rhymes, why'all ain't Free

But why'all know why'all heard of him
Niggaz can not serve him, not see him when he floatin' by, windows be dark tinted
Stop playing thinking you touch him, trouble you deep in it
Clock spitting, it's just the principle, my principality

Follow me home, better have a full tank, money for shoes
What you fools think, full bank money from shows
It's the Roc bitch, I'm on your block bitch
I'm in the cock-pit, you think it's a rose

So what if it's brown from Mac, gotta take it back, back
And gotta bobble the gat, push your shit back, back
Free, house the trap, push the release day back
Me and crack at it again, add it to wax

It's not a game I'm from Philly
Go by the name, Young Chris, or Young Gunner
Know my partner Young Neffi, we the youngest out the gang
Mami's spend a lot of meta, man I treat 'em all the same

Closest thing to my thang, is my thang, thang
Niggaz they act dumb act they think, thangs
Soon as the crackers come, they hit the bing, and sing
Niggaz on the street whisperin', Police District and

Tell them about the drops and when the Puerto Ricans did Shamear
The dough get 'em, about the flow switchin' em
Got the greatest listening, haters 4-5'n them
Blasin' not missin' 'em, LA missin' him

Muhammad thang got his momma thinking that it's cousin Chris and 'em
Though we in a better place, be here, he rather too
But our father, the number when he ready too
Do not bother the rumble, niggaz ready too, bang you in a second
Keep the banger for protection

Why'all ain't said a damn thang, with your thang thangs
Nigga, we can do the damn thang
The war ain't over 'til that fat bitch sang

Or the last bullet from my Mac blaang, mayne
My whole click goin' reign, the half a clip will melt ya
For shelter, don't get caught up in the drizzle
Hit you in the spittle, and then bring it back again

It ain't a thang to make your brains go hang, mayne

That can't leave and how the Chinks gotta feed'em
For the rest of their life fucking wings fried
Vegetable rice(gotta be kidding)

No breakfast Cap'n Crunch at night
Our kids eating lunch at night
In their beds all bunched in tight
No less than three or four(you know how it go)

Two by the foot two by the headboard
Man I'm getting scared for them (Yeah I know)
that's how I feel for them

Serving these nigga flippers, quarter-ounces and

Zippers agents snapping your picture neighbors
Plotting to get ya

Living it like a savage cause nigga I gotta have it

Straight from the oven with it, came from the dirt

You can blame my old earth, for the shit she instilled in me
Still with me, pain plus work
Shit she made me milk this game for all it's worth

Me and the Face Mob, every time we face-off

Don't got no wholesale, cause that ain't how I wanna run it
Here take these five stones and bring a nigga back a hundred
Gotta see my feet dude, you do shit a fiend do
The fire get too hot in the kitchen, I hit the streets fool
Money is an issue, and that's on the fa' shizzle my nizzle
Ya block warm, then I come by with the fizzle
And make fa' sho' I get to work mines, for part of the time
We go to war and you ain't making a dime (ha ha!)
Cause I got, shit to lose, a nigga out here payin his dues
My baby walking gotta get him some shoes
It's a new game doing, lemme give ya the rules
Get outta line and I'ma give ya the blues
It's a new game doing, lemme give ya the rules
Get outta line and I'ma give ya the blues, whoa!

Guess who's bizack?
The boy B. Mizack, a.k.a. Mr. Crack-A-Brick
Turn a whole one from a half a brick, look I mastered this
You can smell it once the plastic rips
A hot plate'll make ya swell up if ya gasket clicked
You can make ya chips swell up, ya don't have to pitch
Play them corners like a safety, watch the traffic switch
Young'n never pump fake, and you'll get past the blitz
And keep ya whole hood on flip, like on box-spring
Pissy Mack and shit, low old box of things
Strictly glassy shit, I hug the block like a quart of water
Shit I used to hug a corner like a old deuce and a quarter
Till like deuce in the morning, with the old heads
Slanging loose quarters, this Philly cat back gatted (had it)
Still fucking with them crack addicts
Still busting with that black-matic

Guess who's bizack?
Back on the block with the old Face Mob
Mack Mittens and Hov'
Don't make me relapse

Here we go!

God damn, guess who stepped up in the place?
The kid with two rubbers on his waist
Two steppin' to the base
And I don't usually step up in the place
I usually pull that lead out, ready to get a lead out
But damn, since I stepped up in the place
I'm try'na touch you, squeeze you, tell you what's the case
Before I bust, you squeeze, outta telly and a case of Cris'
I'm tryin' to take you to the telly, bust in ya ff'
Tryin' to lure me out on the dance floor
I'm tryin' to get it twirly on the dance floor
Everything remains the same, might spit-talk to it
Then ""Change The Game"", might Crip-Walk to it
But never Harlem shake it, Harlem make it, Harlem break it

Don't stop 'cause you know I can't get enough (come on)
Wanna taste it in the mornin' when I'm wakin' up (come on)
Like peach cobbler in my stomach when I eat it up (come on)
Got your legs around my neck so I can't get up
See, them boys 112, we from the A, A! (ATL)

Beanie Sigel,"Fuck, shit is real right here
Roc-a-Fella, LOX, takin the streets over motherfuckers
Don't get it twisted
Yo, aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo
Yo shut the fuck up 'fore I blast and Banned From TV your ass
With no mask, look at the camera like what?
Yeah I did it like them sick white boys the court committed
To the death of me, I'm spaz like I'm on Ecstasy
Drop 100 bars for real like I'm lookin for a deal
If I ain't hungry, who the fuck is, I'm worse than them African kids
I ain't straight til my numbers match the Motorola ?bid?
And walk the streets up in ? ? like I don't fuckin care
If I ain't strapped that means I took em off my Nike Airs
Get off mine, y'all talk shit like little children
When I ride mine like bitched when I walk up in the building
Cause I catch tans in the winter, with wild whores
Jet-skiin, while you keep warm at corner stores
I make it hot, floodin your block, the best way
Professionally, they'll find poison in your X-Ray
As I get roasted lookin at Biggie posted on my wall
Takin shots of Louie til I fall
Nuttin to lose, just load the clip up in the groove
And kick rhymes to the poster, til I swear Big move
My team, you would think was on Thorazine
How we floss and don't give a fuck what it's cost-ing

Yo, yo, pressure bust pipes, it's time to apply it now
Pick out a quiet town and tie it down
Make niggaz lock it down, y'all know where to buy it now
Beanie Mac I supply it now
My squad roll deep, in foreign cars with two seats
Couple of five's, a six, a few Jeeps
Bag enough coke to last a few weeks
In case niggaz wanna test, vest and a few heats
You really wanna test my name?  And test my game?
Until you have me, test my aim?
Y'all niggaz nuts, like testricles
Hit you up in your apartment buildin vestibule
Perhaps it's best for you, to keep on walkin
Heat from the noggin, keep on sparkin
Platinum prezzie, Bezzie, stay sparklin
Cop off the lot never see me at the auction
Pint of Bacardi darken, when it's hawkin
Out on the strip, until I reach the margin
Not tryin to meet the Seargeant, at the precinct
Eatin cheese sandwiches, down for the weekend
Locked up with dirty white boys and Ricans

Now if I kill you I probably do ten in the box
Come down on appeal then I'm killin your pops
You feelin The LOX, nigga why you grillin The LOX
If this rap shit don't work niggaz still in the spot
You bring it to me, I gotta lose your family
Gangstas don't die, they get chubby, and move to Miami
Shit is deep now dog but it gets deeper
Fuck it, the weather's nice and the price is much cheaper
I put it on tape, you gon' buy it, I put it in a bag
You gon' try it, y'all niggaz can't deny it
Lot of cats still tryin to study my last bounce
Tell you what, get a beat tape and a half ounce
They got me where I can't be without my large gat
Teflon long sleeve, and my hardhat
Don't matter if I'm openin up, or headline
Doin the speed limit or pushin red lines
Six months in the county or fed time
I'ma be the 'Kiss nigga, until it's bedtime
Anything I'm on is a classic, any nigga
Ever had beef with, son is a bastard
Anytime I spit, spit acid, L.O.X.
Ruffryder you heard?  We got the game mastered

I told you the pain was comin
You wouldn't listen
You tried to play me like a joke?
Now who got the last laugh?
Now take these bullets with you to hell

You motherfuckers is sick, don't think Sauce the shit
So many niggaz on my nuts I thought I lost my dick
Picture me fallin off, I'm camera shy
Hammers fly, might miss you, but your man'll die
What's the difference?  Either way I'm stunnin your crew
I fuck to win, y'all niggaz comin to lose
Somethin to prove?  Spit it, we can have a sprayoff
I lay off wet niggaz and kill em on my day off
Ain't nuttin for me to bust a trey off
Murder the whole month of April nigga, just to take May off
Run with more Germans than Adolf, you light crews
Now I concentrate on your camp, like Jews
Flow hot like a heatwave bitch
Whips fatter than them shits they beat slaves with
I'm a meal stackin nigga who pull quick, still packin
For you Phil Jackson niggaz on that Bull

I don't give a fuck who you are, so fuck who you are
I don't care about a pretty bitch, watch or a car
I don't care about your block and whoever you shot
I don't care about your album and whenever it drop
I don't care about your past if I did I woulda asked
I'm too busy lightin 'dro with a whole lotta hash
Far as this rap shit, I'm ten steps ahead of niggaz
Shootin backwards, just for practice
Ride or die nigga, hoppin in your casket
Bout to go to hell with you, blow the L with you
Tell the whole world I'm spittin let em know the shells hit you
I tell niggaz quick, suck dick and get a glock
My name ring bells like Sunday at twelve o'clock
I'm half past seven, bust six then eleven
You know me, slide my man my joint say reload me
I ruffryde and pop a fella for Roc-a-Fella
Jay (what the fuck) spendin mozzarella

I know pop you can't stand us cause you cock them hammers
Run in your crib, no prisoners, pop your grandma
Locked in the slammer?  Nope, popped up in Atlanta
Crossed up in a drop I popped up the antenna
Whoa, watch your manners when my veins pop like scanners
Like raindrops you hear the thunder when I cock the cannon
Big thang, big chains, ain't shit changed
Get brained in the four dot six Range
Shit main, switch lanes
Every town I hit, switch planes, bitch flipped big caine
Flow with no cut, you take it in vain/vein to the brain
Muh'fukas is noddin and throwin up, you know that
You don't wanna owe that man
He'll hit you, get the picture?  Kodak man
Gotta, love for war, I don't floss no more
I just sit on my money til I'm above the law
How the fuck you gonna stop us with your measly asses
We don't stop at the tolls we got EZ passes, nigga
Multiple cars and divas with D-classes
Iceberg sweat with I.B. on the elastic
Shit, beyotch!  What the fuck, ya heard me?
Put some more beat on that joint",Reservoir Dogs,2003
Beanie Sigel,"Man, if I get rocked, this shit for my kids, nigga
It's that real shit

Even though what we do is wrong

We still hustle 'til the sun come up
Crack a 40 when the sun go down
It's a cold winter, y'all niggaz better bundle up
An' I bet it be a hotter summer, grab a onion

Yes, the ROC gets down, you hot now, listen up
Don't you know cops' whole purpose is to lock us down?
An' throw away the key, but without this drug shit
Your kids ain't got no way to eat

We still try to keep Mom smilin'
'cause when the teeth stop showin'
An' the stomach start growlin', then the heat start flowin'
If you from the hood, I know you feel me, keep goin'

If a sneak start leanin' an' the heat stop workin'
Then my heat start workin', I'ma rob me a person
Catch a nigga sleepin' while he out in the open
An' I'ma get him, keep flowin'

We gotta raise our kids while we livin'
Make a million off a record, bail my niggaz outta prison
Fuck a Bentley or a Lexus, just my boys in the squadder
Nigga talk reckless, then I hit 'em with the Smif an'

But I'm never snitchin', I'm a rider
If my kids hungry, snatch the dishes out ya kitchen
I'll be wylin' til they pick me outta line up

We keep the nines tucked, chopped dimes up, rap about it
Wyle out, fuck niggaz up, laugh about it
I'm not tryin' to visit the morgue
But Freeway move out 'til I sit with the Lord

'Til I get my shit together, clean up my sins
Freeway got it in like 10 in the mornin'
An' I can get it to ya like 10 while you yawnin', man

Still deliver the order, man
An' I ain't talkin' 'bout chicken an' gravy, man
I'm talkin' 'bout bricks 'o ye yo, halves an' quarters
4 an' a halves of hash, you do the math

Swing past us, scoop up your daughter
She wanna roll wit' a thug that rap, you do the math
He won't blast 'til my stacks in order

Man, lemme get 'em Free
Hove never slackin', man, zippin' in the black Range
Faster than the red ghost, gettin' ghost wit' Pac, man
One time, know a got a knack to get that change
Leader of the black gang, ROC, man

Bang like T-Mac, ski mask, air it out
Gotta kill witnesses 'cause Free's beard's stickin' out
Y'all don't want no witness shit, we squeeze hammers, man
Bullets breeze by you, like Louisiana, man

But I gotta feed Tianna, man
So I move keys, you can call me the Piano Man
Rain, sleet, hail, snow, man
Slang dough, E, hydro, man

Know B. Sige in the third lane
Gramps still prayin', workin' on my nerves, man
Like, ""Son you gotta get your soul clean
Before they blow them horns like Coltrane""

But still I cry tears of a hustler
Wipe tears from my mother, pull out beers for her brothers
That's above us, make beds for the babies
Tuck kids under covers, buy cribs for their mothers

Shit, I'll probably be wylin' with their fathers
Tell Ms. Robert, tell Enijah that I'm ridin' for her father
That's like my brother, like same mother, different father
Any problems? Dog, know I got 'em

An' still we grind from the bottom
Just to make it to the bottom, sold crack in the alleyways
Still gave back Marcy 'A Dollar Day'
Real gangstas make hood holidays

They ain't thank us but we still paid homage, man
Soul Food Sunday, lookin' like Big Momma's, man
Tell the gang I never break my promise, man, man

Even though what we do is wrong
Even though what we do is wrong

Roll a ""L"" and burn a incent
It's like magic when I invent
This shit that I present
Yo turn my levels up a izinch
And drop the trebble down the pizinch
And let the bass commence
To relax your nerves
It's like a paintin with no color it's-why I attach the words
My mind the brush, my life the canvas, the world, the easel
Combines a perfect picture for people
My words is colorful like autumn
The way they fall on the track like leaves when I record em'
There's nothin like it when I write
And I don't print, I invent it and predict it like a psychic
Pull down the shades on the windows of your soul
And gaze into your mind and watch the wisdom unfold
I was taught when your vision's impaired
The wisdom is there
A message from Big Homey couldn't-have sent it no clear
I know the flow is like hypnotic
And tightest tip when I drop it with no particular topic
Type shit that can't be bitten so stop it
Type shit that can't be re-written on copy
By kinko, kodak, fuji films
Kin-folk know that groovy hymns
Spit by him'll put the gospel to you
Catch some little higher learning from a sermon once I drop it to you
Hypnotic...hypnotic...
My flow is like hypnotic...
The flow is like hypnotic...
My flow is like hypnotic...

So roll a ""L"" and light a incent
It's like magic when I event
This shit that I present
It's not a secret when I speak it
I know that hatin' isn't physical but dawg I could peep it
It's like a preacher preachin' his scripts or psychic readin' a palm
Lines give me what I write in-this song
The book is now open so let the story be told
I enter through your mind and exit the back of your soul
That could push you to some insight
A shine like a headlight
Pickeny diamond watch me get right
I'm that nice
Words is a cure that help me heal up a heart
Words can become that evil game that help me get what I want..uh
You start where you end, you end where you start
I am the light of the situation I overshine dark
Give you the pen, the book, the word, the truth, the sight, the mind
I put it down, you call it a rhyme, I call it a sign
I predict the unpredictable
Heaven is invisible, but hell isn't physical
Let me stop with the spiritual.. whoa
Let me spit at you, show you how to move with no vehicle
Come through your speakers
Into/enter your ear, end up in paragraphs
Tellin' your man of what you hear
'cause, spit it I often roll it tighter than chronic
Styles versatile meanwhile it's hypnotic
Hypnotic...hypnotic...
My style is just hypnotic...
My style is just hypnotic...
My style is just hypnotic...
(Jay-Z)
Pass the dutchie if you was ill
Take one to the grizzill
Tell me what you fizzill
It's like a complicated puzzle unravelin', mind travelin', with no particular flight patterin
Speak the language of the lizand
Desert feeds worm, worm feeds falcon, falcon feeds man ..uh
Only the strong survive, so if you along for the ride strap your boots and leave your thongs inside..uh
We experience turbulence in urban environments daily, rarely it's aqcuired
We riot like Israelis
Why am I here that question overwhelms me
I am a gangsta, Dr. Melfi couldn't help me
I am a thinker, my mind fixes all that L's/ills me the perfect elixir
I trust mines will never fail me
I let my speech unfold, I reach deep inside the seed of my soul and I got it
Hypnotic...hypnotic....
My style is just hypnotic...
My style is just hypnotic...
My style is just hypnotic...
My style is just hypnotic...
My style.. hypnotic..

Beanie Sigel,"Ooh
It's that real street shit
[Incomprehensible] they're ready for this one, nigga
Ooh shit ohh

I came up with my man, same hood, same age
Withheld names to protect the guilty and
Your boy, Free was filthy, same clothes, different day
Be the first to admit it, while niggaz claim to be willies, hey

We cleaned up the first Donny I drove
We cooled up the first tommy I seen, follow the flow
Smoke a timmy, with this semi, made his chimney move
Nerves made his body shake, everybody froze

So young with a pump and a mac
But still manage to make it the magic, the bad kids
On the block, with a bundle of crack, package of pills
All heads will try to teach us to rhyme

He said, ?Muhammed walk with a sword?, I roll with a gat
This the same shit, different day, from times
Now my man Book ain't writing me back
So I figured, try to reach 'em with rhymes, no listen to Mac

We thuggin' for life gonna take it
And then enough ain't no mistakin'
But it's for life, it's my life
Not for the taking

To all my boys in the hood, the East Coast throw boy back
From the land of them throw boys black
I keep my toast in the hood, gon' squeeze
Hope you throw yours back come to the streets
To bring my homeboys back

Blew my mind out this piece, but I'm always back
I got sheet in my air, like mac, fall away back
Shit, I'm trynna come way up
And make the path so freak, I tear the runaway up

My life a bitch with a period on
But still I keep it real, dog, I'm hittin' it raw
And I don't know how to carry this bitch
Sometime I wanna marry this bitch

Sometimes I feel like quitting this whore
But I can't 'cause it feel like, giving it all
I've been on so fucking much, feel like my living was all
But in my lifetime, I'm a deliver regrets
Still with the evils, know that one day I'ma sit with the boss

We thuggin' for life gonna take it
And then enough ain't no mistakin'
But it's for life, it's my life
Not for the taking

It's not even close, we throw toast, sleep with ya gats
It's the worst of both hoods, holla at 'em Mac
Follow up exact with the Mac, and the V
Get back, if you happen to see, the Mac or Free, at where you be

I be where you at, I come where you live
The cat untuckle the gat, maneuver the thing
The Mac untuckin' a pump, removin' they wig, with ease
Hear the feds trynna ruin the boss Sieg'

'Fore they kill me like Cornbread, you be like Dial Lo
Before I'm stuck like Luima, I be up when you need it
And I'ma ride for you, lace up my sneakers, puffin' my reefer
Tuckin' my heater, duckin' your rounder

Tell 'em tricks they gonna die when I see 'em
Let 'em know my friend colt 45 trynna meet with they mind
But we keep drama, think, rhyme is the reason
And Freeway the reason that you tied up in pajamas

We thuggin' for life gonna take it
And then enough ain't no mistakin'
But it's for life, it's my life
Not for the taking

[Freeway]
Man if I get rocked, this shit for my kids nigga
It's that real shit...
[female singer, repeated throughout the verses]

Even though what we do is wrong...
We still hustle 'til the sun come up
Crack a 40 when the sun go down
It's a cold winter

Y'all niggaz better bundle up
And I bet it be a hotter summer, grab a onion
Yes the ROC gets down, you hot now, listen up
Don't you know cops' whole purpose is to lock us down?

And throw away the key
But without this drug shit your kids ain't got no way to eat, huh?
We still try to keep Mom...smilin'...
'Cause when the teeth stop showin' and the stomach start growlin'

Then the heat start flowin'
If you from the hood I know you feel me ([Jay-Z:] Keep goin'...)
If a sneak start leanin' and the heat stop workin'
Then my heat start workin' I'm-a rob me a person

Catch a nigga sleepin' while he out in the open...and I'm-a get him ([Jay-Z:] Keep flowin'...)
We gotta raise our kids while we livin'
Make a million off-a record bail my niggaz outta prison
Fuck a Bentley or a Lexus just my boys in the squadder

Nigga talk reckless then I hit 'em with the Smif 'n...
But I'm never snitchin' I'm a rider
If my kids hungry snatch the dishes out ya kitchen
I'll be wylin' til they pick me outta line-up...

We keep the nines tucked, chopped dimes up, rap about it
Wyle out, fuck niggaz up, laugh about it
I'm not tryin' to visit the morgue but Freeway move out 'til I sit with the Lord
'Til I...get my shit together, clean up my sins

Freeway got it in like 10 in the mornin'
And I can get it to ya like 10 while you yawnin' mang...
Still deliver the order mang!
And I ain't talkin' bout chicken and gravy mang!

I'm talkin' bout bricks 'o ye-yo, halves and quarters
4 and a halves of hash you do the math
Swing past us scoop up your daughter
She want to roll wit' a thug that rap, you do the math
He won't blast 'til my stacks in order mang!

[Jay-Z]
... Mang! Lemme get 'em Free
Hove never slackin' mang, zippin' in the black Range
Faster than the red ghost, gettin' ghost wit' Pac-Mang
One-time know a got a knack to get that change

Leader of the black gang, are-O-see mang
Bang like T-Mac, ski mask air it out
Gotta kill witnesses 'cause Free's beard's stickin' out
Y'all don't want no witness shit, we squeeze hammers mang

Bullets breeze by you, like Lousiana mang...
But I gotta feed Tianna mang...
So I move keys you can call me the Piano Man
Rain...sleet, hail...snow man

Slang dough, E, hydro man...

[Beanie Sigel]
...no, B. Sige in the third lane
Gramps still prayin' workin on my nerves man...
Like, ""Son you gotta get your soul clean...
Before they blow them horns like Coltrane...""

But still I cry tears of a hustler
Wipe tears from my mother, pull out beers for her brothers...
That's above us, make beds for the babies
Tuck kids under covers, buy cribs for their mothers

Shit I'll probably be wylin' with their fathers
Tell Ms. Robert, tell Enijah that I'm ridin' for her father
That's like my brother, like same mother different father
Any problems dog know I got 'em

And still we grind from the bottom
Just to make it to the bottom sold crack in the alleyways
Still gave back Marcy a Dollar Day
Real gangstas make hood holidays

They ain't thank us but we still paid homage mang
Soul Food Sunday lookin' like Big Momma's mang
Tell the gang I never break my promise mang... mang... unnh!",What We Do...,2003

Now fair warning, sure shots won't graze ya
We hug corners, play blocks like Gators
With bundles on us, serve tre's like waiters
It's the life we chose to hustle
Can't stop it, can't knock it
Half the profit get flown out Vegas
Me and my niggaz try an' break tables
Stack chips like Connect Four
While you prick's try and whip try and stretch more
Charge less for, that ain't the program
Get ya lessons from the snow man
Like Pillsbury I get the doe man
I'll off ya head for a slice of bread
I keep my word and I'm true to my peeps
Give me a bird and my crew gon' eat
I'm over the stove like +Cuban Links+

'Round the world niggaz pay me dues
While you niggaz sing the same old song like Sadies do

Without a rhyme about the nine and what the Tech do
The four pound line, a thirty eight special
With AK shells through your Teflon vest too

Yeah, Scrap, when the Bastard's back out
The pastor's back out, the casket's passed out
It's shit bags and them Catholic's passed out
Shoot up the crack house, smack worker's bond like crack's out

Go to war, Mack never backed out
The mac's get backed out, the air's get dust off
The cage get bust off, the shaft and the stock get cut off
Your cash and your block get cut off

And the SWAT and the ambulance rush off
My hand on my nuts like fuck y'all
My SP Jeans drift, layin' on them dot grim shits
I'm out to buck you like and one, just run when the van come

Dis the Grammy's, on the panel
Change the channel, good smell flannel
You think shit is dandy, well, fuck your candy
Forty foot glock, shoot with handy

I fucked Amanda, you talk propaganda
Only gettin' money, on the Maranda
I stay candid, government branded
Heavy handed, woman demanding

Run up on twenty-six and seven, coke peli'
Open up and them in deli, spray whoever the sweaty

That's why I sip that purple pill
That make choke up your seven
Back the ac' as if you don't notice
Make me call that boy Mack, Bean Sig' flip you over

Respect mine, them tech nine's ain't my thing
I defeat the purpose of death lyin' with one ring

Once again, 'gain, 'gain 
Yo, adrenaline 

Yo, I'm in the eye of the storm where the pressure's on 
And MC's are dressed funny like a leprechaun 
I chop rappers like chicken suizceiun 
Send a squad off like a slave auction 
Yo my zodiac sign read caution 
On stage, I'll make your seed to an orphan 
Yo, my agent have to break equation 
Niggas want some? I hit 'em with a portion 
Son of fifth foursome, armed at the door, son 
In milita, Dice Raw quick draw, son 
You don't want no more son? That's when more come 
And drag a nigga Eerie avenue to Oregon, you're all done 
Ladies and Gentlemen, select a weapon at the gate 
Upon enterting The Roots' instruemtalin' 
Spark shit, them niggas try to talk shit 
We hit 'em like The L on 60th and Market 
South Philly click will hold it til a nigga park it 
Take sneaks, chains and rings and braclets 
Split back, just like we the therapist 
Adrenaline, fifth mic terrorist 
Once again

Nigga, nigga, niggas tryin' to get a grip 
Bu still slip, so lift me up 
Ever since I was a pup I was designed to erupt 
You get to know me, you'll poke me slowly 
When caught fussin' 
Some niggas thought they was, when of course they wasn't 
Punked 'em with the dozen 
The pellets all in they skellet 
Transform from the norm, start the brainstorm 
Yeah, Malik be	 from The Roots, he ain't gone 
I took the wrong exit, the sings to lay on 
I'm trapped up in about five worlds with live pearls 
Shouts to armour and ??? whose name Jahlil 
The moat is deep water so let your hand expand in 
Demandin', taking you back like Knots Landing 
And Ralph Cramden, we out, you'll see in Hampton 
Yo, what what what what what what the...? 
I get wicked on this concrete earth until I rot 
Didn't figure how to conquer it yet 
But still I rock once again

Beans passed the mac and we held 'em, like hostages 
Rappers see me hide they face, like ostriches 
Dice'll grind your brain into little sausages 
Under water rap, you know who the bosses is 
North Philly, baby, that's where that raw shit is 
You get blown out the sky once you get talkin' it 
Hey, take the vibe raw, I fathered it 
And when you see me on the street don't bother kid 
Just be on your merry way or you might get slit 
Ask around, wonderin' what Dice Raw did 
Lay you on floors like you gettin' carpeted 
You need a special kind of mic, for retarded kids 
Me against you's like Kang vs. The Partridges 
Want to battle? change your name to the forfeiters 
Cause that's what you do, faced to face with raw niggas 
I give you a bad case of the fucked-up jitters 
Once again

They used to talk shit, but I'm a quiet 'em 
Kick in the door with my boys, stick to fryin' 'em 
First nigga that flinch, I'm a fire him 
Tape him up, grip his hands, and plyer them 
Know the bricks is in here, where you hidin' 'em? 
Don't die in the shit that you lyin' in 
Used to get fronted bricks, now I'm buyin' 'em 
Used to cop off my man, now I'm supplyin' him 
Paid a front row seats, watchin' Iverson 
First class air crash when I'm flyin' in 
To L.A., Shaq, Eddie, Kobe Bryant and them 
Save the jokes for Chris Tucker, Richard Pryor and them 
Used to shotgun in cars that I'm drivin' 'em 
Used to hustle 'round bars, y'all was robbin' 'em 
Run all up in yo' spot with Rob and 'em 
Grew up, two-four, with Pry and 'em 
But do my dirt, twenty first, with Kyle and them 
Nigga Pop, nigga Buzz, little Mark and them 
Brother knews, nigga schooled Marly Park and them 
Nigga jump, pull a pump, low sparkin' 'em 
I know shit right now gettin' dark to them 
Tore their body all up, ain't no chalkin' 'em 
To sharp for them, move out in the dark on 'em 
These Illadel' foul streets when I'm stompin' 'em

Wit a confident swagger, international
Game so tight the girls had to go
And you don't stop!

Sicker than your average
Money too long, can't stash it
In the closet or the mattress
Paper, stretch like elastic
Checks from advances, the bank can't cash it
So the price for that, never ask it
Just sign my name or pop plastic
Hating ass cops want to harass 'em
Searching for a glock in the pocket of his fashion
Bitches wit SP stitches on they asses
And they left breast (Yes!)
Let's get dressed and toast to the occasion
Cops couldn't page 'em, flow so amazing, hot like Cajun

Three quarter croc, sharper than a pastor be
Sig bring the light to the masses
Of these rap bastards, who gives street passes
One shooting can lead to three caskets
Jump suits, state boots, at least three stabbings
You softer than a Reebok Classic
Folding under pressure when confronted by them badges
I was taught stay low and keep blasting
Po only know questions that was answered
Keep a number on the high price lawyer
It's five ways now days, everybody saw ya

When I kick in the door, stop the blood clot crying
Wipe the piss off the floor

When they see these thug, in a circle, snort the 50s up
Range Rov, 24 inch, blacked out bulbs
Blows fast, but hit your ho slow with the soul pole
Creeping on niggas trying to test me in the black drop top
Pull up and let the booper go bop, bop-bop
Treat you, in the wind, to my borough, blowin on my back
And do the same to any nigga that's tryna take what I got
I Can't Have It!

Devotion, friendship, loyalty
Karma, team, us, ROC
Solid, the evils, damn

With no union, and no benefits no dental plans
I can't eat off no hundred grand
I got cavities dat need fillin'
You can't feed a nigga Peanut Chews
Now put ya feet up in a nigga' shoes
A lack of green'll give a nigga blues
A sip of purple make a nigga rue
Make a drunk person speak a sober tune (I can't go on this way)
Fuck dat, I can't do it man
We make these tips off this gift that we cursed wit
But then my mind drift, am I defeatin' the purpose?
'Cause you feel like shit when you miss your son's first shit
But who gon' pay the bills? Supply the meals? No surplus
My baby mama give me drama on the daily
Like she making it barely and my kids is eating rarely (I can't go on this way)
I'm stressed out goin' through it I can't do it
If you put puppies in the oven, do that make 'em biscuits?
Put hungry dogs in the kitchen, will they eat the kittens?
Do you hear me, are you listening? It's a big difference
Do you catch the lines or the hooks or are you still fishin'?
These a couple questions that I need to be answered
Like is these Backwoods and weed givin' me cancer (I can't go on this way)
I'm stressed out goin' through it I can't do it
My momma say I got a nerve stress
Got her waking up in cold sweats
I'm hard-headed and iron
What make it worse my lil brother behind me
Blood pressure running like Harriet
She can't handle it
I got her screaming Lord Jesus like Mahalia
Son I'm tellin' ya please don't let me bury ya (I can't go on this way)
I'm stressed man, I'm goin' through it
I was taught trust in the Lord but still tie up your camel
Use your tongue as your sword and your books as your ammo
But when them bullets start flying and you got pussies around you
And who you rely on, got them niggas surround you? Shit
And make me feel like young Tinner, from the start I was finished
How a nigga start wit a finish and begin wit a endin' (I can't go on this way)
I'm stressed out, I can't take it no more
I'm moving ass backwards with no forward progress
Feel asthmatic like treadmill keep jogging
Stagnant, running in place is tragic
My heart in the faith I don't practice
I still pray Allah, forgive me for my actions
'Cause I spit gangsta, think Muslim, and act Kaffir (I can't go on this way)
I gotta still feel feed my youngin's, so keep huggin

I can't wait until the rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life
Stuck in one time, Free patrol the block
Get avoided by the government avoid the spot
Can't wait 'til rain turn to sunshine
'Cause I hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life
Stuck in the box (I can't go on this way)

Straight from the ghetto
The ghetto I'm from the youngest be the ghettoest ones
Tryna make just as much as we could
Tryna make it but they gon make it hard as much as they could
That's why, that's why I hate 'em man
Them crackers ain't nothing without paper
They look at us it's nothing and uh (I can't go on this way)
Came too far and I ain't going backwardds for nothing
I ain't being distracted by nothing
Midget-size to Dikembe, I ain't backed up from nothing
Ma I'm still stressing
It ain't the kid it's the bills stressing, she hold it down on her own
She hold me down at the crib, hold me down while I'm gone
She held me down as a kid, hold me down while I'm grown (I can't go on this way)
I choose not, refuse not, down on my own
Now off the streets, runnin' wit the hottest label in the industry
The hottest label got a nigga lot of enemies
So now when I go in baseline
A nice-size ratchet to throw in wasteline
I gotta make mine
My bills ain't getting paid in, kids ain't situated (I can't go on this way)
Y'all better make a decision before us
'Cause the way that we living ain't all good
Ran away wit them hating ass niggas don't like us
Despite them, we gon' do it regardless
But all this commotion they causing, I ain't with it
(We ain't with it)
They can get it all it take is a call 'em

The one that never snitched
Taught you how to bust a fifth, shit

Taught you how to suck a dick
Taught you how to fluff a brick
But you got more drama than a be, mama
Got me goin through the motions like C. Thomas
With the bullshit, he say she say
The bitch is mad cause my jams kick like Eastbay

We had it together
You had it whenever

See that's when all the bullshit started
That's what three me in reverse, counter-clockwise

Ran into a dead end

My heart racin like a blunt lacin
Hennessy and malt liquor chasin
My gemstar scarrin niggaz faces
For a pound of trey eight and..
I throw bullets like Dallas Troy Aikman
The callous on my index stay achin
Niggaz stay hatin
Got me late night pacin
I'm tight boot lacin
Mask on like I'm Jason
Shoot up shit like Larry Davis
You play the pulpit like Pastor Mason
Turn cheek like Martin Luther
I'm like Oswald sharp-shootin
Got my eyes on my mark in the dark shootin
Beam illuminate the target movin
Get your organs ruined
Move out like SWAT move in
Got them niggaz on the back-block rootin
For the bad guy..
Playground legend like Sadait(?)
P. Kirkland...My MP state workin
Shootin-arm stay jerkin
My Nextel stay chripin
Can't answer cause the feds lurkin
Its like we catchin cancer on purpose
Back to back chain smoking, nicotine feinin
Conversation with demons when I'm dreamin
Manic-depressive
Like the man upstairs tryin to pass me a lesson
But I can't catch it
The game under break the pressure
They miss my presence

[Chorus 2X: Sparks]
We still not promised tomorrow
Takin the bitter with the sweet up in these cold ass streets
We got lifestyles through our scars
We ride hard til our numbers get called
The lifestyle of a hustler...

[Sparks]
I'm feelin like deaths in the air
Got me back to back buckin my squares
But I ain't bitchin I ain't scared
I ain't budgin, in fact the thrill alone turns me on
Got me smiling, laughin...Clutchin
My toast and confrontin mother fuckers
Cock-a-roaches will not catch me laughin
Skinny and slim fram why'all get it the same
Cool niggaz that'll spin out they waves
Grimey niggaz that'll spin to they graves
Justifyin my foul ways
I got kids to raise
But motherfuckers rather see me sprayed
Than to see me pair (fucker)
Or see me on the front page like Sig
Or stay rolled DC with B. Sig
You bitch niggaz stay PC when why'all see me
Until the day that they
Fit me in the grave and the city wreak of me
We got the city under siege
S-P or are-O-see
Poverty is a movie starrin me
Ride with no play the passenger seat
So why'all can see how my life so real
So why'all can see how my life so ill
(I came to chill..)

[Chorus]
[Oschino]
Tales of a hustler that's me in the flesh
Got a Jag and a Caddy sellin dimes of the step
Niggaz want to take my block I had to earn my respect
So I put his cerebellum on his grandma's steps
You know Oschino he'll probly kill
Got the soul of Huey Newton nigga Bobby Seale
Nigga prolly take the stand he'll prolly squeal
But I got four lawyers I ain't takin the deal (Nigga)
We could strap without scrap or put the semi in it
Gun fully loaded like the Chrysler with the hemmy in it
I keep it ghetto like a 40 with the Henny in it
Went to school broke loafers on no pennies in it
Stood the coldest winter with the bummiest coat
Need food need shoes sold dummies of soap
Got tired of bein broke man life was a bitch
They bring you flowers when you head but no soup while you sick
So I switched my whole picture get involved with the bricks
Not the ones made of semen but the ones who sniffs
Tales of hustler, niggaz come for your jugular
If you sell one bag to they mother fuckin customers
State P we got the city on smash
Got every boulevard every street every ave
Got sneakers got clothes nigga you do the math
Push to hustle but the point is just to stack that cash

I know it when niggaz fake it - I live this shit
You can front it all you want but when yo ass gets hot
Then you can rest assured nigga - yo ass gets got
I'm sayin that to say this - I can plot those hits
I'm connected in every city on capo shit
I ain't even gotta say these niggaz know my ties

Sometimes they Crip niggaz, other times Piru

But then I'd take 'em right back to see Martin Luther's dream
I'd dream that I could tell Martin Luther we made it
But half of my black brothers are still incarcerated
Locked up in a cell block, lost from the shell shock
Some sold they soul, others used to sell rocks
Look up in my mailbox, I get letters from my cause
and every week said he wanna hit the streets
But he never struck a deal cause his mouth will never squeal
Put some money on his books and help him out with his appeal
Send some pictures of the fam and nasty pics of Shawnna

Beanie Sigel,"I was sitting back, and I was thinking man
I ain't even trying to deal with this shit no more, you know
Cham' I don't know what to do yo, ya know
Seem like everytime a nigga make one step man
Nigga take two steps back, you feel me

They told me that pain was just in the frame, the irony of that
Cause that was the slogan showing, when they tried to see my tats
Never knew what was in the skin, would finally be a fact
Feeling like mother nature's, right behind me with a gat
Take that, the rain's loud on the window when it taps
To hell with the time, I thought that I could finally be relaxed
Tired of being po', yeah trying to leave the rats
Walk out to see three of your tires, that be on flat
And that one tire, left a sign of hope
That helps you to keep on grinding, when you kinda broke
That helps you to keep composure, up around your folk
That keeps from trying to wrap a rope, around your throat
Don't choke, you feeling like giving up
Life isn't a million bucks, you feeling like living sucks
God's telling you hear your boy, but you don't wanna give him trust
Mama telling you pay your tithes, and you yell at her back, ""for what""
So the pastor can ride faster, to get some rims on his truck
I don't think that they'll miss, ten percent of negative bucks
Put some Henny up in your cup, your problems will start to drown
But soon as your buzz leaves, then problems come back around damn

Keep your head up is what they telling me
, well it betta be
Sorry but the world keeps stressing me
Rain drops cloudin up the memories
It's gonna be alright is what they telling me
Don't let the stress get the best of me
Trying to focus on the road that's ahead of me
Till my brain gets cloudy bout a memory

God knows, how I feel now
On the outside I'm smiling, but inside a nigga know he hell bound
It's a dark road, and I'm right here in the middle of it
Do I walk slow or if I run, am I'm missing some'ing
I took the time out, to save a little bread
Now my eyes, got water in em
Why the fuck am I still standing here, nobody love me I ain't happy here
My mama said, she can't handle him
But still, I'm looking at the bright side
But I view it through my other eye, cause it's a different color sky
Then the last one, my mind set on the prize that may never come
So do I try to stay alive, or do I grab a gun
End it all, put a stop to the pain
That goes on in my head, everytime it rains
But that was speaking, so you listening to the thoughts
Of an evil spirit, in demonic verses everytime I talk
I'm confused, by my psychological set backs
In the storm, washin out through the wet cracks
Looking for heaven, off in all the wrong places
I've given up so why the long faces? Let it rain

Your bills keep adding up, to be alone you prefer
Bill collectors steady calling, starting to get on your nerves
Your rent due on the first, but right now it's the third
Telling yourself it's gon get better, but ain't believing a word
Feel like it's hard to deal, tomorrow it's hard as steel
Not to mention the realest member, of your family is getting ill
Tell me it isn't so, tell me it isn't real
In the mist of all the drama, you take a lil' time to kneel
To deal you take a pill, just to deal with the drama
You thinking your life sinking, and there isn't a plumber
They tell you what doesn't kill you, only makes you stronger
You'd have to be a Superman, to live as much as me partna
you're trying, but help is just what you dialing
Cause the room is a monsoon, that's never gon get to drying
The storm is moving on, and you thinking these people lying
They saying they had it worse, but how come they all keep on smiling

Don't let stress take control, gonna be alright I know
I'ma make it through fa sho, fa sho yeah - 2x

My memry, heeeey-heeey yeah
Stressing me-stressing me, my memories
That's what they telling me
I'm trying to focus on the road that's ahead of me
By my memories, yeah heeey yeeeah

Beanie Sigel,"I know I shouldn't have did that
I know it's going to come right back
I know it's going to destroy everything I made
It's probably going to get your boy sent away
But this game I play, ain't no way to fix it
It's inevitable that I'm (fallin')

Said where I would stop before I even started
When I get to one brick then the game I would depart with
Got to one brick then I looked to the sky like
""Sorry God I lied but give me one more try""
Got the two bricks new cars, new whips
But niggas never learn until they end up in the news clip
The irony of selling drugs is sort of like you using it
Guess it's two sides to what substance abuse is
Can't stop, won't stop, addicted to this new shit
Brand new convertibles, I'm so ruthless
Front row fight night, see how big my tube is
Fuck HD, nigga, see how clear my view is?
(Fallin') But there's a price for overdoing it
Doing it this big will put you on the map
Stick-up kids is out to tax
Plus the FBI boys with the cameras in the back
Damn

I know I shouldn't have did that
I know it's going to come right back
I know it's going to destroy everything I made
It's probably going to get your boy sent away
But this game I play, ain't no way to fix it
It's inevitable that I'm (fallin')

Now you (fallin'), when you should've fell back
Now you (fallin'), right into they lap
Fallin', they applauding, they screaming at the screen
Damn you fucked up like your favorite movie scene
Godfather, Goodfellas, Scarface, Casino
You seen what that last run did to DeNiro
And he can't beat the odds, can't cheat the Gods
Can't blow too hard, life's a deck of cards
Now your tumbling is humbling, you're fallin', you're mumbling
Under your breath like you knew this day was coming
(Fallin') Now let's pray that arm candy
That you left your ex for stay down and come in handy
Cause come January it gets cold, when the letters start to slow
And your commissary's low, and lawyers screams appeal
Only thinking about a bill and your chances are nil
Damn, gravity's ill

I know I shouldn't have did that
I know it's going to come right back
I know it's going to destroy everything I made
It's probably going to get your boy sent away
But this game I play, ain't no way to fix it
It's inevitable that I'm (fallin')

(Fallin') And you can't get up
All you do is push-up, pull-up, sit-up
Locked down the town now belongs to the squares
Who said they won't make the same mistake that got you there
And your arm candy sweet on them
And the women that you left for this heffer
Got a college degree coming
Bad news keeps coming, hard to keep something on your stomach
You're sick about what your life is becoming
(Fallin') But your use-to's, has-beens
Ragging bad about all the new dudes
Talking tough on the Youtube
About what you used to do
But that's old school to the new crew
They doing numbers like Sudoku
They're the new you, and it's damn near inevitable
They'll experience deja vu too
Fight and you'll never survive
Run and you'll never escape
So just fall from grace, damn

I know I shouldn't have did that
I know it's going to come right back
I know it's going to destroy everything I made
It's probably going to get your boy sent away

It's inevitable that I'm (fallin')",Fallin',2007

Never fronted on my boys for no whore
I ain't never been no bitch, nor never lied on my dick
Y'all niggaz still dyin' for these whores
I ain't never been no snitch, never been no rat
Never shot a nigga in his back
I always put the drama to his face
I ain't never pull my strap and ain't clap
Got my case, did my time, now I'm BACK~!

Still back it up whenever I talk shit
Man I'm worth about a billion but I'm still hood rich
Still hoppin' out the whip with a hot-ass chick
Still rockin' the chain, they still knowin' my name
It's Kels, that's right bitch, I'm still in the game
Still walk through the hood like I'm holdin' that thang
Still limp through the club like I'm holdin' that cane
It's two fingers for a rock star, middle for a bitch
Come in by self and leave out wit'cha chick

Shorty had six bags, strugglin' and still coppin'
Cute face, slim waist, body proper
Hair fell short to her shoulders, I had to stop her

I had to add that to the roster
And me leavin' without that there was not a option
Excuse me miss, please take no offense
But I'm shoppin' for a lady friend about your size

I saw somethin' that could be a 4, if you could try that on
Shit, I could peep the fit before I buy it for her
She smiled and tried it on with no problem
Stepped out lookin' like the next top model

Damn, I told the salesclerk to give me two
And told ma for all your work, this one's for you
You keep it, that'll be our little secret
Now peep it, to make this long story shorter
I ain't get shorty name 'til the next mornin'

Once she grin, I'm in, game begin
Once she grin, I'm in, game begin
Once she grin, I'm in, game begin

Man, you know that chick that time
I said I had to stick that time
I fucked the bitch about six times
Now she on my phone every hour

Cussin' out her man, talkin' 'bout he a coward
Bitch please, she said that I'm all that she need
Indeed, I showed her that I was built for speed
I'm heavy, I'm somethin' like a '55 Chevy

And now I'll make my class no more, I'm quite sure
I'm somethin' she never had before, I'm that boy
'Cause once they grin, I'm in, game begin
Y'all dudes spit that same lame to them

Please, you niggaz ain't nothin' like Sig'
Man, I run through these chickens like fresh white tees
Keep 'em in check like fresh Nikes
And once again when they grin, I run 'em in

Once they grin, I'm in, game begin
Once they grin, I'm in, game begin
Soon as he buy that wine I just creep up from behind
Once they grin, I'm in, game begin

I'm the master, I'm somethin' like a pussy connoisseur
Faggot, you somethin' like a pussy kind of whore
Chit-chattin' at bitches, yip-yappin' with niggaz
About this and that, how your chips be stacked

I keep a bitch on her back, put her face in the pillow
You give a bitch all your trap, keep your face in the middle
Of her puss, while her mouth full of cupids
You useless, I abuse 'em then I lose 'em

I'm ruthless but nothin' like Eazy
I keep a pocket full of Magnums, believe me
I keep these whores chasin'

Short money, long conversation, they gets nothin'
You know the rules, a whore gets none
Hard dick and bubblegum
And I just chewed my last stick is where I'm comin' from

Once they grin, I'm in, game begin
Once they grin, I'm in, game begin
Soon as he buy that wine I just creep up from behind
Once they grin, I'm in, game begin",I'm In,2007

Call me Iceberg baby, Pimpin' Ken on a stroll
Got the right one baby, wouldn't give you a cold
No, but I could give you the coat
Pimps up, hoes down, bank roll all froze

Now let that thing bounce, drop slow
And show out your outsides, you know how it go, oh

Pull out my gat, she though I was goin' shoot her
Mr. P Crakk Cocaine, I got rulers
My mind in the gutter, and my heart in the sewer
I kick a bitch to the curb, I keep it movin'
Married to the game, I love my money and my music
Half Puerto Rican and black, they think I'm Jewish
I don't give em shit, and they keep comin' back to it

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Now come and sit yo big ass down
Right here on daddy legs, now hush, take a sip of the brown
Lap dance on it, leave a white stain on my Levis
This the twat team, I'm a show you how we ride
Through a lasso over your hips, rustle your mean thighs
You bow-legged too? I'm a hit it from all sides
Uh huh, we brought the bar, you bought the bar
Beans got the big lighter out, waiting to spark
Word up, dance floors, noise, asses shaking
And she winding that body like she got Jamaican
Asians, sistas, blacks, bad Caucasians
Get em all Goosed up, then I persuade them
To bounce to the c-r-i-b
Shorty to young, sorry, gotta chill in the lobby
It's the penthouse, big couch, get digged out
You bring your lil' male friends, I get kicked out

We the best

All the bullshit stops here, let's get this clear
Shoot rear fresh off the top tier
What I'm about to do for you is not fair
I'm not answering questions for you that are not clear

What up to State Prop the crew, were they not there?
The moment that they heard it the verdict
When it was declared, ya boy had to sit a year
Did they really disappear, did Jay really not visit there?

Dame and Bean's are they tight as it seems
Or is it all fabricated from that same fabric
That ripped the Roc marriage straight from the scenes
Things ain't what it seems but in time do tell the truth shall prevail

Until then you dudes bite y'all nails in anticipation
Before I know you hate it
Why I got you waiting, I too am waiting
Gotta see a couple faces when I make them face it

Truth that is that your boy ain't have patience
As a matter of fact it's wearing thin
But I tell you this though when the new year begins
Pussy's ain't got nuts because I'm going all in

We are listening
Plead for attention
But it ain't good if you don't wait
It ain't good if you don't wait

I'm the plot in every movie
Yet my theory stays the same
It ain't good if you don't wait
It ain't good if you don't wait

Now let's not get this misconstrued
To say that in this record I don't diss my dudes
Out of respect I couldn't check my once fist tight crew
Never in front of you, I couldn't get that rude

And I don't give a fuck but I couldn't get that cruel
It's knowing what I do I could get like, ooh
You wanna know what I do, don't ya?
Ya love it if I told you old fuckers, won't ya?

Uh, uh, scrap got to pay for this one
I'm sorry youngin', got to wait on this one
The Solution soon in stores
Date to be posted until then I'm on pause

Here's to DJ Khaled aka we the best

(What? It ain't no more to it)
Give 'em more man, more

Well, fuck it I don't wanna stop
But you forgot the gunner pop, tell me who you wanna rock
It's crew love Rocafella 'til I die
Nigga keep it moving, don't get caught up in this drive-by

The breaks over, your boy about to take over
If that number one spot open, give it here
Give my ground, dust off my chair
And y'all niggas can kiss my ass before I sit it there

Back from the dead fresh off the prison tier
Daddy here to put the kids to bed
By the way the war's on you can't call it off
It's too late plus the boss involved

Plead for attention
But it ain't good if you don't wait

Beanie Sigel,"Pss, yo, yo, yo (yo son roll!)
Oh shit, yo, yo, run!

Aiyo, I jumped from the 8th floor step, hit the ground
The pound fell, cops is coming
Runnin' through the pissy stairwells, I ain't hear nothin'
Buggin', only thing I remember was the bullshit summon
So I stopped at the 2nd floor, ran across, cracks is fallin'
My pockets is lean, clean when I vanished off
Took off, made track look easy
The walkie talkies them D-E-T's had, black, they was rated P.G.
Run, I will not give up, no, quick flag the car down
Take me to, Ghost here they come now!
Er! Pull off quick, back up, hit the bitch, dog
Turned down Hill, light the Marley spliff
Run! I will not get bagged on the rock
Run! I seen what happened to Un, they bad with they cops
Run! They am' shit, plan shit, destroy evidence
Fuck a case, I'm not comin' home when I'm fifty six
Die with the heart of Scarface and take fifty licks
Before I let these crackers throw me and shit
Bounce if you a good kid, bounce, do the bird hop
Curse, swerve to get served, these cocksuckers got nerve
Heard I was killin' shit, they must got word
That I told the chief on Rich Port I don't wanna merge

I skated through the back of the building, hit the steps up
Ran up in Kay crib, lay daddy rest
I had to break free, police on me and they F-B's
Yelling ""I think his name Lex, that's his aunt, freeze""
That's when I hit the window, indo' coming out the back room
Boom, Pretty and his man, Black Caesar
Damn, they saw me and they bustin' at me
Cab just missed me, plus them goochie frames, foul, that's six fifty
Stop back at suite, them leaf defense slid through my man garden
Yelled out 'pardon', kept it moving, peace
Build be gone, ain't no honor amongst thieves
Please, plus they heard I'm getting Parmesan cheese
And I won't stop moving til the metal dig me
Say word, yo, make 'em work for it, young rookie, y'all need me
That's when it is, what it is, if it's that or the cup
But in the ill gangstas book what they niggas do is

[Chorus]
Run! If you sell drugs in the school zone
Run! If you gettin' chased with no shoes on
Run! Fuck that! Run! Cops got, guns!
They givin' out life like by the tons
Run! If you ain't do shit, you it
That next felony, nigga, it's like three zip
So, run! Hop fences, jump over benches!
When you see me comin' get the fuck out the entrance!
Run! Fuck that! Run! Cops got guns!

Ah-hah! I might gotta take my shirt off (yeah, kid)
I like that one (uh-huh, go in, go in!)

Yo, uh, it's Task Force Tuesday, the NARCS is in the black car
I got five hundred, hundred packs in my backyard
Clear twelve-twelve's, that look like stuff shells
I'm cuttin' niggas throats on the sails, while they puff L's
Don't leave nothin' unbagged, shave everything
I learned from the O.G.'s to save everything (to save everything)
They come by one more time, they gon' hop out
They two deep, and one is a bitch, she gettin' knocked out
Then I can get rid of the pack
But I just copped this pretty chrome thing, so I'm dippin' with that
Uh, down-shiftin' on 'em like I got gears on me
(Run!) Besides that, I got about 5 years on me
(Run!) Scared to death, runnin' like I got bears on me
(Run!) My Timb's start feelin' like they Nike Air's on me
(Run!) It's hard for me to slow down, it's like I'm on the throughway
My belt's in the crib on the floor by my two-way
Now I'm try'nna hold my hammer up, and my pants too
If they don't kill me, they gon' give me a number I can't do
Rather it be the streets, then jail where I die at
And I'm asthmatic, so I'm lookin' for somewhere to hide at
But they too close, and I got this new toast
'Magine if I would of let off a shot or two, you know what I gotta do

Free hold east coast whole, boxing the Philly down
Down to Dela', when y'all rarely toting the milli round
I bring the milli to ya house, I was just down south
Carolina had the milli down there
Pearl Beach had the heater in reach, and four freaks
In Hooters, I made 'em lose it when they heard freedom of speech
Told them freaks that I gotta run, I'm on the run
But they tried to make me stay, they showed me two hooters a piece
I stayed for a second but you know I gotta skate
It's like a race, cops chase me, I'm chasing the moon
Before I left the premise, saw two more bitches
They told me they was witches, told me hop on they broom
I did, and then we went zoom
Don't you know them witches got me outtie wit the quickness
I'm buggin', I'm trippin' in reality I'm skitzin'
The cops got me trapped in the Audi wit the Smith and

D-Boy, yeah, Birdman Jr. in ya building, people
I'm a let you know how it go on my side of the mountain, whoadie

It's sure about does that you heard me
And I dropped in effect since 9/11
I'm on the avenue with nines, elevens, I'm a two times felon
That's why I keep the top up, on my 9-11
Pele, in New Orleans, ain't got no Rico law
So I keep that heat in the car, but they don't know
I had that 'dro in the seat of the car
But it's hot right now, so you can see me tomorrow
Ay, Ghostface, the youngins on the block duckin' blue and red lights
While your boy bypassing fare light
But if them cock suckers ever get me dead right
Three hots and the cops swallow weed and a knife, right?
I speed at night, take it easy in the day
Go hard wit the dough, take it easy wit the yae

And we ball from plentys of parties cause we start shit

She made it home for shop

Anything ya take cause the paper keep callin ya
Gangsters keep ballin fosho, we want more

Sell her body on the corner, smoke weed on a regular
Get a pimp off her money, dope man he was?

Pop a ? on who you blaming on cops lock them
A jail cell can't rehabilitate a nigga

Turn around and give a pedal to the floor till you fall
That's why a prison door, over a revolving door

Who ever knew when that child was born
He'd be Barack
44th president to be black, you gotta deal with that
Confess that I heard were crack, we gotta deal with that
Wonder why we put in the bags and throw still with that
See a phantom like beans I kill for that
Hood nigga going rich, now I got a mill for that
Law suit she's bringing, swear I've been through
With paying nigga in full, it's getting shot through his fuel
Known thug, since my brother got killed in cold blood
So would I avenge his death, so would I sell drugs
Promised to be a real nigga to the death of me
Bury my casket to the block with the rest of me
And let my headstone really was a father
Any nigga that thought he went hard, I went harder
So state out my bidness and off my mind
I take a shot to the downfall, I'm on my grind

I swear I swore to tell the truth, nothing but the whole truth
And I got up on that podium and lied
Then the coppers swore to tell the truth nothing but the whole truth
And he got up on that podium and cried
Said I tried to take his life
And the judge ain't take my side
'Cause when you black them risk is high to beat that case against them odds
Against them guys, with your last bit of money for your lawyer
My heart dropped when I seen him hit the corner
They was in the black Taurus, Dodge Charger, Explorer
Beat me to the ground and used my blood to mop the floor
But I'mma hold the water like it was holy water
Informants told informants how we had it and they swarmed us, they caught us

I spit the truth when I swore under oath
I lied, I lied
Shit, 'cause I don't take the stand on niggas
I rather give it to that man up close
Blocka, blocka
I told my cellie in the jail I wouldn't rap no more
See you when they free you cuz 'cause I ain't coming back no more
Wifey on the highway with them kids driving back and forth
Knowing if a nigga violate that I be back in court
Reside in somebody's federal estate
Niggas jumping on your case is worst than First 48
I seen a rat stand up on his case that wish he told
Come on a pill and give a nigga a will

I know I told you I stopped slanging yay, strapped everyday

It was we vs. them vs. three then ten
Swore I'd never re again but I lied, I lied
Now the package is enormous
And that come with informants
We already kinda hot so it's stupid to keep it on us
We just being hard headed
Disregarding the drop
Then they bagged him in the cab and brought him back to the spot
Found six p's of piffy a little under fifty
That little bit of bread make the relationship shifty
And it's all my fault he still tryna to convince me
I miss my goddaughter I wonder if she miss me
Birthdays and Christmas I ain't never missed it
Her dad is my brother I love him from a distance

You niggas cheapening my All-Star Weekends
If y’all can’t swim in the deep end then watch nigga
Woo! 80,000 on this watch niggas
Yuugh! And I ain’t never had to watch nigga
Rich or wealthy, pick your poison
I think I paid for one too many abortions 
Another Celine, it’s like a routine
It’s like ferris wheel of waist trainers and Seven jeans
Her new body's in my new body
Make her in an hourglass that’s my new hobby
Rich nigga shit, how I blew my first million
Luckily was somethin’ in the ceiling, keep dealin

Talk numbers, but never talk ‘em to me though
When you’re the link to what fits in the keyhole
The realest nigga to marathon on the RICO
The last cocaine superhero
I got the cape on, to cover kilos
The villain wins, the evolution of Nino
Goddamn Batman holy toledo
Nah, you ain’t talkin’ to me though

The Robb Report of the snort
Kings hold court
Lawyers get bought
Palms get greased when them cases get fought
No felony what the fuck is you tellin’ me
Reduced to simple assault
It cost to keep it hush-hush
It was just us
Ended up sellin’ my Bat Mobile
The crash don’t kill
It’s how you survives it
Rebound on niggas, I nine live’d it
Couldn’t miss a Super Bowl or a Cancun
Bitches ain’t respecting niggas not in full bloom
So the neck is full moon
I’m living a lie, she live for this life
And loving the Alaia pumps
Loving the rush, I’m living “The Wire” Uh
Drugs and this rap is really “Empire”
Rich nigga shit, how I lost my second million

So no threat, be on your steps with the whole hood there
Yeah, shoot up shit then we blow the scene
Kerosene in a 20 ounce Poland Spring
Nothing to lose attitude like Ron from Arizona
It’s homicide when I slide up on ya
Reporting live from the project benches
Hella caine, dope in cellophane, dirty syringes 
Heron zombies street-walking on three-week binges
Clientele look like the “Thriller” vid in 3D lenses
COD, niggas never had to front me jawns
I’m weighing bricks on the scale they put the lunch meat on
I’m Nino Brown in the projects
Yes, Curtis Jackson in his pyrex
Get rich or die tryin’ is my mindset
And spend it all until I’m swallowing dirt
Cause I ain’t never see a Brinks truck follow a hearse 
I ain’t never see a dead man taking the stand
I ain’t never see a nigga swallow a bullet 
And live to talk about it

Beanie Sigel,"Nah, no I'm not
Nah, nobody on this
You know how that go

Now I'm living with a purpose, I ain't perfect
Allah got me, ain't spend too much time in churches
This from the heart, I ain't spend too much time rehearsing
I was really thinking rob before I purchased
I was really thinking God these niggas thirsty
Paranoid around soft niggas, they make me nervous
Clutching a pistol around these clowns that shit'll surface
If you knew my life you would understand I deserve it
Nobody gave me shit, told me I was worthless
Felt like I was cursed until the day that paper surfaced
It's a reason why me and Beans can relate in person
I'm cut from that cloth, all that talking'll get you murdered
I relaxed on that juice, them percocets be testing me
Plus your bitch keep texting me, I ain't attracted sexually
These niggas selling blow up, got the fiends frustrated
Tryna get this dough up, package on me, ratchet on me
Tell me what your life like cause mines is real
Every thing signed and sealed, my mind on pills
Niggas'll rat on they own mother, they see that time get real
Teddy bears and candle lightings give your moms the chills

As far as I can remember I've been a real one
They say that pressure bust pipes but I don't feel none
Just like these whack ass rappers I can't feel one
You said you wanted the real back well here it come

Pressure's on once again but I embrace it
I weathered through the storm before, I'm never breaking
I do this for the youth in the Matrix who won't make it
I tell 'em every knock is a boost, remain patient
But every move he make is calculated through his hunger
It's sad to say shorty might not make it through the summer
His mom turned tricks for a fix, pills strung her
He only met his pop for flicks and a jail jumper
His stomach empty but his clip full
He pop xannies by the fist full
Drink syrup, skip school
Pants hanging off his ass, ain't been in the bath
I try to steer 'em right cause I hate to see him crash
Tell him just stay in his lane and remain humble
You bound to get hit in the game just don't fumble
I seen G's drop the ball and straight crumble
Just know if your aunt had a dick she'd be your uncle
What your life like nigga mines is real
No if, mights, maybes, probably, wills
I blow your fucking head off with that revolver steel
I shot a nigga on tour, got that revolver still
Know when you fucking with the Bully you involved with real
I put your body somewhere, they won't solve your kill nigga
You need to stop if you think Mac won't pop it
And your mom in all black out casket shopping
It's the Broadstreet Bully and Dave East, yeah we playing for keeps
These niggas dressing like freaks and they calling it fleek
These niggas be signing sheets plus they calling police
Know every nigga in the ghetto ain't involved in the streets
We ain't really into the games we gon' rest you to peace
Pull something big out, give you a long kiss on the cheek
Who ready to die? Sky's the limit who want beef?
I was a bad boy before I repped the ROC
This ain't nothing new shit this just what the fuck we do
We like no limit soldiers and nigga I'm that true
The reason, the solution nigga I'm that too
Whoever stuck to the realness, then I'm that glue
It's a war going on outside you ain't safe from
You can play Super man, you get your cape hung
We don't start no shit and we don't take none
We just 100% until our day come

Gotta do something muthafucka punch ya in the mouth

Hitman, Oschino and Sparks, criminal records
Talk to em yo

This is for my ghetto niggas
Reputation is everything so go at with ya life
It's just like credit the minute ya fuck up you ruined it ya know

Yo as young adolescents (aha) mommy said we was so precious
I mean who knew round to O.D to Heron and I'd catch cases
Let my life slip inside the hands of these judges
Where did we go wrong ha?
Was it these missing father figures?
Or watching mom struggle and feed us
Come on I need answers
It's gak on the judges for turning burners on niggas who try to merk us
On the day of judgement who knows
Until then we'll never know so for now I'm a do Omilio
Drunk then a muthafucka disrespecting bitches
Attitude still the same fuck these niggas until it's my time to go
You know I'm doing no changes shit plus I'm happy to be here
With my new family, Black Friday and them Rocafella niggas
I'm focused bring the chorus in

[Chorus:]
My life make me want to holla sometime and throw in my hand
But I won't fold you know how I roll
I live that life of a trouble man and play by the code
Where I'm from just make me want to holla sometime and go get my gun
Go all out but I think of my sons
Then I look where I was at how far did I come

You see lady's prostituting wearing tight leopard
My sneaks was dogs like Pit bulls and German shepherds
Fuck where it came from I needed money fast
White boys bangin' Led Zeppelin went in twenty bags
So I got my first pack on fifty first and Market
I ain't want clothes I just wanted some boss to mark it
No moms to call no dad to be
Stuck on the streets stomach growlin' like a dog showin' his teeth
Life ain't sweet life ain't a game
I know life is more real then Slick Rick chain
Everybody get a hand so play the hand you dealt
And there's nobody to blame fuck it blame yourself
You can go all out and try to reveal
Like a nuclear staying how you write in a cell
You just better pray a liar and hope you prevail
I know living in the hood is hell, come on

[Chorus:]
My life make me want to holla sometime and throw in my hand
But I won't fold you know how I roll
I live that life of a trouble man and play by the code
Where I'm from just make me want to holla sometime and go get my gun
Go all out but I think of my sons
Then I look where I was at how far did I come

Yo right now I'd like to take the time to thank my family members
And phoney homies for turning they backs on me
Make me stronger help me deal with snakes and side guys
Going but I was grooming like a rodent
And I swear these streets will turn us boys to men
I'm the pain with juice and gin try to stack them Horace Grants to a million
Playing Caesar how I blessed them bitches
Excuse my arrogance but baby clone me
This petty world a kill me slowly take away my grandma mami hold me
Life obstacles is getting stressful that's why I don't come around
Written between the paper line examples of my lifestyle
So read inside the guidelines ain't no sunshine
Until you break the chains and fly freely 'cause I know for a fact
Somewhere out in the world somebody need me
To make em smile and appreciate em believe me
But main'tain in the main while baby
Omilio'll be there for you knahmean shit I'm a trouble man

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

My life make me want to holla sometime and throw in my hand
But I won't fold you know how I roll
I live the life of a trouble man and play by the code

You always loved Charlie best
You never knew how each night I wept

And I can't forgive myself
Oh, I can't forgive myself

You would hide yourself in a shrug
As your hair starting falling out
When you took off your dressing gown

With a lock of your hair in her hands
And I knew there was no turning back

One that you could never keep
And how you just breathe it
To everyone that you ever meet
And when I heard it
Second hand, so to speak
I saw that I was someone else
And you became just someone else
And all of the stories
How they just flow right out of your mouth
Now all of their glory
Was not enough to go around
If they're all hungry
Yeah, they're only mouths to feed
And you can all say no
No, I could never say no

As the curtains take their call
And we slip through the seams, through the inbetween
Of a truth and a lie, of a God and a sky
Of a widow and bride, of you and I

So bury your weakness
And chew the marrow from the bone
Keep yourself a secret
From all of those who've always known
It's been revealing
Ignore your skin as it peels away
It's been revealing
What you could never begin to explain

And guard your hope with your life
For the darkness, she will come
Oh and you have nowhere left to run

You said I never understand the pain or share the shame,

You took my love and now you celebrate.
When the morning comes, no I don't believe
In my God, oh my God how could you take her from me?

by your school just yesterday.
I never meant for to cause you any pain

Bears,"Boy, all I see, is you and me
And all I do, is think of you

Yo, I remember when we met the whole scene was set
Backstage rockin' black shades
Told you not to be afraid
We touched and when your smile turned to a blush
[Incomprehensible]
I had to get to know your name

Then I got your number
17 and under, maybe just a little younger
Had to get to know you, 'cause there's things I wanna show you
Forget them other brothers they know lines that they told you

Now your acting all shy, hmm I wonder why
Everytime I looked at you, you turned and drop your eye
We faced, began to lace you up with lines
Fragrance by Ann Klein had me losing my mind

With your zodiac sign, my perfect match, in fact
I'm compatible with anything from Mio to Ash
Now it's all about us we're hooked like drugs
I'm on my way to being a thug, show me love

Boy all I see, is you and me
And all I do is, think of you
Give me the chance to know your name
I'll never turn and walk away

I can't get you out of my mind
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't hooked after just one look
Yeah see you at the mall with your mom looking all flashy
Poppin' out of a taxi, met eues when you passed me

Been inside of my head all day, what can I say?
All I can do is reminicse like Mary J
I want to get with you
So come and get with me
We'll be K-I-S-S-I-N-G and all that good stuff

Calling you bluff, now look at us
Just met and already talkin' 'bout trust
All the things we did, how we planned to live
How you got rid me of that kid, who use to call you crib
Shut it down

Now look what you found a state of dawn
You da bomb, plus you got props from my mom
Now it's all about us we're hooked like drugs
I'm on my way to being a thug, show me love

I can't get you out of my mind
Think about you all of the time
Wanna get to know you baby, oh

I'm glad I made my move
I'm glad I stepped to you
Enough respect that my whole crew accepted you
Even my ex called you 'cause she wasn't insecure
Feeling got a little hurt but was being mature

Gave her blessings that she learned some valuable lessons
Now she use me as her reference
She's my best friend
Don't even stress, 'cause all I see is you and me
Like Latifah you're Queen, let's bring some unity

Ain't no reason to fight, you know we're keeping it tight
Whether walking or holding hands or sharing seats on the bike
Always on my mind with your Gucci design
Feel free to drop a line, yeah that would suit me fine

It's all about you boo, and all the things you do
Making dreams come true, buying rings for two

비가 떨어지니까 나도 떨어질 것 같애 뭐
네가 보고 싶다거나 그런 건 아냐
다만 우리가 가진 시간이 좀 날카로울 뿐
네가 참 좋아했었던 이런 날이면
아직 너무 생생한 기억을 꺼내놓고
추억이란 덫에 일부러 발을 들여놔
벗어나려고 발버둥 조차 치지 않아

이제 너를 다 지워냈지만
모두 다 비워냈지만 또다시 비가 내리면 (내리면)

힘들게 숨겨놨던 너의 모든
기억들이 다시 돌아와 널 찾나 봐

비가 오는 날에 나를 찾아와 밤을 새워 괴롭히다
비가 그쳐가면 너도 따라서 서서히 조금씩 그쳐가겠지

너에게로 이젠
돌아갈 길은 없지만 (없지만)
지금 행복한 너를 보며

난 그래도 웃어볼게 널 잡을 수 있었 던
힘이 내겐 없었으니까

비가 오는 날에 나를 찾아와 밤을 새워 괴롭히다
비가 그쳐가면 너도 따라서 (널 찾아서) 서서히 조금씩 그쳐 가겠지

어차피 끝나버린 걸 이제 와 어쩌겠어
뒤늦게 후회나 하는 거지 덜떨어진 놈처럼
비는 항상 오니까 계속 반복되겠지
그치고 나면 그제서야 나도 그치겠지

Date women on T.V. with the help of Chuck Woolery
Words are flowing out just like the Grand Canyon
And I'm always out looking for a female companion

I took off her moccasins and put on my bib

I'll bring you back to the place and your dress I'm peeling
Your body's on time and your mind is appealing
Staring at the cracks up there upon the ceiling

I dropped my drawers and it was welcome back Kotter
We were cutting up the rug she started cutting up the carpet

And that girl ain't nothing but a crab

Step to the rhythm step step to the ride

Tune in turn on to my tune that's live

She'll show you a good time then she'll show you the door
Break up with your girl it ended in tears
Vincent Van Gogh and mail that ear
I call her in the middle of the night when I'm drinking
The phone booth on the corner is damp and it's stinking
She said come on over it was me that she missed
I threw that trash can through her window cause you know I got dissed

She wants to waste my time and that's no delusion
Her final decision is perfection and precision
She's grade A class - number one in her division

(chorus) She's on it

She acts like a nag - I don't know how it started
Even when I'm chillin' - she acts retarded
It's gets annoying - so high on the tip
If a pirate had a Def Jam shirt - she'd be hard on his tip

(repeat chorus)

Cold chillin' in the spot - and she won't stop
She'll do what's best just to reach the top
She studies real hard - all night she'll cram
In school she majors in advanced Def Jam

(repeat chorus)

Her bedroom eyes - they start to twitch
But she won't front cause she's got that itch
She'd drop to her knees if I'd only say please
Instead of counting sheep - cold counting Beasties

She had taken all the things from inside his room
I found myself naked in the middle of the floor
She had taken the bed and the chest of drawers

There was this girl around the way
She liked by home-piece M.C.A.
He said he would not give her play
I asked him, please?, he said, you may

Four and three and two and one (What up!)
And when I'm on the mic the suckers run (Word!)
Down with Adrock and Mike D. and you ain't
And I got more juice than Picasso got paint
Got rhymes that are rough and rhymes that are slick

Be-E-A-S-T-I-E, what up Mike D.

I'm never in training, my voice is not straining
People always biting and I'm sick of complaining

Father to many, married to none
And in case you're unaware I carry a gun
Stepped into the party, the place was over packed
Saw the kid that dissed my home boy and shot him in the back
I had to get a beeper 'cause my phone is tapped
You better keep your mouth shut 'cause I'm fully strapped
I got money in the bank, I can still get high
That's why your girlfriend thinks that I'm so fly
I've got money and juice, twin sisters in my bed
Their father had Aids so I shot him in the head
If I played guitar I'd be Jimmy Page

You wanna know why, because I'm
October 31st, that is my date of birth
I got to the party and you know what I did the Smurf
Taxing all females from coast to coast
And when I get my fill I'm chilly most
We rag-tag girlies back at the hotel
And then we all switch places when I ring the bell
I chill at White Castle 'cause it's the best
But I'm fly at Fat Burger when I way out west
K-I-N-G-A-D whammy
All the fly ladies are on my jammy
Went to the prom, wore the fly blue rental
Got six girlies in my Lincoln Continental
I met a girl at the party and she started to flirt
I told her some rhymes and she pulled up her skirt
Spent some bank, I got a high powered jumbo
Rolled up a wooly and I watched Colombo

Kick it over here baby pop
And let all the fly skimmies
Feel the beat

Between the turntables keep the vodka and the mixes

I do the Smurf, the Popeye, and the Jerry Lewis

A mic in my hand and a mouth full of Miller
I got a hat not a visor, I drink Budweiser
The turntables up on the drum riser
The needle's in the groove and the vinyl's on the platter

I looked out the window seen his bald head
Ran to the fridge and pulled out an egg
Scoped him with my scopes, he had no hair
Launched that shot and he was caught out there
Saw the convertible driving by
I loaded up the slingshot, let one fly
He went for his to find he didn't have one
Put him in check, correct, with my egg-gun
The egg, a symbol of life
I go inside your house and bust out your wife
I pulled out the jammy, he thought it was a joke
The trigger, I pulled his face, the yolk
Reached in his pocket, took all his cash
Left my man standing with the egg mustache
Suckers, they come a dime a dozen
""When I say dozen, you know what I'm talkin' about, boy""

Yeah, that's right, I'm the Egg Man, driving around
King of the town (yeah)
Always got my windows rolled down
Ready to throw
You know, I'm the Egg Man

Once upon a time
Egg Man

Humpty Dumpty was a big fat egg
He was playing the wall, then he broke his leg
Tossed it out the window, three minutes hot
Hit the Rastaman, he said, (blood clot)
What came first, the chicken or the egg?
I egged the chicken, and then I ate his leg
Riding the trains, in between cars
When I pull out the station, You're Gonna Get Yours
Drive-by eggings, plaguing LA
""Yo, you just got my little cousin, ese""
Sometimes hard-boiled, sometimes runny (Ray)
Comes from a chicken, not a bunny, dummy
People laugh, it's no joke
My name's ""Yauch"" and I'm throwing the yolk
""Now they got me in a cell,"" but I don't care
It was then that I got caught catching people out there

Up on the roof, in my car, up all night
I'm going through science like Dolemite
The Mack, who?
I'm the Egg Man, taxi driver?
I'm the Egg Man
Egg Man, Egg Man

We all dressed in black, we snuck up around the back
We began to attack, the eggs did crack on Haze's back
Sam I Am, down with the program
Green Eggs and Ham, Yosemite Sam
Come Halloween, you know I come strapped
I throw it at a sucker, ""k-pap""
You made the mistake and judge a man by his race
You go through life with egg on your face
Woke up in the morning, peculiar feeling
Looked up and saw egg dripping from the ceiling
Family, punk rocks, the businessman
I'll dog everybody with the egg in my hand
Not like the crack that you put in a pipe
But crack on your forehead, here's a towel, now wipe

I found a nice place to visit but a better place to rob

I couldn't help to notice I was caught in a speed trap
Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry, on the run from Dirty Harry
Stash the cash in the dash, but my gun I did carry
I'm seeing blue and red flashing deep in the night

Read me my rights as if I didn't know this
Threw me in the tank with a drunk called Otis
With his five o'clock shadow he smelled of three day old beer

I said I'm charming I'm dashing I'm rental car bashing
I'm phony-paper passing at Nick's Check and Cashing
I went before the judge he sent my to the Brooklyn house of D
He said, ""You behave or we'll throw away the key""
Houdini'd out the cuffs, kicked the screw in the knee
I took the Bailiff's wallet and went straight to OTB

To all the girls
All the girls",B-Boy Bouillabaisse,1989
Beastie Boys,"Some static started in the pool hall
Hit a motherfucker's face with the cue ball
Then I met this girl she tried to gank me
So I smacked her in the pootie with a Plank, B
'Cause me and my crew were out breaking windows
The bingo, the lotto you know I'll never win those
Possession is half the law
I had my routines before all y'all
Your whole life is coming apart at the seams
You ain't nothing but a car thief biting routines
See, I'm a city slicker I ain't no townie
Right now I wish I had another hash brownie
Like Ricky always said you've got to toke and pass
Or Mookie's gonna kick your fuckin' ass
You try to take what isn't yours like a God damn rat
See, personally I wouldn't wanna go out like that

I'm a writer, a poet, a genius, I know it
I don't buy cheeba I grow it
People always trying to get next to me
I had a beautiful experience on ecstasy
I Smoked up a bag of elephant tranquilizer
Because I had to deal with a money-hungry miser
Had a 'caine-filled Kool with my man Rush Rush
Saw my teeth fall in the sink when I started to brush
You be doing nose candy on the Bowie coke mirror
My girl asked for some but I pretended not to hear her
You can't deny me, you always want to try me
Yo, you're just gonna get your ass kicked
Homeboy throw in the towel
Your girl got dicked by Ricky Powell
The Godfather of Soul in the belly of the beast
Smoking that dust at St. Anthony's Feast

All the wife beaters and all the tax cheaters
Sitting in the White House pulling their peters
Buy my cheeba from the cop down the street
The only cop with a rope chain walking the beat
So like a sneaky pouch time bomb tickin'
Or like the beat to my rhyme just kickin'
Space cake cookies I discover who I am
I'm a dusted old bummy hurdy-gurdy man
Five-O caught me now I'm going to the mountains
Said good-bye to my girl, my lawyers and accountants
My mind is kinda rhymin' and I think I oughta think
So I'm rockin' all the rhymes and I'll have another drink
So the lights are flashing, my mind is spinning
I feel like it is always the beginning
Of another rhyme I'm rapping, M.C-ing I rock
You ain't nothing but a car thief who must be stopped",Car Thief,1989

Johnny Ryall is the bum on my stoop
I gave him fifty cents to buy some soup
He knows the time with the fresh Gucci watch
He's even more over than the mayor Ed Koch
Washing windows on the Bowery at a quarter to four
'Cause he ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
Livin' on borrowed time and borrowed money
Sleepin' on the street there ain't a damn thing funny
With the hand-me-down food and hand-me-down clothes
A rockabilly past of which nobody knows
Makes his home all over the place
He goes to sleep by falling down on his face
Sometimes known as the leader of the homeless
Sometimes drunk, man the kid's always phoneless
Sleepin' on the street in a cardboard box
He's better off drinkin' than smokin' the rocks

Kickin' uptown, kickin' downtown, kickin' crosstown

Well, you go upstate and get your head together
Thunderbird is the word and you're light as a feather
Detox at the flop house no booze allowed
Remember the good old days with the rockabilly crowd
Memphis is where he's from (out in Tennessee)
He lives in the street but he's no bum
He's the rockabilly star from the days of old
He used to have teeth all filled with gold
He got platinum voice but only gold records
On the bass (was Boots), on the drums (was Checkers)
Louis Vuitton with the Gucci guitar

(So what's your name, yauch?) my name is M.C.A
I've been coming to where I am from the get-go
Find that I can groove with the beat when I let go
So put your worries on hold
Get up and groove with the rhythm in your soul
And now I'd like to pass the mic
To my brother Adrock, c'mon and shine like a light

Yes, yes, y'all and yes, yes, y'all
I'm always on time, nevertheless, y'all
And that's right, y'all
I shed light, y'all
I've got no time in my life to get uptight, y'all
So what you gonna say that I don't know already?
I'm like Clyde and I'm rockin' steady
But time flies when you're having fun, so Mike D (that's me!)
C'mon and get some

M-I-K-E to the D
You come and see me and you pay your fee
Do what I do professionally
To tell the truth I am exactly what I want to be
Now Adrock (huh?) and M.C.A (yeah?)
Let's rock this joint in the old school way

Well, I'm on 'till the crack of dawn
Mowing down M.C.'s like I'm mowing the lawn
I go off like nothing can phase me
You think we'll ever meet Stevie?
(One of these days, D!)
But I can stand my ground and I am down
To wax an M.C who acts like a clown
But for now, I'd like to ask you how
You like the feel of the bass in your face in the crowd?",Pass the Mic,1992
Beastie Boys,"Yes, I got more bounce than the fucking bump
And then you want to know why because I'm motherfuckin' truckin'
I'm in the pocket just like Grady Tate
Got supplies of beats so you don't have to wait
'Cause I'm the master blaster, drinking up the shasta
My voice sounds sweet 'cause it has to (looking good!)
So light a match to my ass 'cause I'm blowin' up
I'd like to thank the people for just showin' up
But now I want y'all to move it
Put your point on the floor and just prove it
And I'm smurfin', not rehearsin', gettin' live, y'all
A little puffy, so you know what, I'm doin' right
'Cause that's the kind of frame of mind I'm in
I got this feelin' that it's back again
So don't touch me, 'cause I'm electric
And if you touch me, you'll get shocked

You got, you got, you got, you got, you got
You've got the boomin' system, but it's sloshing out doo-doo
You think it's chocolate milk, but it's watered down Yoo-hoo
I've been through many times in which I thought I might lose it
The only thing that saved me, has always been music
We've got our own studio, the Son of the G
It's no question, life's been good to me
'Cause life ain't nothing but a good groove
A good mixtape to put you in the right mood
This one goes out to my man, the Groove Merchant
Coming through with beats for which I've been searching
Like two sealed copies, of Expansions
I'm like Tom Vu with yachts and mansions
The logo I sport is the face of the monkey
Union made, Ben Davis-quality, it's no junk, see?
My chrome is shining, just like an icicle
I ride around town in my low-rider bicyle

So many wack emcees, you get the TV bozak
Ain't even gonna call out your names, 'cause you're so wack
And one big oaf, who's faker than plastic
A dictionary definition of the word spastic
You should have never started something that you couldn't finish
'Cause writin' rhymes to me is like Popeye to spinach
I'm bad ass, move ya' fat ass, 'cause you're wack, son
Dancing around like you think you're Janet Jackson
Thought you could walk on me to get some ground to walk on
I'll put the rug out under your ass as I talk on
I'll take you out like a sniper on a roof
Like an emcee at the fever in the DJ booth
With your headphones strapped, you're rockin' rewind/pause
Tryin' to figure out what you can do to go for yours
But like a pencil to a paper, I got more to come
One after another, you can all get some
So you better take your time, and meditate on your rhyme
'Cause your shit'll be stinkin' when I go for mine
And that's right, y'all, don't get uptight, y'all
You can't say shit because you're biting what I write, y'all
And that's wrong, y'all, over the long haul
You can't cut the mustard when you're fronting it all",Professor Booty,1992

Like a whirlpool spin beginning to unwind
And I stand at the edge cautiously awaiting
As time slips by
Carefully navigating by the stars in the sky
And I sit, and I think to myself
And on the horizon, the sun light begins to climb
And it seems like it's been so long since he shined
But I'm sure it was only yesterday

A cold chill of fear cut through me
I felt my heart contract
To my mind I brought the image of light
And I expanded out of it
My fear was just a shadow
And then a voice spoke in my head
And she said, dark is not the opposite of light
It's the absence of light

Beastie Boys,"Face down don't turn around
Listen to the bass pound
From all type of angles
This ain't no star spangled banner
More juice than Tropicana
Rock from New York to Savannah
'Cause it's Macka Framma?
When I go to a show
Some run some come plenty have fun
To watch a nig get dumb
The right way, the hype way, the tight way
You're fucking right that I might say...

[Chorus:]
Fronters get confronted while stunts get stunted
And my homies get blunted while the rats get hunted
So if you want it here it is so put em up or shut em up
Smack'em down and I'll yell pick'em up so get'em up
Word em up, as I fuck it up I tear it up
So listen up and don't move just play the groove
Don't dime when I crime 'cause kid that's
Fessin' up but when I pull out my mag
Just raise em up

[Chorus:]

One to the three to the motherfuckin' two
And you don't know what I'ma do
That's because you're new but
I got the kaya ta make you feel higher
So say what you want you motherfuckin' liar
Don't mean to boast I don't mean to brag but I got the grab bag
Of funky shit you wish you had
But it's the pace that we gotta pick up so stick 'em up
Hands high reach for the sky
But don't try to get fly cause it's easy to die
Just like a blink of an eye when the shots rang
Boom bang rat ta tat tat
Watch your back cause I'm coming black
Kill that yig yag put the money in the bag
Pass the zags with the Billboard Mag
But freeze feel the breeze if ya sneeze than you're shot
Now ya gotta run what'cha got

Beastie Boys,"One, two
Right about now I'd like to dedicate this song
Out to my main homey, Mike D
A'ight, let's kick it
Ready go

Get on the mic, get get on the mic
Just get on the mic, get on the mic, Mike
Let's be real and don't cloud the issue
The rhymes are rope, an emcee you must listen to
People say that they been missin' me and missin' you
Get on the mic and let's show them like we used to
Well, you say fuck that, yo, Holmes, fuck this
I'm the King AdWhammy and you're Dick Butkus
One half science and another half soul
Nicknamed Mike D, not Fat Morton Jelly Roll
Got busy in 'Frisco, fooled around in Fresno
Got over on your girlie 'cause you know she never says no

So just get on the mic, just get on the mic
Get get on the mic, get on the mic, Mike

Well, Mike D, is a special individual
Pullin' out knots and pullin' in residuals
Go to the movies, get the Rolos
The cholos ridin' slow and low
Mike on the mic and bust with the solo
Mike, my stromy, don't be so selfish

Sending this out to k-rob and rahmalzee
Let me introduce myself on this cut
I'm Adrock, I'm lit like a motherfuck
Well, I'm brewing up rhymes like I was using a still
I've got an old school flow like Mike Mcgill
'Cause Yauch's on the upright, the shit just ain't funny
Got fat bass lines like Russel Simmons steals money
Got clientele, you know I rock well
And then you're on my dick because I'm d.f.l
Yeah, Mike 'cause playing the bass is my favorite shit
I might be a hack on the stand up but I'm working at it
I get my hair cut correct like Anthony Mason
Then I ride the I.R.T. right up to Penn Station
Penn Station up on 8th ave.
Listen all why'all you get the ball bath
He's got the savoir-faire because he's debonair
Mike D with the vinyl with the grooves so rare
And the rhymes that we're are doo-doo
Been makin' with the freak freak, so unique
Been learning from the elders now it's time to speak
Oh that shit sounds nice
Mike D come on and get it on why'all
Talking shit about a mile a minute
Put the wax on the table and let the DJ spin it
Excuse me motherfuckers, can I beg your pardon
I'm gonna see the Knicks at Madison Square Garden
And like the Knicks I got game like I worked at Hasbro
On the mic I bug, like I was Prince Jazzbo
The rhymes are stupid to make you go coo-coo
You can't sleep 'cause you're little Cindy Lou Who
Down with the hurrah since the raising hell tour
Just listen to his cuts there's no reason to tell more
Cindy what I didn't catch the last one
That shit sounded kinda nice, but bust a fast one
Well I'm not known for my speed raps
So grab the microphone and cut out the claps
Ah yea, I like that shit is kind of rough
I'll grab the microphone and fuck it up
I might seem out there, a little deranged
I've got to cool off, catch me on the driving range
Well I'm the ladies' choice like I was J.J. Evans
Legalize the weed and I'll say thank heavens
I'm talking P.G.A. pro tour 2
I'm Doctor Beppers in my TV, in my golfing shoes
Pass me an iron and I'll bust a chip shot
Then you throw me off the green because I'm strictly hip-hop
I'll grab the tee, I'll tee off
I'll grab the golf clubs and I'm off, I'm Audi so check me
I've got the Timbos on my toes when I'm not on the green
I've got the custom made boots with the spikey things
I'm working on my driving 'cause I'm going pro
I've got the funky fly golf gear from head to toe
Yea, the B-boys makin' with the freak freak, freak freak
Mario's callin' Nonni's about the pesto pizza
And then he's on a mission and he's checking for Peach-a

And then I fuck it up and then I turn it in
And then I turn it out, got the body rockin' sound
And then you know I'm gonna get down and
Eat a Scooby snack and take disco nap
Because I'm shopping at sears, 'cause I don't buy at the gap
Sending this one out to all the funky inspirations
Pretty Purdie on the drums with the beat relations
Well, I'm working on rhymes, they're coming line by line
Trying to put what I feel into word and rhymes
I've got a feeling coming on, I've got to make some shit
A little something stupid, for the twisted and sick
Because I drive like a maniac on the streets
And I don't give fuck 'cause I've got the beats
Got my nuts swingin' from left to right and
Right to left and I'm death defying

I spin my fortune on a wheel like Sajak
Here's the payback keep going strong like since the way back
I try to be myself but I lose track
'Cause the shit gets complicated now I've got to get back
As we learn to breed love for one another
In these times of melding cultures
I give respect for what's been borrowed and lent
I know this music comes down from African descent
Because I don't need a magic potion
Let me talk about back field in motion
My girls got cheeks for weeks and I'm happy
You know I'm a sneak like my old grand pappy
I gotta give thanks to my man Archie Shepp
For staying true to inspiration and I don't half step
So I kick out the jams and tell you who I am
And I talk to the people like Les McCann

I ask God for a rhyme or two
A little something for the wise as well as the fool
A little something to affect a little taste of change
For the together and the strong as well as the deranged
I'll do you right like bobby knight
And then I'm rapping on the mic to the Broadway light
Stomp my hands, I clap my feet and
I'm bugging off Yusef Lateef
I got a match to my ass and I'm a keep it lit
I need to get some cash, call my accountant Britt
I'm rushing around town taking care of my functions
Always got one more thing so forget about function
We create this world and the problems go on
Create our lives and the things that go wrong
So to the deaf, the blind, look around and listen
To what it is you want and for what you're wishing",Alright Hear This,1994
Beastie Boys,"As I develop the awakening mind
I praise the Buddhas as they shine
I bow before you as I travel my path
To join your ranks, I make my full-time task
For the sake of all beings I seek
The enlightened mind that I know I'll reap
Respect to Shantideva and all the others
Who brought down the Dharma for the sisters and brothers
I give thanks for this world as a place to learn
And for this human body that I know I've earned
And my deepest thanks to all sentient beings
For without them, there would be no place to learn what I'm seeing
There's nothing here that's not been said before
But I put it down now so that I'll be sure
To solidify my own views
And I'll be glad if it helps anyone else out too

If others disrespect me or give me flak
I'll stop and think before I react
Knowing that they're going through insecure stages
I'll take the opportunity to exercise patience
I'll see it as a chance to help the other person
Nip it in the bud before it can worsen
A chance for me to be strong and sure
As I think on the Buddhas who have come before
As I praise and respect the good they've done
Knowing love can conquer hate in every situation
We need other people in order to create
The circumstances for the learning that we're here to generate
Situations that bring up our deepest fears
So we can work to release them until they're cleared
Therefore, it only makes sense
To thank our enemies despite their intent

The Bodhisattva path is one of power and strength
A strength from within to go the length
Seeing others are as important as myself
I strive for a happiness of mental wealth
With the interconnectedness that we share as one
Every action that we take affects everyone
So in deciding for what a situation calls
There is a path for the good for all
I try to make my every action for that highest good
With the altruistic wish to achieve Buddhahood
So I pledge here before everyone who's listening
To try to make my every action for the good of all beings
For the rest of my lifetimes and even beyond
I vow to do my best, to do no harm
And in times of doubt, I can think on the Dharma
And the Enlightened Ones who've graduated Samsara",Bodhisattva Vow,1994
Beastie Boys,"Like the blackbirds Ima do it fluid
Building rhymes like buildings, like a Stonehenge druid
Step up and get enlightened, educating my mind
I play the tape forward, it's not time to rewind
Step inside the motherfucker and I get my flow on
Amalgamate my style so I got something to go on
Seasons change when it comes their time
Fall brings the winter and on back to springtime
Well, it's the king Adrock and that's who I am
Listen all of y'all I'm not the son of Sam
'Cause I'm thin and I don't grin
But check it out people 'cause I love to go and swim
Caught up on the phone fiber optic distraction
Information super highway got the brain contraction
I'm the kung-fu master versus the sumo wrestler
Got the beats in Manhattan you can hear in Westchester
Well, my mother was born out in Coney Island
Raised on the L.E.S Manhattan Island
My dad camo out from Detroit and they had me
And back on through Ellis Island goes through the family tree
Well, I'm a six-point-seven on the Richter scale
Got rhymes gallore and then I never fail
Like gravy to potatoes, Luke to Darth Vader
I'm a souped-up sucker and I'll see you all later

You see me coming down the block with the funky cuts
You say (hey, Mike D!) and I say mic these nuts
I've got attractions like I'm Elvis Costello
Adam Yauch grab the mic 'cause you know you're my mellow
Well when I get it into the zone
I'm gonna take my mind to a place where I'm all alone
Ah well, I've got my shit and the rhyme style's kicking
My brain is flowing, honest like Abe Lincoln
'Cause I'm the fuckin' rhythm ace with the rhyme selection
Listen all y'all I rap with perfection
Because I got the mother fuckin' old school flavor
That you savor so watch your behavior
Talking other dimensions, levels higher
Why did Billy Joel say ""we didn't start the fire""
Take you to another realm, another level
I've got the funky rhymes but I'm not the funky devil
I step from minute to minute, lifetime to lifetime
Step from stage to stage to see it all unwind
Slowly but surely I seek to find my mind
And every wall that I face is ow my own design
Yeah, Glendale Boulevard, a-Boulevard
Glendale Boulevard is where I'm at
It's where I'm at, where I live

Off tracks that I kick, come on and give it up
'Cause I get funky like diaper rash
And you know I'm mad spunky and I'm making cash
I've got sex rhymes like Victoria's got secrets
To all you porn peepers who are trying to peep this
I'm like Al Goldstein, I'm all about screwing
Lead my team to sixty wins like my man Pat Ewing
Like getting shot out the barrel of a wave
Like virgin pow on the peaks of a.k.
Like a sound that to the depths of the soul
Well that's the feeling that I make my goal


A little wine with my dinner so I'm in my grape ape
I feel like a winner when I make a mix tape
Because I get ill when I'm on the pause button
And I get my fill and you can't say nothing
More soul on this train then Don Cornelius
Got the mad subwoofer pumping bass for your anus
Just getting on the mic at the monthly function
Wires hitting switches connecting at the junction

Spend all your money on your health insurance plan

I went and took a sledgehammer and I broke my nine
Because my life is mine, word is bond I rhyme
And every day I write the book down line by line
I'm feeling good when I do it like this
So come on and turn it up because you can't resist

Because I'm back with another track in which you lack
'Cause things is wack and that's a fact
Because I'm on time, you're shouting rewind
You know it's Adrock that's blowing your mind
My shit is rough and you know it is (so damn tough!)

I'm getting intense, not talking nonsense
I made up my mind, not sitting on the fence
I don't always know the right from the wrong
Do my best to figure it out and work it out in the long
I try to do a lot, more than I can chew
I balance out my ambitions what I got to do

Check it, better believe it y'all
Check it, better believe it y'all
This is rough and tough

'Cause you hide in broad day light, a parasite
A hypocrite, you take a peek quick
You turn your nose up (what), you think you're high up
You play it real safe and now your shit's fake
I seen you hawking and then you clock my style
And then you try to play it off like you think you're wild

D.I.Y., that means do it yourself
I don't sit around waitin' for someone's help
I don't sit back and say ""Good enough""
I keep on striving, reinventing, keepin' it off the cuff
So I kick the level up cahoot-ified
Mackadocius vibes, positively fortified

I'm throwing rhymes down, kickin' them downtown
Traveling high speed through the underground
I kick it freestyle, make it worth your while
I've got shelves of rhymes that I keep on file
I'm feeling good now, back home again
Well, New York City is the city that I feel at home in
A blast from the Grasshoff, awhile it's been
Stepping into the future again

Uh, and now I'm straight from eighty-eight
To ninety-three, to ninety-four, I'm out the door

Step into the party with the Fila fresh gear
People looking at me like I was David Koresh here

Kicking rhymes from the heart cause that's where I'm at
Fuck the bullshit, be it far from me to pop that

In the search for truth, I go a lot of ways
There's not a lot of peace that I find these days
I try to stay cool, I try to stay calm
But my life is getting hectic like a smoke bomb
So I'll say it like the group Huggy Bear
There's a boy-girl revolution of which you should be aware

You can't dis me, it ain't worth it, B
You put yourself down and you don't even see
'Cause I don't play that, I know who I am
For a minute I didn't but now I'm back again
I'm feeling strong, see, trust myself, G
Well, I stopped smoking cheeba and that was part of the key

We, we, we've got fire, we need water
There ain't no water, so I guess I ought to

Beastie Boys,"I can hear the trumpets blowing screaming out the end of time
Look around and listen and you'll see every sign
The waters are polluted as the forests are cut down
Bombing and drilling deep below ground
Check the prophecies from around the world
And look around now as it all unfurls
Look into yourself and see what goes on
Get a feeling in your heart of the right from wrong
Because the mother earth needs to be respected
Been far from too long that she's been neglected
Race against race, such a foolish waste
It's like cutting off your nose to spit your face
And at the end of the wars, what was the cost
It's clear that the earth was the one who lost
We are one with her as she is one with us
It's unreal how she is treated so unjust
As our planet grows smaller each and every day
Everyone affecting everyone in every way
We're all citizens of the world community
All here together and we're searching for unity
Over the years, I've grown and changed so much
Things I know now years ago, I couldn't touch
There are things I've done that I wouldn't do again
But I'm glad that I did 'cause I've learned from them
I just try to stay present right here, right now
No worries, no fears and without any doubts
It's about time

'Cause in these times, these changing times
A transition is occurring and I am not blind
As the pendulum swings a new age we enter
And with every swing, it draws closer to the center
Yes the storm before the calm and the wars that lead to love
Things must run their course so we push and we shove
But we're here to work it out in one way or another
To find a mutual respect for ourselves and one another
And the true key is a trust in self
For when I trust myself, I fear no one else
I took control of my life, just as anyone can
I want everyone to see it's in the palm of your hand
The past is gone, the future yet unborn
But right here and now is where it all goes on
I know we can fix it and it's not too late
I give respect to king and his nonviolent ways
I dream and I hope and I won't forget
Someday I'm going to visit on a free tibet
Someday I'm going to see us all joined as one
And it would be too bad to blow it up before we're done
'Cause we long behind the rage learning from the pain
The love behind the tension like the sun behind the rain
I'm sending loving light to all that is
To all creation and the life we live

Up the crack of dawn I'm on my way
We're talking two foot dump and there'll be no delay
'Cause I'm gone, the shit's getting out of hand
I'm changing my middle name to first Trem
I'm walking on the rhythm like Philippe Petite
I've got hole in my mouth where my teeth should be
You ask whatever happenened to the rappin' duke
I heard the Captain's gonna sign him to Jive and that's the truth
taking care of my functions still smokin, up the shrubery
I stopped eating chicken 'cause the shit was too rubbery
Produce organic from my own yard
Only the freshest herbs and growing's not too hard

Dreaming on it, screaming on it, ready to get dumb
Waking up my long joint, ready to get some
Looking at my board and my old boots
Seeing a waist deep champagne moment of truth
And on the court I've got game like my brother Matt
I give a shout out so where you at
But don't get souped Mathew 'cause I'm a take ya
Horatio Park right now and I'm a shake ya
Give me the fresh count 'cause you know that I'm stressed out 
I need some inspiration so get the best out

Writing the fresh rhyme, having the best time

Not a worry in mind as the friends around
A shout out to Linda riding pow forever
Well the Bird is the word and you're as light as a feather

Well I smoke a bag of rat weed 'cause I don't care

I like the boomin' grannies in big old panties
I'm giving, it to grandma making her crazy

You blew yourself up in the back of the six train
Take my advice at any price a gorilla like your mother is mighty weak
Sucking down pints until I didn't know
Woke up in the morning with a one-ton ho
'Cause I announce I like girls that bounce
With the weight that pays about a pound per ounce
Girls with curls and big long locks
And beatnik chicks just wearing their smocks
Walking high and mighty like she's number one
(She thinks she's the passionate one)

Beastie Boys,"Now here's a little story I've got to tell
About three bad brothers you know so well
It started way back in history
With Adrock, (M.C.A.) and me (Mike D.)
I had a little horse named Paul Revere
Just me and my horsy and a quart of beer
Riding across the land kicking up sand
Sheriff's posse on my tail 'cause I'm in demand
One lonely Beastie I be
All by myself without nobody
The sun is beating down on my baseball hat
The air is gettin' hot the beer is getting flat
Lookin' for a girl I ran into a guy
His name is M.C.A., I said, ""Howdy"" he said, ""Hi""

He told a little story that sounded well rehearsed
Four days on the run and that he's dying of thirst
The brew was in my hand and he was on my tip
His voice was hoarse, his throat was dry and he asked me for a sip
He said, ""Can I get some?""
I said, you can't get none!
Had a chance to run
He pulled out his shotgun
He was quick on the draw, I thought I'd be dead
He put the gun to my head and this is what he said,

""Now my name is M.C.A., I've got a license to kill
I think you know what time it is, it's time to get ill
Now what do we have here an outlaw and his beer
I run this land, you understand, I make myself clear.""
We stepped into the wind - he had a gun, I had a grin
You think this story's over but it's ready to begin

""Now I got the gun, you got the brew
You got two choices of what you can do
It's not a tough decision as you can see
I can blow you away or you can ride with me""
I said, I'll ride with you if can get me to the border
The sheriff's after me for what I did to his daughter
I did it like this, I did it like that
I did it with a whiffleball bat
So I'm on the run, the cop's got my gun
And right about now it's time to have some fun
The King Adrock that is my name
And I know the fly spot where they got the champagne.""
We rode for six hours the we hit the spot
The beat was a bumping and the girlies was hot
This dude was staring like he knows who we are
We took the empty spot next to him at the bar
M.C.A. Said, (Yo, you know this kid?)
I said, I didn't, but I know he did
(The kid said) Get ready cause this ain't funny
My name's Mike D. And I'm about to get money.
Pulled out the jammy, aimed it at the sky
He yelled, (Stick 'em up!) and let two fly
Hands went up and people hit the floor
He wasted two kids that ran for the door
""I'm Mike D. And I get respect
Your cash and your jewelry is what I expect""
M.C.A. Was with it and he's my ace
So I grabbed the piano player and I punched him in the face
The piano player's out the music stopped
His boy had beef and he got dropped
Mike D. Grabbed the money (M.C.A. Snatched the gold)
I grabbed two girlies and a beer that's cold.",Paul Revere,1997

Is push and pull the way it's got to be?

Beastie Boys,"Words comin' forth like water from the tap
Clap tracks line the spaces places papers people stack
Back track through the minutes when the thoughts went insane
I pulled the picture off the cover and blew out the mind games
People say this is the play list of the void non-bound
But I can say this is the plainness of the peace I've found
It's not the sorrow or the pity that we hope to dismantle
It's the cast of past dice lighting both ends of the candles
Scandelescent in the means I have dreamed on the schemes
Reunited in the times of such picturesque scenes
Can I get a witness to testify?
Open your eyes, realize, electrify

So I plan and I scam and write it off on my taxes
It's times like these I'll just go with the decisions of the masses
And to the crowds who've come before with their profit massing ways
To the greed that fucked it up and brought it down to today
With pain I stand sane and remain holding strong
Whilst all around me those who clowned me are now drowning by the throngs
It's illogical the actions that are typically displayed
A set back ain't all that much problem to invade
So I will glow like a lantern on a new moon night
I'll fight violence with these hands that weren't built to fight
But like a furnace burning coal my goals are bound to burn in flames
Whether achieved or dismantled by the agendas displayed
Can I get a witness to testify?
Open your eyes, realize, electrify",Electrify,1998
Beastie Boys,"I'm flowing prose to cons and cons to pros
I'm scheming rhyme against reason like it was flow against know
But beyond the concepts and emotions that rise
To the interconnectedness that underlies
The lies upon lies have lost their meaning
The plies upon plies of consciousness that is being
Over and over I fall I learned to walk from a crawl
It's not sad it's just the way and the purpose of it all

Now every word that you heard that I said that you felt
Was put in place in the space as they were shuffled and dealt
I steal feels from reels but I pay my respects
Paying compliments and disses and deciphering affects
Words are water as I court her, as she is pristine
Words and mics fall to dust and all that's left is the feelings
I give in and I win I try to never complain
Intentions venture to center and then they set the stage
But I'll remain sane making gain without pain
Staining trains with names and driving lanes to the refrain
And keep it positive as pains taking as it is
I'll never turn back cause that's the way I've got to live
I'll never turn back cause that's the way I've got to live
I'll never turn back cause that's the way I've got to live

So like a cloud carries rain I'm gonna carry my rhyme
Coming like thunder with lightning timing
No hesitation in gestation of thoughts and plans
Ferment time like wine no ploys or scams
Like the islands dot the oceans in the endless seas
Ideas coming to me in answer to my pleas
Woke up this morning right out of a dream
Reached for my pen and pad because my mind was on a rhyme scheme
What can I do with these bones and flesh?
With these animated thoughts in a world repressed?
I'm going down like the rhythms on the winds of change
I'm keeping calm under pressure like a deep-sea range
I'm flowing prose to cons and cons to pros
I'm like Toucan Sam when I follow my nose
I'm giving shouts to Gandhi, Garvey and King
His Holiness and all enlightened beings
I'll be the one who screams it on the microphone
I'll be the one who brings it inside your home

Got schemes, schematics blue prints on file
You gotta have dreams to make it all worthwhile
So as I take my time and realign
I wonder what it is I hope to find
I don't mean to brag I don't mean to boast
But I'm intercontinental when I eat French toast
Adrock with the new addition edition
Gettin' on down for the year 2000
A slight distraction can get you paid
And when it comes to that type shit I paved the way

BBoys to the early morn
BGirls be rockin on and on
BGirls to the break of dawn
BBoys be rockin on and on

Dogs love me cause I'm crazy sniffable
I bet you never knew I got the ill peripheral
In your home I'm cloned I'm on your headphones
I love it when you spazz out all alone
Cause I'm that fool that broke the key
I'm unlockable so don't check me
I got weight on my shoulders and things on my mind
The sky is falling and I'm falling behind
So I synthesize sounds as I patch my brain
Insane mind games move quick like flames
So now I wonder how sometimes you never know
Who be rockin y'all in ster-er-eo?
In ster-er-eo!
In ster-er-eo!
In stereo...

No time like the present to work shit out
That's what I'm going on and on and on about
Not fakin' just makin' beats in the dungeon
Keep that shit funky cause the odor is pungent
No shame in my game just par for the path
I try to hone my craft because at hands the task
But I find I'm not playing with a full deck
I'm up to my neck like Toulouse Latrec
All I want to know is when is checkout time
So I could be in heaven with the rhythm rock rhyme
And when I'm with my man Shadi rock at the gates
We'll be rockin' rhythms over disco breaks

BBoys to the early morn
BGirls be rockin on and on
BGirls to the break of dawn
BBoys be rockin on and on

On and on...on and on...",The Move,1998
Beastie Boys,"Something on the windowsill
Caught her eye and held her still
The cars pass by outside
Nowhere left to hide

Picture this now crystal clear
Nothing left to hold her here
And creeping up meanwhile
Traces of a smile

Something on the windowsill
Caught her eye and held her still
The cars pass by outside
Here I go flying
Open wide to see if I could fly

Beastie Boys,"Beastie Beastie Beastie Beastie Boys gettin' live on the spot
Puttin' all kinds of shame in the game you got
We keep the party movin' to the broad day light
G-E-T-L-I-V-E alright

Trans-hypnotic robotic can't stop it
No limits to this style you know you can't lock it
First you mock it, rock it and then you stock it
But I've got the styles that are always in the pocket
Like a bird floating down on a New York breeze
Every thought in the mind is a planted seed
So watch the mind or the thoughts will stack
Before you know it they're boomeranging on back
Well I'm the king of Boogle there is none higher
I get eleven points off the word 'quagmire'
Fools can't see me and that's how it is
And that's how I like it and that's my biz

Beastie Beastie Boys gettin' live on the spot
Puttin' all kinds of shame in the game you got
We keep the party movin' to the broad day light
G-E-T-L-I-V-E alright

Time's an illusion as the moments race by
Too fast to really grasp though we may try
Deny, till we die, ooh my my
These thoughts that mislead and then multiply
Second by second and minute by minute
""It's like lotto you gotta be"" ""in it to win it""
Shakin' mind breakin' on their own demise
Lies tax to the max and they'll be feelin' those vibes
So tell me what you need that you have got
Fiending on power will make your blood clot
It starts with the greed and then goes all wrong
That's why we can't all just get along
We're all connected like a Lego set
One equaling one together like a croquette
Whether we have or have not yet met
Well, it ain't no thing and it ain't no sweat

Puttin' all kinds of shame in the game you got
We keep the party movin' to the broad day light
G-E-T-L-I-V-E alright

You're caught in a panic and it's rattled your brain
The selfish ways just can't maintain
But these are the breaks when you try and come fake
Don't come with the rhymes that you just half baked
Well I'm the Benihana chef on the SP12
I chop the fuck out the beats left on the shelf
You be like 'Hello Nasty, where you been?'
It's time you brought the grimy beats out the dungeon
I jumped outside the house with my Walkman on
I get so hyped when I hear this song
It's gonna keep me happy like all day long
So go and talk shit cause it just makes me strong
Don't grease my palms with your filthy cash
Multinationals spreading like a rash
I might stick around or I might be a fad
But I won't sell my songs for no TV ad

Beastie Boys,"Well, Things get hectic quick
From the satellite dish to your joy stick
It's the night of the living cable box
Wires coming up from around the block
Remote control to change the station
But that won't change your situation
Have you seen what I mean
I'm the little gnome that's in your dreams
So I say this rhyme built by design
To take you beyond space and time
Said who is the man making diamonds out of coal
The man pushing buttons on remote control

Re-mote, control
Remote control

Until your back's up against the wall
You never know yourself that much at all
So you've got to share your love with a friend
That's all that you've got left in the end
Living in this city of pure confusion
People mislead by their own illusion
All this action, no satisfaction
We're all linked together like a chain reaction
Play or fold, love is bold
What is the future that will unfold?
Some like it hot, others like it cold
But we all want to hold the remote control

Re-mote, control
Re-mote, control
Re-mote, control
Re-mote, control

Things get hectic quick
All of the sudden I'm in the thick
Too much drama all around
Distractions booming in sensurround
Like a rainy day's Earth won't sit still
Sliding on down a hill
Sometimes life seems to stall
But never be ungrateful y'all

So watch your back when he takes the stage
Or he'll send you off on a naked rampage

This is for the people all around the nations
I got books with hooks and it looks like rain
Would someone on the Knicks please drive the lane?

If you got bad breath then maybe try Scope
And if you wash your ass you best use soap

We got to get together and harmonize
I feel I'm comin down with the bugallo flu
""Explain to me really what doctors must do, I said...""

I don't like to fight, I don't carry a piece
I wear permanent press so I'm always creased

Do it like this for the intergalaction
I practice asana daily so I'm very flexible
I'm a Scorpio so you know I'm very sexual

In money makin' it's how we do
I be smokin' roaches in the vestibule
In the next millennium I'll still be old school

Fifty cups of coffee and you know it's on
I move the crowd to the break of break of dawn
Can't rock the house without the party people

There's no better or worse between you and me
But I rock the mic so viciously
Like pins and needles and words that sting
At the blink of an eye I will do my thing
It's like a needle in the cartridge when the record spins
Like diggin' down deep in the record bins
Everybody gettin' down make no mistake
Nothing sounds quite like an eight-oh-eight

We got rhyme selections in a wide array
J'ai des bons bons pour vous mangez
The party people scream oui oui, see'est vrai
'Cause I got a remote for my bidet

(Adrock)
A-d-are-o-see-k
I use the microphone like Picasso used clay
Down with freckles from around the way
Peace to Bambata and Jazzy Jay

(MCA)
I rock on the mic from here to Bombay
I give it my best and say come what may
'Cause everybody's got their dues to pay
I'm looking side ways like my man Pele

(Mike D)
Getting on like Ali boom ba yay
So fed up with racism today
Time to speak up and not turn away
Make the sun shine when it's cloudy and gray

(chorus)
Dip dip dive so socialize
Open up your ears and clean out your eyes
If you learn to love your in for a surprise
It could be nice to be alive

(Adrock)
I'm taking doody rhymes to a brand new height
I shine on the mic like UltraBright
Created a monster with these rhymes I write
Goatee metal rap please say goodnight

(MCA)
Now here's a little something you may not like
My dj's name is Mix Master Mike
It's a real pity that you people got to bite
But I could understand because he sounds so nice

(Mike D)
Reading you the news cause I'm Country Mike
Use a microphone like Shazam uses tights
Try to keep clear of that hate and spite
So I keep my mind still like the still of night

(Adrock)
Now who in the world do you want to fight?
It's agianst the system we should unite
Homophobics ain't alright
If you learn to love then you might love life

(chorus)

(MCA)
Now you can shuffle numbers but facts is facts
So many billionares while so many lack
So before the poor decide to react
Come on party people and share up your stacks

(Mike D)
Now I'm a break it down to the brass tacks
Do the Biz Mark and the cabbage patch
You try to turn the key but then you broke the latch
Sneak into my files for some rhymes to snatch

(Adrock)
I'd like to have a say on the income tax 
Don't want to help build bombs and that's the facts
No money for health care so what's the catch?
The man got you locked with the keys to the latch

(MCA)
Mike and Adam have got my back
You bring the mics and we'll bring the raps
Turn on the P.A. and rock your shack
Don't smoke cheeba can't stand crack

 Said I love ya won't leave ya so you got to listen 
 See I'm talkin' about the way that I'm feeling 
 You're so lovely lengthy and so appealing 
 A sassy sophisticated sexy lady 
 Well I'm 26 and you're 80 
 The clock is ticking so you better not front 
 We can go downtown and we could smoke some blunt 
 Well you're a lovely girlgolden girl, just like Bea Arthur
 Just turn down the lights so we can go farther 

 Boomin' granny, boomin' granny 
 Boomin' granny, good and plenty 

 Because I saw ya at the check out line 
 You dropped your coupons and you were looking fine 
 Sophisticated, and so mature 
 I couldn't really care if you're 50 or 74 
 Because I want ya, and I need ya 
 Hey boomin' granny you could be my teacher 
 And I could be your pet, bet 
 Listen old lady I'm gonna make ya sweat! 
 I know I'm younger, and your much older 
 You look so nice on my Chevy Nova 
 I'm gonna take her to the low rider show, and flaunt ya 
 I gotta tell ya lady I said I want ya, boomin' granny 
 
 Because I need you boomin' granny 
 Boomin' granny, boomin' fanny

There never was a city kid truer and bluer
There's more to me than you'll ever know
And I've got more hits than Sadaharu Oh
Tom Thumb, Tom Cushman or Tom Foolery
I date women on T.V. with the help of Chuck Woolery
Words are flowing out just like the Grand Canyon
And I'm always out looking for a female companion
I threw the lasso around the tallest one and dragged her to the crib
I took off her moccasins and put on my bib
Wheelin' and dealin' I make a little bit of stealing
I'll bring her back to the place and your dress I'm peeling
Your body's on time and your mind is appealing
Staring at the cracks up there up on the ceiling
Such and such'll be the bass that I'm throwing
I'm talking to the girl telling her I'm all-knowing
She's talking to the kid (who?) to the kid, to the kid
I'm telling her every lie that you know that I never did
Hey ladies, get funky

All the ladies in the house
The ladies, the ladies

Well, me in the corner with a good looking daughter
I dropped my drawers, said welcome back Kotter
We was cutting up the rug, she started cutting up the carpet
In my apartment, I begged her, please stop it
The gift of gab is the gift that I have
And that girl ain't nothing but a crab
Educated no, stupid yep
And when I say stupid, I mean stupid fresh
I'm not James at fifteen or Chachi in charge
I'm Adam and I'm adamant about living large
With the white sassoons and the looks that kill
Makin' love in the back of my Coupe De Ville
I met a little cutie she was all hopped up on zootie
I liked the little cutie but I kicked her in the bootie
'Cause I don't kinda go for that messin' around
You be listening to my records' a number one sound
Just step to the rhythm, step, step to the ride
I've got an open mind so why don't you all get inside?

Ladies flock like bees to a hive
Hey ladies, get funky

Hey, hey, hey, hey ladies (girls, girls)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, ladies
One more time, ain't it funky now?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey ladies
(Ain't it funky now?) well, you know that

She got a gold tooth you know she's hardcore
She'll show you a good time then she'll show you the door
Break up with your girl it ended in tears
Vincent Van Gogh go and mail that ear
Call her in the middle of the night when I'm drinking
The phone booth on the corner is damp and it's stinking
Said come on over it was me that she missed
I threw that trash can through her window 'cause you know I got dissed
Your old lady left you and you went insane
You blew yourself up in the back of the six train
Take my advice at any price a gorilla like your mother is mighty weak
Sucking down pints until I didn't know
Woke up in the morning with a one-ton ho
'Cause I announce I like girls that bounce
With the weight that pays about a pound per ounce
Girls with curls and big long locks
And beatnik chicks just wearing their smocks
Walking high and mighty like she's number one
(She thinks she's the passionate one)

I love it when you hit those switches

It'll spin you around and throw you in a hex
Until you feel no pain inside your brain
All your worries are soothed by the sound effects

Don't let me begin about heroin
Living six feet deep just ain't the move

America was young, but she was a-growing

And one day Johnny finally got a reply

Beastie Boys,"Now here's a little story - I've got to tell
About three bad brothers - you know so well
It started way back in history
With Adrock, M.C.A., and me - Mike D.
I had a little horse named Paul Revere
Just me and my horsy and a quart of beer
Riding across the land - kicking up sand
Sheriff's posse on my tail cause I'm in demand
One lonely Beastie I be
All by myself - without nobody
The sun is beating down on my baseball hat
The air is gettin' hot - the beer is getting flat
Lookin' for a girl - I ran into a guy
His name is M.C.A., I said, ""Howdy"" - he said, ""Hi""

He told a little story - that sounded well rehearsed
Four days on the run and that he's dying of thirst
The brew was in my hand - and he was on my tip
His voice was hoarse, his throat was dry - he asked me for a sip
He said, ""Can I get some?""
I said, ""You can't get none!""
Had a chance to run
He pulled out his shotgun
He was quick on the draw - I thought I'd be dead
He put the gun to my head and this is what he said,

""Now my name is M.C.A. - I've got a license to kill
I think you know what time it is - it's time to get ill
Now what do we have here - an outlaw and his beer
I run this land, you understand - I make myself clear.""
We stepped into the wind - he had a gun, I had a grin
You think this story's over but it's ready to begin

""Now I got the gun - you got the brew
You got two choices of what you can do
It's not a tough decision as you can see
I can blow you away or you can ride with me"" I said, I'll ride with you if 
You can get me to the border
The sheriff's after me for what I did to his daughter
I did it like this - I did it like that
I did it with a whiffleball bat
So I'm on the run - the cop's got my gun
And right about now - it's time to have some fun
The King Adrock - that is my name
And I know the fly spot where they got the champagne.""
We rode for six hours the we hit the spot
The beat was a bumping and the girlies was hot
This dude was staring like he knows who we are
We took the empty spot next to him at the bar
M.C.A. said, ""Yo, you know this kid?""
I said, ""I didn't."" - but I know he did
The kid said, ""Get ready cause this ain't funny
My name's Mike D. and I'm about to get money.""
Pulled out the jammy - aimed it at the sky
He yelled, ""Stick 'em up!"" - and let two fly
Hands went up and people hit the floor
He wasted two kids that ran for the door
""I'm Mike D. and I get respect
Your cash and your jewelry is what I expect""
M.C.A. was with it and he's my ace
So I grabbed the piano player and I punched him in the face
The piano player's out - the music stopped
His boy had beef - and he got dropped
Mike D. grabbed the money - M.C.A. snatched the gold
I grabbed two girlies and a beer that's cold.",Paul Revere [Beat],1999

With the ill boat you've never seen before
Glidin' in the glades

Let your back bone flip but don't slip a disc
Let your spine unwind just take a risk
I wanna do the freak until the break of dawn
Tell me party people is that so wrong

Like Roy Cormier with the coconut lotion
The sound of the music drivin' you insane
You can't explain to people this type of mind frame

Packed like sardines in the tin

And if you ask me turn up the bass
And if you play defender I could be your hyper space

With the sound delight, we rock all night
And yes, we're gonna party for the right to fight

Rock the mic from Munich out to Taipei
Still around the way is where we'll stay
Say what we mean, mean what we say
Trajectories from the past are taking their toll and
What we do now is future molding
Columbine bowling, childhood stolen
We need a bit more gun controlling

Be (be) fore (fore) it's too far gone
We gotta work together, it's been too long

When I get on you scream ""Hoo, tight!""
Rockin' this flow I could go all night
I'm not here to fight, or incite
I'm like the beach in the Bahamas make you feel alright
I'm getting kind of tired of the situation
The US attacking other nations
Anhiliations, on every station
False election's got me losing my patience
Well, I'm a funky-ass Jew and I'm on my way, and
I got to say fuck the KKK, and

I went to get a loan and they asked my race
I wrote down human inside the space
It's a disgrace how they try to debase
It ain't the bank's damn business how my lineage trace
Now let me drop a verse that's terse and concise
I'm an iron chef when I slice and dice
With the rhyme precise, the word is nice
So please pass me the Reunite on ice
Well let's go to work and not berserk
'Cause when the time comes the body goes to dirt
Try to smooth it out like Levert
Keep the mind alert and not revert

I can't stop, y'all, 'till' the early morn'
So rock-rock, y'all, tick-tock y'all, to the beat, y'all
To the beat, y'all, c'mon and rock, y'all

I give thanks for inspiration, it guides my mind along the way
A lot of people get jealous, they're talking about me
But that's just 'cause they haven't got a thing to say

Well, everybody rapping like it's a commercial
Actin' like life is a big commercial
So this is what I've got to say to you all
Be true to yourself and you will never fall
And now I'd like to pass the mic to the A

(So what's your name, yauch?) my name is M.C.A
I've been coming to where I am from the get-go
Find that I can groove with the beat when I let go
So put your worries on hold
Get up and groove with the rhythm in your soul
And now I'd like to pass the mic
To my brother Adrock, c'mon and shine like a light

I'm always on time, nevertheless, y'all

Too many rappers, and there's still not enough MCs
It goes three (three), two (two), one (one)
MCA, Adrock, Mike D, that's how we get it done
Like ladies and gents, attention
Nas in the house with Beastie Boys
We can turn it out
Perpetrators, we can point 'em out
So if you got somethin' on your mind, let it out

Yo, I been in the game since before you was born
I might still be MCing even after you're gone
Strange thought, I know, but my skills still grow
The 80s, the 90s, 2000s, and so
On and on until the crack of dawn
Until the year 3000 and beyond
Stay up all night, and I MC and never die
Cause death is the cousin of sleep

Because I'm back with a bang, boogie, oogie-oogie
Strawberry Letter 23 like Shuggie
Oh my God, just look at me
Grandpa been rappin' since '83
I'm supersonic like J.J. Fad
Got crazy-ass shit pullin' out the bag
Don't forget the tartar sauce, yo, cause it's sad
All these crab rappers, they're rappin' like crabs

I have carte blanche, the vagabond
Nas is the narcissist, my pockets are rotund
I'm no killa, but compared to you, I'm more real'a
You ain't a shot, a mobster, or a drug dealer
A slug peeler, you're not
Mafioso, no
You ain't got the cut-throat in ya, beginner
I ain't tryin' to hear your racket
You work with police, dog, you snitch, you rat
You wear that jacket

Gimme eight bars, and watch me bless this
I start to reminisce, ooh, when I miss
The real hip hop with which I persist
Like rum in mojitos

To blow you bullshit rappers straight out the frame
My lyrics spin 'round like a hurricane twister
So get your hologram on off-a Wolf Blitzer
Too many rappers to shake a stick at
I oughta charge a tax for every weak rap I had to listen to
Cause we be makin' stacks like Stax Records
My squad, we gotta pact -- we're never coming wack

To all you crab rappers and hackers
And circuit benders tweaked on Splenda
I take the cake, I stole the mold
The golden microphone, well, that's mine to hold
And why all these biters all up in my crotchspace?
Sniffin', buffin', huffin'
And mean muggin' with a Blimpie Bluffin
Back up off me, suckas, you ain't sayin' nothin'

I'm broader than Broadway, I was the project hallway
Dual tape recorder, lacin' oratorials all day
I'm just getting started on this beat, this is foreplay
And when this song's finished, y'all can sing along with this
By the way, I have a strong fetish for Christian Louboutin steppers
I hear Russian blonde's the wettest
But anyway, I better pay homage to my fellas
And that's what's on my mind and the rhyme, who's next up?

Mike D, the man of mystery
History in the makin', and now we're takin'
Titles, awards, and accolades
Scarin' the competition as I sharpen my blades
We come together like peanut butter and sandwiches
Like pen and paper, like Picasso and canvases
Rockin' stadiums and shitty bars

Jump out of the window onto a parade balloon
My style is iller that the goblins in ""Troll 2""
'Cause I'm the type of MC with the most pizazz
You're trying to borrow my book like I was Grandmaster Caz
Got rhymes about antihistamines and analgesics
Rhyme about expectorants, you no see it
Sueth sayer not a play rhyme sayer extreme
Burn like fire when I step on the scene
I've got shark's teeth so I can bite your head
I've got tiger's claws that'll scratch you dead
I've got wings like a dragon when I'm flying above
Shoot venom from my eyes when it's time to get rough
So step back, and check yourself
This MC's got weapons that'll ruin your health
So if you're feeling strong then reach for yours
My book is my shield and my mic is my sword

Long burn the fire the truth shall set you free
Long burn the fire the truth shall set you free
Long burn the fire the truth shall set you free
Long burn the fire the truth shall set you free

Now it's Adrock rappin' I'm back again
Like a Big Mac attack on your gut and that's wack my friend
I'm a maxer relaxer and I'm chillin'
I take that shit serious like Jerome to grillin'
I burn you to a crisp sucker back up off the toaster
I make you sick like at Kenny Roger's Roaster
See this rap thing is all about the bragadocia
I check my rear view MC""s ain't gettin' closer
People think I'm slow 'cause I'm just I'm underchallenged
See me you're like ""Man, that's remarkable talent""
Live round the clock like disco donut
I'm like a tailor 'cause I got the thing sewn up
Or a proctologist I move asses
Got so much heat that I fog your Mom's glasses
Proof is in the pudding and the pudding's in my pants
You heard me rap and now watch me dance

Long burn the fire the truth shall set you free
Long burn the fire the truth shall set you free

Save the date for when they hoist our number to the rafters
Above the haters you can hear our laughter
Like Willis Reed or Elton John
We done been in the game and our game's still on
It's not Tic Tac Toe or Operation
Just holding it down like the gravitation
To all the heads that said ""No can do""
Adrock's in the bath filled with chocolate fondue
Straight up nuts like my name is Mike Bassini
Bonafide household name like Sergio Tacchini
""Wasn't we here back on Raising Hell?""
Running wild like rats in the Taco Bell
On the mic I spit, the match it's lit

Back on the mic is the anti-depressor
Ad-Rock, the pressure, yes, we need this
The best is yet to come, and yes, believe this

Leggo my Eggo while I flex my ego
Sip off my 'secco, dressed up tuxedo
Sipping coffee, playing Keno in the casino
Want a lucky number, ask Mike Dino

I burn the competition like a flamethrower
My rhymes age like wine as I get older
I'm getting bolder, competition is waning
I got the feeling and assume the lane and

We got a party on the left, a party on the right
We gonna party for the motherfucking right to fight
Make some noise if you're with me
Make some noise if you're with me

Armed insurrection, popular election
Get paid every year like tax collection
Hear my perfection, rotary connection
Taking MC's down by lethal rap injection

I'm like an ornithologist when I get pissed
You must have drank a fizzy-lifting drink and you got lifted
And sifted, I'm just whiffed
And when I catch MCs it's time for wing-clipping

I fly like a hawk, or better yet an eagle
A seagull, I sniff suckers out like a beagle
My ego is off and running and gone
'Cause I'm about the best and if you diss than that's wrong

We got a party on the left, a party on the right
We gonna party for the motherfucking right to fight
Make some noise if you're with me
Make some noise if you're with me

Pass me the scalpel, I'll make an incision
I'll cut off the part of your brain that does the bitching
Put it in formaldehyde and put it in the shelf
And you can show it to your friends and say ""that's my old self""

Can't do me nothing, can't tell me nada
Don't quote me now because I'm doing the lambada
The forbidden dance, here's my chance
To make romance in my B-boy stance

Parlay romancing into financing
Opened up a restaurant with Ted Danson
The roaches checked in, but they never checked out
I set the record straight no doubt

Well if you're feeling good and you're feeling right
Somebody step up and grab the mic
Now hello everybody and how you been
It's Adrock rappin' on the microphone again
I got grace class style finesse and debonair
Murdalize motherfuckers 'cause I just don't care

Because I'm back on a roll got total control

Your style is cheap boy just like a dutch
You know you're not smokin' on the microphone much
There's a certain special talent that I never lack
Huh ha huh ha and that's a fact
'Cause we shine like the chrome on a Cadillac
You better break a wishbone 'cause we're never wack
Said we're never that and that is that
We're the non-stop disco power pack uh
That's right we go all night
Who gonna be next to bless the mic
Now this it the way we run it down
We getting you high on the funky sounds
This is the way we get it on
B-Boys in the house till the break of dawn
See I mix my style up like a cement mixer
Smooth and fix ya like a rhyme elixir
I said ""Yo sound man, make Mike's mic louder""
Don't make me sound cheap like a box of douche powder
I max and relax champagne mojito
Don't go commando don't know bandito
Je M'appelle Michel Perignon
Me and Claude in the chateau and we got it going on
Quincy's in the hot tub like it's '73
Looking over his shoulder and he's looking at me 
I'm all white in the face towel around my waist
What's up with that watch inside that glass case?
I got to make my move sneak out the place
Undetected not leaving a trace
Party's done microphones werecked
Wines been drunk and heads been checked
I see one last profitable and make my play
And pass the microphone to MCA
Non-stop, on the top, and you lock, when we rock
Never fakin', no mistakin', we be makin' hip-hop
So come on everybody get down, yeah
Now it's a spot check hit the deck count down
'Cause I'ma break it down for you how we run it down
Pound for pound keep the bass lines round
I seen you watchin' jockin' clockin' my sound
But for real I'm real glad I grew up in hip hop
Still got mad love for a record called ""beat bop""
It meant a lot spinning on my Walkman
Shout out to the African Bam
And to the S to the P the double O-N-Y
The one MC who you can't deny
I'd listen to the records and they'd inspire
Sit down to write and the pen breathes fire
Construct a rhyme with specific intent
Flowin' from and brain cells right through the pen
And then I put the book down grab a hold the mic
Words flowin' so cold turn water to ice
Come through the wire saturate the tape
You put me in the mix nice it up with the plate
And then they press it on wax sell it in the store
The DJ spin the record out on the dance floor
Comin' through the speakers to shake your eardrum
Brain cells get lit then you hear where we're comin' from
Well Adrock (huh) get it on
We gonna rock the house until the break of dawn

I came from the gutter now I'm gunnin' for top
Burnin' ya shop - my beats blowin' up when it drop
Independently I rock when spittin' game 
Remain gettin' change but the motto is still the same 
B.A. got the ultimate brains breakin' the chains
Ordained in the gospel of rap - preachin' the facts
I'm black - bearin' witness to that - Throw ya hands to the sky
My battle cry is high till the day that I day
I'm addicted to the rhyme 'cuz all the time I find
I'm rippin' lines and fuck that i'm goin' for mine
See I do it for the love - it ain't about the papes
The dollars that I make be the icing on the cake

Songs droppin' bombs on America's youth
Burnin' ya suit - Mash out the dollas and scoot
Droppin' it hot- but not sellin' out for tha loot

Now this is verse 2 let me keep shit clean
Hold up another minute you can see what I mean
Labels wanna play games its tha money that talk
I'm a bad muthafucka and I'm walkin' tha walk
Wanna promote this pop shit rap and rock shit
Fake thug rappin' on some fake as 'Pac shit
Shame how the mainstream lacks a brainstream
on each radio yo ya hearing the same thing
Say they wanna sign then they decline 
With lines that there ain't enough thug in tha rhyme 
What a crime when you gotta preach killin to sell
I rebel - yo ya fake A&R and advance can go to hell

See i tried tha shit before and i just couldn’t resist

glide in tha breeze you can feel tha flow

Get high (x2) 

business it always comes first 
when I'm through progressin’ with my works 
I got a dime and a date to go 
when we meet up she brings tha hydro 

Get high (x2) 

all got problems in our life 
don’t judge it’s gonna be alright 
this is a thing that you need to do 
get lost in tha beat just feel tha groove 

Get high (x3) 

music it is the answer 
for your bumps and bruise and cancers 
burn sumthin’ with me if you feel tha beat 
exhale tha smoke on american streets

Get high (x2)

Beate Bantai,"When we met we still had innocence
And we did things 'cause they made sense
Without trying hard I made it final
And we conceived our children on backseat vinyl
Though we didn't have a lot
(But) one was quickly bought
Then we buit upon this ground something we thought was sound
But in reality was silence
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
I only picked up your story knowing you were lying
Don't ask me for advice
You'll have to learn to help yourself
When I look back now I plainly see
The misery I'm sure you don't agree
And all the products of those peaceful years
The broken plates and glasses and the shouting hurt my ears
Sometimes I wish I was asleep
And you were just another sheep
And when we finally fell apart
You were left holding the cart
Though you thought I'd said I'd push it
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
I keep dropping those hints but they never touched the ground
I'm useless to you now
You'll have to learn yourself to help yourself
I had never planned on this being so complicated
You had never planned on us being so separated
The spiteful words will heal with time
Eventually they rhyme
You can forget but not forgive the fact that I still live
And never wanted you to give... in
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
You weren't satisfied I was only superhuman
Don't ask me for advice
You'll have to learn to help...
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
Well I could only stand sitting here so long
You don't need my help
You'll have to learn to help yourself

May I inquire discreetly, 
When are you free to take some tea with me.

Told her I would really like to see her again

A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah, ah

Follow her down to a bridge by the fountain
where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high.

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds 
And you're gone.

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes.",Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds,
Beatrice Egli,"Du schaust mich an und lässt mich leben
Du hast mich 1000 Mal entführt
Und ich werd' dich nie aufgeben
Ich hab es 1000 Mal gespürt
Ja der pure Glücksmoment
Wenn man willenlos verbrennt
Ein Gefühl ganz tief im Herzen
Das man wohl die Liebe nennt

Ich bin so verrückt
Verrückt nach dir
Mir egal was auch passiert
Stark genug für diesen Wahnsinn
Bleib doch immer immer hier

Ich bin so verrückt
Verrückt nach dir
1000 Feuer brenn`n in mir
Du und ich und das für immer
Denn das Größte das sind wir

Ich blick dir tief in deine Seele
Ich hab dich 1000 Mal durchschaut
Und wenn ich's zusammenzähle
Ich hab dir immer so vertraut
Ja die Liebe Knall auf Fall
Das ist nicht mehr normal
Ein Gefühl für jetzt und immer
Das ist Liebe pur total

Ich bin so verrückt
Verrückt nach dir
Mir egal was auch passiert
Stark genug für diesen Wahnsinn
Bleib doch immer immer hier

Ich bin so verrückt
Verrückt nach dir
1000 Feuer brenn`n in mir
Du und ich und das für immer
Denn das Größte das sind wir

Ich bin so verrückt
Verrückt nach dir
Mir egal was auch passiert
Stark genug für diesen Wahnsinn
Bleib doch immer immer hier

Ich bin so verrückt
Verrückt nach dir
Mir egal was auch passiert
Stark genug für diesen Wahnsinn
Bleib doch immer immer hier

Ich bin so verrückt
Verrückt nach dir
1000 Feuer brenn`n in mir
Du und ich und das für immer
Denn das Größte das sind wir

Ich bin so verrückt",Verrückt nach Dir,
Beatrice Egli,"Der Mond scheint hell am Himmel
Die Sterne leuchten hell
Die Nacht ist für uns zwei allein gemacht
Und mein Herz schlägt immer schneller
Und der Himmel wird schon Heller
Die Zeit steht still
Die Liebe ist entfacht

Diese Nacht hat 1000 Stunden
Und ich tanze nur mit dir
Hab heute Nacht mein Glück gefunden
Bleib doch heute Nacht bei mir

Wir drehen uns im Kreise
Und ich liege in deinem Arm
Der Mann im Mond schaut uns beim Tanzen zu
Hörst du die Engel singen
Wie sie im Wind erklingen
Das was ich will ist 1000 mal nur du

Diese Nacht hat 1000 Stunden
Und ich tanze nur mit dir
Hab heute Nacht mein Glück gefunden
Bleib doch heute Nacht bei mir

Ich schenke dir den Himmel
Ich fang' den Mond dir ein
Ich halt die Erde für dich an
Lass mich heute nicht alleine

Diese Nacht hat 1000 Stunden
Und ich tanze nur mit dir
Hab heute Nacht mein Glück gefunden
Bleib doch heute Nacht bei mir

Beatrice Egli,"Es ist alle früh, kurz nach Mitternacht
Ich geh heute aus, hab ich mir gedacht
Und mein Herz das sehnt, sehnt sich so nach Liebe
Plötzlich steht er da und sagt leise Hallo
Schaut mir in die Augen, ja ganz einfach so
Und ich spüre nur, diese Gefühle

1000 Fantasien durchlebe ich in meinen Gedanken
Es ist wie Magie, doch heute Nacht passiert es nie

Flieg, flieg, flieg nicht so nah ans Licht
Träume sie verbrennen, wenn ein Flügel bricht

Flieg, flieg, flieg nicht so nah ans Licht
Engel fallen tief, wenn ihr Herz zerbricht

Er nimmt meine Hand, mir wird kalt und heiß
In mir brennt ein Feuer doch ich weiß
Ich will einfach mehr, ich will wahre Gefühle
Dann der erste Kuss, draußen wird es schon hell
Ich bin wie verzaubert, doch das geht mir zu schnell
Und mein Herz es warnt mich vor diesen Gefühle

1000 Fantasien durchlebe ich in meinen Gedanken
Es ist wie Magie, doch heute Nacht passiert es nie

Flieg, flieg, flieg nicht so nah ans Licht
Träume sie verbrennen, wenn ein Flügel bricht

Flieg, flieg, flieg nicht so nah ans Licht
Engel fallen tief, wenn ihr Herz zerbricht

Flieg, flieg, flieg nicht so nah ans Licht
Träume sie verbrennen, wenn ein Flügel bricht

Flieg, flieg, flieg nicht so nah ans Licht
Engel fallen tief, wenn ihr Herz zerbricht

Engel fallen tief, wenn ihr Herz zerbricht",Flieg nicht so nah ans Licht,2013
Beatrice Egli,"Nein ich weine nicht um dich
Weil du mir mein Herz gerade herzlos brichst
Diese Träne im Gesicht das ist nur der Rauch vom Kerzenlicht
Ich denke an gestern
Ich lieg' seit Stunden wach
Ich möchte dich hassen
Doch werd' schon wieder schwach

Ist doch alles egal
Ich will alles nochmal
Ich will Liebe total
Ich habe gar keine Wahl
Wenn es den Teufel gibt
Soll er mich holen

Ist doch alles egal
Ich will liebe frontal
Hab heute keine Moral
Brauch den Krieg wieder mal
Und wenn es die Hölle gibt
Will ich in ihr schmoren
Ist doch alles egal

Du hast sie lang nicht mehr gesehen
Dein Hemd das riecht verdammt
Nach ihrem Parfum
Ich soll dich verstehen
Alles war halt nur so ausversehen
Und du sprichst von Liebe
Es tut dir höllisch leid
Ich schick dich zum Teufel
Verdammt ich werde schon wieder weich

Ist doch alles egal
Ich will alles nochmal
Ich will Liebe total
Ich habe gar keine Wahl
Wenn es den Teufel gibt
Soll er mich holen

Ist doch alles egal
Ich will liebe frontal
