Fool's Garden,"Cry baby cry,
Make your mother sigh.
She's old enough to know better,
So cry baby cry.

The king of Marigold was in the kitchen
Cooking breakfast for the queen.
The queen was in the parlor playing piano
For the children of the king.

Cry baby cry,
Make your mother sigh.
She's old enough to know better,
So cry baby cry.

The king was in the garden picking flowers
For a friend who came to play.
The queen was in the playroom painting pictures
For the children's holiday.

Cry baby cry,
Make your mother sigh.
She's old enough to know better,
So cry baby cry.

The duchess of Kilcardy always smiling
And arriving late for tea.
The duke was having problems with the message
At the local Bird and Bee.

Cry baby cry,
Make your mother sigh.
She's old enough to know better,
So cry baby cry.

At twelve o'clock a meeting 'round the table
For a sentence in the dark.
With voices out of nowhere put on specially
By the children for a lark.

Cry baby cry,
Make your mother sigh.
She's old enough to know better,
So cry baby cry.
Cry cry,
Make your mother sigh.
She's old enough to know better,
So cry baby cry.",Cry Baby Cry,2001
Fool's Garden,"Don´t be afraid, I'm not lonely,
I'm closer closer to my life.
Don't wait, I won't be lonely,
Closer closer to my life.

I've set it free, I feel the rain
Opens up my heart and washes away
Every single limit - time -
I start to breathe.
I'll leave it all behind, I'm on the way.

Don't be afraid, I'm not lonely,
I'm closer closer to my life.
Don't wait, I won't be lonely,
I'm closer closer to my life.
My mind's rolling like thunder,
I'm closer closer to my life.
I don't fear I'll go under,
I'm closer to my life, to my life.

I've set up sails I feel the wind
Opens up my mind and blows away
Every single reason to stay,
It's time to fly.
Don't you call my name. I'm on the way.

Don't be afraid, I'm not lonely,
I'm closer closer to my life.
Don't wait, I won't be lonely,
I'm closer closer to my life.
My mind's rolling like thunder,
I'm closer closer to my life.
I don´t fear to go under,
I'm closer closer to my life.

Can you feel, can you feel it.
I can feel the silence.
I can feel the silence.

Don't be afraid, I'm not lonely,
I'm closer closer to my life.
Don't wait, I won't be lonely,
I'm closer closer to my life.
My mind's rolling like thunder,
I'm closer closer to my life.
I don't fear I'll go under,
Closer...

Every single reason to stay closer,
It's time to fly. Closer.
I said I've set it tonight.
It's time to fly.

Closer closer to my life.
Closer closer to my life.

I said I've set it tonight
(closer closer to my life).
To my life
(closer closer to my life).
To my life.",Closer,2003
Fool's Garden,"Dreaming.
It's not that easy any more when you say,
Dreaming.
Why did you close the opened door while in there.
We've never been so near the light without you.
I'm only half the man inside, see me,
You're so much more to me than anyone.

Leaving.
Say, do you still believe to find by
Leaving
The light that you just left behind and drive in there.
The sky is dark and full of clouds without you.
There's nothing left to kill the doubts to be with you,
Was to be found and now I'm lost again.


Is it wrong? Is it right?
It don't matter if we come home tonight.
There's a light, let it in again.


Sorry,
I never meant to break your heart so
Sorry,
I didn't see the shining stars right in there.
Now I'm lost in all the storms without you,
So afraid I miss your warmth.
Forgive me.
Don't let me fall and take me home again.

Is it wrong? Is it right?
It don't matter if we come home tonight.
There's a light, let it in again.


It's so easy,
We only have to go inside,
So easy.
Try to make it.
We won't fail,
We'll see the light 'cause it's in there.


Is it wrong? Is it right?
It don't matter if we come home tonight.
There's a light, let it in,
Do begin.

Fool's Garden,"It's what you think, it's what it's like,
So many pieces remain tonight,
You've had it all and now you can't
Get up.

It's just the way the story goes,
The glass is cut and none of those
Who've licked your boots
Will help you now.
Get up.

She's run over the fields of glory,
Sha lah lah,
Cold rain is slapping
Across her face,
Sha lah lah.
She's run over the fields of glory,
Sha lah lah.
She's run away from the fields of love,
The fields of love.

Across your face.",Glory,2003
Fool's Garden,"Bye, bye -
It's the same old wind again that calls me
- bye, bye -
On an ordinary day.
Bye, bye -
Have you ever felt this lack of freedom
- bye, bye -
Have you ever felt this way.

Leave it, don't leave it - I have to leave,
I can't go on pretending.
Nothing is real, don't you feel
That every road is ending.
Don't ask why I have to leave you,
Don't you try, there have to be two.

We will never find a reason,
We will never find a way,
We will always run on empty,
We will always run away.

We will never find the answer
As long as we don't understand,
We can't walk this way together,
We cannot take each others hand.

I've said it all - holy eyes -
No more sweet surrender.
Forget it all - no more lies,
Soon we will remember that
Everything we tried to change
Stayed always and always and always
The same.

We will never find a reason,
We will never find a way,
We will always run on empty,
We will always run away.

We will never find the answer
As long as we don't understand,
We can't walk this way together,
We cannot take each others hand.

We will never find a reason,
We will never find a way,
We will always run on empty,
We cannot walk each other way.

We will never find the answer
As long as we don't understand
We can't walk this way together,
We cannot take each others hand.

There's a light inside the hollow,
There's a light behind the wall,
But we've got different lights to follow,
We have to fall, so let us fall.

I was afraid - I couldn't hear you,
I was ashamed but now I know
That we got different roads to follow,
That we got different ways to go.

We will never find a reason.
We will never find a reason.

We will never find a reason,
We will never find a way,
We will always run on empty,

Fool's Garden,"I'm sitting here in the boring room
It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon
I'm wasting my time
I got nothing to do
I'm hanging around
I'm waiting for you
But nothing ever happens and I wonder

I'm driving around in my car
I'm driving too fast
I'm driving too far
I'd like to change my point of view
I feel so lonely
I'm waiting for you
But nothing ever happens and I wonder

I wonder how
I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon-tree
I'm turning my head up and down
I'm turning turning turning turning turning around
And all that I can see is just another lemon-tree

I'm sitting here
I miss the power
I'd like to go out taking a shower
But there's a heavy cloud inside my head
I feel so tired
Put myself into bed
While nothing ever happens and I wonder

Isolation is not good for me
Isolation I don't want to sit on the lemon-tree

I'm steppin' around in the desert of joy
Baby anyhow I'll get another toy
And everything will happen and you wonder

I wonder how

Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
And all that I can see is just another lemon-tree

Foolproof,"I beg to bleed
And I'm so sorry but I just can't go on
The feeling's gone
I swam the tide capsized inside
And tonight she blows
Bombs away

It's gonna fall fall from the sky
It's gonna pour like hell tonight
And now I hear you say I'm gone today

She said to me
I'm so happy but she lost faith today
Stale and grey
I know you've tried so let me go inside
And tonight she blows
Bombs away

And it's gonna fall fall from the sky
It's gonna pour like hell tonight
And now I hear you say I'm gone today
You've passed through the final wall
You've come so close to end it all
And now I hear you say it's all okay

I can't
Can't let go of it
Wanna face the day to be a part of it
Stand back for the rewind
I'll see you face to face for the last time
Bombs away

Fall, fall from the sky
Burn like hell tonight
Take my hand and pretend
It's gonna

Fall fall from the sky
It's gonna pour like hell tonight
At last I heard you say it's all okay",Last Laugh,2000

Eight hours for what?
Oh, tell me what I got

That time's just holding me down
I'll hit the ceiling

Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose

Deep way down in your heart

It will if you don't even try

You'll get by if you'd only cut loose

Whoah, Milo come on, come on let's go
Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose

You got to turn me around
And put your feet on the ground
Gotta take the hold of all

Footprints,"When an early autumn walks the land and chills the breeze
And touches with her hand the summer trees,
Perhaps you'll understand what memories I own.
There's a dance pavilion in the rain all shuttered down,

A winding country lane all russet brown,
A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely.
That spring of ours that started so April-hearted,
Seemed made for just a boy and girl.

I never dreamed, did you, any fall would come in view
So early, early.
Darling if you care, please, let me know,
I'll meet you anywhere, I miss you so.
Let's never have to share another early autumn.",Early Autumn,2004

The wind is filled with songs
So many songs, which one is mine?
One must be right for me

Which song of all the songs
When there's a song for every star
And there are oh so many stars, so many stars

So many hearts, so many smiles

He's going off about something that you said
'Cause he doesn't get your humor like I do.
I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night.
I'm listening to the kind of music he doesn't like.
And he'll never know your story like I do.

He wears jerseys
I wear t-shirts
He's team captain
And I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.

If you can see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me
You belong with me!

Walking the streets with you and your worn out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be.
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
""Hey, isn't this easy?""

And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town.
I haven't seen it in awhile since he brought you down.
You say you're fine - I know you better than that.
Hey, what you doing with a dick like that?

I wear Toms and
He wears sneakers
He's banging your friend
Underneath the bleachers
I'm dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.

If you can see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me
Standing by you waiting at your backdoor.
All this time how could you not know, baby
You belong with me

Oh, I remember you were driving to my house
In the middle of the night.
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're about to cry.
I know your favorite songs,
And you tell me about your dreams.
Think I know where you belong,
Think I know it's with me.

Why can't you just fucking see?

Why can't you just fucking see?

And how we fought each other,
Pushing one another to be somebody else

And time and time

Uncertain if the end was right or wrong,
And whether we should be together
Or with somebody else

That last memory,
She had water in her eyes
She cried stay with me
And asked how can this be love if you're leaving me?

And I can't see you right now
'Cause I just can't fake it
Come be near you right now
'Cause I know you're no longer mine

That we had to break
That even though I knew we had it so well
We're strangers in different places though we live a mile apart

My world has been torn
We'll never share a name
Never be one
But I will always remember the years we spent in love

I still think of you
I pray that you are safe
I'm still missing you
But it has to be this way cause I'm not right for you
And that's why love's to blame

What an empty phrase, really I'm more amazed
How in spite of how I fail to do what you command to
Serve other gods like Baal, you never bail,
That's illogical devotion, could it really be
You chose to die for the sinner when nothing was good in me.
You never left me, even when the darkest days began
Nor forget me, only thing you're forgetting is my sin.
I wanna make it to the end, let me remain faithful,
All because you're faithful in me, yeah, I'm grateful.
My mistakes can never stop me, choice you make to adopt me,
The holes in your hands are the proof that you'll never drop me.

[Chorus]
I'm caught dreaming
Someone greater than me
And the colors seem
A burning tree speaking to me,
I'm caught dreaming,
Someone greater than me
Bringing liberty
The burning tree is saving me,
I'm caught dreaming.

I could sing how I love you, love you,
But your love for me is much greater.
And I could sing how I love you, love you,
But your love for me is much greater.

I'm caught dreaming
Someone greater than me
And the colors seem

Let the light flood into your eyes for the first time. 
Feeling the blood course through your veins, finding the truest version of yourself 
By knowing the one who knows you even better than you know yourself.

Some people run from fear, some from their own reflection
Some people run their mouth, some people run their house
Ruling with the heart of a tyrant
Some people run their block, bust shot with a 4-4-5 and
That’s the environment, how we were raised
Living like lions but trapped in a cage

To sleep with you is like a bed filled by snakes

Smiling and sucking your fingertips
Oh, lash me with your whip
I'm your slave...My dear carniwhore

You're the cocaine on my filthy mirror

Living in fear to be left alone
My lips turn to blue

I'm like a sheep among the hungry wolves
This is my sorrow blues
You're the poison in my veins
I'm just a fool in your game

In the prison of my own frontiers
Loneliness is my worst fear

Do they crash down and fall apart?

Let's cut the wings away

The ruins of my trust

And no one's gonna shed a tear
I have been dead for so long
And no one seems to care

Sometimes I really hate people close to me
They want to see my reaction
That I don't want to give

Sometimes I really want to be just dead
Without any kind of
Torturing stress

I wrote it in the dead air, I wrote it in the shape of despair

I'm still walking anyway",Tomorrow Is a Closed Gate (Dead for So Long),2003

For Today,"I won't go back the way I came
There is no turning back.
I'd walked away from everything that could save me.
I won't go back the way I came
There is no turning back.
I once was blind, but now I see things clearly.
I'll never see the world the same way.
The words of truth within this man forever changed me.

Is he just flesh and blood, or is there more to the power I see?
Filled with the strength of God, but he moves and breathes as a man, just like me.
When the spirit overcomes the flesh
You'll see one man with power over death.

So let me die.
And let the saints rise.
With hands like mine, he turned water to wine.
So let me die.
And let the saints rise.
With hands like mine, he gave sight to the blind
And he opened up my eyes

I won't go back the way I came
There is no turning back.
I'd walked away from everything that could save me.
I won't go back the way I came
There is no turning back.
I once was blind, but now I see things clearly.
I'll never see the world the same way.

Break the chains that bind me.
Flesh and blood, filled with the fire of God,
Come break the chains of my bondage.
Flesh and blood, filled with the fire of God,
Deliver us from the darkness.

How could a man like me be a man that's so unlike me?
The words you say got me turned away from the man I might be.
My hands can build, but your hands can create.
My hands can help, but your hands can save.

I won't go back the way I came
There is no turning back.
I'd walked away from everything that could save me.
I won't go back the way I came
There is no turning back.
I once was blind, but now I see things clearly.

Before a judge that could see past the white mask that hid my shame
With terror flowing through my veins,
All of heaven and earth hid themselves from His face

No son should ever have to face the world without the love of his father
I faced the world alone
I had no one to run to, and everything to run from

Its victims their right to life

You never seen anybody on the scene that can hold a track down like this.

Foreign Legion,"Prozac- I think Socrates said it best, when he said, yo what the hell did I just drink

[Prozac]
As you sit there listenin to this foreign legion record your chillin
but somebody somewhere else just blew their brains out on the ceiling
someone else just made their first million dealing cocaine
somebody somewhere else is making love out in the rain
at the same time I spit this rhyme someone is dissin me
someone just got HIV losing their virginity
someone else is giving me props on how I rock mics (meanwhile)
Britain is abusing human rights
someone saw the lighted guide and now they think their saved
someone just sold their only child to be a slave
someone's taking shelter in a cave while others bath
in solid gold bath tubs, someone else is on their nuts
what's strange to me is all this happens simultaneously
somebody wins the lottery
someone lost their fortune
someone's parents died on they're an orphan
someone else is boarding a plain that's gonna crash into the ocean
someone just got caught doing strange things with lotion
someone got adopted
someone else got an abortion
someone's staring down into a coffin at their mother
someone's propositioning a cop who's undercover
someone's with their secret lover putting on a rubber
someone got a job because their color not they skill
someone just got killed over a twenty dollar bill
someone's taking money from their child to buy a rock
someone said they'd keep it real but now they're going pop
food for thought and you don't quit don't stop
different situation same second on the clock
it all takes place while this mic is getting rocked",Meanwhile,2000
Foreign Legion,"One... (no!)... Two... Three  (no!)  One, Two, Three  (ow!)

Prozac - you know I'm not crazy son, take this tip
Hold this cigarette over your mouth 'cause you know they can read your lips
'Cause they need to control your environment
Surveillance - a requirement
That's why they put those I-Spy cameras in fire hydrants
You know they got x-ray satellites to read your mail before it's opened
They got this secret base beneath the ocean
Testing out explosions of nuclear bombs down in the Oakland
That's why all those crackheads are smokin'
It's remote-controlled emotions triggered by cops with laptops
A chip inside your skin implanted with your Tetanus shot
Long before you could walk, they had you locked and barcoded
By race, color and class, your life is downloaded
They send subliminals with minimal efforts so you're unable
To control your thought process ever since they installed your cable
Reason for your behavior - DirecTV is the ringer
Why else would intelligent people tune in to Jerry Springer?
It's all lies, from baseball, to apple pies, to mom
Waco, Texas, Heaven's Gate, the Oklahoma bomb
The Desert Storm Syndrome, experiment that went wrong
Inject our own 'cause they probably won't come home anyway
The Vietnam conflict was a mere experiment
Soldiers came back from the war, couldn't tell you where they want
And commandoes that don't come back could use to their advantage
'Cause they're the guinea pigs to repopulate Atlantis

[Chorus - scratched]
""FBI spying on us through the radio antennas""
""Cause there's nowhere to hide unless you move to outer space""
(x4)

Some say that I hallucinate these men in black suits
But they don't want to know the truth about the Freemasons' pursuits
Illuminati's selling human bodies to the Martians
They faked Bruce Lee's death so he can train alien Spartans
When you drink a 40 ounce brew, all you really do
Is ingest enzymes the government designed to lower your IQ
Pass genetic flaws, although the combination varies
And this is why the cheapest liquor tastes just like fruits and berries
That's 'cause they want to kill all the Blacks, so they invented gangsta rap
Lace tracks with evil thoughts of selling crack for Cadillacs and CREAM
Target the pro-ghetto teen who reads those rap magazines
Keep him broke by advertising hundred-dollar jeans

[Chorus x2]
 
Roswell - rock, rock on
The grassy knoll - rock, rock on
Pyramids on the moon - rock, rock on
Stonehenge - rock, rock on
My man Art Bell - where you at?
My man William Cooper - where ya at?
My man Noam Chomsky - where ya at?
Illuminati - where ya at?

First they tell you that it's good to put that Vitamin see inside your diet
Shape tablets like cartoons so the kids all want to try it
You wouldn't expect the long-term effects - it comes in stages
It causes [?] Syndrome in the heavy user's babies
They killed Kennedy, Biggie, Tupac and Abe Lincoln
They planned the Titanic's sinkin'
They killed Marvin Gaye for thinkin'
They killed Versace - canceled Joanie Loves Chaci
Killed Princess Di and framed the papparazzi
It's all an evil plan written by the Illuminati
Long before Adolf Hitler ever changed his name to Liberace
The details are spotty about him and John Gotti
They've got a home for clones in the center of the Mojave
How do we cook with radiation? Build space stations?
We got that information from secret alien nations
It's amazing they're so brazen with the equation for restoration
Margaret Thatcher's looked the same since the King assassination
I'm basing information on data that was decoded
From transmitters destroyed when the Hindenberg exploded
They're paying people I know to get close to plant the bugs
Putting drugs in my tap water, thinning my blood
Just 'cause I panic, they'll label me a paranoid schizophrenic
My rhyme's authentic
Just like that giant asteroid that's headed straight for our planet
They call me a manic
Depressed suicidal nutcase to keep it candid
'Cause they know that I know the final hour's near
Any minute now the coming Armageddon's here
Any moment now the coming Armageddon's here
Any second now the coming Armageddon's here

[Chorus x2]",Nowhere to Hide,2000

Heard the roar of the crowd, he could picture the scene

Bought a beat up six string in a secondhand store

No twinkling company to light their dark hours
No early morning crescent to mark their dreams and moods
And if the sun always shone?
No melancholy gray
To condense their thoughts like fog
Or hot breath on a window pane
Where would the poets be without the rain?
To wet their skin
Let them begin to sprout their seed
Make them believe
'Cause words pile up and hang around
Linger near the feelings where they fell
Waiting for someone to write them down
Waiting for someone with a story to tell
But there's no melody without silence
There's no rhythm without the spaces in between

Others think is obscene

Tried so hard didn’t even make a dent

That nightingale must have been heaven sent

So much love with no regrets
So much love we paid off our debts
We dove right in and we got wet in the ocean
In the ocean
Love’s great big ocean
We dove right in
I bought a western shirt you know the kind with snaps
And the trumpet players playing taps
It’s hard to force yourself to relax 
When the future looms with impending doom
And the woman I left back in San Francisco
She’s still crying into her pillow
Four years like a blanket wrapped ‘round her shoulders
She’s still wishing that I’d hold her
And I wouldn’t mind, I wouldn’t mind
Did you ever see your reflection in a tear rolling down a freckled cheek?
Did you ever have weeks feel like days and days feel like weeks?
I drank scotch and played backgammon
Till I couldn’t keep my eyes open
Tried to let her go but I couldn’t help hoping 
For a chance of what we never had
Are we throwing out the good with the bad?

Maybe play a little piano
But the water won’t stop so I better start swimming
Tears well up I better keep grinning
The crowds shown up guess I better start singing about love’s great big ocean

I wonder how he’s doing
I wonder if he knows 
That I spent the night in a cheap motel by the side of the road?

And the TV didn’t even have a remote

Got nothing on you babe
I’ve see your eyes without their clothes
And I didn’t look away, I didn’t look away.
When the blossoms sweetness fades
When your tongue is tired
There’s nothing you need say
There’s nothing I require
In a lawn of endless green
You are one bright yellow dandelion flower
Are you glad for what you’ve seen?
Are you glad we shared these hours? Are you glad?
There’s fruit on every tree
Far more then we can eat
You share yours with the humming birds
I’ll share mine with the bees, I’ll share mine with the bees
Does the wind ever go out dancing?
Does the day prepare a feast?
Does the rain get tired of falling?
Does the night ever get to sleep?

Before the summer starts to wane
I love the way our hearts fit
In this jigsaw love we’ve made,
In this jigsaw love.
That sunflower down on the corner
Never seems to be afraid
I’ve seen it standing there at midnight
Seen it waving at daybreak, seen it smiling at daybreak

Always grabbing this moment from my hands
Never satisfied, never truly willing
How it got so stubborn I refuse to understand

Sings me songs and asks me how I’m doing
I’ve got a friend who makes light of my load

Says she needs some one to make her smile
I’ve got a friend who never calls me back
And he’s still my friend though it’s been a while
Yeah it sure has been a while
Sometimes my mind
Is an army general stomping around making demands.

Your currency and trade

Lay down your heavy load

Every cry is a stone in the road
Host your honor to a banquet
Another feast you will not eat

Sewn of woes instead of fleece?

Turn around baby,

And every night you leave crying,
And I could use some time.
And here I am,
There you go again. (Again)

So here I am I'm dying,
And I'm waiting for you,
Waiting for you.
Come back, come back to me,
And I'll take you gladly.
And I'll take you where to go.

Did you scream enough to make her cry,
To turn around,
Turn around baby.

Carry on like your supposed to be
Get away hurry up come on
Get away

How long have you been in your bedroom?
It's been three days straight with your sheets and your pillows
The crack on the walls a reminder of my father and all his integrity
I know that I shouldn't let it get to me (But it does and who am I kidding)

Stick around and you'll bury me

It may be hard but I'm trying hard to comprehend where I quit and where I should begin

A product of a no good

Title: Nikki
Lyrics to Nikki :
He was the man of every hour
He was a party all alone
He’d give his jacket to a stranger in the cold
She was the beauty queen from dallas
She could put a lion on a leash
And before he knew himself
She knew the man that he could be

It’s never that easy
It never seems right
When careful meets carefree
And in just 4 minutes they knew each other for life
And he said

“Alright Nikki, it’s alright Baby tonight
you can let your hair down
Alright Nikki, it’s alright Baby tonight
You can take a breath now
If you only live once
Stay in the clouds
Never come down
Trust me
Alright Nikki, it’s alright Baby tonight
you can let your hair down.“

She was an Angel craving chaos
He was a demon seeking peace
But they were each other’s
toxic cure called codependency
He tried to dig his way out of a coffin
‘cause she smothered him with care
Before they lived in castles
They were dying on a prayer

It’s never that easy
It never seems right
When careful meets carefree
And in just 4 minutes they knew each other for life
And he said

“Alright Nikki, it’s alright Baby tonight
you can let your hair down
Alright Nikki, it’s alright Baby tonight
You can take a breath now
If you only live once
Stay in the clouds
Never come down
Trust me
Alright Nikki, it’s alright Baby tonight
you can let your hair down..Whoa”

It’s never that easy
It never seems right
When careful meets carefree
And in just 4 minutes they knew each other for life
And he said

“Alright Nikki, it’s alright Baby tonight

Is that they don't grow on trees,
They don't fall from the sky,

Sign my life away?

It's the only way!
Trust me, I know,
How this must go!
Just do what the doctor says

He mixed elixirs and filters,
Pried scrolls and read excerpts.
He spoke in foreign phonetics
And read runes from ancient relics,
Stirred ointments with potions, and
Functions with doses.
He whisked it until smoke rose and
Seeped into her nose!

The illness had relinquished.
The doctor had fixed it,
The cleansing accomplished.
Their love was free to flourish.
But before it could sink in,
The front door was kicked in!
Standing in its place was Pallis!
Driven by malice, he had barged in 
To challenge Adakias!
To prove their love!

Forgive Durden,"I've been tracing your steps
Along with your dainty exquisite guest
Across mountain land and serpentining seas
These two have been on quite an odyssey

But you're a fool to think this princess
Could ever really love a couple of poor boys like us
She requires riches recherc
Riding with rodomontading rou's

Casanovas have charmed with chiffons
So Chichi chased her with their conceited coteries
Maharajahs have magniloquently mouthed
Their love for me through their menageries

She's been propositioned
Propounded by every pompous prince
Given panniers of peerless pears
And plums, polished

I've been seduced with shimmering, sparkling stones
Squired by suitors to sizable chateaus
And oh, I'm the one she chose

I understand how you can love a man of truth
So why don't you just ask him where he spent his youth?
Oh, look at her face, she really doesn't see
That you are from the dark and you've been lying through your teeth

Anhura, please listen, I really can explain
I meant to tell you sooner, it's been gnawing at my brain
Now you know the truth but that knowledge shouldn't change
The nature of our love, we've broken through the chains

I'm sure that she would care to hear your acumen
As to how your presence is the reason she is sick
But I suppose it's in vain, since her life is ending
When I thrust this blade into her heart-a-thumping

Brother, no

Brother, what have I done?
My blade has pierced your side
This was never my intent
O, God, please stay alive

Dear Pallis, you're my brother
You've tried to protect me
But your dagger's edge finding my flesh
It truly was my destiny

Brother, I was shortsighted
I ignored your cries
You really are the chosen one
The calculated sacrifice

Please listen to my last words
Before I fade away
This is my gift to you
Live for your love every day

Please don't let your tired heart stop beating
You're bleeding, just keep breathing
You will take care of this spinning sphere
I'll disappear and see you in the mirror

Place your hand on mine one last time and kiss me goodbye
Take the love inside my mind before I die
Place your hand on mine one last time and kiss me goodbye
Take the love inside my mind before I die
Before I die, please don't cry

The mountains seceded
The Light and Dark depleted
We lost Adakias but regained our science
Our world was finally reunited
So this is my cue of where to leave you

Now it's your story to retell and pass on
Because an idea is only relevant if it's being thought upon
So remember, never surrender
'Cause the unrelenting constancy of love and hope
Will rescue and restore you from any scope

Why had he waited for so long
To flee his home forever shaded, where the jaded are never wrong?
He took a deep breath
He was finally gone
His hope was left strong
That a meaning would be found
That had kept him withdrawn
His stare had caught a light
And he fell for the sight

She suffered from the same strife
And like Adakias, she spent most of her time

Love makes the streets again. Do you remember when?
You laughed and called me names. Times changed, you're not the same
From inner city hell. Dead walls and smoking smells.
You used to be a child. Waton mad and raving wild

You have a friend in your gun.
You get your way having fun.
You, on the run going wild.
Now it's no fun, you must run you must hide.

Pool halls and stolen cars. Another night behind the bars.
What I want, I will take. Trust me I'll be your snake.
Nothing can hold me back when I start my attack.
Gray walls will be my friend, till I break out again.

You have a friend in your gun.
You get your way having fun.
You, on the run going wild.
Now it's no fun, you must run you must hide.

You, on the run going wild.
Now it's no fun, you must run you must hide.
You, on the run going wild.
Now it's no fun, you must run you must hide.

You only came for the fight

Another childish bruise

And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

[Verse One: Chris Lowe]
I'm in line to see the club rock
Fly shorties all over lookin too hot
Tryin to get a spot, tryin to see some ass drop
Bend over, let me put it in a padlock
Backwards, full of hydro
In New York, or New Haven, or Chicago
Oh yeah, by the way, my name Chris Lowe
Move ya hips lows, love it when ya lips blow
Damn - shorty's standin by the coat check
Tryin to get her on the mic for a throat check
Chris poke her first night, that's a sure bet
Got her so wet, on her jeans, full jet
Damn, mami get me stuck
With them tight-ass jeans and she lickin her lips
Shake your ass like you havin a seizure
And girl we gon' freak for a week in the beat so let's go

[Chorus x2]
Let's go, I'm feelin ya flow
Yo' lips and yo' eyes, hips and yo' thighs (let's go)
Let's go, it's Knox and Chris so
We gon' take you on a ride and make it worldwide (let's go)

[Verse Two: Fort Knox]
Knox smoke trees by the ounces
Bumrush the club, I'm bigger than the bouncers (move)
I turn accounts to a trampoline
And my stroke so good it'll cramp a spleen (yeah)
I'm tryin to find me a go-go chick
That can bounce up and down on my pogo stick (bounce)
I'm tellin you girl, your ass is the one
More junk in your trunk than +Sanford & Son+ (oh no!)
And baby girl had a thong made of licorice (okay)
Real ticklish, kiss her on her clitoris
All the chicks wanna check for me
They call me Robo-Knox, I'm a sex machine
And I like 'em real thick like a milkshake (real thick)
With a sick waist, shake it 'til ya hips break
Knox be the same night Knox freak her
Spray white shit on her face like Noczema, let's go

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Chris Lowe]
She got a ass like Gabrielle Union's
I wanna smash, put somethin in the womb and
Shorty face like Vivica Fox
I only hit it one time and I pass it to Knox
Full blast and we chillin with Chuck
And she know she gon' get it if she get in the truck
I like the style, I like your strut
Shake your ass all wild, not givin a fuck

[Verse Four: Fort Knox]
Body right and brain is amazin
Shorty ran more trains than Penn Station
Stay right and keep my pen blazin
My flow's a burnin sensation
So back it up, girl put it in my lap
I take yo' ass home, then you know it's a wrap
Let's get it goin on, yo you know where it's at
I got you, your man ain't gettin you back (let's go)

That's not me, I'm not judging
Not below 'em, not above 'em
But disrespect me? Well then fuck 'em

Fort Minor,"You ready?! Let's go!
Yeah, for those of you that wanna know what we're all about
It's like this y'all (c'mon)

This is ten percent luck
Twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure
Fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

He doesn't need his name up in lights
He just wants to be heard whether it's the beat or the mic
He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him
But fuck 'em, he knows the code, it's not about the salary
It's about reality and making some noise
Making a story, making sure his clique stays up
That means when he puts it down, Tak's pickin' it up

Who the hell is he anyway, he never really talks much
Never concerned with status but still leavin' them star struck
Humbled through opportunities given despite the fact
That many misjudge him because he makes a livin' from writing raps
Put it together himself, now the picture connects
Never asking for someone's help, or to get some respect
He's only focused on what he wrote; his will is beyond reach
And now it all unfolds, the skill of an artist

This is twenty percent skill, eighty percent beer
Be a hundred percent clear 'cause Ryu is ill
Who would've thought that he'd be the one to set the west in flames
Then heard him wreckin' with The Crystal Method, Name Of The Game
Came back, dropped Megadef, took 'em to church
I like bleach, man, Ryu had the stupidest verse
This dude is the truth, now everybody be givin' him guest spots
His stock's through the roof; I heard he fuckin' with S-Dot

This is ten percent luck
Twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure
Fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

They call him Ryu he's sick, and he's spittin' fire and Mike
Got him out the dryer he's hot, found him in Fort Minor with Tak
What a fuckin' nihilist porcupine; he's a prick; he's a cock
The type women want to be with and rappers hope he get shot
Eight years in the makin' patiently waitin' to blow
Now the record with Shinoda's takin' over the globe
He's got a partner in crime; his shit is equally dope
You won't believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat

He's not your every day on the block
He knows how to work with what he's got
Makin' his way to the top
He often gets a comment on his name
People keep asking him was it given at birth
Or does it stand for an acronym?
No, he's livin' proof that he rockin' the booth
He'll get you buzzin' quicker than a shot of vodka with juice
Him and his crew are known around as one of the best
Dedicated to what they do and give a hundred percent

Forget Mike, nobody really knows how or why he works so hard
It seems like he's never got time
Because he writes every note and he writes every line
And I've seen him at work when that light goes on in his mind
It's like a design is written in his head every time
Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
And those motherfuckers he runs with, the kids that he signed
Ridiculous, without even trying, how do they do it?

This is ten percent luck
Twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure
Fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

This is ten percent luck
Twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure
Fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

Everybody's searching for somethin'
But all they can find is a whole lot of nothin'
Back home
Ain't nobody hoping and praying
'Cause they feel like nothing can save 'em
And they try to hold out but they can't fight the fact that
Life goes black when those lights go out
But I guess you gotta just watch out for your own
'Cause ain't a damn thing free
Back home

Back home they holler ""disciple"" and ""blackstone""
Some black they freebase yo we trapped on
Where our grandmothers marched the guns clap on
There's liquor stores, beauty supplies, and rap songs
I travel the world just to come back to it
The crib got a lot of soul like black music
I'm attached to it
In many ways this city raised me and gave me
The drama, honor, and bravery
The streets seem hollow when I go to Chicago
It's cheap wine and sorrow
Times hard to swallow
In search of God's tomorrow I borrow words from the
Bible and use them for survival gangs rival
Signs painted on the walls like hieroglyphics
I tell 'em that this is all tribal
Used to do dirt shorty's goin' through the same cycle
And trials like Michael tryin' not to stay idle

Back home it's not Compton but close
The same problems exist and the pain throbbin'
And folks are so common
It don't really bother us much we just swallow it uh
Crack the bottle and smoke hope tomorrow something
Magical happens that'll put me back in the biz
But the chances of it actually happening's kinda slim
Back home we get the good life at glimpse
In the form of a rap start, drug dealers, and pimps
I'm back home

Back home I try my best to keep it together it's cold
Like the Windy City streets of December
I pace back and forth looking for the courage to shine
But can't tap the source need something to nourish my mind
I know we all lose quite a bit in life
Only to gain some
Life or the dark winding roads we came from
But I move with the night so I'm used to the shade
And never lose sight bringing truth back to the game

Back home we've got a lot of shit on our minds
We're always behind on something 'cause there's not enough time
And we're non-stop bottom line doing what we gotta do
To get some food in the fridge and stay out of the hospital
Back home there's people calling us hopeless
People trying to tell us all we need is some focus
But focus
Focus is overrated

To add a little spice to the life you've been through
Everyone exaggerates a tiny little bit
Make that shit sound more gangster than it really is
You can't appear weak man, we wanna hear street
We wanna hear you spit your thug over this here beat
Don't take it as sarcastic, I can't get enough
I'm telling you, you can call my bluff, if it's not ruff
Then I don't really need it, I'm not even ashamed
I got too much reality that's filling up my brain
So sell me on that product, I'm addicted to the game
Suck it up like a cigarette, light it up man

It's just like a cigarette, it's something that I do
Once in a while but between me and you
It's just like a cigarette, nobody's really fooled
I don't want the truth I wanna feel fucking cool

Let me tell you something that I realized tonight
My hip-hop radio's like Marlboro Light
They're both selling stories and they sound about the same
Cigarettes say they're safe, rappers claim they really bang
We don't care if it's true when we lay the money down
We don't believe the words, we just love the way they sound
They're acting we're like idiots, they're lying to our face
Maybe we are idiots, we buy it anyway
I'm running out to get the next rapper's CD
Just sucking up the guns, drugs and misogyny
The same way that I suck up all the stories when I breathe
That little bit of death supposedly cancer free
And everything they say's got the truth twisted up
But twisted up's what I want, man, I can't get enough
Cause even though we know it's all just a big bluff
We just light another up, what, we don't give a fuck

Man, listen to my words, listen for while
Lip service radio, don't touch the dial
If you're in the car, turn up the track man
Give your whole neighborhood some second hand rap, hey
Matter of fact, listen for a while
Lip service radio, don't touch the dial
If you're in the car man, turn up the track
And give your whole neighborhood some second hand rap

It's just like a cigarette, it's something that I do
Once in a while but between me and you
It's just like a cigarette, nobody's really fooled
I don't want the truth I wanna feel fucking cool

People acting like they've lost their soul
And everywhere I go I see another person like me
Trying to make it all feel like home

Standing on the bridge in the dark and I'm seeing my breath
Trying to make it home without freezing to death
And my grandfather's face is stuck in my mind
And how seeing him tonight's gonna be the last time
I should've brought a jacket
Blowing in my hands like it's really gonna stop the chill
I buy a cup of coffee with a five dollar bill
Thinking, laying in that box people look so still
At times like these you start thinking
Your first breath in and the clock starts ticking
I'm not trying to bum anyone out
Not trying to be dramatic, just thinking out loud
I'm just trying to make some sense in my mind
Some defence from the cold that I'm feeling outside
And for a minute, escape with some rhythm and rhyme 
And get away from the grey just a bit of the time

Yeah, kinda funny how this world can treat you
Like a freak in a sideshow, a carnival creature
Climbing outta cans, I'm a diamond in the sand
But you can't tell the difference on a beach full of rhinestones
My life's like trying to swallow a pinecone
It's tough when you live fast, just to die slow
Talk to dial tones, my dreams are far fetched
It seems so I sleep underneath this park bench
I know it don't make sense
And I don't expect for you to know what it's like
Smoke, drink, piss, sniffing everything in my sight
Push rocks in a pipe
Liftoff, I keep puffin' 'til my lips turn white
And my chest gets tight, but who the fuck really cares
When you're so far left that even death looks right
All I can do is hope for the best and pray
That it gets a little better than yesterday

Pardon me I think I'm next to url
Too many problems going on that's why I left my girl
Packed my bags and I traveled with a pen and my notepad
Pissed that I was broke and all the things that I don't have
But still, I try to find a way to escape
From all the hate planted in my head which lead to mistakes
But now I'm breaking the mold, see I was patient and calm
Many sleep in the rain, but I'm awake in the storm
Writing my life in a short film, The Rise and Fall
How I managed to scorch hills and climb the walls
Pound pavement aimless in this cold existence
Even though things are changing I'm going the distance
Overcoming the doubt that had control for so long
And put it all behind me 'cause life still goes on
Now I'm much stronger, I know where I stand
While lost souls search over and over again

These days are dark and the nights are cold
People acting like they've lost their soul
And everybody's trying not to cry, trying to get by
And trying not to feel out of control
And if you look hard enough
Sometimes you'll find a place that might just remind you of home
But if it doesn't feel like home, you can do what I do
Just pretend you don't feel so alone",Feel Like Home,2005
Fort Minor,"""The dude, he said that, like when we were making the first Linkin Park record he was like, ""Yeah you know, I don't know about the rapping like, I don't know... maybe you should just be a rock band."" You know what I mean, like, trying to change us. Like they signed us as an act like what we sound like and then he's like, ""Oh I don't know maybe you should just play keyboard""...""

Before the first song that you hear me on
There were people already trying to get me gone
Telling me to quit rapping
Just play the keys that
""My band had a singer"", ""They didn't need me""
But my band had my back, so we did the tracks
Put out the album and the talk went flat
It was funny at first, but then the humor faded
When some magazines printed that our label made us
We were too good to be true
Some were saying ghostwriters were writing all that we do
So we had to disprove it, we spelled it out
To the detail, how we do it when we're making this music
After that I made it a rule:
I only do email responses to print interviews
Because there people love to put a twist to your words
To infer that you said something ducking fucking absurd
Oh, did I lose you at 'infer'?
Not used to hearing a verse that uses over first-grade vocabulary words?
People used to infer that we were manufactured
Now I've got the interviews on file
Which people said what, which number to dial
So now every enemy screaming insanity
All they're ever gonna be's another big fan of me
Bitch

""Can you believe that? Like it's crazy, it sounds crazy right, like at this point, at this point you hear it out and you're like ""That guy was out of his mind"". But honestly that's what he wrote. Besides the fact that he wanted me to just play keyboard or whatever, he didn't want me to rap. He was like ""Maybe Joe Hahn should, um, wear a lab coat and a cowboy hat"" on... like when we play... I swear to God he was crazy. And later on he claimed he wrote all our songs so that was really bad.""",Get Me Gone,2005

Trying to convince themselves that the record with Jay was a fluke
That the record that I'm making is a mistake

Let me tell you where I'm at with this
You bastards are gonna have to take back that shit
I'm not plastic and fake
When I make tracks I take facts and lay them out for the masses
You assholes are gonna see soon that I'm not playing
And start asking me the names that I'm not saying

Bigger than the petty name calling

Keep talking while I'm walking away

You can say what you have to say
'Cause my mind's made up anyway

Trying to make my friends turn their backs on the team we've built
Building up some mistaken information
And I can't take this

Angry groups complaining about the things we do
I'm not changing direction, I'm stepping my game up
Maintaining my name, same way that I came up
You're gonna see that I'm not playing
And start asking the names that I'm not saying
But I'm tryin not to mention the names of people who wanna siphon attention
You like the hype but pretending you're part of the picture won't pass
You're like a high school dropout, no class
You can say what you want about me
Keep talking while I'm walking away

Is to see how it sounds echoing off the street

When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step

With those blues on parade

Fort Minor,"I had a friend named Victor
The two of us used hang every single day
And it seemed like overnight that his whole life just changed
I know when his mom and his dad broke up it didn't make sense
But I know that his dad was a drunk and he gambled away the rent
Pretty soon Vic was seeing red, pissed off, but instead
He'd drink every night 'til he passed out
Then he'd do it all again
The whole time smiling on the outside to cover the pain
But on the inside all he was trying to do was get away

Yo, funny how things change color
Then fade to another shade, when you had it made
It was all good, but now look, just another day
It was so fresh, it was so clean
Now it's all gone, one, two, three
Lights out, which way to turn
Can't get a grip, all alone in a big white house
Every day gets worse and you just curse 'til your head bursts
And it hurts so bad, she left, now you suffer
Should've thought of that one first
No family, no kids, can't accept what you did, now you wanna
Run away but you can't cause the past comes back again

Slippin' through the cracks, sip a little Jack
Go to bed half dead
What about a rent? Why does every cent gotta be a bet
When's it gonna end
Oh my God, we don't got a penny left
My mom's gotta find a way to get a job
Outta debt, outta dodge, out of breath, out of this big problem
My pop's wanna get away from the pain
In a better place in his brain
But the medication he takes makes him wasted
So sick if he's gonna think the good Lord would come to take him
I'm shaking him
Wake up you son of a bitch

Go slipping through the cracks
Hiding himself away
Watching all the memories fade away

Twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure
Fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

He doesn't need his name up in lights
He just wants to be heard whether it's the beat or the mic
He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him
But fuck 'em, he knows the code, it's not about the salary
It's about reality and making some noise
Making a story, making sure his clique stays up
That means when he puts it down, Tak's pickin' it up

Who the hell is he anyway, he never really talks much
Never concerned with status but still leavin' them star struck
Humbled through opportunities given despite the fact
That many misjudge him because he makes a livin' from writing raps
Put it together himself, now the picture connects
Never asking for someone's help, or to get some respect
He's only focused on what he wrote; his will is beyond reach
And now it all unfolds, the skill of an artist

This is twenty percent skill, eighty percent beer
Be a hundred percent clear 'cause Ryu is ill
Who would've thought that he'd be the one to set the west in flames
Then heard him wreckin' with The Crystal Method, Name Of The Game
Came back, dropped Megadef, took 'em to church

Got him out the dryer he's hot, found him in Fort Minor with Tak
What a fuckin' nihilist porcupine; he's a prick; he's a cock
The type women want to be with and rappers hope he get shot
Eight years in the makin' patiently waitin' to blow
Now the record with Shinoda's takin' over the globe
He's got a partner in crime; his shit is equally dope
You won't believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat

He's not your every day on the block
He knows how to work with what he's got
Makin' his way to the top
He often gets a comment on his name
People keep asking him was it given at birth
Or does it stand for an acronym?
No, he's livin' proof that he rockin' the booth
He'll get you buzzin' quicker than a shot of vodka with juice
Him and his crew are known around as one of the best
Dedicated to what they do and give a hundred percent

Forget Mike, nobody really knows how or why he works so hard
It seems like he's never got time
Because he writes every note and he writes every line
And I've seen him at work when that light goes on in his mind
It's like a design is written in his head every time
Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
And those motherfuckers he runs with, the kids that he signed
Ridiculous, without even trying, how do they do it?

Looking down at the street and wondering where their car went
Someone in a car is sitting at a signal
In front of a restaurant staring through the window at
Someone right now with their finger in their teeth
Who could use a little floss, right across the street
There's somebody on the curb who really needs a jacket
But spent half the rent at a bar getting plastered
Now he's gotta walk fourteen blocks
Just to work at a shop where he's about to get fired
Someone right now is looking pretty tired 
Staring at a laptop trying to get inspired
As somebody living right across the street
Just wrote the best thing that she's written all week
But her best friend's coughing up blood in the sink
He can't even think what happened, feeling so confused
And he knows it looks bad but nothing he can do 
I wonder what it's like to be right there in his shoes but...

Yo, I'm just taking it in
Out the window of a hotel bedroom again
Tomorrow I'll be gone, I don't know when I'll be back
But in this world everything can change just like that...

Somebody right now is dropping his vote
Inside a box trying to not get shot in his throat
For the act of freedom, right now somebody's stuck in Iraq
Hoping that he gets shipped back breathing
In a war but he's not really sure the reasons
So we show our support when the press mislead him
Though we mourn, remain proud, salute the troops
Get some, I know you boys got some work to do

Meanwhile, right now someone's 25-to-life-ing
Standing on a corner with their thumb up hitchhiking
Scratching off a lotto ticket hoping for a real winner
Sneaking through the border just to work and eat a real dinner
Right now someone wishes they were you and I
Instead of second-guessing fatal thoughts of quiet suicide
But right now I'm staring out the window at a fiend
With holes in his arm and holes in his jeans
He pulled out a cigarette and sparked a light 
And walked right around the corner just out of my sight but...

I'm just taking it in
From a second storey hotel window again
The TV's on and my bags are packed
But in this world everything can change just like that

Yeah, right now somebody's sittin' in the darkness
Tryin' to figure how to put some heat in their apartment
But they got a little mattress, little carpet
And they appreciate it 'cause some people on a park bench
You see 'em rushing to get to the office
Wife ride by 'em when she up from the market
Right now somebody comin' out the pocket
Tryin' to dump that rock they runnin' round the block with
Same time the cops is raisin' the glock
With aim to fill your legs and your back with some hot shit
Right now somebody's struggling to stop this man
That's kicking and punching and cussing at the doctors
Down the hall a child is takin' its first breath
The doctors ain't even passed him to the nurse yet
Yo, I wonder of he understand what it's worth yet
Life, the time spent while we here on the earth yet
The answers to the questions we all seek
Can be found, it depend on how free y'all think
Right now, it's somebody who ain't eat all week
That would kill for the shit you throw away in the street
I guess one man's trash is a next man's treasure
One man's pain is a next man's pleasure

I'm just taking it in
In another strange hotel lobby again
With my luggage on my back, I don't know where I'm at
I'm in a world where it all changes just like that

Fort Minor,"You know me
I used to get caught up in everyday life
Trying to make it through my day so I could sleep at night
Tried to figure out my way through the maze of rights and wrongs
But like you used to say
Nothing feels like it's really worth it
Forget perfect, I'm trying not to be worthless
Since I last saw you I've been looking for a purpose
Well, I met this kid who thought like I did
He had a weird way of looking at it
This is what he said

Slip out the back before they know you were there
And at the worst you'll see nobody cares
Cause you don't wanna be around when it all goes down
Even heroes know when to be scared

Now, I don't remember where I met him
Or remember his name
But he walked funny like he was just too big for his frame
Just over five foot but he weighed a buck fifty
And what he said seemed so right it stuck with me
Listen, it's like poker, you can play your best
But you gotta know when to fold your cards and take a rest
And know when to hold your cards, hold your breath
And hope that nobody else is stacking the deck

Because I don't need to tell you that life isn't fair
It doesn't care, it arbitrarily cuts off your air
And like you, I want someone to say it's okay
In the truest part of our hearts everybody's afraid
We're just under-appreciated and overwhelmed
Fighting so hard to hide our fear that we're scaring ourselves
You understand what I'm saying, cause you always did
But it's different in the words of a cowardly kid who said

And I'm no hero
You remember how it was, you know
All I ever did was worry, feeling out of control
To the point where everything was going end over end
I'm spinning around in circles again
This is where you come in
All of this to explain to you why I had to
Separate myself away from yesterday's life
Please remember, this isn't how I hoped it would be
But I had to protect you from me

That's why I
Slipped out the back before you knew I was there
I know you felt unprepared
But every single time I was around I'd just bring you down
And I could tell that it was time to be scared
That's why I
Slipped out the back before you knew I was there
And I know the way I left wasn't fair
I didn't wanna be around just to bring you down
I'm not a hero but don't think I didn't care",Slip Out the Back,2005

This is a story of them against us, win or lose
Forcing your feet into someone else's shoes
Everybody's got something to say, that we ought to
Live their way, what we're doing's not okay
In this world everybody's got a chip on
Both sides of the neck, got no respect
Wait up a sec
You ever feel like the pressure is
Too much to take, too much weight?
Ladies and gentlemen
If anybody can hear me right now please shout back
We're not the only ones feeling so trapped
In the dream of somebody else, in fact
They got their heads full of some overblown scheme
Opportunity they missed back when they were sixteen
And all they want to do is push you to be that
And all you want to do is scream back

Gonna be sombody

Gonna be someone

We don't sleep to dream, we sleep to build stamina
Energy to do our thing, get your camera
Cause this ride is about to begin
Sit down and buckle it in, lemme say it again
In this world everybody's got a chip on
Both sides of the neck, got no respect
Wait up a sec
When I was young they said the
Odds of making it were slim to none
Ladies and, fuck it
I'm tired of them saying the dream you have
Doesn't exist, telling you you're worthless saying you should quit
Basically telling you that you'll never be shit
Really they're pissed cause they'll never achieve some

And all you want to do is scream back

Lupe Fiasco:
They're gonna think you're crazy
Mumbling to yourself in the basement all day
Uh-uh-uh-ing and to yourself
My pops didn't dig it with shoveling it to myself
My boys used to get it they dug it because they felt
My undertaking took me I was making in my stealth
A wealth of rhymes of crazy I would chuckle to myself
Then they went into the mental rolodex
See I knew 'em by heart like a brain in my chest
Then I took 'em to school where subjects were getting felt
Books under my seat notebook laying on my desk
My teacher's like, ""Mr. Jaco?""
""Yes?""
""With all that knowledge, you ain't trying to college
Be a lawyer or a doctor, get a whole lot of dollars
Rather degrade woman and glorify violence?""

So I push and I push until there's no one there
But the air is getting kind of thin up hear

Separation lost in a world of I don't care 
For anyone or anything you're not allowed in here
I'm throwing caution to the wind
Don't lend me a hand cause all I want is to descend

Tell me the truth behind my disease

The sky was the limit when it was about how high
You can fly over hills through the valleys 
Into plains over oceans that's life son feel the emotions
Commotion has erupted and disrupted the path you were on 
That's a fact jack get in the zone
Alone is a place where we all have dwelled
But you're like a convict in a single cell
I'm compelled to impale you and forced to yell
Death is a word with a nasty smell
Don't make me come in and rip you out of your shell
The raw power of the winds of truth's in your sails

We won the race
Got out of the place

They notice fast
And some mistakes were built to last

That's what you get

I say that's what you get

That's what you get for changing your mind

And after all this time

I swear I never saw it comin', I just felt you gettin' under my skin

Then I drop the beat I have in store
Lay dynamics on the top like a rug
Make it sound smooth and later make a dub
An MC ate well, so that you can tell
I am not illiterate, no not even a little bit
Nothing like an idiot, get it?
You want the record, cool, I'm with it
Let the rhythm take you, shake it cause it makes you
As I turn the knob of the door you escape through
Go in like a knot, don't be a puff
And I let it play cause Dre's getting funky enough

	It's getting funky, it's getting funky (Repeat 3x)
	Watch the smooth lyrics that take place

If you want another reason why it must be funky
Yo I am not a jackass meaning not a donkey
So I will play the game like it should be played
Drop the funk into the mix so the place will never fade
Ship it the the stations in your jurisdiction
Others say I'm dope, and the others say I'm bitching
No crowd can avoid the D-O to the see
When I'm P-E-are-F-O-are-M-I-N-G
On the stage, see the simple fact is I engulf
And known, I rock a funky beat without a cord so
It is my conclusion you will enjoy the fusion
And I will ascend with the style I am using
Knowing that it's tough and it's not a bluff
I think I'll let it play cause Dre's hitting funky enough

	It's getting funky, it's getting funky (Repeat 3x)
	Dre make the funky hip-hop music so check it

Listen to the kick drop in with the click
And with no rehearses I'm dropping funky verses
Stupid with the bit that you think you are relying on
You love it when it rattles is the fact that I'm buying on
Suckers never come close cause of knowing
There is no stopping the D.O.C. when I'm flowing
But in the event that someone will try and juice this
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
I don't give a damn, don't think that I am joking
Cause I don't think he is funny when you're messing with my money
Yo people tell me this: ""Yo Dre you must stop him""
But with no frills, so I just drop him
Continue with the rhyme and make sure I get mine
With no static cause that's all I need to get my nine, but
Lessons have been learned now all kidding have been fronting
Let it play when the people say ""Dre yo you're getting funky enough""

	It's getting funky, it's getting funky (Repeat 3x)
	Deal with the D-O to the see

I'm your break so I can check around
See who the hell who is sitting down
I want all chairs off the floor
And if he stands to the wall, show him the door
And the PK nothing giving you something to rock to
To go nonstop to, not have to look at the clock you
Percieve, but can't believe you're being taken
By a beat so cool you start shaking
And shivering, cause I'm delivering the answer
Haven't seen you're a hellified dancer
You tried sitting but it just won't work
Cause the beat is to fresh
Don't even tell it won't be funky enough

	It's getting funky, it's getting funky (Repeat 3x)

Boats that sail away at night

Discothques and rolling stones
Passing fancies fly away
Empty shadows on a sunlit bay

Laughter from an open door
Friendly faces once again
Come inside before it starts to rain

Upon the plains of war.
I shall destroy them all.'

He had two sons and a daughter fair
By night and day they were contriving
For to fill their sister's heart with care

One night one night our restless young girl
One brother rose up from his bed
He heard the servant court their sister
Oh he heard they had a mind to wed

Oh when he rose the very next morning
Went searching for the servant-man
And when he found him this young man he murdered
Oh left him lying in the briars around

Oh she went to bed a-crying and lamenting
And thinking of her own true love
And as she slept she dreamt that she saw him
A-lying in the countryside all covered with gore and blood

Oh brothers, brothers why do you whisper
And what's become of this servant man?
Oh we lost him when we were a-contending
We lost him were he won't ever be found

Oh she early rose the very next morning
And searched the countryside around
And there she saw her own dear jewel
A-lying in the briars where he'd been found

Three days and nights she'd lie by him
She thought her heart it would break with woe
When a cruel hunger came upon her
And in despair to her home she did go

And won't you tell us where you've been
Stand off, stand off you bloody butchers

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Tells me quietly she has absolutely nothing to say

Of love with you?

Spend my dimes on phones
Trying just to talk but
You don't answer . . . you let it ring

Spend my nights alone
Catching falling stars to
Give to you, love
They're just for you

For stars fall every time a
Lover has to face the truth
And far too many stars have fell on me
And as they trail the skies
And burn their paths upon my eyes
I cry

And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

You know I'm yours for just the taking

Four Cats,"Strolling along country roads with my baby 
It starts to rain, it begins to pour 
Without an umbrella we're soaked to the skin 
I feel a shiver run up my spine
I feel the warmth of her hand in mine

Oh, I hear laughter in the rain,
Walking hand in hand with the one I love
Oh, how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feel inside 

After a while we run under a tree 
I turn to her and she kisses me 
There with the beat of the rain on the leaves 
Softly she breathes and I close my eyes
Sharing our love under stormy skies

Oh, I hear laughter in the rain, 
Walking hand in hand with the one I love

Step to this and get an ass-whoopin' like rodney king got.
Or get beat to your death like cochise,
My laws is no peace, fuck the police.

But them chumps is like ray Charles,
Cause they ain't seen no money yet.
Trash rappers I tax and spark,
I be wettin' niggas up like water rides at action park.

So I got money gun, they wet him and his honey bun.
Cause phony faggots I froze, it's a fact,
I flip fast on foes with fabulous fantastic flows.

So come check the magic show by Deshawn,
And witness the way I put you to death with a magic wand.
Turnin' your home to a casket,
Turn your wife into a widow and your son into a bastard.
Cause I love to keep M-C's sufferin',
Beggin' for big, heavy bags of bufferin'.

And step off with a bad bitch

Come on over baby, move closer to me

Oh dance with me, come on, dance with me baby
Dance with me, come on, dance with me baby
Dance with me, come on, dance with me baby
