Spider Loc,"It's 50, It's the Unit, that means it's money, ha ha

Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you
I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you
I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you
But you think I know cause you know how my squad do

Nowadays niggaz snitchin so much in the street
But you gotta talk to them like they the police
Nah, I don't know nothin 'bout poppin the heat
I don't know nothin 'bout sellin no beef in the streets
Nah, I don't know nothin 'bout baggin the grams
I ain't never had no spot or went hand to hand
Me, I don't know nothin 'bout takin the stand
I ain't never got a nigga ass stuck in the can
Nah, I don't know nothin 'bout dro or hash
Coke, dope, ex, dust or crystal meth
Nah, I'm just tryin to rap to get some cash
Keep the Hip Hop Police off my ass

Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you
I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you
I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you
But you think I know cause you know how my squad do

Aiyyo, that's my word on the stack of bibles
I don't know who did it I don't know who responsible
All I know who spittin all I know who givin
Me all this cash, just to put down twelve to get in yo' ass
Listen, keep it far away from me
I ain't got time for sittin in the penitentuary
All I know is I'm rich, all I know is that G-Unit work
When theb album drop they go bezerk
Mad video play, crazy radio spins
Number one all the time, our reign never ends
Don't point the finger at us somebody's hangin
They had a beef with us, plus we don't know nathin

Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you
I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you
I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you
But you think I know cause you know how my squad do

I don't know nothin 'bout jumpin out splittin homeboy head
But for real that's fucked up they say that homeboy dead
I can't even think, who 'gon want him dead
Have no idea what type of gun they done him with
You see I hear no evil and I see no evil
Ain't tryin to talk to or hear from or see those people
And I ain't had them little homies burn up no regal
I've been tryin to do this music thang and just go legal
I don't know why my name in your female's phone
But you really startin to sound like a females homes
Don't know why they told you that we sell stones
We on the internet tryin to get our Email on

Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you
I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you
I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you
But you think I know cause you know how my squad do

Nah nigga I don't know who sent them young boys through
To air the strip, shit just be happenin out the blue
I don't be around here, I ain't hip to the news
I don't know why that man clutchin on that shit when you move
I don't know why that other rapper got stripped for his jewels
You know how easy it is to get shit confused
I wasn't even in New York, I was just in the cruise
Somewhere way out in the islands woth your bitch in the cruise
Who's my bitch in the cruise, dudes get hit when they snooze
Lose they hit from the Uz, Uz all over the street
I don't know why they said what's up I don't know who's in that jeep
He talk about me all day but I ain't losin no sleep

Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you
I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you
I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you
But you think I know cause you know how my squad do

I don't know why my charm 'bout as big as your palm
And why the diamond chain I wear as 'bout as long as your arm
You tell me, how many diamonds in my bezel
There's one for everytime I had to grind up in the ghetto
I could show you how to do it, you tired of ridin Buicks
I don't know why niggaz rap for years and can't make hotter music
Even when, I don't do it chicks release body fluid
Body drop, shotty pop, and niggaz wanna tie me to it
I don't know why Loon and Fabby won't just say I'm they daddy
Why they solve them CB4 niggaz just keep comin at me
Got as many beefs as 50 and a nigga go to church
Could you imagine if my hands was on work, I don't know

Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you
I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you
I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you
But you think I know cause you know how my squad do",I Don't Know Officer,2005
Spider Loc,"Nigga, things change
They don't stay the same
Now watch me come up
I hustle, i hustle even harder
I put that work in to win, no problem

Nigga, things change
They don't stay the same
Now watch me come up
I hustle, i hustle even harder
I put that work in to win, no problem

All money ain't good money, this i know
But i still love hood money, it gets my dough
And as a youngster, that nigga went through so much church
That still turned out fucked up, i did so much dirt
Told to bang the neighbourhood, i put in so much work
Did a whole lot of time, caused mom so much hurt
On everythang, that boy wasn't done on purpose
Who knew that all my darkness was really gon' surface
I was stuck on that bullshit jus runnin' the streets
Without some type of beef, the week wasn't complete
Its like a nigga felt better after dumpin this heat
On feet, just to see the body slumped in the seat
Its like a whole 'nother rush to me, bussin' was sweet
Now im smarter, im all about something to eat
Im on the road spend 30 days a month in the suite
But im still gon' hustle and cheat, Lets Go Now!

Nigga, things change

Yeah, uh
Now walkin down the block without your weapon
Its a first class ticket to a lesson (uh huh)
I first cast tickets to perfection, me and Ben got a connection (yeah)
That's why i bring the Benz out to impress him (yeah)
Caught in my zone, all alone, homes rattlin' my bones
Cuz he yappin' off his lips and if i hit him i be wrong
Cuz he ain't never gon' be shit, i done work so hard
But i will make you a corn of the cob, you be performin for God
Either that or rob you on your boulevard
Bet you never thought for a second niggas would pull your cards
I don't know about y'all star, cuz my nigga gone
H.P tatted on me so his memory lives on
Engagin in drama without your llama
There'll be funeral arrangements for your momma
I learnd that when i was in pajamas watchin Micheal and Madonna
Now i got the appetite of a piranna, nigga

Nigga, things change
They don't stay the same

I hustle, i hustle even harder

Nigga, things change
They don't stay the same
Now watch me come up
I hustle, i hustle even harder
I put that work in to win, no problem

When nobody knows all the walls you go through
You can't even talk to those that supposedly know you
Some of the levels that these people'll go to, for crumbs
Damn tell me, is this what that dough do?
That's when you find yourself talkin to Pro Two
There's not to many people who ever can walk in Loc shoes
Its good as hell that my heart contains
I explain, so many different parts of pain
Im clean, but still some marks remain
From the past, when that crushed weed sparks to brang
The cash made some people start to change
I feel hate when i pulled up and parked the range
Ya damn right i got rich, but my heart the same
And practice makes perfect with the harder aim
You ain't really got the heart to bang
You ain't start to hang, till you find out I cought the chain..

Nigga, things change
They don't stay the same
Now watch me come up
I hustle, i hustle even harder
I put that work in to win, no problem

Nigga, things change
They don't stay the same
Now watch me come up
I hustle, i hustle even harder
I put that work in to win, no problem

Spider Loc,"[Chorus]
22's on the Porsche drugs henny in the fridge
That's how we live it is what it is
We run up in your crib snatchin kids in your wiz
We know where you live it is what it is
If we can't eat then your team can't live
That's how it is it is what it is 
Nigga that's how it is it is what it is
Nigga that's how it is it is what it is

I'm crippin' everyday token meet Jamaica
My pistol get it poppin' like the pistons and the pacers
I'm the messenger of misery I move discrete
You kiddin' me my victory is in the jaws of defeat
Then these haters wanna kill me 'cause my dreams is reality
The sig with the beam will cause a fatality
Just caught a case but it's a minor technicality
With shooters on the street prosecutors keep houndin' me
What you know about Grammy speeches sandy beaches
Pales that seedless four pounds and sweepers
Movie features groupie divas deals wit sneakers
Secluded in the woods from the snakes and leaches
I'm makin' money on the road homie autographin ass
While you on a silver horse with your metro pass
For every dollar you make nigga I make a G
Damn it feels good to live life like me

[Chorus]

Its spider and big yay, we doin' it which way?
Real big 'cause he stay where the rich stay
We get it crackin' like a high school ditch day
Ghetto mackin' is how I do the inch pay
A Escalade and a two che six tray
But his life is the price that the snitch pay
But its polital my paper sprowtin'
My girl get upset I don't take her out and
My choice of occupation make her doubting
Ill be out the front door I can't take the poutin'
I'm about anything that'll make a mountain of this mula
Ooh all the cake I'm countin'
See the games too deep I can't shake I'm scoutin' the clout
A fast line like the Lakers shoutin'
Tryna have me a flat wit some acres
Out in the boon docks so I move without them fakers

[Chorus]

I'm filthy so stop hatin' the milli's what I'm waving
You guilty by association you payin' for operations
Your kids be orphans coughi'n up orchids
We sprayin' up your Benz you layin' in coffins
Its gunit click nigga you love what we spit nigga
My wrist glist and glitter 'cause we sittin on six figgas
Yo its all about the benjamins feel the adrenalin
Yo we killin' 'em wit' beats from Dre and Eminem
Your bitch keep runnin' me I know she feelin' me
My last cap and gown was in elementary
The kid is back the kid is crack
I'm hot hot the way we rap we blazin' tracks
You not not and em on the beat I had to hire Marshall
So we keep the club packed full of fire marshals
Nigga 'em on the beat I had to hire Marshall
So we keep the club packed full of fire marshals

[Chorus]",It Is What It Is,2005
Spider Loc,"Yeah, a lightning bolt strikes in the air, yeah, finally it's here
'Cause y'all are the judge, the day of judgment finally is near
In your eye I see a tear, and it's remindin' me of fear
Rap's been dead so long, so stop denyin' what you feel

Dis payback for the fact that y'all ain't tryin' to keep it real
Grim reaper that we call revenge right beside ya in your ear
He's saying your time expired, time is finally due it's clear
Not sober mind is a weak mind and he's buyin' you a beer

Cheers, time for a toast
(Your heart's beatin', your heart's beatin')
To the haters that hate you the most
(Your heart's beatin')
And the friends that pretend to be your folks
(Your heart's beatin')
This is what revenge sounds like
(Your heart's beatin', your heart's beatin')
I hear your heart beatin', keep runnin' your mouth, yeah

Your mouth runnin' ahead of you, your mouth do what your legs should do
Let me walk to the edge with you, jump off of it, it
It sounds like your ready to, 'cause these rappers are terrible
And the game is unbearable but I'ma fix, fix

This feeling that's dead in you got your brains like a vegetable
Use the pro tools and tell 'em to edit it, it
Switch to somethin' that's better fool, turn it up what you better do
When I'm bringing revenge to you it sounds like this, this, this

Somebody call the doctor
(You're not breathin', you're not breathin')
They ain't gonna be well after this one right here
You're not breathin'
(You're not breathin', you're not breathin')
Just make sure they learn the name
(You're not breathin')
That's about to be runnin' the game
(You're not breathin')
Tell 'em the name, Chamillitary Mayne

Shoulda heard what I was tellin' you, I don't do what the jealous do
I don't hate when a nigga make it, 'cause I'm smarter and better too
You run when they tell you to but I move when I'm ready to
If you stop to take a breather, see that I'm light years ahead of you

y'all musta thought y'all wasn't gonna have to see me or somethin'
(I'm not leavin', I'm not leavin')
Houston, Texas, I'm here now
(I'm not leavin', I'm not leavin')
Anybody gotta problem?
(I'm not leavin')
Speak now or forever hold your peace
(I'm not leavin')
I ain't think so, yeah

The feeling's great 'cause they pay me, I expect some hatred so daily
I'm sticking the middle finger up like the feeling's mutual baby
The franchise and they say that the future can't really trade me
In Houston, I'm number one like I'm in the place of McGrady

But keep on pacing it baby, the full truth has arrived
If they ask you about you nigga, you fin' to lie
They ask me about me and hear a truthful reply
They said they seem none better than me so hear the truth wit'cha eyes

Better go take over befo' it rains
'Cause I'd hate to say that I told you Mayne
I know, I know what you're gonna say
But have it your way

I know these haters is gonna hate
And I see that angry look on your face
Tell 'em sound of revenge is on the way
This isn't your day

Lookin' for the truth, they ask me where have you been?
Where have you been? Where have you been?
Getting ready for these haters, I got somethin' for them
Somethin' for them, somethin' for them

You're real quiet 'til you think you hear a sound in the wind
Sound in the wind, sound in the wind
You turn around 'cause you think you hear that sound once again
You hear that?
(Yeah what's that?)
That's The Sound of Revenge

See, I told you
That's what happens when you get on his bad side

And now for The Sound of Revenge

I was working part time in a five-and-dime
My boss was Mr. McGee
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind
'Cause I was a bit too leisurely

Seems that I was busy doing something close to nothing
But different than the day before
That's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her
She walked in through the out door, out door

She wore a
Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

Built like she was
She had the nerve to ask me
If I planned to do her any harm
So, look here
I put her on the back of my bike
And we went riding
Down by old man Johnson's farm

I said now, overcast days never turned me on
But something about the clouds and her mixed
She wasn't to bright
But I could tell when she kissed me
She knew how to get her kicks

She wore a
Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof
And the horses wonder who you are
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
You feel like a movie star

Listen
They say the first time ain't the greatest
But I tell ya
If I had the chance to do it all again
I wouldn't change a stroke
'Cause baby I'm the most
With a girl as fine as she was then

How I'll hate going out in the storm!

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Spider Saloff,"I dim all the lights and I sink in my chair.
The smoke from my cigarette climbs through the air.
The walls of my room fade away in the blue,
And I'm deep in a dream of you.

The smoke makes a stairway for you to descend;
You come to my arms, may this bliss never end,
For we love anew just as we used to do
When I'm deep in a dream of you.

Then from the ceiling, sweet music comes stealing,
We glide through a lover's refrain, you're so appealing
That I'm soon revealing my love for you over again.
My cigarette burns me, I wake with a start;
My hand isn't hurt, but there's pain in my heart.

He said somehow, some way, it's gotta get better than this.
Patti packed her bags, left a note for her momma, she was just seventeen,
There were tears in her eyes when she kissed her little sister goodbye.

They held each other tight as they drove on through the night they were so excited.
We got just one shot of life, let's take it while we're still not afraid.
Because life is so brief and time is a thief when you're undecided.
And like a fistful of sand, it can slip right through your hands.

Hey white boy, what you doing uptown?

Hey white boy, you're chasing all the women around

Oh pardon me sir it's furthest from my mind

I'm just looking for a good friend of mine

I'm waiting for the man


Here he comes, he's all dressed in black

PR shoes, and a big straw hat

He's never early, he's always late

First thing you learn is that you've always got to wait

I'm waiting for the man


Brown stone building and three flights of stairs

Nobody stops you 'cause nobody cares

He's got the works and he gives you sweet taste

But then you've got to split because you've got no time to waste

I'm waiting for the man


Baby don't you holler, darling don't you scream and shout

I'm feeling good, I'm going to work it on out

I'm feeling good, I'm feeling so fine

Until tomorrow but that's just another time

And Prancer and Vixen,
Comet and Cupid

The most famous reindeer of all?

Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?

When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet

On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.

Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

To help him to live at his ease

His eyes would undress ev'ry maid in the house
Perhaps he is better described as a louse
But still people came just the same
He'd smile on the bar to the people below
And one night he smiled on my love
She blew him a kiss and she hollered ""Bravo""! 
As he hung by his nose up above!

The tears were like hailstones that rolled down my cheeks
Alas and alack and Alaska
I went to this fellow the blackguard and said 
I'll see that you get your deserts

Filled her with compliments and kisses and gin
That started her off on the road to ruin 
She made the supreme sacrifice
But even tho' I loved her I said ""Take my name  
I'll gladly forgive and forget!""

""Maybe later , not yet""!  Oh!

Found there her father and mother alone 
I asked for my love and soon t'was made known
To my horror that she'd run away
Without any trousseau she fled in the night 
With him with the greatest of ease
From two stories high he had lowered her down 
To the ground on his flying trapeze!
 
He floats through the air with the greatest of ease

His actions are graceful, all girls he does please 
And my love he has stolen away

A bill in red letters which did my heart gall 
That she was appearing with him
He'd taught her gymnastics and dressed her in tights 
To help him to live at his ease
He'd made her assume a masculine name 
And now she goes on the trapeze!

Spike Jones & His City Slickers,"Laura is the face in the misty lights.
Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,

She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura,2002
Spike Jones & His City Slickers,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

Beheading all you roses
To make up for the beauty
You've regained

I've waited for a chance.....
 A heart may break in a twist of fate
And be thrown upon the pile
My bed still whirls though I see other girls
When I stare a thousand miles
A heart may break in a certain time and place
But a friend still knows 
If its her kiss on your smile

Your yellow dressed Athena
Assaults your very windows 
And troubles all the clouds
Around your bed
And in the nearby land of the lovers
The one-eyed man is crazy
Cause lovers are too blind
To hear a word that the fool has said

Heavy (heavy) duty (duty)

You're playing the solos with no guitar in your hand
I don't pull no punches, I wouldn't waste your time
And just 'cause it pays, that ain't no crime.

I don't need a woman, I won't take me no wife
I get their rock and roll and that'll be my life

That I don't need
I just want to make some eardrums bleed.

I turn within to see the forces that created me

Tis an absolute rebirth

Only hills of sand

If I'm to make Baghdad by light of dawn

The sun's not your friend in the desert
Like he is at home
The wind has a name in the desert, sirocco
But it's barely known

It's only the hardiest bloom
That can blossom in darkest Khartoum
So I will just stay in my room, tonight

The desert isn't free with her secrets
She's a silent bird, quiet bird
I asked the Sphinx for the answer
It said, ""Mums the word""

And sleep till I'm wakened by rain

The running of the foal!

Do we lurk in the murk of the seas?
What then? are we born again?

The more it stays the same, the less it changes!

Feedin' me some knowledge instead of tryin' to out rhyme
Not insecure, for sure, not bored

Show me a lot of love in the club
You know your place, you give me my space, stay out my face
A G worth a cristal, for you and your pals

Spirit of the West,"I was tired of being put right down
By myself for not being what you
Thought you had found
Pulled hard in two directions by a
Desire to learn
And my old affections

When I tried to share my world with you
You could not seem to tolerate
The people I had grown to love
They shrank under your scrutiny,
Became the ones you'd hate

Why did everything, every little thing
Every little thing
With you and me have to be so political?
Everything, every little thing
Every little thing
With you and me have to be so political?

I was feeling a little underwhelmed
About hanging around with you and
Feeling over cautious
Every word, every little look, every little sigh
Every little phrase
Put me deeper in your doghouse

You'd let me out to run across your world
I ran into a wall you told me I built it
Then you'd reel me in, ream me out, pick me up
Push me out again
And then repeat it

Why did everything, every little thing
Every little thing
With you and me have to be so political?
Everything, every little thing
Every little thing
With you and me have to be so political?
Everything, everything with you and me was

Too busy tripping on my tongue
To try and stand my ground
And I can still see myself crying in your lap
Asking you, are you happy with the man you have found?

I'm grateful for what you did for me
I can see things now I never would have seen
And today I thought about what could have been
But could never be for you and me

'Cause everything, every little thing
Every little thing
With you and me had to be so political
Everything, every little thing
Every little thing
With you and me have to be so political?
Everything, everything
With you and me was so political
Oh political",Political,1988
Spirit of the West,"I was sitting in Bazil's with a friend and coffee
Thinking the world a fine place to be
When the man on my right got up to leave
And left a piece of his mind with me

He said, ""faggots like you should be put in asylums""
Tell me, who takes the blame
For his being scared, so unaware
That he'd fire his fear without an ounce of shame

Whatever happened to love thy neighbor?
Nothing more than a worn out cliché
Are all men created equal or has this too become passé?
You don't need to open your mouth for me to read your lips
I can follow the language displayed on your finger tip

They don't look before they leap
And they don't think before they speak
They just sharpen their tongues on you and me
Spit poison darts between perfect teeth

You've got to take it from the source
And look at where it's coming from
You're got to take it from the source
They're only wasted words on me

I guess I just don't measure up
Strayed from the straight and narrow road
So you lock me up, throw away the key
'Cause I don't live by your dress code

Well that's okay, I've heard it before
You can open the wound I feel no pain
I don't need an armor suit
'Cause you're the one with the ball and chain

And they don't look before they leap
And they don't think before they speak
They just sharpen their tongues on you and me

Spirit of the West,"Well, we're good old boys, we come from the North Shore,
Drinkers and carousers the likes you've never seen;
And this night, by God! We drank till there was no more,
From the Troller to the Raven with all stops in between

Well it all began one afternoon on the shores of Ambleside,
We were sittin' there quite peacefully with the rising of the tide;
When an idea it came to mind for to usher in the Fall,
And we all agreed next Friday night we'd go out on the crawl

And we're good old boys, we come from the North Shore,
Drinkers and carousers the likes you've never seen;
And this night, by God! We drank till there was no more,
From the Troller to the Raven with all stops in between

Well we planned to have a gay old time, the cash we did not spare,
We left all the cars at home and paid the taxi fare;
I got out to Horseshoe Bay a little after five,
From a table in the corner I heard familiar voices rise

And we're good old boys, we come from the North Shore,
Drinkers and carousers the likes you've never seen;
And this night, by God! We drank till there was no more,
From the Troller to the Raven with all stops in between

Well spirits they ran high that night, old stories we did share,
Of the days when we were younger men and never had a care;
And the beer flowed like a river and we drank the keg near dry,
So we drained down all our glasses and were thirsty by-and-by

And we're good old boys, we come from the North Shore,
Drinkers and carousers the likes you've never seen;
And this night, by God! We drank till there was no more,
From the Troller to the Raven with all stops in between

Park Royal Hotel, The Rusty Gull, Square-Rigger and Queen's Cross,
We'd started out with eight good boys but half had gotten lost;
And you'll never keep the lads together when their eyes begin to rove,
And there was just the three of us that made it to Deep Cove

And we're good old boys, we come from the North Shore,
Drinkers and carousers the likes you've never seen;
And this night, by God! We drank till there was no more,
From the Troller to the Raven with all stops in between

We arrived out at The Raven just in time for the last call,
The final destination of this the first annual crawl;
We dug deep into our pockets there was no money to be found,
Nine miles home and for walking we are bound

And we're good old boys, we come from the North Shore,
Drinkers and carousers the likes you've never seen;
And this night, by God! We drank till there was no more,
From the Troller to the Raven with all stops in between

And we're good old boys, we come from the North Shore,

And this night, by God! We drank till there was no more,

I've been gone for a month, I've been drunk since I left
These so called vacations will soon be my death
I'm so sick from the drink, I need home for a rest...

We arrived in December and London was cold
We stayed in the bars along Charing Cross Road
We never saw nothin' but brass taps and oak
Kept a shine on the bar with the sleeves of our coats

Euston Station the train journey north
In the buffet car we lurched back and forth
Past odd crooked dikes, through Yorkshire's green fields
We were flung into dance as the train jigged and reeled

You'll have to excuse me, I'm not at my best
I've been gone for a week, I've been drunk since I left
These so called vacations will soon be my death
I'm so sick from the drink, I need home for a rest...

By the light of the moon she'd drift through the streets
A rare old perfume so seductive and sweet
She'd tease us and flirt as the pubs all closed down
Then walk us on home and deny us a round

You'll have to excuse me, I'm not at my best
I've been gone for a month, I've been drunk since I left
These so called vacations will soon be my death
I'm so sick from the drink, I need home for a rest...

The gas heater's empty, it's damp as a tomb
The spirits we drank are now ghosts in the room
I'm knackered again, come on sleep take me soon
And don't lift up my head 'til the twelve bells of noon

You'll have to excuse me, I'm not at my best
I've been gone for a month, I've been drunk since I left
These so called vacations will soon be my death
I'm so sick from the drink, I need home for a rest...

This ain't the gospel and I ain't the lord

It's saying goodbye, saying hello
To where we have been, where we might go
It's what we have passed, what we might see
It's not just a train, it's freedom to me
Kids flattening pennies as the ironhorse rolls by
Between the trains I see an old man
A face full of smiles
A young woman crying as her lover leaves
Gun on his shoulder and stripes on his sleeve
It's not just a train
It's saying goodbye, saying hello
To where we have been, where we might go
Places we passed, places we'll see
It's not just a train, it's freedom to me

On Harper Lee's pages I turn to kill time
The car toads are waiting for me at the station
To give the bum's rush to a frost bitten bo

Catch me love, the world is falling
We'll ignore the rabble calling
Don't let them try and hurt you
Twist our pain into an issue
Into an issue

Tears flow again and again

Some things aren't worth worrying
Hello love it's me, some things are worth burying, hey yeah",Sadness Grows,1994
Spirit of the West,"Jesus hangs behind the glass
Above Venetian doors
His window box boasts crimson flowers
Fresh cut the day before

And you couldn't find a smile
If you nailed it to his face
But Jesus Christ hangs his head with grace

And if Venice is sinking
I'm going under
Cause beauty's religion
And its Christened me with wonder

Creeping 'cross the floor all dressed in black
Candles, thick as pillars
You can buy one off the floor
And the ceiling's painted gold

Spirit of the West,"We were gathered on a Thursday
To see the two out of five
Pitch your newly pressed pop record
And the room was well inside
Until the faithful got the bends
And you never made amends
For the fielding error on the call
To play your best known song of all

I wanted to hate you
That was my first choice
I wanted to hate you
Until I heard your voice

My, how rude, so impolite
All this on your night of nights
Little man of smallish frame
Crushed beneath your pop band name
Your table manners left behind
In an Oxford flat at suppertime
You came of range on center stage
Now sleep's not all your losing

Spirit of the West,"The ceiling's too familiar
Laying slack-jawed on my back
And the words spit out like puzzles
As she tries to fill the gap

But my lover's not my mother
And the hands that wipe my ass
Are the hands that once caressed me
I don't want them to detest me

And I will not burden those I love
I will not be a spoon-fed bird
Or beg for mercy from above
Oh let my cord become unplugged

The man from Holland left the room
But he never left his bed
On his birthday after brandy
He chose angel choirs instead

The first one was for sleeping
The next one took his breath
His wife left his bedside to reflect
In a rocking chair with a cigarette

And I will not burden those I love
I will not be a spoon-fed bird
Or beg for mercy from above
Oh let my cord become unplugged

Spirit of the West,"In the shadow of Modigliani
The German punkers lie
Each with a dog, on a bit of string
And filling half the sky
The Koln Cathedral offers calm
And quiet expectations
And then Elvis lit a candle on my day of revelations

Threw out a wish on a long piece of string
Felt a gentle tug and then pulled it in
Kept it in my hand 'til I reached the ground
Climbed up, brought it down on Ascension day

Didn't know how many steps, enough to make me sweat
I pressed my face against the screen
To be closer to the wind
The climb left stone, for iron stairs
That ended short of heaven
And it seemed the perfect place for prayer
On the day of my ascension

Threw out a wish on a long piece of string
Felt a gentle tug and then pulled it in, pulled it in
Kept it in my hand 'til I reached the ground
Climbed up, brought it down on Ascension day, Ascension day

Drifted through a door
To a room reserved for prayer
Grateful for the silence
I turned my thoughts to you
And they landed on your body
As they very often do
Wingtips fanned and stretched
For the guilding on the dome
I lit a prayer on borrowed flame
And sent my love back home, home

Threw out a wish on a long piece of string
Felt a gentle tug and then pulled it in, pulled it in
Kept it in my hand 'til I reached the ground
Climbed up, brought it down
Threw out a wish on a long piece of string
Felt a gentle tug and then pulled it in
Kept it in my hand 'til I reached the ground

I never liked a bleeding heart
But a bleeding heart's what I've become
With a broken funny bone
And a rubber crutch to lean upon
How can I turn from this mistake?
How can I bend? I know you'll break
When you love so willingly
Love so willingly
Love so willingly
Love me
I'm never one for casting doubt
But a shadow maker I've become

I can't recall just what it said

Spirit of the West,"There was writing on the walls
Looked like ""Circus"" there for me
We were smoking Karl Marx
With the junkies in the park
I watched the barmaid keeping track
By marking X's on our mats
And this is how it all began
On our first campaign to the Fatherland
The jet lag landed after hours
On an empty street in an Axis power
We broke the yardarm; it's too restricting
Cramped out style and cut our drinking down...
And this is how it all began
On our first campaign to the Fatherland
When we are falling
We got up to falling down
A canary yellow call-box
Gave me six marks worth of small talk
A broken conversation
Dulled by my intoxication

I offered up a weak embrace
'Till her song began to thin
Slowing to a trickle down her chin
Every head is cocked and still
Her troubles have gone on display
We knew her well before she lost her way
Should she drink on that prescription?
Mental's not an apt description
But even brilliance has it's place
When genius wears a twisted face
How'd she get so way-out there?
She's given us such a fright
I don't think she'll be coming back tonight
Hearing voices from the other side
In the darkness they keep her up
Trying to push her ball out of the cup
Should she drink on that prescription?
Mental's not an apt description
But even brilliance has it's place
When genius wears a twisted face
When genius wears a twisted face
Pull back the revelry
Send in the cavalry
The wagons formed a circle leaving her outside with me
To shiver, shake & freeze
And when she's done
Go find the phone
And make sure that her Mother's home
And then we'll need a volunteer
To get her there
'Cause she's not all here

You rode the wave that shot me down
Brought the St. John's lads around

We twisted you arm over Chinese
And led you astray
Offered the world as we know it
And a pittance in pay
And your fortune read
""Don't believe a word they've said""
Blood through your sleeve, I just couldn't
Believe that you'd been
To the shop where a prick of a needle
Embroiders the skin
We slept-on all full of drink
Pints of Guinness black as ink
Swung the hammer to ring the bell
The bell climbed up and then it fell
What got said got in-between
Sometimes whispers, sometimes screams
Got drunk with the Butcher at Walsall
On Beefeater's gin
Took a drag off your very first fag
Four decades in
But the finest hour you gave
When you turned and faced the wave

I can barely keep a grip on the pen I hold
Better get a grip on myself I'm told
I've grown bitterly, shameslessly,
Indescribably cold
I dove well into my cups
And wrote you a note full of
Wonderful smut
The things I'll do to you for us will be
Heavenly, Angel, Heavenly, Angel, Heavenly, Angel
The A to Z sits like the bible on the dash
Of our van that must've once carried bread
Oh, my splitting head

Drinking and smoking away
Great clouds of grey

And he escaped
He's a Moosehead muppet on
An ex-pat kick
Got a valid passport and he's proud of it

Spittin' corn
In the Yankee's eye?
Aways-away and gone awry
On a Wichita Monday night
And I do abhor

You can't ignore
Him
Our emissary's cause for concern
And a good old-fashioned lynching is all he's earned
For his country, his flag, his love of the land

Dragged in his fathers footsteps
Onto other people's doorsteps
To shoe-gaze through another afternoon
He's well turned out, his pants are pressed
He's dripping in his Sunday best
As the sun beats down in time to the sound
Of his father going on about the problems of the world
While Kevin stands uncounted at the door
Will Kevin get to heaven any soner?
Will father ever bother looking down?
When he sees the light
He sees the light
There must be empty chairs in the Kingdom hall
What with the summer holidays the flock is getting small
So he's marching 'round my neighbourhood
With a briefcase and a boy
But Kevin doesn't share the Soldier's Joy
I could see right through him
And the lawn was needing mowed
I closed the door and watched him turn to go
When he sees the light
He sees the light
He sees such light
I want him to change for me

Drunk on your own reflection
Propped up with desks and flags,
Eight chairs short of perfection

Scour the house, flip the wig,
Shake the tree,
Scour the house, flip the wig,

You've been abused and cheated,
Shat on you're beyond defeated
Those who rise stand in your name,
Then treat you roughly once they're seated

Your pen in one, the sword in the other
Satisfied the blessing is given
In God they trust only their way one way
Afraid of the other isms

Scour the house, flip the wig,

Not what God had made a child of His to be

I'm afraid that he'll amount to all of nothing

Two peas in a pod
Two of a kind

And happy's such a simple way to be

Far enough to make excuses

And we can all be happy here in ours
And we can still help out
Even go as far as to stop off at the Safeway drop some pennies in the jar

Let your wet pieces warm my bones
Ocean wide smell of freedom
Ocean wide taste of joy
I'm thirsting for euphoria
I'm drowning in this ocean of doubts
I'm fighting with my phobia
I'm thirsting for euphoria
Planets circulate around our heads
Listen carefully and you hear them say
Life is love and together we are God
Hold me tight, warm my bones, take me home
",Euphoria,1998
Spiritual Beggars,"Someone bring me the wine!
Well you know, know what you came for
Are you still blinded by hate
Well I try and I do understand you

You sure gonna gun down that whore
Well I try and I do understand you
Never me a woman that hasn't betrayed me
Someone bring me the wine!

Said it was a voice in your head

But can't you tell a demon from a friend
",Homage to the Betrayed,1998
Spiritual Beggars,"You see me as a looser
You see me as a clown
You see me as a drinker
Well I see you as a whore

She runs with a lie

I had swallowed too much pain
I had to ventilate some hate
Amongst sissy pop-rock stars
My fist started to talk
",Lack of Prozac,1998
Spiritual Beggars,"I've ended the vision of being sane
Tucked the image into bed
I'm sweating denials from the tip of my tongue

Bring a cup of mushroom tea
Take a swim inside of me

I'm broke but not tired

Let us loose ourselves
Fine Lady will you sail away with me
Let's climb to the top of my magic tree
We're getting bye baby
Just buy me another pint of hell
Take my hand baby
We'll find a better way
You're such a sad looking Lady
Come onboard, join the show
",Sad Queen Boogie,1998
Spiritual Beggars,"Nominate myself for what I want to achieve
Form my surroundings in relation to the seed
Smiles swims in a muddy breath
Thirsting pulsating blood
What else can I do, than to feed me with a bigger thirst
But I wonder why tears run dry
Mind control
Well I think I've lost mine
Let's climb the holy mountain
And eat the stars
Under the wisdom tree
We'll drink the weeping grass
I need my fire drug
To feel the flood
I'm selfdestructive baby
But a friendly one
You better leave me here alone
I need this night to heal my world
Send me a smile and I'll get bye
But let me drink my wine tonight
Too late to turn back pages
Ambush, a part of my life
Nowdays the sun won't shine
'cause like my head, its lost in a cloud
My heart is broken baby
But still it's pounding
Too long with pills and booze
My short-memory ain't what it should

",Superbossanova,1998
Spiritual Beggars,"She shone like the sun in those days
Whispered things into my head
Now I lie cold in my cell
Kissing pils to keep me sane

Angel of betrayal
Nowadays I like to meditate
With a couple of drinks
Sitting on my sofa

Watching a dumb TV
Gin and Tonic rules
Blood on the floor
Burn marks from cigarettes

My throat pleads for more
I tried to put my tongue into the cave
I prayed that
I was insured

I tried to put my tongue into the cave
But she led my mind astray
Angel of betrayl
I ought to kill the bitch

Letting off some steam

Drinking washes the gray away

Now the lungs of the universe
Are the lungs of my soul
I can feel it
I can sense it
Hallelujah Bless my soul

Haven't sold my soul
Monday morning I open a beer
And light a cigarr
Put my pen to paper and write I hate you all



",Blessed,2000
Spiritual Beggars,"He took me away
He showed me a way
The rivers where running too slow
The wizard said ""This is your name
Eternal Gladiator, my friend""
Higher and higher and higher I fly
Escaping the circle of clowns
With magic wisdom
With magic eyes
I'm eating the stars and the Moons
I'm going home
And guess what?
I'm not dead
Yes, I'm going home
Freedom is the name of my soul
Faster and faster and faster
I speed I'm beating the light
With my eyes I find thousands of universes
Inside every single atom



",Escaping the Fools,2000

I said, ""I know what you mean""
I gave her a little more red wine

Messengers from beyond

I caught a little cloud
My semen took off

You make me high, make me fly
Make me king of life
You shake the earth, shake the dirt
And we dance into the sun
Sacred words appear
Questions solved and we are gods
The goddess is for real



",The Goddess,2000
Spiritual Beggars,"He's never been arrested once
In his life
Never received a letter from the law
Quite insane
Never felt the demon riding his back
He is safe from harm
Never got hallucinations after

Logical thinking
Turns to Stupidity
Never had longer relations
With the female sex
Never been quite all alone
Poor little boy
Never had suicidal thoughts
Never quite understood
The true meaning of the word life



",Left Brain Ambassadors,2000
Spiritual Beggars,"Talk Into the blind zone - hiding
Cold as the moon now - freezing
We live in the shadows - with blindfolds
We die in the shadows - regretting
We didn't take the chance
Into the blind zone - bleeding
Cold as the moon now - we are freezing
While fire burns away
Take a trip into your magic soul
You'll find you've lived a thousand times
Let the magic talk and ride away
With no feeling of doubt into the sun
Gaze into the centre of yourself
Left brain people never find this path
They stand there wondering
How anyone can be so naive
To search with
Over and over
Breathe magic rhythm
Gaze into the centre of your dream
Fell the magic rhythm take you away
Let the magic talk and ride away
With no feeling of doubt into the sun
Over and over
Breathe magic rhythm
Over and over
Let the magic talk



",Let the Magic Talk,2000
Spiritual Beggars,"I've been down so long
Nothing ever changes
No matter how much I try
Got neighbours in my head
They're constantly arguing
About each step I take
My hands move like rattlesnakes
And my fingers fumble
Like they've just been invented
I bleed through the faking truth
I don't understand
All you fools
I keep drinking wine
Alone in the dark
You know the last drink
Is always the saddest
I have enough pills
To take me home
'cause this neighbour's song is doing it too slow



",Mantra,2000
Spiritual Beggars,"On dark rivers we float
Never to meet the releasing sea
Our souls hide
Deep inside our bodies
We got to feed our dreams
Nurse our dreams
Sounds of words that are spoken
Merely flirting with the truth
But we never find it
Never can we put the finger on it
Under a bad moon
We try to figure out
Which way to fall In this masquerading boat
You've got to wonder
Why most of us
Choose to stay



",On Dark Rivers,2000
Spiritual Beggars,"Looking up from an icy spot
Praying for the re-birth of the sun
If everything would explode
Would you breathe in or out?
Bring me a dog or a loaded gun
I'm fed up with all the people around
Most of them are to me
Like crisp breadcrumbs in my bed
And all I can say to you Is to fly with the riddle
To touch the moon
All I can say to you is try!
Passive thinking, stuck in the game
Souls hide in infected cells
If everything would explode
Would they breathe in or out?
Stranded, deep in civilisation
People I thought were like myself
Have turned into what we all once said
We hated so much
And all I can say to you
Is that fly with the riddle
To touch the moon
All I can say to you
Is that I try



",Per Aspera Ad Astra,2000
Spiritual Beggars,"Let me sing for pleasure
Let me drink my treasure
Up to the mountain of faith
Hit me again
While you kiss your left brain
You oppress you right brain
Ice-pops up in your arse
You run with the flock
Our presence is a saga
A shore beyond
The horizon
Save Your Soul
When I read Bukowski
And when I read Martinus
I feel magic in my soul
Boiling me warm
Do you dream of freedom?
Or do the demons tell you?
There is nothing you can loose
If you run with the flock
I'm too cool
To be a fool



",Save Your Soul,2000
Spiritual Beggars,"Sedated every night
I had my wine and my joints
A couple of sleeping pills
Tears of tiredness dripping down
But after a while
I began to lose my song
After a while It wasn't fun no more
Sedated when morning comes
Sitting with a troubled head
Sedated but the sun don't shine
Await my suicide



",Sedated,2000
Spiritual Beggars,"Don't know where I'm going
Don't know where I've been
I'm back in the hazy woods
I hear the mountains bark
Until the morning comes
I'll rest my head in my arms
Until the morning line I stay awake
I see no point in
Staying sane I sell my days to keep
My demons in control
I'm galloping towards death
I'm not apologising, not begging
When you reach knowledge
You will understand

And I saw a man that appeared to be just an old wino;
Sitting on the streets, telling the people 
About Jesus as they passed by.
And because he was all raggedy and dirty,
People would just laugh and make fun
Of the old man and walk on by.
And he said because of the way I am,
No money, no fancy clothes, no fine homes and cars,
A lot of people consider me as nothing,
And say I don't know what I am talking about.
But there is one thing that he said 
That really touched my heart and stayed on my mind,
When that old man looked up and said...

I'm just a nobody trying to tell everybody,
About somebody, who can save anybody.

I'm just a nobody trying to tell everybody,
About somebody, who can save anybody.

And he said, I've had so many problems in my life,
That I just couldn't deal with so I started drinking,

But things got worse, so I said, 
'Lord I give up I'm in your hands', 
And that's when my life began to change,
But these people think

I'm just a nobody trying to tell everybody,
About somebody, who can save anybody.

That's my life, that's my home,
Ain't got nowhere else I could go.

To our padded lives
Our hearts turn black
Pursue the dollar signs

The beating heart is the only sound
Close our eyes as we hit the ground
And wake up blinded

We're all burnt out
From working overtime
From eating pills that
Control our state of mind
We drink ourselves asleep
Just to forget the day
We medicate again
Just to stay awake

Are we living just to die
Or are we just dying to live

We don't need them anymore

SPKT,"A long long time ago
I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

Splender,"""So you're thinkin' about tomorrow
and all those simple things you think you might like
but you've been sipping in the daylight, you see
well I've been trying to keep things light

So you're looking for approval
to do those stupid things your father might like
well you might kill youself to get it, you see
but it might never make things right
it just might leave you more uptight...

And all the things within the world
and all the boys and all the girls
who never seem to get enough
they save it for later, you see
All the saints and all the freaks and all the strange philosophies
the novelties and memories
they save it for later you see,
they save it for later you see...

So now you're looking for some revelation
but you're still lying there, still in your bed
well I've been spilling with emotions
but have you heard a word I've said...

So you're thinking about tomorrow
by reliving every minute of your past
well I'm just living for the moment, you see
'cause I'm just trying to make it last
'cause I've just seen it go too fast

And all the things within the world
and all the boys and all the girls
who never seem to get enough
they save it for later, you see
All the saints and all the freaks and all the strange philosophies
the novelties and memories
they save it for later you see,
save it for later you see...

And the best part of my life
is the worst part of your day
And the best part of my song
is the last part you ever play...

And all the things within the world
and all the boys and all the girls
who never seem to get enough
they save it for later, you see
All the saints and all the freaks and all the strange philosophies
and everyone who never speaks
they save it for later you see,

Then all the things within the world
and every boy and every girl
who never seems to get enough
they save it for later, you see
Every time you build it up and put it in your paper cup
it never seems to be enough
you save it for later you see,
you save it for later you see,

In a house on a hill
In suburbanville
People cry in a circle
Dead man in the middle

Not a church or a building
With enormous ceilings
Is where we all fall apart

Watch my tech rise, feel the shells that it spit out

Nigga with the 6 story, throw em off the cliff

The small thug with a slug put a mark on his wrist
A tattoo of pyramids, puttin hollows in clips
Peeped your gat, jammed tight, Ross your lookin to riff (what the fuck?)
QB's type shit, cause we runnin your clique
See me in the drop, with your six, sayin she snitched
But never that, 'cause-o, high beam through the window 
My lookouts move slow, they heard you never blast though
Got a safe in your crib, sham, you know the code
Search, spoke out, 3, 2, 1, that's zero
Took the see notes and flip mode left on the quietest note
Swallowed these then cleared your throat

Walk wit face ice grilled up

Let me move first so I can park my shit on the curb

Patch his body with gauze
Mop up the floors
Splatter nigga's blood on the walls

Bust that nigga's shit
Make the nigga suffer for yours

Blow that nigga's family up just for fronting

(Spliff Star)
Yo where the bitch that was with the nigga?

(Rah Digga)
Caught her with the left
Choked her by the halter, bitch bloody to death
Then the ho starts crying 'bout her hair and nails
Gettin' stomped with the shells...

(Rampage)
...I heard the bitch-nigga yell
Caught Peter, man, by the speaker
Looked me in the eye and didn't even know
I was his brother's keeper
Slap the nigga, through him in the sleeper

(Spliff Star)
Deeper and deeper
Nigga's vision start to black out, straight Grim Reaper
Still lookin for that nigga Peter

(Baby Sham)
Chill, let's bounce
Spliff is high on 'bout a half an ounce
If he's hiding, we gon' find him on the eye of a needle

(Rah Digga)
Yeah that's the shit I'm talking bout
Let's go fuck with his peoples
Nigga got a sister?

(Busta Rhymes)

(Baby Sham)
Chill Spliff, we gon' trail this nigga's bitch ass home
Rush the crib

(Rah Digga)
Kill the bitch while she ain't even looking
Still all fucked up from the last ass-whuppin
Chop the bitch up

(Baby Sham)
Caught up in this foul mix-up
Tore wide open, bitch'll need a major stitch-up
Dig a ditch up where no blood-hound'll sniff up

(Busta Rhymes)
Yo, bury that bitch, don't leave a scent for dogs to pick up

(Rampage)
Oh shit, yo I hear somebody coming 
>From the upstairs bathroom where I hear the water running

(Spliff Star)
Fuck that! There the motherfucker go right there
I want a morgue for him, make that nigga's crew pall-bear
Yo let me lift him

(Rah Digga)
Wait, before that, let me go kiss him

(Spliff Star)
Put five in his head and wrap him in the bedspread
Fled from the scenery without nobody seeing me

(Busta Rhymes)
My squad sworn to secrecy 
If anybody ask about him we ain't seen him recently
I got your back

Busta:  Any nigga ever try to front

A lot of brothers don't like me
Screw me when the site me
Pop a lot of shit, but they scared to death to fight me
See me on the stage wit Bust on some rap shit
They see me in the club wit Bust on some lap shit
Befrore this rap shit, it was the corner crack shit
But now i'm on the world on some autograph shit
Spliff-a-Spliff drop the 4 5th round the waiste
So if you want war, let me deal with the case
Ain't nothin to it, brother i got the heart to do it
Blast in, cover the sidewalk wit ya fluid
Ya niggas stupid, ya got brains, brother use it
Ain't nithin gonna stop my black ass, from gettin cash
On the real, that's how deeply i feel
A born again hooligan, hungry for this meal
Got the iced- out platinum rings that you want to steal
Come get it, watch ya whole shit get wetted
Street colonel cat, got enough cats to set it
So if you ain't doin shit , ya niggas need to dead it
Watchin my money, it cost bullets in ya tummy
It's all ral here, there ain't no fear here
You mess around here, you catch ya death here
I mean it, you could front, but you believe it
Nigga guard your life before i turn around and steal it
Look into my eyes and analyze what you deal wit
If I can't find you, I take it out on who you be wit
Type of bitch nigga i would never smoke a tree wit

Nowadays we blow like smoke out the exhaust
Contamenatin smoke still makin me cough
I mean we bout to turn this wak shit off
Wak niggas is sick wit the flu sippin chicken broth
Now here's another winnin ripoff
Gettin money, eatin fine cuisine like buttered shrimp and rice pilaf
Stay heavily armed, Alakun Salom
Watch you bitch ass suffer til you got to beg for ya moms
Now turn the truck on, get ya fuck on, got you stuck on
Stupid right between yo legs, get yo suck on
drink bottles, treat niggas like Gus D'Amoto
Eat avacado, soon to go purchase a white Diablo
Niggas know my motto, lets get money, Macho Camacho
Applaud another rapper, lets go collect the nacho
Oh shit, hope you don't slip, another murder commit
The episode comin on Teen Summit
Little corny nigga talk too quick, think he slick
Throwin a brick, yappin off, lyin on his dick
Too late, you'll be the type o' nigga that I love to hate
Brutally bust ya shit like a nigga turned primate
Time of the year, feel great, clean slate
Throw a nickle plate, property shoppin to but a landscape
How they say street niggas 'ill never have
Now we possess the 5S wit the cherry red Nav
Doin things like signin graffiti on autograph
Gettin so much money staff calculate the math
Laugh you know the half, eyin in the stash
Mediatin watch the wind blow the blunt ash
You had a blast , now how long you gonna last
Ice grillin for nothing, you make yoself ass
Brace yoself one more time, know what i mean dun
Violate cross the foul line, it be yo last one

Have your fam call christ
Flipmode battle for mics
All my shit be high priced
I'm slashing dikes
Feel me
Liftin thugs out they crease it's quickly
Shift two keys in two weeks
And gross forty g's
Report me
And live shortly
Slouch cat livin off calibil breeze
You want to get involved
Better grip on tight
Take the next flight
We got it locked on the next bike

[Rampage]
Check it out
I got the eye of a tiger
That's plan to go higher
My squad is on fire
And till death do us
If the label want to sue us
Yo I'm taking the reels
I'm the man with the gat that be ready to peel
I'm the one next to Spliff when it's time to ill
I'ma show by astro red cross and blue shields
Watch us make a move
Catch us on smokin groove
Rules house of blues
MTV News
On the bus with my Flipmode loco (loco)
Takin flicks
Hittin chicks by the dozen (dozen)
Keep a shot runnin
Now I'm on a journey
It take you twenty light years to burn me (burn me)
If you want beef call my attorney
All that other wack shit don't concern me
I'm being felt
I got a title under my belt
I'm out to get the wealth

Peace to my Outz clique
Bitches that I bounce with
Everybody else get the gas like Auschwitz
Like, flows for real like a rap bitch should
Type takin niggas out like they packaged goods

Straight up and down we run the underground like H. Tubman

Why are you ignoring us
Running into hiding and avoiding us
Niggas on the low be recording us
My rhyme flow remain poisonous
Thus
Yo your shit sound wack still annoying us
We alive nigga ain't no destroying us
You better off if you come join with us
Perpendicular
Or analyzing my whole molecular
In particular
Roll with my squad or go singular
I ain't into bitches who fuck animals like caligula
More hot shit so get your water sprinkler
Fire extinguisher
Rhyme prime minister
C'MON!
Never mistake me for nobody else
Another blast make you shit on yourself
I hope all y'all know that I always master the art
Rip you apart
Put your hand on my heart
Flipmode number one on the charts
Solo or collective
My perspective the objective
Is to win
All praises due to my squad one in the same
Cherish every blessing I have to make y'all witness my name
Burn another calorie
Come inside my galaxy
Put your money where your mouth is double your salary
Hey dude you know we stay rude high on a aquelude
Bust your shit bouncin in a Honda Prelude
Let's G off
Nigga ease off
I make you breeze off
Brickfull make you rip your jeans off

CHORUS",To My People,1998
Spliff Star,"Yeah, where you think you goin'. Where you think you goin'.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's the unit for the 9-8.
Flipmode Squad baby. That's my word.
All you sucker MC's, try to hide this stuff. Come back here.
Where you think you goin', nigga. Come back here.
Y'all niggaz ain't seein' Jack. Shit !!!

Aiiyo, speak the truth.
Too short to let it hurt. Some talk dirt, and be the first slangin' hertz.
Freestylin' of the hum of the birds.
Fall back when I shine on my shine, two shows follow behind.
It's a fucked up vehicle. Switchin' my lines.
Hotel asks a nigga: ""Could I share my dimes"".
Picture that, when you scared to draw toes.
Playin' me close.
Rollin with the dogs wearin' yesterdays clothes.
Left a fouled sin into my squad without permition.
I started dissin', hopin' you listen. Pay attention.
Fatheresly. The shadow leads you back to the hood.
You want to switch up because some niggas stalked you up.
Or is the fact that they thought you was rollin' with us.
Left you all draged, like two trains crashin' it up.

Aiiyo, Spliff Starr drama, bullpen personna
Type of nigga that would sell crack to your mama
Take the cash you gave me and buy marijuana
Check me boy, in some turbo (?)
Back in the days I bubble drugs like a sauna
Make a pussy boy kill himself like Nirvana
Get 'em like goose feathers, cold weather rock the bamma
Lie in front of the jury, D.A., and Your Honor
I represent street niggas, carry heat niggas
Play for keeps niggas, ain't nothin 'bout me sweet, niggas
I stay token, gun butt your skull open
If you fuck wit my squad nigga where you think you goin'?

[Chorus]
Where you think you goin'.
Where you think you goin'.
Aiiyo, what you doin nigga.
Where you think you goin'.
Where you think you goin'.
Where you think you goin'.
Aiiyo, what you movin for.
Where you think you goin'.
Where you think you goin'.
Where you think you goin'
Aiiyo, what you doin nigga.
Where you think you goin'.

You think that you can run (ha)
You think that you can hide (haa)
You best believe you still comin'. I think you better slide.
While you stay bitchin', another nigga missin'.
Bodies snatch you up.! Behold the cream. .
Caught in hells kitchen. My trigger fingers itchin'.
Nervous system's fucked up.
That's why my nerves twitchin'.
Enslave your mentality. Nigga brain fried.
We after you, runnin' sergeon for a free ride.
Where you think you goin' son ?
We gon' catch you soon.
We here to take over this shit.
Pour the tycoon.
Blossom and gloom. Capture any nigga sober in a little dark room.
Ha ha ha ha ha.

Uh oh. You lil league boy I know your beats.
You sound bullshitely, You rock .
Swearin' you to ball, when you know you're wack.
In a studio settin' of a reverands track.
Boy ! Rah gets busy, my shit be way slaver.
Curder rapper Ernest like the one slave labour.
One first be like the bitch tap oil.
Loyal to my niggas. Enemies are fucked around, and riders rappin for you.
Spot stays blowin. Goin' to the top.
Where you think you're goin'.
Pocket stay throwin'. Smooth like the lowin'.
Rap chick flowin'.
Where you think you're goin.

[Chorus]

I'm a hard man at work.
Lyrical expert.
Look out before you get hurt.
Bury the dirt. Line for line.
Ramp I be the mastermind.
That's be full time watch me shine.
I know the seven sign.
I'm rich, and still life is a bitch.
Losin' snitch like camey fake beggar.
Jim Baker. I take you're life like the undertaker.
Flipmode moneymaker, make that kill for this paper.
It's on the poppin'.
People want to know when the album droppin'.
Start talkin'. Keep walkin'.
Flatbush New York and we live for you.
Sling for you.
My squad struck oil.
Now we coppin' platinum things.
Diamond rings. Nice cosy things.
And a party for free.
From the tunnel to envy.
Ramp's the rugged MC.
My squad keeps growin.
Where you think you goin.'

Chief gunnin' to.
Splash rain potters pooves.
Fuck is you. Start stand peach.
Chuff for choose.
Scoffer booves.
Now low muscles moves.
Smash crew like statue with jungle jewels.
Son gets school, wit the dummin' crew.
Pay double dues. Cradle to the graves, hustle grooves.
Flesh tissue. Death kiss you. No love for you.
Oh.
And me the most wanted fool.
Unfriendly in horrical, make power moves.
Snatch colors loose. A  dollar rule.
Raw business shit in my hands, and shakes yours with it.
Till you 'cause fridget.
Local or long distance.
Gets master served.
And crash a burn
Like James Evans when I'm blowin'.
Fuck is wrong wit cha.

Where you think you're goin'.
Where you think you're goin'.
