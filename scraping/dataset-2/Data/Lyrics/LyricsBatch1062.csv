Sunshine Anderson,"You had to be hiding from me all this time
Making me wait so very long for you
'Cause out of nowhere you just appeared before my eyes
Letting me know that there'd be no more lonely nights

Where have you been all of my life?
What took me so long to get it right?
Where have you been all of my life?
(Tell me)

How did you know when it was time to make your move
And how did you know this heart of mine was this needing?
Being with you helps me realize that dreams come true
Next time don't take your sweet old time
To bring your love to me, oh yeah

Where have you been all of my life?
What took me so long to get it right?
Where have you been all of my life?

To be honest, it's not fair
That so much time went by
Before we had a chance to share
Our love, we should've been together
But it's better late than never

Where have you been all of my life, baby?
Where have you been all of my life? Tell me

Where have you been all of my life?
What took me so long to get it right?
Where have you been all of my life?
",Where Have You Been,2001
Sunshine Anderson,"Hope you know
As far as I am concerned we're through
I am tired of keeping up with you
What made you think you that you could beat the odds?
Running round chasing all them broads
And you can't even say it ain't true
The way you treatin' me it ain't cool
Go ahead and be the playa you gonna be minus me

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
So how about you do you
And I will be me
I am so ready to move along

I was there six months ago when you had lost your job
And you ain't even have no car
You was coming in and out back and forth
And it was me funding your child support
'Coz you didn't have a dollar to you name
And you still don't have a dollar to your name
And if I stick around it will be a shame

[Chorus: ]",You Do You,2001
Sunshine Anderson,"Before you came I thought every man was the same
Thinkin' to myself that it's a dog gone shame
Then when we first met I didn't quite know what to expect
But we've been together ever since and I have no regrets

You mean so much to me
I'm so happy to be your woman
Love is so had to find
Which is why I'm thankful that I'm your woman

You and me somehow connected spiritually
Connected mentally, connected physically
And so I believe all the obstacles that we've
Encountered along the way makes us strong today

You mean so much to me
I'm so happy to be your woman
Love is so had to find
Which is why I'm thankful that I'm your woman

Many days I feared I would end up all alone
Never finding a love I can call my own
But then you came along and swept me off of my feat
And for the first time in my life I feel complete

You mean so much to me
I'm so happy to be your woman
Love is so had to find
Which is why I'm thankful that I'm your woman

You mean so much to me
I'm so happy to be your woman
Love is so had to find
Which is why I'm thankful that I'm your woman

You mean so much to me
I'm so happy to be your woman
Love is so had to find
Which is why I'm thankful that I'm your woman
",Your Woman (Interlude),2001
Sunshine Anderson,"Tonight I'm giving you
The chance to show and prove
What you're really all about
Even though it's hard
I'm letting down my guard

There's been times in the past
When true love is what I thought I had
But that wasn't the case

I wish I could erase
The times I've hurt so bad
And now I find myself, here with you
Just as nervous as can be

Trying to give love a chance to live inside of me
Tonight I'm giving you
The chance to show and prove
What you're really all about

Even though it's hard
I'm letting down my guard

I cannot lie
You more than caught my eye
I'm really liking what I see
And now that I know if you and I can grow
If I never let the past go

Tonight I'm giving you
The chance to show and prove
What you're really all about
Even though it's hard
I'm letting down my guard

Tonight I'm giving you
The chance to show and prove
What you're really all about
Even though it's hard
I'm letting down my guard

You seem like, your mama raised you right
It was nice of you to invite
Me out for a night on the town
And so far I like how you get down

Tonight I'm giving you
The chance to show and prove
What you're really all about
Even though it's hard
I'm letting down my guard

Tonight I'm giving you
The chance to show and prove
What you're really all about
Even though it's hard
I'm letting down my guard

Getcha money, it's tha come up
Nada nada, get the whole thing
Do it big.. yeaaaaaaaaaaaa

[Petey Pablo]
Time is tickin', with a hole in the hourglass
Startin' guns, been five
And I ain't tryin to come in last
Ain't no need for me to be upset
And ain't no need for you to be mad
If a man got his own pad
And whether he want forty-karat
He gonna have to do that there, prove yourself
The greed words, you had that there
What a dream, he would always had
And it ain't right, but that's the way it is
In this life, you don't get to deal
You can climb to the roulette wheel
I want something I can leave my kids
The memories of what they wish their daddy had did
If I could leave them all a couple of mill
And show em how this cruel world can really get the best of a nigga
I'd show em life through the eyes of a demon
The only thing that matters is the root of all evil

[Chorus-Sunshine Anderson (Petey Pablo)]
Getcha money made (getcha meoney), it's tha come up (it's tha come up)
Not a little bit (nada nada), get the whole thing (get the whole thing)
Gotta do it big (do it big), to sum it up (yeeaaaaaaa)
We just wanted it, tha come up
[This time through added libs by Sunshine Anderson]
Getcha money made (getcha meoney), it's tha come up (it's tha come up)
Not a little bit (nada nada), get the whole thing (get the whole thing)

We just wanted it, tha come up

[Petey Pablo]
I ain't got time to be bothered with ya'll
I got a hundred problems and there's only one way I'm gonna solve em
I'm gonna have to get my grind on
Hustlin' and using my muscle tryin to bring the prize home
I ain't the only nigga with issues and I know that
But I ain't concerned with nobody's issues by mine Jack
I invented jail, invited(??) em back
Hell, I'm still in that
The only thing left now is six feet of cold black
Flower bringin' and church singin'
In a grave stiffed up and stankin'
And you can tell that I've been thinkin' can't cha(can't cha)
Now maybe you can understand my anger
And while I'm still out there candy slangin'
And while I'm out there, chasin' them banks
And why I gotta smoke a pound of dank
You never know when your day gonna be your last day
Better get this money when it should've been made (maaade)

[Chorus]
[Petey Pablo]
I'm sorry it had to come to this (to this)
I know I'm really disrespecting your family members
That really love to care
It ain't ya'll, cause ya'll know me better than this
I guess it's just the way that I'm is
And maybe I'm a deadbeat kid
Maybe I really don't deserve to live
Maybe they should have gave me life in prison
Only takin' what they give me
Cause out here, I'm stuck in menace
Cause out here, I'm a threat to niggas
I'm like smokin' and pumpin' gas
Light the fire loose to the filter (whew)
You don't feel the vibe we givin'
Cause if you'd did, you'd done been the hell up
You'd done been stickin' ahead of your business
You'd of been, shittin' embarrassed to hit me
You'd of been, sent them boys to get me
Nah ah ah
And I don't repent cause I ain't that nigga
And anything I done, I meant it (you meant it, you meant it)

It's getting kind of heavy

See, I was raised in a good home with morals and all
Got my degree, made mama proud, and worked really hard

Thugged-out, gold grill, Hustler with a caddy

Said you would always love me faithfully

You had jumped off, I was in denial
So decided before we walked down the aisle
Said, ""I do"" but now I feel you don't

How you ain't gon' fuck! bitch out me?
I'm the god damn reason you in VIP
CEO you don't have to see ID
I'm young, wild, and strapped like Chi-Ali
Blow! We ain't got nothing to worry about
Whoop ass, let security carry em out
Watch out for the medallion my diamonds are wreckless
Feels like a midget is hanging from my neckless
I pulled up wit a million trucks
Looking, smelling, feeling like a million bucks-ahh!
Pass the bottles, the heat is on
We in the huddle all smoking that Cheech & Chong
What's wrong?! The club and moon is full
And I'm looking for a thick young lady to pull
One sure shot way to get em outta them pants
Take note to the brand new dance, like this

[Chorus]

Go on wit ya big ass! lemme see something
Tell ya little friend he can quit mean mugging
I'm lit and I don't care what no one thinks
But where the FUCK is the waitress at wit my drinks?!
My people outside and they can't get in
We gon' rush the back door and break em in
The owner already pissed cause we sorta late
But our time and our clothes gotta coordinate
Most girls lookin right some looking a mess
That's why they spilling drinks all over ya dress
But Louie Vuitton bras all over your breasts
Got me wanting to put hickies all over ya chest
C'mon! we going party tonight
Y'all use mouth to mouth bring the party to life
Don't be scurred, show another part of your life
The more drinks in your system the harder to fight!

[Chorus]

Stand up! Stand up!
Stand up! Stand up!

Damn right the Fire Marshall wanna shut us down
Get us out so someone can gun us down
We was two songs away from getting some cutta
Now we one song away from tearing the club up
Move over! Luda got something to say
Do it now cause 'tomorrow' ain't promised 'today'
Work wit me! let's become one with the beat
And don't worry bout me stepping all over ya feet

Sunz of Man,"Yo, there's still time

As the door close, the cold wind blows
Down America like the Wall of Jericho
Some will walk the sheet close
Many are called but few are chose

Who knows until the day they be exposed
UFO's surround the globe
The world is prepared to explode
So I grab hold of the North Pole

Not tryin' to meet the lost soul, at the crossroad
We're bein' sucked up into the black hole
Young becomes old, mighty clouds roll
Unfold the scrolls that were foretold, by the forefathers

The end of the world saga, streets flooded with lava
Mommas and papas, toddlers, hip-hoppers, and rastas
Rock stars and mobsters, above streets in helicopter
Filled with doctors readin' the death roster

Guts spillin' out like pasta, sky, misty, often tipsy
From off the whiskey, the gypsy, told me, my chances, were risky
Cops, pull up and frisk me but never could they get me, too shifty
I will go, into my dungeon, and summon up the second comin'

People started runnin', aliens with hair like Rastafarians
Captured, placed inside of aquariums, studied by scientists
This is it, 'The Apocalypse', I see the mother ship above the cliff
Over Egypt, it made me sea sick, I see the eclipse
And the abyss, the night shifts

It's repentance day
Repent for your sins
When the gates of Heaven open up
And Hell's closin' in

It's repentance day
Repent for your sins
When the gates of Heaven open up
And Hell's closin' in

The archangel imprison my soul into a prism
Usin' cell division and molecular collision within me
He listen and analyze the heartbeat and rhythms
Of children livin' brutalized

My ears became used to the vibes of ruined lives
Sounds in the chamber I was hidden in
Was so spine-tinglin' I was tremblin'
Envisionin' the fear, here within a new millennium

Where rain became toxic, the air's stale and noxious
Comets hit co-ops with force that made blocks split
Flocks tried to escape a fate that made even hard rocks slide
As nuclear dropped out of the sky, causin' burns too severe

For hydro peroxide and sodium oxide, deep down outta basements
Fish turned lopsided and upside down from atomic face lifts
Through the blackness I saw John the Baptist, on the atlas
Holdin' the masters to my Psalm under his arm

But long before I even wrote 'em
23 elders each wrote me a Psalm
And placed them within my motor neurons
It contained the approximate date of, 'The Apocalypse'

Deposited in scripts of the 20th century prophets
The clock ticks, tick, tick, tick upon the land borders
I count down the manslaughter
Military camcorders under ocean waters

Red October causin' fish to grow arms, legs, tits
And double heads, mutating the eggs as the radiation spreads
Over the water beds, I watch Mother Nature as she bled
Grym, was placed in skin casing to begin lacing hymns

Through the basement, won't be no escapin'
From the South to the North
Where you run ten paces and your face is fallin' off

It's repentance day
It's repentance day
Repent for your sins
When the gates of Heaven open up
And Hell's closin' in

It's repentance day
Repent for your sins
When the gates of Heaven open up
And Hell's closin' in

Raised in Hell, waitin' for angels like Rafael
Comin' from space to trace, they race
Thrown in jail cells I had a purpose since
The sperm cell, to bail out and get braille

For the blinded children in Israel
Kids kill forget the bill
For, dollar bills and drug deals by the mayor
Controls the people livin' legal

Sit back and chill, until time will reveal
Two thousand and one holy men with force fields
Levitatin' space ships, earthquake hits, United States splits
Projects turn to snake pits

Secrets of the Masons came to revelations
Babylon destroyed by the nations aggravations
Riots in the train stations, criminals grabbin' cops
Snakes rattlin', angels draggin'

Seven head dragons out the Roman empire
Surrounded with fire, liars in the Pentagon
Drop their nuclear bombs, ran, panic
But still, was trapped on the planet

Died before the mother ship landed
Only the chosen ones understand it, some can't
'Cause of TV brain damage, no time to be romantic
This day your independence and repentance, pentance, pentance

""Now I see the light, my whole life is moving in one direction
I see that now, there never has been any choice for me""

Repentance day
Repent for your sins
When the gates of Heaven open up
And Hell's closin' in

Repentance day
Repent for your sins
When the gates of Heaven open up
And Hell's closin' in

Did you repent today?
Repent for your sins
When the gates of Heaven open up
And Hell's closin' in

Babylonians ecstatic moon the sinkin of Atlantis
(Be the one soul original black filled with melanin
Goin out like represent Kuwait in two thousand)

[Ice-T]
Brothers gonna have to put themself in check
Three strikes you in the penzo, checked to your neck
Your woman cries, your baby grows up alone
Talkin through a three inch glass on a two way phone
You tell me brothers got no options today
You best to listen to the Ice closely fool, crime don't pay
Gas and dope bullets and coke ain't the way
You need to march with the Nation on Atonement Day, represent

[Chuck D]
Now, to all my brothers we be rhymin like this
Yeah I can handle, but they can't kill it mill or dismantle it
And we can leave the component alone
Show all my brothers a brother instead of negro
Crackers in the back obscene knahmean
But I've been knockin em out the box like ??
So on the single we be flowin at the lingo
Comin together, not solo like Mandingo

Right here, hangin with my brothers and we showin no fear

Right here, if you represent then throw your hands in the air

In unity there is power, none can devour
Hour after hour, we shower

Imagine us travellin back to Nazareth
Most fabulous
To raise up the black dead slaves like Lazarus
When I catch rays through the blaze holy essays
No more death days and vexed slaves possessed in caves
Yo it's the last days and times we gots to raise your mind
Brothers walk around dumb different and blind
Pregnant Earths always carry eggs
I pledge to never fall off the ledge
and blacks remain family like Sister Sledge

[Shorty]
God prepared the table for us, in the presence of our enemy
Now we soon to be, one in unity
One two three I'm a G
But the God inside is that G I chose to be
The world is a stage and everybody plays a part
I'm not considered, the one with a sensitive heart
When I say black man you say go
Black man GO black man GO

[DA Smart]
Somebody stole me, you took me from Kunta to Toby
and mold me, in a way that you freed me but still hold me
What you tryin to pull? Eatin us like cannibals

Now you tryin to use integration just to fool us
Like Malcolm said, we been hoodwinked and bamboozled
Mama cryin, and I ain't lyin
I'm going to Washington for justice, I'ma get it, or die tryin
Don't hesitate, he's at the gate
And that's a million black men in one place to set it straight
So black women applaud the black God
I'm DA Smart, with the million man march

Damn that's how you know the world about to end
Rain hail snow earthquakes and a million black men
Upon the God indivisible
With liberty and justice for all cause why'all done made us miserable
With this AmeriKKKan nightmare
That's why October 16th we gon be right there like yeah
The same niggaz that you want gone
Well we about a million deep on your front lawn
It's goin on from here to Abraham Lincoln's statue
And every brother here thinkin yeah we need to holla at you
About this overdue bidness
With the Black Muslim, Christian Jew and Jehovah Witness
To get this out in the open the only way

If you're blind to the wicked ways 
The devil plays mad tricks on your mind (check it out) 
If you're blind of the wicked ways (yeah check it out) 
The devil plays mad tricks on your mind (yo) 

The President just ordered the Navy to hit the borders of Haiti 
Slaughter babies from the waters of Euphrates 
Maybe they sent germ that's polluted our sperm 
And made us live uncircumcised in the serpent eyes 

And told us certain lies, and each day a servant dies 
But in the halls of Pharaoh the walls are narrow 
And religion is like a prison for the seekers of wisdom 
This be the dance of the graveyard 

So do the spank with the dead zombie 
Here comes the tanks of a Red Army 
The real Jew is you, Jeremiah fourteen and two 
Enforced by the Hebrew 

Ya hovered by the eagle, America is evil 
Let no man deceive you, beat you, or mistreat you 
The tribe of Edem, stole your freedom 
And Edem means redneck 

I'm throwin bullets in my Tec 
Nah, I'm goin out like Joshua 
With a pen, an army, and an apocalypse 

[Chorus]

I remember 
The six doctors, that wanted to take my brain into a laboratory 
Destroy me, since birth 
My baby talk was psychic thoughts 

Flashbacks, all the past blacks trapped in the present 
Killin for dead presidents, where every ghetto residence 
is evidence, and the future, there will never be none 
If we don't be-come, unity 

Or get them devil made guns, and leave them demons bleedings 
Give em BACK with tons of speeding bullets 
Fuck your tech-nology, it's trick-knowledgy 
Tellin lies to my vision, I was given, enough time 
To master, the criminology 
And Mr. Pastor, teachin demonology 
Words of dope knowledge, I demolish 
Evil men, with an easy win 
When my thoughts are spaced out, come down to EARTH 
The devil crawls, 'cause he's only, jealous 
And a victim of the unholy ghost 

Chorus: 
If you're blind to the wicked ways 
The devil plays mad tricks on your mind (mind) 
If you're blind to the wicked ways 
The devil plays mad tricks on your mind 

Verse Three: 7th Ambassador 
He listens to the cries in the distance 
of the next victim, wishin, that he had some assistance 
And right before his eyes it appeared 
Beware when the shadow caster, demon master's in the near 
He blocked the true light from your sight 
And transformed your brightest days, into your darkest nights 
I had your blind man praisin the grave 
Cause he feel the cross, that lays in the dirt 
And think he's in the church, not even aware 
That death is near, and he's one step from his grave 
A naive mental slave if he had, his third eye sparked 
He mighta been scopin 
Them demons that be lurkin in the dark 
Always keep your glowin eye open 
By knowin who your enemies be 
I can see you but you can't see me 
Escape from your chains like, Great Houdini 
And disappear, like a majestic genie, in midair 
Vanish, that's my advantage 
And then I transform to a hurricane storm 
And rain holy water, for seven days 
And seven nights, the chosen ones spark the light 
Of the Sun, that's killin off villains by the ton 
Sealin all the doors to the Hells, correct spells 
That were cast on my peeps that were weak 
Made to keep, my peeps in a deep sleep 

Verse Four: 60 Sec. Assassin 
Behold! The angels out the heaven 
Who professes a whole new rap, session reposessin the gossip 
back so black, better hand over your act, or trapped, to 
Seven fifty three, who have received the law 
By the dispositions of angels, and have not, kept it 
Transgressed it, better burn your testaments 
Ain't nothing changed niggaz is gettin arrested 
Beat down like wrestling 
On the count, of false impression, indiscretion 
Advise em all with the glimpse, of a third eye 
The silent sleep, and wicked 
I work you niggaz out like physics, I blast out from the heart 
of Brooklyn, like an arrow, just stick to my point 
It's narrow, I shoot niggaz back, into the time 
like Pharaoh, I smoke up on your brain, leave it 
burnt as Sahara, that leaves desert, with a rock storm 
Leavin niggaz buried and puttin them at Lou's lawn 
Headquarters, of the Zoo, what part, wasn't reviewed 
Or didn't you understand 
I'm drillin niggaz back under the surface of the land 

Outro: Killah Priest 
Show the righteous man, stand in great lonliness 
Before the face, of such that have afflicted him 
And may no account of his labels 
For they see it, they shall be troubled with terrible fear 
And shall, be amazed at the strangeness of his salvation 
So far beyond all they were lookin for",Wicked Ways,1998

Pregnant Earths always carry eggs
I pledge to never fall of the ledge
And blacks remain family like Sister Sledge

As we struggle in the jungle of sin, my thoughts are militant
Destroyin the ignorance, buildin the innocent
Teachin infants infinite knowledge
That wasn't taught in high schools or college
My representation is with the thirty million man destination
Washington, D.C., war with the masons
The only celebration is Satan's elimination
The past education at the present is revelations
The future's our creation, elevation of the nation

[Chorus]

Yo around Red (16) October
BROOKLYN ZOO attack like cobra
Killin warrior soldiers in D.C., you face Jehovah all over
The darkside, I ride tracks to provide
Elementive intelligence while you fake MC's hide
LEFT RIGHT as I command all my sons 'cause I'm grand
(Pull his head, snatch land) See if I slide through the sand
Snakin those who choose to fake moves on Zoo, ya get bruised
(Bring ya crew) Opposin the chosen son of God, you get scarred hard

Now, to all my brothers we be rhymin like this
Yeah I can handle, but they can't kill it mill or dismantle it
And we can leave the component alone
Show all my brothers a brother instead of negro
Crackers in the back obscene nahmean?
But I've been knockin em out the box like ????
So on the single we be flowin at the lingo
Comin together, not solo like Mandingo

Somebody stole me, you took me from Kunta to Toby
And mould me, in a way that you freed me but still hold me
What you tryin to pull? Eatin us like cannibals
Whatever happened to that forty acres and that animal
Now you tryin to use integration just to fool us
Like Malcolm said we been hoodwinked and bamboozled
Mama cryin, and I ain't lyin
I'm going to Washington for justice, I'ma get it or die tryin
Don't hesitate, he's at the gate
And that's a million black men in one place to set it straight
So black women applaud the black God
I'm DA Smart with the million man march

[Chorus]",Where Ya At? [Extended Version],1998
Sunz of Man,"Yo you couldn't see my with a telescope 
Words to cancer smoke your antidote 
Give me the remote turn them off 
I'll let my album melt your ass to a ?starts? crusifiction 
Camouflaged for the mission use your third eye 
To see the Israelite detect those who tell lies 
I see you magnified I blend with the sun rise 
Burn your enterprise today husbands and wives 
Become Bonnie and Clyde, carry 4-5's in these last days 
In time, same shit inside or outside 
Tales of the darkside, we still among minds 
Keep the strong in the jail cells, the countdown for hell 
Use the truth or you bail, let my words be the brail 
For the blind who can't see us, like Black Jesus 
Seizers, try to seize us, we spot them like cheaters 
And turn them into believers 
 
Yo, I was born to survive, A soldier and I strive 
With a duty to civilize these 85's 
See man streets is a wiseman, an original black man 
With a plan to run these devil's off my motherfuckin land 
Unless you were close, when I strained the operation 
Yo, check the first to tool, when I guide to guard your nation 
For this military attack, to and L's draw back 
Beretta take the point on the Sunz Of Man war track 
I burn them like trick-alls, while weak brothers went AWOL 
This new born god, and I'ma hold my life so hard 
These fool keep their intentions, I destory your intentions 
For instence, we talkin this shit with no resistance 

[Chorus: x4] 
The gods stay camouflaged 

Yo, remember, I think it was September or November 
A cold winter, I heard you got bagged and murdered 
Informed by my nigga Glock, the observer 
He told me, all about the fucked up 
Remember for a minute, shouldn't understand 
Then again, I understood good 
Shit is rough in the hood 
Before I knew, I was a Sun Of Man 
Kept a gun in hand, stalkin the land 
Back and forth to the island 
If it wasn't for the knowledge it self 
I would of been seen dead 
Ashes in the base sittin on the shelf 
As the years went, became intelligent to the nonsense 
Than instead of livin like a sandwich, I can vanish 

[Chorus: x4]",Can I See You?,1998
Sunz of Man,"Yeah... 
Give it to me now... 
Uhh! Yeah... 
Bring it on..nuh 
(Yeah) Uhh! 
Neh...yuh! 
Give it to me uhh! (Give it to me) 
Make way for the war path 
The psychopath on the astro blast 
Killin' something off I ?breaka had a bat? 
The improbable on ya way down scream ""Geronimo"" 
From Qu'rans it go my mission imposs-eezible 
Leavin' lyrics in tha hospit-able 
?Then it drops 'em? Fuck the bill, tongued, double-edged 
Slice to kill! ? 
Chop they heads, ?we pickin' cases at the Feds? 
On the D/L, what the hell dead ?
Screamin' ""Hell"" with the angel's death still bodies trail 
City wants the killas be killas 
But though, I'm the deaf villain 
Whose contracts I don't fill-a.
Body-bags by the millions 
But that keeps me illin'? 
Plus I need a ? to cap one off 
My killa raises ? before the calm--Deadly 
In arms! Call the Desert Storm and swing a blast of mega-bombs 
Keep 'em ?sane off the champagne an gat-claps? 
Man, that's from breakin' through the fatal camp 
Perimeter, of the angel's death, *nyeh!* 
That's, the way to leave the lyrics in a total wreck 

This is a journey, through the halls of Hell! 
A journey, that'll burn he, and all, who dwell 
The wicked, are afflicted, condemned, and convicted 
Imprisoned, in darkness, where men, are heartless 
Absolving artists, through ya fire and sparklers 
Drag him down, in the tabernacle by his Adam's apple! 
And suddenly, the angels, of death will hang you! 
The power, whippings, by matters, of degrees 
Calcium absorbed, by evil dead babies! 
You get rabies, from the bat bites 
Dirty germs, and scabies, from the rat bites! 
Your skin, decays, as you choke, and gasp 
With the fumes, that consume, the poison of the asp! 
As ya body releases solid liquids and gases 
Thirsty worms suck the fluid--Ya life flashes! 
You lay down in the dust, body bubblin' with hot pus 
He lay naked, and unsacred 
Blasphemed the Sunz of Man but didn't make it, make it 

Started off at Jesus' left 
Nevertheless, death, not restin' in peace, ?sweet leap? 
Express, across my mental, cut the beef, had it, every week 
Potential, every day I release bombs, deep like thunder 
From the bottom, of a well, of an attack of spells since my eyes 
Opened up in Hell, my mind, think faster 
And it passes by, but ?one convinced? 
It makes no sense, cross ya heart, don't hope to die 
You can climb into the sky, life is only ?high nuclei? in ya mind 
Lost senator, it takes one to survive 
There's too many ways different for the world to just stop! 
We lost ya common
The doctor said, ""Forgot 'cha brain was in ya head"" 
So I hell-raised and said to reality, ""Look inside of me"" 
For the battery, the result, is tragedy 
Through the minds, of my enemies, my horror, is ? 
The Devil's lies, are chokin' me 
Hopefully, I'm gettin' to open the minds, that's supposed to be 
Died, ?

As it begins I, to ?, and I recite a homicidal action 
What's happenin' is now 
The future brings the answer 
A crack fiend--the Devil don't want to dance 
So I leveled, God bless me! 'cause I ain't gonna wait for YOU to do it 
Your brain must got a hole the way I just ran through it! 

So as, we travel, through, the mists 
Of the Bible, the renowned, six deadly snakes 
Look, and they perish, right before us 
Bring the wicked before me and slay them before my feet... 

I contain the science, to make an angel bleed through his vision 
More land and places trapped behind the walls of mental prison 
The limitation a nation of my creation 
Mass confusion ?babies rollin' dead in isolation? 
Inhale the pollution, release the chemicals, my psychological 
Analogy, burns, a hole through reality 
Eruptin' mad levels, devils committin' sin 
But who will ? will we face then in the fuckin' end? 

I raise pain, separation to ya whole frame 
My mic is changed, when I rap and make ya ?framed? 
A chief chancellor, when I rap I leave no answers 
I go into the crypts and give a nigga bone cancer 
When I deliver, I give 'em shivers 
You wicked souls, meet your creator, the Darth Vader 
I send that evil ass back to the incubator 
Fuck with me, ya better off eatin' pork on the grounds of Mecca 
The Killah Priest! The lethal rap injecta! 
I'm full of fury, and anger
Which is my slogan, ya pops shoulda BUST you in the Trojan! 
You want to battle? Here's ya teethin' ring, and ya fuckin' rattle 
And ya horsey and ya saddle, and ya fuckin' pacifier 
I'm gonna baptize you, then BLAST ya ass to FIRE! 
You better check my rendezvous, before you have me sittin' on a panel 
On fuckin' Donahue 
I'm fuckin' sick! 
You better check my past life, I'm Killah Priest! 
You better fuckin' ask Christ! 
And when I'm finished, ya ass'll be a Jehovah Witness 
Or Richard Simmons, searchin' for a fuckin' fitness 
I don't give a fuck if you exercise, do you expect to try? 
You be the next, to die! The Killah Priest! 
Hear me testify! 

The testimony, of the five arch angels 
The Sixty-Second Assass, the Holy Psychiatrist 
Hell Razah, Prodigal Sunn, the Killah Priest... 
And so it is written, the four ran to the four corners of the earth 
And the fifth ran into the sun, with a book, that read

I walked away and I lived too cold
I walked away and I lived too cold

This goes out
This what y'all niggaz all been looking for
A little story for all my brothers
You know what I'm saying? Sons of Man return
We gon' walk on by and keep it moving
Just when it got cold
Cold Sons we got jewels, we gon' walk on by and keep it moving
Check it, moving, word up

Aiyyo, my thoughts be colorless
The undercover rich, haters loving it, watch the hell King Tut with it
Queen's, bathtubbing it, my diamond's cutting it
Sharp and on point, fuck the tricks of the government
Money rules the world, watch my people suffering
Cops busting in, handcuffing men 'til they wrist bleed
Some read what they don't need, give to seed
Black, Lebanese, rabbis in green fatigues
Microphone masked emcees, Maccabees
Hard head emcees get told and still they freeze
The truth came in flesh but still you don't believe
The best thing you know is the spots to find weed
Get the knowledge dungarees, we still struggling
Sons of Man, UK keep it bubbling
We come to clubs, like the ones who bring the trouble in
What, he sold his soul, life publishing

Have to walk on by and keep it moving
Have to walk on by and keep it moving
Have to walk on by and keep it moving
Have to walk on by and keep it moving
Have to walk on by and keep it moving
Have to walk on by and keep it moving

I reminisce all my dark days whenever I phase and kept a blaze
Y'all mental slave renegades, wasn't enough to eliminate
In my lifestyle of hard times and good times
Stood mine with the wines, became nice with the mind
Born intelligent, fuck elegant, I represent
For the ladies and gents, delinquents and presents
Everyday hungry, gun play on the sunny
Crews sweeter than honey, stars fuck for all they money
Stupid dummies, fifteen slugs flood the tummy
Thugs rapped like mummies, sipping Remy's
The clip empty, feeling shifty, swifty
Highly intoxicated, simply infatuated
Never thought he could be faded
Up in the hospital, critical, eating pickles
With no teeth, back on the streets he got beef for little Keith and Tariff
A walking death wish, living selfish, I sort of felt this
The fifth of September, he felt helpless and breathless

I walked away and I lived too cold
I walked away and I lived too cold
I walked away and I lived too cold

Today, life, shoot out, a dice game, bank loot out
Jewels out, laying on three hundred dollar sweaters
Tools out, last day schools out, nine birettas and better
Carry the eighth or red leather, timberland weather gear
Hands in the air, this is a stick up, don't play for hiccups
You won't need a body pick-up, money in the laundry bag
Hungry comrades get they guns from Arabs
With the loot that they had, they rob more victims on the av.
Today cash, examples of the program
Lord Sun of Man, stop killing your own relatives
Unknown start giving the liquid to the dry bones, 
We all came from the same throne
Raise the dead with the brain poem, one is aimed home

Have to walk on by and keep it moving
Have to walk on by and keep it moving

Fuck the world  word up 
Sunz of Man  Method Man  True Mast'  collabora tion 

[Chorus] 
Can't you see my love even though we be with thugs 
Brothers want grub gotta take it in blood 
Because is you down or are you down just because 
Can't you see my love even though we be with thugs 

Yo, when you least expect is when we attack, in fact 
Your format, is not yet suitable for combat 
Still dissident factions within the Kingdom 
Campaign desperate attempts to take your freedoms 
Emphatically, wack strategy, don't impress me 
Impulsiveness'll only bring you tragedy, test me 
Descent to the essence quickly, niggaz strictly flip 
Fuckin with this royal assembly, the Sunz of Man 
Summon me, Chief Administrator of the Law 
True Master in this hardcore Art of War 
I explore the depths on conflict and with no pretense 
Found the best strategy the most impressive defense 
So when you rush to attack, it be I to crush your force 
And exhaust your whole supply 
Don't send for reinforcements, give orders for men to maintain 
They respective borders, or it's a God damn slaughter 

Shots in the park, it be on after dark 
Hungry like the Wolf when the beef starts to cook 
When push come to shove, we push through the club 
Pocket full of bud, baby armed with the snub 
Nosed I suppose, you get body-snatched when you doze 
Recognize your friends from your foes 
Or here lie, another one victimized 
Left for The Fly, now what size is this? 
Nigga your size, and I would be much obliged 
To get a fatter piece of that pie 
Still got my Eyes on the Prize, and like Gloria 
I will survive, at war with the warrior 
Hot with the rhyme.. pennies 
Turn the heat up, and bend me 
Prepare for the next milleni' 
I can't sleep, I'm in the shit knee deep 
In a race against time, beat your motherfuckin beat 
Hold your satellite Son, I'm from where you from 
Same shit different slum, where we about to go 
Ain't no need for the gun, I treat you to a slice 
When we done, and all minds are one, yo 

[Chorus] 

I be the Rabbi watched by snake eyes as the playa hate rise 
New York state side to the West side 
Fuck the best rhyme, best respect mine, from here 
To Palestine watch Sunz of Man climb 
I could tell a fake from a handshake for man's sake to hittin truth 
I translate til the land quake 
I plan my escape on the good fan base 
Strictly satisfaction like the Sunz of Man tape 
No copy or biting off of what your man make 
It's 1998, get your own mindstate 
In 1999 write your own platinum rhymes 
Can you see my love even though we be with thugs? 
Yo, words and keyboards we please the Lord 
Lyrics feed the poor, while the rich receive the sore 
Couldn't stay in one spot too long, split in fours 
Told the truth the four tours brought artists four doors 
I rock the concert til my arm hurt, doin God's work 
While you Star Search, I take your mind to Mars' dirt 
Uhh, what 
I said, can you see my love even though we be with thugs? 

This mathematical rhythmatical mechanism enhances my wisdom 
? of Islam, keeps me calm 
From doing you harm, when I attack, it's Vietnam 
Through CD-ROM, the mega bomb severs the ice in your charm 
Too late for Salaam, slugs rip through your arm 
Double lead arm supreme head some fled from the bloodshed 
Painting many in red, leavin Iranians dead 
? , hangin fast on they deathbed 
Out the window, lyrics flow like hot chemicals 
Burning competitors, from they ears to they asshole 
You want to battle, I separate your Adam's Apple 
Crack your skully with a Snapple bottle, on the Apollo 
Can you read black, ease back, we bleed tracks 
Breeze through facts, contacts smack your wolfpack

Sunz of Man,"Aiyyo this rap game ain't what it seems 
Artists get cream turn fiend 
Selling people a dream 

Aiyyo  you rappers don't amuse me wit your crystals or oozies 
Industry groupies  living after movies 
They scarfaced my race  some support hate 
Lifes a court date  some die to escape so hold your weight 
You niggas brag too much  fuck wit us we bag you up 
And use the same clique that you thought would back you up 
It's nine eight eliminate bait and open gates 
Enough with chains and whips lets make brains eclipse 
We all claim we rich, hold thugs in crypts 
Forgot about the seeds growing up seven to six 
Fuck a Benz wit tints I got the razor prints 
Y'all rappers love idols there it is I'm convinced 
Burn my contract, mental combat 
And stomp your battle rap wit a Vietnam track 
Red and white Sadaam rap sippin Cognac 
I bet you didn't loopb know that the real Jews are black

God or the reverend? 
Your girl or your weapon?

Here in this life 
Big cities a dream on the low is the scheme 
A fiend that clock green without jockin somebodys sting 
About the plot 
You pull the ox who pull the stash outlock 
Yo wuddup I, about ready to pull the rabbit out the top 
Platinum gold oops upside your knot 
Now nigga stop now nigga please 
You ain't really ready to roll them sleeves 
With your three degrees forty below nothin but recipes 
Tight jeans, hype and don't know what nuthin means 
Acting like you Billie Jean selling How to be a Fiend 
When your loves about black marketing a nigga for his cream 
And the big apple it ain't always what it seems 
You might get fooled she's a queen 
From out of town wagging her swing 
All around with she glasses and women asses is what made men jack asses 
Everything including your company jacket 
And niggas asses for your ransom 
And next thing you know they got a nigga dancin 
Chancin him out of his advancements 
And how y'all gonna pay back these back taxes? 
This ain't healthy for your assets 
It's like your face done been bashed in your career ain't happning 
After the monkey wrenches and forks done been stabbed in 

Intruiging to the ear but bitter to the heart 
I begin to take part in The Art of Dart Throwin 
Starring the Wu-Tang swordsmen 
Raindrops fall the block remains hot 
Steam rises from the street which forms the clouds that I move through 
Renew my stainless sword style 
Allah has spoken the golden code of silence has been broken 
Mic terrorist shroom brew wickedness improves 
As I ascend and expand extend I seen men 
Fall from greats trying to trace the origin 
But there is no beginning or end to the lifeline 
Sunz of Man forever shine through the mic line

I say a case of a rap star, permanent scar caught in the rapture 
Of the bar code, he was more sold like Old Gold 
Paraseuco industy whore bitches adore 
Truly yours, feeling me more enemies fall 
I'll and hardcore ready for tour shakin breakin jaws 
Makin new laws open the doors healing my sores 
Blessing the poor, the art of war we less a boar 
Verse one we guard a star and the starting artist 
Another target on your market style is garbage 
You get bombarded whole clique slapped retarded 
Pussy harded mcs bleed slugs to the body 
It's physical domination lyrical laceration brutal termination 
When you fuck wit the federation, collaboratin wit my nation 
Discussing allegations conversating about the downfall of Satan 
Ghetto frustration keeps my head piece achin 
Constant motivation keeps my world in rotation

Cars? Women? Huh livin lovely? Phat houses? 
What you think its about? 
Not gettin paid? Havin fame? Havin everybody lovin you runnin up to you? 
What you think its about?

Givin something for the children to look up to?

Scannin, my understandin, snatchin ? like a cannon

Pick on dead brains like the vulturs be
Build like construction
Bring plans destruction
Malfunction your internet with intelect
These doors in the Sunz of Mansion
You ain't enter yet
Where we trap you
Like Soloman's Temple
Caught you tryin' to steal a jewel
Out my mental
Who sent you
Devils drive your soul like a rental
The hell what we been through
Since we start speakin' Hebrew
We got robbed stuck up with needles
Be careful they need you
They plan to delete you
????? on to lead you
It's good verses evil

Chorus

60 Second Assassin:
A dollar
Black power
To destroy
The real mccoy
We off the roof
Oh yeah
One hundred proof
My plans
Sunz got it locked up
Oh yeah
Chase it down with Vodka
Oh yeah
Sunz of Man
Could stop us 
What's the plan
Setup perfect why flop us
My man
It be me and you
Oh yeah 
Down by the river
Oh yeah 
Without guns and triggers
Wu man
Sunz plan is perfect from there
Think what I know when the nine ran
To the eight to the nine to the two g's
Never plan to fail 
Never fail to plan

Prodigal Sunn:
Sleepin' on persians
We used to wear turbins
Daughters the virgins gold slippers
Now they gon be strippers
Can't hold they liquor
They fight and bicker
God sent blew out the projects
No life left jobless
Diggin' out garbage
No welfare with no healthcare
The pain is felt here
They decieving with TV's
Turned her into a species
Won't feed the seed
The government raise the rent 
Birth control pills
We owe mills
Black man and the black woman can't get along
Because Rikki Lake is on
With two horns
Let's take it back to the applejacks hat
Before they shackled blacks
We was above things
Now we drug fiends
Shootin' dope in our bloodstreams
We love cream
We love dreams
When our feet are soft
Comin' up to me with three fourths
Tryin to get the freak off
But you know Priest thoughts
If knowledge is a freecourse
Keep your knees crossed
I can see forked tongue
Taught when I was young
By the older
Brush it off our shoulders

Chorus

60 Second Assassin:
This plan ain't written we be livin' it
Wisdom flow ocean leak 
To deep to swim in it
Women, Lil' Kim and them
Instead of bein' militant but feminent
You guilty or innocent
Rap black internationalist
Niggaz kill me with that old fashion shhhh
Claimin' buy this
They ain't real with they topics
Claimin' worldly knowledge
You get tossed like the Thomasses
It is a promise, kid
Your English will get buffed and
Based on David you roughin
Your whole majors is frontin'
Triple in your front, blue
So why ya'll still theivin from the Sunz of Man
Independent group
Information must be leakin out my faucet
True
Aqua blue and still ain't nothin' new
In the Sunz whippin'
Even as it was written
As it was written

You think you got it all setup

Prodigal Sunn:
Interception of your production
Self-destruction of the son of man
Never thought the alien
Would eventually make grandz
Hand in hand
Peace to black man, woman, and child
Juveniles ????????????????????
Young and liberated
Some deceased and separated
Non-educated rated out-dated they never made it
Swift wisdom precision
Islam my definition
They call us make sonic brawlic wise decision
Snakes missin' the fiction
Out of jurisdiction
To late to listen
About you bombin' competition

Chorus

I'm your father 
I'm your daddy
I'm your brother
Asiatic
I'm your doctor 
When you bleed
From that wrong
Teach your seeds
What they need
Is true knowledge 
From the tree
To be free

No matter who you are
Shining bright to see
What you could truly be

Shining star come in to view
Shine its watchful light on you
Give you strength to carry on
Make your body big and strong
Born a man child of the sun
Saw your work had just begun

Found I had to stand alone
Bless it now I've got my own

I ain't want nothing known but a bank roll.
On the other side of 123rd St., bro'.
Nothing known but a bank roll.
On the other side of 123rd St., bro'.
Bringing it straight off the currency.
Now this shit is tough.
I got this shit magic from here to Texas trap.
With the god's jewels stash.
I ain't want nothing known but a bank roll.
On the other side of 123rd, bro'.
Yo, that's that.
I ain't want nothing known but a bank roll.

Break bread, eliminate feds and dead heads
I seen the bloodshed, devils decay, torture, enslave
>From Red Hook to Compton, Fort Green to Albany
Galleries of artillery, a symphony, military
Some adversaries and fairies caught the bad decision
Physical collision, we leave 'em deaf and holy like some christians
(A new incorporation, your rap exoriantation
Not a reorientation, or interntation
More and more foes is what I'm chasing
Low down international business, players exchanging
Your ears pound, throw down erasing)
Maneuvering, moving like slugs from a silencer
My fleet of seven on your calendar, fuck an amateur
(Game premeditated, crime related, rhyme intensive
Chess, some hardest gamers, the world black as entertainment)
Your time is short, change your thought, rearrange your sports
Before being pork on a fork, I get scorched by the torch
In this Sunz of Man federation, pure meditation
Righteous advigation, teaching for the blind in my nation
(Still remaining through all the shot reigning
Hit grim, stitchy grain, playing half, broke that untouchable
Still tapping plants, by the forced in, rap street, yo extortion)

Chorus: Prodigal Sunn

[Killah Priest (Hell Razah)]
In the beast like orcra, swim across the border
Walk upon the water, holding the minora
Reaching for the tora, face full of torture
One deeper than my ora, I stalk ya with the offer
Law and order, cut your day shorter
Slaughter everybody in the party
(Check the godly, from the cradle to the graves
We hell raise you, break your bread at the table
With my real Kane and Ables it gets fable
We build stables, we drop jewels that enslave you)
Wear the wooden bander, seven shield commander
Wave the golden banner, swinging down the hammer
In the house of David, we gold, true laces
Diamond braclets, niggaz on that snake ship
(There ain't no love without the hatred
The cure for the snakes in the snakepits
Created and those that's belated
It's too much, you fear, must prepare scuba-gear
Got a ocean of the dry potion, we mind smoking
We blind for the thugs and drug dealers
Who used to be pyramid builders, ancient healers
Stand for mirrors, all they see is cap pealers and reflection
Moon do me right, give me night life, let me run in all directions)
Worldly impressions, natural infections, massive depression
Dealing with reality, fantasies is nothing but a fantasy
I see it's all vanity, humanities, who volcanically
Satanically, on the edge of my sanity, can't we be all family

Rock away, so the mega trades, diggin', pockin' days
Yo, the aids wasn't in, calm braids all trimmed

When I element the foul, prowl, upon the weekend of sweet
I gotta eat, generate with the heat, demolish beats

Livin the mass hysteria, the bomb shell of America

Realistic predator, the rhyme writer, climb heights
Rhymes ignite, MC's reputation, blown out of sight

Gather millions, acapella in the streets, today crack
Fuck opinions, I'm hittin to the nights endin
A new beginin, takin over men and women
Thoughts used for sinnin, neighborhood no grinin
Thug religions, expeditions, startin for a mil
Stick the student for his intuition
Beyond college, street knowledge, got to eat knowledge
Off the tree of life, while seek wallets
Credit cards, some trust for their gods
In the Wizard of Oz, you get it all to get robbed
Price is on the food and the Earth's precious jewels
Ain't the golden rules from the golden black jewels
Steppin' out the furnace, only run with fast learners
Burn cash and we stash burners
We be the underground childs, mainstream now
Sort of like Apocalypse, bloaw, blaow
Take what you own, must return to your home
Claim back your throne, we're on a higher zone
Black Lazurus, plus we're not havin' it
Pass the diamonds on the wrist, we're on some take the earth shit
Demolish every tool, that y'all niggas work with
The barcode, bio chips be short circuited

Here in this jungle, jungle, jungle ?
I'm livin' through, your crew on the subject
The loot, I'm new improved
Plus my time piece is bullet proof
I need a bulldozer or crane, that stains like in vain
You be the blood and I be the drainin' on
Forgot to burn your proper on, with the tool stone
Written, founded dead on this spot
You emergin', believe I'm the surgeon
Rhymes leave your brain on all right, double scenes
Back hand, slap you, clap thoughts, like evil raps
Play that, what it slap right back
You was seen, soak the zeen
Self esteem, so common, even suckers die
Major League, total assassinator, rhyme complicator
The devil and the sword bring death, feed Jamaica
Rain or hurricane, step on my house
Into the house on severe pain, strong like a pyramid
Nothin' but various parts of the house that Jack built
The little house on the praire, I huff and I puff
And I blow your brain to a seisure
Before you step to me, you should of called off
Ceaser's father, mercy words, I'm no joke
I cancer smoke, I reply, ""your brain and told""
I live for my tech 9, uzi, grenade, all cause of one rhyme

The wisdom we apply Son soak this shit up 
If it was sess Son niggaz would smoke this shit up 
So wake the fuck up or get broke the fuck up 

Yo yo yo we are street soldiers of the dark side of the planet 
I kill killing orders like a lieutenant 
Hit the planet Earth then explode like a human cannon 
The universal author, born to kill saga 
Givin' niggaz head trauma 
Bulletproof shield is made of gold armor 
Brain surgeon is aversions my purgin' mind urban 
Scientists found killed and wrapped up in curtains 
Casualties, flashbacks, now simply that 
I attack like a rat, serious as a heart attack 
Professional assassinator professor 
Assassinate your mind state and broke the metal plate 
Lyrical Nostradamus, psychotic mind of Sadaam 
Ex-con, attack the Pentagon 
with unorthodox firearm from Vietnam 
I crucify 'em, like Muslims murdering Jews from Jerusalem 
Now who's the supreme lyricist? You can't seize this 
When I die, my name'll be worshipped like Jesus 
War visual individual incriminate the criminal 
My culture nickel put holes in your face like dimples

Brains get unfrozen when they oppose, as we unfold 
Futuristic scrolls that was prophesied scriptures 
Fitting an untold, I roll with my skull and bones 
Made of solid gold, skin is closing up 
Approach your home, with a war, Armageddon in my home 
Wisdom mind ruler mental intruder 
From the tribe of Judah 
Devils disappear like they went through the 
Bermuda, triangle, erupting on Ryzarector tracks 
like volcanoes, so God swear to me 
I appear two years sample revolution in the burning cup 
Constitution, learned too much, came off must return 
Observe the facts, delivered by, blacks 
Soon as we unite the sky cracked 
A group of UFO's formed a seven in the heavens 
God celebrate devils death day signal 
Jail let loose the criminals, bystanders died 
Waiting for miracles we giving you

Yo, I make your heart thump like tree stumps 
Be crackin' concrete chumps released once 
The Earth shifts, vocal points clips he wrote and missed 
Killer vocalist, load his fist blessed with loaded gifts 
Golden clips, shotty slipped like psychotic hits 
In soldier flicks, who wrote the shit superior 
Mines combine the modus click 
Enterprise like German spies, keep my eyes on Soviets 
Stay Russian my direction I'm wettin' like a leaf bone 
Freak poems, seek thrones, to call home where freaks bone 
To each his own, chrome zones, be cloned like chromosomes 
So the chrome, the golden toned champ whip rollin' bones 
Fire's on, blazin' hot trails at night, barren ville 
Shotty still collaborating on tracks with Bobby Steels 
Generate a mil, Killa Bee law, kill or be killed 
Know the ledge, finally, our justice has revealed 

[Chorus]

The forty third conviction, incarcerated in hell for eternity 
But my mentality and chemistry made me celestial through the galaxy 
Sparks friction, generating through evaporation 
Slay through meditation, your body is now liquidation 
Even your hemoglobin is swollen with corrosion 
Amputated and rated physical zone disintegrated 
That's what niggaz face when fuckin' with the Sunz of Man 
Go to the dungeon I could lead a hundred men, with a golden pen 
Forced to intercept with the click from Shaolin 
Killin' devils, scatter they ashes over the sea of Mediterranean 
That's my trademark, PS burned in my victims heart 
I be the Star from afar illuminating through the dark 
Another burning face of death 
The initiation of the Mason, 186 my name's left in the Book of Revelation 
Reminiscing about the days, raising hell 
Representative of a mind, able to lead a city what technicality of mankind 
Mistake trying to keep me behind the closed doors of reality 
All three eyes to the revolution can now escape the blind state of confusion 
Trials and tribulations of the original nation 
Leaves a headache, the only chance of elevation 
Unite with the black coalition 
Sunz of Man, population click, Wu-Tang Clan 
First the Killarmy, eat your skeletons, buried in the Promised Land 

You better wake the fuck up! 
That's word life! 
Don't sleep! 
We don't be having that shit no more! 
Word is bond this is as real as it's going to get

Hey you, what you want to do
Everybody get down to the 60 sound
This one's for everybody here, for you to see
War, stagnation, headin' for our nation
Lets bring our thoughts to unity

Everybody uptight tryna get their head right

Camouflaged through the City Lights, I paint pictures
Faint the scripture fascinated with crime, of brutally the liquor
Searchin' for the answers, Arthur feet down died of cancer
The fall and rise of black people, God is your only answer
A little laughter for the good times and bad times
A day of sunshine, purity and deeper of designs
Steeper of minds, keeper of rhymes, my soul reclines

We get around like Sel Antanas
Got rich niggas can't stand us, payin' the banners
And black ballers, we set up tracks with a chorus
Get clapped by my rap supporters, catch you borders
Sleep walkers, get advanced to street orders
Hell comin', drop the dice, no runnin'

What's goin on? What's goin on?
Ugh! What's goin on? What's goin on?
Yo, yo

Deep in the Water of life, I would fight
Wearing turbens, purified up in the virgin
Emerging the blood, would flood up the wombs
The eggs hatch, and let loose, a fume
Prophecized just like Jesus, writing Hebrew
On the wall's of my mother's fetus
Then I was swimming in the afterbirth
Each chapter, each verse, got deeper, got worse
The keeper, of laws, my brain, what saw
The seeker, of tablets, preachers, would ban it
The force, brought forth, the holiest, controlliest
Slowly, takin me, into, the mental, orgasm
Was 'jaculating, stimulating, relating to life
Incubating, rotating around light beams
Like creams, I was formed in the white dream
Redeemed, like powder, outta, my maker
Enter, nature, returned, the vapor
Killah Priest, born in the pillar of yeast
Lost in the miscarriage, the automatic of marriage
Pow! Once ya live, ya die
Ohh.. what is it? Is it a mystery?
Did they mention me in history?

I was born alone, begun from blood, skin and bones
To the mind, body, soul hunter, creating poems
For immature brain cells, trapped in confusion, I ruin your mental
I sent that ass to Hell and tell the devil that I sent you
I react like a reflex, protected by God
Bringin life to the brain-dead, diggin deeper than the graveyard
The stick that you walk with, I broke a long time ago
There's nowhere to hide when I stalk like a shadow
Everyday somebody dies, somebody else is born
A chain reaction, life's a cycle like plastic
I practice, ghetto bastards I'm givin caskets
Innocent, murderous is what you don't expect
While secret Satan agents be livin off your death
I'm already a waitin victim to an unknown death trap
Hell is gettin hot, is it too late for me to sweat that?
The killah team, guillotine get chopped where your heads at
In order to get revenge ya got to pass my dead end
I use your best friend to set ya up for me to win
To put the blood inside my pen to write my next sin
Then again, the beast from within, it just possessed
It leads me to kill, then I'm left with your bloody mess
I seem insane, since semen my brain been gained
Like Monopoly, but there's no way of stoppin me

I die slow, struggled in the wounds of evil
My technicality wins a race based on reality
Everyday is still a revolutionary thrill
The war's in the streets, bodies floatin down the bloody river
Terror, livin in this present day and era
Caged in the belly of the beast, thoughts of a killah
The duty of a wise man, prophecized, civilize the savage
Yeast, I generate heat from the East
Repells revelation, livin in revelation
The Sunz of Jacob shall fill the power of the nation
Created, situated, on physical plains, originated
From drops of sperm, the black germ
I come with the scientifical techniques and masses
The methods of madness, psycho wrath of gases
Burnin through flesh, deteariatin brain cells
Waves radiate as I escape the channel of Hell
The arsenal, one Prodigal, Sun of Man
Stalks the fuckin land with evil, various plots and plans
The wicked lashes shall buries us inside time and matter
I write chapters through the raptures of disaster

Trapped in a long dark tube, fightin for exsistence
Absorbin stressful germs as I travel the distance
Eternally locked in a cell in the form of sperm
Doing life, mental strife, evil semenal germ
Swimmin through revengeful cycles, accumlatin arches
Killin of the sperm cells, illuminatin darkness
Stranglin 'em with my tail, absorbin life from semen
When I was born I came out screamin and blasphemin 
Cryin in blood, spittin at the figure of Christ on the holy ?
See, since the sonogram I was diagnosed to be cursed
Doctors administered stress, I'd be born in the church
But they sold the womb closed of unholy bitches
A burst up, reversed and blast through the stitches
Ahh! Hell at last, my first breath that I cursed
They performed the ritual, took me home in a hurse
But in the womb I metamorphesized, my birth and death was already prophecized
Instead of a crib I slept in a casket
Sacrificed the first born but Christ denied this evil bastard
For all of those who don't understand what I'm talkin about
You're trapped in my helium of evil thought, figure your way out
Or be comdemned to eternal livin death",Deep in the Water,2004
Sunz of Man,"Yeah, yeah, Sunz of Man, Disciples
Got the four Elements
About to take you through the four stages of nature
The combinations of danger
It's like that
Killah Priest

I'm deep into the page
Each stage is like a maze, it's like sperm reachin the egg
I focus on the brain cause it be the enterprise
It's like life within the center of the eyes
Descend off the soundwaves, that are bound for days
The atom is surrounded with rays
My frame be the mercury, it circles degrees
Developed the strength in Hercules
Wisdom changes my continent
When I quiz them I build up the confidence
You burnin me is like tryin to culture a pig
I teach knowledge and culture the kids
I inject the rhyme into the depths of the mind
The proper insight gives effects on the blind
See I don't entertain, I enter the brain
The Killah Priest always come and represent the name
A daily study stimulates the thought
Correct diet, I meditate with less talk
Makes me deep as the ocean floor
The ink soaks in and I'm prepared to explore
MC's fall like the city of Rome
I'm inspiring like Solomon and witty in the dome

Yeah, writing rhymes with a liquid pen
Next to appear, be the holy wizard

Knowledge I obtain is mystic, realistic
There's hittin gems in sins if you missed in
Thou have to contain the power to unravel
It's like walkin a-stray on the edge of the earth without a map to travel
Once false step, you enter the depths of darkness
the triple stains that engraved to the conscious
As I drag your mind off the edge of sanity
I leave you floatin, you have to figure your way back to gravity
Taken beyond the orbits of NASA, at rates much faster
Your chest tightens up like asthma
And you be gaspin for oxygen
Inhalin fatal gas, light-headed from the hydrogen
Driftin in the wind like a cloud that can't rain
You lack the element so it's relevant to strain
Your brain lacks water like the moon
Dependin on the earth since you first left the womb
Words engraved to paralyze you in the mental
Too much weight to analyse the potential
Amounts of pressure that'll tilt your scale
And as for 85's I describe it in braille
The blind language, the deaf and dumb I use sign language
Cause I was blessed to exorcise stress and anguish
Niggas be strainin with they sick sound-es
I'm splitin atoms and spillin holy water on their conscious
Travellin 186,000 miles per second
Then shine forth as far thoughts if you can catch em

Life is hell, hell tells lies in your face
Every other day we're killin off our own race
When you trapped inside hate
It's hard to escape inside a slave mindstate
Cause you go out like a blind date
Surrounded by danger when you're livin in the world full of anger
The pain I drop just to get you got is a brain strainer
Deadly talk, silent thoughts
I can't overstand when the man want to live long
And you think too short and distorted
Payin for your religion when you really can't afford it
I'd rather live like the god then instead of dyin for a devil
You couldn't climb this level with a ladder made of knowledge
I demolish, abolish, so don't try to follow
I look into your body in the dark and I could tell you that you're hollow
You're sleepwalkin, blind ass zombie
I hell raze from the grave of ignorance (yo)
Just to finish men lookin guilty of sin

Cryin' deep within the mental, my soul is intoxicated
Opressed with stress, aggrevation, pain and frustration
I can't take it no more as I journey through the halls of hell
Justice prevail, unrighteous will surely fail
Now may my enemies be defeated in the Chamber
of danger facin life full of strife, filled with anger
Forced to enter as an avenger of sin
I roar like the mighty lion as I contrive of Benjamin

Yo what I'm about to do
Is explain how the elements came together
Formed the Disciples and the Sunz of Man

I was chained, and thrown in the tombs
With 85 people in a long dark room
Christ appeared with a robe and a beard
We had a deep conversation, and then he disappeared

I must find a certain man to complete the cycle

The tree of life. The tree of good and evil.

My mind sometimes be haunted by my memories
Visions in my head have shown me digging up my enemies
I hate to go to sleep because of the dread that's in my head
At times I find myself running from shadows of the dead
They're trying to pull me under and bury me alive
I wake up thinking it's over and thinking I've survived
They've pulled me back to sleep and separated my soul
from my body and put my bloody flesh in a hole
Ah, shit gets worse, now the curse caves my faith in
I rose from beneath the surface of Earth as Satan
Inflicting people with war, drugs, diseases
Jumped up, fell back to sleep, ressurected, ah Jesus
Healing the same mother fuckers I've just inflicted
Spreading righteousness through word of god, my mind is twisted
A holy war in the mental, I'm sort of brain dead
Spirits have got me under pressure and they're fucking up my head

As I die slowly, I could feel my soul leave
My heart pumps part to my lungs, so I could breathe
I take my last breath, I gasp cuz I'm ?peth?
I felt the needle which held the ?neeval?
From another dimension, they had me flinching, with no attention
Was paid by nurses, what's worse is
I felt the stiches as the door locks
Retreated for witches and warlocks
and devils and demons, with shovels they was scheming
I woke up when I was taken up by this dream and
Then I was brough to the courts of another world
Damn, my beloved Sheryl, couldn't put shit and uncover the pearls
Instead of a jewel, I've discovered a germ

That burned and turned my sperm into worms
Ah, filthy-ass maggots, with matches
Oh, my God, I was thanking God it was the savage
Yeah, that day I saw Nat Turner
and I saw Christ, he was stalking around with a black burner

Another time my mind dwelled on the spell
I heard cries from the dead souls burning in hell
Visions of their flesh drowning in the flood
While under hallucinations, I've seen heads soaked in blood
I snapped back to reality and dashed for my bible
Opened it up in hurried confusion, reaching for survival
But all of a sudden, I'm overpowered by that curse
The songs that I've read have made my visions worse
Seen a therapist, told him spirits tried to bury me
Spilt what's on my mind, When I was done, he needed therapy
He recommended a baptistism, a sacrifice
My soul rose to heaven, but was cast back down by Christ
In forms of thunder, rain and heavy winds
Not even the blood of Christ could cleanse the sins of men

Huh, yeah, huh, oh

That was a state of confusion that we lived in
I converted to over a thousand religions
A permanent member to 6 million churches
I'm still trying to repent from these curses
Me and the Holy Wizard, we went and slept in the graveyard
Remember that? We stayed up all night and played cards
Now, I sit in the pit of cobras
I'm writing rhymes in the stance of yoga
Oh, my God, I played drums with the bones of Mohammad
In three years, I grew a beard and roamed with a garment

Sunz of Man,"Yeah, Scientific Shabazz, the Holy Psychiatrist
Coming down with that spiritual rain
Six thousand years of darkness
Four hundred years of pain

Death shall be his penalty

As I embellish, mentally I nourish
Resuscitate a mindstate that has perished, you shall inherit
his blood I require back, to Earth
we rise out of spiritual darkness, six thousand year curse

Condemning those, who sacrificin, babies on the altar
I hear the cries of innocent black babies who are aborted
and unmercifully slaughtered

turning over in their graves

To the soldier, of the Lord, the warrior King David

Pick up your righteous load, and yo then carry it
To a new home, and i-dentity

Keep your eyes on the prize and you'll rise above

Swing it low sweet chariot, get on down

The grafted image, of worshipping Ceasear

in a noose, hangin from a fuckin tree whipped-in mentally
abused, visions of great great cousins
Runnin across the field, unarmed

4th Disciple, and we got the rifle

I pull in wolves like Adolf Hitler, for my two brothers
And two sisters, I tattoo scriptures
Love my seed, like I love the Lord
I was thirteen, when I first record, now I'm back with a heavier sword
It's either rap, crack, or basketball
Young kings want to gun sling, and snatch earrings
Eighty seven, it was microphone fiend, and crack king
We used to battle on the lunch room table, before labels
Now they pay us, so the radio play you
You'se a lame nigga, and you know, we know the truth
And we back, and we back in the booth, first recoup
Then recruit, now salute, we on the loose, ain't ready to shoot

Tell your A&R we burnin' his coupes

Touch my throat, and I cut off ten fingers

Smokers and heavy drinkers, slingers and chain swingers

Whoever rollin' with me in here, throw your singles up
It's loyalty over money, bitches, and keys
Backstab me, snatch his arms out the both of his sleeves
Chain and command, explained from a brain of a man
We go to war, like the Arabs'll do, from Pakistan
Matter fact, like the Sun of Man would, from Bethlehem
Drop a jewel that the children out in school, can understand

And all my ladies on the left hand side, that got a drop and
Hold it down, cause we don't got nine lives

And if not, then keep moving

Rebel Music free the pain inside, until this day in my ghetto
I hear echoes, where anger cry, feel me?
I bring tears to the angel eye, and paint pictures
With a pen, for the saints that die
Why you happy go lucky, off of record label lies
I make, rebel music, verse the devil's illusion
This time, they can't pacify the revolution
Even if they plan to pay us back, retrobution
I revoke to be part of their couch, 'cause we don't own
Enough boats, to be shipping in no bundles of coke
I can't advertise, on killin' my folks, who dead broke
While I'm thinkin' of my ancestors, hung on ropes
Black queens havin' seeds while she's strung on dope
I resurrected Nat Turner with this song that I wrote wrote

Rebel Music on my side always, I rebel against the true system
A young man givin' old wisdom, over soul witness

I try to stay out of drama, give my life to the heavenly father
'92 had a fetish for them heavy revolvers
We die as martyrs, underground, call me Osama
Plant seeds like a farmer, off of positive karma
Spiritual armor, bring me more medals of honor
I'm not your average M.C., son, my level is sharper
The ghetto is smarter, children of them biblical authors
Abraham, lost sheep, must continue the saga
Revelations, 2 and 9 prove that Christ was darker
Than the paintings on your walls, and your living room halls
Tatooed on your arms, and you chains and charms
Tell moms that I love her, God, for singing me songs

""I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride""

Live in the ghetto, and I die in the ghetto, ghetto
""I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride"" 
My mind be crumb, the revolutionary seven needs
They raised up in the eighties, with these crack babies

Rest in peace on my project walls, a young drug lord
It's either rap now, or basketball
Everybody gotta jersey on, thinkin' they be murdering songs
Same hoes that put burberry on
You only learn when your hustle is wrong, you stepped your game
Shooters miss, when they aim up, Bush applied and they blamed us
Do a coke bust, hit the crib, say Bin Laden blew it up
Locked up, half of my raise, until we wise up
Rise up, and master our faith, word up, son
I'm a true black brother, ask Angie Stone
Papa was a rolling stone, Razah be the heir to the throne
Now I got check writers, ears to the phone
Meetings with big businessmen in other timezones
Chrome registered guns, two educated sons
Goons ready to ill when the revolution comes

""I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride""

With a calico, trenchcoats and godfather hats

Sunz Of Men,"And that's my word... that's my word 

[Chorus]
If you're blind to the wicked ways 
The devil plays mad tricks on your mind (check it out) 
If you're blind of the wicked ways (yeah check it out) 
The devil plays mad tricks on your mind (yo) 

The President just ordered the Navy to hit the borders of Haiti 
Slaughter babies from the waters of Euphrates 
Maybe they sent germ that's polluted our sperm 
And made us live uncircumcised in the serpent eyes 

And told us certain lies, and each day a servant dies 
But in the halls of Pharaoh the walls are narrow 
And religion is like a prison for the seekers of wisdom 
This be the dance of the graveyard 

So do the spank with the dead zombie 
Here comes the tanks of a Red Army 
The real Jew is you, Jeremiah fourteen and two 
Enforced by the Hebrew 

Ya hovered by the eagle, America is evil 
Let no man deceive you, beat you, or mistreat you 
The tribe of Edem, stole your freedom 
And Edem means redneck 

I'm throwin bullets in my Tec 
Nah, I'm goin out like Joshua 
With a pen, an army, and an apocalypse 

[Chorus]

I remember 
The six doctors, that wanted to take my brain into a laboratory 
Destroy me, since birth 
My baby talk was psychic thoughts 

Flashbacks, all the past blacks trapped in the present 
Killin for dead presidents, where every ghetto residence 
is evidence, and the future, there will never be none 
If we don't be-come, unity 

Or get them devil made guns, and leave them demons bleedings 
Give em BACK with tons of speeding bullets 
Fuck your tech-nology, it's trick-knowledgy 
Tellin lies to my vision, I was given, enough time 
To master, the criminology 
And Mr. Pastor, teachin demonology 
Words of dope knowledge, I demolish 
Evil men, with an easy win 
When my thoughts are spaced out, come down to EARTH 
The devil crawls, 'cause he's only, jealous 
And a victim of the unholy ghost 

Chorus: 
If you're blind to the wicked ways 
The devil plays mad tricks on your mind (mind) 
If you're blind to the wicked ways 
The devil plays mad tricks on your mind 

Verse Three: 7th Ambassador 
He listens to the cries in the distance 
of the next victim, wishin, that he had some assistance 
And right before his eyes it appeared 
Beware when the shadow caster, demon master's in the near 
He blocked the true light from your sight 
And transformed your brightest days, into your darkest nights 
I had your blind man praisin the grave 
Cause he feel the cross, that lays in the dirt 
And think he's in the church, not even aware 
That death is near, and he's one step from his grave 
A naive mental slave if he had, his third eye sparked 
He mighta been scopin 
Them demons that be lurkin in the dark 
Always keep your glowin eye open 
By knowin who your enemies be 
I can see you but you can't see me 
Escape from your chains like, Great Houdini 
And disappear, like a majestic genie, in midair 
Vanish, that's my advantage 
And then I transform to a hurricane storm 
And rain holy water, for seven days 
And seven nights, the chosen ones spark the light 
Of the Sun, that's killin off villains by the ton 
Sealin all the doors to the Hells, correct spells 
That were cast on my peeps that were weak 
Made to keep, my peeps in a deep sleep 

Verse Four: 60 Sec. Assassin 
Behold! The angels out the heaven 
Who professes a whole new rap, session reposessin the gossip 
back so black, better hand over your act, or trapped, to 
Seven fifty three, who have received the law 
By the dispositions of angels, and have not, kept it 
Transgressed it, better burn your testaments 
Ain't nothing changed niggaz is gettin arrested 
Beat down like wrestling 
On the count, of false impression, indiscretion 
Advise em all with the glimpse, of a third eye 
The silent sleep, and wicked 
I work you niggaz out like physics, I blast out from the heart 
of Brooklyn, like an arrow, just stick to my point 
It's narrow, I shoot niggaz back, into the time 
like Pharaoh, I smoke up on your brain, leave it 
burnt as Sahara, that leaves desert, with a rock storm 
Leavin niggaz buried and puttin them at Lou's lawn 
Headquarters, of the Zoo, what part, wasn't reviewed 
Or didn't you understand 
I'm drillin niggaz back under the surface of the land 

Outro: Killah Priest 
Show the righteous man, stand in great lonliness 
Before the face, of such that have afflicted him 
And may no account of his labels 
For they see it, they shall be troubled with terrible fear 
And shall, be amazed at the strangeness of his salvation 
So far beyond all they were lookin for",Wicked Ways,2001

I was wrong as fools can be
I survived misery
I don't understand
The way...the way I'm feeling
Torn and tired at best
But I'm still breathing...
Taught to bottle feelings in
I remember what I did
I'm embarrassed of the past
I created
Open wide, let me in
I'll confess my every sin
I was wrong as fools can be
I survived misery
Then you slammed into me
And I felt for the first time in my life
You don't remember 'cause you were young and I was so in love with you...

Open wide, let me in
I'll confess my every sin
I was wrong as fools can be
I survived misery",Confession,2000

Come here for a second 
I want to holla at ya 
What's up 
Yo, you know that girl?
You was with the other day 
Yea, she got a man? 
Maybe, why? 
I'm trying to get her to holla 
Put me down 

Yesterday, I was playing ball 
Around my way 
When I saw you with a girl, 
That I never seen before 
And girl, I gotta holla 
Oh, tell her I said what's up 
Oh, I want to know what's up 
Oh, tell her I'm the, 
I'm the fliest and I'm h-o-t 
Oh, tell her I'm Mario, 
Oh, that I'm a Romeo 
So, why don't you let her know?
Can you hook it up for me?

[Chorus]
I'm feeling your girlfriend 
Can you put me on? 
She needs a boyfriend 
Who can put it on 
It ain't gotta be serious 
We can just chill and have fun 
Girl, you've got to put me on 

I can't wait 
Can you call her up 
Or find some way 
For us to meet and talk 
Hit the movies 
Or let's take a long walk 

Oh, tell her I said what's up 
Oh, I want to know what's up 
Oh, tell her I'm the, 
I'm the fliest and I'm h-o-t 
Oh, tell her I'm Mario, 
Oh, that I'm a Romeo 
So, why don't you let her know? 
Can you hook it up for me? 

[Chorus]

I'm curious, I gotta know just how she feels 
I'm serious, so baby tell me what's the deal 
I know that she's the one 
Don't make me wait to long

But I was nearly crazy
And I was clearly crazy

[Deacon the Villain]
On I-85 North, going nowhere
Would hit the 400, but I ain't got money for the toll there
Traffic backed up ahead of me, I see the road flares
School bus on my right, kids laughin' with brown and gold hair
Replaying conversations in my head by my ex-wife
From the house work that I did, to the kids, even our sex life
She said I was crazy so I threatened to prove her dead-right
So she got court orders, restraining me, put on the red lights
Frustrated, thinking how the fuck could I clean it up
Traffic stopped, about 1000 degrees in my truck
Loosened my tie, wiped the sweat out of my eyes, mixed with tears
Mind thick with fears, I've lost everything that I done built for years
Bright yellow school bus fucking up my limbo
Kids bitchin', cussin', flickin' boogers upon my window
Start rolling it down for some air and the handle breaks
Kick my door open, dive out, feeling some escape

""We said vows and shit, that shits' for life right?!
Yeah, that shit's until death, death...
That shit can be mended
But that bitch don't be listening to me!
She'll prolly throw a fucking fit and shit!
I'ma go there that bitch is gonna listen to me
She'll see I'ma fix this shit, FUCK THAT!""

[White man in the background]: ""Move your fucking car, maaaaan!!""

Motherfucker is my own car really haulting movement
I got some powerful shit in my trunk want me to use it?
I grabbed that shit, cocked it now talk like you're silly!
If you needed some release would I fuck with you, Billy?
""Look away lady, before I swiss cheese your Mazda""
Am I crazy for wanting my babies to have a father!
Gonna show my bitch of a wife she better work a little harder
Stop them kids from screaming, it's pushing me even farther!
It's my daughter's birthday, Billy, you like this gift?
Your name's not Billy? Really? Then why do you react to it?
If you're an actor, am I your fuckin' audience?
Kids, look how many different directions his body went
It's okay, I'm not crazy, I got kids your age
Don't be afraid, I said don't be afraid! Behave!
Now y'all be cool now, I'm leaving now, it's beyond hot
'Bout to visit my wife after hitting the pawn shop for more glocks
I got some shit to fix (sinister chuckle) I got some shit to fix

[Mr. SOS]
Today's about to be one of the biggest days of my life
'Cause I'm about to ask the women I love if she'll be my wife
I just know that she will, for this women, I'll KILL
I used to clean dishes at Micky D's, now I'm on GRILL
So I've been able to save up enough money for this necklace
Along with this ring for when I pop the big question
But my manager's been stressin' the way I been dressin'
Tellin' me I need new shoes but I can't afford to get them!
He's all about perfection and does shit that I hate!
Today he wrote me up and I was only five minutes late!
And then he threatened to take me off grill and make me scrub plates
And the toilet where people shit out all the food they just ate!
AW FUCK! I'm starting to hear my screws bust
Screw it, I'll do it, He gives me Windex and a toothbrush
Now I'm scrubbin the toilet like, FUCK MY BOSS and HE STINKS!
I'm asking my girl to marry me, fuck what everyone thinks
Let me look at the ring now to calm me down like my shrink
NOOOOOO! I JUST LOST IT AND NOW IT'S LOST IN THE SINK
And today on my lunchbreak my girl's supposed to come through
I want to ask her but without the ring what'll I do?

Dialogue:
[SOS]: Wassup baby. Listen I want to tell you something.
[GIRL]: ""Yeah?""
[SOS]: Well, we've been together for a long time and...
[GIRL]: ""Uh huh...""
[SOS]: ...I love you more than anything in this world... Will you marry me?
[GIRL]: ""So where's the ring?""
[SOS]: I... I had one but... I dropped it in the sink...
my... my manager... he... he made me get off the grill and clean the toilets
and...(sob)
[GIRL]: Yeah... WHATEVER! I'm seeing somebody else anyway, loser!""

[SOS]: Grrrrrrrrrrr......

FUCK YOU FOR REAL! SNUFF TO YA GRILL! SMACK TO YA FACE!
FOOT TO YOUR CROTCH! Look at the cops...
THANKS FOR THE GAT! RAT-A-TAT-TAT! CRIME IN THE ACT!
BITCH, DO YOU WANT FRIES WITH THAT???
SICK cause my mind just snapped pretty hard!
Fatality... RIP YOUR TITTY OFF!
Pull out the gun that I got from the cop
And make her face look like Barbecue sauce.
Bite off her nipple like it's on the menu
And spit it out the drive through window inside a pinto and leave the driver
crippled
When I fire my pistol like it's a missile. (BLAOW!)
Start to hear sirens whistle I've lost my mind, it's official!
Grab my manager's pencil and stick it in his eye tissue
For having a time issue go to the bathroom and try to kick through
The sink. I made a mess and shot cops. Let off a couple of pop pops
ON THE CLOCK let me go before the alarm stops
I'ma take this damn ring to the pawn shop

To get my FUCKIN money back... (cries) fuckin bitch!

Ignition contact in my little compact
Nissan piece of shit and I need to quit
Funneling Night Train pummels my right brain
Feel the pain of a hangover, I smell the faint odor of piss
I need to lower my risk
Hittin my liver with this liquid deliverance
I'm fuckin laughin and stuck in traffic
As my 8-track tape deck pumps some wack shit
Its drastic
I walked in on my friend with his hand caught in my wife's panty elastic
While she was wearin em!
Started tearin em a new asshole verbally
I don't think I hurt em
Twisted off the MD and Bourbon
Got the straight vodka in my coffee thermos
Put on my game face and walk in the door
Of my job at the strip mall discount department store.

Dialogue:
[Boss]: Dan-O! Happy Birthday
[Kno]: Thanks!
[Boss]: Oh, before I forget uh, we're gonna have to let you go Dan-O.
[Kno]: What?!
[Boss]: Yeahh, we've been monitoring incoming packages for a while now, we
noticed you have a fetish for naked pictures of Janet Reno and Will Smith
CD's. Yeahh.
[Kno]: (crying)
[Boss]: Hey, uh...what's the machine gun in the paper bag for?

No, Mr. Johnson! YOUR ASS IS FIRED!
here's your pink slip get hit with six clips
Salepeople out front, I ain't forget ya'll
Split ya'll, and everybody in this strip mall
Walk in the Dollar Store and just let off
Now even the managers body is 50% off!
Hit up Toys are Us and bust my shit

Every Beat Of My Heart
Red Hot In Black
I met her in a little French cafe
Legs like a young giraffe
She was sitting reading Baudelaire
Not exactly working class

She had a studio in St. Michel
Crucifix around her waist
Che Guevara all over the wall
She can't stand the sun on her face

Hey boys, what a look
Stop a train at fifty feet
Matching hair, matching clothes and eyes
Kinda like a tiger in heat
Red hot in black
Red hot in black

Revolution running through her veins
A radical from head to toe
The only record that she ever played
Was ""just like a rolling stone""

We started talking by the candlelight
Her lips get closer to mine
We started dancing all around the room
Helped by a bottle of wine

Hey boys, mystery
Didn't even know her name
One night in Paris, with a girl like that
Never going home again
Red hot in black
Red hot in black

Oh my, when I woke up
She'd already gone out to her work
My head was aching and my back was scratched
I've never, never, never known a night like that

Took a walk along the avenue
So in love and so confused
My plane was leaving in half an hour
What would you have done in my shoes?

Hey boys, so you see
Couldn't get her outa my head

Red Hot In Black
I met her in a little French cafe
Legs like a young giraffe
She was sitting reading Baudelaire
Not exactly working class

She had a studio in St. Michel
Crucifix around her waist
Che Guevara all over the wall
She can't stand the sun on her face

Hey boys, what a look
Stop a train at fifty feet
Matching hair, matching clothes and eyes
Kinda like a tiger in heat
Red hot in black
Red hot in black

Revolution running through her veins
A radical from head to toe
The only record that she ever played
Was ""just like a rolling stone""

We started talking by the candlelight
Her lips get closer to mine
We started dancing all around the room
Helped by a bottle of wine

Hey boys, mystery
Didn't even know her name
One night in Paris, with a girl like that
Never going home again
Red hot in black
Red hot in black

Oh my, when I woke up
She'd already gone out to her work
My head was aching and my back was scratched
I've never, never, never known a night like that

Took a walk along the avenue
So in love and so confused
My plane was leaving in half an hour
What would you have done in my shoes?

Hey boys, so you see
Couldn't get her outa my head

Super Chick,"There's a cross on the side of the road
Where a mother lost a son
How could she know that the morning he left
Would be their last time she'd trade with him for a little more time
So she could say she loved him one last time
And hold him tight
But with life we never know

When we're coming up to the end of the road
So what do we do then
With tragedy around the bend?

[Chorus ]
We live we love
We forgive and never give up
'cause the days we are given are gifts from above
Today we remember to live and to love
We live we love
We forgive and never give up
'cause the days we are given are gifts from above
Today we remember to live and to love

There is a man who waits for the tests
To see if the cancer has spread yet
And now he asks, ""So why did I wait to live till it was time to die?""
If I could have the time back how I'd live
Life is such a gift
So how does the story end?
Well this is your story and it all depends
So don't let it become true
Get out and do what we are meant to do

[Chorus ]

Waking up to another dark morning
People are mourning
The weather in life outside is storming
But what would it take for the clouds to break
For us to realize each day is a gift somehow, someway
So get our heads up out of the darkness
And spark this new mindset and start to live life 'cause it ain't gone yet
And tragedy is a reminder to take off the blinders
And wake up and live the life we're supposed to take up
Moving forward with all our heads up 'cause life is worth living

[Chorus ] (to fade)",We Live,2010

Mocking Cain and Abel

Dizzied by smooth striped tights

Asphyxiating fumes of fear
Raise the golden curtain

Of what's perfectly unclear

Chiseled from a heart of stone
Marbled walls of pinkish white

Burning within
Waiting for goodbye

Just what it's all about
Drowning by your own design

And reached for his gun

He was paranoid for foxes had been
Chewing up his stock
And now he prayed for a scapegoat
To behead upon the block

The colour of ginger red
Now in the distance the farmer looked
With a gun aimed at his head

He put two plus two together thinking
Red would equal fox
As he squeezed the trigger I believe
That he was totally off his box

Well my friend was rushed to hospital
In an ambulance of grief
And his father had a heart attack
In the shock of disbelief

Fly to Vegas, got a meeting with the owner
You can get the penthouse if you want to

Baby we should talk about starting a family
Actually, we could talk about the ring size

Pourquoi ma musique transperce les cœurs?
Parce que la vie ne nous a pas fait d'fleur
Certains m'ont prédit un avenir cagoulé
Car j'étais pas doué

Et tu nous parles de toutes tes valeurs, tes peines, tes malheurs

Baja hasta el valle que la nieve cubrió
Los pastorcillos quieren ver a su Rey,
Le traen regalos en su humilde zurrón

Yo quisiera poner a tu pies
Algún presente que te agrade Señor,
Más tú ya sabes que soy pobre también,
Y no poseo más que un viejo tambor
(rom pom pom pom, rom pom pom pom)
En tu honor frente al portal tocaré

Superb,"Yeah, State vs. Kirk Jones, Judge Battle now residing 
Got a case of armed robbery that ended up in violence 
Maximum sentence, life in jail's what you're facin' 
Prosecution set it with your opening statement

Your honor, before we get started
I'd like to give my condolences to the family of the dearly departed 
Tyrone survived by his mother Barbara
His two year old daughter T'want to 
And the baby's mamma Sandra 
[He's a murderer! That animal killed my baby's father!]

Order in the court!

I'm sorry for the outburst your honor 
I have an original copy of the police report 
January the 4th the day that Kirk Jones got caught
The forensic report states there was a gun in the car 
And gunpowder residue on Mr. Jones' right arm 
Baliff, could you please pass this report to Judge Battle 
Mr. Fitzpatrick there's a few questions I'd like to ask you 
You said you was outside the store in Manhattan 
So could you please tell this court what you saw happened 

Yeah he killed Tyrone 
I saw everything, the argument, how son drawed, hose and everything 
The worst shit I saw in my life 
I want to testify I swear before God it was Kirk Jones, no lie 

Did you see that man in court today?
Do you think that you could point him out?

Yes that's him right there 

Are you sure?

Yeah without a doubt 
Same nigga that took my Pumas but I ain't hold no grudge 
Remembered his foul ass when I saw the blood 

You stated you had a run in with Kirk Jones before 
In your opinion is he the type that would rob a jewelry store?

Your honor, objection!
His opinion should be stricken from the record!

Objection sustained, prosecution next question 

I'd like to call my next eyewitness Mr. Paul Dejour 
Paul could tell us what happened inside the store?
(Scarred for life)
Yeah, it was about 20 past, I saw the S class 
Pull up in the reflection in the mirror in the store glass 
And quicker that you could say, nigga kiss my ass 
He hopped out of the passenger side wit a black ski mask 
I saw somebody run up in the store and order us on the floor 
Yo I swore I was a goner for sure 
He tried to snatch Tyrone's bracelet 
It just appraised to the twenty grand and Tyrone wouldn't let him take it 

Is that the moment when he shot him?
(Scarred for life)
Yeah man that's when he popped him 
I was so scared I laid there, played possum 
He started to blast this way, 'til the gat was empty 
He took the gun handle and broke the glass display 
He emptied all of the trays and ran out the store
And I watched Tyrone bleed to death on the floor 
I can't remember no more, that's all that... 

Okay, okay calm down 
I have no further questions your honor 

Court is now in session, now gettin' back to business 
Pat Haley for defense please call your first witness 

Yeah aight your honor, I call up Henry Lace
He's the witness that I'm cross examinin' for the case 

Yeah I testify your honor, it was death by dishonor 
It was a crime committed, I swear to you I know who did it 
It happened so fast, I didn't see a lot of it 
But I know for a fact he stuck a gun to his esophagus 

Wait, wait, wait objection your honor, his statement's preposterous 
There was no weapons found, no sign of no hostages 
Remember Mr. Henry Lace you under oath [yeah I know]
You lyin' in the stand to get him fryin' in the pan 
Now where was you the night you claim he shot Tyrone 
You and holmes had beef before Kirk got home 
Was you mad because he came home bangin' your chick [what you talkin' 'bout?]
Got your boys out the hood now they slangin' and shit 
I know you mad that's why you in court, turnin' on him 
Kirk cold blooded killer wit no burner on him 
Come on you don't believe he murdered Tyrone 
I believe you wasn't there you just heard it by phone 

Man you crazy man I was right there... (Yeah right... I read your rapsheet...
calm down, calm down, chill, chill, Kirk, Kirk...) 

No he wasn't! He's lyin! Fuck you you liar!
Man fuck that he's lyin he wasn't even there man!
(He killed Tyrone man! Fuck that!) No I didn't! 
Man he's lyin' man! He's lyin' 

Order in the court now I'm warning you defense 
Tell your client take it down, matter fact 'proach the bench 
Counsel in my chambers so that we can situate 
Let the jury be excused so they can go deliberate...

Yo man, Mr. Haley what kind of defense is this man!
What you doin' man?! She gon' fuckin' hang me man!
No! Sh-she's got it in for me I'm tellin' you man!
You promised you'd get me off man!

In the case of the State vs. Kirk Jones you heard it 
Both sides testified and the jury reached a verdict 
Guilty! All counts from theft to murder one 
(Huh? Wha-wha-what?! Guilty?!] 
By the time you gettin' out you gon' have a grandson 

Fuck you bitch I'll see you in hell bitch!
Fuck that!! Fuck that!! Fuck, get off me! Fuck you Pat Haley!!
(What?! Get him out of my courtroom!!)
Fuck the judge, fuck everybody!! 
(Baliff, baliff remove him from my courtroom...)
Fuck this shit!! I hope you all burn in hell!!!

Always oil my guns and inspect my triggas
Sometimes I call my lawyer just to check my figures
He told me not to worry, all cheques is clearin'
So fuck my rhymes, I got the best appearance
And I survive through project experience
You wanna roll dice or roll and ride?
No matter, you gon' get holes inside

Dun, do you wanna gun to make you slim?

Pop all parlors and fuckin' with money scholars

Get your dollar (New York, up the ladder to the hill of success)
Pop all collars (you know what we gonna do)
Just pop your collar (New York, say no more, New York, say no more)

Been off the Jackey Don, rollin' the dice with a happy arm
Everything good, money on wood
Bank stoppers, I send them home broke
Have them all in they stash, bettin' they own coat
I takes it all, fifty and better, you make the call
Watch you break your all, big sixes 'cause I'm a nigga who don't like to fall
High roller, see how my dice kiss
Push you pay me, and if I roll trips you pay me twice bitch
I rocks, believe it or not
Come broke to a dice game, step off and leave with a knot
Head cracks is all you see when I'm hot
What's in the pop? A hunnid G's to the bank to the man, who got it stopped
My hand is like a gun, feel the heat when it's cocked
Four, five, six your heart drop, way deep in your socks
You wanna walk, broke your ass down the street with a bop
The drinks is on you tonight, from my peeps in the spot

Got big boy toys, push Sixes

Like George Jefferson and em, steppin on em

You program, broke bottles of Dom
Seven inch bangles, back breakers
I'm a dope fiend, look at my arm, Popeye strength
Rap with a British accent, Gucci clothes
Dennis Coles in the latest fashions
Blow backs in, flip raps like fourty-eight bundles
Dinner plates, deadly front gates, celeb Bryant Gumbel

Analyze This shit like Deniro, words in your center earhole
Blocks of ice like Sub-Zero, we been right since day zero
Shatter your soul like glass windows
Turn virgins to nymphos, pop these hollows at fake cats in a Tahoe
Wild out, throw your liquor bottles at hood rats to the richest models
We conversate like Christ and the twelve apostles

Superbutt,"Read their lips and give them something to say
Read their minds and give'em a reason to pray
Be a friend of your demons today
Shake the hands of Mr. Disarray

Throw that stone, break that bone, tilt that throne, push it prone
Get a life of your own!
Throw that stone, break that bone, tilt that throne, push it prone
Get a life of your own!

Sit, and see how they spin
They fly in the air, gently touching your skin
Keep them in the house, fix 'em with a pin
They will sweeten your drink and the poison within

Throw that stone, break that bone, tilt that throne, push it prone
Get a life of your own!

I'm not the average girl from your video
And I ain't built like a supermodel

When I look in the mirror and the only one there is me
Every freckle on my face is where it's suppose to be
And I know my creator didn't make no mistakes on me

My momma said a lady ain't what she wears but what she knowsâ?¦
But I've drawn the conclusion, it's all an illusion
Confusion's the name of the game
A misconception, a mass deception,
Something gotta change

Now don't be offended this is all my opinion
Ain't nothing that I'm saying law
This is a true confession 
Of a life learned lesson 
I was sent here to share with y'all
So get in when you fit in
Go on and shine
Clear your mind 
Now's the time
Put your salt on the shelf
Go on and love yourself
Cause everything's gonna be alright

Keep your fancy drink, and your expensive minks
I don't need that to have a good time
Keep your expensive cars and your caviar
All I need is my guitar

Keep your crystal and your pistol
I'd rather have a pretty piece of crystal
Don't need you silicone, I prefer my own
What god gave me is just fine

Superchick,"This is the remix of Hero

No one sits with him,he doesn't fit in
But we feel like we do when we make fun of him
Cause you want to belong,do you go along?
Cause his pain is the price paid for you to belong
It's not like you hate him or want him to die
But maybe he goes home and thinks suicide
Or he comes back to school with a gun at his side 
And any kindness from you might have saved his life
Heroes are made when you make a choice 

You could be a hero - heroes do what's right
You could be a hero - you might save a life
You could be a hero - you could join the fight
For what's right, for what's right, for what's right

No one talks to her, she feels so alone
She's in too much pain to survive on her own
The hurt she can't handle overflows to a knife
She writes on her arm wants to give up her life
Each day she goes on is a day that she's brave
Fighting the lie that giving up is the way
Each moment of courage her own life she saves
When she throws the pills out a hero is made
Heroes are made when you make a choice

You could be a hero - heroes do what's right
You could be a hero - you might save a life
You could be a hero - you could join the fight
For what's right, for what's right, for what's right

No one talks to him about how he lives
He thinks that the choices he makes are just his
Doesn't know he's a leader with the way he behaves
And others will follow the choices he's made 
He lives on the edge, he's old enough to decide
His brother who wants to be him is just nine
He can do what he wants because it's his right
The choices he makes change a nine-year-old's life

You could be a hero - heroes do what's right
You could be a hero - you might save a life
You could be a hero - you could join the fight
For what's right, for what's right, for what's right

Little mikey d was the one in class
Who every day got totally harassed
This went on for years until he decided
That ever again would he shed another tear
So he walked out the door
Grabbed a 4.4 out of his father's dresser drawer
And said I can't take life no more
And like that a life is lost
But this ain't even about that
All of us just sat back
And watched it happen
Thinking it's not my responsibility 
To solve a problem that isn't about me
This is our problem
This is just one of the daily scenarios
In which we chose to cause a riot
Instead of doing the right thing
If we make a choice
Be the voice
To those who won't speak up for themselves
How many lives would be saved
Changed, rearranged
Now it's our job
To take a shot
Now don't keep walking by
Now why didn't you try
Cause you don't want to exist 
And never be seen
So let's wake up 
Change the world
Our time is now

You could be a hero - (our time is now) heroes do what's right
You could be a hero - (our time is now) you might save a life
You could be a hero - (our time is now) you could join the fight

Superchick,"No one sits with him, he doesn't fit in
But we feel like we do when we make fun of him
'Cause you want to belong, do you go along?
'Cause his pain is the price paid for you to belong
It's not like you hate him or want him to die
But maybe he goes home and thinks suicide
Or he comes back to school with a gun at his side 
And any kindness from you might have saved his life
Heroes are made when you make a choice 

You could be a hero, heroes do what's right
You could be a hero, you might save a life
You could be a hero, you could join the fight
For what's right,  for what's right,  for what's right

No one talks to her,  she feels so alone
She's in too much pain to survive on her own
The hurt she can't handle overflows to a knife
She writes on her arm wants to give up her life
Each day she goes on is a day that she's brave
Fighting the lie that giving up is the way
Each moment of courage her own life she saves
When she throws the pills out a hero is made
Heroes are made when you make a choice

You could be a hero, heroes do what's right
You could be a hero, you might save a life
You could be a hero, you could join the fight
For what's right,  for what's right,  for what's right

No one talks to him about how he lives
He thinks that the choices he makes are just his
Doesn't know he's a leader with the way he behaves
And others will follow the choices he's made 
He lives on the edge,  he's old enough to decide
His brother who wants to be him is just nine
He can do what he wants because it's his right
The choices he makes change a nine-year-old's life

You could be a hero, heroes do what's right
You could be a hero, you might save a life
You could be a hero, you could join the fight
For what's right,  for what's right,  for what's right

Little Mikey D was the one in class
Who every day got totally harassed
This went on for years until he decided
That ever again would he shed another tear
So he walked out the door
Grabbed a 4.4 out of his father's dresser drawer
And said I can't take life no more
And like that a life is lost
But this ain't even about that
All of us just sat back
And watched it happen
Thinking it's not my responsibility 
To solve a problem that isn't about me
This is our problem
This is just one of the daily scenarios
In which we chose to cause a riot
Instead of doing the right thing
If we make a choice
Be the voice
To those who won't speak up for themselves
How many lives would be saved
Changed,  rearranged
Now it's our job
To take a shot
Now don't keep walking by
Now why didn't you try
'Cause you don't want to exist 
And never be seen
So let's wake up 
Change the world
Our time is now

You could be a hero, (our time is now) heroes do what's right
You could be a hero, (our time is now) you might save a life
You could be a hero, (our time is now) you could join the fight

When the two that raise you up and call it quits
Nobody told me bout the emptiness,
When the place you call home is closed for business
I push the pain down, I gotta get by
Always knowin in my heart that it ain't gonna fly
Rock bottom's never felt so near before
And if pain is God's megaphone, it's loud and clear
So hold me now Father, human love ain't enough
I've failed and been failed by the people I love
But Your faithful arms, they surround me
And any other soul who has to sail those seas
Of a broken family

Tellin me that cancer might cause her to die
How could this be? I thought that God loved me
So why would He try to take my mother from me
As I cry myself to sleep at night
Holdin on my pillow tight
He spoke to me and said that everything was gonna be alright
So I try to fight all the pain that it caused
I try to move on and I try to stay strong
So put your hands up if you're feeling me
And put your hands up for everyone to see

When we're coming up to the end of the road

Today we remember to live and to love
We live we love

For us to realize each day is a gift somehow, someway

Turns to ashes in your hand

As the sun falls to your feet,
And the choices seem to slip away,
Lost in the shade.

Strips, of you,
Are peeling through the core.
Drowning who,
And all that you adore 

As the sun falls to your feet,
And the choices seem to slip away,
Lost in the shade.
Lost in the shade.
Lost in the shade.

So keep the word,so keep the word

Infamously

Infamously hated 
Kill every generation known
It's stupid that they look like
The generation's fucking old
But they're new!
They're new because the media says so
They're new because the media likes it
They're new because
The media sucks up

The turning point, waiting for it, a time bomb, I'm waiting for 
The turning point, to lead my life from endless rage, to rip out 
The page, expect the worst, you get the best, I'll wait out the rest, 

The turning point. waiting. endless is waiting 
It will be just for me, not her or him or them with hands out 
Breaking free of the family, of the lawyers and the vampire 
Half wits - Waiting for the turning point... 

Waiting for the turning point... 
I'm waiting; I'm fucking waiting

Superjoint Ritual,"God, my eyes were wide, an open casket smile
You were never liked at all, and I'm fucking glad you're gone
You would rip off, a pervert jackoff, big talk-no show
Broken back bone

You never looked better, dead and gone
I never felt better, you're dead and gone and,
I wish I would have done, what nature finished first
I'd done it with my hand, then left and shot myself

I committed a felony, I never had much trouble before
First time offender

But I got put through the ringer
And my bank account shrunk a lot
They set an example, however
There's not a chance, no way through me

You've never forgiven, exploited in dirt, it bothers you, it tortures you
One more plight, left in life, shoot me dead, in the head
Catch me if you can

Never touch me, never come near me
You're a punk, a bunch of words, not one percent
You're found out, if you were me, you'd be in luck
But you're not, so you suck

Show me a dollar, I'll show you no heart
Show me a heart, and I'll show you my eyes

Wrong inside

Given the inch, crippled a mile, the pull of the dragon, the pull of the drug
I can't see what the big fucking deal is?!
No repentance, no respect, blown up eyes, blown up skies!
I can't see what the big fucking deal is?!

Superpoze,"Ciudades invisibles 
Estática en el jardín 
Flota la lluvia en el aire 
Con películas de otra dimensión 
Voces melancólicas 
Susurros de humanidad 
Que danzan con la neblina 
Y que se apoderan de la escena final 

Y después secos los dos 
Florecer entre piedras 

Sí al final salgo de mi cuerpo 
Y hago girar el cristal 
Y después me aferro al misterio 
Y vuelvo a abrir semillas en saturno 
Sí al final salgo de mi cuerpo 
Y hago girar el cristal",Ciudades Invisibles,2015
Supersax,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again
Seems like pretending it isn't the ending
Two friends drifting apart
Two friends, but one broken heart
We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died",Just Friends,1973
Supersax,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 

Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 
Oh lady be good to me.","Oh, Lady Be Good",1973
Supersax,"Ever since the lucky night I found you
I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.",Don't Blame Me,1983
Supersax,"In the still of the night
As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Just like that moon growing dim
Way out on the rim of the hill
In the still of the night",In the Still of the Night,1983
Supersax,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You,1983
Supersax,"Star eyes,
That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Star eyes,
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

Star eyes,
When if ever, will my lips know
If it's me for whom those eyes glow?
Makes no diff'rence where you are,
Your eyes still hold my wishing star,
Oh, star eyes, how lovely you are.",Star Eyes,1983
Supersax,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1983
Supersax,"Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you

Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me
You and you alone
Bring out the Gypsy in me

I love all the many charms about you
Above all, I want my arms about you

Don't be a naughty baby
Come to mama, come to mama do
My sweet embraceable you

I love all the many charms about you
Above all, I want my arms about you

He want to learn, I say give em a chance
He fuck up and the devil'll be havin a last dance
I think he'll do it right, he knows the consequences
The fuck up after that, that shit's true extenses
Every time came we took out, he was the lookout

I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an ""L"" on her forehead

Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now you're a Rock Star get the show on get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now but wait 'til you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire how about yours
That's the way I like it and I never get bored

Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas
I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change

Cause I know you really want me
I hear your friends talk about me
So why you tryin' to do without me
When you got me
Where you want me

Maybe someday, you and me can run away
