Old memories creep, more, more, more

Man man, look up at the sky
All the stars man, the stars is beautiful tonight
Look at em!

[Chorus: Mya]
Ghetto superstar, that is what you are
Comin from afar, reachin for the stars
Run away with me, to another place
We can rely on each other, uh-huh
From one corner, to another, uh-huh

[Pras]
Uh, yeah, yo, yo
Some got, hopes and dreams, we got, ways and means
The surpreme dream team, always up with the schemes
From hubcaps to sellin raps, name your theme
My rise to the top, floatin on this cream
Who the hell want to stop me, I hated those who doubt me
A million ReFugees with unlimited warranties
Black Caesar, dating top divas
Diplomatic immunity, no time for a Visa
And just because, I'ma shoot them one by one
Got five sides to me, somethin like a pentagon
Strike with the forces of King Solomon
Lettin bygone be bygone, and so on, and so on
I'ma teach this cat, how to live in the ghetto
Keepin it retro-spective from the get go
Lay low, let my mind shine like a halo
P-P-Politic with ghetto senators on the d-low

[Chorus]

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
One two, and you don't stop, yo
My eyes is sore, bein the senator
Behind closed doors hittin truth to the seafloor
The rich go North ignore, the tug of war
While the kids are poor, open more and better drug stores
So I became hardcore, couldn't take it no more
I'ma reveal EVERYTHING, change the law
I find myself, walkin the streets
Tryin to find what's really goin on in the streets

[Pras]
Yea, yo, yo, yo
Now every dog got his day, needless to say
When the chief away that's when them cats want to play
I told you, dance around these fools like Cassius Clay
Stretch my heater and make you do a pas de bourre
Kick your balls like Pele, pick em doin ballet
Peak like Dante, broader than Broadway
Get applause like a matador, crowd yellin !Ole!
Who the hell want to see me, from B.K., to Cali
Come on

[Chorus]

[Pras]
Yeah... yo, yeah
Just when you thought it was safe in a common place
Showcase your finances, losin bets in the horse race
Two faced, gettin defaced, out like Scarface
Throw your roll money, let me put on my screwface
[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Well I'm paranoid at the things I said
Wonderin what's the penalty from day to day, I'm hangin out
partyin with girls that never die, the C.O.'s
pickin on the small fries, my campaign tellin lies
Was just spreadin my love, didn't know my love
was the one holdin the gun in the glove
But it's all good as long as it's understood
It's all together now, in the hooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood

Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh

Mya,"No, no

Picture of perfection, the object of a nigga affection
Partners in passionate sex, a place to put my erection
Fantasies of you in submission, freaky positions
Pushin', pullin' and twistin' I'm on a mission got me on the mash
Tried to dig, you was screamin' when I did
Steady yellin' out spots for me to hit, and ""aw shit""
Soon as I seen her saw us playin' hide the weiner
Wanna ""Freak Like Me"", fuck Adina
Up and down is the object, side to side
Make you holla out my name when a thug nigga ride, ""Can I cum inside?""
Say you don't feel it that's a lie, you just scared to get this
Penitentiary dick, the trot caught your eye
When I walked by, I said, ""Hi""
But you was so shy, I can't lie, damn near stuttered when you walked by
You want me to lick it and even worse
Got your heart set on me goin' first, and that ain't no fair exchange

Only one thing that you, can do, for me
Baby you can treat me right, we can do it all the night
Nothin' more than our fair exchange
Hit my G-spot and make, me scream, your name
You can do whatever you want, I got what I want and gone
Nothin' more than our fair exchange

Open your legs
Got me marchin' like it's a million, you tremble from the feelin'
Look up, cause I got mirrors on the ceilin'
And if you willin', then we can ride until the sun shine
And just for fun, I betchu I can make you cum 61 times
Close your eyes, let me heat it up
Cause when we fuck I refuse to bust a nut until I beat it up
Drop the top, time to fuck while the wind blow
Baby throw yo' legs out the window
Remember on the balcony, bend over baby bounce on me
And let me hit it where it counts and flee
Remember me? ""I Get Around,"" and I'm haunted by my ""Temptations""
Sexual participation, my motivation
Even though I like the way you work it
You don't deserve it cause you walk around actin' like you perfect
Took a while but I finally got it, and like a boss player
Bitch you ain't doin' me no favors
Fair exchange

Only one thing that you, can do, for me
Baby you can treat me right, we can do it all the night
Nothin' more than our fair exchange
Hit my G-spot and make, me scream, your name
You can get whatever you want, I got what I want and gone
Nothin' more than our fair exchange

Now yo' attitude ain't realistic
Yeah it's true I'm gettin' pussy, but baby you gettin' dick!
And since you bein' laced with the penetration
It's only right to show a form of appreciation
Instead of fakin' like you can't hear the bed shakin'
In bed naked you so twisted think yo' legs breakin'
You said take it so I'm blind in my passion, how long will I last?
Doggy style steady pumpin' on that ass, until I blast
And then I laugh as we lay back
See I wait 'til you asleep and that's the payback
Cause you actin' like you did somethin', givin' me a piece
I had you mufflin' your screams in the sheets, fuckin' with me
A true digger that love triggers, a thug nigga
Hustlin' bitches like drug dealers
Before I say goodbye, put an end to all the games
Here's my number for another fair exchange

(It's only one!) Only one thing that you, can do (thing that you can do for me), for me
Baby you can treat me right, we can do it all the night
Nothin' more than our fair exchange
Hit my G-spot and make, me scream, your name (make me scream baby)
You can get whatever you want, I got what I want and gone
Nothin' more than our fair exchange
Only one thing that you (whatever you want), can do, for me
Baby you can treat me right (can you do me), we can do it all the night
Nothin' more than our fair exchange
Hit my G-spot and make, me scream, your name
You can get whatever you want, I got what I want and gone
Nothin' more than our fair exchange

Fair exchange
No one, gives me lovin' (lovin')
Quite like you do (No one gives me lovin' like you do)
No one, gives me lovin'
Quite like you do (that I knows, you know, you love, I love)

Mya,"When we first met I told myself you were the one
To lay up next to me
Late at night when work was done
You looked into me eyes
How could somethin' so right be wrong?
I gotta find a way to leave him for you

So I start a fight
To get him mad at me
Then we'll be breakin' up, temporarily
That's when I'm callin' you
To head over your house
Baby I love the way you take care of me when you see me down
I love it when you're tellin' me

Hurry up, come quick, I'm here for you
Don't cry baby, he ain't shit

Hurry up, come quick, I'll be waitin' for you
I gotta find a way to leave him for you

Uh uh uh, uh, hurry up
Uh uh uh uh, hurry up

When I lay down at night
Why the hell are you on my mind?
When I'm up next to him?
Maybe ?'cause he don't treat me right
You could be lovin' me
I know he does his thing on the side
Gotta find me a good reason to leave

So I start another fight
To get him mad at me

Without you wouldn't know what I would do wit myself
When you with me you comfortable
We can start a family like the Huxtables

He had the nerve to call me crazy, deranged
A victim of child abuse
Said somethin' was wrong with my head
Told me someone was messin' with my mind
Said you gotta get out the situation girl
It's only a matter of time
And I knew he was right
One day I'm gonna wake up
And find the strength to leave your ass behind
Maybe if your paper wasn't stacked
Or of the sex was wack
Or maybe if you was fat
But damn

Damn you make it so hard to leave you
Why you gotta look so good
I don't want nobody else to have you

Throw me in the penitentiary, before there's tragedy

Hit the road, here's some cash

The world turns. But our love remains the same
Things come & go. Winter. Summer. Spring and Fall 
Through it all. Our love remains the same

I don't know how it all happened but (But) you're everything and more (Everything & more)
Even though I might lose you because I don't work hard enough
Figured since you lost my trust (Ooh) that we would just fall apart (Yeah)
Now I realize I need to wake up 
So I'm giving you all my heart

(I remember) Oh watchin' the clouds go by 
(You were always there) Always right there by my side 
(Can't forget you)I can't forget you as I reminisce on this tree
You were the only one. That was in my life
Who showed me consistency

[Repeat Hook]

Things change from year to year, girl
But my love for you is always here, girl
Never 'fraid. Never have no fear
Baby call me and I will appear. Well

Whatever you want to do. Oh my baby it's cool 
Take my hand let's make plans
Just as long (As you are here and boy I'm with you)

Do you remember
How we made it through the rain

Hoping I find

Make it through the very end
Baby I believe you never
I just want to spend forever with you

And if you say hide, we'll hide

Would break my heart in two
If you should fall into my arms
And tremble like a flower

Let's dance, for fear your grace should fall
Let's dance, for fear tonight is all
Let's sway, you could look into my eyes
Let's sway, under the moonlight, this serious moonlight

And if you say run, I'll run with you

Ah-yo excuse me miss, how do you do, you're probably used to this,
'Cause mami chula you're the bomb and your fuse is lit,
Me-I'm coola than the farms, cause I'm smooth and swift,
The type to pull up in to your prom in a brand new 6,

I'm old school, I use the charm to seduce the chicks,
You'll introduce me to ya moms as your future pick,
Your like benita applebalm, or some exclusive shit,
Waiting for you to put me on cause I refuse to quit,

And the truth is- you make a nigga lose his grip,
'Cause I just can't resist the way you move them hips,
The way you walk and you talk with them beautiful lips,
Got a New York train of thought, so you think you the shit,

A suitable fit, you even keep your cuticles ?clipped?,
Fully equipped, heavy duty boo, you truly a gift,
You a cuty with a mind, not a groupie or trick,
Rich in beauty cause you shine without jewelry and chips

[Chorus]
Papi, please be my sugar daddy,
I want you to rule my world,
Dry kisses that taste like candy,
Can I be your sugar girl,
Just put some ice on my pinky ring,
And fly me around the world,
I owe it to papi, I need my sugar daddy,
And I'll be your sugar girl

Yeah yo yo,
Mami you sweet like licorice, deep and articulate,
Baby you look delicious from your feet to your fingertips,
Unique and conspicuous, plus your body's ridiculous,

Make me want to lick my lips and lick you where you ticklish,
Picture this- Lamborghini's, mansions and yachts, 
Trips to Tahiti instead of standing on the block,
Baby I can be your genie man and grant you them rocks,

Ice up your watch, and freeze the hands on your glock,
We can dance till we drop, in the sands of the trops,
Romance is so hot-you'll catch a tan on the spot,
Anxious to shop, I just hand you a knot,

And make you say (ain't no nigga like the one I got)

[Chorus]

Yo, now baby I'm a thug, plus a player by blood,
But we can lay in the tub, play with the bubbles while I'm rubbing ya butt,
Hugging you tight, like I'm cuffing the mic, loving you right,
So light up the candlelights, because we crushing tonight,

It's such a sight- touch you where you like it, hush and feel the tight grip,
'Cause I'm the type of private dancer that'll work the nightshift,
This kid will make you scream my name out, to let the pain out,
Once I hopped in the train I never came out,

The same wild individual from the playhouse,
Who stayed out all day at the bar, till' they said â??get outâ??,
I'm straight out the player's club,
Rocking gators with leather gloves,

Tailor-made tux showing the ladies love,
I'm way above average, I know you love Paris,
But we can ride our horse and carriage through the bronx traffic,

From one corner to another, uh, uh

Uh yeah, yo, yo,
Some got, hopes and dreams, we got, ways and means
The supreme dream team, always up with the schemes
From hubcaps to sellin' raps, name your theme
My rise to the top, floatin' on this cream

Who the hell wanna stop me, I hated those who doubt me
A million refugees with unlimited warranties
Black Caesar, dating top squeezers
Diplomatic legalese, no time for a Visa

They just begun, I'ma shoot them one by one
Got five sides to me, somethin' like a pentagon
Strike with the forces of King Solomon
Lettin' bygones be bygones and so on and so on

I'ma teach this cat, how to live in the ghetto
Keepin' it retrospective from the get go
Lay low, let my mind shine like a halo
Politic with ghetto senators on the deelow

Behind closed doors hittin' truth to the sea floor
The rich go North ignore, the tug of war
While the kids are poor, open new and better drug stores

I'ma reveal everything, change the law
I find myself, walkin' the streets
Tryin' to find what's really goin' on in the streets

When the chief away that's when them cats want to play
I told you, mess around you fools like Cassius Clay

Stretch my heater make you do a pas de bourree
Kick your balls like Pele, pick em doin' ballet
Peak like Dante, broader than Broadway
Get applause like a matador, cry yellin', ole
Who the hell wanna save me, from B.K., to Cali, come on

Ghetto superstar, that is what you are
Comin' from afar reachin' for the stars
Run away with me to another place
We can rely on each other, uh, uh
From one corner to another, uh, uh

Yeah, yo, yeah
Just when you thought it was safe in a common place
Showcase your finest is losin fast in the horse race
Two faced, gettin' defaced, out like Scarface
Throw your roll money, let me put on my screw face

Well, I'm paranoid at the things I said
Wonderin' what's the penalty from day to day, I'm hangin' out
Partyin' with girls that never die, you see I was
Pickin' on the small fries, my campaign tellin' lies

Was just spreadin' my love, didn't know my love
Was the one holdin' the gun and the glove
But it's all good as long as it's understand
It's all together now, in the hood

We ain't as close as we should be
That's cause your holding back
Holding back your love for me
How do you expect to grow if you just don't let go

Chorus(Marques Houston)

Why you tryna hold back
Why you tryna hold back
When you know you want it just like I do
Why you acting like that, girl don't do me like that
All I'm tryna do is be next to you
Why you tryna hold back
Why you tryna hold back on me baby
All I want is you stop holdin back on me

Verse 2(Mya)

don't take offense to this
Not tryna start no mess
Ain't tryna have you stressed
This is just a little test
I wanna see how serious
Serious you are of us
Do you like or like me not
I'm loving what we've got
Only thing that bothers me 
We ain't close as we should be
That's cause your holding back
Holding back you love for me
How do expect this thing to grow
If you don't let it go go go go

Chorus(Mya and Marques Houston)

Babe
Why you tryna hold back
Why you tryna hold back
When you know you want it just like I do
Why you acting like that, girl don't do me like that
All I'm tryna do is be next to you
Why you tryna hold back
Why you tryna hold back on me baby
All I want is you stop holdin back on me

Verse 3(Shawnna)
Everytime I get to thinking bout you
I see I can't be without you
Cause you that shit, that's it
And I really can't leave right now boo
You my fix, your kiss
Made me bout to let go bout to
But wait right quick can't slip
I don't really think your down with this
See I played these games before
And I fall everytime we go
Cause see I can't no more
I move slow but don't really wanna stop the flow
Don't know what to do
Gotta just relax and hold back
Just sit back and roll that, roll that, rolle that

Chorus(Mya and Marques Houston)

Babe
Why you tryna hold back
Why you tryna hold back
When you know you want it just like I do
Wht you acting like that, girl don't do me like that
All I'm tryna do is be next to you
Why you tryna hold back
Why you tryna hold back on me baby
All I want is you stop holding back on me

Outro(Shawnna)

Why you treat me like you do?
Can it just be me and you?
Cause I just can't get enough
And I just wanna feel you touch
Wutsup wutsup 
Why you treat me like you do?
Can it just be me and you?
Cause I just can't get enough
And I just wanna feel you touch
I just gotta know whatsup, wutsup, wutsup

Mya,"God Damn
When will a nigga get a brake
I work so damn hard but I never come up I do worse with ever breath I take
Sunshine is a luxury
Just to see another day is enough for me
Cause I'm livin' on borrowed time
Every school I go to it might be mine it might be mine
God Damn, I'm trying to hold on to my faith
They use to tell me it was going to get greater later later
Now it's later and I'm still I'm the same place
Anytime I get off the ground
Some crooked ass niggas pull me back down
Bald fade on my fade
Feeling helpless and it's written all over my face

Here we go again just to live another season
I keep my faith in god to peace these demons
Sometimes I win the battle it doesn't mean I win the war
I got to laugh to keep from crying good times I really wonder what they are

Even if I fell there's no reason to feel ashamed
Cause I use to lose I had an opportunity to play in the game
I can't be stopped 98 percent from the field
But they won't pass the rock
Even tho I'm wide open for the shot
Got me ready to scream fuck my team
Seem like the players I'm running with don't want me to touch my dream
With my own hands I'm tired of making money in the name of brothers
I'm trying to touch it with my own hands
Make me wanna rob a bank sometimes
But then I have to spend my life my life my life my life
Dunken one time
And end up back in the pen
So I'm stuck as starter paid as if I was ridin' a Benz
I know it look like I rich but it's not
I just how to take what I got and wipe it so it looks like a lot
Sometimes I wanna give up but when I look at my daughter
I got to survive

Here we go again just to live another season
I keep my faith in god to peace these demons
Sometimes I win the battle it doesn't mean I win the war
I got to laugh to keep from crying good times I really wonder what they are

To many niggas trying to take me off of my game
I'm trying to do something good but because I'm from the hood I always end up in these chains
When you see me in the town you ain't got to slow down I'm in love with my own company
Foney homies see me on the TV and I can see them coming to get me in my sleep
That's why I'm staying sucker free
Cause dealing with hard times is enough for me
I don't need no help my nigga I can do bad on my own
I'm so tried tried tried tried
I'm so tried tried tried tried
But I'm a keep on pushing

Here we go again just to live another season
I keep my faith in god to peace these demons
Sometimes I win the battle it doesn't mean I win the war
I got to laugh to keep from crying good times I really wonder what they are

Watchin' the OG's in the hood while they flossin' in they rides
Candy paint, chrome wheels, and black magic on the attire
Me, yeah I was lovin' it, but not old enough drive
Parkin' lot pimpin' from the passenger side
I use to walk everywhere I had to show up
Shoe hills, one down like wheel rubber, man I was about to go nuts
Hopefully I would blow up in these rap game man
My people roll swanga's, I wanted to be rollin' the same thang
Never had alot of work, but I was doin' what I could
Movin' nickles, dimes, twenty's, and ounces all threw my hood
Since I had a one yolla fines cash me up
Mean while thumpin' for a ride my homies pass me up
It's all gravy, when I'm able I'm a showin' all somthin'
From a hopte to a foreign, I'm ballin' it's all or nothin'
Treat my feet with' designer to fine sneak's when I leave my home
Only place you catch me walkin' is to my mail box's
Cause on the streets I be on crome

I'll keep rollin' chrome
I'll keep rollin' chrome
Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on
I'll keep rollin' chrome

Huh, I started off with' a canary yellow cutlass supreme on bald tire's
Yeah I know I was out of line
But that was all I could find
Or should I say that was all I could purchase for what I had to spend
But at least I had somthin' to go from point A to B and
No more offerin' gas money to get a lift
Besides when your driven it's easyer to get a chick
So ani't no more parkin' lot pimpin' at the club I'm up in there
Seekin' little mama, with' thick thighs, I hope she let me in there
Like swim wear, pull up to the motel, and we'll go in there
Nothin' left to do but comit a sin there
And that was in my hopte, but when I show up in my big body with' the gloss
All of the boppers was boppin' I just could'nt shake'm off
Sixteen switches, tewnty-two inches, trunk goin' to war
They don't want to lay here with me, they want to lay in my car
I was lovin' it back then and still love it today
Except I'm not yellow cutlase no more, I'm 300 blue over gray, on chrome

I'll keep rollin' chrome
I'll keep rollin' chrome
Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on
I'll keep rolin chrome

Finally I'm in the mix, ridin' twenty four's or twenty six
My neck and my wrist lite, with' out me sellin' a brick
Tv's in the roof and the dashboard and I'm watchin' a flick
Rollin' with my pistol in my lap and I'm cockin' if
I spy somethin' suspicious in my rear view mirror when I'm creepin'
If you plan on jackin' me I plan on leavin' you sleepin'
I be in different vehicle cause I'm havin' thangs
King of the ghetto entertainment got me havin' change
You can smell it on me, even tho quite, the way I live it be tellin' on me
Don't get twisted I'm still a felon homie
Thinkin' you goin' to rob me that's a N O
And when I'm in N O I roll with god and as always Mr.Marsello
And they be with me when they in Texas don't par take it as a spy
Harlum nights in stores where they drop it like it's hot
So if your tryin' to call me and I don't answer my phone
I can't hear it cause my music to loud I'm bangin' on chrome

I do this for the streets keep me good
I do it for the hustler cause I do it for the thugs
I do it for the G's cause the G's show me love
I came in the game 17 real loud only thing
On ma mind make my mama proud
Started rockin' crowds gettin' dough for show's
And as the fame rolls den came the hoes
Den came the cloths den came the cars
Next thing I know I'ma ghetto superstar
He come the haters travelin' by the packs
But never mind them cause uh bitch I'm back

I pour up a cup fill the swisha with good and fire it up 
So I can gather ma thoughts

For sometimes and the streets thought a nigga fell off

I'ma still be well off

A born boss got nothin' to loose
Still shinin' in the game got nothin' to prove
Got rich and independent didn't need no deal
Had paper before I signed didn't need no meal
Got hustles on the side ain't got to rep
And if all else fails I still got the trap
I don't fuck wit you rappers
Y'all fake to me
I don't fuck wit y'all majors y'all snakes to me
I don't care about fame fuck bein' a star
Let them take all the pictures just gimme his car
Den gimme his house and his watch and chain
On the bank account, credit cards jock ma name (Thugga)
But I guess one come wit the other

I'ma gone keep it one-hundred fo the public (that's right)
I dropped all ready platinum but they only sell gold
And niggas lookin' at me like I sold ma soul
Cause I'm rappin' wit P and not mister Lee
But when ya on ya grind sometimes ya can't see
Before Mike Camo Paul the sign
I was at anascope can't find ma mind
Still dippin' wooden poppin' 3 kings just droppin'
And I'm an underground artist tryna get on top
So I listen to ma label, plan to break X and learned a whole lot a game from that.
Just stay true ma nigga and do you
And fuck what another try to tell you to do
They'll tell you to spit backs they can bump in them lexis
And oh yeah this a train track. bitch im back

Verse
Baby,I know you think I play games
With your heart when I hold back.
It doesn't mean that I don't want you
It's just I'm alittle selfish,and I don't like to share

I know you be thinking sometimes I be
Brushing you off that I got another man
But boy that's not the case
I'm so damn attracted to you,but I want to
Do it right,so I fight the feelings cus I'm worth
The wait.Your bodies playing like crazy
Your swagger got me like damn,
So gangsta but grown and sexy
Everything I want in a man.

You make a chick want to take it off
And give it to you right now,but I gotta know
Wuts up,before we cut,and that's wus up 
Because I wanna be

(Chorus) 
The only one, the only one
'not yo main chick,not yo main chick'
The only one,the only one
So sexy,but can you handle it,
So much love that I got in store,
Places you ain't been before,I'll give you mine
If you give me yours,open all leave
Behind closed doors,I gotta be 
The only one,the only one

Verse 2
Now here we are,all alone in this empty room
And it's getting real crazy,against the wall
Got me bent up,I'm bout to fuck up,
So stop wait a minute baby
I already know you got a lot of woman in your life
(cus you so fly)
And I don't want to get hurt

You make a chick wanna take it off
And give it to you right now,
I wanna get to know you better
But I let it go because I wanna be

(Chorus)
The only one,the only one
'not yo main chick,not yo main chick'
The only one,the only one
Sexy chick,but can you handle it
So much love that I got in store,
Places you ain't been before,I'll give you mine
If you give me yours,open all leave 
Behind closed doors,cus I gotta be
""the only one,the only one""

(Bridge x2)
I'll be waitin for ya, I'll be waitin
Hope ya waitin for me,hope ya waitin


I really don't need to tell you 
You already know you fine
It ain't one girl in this world
Who would'nt stand in line
So I'm gon' test my patience
Let you enjoy yo fame and
When you done wit dem hoes
And wanna roll wit a real chick
She right here waitin...

No doubt I puts in down,but boy
You just not ready yet.What chick you 
Know drive a stick, sick in the kitchen
And look like this.So if your serious,
Serious about loveing me
This ain't no hit and run I gotta be The only one.

{Verse 1}:
I know what your father did to your mother
And I am sorryyyy
But I ain?t gone let history 
Repeat itself, no
Put your hands down right now 
And back up mothafucka
I suggest you stop and think before you swing
I'll help you get some help
'cause you ain?t ?bout to use me as no punchin? bag
You stressed out then count to 10
You wanna act a fool
And throw a tantrum
And call up your knuckle head friends

I told you twice before
I?m not the chick you wanna fuck wit
'cause its problems, big problems
And you won?t live to see me solve them, naaaw... 

{Chorus}:
If you ever raise your hand at me again
A bitch is goin? straight to the pin 
'cause I?m not taking that bullshit from no damn body (no, no...)
If you ever lay a hand on me again
Imma have to tell my family and my friends good-bye, for life
'cause I might blackout (blackout)

Please don?t (aww baby), please don?t, please don?t, please don?t?
Don?t make me blackout
You should know better 
Than to take me there
'cause I will
Blackout on your fancy mansion
Blackout on your mercedez benz
Blackout on your ass in public
Blackout along wit my scissors

I told you twice before
I?m not the chick you wanna fuck wit
'cause its problems, big problems
And you won?t live to see me solve them, naaaw... 

You lay a hand on me
I ain?t callin? 911
Taking matters into my own hand and then yo ass is done, ohhhh

Lemme see your hands in the air
And I swear 
I won't care, blackout
Keep pushin? my buttons
And ohh, you don?t wanna see me
Blackout on your fancy mansion (like left-eye)
Blackout on your mercedez benz (like Jazmine did) 
Blackout on your ass in public (I won?t be so being nicer)
Blackout (I don?t really give a fuck)

Please don?t make me, please don?t make me, please don?t make me blackout 
'cause I don?t wanna, I don?t wanna, I don?t wanna blackout
I keep a baseball bat in the back of the rover
So please don?t make me blackout
Hide your knives in the kitchen

[Intro]
Today, we have a serious decision that needs to be made for our family
There's a young cat out here that's growing old
Quick and fast in our organization
And today he must step up and be made
And I think you all know
  Who's this guy mayn?
This guy is Silkk, Silkk the Shocker
His contribution to the streets has grown so fast he's grown weak. Kay?
  You know what, this decison must be made now and only now
Isn't he young?
  He's a stand up guy, he's a born leader, he has my blood
I was also a young when I started
  So be it
Godfather, please, let me be the one to tell him he's a Made Man
  Not now, let the Don tell him
Dannny Divuchi, bring Silkk to me
  Godfather, you won't regret it
Yo Don, what up with this visit to
  Okay mayn, have a seat, ju know
  I'm here to tell you some good news mayn
  You're a Made Man now, everybody stand up

[Silkk the Shocker]
Last Year, I was the help, this year I'm the boss
You don't like it?  Fuck y'all, they'll find y'all niggaz lost
Fuck with real niggaz, mob figures
Not you niggaz that's soft
I'm talking about visiting some of you niggaz
Some of you, niggaz is talk
I always been a made man starting when I was, just a teen
Through the streets where I knew how to hustle
So the Don, put me down on his team
Told me to be, down to take a chance
Ya gotta be down to dirty dance
If so, the world can be yours so I put my, life in his hands
I know I'm up in the game, but I learned quickly
Told me you could live good
But wouldn't give it up when they come to get you
Told me never make, moves with your heart
Never snitch if you get caught
Never trust anybody a 100 percent, realize anybody can be bought
Everybody got a price
Money's nothing without
Power respect, loyalty, is a way of life
You've been chosen, to be the Made Man
Everybody gotta turn
there's rules to this shit
That everybody gotta learn
To go from poverty to riches
Before I rule, choose my girl
Today it's the streets, tomorrow. I rule the world

[Chorus]
I want the world the and everything up in it
No settling this time, this time, the sky's the limit
Power, loyalty, respect, from the cradle to the grave
I want to rule and I did, the day I was made
I'm a Made Man

I want the world and everything up in it
No settling this time, this time, the sky's the limit
Born leader, from the cradle, to the grave
I want to rule and I got my chance the day I was made
I'm a Made Man

[Silkk the Shocker]
I want the finer things, the car, house, and diamond rings
Wait patiently cause I know that time will bring it. (time will bring)
I'm a Made Man touch it no mo, I don't touch no coke
I'm a made man, fuck it
I don't even show up for court
Judge tried to give me ten
Pointed the middle finger cause I, thought he was trippin
I can tell him why every nigga I had beef with
them niggaz, wind up missin'
Used to be broke, but now I'm nothing but dollar signs
Used to be convicted felonies but now if I get convicted
It's white collar crimes
Shit never been nervous, if I was, never let it show
Cause of my baby face
I did a lot of crime but, they let me go
Usually females come to get me
Never ever, leave no witnesses
If I gotta do it, it gotta get done, nothin' personal just business
A Made Man with a vision
Learned to, master the system
My family never see's me
I just send em, presents on Christmas
I want the world, take trips to Reno, stock in a Casino
Make a lot of loot, have suits designed by, Valentino
I want the world, and everything up in it, when I said it I meant it
Time to ride high, this time is, sky's the limit
Sometimes it feels like my last line, my last rhyme
Gave the world to little brothers
Never been nothing but the last Don
I want the world

Mya,"(Silkk)
??  how I miss my homies so
I don't expect y'all to understand this
Cause y'all ain't never lost nobody
But imagine the closest person to you
See everybody feel it
But some of us
Feel it more than the rest
Just think about it
It only add 
More to the stress
I try to live my life day by day
And ignore the rest
It's so FUCKED UP
I can feel life
More than I feel death
Split second
And picture
The family's being torn
I gotta tell my little nephew
His dad wasn't around
To see him being born
When we get older
Playing with our kids
He just sittin' all alone
You know what his last birthday wish was
He wishes daddy come home
And while I'm at the funeral 
Contemplating sittin' in strap
He looked up to me
Gave me a hug and asked me
""Silkk, where my daddy at?""
Question I couldn't answer
Tell him a vacation
And somehow I wish
If I tell him this enough
Maybe one day 
He just might forget

(Chorus)
I guess I'll be seeing you
At the end of the road (end of the road, I'll see y'all there)
You know it ain't easy
Lettin' my homie go (end of the road, I'll see y'all there
	(repeat)

(Silkk)
Now I learn ??
I miss my homies so 
Even though
My homies gone 
Try to be strong on my dawgs
Used to hit me
But I'm home alone
All the memories I got of you
Shining like the sun
I used to invite you to my house
We used to fight
Who gone sleep in the top bunk
We used to
Throw rocks
To the cops then we'd run
We was so tight
We got caught
Both of us
They got just one
I remember dawg
We just like
Kick back and laughed
We grew up a little bit
Life made us choose a 
Different path
You chose to get a job
And I sold and dealed
You choose to go to school
And i chose the streets
I was the one that
Always lived fast
You used to want to live slowly
As I look in the casket
I though for sure
It was supposed to be me
Damn I lost my dawg
It's cold but its fair
And I contemplate to myself
Would it have been different
If I would've been there
I guess we'll never never
Never know
But I know one thing
Why's it always the good ones that got to go

(chorus2x)

(Silkk)
It's never easy 
To let your loved ones go
Tomorrow now promise me
Tell me something that your loved ones know
A straight bullet in the neighborhood
Got a little girl
Holdin' her breath
In my arms I closed her eyes
She died while I was 
Holdin' her chest
I couldn't change
Even though the game was file
Through all the pain
Maintain
Still find ways to smile
And grandma(grandmama got sick)
And they fixed her to bed rest
The family was fightin' over who? left the money to
Picture this you won't even dead yet
And I'm sick of this east and west coast crap
This east and west coast trap
Lost two of the biggest mc's
To east and west coast rap
Rest in peace Biggie
Rest in peace Pac
And all them other soldiers
Make us see it??",End Of The Road,2013

Uh!
It's da black rain to da moon and tears that cause lies
See that's the way I felt when my lil' brother died.
And some fools say it ain't no justice 
And other niggaz say it ain't no peace
That's why thugs help their on these projects and on these streets.
See my daddy made me a dealer
And my cousin made me killer.
See that's why everything we do, they gonna respect us and feel us
And I'm still tryin' to understand why big daddy was with da rest
And my nephew on the last counter on da 14th down the car reck.
It ain't muthafucker down on dope, on crack, or aids
And I see so many ghetto people go to jail 
And live your life and die like slaves.
I got a relative on apeel doin' 25 flat
On murder or ride nigga fuck it Johnny Cochran can't fight that.
And since I'm black and I'm rich 
They see to overlook It's me advise
First class niggaz tryin' call da police tryin' to book us.
Ain't that a bitch, I done made millions 
And still goin' through a thang
That's niggaz ask me P why the fuck you never change.

So with life on line put all up 4 him so I put that shit on TRU.
The ghetto got me caught up, no broken dreams
The ghettos trap, I see some on crack, and dope fiends.
My hommie, Never did no crime but lien' up in the hearse
Thank god 4 all that I got from that times can be worst.
Ever feel like you was swimming, and really was dronin'
You ain't want to smile but your tender smile always see me clownin'
I trade my life to make the world better 
Trade everything I got including life 
To bring back my brother Kevin.
See I spit the realist shit 
Tryin' make y'all feel this shit.
Y'all tryin' put the finger on our side, 
Livin' middle bricks livin' this shit.
See I tell you everybody use to ride benzes 
But we had to ride buggies
Mom wanted better things for me 
But private school was way past our budget.
So if I'm  happy and I'm smilin' and I'm camouflage my problems
The only way I can really solve them 
If I really grab and revolve them.
So I grab it and I cocked it
I was going to pop it.
But I stop, forgot I was rich.
What everybody not rich.
Every month so close to gettin' no profits
My only hustle, I told them to stop it, 
But can't really knock it.
Everybody died up in game 
Everybody tryin' to maintain 
Wall from out da ghetto, 
Close my eyes and still see the pain.
Sometimes I just get fed up.
To all my souljas worldwide 
I know its hard to stride.

I do everything for her it seems like she never satisfied
If i give her 3 karats then she probably want four
If I want to go places then she probably just don't want to go
Now sometimes I feel like we settled
in the back of our minds
we all feel like we can find something better
Now with you it' like you know me
Like her she really don't understand me
I know I live the way I live
But she's all for changing me
I don't care for girl with no money
When I come home I ain't tryin to cuss
Am I asking for much?
But I can't sit here and pretend
I don't care
To have both y'all along
That wouldn't be fair
So if it's a puzzle
I think I maybe just missing a clue

And my husband, Charlie, traveled round with us.

We did these 20 acrobatic tricks in a row

Back flips, flip flops,
One right after the other.

Because of artistic differences.
He saw himself as alive

On pyramids, ice men gave dominicans ice keys

Could you not go crazy this time?

But it was destined to fail

But you pushed us right away
Isolated yourself

And I won't let you bring me down

Leave 'em tamed, unleash the rage,
You'll be in control of the fight of your life.

When all you ever wanted was not to be afraid

Looking down into blue

We're all gifted 
But some a bit more than that
My throat got sore from trying to make them notice my pathetic existence

From across the sea
It lingered there to touch your hair 
And walk with me

All summer long
We sang a song
And then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts
And the summer wind 

Like painted kites, those days and nights
They went flying by
The world was new
Beneath the blue
Umbrella sky 

Then softer than
The piper man
One day, it called to you
I lost you to

The autumn wind
And the winter wind
They have come and they have gone
And still the days
Those lonely days
Go on and on

And guess who sighs a lullaby
To nights that never end?

MyChildren MyBride,"If seeing is believing then they've gouged out all their own eyes.
They're confused by the love, the hate, all of the hypocritical lies.
Their own misfortunes, creating the selfish disguise;
That will seed the beginning of their spiritual demise (2)

I can?t believe this is happening,
My faith depleting somewhere buried inside, alive;
Afraid, unstable, but learning that these things will clear in time
I?m so scared, I?m so scared of what I might become

straying from the beaten path that I?ve been on for so long
Finally moving forward in life, acknowledging my faults
That?s haunted my every move for what seems like years
My conscience screaming, realizing things aren?t as bad as they appear

still anchored in our old ways

and just when you think everything's going to be alright
Defenses down, so vulnerable to what once had you gripped so tight

the miracle I needed, no longer mistreated
The life changing motivation, my only inspiration
Calm the storms and ill walk the waves
My eyes are open, and I can clearly see

CALM THE STORMS AND I?LL WALK THE WAVES

I can?t believe all this is happening to me,
My faith depleting some where buried alive, inside;
Afraid, unstable, but learning that these things will clear in time

And just when you think everything ?s going to be alright
I?m vulnerable to what once had me gripped so tight

Mygrain,"Define my conscience, what is real
Characterize the ways world disappears
I try but I can't decide from reality and fantasy

Glittering darkness room by room
Nothing satisfies as I enter bloom
Fear my world so puzzled and mystified
Stage of pleasure and pain is what I hide behind my eyes

My inability to feel real
Hyper reality feeds me
Falling into my secret window
As I walk the earth unhallowed

Anything, everything
Tricking, conscience what I've seen
Detached from engagement of emotions
Meaningless identical devotions
Rapidly taking any given shape
Filtered experience depicted in hate

Your demons, my angels
Capsized parallel dream world
Parting ways to breathe to be alive
Crusade of perfect stranger
Disconnect the splendor
Alienations steers till the end

Split apart from a faculty of mind
Non-existent world in a glimpse of an eye
Simulation of something to never exist
This authentic fake, mind misled

Light years away from here
Hyperspace to escape my fear
Simulation of familiar place
Reproduction of empty appearance

My inability to feel real
Hyper reality feeds me
Falling into my secret window
As I walk the earth unhallowed

Mygrain,"Fear casting this sight with its monumental shadow
Descent to the earth wearing unidentified doom

Freezing sun beyond the curtains of black
No escape from falling past the event horizon
Falling empires fading into the landscape
Shape of the formless mass of attracting everything

Lost inside escape velocity
Falling in particles, fight the lost gravity
Celestial bodies, colliding interstellar clouds
Rendering its dense invisible interiors
Morphing to the darker space phenomena
Sucked into a new era

Inflamed world taking stranger turns
Fight the gravity in trembling imbalance
These polluted shades, pixilated rooftops in flames
I distort my appearance

Drifting to the void with no soul
Smoke the freedom with your ashes
Grasping widespread warning, the day of reckoning
Foredoomed to wander, shaken and stranded
Transparent snow globe world
Imbalanced atmosphere shatters

Subdued to explode, the host of new life
Appearing from these reptile eyes
The scattering of light
Capture my breath as I plunder away

I, the blind visitor, the explorer of empty skies
Tormented lives
Worms to a cosmic storms
I diverge from the form

Reformation evolving to cascade
Purging and taking our thoughts and memories away
Encroaching inside, spreading disease threadbare
Strangler of the universe, take and disperse

Warped minds disconnected, lost in reality
Reprogrammed to forget everything

Hypnotizing circles in the smokescreen
Cycle repeats, rebirth of a different scene
Weakened breath forming a dark nebula
New dawning of a darker era

Dark kinetic energies invade our souls
Oblivion's forming eternal black holes

Drifting to the void with no soul
Smoke the freedom with your ashes

Take my hand, let's burn together
Rise to another level

Linking into radiant winds and storm
In this bleak reality I've been reborn
Dig under my skin with your claws

Complex love turns a mess, a paradoxical happiness
Mirthless divine devouring me raw
Unavoidable disaster turning around my jaw

Connecting into breeding engines
Spewing out inhuman purgings
All memories are left in slumber
No one hears you're going under

Stretching out from minority
Playing God by atrocity

Take another step to steal my soul
Drowning control to feed
The flames of translucent dreams

Like a fly reaching to the light
Blinding eyes and drifting out of sight
It's burning you low
When too much is not enough for you

Stars align fractions of eternity
I'm lost in false sense of security
Constellation to holes in the bleeding sky

Spirit emulating creature
Peeling in as something dies
Interweaved to its web, grasping our lives

Bury me down and dig up the hole

Mind tricks behind my eyes
Plugged in to follow my demons in disguise

Stars aligning fragments of the memories
Parallel truth, awaken in translucence
Sealed by this deadened song
Sinking in toneless comatose

Come and tear my skin, fear what's within

Dig in to yourself and bury the bones
Delve inside to drown in oblivion's holes
Come and tear my skin, fear what's within
Explore my every sin and she'd my skin

Bury me down and dig up the hole

Check it out
Born this way, the universe wasn't formed in a day
Praise the Lord and pray, we the children of God
Better learn how to walk this way
Try to walk with faith, but it's hard
What more could I say?
Feelin' cursed, so I talk this way
Gotta write what I'm livin' in graffiti
It's the hood hieroglyphics
So I'm lookin' for a wall to spray
You could picture me rollin'
You could picture me holdin'
You could never picture me foldin'
Refuse to beholden to your racist image of a Black man
Kiss my entire colon
Great mind, even though the legacy is stolen
It's all for the silver and gold
You can tell you in the ghetto from the litter in the road
Man this middle-of-the-road shit really getting old
Which one is the Real You?
I don't know it's still you
How can I tell if you under a spell
Did the Fake You kill you?
Do they pass the mic in the afterlife?
If so let me spit flows
Good enough to offer to God as a sacrifice
Born again like I passed away
Castigated for being honest
Caught bail like a Castaway
Because I feel like I'm swimmin' on an island
When I'm gettin' introspective, that's radio silence
When I'm fuckin' up program directives, that's radio violence

You're the one who wants to slow me down
I'm a criminal when you're around
What makes me think you would love me?
What makes you want to unplug me?

Born this way, woke up like this
The midpoint between science and religion
Is tryna find out what the meaning of life is
October 3rd, '75, my birth is a blessing
Ain't no spoken word could ever describe how the flow get better
I live on the edge, I'll send you a postcard
Fuck a phone, I got a chip on my neck that's a close call
Turn the lights off, see how we glow in the dark
Are we growin' apart or tryna survive the flood like we in Noah's Ark
We battin' down the hatchets and we set sail
Tryna get far away from inhalin' them chemtrails
My intel says they makin' people out of the stem cells
The gun's our sunflower seed, we love to spit shells
When them super soakers get let off it don't end well
I ain't know you like to get wet, dog, like Denzel
They hype it up like marketers, sparklin' like a fish scale
Till' you chasin' a high like Captain Ahab after that big whale

Dr. King, his dream torn from a warm womb
Formed from the clay
Existing shifting from the essence uplifting
In the presence just drifting, gifting
Through this mortal coil, with mystic lessons from the sage
California spoiled the blessing, blissed up
My first breath in outer space
I kissed death in it's face
No identity complex, it gets left in it's place
Proud to say, no aborted torment to my rejection
Miffed, dismayed and somewhat befuddled
I struggled to hustle and come up when the blood
Corpuscle boils, I'm pressin' issues
It's business that's mixed with pleasure
It's business to play and get paid
During this clone of her DNA
You should know more about the donors confessing my doula from prenatal
I'm off fire water, elixir of liquor with soft 
Or hardcore drugs in my system
Sicker desire to be delivered wisdom
Poor black, white sexy texture of lovers like jungle fever
Wild zebras to make this fetus, brother, the son of my father
I want to hear my one Shawki, and my daughter
Aja lecture selections in musical meters
In physics you should explore or visit more exquisite shores in districts
Take a breather, believe in your epic
God, remember you are a descendant of natural leaders
Extended from both levels in Bethlehem and even need 'em
In new testaments, heaven's an image in books
Messages, read 'em
Scriptures, look at the various sizes of giants in Egyptian pictures
Stonehenge in Europe, the mathematics of Mayans and metholithic structures

Her shoes matchin' her bag
Her nails matchin' her feet
Lil shawty sholl unique
She rubbin' on my back
I'm rubbin' on her thighs
Her tongue off in my ear
I'mma take it up to first gear
How we don't like that freaky shit
But tonight I might just will
Cut the radio off
I'm bumpin' that Johnny Gill
She said Mykko you nasty
I said no I'm just real
She started playin her role
This shit just got too real
I tied up my dreads
Then fell off in her legs
She slowed me down then sat me down
Then started givin' me head
No personally I don't know this bitch
But I'm diggin' all her ways
She 5'2"" and I'm 6'4""
I'm goin in MJ

A bad bitch I'm perusin'
She in park but her ass be movin'
Too turnt up and I can't stop groovin
One look at it and she can't stop lookin'
Girl Scout swag, she ain't sellin' cookies
Dancin' on the pole,she playin' with that pussy
Don't shoot me down baby girl I'm like cupid
So she shoved him off that pole
And told me something I should know
The music loud she was talkin' low I couldn't understand this ho
So I told shawty go change clothes and meet me back right here
Don't say a word just grab ya bag so we can disappear
She said bet and I said cool
Later on we was at the twelve
She don't drink lean but she smoke loud
So we burned down the whole hell
See you the type I might take home and let you spend the night
But I don't know yet
It's our first date
Let me think about it a'ight!
So we in the whip on 75 trynna figure out the move
She said aye and I said what
She gone ask me what we gone do
Come lay ya head on my lap and do somethin' you barely don't do
She said bet then she got loose and blew the top off of that coochie

Fine on the out but she pretty on the inside
And every since she left its like my heart died

Baby I think you can bring out Gucci's other side
She said how you don't you trust me you did a homicide
Then said I got a boyfriend who I can't put aside
Even though the grass so much greener on the other side
And every man like what he can't have
It's funny but I came at
Baby girl so bad, dis me but I ain't mad
Now you wanna tease me
You should wanna squeeze me
Homie ain't the kid, baby he could never be me

How you wanna go and act anti-social
Bet your man don't know you like I know you soldier
Maybe one day babe you gon' get your mind right
And if you looking for me you can find me in the lam

Oh Damn
Once upon a time a long time ago
I had a bitch but she felt she had to let me go
Called me out cause she cant buy cheap shit
Yeah you got talent but I'm a bad bitch
Now when I see her shorty whole swag switched
I walk right by her like she don't exist
Her car broke down and it can't get fixed
Her swag broke down and her bag counterfeit
Oh Damn!
Dats not Gucci, baby that's floochy
Remember 2000 you was acting all boozie
9 years later and you're best friend choosie (muah)
I scooped her in my phantom and I took her to the movies (yeah)
Damn

Gucci don't gotta act anti
Told her she can have me when she want
That's when she fantasized that I can't talk to her cause I got that man pride
Ever since I left baby girl told me her heart died (Gucci!)

Excuse me if I sound a little crazy
But just wanna be good to my baby
Cause he been holding me down
He give me everything I don't need no one around
But you're saying you can give it to me better
Give me hot like it's July and I'm rockin' a sweater
Just for hitting the road
Would you women let go
Say you got 20/20
Her man's 2004
Maybe I'll give you a try
And keep it low
Let you ride
Something like a test drive
See baby I ain't so anti

Mylène Farmer,"Horloge ! dieu sinistre, effrayant, impassible
Don't le doigt nous menace et nous dit ""Souviens-toi !""
Les vibrantes Douleurs dans ton coeur plein d'effroi
Se planteront bient'omme dans une cible :
Le plaisir vaporeux fuira vers l'horizon ""
Ainsi qu'une sylphide au fond de sa coulisse :
Chaque instant te devore un morceau do delice
A chaque homme accord'our toute sa saison.
Trois mille six cent fois par heure, la Seconde
Chuchote : Souviens-toi ! - Rapide, avec sa voix
D'insecte, Maintenant dit : Je suis Autrefois,
Et j'ai pomp'a vie avec ma trompe immonde !
Rememer ! Souviens-toi, prodigue Esto memor !
(Mon gosier de m'l parle toutes les langues.)
Les minutes, mortel fol'e, sont des gangues
Qu'il ne faut pas l'er sans en extraire l'or

Souviens-toi que le temps est un joueur avide
Qui gagne sans tricher, 'out coup ! C'est la loi.
Le jour d'oit ; la nuit augmente, souviens-toi !
Le gouffre a toujours soif ; la clepsydre se vide.
Tant'onnera l'heure ou le divin Hasard,
O'uguste Vertu, ton 'use encor vierge,
O'repentir m' (oh ! la derni' auberge !),
O't te dira : Meurs, vieux l'e ! il est trop tard",L'Horloge,1988

And you will make yourself learn to do

You will shout “Help me soon”

Vous connaissez mon jeu par coeur
Alors défendez-vous

Sans tricher, je vous le promets
J'ai gagné, tant pis c'est bien fait
Vous êtes mon jouet
A présent, ce ne sera plus vous mais toi
Et tu feras ca t'apprendra
N'importe quoi pour moi

Sans m'en faire, je vais t'assurer
Un enfer de griffes et de crocs

Nous nous faisons payer grassement nos aveux
Et nous rentrons gaiement dans le chemin bourbeux
Croyant par de vils pleurs laver toutes nos taches

Sans horreur, à travers des ténèbres qui puent

Ainsi qu'un débauché pauvre qui baise et mange

Nous volons au passage un plaisir clandestin
Que nous pressons bien fort comme une vieille orange

Serré, fourmillant, comme un million d'helminthes
Dans nos cerveaux ribote un peuple de Démons
Et, quand nous respirons, la Mort dans nos poumons
Descend, fleuve invisible, avec de sourdes plaintes

N'ont pas encore brodé de leurs plaisants dessins

Quoiqu'il ne pousse ni grands gestes ni grands cris
Il ferait volontiers de la terre un débris
Et dans un bâillement avalerait le monde

Well what a price to pay
Fear can be overstated,
and you seem infatuated
with finding who's to blame.

While it can seem so hard now,
I got a feeling we ain't meant to live this way.

Don't tell me it's too late,
cause I feel it too, we all love to hate
and let others lead the way.

Some searching to find
That love (life?) with a new piece of mind.

And still we push further away,
Singing our songs of yesterday.
While so much still stands in our way,
Voices with nothing to say.

Some feel that life's a favor,
While some don't have the time.
Wash up and kiss the alter,
All hail the mighty father,
but love will keep you blind.

Same questions we keep asking,
Won't hear the answers cause we're scared of what we'll find

We try and compensate through our troubled faith that should keep us safe
and keep searching for a sign.

Some searching to find
That love (life?) with a new piece of mind.

And still still we march further away,
Singing our songs of yesterday.
While so much still stands in our way,
Voices with nothing to say.

There wont be another day, the (no?) changing of the seasons,
And no one's gonna save us from the lies.

The greatest story ever told,
Is only what you make it.
There will be struggle and fear,
All by design

Far beyond yesterday

Oh Starlight, don't you cry we're gonna find a place where we belong (where we belong)
And so you know, we'll never shine alone

There are shadows sleeping on the horizon
Leave us scared and so afraid
As the fall out of a world divided
It brings her tears and so much pain
And so we take cover from the dark
Hoping to find where we can start

Oh Starlight, don't you cry we gonna make it right before tomorrow
Oh Starlight, don't you cry we're gonna find a place where we belong (where we belong)
And so you know, you'll never shine alone
Starlight we'll find a place where we belong

You will see as the mountains fall and turn to dust
There's one thing that can't change
I believe there's something within each over us that always says
That will always remain as long as love never pains

Oh Starlight, don't you cry we gonna make it right before tomorrow
Oh Starlight, don't you cry we're gonna find a place where we belong (where we belong)

Who can show me there's a song left to be sung

If only time
Could somehow turn the page
If only I
Hadn't walked away

The lonely embrace of days gone by
So better the taste where love survives
But the one you loved is gone

Now I know, now I know
We can't replace what we let go
And still I hope, still I hope
That time will ease the pain
Of losing something that was pure and beautiful

And I wonder even now, whatever came of you
And I wonder even now, where you are

The lonely embrace of days gone by
So better the taste where love survives
But the one you loved is gone

On the road to love

I met a rich man on the road
He told me where to go
To get my hands upon some gold
But I still answered no
'Cause freedom waits for me ahead
Your gold will slow me down
I smiled as I walked on my way
And left him with a frown

I met an old man on the road
His eyes were clear and wise
Can you direct me on my way
To where the answer lies
I'm looking for the road to freedom
So I can be free
He said keep thinking as you walk
And one day you will see

I'm on the road to freedom
On the road to truth
Yonder can you see them
Wasting precious youth

I thought as I walked down the road

It seems to me that what he meant
Is freedom's in your head

On a cloud of sight, I drift in the night

Goes far, flies near, to the stars away from here

Why don't you tell your dreams to me?

Close your eyes girl, look inside girl, let the sound take you away

Before the thing could answer me well someone took, took the lamp away

I looked around a lousy can was all I found

And two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the Snowman
Is a fairytale they say
He was made of snow
But the children know
How he came to life one day
There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around
Frosty the Snowman
Was alive as he could be 
And the children say 
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said let's run
And we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away
Down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler stop

Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye

Myriam,"Some say love, it is a river
That drowns the tender reed
Some say love, it is a razor
That leaves your soul to bleed

Some say love, it is a hunger
An endless aching need
I say love it is a flower
And you it's only seed

It's the heart afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
It's the dream afraid of waking
That never takes a chance

It's the one who won't be taken
Who cannot seem to give
And the soul afraid of dying
That never learns to live

When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong

Just remember in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snow
Lies the seed that with the sun's love
In the spring, becomes the rose

Becomes the rose

Mis maletas y sacar mis sentimientos y
Resentimientos todos

Hacer limpieza al armario
Borrar rencores de antaño
Y angustias que hubo en mi mente

Para no sufrir por cosas tan pequeñitas
Dejar de ser niña para ser mujer
Hoy voy a cambiar
Sacar a la luz mi coraje y entregarme a lo que creo
Y ser siempre yo sin miedos

Bailar y cantar por hábito y ver claro en vez
De oscuro, desarraigar mis secretos, dejar de vivir
Si no es por vivir la vida

Que grita dentro de mí
Mi libertad

Hoy voy a cambiar, salir de dentro de mí
Y no ser sólo corazón
Dejar y parar fracasos, soltar los brazos
Mi libertad que oprime mi razón

Volar libre con todos mis defectos
Para poder rescatar mis derechos
Y no cobrarle a la vida caminos ni decisiones

Hoy quiero y debo cambiar

Dividirle al tiempo y sumarle al viento
Todas las cosas que un día
Soñé conquistar, porque soy mujer
Como cualquiera con dudas y soluciones
Con defectos y virtudes, con amor y desamor

Suave como gaviota pero felina como una leona
Tranquila y pacificadora pero al mismo tiempo
Irreverente y revolucionaria

Feliz e infeliz, realista y soñadora
Sumisa por condición
Más independiente por opinión

Porque soy mujer con todas las
Incoherencias que nacen de mí
Fuerte el sexo débil

Hoy voy a cambiar, revisar bien
Mis maletas y sacar mis sentimientos
Y resentimientos todos

Y no abrazar lo que era nuestro
Fue el error que viviré para siempre

Como sería, que hubiera sido de mí si ese día
No te hubiera dejado partir
Como sería besar tus labios cada amanecer
Poder perderme cada noche tu querer

Como sería por culpa del miedo del abandono
Sinceramente no sabía como
Apostar un beso contra la eternidad
Quizás soy la culpable de este destino

Sé que hoy no haría lo mismo

Cuesta arriba cargando mis heridas

Tratando siempre de llegar a la meta que me he puesto

No me digas
Que quieres volver a empezar

Porque prefiero estar muy lejos
Lejos de ti

No te quiero conmigo

",Nada Para Ti,2004
Myriam,"Ya se que tu me estas haciendo trampa
Y que ya no estas sola
Cuéntame todo o perderé la calma
Mira que no aguanto más

Quiero saber porque tú me has robado
Al hombre que yo amo
Si sabes que engañar es un pecado
Y sagrado el juego del amor

Traicionera, embustera
Que injusticia que me hieras
Pagaras lo que me debas

Mala amiga eres traicionera
Ahora de mis bazos te lo llevas
Con lo que yo tiro tú te quedas
No me la vayas a regresar

Yo que confiaba en ti tan ciegamente
Jamás imaginaba
Que cederías así tan fácilmente
A su débil corazón

Y si al final te quedas en sus brazos
Tendrás tu merecido
Aquí no abra jamás perdón ni olvido
Del castigo no te salvaras

Mala amiga, mala amiga
Mala amiga, mala amiga

",Traicionera,2005
Myriam,"Amarle ahora
Es imposible ya lo sé
El tiene ya otro amor
y yo no tengo nada
Me siento triste
Al ver llegar la noche, amor
Ahora sé que fui yo
Quién más perdía
Inevitablemente, soy el pequeño río
Que se perdió en su mar

Ay, corazón
Me hiciste tanto daño
Tú me enseñaste a amarlo
y ahora yo no sé olvidar
Ay amor, ay amor
Por qué me dueles tanto
Ay amor, ay amor
Recuérdame

Quererle ahora
No tiene causa ni razón
No tiene voluntad
Es sólo una locura
Quedarme sola
Es mi destino, ya lo ves
Aprenderé a vivir, así, sin él
y silenciosamente
Levantaré mi vuelo
Para volver jamás
Ay, corazón",Ay Amor,2007
Myriam,"Tú quisiste estar allá
Dijiste que quizás ese era tu destino
Después que todo te fallo
Hoy quieres regresar y ser feliz conmigo

Pero tú no piensas que mi amor
Por siempre te olvido y exiges mi cariño
Deberás lo siento, no podre volver a enamorar
De ti ya no es lo mismo

Sólo espero que entiendas que un amor
Se debe de cuidar y no jugar con nadie
Porque yo te daba mi querer
Y aun sin merecer no te dolió dejarme

Ahora vuelves buscando mi calor
Diciendo que jamás lograste olvidarme
Pero yo te aclaro de una vez
Lo debes entender es demasiado tarde

Yo no te guardo rencor pero tampoco amor
De ti ya nada queda
No niego fue mucho mi dolor pero eso ya paso
Mejor ya no nunca vuelvas

Sólo espero que entiendas que un amor
Se debe de cuidar y no jugar con nadie
Porque yo te daba mi querer
Y aun sin merecer no te dolió dejarme

Que jamás lograste olvidarme

Myriam,"Si abrazas a tu almohada, si pierdes la noción
Si sientes su mirada apuntando al corazón
Si nada es normal y vas como al revés
Y todo gira gira, gira empieza la partida

Si guardas en tus sueños un sitio para el
Si esperas en la noche como empieza a amanecer
Si tu imaginación, ya no te deja respirar
Y prende fuego fuego, fuego, entonces no hay remedio

Ay, ay, ay, ay, es el amor quien llega
Ay, ay, ay, ay, despierta que se va
El es el único mágico frívolo
Si se enamora apuesta todo acabador

Ay, ay, ay, ay, permite que te atrape
Ay, ay, ay, ay, puede ser un ladrón
El es el único pícaro cínico
Si se presenta una batalla sale siempre vencedor

Si miras las estrellas buscando un no sé que
Si sientes que tus ojos se humedecen sin querer
Si notas que el calor te viene a golpes de tensión
Y pega fuerte fuerte, fuerte, entonces mucha suerte

Ay, ay, ay, ay, es el amor quien llega
Ay, ay, ay, ay, despierta que se va

Es porque te amo
Cuando digo que no quiero más de ti
Es porque te quiero

Si te perdiera un día

Veo mi paz que se desprende por doquier
Que después te entrego
Necesito hablar las cosas que yo sé
Y después me niego

Y la verdad es que estoy loca ya por ti
Que tengo miedo de perderte alguna vez
Necesito aceptar que Dios jamás
Va a separarte de mi vida

Es una locura de decir que no te quiero
Evitar las apariencias, ocultando evidencias
Mas porque seguir fingiendo si no puedo engañar mi corazón
Yo sé que te amo

Ya no mas mentiras si me muero de deseos
Yo te quiero más que a todo necesito de tus besos
Le haces falta a mis días
Mas sin ti no que hacer, que hacer sin ti
Yo quiero que conozcas más de mí

Son mis temores los que me alejan

Traías bien guardado

Tan cerca de mí

Unir las almas y volar

Juntos hasta la eternidad

Es imposible ya lo sé
El tiene ya otro amor
y yo no tengo nada
Me siento triste
Al ver llegar la noche, amor
Ahora sé que fui yo
Quién más perdía
Inevitablemente, soy el pequeño río
Que se perdió en su mar

Ay, corazón
Me hiciste tanto daño
Tú me enseñaste a amarlo
y ahora yo no sé olvidar
Ay amor, ay amor
Por qué me dueles tanto
Ay amor, ay amor
Recuérdame

Quererle ahora
No tiene causa ni razón
No tiene voluntad
Es sólo una locura

Es mi destino, ya lo ves
Aprenderé a vivir, así, sin él

Levantaré mi vuelo

No puedo ocultarme entre la gente
Deseo arriesgarme que se enteren de nuestro amor

Hace tiempo que no te veía
Hace tiempo que nada de ti sabía
Ahora sabes que tú eres mi elegida
La que ahora esta noche infinita

Escribí mis vidas
Años atrás te tenía en la mente
Cuando ibas a la escuela bajando la avenida
Amigo de tus amigos
Amigo de tus amigas
Así es como el reto
Ahora tú te encandilas

Recuerdo un verano fuimos juntos a Villa
La brisa fría hace ahora que tú te avecinas
Hago por ti como todo por las ruinas
Cuando la noche como tú
Ahora me cae encima
Se borra todo de mis ojos
Y mi pupila
Eras la única joya que realmente brilla

La forma en que actúas
La forma en que me miras
La forma en que me tratas
Y como me cuidas

Soy yo
Y el amor
De mi vida

Y tú
Para mí
A no ser
Que tenga que decidirme entre los dos

La confusión que tengo atormentando
Dos relaciones juntas me están matando
Y será resistirme y alejarme
Decir adiós

Tu suave melodía llena mi alma
? me trae calma
Reviviendo tu esencia
Fuerte es lo que siento
Tu vida y mi sangre ya está fluyendo
Ya la siento que está muy lejos
Hago distante y distinto
Y en tus besos
Tu mi chica romántica
Jugando ese juego
Como sabes tú
Que yo siempre seré el primero

Soy yo
El amor de tu vida
Por siempre
Y tú para mi

Me obligan a inventar su amor
A solas en mi habitación

Presiento sus manos
Me engañan las caricias que
Dejaron marcas en mi piel

Quisiera marcharme, ser libre sin él
Mi cuerpo no quiere ceder
Se niega a pasar la noche sin él

Si él es el hombre equivocado
Por qué me aferro así?
Esa inseguridad de quedarme sola
O ese miedo a no sentir tan cerca su piel

Si él es, el hombre equivocado
Por qué me entrego así?

Y el diga te amo después",El  Hombre Equivocado,2010

It's cooler than the street
I been watching the setting sun
As it bounces off the avenue
Turning into gold dust at my feet
Carlos and Yolanda
Dancing in the hallway
To an old melody
Spanish eyes and soft brown curls
My love, my love
Come to me

I believe I'm in the power of st. Lazarus
And he holds me in his sight
I know that these jitterbug days I'm living
Well they won't last for all of us
But they'll last for a long summer night
I can feel the fire in her eyes
Tonight, tonight
Under satin summer skies

The mighty mau maus, those shines from Brooklyn
They want to cut the vampires down, down
The savage skulls, the Fordham baldies
They'll treat you like you're piss
From the heart of the barrio now my brother
We tell them mother fuckers suck on this.

That's cool, but you don't get no respect around here unless you belong to a bopping gang...

Or you can buy some protection from me.

Never to fade with the dawn,
And though you are gone

Myron Floren,"On the road again
Just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is making music with my friends
And I cant wait to get on the road again

On the road again
Goin' places that I've never been
Seein' things that I may never see again
And I can't wait to get on the road again

On the road again
Like a band of gypsies we go down the highway
We're the best of friends
Insisting that the world keep turning our way
And our way, is on the road again

Just cant wait to get on the road again
The life I love is making music with my friends
And I cant wait to get on the road again",On the Road Again,1984
Myron Floren,"Why me Lord, what have I ever done
To deserve even one
Of the pleasures I've known
Tell me Lord, what did I ever do
That was worth loving you
Or the kindness you've shown.

Lord help me Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've need you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand.

Tell me Lord, if you think there's a way
I can try to repay
All I've taken from you
Maybe Lord, I can show someone else
What I've been through myself
On my way back to you.

Lord help me Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've need you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand.",Why Me Lord?,1992

Wouldn'ta never put my hands around no gat 

But you know Loon  bein' all hard headed 

And don't listen  even if God said it 

I didn't have to stick with folks that sniff no coke 

I didn't have to fix the block when shit was broke 

Same cats I helped was twistin' smoke 

Now imagine if I went to school, went to class 

'Stead of bein' a young cat sent to blast 

Sent to slash criminal's necks in half

Can't dodge bullets? Too bad, man 

Shit, I'd a copped the five instead of the six 

That way wouldn't of crashed and killed my cousin 

Keep quiet instead of having the industry buzzin' 

Do a devil's advocate style, don't let 'em see you comin' 

Use the revolver when bustin' and sluggin'

I killed five people, I'd let survive 

And the five I took away, I'd a left alive 

If I could do all it again I'd bring Virg' back 

Or I switch places with him, I hope you heard that 

I would have preferred that, I ain't have to starve 

Pitch crack, have to rob and catch a charge 

And I'd do it all again if I had to 

Pitch no-win to win, and I'd be glad to

Went down south and I ain't feel the guilt 

And I ain't ready to war but that ain't the way built 

And for all the nights and all the fights 

That I had for all this money over all these dice 

All my cars and homes and all my ice 

If I could do it all again, I'd do it all for Christ 

Whoever thought the limelight or the super-stardom 

Whoever thought there'd be a problem comin' through Harlem 

Can't even chill, cats want to make me a villain 

Cats that I grew up with I gotta contemplate killin' 

Nobody love me, I'm my own mister, and on my own, mister 

Mama did what she could but now I'm grown, mister 

Though she told me once, wish she'd told me then 

Though I'm the youngest, I'mma grow to be the oldest man

Want to blow motherfucker? Team nigga til I'm low motherfucker
Yo, I went from O-T to O-see to all the paper
Leads to fatigue then ? the gators

If ain't about the money nigga? Call me later
How many niggaz talk Benzes? Seen them one
Not videos and picture shit, those don't count
I'm the nigga talkin millions and, own the amount

Mr. Frosty, the nigga never fold for chips
When the money on the line bitch I roll trips
Cut a bitch off for a week and let her know what she miss
Hundred grand worth of shit nigga glow on my wrist

Bought a range just to go with the six
When I flip for these chips, shit is never over a bitch
You got some nerve, I can give a kiler one word, get em
You will see how many niggaz miss him

I put pellets in the air let the shit hit em
Put the gun inside his mouth and let the clip kiss him
Shit you drive all tinted, I put my honey in it
Won't, stop your bank, ain't enough money in it

Live a lifestyle rarely told, what you know about
Floatin down Eighth, gettin head in the Rolls
You had, money like that you wouldn't be measurin those
You motherfuckin barely sold, barely gold

Niggaz send it rough I send it back the same way it came
You ain't dissin me until you say my name, motherfucker

(Intro) 
This is a story 
Though the names have been changed 
The facts remain the same 
On this arista track next there gonna let you know what's going on listen 
You see you always hear about a no good man 
And there's a lot of no good woman out here 
And this story right here is gonna show just what I'm talking about 
Now T Low come on 

(T Low) 
I always said I would never trip on no female 
Found myself dropping down on your hair and your nails 
I was at the mall carrying bags for instances 
I was in love so I said oh well 
Never thought about the money that I spent on you 
So into you there was nothing that I wouldn't do 
Spend mad sheets on shopping spree's 
Pulled out my visa just to please ya 
Oh oh yeah 

(Chorus) 
Ain't nobody ever put you on a list (Nobody) 
Let you know with ice all on your wrist 
How i kiss your lips and put you in the mix 
Ain't nobody, Ain't nobody gonna love you 
Ain't nobody ever gonna sacrifice for you (come on) 
Put it down, the way a player do 
(I can't believe)I can't believe the shit you put me threw 
Ain't nobody, Ain't nobody gonna love 

(RL) 
can't believe when you suffer the way that I did 
Even told me you were caring bout that I'm the kid 
I Worked 3 jobs even broke the law 
Never had second thoughts you know I never went wrong(No) 
9 months later a baby comes that don't even look like me 
The blood that shows its real is the sweetest baby 
I gave you everything and you cause me so much pain 
Never have a love like mine again 
Oh Oh 

(Chorus) 
Ain't nobody ever put you on a list (Put you on, put you on) 
Let you know with ice all on your wrist 
(Ice on all your wrist Oh Oh yeah) 
How i kiss you're lips and put you in the mix 
Ain't nobody, Ain't nobody gonna love you(like I do) 
Ain't nobody ever gonna sacrifice for you(Sacrifice) 
Put it down, the way a player do 
(I can't believe)I can't believe the shit you put me threw 
(just can't believe Oh yes) 
Ain't nobody, Ain't nobody gonna love (Break it down, break it down) 
Just can't believe you did this to me 
One day you'll see one day you'll see 
(Cause Ain't nobody gonna love you) 

(Mysonne) 
No no 
Ain't nobody gonna do what I did for you 
I'm almost caught a bid for you 
I live for you, bust my gun that's some shit for you 
On the run and I hid for you that's how you do 
You probably really think you played me too 
When the only one you played was you 
I made you boo 
Before you came I played them games 
So what I gave you things I gave you Rings 
All the clothes the boots and shit 
When all that was boosted bitch I knew you shit 
I'm not dumb I know your type wife in the day, 
Hoe at night always Right 
He told me you was sneaking hot its all good to me you died 
See you bugged, I Ain't stressed 
I'm off to the next dime you got something good keep it next time

The FUCK y'all niggas want? (I want the truth!) 
Y'all niggas want problems? (I want the truth!)

You niggas want problems? (You can't handle the truth!)

We goin' do this like pirates now, walk the plank 
I don't know what niggas think, there's none above me 
Problem Child General, nigga thugs love me 

You want me to prove it's real, use this steel 
catch a body, and move to Brazil? 
But then how you goin' breathe, when your lungs ain't there? 
Comin' in your buildin', and my sons is there 

with they hands by they waist cause they guns is there 
Now y'all see how this shit turn from fun to fear 
But y'all don't play fair, so why should I? 
Get you hit by the same nigga that got you high 

Put two up in your side, and watch you cry 
And I know you can't survive but I'm a watch you try 
Say goodbye, y'all niggas ain't bulletproof 
You want what? y'all niggas can't handle the truth, yo 

[Chorus: x2]
The truth is... it's too late for a truce 
The truth is... y'all niggas ain't bulletproof 
The truth is... Mysonne is the truth and 
(You can't handle the truth!) 

Ah-yo the truth is, I'm young pretty and ruthless 
And I peel quick and steal shit, cause I'm lootless 
So don't confuse realness, with music 
Yeah you got a gun but you scared to death to use it 

Your hand shakin', you can't take the kickback 
So whoever gun you borrow nigga give it back 
'Cause you lack the heart it takes for gunplay 
You ain't ready to have shootouts in the broad day 

My niggas bustin' while they drivin' down the one-way 
y'all niggas better pack y'all bags and run away 
I mean this fam, I'm makin' niggas disappear 
It ain't a game, and I think I made that crystal clear 

(I think so) Shit is official here, so you don't want to start this 
'Cause you too light, to get caught up, in the darkness 
Stabbed up, left hemorraghing, on a park bench 
You threaten mines? FUCK YOU, pardon my French 

[Chorus] 

Okay, you been forewarned, so y'all niggas better recognize 
Problem Children, don't forget the weapon ties 
I specialize in warfare and rippin' tracks 
And if it's war, then we ALL in with different gats 

or different bats, just keep spittin' this and that 
Just keep talkin', yo' ass goin' end up missin' black 
You not goin' listen til I'm yo' ear with the mac 
or you in the air, your spirit just lookin' back 

I done it all, from pimpin' hoes to cookin' crack 
Approachin' crews dolo, like what y'all lookin' at? 
I earn respect, that's why I wonder why me? 
Thorough to this, so why y'all still want to try me? 

That's alright, y'all niggas know where to find me 
Up in the Bronx somewhere, that's where I be 
Probably with my niggas shootin' lead off the roof 
See I told ya, y'all can't handle the truth

Check out your weight, see if it's worth to war
We did the street life y'all niggas just got involved
My appetite for guns is similar to carnivores

Dislike me you head on, fight me you dead wrong

Don't let this song push you, the fourth hit you
Have you keyed up gasping for breath on the floor cripple

Got you imaging how this could really all be happening
My landscape of live niggas stretch from here to Maryland

Blaw put one in a nigga who be rambling
And blow a hundred thou if y'all niggas is really gambling
Gritty niggas feel the snap pop leaving it crackling
You know the bouncer keep all of my live niggas wild wit him

Traveling to see niggas from Howard through grambling
Ha round up my niggas to form a large gathering
Yo rattling niggas who walk bad limp
Beat you in the same place till the blues start blacking

CEO niggas stay general managing
Flipmode throwing those heavy bundles we carrying
Yo analyze my many live niggas cramming it
We throw a three pointer, while y'all niggas throwing javelins

And because of what you've given me, I know you'll deliver me
And I won't drown no matter how deep the river be

Same way you live in me I live in them

From inside of my heart when inside it was dark
And it doesn't rain any more only sunshine
No pain anymore.... I really love mine
You wash away the tears with the fears

After my back street operation
You broke me, you broke the painful news
You dumped me, you dumped me for a pretty young muse

So the lessons are there to learn
My scars are caused my cigarette burns
I have no mirrors and I spend my days
Reminiscing on your porcelain gaze

You're a promise that I never kept
Waiting in my room in vain
Time winds back and back again

Outside the school gates
We first met in a basement near the park
(Diamonds in the dark)
We danced all night and then we kissed
Your smile like diamonds in the dark

It's a long way to fall
When the words stray, no one calls

We would have little children
We would be together forever
(Diamonds in the dark)
We would live on Delancy Street
But then you cut your hair and it ended there

It's a long way to fall
When the words stray, no one calls

Looking back now I regret
You're a promise that I never kept
Waiting in my room in vain
Time winds back and back again

Now I've nothing left to lose
I'm clinging to a cliff-face staring at your shoes
And tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me do you feel the same?
Or are we just waiting to a day we can't
A day that we can't change, we can't change?

And now there's this no man's land
Between you and me
(Diamonds in the dark)
But I still wander in between
The sheets and streets and other places we've been

It's a long way to fall
When the words stray, no one calls

Looking back now I regret
You're a promise that I never kept
Waiting in my room in vain
Time winds back and back again

Back and back again, back and back again
Back and back again, back and back again
Back and back again, back and back again

Mystery Jets,"I've heard there's a place where we go to die 
It's a terribly overrated horse-shit shaped hole in the sky 
Kick off your heels and come with me tonight 
And we'll pack up your car and we'll board up the house 
And we'll die for our country though it never loved us 
And it didn't need us these wonderful wonderful people 
Will read of our love in newspapers and cry 

So may the bridges we burn light the way 
Out of the darkness of where we have been 
Though at times it may feel like a lie 
We both know nothing is quite as it seems 
When the debris comes falling from the sky 
Heaven will still be ours 

Load up Old Bill's twelve-gauge and meet me by the lake 
There's a place I know where nobody goes down by the old interstate 
The future gets shorter the longer we wait 
So let's step on the gas and if they come to find us 
We'll run to the hills they say hills never loved us 
But since we were children these wonderful wonderful people 
Will read of our love on our tombstones and cry 

And someone will get all the glory 
But I'll have yours and you'll have mine, you'll have mine 

So may the bridges we burn light the way 
Out of the darkness of where we have been 
Though at times it may feel like a lie 
We both know nothing is quite as it seems 
And I know when I look into the deep blue of your eyes 
Heaven will still be ours 

We'll be together until hell, 
Until hell, until hell freezes over 
Until hell, until hell, 
Until hell, freezes over. 
Together until hell, until hell 
Until hell, freezes over. 
Until hell, until hell, 
Until hell, freezes over. 

So may the bridges we burn light the way 
Out of the darkness of where we have been 
Though at times it may feel like a lie 
We both know nothing is quite as it seems 
Then when the world is itself about to die 
Our story will still play itself on the screens 
And all these stars that come falling from the sky 
Will always be ours",Radlands,2012
Mystery Jets,"I was gripped with a bit of fear
Worried the one thing that I loved
Back when I was just a kid
Might now never be enough
That the body I was in
Might belong to someone else
Someone kinder
Someone surer
Someone innocent
Young and beautiful
Someone purer

I was scratching at my skin
Hopin changes would begin
But what laid beneath was blood
Well of course
What the hell was I thinking of
Won't you take me down to the creek
Wash away our sins of sleep
I feel so tired
As though I might
Not wake at all on the other side
That's no way to go

Oh my dear one
Bathe me in your glow
Cut out my lonely heart
And bury it in the snow
Nothing really means nothing
Is the saddest thing I know
So deliver me from sin
And give me rock and roll

Give me rock and roll

And in the morning there'll be hope
And in the morning there'll be light
And if I sleep and dream up a system
A solution
To fend off perils of the night
Come on in, I'll be born again
Born again as someone else
Someone kinder
Someone surer
Someone beautiful
Someone purer

And when I am you'll know
And when I am you'll know

??????
The devil knows my name
Will salvation come
And wash away my pain?
For I was once a kid
With a pure and innocent soul
So deliver me from sin
And give me rock and roll

Give me rock and roll
Give me rock and roll
A pure and innocent soul
And a pure and innocent soul

I wanted to see what it would feel like to be invincible

I paid my forty bucks to the gal at the window pane

You had me by the nick on the rug with the tiger head

You had me dressing up in your Alexander McQueens
You had me till they made me go

It's where I've always been
But the edge is where all the sparks fly
When the wheel spins
I swear someone is leaving messages for me
Under my feet
In bubblegum on the sidewalks of my street
On the sidewalks of my street

Deep down I know I should leave the past behind
Maybe in time
If only I could learn to let go of the hand that first held mine

Took a walk down memory lane
Just to see what still remained
Only to find out just about everything had changed

We will splinter and we will divide
We will disappear to two different sides
And I hope that the world in which you find 
Yourself is better than the one you leave behind

One day we'll return and we'll take a look around
See the me and you of every town
The dreamers who are yet to learn
That everyone will try to shoot them down

Spilling their guts down the radio wire
Like preaching to the Christmas choir
But they wouldn't piss on you
Even if you were on fire

We will splinter and we will divide
We will dissapear to two different sides

And all the girls can tell you my tongue is quick
I rev it to the red line to get to the good tiime

You will always be an angel in my eyes
Blues and grays you been by my side
When my worlds crashing and pains intense
You calm my soul with perfect sense
Bring me back to earth, show me gems
Thank you for being my friend

(Chorus)
Forever and a day
You will be my everything
Forever and a day
You're my divine, the reason that I shine

[Verse 2]
You always believed in my dreams
Even when we were kids and our job was just to live
Anytime of day wiped my tears away
You protected me laughed my fears away
There's no one (no one) in this world
Who could ever take your place?

(Chorus)

[Verse 3]
We've been through joy and pain
Taken different paths still the loves the same
Your light shines all over me
Help me keep prospective, I know it ain't easy
You should know (you should know) I'd die for you
Call my name and I'll find you

This is for warm days and drift away
While the sun sets and the ghetto's play
Long nights on a hot summer's block
When you sip yo brew, and never touch yo glock
This is for eyes, that cry like yours and mine
To smile again, rise above the pain
This is for you and your crew, the ones that's true
Will always love you, no matter what you do

[Chorus]
Cause it's the life, the life, the life
The life, the life
It's the life, the life, the life, life
It's the life, the life, the life, yo life, yo life
It's the life, your life, my life

This is for soldier's who bust they guns(bust, bust)
In the name of freedom not the game of fun
True Queens, who raise they kids
Implement the knowledge, show em how to live
This is for those who stand in line and feed their babie's(i know)
While were runnin out of time
This is for the unjustice behind bars

Don't let em miss, miss guide you
They'll have you actin like the sun don't shine
And the sky ain't never blue
But you know and I know it's all about survival
This struggle of our people is like that unraveled
The poloticans they was never in control (never)
It's deeper then that a true battle for the soul
What they want is to bring us to our knees
So my people guard yo life by any means

[Verse 3]
This is for those who know we all gon die
Set up that way by infinite powers
Those who know the feel of chains
And the belly of the beast and of mental strain
This is for those who have they're own fallen angels
Tryna find a way on
This is for everybody (everybody)
And everybody is so life

I represent the left, with a death toll high
But I ride with the side called the F.O.I.
Where do or die is the code, banged out is the mode

Now everyone throw up your guns and unload
I'm bound to have your whole town sewed, 
Niggaz drinkin' and gettin blowed
To the sound layin' tracks down like the underground railroad

Can't no jail hold me, or no crackers control me
I shed tears for dead homies (and what) and fears Allah only
So haters don't want me to hit, tryin' to pitch ball four
Makin' peace with the beast but with me, bitch it's all war

I'm hardcore, hardline, hard edge on hard times
Here rap the records determined to get our shine
Turnin' water to wine, healin' the deaf, dumb and blind
With a stone backbone, I join your own to your own kind
So pass the clip as I mash the whip, with the master grip
Just waitin' for your ass to slip and I bang bang

[Chorus]
Bang bang.. bang, bang, bang
Bang bang bi-dang, bang bang
Bang, bang, bang
Bang bang bi-dang, bang bang
Bang, bang, bang
Bang bang bi-dang, bang bang
Bang, bang, bang
Bang bang bi-dang, bang..


Chitty-chitty bang bang, a gritty city gang thang
We maintain, rap jack and slang 'caine
And bring pain, think you can hang you best be sure
Cause the West is where I'm from so come test me now

Way-oy..., way-oy....
Way-oy..., way-oy...

Ring the alarm, code red, arm, leg, leg, arm, head
Soldiers on the move, show and prove, go out and get the dead
And spit the lead, let's quit this black and brown bloodshed
And get this bread, lay these crackers down in a mudbed

Like Spud Webb I go to war with the giants
Cause they just pawns in the game but I'm a lord of the science
I gets 'nough respect, while other niggaz is suspect
Ass-kickin' cash get them pretty boys, slash roughnecks

[Chorus]

So cocks the hammer back and rack the pump
Since the police hate me, unlock the safety just in case we have to dump
I'm ready for shit to jump, my niggas carryin' mags
Like ""Fuck these United Snakes and they American fags""

Uncle Tom's askin' Uncle Sam, ""Why can't we bond?""
But nigga Kam don't give a damn about no Yankee man
Stars and stripes I earn 'em, blow a whole through they sternum
See my arrangement with the Lord is I return 'em, he burn 'em

But I don't claim to be no saint, solely because I ain't holy
But you just got believe, foley
Everybody on the block knows, just how it go
I got flows, rock shows, clock dough and knock hoes

Down like a pimp on the track, just mackin'
Out for my dollars pop your collars, holla back, what's crackin'?
Shit it's your world I'm just a squirrel tryin' to find a nut
Catch me at the club, in the cut, watchin' the girls, wind it up

Mystic,"It was so beautiful
Remember how in love we were?
So in love.
So in love.
Once.
So in love.
Once.

She was a young girl
I was a young man
And I knew they would get her when I let go her hand
And then I let go
The inevitable
So beautiful
And susceptible
So wonderful
And so innocent
And after this neither one of us would benefit
Yeah, I was a dropout
She was a graduate
She said I?ll never be nothing she wasn?t having it
Yeah, I tried to break her down
I tried to reason it
She said I wasn?t nobody to be believing in
Yeah, what a waste of time
What a waste of mind
Your place of mind was a part of the design
Yeah, I used to call her up
She never called back
When she called that said I wasn?t all that
Yeah, I know that times change
And people change, too
I was a fool just to think that I could change you

Everyone?s got stories gone
About a love we once knew
So high in the beginning
Until the world cuts through
And then everything changes
Nothing feels the same
Piece by piece it falls apart until
All that?s left is blame

And if I had a chance to do it all over I?d do it exactly the same

I was a be-boy
She was a good girl
Turned hot girl
Had to be a hood girl
Never did she notice she would end up in a shook world
I was like look girl it?s all in the book
Yeah, I used to tell her jokes
I used to make her laugh
And if I had a whole dollar I would give her half
So delicate
And so intelligent
And then she trying to play me out just for the hell of it
Back when she was 19 not even 21
Used to do a thing getting somebody anyone
Thought that she was naive
Or was it really me
I do believe
She was the one that was fulfulling me
So we broke up at a barbecue
Drove home thinking never will I bother you
Yeah, I just didn?t know
What it was hidden for
She had me sitting low
But she was bullshitting, though

Everyone?s got stories gone
About a love we once knew
So high in the beginning
Until the world cuts through
And then everything changes
Nothing feels the same
Piece by piece it falls apart until
All that?s left is blame

So I just kept rhyming
I caught her eye again
Next thing you know she was hollering let?s try again
But I wasn?t buying in
Didn?t want to lie again
Love was in the frying pan
Baby, it?s done
But she started hanging out
And started being seen
Seeing things different
Said she wasn?t being mean
Yeah, if I let her in
Then I let her win
But I?m a veteran what?s better than a friend
Maybe she was an angel
But she?s in disguise
And I just didn?t see the God-light in her eyes
Or maybe I should I walk away
And cut all the ties
Stay on the rise
Leave love left where love dies
We were youngsters
But we?re older now
But the world is a little more colder now
And I?m just trying to get it all off my shoulder now
Baby, you can hold it down
I?ll see you in the wind

Everyone?s got stories gone
About a love we once knew
So high in the beginning
Until the world cuts through
And then everything changes
Nothing feels the same
Piece by piece it falls apart until
All that?s left is blame

That?s right, baby
Next life time
Yeah, ain?t that what they say?
Check it out
Love don?t hate
I got love for you
Always

You'll miss my love and miss my kiss,
You're gonna miss your little daddy when he goes away!

You'll be so lonely alone without me,
You know, baby, why I went away;
Oh, when I'm leaving, there's no doubt your heart'll be grieving;
You're gonna miss your daddy, mama, some of these days.

I don't care what they say.
I don't care what they think if you're leaving,

I don't care if they start to avoid me,
I don't care what they do.
I don't care about anything else but being with you, being with you.

Honey don't go, don't leave this scene,
Be out of the picture, and off of the screen.
Don't let them say we told you so,
They tell me you'll love me and then let me go.
I heard the warning voice from friends and my relations,
They tell me all about your heartbreak reputation.

I don't care what they think about me, and
I don't care what they say.
I don't care what they think if you're leaving,
I'm gonna beg you to stay.

I don't care if they start to avoid me,
I don't care what they do.
I don't care about anything else but being with you, being with you.

People can change, they always do,
Haven't they noticed the changes in you?
Or can it be that like love I am blind,
Do I want it so much 'til it's all in my mind?
One thing I know for sure is really, really real,
I never felt before the way you make me feel.

I don't care what they think about me, and
I don't care what they say.

Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to, do you know?
Do you get what you're hoping for?
When you look behind you there's no open door.
What are you hoping for, do you know?

Once we were standing still in time,
Chasing the fantasies that filled our minds.
And you knew how I loved you but my spirit was free,
Laughing at the questions that you once asked of me.
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to, do you know?

Now looking back at all we planned,
We let so many dreams just slip through our hands.
Why must we wait so long before we see
How sad the answers to those questions can be?

Weaving a magic spell all around you

Mystifier,"Afraid to walk the streets
In the coldness all alone
The blackness of the night
Engulfs your flesh and bones
Hoping for relief
From the fear you feel inside
Losing all perspective
Of reality in the night

Running from shadows
Blinded by fear
The horror of nightfall
Is ever so near
I slowly surround you
As terror sets in
Are you afraid of the night

I see the fright in your eyes
As you turn and run
But is your mind playing tricks

On a body so very young
Feeling as if no one cares
The fear runs down your spine
But I know I'll never rest
Until I know you're mine

Afraid to walk the streets
In the coldness all alone
The blackness of the night
Engulfs your flesh and bones

Every man's blood boils
When turmoil or life foils his plans
I've soiled my hands puttin' work in
Tryna keep from hurtin', cause fools be irkin' the fuck outta me
Now what do I gotta be, the epitome of nice?
Biterally precise when I talk
And assuming when I walk I never let the chip show
Cause people try and push it and they want to test my wits
So, I'm defensive, intense with my brain waves
And that's offensive, I sense so the pain stays close
Most don't depressurize
When I've had it up to where you can see it in my eyes
Realize there's no sanity
Hella profanity and a sort fuse to light
I snort and use the mic like a weapon
Effectin' any section I step in
Got 'em checkin' for the vibe that I'm protectin'

[Asop]
Who takes the time to look around?
That which surrounds makes the sound of compromise
Damn, they try to size up to such plateau's they'll never touch
Always talkin' about nothin', when you catch 'em, they always hush
Not much to be said, not enough to be heard when the words become absurd
When a voice of a gangsta starts to emanate from the 'burbs
Now anybody, everybody can try to rock a party
With that bump in your trunk, always drunk with your motions
With no devotion, collects an ocean of funds
In the worst way, idiots they stay this way
Me hella 'noid like a homophobic stuck in the middle of a gay parade
With no way to escape the confines of one's mind
A mental prison, a prism of thought
A crystalis of anger created by the action of strangers
A dangerous way to live your life the these days
Thinkin' he hella fresh though
A male emcee acting like a lesbo
Making one's life so stressful
That's why I escape with these with the ease of a hiatus in Fresno

A rusty nail in the foot
A cavity in the tooth
My threshold, the pressure build up, to me I'm aloof
And no proof of a cracking point
Mood swings like primates
Gorilla in the mist type range, I see all states
I King Kong shit, rip down the house structure
Like Empire State, the power will surely crush you 
As a pun on a radio edit, or nasty soda
I'm colder in the heart when the camel back breaks
No one seen the true beast, release him and danger follows
Like sequels to horror flicks, there's no tomorrow
No sun will come out, no Annie, no Daddy Warbucks
The Hard Knock Life begins when tempers flare up
An enemy will show no mercy, take it from Percy
And stop at No Limit until the bullshit's ended

Rage, trapped in a cage
Wrapped in a page, you never change
Severed off from the vain
Not enough blood to complain
Rage enters the brain
Now it's a pain you can't maintain
Leaving friendships slain, always the other one to blame
Never to be the same, rage is just a game played
To someone less it runs deep on an unseen plain
Peep the problems of the average man when he's insane
Losing personality replaced by the devil's frame
Madness, uncanny love for the fact his life is lived in sadness
Can't handle the Silence so The Lambs get reprimanded
For the underhanded, under kept raging thunderclap
You're wondering ""What's that?""
It's the wrath of rage-aholics

Beating on drums till the warrior battle comes

Think about the crazy and the strange shit
Then dig within inside and try to change shit
Reflections
Reflect your mind
Reflect through time

(PSC):
My relation to these words spoken over beats leaps to and fro
All around, bound the energy in miles
Piles up towards the sky
High quantity of thoughts
Reflect the truth, sold another brother on the watch
On the clock of life, the mirror view
The clearest of reflection
Inspection of the lie that lies deep behind the stressin'
And it's pressing me like time
Rhymes is just illusions
A world in confusion
A dream of revolution
These reflections like mine in the puddle of life
Skip rocks, waves making ripple effects
Situations etched, lessons in stone tablets
For the reference to the habit
Forming addictions to the memories of past shit
I let go, it comes back
Boomerang behavior runs common in the obstacles
I want to shake my coat tails
They follow on the missions of my failure
Bring me down, crush me
Reflections can be beautiful, but most the time they rush me

And in an instance you see the mirror image looking at you
Looks just like you, got you eyes, and you whole disguise
Reflections, he seen his image in the lake
Reflected on the grass roots which harbors all the snakes
Otherwise known as a snake pit
Remember the python on you ankle and all that fake shit?
Remember when the cake was lit, and the wind blew it out?
Before you could taste the cream, they sliced it up and threw it out
I recollect, I think back in retrospect
I reflect and connect my memories
Remember these good times and these hard times
But it's like that, and that's the way it is
And that's the way it was, but that ain't how it gotta be
Reflect your mind, it works every time
'cause if I knew then what I knew now, I'd be doin' fine
Reflect your mind, it works every time
'cause if you knew then what you know now, you'd be doin' fine

Reflect though time....
I peep when I meet people, evil or positive
We live in the middle, lost within the riddle
On God's reflection I stand, within an intersection of life lost
Double crossed by man, we stand ignorant
False prophet, gothic, prehistoric logic mixed our minds
Reflectin' signs of anger, reflection banger, reflection slanger
Reflection bombing hangars of 747's
Strangers want to blow this shit to heaven
Reflection war, reflectin' poor, reflectin' Cold War
Reflectin' old multiple metal jacket tactics
You might see Murs reflectin' curse
Reflectin' hurts, you's a bitch in a male skirt
If you don't work to change your world, reflectin' hurls
In life with wisdom, beyond ""blaow! blaow!""
Fake headwrapped female visions
We used to be in love with Duran Duran in '95

Change your name to Shanunu Brown, used to be Mary Tibbles

[Murs the Problem Child] 
Damn! y'all fools conceited reaction to the title 
Heard the first time but quickly changed your mind 
Once the performance is completed seated in the back 
Too cool to throw yo' hands up; I never quite understood 
Alla that what you too tough to have fun? 
Frisked at the door so I know it ain't the gun 
In your waistline that got you shootin daggers in my face 
When I rhyme - times done changed and it's strange 
Got motherfuckers ain't smiled at a rap show in a while 
Probably since the Fresh Prince was in style 
So it's apparent that you just don't understand 
The meanest mug in the club, don't make yo' ass the man 
Now if you want to be a fan then that's fine 
But all I really want to do is just break through to your mind 
And show you just because you did some hood time 
Don't make it impossible to have a good time when you out 
See where I'm from, it's the hardest motherfuckers come to party 
All shermed out, so what's this really all about? 
You gelled, cause this man's double L, well hell 
PSC tells me, it's jealousy that grips the heart 
Quit wasting playing hard roles, when yo' ass is 
Really just a mark and I should NEVER feel threatened 
Cause you see that man behind me?

When night falls I enter; being of a higher breed 
Of emcee I'll injure all these would-be rap crews 
The wannabe fat fools, coulda been rap dudes 
Refuse 'em resist 'em like Prop 187 do Mexicans 
Again and again, it's the Legends 
Lucky am I on wax, and on everyone's tape 
PSC the best friend of chorus 
The poorest excuse for you, to quit your boyfriend 
Just give him a chance (baby baby gimme one more chance) 
He'll rap right, if not, check my mic all night 
I rap tight, see me catching flights 
At the international terminal, where you don't go 
So don't go and diss, big groups, will get ripped 
And tripped by mic cords, and choked, with cordless 
A gift, of smooth talk, walk the walk of a winner 
Far from a beginner, guess who's for dinner? 

[The Crow Eligh] 
Cerebral tornadoes rip logic like frolicking paperbacks 
The tone is incomplete extension, in all of the later tracks 
Extracting vitamins, from machinery that creates it 
As long as the people are fiending for the truth 
And not counterfeit, I'm the bounty sheriff merit holder 
Winner of awards in the midst, of clashing swords 
It's match point on the court, a point is scored 
Referee the rest will see my yellow warning on the toilet seat 
At least I have my dignity, infinity, a legendary entity forever 

""He's a living legend..""

[Aesop] 
A legendary flame of a character with no name 
Same instance, persistence to have latitudes 
Bruise your knees, you will lose 
A life or limb, whichever you choose 
Find some foe in him, words tend to catch a phrase 
That will amaze most from the gazing point, with a judgment standard 
Categorized into a tainted picture before it gets a chance to be painted 
There's no blanket for the truth (I can't see!) 
I got a loose end of a lie, this amateur he tried to get by 
The size is more greater, and equator more immense 
Since it makes more sense to make some sense, or maybe you know 
Out of these weak ass rhymes you roam but you stay in flow 
In this dense a body of mockery

Goodbye to crust emcees; often lonely and homely 
If you could only capture the power of love 
Like ten albums in this glove, R.B.I. 
While you hittin pop flies.. and sacrifice your life 
And die in hurricane and methane 
We below shit like propane, Living Legends spiritual cocaine 
In a line if you know 
What's up with the times cause we straw the line 
(We straw the line)

[The Bad News Bear Grouch] 
Let's get literal it's me and my team, I got a dream 
(""He's a living legend.."") and a clean way to achieve it 
I conceived it myself, with a little bit of help, from my friends 
Made amends with my soul, now I'm ready to begin 
First ingredient is dope shit, and fool we already wrote it 
Mix up with the motives now we're forming perfect batter 
Had a vision it would burn, if I measured too precisely 
I add a pinch here and, there if the spice be right 
We might prepare this feast for many thousands 
So eat when you're aroused and enjoy - Legendary bitch!

Got all these crazy white boys yelling Cobain's back

Yeah bitch, yeah bitch, call me Steve-o

(Yeah)
(2-chainz!)
Yeah bitch, yeah bitch, call me 2-chainz
Eat your girl, wear my necklace, call it food chain
I'm a wild boy, been that way for a while boy
All I kill is beats and pussy, still ain't went on trial for it
South side, my chain glowing
If them lames going, then I ain't going
My aim good, my pistol dirty
Chopper clean them like dish detergent
Kobe Bryant, but the sicker version
Big meech, but the spitter version
Stacey dash, but a thicker version
Getting head while the engine running
Ugh!

(Meek Milly)
(Mm-maybach music)
(Aye)
I'm a wild boy, strapped down like a cowboy
I'm really in the game, you just a towel boy
I pull up in that thang all on them alloys
With so many carrots on, bugs bunny'll die for
Your bitch call me Steve-o, cause I ball like I'm d-rose
My neck be on sub-zero, and I won't save her, no hero
My wrist done cost me a maro, got your whip on my wrist
You keep my name in your mouth, but it keep your bitch on my dick
Nigga!

Bitch, I got my beanie and my hoodie
Here go the dick, bet you know where to put it
I'm harder than buckwheat's head
You niggas softer than jello pudding
I stack them up, I keep counting digits
You falling down to London bridges
Laughing at you bitches like nana-booboo
Bitch, cause I'm back up in here
I rip it up, I put it down when it get mean
2 chain, meek mill with the nicotine
French Montana and machine gun Kelly
I ain't gotta tell you how I act on 16
Gangsta’s don’t dance no more
Pussy ass nigga better stay in his place
How many times you seen one fucking rapper
Kill so many mother fucking rappers with an 8?

R-r-r-r-riding with them young boys, rolling up that o-g
Rather have a hothead, then to have some cold feet
Homeboy it's a new day, all my jewels is blu-ray
On your wife like cool j, beat it up like the new dre
Money here be too grown, fresher than a newborn
They try to sign a whole group, started from the group home
Moving like a boss move, mgk my dog fool
You know I'm a wild boy, cocaine cowboy

(Chea)
(Yeah)
Had a show in Cleveland, law shut it down
Dropped that gangsta shit, security couldn't control the crowd
Bitches on that drink, my niggas on that loud
Niggas talking fowl? my pistol talking pow!
Yeah bitch, yeah bitch, I'm a dope boy
Top gone (transparent), where it go boy?
Lamb feta cheese sauce inside broccoli
Got that machine gun Kelly and it’s screamin' cock me

Everybody shut up (shut up)
Couple of them ready to do it different whenever I tell them bitches to come up (come up)
And I ain't talking for the stares, I'm talking for air (gasp) somebody light a blunt up (blunt up)
Call me Steve-o bitch, I put a nutt up to in front of your mother's face like it's nothing
Puff it till' my eyes yellow when I'm with them sun up (what up?)
What I need a shirt fo? what I need a shirt fo?
Tatt'ed up from my head to toe like what I need this shirt fo?
What do I need to work fo? I smack the boss at my job, boy
Fucking hoes like I'm Austin powers, giving golden showers, that's wild boy!
