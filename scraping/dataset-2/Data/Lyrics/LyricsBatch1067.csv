This cute story of Army life romance by Don Cornell

I left my heart at the stage door canteen

I sat there dunking doughnuts
'Til she caught on

But quickly drove away.

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young,
Take the girls tonight
And sing this sleighing song;

Words and music by Bob Merrill, 1952
Poor little robin walkin', walkin', WALKIN' TO MISSOURI;
He can't afford to fly.
Got a penny for a Poor little robin, walkin' walkin' WALKIN' TO MISSOURI
Got a teardrop in his eye.
The above is the chorus for the three verses which follow:
1. I hope my story don't make you cry,
But this birdie flew too high;
He flew from his old Missouri home.
He fell right into the city ways, like dancin' in cabarets,
From party to party he would roam.
BR
BR(Chorus)
BR
BR2. He met a birdie who looked so nice,
BRA real bird of paradise,
BRGood lookin' but fickle in the heart.
BRShe gave him kisses and gave him sighs,
BRBut oh, how she told him lies,
BR'Cause she loved another from the start.
BR
BR(Chorus)
BR
BR3. His dreams are battered, his feathers bent,
BRNow he hasn't got a cent;
BRHe feels like his heart is gonna break.
BRSo if he ever walks up to you,
BRPlease throw him a crumb or two,
BR'Cause you could have made the same mistake.

Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day

Swing Cats,"The French are glad to die for love
They delight in fighting duels
But I prefer a man who lives
And gives expensive jewels
A kiss on the hand
May be quite continental
But diamonds are a girl's best friend

A kiss may be grand
But it won't pay the rental
On your humble flat
Or help you at the automat

Men grow cold 
As girls grow old
And we all lose our charms in the end

But square-cut or pear-shaped
These rocks don't loose their shape

But diamonds are a girl's best friend

There may come a time
When a hard-boiled employer
Thinks you're awful nice
But get that ice or else no dice

He's your guy 
When stocks are high
But beware when they start to descend

It's then that those louses
Go back to their spouses
Diamonds are a girl's best friend

I've heard of affairs
That are strictly platonic
But diamonds are a girl's best friend

And I think affairs 
That you must keep liaisonic
Are better bets 
If little pets get big baguettes

Time rolls on
And youth is gone
And you can't straighten up when you bend

But stiff back 
Or stiff knees
You stand straight at Tiffany's

Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

We've got nothing to lose
We've got time on our side
Let's take a magic carpet ride

Come live with me
We'll be the people we once dreamed we could be
See the things we've been longing to see
Somewhere deep in the night

Somewhere deep in the night

I don't know if it's right
I don't care if it's wrong
Let's take this chance before it's gone

Somewhere deep in the night

What else is there to say
When tomorrow's been and gone
And given in to yesterday

If I'd known before the things that I know now
I'd be way above the ground
A thousand miles high
Spinning and spiraling through the sky

Waiting for the sun to shine
And brighten up my days
Drifting, floating in and out of time
You came and took my breath away

Now we're climbing up above the highest cloud
And we're never coming down, a thousand miles high
Spinning and spiraling through the sky
Through the sky

High as the moon and the stars above
Out of our minds and in love
Through the sky

Why you had to play that stupid game
You know you've only got yourself to blame

When you don't want my love

How many times did I hear my friends
Say that I should have known better
How many times did I listen to a word they said

How could I know that there
Really wasn't someone else
That you were loving instead

What kind of fool are you?
When you find that all you're searching for
Means nothing at all
With no one by your side

Don't be around
Here I am...?
Now You're Not Here
Love was young
We saw beyond a sky that had no limits
Much higher than the highest star
Beyond the furthest planet
We thought that we could change the world
And everything in it
But time ran out of endless hours
Gave into doubt, were we just playing an endless game
That no one ever wins
If I could run away
Hide away
Forget the way feel
But your memory keeps haunting me
Convincing me it's real
Now you're not here
Now you're not here
Love and hate
Left up to fate
A life we took for granted
We couldn't stop our running from the things we always
wanted
No long goodbyes
No tears to cry
And nothing to believe in
But now you're gone
We'll never know a love that's grown
Time took away
All that it gave to the two of us
If I could run away
Hide away
Forget the way I feel
But your memory keeps haunting me
Convincing me it's real
Now you're not here
Now you're not here
When our hearts were young and nights were long
We'd let the morning sun kiss our eyes open
Precious dreams that we had now they are dead and gone
The promises we made have all been broken
If I could run away
Hide away
Forget the way I feel
But your memory keeps haunting me
Convincing me it's real
Now you're not here
Now you're not here
In my arms
In my life
Lovin' you, is just a memory
Now you're not here
Now you're not here

Has brought my lover to me

It's Willie Stubz and Beatnuts, Beatnuts and Willie Stubz 
What up, real pimp niggas on the cut, what up 
Uh huh, let's blaze it 
Yo check it out yo 
I hit the world unexpected like a meteor shower 
Twist L's, Hennesey sour, pass on the powder 
Make an entrance like a vigilante wit a vengeance 
Fight for independence, like my descendants 
Write a whole chapter, compressed in one sentence 
I blast in an instance, America's most makin' a toast 
Fine women playin us close 
Underground to the street level 
Money and jewels we embezzle 
Never play the fool for the devil 
The temptation is there to hug you like a grizzly bear 
Fuckin' wit the wild life, beware 
Willie Stubz the under boss and I move wit force 
When po-po take a loss I have no remorse 
You know the deal, only blazin' shit that could feel 
Beat nuts be movin' the crowd like blue steel 
Cho-cha-cha, that's the three course meal 

""Cha cha cha, forward back 
Cha cha cha cha, back forward""

When you ain't on point like hard nipples 
I flow, y'all clowns merely trickle 
Like hot sweat down a fat bitch ass cheek 
I'm so nice that I'm not, call me nasty 
I bite my toenails and spit em at wack niggas 
I used to sell crack, now I'm gettin' rap figgas 
Too Hype to be Unsigned, so I unwind, puffin on vines, baby and nines 
Till the spotlight is mine, pullin' up in the Lex truck 
Wit four chrome rims, ha for the best buck 
Three TV's and twelve-changer cd's

So butter me, bitches want to mother me 
Take they bras off and smother me 
Irkin' me, for an appointment 
'cause they love jerkin me off the ointment 
It's Pyscho, the new pimp, the new pimp 
Dead all the bullshit, get wit this new hit 
As I hit the bong so, stay Puff like Sean Combs 
Bang heads like bongos, you get the like The Gong Show 
Catch you comin' out the tree spot 
Cripple you wit a knee drop 

Now you struttin' real cute like a peacock 
Personal injuries when faces run into these 
Y'all niggas need more treats, fuck them keyboard beats 
Hip hop hippy, jump in my whippy 
Light up the clippy and let the vibes hit me, c'mon

Flip and pull your lungs out wit a hanger

You on some Eric B. shit like ""What happened to peace?"" 
Got no problem wit smashin' teeth, fuckin' your wife 
Robbin you nigga, kidnappin' your niece 
Bless your cheek wit a permanent crease 
I'm a problem you don't need 
Y'all probably go run for police 
Y'all could sell all the drugs in the world

We're off the coast, we're off the shore
Of Normandy!
We're going to hit the beach
Men and machines, and ships of war
Hoping to blast their way through the door
To liberty - Allied Victory
La-la-lala la-da-genie, la-la-lala la-da-genie
Hit the Beach! Hit the Beach! Hit the Beach!
Oh oh Hit the Beach! Hit the Beach! Hit the Beach!
Men around me, men I know
Got their stomachs in the throats
But they don't let it show, no-no-no!
I got my carbine, I got my bayonet, I got my hand grenades
And my steel helmet
And a picture of my girl, and a picture of my girl

Hit the Beach! Hit the Beach! Hit the Beach!
Oh oh Hit the Beach! Hit the Beach! Hit the Beach!
And now we're going in, we wanna get blown away
Don't wanna die
It's too late now, the ramp goes down
No turning back, we're going in
All around me I see death and destruction,
And the sea is red with blood
Pushing through the waves, through the blinding smoke
God it's raining steel
Soldier in front of me is terrified, he doesn't want to die
I don't want to die!
Three seconds later, shrapenl wipes off his face,
And it goes floating by
Whoa-oh-oh, oh, oh Hit the Beach!
Oh-oh-oh, oh oh-o Hit the Beach!

But they're exploding into little bits

In the pursuit of happiness
Ain't it just like you,
It's just like me.
Love is obsession, lovers pine
Always working against the brain
But it's always there, there for always
Deserted in the ruins, of your own building
It seems like there's no hope of repair(?)
Standing in the rubble, no roof above you
No walls around you to keep the world at bay
[chorus 1:]
(needle around the tear)?
I need an elixir
I'm feeling lovesick
(needle around the tear)?
I need an elixir
To fix the light
No way out of this nothingness
Nothing can replace the emptiness
But it's just like you,
It's just like me
Oh-oh
Love is a poison in my veins
A part of me that waxes and waves
But it's inside of you,
Inside of me
Amidst the devastation, or was it sabotage
Concrete foundations - all that remains
Standing in the rubble, no roof above you
No walls around you to keep the world at bay
[chorus 2:]
(needle around the tear) ?
I need an elixir
I'm feeling lovesick

Hold on to your love - it's all that you've got

Another last regret
Another hour that I can't forget you
Another night alone without you
There, there

There's a place where I can't feel you
You're just a memory
And everything about you isn't real
'Cause it's easier when to dream
That you're not there

Someday I'll be free
Someday I'll be happy
Someday I won't care

There where the sun is gonna shine
Much brighter
There where the pain in my heart
Feels lighter, there

Winter came right after summer
The leaves were on the ground
Didn't notice that they'd turned to brown
You and I our time has come and gone

Someday I'll be free
Someday I'll be happy
Someday I won't care

There where the sun is gonna shine
Much brighter
There where the pain in my heart
Feels lighter

Someday I won't miss your kisses
Or be thinking 'bout the smell of your hair
Maybe I'll turn around and finally find myself there
How do I get there from you?

I built a magic world around you
We were living in a special place and time
I close my eyes and I still find you there

There where the sun is gonna shine
Much brighter
There where the pain inside my heart
Feels lighter

Someday I won't miss your kisses
Or be thinking 'bout the smell of your hair
Maybe I'll turn around and suddenly find myself there

Fuckin up shit with the 9 inch chrome

Tryin to sell that fuckin dope he bought in H-Town
Couldn't sell in Houston, so I guess he figured
I'mma go to Port Arthur and run them fuckin niggaz

Brought his fuckin gun, guess he shoulda bust
So they took his shit and put his dick in the dust
Stupid ass nigga had the nerve to come back
Rollin on the cuts in his white Cadillac

Got to the block and the guns just exploded
Shot his car up with the 9, end of clip the clip that he unloaded
Sent the nigga home to his momma like a ho
They jacked all his money and they stole all his dope

Stop that shorty, I know you love me

Feed y'all niggas more gutters like a mutherfuckin' all you can eat
And make you bounce how poncho will play the congo
And bang on the bongo, free to bounce on the bongo

Ricky got shot in the face,
I saw Abrahams brain split on the pave,
He jumped off the block, right where the kids play,
We used to sit everyday,
Chattin' sh*t, We all strayed,
I guess its deep-seeded urban decay,
From my angle I can see the ghetto burning away,
I wanna cry, I find myself turning away,
This kid 16, Burning the yay,
Mislearning the game,
I send a prayer for the pain

Someone always seems to try,
To come in the way, Is it supposed to be like this?

U can't tell what's round the corner,
Going to jail, Or fail,
Getting f**ked up,
Like them little black kids from Bronxtale,
Well, As long as we're living in hell,
In the streets violence will always swell,
I can tell u a thousand tales,
Documented and detailed,
And most niggas can relate around the world,
My nigga Kurt got found,
With bullet rounds in his chest,
Up in the ATL,
And the papers hate me well,
I'm trying to revoke the violence,
Not promote the violence,
This is my broken silence,
And u can hear my screams louder than police sirens,
I'm tryna fight back,
Like my n*gga little Byron,
Just as long as I love and stay vibrant,
I shall provail,
And I shall not betrayal,
I shall put my hands up at the end and say I done wrong,
Only time I tell, fo' real

I guess we need more stability,
It's like we're imprisoned in the ghetto and it's getting to me,
To the point where I'm feeling institutionalized,
Look in my eyes,
U'll see pain in it,
But who can decide?
Whether I stay entrapped in,
Packed in,
Or fly from the restraining of thoughts packed in,
Inside my brain but,
I proclaim that I will withstand the rain in,
In order to get out this game, plus,
The media, Government,
Tried to blow us,
But they can't out the flame,
Or doubt the name,
Sh*t and ur evolution's about to change,
Trust me,
Sitting round tables with the ties and shirts,
With the lust to discuss me,
You disgust me,
So I must be,
As level headed as I can,
To neva back pedal on the plan,
So we can all hold hands together,
Unite so we can live as one

I used to think about, immature things
You know like, do you love me, do you want me, are you gon' call me like you said you would, is this really your real phone number?
But you know, I'm a man now baby, a grown man
And I came a long way
And experience taught me one thing
Taught me to hold on to my love

[Verse 1:]
Sometimes, I just can't help thinkin' livin' without you baby
See, sometimes, I just can't live cryin' about you baby
I'm not worried 'bout a doggone thing, I'll take anything you bring
although I love the sunshine, I still like sather rain
'Cause when I'm in my lonely mood, and I just can't be with you
I tried everything to occupy my mind, and there was no substitute

[Bridge:]
Thinkin' all that life would be, when you are not around
I just could not find my way, I wouldn't even know up from down
But since I've had you in my life, all things can be found
Strong and true baby, all comin' from you ohh you
Chorus:
I call your name girl (whenever I am lonely baby)
I call your name (when I feel the need of love)
I think of you, and it eases the pain
Take away the strain

[Verse 2:]
'Cause I don't worry what my people say, in my life today
Although they try to say you're not the one for me, I love you anyway
'Cause their intentions might be cool, if what they say was true
But there's more to you than they can ever see, and they don't even know you

(Bridge)

(Chorus)
You, I call your name (sometimes, I get lonely babe)
I call your name (I just can't seem to help myself)
I think of you (When I wanted to be alone, so I'll call your, I'll call your name)
I do, you do baby, we do girl
I, I, I love you, you you love me, and and I know
Whoa ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh ooh ohh
I call your name, and it eases the pain
See, I just don't feel all by myself tonight
It seem like someone else is out there, oh thinkin' upon someone else, child
So you will know where I'm comin' from
Ohh when I'm lonely, when I'm discouraged, I'll, I'll call your name baby
There is, no substitute, no one could take your place
No more than they can ever see
That's why I call your name
Oh baby, when I am lonely
When I am discouraged
I call your name girl
I think of you, and it eases the pain, take away the strain

Switch,"I'm sittin' at a coffee table, unable to see straight
Watchin' parallel lines unwind and undulate
Behind the rain-streaked windowpane, the scene's bleak
Another train leavin' home
Conceding defeat with a low moan
Hangin' in A sky, made of stone
Everybody's leavin' home, I called my man Jerome
To come meet me in the twilight zone
Leave your mobile phone at home and come alone
I bought him coffee and a snack
Settled back, started speakin'
He was tweakin' with the peak of his cap
While I'm seekin' to discover what it takes to stay sober
Not cover my mistakes
Try to maybe make sense of the evidence
It's over, she's gone for good
Why should I lie, singin' a killer's lullaby
Identified by the dying ring of her goodbye
The last thing you hear before your life disappear

Now it just gets worse, like my stomach 'll burst
Feel like I've been cursed
With seven centuries of bitter memories
And inadequacies, previous he's and she's
I'm movin' round this old house for the last time
Scene of my past crimes, been here for lifetimes
Hearin' the chimes of the old clock that used to mock
You got eternity for takin' stock
This place is like a padlock
You look shocked
Trust me, nothing ever moves but the dust
There's just us and I'm here to torment and tease
And that's how it was for centuries
Me and my memories, till you brought the keys
Took the couple of Saturdays
I moved in runnin' from tragedies and boozing
Seven hundred years since I came here
You appear, same hair, same quizzical stare
I couldn't get near
And the sheer frustration was more than I could bear
I was really cursed, thought I'd been through the worst part
That was just the first part, just the start
Every night I'd be sitting with dread, breaking my heart
In case the man she'd been chasin' gets to first base
And I just can't escape, I'm in bad shape
You making love to someone else is more than I can take
And so I make all the movement I can to no avail
Scream and yell, sinkin' deeper into my personal hell

I'm getting heated, I'm sorry, have another coffee
I needed to release my sparrow chest from just a piece of this pressure
Unless an escape route is found
I'm going down underground
Into lifetimes of pain, it's absurd
The heaviest chain is contained is the sound of one word
So I'm referred back to hell, huh
Just as well, I hate needles an' get twinges at the thought
Of syringes

J (as in Jerome), I'm going insane with shame
I dream and watch her makin' love over and over again
With what I call a farmer's swain
Unintelligent, pea-brained retard who's dick is always hard
Oh God, of course I'm jealous, fellows
Oversexed flexing his pec's
Jesus, what's he going make her do next?
I'm mad vex, the way she gently scratches his chest
You used to do that to me back in 1253
Pity me, while you lie with your lover
I stare and suffer in despair while you ruffle his hair
Unaware of who else is there
I move quick, I want to try my trick one last time
You know it's possible to vaguely define my outline
When dust move in the sunshine
So I'm tryin' to change, vibrate myself to near-human pitch
Which reminds me how I used to come unstitched
And switch 'round the house in a blind rage
It took years and an ocean of tears to find the key to this
Cage
And write another stage into a new age
It's difficult to gauge
But I know that I'll see you again, on that you may depend
I just don't know how or when
Sleep on, my lost love on gone

Jerome took me home under steel skies
Knowing I'm prone to dramatize but unknown for telling lies
And what I verbalize he can see behind my eyes
The why oh why's that identify killer lullabies
And he surmised
No surprise couldn't hear that
Closed my eyes as he steered that old black BM home again

I said when was the last time that you found you're lasting?
When was the last time you tried something for the first time?

When was the last time you did something that made you feel like a kid
Life ain't just like a [?] we're moving just the little ones
It's been so long
When was the last time we held hands and we looked at the stars as they fell
Laughing hard at ourselves, we're moving just the little ones
It's been so long
It's been so long

Attention please, attention please
Can I have everybody's attention please
So humorous, we laugh at all ay'all 
The alliance has now been officially formed
Ruff Ryder, Flipmode, 2000, it's now official baby
It's another headbanger

[Swizz Beats:]
Swizz Beats, who hits on your streets every six weeks
I be on the MP so much that my wrist's weak
Ain't shit sweet, pile 'em in here
All my thugs in the clubs start wildin' in here
Now put your bottles in the air, then light your dutches		
Me and Busta keep it tight like liposucion
Niggas that don't like me get the knife for frontin'
Cause one night in the club gets your life on crutches
You got that whodie, I'll cock that forty
Flyin' in the 5 with the top back on it 			
Stop that shorty, I know you love me
Probably sample one of my beats then owe me money
Plus you don't know me money, so stop the rumors
Before you need the janitors to come mop the room up
Ryde or Die Volume two, smash the charts
Now put your hands in the air for the black Mozart, OH!

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
(Ohhhh), Now come on
(Screeeam), Jump baby come on
Get your hands up, (What!), now all my ladies do it
Get your hands up, (What!)
Now let me walk you through it

Get your hands up, (What!), now all my ladies do it

why'all niggas try to front, I'll send my crew on a hunt
Bunch of scheming ass niggas smoking gats and blunts
Busta Rhymes, Flipmode represent
For the Ruff Ryder, and my nigga Swizz
And we gonna be here to present
why'all niggas with some other shit to bang in the street
And block the fuck out, bang the fuckin' floor with your feet
Before we bang why'all niggas all with the heat
Feed why'all niggas more gutters like a mutherfuckin' all you can eat
And make you bounce how poncho will play the congo
And bang on the bongo, free to bounce on the bongo
From New York to Colorado, so just follow
I'm living for today and livin' tomorrow
Open up your mouth, I got somethin' big for you to swallow
Blow you through the chest with a hollow
Like the foul shit you waste and transpired right infront the impalo 
Yo, the general Busta Busta shock and memorable 				
You know we precious like minerals, and deadly like burials

[Swizz Beats:]
Listen, Flipmode and Ruff Ryders bang out hits
S-W-I two Z's bang out clips 
Bang out chicks, for fun we bang out whips 
why'all go to war with revolvers that bang out flicks 
Now find me on two-fifth in the summer when it starts			
And iced up, nice cut, new pair of Jordans
Thinkin' of extortin, nigga your life ain't important 
Your camp hotter than ours?, the fuck why'all snortin'
My thugs bang out bricks, swing, mix, throw dem grams 
Hash smokers, hopin' more and out of soda cans		
(Yo Swizz, I heard you stole), Whoa! listen man
Mindin' my business will make you a missin' man
See the wrist and hand?, got plaques on the wall
And a fifth in hand, I'll put your back on the wall
Nigga don't ask me no more about nuttin' you hear
Just scream and shout and just wild in here

And left the winter clothes in the dorm 
I don't want a problem, it's too much flesh out 
They want me to cock back and blow their chest out 
See me in the yard with a Newport, stressed out 
It's too damn hot to walk around here vest out 
Feel me dawg, make money or make a hit 
Other than that, can't think of shit

His clothes or his Jordans don't fit, who want a problem?

But anyway, back on track 
Honey in the black on black, ass all fat 
Whattup ma? You feel like winnin, feel like spinnin?

Yo, yo ,yo
Nigga pack up, watch a pro player get her stack up
Cowards in my way any second then he plaqued up
Dogs all behind me roll out, section racked up
Simple situation blown away cause you backed up
Watch out now know you heard about the Ruff ryde
Deaded at the door watch the floor, who the tough guy?
Brick house run 'em down know what we about shut 'em down
Keep these niggas like ""Here she comin now""
Yo in public yo I'm evil
Fuck wit only people that I know that's my peoples
The fake shit I see through
Hated just to be you cause faggots is lame
Get fucked say ""Gettin fucked"" nigga why change?
It's anotha that was sweet takin out
Anotha that I peep fakin out
Tryin to take the easy route
A yo look I hold it down got my back while we ride

Right Now
We ain't playin' wit y'all
We ain't playin' wit y'all
Stop playin' Drag

[Drag-On]
A-yo I spit these bars to make ya head shake
Fuck bitches 'til the bed break
Let's see how much lead you can take
Never let a nigga pay for what I give away
We can all share
Clip to my waist it's all spare
So run dammit, run 
When I bust my gun
I miss none
Put y'all in critical condition
I'm the talk of the town when it comes to fuckin' bitches
Or layin' niggas down
Drag bust the most rounds
While y'all niggas dibble and dabble
The shit I pull up wit
It'll feel like it grabs you
We ain't fuckin' I had you
Shit I know Drag'll be glad to
If I had to
Soon as she in the bathroom
I'm in her ass too
Gotta six shot shooter
That'll pop through ya
Glock ruger
In case I call my block movers
State troopers on my ass
Shit let me see them touch 160 on the dash
My Z look pretty when it's fast
I bet 50 I'ma juice the city before I pass
And if you want to catch fire better step on the gas
The opposite of H2O
Want to be a hero
When the fires on
Y'all won't even see ya moms
Even if she was screamin' at the top of her lungs
Niggas either burn to the bone or leave the shit alone
In case of a fire never take the elevator
Walk 2 flights hold ya breath and take the steps (Uhh)

[Chorus: Swizz Beats]
Do my ladies run this uhh-huh
Yes they do run this mutha-uhh-huh
Do my ballers run this uhh-huh
Yes they do run this mutha-uhh-huh
Do my mamis run this uhh-huh
Yes they do run this mutha-uhh-huh
Do my dogs run this uhh-huh
Yes they do run this mutha-uhh-huh

[Drag-On]
A-yo I only fuck bitches that's flexible
Ankle touch neck sex incredible
When Drag about to spark cats
Ain't no barging wit that
When my gun spit it say ""Where The Target At?""
'cause I'm fire so I speaks wit heat
So let me walk that walk
'cause like a teacher I'ma talk wit chalk
That'll outline y'all like a fresh pair of Nikes
Stay wit those 
Even if I'm bare toed you see the stripe
I leave blood stains on sponges
Cum stains on comforters
I leave rooms foggy
'Til where y'all can't find me
Keep a bad mami
Twisting up the green scent
Like tangerine face out of a magazine
Like ebony
On the block I pump the ivory
Never pay for show
I only fuck wit those that never ate before
That means no food, no cars and just skip bail
The only thing on they plate is no more than fish scale
The blow you only know about is the air outside
I have nightmares before I sleep I pray y'all fry
For a pie I lay out guys
'cause what I keeps layin' on my dresser
Keeps layin' niggas on top of stretchers
Lightweight but I give off pressure in all measures
Never chase treasures
Flame niggas for pleasure
Red/Gold vest
Bullets go through tef

Swizz Beatz,"Night time sharpens, heightens each sensation
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination
Silently the senses abandon their defenses

Slowly, gently night unfurls it's splendor
Grasp it, sense it, tremulous and tender
Turn your face away from the garish light of day
Turn your thoughts away from cold unfeeling light
And listen to the music of the night

Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams
Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before
Close your eyes, let your spirit start to soar
And you'll live as you've never lived before

Softly, deftly, music shall surround you
feel it, hear it, closing in around you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness which you know you cannot fight
The darkness of the music of the night

Let your mind start a journey to a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the world you knew before
Let your soul take you where you long to be
Only then can you belong to me

Floating, falling, sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me, savour each sensation
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in
To the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night

You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make the music of the night",Alien (Interlude),2002

Every time we bring y'all niggas to say
We dare y'all to say somethin'

You can sit and watch and gamble around
Motherfuckers no we holdin' the crown
I dare y'all to say somethin'
Before we flood this shit that'll go through your whole town
Motherfuckers know we makin' y'all drown
I dare y'all

I put my foot in your ass just like a kung-fu flick
Bust my tool quick hittin' with the force of a mule kick
Spit fly shit as if I was baggin' a new chick
Instead of bitin' mines, it be best you bite on the chew stick
Funny how niggas be tryin' to do shit
When I rock a light bling all my pinky gleam in the blue shit

Bitches lovin' the way we always pass through shit
The way we rep the gutter and bring you the brand new shit
Double back, y'all niggas don't really want to trouble that
Brass knuckle beat you stupid, with a belt buckle rap
Couple cracks, some weed, back when we used to muscle that
And take a niggas shit like we like we fightin' to get our hustle back

Used to be the shit, now you writin' your suicidal rap
Frontin' like your the champ, fightin' to get your title back
Remind me that, this could even cause a homicidal act
And if you blamin' the music then watch me write the title track
The way that we kill and make you wanna cop that
Fuckin' with corny niggas you need to stop that shit

Come on, please just let a nigga pop that shit
All in they trunk, you know you want to rock that
Stay reppin' the struggle, busy pullin' my man's up
Shit we givin' y'all niggas might even swell y'all glands up
Stop, all of my niggas, all of my bitches stand up
And rep whatever you reppin' and put your fuckin' hands up

Right before we run it all in the ground
Motherfuckers know we shuttin' it down
I dare y'all to say somethin'
Motherfuckers want to give me a pound
Every time we bring y'all niggas to say
We dare y'all to say somethin'

You can sit and watch and gamble around
Motherfuckers no we holdin' the crown
I dare y'all to say somethin'
Before we flood this shit that'll go through your whole town
Motherfuckers know we makin' y'all drown
I dare y'all

Damn I Miss You
It's still gone ride, it's still gone ride
Uh uh, uh uh, c'mon, uh, uh, yeah, ride, uh

Damn I miss you
Ooh I feel better than before
We should've never separated
Paused or hesitated
You rocked me to sleep
It's like my body levitated
Looking in the mirror 
But the heat makes it less clearer
It's all fogged up, face me baby
Put your fingers in my mouth, let me taste the gravy
Reunited, feel good, real good, squeeze me
I tell you that I Love You 
But you wouldn't believe me

[Chorus: Mashonda]
Ghetto loving, when I'm with you 
Anything you want I will do
Ghetto loving, when I'm with you 
Anything you want I will do 

[Mashonda]
Hello
Baby
There is something that I want to say to you
You've been on my mind now
For a while and I just don't know what to do
I've been thinking of holding you (holding you)
Showing you, what I'm all about
And I promise that I will do
Everything you want without a doubt

[Chorus]

[Mashonda]
I know
That we've
Had our share of ups and downs but that's in the past
If you promise to hold me down
Then our love will have a second chance to last
I've been thinking of holding you
Showing you, what I'm all about
(And I promise) And I promise that I will do
Everything you want without a doubt

[Chorus]

[LL Cool J]
Forget the past
We like Bonnie and Clyde from now on
Back to back, through the ups and downs
Right or wrongs, lay down 
Let me kiss you all down your back
Then I'll go further down, swirl my tongue around
I apologize too 
For not recognizing the pain inside of you
I never lie to you, again
Last time had stress on my mind
Had a hard time believing 
That my girl could be genuine
It's different now, we ghetto lovers fo' real
I grab the wheel, you hold the steel
Teach me how to touch you where you like it the most
From now on, til we give up the ghost
Reunited, Baby

Break my cipha, I'll make it at you, slice you
Knife you, stab you, shank you, splat ya

Too many rappers is jealous, who be gassin' the fellows
Bunch of actors who never sold a crack in the ghetto
Went from Nas to The Esco, back to nasty
Clappin' that black heat
None of y'all are matchin' my level, I'm the general

Niggas salute me, bitches salute me
The block salute me, the hood salute me
You should salute me, they should salute me
So fuck who you are, I'm the motherfuckin' general

Niggas salute me, bitches salute me
The block salute me, the hood salute me
You should salute me, they should salute me
So fuck who you are, I'm the motherfuckin' general

Nowadays, I'm on some mack shit
But I used to be loyal to tax, cracks
The nigga that would soil in your jacks
Feed 'em with trays the size of light bulbs
Coke so bright, it shine like white gold

And the hoes like Joe way before this rap shit
Before the Versace floors and the Rolls to match it
Joe's a bastard, I sell pussy for cheap
Make my bitch walk the strip with no shoes on her feet

Don't front for me, you kids is not ballin'
If you is then why is your wiz on my dick like I'm Jordan'
Ties swollen for no man with bold plans
Sick of this rap shit, why' Listen to 'Slow Jams'

I'm a grown man, the talk of the strip
Niggas think I'm Kev Childs that way I boss the fifth
Dogs, you's a bitch, I'm here to bring you a muzzle
Saying I'm peepin', I'ma bring you a muzzle
Get the point, general

Niggas salute me, bitches salute me
The block salute me, the hood salute me
You should salute me, they should salute me
So fuck who you are, I'm the motherfuckin' general

Niggas salute me, bitches salute me
The block salute me, the hood salute me
You should salute me, they should salute me
So fuck who you are, I'm the motherfuckin' general

It's Cassidy, I get rock like a boat when you go fishin'
Ayo, listen, I'm the general like Tso Shim Shin
I'm so sick, you can tell by the expression on my face
That I'll get in that ass like preparation H

The weapon on the waist and I spray guns off
'Cause if it's beef, I'ma be on top of it like A-1 sauce
Pause, now who the truth' Me, who quick to shoot' Me
My four-fifth got kick like Bruce Lee

See, I'm a true G, hotter than soup be
Raw like sushi, you gotta salute me
You dudes see, I'll put in an order for you
I'll let the water boil, cook a quarter to the oil

I had it for sell but y'all fagots would tell
Go to jail and start singin' like Patti LaBelle
I ain't gon' back in a cell, you rat and you did
Fuck a vest, put a bulletproof hat on your head

When I'm clappin' the lead, I'll murder a nigga
And if he say he not the feds, then I'm servin' the nigga
I'm thirsty for the change, playin' games ain't a issue now
A bitch would give you AIDS nowadays if she kiss you now

I got that coke and that haze on my gristle now
We goin' to war, you gonna need more than a pistol now
They throwin' missiles 'round, you still tryin' to get a nine'
Uh, it's the last days, end of time

The terrorists jackin' planes, sendin' bombs to the Pentagon
They off the hook like intercoms
We just had a bad wintertime
So you know they gonna start to rob
And steal for a mil' when it's dinnertime

You still spendin' time focusin' on dumb shit
On the block smokin' but you broken on some bum shit
What the hell' You might as well put a suit and tie on
Jump in a casket and get ya die on",Salute Me,2002

But the dog is bigger, under stress
So unless you're wanting to bless to the chest
These slugs from his liver rest rest!
Or the pump'll put a hurt on a nigga
Dumb sex, motherfucker feeding dirt on a nigga
My hands stay dirty, cause I play dirty the mob way
You don't know? fuck it find out the hard
A nigga's job is never done
I handle my business how it come
And there's never been a one on one
Nor has there been a problem, I dissolve them
I'm like salt, lock it up
Hate to fall but never wreck his car
And it's my fault, keep nigga on point ducking down

Looking over my shoulder, cause it's colder than it was
And start shorty, because I'm a little older than 'cause
And the buzz from the saw, wit the chain to your brain
Will turn that big nigga to a fucking stain
That pain from the dirt makes the hurt go away for a minute
But I'm goin' die by it cause I'm like knee deep in it
And you motherfuckers wonder why I start shit
Cause when you look in my face you see that hard shit
Cause I done been to hell and back I ain't wit selling crack
I'd rather rob a nigga leave him wit a shell up in his back
On the real just to show proof, hit the G.W.B.
And blow the whole roof off the toll booth bitch ass nigga!

[Chorus]

When I crawl, leave a nigga sprawled out after I spoke em
I'll slit his throat, dick in the mud and let his blood choke em
Up north niggas get the pick stuck up in em
And in the streets bitches get the dick stuck up in em
My M.O. is man-slaughter kid
Cause on the reals I done wet up more motherfuckers than water did
Slid, cause I got to slide when the dirt is done
A homicide but they want me on the Murder 1
But as long as I got my gun, I'm aight
Stay outta sight while it's light, and then come out at night
To make moves again, stomp and bruise again
I know I'm going to hell cause I choose to sin
All my motherfucking life I been the Devil's advocate
Now niggas never even knew the devil had a kid
But he does and when you hear the buzz of the chainsaw
You'll know what I'll split your motherfucking brains for

The Queen Bee (Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?)

Ladies and Gentleman

It's the worlds famous, Lil' Kim, Queen Bee
I am who I am, you just can't change me
No matter what you do, you can't take the hood out me
People been around me for years, don't know shit about me
Dedicated, like Muslims makin' selat
People steady try to make me into somethin' I'm not
That's why I had to cut the grass, so I could see the snakes
Copped the house on the hill so I could see the lakes
What you thought? I'm a girl, couldn't make it alone
Time to turn the heat up and get back in the zone
One day my hairs orange, the next day it's green
The trendsetter's back on your TV screen

This is who I am (This is who I am)
This is what I be (This is what I be)

Oh, no, no, no, no (Oh, no, no, no, no)
No, no, no (No, no, no)

About five feet even, kinda small in the waist
Rap's sex symbol, real pretty in the face
So what I got even bigger titties than the lakes
Still a sophisticated lady with millions in the safe
Switch up flows like I switch up my clothes
More than Wilt Chamberlain switched up his hoes
I'm a profectionist, gotta stay on my toes
Anything goes when you play with the pro's
I got everybody rappin' about jewelry and cars
Lil' Kim give you a platinum sixteen bars
I'm the real thing, ya'll kareokee stars

No, no, no (No, no, no)

I'd rather be dead and rich than broke and livin'
Without rap, I probably woulda been sellin' dope in prison
With some Vera Wang khakis and Nolteychucks
Suckin' the warden's dick in the back of the bus
But God made me what I am today
So I say things ya'll afraid to say
Just 'cause you got a head start that don't make you strongest
He who burns last, burns the longest
Fuck what they say about me
Fact is I'm the legacy of B.I.G.
The Queen of New York, let's get this straight
I'm about to be elected mayor of 718

Know me from Down Bottom
Now I switch my cars
Got a house down bottom
If you want to come and cop them bricks you know Uptown got 'em
Tell your man be easy ma, he don't want no problem
I'm bout my money man, I got that country slang
Look at the way she shake that thing
But you plottin' on my bling
But we don't play them type of games around here
Keep the gray pound somewhere around here
Please don't let your shorty loose around here
Cause I'll take her lil' ass around there
Shorty booty bangin'
Tell me what you thinkin'

Let me guess ma, Capricorn ma?
Am I Wrong ma? (uh-uh)
What you sayin' who you bangin' who you slidin' wit
Pack your friend who you bringin' who she ridin' wit
Cause we ain't ready tryin' to stay around here
My thugs around cause there's too many clowns around here (Hey shorty)
We don't smoke that brown here
Strictly that green here, that the black green here (yeah)

Mommy put ya hands up, hush ya man up
Tryin' to play gorilla
My clips are bananas, so don't slip
I do what gangstas do, but don't get it confused
My floors mostly sand so you ain't gotta bring ya shoes
My crib is half house, half beach
Sit yo booty on this king size and see the sea
I'm a lil' freaky-o, I might lick ya toes
I got more zero's on my one's than Cheerio's
See your stilleto, shoes, your mac lip gloss

Double are what!
I got this part right here

From the start to the finish Imma bark on contenders
Wanna tarnish my image I can't promise forgiveness
See I was never like this my moms would never like this
And y'all was never like us that's why y'all never liked us
See I might take ya style flip it back make it crack
Sell a couple mil get some stacks here you go now take it back
I'm spittin lines of fire I'm in the line of fire
Designer attire makin me a sign of desire
I just rhyme to inspire ya favorite line supplier 
I run through fan signs and landmines the size of tires
How many minds inquire I got mines and acquired
Enough props to make y'all resign and retire

So if I turn and flee and run from what's in front of me
That won't make no sense at all
This for my dons and divas haters and non believers
They just tryin to deceive us like Judas dishonored Jesus
Why you tryin to critique this
Don't take kindness for weakness leave you behind the speakers
Body minus some pieces
You got records to sell I got records to break
You will never excel against me measure the rate

Annhialate and dominate and I ain't even
Tryin to wait

Wanna know what my slang bout they be like
Shut yo damn mouth

While you shootin the breeze I'm dancin with the wind
This is not ya ordinary my style sorta varies
Slaughter you than ya crew cause you know
The more the merry
You already know the outcome so how come
You doubt son I'm goin out by any means necessary Malcolm
Hiphop without Jin is like shootouts with guns
Churches without nuns bankers without funds
Smokin without lungs cities without slums

Swizz Beatz,"See, I can kinda recall a lil' ways back
Small, tryin' to ball, always been black
And my hair, I tried it all I even went flat
Had a lumpy curly top and all that crap, now
Just tryin' to be appreciated
Nappy headed brothers never had no ladies
And I hit the barber shop real quick
Had 'em give me lil' twist and it drove 'em crazy (crazy)
Then I couldn't get no job
'Cause corporate wouldn't hire no dreadlocks
Then I thought about my dogs from the block
Kinda understand why they chose to steal and rob
Was it the hair that got me this far
All these girls these cribs these cars?
I hate to say it but it seem so flawed
'Cause success didn't come till I cut it all off

Little girl with the press and curl
Age eight, I got a Jheri curl
Thirteen, and I got a relaxer
I was a source of so much laughter
At fifteen when it all broke off
Eighteen and went all natural
February, 2002
I went on and did what I had to do
Because it was time to change my life
To become the woman that I am inside
Ninety-seven dreadlocks all gone
I looked in the mirror for the first time and saw that

Hey (hey)
I am not my hair
I am not this skin
I am not your expectations, no (hey)
I am not my hair
I am not this skin
I am the soul that lives within

Good hair means curls and waves (no)
Bad hair means you look like a slave (no)
At the turn of the century
It's time for us to redefine who we be
You can shave it off like a South African beauty
Or get in on lock like Bob Marley
You can rock it straight like Oprah Winfrey
If it's not what's on your head, it's what's underneath, and say

Hey (hey)
I am not my hair
I am not this skin
I am not your expectations, no (hey)
I am not my hair
I am not this skin
I am the soul that lives within

Who cares if you don't like that?
With nothin' to lose, postin' with the wave cap
And the cops wanna harass 'cause I got waves
Ain't see nothin' like that in all my days
Man, you gotta change all these feelings
Steady judging one another by their appearance
Yes, India, I feel ya, girl
Now go ahead, talk to the rest of the world 'cause

(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Does the way I wear my hair make me a better person?
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Does the way I wear my hair make me a better friend? Oh
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Does the way I wear my hair determine my integrity?
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
I am expressing my creativity
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)

Breast cancer and chemotherapy
Took away her crownin' glory
She promised God if she was to survive
She would enjoy every day of her life, oh
On national television
Her diamond eyes are sparkling
Bald-headed like a full moon shining
Singing out to the whole wide world like, hey

Hey (hey)
I am not my hair
I am not this skin
I am not your expectations, no (hey)
I am not my hair

Lift up ya shirt, let me see ya bellybutton girl
You got a belly ring, show ya bellybutton girl
(I'm not impressed by the money and the bling
Show me respect and then I'll show you my belly ring)
Lift up ya shirt, let me see ya bellybutton girl
You got a belly ring, show ya bellybutton girl
(Boy you my type and I like to do my thing
Treat me right, I'll show you what's under my belly ring)

Ain't nothing funny bout this money I be touching girl
I get the cheese, if you need it, then it's nothing girl
You might not know me, but I know if we was fucking girl
You would get blazed like the haze I be puffing girl
Kissing and hugging girl, licking and sucking girl
Ya body is the truth and you cute as a button girl
And you know I sold rock and I be hustlin girl
The pot I got on my stove top is not stuffing girl
You might not think that I'm the one to put ya trust in girl
But I won't break ya heart for nothing, I ain't bluffing girl
I think you got a crush on me, I see you blushing girl
I got you tempted cause I'm smooth as David Ruffin girl

I'm the kid from the telly with R. Kelly man
And I'm a ass, I'm a titty, I'm a belly man
I play them low like when I'm sittin on Pirelli's man
I'm blowing up so they be blowing up my celly man
Doing they gully dance, showing they belly man
It can't be jam because they shake it like it's jelly man
And it's some girls that probably never even wanted one
Till they heard the song and then they went and got they stomach done
Ya belly ring on bling, let ya belly floss
Just go bezerk, lift up ya shirt, show ya belly off
It's eye candy for the guys and it's fly mami
And you might like it if you try, don't be shy mami

And I know it some women who don't have a belly ring
It's okay, ay, ay (okay, ay, ay)
Cause you can go to the store and get yourself a belly ring
Today, ay, ay (Today, ay, ay)
On the radio, the TV, even the press
Women get their bellybuttons pierced, even they breasts
You supposed to cloth yourself, not expose yourself
But when this song come on, they can't control theyself
They be doing they thizzle y'all, making it wiggle y'all
I got 'em shaking and bouncing it like the dribble y'all
You know the izzle y'all, I'm off the hizzle y'all
For shizzle my nizzle, I love my nigga Swizzle y'all
Cause he the cat that make the tracks, I'm the cat that's rapping
I'm back in action, and I'm bout to get it crack-a-lacking

And start spitting like I'm missing a tooth
You listening duke, I'm gripping the coupe, lifting the roof
Sip the orange juice mixed with the goose
Or shots of the yak I got gats that could lift up a moose
Stay with a biscuit to shoot like I'm Bishop in Juice
I get more bitches than Luke when I run the block
Fiends scream ""I Wanna Rock, I Wanna Rock Ock""
I'm right in the curb white and the herb
And I got a nice price on the birds you might could get served
You come with the doe I come with the blow
But if you don't come with the change I'm a come with them thangs
Run up on you with the gun in the dickie
The collar coat hold a hundred and fifty
You wanna get busy come get me I'll bury you cats
Cus I wife the knife and I marry my gat

Both of my wrists gleam and my fist just as mean
It's blue but it's see-through like Listerine

So go and get your team
And I'll get 'em all smoked like a stick a nicotine or a nick of green
And I don't talk to these hoes like I'm Mr. Bean
I just let 'em mop me off get a Mr. Clean
And I might pop her off if the chick is mean
I got some stories I can tell I'll sell a chick a dream
I'll let her sip a little liquor let her hit the green
Then I'm a unbutton her blouse and unzip her jeans
And merk that ass, hurt that ass
Cass show you how to work that ass
And I ain't with my boy Kells in the hotel no more
I'm on the strip making sells fish scale galore

I'm still acting a fool packing a tool
Went back to the dude before I was with the black and the jewels
I don't feel right if I ain't strapped with the tool
But give me a gat and I'm cool like the mac or the ooze
And I'll clap at you dudes I ain't scrapping you dudes
I'm kind of light and I ain't fighting I got ratchets to use
I'll have cats like ""Damn yo what happened to dude?""
Listen homey if I'm hungry you'll get jacked for your food
I'm back on the move, back on the grind
I'm a natural born hustler I just happened to rhyme
Who would of ever thought I'll be the cat to get signed
But life hard to predict the shit happen sometimes
Cats jacking my lines, taking my style
But there ain't no perpetrators aloud
If you die then you can't testify when I take it to trial
You can hate it I just take it and smile

Homey it's hard not to kill niggas, it's like a full time job
Not to pull out the steel and shove it in your grill
Young California got that mass appeal
I summons the hood, they get up in yo' ass for real
Knockout flow, Winky Wright jab for real
And all you niggas pussy, need Massengil
See I'm the gun-cocker, one-shotter, lift 'em off the ground
Chop 'em down, like a cantaloupe, my flow the antidote
Sick flow, it's so, motherfuckin' six-four
Your bitch know, hop in the back when you see Swizz hoe
This that, all you niggas get up off my dick so
I can cook crack on the track and watch it mix slow
Cocaine, my flow fire, call it propane

Where skinny niggas make buff niggas victims of that trey-pound
And gang-bangers is the sharpshooters, we don't need no rooftops
Just knock his ass down and take the money out his tube socks
West coast niggas is back on the map
If only for now until the next time I body a track
From the first clap I hurt rap, now watch the earth crack
Bring the hearse back, and take a lyrical dirt nap
I roll with the hardest niggas, make money with the smartest niggas
I ain't got time for you fuckin' artist niggas
Better shut your trap before you become a target nigga
Y'all army brats I'm the motherfuckin' sergeant nigga
Beauty pageant-ass niggas on the runway
(Boyz N The Hood) till they see the nigga in that red Hyundai
Blow his fuckin' back out, cause I'm the rap Stack-house

Let the critics ask questions, my album be the answer
These niggas let the rumors sit in they head like tumors
So I had to take 'em back, to toothbrush on the Pumas
Clean, mean, rappin' machine
Red rag hangin low in the back of my jeans
I black out like February, back out what's necessary
Oh-seven Bugatti with Jimmy Iovine's secretary
I'm runnin' the buildin', don't make me run in the buildin'
No this ain't the first time I had my gun in the buildin'
Walkin' past offices I see my son in the buildin'

Back seat Pakistan, I can just kill a man

And left the winter clothes in the dorm
I don't want a problem, it's too much flesh out
They want me to cock back and blow their chest out
See me in the yard with a Newport, stressed out
It's too damn hot to walk around here vest out
Feel me dog, make money or make a hit
Other than that, can't think of shit

Hey! I'm comin' the 4th quarter
So I'ma just give you the summer to tread water
Way they wrote it down in the paper it said slaughter
Found him in the tub with nothin' but red water
But anyway, back on track
Honey in the black on black, ass all fat
What up ma? You feel like winnin', feel like spinnin'?
Lil' Jimmy Chu footwear, antique denim
Shh, you do the math to that, six months
For these Louis and these jeans is a half a stack
What more could you ask than that?
Whoever got a problem get all of the desert and half the mac

Ruff Ryders (Ain't goin nowhere, 
Ain't hidin nowhere, ain't runnin nowhere) 

[Drag-On] 
Ya'll laughin, when we comin, we checkin the cabinets 
Body parts we baggin, we ain't comin for the crack 
We come to crack backs and ? over niggaz hair dew 
Spit rays, pop off see's and graze niggaz fades 
I creep in a Mustang, bust my heat in the rain 
Till they get a rust stain 
why'all niggaz heard of me, probably want to murder me 
I'll pull up on ya block and turn your white teeth burgundy 
Let's see some surgery 

[EVE] 
Watch the first lady as she rides 
Rougher than the rest of them bitches 
What it take for cats to hush they mouth 
This one official 
Come on clown prove it's still an issue 
Streets is ours, have ya homies weepin cause they miss you 
Thought it was a game when I said the dogs would get you 
Heard you fucked up cause E-V-E bit you 
Flex knows what the real is 
That's why he deal wit 
Ruff Ryders baby droppin bombs nigga feel this 

[Chorus] 

[Styles] 
Why ya'll braggin, I'm over here choppin and baggin 
And I don't want the drop coupe so I'm choppin the wagon 
Dark navy blue six speed, six air-bags 
Even if this shit crash, feel like Six Flags 
And ya'll niggaz can't block my shells 
When I'm in jail the C.O. don't lock my cell 
Before any rap group, we was the L.O.X. crooks 
I'll slap a hundred dollars on the whole blocks books 
And know the block shook, when I walk by 
Niggaz just like you they rather not look 
I inspired why'all niggaz to flow 
I'ma always get money so I admire ya'll niggas that blow 
Ask ya self who the nicest out right now 
Put your ice up lets get on the mic right now 
Clown, I'm the top cat where it stops at 
Where lightning and thunder at 
And why'all niggaz is under that 

[Jadakiss] 
If you runnin with the P. you gonna get your turn 
Tuck my gun while its hot to feel my dick hair burn 
Might come through the spot where the shottie and what 
Body to block and hot want to the Bacardi wit rocks 
I ain't never drive a bike but I ride on the back 
Rob wit a gat, shit I still ride wit my craps 
If you want to go to war we can tally it up 
Escalate and venally it up, what? 

[Chorus]  

[Sheek] 
If you like Sheek, you hold heat and no one know 
Bust yo' gun and leave the body where no one go 
I pack some shit for any type of situation 
Only time I don't pack heat is on vacation 
And that's the blow dryer next to the PlayStation 
I'm big but I use shit to kill you quick 
And I don't wrestle unless chicks do bad on my dick
Flex know I bring somethin hot to the spot 

[DMX] 
What would you rather have the ten you found or the five you earned 
Became a man at six cause at five you learned 
Don't take nothin for granted except death 
Man of the house cause you the last nigga left 
I see how it's going dizzy with the shit so we can blast a rhyme 
Hope the Lord got your soul cause your ass is mine 
Every time you turn around niggas know that I be right there 
East turned to West coast, cravin for the nightmare 
Don't give a fuck about what you sling 
Cause you ain't slingin that shit, or bringin that shit 
Up the hill, but you still singin that shit 
Talkin shit like you know what its like to walk this shit 
Get on some stalkin shit 
So you know what niggaz rule New York and shit 
I'm just thinkin all the business and how to handle ya'll niggaz 
All the families that I got lightin candles for niggaz 
Breathin revelence, grandmothers fallen out and need the sedatives 
Mom huggin the casket wishin that she raised a better kid

I get my paper on my block
I get my paper from my block
I get my paper all the time I keep tellin' you

Look if you deal coke and your still broke
Start grindin' more homes
Cause I'm a drug connoisseur homes
In the hood good jobs so hard the find like dinosaur bones
I'm tryi'na start shinin' more homes
Thats why I make em hurry up and buy
Like that china store homes
Cause they'ya give ya time for a dime or more stones
And tell it ain't ma twist I'm not that kinda boy homes
But a lotta niggas singin' like the commodore homes
I'm ridin' when its time for war homes
The chrome on my hip could flip a fully grown dinosaur homes
I'm the kinda boy known to split domes when I palm the Taurus
Or spray rounds that could lay down a tyrannosaurus
Ma mind like a thesaurus
I'ma shine regardless my brain a dictionary
Lames I'm quick to bury
I spit scriptures and put pictures on obituaries
So get your own sound
The hustlas home now

[Chorus: x3]

E'ry bar I write like a brick of that hard white
I've truly been blessed
This a gift from the lord Christ
So if you livin' the hard life you cant give back the hand you was delt
So play ya cards right
They say you ain't promised tomorrow right?
So I stay in the streets like a deer that stare in that car light
With the high beams on and the fog lights lit
I get my lean on
On some bars type shit
Until my cream gone and my bar like this
In my all white tee and my all white kicks
And I still toss the white on the strip
Thats why I floss like this
With my frost bite wrist cause we all quite rich
I love this life
I threw different color ice in my cross like swiss
And all I give brauds is hard type dick
Have 'em twirlin' they tongue
Yeah I know I got a girl and a son
But um, its a mans world and I'm as real as they come

[Chorus: x3]

I'm from a block where niggas get it poppin' at
Where kats is known for boxin' and poppin' gats
But you gotta aim low when you poppin' that
Cause that hot shit got kicked like a soccer match
I'm from where the m1s and the choppas at
Philli is where you could come to go gun shoppin' at
You rockin' plack
Got the chain with the watch to match 
You better watch ya back it'll be gone you ain't got yo gat
Kats'll jack ya,POP, he ain't got a strap
Kats'll rob ya mom if she got a stack
Cause niggas tryin'a get paid
And niggas ain't tryin'a get waves when they rockin' a stockin' cap
Where I'm at, they got gourmet pots of crack
And you will spend like 24 for a block of that
My niggas tryin'a get the cheese but no not to rat
I'm from a block where snitchin' ain't a option at

They say the rap game remind 'em of the crack game
That's why they money go quicker than a crack high
My money stacked high; how high? Shaq high
Yao high; that's why yours is Bow Wow high
You lookin' at your new hustle like your last hustle
Was looked at as Russell in my past hustle
Shorty work it; she be on her ass hustle
She make it clap; she know how to work them ass muscles
Fast rush you, then back to the money
They say I'm frontin', can't turn my back to the money
And, truthfully, you're cool, but I'm attracted to money
So why don't cha turn your back to the money, and let it shake?
I'm lovin' how you move that smooth; you let it snake
But players don't chase at it, baby, we let it make
Bet it make sense when you make them dollars
I ain't gotta make them move, but I make them holla
This my year, but y'all can help me celebrate
I'm nine-fifteen, that means I'm hella straight
Swizz stacks, Just Blaze bucks
I'm back for my money; it's just they luck

Every block had a stray dog with rabies
Feens threw away their crack babies

And I shoot any n- run up on me
And for 2 years my momma looking for me
Crying running up on other kids
Thinking it's me
By now I ain't got no heart
N- I'm a gang member
Suited up and ready to start

Fighting with my weak hand
Driven to distraction

Trying to repair it

And Weezy is a can do
And we are crack, smack

Somebody bring me back some money please

Hov on the that new shit, niggas like how come?
Niggas want my old shit, buy my old album
Niggas stuck on stupid, I gotta keep it moving
Niggas make the same shit, me I make the blueprint
Came in the Range, Hopped out the Lexus
Every year since, I've been on that next shit
Traded in a gold for the platinum Rolex's
Now a niggas wrist match the status of my records
Used to rock a throwback, balling on the corner
Now I rock a teller suit, looking like a owner
No I'm not a Jonas, brother I'm a grown up
No I'm not a virgin, I use my cojones
I moved onward, the only direction
Can't be scared to fail, search and perfection
Gotta keep it fresh girl even when we sexing
But don't be mad at him when it's on to the next one

Freeze (yeah)
Somebody bring me back some money please.

[Chorus]

Fuck a throwback jersey, 'cause we on to the next one
And fuck that auto-tune, cause we on
And niggas don't be mad cause it's all about progression
Loiterers should be arrested.
I used to drink Cristal them fuckers racist,
So I switched gold bottles onto that spaceship.
You gon' have another drink or are you just gonna babysit
On to the next one, somebody call the waitress
Baby I'm a boss, I don't know what they do
I don't get dropped, I drop the label
World can't hold me, too much ambition
Always knew it be like this when I was in the kitchen.
Niggas in the same spot, me I'm dodging rain drops
Meaning I'm on vacay, chilling on this big yacht,
Yeah I got on flip flops, white Louie boat shoes
Y'all should grow the fuck-up, come here let me coach you

Freeze (yeah)
Somebody bring me back some money please.

[Chorus]

Big Pimping in the house now, 
Bought the land tore the motherfucking house down.
Bought the car, tore the motherfucking roof off.
Ride clean, I don't even take the shoes off.
Bought the Jeep, tore the motherfucking doors off.
Foot out that bitch, ride that shit like a skateboard.
Navigation on tryin' to find my next thrill,
Feelin' myself I don't even need an x pill,
Can't chill but my neck will,
Haters really gon' be mad off my next deal,
Uh, I don't know why they really worry 'bout my pockets,
Meanwhile I had Oprah chillin' in the projects,
Had her out in Bed Stuy chillin' on the steps,
Drinking quarter waters I gotta be the best,
M-J at Summerjam, Obama on the text,
Y'all should be afraid of what I'm gonna do next.
Hold up

Freeze (yeah)
Somebody bring me back some money please.

Now, Trap Muzik is, you know, a dope boy's philosophy
A former trap nigga's experiences and adventures
Said to music
But not just, when he cracking a key or when he 
Cooking the work or when he sell it and get busted
We know all that
What happen when he go on vacation, you know
How is that
What happen when he fall in love?
Or have his first child
All we want to cover all those bases because dope boys go through many, many things
Just because it's trap music, don't mean it got to be one dimensional

Is there any room for me to join them

Well if there's not I don't care cause I think I'm already there
I know I never told you how much our love meant
Back when you were the country and I was president
I know I probably should have but I never realized
That maybe we would grow up and move our separate ways

Back in the day, me and my nigga SwizZz was always in grind mode
Reppin' that 818 was just like walkin' that tightrope
We've seen rappers come and go and get lost in this cycle
So we had to fuckin' make sure we left all of your minds blown
SwizZz? He told me 'bout his brother Damien sayin' that he could create a structure for us
We're guaranteed to make a win
I said I'm in, let the games begin

Made an album so raw the way you just had to get it, every track explicit
I figured those of you who was in love with rap would listen
And tell your parents that it's the one gift they should grab for Christmas
Then I blew up way faster than what I had predicted
It's like magic, isn't it, they love my language and graphic image
Some people thought Ruthless put me into a bad position
But I over came it and outshined 'em, I'm back up in it
2011, went on a nation wide tour
Came back and dropped that Ill Mind 4
That put me in a cool place, swiped up a million views in a few days
I celebrated inside of swimming pools sippin' Kool Aid

I stumbled across this one nigga, reminded me of a young Pac (right)
I asked Dame if he heard of Dizzy he said, ""Come on Hop
I been bumpin' his shit before you, bruh, his songs hot.""
If he had that push, then so many doors'll become unlocked
He said we should sign him, I said that's a long shot
We flew him to Denver to see our show and said you fuck with this shit?
He said, ""Shit nigga, yiggity yamp, I'm up in this bitch.""
A few months later, one of the homies had stopped me
Asked if I had seen this raunchy, zombie filled, godly video, that's beyond beast
I said, ""probably, I don't know, who the fuck you speakin 'bout?""
He showed me Skitzo by Jarren Benton, I started freakin' out!
I'm like, oh shit! I had to show SwizZz
And Dame and they both flipped, it's a trip, this nigga's so sick!
We had to put him on quick and blow this nigga up
Now we got a serious squad, the truth, it is nuts

Yo, I took the college route to figure out my path in life
Romp the UCI and that lead me right back behind the mic
I tried to make my dad proud, brother got his MBA
While I was wildin', takin' random classes tryna find my way
Junior year, I had to bounce not to blindly chasin' dream
Calculated riffs, I knew that I devised a perfect scheme
Hop was gazin' at the moonlight, I just hit the valley scene
Dame got rocked by the recession, then we formed the fuckin' team
F-U-N-K-V-O-L-U-M-E, nigga
Seven years into this shit, somehow we're only gettin' bigger
And we're just now gonna start the shit, I've been up out the picture
Dizzy, Hop, Jarren, and Hoppa stay confident I deliver
So I'm grateful for the chance and the position that I'm placed

So I perfected the work of anger release my guillotine, 
And finalize my thesis of the effects of stricken nicotine 
On the human frame with an iron depleted blood stream,

Buy my ends two black gloves in the art of piano wire.

I take them down one at a time, do my crime and put in work, 
You shouldn't jerk this chain, you can't handle the downpour,

From high as an intense discription
Of why the valkyrie fly, calculate
The circumference of the sky for future reference
Measure it all from bird's eye to add some fuel to my furnace
To those who scratch the surface and lace signs of plotonus
Expected to strown trajectory of David's sling to Goliath
Nor abundance of nouses accommodate my body weight

Instruments of vine and I'll
Dine the road of chrisis if it
Crosses over to the land of radiogiants 
Founded by po-pyus and pontious pilots

Encourage the cutting of Marionette by bayonette
To escape the twin maker's cabinet

Prepare the barricades for the running of the ramping
While some try to change or exist to its wash cloth soaked in chlorine

Evil spirits lurking behind picket fences
Embarking darker images and skeletal remains
Cold hearted soldier with ice in his veins
I'm twice as insane

From confrontation, total annihilation
Serenating my princess, gut renching terror

If I can't escape than I'll die in my sleep
Cause the cliff is to steep and the waters to deep

Chorus: Mad Child & Prevail

Sound familiar bad dreams can kill ya
Deeper the sleep the realer man I feel ya
Bad dreams sad scenes and fear
You don't want to have to wake up here
Bad dreams you don't want to have to wake up here
Bad dreams sad scenes and fear
you don't want to have to wake up here
Bad Dreams
you don't want to have to wake up here

[Mad Child:]
I'm running down a hall with one wall of flames
With friends I've never seen in my life with strange names
Sound familiar bad dreams can kill ya
Pains not what it seems cold stares and sudden screams
I get in fights every night as I'm reflecting
Throwing punches fast hard as I can but not connecting
There protected by a force field locked in an engagement
Until I see the colour red when pounding heads into the pavement
Caught up in a chase scene or working on a plan
Sometimes I'm falling and I have to wake up before I land
Lots of doors to open afraid what I might find
My girlfriend getting fucked with eight more guys in line
can't wait to rise and shine when ill thoughts are provoked
My girlfriends right beside me getting choked
In real life plus I heard it could get worse
So much for walking in my sleep that's close to murder in the first

Chorus: Mad Child & Prevail

Sound familiar bad dreams can kill ya
Deeper the sleep the realer man I feel ya
Bad dreams sad scenes and fear
You don't want to have to wake up here
Bad dreams you don't want to have to wake up here
Bad dreams sad scenes and fear
you don't want to have to wake up here
Bad Dreams
you don't want to have to wake up here

[Prevail]
They say that most people can only dream in black and white
That's why he packs a knife and only reappears at night
I pray for the light to turn him back to stone
And shine bright enough so I can find my way home

[Mad Child]
Watching myself from above and just behind
Like I'm controlling video games inside my mind
Be careful what you dream for because its right there
Sometimes day dreams turn into nightmares

[Prevail]
I've prepared the chair
electricity rumbles through the air
You don't want to have to wake up here
Its cold in the morning
Breath the eternal frost of our dawning

[Mad Child]
Plus its dark and death
With slight hints of ???
So cold I'm spitting icicles
Rip right through the flesh
Smoke forms with every breath
The sound of children screaming
Pinch my self I have to wake up
Afraid of dreaming

Chorus: Mad Child & Prevail

Sound familiar bad dreams can kill ya
Deeper the sleep the realer man I feel ya
Bad dreams sad scenes and fear
You don't want to have to wake up here
Bad dreams you don't want to have to wake up here
Bad dreams sad scenes and fear
you don't want to have to wake up here

Positive feedback, jeans still sagged
Hands still knocked, Prevails gets props
The same as always rising to the top

With the sworm of excitement
Fighting form we invite criticism
Rhyme shine like prism
Spit flames we see in 3D vision
Even my people play CD in prison

I see the global orbits of time warps and forests of darkness before us
Orchids turnin' grey from what I bring out of my medical tray
Perpetuate Prevail Wonder and the alphabet is the predator and the prey
Don't let 'em walk away, broken in the bone yard, smokin' in the boys room
Spoken in the pattern that consumes you like a vacuum
The war ship I dock is the property of His Worship,
It's awkward when we talk about morbid conditions,
Vividly described from this side of the lie detector
Siphon nectar from the blossom, natural toxin, approach with caution
Blow flames in blue light they dance on the oxygen
Lost again in space? Allow us to demonstrate how it all generates
From motors to engines, machine guns to hand grenades, renegades of vengeance

An' sip on Bombay Sapphire, I drink Jack Daniels

I'm thinking man, we don't always have to talk about
dungeons and dragons all the time, you know?
We don't have to make things so complicated (no doubt)
Let's take this back and show them how we can do this too (word)

Deep, I'm using canyons you can't get by the cannon (no way)
Season veterans, the hawk has landed
Toxic tandem, the docotorum of mad men
The planet of apes is now a main attraction
How does it happen? If I knew I'd tell ya
They'd probably try to say I worshiped devils in the cellar
It's just a slight of hand, like Penn and Teller
The mighty dollar, is taller than the scholar
Ask your neighbourhood martyr about the fire starter
People are driven to buildings when I let it out my system
Built my the hands of man and women
Thinking of quitting? Now's the time
There's more job opportunites at the back of the line
Applications, and registrations
Feels more like an investigation
Now how's that for a demonstration

Series of events makes the heart grow colder
Started off with two, now we got mad soldiers
Battle Axe warriors, bitch, I thought I told ya

Spit venom over cobra, hatched in October
Libra scorpion is taking over
Still the silver server, I ain't trippin on nova
Introducin' Madchild, ladies and gentleman
Lets give a big round of applause for adrenalin
You ain't right, I'ma fucking phantom at night
That wears a mask by day, with a temper tantrum
Don't light my fuse, 'cause if this dynamite blows up in your face
There won't be no one left to clean up the place

Temporary relief for the hopeless

Prisons that are made by the minds of lethals
Truly blind, it confines all people

Of course I'm second guessin' cause life is just a question
Keep your suggestions, we ain't hearin' you guys
My name is Madchild I put the fear in your eyes

Grey skies, disguise my chariot
I've arrived to mesmerize the arrogant
Clear the area, and change the false
Pathetic speakers that lead the lost

We feed the need to work and conquer at all costs
Underground so there ain't nothing to fall off
Never spoke soft, so what if we get broke
We ain't the type of people that's meant to make a joke of

Yo, I'm talking about 
Temptation things that run through your head
Like I wonder what my friend's girlfriends like in bed
Yo, I bet sometimes she thinks of me instead
Greed, That has to do with more than you need
Sin, That's usually where temptation leads
Turning into an addiction in an instant, take heed
Feeding off your ego, cash confusion and sex
That's why, like, every eight months
You end up back with your ex
For a couple days, and then remember 
Why it wasn't meant to be
Go your separate ways and think 
I wonder what got into me
You're done, but then another 
Eight months comes around eventually
Vicious circle, I've done some things 
That aren't worth mentioning
Temptation, made me do some things I regret
Easy to fall into, but hard to forget
Use to put the blame on others
But that's a bunch of nonsense
Now I try to focus and 
Just listen to my conscience

[Prevail]
Yo, I'm talking about
Temptation and its relation to the human nation
The obvious, money, drugs, sexual frustration
How else can you explain public funding drain
The escalating murder rate and the climb to fame
It makes men touch parts that are not to be
It makes women clutch parts that are a part of me
So all that surface level services a day-to-day
An ongoing basis in desire and display
The first sensation recognized by script
We can't detach ourselves from it once we get into it
And why would we it feels better with the shadows closer
Comfortable feeling of comparing yours to overdose
Sometimes innocent and other times consequential
9 out of the ten times dun it's purely confidential
Harder to handle when your crews talking in your ear
Until you learn to abstain it draws near

Eager to be mute so you can inherit the heater

The grace for words of doom to pick my verse to be convict

I stand the grounds in colours of glass and Sunday Mass 
So I ask who plays the lead role of darkness in my cast?

Embark on my feat of neuroscience's discoveries
Acid on your brain makes the holes seem lovely
And you thought I couldn't rock this way?
You thought wrong, partner, my thought displays
The most caustic array that I bring when I choose it
Fuck when you wanna see me use it.
Red Dragon

Unbelievable, under duress

I'm not easily amused,
I snap when the fuse blows
Alligator trap door, crumbs on the fool's flo(or)
Delta brain of an unstable genius
Flies in your face when the gun's safety freezes.
Run hasty to quicken your suffering,
Grizzly react, when you gasp, they'll be busting in.
Get down, with no buffer zone
Buffering's useless just leave what you suffer whole
Buffalo's roam, the bison's stampede
Icing on the cake is the moment when you see
The scorpion chains, and the fire from the nostril
Hostile, exotic, colossal
Red Dragon

Unbelievable, under duress

My voice resonates, and ignore these featherweights
Resonates, pound up with this acid taste
Resuscitate the double horn side of me
Colliding with tusk, and make the harm bodily
Idle hands never, but whatever, my workshop's still hot
Algorithms, Superior skill shots
Mathematician, its half past sufficient
You grab-ass is wishin'
That you had another mission
In mind
Instead of trying to fuck with mine
Underestimatin' is half of the crime
The rapid supply of my graphic design
Can fool the unwary,
Put a snap in your spine
Don't be sorry, you just findin' out
Chop your neck off, motherfucka' now you really beside yourself
Cyber mouse
This is more tangible than keypads
You ain't so tough with the knee pads.

Off my rocker of Red Bull and vodka
Provocatively, walking like you're talking to me
Branded outlandish, triple decker stress sandwich
It's an ambush, turn out back to canvas
Ain't it the art words, painted with pain in my heart
New york to L.A., Yonge street to Robson
We get the job done and rob with tracks on

Live in effect to such, graze the edge of the metal
Raise taste, game face, first place, the rebel
In the cage with the lions, engage with the giants
Stars with temper, red october, prev the cobra

Girls shake it down, girls shake it down, line it up
Come to your town, come to your town, tear it up
Once y'all get down, y'all staying down, where's the love

Don't be shocked we made it, Mad Child rocks the greatest
When I'm intoxicated, got locked, we waited
And invaded and stated the tactics activated
Can't hate it, you play the track and tax infatuated it
Fatal attraction, won't stop 'til I'm platinum

The curb to the club, heavy hitting like a crowbar

Swollen Members,"[Chorus]
We gonna rock the whole crowd
Come to your town, Smash the door down
Trash the whole room
Kick the walls in, night to morning
Then we do it again, its adrenaline

[Verse 1: Prevail]
What we spit, beautiful and grotesque
Swim with us in the abyss to the deep depths, take a deep breath
Strike your lungs like a deadly pathogen, let the assassins in
Loss of oxygen leads to hospitals, loss of optical and audio optional
But not optimal, octagonal, box you in stronger than oxen friend
Accidents happen I'm a phenomenon
Looking at me is like staring at the ring too long, you have seven days
Witness one of the greatest efforts we've ever made
I'm a heavyweight swinging like Butterbean
I'm a cut you clean, like a sub machine
Gun and run its fun to chase someone in space the shots I pop a top a bass drum

[Chorus] - 2X

[Verse 1: MadChild]
You better believe I got a knife up my sleeve
Tell your buddies you ain't leaving 'til you bloody and cleaved
Then by the glory of a warriors code
I'm a destroyer roll with a Bavarian heart
I'm territorial, wish I could look the door
Aggressive localism with my dogs of war
Small man's complex you only get torn apart
MadChild kinda like Napoleon Bonaparte
Fornicate with porn stars, sluts, and strippers
But only on the internet but what's the difference
Cause everything's a memory once it's done
I can be my worst enemy just for fun
We urban guerillas, got friends with turbans that's killers
We go from town to town burn and pillage your village
I'm merely concealing a weapon kept inside of my brain
That's why I'm insane, desire and pain, fire and rain
Sexy beast with an extra piece of ecstasy
So this can work effectively
Connect with me, we'll have a chain reaction
I'm playing the same game, I'm the main attraction

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Moka Only]
I'm carcinogenic; my chemistry's a little bit off
You tend to be a little bit soft
Well I'm off on my tangent, detective agent
Lieutenant who's medicine you left with abrasions
Face the day like a vacation chasing
Fun, sun, and money then its back to the basement
Feels good taking it back to the basics
Like when I was hungry run around in my Asics
S & M was like the new cool band
That everybody be buzzing about at new stands
Who's then, you want to know, a lose cannon man
And it began with the tapes moving hand-in-hand
I'm writing under chandeliers
Something strange going on like langdaliers
This is one of them songs you can bang for years
Adrenaline through your heart we smash the unaware

Swollen Members,"[Chorus]
Nuclear power, you can feel how we're changin' up the game, 
Things won't be the same after we're done with it, 
We're hollerin' at you all like, ""Come get it!""
Bah bum bum Bah bum bum

When the roof comes tumblin' down, 
You know we're the cause of that
I'm a go down in history as some kind of alien rhymer
Who blew up the planet then left in a space liner
An' took all the bitches with him and then hit 'em
My man Nucleus provided this dumb rhythm
Dumb meanin' good, not dumb meanin' stupid
Y'all don't believe it, you can come see me do it
I'm true for my true friends, that's all there is to it
I say what the fuck I feel, get used to it
Ah it's an incredible game, 
I got love for my partners we're never the same
Ooh, sometimes I'm wylin' out, 
Set the buildin' on fire then you're filin' out
An then, we can turn it into a block party
Get your drinks on, when you call the cops on me

[Chorus]

I keep a ton of 'em runnin' like mascara
Number one in the last era
Now that's terror, you should call me the crypt keeper
Smoke a green reefer with the Grim Reaper
The kind of rapper you should keep in your household
Turn up the heat 'cause everything out my mouth cold
I'm a ball of ice and rock, 
Hurlin' words at a speed that's unorthodox
Clashin' worlds, Pandora's Box, 
Burning herb, 20 past 4 o'clock
Turn my cell mates loose, all hell breaks loose
Hit you from above and put some shells on your roof
Comin' to move, run through obstacles, 
Retrospect, laser opticals
Seven Nation Armies couldn't hold me back
When I swing a battle axe, I'm a make a skull crack

[Chorus]

Ain't no holdin' us back, like crack addicts
Tell your whole camp to pack up, I'm back at it
As a matter of fact, I'm strapped with raps for combat
Full contact, you don't want that
Put you in a head lock, twist your arm back
Rip up your throw back, snatch your chains
Gotta lot of great friends, but I act so strange
I wonder if it's anything to do with the fame
I wonder how many of them would like to ruin my name
Careful what you wish for, it might come true
Then every move you make they're like ""Can I come too?""
An' everyone you meet's like ""How can I join you?""
I ain't pretendin' that it's not strenuous
My girlfriend's jealous and my best friend's envious
Stay focused, please remember this:
Keep friends close, but with enemies I'm friendliest",Block Party,2003

ROCK, we're the heaviest
STOP, or you're gonna get
CAUGHT, cause we never rest, drop this on ya
We're the heaviest, you would never want to
Talk shit cause we come back to haunt ya

I rock heavy like a 70's icon
Led Zeppelin - Stairway to Heaven, my mind's gone
Even though I only did acid twice
My rap's a vice; your head's in it ask the price
For you to be released and me to be happy
With all of your suffering I'm brutally crafty
Coming up with the best selections
To get inside of you like I'm a chest infection
Your best protection is to get down and drown
Remember that the Members don't clown around
I'm found downtown with rolls of cash
My passion is smashing you disposable cats I'm old fashion
With swift abilities to lift and drop
And ambulant skill plus whip and chop
I dump on a chump and punk ya assoc ass
I'm done with rap, now I'm prepared to cash in


Ayo, I'm kick ass thick as a brick you bitch ass
Quick on the draw I come equipped with a pick axe
Rock solid, you cock-a-holics, I'm not gon frolic any longer
Cause my crew's much stronger
Donkey Kong stomp, Pac-Man chomp
Attacking competition I'm back in my position
Pop off with the must stop opposition
You have to listen cause mad division of beauty and grace
See what I do to your face, might be me, might be my friends
I might need an alibi it all depends
And I don't give a fuck if you don't like it, suck this
I'm a small giant, that's trying, dying to find success
You look upset stupid fuckhead
I'm locked, stocked, and loaded the most devoted
I'm a keep bringing the pain 'til your brains exploded
I'm motivated, voted and rated as one of the greatest
One of the most loved and hated and still haven't made it
Ya know?


I'm addicted to speed but not the drug
I lead by example my breed can hunt
Seen enough mayhem, step into the A.M
Weapons of contention for any given occasion
I attack with Battleaxe Warriors from the armory
Some of us kill you mentally; some of us hurt you vitally (Heavy)
A miracle of modern science
With the naturally passionate carnivorous diet (Heavy)
We're an anomaly, not a novelty

I possess more power then the Marvel universe
You understand now but you all looked startled at first
We don't play your game we make up are own rules
I'm runnin up on full strength to pick up a phone booth
Throw it right at you that and I'm tattood
Voice deeper then Ab Rude when I'm in a bad mood
This is my neighborhood a place you never could
Get over its over for you you'd run if you knew what was good
For your health I ain't huntin for no one else
And there's no one else here so you can quit yellin for help
It's like the house of 1000 corpses -
For some it's hideous to me it's gorgeous

Now spark ya things and make a flame
tonight we goin do it like we all insane
pyromaniacs burn this bitch

Watch! while I knock your socks off
I'm just here to make something abnoxious pop off

so be alert while I work you can learn from me
yea I smoke cigarettes and ???

I don't rub solders ??
Pop ex and next drink booze and tingle
I just do enough so the clubs can sing to
my song tellin me that I love your single
I love you I'm single no you don't
its just my pockets jingle I know you want
you want keys and g's and all the illy things
but slow your role ma 'cause I fund a million things

[Prevail]
There's no one behind you, there's no one beside you
There's no one besides you, you know as well as I do
There's no voice inside you, that shadow isn't moving
You must be losing to confusion having illusions
Still you want to prove it, paranoia
That someone might be coming for you, no ones trying to kill you stupid
There's no Norman Bates, peeking in your window
There's no Patrick Bateman trying to pick you up in limos
You pop another pill, to try and calm your nerves
But prescriptions make the descriptions a lot worse
You seeing red bursts, and then your head hurts
You should have checked under the bed first
Crawling on all fours, locking all the doors
You must have flown over the cuckoos nest and lost your course
I thought I told ya, don't let that shit control ya
'Cause paranoia will destroy ya just a lesson for ya

[Chorus]

[Moka Only]
When your mind is acting wild
And you swear you're insane
Can't nothing help you out
Of this trap you're in
You don't know which way to turn
And your head is in pain
Can't nothing help you out
Of this insanity

[Moka Only]
Yo it's paranoia in your brain cell
You think the world's looking at you but you can't tell
You need to find yourself a hobby or something and stop frontin'
Nobody's out to get you, nobody wants nothing
I think you got a chemical imbalance
When there's silence, you swear you hear talking and sirens
Maybe it's a different environment that you need
But whatever it is, your mind's dying to be free
You're trying to perceive with the usual procedures
Your chest's feeling tight; you think you're having seizures
Maybe you're just trying to hard to fit in
You need to let that shit go and get counseling my friend

[Chorus]

[Talking]
Never ends
That's what it is man
I'm losing my head
My mind is spinning man
I'm racing
I gotta unwind
It doesn't stop man

[Moka Only]
The paranoia never ends

[Talking]
It never ends
I'm afraid of what I might do man
It's in my head
I might need to check myself
It's in my mind
I might do some fucking crazy shit

[Moka Only]
The paranoia never ends

[Talking]
Never ends
Somebody needs to help me
Talk to me man I need help
I don't think I can handle this

Pump, pump, pump, pump it up, but don't turn us down
New Shit!
Swollen... new sheriff's in town

[Verse 1: MadChild]
Bout to show you something brand new
I ain't fronting but there ain't nothing I can't do
Listen man I'm telling you, you can too
Man you got no idea what the heck it took to get me here
I'm talking big hockey bags dragged back and forth
Bring it down South and get more from back up North
So I can stack up more and ? with force
26 inch rims, Cadillac of course
Now that I'm single this shit takes practice
Everyday a new attractive actress on my mattress
Stress relief, I'm a basket case
Give me a six-pack breast implants and a plastic face
Ass banging with them stupid thighs
I like my girls petite and super sized
I got love man that shit's real
I just got to take a few more laps around the field

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Moka Only]
You bout to know me in a big way
Yo, it's Moka Only, the name that all the kids say
Hey, I hope you know the game is in for a change
You love me cause I'm always known to spit strange
I get strange with it plus I get change
Enough to cop the H2 and the Range
Player I don't hate you or the game
y'all hate yourself because you play the same
I mean fuck around its time to change the rules up
y'all can still move your ass we got the new stuff
It's evidence on the track you know the crew, what?
Swollen super extra like my new truck
The 26 inch spinners the don't rub
Making all the jaws drop outside the club
I know you want to sing along do it up
But you got to spread the word tell them who you love

[Chorus]
The crew is called Swollen, remember the name
The heat that we holding, the Members spit flames

[Verse 3: Prevail]
Yo its unfair to put us in the same class
Before the ice melts I drain the whole glass
Nothing but fumes are left, I'm off and half-cocked talking under my breath
Girls in the bathroom perfuming their chest
So when they walk through the club ?damn she's fresh?
They shit off the wall like zero gravity
We hit you all we don't spare no casualties
Glasses clink, asses shake some chick wearing pink rocking boots made of snake
Cop this disc and tell the disc jock to let this rock til its two on his wrist watch
There's a new sheriff in town, don't make my pistol whistle like sweet Georgia Brown
We got this song stuck in your ear
With the sound so original there's nothing to clear

I'm a polite psycho, it's a full out cycle
Of a trifle life, cops can suck my cock if they don't like us
I hang around prospects strikers bikers
Cruel in a duel, a bull fueled with nitrous
Oxide thoughts fly by like a rock slide
Not a far cry from a glorified barfly
Horrified when you hear this warrior's war cry
Four out of five dentists recommend that you support Swollen Members
Get it?  People get their teeth knocked in
But some of them will get dentures don't keep talkin'
While they sleep walkin', I'm always on their mind
Stressed 'cause I'm successful and on the grind
Look no one's secretly behind or under this
Its independent bitch I funded it
Does that answer your fucking question? No one owns our shit but us
This is independent man, don't worry who I hang out with man
Just mind your own fucking business

You can't even control what's really on my mind
Shut your mouth mind your business
You can't even control what's really on my mind
Shut your mouth mind your business

I'm a juggernaut, you're not, you don't want it
And you don't want us to rock your knot
You don't call us if you got some thoughts
You just call us to rock the spot, demolish and pop your top
So whassup?  I don't do shit to mock you dawg
You doin' that by yourself cause you not too hot
Now the fat cats run around and copy each other like CD-R's
We don't, 'cause we be stars
See these scars?  They didn't appear by themselves
On my knuckles cause motherfuckers wouldn't keep to themselves
When I was younger always havin' to defend myself
I was out there doin' it with nobody else
Until I met a couple cats, set a couple raps
Got a plan together how to get a couple snaps
Flashback to now, we got a whole operation
But wouldn't if we didn't have a whole lot of patience

[Repeat: x4]
You can't even absorb what's really on my mind
Shut your mouth mind your business

Well you trippin' if you think I'm gonna sit on this couch
And tell this shrink what my deeply rooted problems about
The words out my mouth like acts of vengeance
From the blackest dungeons in a mass abundance
We move together like shadows and figures
We strike when we like, with a mind like the Gravediggaz
Painted pictures and still photography
Movin' images, reverse psychology
You should here what they call me when I leave the cypher
A nut case, a coo coo, a loo or cypher
When I talk on the beat, hot hot heat
Shotgun track meet please come compete
One lap to go before the cartridge blow
Hot headed and dreaded with an incredible arsenal
I kick back and witted in record time
And who'd a thought I'd have a lot of this shit locked in my mind

Suck my dick and here's a nut-sac to swallow
Want'a get close, personal and intimate?
Listen, kid I'm a whole different instrument
Mental, I'm not sentimental, I'm intricate

Stomped like a facist, this is my advantage

Molten ashes, fire and brimstone

You're fuckin' with the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

Got a need to be stable and make profit
Net cash, flip it and triple it, watch this
Plus, what good is the dough if you can't blow it?
What good is the gold if you stay below it?
Fools talk it when they ain't got it
Come out your wallet if you really ballin'
But if you 'bout it then you won't be solid
Come off it, y'all I'm off the wall
I'm on the ball, while you on the balls gettin' off
Got a whole line of products I'm addicted to
I still walk the same walk but a different shoe
It's more comfortable and my whole clique is too

Hop into my truck get stopped by a cop car (woop, woop)
How does this suppose to get
seems like the police, they don't like my associates
We some monsters is concert
Drunk in the middle of the club like ""Who wants it!?""
Mass appeal with massive whips, bling-bling
Drunk with a belt buckle in the motorcycle ring king (?)
Brand new breed creep for vengeance
Bad muscle car with TV's and chromed out engines
Fucking models and smashing glass bottles
Full blown, no helmet, full throttle
Rein stone cowboy desperado
Underground to winning the rap lotto

I was just broke before its more fun being rich

I like so far, dancing with no bra
Show me where them hands are, reaching for my keys
Its cool we can roll we do everything in three's
Four go with them, two come with me
Pound it like a drum see how fun it can be
Got pull like a monster truck, at the crib
Do watch the fuck this is life live it up
Case closed but there's more for later
Pushing her buttons like Space Invaders
My whole pack is tattooed in black like villains
We can bounce tonight but tomorrow don't catch feelings

Don't you love it when a plan comes together

We coming through rolling on rims bigger than bus wheels
And plus skill that's a total package
You scared like airplanes and exploding (?)
That's the size of the damage we do, no amateur crew
Taking care of business like a manager do
Hey! Rhymes knowing how I'm so fantastic
When I bend it and smack it, just ask the last chick
The beat will knock them like a brick to the head

It goes:cracked halo horns on my helmet
Little doll crawl in cherry red velvet
Burning Man in the house of charm
Chemical to the mouth but not to the arm
My tastes spinning out of control
Your face two eyes with a whole
Suicide watch, king of the strippers
Glorified hookers smash your glass slippers
Nothing can tempt me, everyone empty
I get high on the road when they let me
Trade craftwork off exotic substance
Some want to carve out my heart still love this
I'm trying to hurt myself, still smoking
But I'm a afraid of blood won't cut my wrist open
Told you that I loved you, I was just joking
You can't hurt my heart it's been broken

You can see me on the top you can see when we drop
You can meet me on the block, we'll stop and talk
We do not get thrown we don't stop
Whether or not we up on top, we still rock
You can see me back on top you can see me when we stop
You can feel it when we rock, we got shit locked
We do not get cold we feel hot whether or not we up on top, we still rock",Pressure,2006

Cool as a summer breeze
Driftin' on memories
She got me on my knees
Darlin' I'm beggin' please
If there's a winter storm 
And I'm there to keep you warm
In whatever shape or form 
Baby girl gotta put me on

It's been ten years runnin' and you still look stunning
One in a million diamond you're beautiful with brilliance
Still it's not enough even though we're inseparable
We need to take a break but that don't mean that I'll let you go
Tears become streams we got the same dreams
What's with all the competition ma we on the same team
Angel some times I don't show it on the surface but your 
Face is un-replaceable, it's perfect, you're worth it
I'm not always there emotionally even though you're close to me
I got work to do that's how its supposed to be
And I ain't into choppin' it up I'll switch the topic 
Don't trip go you a brand new whip, and took you shoppin'
It's cool just do your thing while I work on this music shit
If we don't end up back together though I'm going to lose it kid
I gotta spit viciously and throw bolts of thunder
For now be a stranger, don't change your number

[Chorus:]

She's a hot one ain't no one iller
Butter pecan and french vanilla
Shit I'm speakin' its true words for real
Baby girl be like a stone killer
She call me pop and sometimes its daddy
She lookin' proper never look ratty
Her waist is small, her booty's real fatty
I let her hold the keys to my Caddy

Of all the beautiful women that I've met in this world
Why is it such a challenge to find the right girl?
I've dated actresses models, strippers, intellectuals
Four months max, like Maxim its all sexual
Incredible I've been to more than twenty countries
Got dirty ugly with honeys that were lovely 
Trust me I'm a Scorpio that's how it has to be
'Til I'm chillin' with a children and a house I'm fast and free

Lookin' back through all the springs that passed
A summertime fun with no strings attached 
Never find love and these flings don't last
Will there ever be a queen for this king to match
Until then I'll be...

Just too hot to touch
Just too hot to touch I got what you want

[Madchild:]
Although I plan to go out with a bang not a whimper
I still gotta watch my temper
Watch over both shoulders cause of what I'm into
Sometimes I get emotional cause of what I've been through
It goes..
Anger, anger, that's one of my hangups
You don't wanna rock and roll kid, your head gets banged up
Feel tension, blood starts pumpin
My friends always win in the fights, I still jump in
And I don't have a drinking problem
I drink, talk shit, fall down no problem
When I drink its a problem, cause I cause problems
Cold hearted, man I'm so robotic
Not like you forgot but I'm slightly psychotic
I'm here to terrorize the world
And fuck the minds up of you boys and girls

[Chorus Cuts]

[Prevail:]
Complete sweep like a cluster bomb
Cold as death, hold your breath till the dust is gone
>From the lost angel city to the gotham skyline
We're still public access but watch us go primetime
I'm Cannonball Crush, not Cane or Able
I reign like Charlamain and just as fatal
Even worse, I'm not vain or narcissistic
Preach like an arch bishop from the darkest district
In the killing field planting seeds of dissent
Fast fascinating demons flashing dreams of contempt
Come on, self contained I'm my own metropolis
Go against the grain for the throne of the populace
Kingdoms I want em, hand em over, relinquish
Or I'll douse them in flames that you'll never extinguish
My right hand writes in sequential order
Eventually I'll make you lifespan potentially shorter

[Chorus Cuts]

[Madchild:]
I'm Fuckin with em....
Did so much dirt can't rinse the filth
Wealthy but concerned with my mental health
Hope to got to heaven but I've been through hell
Think I'm going crazy man please don't tell
Cops hate me they want to throw me in jail
Hate to think if they got me alone in a cell
I'm pretty sure it wouldn't go so well
Cause ain't nobody coming when you yell for help

[Prevail:]
We're the fast and elite
What else, the young and the vigorous
You should probably keep your distance
Cause my hunger is hideous
Tell affiliates and friends there's no need to defend
When the warriors descend is where the story will end
Were ageless and timeless, your faceless and spineless
So let us lead the way while they follow in blindness

We don't force it
Just remember we don't force it
We don't forfeit
Aw naw we don't forfeit
Don't forget
Yeah this gold I spit, I told 'em we rollin' with swollen shit

Keep a deeper state of a mind less tortured
Poison apple move through orchard
I approach you, walk in circles
Spirit of the hunter I could hunt you
Locked in emotional realm
My private world is painful
And I don't care if it rain in my window pane inside I'm a insane angel
No gold at the end of my rainbow
Get a hold of myself 'fore my brain go boom
Sittin' in my room consumed with doom
Doors open force flow through me
Springtime bloomin' daphodiles
Still got a six shot revolver
My gangster friends wont get this album
Not my problem
I hibernate but I still called 'em

Revel in my glory, kneel before me
Or the straight jacket come around
Grey casket underground
Name captivate a crowd, leave 'em in suspense
Maximum overdrive last of my kind alive

Go for the throat again, no friend we don't pretend
Send you to the other end flames on the flesh burn
Meet nephastopholese, heat make it hard to breathe
Leave while you have the chance I could change my mind
Advantage of ricochet adventures in anime
Tear away the back drop revealing the hopeless
Incentive to innovate, allow me to demonstrate
Pinpoint and penetrate the heart like a steel shaft
Birds circle my prey this verse workin' my way
The thirst never left me I just had to find it
Hazardous is chemical no MC identical

[Chorus: x2]

Exert energy, hurt enemy
Love run raw through the veins of my army
Nothin' feel better than the strength of my movement
My revolution, offer solution
Triple seven on a path less traveled
Psycho psychedelic thoughts unravel
Master thief drink psycho juice
With like-minded maniacs who like abuse

Insult to injury, full color imagery
Revenge will be the motivation, open wounds, lacerations
Focus my fascination, nose to the grindstone
This is not an accident battle axe accurate
Immaculate structure my alphabetic framework
Strength of a monolith, brains of a novelist
Ominous approach engulf words like a bonfire
Spiritual vision quest, sacred as eagle's nest

Nice, you cant tell me I ain't came up
Fastball pitcher I deliver with no change up
Fuckin' right I'm famous, balling like the Lakers
Only time I move is to go collect my paper

See me on the wanted poster, Mad and La Coka Nostra
Hop out of my Porsche, pull my trunk and extort ya
Yup we west coast and dog we stay posting
Walk with two toasters Louis Vuitton holsters
I'm a bad fucking bastard yup I'm fantastic
Four but I'm the Silver Surfer flying through your door
Heard you cryin' for the war Im'a try to serve you more
Madchilds a dope man leave you lying on the floor
Damn chicken heads get their feathers all ruffled up
Put the potato on the pound sound muffled up

Or we can get to war like the angels and mongols

So ladies and ah forget it were not gentlemen
I roll up in a stolen car come hop in with them
Hand me a pill bottle I dump it and pop ten of them
Give me some booze, I sip juice like Rakim and them
I got a fuse that's too short and a noose that's too long
Feeling I could do no wrong
This invincibility they're convinced is killing me
Has essentially gotten me through any pinch you'll ever see
When my henchmen are with me tensions on the scene
Dreams are being changed a wrench in the machine
One mention of the team leave the masses buzzing
The rebel, you thought you're on my level, you wasn't

Hotter than Ecuador, son brought a metaphor
P-1 I'm ready for war I'm on the front lines
Runs in my bloodline thirsty like lost boys
Big money bounce my accounts keep em offshore
Caribbean breeze there's ten million reasons
Y'all super eight like rich we four seasons
Fine linen, sterling silver, Bright Brightlen, the lady killer

Four-five stuck on my waist, I hit em
Beat a hater up till he dum dum diddum
Swollen and La Coka don't fuck with em

I started war and bids when y'all was just kids
Came to your town and jumped the fuck around
Stomped out a few of you and fucked your lady
You still married her and you gave her a baby
We were young, we were crazy, we were wild and free
Ain't a groupie bitch alive get a child from me
And now you come to the shows and you reminisce
And while she waits for an autograph, you give her a kiss
She slips me a hug and a look that's knowing
If I say get on the bus, baby girl its on
Lyrics keep flowing and flowing and just flowing
Hoes keep hoeing and hoeing and just hoeing
Trees get rollin' smoking keep blowing
Coka and Swollen legend keep growing
Fast lane living no time for slowing
Gotta know where you been and watch where you're going

People say that they love you but you ain't convinced at all
Tell 'em they full of shit and they'll tell you you're insecure
Calling you immature, does that make sense to y'all?
You ever feel like it's you against the whole world?
Like everybody is schemin' even your own girl
Your homeboy seem to be countin' your money
Tell 'em you ain't got it and he lookin' at you funny

Or either be the G to bang the chrome to get his name known

When Mad Child step on stage, I cause hysteria
Now they won't let my crazy ass back in America

I'm far beyond the magic of a wand inside a wizard's fist
Sharper than the hand of Edward Scissors, I'm a wiz at this
Hotter than the desert but I'm colder than a blizzard kid
Harder than a prison bid, with God I'm never hesitant
My business it isn't as amazin' as it's ever been
As long as God allows me to be clever it will never end
Sharpen up my axe and I am back, I'm here to sever heads
Compulsive obsessive, I'm also aggressive
My mouth is the message, my life is a lesson, my pulse is a blessing

If there's hell below we're all gonna go, yo Curtis Mayfield
God and the devil still tryin' to level the playin' field
Some people sayin' that this life is all about free will
I'd rather have free rent, and never pay these bills
That's why I'm thankful every day that I'm blessed with these skills
And Mad is still alive after swallowin' all those pills
I ride for Saigon, New York to the Hollywood Hills
(The greatest story never told) is now yours to reveal
I feel like helium balloons are stuck up on the ceiling
Trying to make that breakthrough before I catch deflated feelings
Dying with a heart full of regrets is not amazing either
I'll just see the gatekeeper, or you meet the Grim Reaper

I'm looking at the picture of a sociopath
Hope to get first, now hopefully last
Dope rap, I'm known for doing dope in the past
Like floating down the river on a opium boat
But I'm a wild animal I go for the throat
I'm a big bad wolf with a big black Glock
And some real dark thoughts yelling, ""Open the door""
I punch people in the face coming down the staircase
Wander down the hall with the can of bear mace
Aye, I've been a killer since the Wu-Tang Clan
Personality is colorful like Toucan Sam
I'm a crazy cat, Sylvester damn
I got two big guns Yosemite Sam

I used to work birds like Tweety
Speedy, Gonzales living in a palace
Tripped and fell down the rabbit hole and met Alice
Fie years later now I'm back for the challenge
Still rip up shows like Tasmanian Devil
If some punk jump up I'm blasting my heavy metal
And I still live in Van' but I'm moving soon
All my homies on the streets fucking Loony Tunes
But I'll be back, back and forth with no error
Enforcing terror in a Porsche Carrera
Through Vancouver to Los Angeles archangels
Dark strangers, blacks and Caucasians

Crack a Red Bull and drag 'em back to my basement)

Or lying on the floor popping vitamins
Yup, real hip-hop we supplying fans
We on fire man, call the fireman

Real sharp, blade (Dagger Mouth, armed to the teeth)
I can't draw but I'm raw when I'm drawn to the beat
It's like Saw part I, I'll make you saw off your feet
What the fuck is defeat, I'm undefeated like a shoe store
Runway, one way street, take a detour
Robot, C-3P0, R2-D2
Plastic bag over your face hard to breathe through
Preview attract and download the album
X marks the spot like my first name was Malcolm

Make you sing the blues like a prison in Folsom
Spit a burning ring of fire, watch the flames engulf em
My theory very logical but we use Pro-Tools
Fuck with us you'll be a dead man, a corpse in the sound booth
And ain't nobody hear you, close the door make it soundproof
My pattern very classical like Herringbone and Hounds tooth
I.C.P., R.E.P., bright evil clown suit

Burning sound turn around my dude's right behind you

Reverberate the verbs, surround the noun, ground the pound the starting block
Martyrs on the rocks disengaged I threw them over,
Cliffside, from hangman's bluff that's their brains on heavy boulders
Ready the soldier's up, parascope, Red October
Elves and ogres, and hell raisers to focus
On pin head, a thin thread, is what holds your life together
Nas measure anatomy

Equip a baseball bat thats full of wooden spikes
Walking down the dim-lit street call me the hooded knight
I drop a match and set a tank full of petroleum
Then moonwalk across Lemoniun, its pandemonium
Battle plan is that of an apache resistance,
Imagining ten dragons with flags in the distance
Skull and double axes
Troubled brother action

Like [?] on a tricycle, trying to keep up with a Mazerati
Every week catching a body, see me dancing on a cop car
Strapped with C4, screaming out Allah Akbar
I'm not afraid of death I'm more afraid of living slow

Nobody can save me I'm completely out my mind

Swoope,"It’s goin’ down
(repeat)

Hey, I know you think you the one, homie
But can’t nobody escape gravity

Yes sir, it’s about to go down
It’s spiralin’ to the ground, but I don’t think it’s gon’ slow down
This fallen world is fallin’, this building’s ‘bout to blow down
We just goin’ in circles, we don’t get another go ‘round
(It’s goin’ down) What happens when your life is leveled, bro?
A storm is comin’, can’t nobody’s levies hold,
It’s heavy, bro, but I gotta let you know
It’ll help you look beyond this world like a telescope
(It’d be easy) Yeah, stack your money in the air
‘Til it’s rainin’ hund’eds all around your atmosphere
(It’d be easy) You can build a mansion sky high
‘Til can’t nobody see the roof when they drive by
But death’ll hit you like a drive by
And to that stuff you acquired you gotta say “Bye, bye”
I ain’t gon’ lie, you might go down in history
But everything will go down eventually
Everything is falling (down)

[Chorus]
Everything is falling down, down, down.
It’s goin’ down
It’s goin’ down
I see the sky fallin’
It’s goin’ down
And ain’t no way to solve it
It’s goin’ down
I hear the Lord calling

It’s goin’ down, rather comin’ down wit’ it
Cold world, condition is sin, here is the illness
It’s sickenin’, affliction so erotic, sickness so hypnotic
Desirin’ this virus even though we know it’s toxic
Godless, hallowin’ the gods that is counterfeit
We live from ‘de party o’ ‘de dearly departed
The darkness is flowing from my nostrils
We’re so psychotic, we still partyin’ like we not sick
YOLO, homie, so pour another glass
Roll another one up, let’s put on another mask
Another bundle o’ cash, another shorty to bag,
Same thing e’eryday, groundhog under grass
Man, turn the music up cuz I don’t wanna hear the truth
‘Bout the things I’m living fo is dead and I’m the living proof
Shoot, the sky’s fallin’, ain’t no need to panic
Unless we party ‘til it cracks, seeing Jesus standin’
Coming down

[Chorus]

You scared, I’m not
There’s a time for everything,
A time to be born and a time to die
There’s a time when the world as we know it will end
When that is, I don’t know
But it is goin’ down

Listen, it’s goin’ down, down, down holla’ “Mayday!”
Them fiends looking for candy and them dealers got that pay day
I seen them child soldiers; they was loading up some AK's
Ain’t playin’ Modern Warfare. Don't you know ain’t a war fair?
Scales are never even, but they be triple beamin’
They keep them fiends fienin’, the Devil stay scheming
And dreamers steady dreamin’, but ain’t no hope here
Ain’t no satisfaction in money, women, and clothes here
Oh yeah! Them Christians in Christian Audigier
Hey, can't some young men say the stuff we gotta say
‘Cause everything is fallen, it could happen any day
Your world come tumbling down and ain’t no way to get away
You ain’t never gon’ say you ain’t hear it from Lecrae
If I die before I wake I pray to the Lord your soul He'll take
All these drunken nights are empty like the bottles that we break
And you can't get high enough to escape
It's going down!

[Chorus]",Falling Down,2012
Swoope,"Heaven touched my mouth with a fire and made my heart pure
Now my heart pours for everything
From the gang violence in Chicago
To genocide in Darfur
To miscarried children, blood pours on the parched floor
Mama in abortion clinic, baby in a trashbag
All I do is tweet about it, lol hashtag
The new J's is coming out?
Oh I gotta grab that
But get that wisdom out my face and show me where the cash at
Then He placed a crown upon my head
Said that I'm a king already but not yet
Um what does that mean?
Nevermind just in me
I don't need to understand it, I just know that I'm free
Freedom from the Holy One
And no I'm not the only one
A lot of broken hearted kings
I tell ya what they focused on
The world around is dying everyday and we see it
The King's got the keys so he speak and he frees it, Jesus

[Chorus]
Can you see its all in vain (all in vain)
And it breaks my heart to see you fall away (fall away)

We've been battling ourselves like forever, dog fight
Jackals with their tails tied together
All types of Christian churches and world views
But what about the church that the world views?
They see a perilous voyage into the Dead Sea for some pearl-less oysters
In other words it's pointless
They don't understand that this ain't nothing to toy with
They don't understand why we don't give up and join 'em
They don't understand how some of us were appointed
Some of us, cuz some of us are dealing with the sum of us
Not as equal as some say, son
I can see through the sun shades
Darling, you look devilish on the runway
I tried to tell 'em, they eyes would well up
But they some modern day Hellen Kellers
Only go by what they feel, Lord help us

[Chorus]

Yeaaa, breaks my heart
To see us focusing on things that will pass away
Clever distractions

This illusion is tragic
We focused on amusing the masses
But can't see that the center of attraction is all in vain like blind heroin addicts, its all a dream
Unwise settle for hat tricks
My heart cries when airs pulling out rabbits from they might 
As white lies turn to black magic
And destruction results from distraction
Did the folk of the cloth trade mirrors and smoke for the cross?
If so we hope its lost
The hocus pocus that we know that's in the culture will fall
If our eyes ain't on the King then our focus is off, its in vain

[Chorus]",Broken Kings,2013

Je passe mon temps à les regarder penser
Leurs pas pressés, dans leurs corps lésés
Leurs passés se dévoilent dans les pas sans se soucier

Leur visage comme des masques me fait l'effet répugnant
Que faire semblant

SWV,"Boy, be quite, follow me and tip toe
Don't wanna make too much noise
Sneaking in your window
So pull down the shades

'Cause my neighbors are kind of nosy
Comfy, cosy, now off with the clothes-why
Can I get a witness? Betta fitness
Baby, we can do it, take your time, do it right

Lick my belly button, whisper sweet nothings
In my ear to get my hormones in gear
Now, mamma's little baby loves toast and jam
Melts in your mouth but not in your hand
Black pudd'n

Separates the boys from the men
You can knock all day Jehovah but you can't get in
Maybe you can get a scoop, if you're really all of that
And you can leave your fake fingernails in my back
Now, I may not be a lady but I'm surely all woman
So check it, the proof is in the pudd'n

Can I get a lick? Can I get a lick? What?
Can I get a lick? Can I get a lick? What?
Can I get a lick? Can I get a lick, girl?
I wanna get a taste of your pudd'n

Must be Jell-O, 'cause pudd'n don't jiggle like that
Yeah ain't that a fact, pull out your spoon
And let's begin the mixing, always in the bedroom
Never in the kitchen you can get busy

With your head beneath the blanket
Flip it, spank it, gettin' buck naked 'cause women in the 90's
Want more from a brother than a part-time lover
Who's wack undercover, so brother, do your duty
When it comes to the bedroom, don't let him eat the pudd'n

If he ain't got the head room
So, dip, D I P, dive if you wanna be a diver
Sport a helmet with a light like an old gold miner
No need to taste test the puddn's always fresh
So, brothers, wear a bib if you're gonna make a mess

Can I get my spoon in, no way
Now I eats more pudd'n than old folks play bingo
Parker Lewis can't lose in Santa Domingo
What about Atlanta? [unverified] than Santa
Saturday night, I'm liver than Rose-ana-ana Dan-a
So, Holy Molly
([Unverified])

Can I get my spoon in, no way
Now I eats more pudd'n than old folks play bingo

Can I get a lick? Can I get a lick, girl?
I wanna get a taste of your pudd'n

Proof is in the pudd'n, so come get a taste
I know that you love it from the smile on your face
Up and down like a slinky, let's get kinky
The cream in the middle of a Twinkie
'Cause I likes my men cot diesel

And if you're unleaded then nigga, just forget it
You can't rub my back, or kiss my neck either
With you sniffy, sneezy, coughy, achy, stuffy head fever
Undercover lover, in between the sheets
As the bed springs creak, while I rips up the beat

Brothers love the pudd'n like Lucy loves Ricky
Joanie loves Chachi, or Micky loves Minne
But I have getting hickies on my neck in the summer
'Cause wearing a turtle neck is a bummer
I heats up the mike 'til your blood pressure rises

It ain't the kind of pudd'n Bill Cosby advertises
Pull out your spoon, and let us begin
But if you front on the pudd'd
You might not get your spoon in

I swallow my pride, your love is so sweet.
It knocks me right off of my feet.
I can't explain why your loving makes me weak.

It's time after time after time I've tried to fight it.
But your love is strong it keeps on holding on.
Resistance is down when you're around, starts fading.
In my condition I don't want to be alone.

'Cause my heart starts beating triple time,
With thoughts of loving you on my mind.
I can't figure out just what to do,
When the cause and cure is you.

I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak.
I lose all control and something takes over me.
In a daze and it's so amazing, it's not a phase.
I want you to stay with me, by my side.
I swallow my pride, your love is so sweet.
It knocks me right off of my feet.
I can't explain why your loving makes me weak.

I try hard to fight it.
No way can I deny it.
Your love's so sweet.
It knocks me off my feet.

I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak.
I lose all control and something takes over me.
In a daze and it's so amazing, it's not a phase.
I want you to stay with me, by my side.
I swallow my pride, your love is so sweet.
It knocks me right off of my feet.
I can't explain why your loving makes me weak.

I get so weak
Blood starts racing through my veins
I get so weak
Boy it's something I can't explain.
I get so weak
Something 'bout the way you do
The things you do ooh ooh, it
Knocks me right off of my feet,
Off of my feet.
Can't explain why your loving makes me weak.",Weak [A Cappella],1992

Love an experience
Everyone should have
It's not always fun,

But it always special,

And builds the future

But who am I to blame

Does it take till this can become the one?
How many tears must I cry till my heart mends?
But as much as I try to get over you
My heart calls for you

Why is love this way?
Does it have to be this way?
So tell me why
Is it me?

And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

Ich halt' mir die Hand vor's Gesicht
Beamte und Richter, die mich verurteilen
Sind dieselben, die zahlen für die Schlampen am Strich

Mache Schnapp mit den Kahbas im Stripclub
Fast jede Nacht Schäden an dem Meniskus
Komm' im Mercedes-Benz
Eisen in der Hand wie beim Tabledance
Und du bleibst nur ein Hang-Around-Nichtsnutz
Genauso wie meine Engel in Stripclubs
Komm' im Mercedes-Benz
Eisen in der Hand wie beim Tabledance

Du stalkst gern mein Insta-Profil
Obwohl du mich hatest
Wie hat diese Bitch das verdient?
Die Titten voll fake, ey
Körbchengröße G wie ein G
Ihr leckt alle meinen Arsch – V.I.P
Laufe undercover durch meinen Kiez
Und mache Para, Para, Para wie noch nie
Mir geht es gut, ich kann nicht klagen
Wenn du mich buchen willst, 20k Gage
Bitches, sie tanzen jetzt nach meiner Nase
Weil ich sie bezahle
Weil ich sie bezahle
Hater, sie kotzen, ich strahle
Ja, ich strahle
Hater, sie kotzen, ich strahle

Ich muss Mathe begreifen
Ich muss rechnen jetzt (rechnen jetzt, yeah)
Weil ich fang' bald an so viel Geld zu scheißen
Im Rap-Geschäft (Geld, Geld, Geld)
Mit Pennerklamotten auf'm letzten Splash!
Wir hatten kein Cash (kein Cash)
Und ihr wolltet es alles nicht wahrhaben
Doch wir sind kein Trash
Es ist Juju44, ja, das Mädchen gibt es wirklich
Und ich rieche wie ein Pfirsisch, ahuu
Ja, die Gagen werden fetter und die Leute immer netter
Und ich werde immer besser, ahuu
Ich bin verliebt in das Wochenende wie Bella
Ich weiß, du willst mich nackt, nackt sehen, Rihanna
Ihr wollt alle Gangsta-Rap, doch keine realen Rapper
Wäre sie ein Mann, dann wärt ihr leise, #FreeEwa

Back with the better flow, live the life you'll never know
Got this model, bent one time, that's what I call a centrefold
Bitches at my shows, I replays on them, my Pick-n-Rolls
They love the show nigga that's got it popping
Like sausage on a kitchen stove, whoa
I'm doing everything they wish they did
I'm bringing home the bacon like I skinned a pig
Put my CD on your Christmas list
These niggas is trash, they should wear a bag like Missy did
I ain't playing no more, I do everything that I say
And I don't go to the club, 'less a nigga 'bout to get paid
I'm pulling up in all black, with my shades on like I'm Blade
There's a lot of fish in the sea, I keep all of mine in the tank, ah
Twenty-three making more money than your mother
Took some uppers
Now I'm bouncing 'round the club, just like I'm Flubber
And I travel like a trucker, all my shows is doing numbers

And that shit make you feel good

Lyrics stuck in everybody mouth, they need dental floss
Wanna shake my hand, I'll leave you hanging like a fricking cross
(On a chain of course)
Ah, yeah, I got the game on pad lock
Gummy bears all on my calves, they still black socks
I got a drunk cartoon to be my mascot
We been flipping bitches like a motherfucking laptop
I ain't tripping no more, I got everything that I need
I got bottles all in my room, I got beer pong and weed
I got white twins in my phone, save them thing 1 and thing 2
They not tryna tie my down, them hoes don't even wear shoes
Twenty-three making more money than your father
Watch me prosper, get these girls a spanking like an angry toddler
I got lipstick on my collar, dressed in black just like a robber
Boy, I'm fly like Harry Potter, I make hits just like The Dotters, oh

His body parts flip apart down of Fleet Street

Break their hearts and deceive them everywhere I go.
