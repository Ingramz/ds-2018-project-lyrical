Klaatu,"One day when life is taking you nowhere
And you need someone who really cares
When the love that you lost is found
And you will want me around
I'll meet you at the end of the rainbow

As you walk through this world I'll be there
With you wherever you may go
And although you'll never see me
One day you're gonna need me
At the end of the rainbow

Since you left I've felt the changes
You drained away my life in stages
But deep inside something lets me know
Though history still turns its pages
I will track you through the ages
And we will meet again
Somewhere at the end of the rainbow
At the end of the rainbow",At the End of the Rainbow,1981
Klaatu,"When that blue smoke gets in your eyes 
You'll choke, choke 'til you cry 
Oh you'll die 
Hey where you gonna hide 
Well you can talk about the fog in London 
But listen mister that ain't nothin' 
When that blue 
Blue smoke gets in your eyes 

Now long before the dinosaur had come 
There raged a global sea from which life sprung 
A mere few billion years passed on the clock 
And man became the new kid on the block 
He could think and he could talk 
On his two legs he walked in a most peculiar way 
But soon the very things that set him free 
Made him a slave of his technology 
Leonardo, cosa hai fatto tu? 

But when that blue smoke gets in your eyes 
You'll choke, choke 'til you cry 
Oh you'll die 
Hey where you gonna hide 
Well you'll be weeping like an alligator 
And leaping like a hot potato 
When that blue 
Blue smoke gets in your eyes 

Now let us turn to L'Homme Moderne and see 
The ultimate in greed and vanity 
He poaches leopard skins near Zanzibar 
To line the glove compartments of his cars 
Oh but you don't even care, you just carry on 
Carry on your merry way 
But you had better change your foolish ways 
Or you'll be sorry come the judgment day 
Oh yeah you'll see 
You'll be sorry real soon 

But my my my my my 
When the blue smoke gets in your eyes 
You'll choke, choke 'til you cry 
Wanna die 
Hey where you gonna hide 
Well you can talk about the fog in London 
But listen mister that ain't nothin' 
When that blue 
Blue smoke gets in your eyes",Blue Smoke,1981
Klaatu,"The last snowfall in June
The darkest nightmare
Too late
Too soon

Don't cry darling, don't cry
We will all die
December dream
Don't leave me now
December dream
Don't let me down

December dream
How I love you, we boast
December dream
I'm above you, almost

Don't cry darling, don't cry
We will all die
December dream
Don't leave me now
December dream
Don't let me down

The dream is over",December Dream,1981
Klaatu,"I need the love of a woman
That's all I want in the world
I need the love of a woman
Yeah, that's all I'm asking of you, girl

I hear the love of a woman
Can make your world seem okay
Without the love of a woman
Lord, I just can't face another day

'Cause I'm tired of being so lonely
And you're constantly on my mind
So I ask you, please
I'll get down on my knees
If you'll take me home tonight

[Chorus:]
No, I don't want your money
And I don't want your car
I just want to be wherever you are
I don't need no power
No fortune or fame
There's just one thing I need
Nothing else will do
And that one thing I need, girl, is you, you, you

I get so tired of being lonely
And you're constantly on my mind
So I ask you, please
I'll get down on my knees
If you'll take me home tonight

[Chorus]

'Cause I'm lonely and I'm blue
But there's something you could do
Oh woman, oh woman
Now ain't there something you could do?
I need the love of a woman",The Love of a Woman,1981
Klaatu,"My my what a lovely day
Could it be that we've arrived in fair Magentalane
There were times, many times
When I thought we wouldn't make it
I was quite prepared to take it like a man
But here I am

Aye aye bring our best champagne
We'll drink a toast, you and I, to fair Magentalane
Now let me see well shouldn't I make a speech
Or say something in Greek
Perhaps recite a Browning poem, but why
When the only thing that's on my mind is
It feels so good
It feels so good
It feels so good to be back at home

In Magentalane
Where the sea of pink champagne flows
Magentalane
Under rose-colored bainrows
I mean rainbows

Yes there were times, several times
I was sure we'd been defeated
As our Hopes became depleted through the years
But now we're here

So if you please it's time to take our leave
The road to liberty awaits us on the aerodrome incline
Gonna leave that bad old world behind
'Cause it feels so good
It feels so good
It feels so good to be back at home",Magentalane,1981
Klaatu,"[Me]
Talked to a friend one lonely day
Told me that he was going away
He's got to live some other place

[Him]
I can't stay here another day
And to you I say
Tomorrow I leave for outer space
Maybe I'll move to Mars
Maybe I'll move to Mars

[Me]
Naturally I was quite surprised
When I looked into his eyes
To see he was quite sincere

[Him]
All that I have to say
Mars is not so far away
How we will get there is quite clear
Maybe I'll move to Mars
Maybe I'll move to Mars
One step closer to the stars
Maybe I'll move to Mars

[Me]
How will we get there?
How will we get there?
I can't believe that what you say is true
And I can't leave
I've got too much to do

[Him]
Oh we can get there, we have found a way
We're all prepared and we can leave today
Me and my friends have worked for years
And we have planned well, have no fears

[Me]
How will we get there?
[Him]
We have found a way
[Me]
How will we get there?
[Him]
We can leave today
Me and my friends have planned most properly
We have built a ship that floats on gravity

[Me]
And then he turned and walked away
Can't tell you how I regret that day
I've not seen him for years

[Him]
I sent a card today to my friend so far away
Having a nice time wish that you were here
Maybe I'll move to Mars
Maybe I'll move to Mars
One step closer to the stars
Maybe I'll move to Mars",Maybe I'll Move to Mars,1981
Klaatu,"They used to tell me that I was just a fool
Dreaming away my time
But they soon found the more they put me down
The more I blocked them from my mind
I used to get my teacher so uptight
He'd always have to ask his questions twice

I'd be a million miles away
Drifting through time and space
I was a million miles away from any place
I was a million miles away
In a world of my own
A million miles away to parts unknown
I'd be gone

My end-of-term reports would always show
I did pretty well at school
But I kept them hid from all the other kids
I didn't want to seem uncool
My homeroom teacher didn't understand
The reason why I never raised my hand

I was a million miles away
In a world of my own
A million miles away in parts unknown
I'd be gone

I've flown across the galaxies
And been to Berkeley Square
I've passed the time with Sophocles
But never left my chair

But I'm a million miles away
Drifting through time and space
A million miles away from any place
A million miles away
I've built a world all my own
A million miles away to parts unknown
I'd be gone
A million miles away",A Million Miles Away,1981
Klaatu,"Mrs. Toad baked some cookies 
And Mr. Toad had a ball 
But when he finished eating the green sugar cookies 
Well his tummy couldn't hold them all 
Oh no 
No his tummy couldn't hold them all 

Ooh good is good and bad is bad 
As any baker knows 
But too too much good can be as sadly sad 
As too much bad you know 

Mrs. Crow fancied flowers 
She picked them in fields windblown 
But when she'd filled her vases with beautiful blossoms 
Well there wasn't any left to grow 
Oh no 
No there wasn't any left to grow 

Ooh good is good and bad is bad 
As any gardener knows 
But too too much good can be as sadly sad 
As too much bad you know 

Do you wonder will tomorrow be a better place 
Well that only time can show 
But if we put our heads into a better space 
Then maybe we could make it so 
Oh 

Mrs. Toad baked some cookies 
And Mr. Toad had a ball 
But when he finished eating the green sugar cookies 
Well his tummy couldn't hold them all 
Oh no 
No his tummy couldn't hold them all 
And we say 

Ooh good is good and bad is bad 
As anybody knows 
But too too much good can be as sadly sad 
As too much bad you know",Mrs. Toad's Cookies,1981
Klaatu,"I never had a closer friend than you 
I never had such good times as the ones we used to have together 
You're the one I told my problems to 
Throughout the years remained true blue 
No I never had a closer friend than you 

But all good things must end 

No use trying to pretend it isn't so 
When it's time you gotta go 
But I never had a better friend than you 

I know it sounds a trifle odd 
To those who've never had a dog 
But I never had a closer friend than you 

But all good things must end 
No use crying for the dead and that's a fact 
All my tears won't bring you back 
But I never had a better friend than you 
No I'll never have a better friend than you",All Good Things,1993
Klaatu,"Back in 1870
Just beneath the Great White Way
Alfred Beach worked secretly
Risking all to ride a dream
His wind machine
His wind machine
New York City and the morning sun
Were awoken by the strangest sound
Reportedly as far as Washington
The tremors shook the earth
As Alfie blew underground
Blew underground, he blew underground

Ah, all aboard Sub Rosa Subway
Had you wondered
Who's been digging under Broadway
It's Alfred
Poor Al, oh no, Al
As for America's first subway
The public scoffed
""It's far too crude""
One station filled with Victoria's Age
From frescoed walls
And goldfish fountains
To Brahmsian tunes",Sub Rosa Subway,1993
Klaatu,"You're the answer to my question 
You're the theme of my every whim 
You're the highlight of my invention 
Tell me whether I sink or swim 
Cherie be my cherie 
Marry me my Cherie 

In the twilight come to my right 
Chase the dark away when it comes 
Cherie won't you stand to my right 
Have our memories just begun 

Cherie be my cherie 
Marry me my Cherie 

Everything's ours if we want it together 
Everything's here if we want it to be 
Come bring me flowers and bring me a feather 
I'll bring you presents and bring you your tea 

Cherie be my cherie 
Marry me my Cherie 

",Cherie,1998
Klaatu,"See the rainbow by that grove of trees 
Has it not appeared quite suddenly 
Look there, up in the sky 
Can you still pretend to deny 
It's a little bit strange 
How the stars rearrange 
Every time we wander here 
It's always the same 
Now isn't it strange? 
A lilting song floats upon the air 
Whenever the wind whispers through your hair 
And with one great big beautiful smile 
You bring out the sun for awhile 
Wouldn't you consider it odd 
When the whole world starts to throb 
Every time I hold you here 
Near to my heart 

Now isn't that odd? 

Around and around and around ring-a-rose 
Let's make believe it's a merry-go-round 
We go like so 
I'm as dizzy as a top, I'm a-tumbling down 
And what's more fun than a fumbling clown 
Dancing through the green grass 
With your hands in the air 
Touching the sky up there 

Ooh why does 
Everything you touch feel so fresh and new 
How is it spring seems to follow you? 
'Cause where your feet have touched the ground 
The meadows with flowers abound 
Nothing could be quite so wild 
As skipping through them like a child 
Every time I'm here with you 
Every time I'm here with you 
Every time you bring me to Tokeymor Field 
To Tokeymor Field 
To to Tokeymor Field 
To to Tokeymor Field",Tokeymor Field,1998

Klaus Doldinger,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

And all the streets were dark and bare.

I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons.

Hätt' ich nie geahnt, du warst der Schlüssel dazu
Doch so aufgewühlt hab ich dich nie gesehen

We were strangers in the night

A warm embracing dance away

We've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever
It turned out so right

And death without reason

And an attitude to match it

Valleys of love,

And life without meaning

Klea Blackhurst,"Though hope is low
I'm aglow when you smile at me
Life is simple as ABC
Not a thought in my head
Not a care in the world

Though skies are gray
I'm as gay as a Disney cow
Not a wrinkle upon my brow
Not a cent in the red
Not a care in the world

I view the scene
Like that queen of old Russia
As Kate the Great
Used to state long ago
""Nichevo""

So if I move in a groove
With a giddy trot
I'm a trottin' because I've got
Not a bean in my pot
Not a care in the world

Rent's overdue, my sister has measles
Hole in my shoe, my belt's drawn tight
My income is nil, my in-laws are weasels
My present is dark, my future's a fright
But as long as you are there
What in the world do I care?

Though I can't jive
I revive when I see your face
Not a limp in my merry pace
Not a crimp in my style
Not a care in the world

Though I'm a wreck
I can peck if you take a chance
Not a shine on my blue serge pants
Not a crack in my smile
Not a care in the world

Why should I fret
When I bet on a sure thing?
Like Nick the Greek
Used to say every day
""Yip-i-ay""

So if I'm struttin'
With nuttin' ahead in store
There's a reason I said before
I'll repeat it once more

Not a thought in my head
Not a cent in the red
Not a crimp in my style
Not a crack in my smile
Not a care in the world

Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Now I prove again that I can make life move again.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.

Why stars in the trees hide when it rains

Will it sing you a song  
Will it say a farewell
Who can tell

Maybe you're meant to be mine
Maybe I'm only supposed to stay in your arms a while

Klee,"Ich seh die Welt so wie sie ist
Auch wenn ich meine Augen schliess.
Den Wind wie er die Ähren wiegt
Die Hitze die über den Städten liegt
Und es beginnt jeden Tag aufs neue
All die Dinge
Die wunderschönen Dinge
Auf ich ich mich so freue

Ich kann die Welt mit deinen Augen sehn
Ich kann die Dinge mit deinen Händen fühln
Ich kann ein Stück mit deinen Füssen gehn
Ich kann die Liebe durch deine Worte spürn

Und hier sind wir
Jeder kam für sich
Von irgendwo
Woher weiss ich nicht
Doch irgendwas hat es bestimmt
Dass wir an diesem Ort gemeinsam sind
Und dieses Wunder beginnt
Jeden Tag aufs neue
Und in dem Funkeln deiner Augen
Liegt der Grund
Warum ich mich so freue

Ich kann die Welt mit deinen Augen sehn
Ich kann die Dinge mit deinen Händen fühln
Ich kann ein Stück mit deinen Füssen gehn
Ich kann die Liebe durch deine Worte spürn

Klee,"Kein Maler der dass hier einfängt
Kein Dichter der dass hier beschreibt
Kein Musiker der dieses Lied kennt
Keine Formel die dass hier beweißt

Doch ich weiß
Reden ist Silber und Schweigen ist leicht
Und ich rede und rede
Und ich rede und rede
Niemals, niemals

Nicht ein Wort
Von dem was ich sage
Und auch nicht fühle
Können das wiedergeben
Was ich fühle

Keine Sprache die dass hier ausspricht
Kein Buch weiß hierüber bescheit
Keine Farbe die so viel Kraft hat
Kein Weg den es gibt führt so weit

Reden ist Silber und Schweigen ist leicht
Und ich rede und rede
Und ich rede und rede
Niemals, niemals

Nicht ein Wort
Von dem was ich sage
Und auch nicht fühle
Können es wiedergeben
Was ich jetzt fühle

",Nicht ein Wort,2006
Klee,"Ja es stimmt
Wir haben uns ausgeruht
Im Schatten unseres Vertrauens
Und ja es war
Wenn du mich fragtest was ich dachte
Oft alles andere als gut

Und du weisst wie ich
Dass es nicht darum geht
Dass man sich immerzu blind versteht
Wir haben uns so viele Male verletzt
Und doch verzeih ich es jetzt

Unsere Liebe kennt keine Regeln
Sie führt uns auf seltsamen Wegen
Unsere Liebe kennt keine Regeln
Sie muss nichts erklären
Sie muss nichts belegen

Und wenn der alte und mächtige Traum
Erwacht und aus dem Fenster schaut
Kann er uns sehn wie wir vorbeigehn
Und wirds kaum glauben

Unsere Liebe kennt keine Regeln
Sie führt uns auf seltsamen Wegen
Unsere Liebe kennt keine Regeln
Sie muss nichts erklären
Sie muss nichts belegen

Von hier
Bring mich weit weit weg
Bring mich fort
Von den Zwängen
Bring mich raus
Aus der Enge
Bring mich rauf
Bring mich zu fernen Orten
Bring mich nach Haus

Ich streck dir meine Hand entgegen
Bring mich zu anderen Ufern
In ein neues Leben

Bring mich zum Lachen
Bring mich zum Weinen
Bring mich zu großen Taten
Und zu kleinen

Bring mir die Sterne

Melancholie bei dreißig Grad.

Kleenex Girl Wonder,"One Minute is all it took
And now I get it
Hey Look!
There's a lot of history here let me tell you
I hope you're sitting down, baby,
Sorry, it took so long
But you were far away,
And I just found your phone number today
So I'll spit it out now baby

Are you feeling me?
I don't believe your stories
You're no more brave than you used to be
Take me seriously
I'll pretend that I'm not he
But it's still hurts and I still breathe
But while I'm quick to admit that the outlook's bleak
I'm pulling in five hundred bucks a week
I'm fine with the way things are
And I'm in love

There's nothing I would rather do
Than anything involving you
You're still the one I can't stop thinking of

Got lost on the Penna Turnpike
The grey moon was bright as a prison searchlight
How soon we forget how much it hurt the first time
And I smiled at the stroke of midnight
Cause I knew the trap I'm in is skin tight
Somehow I know we'll get by

Because I'm much smarter now
I know all your secrets and even they don't get me down
Your hard to figure out and even harder to please
But that's what I need
I know it's hard to believe but just trust me

I know how it feels to be seventeen
To be young and in love
And feel so unclean
To just lie in your bed and you pray that your eyes won't close
Cause heaven only knows how much I dream about you
I know what I'd be without you
And the saddest image I have seen
You run right through my scar queer ass
And shatter my heart of glass
And how hard I'll laugh
As I cash in the insurance policy
You say it's obvious
Then prefer honesty
Well, I'm in no mood to defend my immodesty
So let's just pretend that I've ended my odyssey

Where else can I go?
You're the sweetest girl I know
I'm pregnant
And I'm coming home to you
But what can we do?
There's some indiscretion
Who needs an ancient history lesson

And you look fetching

Somewhere, all that we leave behind
Lingers on, longing for lullabies
You live, you learn
You love, you burn
You win, you lose
Becoming you

Someday, when I cry in the rain
I think of you
Looking through eyes of pain
Passing on a feeling that we can't deny
Over on to you

All the parties and
How you win them

3 AM, now it's 3AM

I pretend
I can feel your hands
And arms around me
Trying to fall asleep again
Sleep again it's 3 AM

3 AM, soon the day will break

Your lips are so far away
And our words they
Fly around across the ocean and
Disappearing somewhere over New Foundland
""Oh I love you""

3 AM, now it's 3 AM
When will you be back again
And do you think we can
Keep our love for ever more?

And smiling with his eyes.

Went on to organize,

Where working men defend their rights,

Deixa marcas no pescoço

Klezmer Conservatory Band,"We meet, and the angels sing
The angels sing the sweetest song I ever heard
You speak, and the angels sing
Or am I breathing music into every word

Suddenly, the setting is strange
I can see water and moonlight beaming
Silver waves that break on some undiscovered shore - Then
Suddenly, I see it all change
Long winter nights with the candles gleaming
Through it all your face that I adore.

You smile, and the angels sing
And though it's just a gentle murmur at the start
We kiss, and the angels sing
And leave their music ringing in my heart.",And the Angels Sing,1993

From the foam-crested brine
It's your skin shining softly in the moonlight

Am I yours? Are you mine to play with?
Joking apart, when you're drunk you're terrific when you're drunk
I like you mostly late at night you're quite alright

But I can't understand the different you in the morning
When it's time to play at being human for a while, please smile
You'll be different in the Spring, I know
You're a seasonal beast like the starfish that drift in with the tide, with the tide
So until your blood runs to meet the next full moon

Your lunacy fits neatly with my own, my very own

Ahh Ahh Ahh

Splashing through the sand bar
Talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life, like when and where
We didn't have no internet
But man I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long

Catching Walleye from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun
We couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock and roll

While we were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long

Now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change
Or how we thought those days would never end
Sometimes I'll hear that song and I'll start to sing along
And think man I'd love to see that girl again

And he shoots you dead and he eats your head

You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too
Mercury's and Subaru's
And you don't stop, you keep on eatin' cars

Just have your party on TV
'Cause the man from Mars won't eat up bars when the TV's on
And now he's gone back up to space
Where he won't have a hassle with the human race

About the the things you said concerning my singing

Oh, you said the top ten billboards, I could break in
Tell me are you for real or just faking?
I grow up and you think the hippies would dig me
I would work on my flow if you thought I had hip-hop in me

To impress the girls I'd work on my sensitivity
As for my debts, who's proud for punk crowd longevity

CHORUS
And if you told me that I could be famous
I present you with a list of changes I could make
We could fake the world out

It's all 'cause of us I'd caused shotgun on the tour bus
Playing every show shirt lest ladies would adore us
Throwing pennies on stage at every single chorus
Then we'd break up the band 'cause all this money bores us

Every day when I wake up
Tryna read my fortune on the bottom of my coffee cup
But it seems like I never finish
It's always half full, or is it half empty?
Maybe it's my own superstition or a kind of self protection
If it all looks bad, why would I wanna look ahead?
Oh, oh, oh, still sittin' here
Just watching the sun go down, (down), down, (down), down

Life goes on with or without you
It's up to you what you're gonna do
You could go or you could stay
Who cares anyway?
Life goes on with or without you
Damn it baby, what you're gonna do?
You could go or you could stay
But who cares anyway?
(Ha yeah, who really cares?)

Every conversation gets me high on motivation
Gets me craving of your own familiar situation *yeah)
Reach the unreachable, achieve the unbelievable
In the midst of all the madness, remember life's beautiful
Still I'm feeling restless, thinking I should rest less
Work more, play hard, ready for the encore
Is this the kinda life I really wanna live for? (two times)
In my heart I know, less is more (more)
More (more) more, more, more

Damn it baby, what you're gonna do?
You could go or you could stay
But who cares anyway?

It's time to take this out of my hands
Is it all gonna be worth it in the end?
'Cause it's safe here in my comfort zone
Never stray too far from home (yeah, yeah, yeah)
But then again this way I'll never know, never know
Maybe I should go

Go crazy, go insane, go for everything
Get the money, dollar bills in your wallet, say ka-ching
Sign the dealy, make a mili, sound famili?
The urgency is sounding the drilly for the ma-milli
And then they really talk in Braille, actin' chilly
They got me feelin' like an achilles, silly, silly, I mean, really?
Really, really, really really though?
Really, really, really though?
Feel the vibration of the higher ground
Love always leads to the highest sound
Many conversations, people makin' speculations
As to my procrastination due to my revelations
And then they get fugazi
You call yourself a rider
You need to speed your loyalty up like Bugatti
Baby don't underestimate my underdog mentality
We 'bout to race ahead, ambition on Ferrari

Obsessed and derranged
I have existed for years
But very little has changed
I'm a tool of the government
And industry too
For I desire to rule
And regulate you
Vile and pernicious
But you can't look away
I make you think I'm delicious
With the stuff that I say
I'm the best you can get
Have you guessed me yet?
I'm the slime oozing out from your TV set

Tell me you love me
Tell me you love me
Tell me you love me
Like I want you too
I love you so much
I'm crying for you
I wanna come inside and get ahold of you

You get me wasted and you're half-way there
If my mind is tore up, then my body don't care
I'm the air
I'm the water
I'm the dirt beneath your shoes
Tie me all up, strap down and get loose
Fuck yourself up
Your body and your soul
Sooner or later, you'll believe what I've told

Tell me you love me
Tell me you love me
Tell me you love me

Check it out
First of all I would like to dedicate this song
To a very special and beautiful young lady
A lady whom in which I am in very love with
So from the bottom of my heart I speak
Only what I feel hoping that you will
Understand that there will never be another man
That'll love you the way that I do
You are my world and without life is not worth living
So please baby give me one more chance and I
The man that loves you will never let you down

[Knightowl]
Since nobody's weak like you
Baby though you know that I love you
You be the girl that I'm thinking about
Every muthafuckin day
I can't get you out of my mind
I remember the day that I met you
The day that I saw you the very first time
I knew that I had to make you mine
So I started to walk where you was at
I asked for your name
You gave me your name and number
Now you're stuck inside my brain
Cause all that I think about
Is how much I want to be your man
And spend my life with you my girl
Because I love you
We talk on the phone at night on a regular basis
But sill I haven't popped the question
Baby will you be my girl
I know that I'm the one for you
And you're the one for me just take my hand
I'll be your man together us two for eternity

[Chorus]
I want to love you until the end of time
I want to make you mine baby don't go
You are the only one I think about everyday
I want to make you mine baby don't go
Say that you'll be my girl (say that you'll be my girl)
Say that you'll be my girl.

[Knightowl]
Nobodys ever been able to make me feel
The way you make me feel
This love is real I'll never put nobody else above you
Never did I think that a man like me
Would have a chance
But now that it's me and you I'm trapped
Inside of this romance
My world was lonely until the day
That you came along but now I am living life
With you, you are what keeps me strong
Without you life wouldn't be worth living
So don't leave my side
I hope someday you'll be able to say
That yes you'll be my bride
I've been in love with you for quite some time
And I feel so good that I got a woman like you
To love me when I need you hug me kiss me
Don't you stop
And tell me that I'm the one that you need
You are my world
So tell me baby that you want to be my girl

[Chorus]

[Knightowl]
I know that I've done things in the past
but how long will this last
I said that I was sorry
please forgive me just give me one more chance
My life without you ain't the same
I'm learning from my mistakes
And though these heart aches
You're putting me through I need you
Baby don't go I've always been true
I've never cheated
I've always been that man you wanted
Girl you're what I needed so give me your love
Come back I'm waiting for you the girl of my dreams
Oh how unreal it seems
When you're not here standing next to me
Remember the day you kissed me
The very first time I held you tight
When we made love that night
We both knew what we did was right
Cause we was both in love
And you're the only one I'm thinking about
I have no doubt it's you the one I love
Mireya, would you be my girl?

Back up in the house for that Y2K shot
Young Sicc aka Frank Nitty
With my dog Knightowl
What's up dog
Keeping it real baby
You know what I'm saying
We're gonna show you fools how to represent
Represent that Dago style
Killer Cal style, baby

[Young Sicc]
Well it's that E-double S-E represent to the fullest
The mic is like a nine homeboy, don't make me pull this
Trigger if you figure that you can hang with us
Ese Sicc in the brain, click click, shoot 'em up shoot 'em up, bang bang
Be ready to throw them thangs and drop them bombs on ya
And this is how we do it in that Southern Killafornia
G's carry rags and represent your true colors
And if you ask me it feels good to be that Mexican brother
I handle my own and mind my own
But if you try to step you best believe it's going to be going down dog
Dropping bombs, stomping fools like King Kong
Take my steel-toes off your head and then I'm gone
So just recognize and watch your little step
Or be like American Me and catch that sharp shank to your neck
But I ain't trying to trip, just letting you know where I stand
Coming sick with this shit and representing Mexicans

[Chorus x2: Young Sicc]
Represent like it ain't no thang
Represent staying true to the game
Represent when we're out just hanging, banging, swanging
Represent that neighborhood gang

[Knightowl]
Better believe I represent reality, my street mentality
Will bring the pain, so don't get caught up in the game
The life I lead was not exactly what I chose
Hanging out on corner and drinking brew with winos
Smoking on the lala, the sound of fucking valas
Through the night up in the city where it's wicked, Dago where I kick it
G's all around me, mobbing through the county
Don't ever step and try and cross the line or you will find me
Got my boy Frank Nitty going off on your committee
You want to get brave, we'll give that ass an early grave
Little youngsters throwing up their shit
And ain't knowing I'm a G
I'm part of the reason shit goes down up in the SD
We represent this to the fullest, and I'm quick to pull a jale
Me vale madre, chinga tu madre
The loc'est of them all, I'm guaranteed to make you fall
Victim all up in the ghetto 'cause I wear the fucking metal baby

[Chorus x2]
[Young Sicc]
I represent everywhere I go and where I be at
Creased up Levis, Chuck Taylors and that San Diego hat
That grey pulled over sweater, Mexicans sticking together
Through tough situations, any kind of weather
Rolling in Impalas, Regals and Cadillacs
Homies got that San Diego tatted on their backs
And even on their arms, head and the chest
But this is how we do it on that wicked ass West
G's come out the pen, they're all sleeved up
So approach the wrong G and watch that ass get beat up
I'm only duece-one but got family that taught me well
And they got all kinds of stories to tell, laying low like a shell
Avoid sand getting kicked up in your face
You recognize or get put in your place
I always stay quiet and listen to what my family had to say
And thank 'em that I got to live to see another day

Kid Frost
This is big business, understand me?
Yeah, you can't take no for a answer

Welcome to the world of big business, lives get broken and made
You're walkin barefoot in a room full of razorblades
We're playin catch with a hand grenade
Cause what you faggot niggas caught
Spread you all over the asphalt
Walk the walk, talk to nobody
Spark the chrome shotie
Whenever they run up on your home, Gotti
Gangsta, gangsta, read all about it
Xzibit get your whole shit crowded
And packed to capacity
You actually had the audacity
To want some problems with the X Man
Lift you off your feet with the back of my left hand
Learn one of life's hard lessons
You can't negotiate with a weapon
When it's fully loaded and cocked
Hollow points shot
Next to the firing pin, with the hammer ready to drop
I took you off, so accept the loss
Crack open some Olde English that's covered with frost
And it's like that

Can you feel it, nothing can save ya
For this is the season for stackin the papers

Chasin my chips till my last days
Hit a million dollar lick and split it three ways

I'm in pursuit of them hundred dollar big faces
Wrapped in rubber bands in em bulletproof briefcases
Please understand automatically 
One squeeze of the trigger cause tragedy
Casually fucked around and got your whole family mad at me
My strategy: subtract enemies mathematically
Frost will kick your head off slow, you ain't as bad as me
50/50 - half gangster, half hustler
One side's about my business, and the other side's a muthafucka
So when I creep, I crawl, I'm like Swiss-made
Fuck are you, bitch-made, I slice you with my switchblade
Razor, got the H-K with the laser
Slid the Enterpriser, rent a 99 black Blazer
I shot straight at Merino
Thousand dollar suite, layin low at the Peppermint Casino
I been a player before I had riches
And now I'm eatin steak and crab and fuckin bad bitches

Can you feel it, nothing can save ya
For this is the season for stackin the papers

Chasin my chips till my last days
Hit a million dollar lick and split it three ways

I don't give a fuck about not one of why'all
Disrespect this here, nigga, it's real clear I'm gunnin why'all
When night falls, nah fuck, night flies a kite
I take flight like Delta, nigga, helter skelter
Who the fuck could you call to help ya
Nigga, good health couldn't help ya
Put the 's' in spit, bust your tightest shit, never felt ya
Could you picture yourself in the same room when I let these off
Two rivals, suicidal, take the strap and squeeze off
But before you do it, I take the heater and shoot both your knees off
Let him suffer, can't get enough of, I'm rougher
Go get my ammunitions and paper, nigga, cause it's a habit
Let off on ya in a 600, or let's call em rabbit
Is it tragic how the automatic made you breathe like a asthmatic
Static, what's that? That shit that get up in my fabric
I'm into bitches and beamers and my chips
And I'm keepin four eyes on em schemers when I dip, bitch

Knights of the Occasional Table,"In case of sonic attack on your district, follow these rules
If you are making love it is imperative
To bring all bodies to orgasm simultaneously

Do not waste time blocking your ears
Do not waste time seeking a sound proofed shelter
Try to get as far away from the sonic source as possible

Do not panic, do not panic, do not panic
Do not panic, do not panic, do not panic

Use your wheels it is what they are for
Do not attempt to use your own limbs
Small babies should be placed inside the special cocoons
And should be left, if possible, in shelters

If no wheels are available metal, metal, metal, metal
Metal, metal, metal, metal
Not organic limbs should be employed whenever practical

Remember, remember, remember, remember
In the case of sonic attack survival means
Every man for himself, himself, himself, himself, himself, himself
Statistically more people survive if they think
Only of themselves, only of themselves, only of themselves

Do not attempt to rescue friends, relatives, loved ones
You have only a few seconds to escape
Use those seconds sensibly or you will inevitably die

Do not panic, do not panic
Think only of yourself, think only of yourself
Think only of yourself, think only of yourself

These are the first signs of sonic attack
You will notice small objects such as ornaments oscillating
You will notice [Inaudible]
You will hear a distant hissing in your ears

You will feel dizzy, you will feel the need to vomit
[Inaudible]
[Inaudible]

[Inaudible]
[Inaudible]
You may be subject to fits of hysterical shouting or even laughter

These are all sign of imminent sonic destruction
Your only protection is flight
If you are less than ten years old
Remain in your shelter and use your cocoon

If I remember you can help no one else, no one else
You can help no one else, no one else
You can help no one else, no one else
You can help no one else, no one else

You can help no one else, no one else
You can help no one else, no one else
You can help no one else, no one else

You can help no one else, no one else
You can help no one else, no one else
You can help no one else, no one else

Some hearts skip a beat, some get blew out, and every light

Bustin on shit to lay everything down even tourists and non-affiliates
These days, gun play is official with green lights on every block
Know the sign tells you too it's not best to stop
On every corner, cali niggas are dumping
You'll be shaking your soul loose from the box at the coroner's
Making death not so foreign to ya
Niggas got rugers and m-14's with enough
Ammo to leave an armored truck swiss cheese

At Leimert Park, taggin', hittin' fools up
Ditching my class, just to fuck yo' school up
You don't wanna blast, nigga tuck yo' tool up
But don't sleep, y'all niggas quick to shoot you
Now there's another motherfucker with no future
But Time Bomb much smoother when I maneuver, dope like Cuba
Got em jumpin Disciples to the Hoover

I'm coming ""Straight Outta Compton"" with a loose cannon
Smoke big green, call it Bruce Banner
Watch your manners, at last another blast from the top notch
From way back with the pop rocks, I pop lock witcha
Picture this, Dr. Dre twisting wit Tha Liks
And Hittman bought a fix
Don't trip, it's a Time Bomb in this bitch
Here it tick tick tick tick {*BOOM*}
Wait a minute it's on, I tell it like a true mackadelic
Weed and cocaine sold separate, check it
From sundown to sunup -- clown and run up
The Aftermath'll be two in your gut, nigga what?

We roll deep, smoke on weed drink and pack heat
Requirements for survival each day in L.A.!
It don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops
Analyze why we act this way in L.A.!

Gimme that mic fool, it's a West coast jack move
They call me Hitt cause I spit like gats do
Cock me back
Bust caps for my max crew, at Fairfax
Who used to wear Air Max shoes, that's true
But I grew up where niggas jack you, harass you
Blast you, for that set you claim (where you from?)
Mash on you for your Turkish chain, C.K. B.K
Blue'd up or flame, I ran wit a gang
I helped niggas get, jacked for they Dana Dane's
My pants hang below my waistline
I look humble wanna rumble? (yeah yeah)
I bang though, like Vince Carter from the baseline
Don't waste my time
Fuck a scrap in killa Cali, AK's and 9's
One-time's, sun-shines, and fine-ass bitches
Hawaiian Thai, drive-bys, six-fo's on switches

I was raised in the hood called WHAT-THE-DIF'
Where the brothers in the hood, refused to go Hollywood
Slugs for the fuck of it
Anybody hatin' on us can suck a dick
If I catch you touching mine you catch a flat-line, dead on the floor
Better than yours, driving away gettin' head from a whore
It's AvireX-to-the-Z
Fuckin' with me might get you banned from TV
Cassette and CD it's all mine the whole nine the right time
Multiply, we don't die, the streets don't lie
What, so neither do I, I'm bad for your health
Like puttin' a pistol up to your face and blastin' yourself

Five in the mornin', burglars at my do'
Glock forty-five in my dresser drawer
Let 'em come in BLAOW he see the thunder roll
Roll with niggas, who buy fifths by the fo'
And brew's by the case
SLAP YOU in the face with the bass, Dr. Dre laced
Likwit Kings wit Sedans and gold rings
Haters fold the style, but can't find no openings

Analyze why we act this way in L.A.!

Strapped and filled with plaques

That you see makes you wanna give up the draws
At parties and shows, I mash regardless
Yo hardest flows couldn't stop this bombardment
I clench the vision till there's no room for expansion

She lived right around the corner from Temecula
See I was bored, I fucked both of them whores before
So I called my other bitch Elsinore

She wasn't cracking
So I called up Hesperia and Monrovia and Valencia
I got some pussy from Pomona and her sister Corona
It ain't nothing like them hoes in southern California

I knew a bitch named Irvine
She had a cousin with the name Santa Ana
It was short for Anaheim
I got high in Riverside with Receda and Rosarito
And Santa Clarita and [unverified]

And with over a thousand girls
And homeboy I don't know what you have been told

I put out with three dime pieces slamming four doors
And if I can use cities in relation to hoes
I probably fucked San Fernando's daughter, Santa Barbera

And Ramona's little sister Covina

And when you need us we never come running
That's why now you think about your ex again
You want to page him just to have sex with him
But instead you better call your next of kin

And complain these ballers won't let you in
She don't love you she loves money and sex
Bitches shoot you in the head for a Rolex
I know the bitch is a dick fiend

I fucked her one night when she was sixteen
I know it seems like a long time ago
But I fucked her again when she was twenty four

What she do it for? Biyatch

Ahhh!

Hey, bring that over, call them up
Order me some motherfucking (Knoc-Turn' al) Hennesy

Wu-Tang got mansions in the hills
Hoe squat thick, hoe squat paying bills
Red & Meth on hot wheels bumping down Sunset
La Maridia, sky balling, what is this?
My eyes, they caught up in the sea, look at Jay-Z
At the Source's Swap Meet getting Memphis Bleek some fitted khakis
Yeah, well real niggas get passes sometimes
Out of bounds in the land of the sunshine
Even Biggie said he was coming back (coming back)
And if he did, we would accept him because a nigga is black
You bleed just like us
Picture me being scared of a nigga that breathe the same air as me
You bleed just like us

And crumble green on a Zig-Zag and lacein' with hash

So when the phone jump off a nigga ready to smash
I drink my 'gnac out the bottle
I don't fuck wit a glass
And I ain't sip trippin dog, that's a thing of the past
And I stay in good shape so my stamina last
And put hands on a motherfucker bout my cash
I was a stick up kid, I snatch your chain and dash
And if the pawn shop wanted it I bound it fast
Or I'm creepin through your window breakin out your glass
Then I rob the whole party lookin through a ski-mask, c'mon

A nice bush to stab and hit, minus the bullshit, minus the two bit
Up her knowin' I'm ruthless and need of a good bitch
So independent, more than my mistress, more than to fuck
She comes, reopen the guest list

And bisexuals, would like to go low
And deliver low blows and high off sex and no do's

[Hook]
I can see you watching
Waitin in my garden
In my bushes plottin
Peepin' Tom's in my home
Lookin in my window

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time in the projects, yo
There lived a nigga named Knoc-Turn'al
America's most wanted, for sho'
In a black Lo-Lo, with tinted windows
Just cruisin' down the street in my 6-4
Checking all my traps and all my hoes
Life is, too short, I stay on my toes
G'd up, I spill gin and juice on brand new clothes
I pulled up, hit a switch and dropped the back
On the prowl in a black hat lookin for cats
I got a chrome plaque that reads, ""Who's the Mac?!""
Black pussy, always talk about it 'cause I love it
This California love got a nigga drunk in public
Express yo' self, keep doin' it good
Got white on the block, keep the heat in the bush
Keep risin' to the top, keep smokin' the kush
The boys in the hood are always hard
Come talkin that trash, we'll pull your guard
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Can't trust my homies, can't trust no bitch
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't say shit
It's hotter on the block than it is in the kitchen
And I'm hard in the paint, listen, I'm steady dippin
I get down, while your bullshittin'
And these are the tales, the freaky tales
Of a nigga on the grind that you know so well
Got a system in your trunk then I'm jacking for beats
Black superman, I put it down for L.A.C
I grip the pump in my lap at all times
Fools be jackin' other fools but they don't be jackin mine
Summer time in the L.B.C. (Fuck the police)
Fuck being bound by law and the peace treaty
We be clubbin, everybody likes when the girls shake somethin
System overload, stay bumpin
It's thug life, y'all know the rules, gotta do what ya gotta do, and stay true
Propose a toast to the West Coast
Easily I approach the microphone because I ain't no joke
Tell your mama to get off of my dip
I have no time to give her my dick, I'm gonna hold it
And walk around the stage
And if you fuck up, I'm gonna get my gauge and shrivel you up
Like California raisins, then unload the barrell and laugh
'Cause I'm puttin lead in your motherfuckin' ass

[Verse 2]
I'm on the radio, and ain't a damn thing funny
It's just like Compton, bitch better have my money
I messed up and I don't know why
Tryin' to get a piece of that American Pie
Do my thing, blow off the roof on 187-Proof
It's gettin funk-ay, it's gettin funk-ay
It's the formula, murder was the case that they gave me
Dear God, I wonder can you save me?
Dear Mama, Brenda had a baby
Hard times got a nigga goin' crazy

It's amazing
How outta my life I made short a long story
I came a long way outta bullshit but I asked for no glory
I came a long way from the pavement on the block stackin' dough
And on a long day there would be a raid and business was slow
How many times must I see a victim losing a life?
How many days must I hustle 'fore my hustle get right?
How many days must the children duck when bullets take flight?
How would a gang act when one of they own is dying tonight?

How hard times, they come and they go
In the ghetto, these ghetto days we go with the flow
I spent my whole life hustlin', grindin' the streets
And when hard times came I regrouped and stood on my feet
When will it be safe for kids to go outside again?
When will the day come for us to love and embrace a friend?
I travel all around the world, working, gettin' it right
Because the world is a ghetto and the ghetto's my life

How mothers in ghetto's hold they heads high
And when times get too hard they just look to the sky
Pull out some drink 'cause the homie would'a been 30 today
But tragedy struck at 14 and took him away
I want a new life where family's don't have to cry no more

And even 50 cent said he'd ride with me

You know I like livin'
Enjoyin myself and I ain't bullshittin
You don't move me with fat mouth and lippin
And you don't want to see me out of retirement trippin
I got a lot to live for
And id be damned if I change one bit

I like the way I am

Sippin on sour amoretta

But imma bounce cause her friend looks better

I like the way she got herself in v I p
If she sees k n o see
She gon chill 
And wait out front for me
Who do you know that rides for the coast
With a new breed and style of rap like me
I had the patience to study the game
Dr Dre made two chronics and this is chronic three
I make classic hits and buy classic cars
And see classic tits at classic bars
Knoc steps in the spot and the girls all pause
Magic stick ill break down walls
Got my heat as shit jumps off
Really you stepping to me is a lost cause
Party animal here since a quarter to ten
Baby phase 16 with an LA brim
I got shell toes on I don't wear them tims
Got niggas got hoes in the gaggle of gin
Ain't no telling what I might get in
The first night
Do it right
Imma do it again
C'mon

Knowdaverbs,"Lemme tell you 'bout this girl named Equeena I met
You'll never meet a girl like Equeena I bet
But if you ever shall than consider you blessed
She's rich beyond the natural so my spirit's impressed

Had an encounter with this gal at Grammatical show
She was looking unfamiliar but someone I'd like to know
So I thought possibly could she be of the same mind
Taken by her beauty but was anxious to find..
Out. See what this woman was all about
But I doubt I'll get the time of day so I'm out
I thought to myself, you'll never know until you ask her
Well, I tend to dig the chicks that do agree with my pastor
So I inquired 'bout her name she threw it out but I missed it
At first I had the jitters to nervous to even listen
Shook her hand said, ""Hi, I'm Knowda or Verbs is what's preferred.""
She cracked a smile like a baby and I'm glad that part occurred
With that she broke the ice the conversation was nice
Should I ask her for her number? Don't think twice
I tried to stay on my toes and kick the lines that were witty
And avoid saying things like, ""Gee, Equeena you're so pretty!""
Kept my cool and maintained never thought she saw me sweat
But I never will forget the day that we met
She had an ill type of radiance you felt when her presence
With a certain type of glow like lamps that be fluorescent
Her own type of flav that stretched from head to toe
I think when she was made they went and dipped the mold in gold
The way she moved was angelic she my eyes dance
At first I was a skeptic at this love at first glance

Lemme tell you 'bout this girl named Equeena I met
You'll never meet a girl like Equeena I bet
But if you ever shall than consider you blessed
She's rich beyond the natural so my spirit's impressed

A couple of hours have passed we've shared some things an we've laughed
In my book from one to ten she rates eleven and a half
You can tell she opened up as the time flew by
She was no plain Jane looking for the average Joe
Equeena had plans she's not the type to live trife
She wants to graduate from college wants to live a Godly life
She wants to go wherever she feel God leads her
Wants to hook up with a man that honestly feels he needs her
So the fact that we actually crossed paths it all seems odd
She let me know first off she wants a man who seeks God
So I thought BINGO! Can I please be a contestant?
Thanking God for early Christmas an unwrapped present
He must've reached into the heavens took the fixing's and the makens
And made the girl of my dreams that I could see when I'm awakened
The time drew near for us to part for the momento
Got her little backpack took some paper and passed a pencil
Needless to say by that I was deeply flattered
Taking note of her fragrance and the way her eyes have battered
I explained her the blessing just to meet her acquaintance
She gave a hug and I was like a king
It's like I can't just say goodbye somebody call the F.B.I
I've caught a case of the love bug and can't deny
But wonder why? We came so close at an escalated rate
I think she's in the Syllabus, man God is great!

Strong, bold and demanding that makes the girl outstanding
Often imitated and simulated but never is she replicated or emulated

Knowdaverbs,"[Verse 1: Knowdaverbs]
Looking at the world through tortoise shelled Gazelles
Two styles once separate have locked from parallel
'Cause the less without the greater just couldn't suffice
so with cans, tiles, and mics we serve Christ
I can't conceive why those in disbelief
Stand back in awe that should be sighs of relief
I'm thinking like this it all seems correct
Use the gifts he gave to glorify, never neglect that
Review the word it stays in tact should have known that
From the day they rolled the stone back
Entrusted with ableness of the extraordinary
to challenge your physical and make your spirit double daring
While we Brooklyn Rock and rhyme people take it for granted
We move the gospel global universal across the planet
But since the birth of this you seen the bestest and the worstestes
Some claim original but they just pros at being perpetrist
Biters! Counterfeiting God's designs
like there were 1200 Techniques then 2000 by Gemini
He aims to fade the cross and try to scratch the win
Be continuous in your mix then transform you back to sin
But it ain't with it Christ is more than just a figment
Apply God tips live it vivid, like Krylon pigment
Idle minds try to pervert it, kill it, and dement it
The Factors remain to rhyme Christ centered and oriented
Though waves get rough trying to follow the example
The power to tread and trample clear the battle like a sample
Yes! Yes! y'all it don't stop
Christ reigns supreme he be the best sure shot!

[Chorus: Knowdaverbs]
Take a break from rhyming and record and playin'
The real master piece is in the inners activation
Some have doubt about the true Fifth Element
The same yesterday as today and that settles it!

[Verse 2: Knowdaverbs]
I remember the days I was a Hip Hop tot
Shuffled on box tops dubbed tapes from cousin Scott
Then it seemed different once Christ was implemented
with the Fifth Element in it the skills are fermented
There's no rule breakin' that's the art of emceeing
Masters commissioners professin' his living being
Contact the cross recognized the blood lost
and talents you've received all expense no cost
Emmanuel! The greatest emcee the world has ever known
Every time that he bust thousands came to the show!
Emmanuel! The greatest be	-Boy the Earth has ever seen
When it was time for him to break he wiped the slate clean!
Freshly white, brite, glimmerin' like neon
Buffed over what stood before like legal walls to peace on
So like Phanatik says, don't wrap the mystery revealed
Why we sport Adidas? By his stripes we were healed!
Without the rhythm of the word verse ain't complete
While my KJV vibrateth the concrete!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Knowdaverbs]
Take some time read between the sinewaves
excel in excellence plus divine is what the rhymes states
Eight tracks, CD's, back around the vin plates
Form, pause the track... see how your mind waits
We confronted people that doubted what we do
I migrate with Factors a herd of a chosen few
The reason I state that is many receive callin'
But some wade in the water while few are down for all in
Total submission submerged in a pursuit
in a trek for holiness 'stead of cars ladies and loot
Down like a bubble jackets for refining test again
Keep the walk tight left then right like a pedestrian
Many times I've read the word, many times I've been astounded
Integrity and diligence make an emcee well rounded
'Cause what is a deejay if he can't scratch?
What is a emcee if he can't rap?
What's a disciple if his walks wack?
El Shaddai renews it all baby just like that!

I had to seek the kingdom and execute the Devil's tricks
I'm never lookin' back but all the while feelin' lonely like
A king to his throne
Lord father take me home

In a darker realm I slept for days I wept
For my Lord to open my gates and my soul he kept
'Cause I was null and void in the pathway of righteous
Screamin' sinners prayers hopin' one steady might just
Live true my inner spirit nearly dead
Spirit food consistency nearly water and bread
Then a turnaround be	 thunderbolts did deliver
Grains of sand in my life turned into a roaring river

Temporarily Nashvillian, Permanently Phoenician
Staying prepared to move inside and out of season
Hailing from the dust off of 43rd and Thomas
Shipped in shape like a rhombus. Choke the curse and pulled the promise
But Yo! There came a time where I finally recognized
That what God wanted to do that an enemy despised
And as long as he could keep me from a true experience and never ready
He could either steal, kill, or behead me
Tried to hit me with his best shot but not
Somehow avoided being stopped so begun like a Gloc
To be about my Daddy's beeswax, rode the land on camelbacks
I-I had to double check, minimize me so he could max-
Imize the plan, like a lamp take a stand
As I study God's hand as it combs through the sand
And recognize his voice when he speaks in the wilderness
Trekking through the dunes not to deviate off the Syllabus
With my ears open widely slow to speak swift to listen
Had to rid me of myself and not to messy up the mission
The temperature raisin' in the arid zone
To disintegrate the trash that wasn't in its purest form
When in the midst continue praisin' as his prescence seems nearer

But they know they can't deny the like the way it ride

Like disciples on a boat finding fish we boat it, boat it

Who said the girls can't rhyme? Well that's a fable
A female that's a Factor is just as quick to grab the cable
Unless, if best, we rock a show with wireless
Verbalize in the chrome dome into the abyss
Servin' hard not for the money yet divinely employed
Writin' checks by the word that never comes back void
I've ensued to be renewed and navigate through difficulty
Watch him work his wonders in his time he catapults me

I chalk it up as an example of a chance I didn't miss looking back at the past from the future or present tense
As I abide in you, your search my heart for what I needed To survive like you, off every word that had proceeded
I said before I fast slow depending not on bread alone but imitate your character while pursuing to clone
They're brains are veggie if they claim your a tale that's produced even Judy must judge you guilty of nothing but fine fruits
I suppose that's why they journey on hopeless capers they can't figure you out with spare hands and scratch paper
Behold as it was written God the Father sent the gift in His Word became flesh and very breath was you livin' 
We were blessed with the begotten shone the light upon the spot when the scene was looking rotten 
just in time you seemed to pop in... mellow on your entrance, humble record was stainless certified man
Genuine divine simultaneous I live more abundant since IJ gave you my life we're romantically involved and I can constantly survive
The excellency of your name can never be in question you collided with the cross and sealed it all through resurrection
You changed the world with the assignment that had to be finished before I set foot on the earth 
Then all my sins had been diminished. I stand unashamed and bless your name with true gratis 
Counting it gain to be accused as Christ apparatus. How can some turn away from the magnitude of your greatness 
You offer refuge and strength burdens gone while feeling weightless
In the middle of your presence demons shake and get tense to me, Your corner stone to others, rock of offense
You declared me with thoughts I didn't think it was such Now call me righteous your grace is way to much
Think of exchange rates its truly the best offer I confess you before men, you vouch for me before the Father

Knowdaverbs,"I drive not on my own understanding getting
Getting gassed up for advancing
I deflate myself for expanding
Vehicles, we won, be we ride, full on empty

A lot of times I feel not y'all, the mood to write a song
'Cause everything I've kicked around in my head
It feels wrong
I grab a chair, a quiet spot a pen
And empty beat and play it in dire straights
To inscribe this loose leaf

I flip back in my notes to parts I've wrote but never finished
And sew those together in desperate need
For compositions and for known reasons

They never feel too tasty
My word usage is all off and my rhyme pattern is all janky
What ever merry idea started with then I'll divorce it
Then a light bulb pops on, is it God or Verbs trying to force it?

I wanna tune into a song and know it's God without a doubt
And keep my tank full on Christ when my self is emptied out
My job is not to think a million just to figure out a verse
Even in the Bible Belt you hear pants when souls thirst

If we're more commercial than a break in a UPN sitcom
I'd still be held accountable for every line that you hear my voice on
For a car to run at all it must stay gassed up
For me to write at all I need to take the daily task up

Of doing what I need while staying robed
In what I read ain't no harvest to collect
If no farmers will throw no seed although my soul may still say yes
It's a daily thing to wake and knock the mess out the flesh

I drive not on my own understanding, getting
Getting gassed up for advancing
I deflate myself for expanding
Vehicles, we won, be we ride, full on empty

I plans to ride shot gun with my Lord in one accord
There's transportation in his name like Chevy Chase or Harry Ford
'Cause I'd be plain out of luck baking just on what I know
By mind can draw some blanks like karate champs of TaeBo

I exercise his ways I'm fonda' how things work out
His foolishness has been wiser than our strongest of routes
So I surrender all and use the cross as leverage
Trying to scratch the surface of service being poured out beverage

To change my will it cost my life, period, end of story
Do great things in His name so only He receives the glory
To a pessimist an empty glass is just good
For no use an optimist will leave it there
Prepared for full on juice

Obedience keeps you from tickets in zones of speed traps
So His word close and snug tight like wave caps
His sovereignty is like a baby during terms that you're pregnant
'Cause you learn to wait on Him, then you feel it and expect it

The only one in existence is you
No one's resistant to you
You and only you and you
Seem like a dream on the screen
Tantalize and titillate
Video girl of the world

She was slightly dressed
Out to impress, ready to party
Gettin casted for tha club scenes dyin to shake her body
To get on tha set
She compromised for tha dollas
Dancin freaky with tha rappers obsessed with poppin collers
Bought some hair and nails
Found some dudes that rap
While she's rockin tha tiny shorts and tha shirt from baby gap
Misinformed adolescent
She was teenage old
Never told of her inner goal
When she was wrongfully clothed
Just a jewel that got appraised by unqualified guys
They lied, shotload, don't kno her worth in God's eyes
Fellas after tha flesh, they ain't goin' see wat I'm gettin
'Cause they measure every girl by these video women

I'm sick of all they constant bouncin then they say
We disrespectful 'cause we crave em with our instant
Pouncin the money drive em to mishaps and under
They thongs lie decay and collapse no morals perhaps
The scenery's pretty the suns shining it's nice out
A pretty girl freakin on a pimp who'd knock her lights out

Gangsta with gold fronts and the girl he's advancin on
Would rather run him over with the truck she's dancing on
And he'd be hurt up pretty badly I must say word up
It ain't over bone is third up
Don't debate it I know they hate being affiliated
To this world they created with facades that leave you devastated

The glamorous life price for your souls rest
Simple mentality in a world complex
Star studded reality 5 minutes or less
Broken dreams and ambitions lost with respect
She was an innocent queen with rubber bands and berets
Young diva runnin things commanding every step
Then the pace picked up and she learned to be fast
Short skirt tight clothes good spirit turned bad
Hollywood caught a glimpse of your beauty untamed
At the cost you played whatever price you paid
Through away your identity even changed your name
In your world of fame child you need to be shamed
In tha world of fame

I'mma tell you a little story
'Bout our past (past, past)

Früher hatte ich nichts, ja, wir hatten nicht viel
Mama hat gesagt, du erreichst dein Ziel
Wenn du nicht aufgibst, also trau dich
Aber wenigstens hast du es probiert
Mein Sohn, flieg weit, weit
Weg von hier, flieg weit, weit
Weg von hier, flieg weit, weit
Weg von hier, aber wenigstens hast du es probiert

Nachts auf das Dach, uns're Stadt war am Glänzen
Grenzen gab's nicht, als Kids schon Rebell'n
Uns're Denkweise war zu oft: Fick diese Welt
AP, von Hip-Hop-Jam zu Hip-Hop-Jam
Ich saß im Zug und lernte Hip Hop kenn'
Kein Geld, broke, früh aus dem Elternhaus raus
Mein Plan war, Ich komm zurück und bau ein Traumhaus
Falsch gedacht, falsch gedacht
Bekam 'ne Wohnung ohne Strom, es war kalt und nass
Vergesse nie den Kühlschrank, der jeden Tag leer war
Köln-Kalk, Hungersnot, jede Nacht schmerzhaft
Kaltes Wasser, Teekerzen leuchten
Lieber Gott, was soll das alles hier bedeuten?
Ein Leben zwischen kriminellen Freunden
Das war nicht die Vision aus meinen Träumen
Und in Berlin war's vielleicht ein Stück besser
Doch ganz bestimmt kein Glückstreffer
Ja, Gott hat mich hier hingeführt und wieder weggebracht
Durch das finst're Tal, doch ich hab's echt geschafft

Her only answer is one little smile,

She's funny that way.

End it all and let her go to some better man;

A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew

From my tender sentimental woes

A prelude to a kiss

Nothing much

A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies

Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

I was grateful to be working but say my back is hurtin'
I don't think it's the purpose, no this can't be the call

Take a hit of my J, I'm in flight
Closing my eyes visioning in Monte Carlos with tinted windows and balling legitimate
Open my eyes I was in the same predicament
The next day I called in; said ""I quit""

I'm jumping the wall, raising the ball
Taking no bullshit
You and me have to get bigger

Other bitch was too corny
My routine, fixing turkey and cheese
Now I got a new broad who can run and cook for me
Couldn't tell a nigga nothing, she couldn't do wrong
Had my nose wide open I could sniff a cue-ball
Tenderoni, taking all of my time
It's the power of the P-U-S-S-Y, ain't that right
Split up the bank, gave her all of my change
Coppin' diamonds and rings
I can't lie
Stomach to leave
She said, ""Music or me?""
The fuck do you mean, this ain't right
Closing my eyes visioning
Living with this bitch could end up giving me instant misery
Open my eyes, she was kissing my constituent
I threw that bitch off the cliff

Kobe,"Ayo, before I start this song man
I just wanna, thank everybody for being so patient
And bearing with me over these last couple of years
While I figure this shit out

Is anybody out there? It feels like I'm talking to myself
No one seems to know my struggle, and everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me? Yeah, I guess I keep talking to myself
It feels like I'm going insane, am I the one whose crazy?
(So why in the world, do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there, who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear just so I know that I'm not the only one)

I went away I guess and opened up some lanes
But there was no one who even knew I was going through, growing pains
Hatred was flowing through my veins, on the verge of going insane
I almost made a song dissing Lil Wayne
It's like I was jealous of him 'cause of the attention he was gettin'
I felt horrible about myself, he was spittin'
And I wasn't, anyone who was buzzin' back then coulda got it
Almost went at Kanye too,
God it feels like I'm going psychotic, thank God that I didn't do it
I'da had my ass handed to me, and I knew it
But Proof isn't here to see me through it
I'm in the booth, popping another pill, tryna talk myself into it
Are you stupid? You're gon' start dissing people for no reason?
'Specially when you can't even write a decent punchline even?
You're lying to yourself, you're slowly dying
You're denying your health is declining with your self-esteem
You're crying out for help

Marshall you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow
All I know is I'm wallowing, self-loathing and hollow
Bottoms up on the pill bottle, maybe I'll hit my bottom tomorrow
My sorrow echoes in this hall though
But I must be talking to the wall though I don't see nobody else 
(I guess I keep talking to myself)
But all these other rappers suck is all that I know
I've turned into a hater, I put up a false bravado
But Marshall is not an egomaniac, that's not his motto
He's not a desperado, he's desperate, his thoughts are bottled
Inside him, one foot on the brake, one on the throttle
Falling asleep with writer's block in the parking lot of McDonald's
But instead of feeling sorry for yourself do something 'bout it
Admit you got a problem, your brain is clouded, you pouted
Long enough, it isn't them it's you you fucking baby
Quit worrying 'bout what they do and do Shady, I'm fucking going crazy

So I picked myself off the ground and fucking swam 'fore I drowned
Hit my bottom so hard I bounced twice, suffice, this time around
It's different, them last two albums didn't count
Encore I was on drugs, Relapse I was flushing 'em out
I've come to make it up to ya now, no more fucking around
I got something to prove to fans 'cause I feel like I let 'em down
So please accept my apology, I finally feel like I'm back to normal
I feel like me again, let me formally
Reintroduce myself to you for those of you who don't know
The new me's back to the old me and homie I don't show no
Signs of slowing up, oh and I'm blowing up 
All over my life is no longer a movie but the show ain't over homos
I'm back with a vengeance homie, Weezy keep ya head up
T.i. Keep ya head up, Kanye keep ya head up, don't let up
Just keep slaying 'em, rest in peace to DJ AM
'Cause I know what it's like 
I struggle with this shit every single day and um

Is anybody out there? It feels like I'm talking to myself

So there it is, damn
Feels like I just woke up or something
I guess I just, forgot who the fuck I was man
Ayo, and to anybody I thought about going at
It was never nothing personal
It was just some shit I was going through
And to everybody else. I'm back! Ha ha",Talkin' 2 Myself,2010
Kobe,"Maybe it started with Slaughterhouse, or was it tour life?
Maybe it wouldn’t had started at all if I had your life
Maybe it was needed or was I thinking immorally
If I wasn’t myself could I say I gave the fans All of Me?
Can’t decide if I’m more ashamed of what they saw of me
Than I am of ignoring all the lessons that was taught to me
Headed up field but couldn’t dodge the last tackler
How could a forward thinker move so ass backwards?
How could a dude with no regrets at all, willing to bet it all
Not realize that quicker demise, how could I neglect it all?
I’m so seasonal, some of y'all knew I'd spring back
With a heart this cold, how'd y'all think I’d be receptive to fall
I’m plenty comfortable when danger’s around
And even more so when strangers around
And the bigger picture is sicker, don't know my triggers or know the alarm it forces
Don't know a nigga, don't know my bouts with drugs and liquor or the harm it causes
Life or death? I tried to lynch myself
Thought I could keep it all a secret, I convinced myself
But really, the folk that loved me, they could tell I was locin'
I couldn’t see him, cry me a river cause it fell in the ocean
Numb to my words now, maybe felt I was open
I cut so many people loose, do I need help with devotion?
That’s just some of the things I ask my Lord and Savior
And when He calls for me, will He have done us all a favor?

How did I make it here?
Who are y'all?
I feel so lost
Now I’m not seeing it clear
Is it my fault?
It’s all in my head

I’m looking around like this can’t be happening
Round of applause for the angry rappers
Lord, my girl cried me a flood than me a river
That’s love, depending on me when I’m a dependent on liquor
I’m up in the shoe store, she got no love to show
You ever look at a bitch you was fucking behind your bitch back
Like fuck I was fucking you for?
I’m an artist so I’m intelligent
I would tell you to do some soul searching
But it’s hanging up in my closet with your skeleton
It’s gotta be a God's work, even a diamond gotta be polished first
A quarter's on the loose and I ain’t been out here getting my dollars’ worth
I had to remove the goggles first
To see through the sipping Patrón and fifty phoners for I need to go get me a kidney donor
Guru, Nate Dogg, go ahead blink a eye
The doctor told me you close, go 'head drink and die
Buried under the stone where the Patrón fifth sits by
That reads ""Here lies somebody who never wanted to be this guy""

How did I make it here?
Who are y'all?
I feel so lost
Now I’m not seeing it clear
Is it my fault? (It go)
It’s all in my head (look)

They say knowledge is power, great 'cause every day I learn
As of late been having revelations bout this hate term
Hate the way they judged me, till I got the case adjourned
Hated the belly of the beast till I became its tapeworm
When I said I’d stop getting high, tried to say it stern
Though I’m the type to walk through the fire to check the way it burn
They say my brain is off, I say how can it be?
If I’m out my mind, how can I be in-sanity?
The people used to say that I was scared of progress
They don’t know how hard a nigga tried to advance
But I don’t know who’s more to blame, is it them for really not knowing me
Or is it me for never really giving them a chance?
Get too close, be too big of a threat
Now I spend little to no time, thinking why I ain’t get rid of you yet
Gotta recognize my maturity, gotta see I’m grown
Let all my skeletons out the closet, just so I'd never be alone
Since I got trust issues I won’t discuss with you
Besides God tell me who the fuck’s supposed to save you
Pop won't have a man to man, was gone half my life so
Somewhere in his head probably feel it ain't his place to
Plus more people will see me soon, I mean I’ll be on national TV soon
So when I ask if people I have around are a cancer for me
That’s four million more that might be able to answer for me, Joey

You said you're moving on
But I'm having some trouble getting there
But dwelling ain't getting me, uhh, anywhere
Fuckin' Valentine's Day
Fuck February, stuffed teddy bear, guts everywhere
Machete on the floor, I smashed up every mirror
Yeah, how do I look?
You fuckin' just let me here to die didn't you?
Why didn't you respond yet?
I've written you five or six different times and
I'm gettin' sick and tired of always apologizing to you
I didn't do shit to deserve what you're puttin' me through
This couldn't be true, we can't be over
So violets are blue, roses are red
Why is it everything I do I'm reminded of you?

Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointing toward the light
Saw my old sweetheart she said, ""honey, I'm back""
Just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone

Guess I gotta deal with the fact that, you ain't never comin' back
Now every woman that I look at I'm lookin' for you
So I'm findin' something the matter with them
Excuse to not see anyone
Useless, rather pick up the phone, not at all, followin' protocol
I get bowled like bowling balls
Grow balls and go to call to talk, forget what I want to say
Damnit I'm drawin' blanks like I'm playin' hangman
I'm sick of playin' these games, I can't handle this heartbreak
It's makin' me wanna blow out my brains
Like birthday cake candles
Hang up the phone and I shake, I think I may have made a mistake
Can't escape the madness
Turn the radio on, I hate this sad song
But I can't even change the station
The same one's playin' on eight channels
I lay awake in shambles, I'm startin to hallucinate
I'm havin' all these visions of us at each other's wakes
In caskets and suddenly I wake and that's when I know I

Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointing toward the light
Saw my old sweetheart she said, ""honey, I'm back""
Just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone

Give me one more, bottle for the pain
Give me one more for the memories
Give me one more, I'll make it taste like a steak
It'll help alleviate
It'll soothe this ache
Of trying to fake
That she's really, she's really coming back

And it's been a while now, but I finally realize how
Much reality sucks, but it's just something about our love
I'm still in denial now, dealing with the finality of it
And it's making me crazy thinking of the days we, spent
And how I'll never hold you again
And there ain't shit I can do about it
Now my head is overcrowded
With these clouded memories and I can't seem to get you out it
And how the fuck do you sleep comfortably
Knowing what you done did to me, huh?
Did it even occur to you that I loved you, humbly
Completely, madly, head over heels for you
Was you and me, wants us to be together forever
It was supposed to be us, but you crushed the dream
We was supposed to die together, and it's killing me so much
When I sleep I wake up dead, must be why I

When I'm broken, you know how to fix it
You know how to check me with the quickness
Anytime I made you mad and pissed you off
Talking back to you when I thought I was wrong
You showed me how to shake off the drama

You would even hide the gun for me after lickin' shots
Said a prayer for me everyday, when I hit the block
Used to make me sweep the hallway, then I get the mop
Punishment when I fail, new sneaks when I pass
Only child so I had two feet in my ass

All I want is peas and rice, collard greens, corn bread
Finger lickin' good, dead broke or mucho dinero

At nights we ran down with them sticks and got them automobiles
And we was jackin' cars and shit 'cause it wasn't hard to steal
Like doin' bids and seeing it come but this the life I live
But I know that this my last one, something gotta give
Seem like God, got me paying for all the shit I did
'Cause I slowed down a while ago, switched up positive
The rough was just enough for a nigga fell in love with the thrill
But before he forgive gotta pay for a steel
And I done did so much of shit that I ain't proud I did
But when I took rappin' serious I threw the towel in
But Lord you say you gon' forgive, so forgive me then
'Cause I done picked the Bible up and read Corinthians
I'm still young and I got a lot to experience
I guess the first time in my life I felt this serious
I gotta lil' boy now and I wanna be there for bruh
