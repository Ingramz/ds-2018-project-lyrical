Stitched Up Heart,"I am surrounded by the darkness
Got caught by gravity
This atmosphere is grabbing me oh
Torn apart by all the madness
Starting to pick up speed
I can't break free

Catch me when I fall
Before I've lost it all
When everything comes down
Crashing all around
Catch me when I fall
Blinded by the light
Crashing through the sky
Like a meteorite
So catch me when I fall (fall, fall, fall, fall)

Chipping away, scraping the surface
And every piece of me
Sheds for all the world to see oh
Through all of this I feel so helpless
I see the ground beneath or so it seems

Catch me when I fall
Before I've lost it all
When everything comes down
Crashing all around
Catch me when I fall
Blinded by the light
Crashing through the sky
Like a meteorite
So catch me when I fall (fall, fall, fall, fall)
So catch me when I fall (fall, fall, fall, fall)

Oh I, I am weak
I could break
Oh so delicate
Crushed by the weight of the pain
I could break

I, I am weak
I could break
Oh so delicate crushed by the weight of the pain
I could break
Crushing down like rocks
Crushing rocks
Crushing down like rocks

Catch me when I fall
Before I've lost it all
When everything comes down
Crashing all around
Catch me when I fall
Blinded by the light
Crashing through the sky
Like a meteorite
So catch me when I fall (fall, fall, fall, fall)
So catch me when I fall (fall, fall, fall, fall)",Catch Me When I Fall,2016
Stitched Up Heart,"Now don't you make me
Make me go crazy!
I'll be your lover
You want no other
You wanna take me?
I know you want to
You wanna break me?
Are you ready to go?
There's a monster deep inside of me
I'll rip you to pieces, don't try to save me
Nothing can turn me down

Don't you mistake me
To such a sweet thing
That just a warning
The damage I can bring
Are you going to take me away?
I'm a monster locked in a cage

There's a monster deep inside of me
I'll rip you to pieces, don't try to save me
Nothing can turn me down
Bring out the monster
It breaths inside of me
There's nothing to run to
Don't try to break me
Nothing can hold me down

I've been locked up in a cage
And I will scape
There's a monster

There's a monster deep inside of me

Stitches,"It ain't me, there's gotta be more to choose from

Stiv Bators,"Your lies and decieving diplomats
Can't reach me where I'm hiding at
You'll find you have no powers over me
I'm in a place where no one's been

It's free of greed and all your sin
And weapons that are lying to your mirror
I want to forget you just the way you are
So I won't be lonely here without you near
('Cause I can't afford your tears)

Late night high rise blocks of cold
With burgess growing gracefully old
T.V patterns glow where I must go
Dark creaking floorboards changing walls

I'm shaking in the chill of t.o. noon

Laughs at the poise 'n arrow change I'm in

Stiv Bators,"When I get the nerve to walk on by
They come and get me
I never told the truth, I never lied
They listened to me

All the times I laughed at her
She never said a single word to me
Cause she knew me
Well I can't waste my time

Make up your mind
I lost determination fast
I was the loser
Getting sick of finishing last

I'm always the loser

I'm gonna ask the questions why
But I... can't decide

Stiv Bators,"Uniforms of catholic girls
Give me such a great big thrill
Achieving airlocks the only way to think
Hollywood high school yards
Makes my bag of candy hard
Got a ball point pecker loaded with inedible ink
And I'm ready anytime
Call me day or night
Waiting over here for you
Cause I'm ready anytime
Sitting in my hotel room
With ecstatic elastic tickle your womb
It's a corduroy condom
A groovy kind of love
Now I'm not afraid to die
Cause I know there's sex after death
Everyone gets laid in coffin
Am I right? right!!

Stiv Bators,"(Justin Hayward)
I've been thinking about our fortune,
And I've decided that we're really not to blame.
For the love that's deep inside us now,
Is still the same.
And the sound we make together,
Is the music to the story in your eyes.
It's been shining down upon me now,
I realize.
Listen to the tide slowly turning,
Wash all our heartaches away.
We are part of the fire that is burning,
And from the ashes we can build another day.
But I'm frightened for your children,
And the life that we are living is in vain.
And the sunshine we've been waiting for,
Will turn to rain.
When the final line is over,
And it's certain that the curtain's gonna fall.
I can hide inside your sweet sweet love,
For ever more.
Listen to the tide slowly turning,
Wash all our heartaches away.
We are part of the fire that is burning,
And from the ashes we can build another day.
But I'm frightened for your children,
And the life that we are living is in vain.
And the sunshine we've been waiting for,
Will turn to rain.

Helpless child, gonna walk a drum beat behind

Never let you laugh or smile, not you
I just want to walk right out of this world
'Cause everybody has a poison heart
I just want to walk right out of this world
'Cause everybody has a poison heart
Making friends with a homeless torn up man
He just kind of smiles, it really, shakes me up
There's danger on, every corner but I'm okay

I just want to walk right out of this world
'Cause everybody has a poison heart

Stoa,"Be near me when my light is low.
When the blood creeps and the nerves prick
And tongle, and the heart is sick,
And all the wheels of beeing slow.

Be near me when the sensous frame
Is racked with pangs that conquer trust,
And time a maniac, scattering dust,
And life, a fury, slinging flame.

Be near me when my faith is dry,
And men the flies of latter spring,
That lay their eggs, and sting and sing,
And weave their petty cells and die.

Be near me when I fade away,
To point the term of human strife.
And on the low dark verge of life
The twilight of eternal day.

[Alfred Lord Tennyson]

The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart

Thinks I'm trashy and no good

Smile at them and bat my eyes
Press against them when we dance
Make them think they stand a chance
Then refuse to see it through
That's a thing I'd never do

I could stay home every night
Wait around for Mr.Right
Take cold showers every day
And throw my life away
On a dream that won't come true

I could hurt someone like me
Out of spite or jealousy
I don't steal and I don't lie
But I can feel and I can cry
A fact I'll bet you never knew
But to cry in front of you

And I nearly died from hospitality
Left me stranded, took away my pride

Stokley,"I started rhyming just to be somebody
To make people notice me at the party
And not just be the new kid that's albino
Make em say yeah I know but have you heard him rhyme though
Now take that same party around the globe
And my stories connected with a lot of folks
I hope so cause that's the only thing I know
I know it so well I tell it with my eyes closed
And I go with the feeling from the start
Blind in the eye so I see you with my heart
And to me all ya'll look exactly the same fear faith compassion and pain
And try as we may to mask it remains
Such as your religion or your past and your race
The same color blood just pass through our veins
And tears taste the same when they splash on your face
The worlds getting too small to stand in one place
Its like we're roommates just sharing a space
Can't separate and still carry the weight
Gotta heal get away from the fear and the hate
Gotta shake free from the chains
You see what remains
Just a human being end of the day
Don't matter to me what name you gave your spiritual plane
Close your eyes and you'll see what I'm saying
I started rhyming just to be somebody
Found out that I already was
Cause can't nobody be free unless we're all free
There's no me and no you its just us

And just when they thought 
That everything was peachy keen
Somewhere deep within the shadows
There were other things to be seen
An untamable beast with an urge to feast
And only alone would he stand, 
the culprit of fear on the 67th tear
There lies, the boogie man.

No introduction needed
N9ne times you must repeat it

I'm N9ne, who supposed to be this rough MC
Who's glutton-ny would rhyme grime,

Odd tech would get respect when he wreck the set
But never get the props that was god blessed
So this is me, never let the prod rest
The object of rawness inject your steps to darkness
Led the industry to whispering the name
History became a mystery
'cause listeners in the game
Wish to sing the same
Which cerebral glitch will lead to lane
And this will be your pit
For me to split and bleed your brain
They heard the name
But can't put a face to it,

And when he stands still, he turn to lanes
From sane to straight wicked, don't tell me you ain't heard the saying

Trapped inside your head
you tried to fight it

This webs a tangled weave
Laughter inside you,
Tries 'n' blind you,
From that boogieman.
An in that voice you hear
'Eliminate your fears'
What do you do?
Discover the truth
That is The Boogieman
And now you know it's real
And everything you feel
Hits you again, you will stand

And I'm the shadow in the dark
That came for battlin' in the park
And they skidaddled when I barked
That give a rattle to their hearts
'Cause they're afraid they will all fail

J'allume le premier splif de la journée - Aaah !!!
J'descends au sous-sol

Vive le BM cabriolet, retour de vol
Et je décolle, j'ai le monopole
C'est moi qui contrôle

C'est la brigade des stups
Et mes forces décuplent

T'inventes des poursuites, des histoires avec les keufs

STOMY EST LE PRINCE DES LASCARS (4 fois)

Dans le hit parade des embuscades, je suis classé
Mes ennemis le savent, je suis dur à choper et à clamser
Puis-je avoir un témoin que j'ai décapsulé,
Avalé et fait tellement kiffer
Qu'elle plaide à la barre
Pourtant je n'suis pas une star
Tu piges, qui suis-je ?

Mon calibre, du gros gibier
Pour m'avoir, faut des balles pour sangliers

Juste des rates gonflées comme yoyo
Qui bougent leur big bonda précieux comme un panda
Les mecs s'mettent à bander

Stomy Bugsy,"Mes baskets blanches, mes locks, l'encre a coulé comme le Trois Rivières 
Au fond des blocs, enfants des îles, fils d'une classe ouvrière 
L'idole des jeunes, Doc restera le même de Porte de la Chapelle, aux ondes hertziennes 

À l'heure où le monde se bouscule 
Je repasse ma vie à l'envers 
J'en ai fait des rêves, des calculs 
J'ai jamais voulu vraiment me laisser faire (jamais, jamais, jamais, jamais)

Et le temps passe, non je ne regrette rien (non rien de rien, je ne regrette rien) 
Rien ne s'efface, mon destin me ressemble bien (nos rêves, nos poings ont guidé nos refrains)
Et le temps passe, pourtant, je ne regrette rien (non rien de rien, je ne regrette rien)
La moindre trace, je l'ai bâtie de mes mains (mes rêves, nos poings, ont guidé nos destins) 

Mes baskets blanche, mon RER, l'encre a coulé dans ma carrière 
À temps plein, viser le haut, contemple mon temple est légendaire 
Mon air A.M.E.R, mon teint, mes rêves sont restés les mêmes 
J'ai tant porté le flambeau, représenté l'honneur des miens 

Mes baskets blanches, ma grande gueule, de l'encre sur les mains
Mon stylo était meurtri et coupable ennemi numéro un
Entre merde et pertes blanches, j'ai le goût pour la revanche
Boxeur, breakeur, rappeur, acteur, attitude franche 

J'ai chanté les Hommes, leurs désirs 
Les destins fragiles et l'amour (je suis né dans la rue)
On a voulu que j' tombe sur place 
Moi, j'ai souvent fait face et je combats toujours (le combat continue)

Et le temps passe, non je ne regrette rien (non rien de rien, je ne regrette rien)

Des burnes dans le froc 
Fusion guitares et pe-ra pour civils et colboques

Aussi burnés qu'un keuf sous Sarkozy 
Liberté dans ma musique et l'savoir comme Uzi 
Baskets blanches et blousons noirs, génération, manque d'espoir 
Exempté de conneries, que ce gardien me foute la paix 
Lascars abandonnés, j'ai le rêve des cités dortoirs 
Mon rap tout-terrain, mon R.T.T, c'est ça qui est la vérité 

L'être humain porte en lui le meilleur (ouais) 
Je sens encore le poids de mes erreurs, de mes erreurs (ouais)
Le pire a si souvent été là 
La peine guidait mes pas mais je la garde au fond de moi (jusqu'au dernier souffle)

Et le temps passe, non je ne regrette rien (non rien de rien, je ne regrette rien) 
Non, rien ne s'efface, mon destin me ressemble bien (nos rêves, nos poings ont guidé nos refrains)
Et le temps passe, pourtant, je ne regrette rien (non rien de rien, je ne regrette rien)

We got Baby, Lac and Stone
In this bitch

I'm a neighborhood superstar
I'll cook anything from a ki of coke
To a gram of that boyd
Niggas scoring glocks
Like brand new Hot Boy Reeboks
On my blocks stepping 'em up
With grams and rocks
If anything been scoring from me
It was ten a ki
I let my l'il round hustle
As long as they score for me

[Lac]
Look if I pull up on the block
Knowing the set was mine
No more hand-to-hand contact
I'm known for supplying
Since I opened up this set 'chere
This how it's gon' be
Ain't nobody selling shit nigga
Unless it's for me

[Baby]
All I know is crack slanging and block hanging
On the corner [in] front the store
Doing my thang
These niggas know my game
How I do my thang
Water whip I can't do
But whole thangs I slang

[Lac]
Now I'ma pay all my foot soldiers
And tell 'em stay focused
And front all the street hustlers
And keeping 'em posted
That white and that blue car
We call 'em the law
And the dirt that my niggas do
Is done in the dark

[Baby]
Got l'il whodie running water 
And we 'bout to cook these quarters
The twenty under the seat
For my son and my daughter
The water hot enough
Start cooking these quarters
These niggas want it hard
And I understand

[Lac]
If I pull up dressed in all black
With a boot in my mouth
Cause a nigga didn't pay 'Lac
And I know that he sold out
Put something in my street sweeper
And run in his house
Knock a hole up out his pa chest
And a tongue out his ma mouth

A ki stashed up
And I'm gettin' 'em all
I got a stash put up 
For the drought in the fall

Ghetto rich money stashed
In the mansions bruh
I got them kis
Ten a ki from Fresh and Atrice bruh

Cadillac's the name I run with
So call me Seville

Ain't nobody pulling strangs here
Unless that I pull it
If a nigga put a hit out
Believe that I took it
In the cost Bible murders
Was ODing and bullets

And lived to sang it

And then wait on her pa

Still buy up the bulk

And the ghetto streets

I sport Prowlers, whips
With the T.V.s playing

I'll pull up at Washington [and] Six
In a six
I'll slide out quick
Bet I could fuck any bitch

[Lac]
I push a lavender Porsche Carerra
Seat sprayed leather
The top goes off and on
To floss with the rainy weather
The seats they ain't customized
They made by Ricarro
A ruby red CF5
I'll cop by tomorrow

[Baby]
For catching me on the interstate drunk
Running the law
With a bitch in my lap
Tasting my balls
I don't like when they too much
Act like they stuck up
Leave Atrice nut up
I'll bat that bitch up

[Stone]
The king of the Nolia
I crowd both the wrists
Lock down slanging towns
Took the top off the six
In the club I be thugged
With ten topless chicks
T-shirt, Girbauds, Reeboks
In it

Off top, can't pop this bitch

Lot-dah-dah-dah (lot-dah-dah-dah)
Lot-in-dah-dah-dah

Someone opened up a closet door and out stepped johnny b. goode
Playing guitar like a-ringin' a bell and lookin' like he should
If you gotta play at garden parties, i wish you a lotta luck
But if memories were all i sang, i rather drive a truck

She's an artist, she don't look back
She's got everything she needs
She's an artist, she don't look back
She can take the dark out of the night time
And paint the daytime black

You may start out standing
Proud to steal her anything she sees
You can start out standing
Proud to steal her anything she sees
But you will wind up peeking
Through her keyhole upon your knees

She never stumbles
She's got no place to fall
She never stumbles
She's got no place to fall
She's nobody's child
The law can't touch her at all

Salute her when her birthday comes

For Christmas, give her a drum

There's no reason for goodbyes,

I won't let you go with nothing to show but more blues,
And all this talk about leaving is strictly bad news,
So you settle down and stay with the man that loves you.

Down the Stoney End
Mama let me start all over
Cradle me, Mama, cradle me again

With love light in his eyes

Cradle me, mama, cradle me again

'Cause the furry and the broken thunders
Come to match my raging soul

Translucent flesh and feeble bones,
The kind of temple where the whores and villains try to tempt the holistic tomes.
Running rampid with free thought to free form, and the free and clear.
When the matters at hand are shelled out like lint at a
Laundry mat to sift and focus on the bigger, better, now.

We all have a little sin that needs venting,
Virtues for the rending and laws and systems and stems are ripped
From the branches of office, do you know where your post entails? 
Do you serve a purpose, or purposely serve?
When in doubt inside your atavistic allure, the value of a summer spent, 
And a winter earned.

For the rest of us, there is always Sunday.
The day of the week the reeks of rest, but all we do is catch our breath,
So we can wade naked in the bloody pool, and place our hand on the big, black book.
To watch the knives zigzag between our aching fingers.
A vacation is a countdown, T minus your life and
Counting, time to drag your tongue across the sugar cube,
And hope you get a taste.

What the fuck is all this for?
What the hell's going on? Shut up!
I can go on and on but lets move on, shall we?

Say, your me, and I'm you, and they all watch the things we do,
And like a smack of spite they threw me down the stairs,
Haven't felt like this in years.

The great magnet of malicious magnanimous refuse, let me go,
And punch me into the dead spout again.
That's where you go when there's no one else around,
It's just you, and there was never anyone to begin with, now was there?

And a finger on the trigger.

So you fed me shit to digest

my flaws are open season

That we have given to another false prophet?
Can you give us all a reason not to fall 
Before you take away another broken promise?
Show your pretty face
Hide the bitter taste
You're still the rapist of an entire nation
You wanna be the man? 
You gotta be a man
But you are nothing but a sad insinuation

How can we ever live this down?

Keep your fingers crossed, the truth is at a loss
Big decision for an ordinary coward
The only problem is your fuckin' rhetoric
We're more in danger than before you took power
Now it's just a game
God, you'll never change
You'd sell us out if you could only find a buyer
You don't give a shit
As long as idiots are in your corner, you could set us all on fire

How can we ever live this down?

You never wanted to be, they only wanted a parody
You want the world to be free?
What the hell is free about it?

Now we've reached the end, just get it over with
But this is building to an adamant conclusion
Come whatever may, there's gonna be a day
When we have figured out a plausible solution
Everything you've done is killing everyone
A little smile on a homicidal bastard
You wanna be the man? 
You better have a plan
Another failure is a guaranteed disaster

How can we ever live this down?

Stone Sour,"What a waste of life this is, 
Every altercation I permit is
Like a quiet sigh
From a man resigned 
To a place that was never his
And the hours are long, 
Even in a world where I belong
Every second stays, 
Every minute counts against my sentence

I fall I had to let you go

What I tried to accomplish died 
Every offer of faith I had
To fight and a dream unfolds
The moon is cold 
Because the sun left early
And the days go by, 
Even when my conscience just won't try
Every week decays, 
Every month is rotten
I am forgotten

I fall, I had to let you go
I fall, my mind is all I know
I fall, the table turns to dust
I fall, today, I let go of my trust

What a waste of time I am, 
Every ounce of life is
Just dead flesh
I can't forget, 
But then again you can't let me remember
When I try to speak, 
Every word I say comes out so bleak
I don't want this, 
I don't want you
But I don't want anyone
I don't want anyone

I fall, I had to let you go
I fall my mind is all I know
I fall, the table turns to dust
I fall, today, I let go of my trust
I let go of my trust",The Day I Let Go [*],2006
Stone Sour,"My face is horrid and I'm constantly slouching
My place is lower so I'm constantly crouching
I don't believe it, I saw the man again
And he won't hear a word I say

I have delusions so I'm constantly shouting
I have compulsions so I'm constantly counting
I don't believe it, there goes my world again
And I don't understand a word I say

Just because I'm paranoid it doesn't mean I'm annoyed and
Just because I'm not prepared doesn't mean I'm not aware

The smoke is infinite, I'm constantly panting
The truth is imminent, I'm constantly ranting
I don't believe it, I took a chance again and
People I don't know won't let it go

I've got some problems, I'm constantly bitching
I've got some rashes I'm constantly itching
I don't believe it, forgot the pills again
I just woke up a million miles from home

Just because I seem sedate it doesn't mean I'm not irate and
Just because I'm not immune it doesn't mean I'm scared of you

Just because I'm incomplete it doesn't mean I'm obsolete and
Just because I'm out of view it doesn't mean I'm not like you",Freeze Dry Seal [*],2006
Stone Sour,"The girls on the streets look all sad 
In this gold encrusted little town
Why is that? Isn't this the town of dreams?
Yeah, but it comes with a price

It's a town that never does anything and takes all the credit
A place that promises so much and never has a thing to say
Or a care in the world
There is no memory here
No dream for itself but the dreams of others

And all over the world you talk 
About a place you've only seen in the re-runs
Immortalized by its vice and deified for its carnage

There's money in the air there
All you have to do is reach up and grab it

In basements, garages, parking lots, 
Empty lots, school yards, town cars,
Back rooms and more
Diamonds are fashioned from expectations 
And fortified on a steady diet,
Of simple lives and red carpets

The ejaculating zeitgeist in night vision
Culture is a punch line in a motionless blood in the water
The sharks here play games you can't fathom
But you flock here anyway

On college money and credit cards 
Spend a week bullshitting yourself that it was all true,

All of it
Just to watch in horror as it all falls 
Into pieces into the gravity of reality
The starry eyes fade as it dawns on you,
Nothing is guaranteed

You are a part of the great divide, the chosen, or the frozen
Now your miles away without an egg, 
Your college money is a collage of debt
And your credit cards are all snapped in fucking half

Time to wander a landscape in berethed of mercy 
This is now the back lot of your failed movie
A waking dream re-written without your permission
The real luster, the soft focus, the soap opera vision
Is just the hindsight of a world who's just been lied to
Of sad surfs, and untouchable lords

You took a chance didn't you?
The chance didn't have a par for you this time around
Maybe next life

And you can't even walk home

The girls on the street all look sad 
In this cardboard cut-out little town
No wonder, that's the only thing here that's real
The gold is for fools and paradise is lost
But the hungry have never bothered with the cost

Day by day they fall away like rose petals
Like ink that won't dry or fade
It just runs wild down cracks and crevices, grooves and folds
So I hope someone saves you, before you get cold
I really do

Because the girls are on set in this little black book

If you can?",The Frozen [*],2006

There was a dead rat caught in a Chinese trap
And all I had to show
Where the ashes of a life that had no chance
It wasn't right, but all I could do
Was be another number that caught in the fuse

Something happened in nineteen-eighty-two

Are you the enemy?
Let me show you what you did to me

Once I get away from here
I know its gonna be my time

I don't want yours I just want mine

I'm never alone
I'm always in the middle talking to myself
And all I want to know
Am I really on the road, I just can't tell
It isn't right
But all I can do is take it to a level where I can't refuse
Its a lie
I need you to see
Let me show you what you did to me

Once I get away from here
I know its gonna be my time
I've seen to much to keep me here
I don't want yours I just want mine
Before I get away from here
I think I better set you straight
I know my place is miles from here
You'll never understand to make my fate

Deep down there's a Devil inside
He can make you give up everything
Settle if you want to die
Or you can live for a world that must be free

Oh, once I get away from here
I know its gonna be my time
I've seen too much to keep me here
I don't want yours, I just want mine
Before I get away from here
I think I better set you straight
I know my place is miles from here
You'll never understand to make my fate

I'm just too bored for normal views
Be careful of what you wish for
Impossible to just ignore
One last time is all I need
To get my life and stocks in order
They're on the rise this quarter
Beware of certain friends
Who sell you out when everything is free
I know what I am to all of you
And I've got all these other things to do
To do

Open up and know enough I'm overused
Everyone I've ever loved is easily amused
Go ahead and tell the dead it's only you
But I am much too old
I am much too old
I am much too old now

Imagine this chaos theory
Makes all the profits leery
Somebody's showing them the ropes
We used to hang ourselves with
Instead of quiet respite
We choose the noose in lieu of hope
Oh rose red, oh violent blue
I should've seen the clues but
This song is dumb and so am I
Character assassinations
Are really observations
Stay home and ask yourself
Why am I so low when I'm so high
So high

Open up and know enough I'm overused
Everyone I've ever loved is easily amused
Go ahead and tell the dead it's only you
But I am much too old
I am much too old
I am much too old now

Yeah
Come on

Open up and know enough I'm overused
Everyone I've ever loved is easily amused
Go ahead and tell the dead it's only you

There's so much God can teach you

What does God look like?
And angels' wings?

It's all right cause what goes around, comes around

Stone the Crows,"Day after day
Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Stonebolt,"Love 'em and leave 'em
Give them the air
Hurt and deceive them
Say you don't care

Break their hearts and let them fall
Like rain on your back stairs
Then call me up tomorrow
You know I'll still be there

When the moon disappears forever
And the sun shines electric blue
And the mountains and trees tumble into the sea
To rest there for eternity

No matter what you do
I will still love you

So if all your bridges go up in flames
And if all your lovers strike you too tame
Or some sad song of love you hear
Can make you call my name

I will be there in a minute
And you know I'll feel the same

When the moon disappears forever
And the sun shines electric blue
And the mountains and trees tumble into the sea
To rest there for eternity

No matter what you do
I will still love you

So the weary traveler
Tired of passing through
Stops to get his bearings
And stays on to wait for you

When the moon disappears forever
And the sun shines electric blue
And the mountains and trees tumble into the sea
To rest there for eternity 

No matter what you do 
I will still love you
I will still love you",I Will Still Love You,1978
Stonebridge,"It's raining, it's pouring
My lovelife is boring me to tears, after all these years

No sunshine, no moonlight, no stardust, no sign of romance
We don't stand a chance

I've always dreamed I found the perfect lover
But he turned out to be like every other man

Raining (raining)
Pouring (pouring)
There's nothing left for us here
And we won't waist another tear

If you've had enough, don't put up with his stuff, don't you do it

If you've had your fill, get the check pay the bill, you can do it

Tell him to just get out,

Nothing left to talk about

Pack his raincoat show him out

Just look him in the eye and simply shout:
Enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no
Enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Enough is enough
Enough is enough
That's enough

If you've reached the end, 
Don't pretend that is right when it's over

(it's over)
If the feeling is gone don't think twice just move on, get it over

(over, over)

Tell him to just get out, say it clearly, spell it out:
Enough is enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no
Enough is enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Enough is enough
Enough is enough

I've always dreamed to find the perfect lover,
But he turns out to be like every other man

Our love (I've gotta listen to my heart)
Our love (tearing us apart)

Enough is enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no
Enough is enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Enough is enough
Enough is enough
That's enough

No more tears (no more tears)
No more tears (no more tears)
No more tears (no more tears)
Enough is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough
I've had it, you've had it, he's had it, we've had is

I always dreamed I find the perfect lover,

But he turned out to be like every other man

I had no choice from the start
I've gotta listen to my heart
Tearing us apart

Enough is enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no
Enough is enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Goodbye mister, goodbye, goodbye mister

And then she turned to go
The prince of peace embraced the gloom
And walked the night alone

Oh, dance in the dark of night
The dark lord rides in force tonight
And time will tell us all
Oh, throw down your plow and hoe

Side by side we wait the night
The darkest of them all
Ah
Oh

I hear the horses' thunder
Down in the valley below
I'm waiting for the angels of Avalon
Waiting for the eastern glow

The seas of happiness
The ground is rich from tender care
Repay, do not forget

The apples turn to brown and black
The tyrant's face is red, ohhhh
Oh, war is the common cry
The sky is filled with good and bad
That mortals never know, ohhh
Ohh

Oh, well, the night is long
The beads of time pass slow
Tired eyes on the sunrise
Waiting for the eastern glow

The pain of war cannot exceed
The woe of aftermath
The drums will shake the castle wall
The ring wraiths ride in black

Sing as you raise your bow
No comfort has the fire at night
That lights the face so cold
Oh, dance in the dark of night

The magic runes are writ in gold
To bring the balance back
Bring it back
Oh

At last the sun is shining
The clouds of blue roll by
With flames from the dragon of darkness
The sunlight blinds his eyes

Because I don't have any plans 
And the time just passes by 
And there's no way I'm gonna change the way that I spend my days 
'Cause I see no reason why I will not devote my life to a lie.

One day you're gonna see 
It's gonna work out really fine for me 
I know you will look up to me 
One day you're gonna find 
I will no longer be the one who's left behind
I don't want to listen to the things you say anyway.

Can't you see that everyday 
Is such an endless drag you cannot seem to comprehend
And you will never understand 
And even though I've tried so hard 
To make a difference to anyone that really cares 
And I'll enjoy my days anywhere.

Stoned Soul,"Two years ago, a friend of mine
Asked me to say some MC rhymes
I said this rhyme I'm about to say
The rhyme was Def and it went this way
I took a test to become an MC
And Orange Krush became amazed over me
Took me inside of his Cadillac
The chauffeur drove off and we never came back
(???) cut the record down to the bone
And now they got me rockin' on the microphone
Then takin' autographs, and here's the laugh
Champagne caviar, and bubble bath
But see,

[Chorus:]
That's the life that I lead 
And you sucker MC's is who I please
Take that and move back catch a heart attack
Because there's nothin' in the world, that I would ever lack

Chillin' at a party in a be-boy stance
Rockin' on the mic, make the girls want to dance

Because you're bitin' all your life, you're cheatin' on your wife
You're walkin' 'ound town like a hoodlum with a knife
You're hangin' on the ave, chillin' with the crew
And everybody know what you've been through

Of the souls lost to tainted glory
The strong survive, that's what she told me
But in her eyes there's only mourning

People gotta know what she is
Addictive like the drug that she is
And now I got nothing give
Gave it all just to get away

I need her touch again

Stonewall Jackson,"I was born in Macon Georgia they kept my dad in the Macon jail
Dad said son if you keep your hands clean
You won't hear them bloodhounds on your trail
But I fell in with bad companions we robbed a man in Tennessee
The sheriff caught me way up in Nashville they locked me up and threw away the key
I washed my hands in muddy water washed my hands but they didn't come clean
Tried to do like daddy told me but I must have washed my hands in a muddy stream

I asked the jailor when's my time up he said son we won't forget
And if you try to keep your hands clean we may make a good man of you yet
I couldn't wait to do my sentence I broke out of the Nashville jail
I just crossed the line of Georgia and I can hear them bloodhounds on my trail
I washed my hands...




",I Washed My Hands in Muddy Water,
Stonewall Jackson,"In a little country village not very far away
There lived a rich but aged man whose hair was turning gray
He had three sons three only ones both Jack and Tom were sly
But Ted was honest as could be he would not tell a lie
The brothers tried to ruin Ted before the old man's eyes
At last the plot begin its work till Ted was much despised
The father then said begone you're heartless to the core
Then the black's sheeps words they came just a ringing through the door
Don't be angry with me dad don't drive me from your door
I know that I've been wayward but I won't be anymore
Just give me one more chance and put me to the test
You'll find the black sheep loves his dad for better than the rest
Year by year sped quickly by the father now grown old
He called to them both Jack and Tom and gave them all his gold
I only need a little room a place at your fireside
One night on Jacks' returning home he brought with him a bride
The three began to hate the father more and more each day
At last he heard the three declare why the old fool's in our way
They then agreed to send him to the poorhouse that was near
Then like a flash the black sheep's words came ringing in his ear
A wagon drives up to the door it is the poorhouse band
The brothers pointed to their dad right there is your man
Then a manly form appeared came rushin' through the crowd
Stop this you brutes the lad replied it shall not be allowed
You took the old man's property and all that he could save
You've even sold the little lot containing mother's grave
I am his son but not your kin from now till judgement day
The father clasped the black sheep's hand and they all heard him say
Don't be angry with me son I know I drove you from my door
I know that I've been foolish lad I've repented o'er and o'er
I should have given you my gold for you have stood the test
I found the black sheep loves his dad for better than the rest

You can read it in the pages of history where for the love of a woman man has cried
They say that Cesar wealth before the batlle
The one he loved had found somebody knew
And I guess that's why these tears of mine keep falling
Well like him I too am losing you

They say that absence make the heart grow fonder
Short partings can bring tears to our eyes
Like the story of Sampson and Delilah for the love of a woman man has cried

In my lonely prison cell until my dying day
Friend I don't want to bore ye or waste much of your day
But I've got a sad story I'd like to tell about the life that just wasted away
I had a good home and a family one time and riches of diamonds and jewels
But one night out on a party my friends I broke one of God's golden rules
Thy shall not kill was deep in my heart that day
But drinking too much driving too fast I took three lives away
So then I was trialed and convicted and the judge said so mercy on me
He said we was makin' an example so I was sent in this penitentary
Ninety-mine years was my sentence never no more will I roam
Nover to be with my loved ones so dear no place but this cell to call home
I'm alone in my shame and this is written deep in my soul
For the price I must pay for driking and driving can't be paid in silver and gold
I can't see my little darling or watch my babies at play
Three lives I took while drinking and driving out on the highway one day

When she walked along beside me and my heart was light and gay
I can see the tune's a changing lonely chords are here to stay
She filled my life with happy now the happiness is gone
Oh I'll try to soothe my sorrow in the verses of my song

I drank a full grop down but every night I found
Nothing takes the place of loving you
Nothing takes the place of holding your soft hands in mine
Empty glasses only leave me blue
Where your sweet lips used to be there's just a taste of wine
And nothing takes the place of loving you

And said I'm turning off my family grey
Of all the kids she raised no doubt Stonewall turned out the worse
Guess I must have just been born that way
I guess there's a streak of sorry burried in each man
And it always shows up now and then
Mine wasn't burried deep enough it's got the upper hand
Cause that line between the good and bad's so thin

So I got bowties and tried so hard to break

Who worked down near the Georgia Line
He's a D.J. in a little country station
Everybody loved him dear
'Cause he played what they liked to hear
He built himself a quite a reputation

At record hops he stayed out late
And his mom would always wait
To see if he had made it home alive
She warned against his loss of sleep
And driving fast in that old heap
And that he had to be at work by five

B.J. the D.J. you're living much too fast
And if you don't change your ways
Don't see how you can last

Every morning just past four
From the driveway he would roar
Overslept and he was late again
Then at breakneck speed he'd drive
To sign the station on at five
He had lots of records he must spin

His mom sits by the radio
Until his voice told her hello
She knew then that he made it there alright

Goodbye so long there's lots of places that I've never seen
I'll always be a drifter but I'll be driftin' back

I like to keep on goin' it helps me when I'm blue
I get the urge to travel that's all I want to do
I know I just can't settle down because I like to roam
And when I hear that whistle blow I've gotta move along
Goodbye so long there's something down the track keeps calling me
Goodbye so long I guess that's just the way I'll always be
So when I get that feeling don't try to hold me back
I'll only leave you cryin' in the smoke along the track

I know my baby loves me I love my baby too
But she don't understand me when I'm feeling blue
And when I hear that whistle blow I hurry home and pack
And leave my baby cryin' in the smoke along the track
Goodbye so long I hate to leave you but I've gotta go
Goodbye so long it's coming now just heard that whistle blow
It'll be here in a minute you'll wave and I'll look back

Stoney & Meatloaf,"Honey there's something I've got to say to you 
Oh I know I haven't told you before 
But it wasn't until the other night 
When you told me you loved me 

That I felt that I should tell you this 
You got a smile so bright 
You know, you could have been a candle 
You're holding me so tight 

You know, you could have been a handle

You know, you could have been a broom 
The way you smell so sweet 

You know, you could have been some perfume 
Well, you could have been anything that you wanted to 
And I can tell the way you do the things you do 
(the way you do the things you do) 

As pretty as you are 
You know, you could have been a flower 
If good looks caused a minute 
Oh, you could have been an hour 

The way you stole my heart 
You know, you could have been a cool crook 
And baby, you're so smart (baby you're so smart) 
You know, you could have been a school book 

Well, you could have been anything that you wanted to 
And I can tell the way you do the things you do

Stoney Curtis,"It's late in the evening; she's wondering what clothes to wear
She puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair
And then she asks me, Do I look all right?
And I say, ""Yes, you look wonderful tonight

We go to a party and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady that's walking around with me
And then she asks me, Do you feel all right?
And I say, ""Yes, I feel wonderful tonight""

I feel wonderful because I see
The love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize how much I love you

It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head
So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed
And then I tell her, as I turn out the light
I say, ""My darling, you were wonderful tonight
Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight",Wonderful Tonight,2002
Stoney Edwards,"She was there when I was nothing
But a young and foolish man;
The clothes the children were
She made with love and just two hands;
She went through hell to have the kids
Because she wanted to;
You can make a fool of a man like me,
If anybody can;
But she did more than you;
She made a fool into a man;
And now you'd take the spice of life;
that's all you want to do;
And I'm so ashamed of how close I came to giving
All she made of me to you.
And, after what she sacrificed
And all that she's endured,
Her hands could hardly look as nice
Or feel as soft as yours;
Her face is lined with loving signs
That I don't find on you;
And I'm ashamed of how close I came to giving
All she made of me to you.",All She Made of Me,1971

In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town

Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye

Storia Di un Minuto,"Cerco il sole ma non see'è...
Dorme ancora la campagna, forse no,
È sveglia, mi guarda, non so.
Già l'odore della terra odor di grano,
Sale adagio verso me.
E la vita nel mio petto batte piano,
Respira la nebbia, penso a te.
Quanto verde tutto intorno a ancor piú in là,
Sembra quasi un mare l'erba,
E leggero il mio pensiero vola e va
Ho quasi paura che si perda...
Un cavallo tende il collo verso il prato
Resta fermo come me:
Faccio un passo, lui mi vede, è già
Fuggito...
Respiro la nebbia, penso a te.
No, cosa sono adesso non lo so
Sono come, un uomo in cerca di se stesso
No, cosa sono adesso non lo so
Sono solo, solo il suono del mio passo...
Ma intanto il sole tra la nebbia filtra già:
Il giorno come sempre sarà.

This drink is guaranteed to get the pussy wet and the dick hard
Now, if you with me
Pour a glass and drink with a nigga, you know what I mean?
I ain't tryin' to turn you all niggas into alcohols, alcoholics
I'm just tryin' to turn you into motherfuckin' thugs
So come and get some of this Thug Passion, baby

I could pull out the drink and be good until it's relevant
But I'm a straight soldier
I'll roll up a nigga like it's Heaven sent
Tripping over dead presidents
They got these derelicts
I throw was down with this business
Trying to clown and get a cent
And so rather than stand forever, been thinking
Drinking over a felony
And hell of me and how it will be some other shit
People telling me to cool out
But they ain't feeling me
A motherfucking fool, about
My fucking cheddar cheese
And it pleases, passion of mine
Thugging, hugging plenty of G's
And laughing while I pass through times
And all these bastards be watching
Just keep it plain
And I'mma keep it the same partner, just take it the simple game
I can pinkle with the rain twinkling
Diamonds and things go blinking
Enough to hold me, til I'm old and wrinkling
And these adversaries
They gonna have to be worrying

Turn this Hennessey into a robbery
The Prophecy probably suddenly
Switch and how it supposed to be and dirty money
Can't be evil 'cause it's filling up my tummy
Born in a position, death collision was futuristic
Twisting riches but there is only one way to make more
So I'm standing on the corner
Trying to hustle in the snow and my bigger bro
Couldn't know, but buy a .44, blasting at playa haters wanting more
With a Thug Passion

Putting down mashin'
Control by this Thug's Passion
Unlike them other bustas pistol blasting
I'm asking what happened
To the niggas who kept it real
Like they claim to
That's when I bang, do, see thang true
Travelling this road my poor soul has been consolidated
With all this bullshit that I done tolerated
How I made it can easily stated
It's like my heart be gripped with the Passion
To be the fucking greatest
Load up and take shit

Make it to some high dollar gangsta shit
Jack a stack 'til we got enough bank to split

Creep with me

Thug Passion got you trembling, like Death on the Row
Make your move
So I can throw your mind a curve
While I'll be blowing up the scene

Take a toke as your heart goes full arrest

But damn, I'm making money
Observing you motherfuckers
'Cause some of you bitches funny
Say you want it but you bullshitting
Licking them lips, you got me about to act a fool quick
Sipping on some Alizé and Cristal
Meanwhile, buy me a drink and get to winking at me
She smiles, a niggas full of passion
Satisfaction is everlasting
""How does it feel?"" what I'm asking
While I'm rubbing on that ass
""Why you laughing?""
See, I'm digging as if I'm curious
Full blown and furious
Baby, get a grip
When I be doing this
It's so physical
My attraction driven by alcohol
Beware of my reaction
Baby I'm born to ball
Thugged out on Death Row
You better recognize and picture what I said, so
Now you can feel it, it's a portion for my niggas in motion
Forever blasting, bitches ain't ready for this Thug Passion

Why you get critical, 'cause the spots held down by the general

[Chorus: x2]
There's only a few that could ride with me
There's only a few that could ride for free
I hold my weight plus yours, when you can't hold ya own
'cause I know you do the same for me, so hold me down

Every clique got a soft nigga in it, believe me
That potray a kid he saw on the streets or in the movies
Tryin' to do the same he seen on the screen
Got his big guns, Timbs, hoody and his jeans
Talk the fast talk but there's a pause in this walk
Rock his jewels, truck and he still eat pork
He get his little hustle on, he run with his major team
Crazy ass dread from Jamaica, Queens
Ain't never seen war up in his face before
Get his news from the barber shop beeper store
But if you let him tell it, he's the last man standing
talkin' bout son, I held it down with the cannon
Should of seen the way that I was blazin' at the cats
Twist of the wrist, while I was pattin' one back
Like that kid did to Menace, when he had the four pound
You know it's only right, I had to hold the fort down

Blazin' with' ya friends, when we ridin'
There's no suprisin', it's all good
takin' chances, in the cut every day
Tryin' to big up, tryin' to big up with my master plan

[Chorus: x2]

As a youth I would sit up in my room and dream
One day I became with a ruthless teen
Little did I know that every step I took
Had already been signed and sealed in some books
So I took a look at what I got to work with of course
And if granted by the source move on with full force
What choice to choose, if I sin will I use
Sittin' with' the reverend in my county blues

To which ever form you base your religion on
Live by the scriptures of the Bible or Karan
Don't burn bridges if you plan to make riches
The ones that you least expect to be the worst snitches
For a dollar, a nigga screamin' holla out
Ya secret whereabouts, so they can come and air ya out
And took the throne, down the shoot dead and gone
The struggle goes on, so hold down ya dome",Hold It Down,1998
Storm,"Fear of the dark tears me apart
Won't leave me alone and time keeps running out
Just one more life, I'm so sick and tired
Of singing the blues, I should turn my life around
Tell me why do I feel this way
All my life I've been standing on the borderline
Too many bridges burned
Too many lies I've heard
I had life but I can't go back 
I can't do that, it will never be the same again
And I know I don't
Have any time burn
They follow me home, disturbing my sleep
But I'll find a place, place where they cannot find me
Maybe I'm lost, and maybe I'm scared

I pull a trick from my sleeve now kamikaze
I'm all over that nigga, come identify the body
My middle finger to you hoe niggas
Run up on me, and ill be forced to let it go nigga
I ain't the one you want to try, why, stayin' high
I hit this blunt an watch these motherfuckers die
Whose runnin' these streets I said that cocaine

'til the punk police come an raid ya ass

I done made so many mistakes but still I don't regret em

The strategy you plan must be concise & decisive
The army you command must be ready to die, for

The moment of truth is finally here
It's better that you make a stand, war is near
Hold your ground, never plead, They'd rather
Die on their feet than live on their knees

Steel and flesh clash in battle, blood stains the fields
Bodies burst, limbs are severed still they don't yield
3000,000 adversaries dressed in their best
300 Spartans stand as one they're not so impressed

Stormwitch,"A circle of warriors, weapons in the hand 
All their heads on the ground 
The victor's sitting near on empty stand 
While the wind whirls leaves around 

Here comes the Dai-San, the master of life and death 
And a priest - oh god, the shock takes away my breath 
If this black snake shall speak for me 
Easily he will tell him ties - in the name of god, you see! 

The Dai-San commands the man in the robe 
And he bows low in awe 
Obeys the command, betraying my hope 
Follows the churches law 

You chase for treasures, because your real god is just gold 
Even if I lose my life - your soul you've sold 
I've found the way to your abundance 

That you've kept dark, for eternity 
Everyone's lost, they had no chance 
To flee from this cruel destiny 
I'm not blind - you're a liar 

What can I do now, how can I restrain 
The time has come, I'll have to do: Dai-San let me explain 
I will crush your cross 
Look, the Dai-San comprehends 

Tell what you want 
This paralyzing fear now ends 

[Chorus] 
Why are there false priests in this world? 
Why do they turn good into bad? 
Why do so many follow 
Why don't you trust, trust in your own head 

After all - I will not hesitate 
After all - I'll go my way 
Whether fear or rage can bring me to 
To betray my believe!

Golden fades the sun

And reads, without his heart 

""I chose your life - that's my part 
You want everything 
But you can't see the signs""

Familiar faces his own kind 
All his friends he left to years 
Turned off and left them to their tears

Wrecked and lonely he was to be 
A typhoon set his ship aground 

And he cursed the cruel sea 
The sea took him with it's mighty hand 
Tossed him up, he's stranded in a unknown land 

Stranded - in a foreign land! 
Stranded - without people he could understand 
He's a man, proud and strong 
A man, with just one aim 
A man, who never did any wrong 
And he is not to blame 
Stranded - in a foreign land! 
Stranger in a very strange land 

He met his old foes the priests again 
He had no weapon in his hand 
Against their might he stood one man 
The sea took him with it's mighty hand 
Tossed him up, he's stranded in a unknown land

Still he didn't lose his pride

All those summer songs and those Jägerbombs and that day when I made you mine
You're not blessed but you say you're fine, I could swear that's your favourite line
All that I need and you're all that I see, let me help you breathe, let me save your life
You get caught in a whirl when you talk to your girls and they say that I'm bad news
You get wrapped in their words and it actually hurts cause we both know that's not true
Girl, this love is ours and it's no one else's, it's time that we both take charge
If we get it right then we'll never die, I just hope we can make it last, yo

Oh, let's make this last forever
Forever, yeah
Forever
Forever
Oh, let's make this last forever
Yeah, forever, oh
Forever
Forever

Yo, can we make this last forever?
Can we make the world spin slow? Let's work it out till it's better
I would never let this love grow, then you say never say never
And you kept me warm in the snow, with your tush as light as a feather
You said I was close to killing us both, we both know love's so painful
You came in my life and you made it alright and for that, man, I'm so grateful
Girl, this love is ours and it's no one else's and you need me to survive
You can light the way or return the flame, I just hope we can keep it alight, yo

You got a hold on me, girl you're too tight
We can go from Paris to Rome in two nights
If I'm gonna do it then I gotta do it right, alright
I will never ever lead you astray
That's all I never needed to say
The boys wanna tease at my faith
That's just another reason to pray
And if you ever needed me to stay
I'll always be a phone call away
Breathtaking, I'll blow you away
Girl, just face it, I know how you stay

If I tell you my every little interest
Thinking of you every time I rinse this, girl

Running through the world you're my princess, girl

Once more I woke up in the moonlight
Once more our paths crossed through the night

And you're sad for the old times passing you by
For there's no rewind so you might as well play 

While your time is rolling away
And get back on the road, it's a beautiful day
Pick up all the friends you can find on your way
And if you lose direction they'll be there guiding you on
Guiding you, guiding you on.

Because we're all going 
The same way down this long road
Yes, we're all bound 
The same way down this long, long road.

Like a thousand miles of fire
And I'm here to sing this anthem
Of our dying day

Would swallow every inch of this city
As you gasp for air tonight
I'd scream this song right in your face
If you were here
I swear I won't miss a beat
Cause I never
Never have before

Break through the waves

With the wreckage from ships that lost their way

Bound at the wrist

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena.

Every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every hero and coward,

Every saint and sinner in the history of our species,

There was a lot of doubt among the travelers.
They were not sure that they wanted to continue this quest, 
And why should they? If they turned back now 
Maybe they would survive instead of meeting the same fate as Darek. 
And riding towards the castle would only bring one thing, death. 
It was in that moment of doubt that Siam began to speak.

As I started to make this journey I traveled alone
Not knowing what waited for me on the other side
But I always knew that this was destined just for me
Chosen by fate to battle the evil one

And no, no I can not change this prophecy
No, it's already written in my fate

And now that I've come this far into the unknown
This quest feels so hard to bear on my shoulders
And I cannot ask of you to join me to the end
But if I face this alone then I will die

Bu no, no I will not change my destiny
No, I shall follow the sign because

I, I know it's my destiny
And there is nothing here for me

Storyteller,"Although our travelers had seen a lot of horrible things during their 
journey, nothing would
prepare them for what they were about to see when they entered the 
village... Women and children
were slaughtered like cattle. On giant poles, warriors and old men were 
impaled, and all around the
village there was a very thick and dark fog. Never before had they seen such 
cruelty, and no one,
not even the brave dwarf could keep the tears from falling. There was no 
doubt that the army of
darkness had paid a visit to this village. And by the damage made to the 
village they were quite
sure that the dark side had found the book of mystery. That was the only 
thing capable of doing
this kind of damage.

Suddenly! Someone cried out in agony! The travelers froze for a few 
seconds... were the dark
army still around the area? The air was quiet... but there! Behind that old 
ruin! Someone was
moving. They all ran towards the ruin, and what they saw came as a shock to 
them.

There was a survivor. A woman, bruised and beaten, but still alive. As they 
began to speak to
her it turned out that she was one of a warrior clan with a mission of 
guarding the book of
mystery. Obviously they had failed. Someone inside the clan had betrayed 
them, and sold the
information to the evil one, and therefore the book of mystery was now in 
the hands of the dark
side.

She had sworn an oath to guard the book, and to the gods she now swore to 
bring it back to the
sorcerers of light, no matter what. So when they left the village they had 
one more traveler by
their side, and her name was Kira the Guardian.

Soldiers were coming far from the hills
To seek the magic we concealed
My people were slaughtered, taken as slaves
To work until their dying days

But I know that one day
I will see victory
That's why I'll follow you
That's why I won't give in
Yes I know that one day
I will see victory
That's why I'll follow you
That's why I won't give in

So now that it's taken, it won't be long
Before their powers will be strong
Using the magic that's in the book
Their reign shall grow, the dark will rise

But I know that one day
I will see victory...

And as we leave the place that was my home
That now is laid in ruins
I swore an oath to restore the book of light again
And take it were it is safe
From all greed, from the dark, and misery

So follow my footsteps, and have no fear

If we shall survive in the dark

Check this out, it's going down over here
On the South, so I'm bout to come over
There on the North and scoop you up
We gotta put it down, boys ain't feel us in 9-9
With that Braids N' Fades, it's Y2K baby

Still swanging and banging ha, boys gon feel us man

Candy coated Exursion, swang and bang
Still gripping grain

See I'm a wide body roller, wood grain remote controller
Blades on Escalades, electric shocks on Range Rovers
Man the game over, when me and Slim pull up
You see us flossing on chrome, with the styrofoam cup
I got a eight and a liter, swanging on the feeter
In the Bentley watching BET, I'm tripping off of Cita
Cristal margaritas, we some block bleeders
My balling tire size, can't ride in two-seaters
Man I need Excursion, or my Navigator
My big body Denali, sqauatting like a Florida Gator
Tell them playa haters, E.S.G. I don't bar
50 cash and dash, like my name was Peter Warren
I parallel parked it, ghetto starts cost to Mars
Man my rims cost more, than some boys cars
Hit the Boulevard, with the nine on my lap-lap
Southside on the map-map, Screw tape tap-tap

Now when I come down, I be throwing up the North shwoing off
Six gallons of gloss, on my 7-9 Boss
I floss the candy cream gleam, when I pull on the scene
My four 18's and screens, got my shit sitting mean
My drop top is a supreme, king of a young team's dream
Like a diamond it bling-bling, when it's hit with sun beams
Shoot more spiders in my ring, when I glide up the block
I got a trunk full of knock, about to bust air shocks
I'm shutting down the parking lot, when you see me ride
See me sitting high with pride, sliding on the buck hide
Looking pretty, on a tour all across my city
Sipping drank by the pint, about to bust my kidney
From the North to the South, we gon represent
I'm getting bent behind tint, pros by the air vent
I spent a lot of cash to shine, but it came in handy
Cause like a child, Slim Thug is so in love with candy huh

Now when I come down, I be throwing up the South

Looking laid in the 'Sacci, or the Gucci shades

When you was growing up

[H.A.W.K]
I use to sit and watch the Flinstones, Gucci rolls and herringbones
Bezel sets and baguettes, while talking on my cell phone
From Bo-Bo's to Air Macs, low cars to horse backs
Hoopties to Cadillacs, water guns to chrome gats
Levis to Guess jeans, black and white to big screens
Six by nine to 18's, Bumsalack to sipping lean
Regals with white walls, 20 inch with screens fall
Michael Jackson off the wall, to MJG and 8Ball
Screw house to wrecking flows, to BET on videos
Zig-zags and yellow bags, to Glad sacks and optimos
Fist fight to gun play, sawed-offs to a.k.'s
Spitting flows at talent shows, as the H-A-W-K
Riding on the Metros, pushing a six double O
Smoking cess to endo, fill it up with petro
Fixing on my lego, let go of my ego
Get in with my little bro, getting up when the rooster blow

[Lil Flip]
I remember Kangaroos and afro curls, always running after girls
Trying to sneak in Natural World, BB gun shooting at the squirrels
Candy red on tricycles, training wheels on bicycles
Sugar Daddy's, Pixie Stix, peppermints and side pickles
Loaded toes and Scooby Doo, some of the things we use to do
Roller skate now roller blades, Ivy Leagues to holding fades
Blow-Pop rings and diamond things, herringbones to bezeltines
Cadillacs to limousines, ironing jeans to being clean
GI Joes to Tonka toys, eating Willy Wonka boy
Riding in my uncle's car, wanting to become a star
Having dreams to be like Mike, hooping in my all black Nikes
Flying kites and shooting dice, sneaking in the movies twice
Staying up and watching Cops, walking outside in Michael socks
Being afraid of chicken pox, check my bowl on Magnavox
Running up and down my block, sweating cause the sun is hot
I use to ride the city bus, now I'm pulling Hummers out

[AP]
I remember brothers getting dumped off, in ditches and bayous
Boys gave head jobs, and all I saw was hairdo's
Pimps drove Lacs and dob hats, with chrome gats
Hustlers stack paper, with the players and macs
Police burns in the hood, because somebody just got jacked
Every girl I slam they call, I told em call me back
Haters got backhanded, because they were always talking smack
Instigators chit chat, and were known for spreading rumors
Ballers went from stabs, to buying more of consumers
I use to eat on tuna, now it's shrimp and caviar
I use to be a virgin, now I have menage tois
I use to drink on soda, now I'm sipping mixed with bar
I use to stay in the ghetto, now I'm a ghetto superstar
I recall when I couldn't rap, now my rap game's up to par
From then to now it's funny, Jabos to Armani
AP became a business man, that's all about his money

Back in the days I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But sometimes, I wish that I could be a kid again
I use to wear a swatch watch, now I only wear Movado
Went from bare foot on a bus, to holding keys to Monte Carlos
Now it's a big body Expedition, showing my naked ass provado
Went from hood to all good, shh playing a game like huh brah
Backyard nickel and dime that, now boys be moving birds
Use to carry my knife special, now it's gats and smoking sherm
Use to mix at house parties, freestyling to Whodini
Now I'm signing rappers to paid in full, eating shrimp and fetichini
Boy I use to ride big wheels, while wearing them Chuck Taylors
Now it's Jordans, Air Macs, even pink-green gators
Use to be sneaking in Lover's Land, or at the drive-in movies
Now it's Tinsel Town or Motel 6, where this hoe can do me
Use to watch freestyle the man, or Rap City on BET
Now I star in sitcoms, movies and got my own video show on t.v., what

Should of seen it I was right there, when a problem jumped off
Rounds got dumped off, leaving niggas bumped off
Always trying to get the hook up, leaving your girl shook up
Women breaking my pager, phone line you can't look up
We had ice on us, merchandise on us
Busting at other hoods, when they had a price on us
Listening to flow tapes, people saying rewind it
Pulling out my piece, and bystanders get blinded
From winter to summer time, there wasn't no leaving our block
When the laws made it hot, we was freezing our block
Man we got enough money, to make my neck look pretty
Cause we done made enough money, to make my check look pretty
Rapping at talent shows, saying phrase too frequent though
Niggas talk about Fasachi, we roll that in Regal though

Ah, Please come home",To Christmas! [The Drinking Song],2016
Straight No Chaser,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",Nearness of You,2010

And I think I've figured out the the dying lie

Strangelove,"Called by the feeling that there must be something more
To a place you've never ever been before
Where no one goes
Yet still you're not alone
Yu wonder why
As you look into the the sky
The clatter-clatter-clatter of electric pylons
Are carrying chattering electric wires
Like a spider's web
Just above your head
It's a spider's web just above your head
It's the telephone dead on the internet
Flies,
The electric skys,
Sell your friends and
Sell your mother
You're not coming back forever
Flies,
The electro-skys,
Of the new world,
It's the new world,
Meet the new world nobody can find
Caught in the feeling that there must be something more
Be a place you've never - ever seen before
Where no-one knows
Why can't you be alone
You wonder why
The answer's in the sky
The clatter-clap-trap of electric wiring
Is scattering stuttering electric lives
Like a spider's web
Just above your head
It's a spider's web just above your head
Signed the telephone dead on the internet
Flies,
The electric skys,
Kill your friends and
Kill your mother
You're not coming back forever
Flies,
The electro-skys,
Of this new world,
Meet the new world,
Greet the new world nobody can find
It's a spider's web
Just above your head
You FLIES!

Strangelove,"It's another night in

Rats are in the kitchen, scratchin'
Whisperin' my name and laughin'
Edgin' up the hall into my bed
Faces on the walls are screamin'
Driftin' out across the ceilin'
Droppin' off and fallin' in my head

All alone they cut the phones
But then again there's no one left to ring
There's gonna be no peace
'Til the bones break through my skin

Another night in, another night in
I shiver within, a slow hand clap begins
Another night in, another night in
Woah, my skeleton is waitin' in the wings
Of a skeleton grin, oh no
'Cause I don't know where he stops and I begin

A hundred million bugs are crawlin'
In and out of every openin'
Up and down and over me all night
Lookin' through my old scrapbook
I search in vain for pleasant memory
Tearin' out my hair 'til it gets light

All alone, I'm heard to groan
My epitaph, I regret everythin'
There's gonna be no sleep 'til the bones
Break through my skin

Another night in, another night in
I shiver within, a slow hand clap begins
Another night in, another night in
Woah, my skeleton is eager in the wings
Of a skeleton grin, oh no
And I don't know where he stops and I begin

It's just another night in, another night in
I shiver within, a slow hand clap begins
Another night in, another night in
Woah, my skeleton is waitin' in the wings
Of another night in, just another night in
Woah, another night in

Watchin' the wildlife drift by on the outside
Watchin' the movement on my bit of sky
Watchin' my face disappear in the mirror
All in the name of another night in

Woah, another night in, woah, another night in
Oh no no, this skeleton thing
Feelin' the pain of another night in

And the runaway brothers have had their day
Remember on your wedding day
I must admit I had the strangest feeling then
Outside the Church - we took some flak
Both throwing up round the back
But now when we meet up today
It don't seem right that we just don't know what to say
Not knowing what to do

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,

For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet

On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

When all the signs you see still point to overload
As you reach out your hand, a shattered picture's receding
Like tail-lights along that lonesome stretch of broken road
'Cause you've been to the past and it's just a reminder
A recollection of faces that will never come to call

Don't look to the heavens for they will tell you nothing
If living is for learning then dying is forgetting
Once we have forgotten then we can go on living 

In a lifetime of hope, in a second of kindness
There is never a doubt that we are born and die alone
From within or without there's no way they can find us
When they knock at the door the lights are on but we ain't home
