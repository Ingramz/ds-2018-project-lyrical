You're the kind
When you love you love with all your might and
You're the kind
I would dream about at night
Now I'm the lucky one
Baby I'm the lucky one
You're the kind
That I want to be with in the dark and
You're the kind
Who is capturing my heart
And I'm the lucky one
Baby I'm the lucky one
And I have never been the one to fall in love so soon
But I could never face another night or day without you
Baby I'm the lucky one
You're the kind
With poetry and valentines and
You're the kind
Who will never ever leave
And I'm the lucky one
The luckiest girl
My, my, my baby
Baby I'm the lucky one
And I have never been the one to fall in love so soon
But I could never face another night or day without you, you-hoo
I'm the lucky one
Baby I'm the lucky one
I said
Doot-doo, doot-doo-n-doo-doo

Mark Hammond,"[Chorus:]
Do you want to be in love forever
Do you want to make my dream come true
Let me be the one to kiss and hold you
Say you'll be my baby
Can you see the two of us together
Living in love this whole life through
Do you want to be in love forever
Say you'll be mine

I can remember
When my mind was clear and free
Now there's a feeling
Coming over me
The sweetest attraction
That my heart has ever seen
I'm going crazy making sense of anything

(repeat chorus twice)

I really wonder
Is there magic in your smile
Taking me under
Got me acting like a child
Something about you
Hits me like avalanche
I try to stand my ground
But I don't stand a chance

(repeat chorus)

Every time I close my eyes I dream about
Hugging you, holding you, kissing you boy
It's driving me crazy
But even if it takes forever
To win your heart and your love and your devotion
I know it's gonna be worth the wait

Ooh, say you'll be my baby
Ooh, be my baby
Ooh, oh darlin', say you'll be mine

(repeat chorus)

Do you want to, do you, do you want to
Do you want to be in love
Do you want to, do you, do you want to
Say you'll be my baby

Do you want to be in love
Do you want to, do you, do you want to
Say you'll be mine

Mark Hammond,"Face to face we embrace
We drink of love's sweetest wine
Whispered names fan the flames
Each touch is frozen in time
I can feel your heart
And the rhythm of it echoes through my soul
Well surely you know

Whatever it takes baby I'm gonna be there
Whatever it takes baby you've got to know
Whatever it takes to be true to you
Baby I'll do it somehow

Promises made to last
These are the hardest to find

Your love will always be mine
As the years go by

Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,
God of love, please look down and see my people through.

I believe that God put sun and moon up in the sky.

Mark Hanson,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near

Mark Hanson,"Dear when you smiled at me, I heard a melody
It haunted me from the start
Something inside of me started a symphony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

'Twas like a breath of spring, heard a robin sing
About a nest set apart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies blue again
What else could I do again
Keep repeating through again
""I love you, love you""

I still recall the thrill, guess I always will
I hope 'twill never depart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop

Are the stars out tonight
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue

You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you",I Only Have Eyes for You,2009
Mark Hanson,"I get high when I see you go by, (my oh my)
When you sigh my inside just flies, (butterflies). 
Why am I so shy when I'm beside you.

It's only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do.
It's only love and that is all,
But it's so hard loving you.

Is it right that you and I should fight, (every night)
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright, (very bright)
Haven't I the right to make it up girl.

It's only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do.

Mark Harris,"It's only for a moment you are mine to hold
The plans that heaven has for you
Will all too soon unfold
So many different prayers I'll pray
For all that you might do
But most of all I'll want to know
You're walking in the truth
And If I never told you
I want you to know
As I watch you grow

I pray that God would fill your heart with dreams
And that faith gives you the courage
To dare to do great things
I'm here for you whatever this life brings
So let my love give you roots
And help you find your wings

May passion be the wind
That leads you through your days
And may conviction keep you strong
Guide you on your way
May there be many moments
That make your life so sweet
Oh, but more than memories

I pray that God would fill your heart with dreams
And that faith gives you the courage
To dare to do great things
I'm here for you whatever this life brings
So let my love give you roots
And help you find your wings

It's not living if you don't reach for the sky
I'll have tears as you take off
But I'll cheer as you fly

I pray that God would fill your heart with dreams
And that faith gives you the courage
To dare to do great things
I'm here for you whatever this life brings
So let my love give you roots
And help you find your wings",Find Your Wings,2005
Mark Harris,"I was waiting for a push, waiting for a sign
Waiting for the perfect moment to arrive
Steady as a clock, caught between the line
Living for myself until I realized
There's too much life you've given me
To let it slip away

I'm ready to live, ready to breathe
Ready to take in everything
I'm ready to love, ready to shine
Ready to live this life of mine
I'm ready to jump, ready to fly for the first time

I want to take a dive, I want to take a chance
I want to make the most of every day I have
I want to be alive, I want to be a man

So what can hold them back

Being pushed by bigger hands
You have saved me
You have made me who I am

Mark Harris,"My life has been like an old house 
Far past the outskirts of town 
The kind that you see down a dirt road 
You wonder why it's not torn down 

Abandoned and empty 
Forgotten and appears 
So overgrown and ravaged by the years 

So come through the doorway I've closed in the past 
And tear down the walls of my pride 
Open the windows and push out the darkness 
By letting in Heaven's pure light 
Oh banish the silence and open this tomb 
Fill up my heart and make it Your living room 
Your living room 

So let there be music and laughter 
Let there be memories displayed 
And moments I frame to remind me 
Of Your sweet goodness and grace 

And let a sign burn brightly 
Let it be known 
To all who come near 
This is Your home 
So Lord, won't You 

Come through the doorway I've closed in the past

Mark Harris,"I came home from work
And she was waiting at the door
Had that bad day look in her eyes

And I heard the sound of her little feet
Across the hardwood floor
And I knelt down with my arms open wide

When I asked her what had happened
She pointed to our son and said
""Why don't you show your daddy what you've done""

And I could see the writing on the wall
Evidence of little hands
Picasso with a purple crayon
And I tried to act upset
But I was smiling through it all
'Cause I could see the writing on the wall, yeah

It was the first day of school
Standing by the laundry door
Wondering how third grade came so fast

I took a ruler and a sharpie pen
And I drew the line once more
So amazed at how the time had passed

With a backpack full of promise
And wonder in her eyes
I turned my head just so she wouldn't see me cry

'Cause I could see the writing on the wall
It seems no matter how I tried
The pages of this life keep turning
It's a roller coaster ride
And even though I knew we had it all
I could see the writing on the wall

I got a cinematic memory
Playing pictures of the past
Adding to the story as we go

'Cause every day I'm learning
That tomorrow comes too fast
So, I'm holding on to the only way I know
Yeah, yeah, whoa

I can see the writing on the wall
It seems no matter how I tried
The pages of this life keep turning

Mark Harris,"I'm sure he must have been surprised
At where this road had taken him
'Cause never in a million lives
Would he have dreamed of Bethlehem
And standing at the manger
He saw with his own eyes
The message from the angel come to life
And Joseph said

Why me (why me), I'm just a simple man of trade?
Why Him with all the rulers in the world? (rulers in the world)
Why here (why here) inside this stable filled with hay?
Why her, she's just an ordinary girl (ordinary girl)
Now, I'm not one to second guess what angel's have to say
But this is such a strange way to save the world

If Jesus had come as He deserved
There would have been no Bethlehem
No lowly shepherds at His birth
But Joseph knew the reason
The love had to reach so far
And as he held the Savior in his arms
He must have thought

Mark Hart,"Another pleasant day in the countryside
Has ended up in tears on a stormy night
'Cause you can't follow my directions home
But don't stop now

God knows where the satellite's taking us
I can't tell what's right in front of us
But I hang on every word
And don't stop now
No, don't stop now

You get fooled by the lightning every time
See the after-image of my outline
And you turn the wrong way 'round
Well, don't stop now
No, don't stop now
You give me something I can write about
You give me something I can cry about

In a church house ten miles out of town
Is the devil gonna track me down?
And travel through a tunnel in the trees
Just remember that's how you get to me

There's no number on the house
The birds are heading south
Sometimes you have to turn
The wrong way 'round
Sometimes you get too close to nowhere now

This is helpful in the silence

And all I want is something I can write about
All I want is something I can cry about

there's so many things I want to say

Sometimes I just forget, say things I might regret,

I don't want to lose you,
I could never make it alone.

I am a man who would fight for your honor,
I'll be the hero you're dreaming of.

Mark Heimermann,"Before the threads of time began
Was pre-ordained a mighty plan
That I should walk with Him alone
The cords of trust unbroken


But fate foresaw my wandering eye
That none could yet restrain
To violate the friendship I
Would cause Him so much pain


Chorus:
And everytime I close my eyes
I see the nails, I hear the cries
He did not keep Himself away
He was no stranger to my pain
He walked a mile in my shoes
He walked a mile


Feet so dusty cracked with heat
But carried on by love's heartbeat
A man of sorrows filled with grief
Forgiveness was His anthem


No feeble blow from tongue or pen
Could ever sway my love for Him
Across the echoed hills He trod
And reached into my world.

And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger 
The longer I stay away

Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

The moonlight on the bayou
A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

When an XKE pulled up on the right
He rolled down the window of his shiny new Jag
And challenged me then and there to a drag

I said ""You're on buddy -- my mill's running fine
Let's come off the line now at Sunset and Vine
But I'll go you one better, if you've got the nerve
Let's race all the way -- to Dead Man's Curve""

We were buggin' each other while we sat out the light
We both popped the clutch when the light turned green
You shoulda heard the whine from my screamin' machine!

I flew past La Brea, Schwab's and Crescent Heights
And all the Jag could see were my six taillights

But I pulled her out and there we were - at Dead Man's Curve

What am I doing here?
What happened before?
Did I mess up?

Someone is calling me
Someone is whispering
Then you wake up

And it makes me feel bad
When I find that you're not here
And it makes me so scared
When I find that I'm alone

I can't remember
How was holding your hands tight
Lost in bad light

Suddenly I'm hearing
Darkness around me
Should I wake up

And it makes me feel bad
When I find that you're not here
And it makes me so scared
When I find that I'm alone

Afraid

I can remember
What happened before
Should I wake up and call you out loud on and on

And it makes me feel bad
When I find that you're not here
And it makes me so scared
When I find that I'm alone

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,1994

The songs of hopeless selflessness

Wasted

She worked the night shift
Dishwater blonde, tall and fine
She got a lot of tips
Well, earlier I'd been talkin' stuff
In a violent room
Fighting with lovers past
I needed someone with a quicker wit than mine
Dorothy was fast
Well, I ordered, ""Yeah, let me get a fruit cocktail, I ain't to hungry""
Dorothy laughed
She said ""Sounds like a real man to me""
Kinda cute, you want to take a bath?
(do you want to, do you want to, bath)
I said ""Cool, but I'm leaving my pants on"" (she say)
""'cause I'm kind of going with someone""
She said ""Sounds like a real man to me""
""Mind if I turn on the radio?""
""Oh, my favorite song"" she said
And it was Joni singing ""Help me I think I'm falling""

The phone rang and she said
""Whoever's calling can't be as cute as you""
Right then I knew I was through
(Dorothy Parker was cool)
My pants where wet, they came off
But she didn't see the movie
Cause she hadn't read the book first
Instead she pretended she was blind
An affliction brought on by a witch's curse
Dorothy made me laugh (ha ha)
I felt much better so I went back 
To the violent room (tell us what you did)
Let me tell you what I did

I took another bubble bath with my pants on

This is the time to bring them back.
What were the promises caught
On the tips of our tongues?

Do we forget or forgive?
There's a whole other life waiting to be lived when
One day we're brave enough
To talk with conviction of the heart.

And down your streets I've walked alone,
As if my feet were not my own
Such is the path I chose,
Doors I have opened and closed

I'm so tired of living this life,
Fooling myself, believing we're right when
I've never given love
With any conviction of the heart.

One with the Earth, with the sky
I believe we'll survive
If we only try
How long must we wait to change

This world bound in chains that we live in
To know what it is to forgive,
And to be forgiven?
It's been too many years of talking now.

Isn't it time to stop somehow?

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Of love and youth and spring,

Just like a child, who, late from school walks bravely home through the park.
To keep their spirits soaring and keep the night at bay.
Neither quite knowing which way they are going, they sing the shadows away,
Often I think my poor old heart has given up for good.
And then I see a brand new face, I glimpse some new neighborhood.
So walk me back home, my darling, tell me dreams really come true.

Cause I'm awfully fond of getting
Love in an actual setting.
This is what I call the simple things:
Just a winding stream where I can drift and dream.
And now I'm waiting for you.

By a waterfall I'm calling you.
We can share it all beneath a ceiling of blue.
We'll spend a heavenly day
Here where the whispering waters play.
There's a whipper will that's calling you.
By a waterfall, he's dreaming too.
There's a magic melody
Mother nature sings to me
Beside a waterfall with you.

You cried the whole night through
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Go on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river............over you

That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Lullaby of Birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",Lullaby of Birdland,2000
Mark Kershner,"You'd be so nice to come home to
You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high, sang a lullaby
You'd be all my heart could desire

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon shining above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love

Mark Kibble,"Lonely one of young so brokenhearted
Travelling down the rigid road of life
Using pharmaceutical extractions
To find the paradise

Finds the high but comes down feeling lower
Gets down on their knees and starts to pray
Looking up to heaven for the answer
They hear a voice that says

You will know
Troubled heart you'll know
Problems have solutions
Trust and I will show

You will know
Troubled heart you'll know
Every life has reason
For I made it so

Single parent trying to raise their children
But they would much rather not alone
Reaches out to find that special someone
To make their house a home

Finds someone but no one is the right one
Gets down on their knees and starts to pray
Looking up to heaven for the answer

Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you

All that you feel
Avoiding the shadows
What they can see
Then the wave starts to break
And the shadows are real
So you reach out to some one
Who holds an idea

They don't say
What you really need to hear
They don't know
What it is they try to say
They don't play
Oh, that same old easy song
You don't know
Who is right or who is wrong

Tell me now
Hear us and the answer we find
Tell me now
The answer is no answer at all
Tell me now
Blaming him to see you tonight
Tell me now
Yes I am, I see you again

And your words that invade
Only shattered of dream
That you build with your life
No one takes any pain
People burned you with reasons
You're caught in the plane

They don't say
What you know you need to hear
They don't know
Then you tell them how you feel
They don't play
Oh, the song that you can't sing

Tell me now
Always have the answer we found
Tell me now

Mark King,"Those kissing words that come out of your mouth 
Sweet promises to break my heart 
You talk of love and I begin to trust 
I don't know why I'm scared 

Those kissing words they climb inside my head 
They cloud my mind like purest poison 
When I'm with you it feels so dangerous 
I don't know why I'm scared 

It's driving me crazy 
Bitter Moon always betrays me 
Betrays me 

I know your thoughts I've read your diaries 
My fingers burn as I turn the page 
You spoke of love my tears have turned to dust 
I don't know why I care 

I'm asking you to give me more than this 
I need to feel beyond the pain 
The rain returns to rearrange the rust 
I don't know why I care 

It's driving me crazy 
Bitter Moon always betrays me 
Betrays me 

It's cold and it's crazy 
Bitter Moon always betrays me 
Betrays me 

Cold sun in a wet rocky sky 
A broken beach where the waves come to die 
I walk alone with fear in my heart 
Still I deny we're falling apart 

Cyclops shines through the legendary night 
The living tale of a time we thought we might 
The open grave of the shallowness of blame 
Still I try to hold on to the flame 

A cold sun like the steel in your eyes 
The day you said goodbye was the day you saw me die 
A cold sun no heat for my heart 
Still I deny we're falling apart 

It's driving me crazy 
Bitter Moon always betrays me 
Betrays me 
It's cold and it's crazy 
Bitter Moon always betrays me 
Betrays me",Bitter Moon,1999
Mark King,"Gimme a reason to believe in this dream 
I don't want anything to come between us 
The feelings and the faith and the love 
The hope that it's gonna be forever 

But how can I forgive the mistakes, cause once they're made 
Then I find all of the fears, they rise and I worry 
I watch you leave in such a hurry 
Am I as big a fool as I can be? 

When love becomes a novel to a war 
And your words are a sword 
It's too late they've been said 
And I can't find the peace anymore 
So it goes on and on and on and on 
Till the tears are falling 

Gimme a moment to express how I feel 
I know you got a lot of ways to hate me 
I know I need to see to believe 
And it can drive you to distraction 

And I can't stop making mistakes, I forget to forgive 
Until I find all of the tears, they rise and I am sorry 
Please don't leave in such a hurry

And i know the fate of the man who lies
They shoot horses don't they?
Now i'm more aware of the big design

Cause i never knew just where to draw the line
Till i saw you in pieces

Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,1993

Why can't I sleep at night?

Away 'mong the corries beyond human ken

His spells to weave and steal a heart
Within her breast, but only sleeping.

I spied a lord of high degree conversing with my love

Mark Knopfler,"She was swinging by the bangles in a main street store
A while before we met
The most dangerous angels that you ever saw
She spied her amulet 

And she took a loop of leather for around her neck
And that was then the start
The most dangerous lady on her quarter deck
She found her Golden Heart
You found your Golden Heart 

Then we swirled around each other and the thread was spun
to some Arcadian band
I would stop it from swinging like a pendulum
Just to hold time in my hand 

And you shot me with a cannonball of history
And long forgotten art
I'd be turning it over as our words ran free
I'd hold your Golden Heart
I'd hold your Golden Heart 

Nothing in the world prepared me for you, your heart, your heart
Nothing in the world that I love more your heart, your heart
Your Golden Heart 

And every time I'm thinking of you from a distant shore
And all the time I sleep
I will have a reminder that my baby wore
A part of you to keep 

And I'll send you all my promises across the sea
And while we are apart
I will carry the wonder that you gave to me
I'll wear your Golden Heart
I'll wear your Golden Heart 

Nothing in the world prepared me for you, your heart, your heart
Nothing in the world that I love more your heart, your heart

Forgive a knight who knows no shame

And I felt the blade of love so keen
And when you smiled you did me harm

Though they may never shine like his
There is no knight I would not kill
To have my lady's hand to kiss

To leave me not one breath from you
And they fell silent one and all

I did a warehouse stint for south sea girl
It was Hong Kong clothes for cash
Everybody got treated worse than trash
Punch the card in the company clock
Load the trolleys and the company trucks
And around and around the whole day through
And you couldn't sit down when there was nothing to do

Well they had beaten up people from every land

I had everyone but me to blame
And every day was just the same
Well nobody ever said it was a righteous world

And we drove up the home trail

And I froze as she stepped in the doorway
Stood there as still as could be
I said I know it ain't much, it needs a woman's touch

Mark Knopfler,"I am Jeremiah Dixon
I am a Geordie boy
A glass of wine with you, sir
And the ladies I'll enjoy
All Durham and Northumberland
Is measured up by my own hand
It was my fate from birth
To make my mark upon the earth

He calls me Charlie Mason
A stargazer am I
It seems that I was born
To chart the evening sky
They'd cut me out for baking bread
But I had other dreams instead
This baker's boy from the west country
Would join the Royal Society

We are sailing to Philadelphia
A world away from the coaly Tyne
Sailing to Philadelphia
To draw the line
A Mason-Dixon Line

Now you're a good surveyor, Dixon
But I swear you'll make me mad
The West will kill us both
You gullible Geordie lad
You talk of liberty
How can America be free
A Geordie and a baker's boy
In the forests of the Iroquois

Now hold your head up, Mason
See America lies there
The morning tide has raised
The capes of Delaware
Come up and feel the sun
A new morning has begun
Another day will make it clear
Why your stars should guide us here

We are sailing to Philadelphia
A world away from the coaly Tyne
Sailing to Philadelphia
To draw the line

Mark Knopfler,"These tables are haunted
By the ghost of Las Vegas
Their chips were once mountains
But they came here to play
They could take me if they wanted
But I have nothing worth counting
And like the sands of Nevada
They go drifting away

Lady luck's still a mystery
With her head on my shoulder
And I don't know why 
I still want her to dance
I guess that's all history
What it is is a I'm older
And I'm still a fool
For a one-way romance

Her dice were red rubies
They rolled and they tumbled
And I never saw time
Running out with my roll
And in the wasteland of cut glass
My dreams were crumbled
And I've paid with whatever
I had left for a soul

Now the dawn's broken even
On a empty horizon
No reason for folding
No reason to stay
It's too soon to be leaving
Too late for criticizing

They go drifting away",Sands of Nevada,2000
Mark Knopfler,"On Silvertown Way, the cranes stand high
Quiet and gray against the still of the sky
They won't quit and lay down though the action has died
They watch the new game in town on the Blackwall side

From the poisonous drains a vision appears
New circle of cranes, a new reason to be here
A big silver dome rising up into the dawn
Above the church and the homes were all the silver is gone

I'd leave the story untold Silvertown blues
Going down Silvertown
Down in Silverdown
Going down Silvertown

A truck with no weels up on cinderblocks

With the ghosts and the ancient stones

In 1954 don't laugh
I keep all of the pictures
Are you going to take a photograph
Here's something nice for you
A dear old thing came to a show
Last time here we did
An interview on local radio

Make yourself at home my darling
Come on in
Hand me down that jar love
Can I offer you a gin

We're proud to be the oldest
Ugly sisters in variety
There's not the glamour now you see
What happened to society
There's another light bulb gone
They don't all answer to the switch
I don't know how we carry on
And her she couldn't care the bitch

But in a while the old boys
In the band began to play
And in a while the houselights
And the curtains slide away

And something's going to happen
To make your whole life better
Your whole life better one day
Something's going to happen
To make your whole life better
Your whole life better one day

Now the landlady's all squared away
It's just a temporary deal
I'm afraid tonight it's take-away
You see there is no evening meal
Don't worry dear you shall go to the ball
I think the fairy said
These suitcases have seen it all
From under someone else's bed

You want to smile those tears away
Now don't you cry
You want to know what I say
I say never say die

With a brass monkey date
The rail-king and the scarecrow
Hopped a Florida freight
And they blew on their paper cups
And stared through the steam
Then they drank half a bottle
Of Ragpicker's dream where

The whiskey keeps following
Cold pitchers of beer
Me and my associate
Like the clientele here get
The onions and the 'taters
Rib-eyes on the grill
Toothpicks and luckies
And a coffee refill as

The rail-king lay rocking
He was leaving the ground
Then he was flying like Santa Claus
Over the town where
He came to the window
Of a house by a stream
It was a family christmas
In the Ragpicker's dream there

Were kids at the table
All aglow in the light
Music in the wintertime
Sure carries at night there
Was turkey and gravy
Pie and ice-cream
And gifts for each and everyone
In the Ragpicker's dream where

The red-eye keeps tumbling
In our glasses of beer
Me and my associate
Like the service in here there's
A ten for your trouble
You have beautiful hair
Make the last one two doubles
It's a cold one out there where

The scarecrow and the rail-king
Have started to dance
But a nightstick and a billy-club
Won't give peace a chance here
I think they went that-aways
Your song and dance team
Heading home for the holidays
With the Ragpicker's dream on

His knees like a fighter
The rail-riding king
Like a sack of potatoes
Like a bull in the ring where
The scarecrow falls over
With a tear in the seam
Home for the rover
In the Ragpicker's dream where

The red-eye keeps tumbling
Like tears in our beer

In a white flashlight beam

Be the rent collector, come around
Yeah, but you're small potatoes
Strictly nickel and dime, nickel and dime

You have to believe in your own publicity
But you get yourself and agent
Hire the Albert Hall
Make like Humpty dumpty and look down on it all
But you're small potatoes
Strictly nickel and dime, nickel and dime

Hanging in around with the VIPS

Marched them up a hill of beans and down again

Snow laying all around 
A collier cycles home
From his night shift underground
Past the silent pub
Primary school, workingmen's club 
On the road from the pithead 
The churchyard packed 
With mining dead

Then beneath the bridge 
He comes to a giant car 
A shroud of snow upon the roof
A mark ten jaguar
He thought the man was fast asleep
Silent, still and deep
Both dead and cold
Shot through 
With bullet holes

The one armed bandit man
Came north to fill his boots
Came up from cockneyland 
E-type jags and flashy suits
Put your money in 
Pull the levers
Watch them spin
Cash cows in all the pubs
But he preferred the new nightclubs

Nineteen sixty-seven
Bandit men in birdcage heaven 
La dolce vita, sixty-nine
All new to people of the Tyne

Who knows who did what 
Somebody made a call
They said his hands 
Were in the pot
That he'd been skimming hauls
He picks up the swag
They gaily gave away
Drives his giant jag 
Off to his big pay day

The bandit man
Came north to fill his boots
Came up from cockneyland 
E-type jags and flashy suits
The bandit man
Came up the great north road
Up to geordieland
To mine 
The mother lode

Seams blew up or cracked
Black diamonds came hard won
Generations toiled and hacked 
For a pittance and black lung
Crushed by tub or stone
Together 
And alone
How the young and old 
Paid the price of coal

Eighteen sixty-seven
My angel's gone to heaven
He'll be happy there
Sunlight and sweet clean air

They gather round the glass 
Tough hewers and crutters
Child trappers and putters
The little foals and half-marrows
Who pushed 
And pulled the barrows
The hod boys 
And the rolleywaymen

Sonny was the second to the last one born
His mama ran away and his daddy beat him bad
And he grew up wild good love he never had
 
He had a left like Henry's hammer
A right like Betty Bamalam
Rode with the muggers in the dark and dread
And all them sluggers went down like lead
 
Well he hung with the hoods he wouldn't stroke the fans
But he had dynamite in both his hands
Boom bam like the slammer door
The bell and the can and the bodies on the floor
 
Beware the bear's in town
Somebody's money says the bear's going down
Yeah, the bear never smiles
Sonny's going down for miles and miles
Sonny's going down for miles and miles
 
The writers didn't like him the fight game jocks
With his lowlife backers and his hands like rocks
They didn't want to have a bogey man
They didn't like him and he didn't like them
 
Black Cadillac  alligator boots
Money in the pockets of his sharkskin suits
Some say the bear took a flop
They couldn't believe it when they saw him drop
 
He had a left like Henry's hammer
A right like Betty Bamalam
Rode with the muggers in the dark and dread
And all them sluggers went down like lead
 
Joe Louis was his hero he tried to be the same
But a criminal child wears a ball and chain
So the civil rights people didn't want him on the throne
And the hacks and the cops wouldn't leave him alone
 
Beware the bear's in town somebody's money says
The bear's going down
Yeah, the bear never smiles
Sonny's going down for miles and miles
Sonny's going down for miles and miles
 
At the foot of his bed with his feet on the floor
There was dope in his veins and a pistol on the drawer
There was no investigation as such
He hated needles but he knew too much
 
Cris-crossed on his back
Scars from his daddy like slavery tracks
The second-last child was the second-last king
Never  again was it the same in the ring
 
He had a left like Henry's hammer
A right like Betty Bamalam
Rode with the muggers in the dark and dread
And all them sluggers went down like lead
 
They never could be sure about the day he was born
A motherless child set to working on the farm
And they never could be sure about the day he died
The bear was the king they cast aside

They're welding her rudder scrubbing her keel

I know all the people there's nobody new
Soon we'll be leaving with the same old crew
On the green water the tumbling sea
 
They ain't running like the good old days
Time's just slipping down the old slipways

Dark is the night
I need a guiding light to keep me
From foundering on the rocks
 
My only prayer 
Is just to see you there at the end
Of my wandering back in the dock
 
I could use a layoff getting my strength back
But there's a loan to pay off and a few skip jack
So it's a turnaround back in the southerly wind
 
Pirates coming in to steal our gold
You can count yourself lucky with a profit in the hold
In the dock when we come in

Treachery and treason, there's always an excuse for it
And when I find the reason I still can't get used to it

What have you got to take away?

Walking thirty miles with a sack on his back
And he put down his load where he thought it was the best
Made a home in the wilderness

He built a cabin and a winter store
And he ploughed up the ground by the cold lake shore
And the other travellers came walking down the track
And they never went further, no, they never went back

Then came the churches, then came the schools
Then came the lawyers, then came the rules
Then came the trains and the trucks with their load
And the dirty old track was the Telegraph Road

Then came the mines, then came the ore
Then there was the hard times, then there was a war
Telegraph sang a song about the world outside

Like a rolling river

Three lanes moving slow

I've got a right to go to work but there's no work here to be found
Yes, and they say we're gonna have to pay what's owed
We're gonna have to reap from some seed that's been sowed

And the birds up on the wires and the telegraph poles
They can always fly away from this rain and this cold
You can hear them singing out their telegraph code
All the way down the Telegraph Road

Well, I'd sooner forget, but I remember those nights
Yeah, life was just a bet on a race between the lights
You had your hand on my shoulder, you had your hand in my hair
Now you act a little colder like you don't seem to care

But just believe in me baby and I'll take you away
From out of this darkness and into the day
From these rivers of headlights, these rivers of rain
From the anger that lives on the streets with these names
'Cause I've run every red light on memory lane
I've seen desperation explode into flames
And I don't wanna see it again

From all of these signs saying ""sorry but we're closed""

But all I can do is hand it to you
And your latest trick

My door was standing open
Security was laid back and lax
But it was only my heart got broken
You must have had a pass key made out of wax
You played robbery with insolence
And I played the blues in twelve bars on Lover's Lane
And you never did have the intelligence to use
The twelve keys hanging off my chain

I don't know how it happened
It all took place so quick
But all I can do is hand it to you
And your latest trick

Now it's past last call far alcohol
Past recall has been here and gone
The landlord finally paid us all
The satin jazzmen have put away their horns
And we're standing outside of these wonderlands
Looking so bereaved and so bereft
Like a bowery bum when he finally understands
The bottle's empty and there's nothing left

I don't know how it happened
It was faster than the eye could flick
But all I can do is hand it to you
And your latest trick",Your Latest Trick,2005

Mark Knopfler,"Getting crazy on the waltzers but it's the life that I choose
Sing about the six blade sing about the switchback and a torture tattoo
And I been riding on a ghost train where the cars they scream and slam
And I don't know where I'll be tonight but I'd always tell you where I am

In a screaming ring of faces I seen her standing in the light
She had a ticket for the races just like me she was a victim of the night
I put my hand upon the lever said let it rock and let it roll
I had the one arm bandit fever there was an arrow through my heart and my soul

And the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above
And I'm just high on the world
Come on and take a low ride with me girl
On the tunnel of love

It's just the danger when you're riding at your own risk
She said you are the perfect stranger she said baby let's keep it like this
It's just a cakewalk twisting baby step right up and say
Hey mister give me two give me two 'cause any two can play

And the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above
And I'm just high on the world
Come on and take a low ride with me girl
On the tunnel of love

Well it's been money for muscle another whirligig
Money for muscle another girl I dig
Another hustle just to make it big
And rock away rock away

And girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did
Like the Spanish city to me when we were kids
Oh girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did
Like the Spanish city to me when we were kids

She took off a silver locket she said remember me by this
She put her hand in my pocket I got a keepsake and a kiss
And in the roar of dust and diesel I stood and watched her walk away
I could have caught up with her easy enough but something must have made me stay

And the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above
And I'm just high on the world
Come on and take a low ride with me girl
On the tunnel of love

And now I'm searching through these carousels and the carnival arcades
Searching everywhere from steeplechase to palisades
In any shooting gallery where promises are made
To rock away rock away from Cullercoats and Whitley bay out to rock away

And her blue tick hound dog Gideon,
Sittin on the front porch cooling in the shade
Singin every song the radio played
Waitin for the Alabama sun to go down
Two red dirt girls in a red dirt town
Me and Lillian
Just across the line and a little southeast of Meridian.

She loved her brother I remember back when
He was fixin up a '49 Indian
He told her 'Little sister, gonna ride the wind
Up around the moon and back again""
He never got farther than Vietnam,
I was standin there with her when the telegram come
For Lillian.
Now he's lyin somewhere about a million miles from Meridian.

She said there's not much hope for a red dirt girl
Somewhere out there is a great big world
That's where I'm bound
And the stars might fall on Alabama
But one of these days I'm gonna swing
My hammer down
Away from this red dirt town
I'm gonna make a joyful sound

She grew up tall and she grew up thin
Buried that old dog Gideon
By a crepe myrtle bush in the back of the yard,
Her daddy turned mean and her mama leaned hard
Got in trouble with a boy from town
Figured that she might as well settle down
So she dug right in
Across a red dirt line just a little south east from Meridian

She tried hard to love him but it never did take
It was just another way for the heart to break
So she dug right in.
But one thing they don't tell you about the blues
When you got em
You keep on falling cause there ain't no bottom
There ain't know end.
At least not for Lillian

Nobody knows when she started her skid,
She was only twenty seven and she had five kids.
Coulda' been the whiskey,
Coulda been the pills,
Coulda been the dream she was trying to kill.
But there won't be a mention in the news of the world
About the life and the death of a red dirt girl

Who never got any farther across the line than Meridian.

Mark Knopfler,"It was pretty this morning
Put some flowers in the ground
Sun was shining this morning
Planted flowers all around

Got my business out of the way
And all I want to do is not one bad thought
One bad thought

Oh, yeah

I got a mockingbird
It sings the song out on the breathe
Sometime they sit up on my chimney
Then they take it up to the trees

Lord, he must have been hearing my old guitar
I believe he does it better than me
Don't have not one bad thought
Not one bad thought, no

My mama was a Cherokee
Spread her little laugh on a river fall
She had seven kids and let us know
There was plenty of room in her arms

She would start the day with a smile on her face
And not one bad thought, not one bad thought
Not one bad thought, not one bad thought

Not one bad thought
Not one bad thought
Just wondering

This isn't what I'd want
Pullin' old night fighters

Now I'm stalkin' this old Doris
With lascivious intent
And I'm behind, behind with the rent

Just a little duck and dive
And a bit of wheel and deal
She'll remind me I'm alive
She'll remind me I still feel

Just a little shellin' out
For a bit of you-know-what
I know this is all about
Somethin' that I never got, oh

Well, this crumpet's past its sell-by-date
But they all would qualify

A clarinet squeals to be free
Accordions hop from the shelves to the floor
Start playing their polkas to me

Fingers are pointing at you
And you take work in hell, be glad it?s not worse

Air pistols shoot out the lights

Could shatter the windows down Brick Lane tonight

See my boys and my beautiful girls
Garden of Eden, no gates or barbed wire
Who knows, maybe gates made of pearls

Well, if we go to heaven, and some say we don't
But if there's a reckoning day
Please God, I?ll see You and maybe I won't
I've a bag packed to go either way

Redeeming your pledge, dear, I?ll keep it for you
It?s not gonna go anywhere
But your soul, your soul, that is not what I do
There's not a lot I can do there

You've been away roamin' far away from here
Weathered a storm, your heart unafraid
Crossed every ocean in the boat that you made

Been blowin' your horn, scarin' the spooks
No crotchets or quavers in your books
Gone sailin' all night, straight in the vein
Like a bird on his own flight in his domain

In the sky
In the sky

Runnin' in on the tide with the first of the stars
The moon on the water and the sound of guitars
Glide into the homin' as the night falls
Tie up in the haven by the old harbor wall

And the hard-bitten stranger, deaf as a post
Who stands at the fire where a poet's dreams roast
He can't know the story, he can't feel the pain
And all of the glory falls around him like rain

In the sky

Mind he's strictly rhythm he doesn't want to make them cry or sing

She's a dead ship sailing skeleton crew

What's left of the stew?

The hangman steps in to do what he's paid for

They pull out her cables and hack off her hatches
Too poor to be wasteful with pity or time
They swarm on her carcass with torches and axes
Like a whale on a bloody shore line

Stripped of her pillars her stays and her stanchions
When there's only her bones on the wet poison land
Steel ropes will drag her with winches and engines
'Til it's only a stain on the sea

Mark Knopfler,"I was a highwayman
Along the coach roads I did ride
With the sword and pistol by my side
And many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
And many a soldier shed his life blood on my blade
They fin'lly hung me in the spring of '25
But I am still alive

I was a sailor
And I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide
I sailed a schooner 'round the horn of Mexico
I went aloft to furl the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they say that I got killed
But I am living still

I was a dam builder
Across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around
Seems like it all goes 'round and 'round
And 'round and 'round

I'll fly a starship
Across the universe divide
Until I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again
And again, and again, and again.",Highwayman,2010

Before the city symphony of taxi horns

Sitting here and waiting on the beating of my heart. 

Last night I thought I heard my name
Well it was too dark to see, but it had to be,
The voice was just the same 
That's the way it always starts,
Sitting here and waiting on the beating of my heart. 

So tell me why should it have to be this way
Why can't it be all right,
Why can't I sleep at night?

Mark Knopfler,"Oh all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
I let it slip gladly past the hands of my friends
To tie up the time most forcefully.
But the bottles are done,
We've killed each one
And the table's full and overflowed.
And the corner sign
Says it's closing time,
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.

Oh ev'ry girl that ever I've touched,
I did not do it harmfully.
And ev'ry girl that ever I've hurt,
I did not do it knowin'ly.
But to remain as friends and make amends
You need the time and stay behind.
And since my feet are now fast
And point away from the past,
I'll bid farewell and be down the line.

Oh ev'ry foe that ever I faced,
The cause was there before we came.
And ev'ry cause that ever I fought,
I fought it full without regret or shame.
But the dark does die
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
Must meet the dawn.
And if I see the day
I'd only have to stay,
So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone.

Oh, ev'ry thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung.
But it's not to stand naked under unknowin' eyes,
It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung.
But the time ain't tall,
Yet on time you depend and no word is possessed
By no special friend.
And though the line is cut,
It ain't quite the end,
I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.

Oh a false clock tries to tick out my time
To disgrace, distract, and bother me.
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face,
And the dust of rumors covers me.
But if the arrow is straight
And the point is slick,
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick.
So I'll make my stand
And remain as I am
And bid farewell and not give a damn.",Restless Farewell [#],2012

Mark Knopfler,"Pennies from heaven
Don’t make me laugh
Here all you’ll get
Is the pattering rain
Or yon two crows up over the hill
Looking for winterkill
Always at your boots
The mud behind the byre
With its clammy hold
Would mock you up a grave
Here in the mire of a wrecked sheepfold

And all you’ll bring to this
Is muscle and grit
Persistence, that’s just about it
What made you think
There’d be a living in sheep?
Eat, work, eat, work and sleep

Duck under the eaves
Of the bothy
To sit here, caged by rain
Somewhere to go conjure
A next move
When I have to think again
The dog lifts his gaze to plead
Believes the wizard has a magic stick
Leans his weight into my tweed
I give an unholy hand to lick

I take a swig of sheep dip
From my flask
And once again I ask
What made you think
There’d be a living in sheep?
Eat, work, eat, work and sleep

They were at this game
Two hundred years ago
Had thirty ways
Of dying young, poor souls
Laid to rest in their soggy rows
Rain on their holy books
Blood and whiskey
On the tongue
And no-one watching over anyone
No-one left but your stubborn one
And the crows and rooks

Ah, the dying young
Well I’m not done
You watch me and I’ll watch thee
I can still work for two men
And drink for three

And I raise my flask
To the clearing skies
To you, sweepers
You carrion spies
To scavenge and survive
If you can do it so can I",Yon Two Crows,2012

A copy boy at the Chronicle
Five cigarettes and two silver half crowns
Meeting Vince at Mark Toney’s in town
Boy, do we get around

Basil sits there on the table for subs
But not a part of the Bri-nylon club
Ancient blue sweater, too old for the job
Bored out of his mind
With the Colins and Bobs

And I’m up for the world
And I’ve kissed a Gateshead girl

A cloud over Grainger Street
Over the black church
Over the Black Gate
And the shadowy Keep

At the fish and chip words
He’s supposed to dish up and forget
His drudgery now has become slightly blurred
By one of his Players untipped cigarettes

Christmas Eve in a nowhere band

Climbing up into that truck
With your old bag and your guitar

Leaves him on a high crossroads
Where he can see for miles around

And everything is white and bare

Mark Lanegan,"A cripple on his deathbed
In a daydream did ride
All past the streams of fire
On a petal path did glide

He left his wheelchair spinning
Deeper in the mud
In it set his memories
In its body and its blood

An angel came to greet him
By his side she flew
Whispered, as a part of him
What he already knew

His head was spinning freely
And it was plain to see
His burden was himself, he bore
The sight his eyes could be

His death, it died quite easily
Right there, was gone for good
But couldn't see his loved one
Like he thought he should

He thought if they were gone, said he
And this cannot be true
The search to find what wasn't there
Has brought him back to you

And when you're lost I feel it too

Has grown to be a deep sea diver

And twilight falls again
To the funny sound that a blackbird makes
Twilight falls again
As no good reason remains, I'll do the same
Thinking of you
One day a ship comes in, one day a ship comes in
But I can't say how or when
But I know somewhere the ship comes in every day
There is no morphine, I'm only sleeping
There is no crime to dreams like this
And if you could take something with you
It would be right
Something good
From my fingertips, the cigarette throws ashes to the ground
I'd stop and talk to the girls who work this street, but I got business farther down
Like one long season of rain, I will remain
Thinking of you
One day a ship comes in
From far away a ship comes in
One hundred days you wait for it
And you know somewhere the ship comes in every day
There is no morphine, I'm only sleeping

And if you could take something with you
It would be bright

Walks the hallway knocking door to door

Why suddenly your room is turnin' cold

Singing in the tree
Outside my window
Looking down on me
Give me a reason
Something to believe
Another season
I will sit and grieve

That bad old sun
Forever shining on
The world keeps turning
Though my hope is gone
I close my eyes
And when the day is done
I hang my head
And dream about no one

Show me direction
And I'm good to go
I'm trying hard
Always fall so low
And when I fall
There'll be another star
I'm chasing my tail
Always running

Oh it is so hard
With the answers I find
Weary of heart
Weary soul
Weak of mind
Oh it is so hard

Now you heard my song
Will you turn and go
Give me a reason
And I'll say it's so
If you stand by me
I could never leave

You'd be the reason

Trouble, oh trouble
Haven't slipped a day in years

Leave our memory far behind you
Down the line I will remind you
Listen how I love you

Mark Lanegan,"Who built the road that led to my self esteem
Twisted and crushed black metal and bones
Who passed the buck who pressed my flesh to yours
Spilling like wine and sweeter than tears

Oh I hope we more than survive
With trembling visions that terrify
So who built the road, who turned it all around
Pick though the wreck scramble in the dust

Who built the road, who was the foolish one
Step at a time two hearts in the fire
Who lit the touch, who fanned the flames
With sparks in the dust, spent rivers of desire

Oh why don't we learn from mistakes
We stumble along with so many more to make
So who built the road, who could foresee
That the answers we sought were many miles to go

We were so lonely at times
Fading away, sitting side by side
And we built the road, we were the chain gang

Dark angel within the everlasting fire",Who Built the Road,2008

I come undone, I come undone
Come undone, babe, I come undone

Took my only flame, took my one desire
Threw it all away when jumping in the fire

I can’t escape my mind

From a broken bough
Fall into finite space
With the roof torn down
This house is an empty place
So tired of wandering around and starting over
No garden grows here now just the one leaf clover
And when the windows shuttered
It’s always dark inside
Sometimes the pain is absurd
Still it’s what fate decides
Thought I saw Jesus come down
Dressed like a soldier
I used to cry like a clown
And now I’m older

Here come the lonely night
Can’t escape my mind

And the grinding wheel turns
And the heavens burn
As the pilot ignites is a lesson learned
A sullen look of concern
It might make you sad
Like the fluttering bird in a dream you had

'Cause they want to shake your chain?

So I could slow down
So I could slow down, yeah

Spare me a chance, I've wasted mine
Shine on me light, don't you know I would
Reach for you there if only I could?

And I like being alone and I can take living low
Forgive my being cruel if ever I was say a word for me too

Mark Levine,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2003

Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,

And there's nothing short of dying

With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song

Can't you see what I'm trying to do
Doing my best to try to get to you
Don't you hear what I'm trying to say 
All the right words but still you run away 
Come on, come on baby don't you get me
Alright, don't it seem that when you love somebody
Ain't it right that somebody loves you too 
But I know my love is going somewhere
But I'm sure it ain't being got by you 
And it's true won't you try, won't you try 
Let me, let me, let me
Baby don't you get me
Come on baby, don't you get me
Come on baby, won't you let me",Let Me!,1997
Mark Lindsay,"Read the news in the Times today...said the world is goin' round (world is
goin' round)
I don't care what somebody said, somebody always puts 'em down (always puts
'em down)
Red or yellow, black or white
Are you left-handed or are you right
When you open your eyes can you see the light
Do you wake up screamin' in the middle of the ni-i-i-ight

Too much talk, and not enough action
Do you know anybody gettin' satisfaction
Everbody wonders 'bout the crowd's reaction.
And the world gets better by a very small fraction.

Turn around til you see a face and it won't be very long (Won't be very long)
Someone soon will be in your place and it won't be very wrong (won't be very
wrong)
Red or yellow, black or white...

[Chorus]

Now's our chance to change the world,
Change the world with love, with love...

[Chorus]",Too Much Talk,1997
Mark Lindsay,"I remember back a long time ago,
In the days of my childhood.
In the evening when the sun was sinking low,
Walking in the wildwood.
Skippin' and flippin' through the flowers,
We'd go hand in hand.
Looking back on all the happy hours,
Anyone could understand.

[Chorus]
You and me, babe.
Sure 'nuff got to be, babe,
Birds of a feather.
We should be together
Like birds of a feather.
Got to be together
Like birds of a feather.

You and I didn't have a lot of friends,
Didn't have too much to say.
So they never would let us join in,
All the games they used to play.
Seems like it was only yesterday,
Down at Lincoln Junior High.
I remember what the kids used to say,
As we'd go strolling by.

[Chorus]

Time goes rolling by.
They say that you and I must go our separate ways.
But birds of a feather will always be together.

Your folks didn't want me hanging 'round.
Said that I was bad for you.
So we'd meet on the other side of town,
Down a long dark avenue.
But they can't keep the two of us apart,
As long as you really love me,
I got a feeling way down in my heart,
That's the way it's gonna be.

[Chorus]",Birds of a Feather,1997
Mark Lindsay,"Take the ribbon from your hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Layin' soft upon my skin
Like the shadows on the wall
 
Come and lay down by my side
Till the early mornin' light
All I'm takin' is your time
Help me make it through the night
 
I don't care who's right or wrong
I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Lord tonight I need a friend
 
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone",Help Me Make It Thourgh the Night,1998
Mark Lindsay,"I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now
Never can say goodbye

Even though the pain and heartache
Seem to follow me wherever I go
Though I try and try to hide my feelings
They always seem to show,

Then you try to say you're leaving me
And I always have to say no
Tell me why is it so

That I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now
Never can say goodbye

Every time I think I've had enough
And start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
Piercing me right through the core
It says, turn around, you fool
You know you love him more and more
Tell me why is it so

Don't wanna let you go
I never can say goodbye girl
Ooh ooh baby (don't wanna let you go girl)
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no
Ooh, oh I never can say goodbye girl
Ooh ooh ooh (don't wanna let you go girl)
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no, ooh

Never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now
Never can say goodbye

I keep thinking that our problems
Soon are all gonna work out
But there's that same unhappy feeling
There's that anguish, there's that doubt
It's the same old dizzy hangup
Can't do with you or without
Tell me why is it so
Don't wanna let you go

I never can say goodbye girl
Ooh ooh baby (hey baby)
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no
Ooh, oh I never can say goodbye girl
Ooh oh (hey baby)
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no, ooh
I never can say goodbye girl
Ooh ooh baby (hey baby)
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no
Ooh, oh I never can say goodbye girl
Ooh oh (hey baby)",Never Can Say Goodbye,1998
Mark Lindsay,"When you're down and troubled
And you need a helping hand
And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend

If the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep you head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at you door

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there

Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend
You've got a friend

Ain't it good to know you've got a friend
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend",You've Got a Friend,1998
Mark Lindsay,"They took the whole Cherokee nation
Put us on this reservation
Took away our ways of life
The tomahawk and the bow and knife
Took away our native tongue
And taught their English to our young
And all the beads we made by hand
Are nowadays made in Japan

Cherokee people
Cherokee tribe
So proud to live
So proud to die

They took the whole Indian nation
Locked us on this reservation
Though I wear a shirt and tie
I'm still part redman deep inside

Cherokee people
Cherokee tribe
So proud to live
So proud to die

But maybe someday when they learn
Cherokee nation will return, will return
Will return, will return, will return",Indian Reservation (The Lament Of The Cherokee Reservation Indian),1999
Mark Lindsay,"Like a grain of sand
That wants to be
A rolling stone
I want to be the man
I'm not
And have the things
I really haven't got
And that's a lot

There'll be joy
And there'll be laughter
Something big is what I'm after now
Yes, it's what I'm after now

After taking, take up giving
Something big is what I'm living for
Yes, it's what I'm living for
Living for

Why do I go on
And fill my life with little things
When there are big things I must do
And lots of dreams
That really should come true
Before I'm through?

There'll be joy
After taking, take up giving",Something Big,1999
Mark Lindsay,"I wanna tell you a story every man oughta know

If you want a little lovin' you gotta start real slow

She gonna love you tonight, if you just treat her right
Oh squeeze her real gentle, you gotta make her feel good

Tell her that you love her like you know you should

She gonna love you tonight if you just treat her right
If you practice my method just as hard as you can

You gonna get a reputation as a lovin' man

Yeah, you'll be glad every night that you're treatin' her right

Mark Lindsay,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!",The Christmas Song,2003
Mark Lindsay,"Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!",Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!,2003
