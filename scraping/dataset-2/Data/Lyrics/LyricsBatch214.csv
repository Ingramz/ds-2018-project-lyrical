Black male hard MC 
Rap record slave  a brother on the scene 
with a machine gun and one magazine 
Wanted  a half a million for the body alone 
Two million for the microphone 

If you see him  dial 5 dash slayer 
A hotline to the governor and mayor 
He's armed wit ammo  a weapon that's mine 
All black in rap  strap tech nine 
Silencer clipped, check the rip on the sneak tip 
The boy's about ta flip

Code name MD, rappin fanatic 
No short taken, black Asiatic 
Hit man, keeps my belt unbuckled 
Book a look on my grill with no signs of a chuckle 
Or laughter, cause my name ain't Casper 
The Friendly Ghost, but I smoke an MC if I have to 
Quick fast like Alakazoo, Alakazam 
And I'll be damned, 'cause my rhymes slam like Bam-Bam 
Rubble, partner code name is E-Double 
It's those hazel green eyes that keep my man in trouble 
Girls ride the tip, brothers on his sac 
I had to change my name to Bruce Wayne, also known as Bat- 
Man, and grab the bozack wit this hand 

As I slay ya manslaughter 
Manslaughter 
They call him manslaughter 
Manslaughter 

Mad man fully strapped and I quote 
Don't flex, last chump who did, he got smoked 
Undercover, not D-T but E-D 
And wonder why you're spinning my records on thirty-three 
I'm the original, never did crime, I'm no criminal 
No static, pack a forty-five automatic 
Black cat strapped in rap, holding my Johnson 
Walking the streets, a vigilante Charles Bronson 
As the beat kick, face his plate on the M1 done 
Style's sharper than the blade in Shogun 
First suckers disrupt the brain of a sucker MC 
That can't count one two three 
I manage to damage, I roast the whole membrane 
Insane, like a basehead doing cocaine 
I kill a farmer, plus his daughter 

Cause I'm the E-Double, and this is manslaughter 
They call us manslaughter 
They call it manslaughter 
Manslaughter 

As I stare deep into the mirror, I could only resort 
To a hardcore gangsta, penile train of thought 
You're stomped out, you're beat down, you go big top shit 
Run your trunk jewels or get, pistol whipped 
Cause I'm too swift to slip or miss a stitch on my rap hit 
Sleep on a sucker and you still can't get with 
Me bro, wit this flow and I don't know Judo 

Gunflow is my style, say this so that you know 
There's no time to dance or romance with a nuisance 
Play ya like a puppet to put some lead in ya pants 
Then off you go to the rap rat pack 
Be stripped of your mic, punk on your head we stamped bozack 
That's what the doctor ordered 
Take two of these, dead, manslaughter 

They call it manslaughter 
They call it manslaughter

EPMD,"Slow down baby

Cause you can get rugged, tough, hard like P
Tried to play my man but you couldn't touch me
You faggot, no comp' rapper on a quest
To get your head flown boy, you must be loc' on sess
Cause many often wonder is M.D. paid
You're God damn right punk, stay outta my way
Cause I clock G's while you clock Z's
And I don't smoke crack, I smoke MC's
So pick up a pen, cop a squat, and take note
A rapper suffered from bleedin, sprains and slit throats
Cause my style, deadly psychopath schizophrenic
A rapper choke like a carburetor, freeze up and panic
Cause I clock pesos, don't sell llello
'Nother word for cocaine mi amigo
That's Spanish, terminology for friend
Now sit back and ride my bozack as I send
Bass funk, with beats that thump
For speakers and amps, cold lined up in my trunk
My system's crankin my headlights are blinkin
Brothers ridin my tip L, at the same time thinkin DAMN
How could a brother be so nice?
Cause I'm the capital, P-E twice, M-D-E twice
I choose to squeeze, some choose to fight
I like to write but then again some bite
And while you was bangin on tables;
I was bangin Snow White P!

Slow down baby

The Ripper, the master, the overlordian'
Playing MC's like a old accordion
I get the inspiration from unnecessary station
Them sayin I was vacationin'
You can't quote with your weaker throat
Tryin to sneak a peek at how I freak the notes
Major MC's become minor B-flats
So retire the mic, get your chains and your bats
Here's your chance to advance, get in your stance
I shoot the holster off your cowboy pants
Pure entertainment, tonight's your arraignment
You're guilty - face down on the pavement!
No holds barred, it's time to get scarred
You and your squad better praise the real God
The undertaker, droppin' thunder on fakers
When it comes to lyrics I'm as freaky as Seka
So lay the mic down slow and careful
Cause mine is fully loaded and I got another handful
A clip to slip in and start rippin'
Divin' and dippin' and givin punks a whippin' (aww shit)
Just in case you wanna go a few rounds or so
I'm down so that you clowns'll know
Me gettin burnt or hurt won't be tolerated
I got rhymes up the huh forget it I'm constipated L!

Slow down baby

When I come around homeboy, watch your nugget
A master on the beatdown, my style's rugged
When I attack the microphone, close the zone
Rap sees danger, can't roam
Security's packed and wall to wall can't fall
A rap tank is full so I can't stall
My microphone is filled with premium
Any whack MC that flexes, I'm creamin' him
Not with lotion, bust the motion
Flotation when I rock on the mic, I'm like coastin'
I'm unique, fatigued at my peak you still seek
A style cause yours extra weak
New method, to rip the stage at my age
And get loose and kick, like Bruce in a rage
I'm on a rampage

Slow down baby",Rampage,1990
EPMD,"[Erick Sermon]
G, man, do I have the power like He-Man
To crack a wack MC's head, open like a pea can
Damn, my name should become Sam
But I prefer, a grand royal for the jam
I'm putting heads out, the guns I use to pump lead out
Hey son, I suggest that you head out
I total, cremate, striking mic flakes
I won't break, I make more nerds than a earthquake
Strong, got more strength than King Kong
I'm worldwide, I'm interviewed like Kaity Chung
I'm on now, live at 12, it's so dope
All the way to 4 o'clock, there no soaps
I'm able to rock the mic nice and stable
It's a chance that you might see me on cable
Vision, Showtime or HBO with the flow
Getting more play than Rambo
Hey yo, what a you know, party people, rap is outta control
Rap is outta control, it's definitely, fuckin outta control
Rap is outta control, rap is definitely is outta control
It's outta control, rap is outta control

[PMD]
Straight from the underground, where
universal beat down is a mush
Yo, I stuck crab MC, E (too late, he got crushed)
Was he a pop rap singer, R&B swinger
Fagot who jumped the gate and now you get the finger
In other words, it's absurd to try to get wit
The brother from Brentwood, Long Island, nicknamed Swift Lip
I'm too smooth and yes, I groove to the slam track
Wit a Beck's in my right hand, left hand on bozack
I moved on ya posse, first reaction was ""Oh shit
Let's do that brother, hell no (why) he's too quick""
So dial 1-900-55-eat-shit
I pack a twelve shot nine mil and yes I still kick
(What) ass like a jock (height) 6'3"" and stocky
(Rap name) not Balboa, so motherfuck Rocky
I'm the mainstream supreme, slamming like Aikeem
The Dream, and yes sometimes it may seem that

Rap is outta control [Repeat: x2]
Sure dude, rap-rap-rap-rap-rap, for sure dude
Rap is outta control, yes, yes y'all, yes y'all
Yes y'all, yes y'all, kick it E

[Erick Sermon]
I stand tall, I won't fall, I recall
Ha ha, your rhymes stall
When I bust caps, until they Kryptonite caps
I reign of steel, I swap bullets like that
I'm like, Superman, fly high up in the sky
And if you try to shoot me down, clown, I won't die
I cremate

[PMD]
I hate, let's exterminate
Wait for a second, E, time to debate
As I take my fisherman hat off, there's no hat
For an MC on a trail of a mad comeback",Rap Is Outta Control,1990

Refrain: 
[Comin' straight from the Underground] 4x 
Erick Sermon: 
As I pump up a brand new funk swing  
and bring back the chill of thrill from B.B. King. 
Old fashioned is the way that I be waxin' a MC  
I bust a grill  and the reaction I check  
inspect  make sure the head's wrecked; 
[crunch] snap a neck for some live effects. 
A machine  my functioning  that's mean. 
I stay together  my man  like Al Green. 
I'm a slayer, the E-are-I-see-K and I'm back 
to attack a punk chump that ain't sayin' jack. 
Boom, I'm buckwild when I'm stoned, 
I close only one eye like a cyclone. 
So I throw on my black shades that's rhinestone, 
summer to my Benz that's outlined in chrome. 
I'm the Grand Royal MC, I'm no joke. 
I hit like a Phillie Blunt when it's toked. 
I smoke, an MC well-done, he gets done. 
I'm knockin' out wack MCs like Michael Nunn. 
Full-power, one punch, crunch, I'm throwin' bolos. 
I'm strapped heavy, my handguns that's solo. 
I'm packed when it's time to get down. 
'cause Erick Sermon's comin' straight from the Underground... 
Refrain 4x 
PMD: 
Okie dokie. My mind gets slow-pokey when I toke the 
bull from a Phillie Blunt and I hope me 
Old Gold is cold when I pop the cap. 
Take a sip and then blitz, then crack a back with a rhyme sack. 
'cause I'm too smooth, pay my dues, and can't lose. 
I'm Top Gun, pullin' bitches like Tom Cruise. 
And my main man, D-Wade, still gets paid. 
And in the off-season, we vacate in the shade. 
So all hail the Mary, crack the Moet, 
blast the boom-box, then act like George and Jet-son. 
'cause my style, similar to Tae Kwon Do, but hey-yo, 
I don't kick or throw stars, this brother flows 
to the funk track, with 808 drops for prop the top 
of druggin' or thuggin, D.T.s or cops. 
I say, no to blow and yes to cess and I suggest 
you put a buck on Lotto, and if you win, you should invest 
in a new grill, Bill, 'cause I rock non- until 
the Fat Lady sings, or Brooklyn starts to ill. 
There's a fat chance, with the brother bistro, 
'cause I'm the master of the quadraverb and the echo. 
There's no time to stop, so P keep on steppin' 
on the edge of the frame of the mind, the nine is the weapon. 
That I choose to squeeze when a brother acts wild. 
One slug to the head, mafioso style. 
You catch a Universal beat down with sounds that pound, 
watch yourself son, I'm comin' straight from the underground.

Roll with the hardcore funk, the hardcore sound
Let's get wit this, mackadocious funk material
So simple, when I rock wit the instrumental
Who am I (E-D the Green Eyed Bandit)
Control my career so I can never get stranded
But the rest are gettin Brand Nubian
Changed up they style, from jeans to suits and
Thinking about a pop record, somethin' made for the station
For a whole new relation
Ship of a new type of scene
To go platinum and clock mad green
AKA, a sellout, the rap definition
Get off that boy, change your mission
Come back around the block
Pump Color Me Badd to the ah, tick tock
Let them know your logo, not a black thing
My background sing, my background sing for the crossover

The rap era's outta control, brother's sellin' their soul
To go gold, going, going, gone, another rapper sold
(To who) To pop and R&B, not the MD
I'm strictly hip-hop, I'll stick to Kid Capri
Funk mode, yeah, kid, that's how the Squad rolls
I know your head is bobbin' cuz the neck knows
(Not like other rappers) frontin' on they fans, they ill
Trying to chill, saying ""damn, it be great to sell a mill""
Thats when the mind switch to the pop tip
(Kid, you're gonna be large)
Yea right, that's what the company kicks
Forget the black crowds, you're wack now
In a zoot suit, frontin' black lookin' mad foul
I speak for the hardcore (rough, rugged and raw)
I'm outta here, catch me chillin' on my next tour
From the US to the white cliffs of Dover
Strictly underground funk, keep the crossover

You know you should be rocking the fans wit something diesel
But you insist to piss me off black
So I flex the biceps so I can push em back
So real hardcore hip-hop continue wreck it
And all sucker MCs duck down and get the message
So ban the crossover, yo, who's wit me
(Hit Squad) yea, P, hit me

Another megablast funky dope style from cross yonder
(So help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda)
(Yo, from what) the crossover, yea crossing you over
Outta here, gone, peace, nice to know ya (see ya)
What a way to go out, no clout is what the fans will shout
Cause you got gassed and took the wrong route
Came on the scene, chillin', freakin' a funky dope line
But when they finish wit you (beep) flatline
Some say there's no business like show business
But if this the truth, please explain why is this

Still I haven't seen one rapper livin' comfortably
No time to pick and wish on a four leaf clover

Well, it's the E wit the juice, I'm down to get loose 
Strapped in black wit the nine by the boots 
Hardcore funk that make ya want to pump a chump 
My posse's thick  so I will never get jumped 
The slayer, a beast from the east, I'm psycho 
If I had a glove, I would be Bad as Michael 
Some say, yo, I sound rugged 
Pack wit the ultimate rap wit the Power like Snap 
A.K.A. the Mic Wrecker 
A rap star wit the boomin style, black as tar 
Smokin, the E's no jokin, so don't trip or flip 
And make a hit, so bust it 
Some ain't feel the way I do when I get wreck 
No half steppin, I kick back like a weapon 
On the microphone, I delight 
And groovy, a California quake couldn't move me 

Get on down [x4]
It's going down [x2]

[PMD]
No lights, no camera, but lots of action 
No moonwalkin backwards, kid, like Michael Jackson 
Strictly funk flows and steel toed Timb boots to troop 
State to state, stage to stage, as I clock loot 
Black Asiatic, rapper fanatic, automatic 
Black nine mil is what I pack so kill the static 
EPMD quench the sound of thumps underground 
Ya stupid boy, no props here, you catch a beatdown 
The Squad still in effect, no record skippin 
Ya stupid boy, keep the track, still bullshittin 
Down wit the rap pack, still grabbin my bozack 
Here's a ticket kid to ride the Jim like Amtrak 
Got mad skills, hi-tech, been known to snap necks

One, no grill, no charcoal, no fluid 
Act like Bo Jackson, Nike, and Just Do It 
If there's a problem, the Hit Squad rolls mad deep 
So I can rest my head and get some sleep 
While the E-Double, takes a nap, no time to slack 
It's my turn to guard the fort, ready for combat 
Guns and violence, that we don't promote 
Just takin what's ours kid, chill or smell the gunsmoke 
As I pull out, squeezin like Mr. Charmin 
Destroyin posses of demo tapes like Agent Orange

Joys of funk, produce a song to make my fans sing 
Singing, swinging, hum along, thump my rap song 
I bet I get wreck on a DL, then the P's gone 

Poof, no phone booth, cape, or tight suit 
Dress in all black, black skullcap, black down goose 
To hide the mock bird, word, wit the pistol grip 
Squeeze em quick, show who's crossing wit the loose lip 

Because loose lips sink ships, don't need a ship to catch a nine clip 
I ain't going out on some bull
Bankshot, corner pocket, now watch me rock it 
Can't mock the rap style so, boy, stop it

Must get deep and think quick, bang a set-up 
Let met get my coat 
Alright move slow when you get up 
PT's in my crib, K9's in the front lawn 
First thought's to wild, second thought to stay calm 
You have the right to remain silent 
Cool with the roughness, I ain't violent 
Reached for his nine mil, partner started smiling 
Shut up Mulley, turn around and keep your mouth shut 
Peep the neighbor's starin as he reached for his handcuffs 
Threw on the bracers squeeze tight to increase the pain

Sit up straight, state your name and your birthdate 
And your whereabouts last night about eight

Slow down? 
Something's missing, where's my lawyer? 
Cop grilled me and said 
Yo there's your lawyer 
Things'll get rough so don't get tough and try to play games 
You're headed up North 
For what? 
You know homeboy, the death of Jane 
You must be insane with no brains sniffin cocaine 
And if I caught a body it'd be yours and not Jane 
Or Mr. Toughy, you wish you had a nine to bust me 
I'm mad as hell, I don't play, my name ain't Dougie

Swung for my dome, ducked and caught my damn back

Take him downstairs and watch him make sure you're armed 
Cop grabbed me by my neck pushed me towards the damn door 
See my homies, locked down on the same floor 
So you want to be a killer and run the streets bro? 
Didn't respond, just chilled to play his ego 
Stepped in the men's room, still filthy from the ill broom 
Hurry up and take a piss and stop stallin you damn goon 
That was the wrong move, how stupid, time to go for mine

Knick knack patty whack give a dog a bone
Yo, don't give him nothing but a microphone
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
You said I'm not the E, you wanna make a bet?
Remember this: Lounge, you in the danger zone
I figured you would, now leave me alone
You pick and you wish on a four-leaf clover
To be the E double E over and over
You're intrigued by the way I do my thing
(Do what?) Pick up the mic high and make it swing

[PMD]
I have the capability to rap and chill
Cold wax and tax MC's who tend to act ill
It's like a Diggum Smack
Smack me and I'll smack you back
I get goosebumps when the baseline thumps
A sucker MC arrives, now it's time for lunch
When I'm cooling on the scene, I notice one thing
I'm not Bounce, so sucker MC's cling
I consider myself better than average
Yo, I rock the mic like a wild beast savage

[Erick Sermon]
I'm in the bottling state, I can't concentrate
I make a move like chess, and then I yell ""checkmate""
You know why I get zanier and zanier?
Because of EPMD mania
When I walk through the crowd I can see heads turning
I hear voices saying ""That's Erick Sermon""
Not only from the women, but from the men
You know what? It feels good, my friend

[PMD]
I'm the P double E, the Thrilla of Manilla
Better known as the MC cold killer
PMD cold keeps the place jumping
And if not then we feel like we owe you something
Like lotto, you have to be in it to win it
But if the beat is fresh then Diamond J will spin it
If J spin it, then it has to be fresh
To make you dance until there's no one left

Cause you a customer

[Erick Sermon]
Praying like a prey when the fox in action
I smell blood, no time for maxing
Camouflage in the green, my back is arc
Plus you in trouble cause it's after dark
My eyes close like Steve Austin, I got you in the square
I won't let you run, nah, that ain't fair
So I clear my visions until I can spot him
Snatch him by the neck and say ""Hmmm I got him""

[PMD]
Whenever MC's, you're in over your head
My rhymes are hungry plus they haven't been fed
The process of elimination is quite simple
Let you grow like a blackhead and pop you like a pimple
Slice you like lettuce, toss you like a salad
Revoke your MC license if your rhymes ain't valid
As we go on, sucker MC's sound wacker
Like a parrot says ""Polly want a cracker""

[Erick Sermon]
It was a record test, nothing we can't handle
At the house they had the mics on the mantle
Looked at the DJ and said ""May I?""
Lit it up like the Fourth of July
Because I float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Whoa, I'm the E of EPMD
I have a strong point of view on the way things run
Just shut up and listen and learn my son

[PMD]
Absorb that ass like Bounty, the quicker picker upper
To tell you up front, you're nothing but a sucker
The style we're using, no doubt copastetic
You try to bite and yet sound pathetic
Design my rhymes like a taylor, floatin' like a sailor
As the P gets stronger, MC's get staler
Not bragging or protagging, surely not fagging
MC's surrender, raise the flags and
Give up the titles because the signs are vital
I keep a voice tuned at a slow and swift idle

You a customer

[Erick Sermon]
I need a man meal sandwich, yes I need Manwich
I feel good, now it's time to do damage
I feel like balanced, you know what I mean?
Wanna rhyme one time, to release the steam
When I grab the mic I get dramatic like an actor
You know why I get over? I'm the master
I do a show, pack it in til it's clamming up
Look for the microphone then jam it up

[PMD]
You said you see me jamming in New York Tech
You got one right fella, you deserve a check
How did you know, you must have been jocking
How do you know the places I be rocking?
Don't follow me fella, every move that I make
I'm hostile now so I'll give you a break
Well search upon me but don't go past the limit
Here's a card and on the back is my fan club digits

[Erick Sermon]
There's two things to check out in the words that I'm saying
Plus listen to the good time playing
Bro is bad, the strings he's plucking
Fire rhyme after rhyme, watch MC's duck and

[PMD]
MC's, the final countdown
You look tired, can you go the round?
If you can, I'll slap your hand and give you credit
And if not, I'll turn around and say ""Forget it""

When I came out with my first rap jam
I had no idea that the record would slam
It did real good without radio play
Maybe at night but no airplay in the day

I couldn't understand why to be exact
Our music was good and I was far from whack
Then came the answer, commercial was the key
To get airplay and a spot on TV

Like Ed Lover and Doctor Dre from Yo, MTV Raps
A show, mainly for the black
And still we can't ill, 'cause to them that's wrong

Unless we sellout and kill the black movement dead
Which means swallow our pride and become flunkies instead
And stop the rap about freedom, thoughts of a black president
And rap about a black crack, the mayor in our residence

Give me a break brothers, it's time to take a stand
And kill that, ""No sir, yes sir, and thank you, ma'am""
'Cause the word is a luxury a black man can't afford
That's why poverty's on the rise and we still ignored

And it's a setback and yet the clock still ticks
And if we let it, rap would be run by politics
I read it somewhere that every man's created equal
But not in this day and age, maybe in the sequel

Which means next time, so observe these rhymes

By the kids at concerts who bum rush the doors

But what about the Beatles, G, and Elvis Presley
Same stuff was rough, rap does not cause violence

I just get down and I go for mine
Say 'check one-two', and run down the line

[Parrish Smith]
To the average MC I'm known as The Terminator
Funky beat maker, new jack exterminator
Destroy an employ', when your rhymes are not void
Never sweating your girl (Why P?) Cause she's a skeezoid
When I'm on the scene I always rock the spot
I grab the steel with the crown on top
In the beginning, I like to let my rhymes flow
And at twelve I press cruise control
Sit back and relax, let my rhymes tax
Maintain MC's while the Double E macks
Always calm under pressure, no need to act ill
Listen when I tell you boy, you gots to chill

(""Jungle boogie!"")

[Erick Sermon]
I be the personal computer information on rap
Like the B-I-Z Markie says, I'll make your toes tap
I format the rhymes, step by step
Make em sound def to maintain my rep
Prepared to come off, in case of a diss
Not worried about a thing, cause we can do this
I can turn the party out just by standing still
Make the ladies scream and shout while the brothers act ill
Take total control, of your body and soul
Pack a nine in my pants for when it's time to roll

[Parrish Smith]
I'm the P, double-E, M-D-E-E
And one thing I hate, is a biting MC
When I enter the party suckers always form a line
Then they ease their way up, and try to bite my lines
I did thousands of shows, dissed many faces
And deal with new jacks, on a one-to-one basis
But every now and then a sucker MC gets courageous
And like an epidemic it becomes contagious
But never the least they all R.I.P
For all those unaware it means Rest In Peace
Cause M.D. stands for Microphone Doctor
And the capital P (capital P) capital M (capital M)
Capital D-E-E's no doubt the chief rocker
Don't like to get ill, but if I have to I kill
So believe me boy, you got's to chill

(""Jungle boogie!"")

[Erick Sermon]
Catch every word I'm saying, no there's no delaying
Don't hesitate to motivate the crowd I'm not playing
Seeing is believing, you catch my drift?
Don't try to a-dapt because I'm just too swift
(How swift?) I'm so swift and that's an actual fact
I'm like Zorro, I mark a E on your back
I don't swing on no ropes or no iron cords
The only weapon is my rapping sword

[Parrish Smith]
Intimidate MC's with the tone of my vocal drone
When I'm pushing on the microphone
Cause I'm the funky rhyme maker, MC undertaker
The one who likes to max and relax
And when it's time, issue diggum-smack
I keep their hands clapping, fingers snapping, feet tapping
When it's time to roll Uzi patrol was packing
The PMD, the mic's my only friend
And through the course of the party, I kill again and again
So if you're thinking bout battling you better come prepared
Come with ya shield and your armor geared
You gots to chill",You Gots to Chill,1996
EPMD,"Yo, and special guests on my show
Is the K

To the S to the O-L-O

And me, the capital D, the O to C
The a.k.a., the P the M the D

And me, the E to the D to the O
To the U to the B to the L to the E

It's time P

To rip the M the I to C

So knick knack paddy wack give a dog a bone
K-Solo (yo) I pass P the microphone

Nah black (why P?) to each his own
So knick knack paddy wack give the dog a bone
Aiyyo, I pass E the microphone

It's me, yes the MC Grand Royal
Who loves rappin, and to it I stay loyal
I can't tell, you ain't caught up in my spell
You dwell on the other crab MC's that fell
Apart from the start, that didn't know the art
Of rappin, to keep the people's hands clappin
But it's me, I know the way it should be
The flow slow, like me and PMD
And that black, will make you real fat
A real swinger, and a real cool cat
Like a jazz player, or someone on the accordion
Producing crazy hits like, if I was Barry Gordy and
Here's a tip, to show you how to rip
A crab in half, and watch his posse flip
So me, the E, I come equipped
Heavy ammunition, so I don't have to dip
So listen, to this funky fresh lesson
The way I drop it, and the way that I was flexin
So knick knack paddy wack give a dog a bone
PMD (yo) I pass Solo the microphone

Yo I pass (why Solo?) to each his own
Yo knick knack paddy wack give a dog a bone
Yo, I pass P the microphone

As I take the stage, with the fresh dipped gear
I start to show off, with throw your hands in the air
Because the older I get, the harder I kick
Usin my rap-fu style from a rap-fu flick
Of my Bic oh shit another MC's lit
Like a Jack-o-Lantern, on the Halloween tip
Cause as the bass thumps, VU meters peaks
All pens and pads are drawn, as the teacher speaks
Because a naughty rapper, tried to steal the flow
But the buck stops here, cause I'mma let you know
No swingin, or knuckles, strictly ammo
Cause as I dust bust, crush, and then rush
A sucker new jack, with no if's and's or but's
You roll with the good times, we like to roll with Rush
I drive a 'Ratti (I drives a Benz) you ride the bus
So get out the mustard, crab, because it's time to catch-up
And in the act of war, P refuse to let up
On a gonna-be, wanna-be, soon-to-be, whatever's clever
In any type of weather, cause two birds of a feather
Always flock together
So knick knack paddy wack give the dog a bone
K-Solo, I pass E the microphone

I pass (why E? To each his own)
So knick knack paddy wack give a dog a bone
Aiyyo, I pass Solo the microphone

Yo, my style's aggressive, like a pit bull terrier
Harder it sounds on wax, the more the merrier
Maestro though, releases beats for me
So I can rig up a hit and get paid easily
People, gather round listen to flow
Yo, so I can prove, that I'm the true Solo
Too many suckers, have bit my name in vain
Punk rappers thought I was sleepin, but Solo came
To so many places, other rappers faces
That called theirself Solo, I made em erase it
I'm Solo, no name lender or pretender
Yo, I am the Solo the on-ly solo contender
Duck MC's, grab my name and bit it boldly
Put it behind they name and ate this up like ravioli
I heard on KISS, with Red Alert and Chuck
A rapper said he went Solo, I said, ""What the FUCK??!""
My man came over, and said, ""Yo, I thought we heard you""
Joke's on you you heard a bitin ass crew
They bit my name, I want it back, and it's a fact
Yo PMD tell em (damn you shouldn'ta did that)
Now for the record, what do I stand for
One lonely rapper on the stage, who gets one, single applause
Give me a break my brother
My name stands for Kevin Self, Organization Left Others
My name's no game for those who claim to use my name
In vain cause their name sounds plain
I remain the same, my flow of style won't change yo
The name of the game is for the real Solo to explain
I don't know was where you ran or came
I know your vein I hate your name
You're ashamed, playin the game that drove you insane
That walk around puddles, snow and the rain
With a cane, nothin to gain but shame
And my momentum of the fast flow of rhyme'll get em tamed
The pain of no fame, no title again, nobody but the real
K-S-O-L-O to blame
When I S-P-E, L-L, very W-E, L-L
People all out there can T-E-L-L
Rhymes that I got, or write will S-E-L-L
For those who don't believe me, can go to H-E-L-L
I'm from C-I, L-I, F-L-Y
Like a B-R-I-D, in the S-K-Y
Don't even T-O-Y to be dat's why
L-I-N-E's belong to M-I-N-E
I'm makin veche, some rappers imitate
Yo f*ck it, Solo here's to make parties sway
People, I won't take any kind of losses
Battlin rappers grabbin the mic and usin resources
Like household utensils, kitchen appliances (becoming silent and fading away)",Knick Knack Patty Wack,1996
EPMD,"Eh yo, whassup E Double?

Yo what's up man?

Yo these crab MC's
Got us trapped up behind these walls man
But I'm ready to break out there and do this
You know what I'm sayin?
So what's the magic word?

Open Sesame, and let down the main gate
Before you scream EPMD, you should wait
I roll with a posse, can you try to stop me
Also yo, your brothers tried to pop me
On the sneak tip, without me knowin
So I keep goin, and my rhymes keep flowin
On and on, and I don't quit
I get pushed to the limit, and yo that's it
Step by step, I put an end to your fun
Cause I'm the chosen one, yes me my son
A young kid from the ghetto, a kiddie from the city
I don't feel sorrow, and I have no pity
To run up on you, and wax plus tax
Your gold, your money, and from your eyes your contacts
Then flex over, a hop skip and a jump
To the next town, to go punk a chump
MC's try to diss me, and try to bust caps
I'm not havin it, and that means no haps Jack
So get the bozack, and lay off the crack, cause that's wack
This is the big payback

As I go and flow, to a different type of tempo
(Why MD?) C'mon E, cause P keep it simple
Plus I'm strikin like lightnin, throwin blows like Tyson
Slayin MC's on the Q-T, sorta like a sniper
So if a sucker don't like me, the feelin is mutual
I tune my rhyme to a low RPM, then shift to neutral
And crack a 40 (what kind) of Olde E
To slay an MC (how) on the Q-T
(So what's your name boy?) C'mon E, you know it's M.D
Now while I'm wreckin he's checkin, all the bodies that's left and
A pile behind the stage, the P is like steppin
Off from the scenes, I see lights and si-rens
Witness everywhere, but no one seen a thing
When cops ask questions, my description is vague
No answers at all, just bodies behind the stage
One witness yells out, that he was dressed in black
Stupid dookie link, with a Fisherman hat
A cop says yo how he fleed from the spot?
""In a black sports car, I think it was an Iroc
But the windows were tinted, and we couldn't get a look""
(Why?) There was smoke from the rubber he cooked
The big payback

No Rome-et-oh, or Juliette romance story
Just EPMD, the fame and the glory
The rappin technique, somethin like fencin
Dangerous, it keep you in suspense
And you have to be cool, and plus have stamina
Cause if you don't, I'm gonna end up stabbin ya
In your guts, from the razor cuts
And I'mma stick and pick, until your mind goes nuts
It might sound gross, or make your stomach bubble
But don't ever ever ever, mess with E Double
I'm like Jumpin Jack Flash, a Spy with an Eye
I do no stunts, and I'm not The Fall Guy
I'm just the E, the R-I-C-K, that's all
Say some check one-twos, and some yes yes y'alls
I'm the man of the hour, too sweet to be sour
(So what you sayin E?) I got ""Soul power!""
So dig it, as I kick it, keep your eyes open
Cause a brother like me, is always scopin
In fact, you should pack, because I cut no slack
It's like that, this is the big payback

If rappin was a tribe I'd be the chief commanche
Hat, fat link, chunky rings, nothing fancy
So saddle up MC's, and off we go
It's not a rodeo, but I carry a lasso
Cause I'm back from vacation, cause sucker kept slippin
Rappin off-beat, plus they tune wasn't hittin
Don't wanna claim a style on the M-I-C
But I can go state to state, cold rippin shows with E
Cause whether maxin or relaxin, waxin or taxin
Never step to a show without packin
My partners, Mr. Smith and Mr. Wesson
So nothin moves funny, at the rappin session
I'm Strictly Biz and knuckles, no time for laugh or chuckles
I drop clear lyrics, while your bass sound muffled
(You sniff blow?) Hell no, and still flow and say dough
More or less do a show, nah
The only high I get, is when my fans yell HOE
So get the bo-zack, cause we're back to hack
Here to let you know that it's the big payback",The Big Payback,1996

""Murder? Yeah murder one son, for the death of Jane"" [Repeat: x4]
Hey yo they came to my jail cell, and let me go on technicalities
The girl that got merked it wasn't Jane it was fucking Valerie
The prostitute from downtown, we checked the dental records
Found her butt naked, and on the side EPMD record
Two hours later on Greyhound, on my way now
Peeped the shorty up front, staring wants to play now
Set gets laid out, she black, draws the gat
Screaming 'lay flat' then bust a cap as she walk back
Remain cool, I want the money quality jewels
And anybody breaking these rules they get two's
This is a jack, pass the money back, no eye contact
Relax, and keep quiet and pass the bag back
to my accomplice, having no nonsense
That's when another girl pushed up, white girl on some calm shit
Thinking quick that's when the hammer went click
An off-duty P.O., licked off and touched first bitch, she fell
Hit the floor, she was leaking
My partner cock back, blast, one woman started screaming
Who's next? Who wanna flex? Cop in the seat wet
Licked another shot off, hit the driver then the bus tipped
Shit's thick, that's when she grabbed me took me hostage
Told me 'snatch the bags and don't fuck with my props kid'
Pistol still smoking, she kicked the fucking door open
Bus on it's side wheels spinning, with the engine smoking
Running on the shoulders, she put the gat in the holster
Played it cool, and never lost my composure
As screaming soldier got closer, I followed her to the
drop point, she took the leads off a Range Rover
and passed me the keys, proceeded to roll trees
Shorty gained her silence, guess what was in the CD
And as I did the knowledge the Jeep raised from the hydraulic
I'm thinking, ""Could this be Jane as my co-pilot?""
Time to activate, JANE on the license plate
Pushing ninety-five with no headlights, on the interstate
""Murder? Yeah murder one son for the death of Jane"" [Repeat: x8]",Jane 5,1997

Before I met Jane in the corridor 

The mentals, rapper slash entrepreneur

Finally, every dimension know Keith

PMD, def squad & hit squad and the virus
I'll tell you who I be (check it)

This is Erick Sermon, one of god's children of billions
With more hype than Williams
Maintain millions so when the world get close to ending
My squad prepare for squad spending, I ain't begot no weapon
I'm lyin, get caught off guard I'm firin
Until I hear sirens, I'm gone with the wind
A black Clark Gable, doin 90 in the lexus sport a fat cable
Never hold nothing back, I get the stress off my chest
Fell this so all the envious hear this
I catch wreck any punk in my way I'm banded (why E?)
Cause I'm the last man standin

""Whatever it takes how ever it gots to go down, 4 mics on stage a motherfuckin' 4 pound""

Yeah, yo snap that neck, not playing with a full deck
Make a nigga sweat below the waist line by my Johnson
Where the tools kept, who I be? The code name PMD
Casualty to an MC who try to fuck with P, or E-dub
Catch the burner with the snub, no love
A tight defence, like the glove, so bring it
Any song we drop I bet you sing it
Check the logo and slip up and get creamed kid
My pen is registered like Bruce Lee on loose leaf
My crew be, timped down puffing loosied
Drop the slick shit, nigga wanna get with
Swiss smith, street cat strap the biscuit

""Whatever it takes how ever it gots to go down, 4 mics on stage a motherfuckin' 4 pound""

Black the ripper, by barracks, cold like anemic
Believe it, it takes years for y'all to achieve it
Cause I'm a go getter, I get the loot, I get the cash
The blunt, the weed, the hash
And then get right with my friends in the Benz
Smoke fill the car until I blind my lens
I lock down my status, I be the baddest
Yes the one that get you open the most outspoken

Shogun assassin, chinese connection, ninja maskin
We turnin to gravity, b-boy with the pants saggin
Ain't no stoppin, on the case like Johnny Cochran
The beats knockin, mock speed is what I'm clockin
With Erick Serm, mess with fire you get burned
Like a bad perm it's the return that niggas yearn
What, PMD and the Bandit, never stranded
Bust a canon, cause it's the last man standin

Another shell split his elbow, a good fellow
Like jimmy chochimes, he tote two nines, two dimes
Caught the guard block and at the shoe shine
Yeah he just got word about his man james dean from queens
Hit a bank and shot a guard in the spleen
With bill blast, he made a dash smash the cash
Ran two blocks pulled off the ski mask
But then started flippin', forced in the phat whip and
People started talkin', po-po started sniffin',plus
He never hit james dean with the cream
So james put a hit to catch him on the scene
The police got a tip from a girl he use to run with
Sell guns with, trees and mack clips, yeah
She was nice, drove a 5-0 twice, on the cell all night
With more hoes than Heidi Fleiss
And the girl drove a black infinity, moving keys to kennedy
Different name everyday fake identity
They made a deal and copped a plea and turned state
So at the house the police wait with jeds caught him in his 8
50 that's how the streets be moving shiefty
Found billy and he slipped and paid quickly
Different day but the same song, life goes on
So watch the street kid, cause it's a put on

Undercover queena that pack a street sweeper
5 years for doin' fed time for extortion
And a jail up in boston for major jewel flossin'
Hits safes quickly can hear a black jamie summers
Pick the right numbers and have mad runners
Or hardcore lil' kim, queen bee bitch
Who never snitch, played the game and never rode the bench
Will swear up and down this bitch will kill at will
For her family, no fantasy, a james colamity
Time for the score, from hammerton to marine park
Gotta get there, before it get dark, we arrive
She reload the black 45, concealed by the waist line
And nows the time, she jumped out the car
In front was a hummer, two new comers, I never seen before
I approached tall joey ""who's those guys lookin' wise?
Had my black ass surprised.""
A-yo yo yo it's a set up, where's the doe, uh
Where's the loot, give it to me and don't get cute
Catrina pulled the weapon, shot joey
The other two guys pulled out and aimed, explain
Yo, she hid the two kids with joey, she didn't know
Cause she paid more doe for 'em
Will screamed ""you bitch!"" ""sorry"" she said
Then boow! will got lit

It's two o'clock, you gettin knocked out the box

Bust the crime scene, cause some drama, niggas ducking

Off the Richter scale, blowing hotter than ever
With the squadron, beg your pardon, got the heads nodding
Lost your mind and said, ""shit!!"" when we barged in

Serving you customers and those fake hustlers
Whats up? step to me, I smack you silly
I'm the kid, but no comparison to billy
I ain't scared of you motherfuckers, can't you tell?
Girls lose to me when they groove to Maxwell, 
I got one life to live so I'm living
Got girls to be hitting more cars to be driving

[Parrish Smith]
We stripped too many beats to make too many niggas to break
No moves are fake, no warning shots fired blasting on crews like corrupt jakes
The black viper, scream on MC's and rhyme ciphers
More dangerous mind than, Michelle Pfeiffer
So skedaddle-daddle, you get rattled don't wanna battle-battle
Put one to your rhyme saddle, stompin through, like wild cattle

Yo nuttin man just coolin kick back in the studio wit DJ Scratch
And my man Frank B, reminiscin about how we was tryin to shop
Our demo and everybody was dishin, you know what I'm sayin?

Yo P tell em whassup man

We was coolin in my car one day you see
Clockin a double nickel on the L-I E
When it dawned on us that it was, ten o'clock
Turned on the tunes to hear the DJ rock
The hands got to clappin, the fingers start to snappin
E and I was coolin, Brooklyn spirits we was snappin
In and out of fantasies on how large we can get
Corner rocks and Benzes with the ground effect kits
I wanted black, E was on the two-tone
Stupid boomin system with the hand-free phone
The dream gets better and I would like to go on
But I was brought back to reality by a toot of a horn
Smoke everywhere, oh just what we needed
On the way to shop my demo, and the car overheated
Feelin real low, low enough to die
Holdin up traffic, on the FDR drive
We had to play ourselves, in the fresh dipped gear
E Double had to push while MD steered
There went our dreams, to cool with golden limos
And all we kept sayin was please listen to my demo (listen to my demo)

Please listen to my demo
Please listen to my demo
Please listen to my demo
Please-please-please-ple-please listen to my demo

In the year eighty-seven when we first took off
When I jumped on P-6-8 and broke North
Walked the big city streets of Manhattan
Buildings, the whole nine yards, so enchantin
Thinkin if we got a chance, we could rock it
Funky fresh demo tape in my pocket
We was walkin, and got dissed twice today
Then we stopped at 1974 Broadway
We walked in with grins on our chins
And P had juice with Mr. Virgil Simms
He played the tape and we started to laugh
Played (?)
People start to smile inside we buckwhylin
Sayin this all started back from freestylin
They liked it, and they was very kind
But me and P was like, ""Yo G, where do we sign?""
Went in the backroom, things was luvy duvy
Met Ron Resnick, and his partner Juggy
Things was cool, as I remembered
We signed the dotted line, now we Fresh Record members
Had dreams, of fancy cars and limos
And all I wanted was somebody, to listen to my demo

He had help, sucker duck, now that's clue number three 

You wrong, cause it was EPMD 



[PMD] 

MC's, get off the bandwagon 

I'm not bragging, but tagging 

And snagging the biter that tries to imitate 

Time to go on strike and demonstrate 

On the fo, that does not N-O 

That if he pulls my card, I'm good to flow 

Toe to toe, blow to blow, without H2O 

Ayo, you want to battle? I'm good to G-O 



Get off the bandwagon (Repeat 2x) 



[Erick Sermon] 

This ain't a blast from the past, it's a boomer from the future 

Feel free to scream ""Ho"" or ""Yo"" if it suits you 

While the bass is booming and your face is glooming 

Saying the E double E is def, you're not assuming 

They're only one of many that think a jealous fellow 

Say ""yep"" then step cause I'm cooler 



[PMD] 

Say ""Hmmm"" now you're through, you're how not who 

Before I'm gluing that butt like Krazy Glue 

I roll into the party as if I was Five-O 

Book investigation biters like Columbo 

Pushing rap for some info in exchange for a jumbo 

And when I find a sucker it's time to play Rambo 

Or play Commando, you know? 

I knew it was the sucker with the New Jack-ified afro 

We rock rhymes then we we run em a while 

Sucker MC's catch on, then they bite our style 

They're confused, dazed, and amused 

Sweating and thing because their rhymes are used 

Seen us in the crowd then they own their cost 

They run around like a chicken with their heads cut off 



Get off the bandwagon (Repeat 2x) 



[Erick Sermon] 

While my volume was swaying, you were saying 

""Who was that brother?"" while the record was playing 

I felt kinda happy like an ego trip 

I had to laugh cause my energy's tip 

My tradition is dissing in this position 

And right about now I'm in perfect condition 

And don't get mad, and don't stop hissing 

Don't say nothing homeboy just listen 



[PMD] 

No talk or playing, sucker MC's I be slaying 

Get off the bandwagon, you know what I'm saying? 

I devastate the hip-hop scene 

Keep the feet moving like a dancing machine 

E got my back (yeah) K La Boss on the scratch 

You wild on the groove with the beat on wax 

I'm in my own world, no room for distraction 

Controlling MC's while La Boss keeps scratching

Consecutively, five golds so technically
You niggaz got a long way to go to catch the PMD

Make a mothafucker catch a cardiac arrest
Live out the Fresh Fest, one of the best
I asked my nigga Red Alert, he said ""YEESSSSS""

I intimidate MC's from the throwing of my vocal tone
It don't work, I show em the chrome and flash the greens
Coincide wit the red beam, and hear about it all day on Street Scene

I Welcome niggaz like Kotter to the night marauder
Pull out my gat, you'll be like ""AAAGH!!"" like Godfather

This here ain't the average shit, you used to
Front, and automatic rounds, will shoot you
So knock it off, like Biggie Smalls said Duke you soft
Why you want to fuck with the boss?

Where should I start? Breakin MC's or shattering charts?
It's Diablo, PMD Mic Doc with the purple heart

Uhh, yo, and yo
EPMD, fucking with us is bad news
Me and you got different views
What you might say is dope, I say's not
What I might call wack, you'll call hot
The best thing for you, is to think and hope
Or get choked, and hung with The Velvet Rope
Cause you too theatrical, mess around
And end up smacking you, jacking you, attacking you

That's why it's crucial, so stay neutral to collect the cash
Double beaucoup, just ripping up mics, is what my crew do
Whatever suits you, pull out the burner, fuck the shoot through
Roadblocks and smear campaigns, with the two-two
Or tech nine, that'll chew, through your waistline
I'm accurate, don't waste mine, spit on baseline
Run with the unseen potential to be on Dateline
I don't fake mine, you blaze crazy, while I pace mine

[Erick Sermon]
Yeah, now why y'all want to mess with the vets?
We've been doing this shit, since Dear Yvette, check
I make shit that make you want to smack your producer
And ice grill him, and make you want to kill him dead
And walk around leaking, in the bed for the weekend
For playing with the last Mahican
Madi gon, that's fuck you in Puerto Rican
Keep quiet when you hear grown men speaking

[Parrish Smith]
Or get smacked, this ain't no game, the shit is serious
Delirious, that's how we leave cats and niggaz curious
The true legend, got caught shit you better call Kevin

Quick with mine, smoking up heaters, when I'm crushing
Nice with the weapontry, you ain't shooting me
You shot the deputy what you hearing when you step with the
Black dragon, puffin L's in the truck wagon
Drinking moonshine, writing rhymes with the pants sagging
And hit the saloon, causing the guns in my holster to make room
Like Josie wale and Clint Eastwood at high noon
So amigo, take ten paces, move your feet slow
Turn around and wave goodbye, to your people
Time to draw, I'm aiming for your dome and jaw
Fastest nigga in the wild west or east you ever saw
An outlaw, my horse drinking water from the reservoir
Time to ride again until next time to draw

I was hanging out late, creeping a quarter to two
Polly with cats, sipping on a 40 of brew
Pulled out the Dutch Master
Cause it's time to get on
Turned on the truck system to pump a hip-hop song
Five minutes later I see these other kids clocking
Meanwhile my niggas chalmed out with system rocking
Saying in my mind, who could it be?
As he got closer, I peeped, it was the E-Double E
I said, ""What up Duke?""

Yo, whats up Sundullah?
I have a girl and she wants me to duke her
Yo, why didn't you?

Run-D.M.C. style, stop and show love

I stay in the cut with O.J.
The fact is, some things got to change
with eight or more rappers that sound the same
With the, same game, like they all in the same gang
and claim the same fame
Suicide victims, quick to jump off and scream I
have to die, I'm living a lie
Fake MC's no heart, get torn apart
Messing with us? In ninety-nine, get smart
I be the last one you wanna play with
Rap committees call me, just to okay shit
Focus on me, I grab the mic and drop gems
on a ill rhyme, more flashier than rims
Step in in tan Timb's, a pocket full of ends with a
couple of friends and a couple of hens
Never boring, keep shit rocking til morning
with the bird, until the hawks start hawking
Bounce with me, me and my man keep things hitting
Hop in the Benz 2000 Benz with the CD skipping

Then got in the magazine and tried to sound all sweet

So I called up Erick Sermon and said, ""This shit's absurd!""
Now we flip the bird, back-breaking MC's down like herbs
Redlining, bending my chrome rims up on curbs
So can you make a bill and chill and survive in the rap field?
Flip deals, and cock back burners when the caps peel?
I don't think so, then come next the car repo
No mo' contract, just strictly handyman in Home Depot
So don't front for me or the E, cause you know our steez
EPMD, blazing shit, Def 2G's
Cause we make tape and break MC's who wannabees

In the moonshining, I'm sipping starsky and hutch
While my rims blinding, while p rolling the dutch
Cause I'm too much for ma's and grandpa's to solve
Roll the windows to your cars, when out at large
Who the fuck's in charge? Charles Laston sauls
I got his mom sucking my balls like a fresh pack of halls
Right hand to Allah, I'm the roughest of the raw
Nobody's ever seen what they seen and never saw
When I jump in my car, they go ooh and ahh
EPMD, 215, and 8-off agallah

[8-off]
Yo 215, who the fuck was them cats up in the car?
One of them got a gat, the other one wanna spar
Jumping out the car, pop a trunk, swinging crowbars
Stick up my seeds in my fiends for the G's
People low self-esteem rocking the gleam, hotter than steam
When I blow off the top I got this cream like bill rothstein
And when I rob unique excitement is, why you scream
So put your hands together, get your mans together
Here's the plan together here's the gun together let's run together
Soldier mind crime nigga, bitch-down live nigga
8-off's gonna hit em like, five niggas, surprise niggas

[Erick Sermon]
Hey yo you hit em like that
I bust em from the back, to the extreme
Hit em up, make em scream like a bitch
And switch up, for the mix up, and dig a ditch up
And bounce, then for luck, I throw a six up
And hook off like prince naseem a head
Duck yo' head, or go inside instead
Step to me bourgeois? fancy as dandy?
You get killed, like you was jon-benet ramsey
And some of y'all just plain civilians
Talking shit, and never even seen a million
Acting like y'all Sicilians, when y'all niggas
With small figures, and chasing gold diggers
(motherfuckers) don't even come up to me yapping
Or you'll die hard with Bruce and Sam Jackson
Right now, you wanna duel, you fool
I'm a dog 4 life like my nigga ja rule
Who wanna flex, with the influential
With mad credentials on instrumentals we're too essential
The mic and the beat, now shit's complete
For me to kick your ass, for talkin trash, punk

""you got shot cause you knock knock knocked
Who's there? another motherfucking hardrock""

""whoa-ho-hoh, let me like slow up with the flow""

""introducing, yo fuck that nigga's name!""

""if you wanna step to my motherfucking rep

Knick knack patty whack give a dog a bone
Yo, don't give him nothing but a microphone
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
You said I'm not the E, you wanna make a bet?
Remember this: Lounge, you in the danger zone
I figured you would, now leave me alone
You pick and you wish on a four-leaf clover
To be the E double E over and over
You're intrigued by the way I do my thing
(Do what?) Pick up the mic high and make it swing

[PMD]
I have the capability to rap and chill
Cold wax and tax MC's who tend to act ill
It's like a Diggum Smack
Smack me and I'll smack you back
I get goosebumps when the baseline thumps
A sucker MC arrives, now it's time for lunch
When I'm cooling on the scene, I notice one thing
I'm not Bounce, so sucker MC's cling
I consider myself better than average
Yo, I rock the mic like a wild beast savage

[Erick Sermon]
I'm in the bottling state, I can't concentrate
I make a move like chess, and then I yell ""checkmate""
You know why I get zanier and zanier?
Because of EPMD mania
When I walk through the crowd I can see heads turning
I hear voices saying ""That's Erick Sermon""
Not only from the women, but from the men
You know what? It feels good, my friend

[PMD]
I'm the P double E, the Thrilla of Manilla
Better known as the MC cold killer
PMD cold keeps the place jumping
And if not then we feel like we owe you something
Like lotto, you have to be in it to win it
But if the beat is fresh then Diamond J will spin it
If J spin it, then it has to be fresh
To make you dance until there's no one left

Cause you a customer

[Erick Sermon]
Praying like a prey when the fox in action
I smell blood, no time for maxing
Camouflage in the green, my back is arc
Plus you in trouble cause it's after dark
My eyes close like Steve Austin, I got you in the square
I won't let you run, nah, that ain't fair
So I clear my visions until I can spot him
Snatch him by the neck and say ""Hmmm I got him""

[PMD]
Whenever MC's, you're in over your head
My rhymes are hungry plus they haven't been fed
The process of elimination is quite simple
Let you grow like a blackhead and pop you like a pimple
Slice you like lettuce, toss you like a salad
Revoke your MC license if your rhymes ain't valid
As we go on, sucker MC's sound wacker
Like a parrot says ""Polly want a cracker""

[Erick Sermon]
It was a record test, nothing we can't handle
At the house they had the mics on the mantle
Looked at the DJ and said ""May I?""
Lit it up like the Fourth of July
Because I float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Whoa, I'm the E of EPMD
I have a strong point of view on the way things run
Just shut up and listen and learn my son

[PMD]
Absorb that ass like Bounty, the quicker picker upper
To tell you up front, you're nothing but a sucker
The style we're using, no doubt copastetic
You try to bite and yet sound pathetic
Design my rhymes like a taylor, floatin' like a sailor
As the P gets stronger, MC's get staler
Not bragging or protagging, surely not fagging
MC's surrender, raise the flags and
Give up the titles because the signs are vital
I keep a voice tuned at a slow and swift idle

You a customer

[Erick Sermon]
I need a man meal sandwich, yes I need Manwich
I feel good, now it's time to do damage
I feel like balanced, you know what I mean?
Wanna rhyme one time, to release the steam
When I grab the mic I get dramatic like an actor
You know why I get over? I'm the master
I do a show, pack it in til it's clamming up
Look for the microphone then jam it up

[PMD]
You said you see me jamming in New York Tech
You got one right fella, you deserve a check
How did you know, you must have been jocking
How do you know the places I be rocking?
Don't follow me fella, every move that I make
I'm hostile now so I'll give you a break
Well search upon me but don't go past the limit
Here's a card and on the back is my fan club digits

[Erick Sermon]
There's two things to check out in the words that I'm saying
Plus listen to the good time playing
Bro is bad, the strings he's plucking
Fire rhyme after rhyme, watch MC's duck and

[PMD]
MC's, the final countdown
You look tired, can you go the round?
If you can, I'll slap your hand and give you credit
And if not, I'll turn around and say ""Forget it""

Uh huh yeah 

Yeah it's like this why'all it's like that why'all 
It's like this why'all it's like that why'all 
It's like this why'all it's like that why'all 
Ay E Dub check it out 

MC's out there, you better stand clear 
EPMD is a world premier 
From New York straight talk, America's best 
Cold wild Long Island, is where we rest 

Style of the rap, makes your hands clap 
Take care of myself because the lines are strapped 
Day mean business, no time for play 
If you bite a line, we'll roll your way 
The more you bite, your body gets hot 
Don't get too close, because you might get shot 
Gnawin at my rhyme like a poisonous rat 
Don't play Dumbo, you're smarter than that 

It's my thing 

The rhythmatic style, keeps the rhyme flowin 
Good friends already bitin, without you knowin 
Can't understand, why your body's gettin weaker 
Then you realize, it's the voice from the speaker 
The mind become delirious, situation serious 
Don't get ill, go and get curious 

Nuff about that, let's get on to somethin better 
And if gets warm, take off the hot sweater 
And if you want some water, I'll get you a cup 
And if you don't want it, then burn the hell up 
I'm tellin you now boy, you ain't jack 
Talkin much junk like Mr. T at your back 
but he's not, so don't act cute 
Cause if you do you in hot pursuits 

It's my thing 

As the song goes on you will notice a change 
The way I throw down, the way I say my name 
The mic that I'm packin, is flame resistant 
So MC be cool, and keep your distance 
When I walk into the party girls are screamin at me 
I park my mic and my hoes, and then I yell FREEZE.. 
Music please 


Ah where was I? Oh yes 
Say a def rhyme then I plumb the rest 
Everytime I rock a rhyme I can tell that you like it 
Emotion is strong, like the mind of a psychic 
The mind is weary, floatin like a dove 
Sweating and things, like cause you was makin love 
Control the crowd, so they can accept it 
Total concentration is the perfect method 

It's my thing 

The wack I subtract, the strong I attack 
The ones who grab the mic and freeze, I throw it back 
I perfect and eject, make MC's sweat 
Take em off on the mic then I tell em step 
Not waiting or debating, cause MC's keep hating 
Play me too close, like two dogs mating 

Now let's get on with the rest of the lesson 
Don't really like it when suckers start messin 
Tryin to make a scene, talkin very loud 
Talkin much junk to attract a crowd 
You say you want to battle, your first mistake 
You get quiet and stuff, like you was at a wake 
In the beginnin, you knew you wasn't winnin 
Now you feel ashamed, your head starts bendin 
Kinda upset boy -- I understand 
You lost again -- I won, god damn 

It's my thing 

My funky fresh lyrics, put you in the spirit 
I speak a little louder for you suckers can't hear it 
The rhymes I designed, are right on time 
and at the crowd on my mic, flash a danger sign 
Cause I'm the Thriller of Manilla, MC cold killer 
Drink Budweiser, cannot stand Miller 
MC's cold clockin til the party's through 
then they tap me on my shoulder and say, ""This Bud's for you"" 

To be a real MC, you can't be obedient 
To be smooth is the main ingredient 
You have to be silky like a Milky Way 
To be able to make it work, you rest and play 
I control the pace of the rate the rhymes blowin 
Hydraulically jacked, is the way they're flowin 
Slow yes, just like they're awed 
The comparison is wave like the motion of water, smooth.. 

While the record is spinnin, got your fly girlie grinnin 
MD is on the mic, you know I'm only beginnin 
Rhymes fresher than fresh, never heard me fess 
Scored 110, on my MC test 
My rhymes are strong than Tyson, hold a MC license 
When I grab the mic, MC's get frightened 

I'm dangerous, I'm here to crush some bones 
Lounge homeboy you in the danger zone 
What I mean by lounge, I don't mean bitin, huh 
You mess around, and we'll be fightin 
It's alright if you bite, but don't recite 
because the rhymes are mine, and that ain't right 
But until just chill to the next episode

(Tell 'em 'bout it)
We got ta let the girls know what they gotta do for us

Oh, what the heck, let's get married and have a son named Erick
No big deal, no sweat, I was in for a big surprise
And when I saw the judge hammer pass my green eyes
Brain locked my whole damn head was malfunctional
'Cuz I forgot to co sign a prenuptial agreement
Now her case is hard like cement
I have no files on all the money she spent
She has a car, nineteen ninety brand new Jaguar

Fly kit, with chrome rims that's five star
That she bought when I was away on tour
Hittin' my bank account, gettin' more and more money
She got paid, it wasn't funny
Talkin' to myself, oh, you big big dummy
Just my luck that I'm stuck with a marriage
And a baby who lays in a gold carriage
Now I can't leave, if I do she gets half
(Not the cash)
Oh yes, the whole damn bash of money

So I chill and act so sweet
Kiss her feet, can't picture bein' in the street
So I give a fake smile and a fake laugh
Fake everything so I can keep all my cash
Fake talk, like I love you so much
But wishin', she gets hit by a Mack truck
Next time, if there's one I'll know
That most women strictly out for the dough
They're called gold diggers

'Coz she's a gold digger
'Coz she's a gold digger
'Coz she's a gold digger

The P had a close call, quiet as kept I dated this
(""Fly girl"")
Yeah, and almost got vicked
She had green eyes, thunder thighs, and a def body
(So what cha sayin')
Top it off, she drove a black Maserati
Chrome kit, with a smile I couldn't resist
I tapped E on the shoulder and said, ""Yeah, I gots to get this""
(P cool, she could be a gold digger)

Not with that smile and that stupid boomin' figure
'Til one day, she spent the crazy dough
Ten G's on Levi's, cold went Rambo
But then she smiled, gave me a back massage
Gassed my head up and said
(Oh, P you're so large)
Like a jerk, I went for the line like a fish
But she was far from dream girl, and more like a death wish
She likes to sit back, lamp, walk on plush rugs

Whip my five-sixty sip Moet and bug
(So did you flip?)
Tried to but she cut me off
And said, ""Guess what?""
(What)
""I'm pregnant""
(Pregnant? Damn)
Yeah, and the child is yours
So to fellas, who wanna keep they cash
Or beware of the jack hammer and the helmet that glows

She's a gold digger

That's why, men in the 90's must watch themselves

And got stuck with alimony payments
Time to meet Judge Wapner

You get a flashback to wedding, when you vowed the vow
Said the two deadly words
I do
But look now, you lost the house
The car

Eatin' TV dinners in a one bedroom apartment
Boy you picked a winner
But what goes around, comes around
That's why she wheels the Benz
And you ride Greyhound
Oh, just your luck, they on strike
Take off the wedding band, put out the thumb, time to hitch-hike
And the more you walk the pain from your corns get bigger

That's why we in, we hustelin', strong arm muscelin'
bustin' like we lookin' for weapons of mass destruction in
hoodies on, dressed in black
Fatigue camouflage, and power like we just came from Iraq
We learned not to look back, we turn the stone in crack
Its the return of the boom bap
Yeah HipHop is back, peep the track
It's P and the green eye, some Long Island guys
are you all surprised?

[Chorus]

Ayo, even though I never hear DJ sayin' it
Yeah EPMD is washed up and we ain't playin' it
Yeah, like I care, you ain't stoppin' nothing over here
I got four seats up in the Lear Jets
Bet I'm ok, you hate your
No payments, all ass payed for
Not the one to brag, but for you I dodged

Come with the broken language like Smoothe da Hustler and Trigga
My bombs are bigger, cant touch a harmless figure
Cause is stay razor sharp like my name was RZA
PMD built a dynasty like Jigga


Yeah, P my nigga, time to cock back pull the trigger
he a bigger nigga with figures but I'm a bigger nigga
Duh, I'm a snub nose, I'm way above those
I got beef and I sit 'til the club closed
lights come on, I'm bombin

Cream getter, gleam better
You know what? the team is clever
Fuck niggas up get drunk pull out a bigger pump
Sell crack, all day rep, rock the meanest leather
Flip you all day chump, mad make you pay
No doubt, gun in his mouth, he leanin on Broadway
HipHop gangsters for real, check the archives
Four Fives, knives, catch you in the sunrise
Powerful impact, boom, from the canon
This is not slain to take mine, take this ammo with it
Big boys, pretty boys, shottin' pretty toys

I show my true {Colors} when I'm in the streets

Approach with caution when you see me on the street

Your head neck and arm be on the concrete
I'm on some Murdoch, I'm comin' for you, so don't sleep

And dot the I's and check the period at the end of the sentence
Discipline, meditation, repentance, gave us clearance
in the re-entrance like a futuristic extension

Does my thing from father spring, that's all year

He screamed and I'ma just saying he did

Something has to be said
Uh
Somebody tell me something
Whats up?

That it's on right now and we about to let off
And that the industry is sleepin' and Hip Hop is soft
EPMD is the boss like Rick Ross
We don't knock or ring or else we kick down the door with force
Bust you down, leave a sign on you that say you lost
Game over, no more quarters, plus the machine is broke
Money don't really remember nothing, all he has seen is smoke
No witness, no statement, no case
Incorporate you eat cheese, then you get a raise
Rubbed out return to the earth
Six feet deep in the dirt
With the snakes and maggots cause you got murked

Yeah, and they keep telling me that
You're only as good as your last record
And if I was to do something now they wouldn't second
Hardcore respect it and that is enough
You got more props then call your bluff
Same thing happened to Marry and Mariah
They both came back with fire, fuck retiring
I got belts around my waist
You keep holding your pants up
Homeboy male up!
That's your opinion, cause you're not feeling it
How you know they're hot the fans not hearing it
The record pins steering it in one direction
You, there is some music in the real niggas section

That EPMD is a corporation it's not its the group
And that they always stack paper so put up your loot
Ghetto celebs that's why niggaz salute
Orange juice and grey goose
We dramatic backwards now that P is loose
Me and E is back for the kill, no troops
That's why we spit the real in the vocal booth

Yeah so called gangster and you ain't even hard
So called boxer and you ain't even sport
When them ribber hit you got punked in the yard
You said you got shot and you ain't even scarred
But they believe this and you keep betraying them
You are a bitch and I'm not the only one saying it

Now he from the BX but he really soft
And he from BK but his guns don't go off
He from cop killer Queens but he still getting robbed
And he from money making but he ain't on his job
Now he from LA but he's scared to bang
And he from Texas but he will do the damn thing
He'd stay in VA but he is scared of the streets
And he's from Chi-a but he's sweet as a peach
I can tell you 'bout the dope fiends and all of that

But I let them tell it 'cause they sell their moms crack
And that ain't gangsta that is wanksta
Went to jail and the homo shanked ya
Don't get caught between my city and the moon
You'll be screaming at night, you loose your life at me to doom
I really hung with BIG, squared off with Pac
Shook hands in the House of Blues before the shit popped

Es geschieht etwas, was mit dem Intellekt nicht zu erfassen ist
In diesem Moment weicht der Verstand dem Verständnis
Due verstehst, das das Wesen, das die gegenüber steht einfach da ist
Und das dieses Dasein Rechtfertigung genug ist um sein zu dürfen",Koyaaniskatsi,2016
Equilibrium,"Straight across beclouded land
We're walking slowly at command
Feeling drained and without shield
To destination battlefield

We're getting near
Conseal your fear
Wipe off your sweat
There's no regret

You're erasing the light
No reason to fight
Remaining in state darkness
We insist on free will
No reason to kill
Decay of your own carcass

They are prey
Don't look away
Deep inside
You know that you are not right

Eye to eye, who's falling down?
Face to face, who gets that crown?
My doings are my legacy
Affecting all eternally

My intentness decays to sand
So I halt and raise my hand
I throw my blade out of range
This will be my day of change",Prey,2016
Equilibrium,"Waiting in the gray of dawn
Until the morning fog is gone
The leaves are full of nightly tears
Noises are on the way to my eras

Awoken from the sleep of death
I'm taking a deep intense breath
The bracing fragrance takes me back to life

Let's get forward, no time to rest
It doesn't really matter if east or west
So many roads are unexplored
The journey is its own reward

I feel it inside
My eyes are open wide
My heart will acclaim
The sun will rise again

Equilibrium,"Es wird nicht möglich sein, die Kriegerischen Instinkte einer einzigen Generation auszurotten
Die Menschen müssen weiterhin kämpfen, aber nur wofür zu kämpfen lohnt
Und das sind nicht imaginäre Grenzen, Rassen vorurteile oder Bereicherungsgelüste
Die sich die Fahne des Patriotismus umhängen

Nicht zu viel Gepäck, ganz ohne Last
So geht es raus aus diesem verkeimten Knast

In Windeseile fliegen wir zum Horizont
Die Landschaft rast an uns vorbei
Das Abenteuer ruft für den der mit uns kommt
Wir singen laut und mit Geschrei!

Das Gestern liegt nun weit entfernt
Seitdem hab ich schon viel gelernt
Und eines ist mir jetzt ganz klar
Das Gefühl von Freiheit ist unbezahlbar!

I will look in the sky

Where we'll be tomorrow 

I will read all the books
Of many continents
To tell you all about
The legends of the past 

I will wait for the sun
On top of the world
To tell you all about
The beauty of the light

If you look inside your soul
The world'll open to your eyes
You'll see...

I will stand in the rain
Hoping sun will come through
Then I'll see it belongs to a misty rainbow
I'll stay up in the night

You're too smart for all that drama
Can't fix my heart with all your commas
You drive so fast don't care about my momma

She calls out, and she says 

My life is falling down like rain 
And I'll be the one to drown 
My whole world is nothing but pain 
And I'll be the one to drown

Never thinking what she could have been

Give her the pain she feels inside

Fale pelos cotovelos, e pelos joelhos
Me critique sem razão
Se omitir não vale à pena

Não venha dividir comigo sua auto-censura
Me desencontre, não me prostitua
Se não seremos mais uma carcaça em desgraça por aí

Dando linha a uma vida extremamente chata

Era amigo e confidente das manhãs sem sol
Prisioneiro de mim mesmo, sem poder fugir
De repente o infinito de uma coisa boa
Começou devagarinho a orbitar em mim
Como num conto de fadas dos irmãos Grimm
Era um universo puro de uma pessoa
Que me viu um mundo morto portador de vida
Como um beija-flor perdido no próprio jardim

Era um momento claro de fazer saudade
Um encontro do destino com a felicidade
Formidáveis primaveras de estações sem dor
Parecia uma chance pra nascer de novo
Uma plenitude mansa que acendeu a chama
De incontáveis alegrias vindas do amor
Foi assim que eu mergulhei no mar daquele afeto
Esquecendo a fé sem rosto do meu peito inquieto
Vendo os seios sobre a mesa que jorravam mel
E ouvindo interjeições de sentimentos puros
Investi na sensações de emoções sem juros
E ganhei um universo pra chamar de céu
Oh oh

Let's face the music - I think that it's time.
What's the use, when the future looks so unkind.
Life and death - the choice we make.
Revolution - the line in my mind takes.

Win or lose, hey! what do you say.
Got to change, change, change, change.
Check it out and see - there could be a better lifestyle.
My hopes are big as the sky,
My dreams are wider than wide.
One day we'll be absolutely crueltyfree!

Rage!
March on! unleash the spirit,
Rise above all fear, into the light.
It's a world affair - don't waste a minute,
Let the heart decide, it's time to care.

What is this sad fascination,
To rip off another's skin.
Shame! shame! shame!
Fancy people in furcoat - what a pitiful sight.
Leather is dead - it's not so nice.

Rage!
March on! unleash the spirit,
Rise above all fear, into the light.
It's a world affair - don't waste a minute,
Let the heart decide, it's time to care.

Stop! think! before you chew.
Don't eat a creature, that won't eat you.
Food for everyone,
Let's all eat - it's so much fun.
Let that chicken be! a cow is not a factory!
Fast food slaughter - a criminal waste.
We've got to tune ourselves into a new morality.
Make some improvement on the human race.

Rage, each time I turn around.
Rage, it tears my heart apart.
Rage, each time I see the blood.
Hey, now! sentimental feelings are just not good enough.

March on! unleash the spirit,
Rise above all fear, it's time to care.
March on! unleash the spirit,
Rise above all fear, into the light.
It's a world affair - don't waste a minute,
Let the heart decide, it's time to care.
March on! unleash the spirit,
Rise above all fear, it's time to care.

Erasure,"Climbing up on Solsbury Hill
I could see the city light
Wind was blowing, time stood still
Eagle flew out of the night

He was something to observe
Came in close, I heard a voice
Standing stretching every nerve
I had to listen had no choice

I did not believe the information
Just had to trust imagination
My heart was going boom boom, boom
""Son,"" he said, ""Grab your things, I've come to take you home.""

To keeping silence I resigned
My friends would think I was a nut
Turning water into wine
Open doors would soon be shut

So I went from day to day
Tho' my life was in a rut
'Till I thought of what I'd say
Which connection I should cut

I was feeling part of the scenery
I walked right out of the machinery
My heart was going boom boom boom
""Hey,"" he said, ""grab your things, I've come to take you home.""
Yeah back home

When illusion spin her net
I'm never where I want to be
And liberty she pirouette
When I think that I am free

Watched by empty silhouettes
Who close their eyes, but still can see
No one taught them etiquette
I will show another me

Today I don't need a replacement
I'll tell them what the smile on my face meant
My heart was going boom boom boom
""Hey,"" I said, ""You can keep my things, they've come to take me home.""

And left us to a sheer attack
And I'm not really pleased with that
And still it's not over
The universe is big enough
And there's room for the two of us
And ignorance it isn't bliss
And words they can't hurt me

Erasure,"I was feeling down had lost my lust for life
'Til I caught a glimpse of you that night
Never knew how much things were about to change
Saw you in the corner of my mind

You show me there's more to life
There's gotta be more to life
Gotta count our blessings from the universe

Baby you're the best thing
Baby you're a blessing
Baby you're the greatest thing

How did you rekindle my breathless flame
Memories that cut me like a knife
Time will heal the wounds they say you know it's true
You gave me room to build my faith in you

There's gotta be more than this
There's gotta be more than that
It's been a long time coming

Erasure,"Take me out of myself
'Til I feel like I've got everything under control
And it's a feeling I like
When you fall at my, when suddenly that you don't know

I will not fear where I'm heading
'Cause I see that the writing's upon the wall
And I don't feel like a saviour
Who can save me from myself tonight?

Don't talk to me as if I'm crazy
It's not the way it's meant to be
Please talk to me as if I'm equal
Fear of rejection's hanging on

Put me back into the synchronization of reality
Oh how it shows
I will not walk away of my own accord baby
It's down to you

I might appear like a maniac
But it's just because I never switch off
You make me feel like infinity
Like I could do almost anything

It's not the way it's meant to be
Please just talk to me as if I'm equal
Fear of rejection's hanging on

Repeating old mistakes
When will we learn
How to cry to forgive

Erasure,"Before we ever seize the day
The calming of the season's end
Life becomes a hidden play
Imparted with a furtive glance
Was it everything you'd dreamed it'd be
Or illusions shattered into glass

World be gone
Or are you filled with loving
The way that you promised us
Long ago
And will it tie us to the mast of our souls
As in ancient lore
And as I saw you standing there
Holding your head in your hands

Though it hurts to say goodbye
Silver linings in the leaden sky
One day we'll return again
And surely we will make amends
Consequences never seen
Broken shadows on an empty screen

World be gone
Or are you filled with loving
The way that you promised us
Long ago
And will it tie us to the mast of our souls

Erben Der Schöpfung,"Elis, wenn die Amsel im schwarzen Wald ruft
Dieses ist dein Untergang
Deinen Lippen trinken die kühle des blauen Felsenquells

Lass, wenn deine Stirne leise blutet
Uralte Legenden
Und dunkle Deutung des Vogelflugs

Du aber gehst mit weichen Schritten durch die Nacht
Die voll purpurner Trauben hängt
Und du regst die Arme schöner im Blau

Ein Dornbusch tönt
Wo deine modernden Augen sind
O, wie lange bist, Elis, du verstorben

Auf deine Schläfen tropft schwarzer Tau
Das letzte Gold verfallner Sterne

Dein Leib ist eine Hyazinthe
In die ein Mönch seine Finger taucht
Eine schwarze Höhle ist unser Schweigen

Daraus bisweilen
Ein sanftes Tier tritt
Und langsam die schweren Lider senkt

Auf deine Schläfen tropft schwarzer Tau
Das letzte Gold verfallner Sterne
Auf deine Schläfen tropft schwarzer Tau
Das letzte Gold verfallner Sterne

",Elis,2003
Erben Der Schöpfung,"For years I searched a star
Which guides me through the universe
I started to believe
That I had to go my way all alone

Then one day, I found my star
It made speechless as you saw

Each night I looked at my star
But I didn't dare to talk with him

Then one day, I tried to touch him
But I had to see my star, it was too far

My star is out of reach
No chance to be close to him
Although I know, I'll never find another
No chance to live with him

My star is out of reach
No chance to be close to him
Although I know, I'll never find another
No chance to live with him

On and on I try to reach him
But I have to see
My star is too far

Erdal Kizilcay,"And when she drowns
Within and in the fizzy gin, begins to sigh
""Good God, oh my"", I cry
And die, and lie beside

She is the apple in my eye
She talked to God
I couldn't cope or'd hope eloped
A dope she roped this salty lie

And when she's dreaming, I believe
And when she's reading, I retreat
Can't believe her telling me she's dead again
Telling me she's dead against it

And deep my wound
Within for every second chance it was thy tore
From deep within despite the rain
My words are worn

She loves to talk into the phone
No matter who, no matter when
No matter where
No better than the faulty line

And when she's dreaming, I believe
And when she's reading, I retreat
Can't believe her telling me she's dead again
Telling me she's dead against it

On the redeeming spiritual qualities of sex, of sex
Christianity has been pretty modern about sex

Of sex, of sex, of sex, of sex

Slinky secrets 
Hotter than the sun

No peachy frairs 
No trendy rechauffe
I'm with you 
So I can't go on

All my violence raining tears upon the sheets
I'm bewildered, for we're strangers when we meet

Preening ourselves in the snow
Forget my name 
But I'm over you

Blended sunrise
And it's a dying world

We scavenge up our clothes

All my violence, raging tears upon the sheets
I'm resentful, for we're strangers when we meet

Cold tired fingers 
Tapping out your memories
Halfway sadness 
Dazzled by the new

Your embrace 
It was all that I feared
That whirling room 
We trade by vendu

Steely resolve is falling from me
My poor soul, poor bruised passivity
All your regrets ran rough-shod over me
I'm so glad that we're strangers when we meet

I'm so thankful, cause we're strangers when we meet.

I can't eat a bite
'Cause the man I love
He don't treat me right

He makes me feel so blue
I don't know what to do
Sometime I sit and sigh
And then begin to cry
'Cause my best friend
Said his last goodbye

There's a change in the ocean
Change in the deep blue sea, my baby
I'll tell you folks, there ain't no change in me
My love for that man will always be

Now I can read his letters
I sure can't read his mind
I thought he's lovin' me
He's leavin' all the time
Now I see my poor love was blind

Now I got the crazy blues
Since my baby went away
I ain't got no time to lose
I must find him today

Now the doctor's gonna do all that he can
But what you're gonna need is an undertaker man
I ain't had nothin' but bad news
Now I got the crazy blues

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

Be my love, for no one else can end this yearning
This need that you and you alone create
Just fill my arms the way you've filled my dreams
The dreams that you inspire with ev'ry sweet desire
Be my love, and with your kisses set me burning
One kiss is all I need to seal my fate
And hand in hand, we'll find love's promised land
There'll be no one but you, for me eternally",Be My Love,1992
Eric Alexander,"Laura is the face in the misty lights.
Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,
That you can never quite recall.

And you see Laura on a train that is passing through.
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura,1992
Eric Alexander,"Love is a many splendored thing
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king
Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing

Eric Alexander,"I want to see your face in every kind of light
In fields of dawn and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

I want to see your face in every kind of light
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two

Through all of my life
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you

Eric Alexander,"Why do they think up stories that link my name with yours?
Why do the neighbors chatter all day, behind their doors?
I know a way to prove what they say is quite untrue.
Here is the gist, a practical list of ""donts"" for you.

Don't throw bouquets at me
Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much
People will say we're in love!

Don't sigh and gaze at me
Your sighs are so like mine
Your eyes mustn't glow like mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't start collecting things
Give me my rose and my glove.
Sweetheart they're suspecting things
People will say we're in love.

Don't praise my charm too much
Don't look so vain with me
Don't stand in the rain with me
People will say we're in love!

Don't take my arm too much
Don't keep your hand in mine
Your hand feels so grand in mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't dance all night with me
Till the stars fade from above.
They'll see it's alright with me
People will say we're in love.",People Will Say We're in Love,1994

Eric Alexander,"Good morning heartache, you old gloomy sight
Good morning heartache, thought we said goodbye last night
I turned and tossed until it seemed you had gone
But here you are with the dawn

Wish I'd forget you, but you're here to stay
It seems I met you when my love went away
Now everyday I start by saying to you
Good morning heartache, what's new

Stop haunting me now
Can't chase you no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues

Good morning heartache, here we go again
Good morning heartache, you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hanging around

Eric Alexander,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,1995
Eric Alexander,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,1995
Eric Alexander,"She's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her

That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,1995
Eric Alexander,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Eric Alexander,"Let's build a stairway to the stars
And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song
We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along
Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?
Can't we sail away on a little dream 
And settle high on the crest of a thrill!

All the world a dream come true
Did it really happen, was I really there, was I really there with you?
 
We lived our little drama, we kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I can't forget the glamor, your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I never planned in my imagination a situation so heavenly
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear
My heart beat like a hammer, my arms wound around you tight

Eric Alexander,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

I live for every moment with you
To see you, to touch you, to imagine this will be

And life will be rainbows as I learn the secret of
The miracle that love can do

When an irrepressible smile such as yours
Warms an old implacable heart such as mine
Don't say no because I insist

Somewhere, somehow
Someone's gotta be kissed

So, en garde, who knows what the fates might have in store
From their vast mysterious sky
I'll try hard ignorin' those lips that I adore
