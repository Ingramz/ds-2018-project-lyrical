El Trono de México,"Un día aterrizo en mi vida
Como un aeroplano
Recuerdo no haber dicho si
Jamas pidió mi mano

Un día aterrizo en mi vida
Como un aeroplano
Recuerdo no haber dicho si
Jamas pidió mi mano

Mi corazon desenganchado
Por tantos años clausurado
Se vio sorprendido
Al final se quedo enamorado

Pisando sigilosamente como bailarina
Entro a mi vida despacito
Casi de puntillas

Su mezcla de mujer y niña
Me destemplaba las rodillas
Sus ojos en cuarto menguante
Me hacían cosquillas

Y ahora que mi vida camina
Por un solo sentido
Me siento perdido
Y ahora que se fue de mi vida
Cual sera mi destino
Sin dejar un rastro en el camino
Sin un aviso
Se ha ido

Que duro es despertar a solas
Como un perturbado
Llevando tras de la inconsciencia
Un sueno almidonado

Mi corazon desenganchado
Por tantos años empolvado
Se vio sorprendido
Al final se quedo enamorado

Y ahora que mi vida camina
Por un solo sentido
Me siento perdido
Y ahora que se fue de mi vida
Cual sera mi destino
Sin dejar un rastro en el camino
Sin un aviso
Se ha ido

Un día aterrizo en mi vida
Como un aeroplano",Se Ha Ido,2007
El Trono de México,"Se me acaba la vida
Ahora que ya no esta aquí con migo
Se fue la alegría y llego el dolor a mi corazon

No puedo olvidarla
Hoy se asoma a mi puerta su recuerdo
No debo llamarla
No la puedo sacar de mi pensamiento
Me hace tanta falta
Como falta la brisa en las mañanas
Como el sol a el día
Así tu le haces falta a mi vida

Cielo de estrellas llévame a ella
Y devuélveme su risa
Quiero mirarla
Para decirle
Que me faltan sus caricias
Cielo de estrellas dile que vuelva
Que me muero sin su amor
Me muero sin su amor

Fingir que no0 la quiero

Des hommes sans voix sanglotent tout bas,
Pourquoi ?
Arrachées les mères aux enfants
Et le sang au même sang
L'amour à l'amour, l'amante à l'amant sauvagement
Arrachés les hommes à leurs terres
Et le frère à l'autre frère
Des chaines aux pieds pour pas s'échapper
Et sur l'océan, tourne encore comme un mauvais vent
L'âme noire de l'homme blanc tâchée de sang
Et sur l'océan dans le mauvais temps du temps
L'âme noire de l'homme blanc vole encore, alors
A quoi sert encore un corsaire
Quand les seuls rêves qu'il libère
C'est de port en port la fièvre de l'or
Et pire encore
A quoi sert encore de se taire
Quand à chaque tour de terre,
Ces viles envies divisent nos vies
Et sur l'océan, tourne encore comme un mauvais vent
L'âme noire de l'homme blanc tâchée de sang
Et sur l'océan dans le mauvais temps du temps
L'âme noire de l'homme blanc vole encore, alors
Vole encore, vole encore, vole encore...",L' Âme Noire de l'Homme Blanc,2007

Tell it on moi, ya never been raised by proper stars
Foolin' ya self tryna claim what's ours
I'm international wid magical flows on national radio
Jay-Z approved it on Westwood show
I'm blessed wid a ear for music, beautiful when I use it
Abuse beats for the better the king of this era
Anybody'll tell ya, the four fifth's mega
Honor celebrity flicks wid glamour kid etcetera
Cause I'm in the ghetto wid money, you don't remember
I put knots on the map, ya s'posed to show me love
Wid grad fore ya get me, yeh I'm that chosen thug
I spit on a track flowin' like skatin' on frozen blood
Amazin' when I roll a couple a spliffs support on tele
Vocabulary photogenic, vision me at the airport wid Morrison
sippin' on some cherry, dip overseas and I'm back in London

Introduced to Missy Ellion, top shot I'm minglin'

[Verse 2]
I been around the world and back, and got nuttin' to show for it
By now, I thought I would've explode to bits
Huh, but it's been much harder
I had to run farther away from the throne one accepts upon stardom
Lose ya self there, whether you believe it or don't
Spendin' nights breathin' in smoke, whether cheeba or dope
Then hot break it down to litres of coke
Walk through the crowd wid all intentions I'm leavin' wid hoes
Seems like a nice way of livin', the stressful have
Cause all them jealous cats, ready to test your ass
Let's not take it there, I remain cool
Learnt how to handle them situations in grade school
I paid dues, niggas know that, the name sound familiar
From New York to London, when crews talk amongst us
it's nothin' but good things
Not only the bad stuff is what the hood brings
Listen, cats is salivatin' plottin' on eatin' ya meal
The four fives carried in our dome keep it concealed
Runnin' laps around tracks 'til we bleed from our heels
Disregardin' where we grow from we teamin' up still

Got 'em in the studio poppin' Valiums, remasterin' they album
I'm about to re-up and restructure the case
You stuck, you about to get rearranged and replaced
I got plans for this rap game (uh-huh)
Put your head in the toilet and look son,
If you think my shit done changed
My shit is, out of your range, rip you out of your frame
Cop your tape, and the next day, copped an exchange
If you ain't, rockin' raw, what you rockin' for??
Without heat, y'all MC's, ain't hot no more
So for you lame cats tryin' to put your hit out
Try rockin' back and forth

That shit would be as ignorant as Jimmy the Greek
Claimin' they Godzilla's when they really Godzooki
Got a mill' from Charlie Brown, when I kidnapped Snoopy

Rhyme menace, that burst your verbal nuisance
In accordance, with all the laws from the cordless
Starbuck coming through, leavin any pimp whoreless

LATEEF:

Looking, over a city, that's gritty, and rather pretty
A pity, it's hard to find, but inequity, cover
Every itty bitty square diamond of jiggy
They givin ??, up to woodsy
Manipulatin they minds in the alleyways
These dizzy and shitty rats, the sizes of kitty-kats
They cross paths when traffic subsides; somewhere
Some brothers is overstandin on a hot black rooftop
Freestylin for they GOT damn lives, the spirit, it gets live
And answers the question why God blessed the Earth
But, buildings block out the sky, and the children
Are oversexualized, media-wise, brutalized by parents
At the tender age of five, in front of they siblings wide-eyed
Nah not surprised, just the real scene regularly
Up in between the lies, try to put it together GET
They pieces of the pie, hope they clever and tough
Make it better before they die, plant the next seeds
Somewhere in the South Bronx, or Patterson ??
The baddest with sharp chomp, to splatter when mouths-off
Retali' and swear he could damage em Dunn
But that will shatter his Mom's faith
In the art that she burns, herbs and candles of perm'
It's hard to call it see cause times change and the world turn
Some end up slangin dope, some end up strung out
On coke and sherm, some party every night for the rest of they life
And some learn, go corporate all professional rhetoric
With sensational glory, let me tell you all one day
That it is it ain't boring, and so hard to ignore it
Cause any day in this fork, that they callin New York
Based on nothin but currents, you can find yourself a failure
Or a success story
On the subway, at three in the mornin, huh
Or on the corner, or up on a rooftop yawnin
Meditatin upon it, lookin over a city that's gritty
And rather pretty, a pity
It's hard to find but inequity covers every itty bitty
Square diamond, the engine, of America, inchin
Toward hysteria, pimpin, every fate

EL-P:

My friends are the faces you sit on, lickin a profit popsic'
Where food is just a necessity between sitcom watchin
Soak up quick image instead of black marks on papyrus
Fabric logic, where true to dirt perps go incogninant
Think of Soup Nazi, empatzi project hard copy
Books will suffer Farenheits, quality of life flesh sliced
Omega daylight quota, pop luck lottery info
GigaPet rapist, internet pedophile disco
Sensationalist function of truth, dirty ass fetish
Glass bubble lo-cal profile, the year's fiscal
Workin family, Social Jowe, boot camp
Rehab group home kid, idolized cartoon missile
Mostly, lonely, plant life
Cement arena scream when you don't listen closely
Switchblade amaze young gun Brooklyn blood transplant
Immature Menendez fashion
Crystal Method lover, buy the bottle, jungle captive
Where MC's got little cocks on teeth with fillings out like magnets
Caught up in the dragnet, tri-felon
Shoula packed a plastic handheld lead shark repellant
I sense the tension building, since canvas killing
K-9's roam trained our district
Culture murder politic sadistic
Policy all tough backtrackin', caught up in a tune from rockin fat cap
I told him it was art but just got laughed at
Burner liquid concoction on hot celsius
And kelpachlorics for the fatal facial, spray deface you
Sooner than never, most lawless progress together
Fuck the bullshit, I react to acid flux product definitive junk
Brain rape train bottle burners or books, FUCK THAT!

LYRICS BORN:

Imagine this, Angeles, or San Francisco
And everybody sandwiched in, can't stop here and ambulences
Don't nobody ass-kiss, ain't practical bein passive
In the city you ask so much ass and mo' asses
It's a batch of latin girl, actin rappin off the spanish
English quest, can't understand, as the languages clash
And every ad is vandalism, the trash gets aneurysms
It's delegates and panelists all representin they nationalism
And the battle inches on, every section separated
By eth-nic features decorated veterans deliverin
Les-sons to the younger people stoops that double as bleachers
And I'm part, of an elite fleet, of MC's, and Truth Speakers
I import, concrete beats, that just speak, when my moods flavor
My peers I beg forgiveness, I just don't buy twelve inches
Too many independents, they share the same resemblance
Too hard to make decisions, I built up a resistance
Like I'm fightin off a sickness plus they just don't hold my interest
But, mission'in out, to the indigineous birthplace
The first day, I inched below the sur-face
And found, inspiration, in surplus, in my, in-terpretation
Of dis-turbed crazy world, of love, dope shit, attemptin contemplation on
Uniquely woven and continuously flowin intricately sewn into

Because what I'm spittin a lot (tipper) than (hawk tooie)
I spit fire all you mcs are tracking about it
Try and dis gimme a mic I turn cats to liars

Id rather bless em and make em turn christian
Better learn and listen or become one of my burn victims

[Kimani]
I be the energies of people before they say shit
To peep they fake appearance like Joan River's facelift
By my name of hieroglyphics you could say I'm prolific
I left something for lost ones who missed the space ship
All aboard these concepts beyond your vision
I got intergalactic the minute your block formed your opinion
Born and raised off the boulevard of lyndon
Where people do what they feel regardless if they're forgiven
We all livin the X Generation of children
and we all givin what we got to give on this mission
Till this world's ended and meets with a sudden collision
Yo we bring it back ten times more efficient

[Oracle]
Yo yo yo yo we rock harder than jams by Vincer Carter
Using art of war tactics smash kids that oughta know better
Than to test the clique we flow better
From the NYC givin more Fitz than Ella
Set it off now you want to brawl we rock why'all
Cut you in half then watch you fall like Darth Maul
All of these kids hatin against my one band
Soundin silly like Wesley Snipes needin a sun tan
I be the one man here sippin Guinness and beer
As the whole hemisphere sittin quakin in fear
don't near to this kid quickly you'll learn how shits flipped
I got the whole world tapin my joints like Linda Tripp

Decrepit as the sweaty inner ass cheeks of Dennis Franz (???)
Son of a dirty monkey the thug grabs abusive
Whore and a smack before I rock toothless
Ambesin, Lake and palm is bad medicine
With brakes for hands dance to the pain game
Worker ant rebel rebel work car radio reject the fat though
Sliced nice exacto
Its a sunny night for gash and lure the tact contract
Killer villain sick villain
Blankets for indians this here's for children
Fun for the internet just say no to cigarettes
You're soft as pikachu on roofies in a bathtub
I can see the inexeperience in your aura slash coding
The perpetrator math that you taught is eroding
Fuck it I'm bonin

from distance when the name rings bells you feel the suction
So in order to survive while going to J-Live
realize to speak wise by the way your lyrics (arrive)
Because in the obstruction of justice in my construction
Will lead to your abduction which leads to your destruction
For those that oppose the will or doubt the skill
I put you on the clock when I got time to kill
And seein as how there's never been a time better than now
Rewind rewards you wit a free refill

I'm outspoken broken english hairline fracture words
I'm on some Hitchcock shit throw me along from the pack of birds
Feel the vultures they about to die soon feel the typhoon

There's a war between these underground and these commercial acts
Put us on the same stage and well just hurt these cats

This is the last chapter
Bombs hit who? Crushed what?
Over there? Oh my god, oh dear
I was hmm.. I think I was *h* movin somewhere
About to paint my fear bright glare not quite clear
Stay blinded to the light of possibilities
Think I heard the screams of those in my proximity
On how they started thinking wishfully
Guided by fear I'm suddenly aware
Please, is anybody out there?

It was a gentle fission kiss on my block
And hot light like a baby breathing sigh a terrain
And now my name is merely left
Suckin on brain exist before the final flash
The emotion of pretty details of a life I had passed
Now my warm night in Brooklyn is ash
Falling from the snot of loosies that I choked
Around the corner from class
Before the moments when the moon can move fast
Another summer slowly growing with the friendships
That would end with a blast
Or how the hours could so blissfully lag
She slid her tongue between my lips and I gasped
Told my dawgs and they laughed
Now we're combining our cash at last
A pack of smokes and a flask
Hopeless liquor with a

Convert to atheism denounce god pronounce religion dead
Faith in nothing trace my wrists with razors
I refuse to wait for the blades to erase my spirit
Death - faced with it - run to it - not from it
Swallow all the pills in the medicine cabinet
Chase it with a bottle of 151 hung mommy
Head outside the smashed windows in trash my hotel lobby
Break the grip off the time at last
I find I get to him up Wish I did more sinnin
Get a strap on run up in two women
Laid in the middle of a highway wait for pain to hit me
Still a can with people lootin screamin come and get me
Finally it was porn shop biggest gun crowded street
Blow my brains to hell - I'm gone - and let the devil come for me

What's the chance that I'd be one of the last ones left of my preceders
The Earth Crusher came before I could even conceive a fetus
But I did go from nothing to misunderstood elitist
Who tried to tell his people the lies instead of acting like defeatists
But what good is that? Cause we're now all goin to hell
Like some kid playin in his class out talkin before the bell
I died believing in righteousness but I could have indulged more
Cause giving in to temptation don't seem that raw no more
I heard some airline offered flights into space
I shoulda took it to see earth before they matched up the place
I thought I'd be alone when they finally came to get me
But nobody gotta miss me because they all comin with me

Our horizon was accessorizing we bred more need
Best believe this be the equation of greed
I need a new car and thus new breaks
Another tune-up with lube
Whatever's put together shall be unscrewed
In times of famine we made more food
Food made more people
It's all explained within the cycle of evil
Would I trade it all?
Cruisin down the highway on a bright summer day
Gazing out a plane to see the earth from miles away
Watchin the patriots win the super bowl
Grabbin that fumble from Ricky Prole
Or my stereo provided me with rhythm and soul
I don't know, all I know is I feel guilt for
Every single thing I've ever bought and sold
I shoulda been at more demonstrations
Planted bombs in corporations
Murdered CEO's and cancelled TV shows
Burned billboards and torn posters
I coulda read more
Finally I get to meet this god they left us dead for
And its ill, its power to the form of a bill
To which people killed by manipulated free will
Conscience be the crucifix a chopping block for poppycock
And I can feel our spirits drop upon these streets I oddly walk
Enough talk! Here's my last chance to cherish a thought
My flesh is fully melted and my stomach's in a knot
So to my love I hated to leave you alone
Parted my zone passion took me to places and my life was a poem
Baby I was on my way home about to catch a flight
Our meeting has dissolved in radiation and light
Love you gave me made me shine
You're gorgeous with a powerful mind
You lifted my spirits and strengthened my spine
I'm at peace with my life cause knowin you was divine
You made me see eternal beauty in a world that was dying

Got it all up on ya back now you walkin a plank

Do it double time all up in yo face
Like piranhas when you drop fresh meat in the tank
Fell off of the game can't keep ya rank
Mad cause you try to rock sweet but you ain't
Been around no-will shit where crews peel clips
Niggaz that kill for fun
Wanna talk that ill shit sayin how you kill shit
Bullets still in ya gun
Koolaid in ya veins so now you gotta change clothes
'cause you pissed ya pants
Saw me durango said you wanna tango
Now this is the dance
Where ya shoes at where ya crew at
Claim you do gats but you do rap
What you gonna bust a verse right before the guns burst
Push ya girl on the ground so that you can run first
Now you about to get rolled up hold up wait
Just an emcee that was tryin to make cake
Now you gotta gun all up in ya face
All of a sudden found god like run and mase
Thought it be fun to front on tape
Now you wish you woulda have stuck to drum n' bass
But you had to be hard on the boulevard

Approached the finest girl like shutup bitch
Than I grab the microphone and I cut up kids
Like a hot knife straight through a butter stick
Now I'm in the spotlight about to rock all night
Shot of tequila than a hot mamacita
Who said she know to swallow but not margaritas
Body on point so I follow the leader
Need more tequila so I swallow the liter
How can the night get sweeter (cant)
So I passed out woke up do it again
Won't neva roll up ya crew in the wind
High velocity high viscocity slippin right pass your animosity
Fans are constantly, askin me
Who said what and who has beef
My crew got stuck in we to musty
So try to weigh it out with the truth laid out (stop the gossip)
That's just played out there's more to ya life than underground rap
What you waste all ya time and you wanna run it back
All on the message board runnin ya yap
At the end of the night only wanted to chat
Now you know that you got issues
That early in the morn you should look at some porn
And jack off right in the tissue
Than call it a night that's probley the life
Go to sleep with the girl that you callin ya wife
Wake up to the same shit different day
Everybody onto work and they on the way
Cause we all got bills and rent to pay
Lent to the earth wasn't meant to stay
So before I'm gone I wanna make a hit song that'll always get some play
Got the homey el producto workin in the cut so what you got to say

You wanna trace along the pattern of fair please rest
I wanna pattern how the drum scheme mechanism I.D. jux breath commence fresh
Test the mesh, metal on the chestplate tech

They couldn't move like el, ox, murs, lif or bazooka tooth die so useless
So use this tip that'll have a little truth in it like (poof)
Deep space nine milli mechanism fist raise the roof again
Who stays on a move that says
Jukie with a shake ring catapult crawl through the trenches
Revelation manifacture eat senses all city
All compositive battle turn logic pretty
All the hard edge tomorrow brings heads or home up in me come get me
I'm for this shitty dizzy spinning lawless constant progress whose with me
Fabolous thunder bird word nerd unda that tom pill shit
Who heard kill quick
And independent since 96' they still ride ya dick
I refined the style with wild wit from an era with an automan mix
Community watch groups enlist young kids
Hit the road skippy
I don't answer to you george bush or the war time committee
Dumber than a mongaloid race movin shit
With a heart of hell's tutelage bruisin shit
Every time you make a move the industry start the new movement kid
I'm not losin bitch
Essentially on the edge of a generations new ruthlesness
Who's in charge, take me to ya leader man stop the foolishness
Cop the new shit bitch

I'm from Brooklyn, vandals bedrocks
Scandal bedlam, broken burnt up
New New York speed, new speed true speed
Universe dirt, birds of loose leaf
Form the casbah, bring the bleeders
Sanity fistfucks, such allegiance
Born a trash maid, grew in garbage
Mutant hostage, do the knowledge

I see you all regardless
I know what lies are like

I'm a young man, I'm unhappy
We deserve that, dream collapsing
I'm just one man, so damn angry
Truth confusion, Scared with truthers
Hide your foil, hide your face
Say hi horsemen, higher stakes
Hi again, well how about that
Well how the fuck else can I react?

Hell you're too preachy, you don't reach me
Right and wrong's flawed, you say easy?
Ok maybe, I was normal
On some rap shit, up raw backspin
Paws collapsin, back to windmill
Innocent thrill, some old-fashioned
Moral D-Ray, I'm no different
I wish my whole still existence
From the blades, Necissate shit
Lifespan program, final digits
You're my daddy, you'll protect me
I need guidance to live correctly
I can't fight you, fear of the ether
I'm the servant, you're the teacher
(What the fuck man?), Oh so sorry
That's the implant talking for me

And a time release that the capsule held so strange

Saw the wrong and withstand the tug
Of my fees the reason, a big mistake
Bore a likeness of those before him
Who held the title in flesh and name
Said hello and then said goodbye
And in between he would plead his case
Saw the dark and embraced the light
And he felt the crawl of his calling fate
Stuck the landing but tripped the wire
And let every weapon off in his face
Saw the looting and convoluting
Of absolution that never came
Tried polluting with contribution
And held the movement in every frame

And run to the last grand contraband
Caught the harm and then bought the farm

Saw the rug and withstand the tug

Bore a likeness of those before

Saw the light but embraced the dark
As she heard the call of her crawling hate
""Fuck the landing, I'll man the weapons
And hold the barrel to my own fate""
Saw the promise and felt the presence
Of possibility, just not her's
Tried connecting with lost affection
And saw direction with lust not words
More of the withering, unforgiving
And bad to the last drop, Brooklyn birds
Fill the weapon and spin the chamber
And bend the part and are not hurt

And ding, dong, dashed so much he wore a hole out on the welcome mat

The way you just smiled at me; pro move

Slithering, writhing, wiggling
Living where the moon don't glow
Why would you book a ticket with a living Costa Concordia?
Why would you travel on a vessel that might not float?

My young bitch here fine like Pam Grier when she made that movie Coffy
But when my wife's in town, ay Jackie Brown just stay up off me
'Cause if they don't somebody get shot and they gon' buy a coffin

With the pull of a pin a grenade get a crowd to they feet and a soul to its options
I'm a fool for the win I been made to be loud while these other cats drowning in softness
In a urn or the dirt get tossed in
With a grin or a smirk get accosted
I'm a sin on the verse like a kid in a hearse or a nun in a cum shot, stop it

Big beast in a cage with a heart full of rage, it seems I can't behave
You could try till you die, oh well you failed, it seems the world can't be saved
These streets is full with the wolves that starve for the week so they after the weak
In a land full of lambs I am and I'll be damned if I don't show my teeth

Man, print this shit, I'm a misfit
Got a style from the guts of the most irrational beast in the district
Born to the next gen system
Slow water drip to the temple to live in a prison
When the walls don't appear to your vision
One floor down from that mall's that prison
Where shower stalls get all y'all missin'
Pardon me, I got half-wit vision
But fuck I know, I just crawled here, cap'n
Pass me the baton, the rest a y'all batten the hatches
In fact, better scram, I'm a bastard
On the lam in a hatchback blasting some rap shit, trying not to slam into traffic
With my feet on the wheel and my hands through the moon roof laughing
Let's crash this
See the truth from the womb is a fool-proof
Plan to be doomed while the damned do they dances
So I move through the room like an animal fooling a master
But I don't got love for the hand with the food, matter fact I am drooling at that shit
I don't only bite but I'm rabid
Try to pet my fucking head again and I'mma put
A tooth through the flesh of the palm that you jack with
This city just screams black magic, and the threat to my heart got traction
Maybe should've never started this path
Every time I get a chance to advance it's backwards
No thanks to my very own actions
Get a couple good drinks in the kid
I can flip on a friend, take a drug, fuck a chick that I shouldn't
Oh god, I am one of those mad men

Trying not to walk crooked while this anchor's dropped
But I been out on them choppy waves and it's hard to say where this land begins and that water stops
I got sea legs, I got sea legs, I got sea legs

Real shit, I came for the jewels
I'm the killer of kings and fools
I'm the reason the season for treason starts this evening
And this evening the odds ain't even
People praying to the gods but the gods ain't even listening
Don't matter if you're Muslim, Hebrew, Christian
When death run in the distance there will be no Mercy me's
There will be no reprieve for the thieves
There will be no respect for The Thrones
No master mastered these bones
Your idols all are my rivals
I rival all of your idols
I stand on towers like Eiffel, I rifle down all your idols
Niggas will perish in Paris, niggas is nothing but parrots
I write for the writers that write for the liars that impress you and your parents
Is this real or another dimension?
Am I trippin' here in the kitchen?
Am I a victim of my convictions?
I feel my sanity slippin'
And I think I like the freedom
Cannibal, animal, rappers I eat 'em
Even in Dubai I smoke like it's legal

Made in America home of the (Eagle)

Me and Mike will go Twin Hype and do a dance on your windpipes
Put your fucking jazz hands back in your pants and get them shits sliced
Caught the ghost when I was yay high, so today I stay way high
Do not worry about my habits, without sin I'd probably hate life

This is dope as that hard white you stuff in a crack pipe
A hit of this, a kid with Tourrets will chill out and act right
I'm fat but I dress nice and bitches finesse Mike
They suck the dick and squeeze on my belly like bagpipes

I slap and I suck clits, I fuck in my church shoes
Humblest guy in the room and I am in the room too (Get it?)
I'll bend you over on the roof while whistling Audio Two
They say that once a girl go Brooklyn no more soft dick will do

I'm so Rakim and Eric B
Bitches check out my melody
I might Slick Rick on a fella (Foul), catch me a felony
Ay, I might Shyne Po a ho, pow! Catch me a case
Producto must have rolled this L because this blunt feel laced

I must say you do look stunning
I mean, you're the kind of girl I can really see myself artificially inseminating
Oh I'm sorry, I'm being a little aggressive, right?
Can we start from the beginning? My name is Chest Rockwell, right?
And I love to make love to your booty hole
Bad boy

This is born alone die alone, so my dialogue's dastardly
Life's a tragedy generator operating at max capacity
This is porno for piraters, to the crooks it is relaxing
I am foreign to that soft talk, you can tell it from my accent

This is arrogant fat black, it is what it is
This that stingy with dick, bitch, not a fuck do I give
I'm no respecter of person, I'm no respecter of rules
I catch the prince of England slipping, he goin' run me the jewels
I could wake up brain dead tomorrow and my soliloquy still will be
The illest there ever be, 'cause I be what you'll never be
My pugnacious rhyme patterns prove pitbull in my pedigree
And dogs fight to the death, you say you better, you better be

Not one shit given, El-P's chillin'
Raised in a shack in the back of the village
Trained by the wolves in the woods
To avenge on the men who elected themselves my killers
Mike's a villain, Nick Hooks chillin'
We don't have a need to know your feelings
We don't believe in the same shit anyway, Run the Jewels is not for your children

How you feeling now sweetheart? A little more relaxed?
Maybe it's that half a molly I put in your Mountain Dew
Yeah, works like a charm
Just chill out for a second, relax, relax, I got it under control
I got you a glass of Beefeater, I got a brand new deck of Uno cards
Oh yeah baby, the night's just getting started
Okay, how about I come over tonight and pick you up in my brand new Segway
We can go over to Long John Silver's, get a fish platter
You can take me home and massage me with butter all on my neck
I love you",Twin Hype Back,2013

Spending my money, honey, I didn't care
Taking my friends out for a mighty good time
I drank that good gin, champagne and wine

Just as soon as my money got low
I couldn't find no friends and I had no place to go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it till that eagle grins

'Cause I found out that nobody wants you
Nobody wants you when they find out
That you're down and out
In your pocket, there's not not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

Just let you get back up on your feet again
Here they all come telling you their your old long lost friend
And this I wanna tell you and about it I have no doubt
Nobody wants you, nobody needs you
Nobody wants when you're down and out

And a rose that is fading
Roses whither away like the sunflower
I yearn to turn my face to the dawn
I am waiting for the day

Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone in the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days, I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every street lamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in when the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies, another night is over

Nothing I say will convince him this isn't a trick.
A drink on a clear moonlit night, I relax, she smiles
There's something unpleasant going on

So with immaculate timing, I'm left to carry the can
Embarrassed, outnumbered, marooned

Now she can't be working for them, I mean us
She seems so very straightforward but where is he?
He has to come back, he wanted this meeting, well, didn't he?
Maybe he's scared, just as scared as he was in the game

Oh, I just couldn't care less
He can go right ahead, go and wreck his career
I know I've done my best
Well, at least she's a good looking spy

What if my Russian friend thinks that my plans
Are more of an intimate kind?
If I don't say something and soon
He'll go nobody's on nobody's side

Listen, I hate to break up the mood
Get to the point, begin the begin
Haven't you noticed we're a protagonist short
In this idyllic, well produced scene?

All I can say is moments ago
He was right here ready and waiting
Never mind him, I haven't missed him so far

Maybe it won't do any harm
To struggle on without his charm?
Funny how all at once I feel
That he can go jump off the mountain I won't care

This is the one situation I wanted most to avoid
My dear opponent, I really can't imagine why
So I am not dangerous then? What a shame
Oh, you're not dangerous, who could think that of you?

You, you are so strange
Why can't you be what you ought to be?
You should be scheming
Intriguing, too clever by half

I have to hand it to you for you've managed
To make me forget why I ever agreed to this farce
I don't know why I can't think of anything I would rather do
Than be wasting my time on mountains with you

Elaine Paige,"I met him at a party just a couple of years ago
He was rather over hearty and ridiculous
But as I'd seen him on the screen
He cast a certain spell

I basked in his attraction for a couple of hours or so
His manners were a fraction too meticulous
If he was real or not I couldn't tell
But like a silly fool I fell

Mad about the boy
I know it's stupid to be mad about the boy
I'm so ashamed of it but must admit
The sleepless nights I've had about the boy

On the silver screen
He melts my foolish heart in every single scene
Although I'm quite aware that here and there
Are traces of the cad about the boy

Lord knows I'm not a fool girl
I really shouldn't care
Lord knows I'm not a schoolgirl
In the flurry of her first affair

Will it ever cloy, this odd diversity of misery and joy?
I'm feeling quite insane and young again
And all because I'm mad about the boy

Mad about the boy
I know I'm potty but I'm mad about the boy
He sets me heart on fire with love's desire
In fact I've got it bad about the boy

When I do the rooms
I see 'is face in all the brushes and the brooms
Last week I strained me back, and got the sack
And had a row with dad about the boy

I'm finished with Navaro
I'm tired of Richard Dix
I'm pierced with cupid's arrow
Every Wednesday from four till six

'Ow I should enjoy
To let 'im treat me as a plaything or a toy
I'd give my all to him and crawl to him
So 'elp me gawd I'm mad about the boy

Mad about the boy
It's pretty funny but I'm mad about the boy
He has an odd appeal that makes me feel
There may be something sad about the boy

Walking down the street
His eyes look out at me from people that I meet
I can't believe it's true but when I'm blue
In some strange way I'm glad about the boy

I'm hardly sentimental
Love isn't so sublime
I have to pay my rental
And I can't afford to waste much time

If I could employ
A little magic that would finally destroy
This dream that pains me and enchains me
But I can't because I'm mad about the boy

I'm mad about the boy
I'm mad about the boy
I'm mad about the boy

Elaine Paige,"They asked me how I knew
My true love was true
I of course replied
""Something here inside
Cannot be denied""

They said someday you'll find
All who love are blind
When your heart's on fire
You don't realize
Smoke gets in your eyes

So I chaffed and I gaily laughed
To think they would doubt my love
Yet today, my love has flown away
I am without my love

Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say
""When a lovely flame dies,
Smoke gets in your eyes.""",Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,1994
Elaine Paige,"Daylight, see the dew on the sunflower
And a rose that is fading
Roses whither away like the sunflower
I yearn to turn my face to the dawn
I am waiting for the day

Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone in the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days, I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every street lamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in when the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun if you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is

Look
A new day has begun",Memory,1995

The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways
The atmosphere as thrilling here as always

Feel the magic in the making

And the early morning madness
And the magic in the making

I've come home at last

If today

'Stead of landing on Plymouth Rock, 
Plymouth Rock would land on them. 

In olden days, a glimpse of stocking

Good authors too who once knew better words 
Now only use four-letter words 
Writing prose. 
Anything goes. 
If driving fast cars you like, 
If low bars you like, 
If old hymns you like, 
If bare limbs you like, 
If Mae West you like, 
Or me undressed you like, 
Why, nobody will oppose. 
When ev'ry night the set that's smart is in- 
Truding in nudist parties in 
Studios. 
Anything goes. 

When Missus Ned McLean (God bless her) 
Can get Russian reds to ""yes"" her, 
Then I suppose 
Anything goes. 
When Rockefeller still can hoard en- 
Ough money to let Max Gordon 
Produce his shows, 
Anything goes. 
The world has gone mad today 
And good's bad today, 
And black's white today, 
And day's night today, 
And that gent today 
You gave a cent today 
Once had several chateaux. 
When folks who still can ride in jitneys 
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitneys 
Lack baby clo'es, 
Anything goes. 

If Sam Goldwyn can with great conviction 
Instruct Anna Sten in diction, 
Then Anna shows 
Anything goes. 
When you hear that Lady Mendl standing up 
Now turns a handspring landing up- 
On her toes, 
Anything goes. 
Just think of those shocks you've got 
And those knocks you've got 
And those blues you've got 
From that news you've got 
And those pains you've got

From those little radios.

You destroy my mind

I lose control and shiver deep inside

Is a whisper in my ear

I would surely die
If you dismiss me from your love
You take my breath away

Don't leave me here all by myself

Elaine Paige,"Daylight, see the dew on the sunflower
And a rose that is fading
Roses whither away like the sunflower
I yearn to turn my face to the dawn
I am waiting for the day

Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone in the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days, I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every street lamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in when the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun if you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is

A new day has begun","Memory, song (from ""Cats"")",2002
Elaine Paige,"High flying, adored, so young, the instant queen
A rich beautiful thing of all the talents, a cross between 
A fantasy of the bedroom and a saint 
You were just a back street girl 
Hustling and fighting 
Scratching and biting 
High flying, adored, did you believe in your wildest moments 
All this would be yours, that you'd become the lady of them all? 
Were there stars in your eyes when you crawled in at night 
From the bars, from the sidewalks
From the gutter theatrical? 
Don't look down, it's a long, long way to fall
High flying, adored, what happens now, where do you go from here? 
For someone on top of the world, the view is not exactly clear 
A shame you did it all at twenty-six
There are no mysteries now 
Nothing can thrill you 
No-one fulfill you 
High flying, adored, I hope you come to terms with boredom 
So famous, so easily, so soon, is not the wisest thing to be
You won't care if they love you, it's been done before 
You'll despair if they hate you 
You'll be drained of all energy 
All the young who've made it would agree 

High flying, adored, that's good to hear, but unimportant 
My story's quite usual, local girl makes good, weds famous man 
I was slap in the right place at the perfect time
Filled a gap--I was lucky 
But one thing I'll say for me 
No-one else can fill it like I can","High, Flying Adored",2002
Elaine Paige,"Just the other night a hometown football game
My wife and I ran into my old high school flame
And as I introduced them the past came back to me
And I couldn't help but think of the way things used to be

She was the one that I'd wanted for all times
And each night I'd spend prayin' that God would make her mine
And if he'd only grant me this wish I wished back then
I'd never ask for anything again

Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers
Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs
That just because he doesn't answer doesn't mean he don't care
Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers

She wasn't quite the angel that I remembered in my dreams
And I could tell that time had changed me
Inn her eyes too it seemed
We tried to talk about the old days
There wasn't much we could recall
I guess the Lord knows what he's doin' after all

And as she walked away and I looked at my wife
And then and there I thankedd the good Lord
For the gifts in my life

Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers
Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs
That just because he doesn't answer doesn't mean he don't care
Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers

Some of God's greatest gifts are all too often unanswered...

Instead of help we were given a crowd

And I've had so many men before
In very many ways
He's just one more

Should I bring him down?
Should I scream and shout?
Should I speak of love
Let my feelings out?
I never thought I'd come to this
What's it all about?

Don't you think it's rather funny
I should be in this position
I'm the one who's always been
So calm, so cool, no lover's fool
Running every show
He scares me so

I never thought I'd come to this
What's it all about?
Yet, if he said he loved me
I'd be lost. I'd be frightened
I couldn't cope, just couldn't cope

I'd turn my head, I'd back away
I wouldn't want to know
He scares me so
I want him so

I love him so","One Night Only [From ""Dream Girls""]",2014

Elaine Paige & Barbara Dickson,"Nothing it so good it lasts eternally.
Perfect situations must go wrong.
But this has never yet prevented me,
Wanting far too much for far too long.

Looking back, I could have played it differently,
Learned about the man before I fell,
But it took time to understand the man,
Now at least I know I know him well.

Wasn't it good
(Oh so good)
Wasn't it fine
(Oh so fine)
Isn't it madness
He can't be mine.
But in the end he needs a little bit more than me
(More security)
He needs his fantasies and freedom
I know him so well.

No one in your life is with you constantly
No one is completely on your side,
And though I move my world to be with him,
Still the gap between him is too much.

Looking back I could have played it differently,
One or a few more who can tell,
But I was ever so much younger then,
Now at least I know I know him well.

Wasn't it good
(Oh so good)
Wasn't it fine
(Oh so fine)

He can't be mine.

Didn't I know,
How it would go from the start If I knew,
Why am I falling apart.

Tryin' to do what those ladies tell us
Get shot down cause ya over-zealous
Play hard to get females get jealous
Okay smarty go to a party
Girls are scantily clad and showin' body
A chick walks by you wish you could sex her
But you're standing on the wall like you was Poindexter
Next days function high class luncheon
Food is served and you're stone-cold munchin'
Music comes on people start to dance
But then you ate so much you nearly split your pants
A girl starts walking guys start gawking
Sits down next to you and starts talking
Says she wants to dance cause she likes to groove
So come on fatso and just bust a move

You're on a mission and your wishin'
Someone could cure your lonely condition
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
No fine girls just ugly faces
From frustration first inclination
Is to become a monk and leave the situation
But every dark tunnel has a light of hope
So don't hang yourself, with a celibate rope
Your movie's showin', so you're goin'
Could care less about the five you're blowin'
Theater gets dark just to start the show
Then ya spot a fine woman sittin' in your row
She's dressed in yellow, she says ""Hello,
come sit next to me you fine fellow.""
You run over there without a second to lose
And what comes next hey bust a move

In this city ladies look pretty
Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty
Tell a funny joke just to get some play
Then you try to make a move and she says, ""No way""
Girls are fakin' goodness sakin'
They want the man who brings home the bacon
Got no money and you got no car
Then you got no women and there you are
Some girls are sadistic, materialistic
Lookin' for a man makes them opportunistic
They're lyin' on a beach perpetrating a tan
So a brother with the money can be their man

In five days from now he's gonna marry
He's hopin' you can make it there if you can
Cause in the ceremony you'll be the best man
You say neat-o, check your libido
And roll to the church in your new tuxedo
The bride walks down just to start the wedding
And there's one more girl you won't be getting
So you start thinkin' then you start blinking
The bridesmaid looks and thinks that you're winking
She thinks your kinda cute so she winks back
And now your feelin' really fine cause the girl is stacked

She turns over and looks to him
She tries to feel, she can't feel anything
But it's so hard to say goodbye
When you know that it's right

So when it's all not what you thought
And a friendship is not enough
When you long to feel alive
And the take the chance to give it up

Is it right or is it wrong?
I can't go on, you can't go on
If you say yes or even no
You don't know how and where to go

Is it right or is it wrong?
I can't go on, you can't go on
If you say yes or even no
You don't know how and where to go

I know it's not easy to decide
To find your own direction
Oh the risk is high
But you can't hide

Is it right? Is it right?

Is it right or is it wrong?
I can't go on, you can't go on
If you say yes or even no
You don't know how and where to go

Maybe break a few hearts and then run

Now that I know I can't beat love

The sweet with the sad

The tears of brine that make love go

So kiss me again, dear

Meet me in the morning, or late at night

When the moon is out or when the sun is high

There'll be no questions, no more lies

Only come with me a while.


Won't you come along my darling, come with me

Come on my darling, run away with me


Though I did deny it, still you know it's true all I ever want is you

I could love the thunder, the lightning and the rain

If you'd be mine again


Won't you come along my darling, come with me

Come on my darling, run away with me


Shadows are falling from a moon so bright

When you're near me all is right

Rivers will ramble, the winds are gonna blow

I wanna take you with me baby when I go


Won't you come along my darling, come with me

Come on my darling, run away with me


Though I did deny it, still you know it's true

All I ever want is you

I'm leaving in the morning, I'm going on my way

Just these words to you I pray


Won't you come along my darling, come with me

Come along my darling, run away with me

Um dia desse 
Eu fui dançar lá em Pedreira 
Na rua da golada 
Gostei da brincadeira 
Zé Caxangá era o tocador 

Mas só tocava pisa na fulô 

Pisa na fulô, pisa na fulô, pisa na fulô 
Não maltrate o meu amor 

Pisa na fulô, pisa na fulô, pisa na fulô 
Não maltrate o meu amor

Que nem tinha doze anos 
Agarrar seu par 
Também sair dançando 
Satisfeita e dizendo 
“Meu amor, ai como é gostoso o pisa no fulô”

Não é choro, é chororô 

Tenho pena de quem chora 
De quem chora tenho dó 
Quando o choro de quem chora 
Não é choro, é chororô 

Quando uma pessoa chora seu choro 
Baixinho 
De lágrima a correr pelo cantinho de olhar 
Não se pode duvidar da razão daquela dor 
Isso pode atrapalhar 
Sentindo seja o que for 
Mas quando a pessoa chora o choro em desatino 
Batendo pino como quem vai se arrebentar 
Aí penso que é melhor ajudar aquela dor 
A encontrar o seu lugar no meio do chororô 

Chororô, chororô, chororô 
É muita água, é mágoa 
É jeito bobo de chorar 

Chororô, chororô, chororô 
É mágoa, é muita água, a gente pode se afogar

Deixei ficar meu coração 
Ai que saudades tenho 
Eu vou voltar pro meu sertão 

No meu roçado 
Eu trabalhava todo dia 
Mas no meu rancho 
Eu tinha tudo o que queria 
Lá se dançava quase toda quinta-feira 
Sanfona não faltava 
E tome xote a noite inteira 

O xote é bom 
De se dançar 
A gente gruda 
Na cabloca sem soltar 
Um passo lá 
Um outro cá

Deus no céu e você aqui
A esperança é quem me abriga
Esses campos não tardam em florir
Já se espera uma boa colheita
E tudo parece seguir
Fazendo a vida tão direita

El sueño y poder dormirme

Yo estoy muy triste
Que cuando llega la noche
Yo estoy muy triste

Nowhere in the suburbs
In the cold light of day

Looking for mercy
In your daddy's arms again

'Swear they moved that sign
Looking for mercy
In your daddy's arms

Tugging at the darkness, word upon word
Confessing all the secret things in the warm velvet box
To the priest, he's the doctor
He can handle the shocks
Dreaming of the tenderness, the tremble in the hips
Of kissing Mary's lips

Wear your inside out
Dreaming of mercy

'Swear they moved that sign

Fights break out when you wired and start joking
A lot of OG's retired and started smokin'
House party games of spade sweet kool-aid
Loud music all night till the boys in blue raid
So therefore I could never be too paid
I know where I'm going and where I'm from will get you laid

All the money in the world couldn't change me
No diamond rings or them fancy cars
Cause my niggas in the hood woulda let me
Holler this because
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto
(I'm from the projects) I'm from the projects
All over the world and every hood they know
I'm from the ghetto and that's fo sho'

Haha
Tell me this how come
Black folks get a little doe
And forget where they come from
Man we used to have good times
But since you moved on up you ain't cool with us
We still support you tho we don't see you much
You ain't the first fool its cool with us
But why you living out your idols dreams
Remember how for you came and help you keep those thangs
Now its cool that your address changed
But I'm tryna holla at my dog and the number ain't the same
I guess new homies came with his fame
But see true homies will stay the same
Through all the up's and down's in your career
A couple wives few kids scattered here
And when you dead or broke without a deal
All the groupies cleared
The ghetto will still be here

All the money in the world couldn't change me
No diamond rings or them fancy cars

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions

Now this gon' be the hardest thing I think I ever had to do
Got me talkin' to myself askin' how I'm gon' tell you 'bout that chick on part one
I told y'abgvll I was sleepin' with, creepin' with
Say she's three months pregnant and she's keepin' it
The first thing that came to mind was you
Second thing was how do I know if it's mine and is it true
Third thing was me wishin' that I never did what I did
How I ain't ready for no kid and bye bye to our relationship

But to give you part two of my confessions

See when this stuff goes through be trying to figure out
When, what, and how I'ma let this come out of my mouth
Said it ain't gon' be easy
But I need to stop thinkin', contemplatin'
Be a man and get it over with (over with)
I'm ridin' in my whip
Racin' to her place
Talkin' to myself
Preparin' to tell her to her face
She open up the door and didn't want to come near me
Y'all why? Tell me baby?
Please hear me

This by far is the hardest thing I think I've ever had to do
To tell you, the woman I love
That I'm having a baby by a woman that I barely even know
I hope you can accept the fact that I'm man enough to tell you this
And hopefully you'll give me another chance
This ain't about my career
This ain't about my life
It's about us

Eleanor McEvoy,"All my arguments sound pretty weak
So I'll be quick and concede defeat
All the evidence lies on your side
So I'll come clean and say that I lied
I guess it's OK if I'm hated and damned
But don't go away thinking I had it planned
It wasn't part of my scheme to be hateful to you

Did I hurt you?
What can I say?
I am guilty
Of walking away
And the signals that I sent you
I never meant to
Did I hurt you?
Forgive me please
I am guilty
I let you believe
That I loved you
And I tried to
Still you were lied to

Believe me please when I say
Sometimes our hearts can lead us astray
Believe me I never knew
How much of a hold I had over you
And try if you can to let reason be heard
Don't let your anger be blind to my words
Don't cut me off if I try and explain it to you.
Did I hurt you?

No spotlight no acclaim

For all your little games

And then come passing through

Never did take much to get me thinking about him anyway
In time I may progress to welcoming the coffee`s scent

Then I would welcome rain and never let it bother me
From my windowsill I`d watch the drops and then begin
To picture him soaked to the skin.

Acting out their fairytales in play
Children play, growing with the noise

You read the papers, saying the fire will not spread

Before you're happy, having locked your doors at night

Twelve days heat would melt the snow on the ground

Go and wait for the sun

When dreams have been a thorny crown
It's not so sad when they're tumblin' down

Just one more night of holding you

Comfort from you

Does it run so deep?
Is it so forgotten

I feel...

To hanging plants behind
Particles of honesty
And tenderness entwined
Things with you are different now
And I can feel the strain
What is it that protects you from this pain?

With the days that lie ahead me
I'm hungry to remain
Still, I know it's best to go

He comes to chase the midnight blues away
He's sweet to taste and strong to touch
And with his second sight
He steals away the lonesomeness of night

It seems that heaven's looked on me and smiled
It sent the sun in place of candlelight
Tumbled out my wildest dreams
Tossed away my worst
Has heaven sent a blessing or a curse?

He talks to me, but nothing does he tell
He talks but keeps his secret safe and well
Still, I cannot help but reach for him
With these helpless hands of mine
So, I hug him close and pray to God he's mine

He comes to me and sets my thoughts astray

And yet you'll never know the thrill of loving you.",Poor You,1999

If you want to roll and roll those lucky dice
If you want to spend your journey's end with sweet music and love
If you want to lick this world of men and Mickey Mice

Look over yourself and say
""You're very good""

When you have such success
You're conscious that you impress
The neighbourhood
Ra-ap tap on wood

Is made of milk and honey
When every stock you take
Is making mints of money
When every heart you break
Is such a cinch, it's funny
Careful, Sonny

Eleanor Riley,"Why me Lord, what have I ever done
To deserve even one
Of the pleasures I've known
Tell me Lord, what did I ever do
That was worth loving you
Or the kindness you've shown.

Lord help me Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've need you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand.

Tell me Lord, if you think there's a way
I can try to repay
All I've taken from you
Maybe Lord, I can show someone else
What I've been through myself
On my way back to you.

Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've need you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand.",Why Me Lord?,2004
Eleanor Shanley,"Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
While we all sup sorrow with the poor.
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
Oh, hard times, come again no more

'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary.
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
Many days you have lingered all around my door.
Oh, hard times, come again no more.

While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay.
There are frail forms fainting at the door
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
Oh, hard times, come again no more.

'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary.
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
Many days you have lingered all around my door.
Oh, hard times, come again no more.

There's a pale drooping maiden who foils her life away
With a worn out heart, whose better days are o'er.
Though her voice it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
Oh, hard times, come again no more.

'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary.
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
Many days you have lingered all around my door.
Oh, hard times, come again no more.

Hard times, hard times, come again no more.

Eleanor Whitmore,"Sometime my baby locks me out
Stomps her feet, screams and shouts
I know what that’s all about
My baby’s just as mean as me

Sometimes my man don’t treat me right
Shame the way we fuss and fight
But I give as good as get alright
My baby’s just as mean as me

He’s kinda loud and rough
Drinks wine and all that stuff
Sometimes I’ve had enough, then he smiles
And I reckon I can stay for a while

They say that love is blind
Especially the passionate kind
I don’t have to apologize
My baby’s just as mean as me

Hard times they come and go
She’s mine and I’m her beau
He finds some scars to show, never mind
'Cause they ain't no different than mind

You heard them say that love is blind
Especially the passionate kind
I don’t have to apologize

Elecktra,"Sitting out here on the hood of this truck looking up
At a caramel colored sunset sky
Checking my watch doing the math in my head
Counting back words to when you said goodbye
Well those runway lights are getting brighter

I'm just sitting out here watching airplanes
Take off and fly
Trying to figure out which one you might be on
And why you don't love me anymore
Right now I'm sitting out here watching airplanes

I would've lied could've cried should've tried harder
Done anything to make you stay
I wonder what you'd do if you looked out your window
Saw me running down the runway just like I was crazy
That fence is too high so am I

So I'm just sitting out here watching airplanes
Take off and fly
Trying to figure out which one you might be on
And why you don't love me anymore
By now I know you're thirty thousand feet above me
But a million miles away, a million miles away
By now I know I ought to act like you don't love me

I'm just sitting out here watching airplanes
Take off and fly
Trying to figure out which one you might be on
And why you don't love me anymore
Right now I'm sitting out here watching airplanes

Yeah I'm just sitting out here watching airplanes

Como aquel que en soñar gusto recibe,
Su gusto procediendo de locura,
Así el imaginar con su figuravanamente su gozo en mí concibe.

Otro bien en mí, triste, no se escribe,
Si no es aquel que en mi pensar procura;
De cuanto ha sido hecho en mi ventura
Lo sólo imaginado es lo que vive.

Teme mi corazón de ir adelante,
Viendo estar su dolor puesto en celada;
Why así revuelve atrás en un instante

a contemplar su gloria ya pasada.

I took a shot of cocaine and shot my woman down
I went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that lovin' forty-four beneath my head.

Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez Mexico.

Laid in the hot joint takin' the pill
In walked a sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down.

I said yes sir my name is Willie Lee
If you've got a warrant just read it to me
Shot her down cause she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more.

When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They put me on a train and they took me back
Had no friends for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in the county jail.

Early next morning about a half past nine
I spied a sheriff comin' down the line
Coughed and coughed as he cleared his throat
He said come on you dirty hack into that district court

Into the court room my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that little judge commence to look about.

In about five minutes in walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read in the first degree	
I hollered Lordy Lordy have mercy on me

The judge he smiled as he picked up his pen
Ninety nine years in the Folsom pen
Ninety nine years underneath that ground
I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down
Come on you gotta listen unto me
Lay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be",Cocaine Blues,2004

We fell from grace and were cast out of Heaven?
Our paradise denied
God-forsaken for the sin of pride
The chosen few, the tribes of Cain
We built an empire of chaos and pain
A dark labyrinth of corruption and disease
But I'd rather rot in Hell than live on my knees!!!

Do you remember when...
The world fell to ruin at the hands of evil men?
A new regime with a single cause:
To establish pleasure as the only law
Every man and woman a slave,
Arenas wet with the blood they gave
We slaughtered millions just to watch them die
Then we piled all the corpses up until they reached the sky.

NOOOOooooooooooo!!!!!!
We lost our faith,
We fell from grace
And if I ever see your God again I'll spit in his face
Burning in Hell...we were left to die
But now the fire's in our hearts and someday we'll
COME ALIVE!...inside of our prison cells and
CRAWL! CRAWL! CRAWL!...up from the the depths of hell and
RISE! RISE! RISE!...back to power 'til we
FALL! FALL! FALL!...from grace again!!!

We will build a new paradise

And I've traveled many days to reach this place to mke my stand, 
I fell in with a merry band, and drank away the hours.

Rollin' on, I've been rollin' on, 
And my head is high, from the battle won, 
Laid down my life for the Greenwood

The city boys, and the country boys, they come from miles around, 
To defy their king and country, save the poor folks from the hand, 
Of the thieving dukes and abbotts, and the gentry of the land.

Rollin' on, I've been rollin' on, 
And my head is high, from the battle won, 
Laid down my life for the Greenwood

Stay on the right side, the Greenwood is your home, 
The dancing girls and the open fires, the wine that flows like water.

A smile for everyone under God's grace

Leaves the world, her life to start somewhere

I see you cryin' now you've found a lot of pain,
And what you're searchin' for can never be the same,
But what's the difference cos' they say what's in a name.
And I see you midnight blue.

I will love you tonight,and I will stay
By your side,lovin' you, I'm feelin' midnight blue.

I see you standing there far out along the way,
I want to touch you but the night becomes the day,
I count the words that I am never gonna say
And I see you midnight blue.

I will love you tonight,and I will stay
By your side,lovin' you, I'm feelin' midnight blue.

Can't you feel the love that I'm offering you,
Can't you see how it's meant to be,
Can't you hear the words that I'm saying to you,
Can't you believe like I believe,
It's only one and one it's true
Still I see you midnight blue.

I see beautiful days and I feel beautiful ways
Of loving you,everything's midnight blue.

I will love you tonight,and I will stay
By your side,lovin' you, I'm feelin' midnight blue.",Midnight Blue,1979

She tells me that she needs me,she tells me that she's glad,
And if she goes away, I'm like someone who's left out in the rain,
I need, I need her, I need her love.

She came in from the west, a summer breeze I couldn't rest,
I had to take a fast train, to be there by her side,
She made me feel so good, she made it like it should be all the time
I need, I need her, I need her love.

Just when I was thinkin' of her, she came along and made me
want her. I need her love, I need her love, I need her love.

If she goes away, I'm like someone who's left out in the rain,
I need, I need her, I need her love.

The boats that sail, the planes that fly,she is with me.
I wonder if she wonders, if this is all for real,
I couldn't stand to see her cry because of me, that would be sad.
I need, I need her, I need her love.

She tells me everything, she makes me smile, she tries to sing,
But never shares her suffering, if things are going wrong,
She makes it like a dream, if things are as they seem the
world is good. I need her love, I need her love, I need her love.

Across the night I saw your face 
You disappeared without a trace 
You brought me here, but can you take me back

Inside the image of your light 
That now is day and once was night 
You lead me here and then you go away.

Twilight, I only meant to stay awhile 
Twilight, I gave you time to steal my mind 
Away from me.

You brought me here, but can you take me back again?

With your head held high and your scarlet lies 
You came down to me from the open skies
It's either real or it's a dream
There's nothing that is in between

Twilight, I only meant to stay awhile 
Twilight, I gave you time to steal my mind 
Away from me.

Electric Light Orchestra,"Well, I came a long way to be here today 
And I left you so long on this avenue 
And here I stand in the strangest land 
Not knowing what to say or do 
As I gaze around at these strangers in town 
I guess the only stranger is me 
And I wonder, yes I wonder 
Is this the way life's meant to be

Although it's only a day since I was taken away 
And left standing here looking in wonder 
The ground at my feet, maybe it's just the old street 
But everything that I know lies under 
And when I see what they've done to this place that 
was home 
Shame is all that I feel 
And I wonder, yes I wonder, is this
The way life's meant to be

Too late, too late to cry 
The people say 
Too late for you, too late for me 
You've come so far, now you know everything 
My friend 
Just look and see the wonders of our world

As I wander around this wreck of a town 
Where people never speak aloud 
With its ivory towers and its plastic flowers 
I wish I was back in 1981 
Just to see your face instead of this place 
Now I know what you mean to me 
And I wonder, yes, I wonder, is this 
The way life's meant to be.

Electric Light Orchestra,"I sent a message to another time,
But as the days unwind, this I just can't believe,
I send a note across another plane,
Maybe it's all a game, but this I just can't conceive

I drive the very latest Hover car,
I don't know where you are 
But I miss you so much till then,
I met someone who looks a lot like you,
She does the things you do,but she is an IBM

She's only programmed to be very nice,
But she's as cold as ice, whenever I get too near,
She tells me that she likes me very much,
But when I try to touch, she makes it all too clear.

She is the latest in technology,
Almost mythology, but she has a heart of stone,
She has an IQ of 1,001,
She has a jump suit on,and she's also a telephone.

   Chorus

 Is that what you want - is it what you really want.

I realize that it must seem to strange,
That time haz rearranged,but time haz the final word
She knows I think of you,she reads my mind,
She tries to be unkind,she knows nothing of your world

Although her memory banks overflow
No one would ever know,all she says is that what you want
Maybe one day I'll feel her cold embrace,
And kiss her interface,until then I'll leave her alone.

And the way she looks, if looks could kill they might

Look through a window and you'll see her standing there
She's the latest of the greatest with the wind blowin' in her hair
The prima donna she's back in town
And you see her for miles around
So believe what they say there's danger in the air

Beware there's danger ahead
The endless summer is dead
Look out there's danger ahead

Monday mornin' she's already up and gone
She knows what she wants and she knew it all along
With her entourage on either side
Just one look she can't be denied
So believe what they say there's danger in the air

Beware there's danger ahead
The endless summer is dead
Look out there's danger ahead

She's got a reputation that's way ahead of her time
She's got adulation that's way ahead of her mind
Everybody runs around to please

Then out into the night I creep
No one can see me now
Or hear me running, soundlessly

The moon`s the only light I need
To search for food, young ones to feed
But as the dawn is drawing near the earth, my way`s not clear
I`m trapped on the outside

Moonlight save me, moonlight save me
Moonlight save me, moonlight save me

Unearthly fear, it grips my skin
Unearthly sound, the hunt begins
I hear excited cries
But dare not look from where I`m hiding

The multi-coloured humans ride
Soon they will find me where I hide
The brown and white tormentors
Begin to howl and then I`m running

Moonlight save me
I cut across the trail I left five miles before
One chance to throw them off my scent but I`m not sure
An elder told me it had worked sometime before

My heart is beating like a drum
I make the ridge, but can`t go on
I turn to face my death
But nothing comes to stop me breathing

Daughter of your dream shine a guiding light for me
For I'll be here till light

Till she has forgiven me

Night turns into gold
So the tide may turn today
Though God gave the world
It's not mine to throw away

What will I find

Taking grey clouds from your door
Face the midnight sun
You have something to live for

Electric Light Orchestra,"The iceman came to me tonight
So very near but out of sight
I heard the footsteps in the hall
And I heard a cold voice call
It's such a lonely world

Then I knew that you were gone
It came to me, I was alone
Now I'm left out in the cold
But the story's far from told
It's such a lonely world

It's like Latitude 88 North
It's so cold, cold as hell
35 below and falling
How I wish that she was calling me

Frozen shadows in the doorways
They will linger there always
And as the dawn begins to break
She's gone it's hard to take
It's such a lonely world

It's like Latitude 88 North
It's so cold, cold as hell
35 below and falling
How I wish that she was calling me

Electric Light Orchestra,"They used to tell me boy you ain't goin' nowhere
With your cheap guitar and your big long hair
You gotta realize all your responsibilities
You gotta get out to work and face reality

You gotta get up in the morning take your heavy load
And you gotta keep goin' down the long black road

So I drifted for a while down the road to ruin
I couldn't find my way I didn't know what I was doin'
I saw a lot of people coming back the other way
So I kept on goin' when I heard them say

""You gotta get up in the morning take your heavy load
And you gotta keep goin' down the long black road""

I made a lot of money I was makin' quite a mess
But they all told me money wouldn't bring me happiness
""You gotta work like a man in a real man's life
You're gonna have to take all the trouble and strife""

You gotta get up in the morning take your heavy load
And you gotta keep goin' down the long black road",Long Black Road,2013
Electric Light Orchestra,"In this life I've seen everything I can see woman
I've seen lovers flying through the air hand in hand
I've seen babies dancing in the midnight sun
And I've seen dreams that came from the heavenly skies above
I've seen old men crying at their own grave sides
And I've seen pigs all sitting watching, picture slides
But I never seen nothing like you

[Chorus:]
Do ya do ya want my love
Do ya do ya want my face
Do ya do ya want my mind
Do ya do ya want my love

Well I, heard the crowd singin' out of tune
As they, sat and sang Auld Lang Syne by the light of the moon
I heard the preachers bangin' on the drums,
And I heard the police playin' with their guns
But I never heard nothin' like you

In the country where the sky touches down
On the field, she lay her down to rest
In the morning sun
They come a'runnin' just to get a look, just to
Feel to touch her long black hair they don't give a damn

[Chorus:]

Well I think you know what I'm trying to say woman
That is I'd like to save you for a rainy day
I've seen enough of the world to know
That I've got to get it all to get it all to grow

"Electric Light Orchestra, Part II","I've had enough of forever being told what to say and do
I've had enough
I've had enough being always pushed around by the likes of you
I'm making some plans of my own now
And you know what you can do

I'm so tired
Tired of the man giving me such a hard, hard time
I'm so tired
You make a man work so hard every day,
Don't you know it's a crime
Always got to hit the deadline
When will i ever get some peace of mind
I'll find a girl that's rich and pretty
I'll get myself the key to the big city
Find a way to make some money
Move into the land of milk and honey
Everything's sweet and life's a treat
Feel the heat on easy street

I'm movin' on
Movin' on to a place that i see all the time in my dreams
I'm movin' on
Gone, gone, gone from the misery

I've taken all that i can now
Gonna take my time on easy street

"Electric Light Orchestra, Part II","I've got rocket for your parade
Heavy breathing for you made in the shade
I've got an itch that just won't quit
I see you wear the dress that just don't fit
I see you walking with that two bit boy
I see you laughing but I'm no toy

I know what you do every night, every night
I know what you do when you turn out the light
I see what you do every night, every night
And I want you to do it to me

You learned that jive on MTV
That mumbo jumbo just don't work on me
Slam bang, baby, ala kazaam
Don't disrespect me I'm a stand-up man
I see you laughing when you slam the door
I see you with him, I can't take any more

I know what you do every night, every night
I know what you do when you turn out the light
I see what you do every night, every night
And I want you to do it to me

Come to your senses, baby, don't hold out
Someday you'll want me, don't act so proud
We've got a mutual circumstance
Come on, hold on, give me a chance

I see you laughing when you slam the door
I see you with him, I can't take any more

I know what you do every night, every night
I know what you do when you turn out the light
I see what you do every night, every night

"Electric Light Orchestra, Part II","No one could say
How she caught my eyes
To this day,
I don't know why
Oh well her eyes
So much like diamonds,
And her heart
So much like gold
I knew that i'd
Win her in time,
When i felt her heart
Beat close to mine
And once in her arms,
Then i knew anything i would do,
Just for the love of a woman,
Just for the love of a woman
I prayed that i'd never have to walk alone
I'd have a love of my own
I thank my stars,
I found an angel
Never again
Will i walk alone
She brought a light
Into my heart,
Like the brightest star,
That's ever shone

Money and gold

To a king,
When you're alone,
Don't mean a thing
And once in her arms
Then i know anything i would do,
Just for the love of a woman,
Just for the love of a woman,
I prayed that i'd never have to walk alone.

Now i have a love of my own
I could paint a masterpiece,
I could walk through fire
I could shout it from the roof,
From the smallest flame to a fire this love has grown,
Just for the love of a woman,
Money and gold mean nothing
Never again will i have to walk alone,
Now i have a love of my own

Love of my own, love of my own
I can't face this world all alone
