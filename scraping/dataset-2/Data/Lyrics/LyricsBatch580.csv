And my heart was beating fast.
I began to lose control, 
I began to lose control.
I didn't mean to hurt you. 
I'm sorry that I made you cry.
Oh no, I didn't mean to hurt you. 
I'm just a jealous guy.

I was feeling insecure you might not love me anymore.
I was shivering inside, 
I was shivering inside.
I didn't mean...

I was trying to catch your eyes, 
though that you was trying to hide.
I was swallowing my pain, 
I was swallowing my pain.
I didn't mean...",Jealous Guy,2000

When will those dark clouds all disappear
Angie, Angie
Where will it lead us from here
With no lovin' in our souls
And no money in our coats
You can't say we're satisfied
Angie, Angie

You can't say we never tried
Angie, you're beautiful
But ain't it time we say goodbye
Angie, I still love you
Remember all those nights we cried
All the dreams were held so close
Seemed to all go up in smoke
Let me whisper in your ear
Angie, Angie

Where will it lead us from here
Oh, Angie, don't you wish
Oh your kisses still taste sweet
I hate that sadness in your eyes
But Angie
Angie
Ain't it time we said goodbye

With no lovin' in our souls
And no money in our coats
You can't say we're satisfied
Angie, I still love you baby
Everywhere I look I see your eyes
There ain't a woman that comes close to you
Come on baby dry your eyes
Angie, Angie ain't good to be alive

[Kurupt]
Now follow me deep in the depths of my mind
Thinking many plots blossoms how amny times?
I'm sedated my ""conscriptiated"" from beginning 
Broke in the bombest weed smoke that will make a nigga choke
To my locs way down in the Valley deep
To my homies in the Pound from L-ong Beach
To my bulls out in Philly cause all they smoke is phillies
Wit' these silly ass bitches out for a niggas riches
Now really really ever slip or trip
A big shout out to my niggas in Darby tip
I spits the vocabulary to sinks MC's like ships
With my nocturnal rhymes and editorial clips
I gotta click that'll hit you like a thousand volts
The homies catching cases,robberies and assaults
It ain't my fault that my shit might hit like that
Listen in,get elevated off the verbal contact

[Daz]
When a nigga gotta strive for his he can't stop
Gotta get somewhere
When a nigga gotta mash for his he can't stop
Gotta get somewhere

[Daz & Bad Azz]
My mind-state these days make the average nigga afraid
Hurt em in the worst way,put it down for myself
Put em to rest,confess nevertheless
Snatch em a cap and destroy em at my best
For the simple fact that with contact we the block entourage
We drop bombs and we known to calm down the savage beast
And the rest of the jungle,while mistreat
Any MC trying to fuck with D-A-Z
I represent it to the fullest,it could be a verbal massacre
In '96,with a different approach I'm shit
I got the flavor and I'm major,bust the ass
Niggas can't stop us and can't fade us
Shady ass niggas can't stand next to ya
When the Tek connects to ya,swift as a cheetah when I'm catchin ya
I bet ya I won't let ya escape
Face-to-real on point-to-train-to kill beyond the violated area
When the smoke clears the area,rather we toast
So at home I blaze the zag or the bone
Once again another zone is gone
MCs try to step they get lit and blown

At the end the lights go out so before they do
I'm a L-B-C on through, staying true
Demanding my respect, respect is what I've given
So respect is what I expect,the money got me driven
To the point of no return so the streets I roam
Don't catch chrome to the dome of this flack black
.45 calibre Glock, gat, gun or pistol
Whistle and watch all my homeboys come run
Or hear the click,damn that shit that you get hit with
When we bust I let loose,this is pre-meditated dick-up
To all the busters that jealous and hate it but can't fade it
With the every attempt they fail,oh well
Consequences get suffered,I put pressure on sucker motherfuckers
The bill is crisp,(the deal is )the deal is this-
I gotta plot em on a mash for my chips
Get in my way and get stepped on
I'm stomping, stepping with my projectile weapon

Whats up ""Jex"" so's eject the hum
When I swarm through,who knew about the real deal I conceal?
But still can you feel the topic of the whole situation is trust
No ho is a must!If I bust
My brain constructs to form knowledge to the max
Defeating and deleting elevation set backs
We wax tracks and smack up MC's who compose the violence
Bringing drama with no parental guidance
Eyes went deceived, something up my sleeve to intrigue
And these MCs will be Gs also D-P-Gs and L-B-Cs 
When we do the do to you so go call your crew
And who wants to compete with technique
Conflict will be verbal so watch how you speak
And what you say when I display
Sleepless acts as ""bombing ya"",suffer from insomnia
And I'm a gonna be coming for you
So please be on the lookout for the Doggystyle Crew

Josey Wales was known for robbing trains and things
Laying everybody down for diamond rings and chains
It remains the same in the year you live in, see
Cause if I pull out some heat, nigga, you'll go kick in
And that's just the rules set by the fool from the ol' school
When it's time to duel, you get two men
Two heaters, one street, one clock
And when it strike twelve one of y'all gon' drop
If you're quick on the draw you're gon' see the morgue
But if you're too slow
I catch you on the downlow (Oh no)
Oh no, you mean The Kid, shit's real
I ain't no John Wayne, these niggas gang-bang
The Four Horsemen, that's the click I'm wit
You mean the little bitty niggas with the itchy trigger fingers
Yeah, we're on a mission ta Kansas, slipping through Texas
We stopped at Bonanza to get us some hot cakes
Bacon and eggs, and then we slip in the whorehouse to get us some leg
Hop back on the horses, enforcers of courses
The niggas in black, the fearless Four Horsemen
Searching for this location on the map
The gold rush, baby, got ta have it (I gots ta have it)
It feels just like it's 1865
And a trigger look-a-day is how I ride

[Kurupt]
On and on and on it's more strange
Time to heat, shooting range
Quick with the heat on their hip
Young Jesse James come to test your aim
I seen you at the Wild Horny Corral
I heard of ya name
Tha forcify, nigga you ain't never lie
Besides I'm in the mood so at high noon we ride
From coast to coast, niggas mash on every stage coach
My disciples with rifles lethal in whole posts
The off-the-rocker roller coaster
On a six-shooter holster
With DPG on every Wanted poster
Let me think about which bank to gank
Which fellow ta shoot and which teller to shank
I want all the shit you got in stacks
Attached to this skirt in the corner
So I snatched the bitch in the back
The Dogg in me feels for the lust
But the hogg in me makes me want to bust
Back to the drawing down board
Nowadays we drawn down more
To survive through all the round wards
Battle up or saddle up and shake the scene
Or get'cha pockets shaken, clean the slugs in ya spleen
I can't help it, I'm heartless, ya can't hack it
With my six-shooters on my hips and dusty jacket
Like that cock back
Quick to pull my strap
Just to put the Horsemen on the map
(The gold rush)

[LBC Crew]
Born is Doggystyle, individual, James got the hots
I got the six shots for all the plans and plots
I got's lots o' cash stashed in money bags
Worthy workers for all the Russian blabbermouths and gags
I got stacks so my stacks excel
Hop in the coach wit my twelve Clydesdales and bells
I'm on the move, smooth, to my decoy horse
A 30-30 on my side to shoot a nigga o' course
It ain't no stopping young Josey
Box all the nosey
Headed to the saloon with my platoon where all the hos be
Left a dusty trail, bailed in swell
Gold spurs on the Gators, set back the clientele
Oh well, for the recop I drop my bet
Divide between my homies and ride the sunset

[Bad Azz]
Two sacks o' money from the train heist
They ain't even counted it up
Just mounted it up
Rode west toward the coaster, six-shooters in the holster
Pass through a run-down town whose walls hold my poster
Closer I get ta death which is every second makes me sweat
So I gotta have what I can get
Heard word about the gold rush and headed West
On my white horsey with three straps in my knapsack
Giddy up, the next town I rode through
I had to threaten to blow their city up
Undebts with Chief Black, caught five miles west
Sell us some beads and hail us some weed
He offered me a toke
He didn't have a 20 he had they beads-pipe smoke
I almost choked
Break him for the get, right, I'm off into the sunset
Trying ta reach my destiny fast
It's these two bags o' cash
44's cocked I ain't making no mo' stops
Till I hit the spot, I made it twelve on the dot
I slid off my boots, counted my loot
Five minutes after the strike of midnight
I counted 200 Gs, I cocked my strap and slept tight

Non ci son segreti nelle sfere trasparenti
Si specchiano nell'aria si contagiano la gioia
Limpidi e sereni volano I pensieri
Le donne e le cicale discorrono d'amore.
Le case di cristallo si muovono col vento
Scorrono le valli, rimbalzano sul mare
Ruotano leggere nel sorvolare I monti
Lasciano una scia come una cometa.
Quando cala il sole il vento si riposa
Si fermano le sfere e formano un villaggio
La gente si ritrova e si corre incontro
Per un'altra festa mentre muore il giorno.
",Felona,1973

Posi il tuo velo sulla cittÃ  ,
Il deserto la tua culla
Non conosco la tua etÃ  .
Porti il ricordo di antici pionieri
Spinti da un sogno di libertÃ  .
Hai disperso I loro canti
Li hai guidati verso il mare
A una nuova realtÃ .

Mi son svegliato all'improvviso
Con tanto freddo intorno
Guardo se see'è il sole.
Ma che cosa mi succede
Ho un gran buco qui sul petto.
Cerco di uscire dalla stanza
Ma la mia porta è chiusa
Non posso più volare.
Cosa è cambiato questa notte
Se ho voluto star con lei?.
Storia o leggenda dammi la chiave
Flauti incantati devo seguire
Mentre sognavo un'altalena
Oggi qualcuno mi ha preso il cuore.
Scende la sera breve
Quante finestre già si chiudono
Torna più grigio il fiume
Forse una perla rester& sospesa.
....................................
Mi son svegliato all'improvviso
Con tanto freddo intorno .
",Storia o Leggenda,1977
Le Orme,"Poiché riconosco la tua canzone e il disegno sul tuo telaio
A te rivolgo, dolce Calipso, questo mio pensiero,
Non sono un'austera divinità, ma solo un uomo che sta seguendo la via
Illuminata dalla tua immensa statua.
Dona libertà per il tuo amato eroe accolto e poi nutrito
Ora è molto triste, sai, rivuole la sua terra
Anche se la notte era tanto calda sotto la bandiera di stelle.
Ora una barca ha costruito sotto il sole rosso e spietato
Ha innalzato la bianca vela e aspetta sereno
Il tuo soffio di vento.
Dona libertà per il tuo amato eroe, amico dei tuoi sogni,
Ora si è svegliato, sai, non può aspettare il giorno,
Anche se la notte era tanto calda sotto la bandiera di stelle.
",Calipso,1979
Le Orme,"L'acqua più fresca dal nulla ne scaturì
Il sole si nascose, dal cielo scese il pane
E ritornò la quiete fra la gente.
Un altro mistero si aggiunge ai miei ""perché?"".
Oggi si scava il sogno sulla rovente sabbia
E il fiume sudore disseta radici nuove,
Fugge il miraggio e un Paradiso già si rivela,
Il fiore d'arancio profuma così il deserto.
Occhi che fissano il vuoto rimpiangono
Figli lontani dispersi nelle città.
Nella mia terra I vecchi ulivi stanno pregando
Stringono in pugno collane di perle nere;
La frutta dorata che il sole dona come rugiada
Semina rabbia, nei fossi sacrificata.
",Jaffa,1979
Le Orme,"Ho conosciuto un mago che sa guarire qualunque male,
Può salvarti dal malocchio e scacciare via l'invidia
Spia I pianeti in cielo e ti gestisce l'avvenire
Imprigiona il mal d'amore con ricette collaudate.
Sempre compiacente ti invita al suo banchetto
Ma fattura I cibi e le bevande
Quali sorprese ancora ci offrirà il futuro?
""Sono buone le noccioline? Sono buone le noccioline?""
Cogli il presagio Circe, le tue magie son superate
Perché hai messo in piedi I porci se gustavano le ghiande.
Segui il nuovo incanto, la pace regna in tutto il mondo
Quale magico potere ha un sorriso affascinante.
Senza trasformazioni vivrà la nuova arte
E nessuno saprà mai chi siamo.
Quali sorprese ancora ci offrirà il futuro?
",Il Mago,1979
Le Orme,"Tace il mare nel mistero, più non vende I suoi tesori,
Che cosa hai fatto, mio vecchio Pietro, in questo lungo inverno?
Forse son le tue reti corrose dal tempo e più non conosci I giochi dei =
Venti?
Quando una nuova alba il gallo annuncerà le chiavi perderai.
Sentile queste voci, da lontano giungono,
Sacre montagne e larghi fiumi ora attraversano,
Fermo sulla scogliera rimani inerte
A contemplare un altro tramonto
Mentre l'eco libera nei canti della sera le nuove verità.
",Pietro il Pescatore,1979

Amore mio, scrivo per te una canzone
Lascio I problemi un momento
Voglio pensare un po' a te.
Ora sei tu l'unica cosa importante
L'unico vero messaggio
Che la mia mente rincorre.
Sta girando il sole intorno a noi
Senti il mondo che non grida più
Ora ascolta le mie parole
Fai posare la mente stanca
Questo fragile amore folle
È tutto quel che hai
Tienlo caro.

Colgo il tuo sguardo e lo stringo nelle mani.
See'è nei tuoi occhi una paura antica;
Sogni di cenere s'infiammano ora in te.
Quando I timori si dissolvono tu credi in me.
Una luce che ti abbaglia,
La purezza nello specchio e tu
Ti avvicini a me.
Piange il cielo sopra I vetri;
La tempesta è nel tuo cuore e tu
Tremi accanto a me.
Colgo il tuo sguardo e lo stringo nelle mani;
See'è nei tuoi occhi una dolcezza nuova,
Nuova per te.
",Una Dolcezza Nuova,1994
Le Orme,"(A. Pagliuca - A. Tagliapietra)
In un mondo strano tutto tuo
Fatto di figure di cartone
E di tante bambola di stoffa, vivi tu
Vivi chiusa in quelle quattro mura ;
Non ricordi chi ti ci ha portato
E conosci solo chi ora gioca con te.
Tu non hai le ansie del futuro
Per te il tempo non ha più valore,
Ciò che hai fatto ieri tu domani rifarai.
E nei tuoi sogni
Parli con gli angeli.
In un cerchio chiuso di pazzia
Hai perduto la tua giovinezza
Come un fiore tolto dal ramo a primavera.
Dai un nome a tutte le farfalle
E confessi al vento I tuoi amori.
Danzi sola nei corridoi vuoti quando è sera.
Stringi forte al petto il tuo cuscino
E sul muro bianco si disegna
Il profilo di una donna con il suo bambino.
E cosi... felice ti addormenti.
",Figure Di Cartone,1994
Le Orme,"Il lungo viaggio che hai fatto è terminato qui
Dal tuo sonno ora ti dovrai svegliare.
Io ti lascio al tuo destino, non ti servo più,
La mia nave ha invertito la sua rotta.
Smetti di sognare, amico,
E ricorda che domani è già oggi, per questo io ti dico:
Cambia, Mister Tambourine Man, a me non servi più,
La tua nave magica è un relitto ormai.
Lascia il tuo tamburo e vai in cerca di altri suoni
Le tue ombre inutili nessuno segue più.
La nuova strada è già tracciata e la percorrerò
Più sicuri sono ora I passi miei.
Le risate verso il sole
Ora fanno solamente paura, per questo io ti dico:
Cambia, Mister Tambourine Man, a me non servi più,
La tua nave magica è un relitto ormai.
Lascia il tuo tamburo e vai in cerca di altri suoni

Le Orme,"(A. Pagliuca - A. Tagliapietra)
Come d'incanto lei si alza di notte ,
Cammina in silenzio con gli occhi ancor chiusi
Come seguisse un magico canto
E sull' altalena ritorna a sognare .
La lunga vestaglia , il volto di latte ,
I raggi di luna sui folti capelli .
La statua di cera s'allunga tra I fiori ,
Folletti gelosi la stanno a spiare .
Dondola , dondola il vento la spinge ,
Cattura le stelle per I suoi desideri .
Un' ombra furtiva si staccca dal muro :
Nel gioco di bimba si perde una donna .
Un grido al mattino in mezzo alla strada ,
Un uomo di pezza invoca il suo sarto
Con voce smarrita per sempre ripete :
"" io non volevo svegliarla così ""
"" io non volevo svegliarla così ! ""
",Gioco Di Bimba,1994
Le Orme,"(A. Pagliuca - A. Tagliapietra)
La gioia di cantare , la voglia di suonare
Il senso di raggiungere quello che non hai
Ecco un altro giorno come ieri ,
Aspettare il mattino per ricominciare .
La forza di sorridere , la forza di lottare
La colpa d' esser vivo e non poter cambiare
Come un ramo secco , abbandonato
Che cerca inutilmente di fiorire .

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Un fuoco che si spegne , uno sguardo verso il cielo
Uno sguardo verso il cielo , dove il sole è meraviglia
Dove il nulla si fa mondo , dove brilla la tua luce .

Le Quecumbar Allstars,"I was a hum-drum person
Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lawd up in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream

Le Vibrazioni,"Le distanze ci informano che siamo fragili 
E guardando le foto ti ricorderai 
Quei giorni di quiete sapendo che te ne andrai 
E io, avendo paura, non ti cercherò più 
Più 

Vieni da me 
Abbracciami e fammi sentire che 
Sono solo mie piccole paure 
Vieni da me 
Per vivere ancora quei giorni di incantevole poesia 
E ridere di questa poesia 

I veli trasformano intere identità ma 
È guardando le stelle che m'innamorerò 
Di tutte le cose più belle che ci son già 
Ma che fanno paura perché siamo fragili 
Fragili 

Vieni da me 
Abbracciami e fammi sentire che 
Sono solo mie piccole paure 
Vieni da me 
Per vivere ancora quei giorni di incantevole poesia 
E ridere di questi giorni 
Dove tutto ciò e stato solo pura

Sono sveglio e mi vesto nel posto
Sbagliato
Così sbagliato
Scusa mi sono distratto
Ti ho lasciato da sola al momento
Sbagliato
Forse ho sbagliato
I taxi delle sei
Panchine vuote
E la mia barba dentro le vetrine
Ma tu che colpa hai
Se sono io sbagliato, sbagliato, sbagliato?

Portami a casa
Salvami ancora
Da queste mani fredde e viola
Riportami a casa
Perché ho paura di me
Tienimi stretto al buio e dimmi
Che mi vuoi bene anche così
Mi vuoi bene anche così

I miei castelli di carta
I miei occhi da pugile al bordo
Sbagliato
Così sbagliato
E la mia abilità di farmi male
Quando mi sento figlio e sono un padre
E tu mi dici che
Non è così sbagliato, sbagliato, sbagliato

Portami a casa
Salvami ancora
Da queste mani fredde e viola
Riportami a casa
Perché ho paura di me
Tienimi stretto al buio e dimmi
Che mi vuoi bene anche così
Mi vuoi bene anche così

Sbagliato, sbagliato, sbagliato
Nel mio vestito vuoto vicino a te
E tu mi raccogli comunque
In mezzo ai vetri e puoi farmi credere
Che sia perfetto anche così
Che mi ami anche così

Le'Andria Johnson,"God rest ye merry, gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember, Christ, our Saviour
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

In Bethlehem, in Israel,
This blessed Babe was born
And laid within a manger
Upon this blessed morn
The which His Mother Mary
Did nothing take in scorn
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

From God our Heavenly Father
A blessed Angel came;
And unto certain Shepherds
Brought tidings of the same:
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by Name.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

""Fear not then,"" said the Angel,
""Let nothing you affright,
This day is born a Saviour
Of a pure Virgin bright,
To free all those who trust in Him
From Satan's power and might.""
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind,
And left their flocks a-feeding
In tempest, storm and wind:
And went to Bethlehem straightway
The Son of God to find.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

And when they came to Bethlehem
Where our dear Saviour lay,
They found Him in a manger,
Where oxen feed on hay;
His Mother Mary kneeling down,
Unto the Lord did pray.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

Now to the Lord sing praises,
All you within this place,
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace;
This holy tide of Christmas
All other doth deface.

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

And by the light of that same star
Three Wise men came from country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

This star drew nigh to the northwest
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest
And there it did both Pause and stay
Right o'er the place where Jesus lay.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

Then entered in those Wise men three
Full reverently upon their knee
And offered there in His presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.

It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth.

Till He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth.

For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices!

O night, O Holy Night , O night divine!

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming,
Now come the wisemen from out of the Orient land.
The King of kings lay thus lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friends.
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another,
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.

Aujourd'hui c'est devenu banal d'être un enfant de parents divorcés
Dans les foyers d'enfants y'a des excès de lits superposés
Le mariage n'est plus le trône des sentiments
Car on ne fait plus des familles mais des enfants par accident
Un avortement ne fait plus culpabiliser
Combien de filles de 17 ans sont déjà des femmes isolées?
Ici on t'apprend à vivre au singulier
Donc pour une futilité on se dispute l'immobilier
Je sais pas si t'as idée de ce qu'est aujourd'hui la vie de couple
C'est des luttes et des doutes, et des: ""Où t'était, tu me dégoûtes!""
On court, derrière les promesses des premiers rendez-vous
Car la vie de couple ne se résume pas qu'à ""I love you""

Un grand frère c'est fait pour ça, donner des coups de mains, tu sais
Oui je sais t'as toujours été là quand j'avais besoin de toi
Et dis-toi que tout ce que tu me donnes Dieu te le rendra

Pour sa famille faut savoir recevoir les coups, n'est aucun doute

C'est ce père, qui se tue la santé pour que la tienne sois bonne
Cette mère, à qui tu hausses la voix, qui sans cesse te pardonne
C'est ces frères et sœurs, qui pourraient prendre des coups pour toi
C'est ces vrais potes, qui pourraient mourir pour toi, Léa

Lately its mind is all its own
It would go far and wide
Just to be near you

Even the stars, shining up bright
I've noticed when you're close to me
Still it remains a mystery.

Anyone who's seen us
Knows what's goin' on between us
It doesn't take a genius
To read between the lines

And it's not just wishful thinking
Or only me who's dreaming
I know what these are symptoms of
We could be in love.

I ask myself why
I sleep like a baby through the night
Maybe it helps to know
You'll be there tomorrow
Don't open my eyes (ooh hoo-hoo)

I'll wake from the spell I'm under
Makes me wonder how (tell me how)
I could live without you now.

And what about the laughter
The happy ever after?
Like voices of sweet angels
Calling out our names

And it's not just wishful thinking

Or only me who's dreaming
I know what these are symptoms of
We could be in love.

All my life, I have dreamed of this
But I could not see your face
Don't ask why to such distant stars
Can fall right into place.

Or only me who's dreaming
I know what these are symptoms of
We could be in love.

Just answer your phone whenever I call
Cause I'm riding on chrome whenever I ball
I like them short and tall but not too thick
I just walk in the spot and take my pick
And they want to roll cause they like my style
And when I pop my collar I make them smile
I need a lady in the streets but a freak in the sheets
That know how to cook cause a nigga like to eat
Spaghetti, shrimp and steak and I'll adore you
I'll treat you like milk, I'll do nothing but spoil you

And we can meet up the next day and chill

You think you know my type but you ain't got no clue
About what a real nigga like me do
I like to stack my bread and flip my chips
And I can change ya life if ya get wit Flip
I take private jets to Vegas, man
It's twenty bread each pick cause I'm major man
We can cruise the world in a Bentley Azure
But don't worry, the chauffeur open the door

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

And I'm embracing you

She is the root connection

Could it be he's taking over me...

I'm dancing barefoot
Heading for a spin
Some strange music draws me in
Makes me come on like some heroine

I spin so ceaselessly,
Could it be he's taking over me...

The mystery of childbirth, of childhood itself

Why must not death be redefined?

And whirl on a pane of glass

The hands of he and the promise that she is blessed among women

Lea DeLaria,"It's a god-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling, ""No!""
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen

But the film is a saddening bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on

Oh man!
Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the Lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?

It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns

I told him I didn't mind, which was a lie
But I was equally sorry
And I didn't want to apologize

Behind my eyes, I was begging for
Things my lip? could never ask

After the club
He hands me another ?hot of vodka

I'm too lazy to type, so I send him a photo I took up a dancer's skirt
And tell him to come and get it

Holds up her phone ?creaming at me and I say
I'm sorry, it was just a drunk text

To take the world sex, and mix it with texting
It's called sexting

Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose

Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flaming with a loser and the cruise control
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the love seat

Someone keeps saying, I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve

So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Saving all your food stamps
And burning' down the trailer park
Yo, cut it

One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag

With the re-run shows and the cocaine nose job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slop
He hung himself with a guitar string
I slap the turkey neck and it's hanging' from a pigeon wing

Trade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate

Of telling tales and biting nails are gone
But in my mind I know they still live on and on

But how do you thank someone
Who was taken you from crayons to perfume
It isn't easy but I'll try

If you wanted the sky
I'd write across the sky in letters
That would soar a thousand feet high

To sir with love
The time has come
For closing books and long last looks must end
And as I leave I know that I am leaving my best friend

A friend who taught me right from wrong
And weak from strong that's a lot to learn
What can I give you in return
If you wanted the moon

Would rather let me give you my heart

Don't try to resist me

'Cause I got something to say about it
And it goes something like this

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test
You know you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last no no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test
You know you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test
You know you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself you've got to make him
Express himself
Hey hey hey hey
So if you want it right now make him show you how
Express what he's got' oh baby ready or not

And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees so please

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test
You know' you know' you've got to
Make him express how he feels

If you wake up and don't want to smile,
If it takes just a little while,
Open your eyes and look at the day,
You'll see things in a different way.

Don't stop, thinking about tomorrow,
Don't stop, it'll soon be here,
It'll be, better than before,
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.

Don't stop! Don't stop!

Why not think about times to come,
And not about the things that you've done,
If your life was bad to you,
Just think what tomorrow will do.

Don't stop, thinking about tomorrow,
Don't stop, it'll soon be here,
It'll be, better than before,
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.

Don't stop! Don't stop!

All I want is to see you smile,
If it takes just a little while,
I know you don't believe that it's true,
I never meant any harm to you.

Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turned my sorrow into treasured gold

Stare at our faces in mirrors not ready to love

Funny thing I found that old t-shirt we thought you lost it
It's still the softest
You know it made me

It took me back to
When we were driving down Laurel Canyon
And too fast you know you never slowed down

The final days were the hardest
I didn't think they would be your last
Hope you know I forgive you
Give anything to get them back

But know that everything's okay
I'm doing okay without you
I know you had to go away
I'll tell you everyday I miss you

You,
Asking as little as you can.
Little snip of a little man,
I know I'd give my life for you.

You didn't ask me to be born
You,
Why should you learn of war or pain?
To be sure you're not hurt again,
I swear I'd give my life for you.

I've tasted love beyond all fear.
And you should know it's love that brought you here.
And in one perfect night,
When the stars burned like new,
I knew what I must do.
I'll give you a million things I'll never own.
I'll give you a world to conquer when you're grown.

You will be who you want to be.
You
Can choose whatever heaven grants.
As long as you can have your chance,
I swear I'll give my life for you.

Sometimes I wake up, reaching for him.
I feel his shadow brush my head,
But there's just moonlight on my bed.
Was he a ghost?
Was he a lie?
That made my body laugh and cry?
Then by my side the proof I see, his little one.
Gods of the sun,
Bring him to me.

You will be who you want to be.
You
Can choose whatever heaven grants.
As long as you can have your chance,

Lately its mind is all its own
It would go far and wide
Just to be near you

Even the stars, shining up bright
I've noticed when you're close to me
Still it remains a mystery.

Knows what's goin' on between us
It doesn't take a genius
To read between the lines

And it's not just wishful thinking
Or only me who's dreaming
I know what these are symptoms of
We could be in love.

I ask myself why
I sleep like a baby through the night
Maybe it helps to know
You'll be there tomorrow
Don't open my eyes (ooh hoo-hoo)

I'll wake from the spell I'm under
Makes me wonder how (tell me how)
I could live without you now.

And what about the laughter
The happy ever after?
Like voices of sweet angels
Calling out our names

And it's not just wishful thinking

Or only me who's dreaming
I know what these are symptoms of
We could be in love.

All my life, I have dreamed of this
But I could not see your face
Don't ask why to such distant stars
Can fall right into place.

Or only me who's dreaming
I know what these are symptoms of
We could be in love.

Pretending he's beside me
All alone
I walk with him 'til morning
Without him, I feel his arms around me
And when I lose my way, I close my eyes and he has found me
In the rain
The pavement shines like silver
All the lights are misty in the river
In the darkness, the trees are full of starlight
And all I see is him and me forever and forever

And I know it's only in my mind
That I'm talking to myself and not to him
And although I know that he is blind
Still I say there's a way for us

I love him
But when the night is over
He is gone
The river's just a river
Without him, the world around me changes
The trees are bare and everywhere the streets are full of strangers

I love him
But every day I'm learning
All my life I've only been pretending

My morning starts to shine with teardrops in my eyes
And here I am alone starting to realize
That my days would be brighter
If I could learn to hide
The feelings that I have for you
Keep hurting me inside

Then my day begins with simple thoughts of you
Hoping that tomorrow will be me and you
Sharing dreams with each other
And making them come true
Holding one another
Saying ""all I need is you""

But will you say that you love me
And show me that you care
Say when I need you
You will always be there
But if you go and leave me
This I swear is true
My love will always be with you

Now my nights would end with just one wish, that's you
To hold me in the dark and help me make it through
'cause the pain that's inside me
Would simply melt away
If I had you here with me
And promise me you'd stay

But will you say that you love me
And show me that you care
Say when I need you
You will always be there
But if you go and leave me
This I swear is true
My love will always be with you

And show me that you care

You know some kids ask us what happiness really is.
Well, to me happiness is a hamburger, going to the movies, new clothes.
Well, what's your happiness, gerard?

My happiness is a hotdog sandwich, new rubber shoes, new t-shirts,
New jeans and also my favorite part of happiness is love.

Happiness is two kinds of ice cream
Finding your skate key, telling the time
Happiness is learning to whistle
Tying your shoe for the very first time
Happiness is playing the drum in your own school band

Happiness is five different crayons

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said, many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you",The Christmas Song,2004
Lea Salonga,"He brushes back his silver hair
And checks to see if she is standing there
After years of traveling around
With the reindeer hooves above the ground
Never made the missus run away

Remembering the night they met
Figure skating she played hard to get
In his red suit he slid past
Who could resist that charming laugh?
He said he would teach her how to fly

Even Santa fell in love
Everybody needs someone to come home to
After the longest day
Even Santa fell in love
And she's the only one he wants to come back to
When the toys are put away
Even on Christmas Day

She sees his eyes are all aglow
Anticipating children laughing in the snow
And with just his Christmas touch
Under mistletoe before the rush
Mrs. Kringle feels the tingle in her heart

Even Santa fell in love
Everybody needs someone to come home to
After the longest day
Even Santa fell in love

Winter snow is falling down
Children laughing all around
Lights are turning on
Like a fairy tale come true

Sitting by the fire we made
You're the answer when I prayed
I would find someone
And baby, I found you

All I want is to hold you forever
All I need is you more everyday
You saved my heart from being broken apart
You gave your love away
And I'm thankful everyday
For the gift

You'll still be beautiful

I sat upon your knee
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies

Well I'm all grown up now
Can you still help somehow?
I'm not a child, but my heart still can dream

So here's my lifelong wish
My grown-up Christmas list
Not for myself, but for a world in need

No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
Every man would have a friend
That right would always win
And love would never end
This is my grown-up Christmas list

What is the illusion called ""The innocence of youth""?
Maybe only in that blind belief can we ever find the truth

No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
Every man would have a friend

I'd keep them warm and in my hands
They'd not turn cold

Hand in hand we choose
The moment that should last
The lovely moment
That should have no future and no past

The summer from the top of the swing
The comfort in the sound of a lullaby
The innocence of leaves in the spring
But most of all the moment when love first touch me

All the happy days
Would never learn to fly
Until the hands of time would choose to wave goodbye

Cold empty nights and a million strangers' eyes

To leave behind all the loneliness I knew
Here in the land of loving there is you

Me huelo lo peor
Porque ese par se va a enamorar
Volvemos a ser dos

La brisa de la noche
La luna y su color
El clásico romance
Lleno de desastres por amor

And can you feel the love this night
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far

And can you feel the love tonight
How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

Quisiera ser sincero
No sé qué voy a hacer
Decirle la verdad o no
Hay mucho que esconder

Qué habrá que esconder
No puedo comprender
Por qué no quieres ser quien debes ser
Él ve que creo en él

And can you feel the love tonight
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far

And can you feel the love tonight (tonight)
How it's laid to rest (rest)
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

Lea Salonga,"Piano questi passi d’amore
Sulla strada del cuore
Che mi porta da te
Soffia il vento del tempo
Quanta notte che va
Sempre qui ci troverà

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days
I was beautiful then
I remember
The time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Nasce il sole
Che così
Ci troverà abbracciati
La sua mano
Sulla porta piano
Spalanca il cielo al mattino

In the daylight
I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn’t give in
When the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Nasce il sole
Che così
Ci trover abbracciati
Like a flower
As the dawn is waking
The memory is fading

Touch me, it’s so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun
If you touch me
You’ll understand what happiness is
Look a new day has begun",Memory,2014
Lea Salonga,"Night time sharpens
Heightens each sensation
Darkness stirs
And wakes imagination
Silently the senses
Abandon their defenses
Slowly, gently
Night unfurls its splendor
Grasp it, sense it
Tremulous and tender
Turn your face away
From the garish light of day
Turn your thoughts away from cold unfeeling light 
And listen to the music of the night
Close your eyes 
And embelish on your darkest dreams,
Purge all thoughts of the life you knew before, 
Close your eyes, let your spirit start to soar 
And you'll live like you've never lived before
Softly, deftly
Music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it
Secretly possess you
Open up your mind
Let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness which you know you cannot fight 
The darkness of the music of the night
Let your mind start a journey through a strange new world, 
leave all thoughts of the world you knew before, 
let your soul take you where you long to be, 
only then can you belong to me.
Floating, falling
Sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me
Savor each sensation
Let the dream begin
Let your darker side give in
To the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night
You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make the music of the night
",The Music of the Night,2014
Lea Salonga,"Quando sono solo
Sogno all'orizzonte
E mancan le parole
Sì, lo so che non c'è luce
In una stanza quando manca il sole
Se non ci sei tu con me, con me
Su le finestre
Mostra a tutti il mio cuore
Che hai accesso
Chiudi dentro me
La luce che
Hai incontrato per strada

Time to say goodbye
Paesi che non ho mai

Lead,"No pain 心がすれ違う時にも
No pain もしも明日が
見えなくなっても
No pain 乗り越えてゆけるきっと
No pain I seek my dream
Everywhere I wonder
少しずつ理想と現実が離れるこの頃
何処も行く宛ての無い街
自分の鼓動聞こえる
正しいモノが何かを
いつの日かこの目で確かめたいから
誰にも縛られたくない
一人手を握りしめる
I believe 小さな空見上げてたとえ
押しつぶされそうでもいつか
どんな痛みでさえも
I believe 癒されてくだろう
No pain 言葉じゃいつも
語りきれなくて
No pain 冷たい壁に風に影に隠れ
No pain 失うことを恐れずに明日へ
No pain I seek my dream
Everywhere Tell me why
時に夢追うこと
窮屈に感じてしまうよ
やさしさ忘れてしまった
大人への道の途中綺麗なモノに憧れ
胸の高鳴りを押さえきれなくて
心に嘘はつけずに不意に流れてる涙
I believe 光と影の中でたとえ
動けなくなってもいつか
笑える日が来るだろう
I believe 季節めぐる時
散らばった夢を拾い集める様に
いつの日も誰にも染まらず
自分は自分でいたいから
何も分からず彷徨う街の中
明確に残す足の形
まだらしさ出し切れずにいるかな
星空を見上げ一人目が真っ赤
No pain No gain 生き抜きの Game
当然冒険自分探しの Days
I believe
大事なモノを忘れないでの
言葉を胸に羽ばたいて
ほんの少しの勇気で
つまらない日常変わると信じて
誰かに分かって欲しい
君を強く抱きしめる
I believe 小さな空見上げてたとえ
押しつぶされそうでもいつか
どんな痛みでさえも I believe
癒されてくだろう I believe
たった一本の人生のレール
何時になったらしっかり乗れる
焦ることなく確実にケる

未来で笑い合いたい

Lead,"大事なものを守るためなら
今 胸が震えても
いつかそれさえも誇れる日が来ると
振り向きもせず
思い出は風になって
こぼれた想い胸に運ぶ
彼方の地平に また陽が昇り
知らず知らず無くした日々を
そっと照らす日まで
ただ歩いて行こう
僕らの夜も明ける
旅する意味を探し続けて
ただ 進んだあてもなく
闇雲に腕を伸ばしたその先で
出会った人たち
足跡は道になって
確かな時間(とき)深く刻む
彼方の地平の 遠いどこかで
闇の中に迷う誰かの
手を取れる日までまた歩いてみよう
その時夜は明ける
季節の香り変わる
人の心も流れていく
それでも信じ続ける事なら
過去が教えてくれた

知らず知らず無くした日々を
そっと照らす日まで

Leadbelly,"Little Jesse was a gambler, night and day
He used crooked cards and dice
Sinful guy, good hearted but had no soul
Heart was hard and cold like ice

Jesse was a wild reckless gambler
Won a gang of change
Altho' a many gambler's heart he led in pain
Began to spend a-loose his money
Began to be blue, sad and all alone
His heart had even turned to stone

What broke Jesse's heart while he was blue and all alone
Sweet Lorena packed up and gone
Police walked up and shot my friend Jesse down
Boys i got to die today

He had a gang of crapshooters and gamblers at his bedside
Here are the words he had to say

Guess I ought to know
Exactly how I wants to go
(How you wanna go, Jesse?)

Eight crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Let 'em be veiled down in black
I want nine men going to the graveyard, bubba
And eight men comin back

I want a gang of gamblers gathered 'round my coffin-side
Crooked card printed on my hearse
Don't say the crapshooters'll never grieve over me
My life been a doggone curse

Send poker players to the graveyard
Dig my grave with the ace of spades
I want twelve polices in my funeral march
High sheriff playin' blackjack, lead the parade

I want the judge and solic'ter who jailed me 14 times
Put a pair of dice in my shoes (then what?)
Let a deck of cards be my tombstone
I got the dyin' crapshooter's blues

Sixteen real good crapshooters
Sixteen bootleggers to sing a song
Sixteen racket men gamblin'
Couple tend bar while i'm rollin' along

26 off-a South Bell
29 women outta North Atlanta

You call the Rising Sun
It's been the ruin of many a poor soul 
And me, oh God, I'm one 

If I'd listened to what mama said  
I'd be at home today 
Being so young and foolish, poor girl 
I let a gambler lead me astray 

My mother she's a tailor 
Sews those new blue jeans 
My sweetheart, he's a drunkard, Lord God 
He drinks down in New Orleans

He fills his glasses to the brim 
Passes them around
The only pleasure that he gets out of life  
Is a hoboin' from town to town 

The only thing a drunkard needs 
Is a suitcase and a trunk 
The only time that he's half satisfied 
Is when he's on a drunk

Go and tell my baby sister  
Never do like I have done 
Shun that house down in New Orleans 
That they call that Rising Sun. 

It's one foot on the platform,  
One foot on the train.

No need to make bets cause I met a bookie
Today is the day the whole school plays hookie
Why? Cause I called Dinco D and Brown
Cutmonitor Milo brings the sound
Before I do that I play myself like a jerk
Make sure momma jamma took her body to work
Okay she is gone so I jet to the phone
Let the whole world know nobody's home
It's Busta Rhymes and I'm feeling irie
Come on over cause I'm having a party
Milo did the right thing and brought the ride
The sound's too pissed now the party's live
Tickets in effect, everything's sweet

Get dressed, put on my Nike Airs
Come my hairs, go upstairs
Walk outside to the fruit stand
And Dre, Kane, he's the 40's in hand
Powercat Geronimo is in the distance
The fifths are coming, the fifths are coming
Hit up, lit up the blunt and I'm straight

Half of the mob and a case of brew
Rumpletilz with the Diggum Smacks
A get through the door with the Cracker Jacks

Next to the door came the yardman Scard
Into my crib to find the inchie at last
Kallie any crew with my boy Shabazz
Shake it time iller to settle the score

Remember the days when I was walking and talking
Doing what I gotta do, doing what we want to do
Off into my walked dawn missions, why?
'cause the brothers that I knew with the rise drove by
Only nice in the days looking down the road
Seeing beautiful girls with the car load
Yeah yeah yeah they are screaming,
Wish I had a little ride on my own,
But since I don't there is my sobb story
My missions will continue as I keep on stalking
Stamina was dying from the constant walking
Right before the moment I began to car to my man Ridle
Who had a some moving on
I thought he wouldn't know that's my dying
Where are the others nammy you beat and kept driven
Now in my heart they do a big hole
'cause my little, little, little toes
Started jumping on my end soul
It was frigity burn and then I said wait, I got pride
It's time to get my own ride
I came up with the scheme and got paid
I had no other choice but go at knowledge of tray
When I got my transport, I got kind of steam G up
'cause I got cherry pet further
Now I'm feeling good 'cause I'm off my feet,
Man the little squalid dogs running up in the street
And they saying:
My name is Sharina, my name is Busta
My name is Tonia, my name is Busta
My name is Dianna, my is Busta
And what do you take me for the little loco push over
No shame in my game 'cause that's how I got this

And now I am the man fielding all the glory

So we continue on our mission to get some poonani!

Nets straight human casualties 
call for raw regrets in beat societies. 
Lessons must speak, 
Stand be strong. Keep away from weak in the years long. 
Life leaders let loose leading leftbacks. 
And misguided youth letting leaks lack. 
Levels of truth. Look ma' no hands. 
Lend likes lots of love only lasting cause I'm asking. 
Could we be above average not savage, 
But near newly more duty, more than terror. 
Peace to my girl.

want to do something ? 
Do this.

Ah man, all of a sudden people say I be buggin' 
Rugged culture musikal Hip-Hop! I be lovin' 
Gimme, gimme, gimme something. 
Gimme something for nothing. 
Rich blood sucker of the poor I see you. 
Hickory, dickory. 
Hay watch out for the trickery. 
What happened to creativity, dignity, integrity. 
Hey Mr. Sneaky-one don't try to read my mind. 
Just worry about getting yours, because I'm getting mines. 
Leaders made a commitment to keep this type of music. 
Livin' forever. 
Whatever, whatever. 
We live in an era where errors aren't made to 
Remain an error, but I think that's kinda better. 
Understand that word and how you use it. 
Rap is business music, Hip-Hop is cultural music. 
Now you get to see the one sun getting super dumb. 
Dance around because you know that we doin' it for fun. 
Flippin' and trippin'. 
You little sorry sucker you slippin' 
Lay over my lap bacause I'm gonna 
Give you a whippen. 
Trippin', dippin' and winin' 
Stop the damn crying. 
I don't know what you tryi! n' 
You better stop lyin'. 
With correct intellect, wetter, bigger and better. 
As I come straight. 
Check my Syntax Era.

Leaders of the New School,"And it goes like this
Skip to my Lou (Yes!)
I got a funky hop scotch game going on (Getting strong!)
I think you better follow this and come along
Heavens to Merkatroid, we've come with another new song
(Sing-a-long!) Ha (Tic!) Tica-tica-toc
(Who's that?) Coming around the block (Leaders of the New!)
Yes, with the shit that is sure to hit the spot
Oooh hot yes, come in my Dragon's Lair, that's when I turn slayer
Uno better say you're prayer
(Open your eyes!) Rise, yes I come to (Sterilize)
Mr. Parasite, I got your big surprise
Mad effective as you vision my perspective, hot shot
Look at what you got, a super ache infected speed knot
Yo, it seems stunning every time I see the fraud coming
Hundred miles and running, time to back the tools and start gunning
Let me tell you something, you ain't saying nothing with your fussing
Now you got my cussing, bake you like a muffin full of stuffing
For the world to see ya
Leaders of the New is in the place to be for '93, G
(What's next?) We come fresh no dutty boy can test
(What's next?) You know we wicked and we full up of finesse
(What's next?) Cause when we deh a dance, we have fi impress
(what's next?) For my brother B. Boogie Brown to come down

Brown
You know I love they way it's going down (Going down!)
You know I love they way it's going down (Going down!)
I'm the one knight supreme (Being all seeing)
Soul with the role (No I'm not European)
Operator, operator, put me on hold
Stories untold, watch the dollars unfold
Watch women approach me with the inviations
Previous engagement, speculation
I hate when my girl says ""Give me some space""
On the telephone, and never to your face
I paid my dues, so lick the balls!
In the summer, in the winter, in the spring, and in the fall
I'm romping and ripping, the needle ain't skipping
Gymnasiums and stadiums the crowd be flipping
The new to the next, and of course the nextus
The greatest, the grandest, of course you expect this
In cash, boom bash, slash, grammatical
Continual residual, flow is radical
All that, and a bag of Chips Ahoy
Tell your homeboys to bring the noise
Sunrise to sunset, yes you will remember
Born on the 19th day of September
Peace to mom-do, that's see dot B dot
Not for cock block, so stop and don't jock
So take is faker snakr, phonograph no paper
Just a philly for the ride, slide, peace see you later!
What's next? (I know you love the way it's going down!)

Ex the excess, your best bet check it
(Move it along) Cause I really can't tec it
Your cement mentality will end up in casualties
I got the right one, baby, and no you can't follow me
Got pieces of a dream I need to put together
I ain't checking for nobody who's tougher than leather
Whether I'm in or out of state, it doesn't make a difference
Why the constant complaining about my real appearance?
Saying ""Milo do you love me?"" You're always asking
What are you looking for action or romancing?
Now who the hell you think you're gassing? (What's crazy?)
Don't treat me like a Care Bear that's always smiling
I like drinking booze and sometimes wilding
Don't act new baby (Huh!) Or haven't ya heard?
Keep 110 mph inna me Dusinburg
Keep the main on taining at an even rate
One Newport breath taker in the morning and you know I'm straight
(What's next?) Voodoo hex, 666 years of sorrow
Broken by the strength of the 7
Just do the knowledge and don't ask no questions
(I know you love the way it's going down!)
I hit up a green light crossing and I am passing
On the road to riches, 4 by 4 riding over ditches
Next with the misses, hugs and kisses, the switch you missed
Cause mental fixes, erasional addiction
So complex, flex! (Time to have sex!) Now ask yourself what's next
You love the way it's going down!

The sun will come out, but don't doubt the D (Tomorrow!)
Let me see Dinco you can come out and play now
If you want to, but only if you want me to
or do strange dimensions of the pensions pile
Dispensers of bad fencers sensors while
(Busting loose) takes over your mentioning how
It came to be in '93 with what you see now
In the corners where you go sporting cones
Only a lonely homely Jones make clones
Tone dial phone girls grown close to testes
Jingling chrome press sewn Leaders aren't lefties or jet skis
Or what you call your animal when your pet pees?
(Woof!) Fucking dog, what's next, G?
I know you love the way, I know you love the way
I know you love the way it's going down! (What's next?)

The fabulous What's The Scenario remix
Whereas there are seven MC's
Six which are in physical form and one which is in spiritual essence
And he goes by the name of, uh HOOD!

Check the vibe, walk that ass or get got
F it (shit) I lick buckshots
Hood, madman, I rip up stages
Lay down your wages, I'm wild like Larry Davis
Extra, extra, pick up a clip
I'll tear ass out the frame (Ha!) and grab my dick (Ohh!)
I'm a Rock'Em Sock'Em robot kid, I drop bombs
I'm rugged and deadly, so I shit on the petty
I baseball bat a bastard, I'm bad news
I'm crazy and clever, cut throats of crews
Death on the phono, my skills are porno
You say ""oh no,"" you bitch ass homo
I bag up waste, electrifyin', I'm prime-time
I slaughter a slime, I'm the greatest of all time
Sick ass brother, nasty ass nigga
Pump slugs in your face, and dump that ass in the river
Two tears in a bucket, fuck it, kick the can
(Say what, say what?) I'm a bad, bad man

Quick is how I flip from the tip of the lip
Punchin' out hits like Gladys Knight and the Pips
The five-foot assassin has just raided your area
Your booty rhymes are wack and that's the reason I ain't hearin ya
(So!) Roll out the red carpet cause I'm kickin' this
Vanilla Ice platinum? That shit's ridiculous
Excuse my French, but profanity is all I knew
And to you other sellouts, oh yeah, F you too
And let it be known, I'm not the one to step to
You're better off calling D-Nice to your rescue
Freestyle fanatic, probably the best around
As for corny MCs, like Chuck D, I shut 'em down
The Artical Don of hip-hop and I won't stop
The five-foot assassin has come to wreck 'nuff shop
So do like Michael Jackson and ""Remember the Time"" (Do you remember?)
Put on your dancin' shoes or somethin cause you sure can't rhyme

Next to say something cause you pass it to me
What does it take to check a technique?
(Many styles, many styles!)
Hostile heat, brings bursts of energy
Milo in De Dance is the new identity
One two mic check, select for the ruffneck sect
Ten to one that I come (Correct!)
In my cyphers on blocks, I bring box to connect with knots
So I can grow dreadlocks
Maintain the rock (Don't stop the rock)
Maintain the rock (Don't stop the rock)

Will commence to rock (Rock!) So bring on the flocks (Flock!)

The boom-box ruler, controls the medulla
None come cooler, I win like Shula
So bust out the moves as you start to pursue her
Intensified mind, nine-blunt consumer
Tip will come booty (Well it's only a rumor!)
The meanin' so deep that it starts brain tumors (Tumors!)
Peace to Hood baby from the midnight crooner
Smoke 'em up later, if not then sooner

Hey what we gon do (Dooo) in '92
Even though we had fun (Fuuun) in '91
Wonderful my days, herb dream comin' down
Ponna ponna new sound, leavin' cracks in the ground

Listen up, Busta, rhythm will hit 'em then I get 'em
Rip on 'em, shit on 'em, hit on 'em, then I will sit on 'em
Open up your mouth if you want the food
To get rude, Flipmode, cause I'm in the mood

If I touched you here would you get the butterflies
Could I see your chills would you show me how you cry
Did you ever think what loving me could mean
When you're all alone do you imagine me
I can't breathe you took my breath away
Breathing you'd be worth my last days

Leah Andreone,"Broken doll baby
And she says that life's a waste
It doesn't have to be that way
Dad threw away her mom

Her mom gave up his name
Crucified by their words
Nailed by shame
She stares into the sun

Self-inflicted pain
She sees that they're blind
Why does she take all the blame
The rhyme has changed compulsion rules

Mary's little lambs are now raised by wolves
A voyeur with wings flashes a cure
She knows forbidden things they have a lovely lure
It's alright it\'s ok

Welcome to this life
Killin' time
Just watchin' the grass grow
It's alright it's ok

Welcome to this life
Don't worry sweet baby
'Cause it's over before you know 
Persecuted she's not normal

I envy her strange ways
Seven deadly sins
Seize the hour seize the day
Her ideas need expression

Her wounds never bleed
Her beauty lives in my eyes
Too bad she can't see
She doesn't try I watch her spirits die

But giving up the ghost would feel so good
A voyeur with wings flashes a cure
She knows forbidden things they have a lovely lure
It's alright it's ok

Welcome to this life
Killin' time
Just watchin' the grass grow
It's alright it's ok

Welcome to this life
Don't worry sweet baby
'Cause it's over

[Chorus: x2]

Crumbling Camelot idle teardrops
Cloudy diamonds freebase fun house
Expecting to fly but she's just standing still
Every time she gets it up she just can't close the deal

So she gives herself another way out
Walks her dog for the 50th time and
Files her nails till they bleed and she cries now
She doesn't have to try
It's alright, it's okay, it's alright.","It's Alright, It's OK",1996

Hold me aimlessly
I can feel you
Letting me go
Don't sing me a lullaby

And get out of here

Mangled songs words are strained
Your picture's gone I'm lost in the frame
Kiss me goodbye

Your stalling makes it worse

Deflower my memories and
I'll memorize your last breath
Ignore the weight I've lost

You're flattered
Were you always this blind
Get your business done
Show me your lowest low
Toxic waste
Isn't this fun
Prey on this
Well I'll be damned
Kiss be goodbye Judas
The dance is done so let it rain

Your body's betting on your head to find the strength to stand

Stood still while you ran
Looking down now look up there's hope

All my answers turned into whys
But no one answers me
Why you why me

As years go by she sits and waits
As years go by? Uh oh
A torturous existence
I don't remember this part!
She wishes she were dead?
Skip ahead! Skip ahead!
But in the end Rapunzel finds a millionaire
The prince is good at climbing
And braiding golden hair!

So I know, he'll appear
Cause there are rules and there are strictures
I believe the storybooks I read by candlelight
My white knight, and his steed
Will look just like these pictures!
It won't be long now, I guarantee!
Day number Twenty three

I know its today
I know its today!

Oh here's a good one! It's a classic!

There's a princess
In a coma
Glad its her instead of me
Pretty maiden
In a glass box
How I wonder does she pee?
Blah blah blah, poison apple
Boring boring, evil queen
Filler filler, been there, read that!
Seven shorties on the scene
Skip ahead, skip ahead!
But in the end the princess wakes up with a start
The prince is good at kissing
And melting Snow White's heart!

So I know, he'll appear
And his armor will be blinding!
As shining as his perfect teeth
And manly hose
He'll propose
On one knee
And our pre-nup will be binding!
About time we set the wedding date!
Day number nine hundred and fifty eight

I know it's today
He'll show up today!

There's a princess!
Any princess!
Take your pick, they're all like me!
Not exactly, I'm still waiting!
They're out living happily
Ever after better get here
I want love in seconds flat!
No one needs these middle bits
Oops, did I do that?

Cut the villains, cut the vamping
Cut this fairy tale
Cut the peril and the pitfalls
Cut the puppet and the whale!
Cut the monsters! Cut the curses!
Keep the intro! Cut the verses!
And the waiting! The waiting! The waiting! The waiting!
The waiting!

But I know, he'll appear
Though I seem a bit bipolar
And I'm a vandal now as well, hope he won't mind
I'm a find, I'm a catch
And a very gifted bowler!
It won't be long now, I guarantee!
Day number

Are you there god?
It's me Fiona

It's me Fiona!

Now I know, he'll appear
Cause there are rules and there are strictures
I believe the storybooks I read by candlelight
My white knight, my knight and his steed
Will look just like these pictures!
It won't be long now, I guarantee!

Day number twenty three

Day number nine fifty-eight

Day number eight thousand, four hundred and, twenty three

I know it's today, ooh!

I know it's today, ooh!

I know it's today, ooh!

I know it's today, ooh!

I know it's today, ooh!

And I find myself thinking of you

Thought I heard you call my name
But looked around and no one was there

Where was I god's everlasting fool
Caught up in the riptides of a fantasy

And even though you passed
Going on four long years
Still waking up late at night crying tears
Just thinking about those days
You used to talk to me
Smilin' while I'm sippin' on this Hennessey
And remember we bragged on how rich we would be
To get up out this hood was like a fantasy

And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'

And boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half
I would give it all up, just to take one ride

But y'all don't see the inside of my unhappiness
Man I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton
That's why you hear me shootin', this real shit off like a gun
Hmm I wonder how my friends would treat me now
If I wasn't iced up with a Bentley and a house
That's why fake ass niggas get fake ass digits
And fake ass playas get a real playa hatin' 'em
Honey Love goes platinum and y'all ass come around
But y'all don't want to raise the roof
Until my shit is going down

And how I used to club hop on weekends

Said the Lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt

And all I ever wanted is to be a better man
And I try to keep it real with my homies now
For me to save the world I don't understand
How did I become the leader of a billion men?

I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay",I Wish,2014
