Wild Beasts,"All we want is to feel that feeling again
Just a drop on the lips and we're more than equipped
There is some thirst that's gotta be quenched, yeah
All we want is to feel that feeling again
We didn't reach a high it was always inside
We just coaxed it from the place it would hide.

We move in fear, we move in desire
Now I know how you feel.
I'm a pilgrim, you're the shrine to
All the lovers that loved before us
And breathed in this ether.
Where the body goes the mind will follow soon after.

Cause all we want is to know the vivid moment
Yeah, how we feel now was felt by the ancients
Yeah, all we want is to know the vivid moment
Just surrender your limbs to my every whim
Now we're lovers, we are cartwheeling.

We move in fear, we move in desire
Now I know how you feel.
I'm a pilgrim, you're the shrine to
All the lovers that loved before us
And breathed in this ether.
Where the body goes the mind will follow soon after.

We've a Mecca now, weave a Mecca now, no less
To hold the other end of the thread. Hold on-

We move in fear, we move in desire
Now I know how you feel.
I'm a pilgrim, you're the shrine to
All the lovers that loved before us
And breathed in this ether.
Where the body goes the mind will follow soon after.

'Cause, all we want is to feel that feeling again,
Yeah, all we want is to feel that feeling again.",Mecca,2014
Wild Beasts,"Here comes a boy of all your dreams
Fists and fingers bloody

So he works all day and he works all night
Keeps you all locked up inside
I'm the thing you fenced in
I'm ten men

And ooh yes he does it all
Ooh yes where he walks
You'll feel the things you never feel
Behind this wall only love is real

Your only joy, your only bliss
Your lady wife around his lips

The things she said she'd never do
A little fun for me, and none for you
I'm the thing you fenced in
I'm ten men

Ooh yes he does it all
Ooh yes where he walks
You'll feel the things you never feel
Behind this wall only love is real

Dripping in gold he comes
Feast your eyes on that man
He's the one to teach me what I am
Now I've seen it all
Right down against the board
No fence ever held a nature boy

Ooh yes he does it all
Ooh yes where he walks

Behind this wall only love is real",Nature Boy,2014
Wild Beasts,"Warm and blind
Groping in the briny deep

You were the wild one that nothing would stick to

Open its eyes like new life

Mama who grew lungs
And crawled across the beach

Wild Beasts,"n detail you were even more beautiful than from afar
I could love you like the blinded would do
Feeling their way through the dark

In the darkened house of love it feels like I was sleeping
But the bath ran cold
This is a palace and love is a sport
Maybe this heaven is a game of old words
A man who made old habits

Winter was long, now is going to a feast
We may be saddened to know but at the call of higher needs

Ooh, hey palace, ooh.

The past old faces of those who vaguely resemble love
But well close enough
You remind me of the person I wanted to be
Before I ever knew

I don't see you like I used to
It was a thievery of my eye
So long
You keep chasing like a rooster
Everything you lay eyes on

So I flee
I fly
I don't have no choice
I would rather
I would rather die
Than live with you in this life
Than live with you in this life

Cause you're just a backslider every single day
Backsliding like a chain
You're just a capturer on a lonely chase
Backslide into your grave

My babe
Guess he could stand a little cheatin'
Because his heart is made of stone
And now
I ain't got tears to cry, I'm leavin'
Even in your arms I'm alone

You go back to your old flame
And she'll love you once again
I'm just a blockade at this game
Your lips are lies
And your eyes the same

You're just a backslider every single day
Backsliding like a chain
You're just a capturer on a lonely chase

How we love to sleep
At the close of day
When the joys of the day fade away and the memories sweet
Of the day repeat 
In our dreams they creep
While we sleep, sleep, sleep
It seems that daytime was just made for laughter and song
Evening brings romance to lovers as they stroll along
Night time brings rest to the weary
Sooths all the hearts that are dreary
Leaves us alone with our day dreams
Brings back sweet golden love dreams while we sleep, sleep, sleep

And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away

Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

Wild Carrot,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me

Well I woke up Christmas morning and what did I see?
I saw a lovely señorita looking back at me
Named Guadalupe, with big brown eyes
Boy what did you do this time?

Made my excuses and a beeline for the bedroom door
She was beggin' and a-pleadin', screamin', ""Por favor,
Mi cumpleaños, stay with me,
Baby it's cold outside""

Put your feet up baby, it's Christmas time

She gave me coffee and tortillas to console my head
Prepared the slippers on my feet before she made our bed
And blew the candles from her favourite cake
And we kissed beneath the mistletoe

I pulled her body close to mine and I had just one chance
I whispered, ""Baby will you marry me for just one dance?""
Infatuation, the things you say
I got scared and I left that night

'Cause we are livin' in a difficult time

Wish upon a Christmas tree

She haunts the early morning hours of December dreams

I'm telling you that
Love will wait
It holds what lies within it
And time will only help us grow
And when we let these feelings go
Waiting there will be love

I feel the ticking of your heart
It's beating so close to mine
Still I don't want to go too far
Until I know that it's right

Someday when we explore
When we explore the world that's yet unknown
The beauty of it will be worth
The patience that we've shown

We've both been there before At times too blind to see that love will wait
(Love will wait) And when I open up my eyes I see your face still smiles
That's when I know that",Love Will Wait,1996

In her baby blues
I'll be over when I know
That she's all over you
I can hear the ticking
Of the cuckoo clock
I can see you hiding in the shadow of her locks
She don't really love you
She don't understand
What she's got between the precious creases of her hands
Life becomes the poet
Messing with her words
In the margin soft and blurred
Time is my complexion
Love is my parade
Funny how the fiddler knows exactly when to play

I'll always be there when you drown
I'll place my why inside your sympathy
I'll leave my x beside your o
My generation is a runaway centipede
My generation is about to go
",Fine,1996
Wild Strawberries,"Words can be a problem when you're on parole
I don't care much for language I just want her soul
She left me just when Pushkin turned to shove
The answer to the question who are you thinking of?

You've got to give it up
Give it up
Hold me baby when you give it up
Give it up

Every now and then I start rambling on
I don't care much for grammar I just need her son
He left me in the sibilance and pops
The answer to the question who made your sentence stop",Give It Up,1996
Wild Strawberries,"The first thing I remember you were walking away
You were singing something gentle in the fade
The next thing I remember I nearly pushed you off the stage
I pretended not to be afraid

I played the fool
I played the drowning man
I will play your heroine
I know the rules
You wrote them on my veins
I will play your heroine

I'm calling from the border of another nameless state
I am sitting on the steps of our mistake
I will bring you postcards of everything that's gray
I will draw your smile on my slate

I said I loved you
I said I needed you but baby I was wrong
Well that was Sunday
And now it's Wednesday and I'm feeling strong

Memory's a lover trying to tell you that she's late
Memory's a silent second take
She will drink the poison if you put it in your cup
She will touch your eyes and never stop



",Heroine,1996
Wild Strawberries,"Meet me in a doorway 
I'll be painting pictures of gates 
You were so crazy 
I was so chaste 
I don't know what happened to me 
I don't know 
I-I-I-I-I don't want to think about it 
I-I-I-I-I don't want to think about it 
You rendered me conscious 
You cut my innocent face 
I'm not really bitter 
Then again I'm not amused 
I just want to kick you till you cry 
I loved I really loved you 
I-I-I-I-I don't want to think about it 
I-I-I-I-I don't want to think about it 
Meet me in a doorway 
I'll be wearing Middleton's lace 
It's as sterile as chess 
Nobody'd guess 
You were touching me between the love of God and sister mercy 
I-I-I-I-I don't want to think about it 
I-I-I-I-I don't want to think about it 
I-I-I-I-I don't want to think about it

I don't want to think about it 
Think about it 
Think about it

",I Don't Want to Think About It,1996
Wild Strawberries,"I want to be the leading lady on my own
I want to act sophisticated on my own
I want to walk across your ocean
I want to file you under see
I want to hang your mixed emotion over me
I want to touch you where the hurting never goes
I want to drive five wicked horses through your pose
Everyone loves a winner when he's wrong
Everyone wants the singer to sing along
If you were water I would never be dry
I'd draw the curtain on the edge of the sky
If I could turn you I would gladly oblige
If I could find you we'd be running out of time
",On My Own,1996
Wild Strawberries,"I don't want to be beautiful
No one ever hears her speak
I don't want to be a diplomat
With a heart attack for peace

All that I need is a fire escape
All that I need is a stone
Everything that starts out burning
Ends up overgrown

I don't want to be an astronaut
I've flown higher on my own
I don't want to be a movie star
I don't need to be alone

All that I need is a blunt excuse
All that I need is a ruse
Everything that starts off burning
Ends up feeling used

I don't want to be president
There's some things I'd like to keep
I don't want to be a nightingale
I don't need to feel that cheap

All that I need is an antidote
All that I need is a muse
Everything that starts off burning
Ends up feeling used



",Blunt,1998
Wild Strawberries,"History is everything
Said the professor to the petitioner's girl
She, playing with her shoe,
Says I just want someone, I just want something new

I don't know what hit you
Don't care where ya been
I just know you gotta' go

Speed is everything
Said the co-pilot to the girl with the braid
She, looking round the room
Says I just want someone, I just want something new

I don't know what hit you
Don't care where ya been
I just know you gotta' go

Timing is everything
Said the conductcor to the boy half his age
He, tightening a screw,
Says I just want someone, I just want something new

I don't know what hit you
Don't care where ya been
I just know you gotta' go



",Gotta Go,1998
Wild Strawberries,"Any last requests before I go
Time is fading fast and feeling slow
Hit me when I start to dream
When I whisper maybe close the screen

I'm not asking for opinions
Spare me all your little minions
I just want to wake inside my dreams
I don't know what makes me happy
Just give me joy and make it snappy
Paste my numbered soul with magazines

Someone made a killing on tv
Everyone was willing no one free
All the kids in china stores
Know that living makes them sore

CHORUS

Blessed are the meek for they shall see
Everything that we've already seen
Everybody we have known
Every thing that's overgrown

CHORUS




",Minions,1998
Wild Strawberries,"I think I missed you in the elevator
I think I missed you when I shot too high
Just like the bullet in the temple baby
I really miss your eyes
I know I missed you in Andalusia
I think I missed you when I took my time
Just like that photograph that Carroll drew ya
I think my shot was wide
Mirror mirror on the wall
Tell me why you make things fall
Mirror mirror look at me
Tell me why we disagree
It's so complicated

Just when you think you've got the one in sight
He starts to run into the crowd of cages
With all that bleeding light
I think I've got the combination
I think I've got my settings straight
I measured time like he was half-crustacean
And now he makes me wait
Mirror mirror on the wall
Tell me why you make things fall
Mirror mirror look at me
Tell me why we disagree
I've resorted to aphorisms

Somewhere between love and jism
Stolen like the blanket 
I stain on bended knee
I'm afraid of my own drop shadow
I'm frozen by the coming youth
I'd like to see the dotted line 
Between flies and truth
Mirror mirror on the wall
Tell me why you make things fall
Mirror mirror look at me
Tell me why we disagree",Mirror Mirror,1998
Wild Strawberries,"Maybe I should have noticed
When faith forgot her shoes
I should have marked the day
When pity came to stay
And truth settled on the roof

I'm not gonna cry when you go
Crying leaves me cold
And when I'm cold
I start to crave
Someone warm and safe

She smells like the violent
Swollen arm of spring
Wrestling with her clothes
Tempting I suppose
Tepid and glistening

CHORUS

Lately I've been thinking
Hope is underage
I'll never kiss her lips
Unless she insists
And probably then I'd wait

CHORUS



",Not Going to Cry,1998
Wild Strawberries,"I'm not the perfect sister
I'm just the wounded one
I was created to compare
I'll quit while she's ahead
I've finally found the rent
I'll memorize the words to every other line she says
She's got pretty little lips
She's got perfect skin
I wonder why I even try
To disappoint you
I could draw a diagram
I could point it at your mouth
I could stroke it till you're blind
And I'd disappoint you

She's got good intentions
The kind that make you squirm
She's like the movie of the week
I've seen her kind before
So pretty and adored
So empty and so free that I'd forgotten I'd forgotten

CHORUS

I'm not the perfect sister
I'm just the wounded one
I was created to compare
One day I'll make the cut
I'll put it down in blood
I'll make you wish that it was any other way

CHORUS




",Pretty Lip,1998
Wild Strawberries,"Speak of the devil baby
I've got my reservations
I saw you coming from a meter away
I'm not excited
I'm not even waiting
I saw the picture and I know it's a fake

That's how the story goes
That's what the people say
I'm bitter I suppose
But bitterness is gold when she wants her way

If you're gonna put me under
Make sure you do it neatly
If I'm going under I'll go all the way
If you're going pull the curtains
Make sure you pull discreetly
Nothing sticks together without needles and chains

CHORUS

I know the number
I've seen the mark already
I drove the rental into the Hertz
I can smell the fishes
I know the crimes are changing
Nothing sticks together without needles and skirts

CHORUS



",Speak of the Devil,1998
Wild Strawberries,"I don't need directions
I can see the course
You don't need to whisper baby
I've heard it all before
Hate and lemon under your nails
I don't need protection
I don't need to show your telling tail

I don't need your prohibition
I don't need to score
You can keep your liquor
Baby that's for sure
Whine and silver under your feet
I don't know what moves you
I can't even see when I'm on my knees

Baby give that quiver to me
I can shoot an arrow through anything
Please don't give me your reasons
I'll never need them when I'm on my trampoline

I have seen the devil
Looking for the chord
I can make your carbon copy
Sullen and adored
Mercy and ashes under your hair
I don't need revisions
I don't need to fill
What isn't there

CHORUS

Tolerance is petty
Misery is bored
Someone slipped the combination
Underneath the door
Tongue and courage under your skin
I don't need your resolution
I don't need to sort what could have been

CHORUS




",Trampoline,1998
Wild Strawberries,"How about keeping time with my wicked daughter
She would be so surprised just to see your face
After all those evil things you taught her

I bet you didn't know
You could be so cold

Meet her in the back of the cellar
She will give you wine like you'll never taste
I'll be hanging pictures of umbrellas

I bet you didn't know
You could be so cold

I'll be sitting pretty by the television
Please don't forget to leave the change
Hey it's my little prison

I bet you didn't know
You could be so cold



",You Could Be So Cold,1998
Wild Strawberries,"Joy is dancing like another thousand coming to my bungalow
She's infectious and I think of heaven looking down on me below
Don't think about tomorrow
You'll never see today
Joy is dancing like another thousand coming to my bungalow

You turn around and everything's the same
You turn again and everything has changed
You take me to the place where everything starts
Just like a brand new notion
I got the way to make it o...
I got the way to make it okay

You take me to the place where angels cry
Under the swollen mine
I got the way to make it o...
I got the way to make it okay

",Bungalow,2000
Wild Strawberries,"They've got you where they want you
Nothing's ever gonna satisfy you
You think they'll never buy you
They're doling out affection
Just like a confection

It's hard enough to know which way to go
Without you in my head
This could be my lucky day
This could be my lucky day

You have give them credit
Especially when it is due
Love becomes a debit
You can whisper me in seconds
Kiss me by the season

It's hard enough to know which way to go
Without you in my head
This could be my lucky day
This could be my lucky day

I'm dizzy like the ceiling
I'm studid like a middle name
I don't know what I'm feeling
Why don't you kiss me while we're sinking
Into the unthinking




",Lucky Day,2000
Wild Strawberries,"Tainted Love
By Soft Cell


Sometimes I feel I've got to
Run away I've got to
Get away
From the pain that you drive into the heart of me
The love we share
Seems to go nowhere
And I've lost my light
For I toss and turn I can't sleep at night

Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Oh...tainted love
Tainted love

Now I know I've got to
Run away I've got to
Get away
You don't really want IT any more from me
To make things right
You need someone to hold you tight
And you'LL think love is to pray
But I'm sorry I don't pray that way

Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Oh...tainted love
Tainted love

Don't touch me please
I cannot stand the way you tease
I love you though you hurt me so
Now I'm going to pack my things and go
Tainted love, tainted love
Tainted love, tainted love
Touch me baby, tainted love
Touch me baby, tainted love
Tainted love
Tainted love

Tell me what I need to hear
And I'll believe you
We've been doing this for years
And it shows

I don't care what people say
All I want to do is wake you
When I wake you

I know when we smell the same
It's official
I know you can guess my thoughts
Before me

I don't care what people say
All I want to do is wake you
When I wake you

Wild Strawberries,"Drinking curdled milk from a silver cup
Watching all the boys waiting for the plan to erupt
You can talk all you like when you're down on your luck
And you're looking for a reason to run
Down and out in Canaan
On a cloudy day you can see the sun
Down and out in Canaan
Nobody's gonna' ever give you reason to run
Love is never so wise as it is when it's crossed
Like an angry wind stirring up a handful of dust
Turning water from wine, mixing gold into rust
Painting justice in the wake of the sun
Close the bitter page with a sour look
Cast a callous eye around you at the pictures you took
Live your life in a line, leave your love in a book
Hang your money on the tip of your tongue
",Down and out in Canaan,2005
Wild Strawberries,"There's a penny poised on a whitewashed fence
There's a little black boy praying for his government
There's a nervous lady reaching for her place
There's a red faced son running from his race
Everything that rises
Everything that rises
Everything that rises must converge
This is my country-this is your sign-
We are painting fences, drawing lines
Well I don't know much about anything
And I don't know much about conversation
Look at me, look at me giving my weakness away
Do you know Coventry-ribbons and bows-
She will throw confetti in your soul
Well I don't know much about anything
And I don't know much about conversation
Look at me, look at me giving my weakness away
",Everything That Rises,2005
Wild Strawberries,"Murder cries the cathedral
A hungry hawk, a sword, a ploughshare
Set the stage in Canterbury
Seven years and then
Peace lies waiting-fugitive, cloistered and longing
Peace lies waiting-hovering above the spearpoints
Peace stands higher than my fragile sense of need
Peace I leave with you
Not as the world gives or has ever seen
Safe in the ruins
Killed but not wounded
Pierced with painful joy
When he smiles
Even the wind and the rain
Close their eyes
Hold their fire
I've never seen peace in a vacuum
But I've seen it in a bitter sea
Safe in the ruins
Killed but not wounded
I'm held tightly free

Wildchild,"""(spoken)Yo, so you know, all of a sudden, we're in front of the

And I'm  like ""Just go!"" you know?  And then she, 
she gotta get something out the car 
she gotta do this she gotta do that...(/spoken)

Yo she was always trying to fight me
Kick me and bite me
I used to argue with her daily and nightly
Trying to excite me, saying shit to spite me
She said ""I know it isn't another girl!"" I said ""It might be.""
There really wasn't but I said it cause she hyped me.
I know she loved me but she act like she don't like me
And started gradually just trippin' on me slightly
All of a sudden, she stopped acting politely
I said ""Just kiss me instead of trying to dis me.
'Cause when I'm gone you'll be hollering you miss me.
You should just love me instead of trying to shove me.
Try to hug me instead of trying to bug me.""
She beautiful but be acting like she ugly
I know she dug me but why the hell she drug me
Through all the drama talking 'bout that she can kill me?
Be flashing on me, turn around and say ""You feel me?""
I'm like ""Yo, you ain't always got to grill me
You better tighten up before somebody steal me.""

Why you be acting up, why you be showing out?
Why you be talking all loud when we in the house?
What's with the attitude? Why you like to run your mouth?
I guess you really don't know what it's all about.
You gots to BOUNCE
Get your clothes and BOUNCE
Pack your bullshit and BOUNCE
Get your clothes and BOUNCE
Gimme everything and BOUNCE

She was always trying to hold me
Shape me and mold me.
I never knew and nobody ever told me
Trying to control me just because she know me
She said ""If you love me like you tell me then you show me!""
I had to tell her that I dealt with her solely
It didn't matter 'cause she treated me so coldly
Tried to talk with her but she blocked it like a goalie
We was lovers before we was homies
I said support me instead of trying to short me
Outvote me or root beer float me
Misquote me or even scapegoat me
And after all that insult me?

(spoken)You know, we used to be close now you want to badmouth me 
and talk to your friends all crazy about what I do...(/spoken)

She was always trying to clown me
Sink me or drown me
Outthink outdrink and out-of-bound me.
I used to leave but I hated when she found me
But she got to everyone in the townie
I tried to duck from the drama that surround me
It's in my blood, I'm a king you got to crown me
The way she flipped the script on me was astounding
""Who do you think about when you say who found me?""
I should have taught her everytime I fought her
I never caught her and never tried to salt her
I wonder why our relationship falter
I guess we both have the kind of life you can't alter.

Or just break up cause that can be a wake up
And when you wake up make sure you take up

Wildchild,"I knew you was fucking around
Playing all innocent and hoeing since the foundation
Don't make me have to pound his tin crown face in
And risk being jammed up like traffic inbound from spacing
There's been a place for you in my heart since we first met
A teenage love that didn't feel no hurt yet
My boys warned me you was poison like BBD first cassette
And still I put all my chips on the worst bet
Gave up the skirt, now I gotta hear it from the street
How dare you drag my name in the dirt and cheat
You could've broke it off and ended it and dip
And if you spoke soft we could've still preserved the friendship
Now you apologize, that's what they all say
You wasn't sorry when you sucked him off in the hallway
But have it your way, raw, no foreplay
That's you if you want a dude who wear a mask all day
And just to think I used to be proud of you
And you had some real good power

Probably kissed me later that evening, I should be hurling
Matter of fact, gimme back my bracelet and my Shearling
I rather waste it or give it to your girlfriend
She did let me stab it last week while you was workin'
Remember our vacation out to Maryland
I dooked the maid Carolyn, she made me throw the towel in
Like all foul men the time I hit your moms off
I told her knock it off but she had to set the rocket off

Where you goin' why, cause I'm comin' with ya
I wanna know the master plan you've got for the game, 
I'm that boy I'm top of the game, won't stop for the game, 
I've had my share of knocks in the game
And now I'm on another level, keep your eyes on the level, 
Cause they change every day
Go to sleep and when you wake, you will see them change again
I don't wanna be the one who didn't gain from the game
I want somethin' out of it, you cannot take me out of it, 
Oi blood you must be out of it finkin' you can shake me up I won't brake
There's only so much you can take before you flip out, 
So I'm about to go my own way before I flip out
I've heard my name before and so you know wot I'm about, 
I'm from the same place as you so you've seen me about
People thought I would amount to nothing, but I changed it round, 
Now I've got my sound I'm trying to spread this sound around
Boy I'm on my way

I was lost, I had to be found, I had to wake up,

If you don't believe me one day you will see
If there's a pie to eat you can't stop me
Hungry, starvin' want to eat food
Cheesy food till the body gets red
And I won't feed myself until I'm full up
Full up to the dance, get paid that's a pie
Movin' skunk by the kilo that's a pie
Jack move, robbery yeah that's a pie
If you see a pie go and eat that pie
I'm like where's that pie
Everyday I eat pies
If you're not hungry you can stand by
Eat pies from London to NY
Every pie I eat my belly gets bigger
Who ate all the pies? Me
If you don't like me then I'm sayin' goodbye to the man who don't like me
To the woman who don't like me
It's cool I'm bigger now
I believe in myself got tricks up my sleeve
And under my belt

It don't matter if you offer me a pie
A few years ago because now I'm satisfied

You're a liar, you'll love this fame on the road boy
You want to be John Wayne on the road
Then go ahead you will get blaze on the road
I'm Billy The Kid I just blaze on the road
I got this hunger to be on the road
I can see on the road
Then when I go I get shy, murk me on the road
Must be the top boy, MC of the road
If you want to eat pies like me on the road
Write lyrics for me
Catch me on the road
I got a title, look at me on the road
I'm way above average I'm free on the road
I go anywhere freely you can never take me out

I can feel em gettin' closer to me

I can feel me getting closer to them, 
I've got that strap on the back of my mind n I'm prepared to take them down(down) ye
I can see her, she's tryin' to get revenge
I treated her badly, now she's on her way to being angry
I can see it, I'm gonna be that boy from E.3, 
Living through the t.v, the soldiers they are behind me waiting
I'm on the way to the top and I'm gonna take ma area straight to the top with me
There's more artists where I came from they'll be treddin' after me
Watch this space I'm settin' the pace like dizzee
I represent the underground, that's where I get busy
My names Wiley, call me eskiboy, can't tes me boy I'm blessed rudeboy
Rip that 's' off your chest rude boy, I'll make you go home sit down and practice boy
You can't match dis flow, I'm treddin' on thin ice with this flow
Roll deeps behind me bro (yeah!)
It's that to time to get going

[Chorus: x2]
Now I'm treddin' on thin ice
I'm at the end of my tether got to keep myself together
I'm treddin' on thin ice
It's like I don't learn cause I've made the same mistake more than twice

I'm pissed cause, for the last year and a half I've been wasting time
Creating hatred(time), I'm still learning the basics(time)
But I'm a boy this time, I've got it locked this game is mine
Girls come girls go, oh well that's life
I'm a cheat from the street, oh well that's life
No you can't take my wife I'm single, I can take your life
It's grind time, where's the grim, treddin' on thin ice
Come here, let's not get up in relationships(long ting)
Commitment, that's a long ting
Its better if we are linking, no strings attached
Lets tread on thin ice
Girl gets attracted to boy in less than five minutes
Watchin' a DVD in the teak spot in ten minutes
Then I'm guessin' that its time to,  hit the back seat
Pull your thong to the side, so that he can meet her
The phone is ringing it's her man, he is trying to find her
But, she is with me, she gives me the ultimate sex

Wiley,"Yeah, it?s Eskiboy aka Wiley
And I'm back, still treddin?
A right nice 50/50

Yo, I'm 50/50, nifty nifty
Got the best deal, nobody can twist me
Every time somebody try to shoot me
I flip the board, they miss me, miss me

They don't wanna two fist me, fist me
I'm quick, I used to kick ball with [Incomprehensible]
And now, I fly through the air like a Frisbee
Or paper aeroplanes, see my life is risky

They like the hype and I like the mic
We both like to fight, them girls like to lips me
I don't mind, I'm an artist
Don't take part if you don't like drama, that's risky

Everyday I make history
If I wanna turn Muslim, I?ll go and see Ibby and Shifty
I got a brand new deal, at the other end it?s 50/50

I'm 50/50, hold tight Big Dadda
Eskiboy, Roll Deep, Boy Better Know
Nothing look, E3 all day
So Shu Hut Muh

It?s not 2% after recruitment blood
It?s 50/50, I got too many memories of pain
And now you can't hit me

[Incomprehensible] let go now
Before I show ya whole street about E-LOAN history
I ain't mad I'm a 2-6 dad, 2-38 spang? 2 times 6 Bang?
And she loves me, just like everybody?s girl loves Frisky?s show

I gotta let you know, this seems tipsy, fuck
When I'm on the stage, DJ don't worry, just mix me
We could be in Leicester, we could be in [Incomprehensible]

Watch me, I can get the whole crowd with me
Can't get rid of me, I'm so nippy
And my new album did more than convince me
I'm a star in the sky, can't miss me, you can't miss me

Eskiboy aka Wiley aka Igloo boy aka Roll Deep
Boy Better Know, Grime, what ever you wanna call it
And I'm not even eatin' pies anymore
I'm not even eatin' pies, I don't want no more pies
Man?s lookin' for the big P, you get me? 50 bumbaclut 50

Wiley,"She's my baby girl and she relies on me
Loves me too much, won't hide from me
She knows it's shit, I've got too many flies on me
Got spies on me, that's why I had the blacks do a nine on me

And one day, she'll be on the grind like me
Doin' music, spittin' on the hype like me
Eskigirl sprayin' on the stage like me
The first beats she makes will be 'Snowman Remix'
She can make beats like me

And when I play 'Stormy Weather' she gets mad
Put on a screw-face just like me
So I know she's got it, the gift I possess
Avoid the street mess and stay close to me
'Cause money's the key, I run around freely gettin' it
Just so me and you eat

She's daddy's little gal
Daddy's little gal

She knows daddy ain't washed up yet
'Cause I'm livin' in the studio, lost, upset
When I find myself after all this music
I'll be watching her performin' her set

She might wanna be a nurse or a vet
But I'll lop that off 'cause music's best
I cruise for the press like
Who's gonna make an album this good?
Daddy, yes

He's the best and it's two six now
Still no one's testin', most man are resting
I can't rest 'cause you're seven months right now
And I get a big pain in my chest

If I don't see you, I've gotta ring up and check
But one day, we'll receive a big cheque
And fly round the world, I'll show you revision
All I want in return is respect

She's daddy's little gal
Daddy's little gal
Daddy's little gal

Yo
And she loves Dada, there's no one above Dada
Dada stands for Big Dada
It's my duty, I'm back with a banger
I'm a real striker, not a goal hanger

You'll soon see Leah on a stage show banner
Leah, this money's too good by the hour
And it pays by the minute, live PA, that's why I'm in it
See I love money like Nana and Raymond, Patrick and Macca
Them man showed me how to be a stacker

And now I've gotta show you, school you
Throw you in the deep end
'Cause the world's gettin' madder
When you get old the streets will get badder
That's why you've gotta climb the musical ladder
She won't get clouded, just in the manor
I ain't sad, I'm happy I had her

 Not bad round me
 Wanna see D try and how me

Me, I don't mind, see through the clothes that blinds
I'm waiting around, not holding a time
I'm racing around that golden mile
I've been laughing and joking a while

But it's not funny some days, don't wanna smile
Hit the road like are you ready?

But I ain’t got a problem, I’m just feeling energetic,
See, people come on Twitter saying ""Wiley you're pathetic"",

All I need for me to live is music don't forget it,
When you try to put the pressure on and take away the credit
I’m living on my own merit,
Your merit I do not bread it,

If you got a problem, get it out into the open,
Don't matter what you say cos my vibe is never broken.
My CD's gonna change a couple people when I show em,
It’s not that I am arrogant, it’s just because I know ‘em,
It's only cos they know me, I’m a don,
And I display it in the song (I display it in the song)
I can do it for the ladies,
I might explode how I'm feeling like the bomb,
They do it for attention but I do it cause I’m me,
Show me all the figures that I said I wanna see,
Said I got an eight, I was happy with a three,
After that I got a two, then I got another three.
Cause I make it to the finish line,
Travel around the globe,
Walking in the snow and the gravel on the road,
It's hard for me to show ‘em all the talent that I hold,
My spirit is a winner, like the winners that I know!
Here we go!

the goals I reach are not near ones the further than limits
I block her out so when I'm looking through my mind she ain't in it
Can I be free for a minute, can I be me for a minute?
The thoughts I have can be dark ones, even be smart ones
Know I'm gonna have a couple straight from the heart ones
Tell you what I think I will until I depart mum
It's you that I lived for, I am the first and the last one to love you lots

Whats better than thinking about the ones you love
Nothing much when you're thinking about the ones you love
I feel the same when I'm in the floor, see the sun above
Unconditional like bills paid when I run them up
No one here to help you pain now you're gonna moan
No one here to save the day now you're all alone
Wish I was born with a golden spoon in my mouth
Fact is I wasn't so, I'm coming from a colder zone


And when the sun falls down I'll be up again
I never close my eyes,
And if the dawn might break I'll see nothing when (nothing when)
My thoughts are only you and my mind is over you
My thoughts are over you and these words are all for you (all for you)

I wanna see you happy, I wanna see you smile
'Cause you're been trespassing, and you won't leave my mind
Now even think about this, call me say, yes nan
I'm 31 now I'm still saying yes nan
You had to replace my mom, dad 2 parents in one
I know your proud staring at your grandson
I found a job I like like, got the flat, the cars, the bike, the quad I
like
Because of you I'm tireless in every single song I write
Had a golden life, wanting people to honour mine
Tell 'em while I'm here, cause one day I'm gonna die
And when I'm I'm gone I want my music still playin'
And when my people listen to this track, it's gonna make them wanna cry
I ain't gonna lie, I think about my scene to say the games better is a must
now I gotta fly
My talents gonna shine for surely, fam I know it, I work 'round the clock,
I don't stop at night.

If you lose then get off
Winners stays on, winner plays on, winner like the Malmaison
I’m a winner, my 5 like a break for 20 thousand and people don’t never put hate on
I don’t wanna hear a thing that you wanna say
Pipe down on twitter trying to put a face on
Silly choice, silly move, idiot things
Silly me, silly you, delete your thing
I’m bigger than this, i’ll defeat your king
God knows I try calm but he goes in
He’s just an MC but but goes in
There style is whack like its a repo thing
I’m going in, I ain’t coming out
I got a style and it ain't running out
But my life’s running out, we don’t live forever
However my music can live forever, whatever
Tell them ? and you can’t fool me but you act quite clever
Sun, sea and sand but that's my weather
Whether or not you like me silly whatever
I count money, i’m a troll this cheddar
I don’t care if the your the rawest brother
On my own I'm running this estate no fair like blam I'm a tourist fella
What know then ? you must have thought I was a climb like Calvin
I don't take care of chipmunks My name ain’t Alvin

I got back to the war stop bringing it on
You play ball and you think you Lebron
You might spend 5 days picking a song
By then i’m on a racetrack winning along

Like what type of mic are you doing it on
You know half good MC's ruin a song
I'm like why are they doing it wrong that's long
I’m evolving, in the free zone
Like Major Colvin', everybody's and
I stack that money till i’m blue in the face

I'm in the title I'm killing rivals

Them ever getting everywhere weren't likely

I’m not a show off
But when i’m about it’s a road block
Stop thinking of old songs
Move on go and change your old top
Them spitters are good but their flows not
As tight as mine I'm like an old knot
They got bullied in school like an Allcot
God I'm in control I'm not a robot
Here's how I evolve I can't hold on
So many chatting on the cliff but they roll off
Climb back up but by then I float off
In souls confront until it goes off

Cos it ain't so fast
I teach you these ways now there ain't no class
I picked it all up somewhere in the past

And your mind place plays tricks
Until you realize its
All stored in your head
You wanna wipe it
If a fan likes a bar I wanna write it
So I can say I wrote it 
And then they quote it
When the times appropriate

My days gonna surface
And its all gonna come back to me 
Like don't worry son cos your life weren't worthless
Your a guy that your guy roots on the earth with

Musical talent
Tryna teach a musical balance
Learn that you haven't
I thought that I made it here way back when I found out that I hadn't

Welcome to Zion
Welcome to Zion
Welcome to Zion
Welcome to Zion 
Welcome to Zion 

Its a place that I want to be in
The queens and princesses that I'm seeing
Got me in a daze like what am I seeing 
The best spices of the female being

I'm a fine one stick to her like glue
I know her but babe I like you
I wanna chill in the garden, I'm in the mood
Your in the kitchen cooking up our food

While I'm here looking up a tune on a Macbook Pro
Yeah I know, accurate flow
I'm blessed with the gift
that's why I'm on the mic
'Cause I give an immaculate flow
no high grass and trees

I'm here because I make masterpiece 
I made after peace
Full of sun then an after breeze
Foods so good here let the master eat

Welcome to Zion
Welcome to Zion
Welcome to Zion
Welcome to Zion
Welcome to Zion

I gave my life to a constant cycle
If I try rest it don't work
My new place I'm focused on my homework
For this focus here I'm doing my homeworks
And I'm an old boy, ain't tryna so search
I don't want a front on a strip of an old murk

I wanna take a walk through the mountains
Drink fresh berry juice straight from a fountain

See the sun rise up in the morning
See the sun go down on a calm ting
No bad vibes ever in this zone
Its been a while ain't seen nothing alarming
All the mums tell your daughters that Kylie is charming
I'll wife her, what are you doing in arin'
Its not a joke stop parring
Call the mama I'm looking for a different darling

Wiley,"I was on a path to the limelight
Now I’m on another one it’s a night flight
When they say I’m a star I say thank you
It’s all due to the scenes that I ran through
So I keep flyin the flags for all people
No messing about we’re all equal
Vibe alive in the club when I roll in
I get around with the crowd when I’m roaming

Everybody right now can you hear me
Through the speakers turn me up if you hear me
Ayaya ayaya ayaya ayaya
Everybody right now can you hear me
Through the speakers turn me up if you hear me
Ayaya ayaya ayaya ayaya

They should know I bring vibes on a club night
Keep the crowd hyped up brother party
Red, she wanna say words in my earlobe
Reminds me there’s an hour of the party left
See the fireworks, celebration, team winning the Grey Goose amazing
Send them Jaeger bombs I got a craving
So many women I don’t wanna stop raving
They should know I got tunes for the gyal dem
Once the ladies are there see the man dem reach
They wanna leave there with a number
Check the peng ting she’s gonna hang with me
I’m skanking all round the party I’m skanking
I got girls to the left and girls to the right
When we’re at the bar we ain’t ramping

Everybody right now can you hear me
Through the speakers turn me up if you hear me
Ayaya ayaya ayaya ayaya
Everybody right now can you hear me
Through the speakers turn me up if you hear me
Ayaya ayaya ayaya ayaya

Wiley called me on the iPhone
He said get my passport told me to come through
Put your sun cream in your suitcase
When I arrive causing a heat wave too
Got my SnapBack and my vest on
Looking at the hot girl with the red dress on
Light skin with a beautiful body like Kim
So I had to get my Kanye West on
She told me she’s feeling my jewellery
She said that she’s in love with my Jesus piece
I told her to look again closely
It’s not Jesus baby it’s JME
And I was like babe come over
I don’t bite girl come a little closer
Come a little closer
I don’t bite girl come a little closer

Everybody right now can you hear me
Through the speakers turn me up if you hear me
Ayaya ayaya ayaya ayaya

You know I don’t usually party
But Skepta and Wiley said its a hype
I can’t find my phone or my car keys
Like Zippy Tafari said on the mic
The vibe is off the richter
And I can’t even tweet a picture
I’m on the dance floor the joke is
I never had a drink but I’m acting the drunkest
She’s staring like I’m a weirdo
Or then again maybe she likes me
I’m not supposed to be here though
Haven’t got a wrist band for the VIP
No triple A pass but I’m partying with the stars
Yep, I can’t complain I just enjoy while it lasts

Everybody right now can you hear me
Through the speakers turn me up if you hear me
Ayaya ayaya ayaya ayaya
Everybody right now can you hear me
Through the speakers turn me up if you hear me

She got my lights switched on
My lights switched on
She lookin' my eyes like I like this tone
I wanna know what side she's from
I seen many girls but I like this one
Told me she was a west side lady
Had a few friends but they were all shady
Now she on the solo team
So nobody can send her crazy
Too many friends and not enough true friends
Made her wanna go and move to new ends
I care though, 'cause even if my life gets lonely
It's all good, to keep few friends

We connected I asked her out and then she accept it
I think she gets it

Turn the lights on, Beyonce
When you not cried ever I must say
I like the dimples on her face
Young black and a tat on her rip cage
That sexy dress the only part that's revealing yes
That's why I'm respecting her
Rejecting them and selecting her strength

We roll out when we want

Jamming to my favorite songs
All the stars are on the ground right now
But that won't be for long
We go back up into the sky and shine
Put my high beam on
I'm liking the vibe she's on
Looking into my eyes
I might want to talk and take a walk
But I'm avoiding spies

They see me vibing with the blames
And ladies by my side
I see them with a smile like hi
Willing to chat my name on the sly
That's when I raise a glass up high
I want this moment for life

I'm surprised I ain't dead
I took more shots than Curtis
All my freshers
That know I'm the freshest

Met Wiley at one six
Household name in the game now
And I ain't ever touched one brick

Wiley,"I've been in the wrong system, the wrong territory, for way too long
If I say it's right and I show it to Johnny, looks back at me like it sounds wrong
Who am I making music for then?
(Ask him) Me, the label or him?
I go macho on people eat their tunes 'cause really Wiley goes in
I'm torn between catering for me and the fans, (I'm going mad)
I only hear my big hits where people go to get tans, (Beach)
What's that to me is they want easy, I can't show skills
For the wayward music they want brother, I don't want mils (I don't want mils)

I step back looking in from the outside
Wondering if it sounds right
Sounds good to me
On this path it's good to be (Yeah)
You could do the hook for me (Okay)
Or I could do the hook for free (That's right!)
Got a rave booked at one
Leave an hour gap then I'm booked til three (uuhh)

Where do I start with this one
I was on the outside trying to get inside
With the tools outside I got inside
In a matter of time I was doing a lot
Might see me with a lighty on the block
Wiley told me to murk this
So I gotta make this worth it
When I spit, spit to kill, not only Fruity Loops that I kill
I'm a lord of the beats fam
Check YouTube, every man knows that it got real
Five bills for a grime beat, that's real
Had 'em scared and shook like I just got signed and dropped, let go from the deal
I'mma stack till I get mils

I step back looking in from the outside
Wondering if it sounds right
Sounds good to me
On this path it's good to be
Yeah, you could do the hook for me
Or I could do the hook for free
Got a rave booked at 1
Leave an hour gap then I'm booked til three

I don't know who's approval man's seeking
Or what crowd man's tryna be reaching
Don't wanna make tunes that are bait
I make music for an acquired taste
Started doing this thing 'cause I loved it
Not to make tunes for the general public
Our music is made to measure
Wiley is a national treasure
Not everybody is gonna like it
If they don't like it, fuck 'em
Man really started from the bottom
Walk in to radio, man ain't forgotten
I used to pay 5 pounds a week to get heard
Now I get five bags for spoken word
Personally I think man's winning
And it's only the end of the beginning

Ain't heard a word from him, he gone mizzle
Can't be a bear if you don't really wanna grizzle
Shit's gonna happen if you're keeping it rizzle
Yes, talk is cheap like Lidl
Our manna old school like piggy in the middle
I'm in season, I'm in season, I got riddim

Manna big fish up in the game, no sprats
House on the beach, no hoods, no hats
And we're swimmin' in the sea with the prawns and the crabs
This type of life's all good, no bad
I feel so glad, I'm free, alive and kicking
For years I've been kicking up a dust and winning
For years I've been picking up a mic and spitting
Telling everybody how my whole team's living
Telling everybody how the whole scene's raving

It was the London streets that made me

Said I'm gonna work so I find the cheques
Now I'm tied in, and the money flies in
Tell a business team I'd like to invest
See it's all fun and games till you end up broke
I don't want my career to end up a joke

On a bad one you'll be looking for hope

Drink 'nough beers before the game, what d'ya call that? Georgie Best MC
Listen, I don't rest MC
You man sleep, that's why you're not the best MC
You man are part time, never had beef
Now you're on the mic like a bulletproof vest MC
I'm a double, precious Tek MC
Separate heads from necks
I was in the shadows, I came to the light with a path
Us spitters who wanna be first and never be last
I've been ahead of the game, I've been ahead of the craft
I wanna laugh
Come sailing along like a bus
With the flow I'm like rah, what the ras?
I'm a striker, y'all better pass, get my triple A passes
I'm sitting with the stars
Listen up, I ain't normal, I'm sicker than my bars
Driven myself crazy, I've been in every condo
I like to fly by on my black Yamaha, that's winging
Some man do the crime and talk but that's singing
Not many man have been in the wars that I've been in
I can work here but it's not a place that I could live in
Getting new money though but I've already made a killing
I've already made a scene, I already live a dream
And the king's road's lonely, you can't go with him
When it's time for a test
Man ah man have gotta move swiftly 'cause you don't want a knife in your chest
In the hood every day, it's heroin, living like they're dead
Made it, now you're lying in your bed
It's like yo, has anybody seen my flow right here, cuz?
Live in your ears like earplugs
Keep myself away like rare dubs
What makes you so scared, I'm sure fear does
On the real though, I stand up and face it
The levels high in my scene, that's why I embrace it
Let me go on and enjoy what I created
Man will jump on the stage and go ape shit
For years I've been killing it, trust me
Swear down, I will never get rusty
My lyrics dem will rough up your lyrics like rugby
For the work I put in, the fans love me

This one ain't free but it's the liberty
Street divinity
Me and Will's tyranny
And this one's willing me to rise like Pyrenees peaks and I'm lyrically
In the sky and then I'm right through infinity
Forever after, Devs be the master
Hit 'em with the Carleone thing[?] Godfather of grime
Don't charter to ride through parts of
This precinct when it gets darker
Don't think you can stand the heat
You can't stand this peak
I'm like a million and one lightyears way past of an artist's reach
Mary, I'm hard to beat
Now think deep
About this collabo
Historical events unravel
Like I went Middlesex, I came to Harrow
My man said he feel paro
Bloody cuffs, heart on my sleeve
This shit feels like beef to me
When I spit and my arms start swiniging, I'm bringing
More raw shit than a Beckton works
Smell it and know why Kano writ it
Wrote it, fuck me, alright, don't quote it
Focus, look, now I'm back and it's hopeless
Comparing me with these seeds
Too rare a breed of MC and the flow shifts
More than once a minute
Getting off like dharma, I come and I kill it
A Dagenham'er strapped with a bunch of lyrics
That bang harder, where the fuck's the gimmicks?
There ain't nada
I've got the heart and spirit they can't harbor
Silly men pass the limit and then scarper
When it comes on top with the urban legend, I get 'em like Carter

Spitters can't better these levels of terror
I leave my brain in my car but my head is together
I make a team of dons quit when I'm put under pressure
Rate Devlin, why? He's a grime treasure
In grime, I've lined my catalogue up, prime seller
I'm never too far from the hype that I set up
I step up like a bredda who's livin' in nice weather
At work, puttin' words together with ice letters
I spray, make a big tree lean in the road
Trees drop on your house to leave them a cold
Trees drop on your car, the windows smash
Eski brought O2 Indigo back
But this whole time, fam, I've been holy in grime
Even a first time who don't know me in grime
But you love my stage vibe when I'm holding a mic
I'm a pro now, bro, I jump over the spike

Any hardcore fan of grime
Go mad when you hear this bang inside
I got the keys like pianists, black and white
I've been a beast in the scene all my adult life
Ever since Will said ""Hello, hi""
I was sat in the shadows, high
Concocting the maddest vibe
With a way less narrow sight
Than a Homosapien eye
X-Ray, make way for my death ray
Nikola Tesla reborn to a next stage
Technology stole our children
The world's in debt and our men are all templates
I'll bring ten crates of my best mates
Puttin' up my worst and best traits
Converse in a verse with dead saints

Can't go wrong, when it's straight from the heart, you can't go wrong
If it's a real vibe then you can't go wrong

When it's straight from the heart, the music gets heard

I used to go and get what I'm given
Now I go and get what I'm worth

Wiley,"Everyday, bro, we've gotta stay battling
Gotta stay fighting, gotta stay striving
Gotta stay dreaming, gotta stay believing
Gotta stay scheming

I broke down a few more barricades
Got me a few more accolades
Used to look forward to the weekend
Now every day's like Saturday
Surrounded by stars
Come chill with the constellation
Then she asked me what my real name was
And killed the conversation
Sometimes I've gotta scratch my head
Like big man ting on a level
Only my mum and dad call me Junior
What makes you so special?
No Rolex timepiece
No Hublot kettle
But still I know when it's time to jump in the car
Put the foot to the pedal like

Yeah, I don't care about VIP
I've got very important places to be
While I'm asleep, I'm making a beat
Girls in the house getting naked for me
What I'm tryna say is basically
Never get a joke man mistaken for me
Corn on the curb if a man diss me
My niggas got the biscuits in T
Santa Claus used to miss my house
So I decorated my own Christmas tree
Ring man's phone if he think's it's beef
What do you mean, ""who is this, blud?"" It's me
My niggas been on crime
Don't get it twisted 'cause I don't beef online
My niggas violent, my niggas loopy
Something you ain't seen on Vine

I don't want a like, I don't want a follow
Diss me today, link me tomorrow
I've got goons that can't leave the country
Above the law, under obbo
I know pain, I know sorrow
I know empty, I know hollow
I just flew my Gs out to Amsterdam
And I told them ""thank me tomorrow""
Cuh man have been in the kitchen
Experimenting with the whipping
And you see, the road ting and the music ain't mixing
Would've thought man was playing baseball
Way man are outside pitching
Never been a punk, never been a victim
Wanna hate on me? Wanna hate on Storm?
Fuck that, let the kings in

I start ringing MCs
Go radio, I start swinging MCs
I was in the trenches, everyday grinding
You couldn't say a man weren't bringing MCs
I will pick up the phone, start ringing MCs
Bars inna my touch, bringing MCs
They know I've got Skeppy on my team
We were on road, living it, skilling MCs
Producers, plus we are living MCs
Bare vibes we have given MCs
I was there back in the day when it was garage
And them man said they wanna get rid of MCs
But them man couldn't get rid of MCs
'Cause since then, we've become bigger MCs
Some MC debts
Skibadee, Baseman and Trigga MC

Yeah, us man are blazing powers
Them man are blazing Benson
My bredrin said it's his birthday
Took him onstage with Drake and Section
Hate my niggas 'cause every day, it's another great invention
Wanna talk about loot? Then I bring the loot out
Talk about shootout? Better be a shootout like a western
'Cause I don't fear no man
Think you're a killer but your name ain't Cam
Oi, pussyhole, don't look in my span
'Cause you might get shot on the road like 28 gram
And you know who I am
Shower man down like Fireman Sam
Drive to your ends on a two-year ban
With Solo in the transit van
Nah, you can't diss my mum
Shots start fly out and man get bun
Fling on my black garments and dun
Dry skin between my index finger and thumb
I hate man like a nun
That's why I wanna buy a haunted gun
Can't get killed before I get to see my son
Them tings can't run
They got me thirsty for blood again
They got me talking crud again
They got-

Like North London, fam. You got the call from God to do something deeper, bro. 
Like, you got the call to go and make everyone look at everything else that is happening over here, fam. 
You get me? That's a deeper calling, bro. 
Like them callings there, 
It's not everyone's phone that gets that that ring ring there, you see what I'm saying, fam? 
Like super powers fam, super charged, bro

Like just being you alone, fam, niggas getting to watch. 
You're doing what you're supposed to do, bro. Cuh we ain't seen nuttin' like this happen before. 
Who's seen the country flip on its head like this, fam? These youts don't know what's going on, fam. 
They ain't got a fucking clue, fam. Independent to the T, fam. 
Love, brudda, man.

Start from scratch, forget the charts
Run up on me? I'm sorry, you can't
Warrior charge, warrior charge (ye ye)
I spit bars, I don't throw darts
Them type of games, I don't take part
Man smokes lemon, man smokes Gelat'
Ain't got a bass, got a rack, it's a blast from the past
Made the verse then mixed the parts
Five cards laid down on the tables, still I can't see no hearts
Don't say nothin' when you see me walk past
We spot a dog there always on guard
Might switch it up, start spitting in yards
Always getting involved, you're too fast
Not from the same place but worlds apart
If you don't want to see the end don't start

I don't know why but I won't ever bar
Three times a week I go to a bar
I keep some money inside a gold bar
The bar was low so I lift the bar
Anytime I got too much on that's a par
Lime on top of shots at the bar
I know you weren't sure if I would go far

Oh my word, yo
I spit a 16 bar, hot like tar
Soon be a star, get very far
Never gonna go away, permanent scar
Trust me this lyric is no joke lyric
When I draw my lyric
Make your new lyric look very old
Like a no go lyric, make no dough lyric
Can't match - if you think you can
Gonna draw for the war lyrics
Better go and get more lyrics
And make sure that they're your lyrics
There will never be a day when I spit poor lyrics
In war, draw 24 more lyrics
Spit like a Magnum .44 lyric
Hit you on the chest, leave you on the floor lyric
Next time never ignore war lyrics
Like heavy rain, yeah, I pour raw lyrics

I don't know why but I won't ever bar
Three times a week I go to a bar
I keep some money inside a gold bar
The bar was low so I lift the bar

Buy a lump I don't wanna tick three o's
Got the KFC, man have got the Dixy flow
They never break, you've never gotta fix these flows

Step up, step in, watch everybody step out
I'm back on the Dizzee like when a man first set out
If you ain't going for the jugular then brudda, get out
Land the I do what I gotta do, then I jet out
Jet out, man get out, the jets ain't private
I'll be in the aisle seat sitting in silence

None of them are fake, you can ask them
People who are looking a hype, I walk past them
Dons could be richer or poor, I won't class them
Dons could be ready for war, my bars spark them
My sound travels the seas, that's why I part them
I can be foul, poisonous dart them
But the gyal dem wanna hype if I (uh)
It's been a good year, couple wars, couple sick tunes
But now I've got a deal with a couple quick few
I will clash MCs, I will clash crews
You will know if you wanna try the choice you choose
I will roll up on my ones and bring twos
In the war, I don't get confused
You just get defused, nobody can't snooze
I ain't really got any points I wanna prove
But I gotta make a move

That means the crowd don't wanna hear you on the mic
For some reason, they're thinking that's hype
All they wanna do is sit and hear who they like
I've been killing sets in the middle of the night
My lyrical flow is flying high up like a kite
That's why you can't touch it cause we are not alike
I walk in the place like ""everybody's better than me
Hmm, sike"", yeah, that's hype
I can ride riddim as good as I ride bikes
Small bikes, mountain bikes and power bikes
But if I add flash for the wheelie
And drop down, bro, that's hype

Tell Lorraine, tell McCoy
I failed again, felt annoyed
Now I've got paper round
Me, Daily Star cause I sell the voice
Oi, it's the paper boy, I'm in effect
Don't like me? I've always been a threat
My only competition is the man in the mirror
My niggas or my silhouette
They know I'm a flamethrower
Make man lay low and lay lower
Anybody says that they can't get hold of me
Tell them niggas I'll be on the same blower
Who am I? The baddest MC that grime ever produced
The resident Eskimo goer
Culture vultures, they owe us

I see if I can turn a stack
I know you love practicing but
Me and my niggas were born burning tracks
Like yo, they know I'm that post-quitter
Mind that gyal there, she's a gold digger
Chatting 'bout how he didn't know I go with her
Push me far, turn me to a cold figure
Respect you do it, but man, I done it
Anybody from the elite, you know we run it
Here's what it feels like to win
Get rewarded after a hundred miles of running

Proving myself to non-believers

I will keep going till the wheels fall off 'cause
Even when I'm dead, my vibe will be alive

On point, man are fully in snap mode
Straight London, buy a couple flats mode
Late nights, might work on my rap flow
You're plain and I'm the loaded nachos

Used to waste money in my twenties
Now I've gotta keep an eye on where my cash goes
I can do it, I don't need to try
I can do it, I done it already, bro

I was not Wiley, I didn't have any flow, now

I provided all the pies, why would I lie?
Sorry if you've been deprived of

Looking for an easy route
Then I didn't wanna live that life

And some fast food, fizzy drink and an Uber account

I see some now but I'ma leave them there
Them words are not for me so they get aired

Some energies people are gonna go and pick
Won't fit them all
Some energies dem evil in disguise
Tricked them all
If I wanna bring 25 MCs out
I'll bring them all

I'm nang and I know it
Pass me the mic, I'll show it
If an MC breaks down like a car breaks down
Then I'll come along and I'll tow it
Man fix things, small and big things
Man are eagle, man have big wings
Take a look at all the cars on the roadside
You're small rims, man are big rims
I was thinking, don't tease that thought
Trust me, you don't really need that thought
Goodness, greatness, grief, that thought
Hold on, weight, let me see that thought
Saying I be the champ
Heavyweight, I'm in the ranks

If I do a song that's crazy and credit's to be given
I walk up and take the lot, I said
I ain't scared to get my hands dirty
A likkle hard work won't hurt me
I wanna make my live rep clean up

And you ain't seen me at a show for a while

Couldn't stop me even if you was a vulture

When I see eight green dots, then I'm charged up

From Roman disc days to start-up

I do it every day, I've gotta hit the jackpot
I hit the jackpot when they say the track's hot
Had bare records on the wall, it was looking like
A New Era hat shop, no backdrop
Played these meetings like a goalie here
Dem man saved couple shots but they couldn't stop that shot
I've got one main tool: my laptop

Let me tell you how man got here
Started off with the cracked software
All them plugins made man
So much money and it didn't stop there
Went on for years of my life
I was in the kitchen making riddims all night
Sound card, mic and a keyboard
And I wasn't looking for a reward
I was doing it, passion: the leader
Since Street and the fever
Any vision that I had was a real one
I'm a Logic user; a real one
Reach for a draw of the peng and then I build one
Wanted a scene and I built one

Oi, it's my tool, that machine
That MacBook Pro
MacBook Pro forever, trust me

Use that, get back, draw for the Mac
Ayy, yo, record, biggerman
Do the video and the artwork too
Yeah, man, all of that jazz
No, I never backtrack, black jeans, black hat
Mac in my backpack like I'm tryna war with a man
Quad core does more
Stay fit for what, rudeboy on a man
Ready fi get bill up, hard drive fill up
Gotta do works if you wanna be a winner
Anything I gotta do, I'm gonna do it quicker
Only relying on the brudda in the mirror
A me that, life, you can't CMD+Z that
Me done preed that, mad if you can't see that
Send out, I bring up the riddims
No, I can't ever relax

I take pride in what I do, it's why I've got a laptop
I do it every day, I've gotta hit the jackpot
I hit the jackpot when they say the track's hot
Had bare records on the wall, it was looking like
A New Era hat shop, no backdrop

Like it or not, I was at the start
You was saying ""stop dat"", we was in the dance
We were getting reloads inside clubs
We were getting reloads out in the park
Flew past everyone who had a heads-up
Time flew quick, then I had to get smart
Now it's a new day, everybody's got new ways
That's why I'm not living in the past
I perceived the whole game on the whole same as a ref
Started on the right but I came from the left
Born in the east but stayed in the west
Put my money down, I ain't changing my bet
Never been a goal-hanger cause I can dribble
I was in jungle spraying bars with Riddles
Used to blaze weed, eat food, get the giggles
See me in a sweet shop looking for the Skittles

What I've seen might just leave you in shock
Man are in the station, prison or dock
Man are on the street with MACs, knives and Glocks
And dons getting ran down, chased round blocks
Dons getting skied by multiple shots
Dons getting kidnapped, dons getting robbed
That's why I tell a don ""just go get a job""
Blud, I was on the roof, I was in the trenches
I was on the mic chatting 'bout six senses
I was on the radio, legal and pirate
I was in the hood when they first called Trident
Doors getting kicked off, guns getting found
How'd you think I produced the coldest sound?
I was in the zone, anywhere you go
You can tell a man this ain't a bogus sound

The level of my lyrics will never drop
You've been watching us years now
I've already written gold bars I could never top
Made sick beats I could never top
Couple ideas that will never drop
Started together in the game
Some man are so sick with it
But they will never pop
Me and my team will forever pop
I ain't gotta go and get a better job
This one's cool, we all get along

I got the tips you need for when you start up
Cah my flows them are sharp like
Sharper then when a man goes to the barbers
To get a mark up, pull up to the club door
Ain't gotta park up
You got a fly on your neck, you hark up
Want to hear me sarcastic? Let me sark up
Like, I ain't done shit for grime, I'm washed up
Couldn't afford to pay me, what I would cost ya

'Cause I know the talent God gave me was a niceness

I was a young boss
Learned from the best
Now I call the shots

Chasing numbers and views
I forgot about the vibe
Content, flows, I forgot about the mic
All of the things that keep your name ringing
When all of the fans of your song start singing
I said it before I got sidetracked
I realized had to bring the vibe back
I'm playing my role and that's a bossy one
In my twenties, used to be a flossy one
I call the shots, but I don't send man to the shop
Back with another one, ready or not
You might stream this song much on Apple or Spotify

Talking to all my bredrins 'bout where
Manaman's gonna take touring stops
Boss, 'nuff said
Won't stop working till I drop dead
When I call the shots bullshit stops
I make everybody fix up like Ofsted
There ain't no one above
So you can't extort no one I love
Or I start moving like my bruv
Anytime you see me wearing a glove
Boastin' because you got a start button
Man like me I don't push no button
Walked to the door, jumped in a whip
Foot on the pedal, gone, say nothing

Now I got a good understanding
Brace yourself when you hear I got an album landing
Manna soundman like Rampage
Manna soundman like Stone Love
Got my own dubs, got my own dubs

We won't build the weapons of war which looms over your heads 
We'll not feed the war machines that lead our youth to death 
We won't close our eyes to the atrocities which abound 

We won't stand and watch until we're six feet underground 

The future is our burden, we can't stand and watch 
As the world around crumbles, opposing armies march 
We work towards our goal: one nation - unity 
And you must be the convert who works towards world peace

Opposing lessened armies, they say are here to stay 
But no one knows until we try, what we all can do 
I won't watch children die, it's up to me and you 

Our world is divided, the boundaries have been drawn 
Ideas are decided by where you have been born 
You can't judge people by the government of their land 
They're flesh and blood like us - why don't you understand?

Where seldom is heard a discouraging word

Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day

The breezes so balmy and light
That I would not exchange my home on the range
For all of the cities so bright

He's likely no more to return
To the banks of the Red River where seldom if ever

With the light from the glittering stars
Have I stood there amazed and asked as I gazed
If their glory exceeds that of ours

Oh, I love these wild flowers in this dear land of ours
The curlew I love to hear cry
And I love the white rocks and the antelope flocks

Oh, give me a land where the bright diamond sand
Flows leisurely down in the stream
Where the graceful white swan goes gliding along
Like a maid in a heavenly dream

Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day",Home on the Range,2013

One Night Of Love
When two hearts are one,
A night to have and hold
When love is gone and starlight grows cold.

One Night Of Love
When love is all that I'll recall.
When at the break of dawn
I find my lover gone
I'll whisper with a smile
I've lived a little while
I've known One Night Of Love.

Wilfried Hyde-White,"Henry Look at her, a prisoner of the gutter, 
Condemned by every syllable she ever uttered. 
By law she should be taken out and hung, 
For the cold-blooded murder of the English tongue. 

Eliza Aaoooww! Henry imitating her Aaoooww! 
Heaven's! What a noise! 
This is what the British population, 
Calls an elementary education. Pickering Oh, 

Counsel, I think you picked a poor example. Henry Did I? 
Hear them down in Soho square, 
Dropping ""h's"" everywhere. 
Speaking English anyway they like. 

You sir, did you go to school? 
Man Wadaya tike me for, a fool? 
Henry No one taught him 'take' instead of 'tike! 
Why can't the English teach their children how to speak? 

This verbal class distinction, by now, 
Should be antique. If you spoke as she does, sir, 
Instead of the way you do, 
Why, you might be selling flowers, too! 

Hear a Yorkshireman, or worse, 
Hear a Cornishman converse, 
I'd rather hear a choir singing flat.
Chickens cackling in a barn Just like this one! 

Eliza Garn! Henry I ask you, sir, what sort of word is that? 
It's ""Aoooow"" and ""Garn"" that keep her in her place. 
Not her wretched clothes and dirty face.
Why can't the English teach their children how to speak? 

This verbal class distinction by now should be antique. 
If you spoke as she does, sir, Instead of the way you do, 
Why, you might be selling flowers, too. 
An Englishman's way of speaking absolutely classifies him, 

The moment he talks he makes some other 
Englishman despise him.
One common language I'm afraid we'll never get. 
Oh, why can't the English learn to set 

A good example to people whose 
English is painful to your ears? 
The Scotch and the Irish leave you close to tears. 
There even are places where English completely

Disappears. In America, they haven't used it for years! 
Why can't the English teach their children how to speak? 
Norwegians learn Norwegian; the Greeks have taught their 
Greek. In France every Frenchman knows 

His language fro ""A"" to ""Zed"" 
The French never care what they do, actually, 
As long as they pronounce in properly. 
Arabians learn Arabian with the speed of summer lightning. 

And Hebrews learn it backwards, 
Which is absolutely frightening. 
But use proper English you're regarded as a freak.

Why can't the English learn to speak?",Why Can't The English?,1964

I'm praying for peace on earth 
But why would someone 
Believe in death not life 

Here I am 
I wait for your love 
Like an angel 
I save light in my heart 

Tell me now, if you can 
Where was God 
When you changed 
Your guitar for a sword 
I listen to the voice of earth 
I feel her pain 
When I hear her 
Call for love 
Like a child in the dark 

Here I am 
I wait for your love 
Like an angel 
I save light in my heart 
For us",Here I Am,2007
Wilkins,"Y ahora sientate, en esta silla 
esta vez escuchame, sin interrumpirme 
hace tanto tiempo que, quiero decirtelo 
vivir contigo, es ya inutil 
todo sin alegría, sin una lágrima 
nada que decirte, ni en el futuro 
en tu trampa, tambien e caído 
el amante proximo, tiene mi sitio 
pobre diablo, que pena me da. 

Cuando te haga el amor 
te pedira mas y mas 
se lo daras, poruqe lo haces asi 
como dicimulas, se te hace comodo 
y ahora se quien eres, y no sufro mas 
y si nada crees, te lo demostraré 
y esta vez, tu lo recordaras 
y ahora desnúdate, como ya sabes tu 
no te equivoques, no me importas tu 
tu me desearas, bella sin alma",Bella Sin Alma,1983
Wilkins,"The sun in her hair
The tropical hymn
The smell of the sea
With her next to me
She's got the touch that I ache for so much
My muchachita
It's more than her eyes
More than her voice
More than her smile
That leaves you no choice
Straight from the pain yes of love
She was born Margarita
And if I could get back to that dream
I know she'll be there
Waiting for me
Margarita
In my dreams we are together
And our love goes on forever
When I awake, I'm not there
Mi Margarita
I will search until I'll find you
And the roses will remind you
And I will wake inside the dream

Me fui, viajé
Y años después
Tú con tu flor
No era ilusión
Entre la gente al buscarte un fusil me apuntaba
Te vi alejar
Y caminé
Cuanto soñar
Tanto cambié
Es increíble que estés frente a mí
Muchachita
De repente su mano sentí
A su casa yo entré
Y allí entendí
Margarita
Que tú siempre has sido mía
Eras tú mi compañía
Desde otra vida lo sé
Mi Margarita
Hoy que estás en agonía
Sé que es nuestra muchachita
La que nos une otra vez
Puso en sus manos la flor
Sus ojos cerró
My Margarita
En el cuarto surgió confusión
Todo el mundo lloró
Y fue feliz
Mi muchachita
Sé que sientes alegría
Ananana sé que anhelas
Que conmigo siempre estés",Margarita,1991
Wilkins,"Dicen que la vida te puede lastimar
Why dicen que el tiempo las heridas curaran
Me dicen que un clavo a otro clavo puede sacar
Yo se que algún día uno para de llorar

why ya no te llorare, yo ya no te llorare
Ya no te recordare, yo ya no te llorare

Si un día te acuerdas que fue lo que paso
Cuando te des cuenta que no hay otro como yo
Why cuando me llames a ver si quiero volver
Mi amor ni lo intentes de tu golpiza me canse

why ya no te llorare, yo ya no te llorare
Ya no te recordare, yo ya no te llorare

why el destino va pasando why las promesas van rodando
Why yo hasta me juego enredado en tu pelo
No quiero yo aceptarlo pero me muero yo de celos
No voy a ser el llanto que se escapa por tus dedos

why ya no te llorare, yo ya no te llorare
Ya no te recordare, yo ya no te llorare

No te llorare, no te llorare, no te llorare
No te llorare, no te llorare, no te llorare, no te llorare

Rat tat tat, all I hear is my hearing depleting
Cameras flashing, I’m getting tickets, my pulse is speeding

Dead to the world but then it’s like I feel the music raise my pulse

Son always know, my love is unconditional

Life is like a circle
Slowing turning on itself
And girl it took losing you 
To finally know how daddy felt
But we stood in this bedroom
A year ago today
Hangin' on to pride and anger
As we threw our love away

And before you slammed that door
You said, ""I hate you""
But tonight if only you could hear me say

That you can't stop my love for you
It'll be here that's a given
As long as I am living on this earth
One thing is true
You will turn away, forget me
Curse my name but love won't let me let you go
Girl always know
My love is unconditional

You will turn away, forget me
Curse my name, but you can even let me go
But you need to know
My love is unconditional",Unconditional,2004

Rifle tower to rip yo head off
For bread or soak in a puddle of brokeness and stress.

Who want to test the ""Champion"" like Buju Banton?
Plan to leave very few standin when you hand that cannon to me
Been in Dangerous Music like Bohannan

Went to clean over there on 8-8

Got me hoppin' fences
Droppin' rocks, but I'm survivin' from these snitches

Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye

Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
 
Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye
Wonder does she keep remembering
Promises of mine
When the moon is shining

Will Calhoun,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

So everyday I come in early just to wait for her
She'll sit at her desk
Pull back her hair then spray perfume
And as it fills the room
I just close my eyes and I'll start to fantasize

'Cause if she knew, would she come to me
If she knew, would she run to me
And then say, ""I love you""
Oh, I wonder what she'd do
I wonder what she'd do if she knew, baby

5 after 1 and usually she'd be back from lunch
And I start to think of all these crazy things
Oh where could she be, is there someone else
Someone whose living out my dreams
Why can't it be me
I'm gonna say what's on my mind when she returns

'Cause if she knew that I care for her
If she knew, I'd be there for her and always
I'd be true
Oh, I wonder what she'd do
I wonder what she'd do

'Cause if I could tell her
Say exactly what I'm feeling inside
I would give my all to you
Dedicate my life to you
Hold you tight and never let go

If she knew, would she run to me

Crystal ringlets paint a picture of a gold sunrise above

Little girl you're sad though all you have
Is visible to you within your heart
There stays a part that like the sky is blue

Shifting breezes, grace the inner spectrum of your glance
Leaves on branches, for your pleasure, perform a soothing dance

Little girl it seems in all my dreams your happiness is due
But still they last there in your past, events that make you blue

Thoughts of love are in your mind
Yet splintered hopes push them aside
A look at life is what you need to try, oh, oh

Upon your cheek, it lingers

And a table that feels your fingertips
Let it be me, let me be your love

Shares your pillow and watches while you sleep

So I thought that I would call you up
Just to spend a little time, it's not another sex call
You know I'm not that kind of guy

These feelings that I feel for you, girl, I can't deny
Wonder can I see you, come over to your place
And look into those big brown eyes, till I'm face to face
I'm changin' up my lifestyle and all that player stuff
I just wanna be with you, so I'm giving it up

Mine for a lifetime, a lifetime of love
I couldn't imagine it with anyone else
I can't afford diamonds and all that fancy stuff
They're material things but you can't put a price on love

Can you feel me reaching out for you?
Please, open up your heart
And let this love just shower over you

An angels come my way and put a spell on me
I'm in a daze, I can't believe it's true

Inside I feel brand new

You got me floating in my dreams and even singing way out load
You've got my heart so open wide sometimes I feel like I can fly
Way up high, you've got me riding on a cloud

How could you know just what I would need and more?
And how did you see what my heart was yearning for?
You looked inside and knocked down the walls of my pride

once again runnin' away with me.
It was just my imagination runnin' away with me. Oo
 
Soon we'll be married and raise a family (Oh yeah)

But it was Just my imagination once again runnin' way with me.
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me.
 
Ev'ry night on my knees I pray Dear Lord, Hear my plea;
Don't ever let another take her love from me or I would surely die.
Her love is heavenly, when her arms enfold me,
I hear a tender rhapsody; but in reality she doesn't even know me.

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

And by the light of that same star
Three Wise men came from country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

This star drew nigh to the northwest
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest
And there it did both Pause and stay
Right o'er the place where Jesus lay.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

Then entered in those Wise men three
Full reverently upon their knee
And offered there in His presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel! 

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
That hath made Heaven and earth of nought
And with his blood mankind has bought.

Born is the King of Israel!

And you know the night is always gonna be there any way.

Looking forward to a little afternoon delight.
Rubbin' sticks and stones together makes the sparks ingite
And the thought of rubbin' you is getting so exciting.

I always though a fish could not be caught who wouldn't bite
But you've got some bait a waitin' and I think I might try nibbling

There was a day, now dig this
There was a day, they call it the Jerk

But baby, you can bet your bottom dollar

Will Geer,"Well, the world has seven wonders, the travelers always tell
Some gardens and some towers, I guess you know them well
But the greatest wonder is in Uncle Sam's fair land
It's that King Columbia River and the big Grand Coulee Dam

She heads up the Canadian Rockies where the rippling waters glide
Comes a-rumbling down the canyon to meet that salty tide
Of the wide Pacific Ocean where the sun sets in the west
And the big Grand Coulee country in the land I love the best

In the misty crystal glitter of that wild and windward spray
Men have fought the pounding waters and met a watery grave
Well, she tore their boats to splinters but she gave men dreams to dream
Of the day the Coulee Dam would cross that wild and wasted stream

Uncle Sam took up the challenge in the year of Thirty three
For the farmer and the factory and all of you and me
He said, ""Roll along Columbia. You can ramble to the sea
But river while you're ramblin' you can do some work for me""

Now in Washington and Oregon you hear the factories hum
Making chrome and making manganese and light aluminum
And there roars a mighty furnace now to fight for Uncle Sam
Spawned upon the King Columbia by the big Grand Coulee Dam

In the misty crystal glitter of that wild and windward spray
Men have fought the pounding waters and met a watery grave
Well, she tore their boats to splinters but she gave men dreams to dream
Of the day the Coulee Dam would cross that wild and wasted stream",Grand Coulee Dam,1956
Will Geer,"Jesus Christ was a man that traveled through the land
Hard working man and brave
He said to the rich, ""Give your goods to the poor""
So they laid Jesus Christ in His grave
Yes, Jesus was a man, a carpenter by hand
His followers true and brave
One dirty coward called Judas Iscariot
Laid poor Jesus in His grave

He went to the preacher, He went to the sheriff
Told them all the same
""Sell all of your jewelry and give it to the poor""
So they laid Jesus Christ in His grave

When Jesus come to town, all the working folks around
Believed what he did say
The bankers and the preachers, they nailed Him on the cross
And they laid Jesus Christ in his grave

And the working people followed him around
Singing and shouting gay
But the cops and soldiers nailed him in the air
And they laid Jesus Christ in his grave

Well the people held their breath when they heard about his death
Everybody wondered why
It was the landlord and the soldiers that they hired
To nail Jesus Christ in the sky

This song was made in New York City
Of rich man and preachers, and slaves
If Jesus was to preach like He preached in Galillee
They would lay Jesus Christ in His grave

Yes, Jesus was a man and a carpenter by hand
His followers true and brave
One dirty coward called Judas Iscariot
As laid poor Jesus in His grave",Jesus Christ,1956
Will Geer,"It's a mighty hard row that my poor hands have hoed
My poor feet have traveled a hot dusty road
Out of your Dust Bowl and westward we rolled
And your deserts were hot and your mountain was cold

I worked in your orchards of peaches and prunes
Slept on the ground in the light of your moon
On the edge of the city you'll see us and then
We come with the dust and we go with the wind

California and Arizona, I make all your crops
And its North up to Oregon to gather your hops
Dig the beets from your ground, cut the grapes from your vine
To set on your table your light sparkling wine

Green pastures of plenty from dry desert ground
From the Grand Coulee Dam where the waters run down
Every state in this Union us migrants have been
We'll work in this fight and we'll fight till we win

Well, it's always we rambled, that river and I
All along your green valley, I will work till I die
My land I'll defend with my life if it be
'Cause my pastures of plenty must always be free",Pastures of Plenty,1956
Will Geer,"Have you heard of a ship called the good Reuben James
Manned by hard fighting men both of honor and fame?
She flew the Stars and Stripes of the land of the free
But tonight she's in her grave on the bottom of the sea

Tell me what were their names, tell me what were their names
Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James?
What were their names, tell me, what were their names?
Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James

Well, a hundred men went down in that dark watery grave
When that good ship went down only forty-four were saved
That was the last day of October we saved the forty-four
From the cold ocean waters and the cold icy shore

Tell me what were their names, tell me what were their names
Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James?
What were their names, tell me, what were their names?
Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James

It was there in the dark of that uncertain night
That we watched for the you-boats and waited for a fight
Then a whine and a rock and a great explosion roared
And they laid the Reuben James on that cold ocean floor

Tell me what were their names, tell me what were their names
Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James?
What were their names, tell me, what were their names?
Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James

Now tonight there are lights in our country so bright
In the farms and in the cities they're telling of the fight
And now our mighty battleships will steam the bounding main
And remember the name of that good Reuben James

Tell me what were their names, tell me what were their names
Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James?
What were their names, tell me, what were their names?
Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James",The Sinking of the Reuben James,1956
Will Geer,"I went down to the fishing hole
And I set down with my fishing pole
Somethin' grabb'd my hook and it got my bait
And jerked me out in the middle of the lake
Some jump 
I got sunk, baptized on credit

Fishin' down on th' muddy bank
Felt a pull an' give a big yank
I holed out three old rubber boots
A Ford radiator an' a Chevrolet coop
I handed it in
For National Defence

Settin' in a boat with a bucket of beer
Hadn't caught nuthin' but didn't much care
I guess I was pretty well satisfied
Had my little lady right by my side
Takin' it easy, yeah still waitin'
Worm been gone off-a that hook for a couple of hours

You go fishin', tell y' what to do
Go set down by the grassy dew
Take a piece of string, tie it on yo' pole
And throw it way out in th' middle of th' hole
Find you a good shady tree and then just set down
Go to sleep, forget all about it

Jumped in the river and went down deep
There was a hundred pound cat-fish lying there asleep
I jumped on his back and rode him all aroun'
Saddled him up and I came into town
People came runnin', lookin', dogs a-barkin'
Kids a-squallin'

Stagnate water's a stinkin' thing
Slick on top and all turned green
When the water goes bad, the fish all run
Sit all day and not catch a-one
Mud wallopers, jewgars
A few little suckers

I waded out to a sandy bar
And I caught myself a big alligator gar
Brung him home across my back
Tail was dragging a mile and a half
Flippin' and floppin'
Sold him for a quarter
Shot craps, got in jail

Early one mornin', I took me a notion
To go out a-fishin' in the middle of the ocean
Throwed out my line, I caught me a shark
I didn't get him home 'til way past dark
He's man-eater, tough customer
Just wasn't quite tough enough

Last last night I had me a dream
I was out fishin' in a whiskey stream
Baited my hook with apple-jack
Threw out a drink, drug a gallon back
Done pretty good till the creek run dry
I give the fish back to the finance company",Talking Fishing Blues,1956
Will Geer,"This land is your land, this land is my land
From the California to the New York island
From the Redwood Forest, to the gulf stream waters
This land was made for you and me
As I went walking that ribbon of highway
I saw above me that endless skyway
And saw below me that golden valley
This land was made for you and me

I roamed and rambled and I followed my footsteps
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts
And all around me , a voice was sounding
This land was made for you and me

When the sun comes shining, then I was strolling
In the wheat fields waving and dust clouds rolling
The voice was chanting as the fog was lifting
This land was made for you and me

Will Geer,"Have you seen that vigilante man?
Have you seen that vigilante man?
Have you seen that vigilante man?
I been hearin' his name all over the land.

Well, what is a vigilante man?
Tell me, what is a vigilante man?
Has he got a gun and a club in his hand?
Is that is a vigilante man?

Rainy night down in the engine house,
Sleepin' just as still as a mouse,
Man come along an' he chased us out in the rain.
Was that a vigilante man?

Stormy days we passed the time away,
Sleepin' in some good warm place.
Man come along an' we give him a little race.
Was that a vigilante man?

Preacher Casey was just a workin' man,
And he said, ""Unite all you working men.""
Killed him in the river some strange man.
Was that a vigilante man?

Oh, why does a vigilante man,
Why does a vigilante man
Carry that sawed-off shot-gun in his hand?
Would he shoot his brother and sister down?

I rambled 'round from town to town,
I rambled 'round from town to town,
And they herded us around like a wild herd of cattle.
Was that the vigilante men?

Have you seen that vigilante man?
Have you seen that vigilante man?
I've heard his name all over this land.
