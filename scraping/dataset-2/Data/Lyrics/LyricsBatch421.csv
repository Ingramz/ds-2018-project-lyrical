So to honor Him pa-rum pum pum pum

I have no gift to bring pa-rum pum pum pum
That's fit to give our King pa- rum pum pum pum

Shall I play for you, pa-rum pum pum pum
on my drum?

Jean-Pierre Zanella,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
[Chorus]

Jean-Pierre Zanella,"Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-ing, ring-ting tingle-ing, too,
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.

Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling ""Yoo hoo""
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, let's go,
Let's look at the show.
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, it's grand
Just holding your hand.
We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairy land.

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we,
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be.
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.",Sleigh Ride (La Promenade en Tra√Æneau),2005

Your blood like winter freezes just like ice
And there's a cold lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use

And did you think this fool could never win
Well look at me, i'm coming back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while i'm still standing you just fade away

Don't you know i'm still standing better than i ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah
I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah

And that ain't good

Jeana,"She was driving last Friday on her way to Cincinnati
On a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her mama and her daddy
With the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was running low
On faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was going away too fast
And before she knew
She was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both her lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even had time to crash
She was so scared she threw her hands up in the air

Jesus take the wheel
Take it from my hands
Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
So Jesus take the wheel

It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat
Sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said I'm sorry for the way
I've been living my life
I know I've got to change
So from know on tonight

Jesus take the wheel
Take it from my hands
Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance

De nuestro amor apenas queda nada

Estallar la noche fria y larga

Una locura un beso y a la fuerza 
Queda

Queda un gesto amable para no hacer la vida

ni un poco de luz en sus ojos profundos 
ni siquiera el reflejo 
de alg√∫n pensamiento que alegre su mundo 
hay tristeza en sus ojos

vive solo why necesita amor

como al sol lo necesito yo

Fashioned of starlight
Perfume of roses and dew

Our paths may sever
But I'll remember forever
Deep in my heart, dear

I've waited a lifetime for someone to say
The things you are saying to me
And darling, believe every word that I say
Just look in my eyes and you'll see
You smile and my tears have all melted away
My worries were all false and naught

It looks like the start of a beautiful day
Just holding you here in my arms
With you every day's a beautiful day
As long as I'm here in your arms

Kinda thought that all along
But now I'm a fallen star
Callin' you then from afar
Feel it's slowly gettin' cold
I'm betrayed an' robbed an' sold

Who needs tomorrow?
We've got tonight
Why don't you stay?

All of my hopes, fading away
I've longed for love, like everyone else does

All that great to stay so close to you
It's got to stop
Your damn last shot
Don't feel bad to make you really blue

I was chillin' with my friends at a party
You promised me some pleasure
And it seemed to be attractive to get naughty
So we went right upstairs together
It was clear to me as soon as we were ready
I would want you next to me
So I've asked you still that night to see me steady
And you said it was all right

And the time passed by, I started realizin'
You kept me in a prison
Felt like breakin' free and that was not surprising
I sensed the end has just arisen
Then I told you all about the situation
You didn't make me happy
'twas a peaceful offer for a separation
But you immediately got angry

There must be a guy who can supply some lovin'
I'm going out a single
Better know that what I feel for you is nothin'
Be sure that I will really mingle
An I'm dressin' up in leather for my darlin'
That makes him feel dynamic
An' I wont reply no more to all your calling
From now on I'll be polygamic",Stop,2001

Our flight tonight
It's over now
Our flight tonight
I wanna stop to be in love
But that surely comes as no surprise
The end is near
You're gonna take your love someplace
That is what I'm reading from your eyes
We can't make it good

You heard me right
And that is why
It's no use to try

You are in a way what I expected
You see I can say that I reflected
All the time

Don't you stay away

I would move the world to see you laughin'

If you're sure she won't think that I am just a fool
Serenading a mule.

Amigo mio, does she not have a dainty bray?
Que, esta?
She listens carefully to each little tune you play.
Oh, la bella senorita!
Si, si, mi muchachito,
She'd love to sing it too if only she knew the way.
But try as she may, in her voice there's a flaw
And all that the lady can say
Is hee-haw-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w
Senorita, donkey's feet are
Not so fleet as a mosquito
But so sweet like my chiquita
You're the one for me!

There's a light in her eye
Though she may try to hide it, she cannot deny
There's a light in her eye.
Oh, the charm of her smile
So beguiled Don Diego that he rode a mile
For the charm of her smile.
Amigo mio, is she listening to my song?
Que, esta?
No, no, mi muchachito, how can you be so wrong?
Si, la bella senorita!
Si, si, la senorita,
She'd love to sing it too if only she knew the way.
Her face is a dream, like an angel I saw,
And all that my darling can scream
Is hee-haw-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w

Not so fleet as a mosquito
But so sweet like my chiquita

Jeanette MacDonald,"Last night I lay a-sleeping
There came a dream so fair,
I stood in old Jerusalem
Beside the temple there.
I heard the children singing,
And ever as they sang
Methought the voice of angels
From heaven in answer rang,
Methought the voice of angels
From heaven in answer rang.

Jerusalem! Jerusalem!
Lift up your gates and sing,
Hosanna in the highest!
Hosanna to your King!

And then methought my dream was changed,
The streets no longer rang.
Hushed were the glad Hosannas
The little children sang.
The sun grew dark with mystery,
The morn was cold and chill,
As the shadow of a cross arose
Upon a lonely hill,
As the shadow of a cross arose
Upon a lonely hill.

Jerusalem! Jerusalem!
Hark! How the angels sing,
Hosanna in the highest!
Hosanna to your King!

And once again the scene was changed,
New earth there seemed to be.
I saw the Holy City
Beside the tideless sea.
The light of God was on its streets,
The gates were open wide,
And all who would might enter,
And no one was denied.
No need of moon or stars by night,
Or sun to shine by day;
It was the new Jerusalem
That would not pass away,
It was the new Jerusalem
That would not pass away.

Jerusalem! Jerusalem!
Sing for the night is o'er!
Hosanna in the highest!
Hosanna forevermore!",The Holy City,1991

Our conventions have been thrown all askew
And I know I'm out of date when I seek one mate

But somehow I don't believe in the modern plan
I want to wait for just one man

(It's more fun to love 'em all)
Kiss 'em all, short and tall)

I have another scheme
It's my only dream

One kiss, one man to save it for
One love for him alone
One word, one vow, and nothing more
To tell him I'm his own
One magic night within his arms
With passion's flower unfurled
And all my life I'll love only one man
And no other man in the world

Softly steal behind me

I'm not afraid of my own creation.
With all my heart, my heart is here for you to take.
Why should I quake? I'm not awake.

I hear the breezes playing in the trees above

Isn't it romantic
merely to be young on such a night as this?

Every note that's sung is like a lover's kiss.
Sweet symbols in the moonlight,
do you mean that I will fall in love per chance?
Isn't it romance?

My face is glowing, I'm energetic.
The art of sewing I found poetic.
My needle punctuates the rhythm of romance.
I don't give a stitch if I don't get rich.
A custom tailor who has no custom
is like a sailor, no one will trust 'em.
But there is magic in the music of my shears.
I shed no tears, lend me your ears.

Soon I will have found some girl that I adore.
Isn't it romantic?
While I sit around my love can scrub the floor.
She'll kiss me every hour or she'll get the sack
and when I take a shower she can scrub my back.
Isn't it romantic?
On a moonlight night she'll cook me onion soup.

We'll help the population,

To the land of desire where no heart can be false,
And the world shall be young again.

He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;

His truth is marching on. 

[Chorus]
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
His truth is marching on.

I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps;
They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps;
I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps,
His day is marching on.

I have read His fiery gospel writ in rows of burnished steel!
""As ye deal with my contemners, so with you My grace shall deal!
Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel,""
Since God is marching on.

He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat;
Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him; be jubilant, my feet!
Our God is marching on.

With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me;

It is seldom that a dream comes true,

That he'll appear.

Some day he'll come along, the man I love
And he'll be big and strong,  the man I love
And when he comes my way,
I'll do my best to make him stay.

He'll look at me and smile, I'll understand
And in a little while, he'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word.

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday,
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day.

From which I'll never roam, who would? would you?

Jeanette MacDonald,"I've never met you, yet never doubt, dear;
I can't forget you, I've thought you out, dear.
I know your profile and I know the way you kiss,
just the things I miss on a night like this.
If dreams are made of imagination
I'm not afraid of my own creation.
With all my heart, my heart is here for you to take.
Why should I quake? I'm not awake.

Isn't it romantic?
Music in the night, a dream that can be heard.
Isn't it romantic?

Moving shadows write the oldest magic word.
I hear the breezes playing in the trees above
while all the world is saying you were meant for love.
Isn't it romantic
merely to be young on such a night as this?
Isn't it romantic?
Every note that's sung is like a lover's kiss.
Sweet symbols in the moonlight,
do you mean that I will fall in love per chance?
Isn't it romance?

My face is glowing, I'm energetic.
The art of sewing I found poetic.
My needle punctuates the rhythm of romance.
I don't give a stitch if I don't get rich.
A custom tailor who has no custom
is like a sailor, no one will trust 'em.
But there is magic in the music of my shears.
I shed no tears, lend me your ears.

Isn't it romantic?
Soon I will have found some girl that I adore.
Isn't it romantic?
While I sit around my love can scrub the floor.
She'll kiss me every hour or she'll get the sack
and when I take a shower she can scrub my back.
Isn't it romantic?
On a moonlight night she'll cook me onion soup.
Kiddies are romantic
and if we don't fight we soon will have a troupe.
We'll help the population,
it's a duty that we owe to dear old France.
Isn't it romance?",Isn't It Romantic,2010
Jeanette MacDonald,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,

Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be

Will it fade way out of sight

Jeanette MacDonald,"There's a little brown road windin' over the hill
To a little white cot by the sea
There's a little green gate
At whose trellis I wait

Come smilin' through at me

There's a gray lock or two in the brown of the hair
There's some silver in mine too, I see
But in all the long years
When the clouds brought their tears
Those two eyes o' blue
Kept smilin' through at me

And if ever I'm left in this world all alone
I shall wait for my call patiently
For if Heaven be kind
I shall wait there to find
Those two eyes o' blue
Come smilin' through at me",Smiling Through,
Jeanette MacDonald,"Without a song the day would never end
Without a song the road would never bend

A man is born but he's no good no how
Without a song        
I got my trouble and woe but, sure as I know, the Jordan will roll        
And I'll get along as long as a song, strong in my soul
I'll never know what makes the rain to fall
I'll never know what makes that grass so tall
I only know there ain't no love at all
Without a song

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Jeanne Cherhal,"Il m‚Äôa demand√© si je voulais bien l‚Äô√©pouser, j‚Äôai dit oui tiens pourquoi pas, c‚Äôest l‚Äôoccasion de se marrer. 
Il m‚Äôa regard√©e, ses yeux sont devenus fonc√©s, c‚Äôest que les choses s√©rieuses, a-t-il dit, allaient commencer. Il m‚Äôa emmen√©e pr√®s de la rue des Hauts Pav√©s. Dans ce petit magasin de photos diverses et vari√©es, on a regard√© ces couples de jeunes mari√©s prenant intelligemment des poses et des airs d√©tach√©s.

On avait le choix (et m√™me l‚Äôembarras du choix) pour s‚Äôinspirer de l‚Äôun d‚Äôeux et immortaliser la joie qui nous transper√ßait. Qui nous rendait joliment gais, si heureux, si pleins de bonheur √† venir que j‚Äôen baillais. Ma ch√©rie, tu vois la fille au fond sous les lilas en amazone avec le bras d√©sinvolte, on dirait toi.
Oui, c‚Äôest un peu vrai, mais je lui trouve le regard niais‚Ä¶ C‚Äôest √† √ßa que je pensais quand j‚Äôai dit qu‚Äôelle te ressemblait.

Allez, on va se marier pour l‚Äô√©ternit√©.
Prenons la pose et sourions.

Pr√®s du footballeur, les bas jaunes dans les fleurs, la jeune √©pouse en crampons serre un ballon contre son c≈ìur. C‚Äôest l‚Äôamour du sport, le foot est plus fort que la mort, les serments dans les gradins: allez le stade  et je t‚Äôadore. Et l√†, quelle erreur, la mari√©e elle a peur.
Mais non c‚Äôest tout naturel puisqu‚Äôelle est femme de chasseur. Un gibier, encore si frais qu‚Äôon dirait qu‚Äôil dort, jet√© par dessus l‚Äô√©paule de l‚Äô√©poux. Vois le d√©cor.

Allez, on va se marier pour l‚Äô√©ternit√©.
Prenons la pose et sourions.

Devant la mairie. Des mains tendues vers le mari brandissent, tel un troph√©e, des roues de v√©lo d√©fra√Æchies. Monsieur est cycliste et sa photo tr√®s fantaisiste. Mais qu‚Äôen serait-il s‚Äôil √©tait sumo ou v√©liplanchiste ? Et l√† celui-ci, sous ses m√©dailles et son k√©pi, qu‚Äôil est attirant qu‚Äôil est beau et comme il me fait envie. Pour clore la liste, regarde-moi cet air triste de la fille qui regrette mais qui va entrer en piste.

Allez, on va se marier pour l‚Äô√©ternit√©.
Prenons la pose et sourions.",Les Photos de Mariage,2004

Ah ! Comme ce parfait inconnu semble parfait.

Tout ignorer de quelqu‚Äôun, y a rien de mieux pour le trouver sans d√©faut, sans lacune. Pour imaginer que son ramage se rapporte √† ses plumes.
Une jolie gueule un matin, √ßa donne envie de s‚Äôarr√™ter pour √©changer trois mots sans grand int√©r√™t,  puis se dire bon, les mots √©taient de trop.
Ne pas poser de question, √ßa vaut mieux pour garder sa premi√®re impression, et que cette impression-l√† est belle et douce.

Ah ! Comme ce parfait inconnu semble aussi parfait qu‚Äôinconnu.
Ah ! Comme ce parfait inconnu semble parfait.

Ne pas savoir d‚Äôo√π il vient, y a rien de mieux pour lui trouver le charme fou des m√©tis. Pour imaginer que dans ses veines coulent Oslo et Tunis.
Lui donner, √ßa co√ªte rien, des origines insolites et rares, c‚Äôest excitant. D‚Äôautant qu‚Äôassez vite on apprendra qu‚Äôil est de Lille ou Caen.
Ne pas poser de question, √ßa vaut mieux pour garder sa premi√®re impression, mais que cette impression-l√† est √©ph√©m√®re.

Ah ! Comme ce parfait inconnu semble aussi parfait qu‚Äôinconnu.
Ah ! Comme ce parfait inconnu semble parfait.

Ne chercher que l‚Äôincertain, y a rien de mieux pour √©viter la routine et l‚Äôennui. Pour imaginer que l‚Äôinconnu est ce qu‚Äôon veut de lui.
Quand on le conna√Æt enfin, l√† il devient si imparfait si charg√© de d√©fauts, qu‚Äôil en est charmant, unique, humain, sans doute encore plus beau.
Ne pas poser de question, √ßa vaut mieux pour garder sa premi√®re impression, mais que cette impression-l√† est inutile.

Jeanne Cherhal,"Le petit voisin s‚Äôappelle Jocelyn avec un P avec un F comme dans Martine. Le petit voisin il a un grain, de sel ou bien de sable, ou bien de caf√©ine. Le petit voisin habite au-dessus de chez nous, qui √©videmment sommes en-dessous. Il prend des cours de Ju-Jitsu mais n‚Äôest pas mauvais, n‚Äôest pas mauvais pour deux sous.

Et, dans tout l‚Äôimmeuble, crado mais sympathique, on se chicane, on se cherche, on s‚Äôengueule gentiment. Mais le petit voisin, il est total sto√Øque. Et d‚Äôailleurs il s‚Äôen fout car il est √©tudiant.

Le petit voisin dans son T1 a des instruments assez rares et insolites. Des percus, un masque malien, des cendriers et des grigris de bak√©lite. Il souffle dans un bout de bambou, un didjeridoo de Pier Import du N√©pal. Il joue √† poser des embouts sur des bouteilles, puis il aspire et devient tout p√¢le.

Et, dans tout l‚Äôimmeuble, crado mais acceptable, on se chicane, on se cherche, on s‚Äôengueule calmement. Mais le petit voisin, il s‚Äôassied √† sa table et il se roule un stick car il est √©tudiant.

De temps en temps, le petit voisin, pour justifier sa bourse accord√©e par la fac, fait un saut hors de son T1 et int√®gre un amphi bond√© comme un gros sac. Puis l‚Äôheure pass√©e, il rentre au port non sans avoir fait un d√©tour par chez Bubu. Une petite partie de Fighting Simulator, mais pas plus de quatre heures, il faut pas d‚Äôabus.

Et dans tout l‚Äôimmeuble, crado mais bon, √ßa va, on se chicane, on se cherche, on signe des p√©titions. Mais le petit voisin, en lisant des mangas, r√™ve √† des jours meilleurs car il est √©tudiant.

Sur le macadam citoyen que l‚Äôon pi√©tine quand on n‚Äôen peut plus de stagner, on voit passer le petit voisin. Sous des banni√®res il se plait √† revendiquer un peu plus de ci moins de √ßa. Un sitting au djemb√© devant la pr√©fecture. Les causes perdues, les grands d√©bats, on finit par tout faire flamber dans l‚Äôaventure.

Et dans tout l‚Äôimmeuble, crado et pas fini, on se chicane, on se cherche √† s‚Äôen rendre malade. Et le petit voisin, dans le panier √† salade, commence √† regretter ses cinq ans et-demie.

Et puis un jour, le petit voisin ira pointer quelque part pour bouffer un peu. Il s‚Äôennuiera et sera loin le temps o√π il r√™vait que demain serait mieux. Alors pour tromper l‚Äôamertume comme √† dix-huit berges en criant que √ßa suffit, il arpentera le bitume. Rien ne changera mais au mois √ßa d√©gourdit.",Le  Petit Voisin,2004

Jeanne Cherhal,"Comme j‚Äôaimais le dimanche, quand dans la R9 blanche de papa nous allions visiter la station. En famille on partait, mais jamais il n‚Äôavouait que c‚Äô√©tait la station la vraie destination. Pour ce genre d‚Äôaventure il faut une couverture, une balade officielle un peu plus consensuelle. Un but p√©dagogique, un pr√©texte classique.
Une simple sortie de fin d‚Äôapr√®s-midi.
Marcher en contournant l‚Äôhippodrome ou l‚Äô√©tang, dire bonjour √† grand-p√®re dans l‚Äôall√©e du cimeti√®re. Alors on y allait comme si de rien n‚Äô√©tait, et puis sur le retour on faisait le d√©tour.

Mieux que le vent d‚Äô√©t√©, 
que les embruns sal√©s, 
mieux que l‚Äôherbe coup√©e, 
√î effluve ador√© de la station d‚Äô√©puration.

Pour v√©rifier une vanne, pour constater une panne ou par pure pr√©caution, tout mobile √©tait bon m√™me apr√®s dix-neuf heures. M√™me le jour du seigneur, aller √† la station c‚Äô√©tait sa d√©votion. Alors je jubilais.
Car avec lui, j‚Äôentrais dans l‚Äôinqui√©tant palais dont il avait les clefs. Devant les eaux stagnantes je me sentais vivante, dans l‚Äôodeur de moisi je me trouvais jolie. Je n‚Äôallais pas, enfant, regarder l‚Äôoc√©an pour dans l‚Äôazur me perdre, mais au bord de la merde. Et sachez qu‚Äôen hiver, inhaler au grand air le ventre de la terre, on dirait du Baudelaire.

Mieux que le vent d‚Äô√©t√©, 
que les embruns sal√©s, 
mieux que l‚Äôherbe coup√©e, 
√î effluve ador√© de la station d‚Äô√©puration.

Depuis ces heureux jours, je nourris un amour pur et immod√©r√© pour les √©viers bouch√©s, les restes de savon qui engluent les siphons, les cheveux par poign√©es qui obstruent les bidets. J‚Äôai acquis la passion des canalisations.
Rien √† mon c≈ìur ne vaut la vue d‚Äôun ch√¢teau d‚Äôeau. Quand d‚Äôautres ont le d√©go√ªt des remont√©es d‚Äô√©gouts, je n‚Äôaime rien tant que leur doux parfum aqueux.
Qu‚Äôun lavabo douteux se pr√©sente √† mes yeux, qu‚Äôune baignoire inonde le sol d‚Äôune eau immonde, j‚Äôai la ventouse au poing et la technique au point. Intens√©ment, j‚Äôaspire. On dirait du Shakespeare.

Mieux que le vent d‚Äô√©t√©,

Jeanne Cherhal,"J'ai dans la bouche comme un go√ªt de venin
Comme un go√ªt de mauvais, mauvais vin
J'ai dans la bouche comme un souffle coupe
Comme un souffle √† demi √©touff√©
Et je reste toute seule √† regarder dehors
A compter, recompter mes tr√©sors
Tous les mots que je n'ai pas sus dire encore

J'ai dans la bouche comme un go√ªt de trop peu
Comme un go√ªt de quand on veut on peut
Comme un souffle perdu
Comme un souffle √† demi retenu
Et je reste toute seule √† regarde mes pieds
A ranger, d√©ranger des papiers
A m√©dire √† maudire √† √©crire, √† copier, recopier

J'ai dans la bouche comme un go√ªt de vip√®res
Comme un go√ªt de si je veux je perds
J'ai dans la bouche comme un go√ªt d'absolu
Comme un go√ªt de j'ai toujours voulu
Et je reste toute seule √† regarder le feu
A couper, recouper mes cheveux
A p√¢lir dans mon lit,
A sourire pour un oui
A courir sous la pluie

Mais quand je m'√©gare quelques jours
Loin de ces gares et de ces tours
De la ville qui raisonne
Mes pas me ram√®nent malgr√© moi
Dans un domaine au coin du bois
Un village qui frissonne

J'ai dans la bouche comme un go√ªt de myst√®re
Comme un go√ªt sal√© du Finist√®re
J'ai dans la bouche comme un go√ªt min√©ral
Comme un go√ªt de soleil et de Graal
Et je reste toute seule √† regarder la mer
A marcher dans les chemins de terre
A aimer √™tre l√† au bout de la terre",Finist√®re,2014
Jeanne Cherhal,"J'ai faim quand je te regardes
Je pourrai d√©vorer ton visage
Ta nuque et ton cou 
Comme un amoureux jaloux
Attends-tu √ßa de moi

J'ai faim quand je te regarde
Si tu pouvais m'offrir ton √¢ge
Mon coeur √©clate
Un jardin de nuit d'√©t√©
Moi j'attends √ßa de toi

J'ai faim je voudrais courir
Sur le bitume accroch√© de clous

Le parvis des √©glises et des temples
J'ai faim je voudrais mourir
Dans un √©clat de rire √† minuit
Dans un fracas de verre √† midi
Ma caresse arr√™t√©e sur ta tempe

J'ai faim dans mon vieux pays
Si je pouvais trouver le courage
de nager jusqu'au sexe de la terre
J'ai faim le jour et la nuit
Je ne veux plus dormir d'avantage
Parle-moi des semaines des heures enti√®res

Dans un √©clat de rire √† minuit
Dans un fracas de verre √† midi
Ma caresse arr√™t√©e sur ta tempe

J'ai faim de lait de riz blanc
De verbe f√©minin de musique
Dedans, sur mon cou 
J'ai faim d'un amour fou 
Tu sais j'ai faim souvent
J'ai faim de mots √©touffants
De perles d'eau de for√™ts antiques
De cris de naissance 
Et de bruit dans le silence
Tu sais j'ai faim de tout",J'Ai Faim,2014

Je suis l'angoisse du r√©veil

Et encore le pire est √† venir

J'ai toujours mal √† un endroit
Quoiqu'il arrive j'ai toujours froid
Je laisse pourrir la nourriture

Ce qu'il reste de noxolo
Joli cr√¢ne lisse et pantalon d'homme
Le front coll√© au carreau
Elle n'avait peur de rien
Peur de rien Noxolo

Elle dormait comme les pierres
Avant le lever du jour
Un peu √† l'Est de Johannesburg
Elle aime d√©couvrir ses pieds de poussi√®re

Elle buvait bien la bi√®re

Elle faisait sa pri√®re avant le lever du jour

I let you
We broke the ties that bind

And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you

And high above
The moon was new
And so was love

Jeanne Lee,"Laura is the face in the misty lights.
Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,
That you can never quite recall.

And you see Laura on a train that is passing through.

She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura,1961
Jeanne Lee,"You stepped out of a dream
You are too wonderful to be what you seem!

I want to take you away, away from the crowd
And have you all to myself, 
Alone and apart out of a dream, 
Safe in my heart

And I thought about you
I passed a shadowy lane

Winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream

And every stop that we made
Oh, I thought about you
And when I pulled down the shade
Then I really felt blue

I peeped through the crack
Looked at the track
Oh I'm going back to you
And what did I do, I thought about you

Jeanne Lehman,"She climbs a tree and scrapes her knee, her dress has got a tear
She waltzes on her way to mass and whistles on the stairs
And underneath her wimple she has curlers in her hair
I've even heard her singing in the abbey

She's always late for chapel but her penitence is real
She's always late for everything except for every meal
I hate to have to say it but I very firmly feel
Maria's not an asset to the abbey

I'd like to say a word in her behalf then say it Sister Margaretta
Maria makes me laugh

How do you solve a problem like Maria?
How do you catch a cloud and pin it down?
How do you find the word that means Maria?
A flibbertigibbet, a willow the wisp, a clown

Many a thing you know you'd like to tell her
Many a thing she ought to understand
But how do you make her stay and listen to all you say
How do you keep a wave upon the sand?

Oh, how do you solve a problem like Maria?
How do you hold a moonbeam in your hand?

When I'm with her I'm confused, out of focus and bemused
And I never know exactly where I am
Unpredictable as weather, she's as flighty as a feather
She's a darling, she's a demon, she's a lamb

She'll out pester any pest, drive a hornet from it's nest
She could throw a whirling dervish out of whirl
She is gentle, she is wild, she's a riddle, she's a child
She's a headache, she's an angel, she's a girl

How do you solve a problem like Maria?
How do you catch a cloud and pin it down?
How do you find the word that means Maria?
A flibbertigibbet, a willow the wisp, a clown

Many a thing you know you'd like to tell her
Many a thing she ought to understand
But how do you make her stay and listen to all you say?
How do you keep a wave upon the sand

Oh, how do you solve a problem like Maria?
How do you hold a moonbeam in your hand?

Well I thought I had seen good looking men in my time
That was before I met you
And I never saw one that I wanted for mine
But that was before I met you

[Chorus]
Well I thought I was swinging the world by the tail
I thought I could never be blue
I thought I'd been kissed
And I thought I'd been loved
But that was before I met you

Well I wanted to ramble and always be free
That was before I met you
And I said that nobody could ever hold me
But that was before I met you

With the sound of music,
With songs they have sung,

Of the birds that rise from the lake
To the trees.

My heart wants to sigh
Like a chime that flies
From a church on a breeze,
To laugh like a brook when it trips and falls
Over stones on its way
To sing through the night,
Like a lark who is learning to pray.

When my heart is lonely.

What I heard before.

Comme il √©tait tr√®s musicien, il jouait beaucoup des mains
Tout entre nous a commenc√© par un tr√®s long baiser
Sur la veine bleut√©e du poignet, un long baiser sans fin

J'ai la m√©moire qui flanche, je me souviens plus tr√®s bien
Quel pouvait √™tre son pr√©nom et quel √©tait son nom
Il s'appelait, je l'appelai, comment l'appelait-on?
Pourtant c'est fou ce que j'aimais l'appeler par son nom

J'ai la m√©moire qui flanche, je me souviens plus tr√®s bien
De quelle couleur √©taient ses yeux, je crois pas qu'ils √©taient bleus
√âtaient-ils verts, √©taient-ils gris √©taient-ils vertdigris?
Ou changeaient-ils tout le temps de couleur, pour un non, pour un oui?

J'ai la m√©moire qui flanche, je me souviens plus tr√®s bien
Habitait-il ce vieil h√¥tel bourr√© de musiciens
Pendant qu'il me, pendant que je pendant qu'on faisait la f√™te
Tous ces saxos, ces clarinettes qui me tournaient la t√™te

J'ai la m√©moire qui flanche, je me souviens plus tr√®s bien
Lequel de nous deux s'est lass√© de l'autre le premier
√âtait-ce moi, √©tait-ce lui, √©tait-ce donc moi ou lui?
Tout ce que je sais, c'est que depuis, je ne sais plus qui je suis

J'ai la m√©moire qui flanche, je me souviens plus tr√®s bien
Voil√† qu'apr√®s toutes ces nuits blanches, il ne reste plus rien
Rien qu'un petit air, qu'il sifflotait chaque jour en se rasant

La vie s'envole
Et quand on s'affole
H√©las il est trop tard
Pour tordre son mouchoir

Les hommes ils z'aiment
Les femmes √† hommes
Les femmes elles z'aiment
Les hommes √† femmes

M√™me parfois les nonnes s'enflamment
Pour d'abominables hommes des plages
Qui les entra√Ænent √† la nage
Ha mondes aquatiques et sauvages
Faites la vie d'cur√©s honn√™tes
Catherinette et nonettes
Brunes ou blondes
Minces ou rondes
Vous √™tes sur la mappemonde
Pour faire plaisir √† tout le monde

Et quand on s'affole

Jeanne Moreau,"Je suis indolent' 
Mes yeux sont vagues vagues vagues
Je balanc' mes hanches vaguement
Mes l√®vres remuent fard√©es de mots si vagues vagues
Les passants h√©sitent en me croisant
Le temps maudit toujours les press√©s
Le temps si lent pour celle qui attend
Le temps me berce de paresse
Alors je chante sans fin ce vague chant :

REFRAIN
Les jeux de l'amour sont comm' les jeux du hasard
Qui r√™ve de coeur souvent est servi de pique noir
Qui cherche un regard re√ßoit des rires moqueurs
Re√ßoit des rires moqueurs 

Les homm's non chalants
Me font des signes vagues vagues vagues
Et me frol'nt de l'√©paul' vaguement
Une √©treint' vague entre deux √™tres vagues vagues
C'est un peu renier le n√©ant
Le temps maudit toujours nous press√©s
Le temps pourtant qui va si lentement
Le temps efface mes caresses
Alors je chante  sans fin ce vague chant.

AU REFRAIN

Et je suis si trist'
Quand les homm's vagues vagues vagues
Se repos'nt dans mes bras vaguement
Vaguement divagu'nt dans leur sommeil si vague vague
Quand ils dorm'nt ils ressembl'nt aux enfants
Le temps maudit toujours m'opresse
Le temps qui va son lent balancement
Le temps emporte ma tendresse
Alors je chante sans fin ce vague chant

AU REFRAIN",Le Blues Indolent,1996
Jeanne Moreau,"J'ai la m√©moire qui flanche, je me souviens plus tr√®s bien
Comme il √©tait tr√®s musicien, il jouait beaucoup des mains
Tout entre nous a commenc√© par un tr√®s long baiser
Sur la veine bleut√©e du poignet, un long baiser sans fin

J'ai la m√©moire qui flanche, je me souviens plus tr√®s bien
Quel pouvait √™tre son pr√©nom et quel √©tait son nom
Il s'appelait, je l'appelai, comment l'appelait-on?
Pourtant c'est fou ce que j'aimais l'appeler par son nom

J'ai la m√©moire qui flanche, je me souviens plus tr√®s bien
De quelle couleur √©taient ses yeux, je crois pas qu'ils √©taient bleus
√âtaient-ils verts, √©taient-ils gris √©taient-ils vertdigris?
Ou changeaient-ils tout le temps de couleur, pour un non, pour un oui?

J'ai la m√©moire qui flanche, je me souviens plus tr√®s bien
Habitait-il ce vieil h√¥tel bourr√© de musiciens
Pendant qu'il me, pendant que je pendant qu'on faisait la f√™te
Tous ces saxos, ces clarinettes qui me tournaient la t√™te

J'ai la m√©moire qui flanche, je me souviens plus tr√®s bien
Lequel de nous deux s'est lass√© de l'autre le premier
√âtait-ce moi, √©tait-ce lui, √©tait-ce donc moi ou lui?
Tout ce que je sais, c'est que depuis, je ne sais plus qui je suis

J'ai la m√©moire qui flanche, je me souviens plus tr√®s bien
Voil√† qu'apr√®s toutes ces nuits blanches, il ne reste plus rien
Rien qu'un petit air, qu'il sifflotait chaque jour en se rasant

Pour fair' plier les peupliers que nous aurions plant√©s √† deux

It was spring
There was music I was listening
Then in the room somewhere someone began to sing 
This serenade made for remembering
 
A small cafe, Mam'selle
Our rendezvous, Mam'selle
The violins were warm and sweet 
And so were you, Mam'selle
And as the night danced by 
A kiss became a sigh
Your lovely eyes seemed to sparkle 
Just like wine does
No heart ever yearned the way mine does for you
And yet I know too well 
Some day you'll say goodbye 
Then violins will cry 
And so will I, Mam'selle

Never were, really are, nearly are?

Always unraveling you, you?
Running away could lead you further astray
And as for fishing in streams for pieces of dreams
Those pieces will never fit

The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear.

That I would rather be.

You asked me not to call you on the phone
There's something I've been waiting for to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song

You never knew there were honky tonk angels
Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows
I tried to be your one and only angel
But I'm not that kind of angel, heaven knows

I cried so hard the day you went and left me
'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

No, well, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
Well, you left the only one who ever loved you
And I'm back here on the wild side of life

There's somethin' wrong here, there can be no denyin'.
One of us is changin', or maybe we've just stopped tryin'.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
It used to be so easy, livin' here with you.
You were light and breezy, an' I knew just what to do.
Now you look so unhappy, and I feel like a fool.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
There'll be good times again for me and you,
But we just can't stay together; don't you feel it too?
Still I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it. (we can't make it)
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,

Love me, oh love me
Love me like nobody else can do
Need me
And just let me go one needing you 

Well if you want to try to make me over
And there's something else that fits your plan
It's alright if you would only tell me
What it's going to take to be your man

If you ever say you're going to leave me
Lord I don't know what on earth I'll do
I could never face a new tomorrow
If I had to face it without you

And just let me go on needing you.",Love Me,1998
Jeanne Pruett,"What's that around your head, is it a halo?
And what's that on your shoulders, is it wings?
You must be a walkin' piece of heaven
Or is it love that makes me see these things

Around you is a light that keeps on glowin'
When you speak do I hear angels sing?
You must be a walkin' piece of heaven
Or is it love that makes me see these things

When we met you gave me strength to face the world
I believe you're special, you're no ordinary girl

Am I seein' light or am I dreaming?
Do I hear the rush of angels wings?
You must be a walkin' piece of heaven
Or is it love that makes me see these things
Or is it love that makes me see these things

Still, I'm not happy don't you see
Big long Cadillac, tailor-mades upon my back
Still, I want you to set me free

Though you've given me everything money can buy

Jeanne Pruett,"I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine
There's gotta be a little rain some time
When you take you gotta give so live and let live
Or let go oh-whoa-whoa-whoa
I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden

I could promise you things like big diamond rings
But you don't find roses growin' on stalks of clover
So you better think it over
Well if sweet-talkin' you could make it come true
I would give you the world right now on a silver platter
But what would it matter
So smile for a while and let's be jolly
Love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can

I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine
There's gotta be a little rain some time

I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden

I could sing you a tune and promise you the moon
But if that's what it takes to hold you
I'd just as soon let you go
But there's one thing I want you to know
You better look before you leap, still waters run deep
And there won't always be someone there to pull you out
And you know what I'm talkin' about
So smile for a while and let's be jolly
Love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can

I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine
There's gotta be a little rain some time,
I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden",Rose Garden,2002

Right out of space your haunting face appears

There were other serenades broken promises we made
Why must I pay day after day with tears

Alone in my room I watch the ghost of you
Alone in the gloom once more I'm close to you

Melancholy serenade as the music starts to fade
I feel your kiss and then you disappear

That means I offer my life to you to be my own

I always felt save with you.

[Chorus]
Do the best adventures have to end
Now do we leave the scene as friends.
Is this how I'll find love and trust
From being so alone

Alone and lost
Is this where we say goodbye
Rather than just live another lie
Does it have to end?
I always felt safe with you.

There is a silence in our heartaches
The cry of the unknown

Jeannette Obstoj,"Maybe you don't feel it
You must be wearing armor
Maybe you don't hear it
You must have wax in your ears
Maybe you can't see it
But you've worn that blindfold for years.
Are you anesthetized?
Are you preoccupied?
Did someone cruel tell you lies?
Did you believe it?
Or have you seen it all?

[Chorus:]
Love is like a mountain
If you never try the climb 
There's no risk at all
Is there no challenge

Don't you know the edge where the innocents fall?
Maybe you can't hold it
But then it was never yours to hold
Perhaps you've gone crazy
Living with no one to catch your fall
Could you be hypnotized?
Have you been analyzed?
Did someone cruel tell you lies?
Did you believe it?
Or have you seen it all?

Now's the time to explore

Go for the root
It's the conflict between fact and meaning

And you can't scale the walls

'Cause there's an armed guard on the roof
Go for the root
Just found a crack in the foundations

When you watch the starving thousands
On the channel of your choice my friend
You're an audience for war
But you're always switching sides

It's like looking at a landscape
Through a microscope in the middle of the night -
Even half a revolution
Would only bring you light

Go for the root
You're so messed up by politics lady
There's nothing exotic in poverty
Go for the root

Where do you get your information
From a dream or a twenty four inch screen

Where did we leave our education
Do we have the same proof
At least to judge the situation
Do we understand morality
From watching television
Will we ever feel the ecstasy of free thought

His same old smile I'd always get I love him
Then his ride would come by and from the corner of my eye
I see them watch us say goodbye I love him

For she didn't show mercy for me
You should've seen her walk away into his waiting arms that day
And I watched him stopped to kiss Louise

The thought of what I'd soon be doing made me freeze
But without fear I found them there just how and where I knew they'd be

But I dare not beg forgiveness on my knees
For it was done with careful plans she'll never steal another man
For tomorrow they'll bury Louise

My fingers trace the letters of a work of art alone
And I recall the day that you carved it in a stone
Somehow I can see you now with books and coat in hand
You always waved as down the hill you ran

Cokes were just a nickel then and many were the times
The two of us would sip them as if they were village wine
And then on Graduation Day we bought the little ring
And said that carats didn't mean a thing

It looks like Chubby Adams gained two hundred pounds or more
And they've fixed up this old drugstore where we used to hang around
But whatever happened to Charlie Brown
Whatever happened to Charlie Brown I've asked almost everyone in town
No one here recalls the last time they saw him around
Oh whatever happened to Charlie Brown

Too bad about poor Becky Jones she's in a family way
She thought that they'd be married but the boy skipped town one day

Jeannie C. Riley,"You had quite good thing goin' with the girls you used to knowin'
You went up and down your list just like a yo-yo
And though it may be hard to stop it I'm afraid you'll have to drop it
Cause if you want me to love you that's a no no

I know you're used to goin' places with them lights and painted faces
Where the dancing girls do something they call go-go
I don't want to spoil your fun now but if I'm the only one now
And if you want me to love you that's a no no

You know a no no means baby shouldn't touch
If baby really loves his mama so much
So if you just can't resist 'em if they're not out of your system
And if there's some more wild oats you've got to sow
Just remember while you're sowin' I'll be a packin' up and goin'
Cause I've told you many times that that's a no no
[ steel ]
You know a no no means baby shouldn't touch
If baby really loves his mama so much
So if some old flame starts burnin' or if you should get to yearnin'
To go back to where those women that you know go
Don't come home expectin' mama's a waitin' here in her pajamas

And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine

To the California sun

Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine

I can try to repay
All I've taken from you
Maybe Lord, I can show someone else

Once there was spring and the flowers were gentle and sweet
I inhaled the goodness of love and my life was complete
I reached for a rose and its petals were crushed by my touch
Oh oh I love too hard and the thorns are now hurtin' too much

Winter comes on with no mercy for those unpreapared
Coldness creaps in on a heart that a dead love needs bared
Loving too much leaves a wreckage like that of a storm
Yes it does instead of the roses now I am holding the thorns

Fladness and sadness emotiones that everyone knows
When there is one the other can't be far behind oh no

And rows of little white homes that looked like castles all along the way

They had a private little scandal goin' on behind each castle wall
There was a Town Council meetin' on the day the story come to pass
Someone said Mrs Brown we think your little girl is livin' way too fast
She's been datin' older boys and stayin' out much later than she should
And there's been quite a lotta talk about it goin' round the neighborhood
Well Mrs Brown said since you brought it up I think I'll tell you what I saw
The day your daughter Ellie and the judge's son went swimmin' in the raw
Is that supposed to be a party what you call learnin' social grace
Cause if it is I think your people are in trouble here in Satan Place
I heard your neighbor's daughter Betty spent the summer in another town
They say she gained a little weight before she left but now she's trimmed back down
And now I wonder why the banker's son won't even look her in the face
We used to see 'em both together everywhere they went in Satan Place
They say the Mayor's daughter got another speedin' ticket just last week
They didn't charge for drunken drivin' even though she couldn't hardly speak
I heard she brags about the way her daddy gets free liquor by the case
From all those bootleggin' friends who make a killin' here in Satan Place
When Mrs Brown had finished talkin' no one dared to make a single sound
Until the chairman of the meetin' rapped his gavel and looked around
And as his eyes swept across the room at guilty looks on every face
He said that wraps up this meetin' of the Council of Satan Place

Everyday's a fight
Soon I'll have no tears left here to cry
Jump to the words I speak
When will somebody hear me?

I'm talking, I'm pleading, I need you to understand me
I'm screaming at the top of my lungs, it's so hard

Hear my lonely cry

Why can't you hear me?

I'm catching tear drops when I hear the phone ring
I wanna say so bad what's really wrong, what's hurting me?

What I need?

Why can't I just meet a total stranger
Fall in love and live happily ever after?
At the perfect ending to my story
The kind you only see in movies

Things never happen that way, do they?
In my reality the love just won't stay
It hurts like hell what I'm feeling
Is that the way love's suppose to be?

I've had enough, it's like a drug
I can't give up my feeling
I'm in his plans, my Superman, my baby

All I want is someone that could hold me down
That's gon' be around when I need him
Giving me that real love 'cause that's what he's about
Someone to ride with me that's what I need

I need someone whose sensitive is built up
Someones who really shows love
A real man, understanding but demanding
So proud and faithful to me

I need to feel like that there's someone I could run to
He gives me more of his time then he's got to
Gives me my space when I gotta go and do me
Supports what ever makes me happy

I've had enough, it's like a drug
I can't give up my feeling.
I'm in his plans, my Superman, my baby

All I want is someone that could hold me down
That's gon' be around when I need him

But hate when you're girl starts cheatin'

Opened your door and locked it
Then you found R. Kelly hiding in your closet
I knew you would start cheatin, before you even stopped it
I'm like when you double your money, I'm a profit...
Albert Einstein was smart, but I'm some wiser...
I'm a ladies man, your man is a womanizer
You gotta fight for love, can you make a fist

Right then I knew I was through
(Dorothy Parker was cool)
My pants where wet, they came off
But she didn't see the movie
Cause she hadn't read the book first
Instead she pretended she was blind
An affliction brought on by a witch's curse
Dorothy made me laugh (ha ha)
I felt much better so I went back 
To the violent room (tell us what you did)
Let me tell you what I did

I took another bubble bath with my pants on
All the fighting stopped
Next time I'll do it sooner
This is the ballad of Dorothy Parker

Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

I'm omnipotent
You claim to win battles
So when the beat starts
I'll punch the tree bark
And pass the chainsaw to a ? heart
Severing every animal
I'm doing dirt like earthworms
I'm sick and original
Boy, I gave birth to the first germs
I spit the acetate
To make your lips evaporate
The Master Ape
Bare hands will decapitate and bash your face
Pass the eight, sack of shake
Twisted in plasma tape
I came for y'all through the castle gate
I come across a substance yet I couldn't lacerate
Virtuoso is an unidentified flying object to make your space shuttle ?
So while you drunks look for a hook and say you masturbate
Telling 7L to sratch a plate
In due for respect I slap your face
Ask to make my specs, I'm a tackle ya
You're a neck and I'm Dracula
Have sex in the back of a black Lex or an Acura
Met with the, Jedi Mind Tricks
We rhyme sick and side ? for dime chicks
I'll strangle you, use my same hands to give you the Heimlick
So you can live to face more punishment from my divine lips

Silencing the devil that speaks with forked tongue
Taste my blade sharpness
Ranked in no class like Marxist
The heartless
Rise out of darkness
I'm the last head you should ever try to fuck with
Be the next memeber in the cast of my snuffed vics
Rough shit, don't even attempt sleeping
At war with the demons that live in infernal regions
Spawned from eternal semen bred flesh predators
Wings of the arms when you heels like Pegasus
Grabbing your leg, so you live to the heavenless
Drop this prejudice and follow me to Exodus

We ravenous
Exhume the tomb of Lazarus
You blasphemous
We bring war to pacifists
Tarantulas, burn flesh like a nine glock
Your mind stops from nine of my divine shots
a pine box is fine for a killer to run
Swing from vines and rhyme like Atilla The Hun
Bring the gun, your tounge is what I'm slicing
We slap tracks and attack like M. Bison
Ilohem, fuck the pagans we mark them
And take turns to burn religious doctrines
Concoctions of pain hits from eight angles
Locked in the brain to lacerate ankles

Yo, I rip mics, stick lames
Wreck nights, spit flames
Lead pipes, split frames
Kid ain't shit changed
Act trife
I grab the mic and bag your wife
Sacrifice you twice
Motherfucker in after life
Decimate your paradise
Burn tracks like thermostats
My personal attacks snap back to murder cats
I might advise
You type of guys should revitalize
Your man power, I sabotage the fire flys
With a dope rhyme
Take control of your soul
Grab a fourty fo' for the po's
Get your broken nose
Opponents go to shows
Now they know their robes damn hoes that fold my clohtes

Beware of the beast man.
For he is the devils pawn.
Alone among gods primates.
He kills for sport,or lust,or greed.
Yay he will murder his brother to posses his brothers land.
Let him not breed in great numbers,
For he will make a desert of his home,and yours.
Shun him, drive him back into his jungle layer.
For he is the harbinger of death.",Intro,2000

Holder of the sun
The Earth and the universe combined as one
An everlasting energy taking all forms
Blue skies on sunny days, terrible the storms
The one who tears down what you adorn
And curses the material things that you mourn
But look up in the sky 'cause I am the dawn
And the light that empowers your flesh as you yawn
Strong, undeniably so
Lif better known as a society foe
The deity glow reach into my center
I bet you feel pleasure and pain as you enter
The tormenter, pleaser, embracer, squeezer
As your skeleton crush
Your physical turns into gelatin plus
Due to over stimuli
You liquify
I send you back to the earth soil to quench the turmoil
When the ground splits
To swallow of corporations and cops
Give birth to rocks
So we can have solid ground on which to walk
Stand strong and talk
And write down theories in chalk on the side walk

So why bother
My whole flaw lines is harder
So bring the drama

I set off crowds, style wild like a circus
I seek through souls when I walk past churches

With the vicious intentions of denting your uvula
Bruising ya with text of a Harvard class

Have 'em come together in liquid stages
Then turn down the temperature and have 'em frozen into a solid foundation
Now added to that this well produced amazement
The crash is enough, to have the world tipped off it's axis a notch
It'll take the likes of, Jedi Minds to construct new longitude lines
In order to get around but now, you're askin' for too much
When mines put together
I'm like an alternative source of energy like, electricity generators
Separators of the wack rap, to the world reknownst individuals
Played in deuce parts life's nara-rators
Rhyme gladiators, is what we're referred as
Food for thoughts tooken offa ya plate instead ya serve thrash

And bring our own form of trinity to show y'all onto this

So I have the right to feel myself to the point of genetelia fondlin'

Applied chiropractically so rappers cannot come back to me
Simply outta respect, or suffer the consequence
The effect of which is that of absent father neglect
Wreakin' havoc, on egos speakin' magic
Castin' the curse on fashion emcees for region fabric
Send 'em wandering through the labyrinth
As far as cuttin' careers short on mics
I'm what the NYPD is to entrapment
The epitomy of have been, yet schooled
Engineers peep the structure of my mind
Now they wonder how the math went
L was made to ascend, which is evident by my descent
Spreadin' east to west like European settlements
Sequence, but even, I'm captured
Self destructive explosive devices reactin' from my mind is everlastin'
Which makes me a Trojan horse of sorts
Drainin' ya plasma until ya rhythm section hold the contorts
While snatchin' a arm in this sport
Drove off on ya squarely, then the warden report
And the single bullet theory

Hit them guys, in they eyes wid fuckin' shrapnel
Bomb they castle, set fire until they trapped in
Rap colossal, run rappers who wanna battle
Hologram wid two bad hands force you to grapple
Evil wraps you, reverse time and bring diseases
Christians will worship Allah and Muslims will worship Jesus
Kill all ya leaders, wid my savage lyrical thesis
Rip out my fuckin' heart and eat it before I'm defeated

About their ministry of justice
But if we didn't though
It would surely be cause for war!

Ok its time to get started..
Don't want to but the forces forced me
When it can't category allegory
They translated it for me

That's the reason I bend vowels when I spew from the mouth
Spit threw and out the very grotesque few are best
Burn through vests
Since the university of Budapest
Sitting in a room with a windowless view
Concentrating; looking at you
Freeze frame frozen at the very moment
The wormhole opens
You know Canibus has spoken
The circumference of a third eye so vibrant
To me, Ezekiel's Wheel was just a spare tire
My epithelial genetic fiber was forged in the protoplasmic fires in a black geyser
The explosion can described as a white Iris
When the absolute began, I don't know where I was
I musta just been a piece of micro dust
That's why I the fuck love mics so much
My micro, macro robotic rap flow
The Magna Carta of the entire rap world
Mayflower 2002 Phase 1
Adapt to the press of gravity is laid on my lungs
The theory of communication called cannons
Dissertation with a makeover in camouflage makeup
Light waves bend to the wake of bust
Mics buckle with white knuckles, metacarpals crush
Acid reflux all over your face, you fuck
Grab heart with bare hands,
Squeeze and spray blood
You iller than me? Gimme a call:

Dear boss,
You mind if I share my thoughts?
Psychotherapy is expensive, can you share my costs?
In a cushioned room with leather doors
Handwriting experts take a look at the letters I draw
Excessive graftedness, there's no space between words
Excessive cross-outs: it must be my nerves
Rhymes that vaporize dis-ablize and destabilize

Been dying to ask if Jedi Mind is the real
Well I'll let you inside my mind and you decide how it feel
I'm dying to kill
And bring to you apocalypse
I start a lot beef with lots of guns and lots of clips
Fuck the head, I'm aimin right for your esophagus
Hang you from a hook then drink the blood your body drips
I got the power of the lead a fucking shotty spits
And leave you weaker than the mafia that's Gotti-less

Mommy I'm sorry if my first letter made you cry
To be honest with you I don't think that I wanna die
Sometimes I feel like that I'm cancerous in others lives
That's prolley why I drink at night and sleep till 4 or 5
It's kinda hard walking through life with my distorted eyes
When I was younger I was stupid and I thought I thrived
I thought a lot about everything I said in the letter
And questioned whether or not if I was dead you'd be better
You think my shorty would be happy if I never met her
It's too late now mommy I could never forget her
Could never forget how she told me to love
'cause my father and my grandmother is always above
It's glory above you know that daddy taught me to thug
And everytime we was with nanny she'd bombard me with hugs[damn]
I MISS 'EM mommy and it's hard to believe
That I've grown and I don't understand that why did they leave

(Better to die and sleep then never wake and sleep 
Then linger on and dare to live when your souls life is gone)

I think they need me 'cause they hittin that age
And they ain't tryin to speak to Lenny 'cause they spittin' they rage
And mommy speakin of Lenny I think my brother need me
And we Italian so you know my mother loved to feed me
And it's the little things you do for me that make it worth it
Like when I play a joint that we did and you say it's perfect
And when Jay got knocked you knew that I was hurt
You told me to my heart in a song and it worked
I promised him I'd be there when he got out the bing
You ain't raised me to be a liar ma' that's not my thing
I told him that I'd hold him down the whole time that he gone 
They kept him locked in a cage but that's cool 'cause he's strong
So mommy keep that first letter I wrote you on the low

All I think about is crime, I forgot to buy a valentine
I'm out my motherfucking mind in a crowded line
Full-time murderer, no time to buy furniture
Rather re-clip burners than clip through the circular
Rather be a burglar than flip burgers
Any stitch at work will make me wanna commit murder
I am all thugs and drug friends, screams and blood streams
Guns that can sink submarines, clubs and love scenes
Thugs in hot tubs, queens and umpteens, Vodka, Rock of Love
Angels and adversaries, Raspberry Absolut
Hash and grass, V8 splash, passion fruit
Life is a battle, I'm out of sight with dim lighters around
Knife and a frown, just another night on the town
Endless horrors of manslaughter days in a row
Leave you all dressed up, no place to go

Jedi Mind Tricks,"I'm disgusted and dissatisfied, I don't need to fucking advertise
I'm a thief, I don't read the fucking classifieds
I like beef, I don't chitchat and fraternize
With police, pastors, or rabbis
I'm one of the bad guys, I never apologize
I don't just walk around with rocks and pocketknives
When it comes to homicide I'm not occupied
Murder's like oxygen to carbon dioxide
I don't know a lot about science and chemistry
My enemies take a lot of time and energy
When I'm not shooting I get iron deficiency
And I don't wanna have the guys look at me differently
I would rather have a gun than an epiphany
Can't really rely on tricks and wizardry
When I get irrational, that'll be practical
Niggas don't believe shit it's serendipity

We don't subscribe to y'all theory of non-violence
I rule with an iron fist, I define tyrants
I went down the wrong path, that's despite guidance
Yeah and y'all are soon to bleed
And I'm from the house of wisdom Haroon Rashid
A goon indeed, ras-clat, Junior Reid
Y'all overstayed y'all welcome, y'all refused to leave
Refuse to see that the universe is deathless
I define rhyme with divine mind efforts
It's grind time, I design rhyme methods
It's high time y'all enshrine my records

That's like standing on the block with no junk for the fiends

Long enough to see my company sucker-free luckily

The last rapper to move me Ras Kass what he doing
Rap after the blood bath having a movie
Gats strapped to my blue jeans, [?]

Jedi Mind Tricks,"There's absolutely no trick to looking 
Back on the great injustices of our time
And condemning them, we understand that, we've got that
The trick is always to look at what we're doing today
As if we're at some point in the future looking back
And figure out what the oppressions and the 
Injustices are that we're subject to today
And to get them out of our lives

Heaven said no
When you knocked out the door
Your fire could kill a child and a mom
Heaven said no
When you pointed your gun
Your face could make the joker wake up

Do you have compassion for everything alive?
Or animals don't matter to you, they can be deprived
Animals are individuals and have feelings too
They feel loneliness and happiness like people do
25 billion killed every year
The average person culpable for 90 plus a year
Overcrowded stalls, cages, and crates
No sunlight, no grass under their feet
They breathe, and they think, and they feel
But we feast, and we drink, and we kill
Factory farms inject stimulants and hormones
They're fed other cows, they're fed [?]
Hundreds of thousands are poisoned and blinded
To test cosmetics for the small, small minded
The rainforests being destroyed to raise cattle
Wildlife habitat became the battle
They spray farms with herbicides and pesticides
You know how much poison is in insecticides?
The same chemicals destroy topsoil and leak 
Into the ground and turn the ocean into oil
Genetically manipulated to grow larger
Only to be led to the slaughter
I don't see it as being a conquest
But people need to fight while there's still time left

[?] Combine the crates and tear them by the neck
They can't move their bodies and they could starve to death
They bang their heads from the psychological distress
Hellish conditions, that's not what I would call respect
Would you do that to your doggy or cat?
Do you really see the difference in a frog or a rat?
What's sacred to you here might not be sacred in Tibet
So who are you to say what should be eaten or a pet
It's a revolving door and it turn, you can't differentiate between the moral concern
An agitated pig might bite each other's tails
So they hack it off at birth and then they lead it into hell
Chicken beaks are seared off by farmers
But they call it debeaking, I call it torture
Boiled alive, you don't think it's karma?
Money come before mercy, that's the mantra
Cows give birth, their calfs are separated
Factory workers are either scared or they're jaded
The leather industry is tied to the meat industry
Inextricably they're both responsible for misery
A non-meat diet can slow the process of aging
Avoid toxic food, contaminants, and enslavement
Reduce global warming and end world hunger

You've been at the bottom, you see the hunger inside of you
Don't say what you won't do

When the going gets tough it'll drive you insane
See I done dodged a couple shots
Served a couple blocks
Hit a couple corners tryna shake a couple cops
A broke a couple rules
Didn't graduate from school
Cus I was busy hustling, man, I thought that shit was cool

See I gotta keep it real with you baby
Cus the shit I used to do is what made me
And I'm hopin I ain't gotta go back to the trap
Cus we really know that we don't want that

But if I don't make it home tonight
Tell my mama that I love her
Leave some flowers for my brother
Girl I love ya
But if I don't make it home tonight
Take some money to my sister
I don't ever want her chasin after niggas
Cus where I'm from

And they ain't no bad, ain't they just tryna make a way
And I ain't no different
So if I get missin
These are my last wishes
I hope you get them right

I know it's harsh
But this is how I feel, girl it's comin from the heart
I hope it doesn't end the way it had to start
Cus it started out bad but I made it this far
But everyone here ain't trynna see me make it
Or they only wanna see me win so they can take it

Being honest

See I gotta keep it real with you baby

But if I don't make it home tonight
Tell my mama that I love her
Leave some flowers for my brother
Girl I love ya
But if I don't make it home tonight
Take some money to my sister
I don't ever want her chasin after niggas

Would you miss me? Would you miss me?

Nowadays I sell hope, what you rather I sell dope?
What I sell is a lifestyle, naked bitches on sailboats
Foreign cars on a freight train for every nigga they railroad
Rent-a-cars we road run, money longer than train smoke
I done been in that same boat, I ain't letting this chain go
Representing my niggas down till they free 'em like Django
It's the same old, just the same old
How the game go, where the pain go, where the blame go
My mind wanders on a PJ, my momma brought up in the PJs
In the club sippin' P&J on the same arm as my Piaget (Woo!)

Trying to be fresh as forces, I swear they white as new ones
Streets taught us, streets raised us, had it less determined
Dodging jackers, dodging murder, federal escaping (damn)
Uncle got power, now I see him in another 10
We was set up just to lose, Lord know we trying to win
In the pursuit of this powerless masterpiece to the hour
You know it's platinum and waterproof, wear this bitch in the shower (ha-ha)
Yeah, we want finer things, plus a plug in the scale (scale)
Yeah, them plates shining like diamond rings at back can't you tell? (That's right)
In the hood I'm a king, King Arthur to the people
Except he got his on a Chariot, I got mine in a Regal (yeah)

Jeezy,"Keep it a thousand man
I'll show you what to do with them thousand grams
Sent from the kitchen as loud as a thousand pans
Soda sit the jacket, she smoke the shit out of cans
Sayin' Young you just might have you a business, you need a plan
Gave my lil' nigga some money, ""Go buy some pots""
""Take my rental and don't fuck around, the stove is hot""
Nigga why should I be playin' with your hair, the stove or not
Fuck you mean I ain't answerin' my phone? Your numbers blocked
If the folks hit the door right now, my heart would stop
We in this bitch playin' possum right now, me and the blocks
Got a nigga rollin' a spliff right now, he round the block
'Bout to play Bruce Lee on these bitches, karate chop

I hope my hustle don't offend nobody
I can give a fuck what you think about me
You know I like to turn up at the spot
Act a fool with the money
G told me keep it low-key
Now I got the whole house smellin' like smoke
And erryday, coulda smoked a thousand Newports
Really no difference between money and the time
Thin line do it all cause I can't be broke
And nigga there was over right now, you gotta get out her and get it
You a real one you gotta stay strong
Gave my house, my cars, my chain, my fame
Nigga give me my scale and my phone
All I need is 4 zones

Let 'em gossip and the hatin', just fuel determination
I go crazy with that money, I'm a fuckin' mental patient
See I started as a youngin', hustlin' for a club fit
Spend your last fifteen hun', you know that club shit
You fall off, you get back, can't give up, that shit whack
I hear links on my cell, I have blow in my nails
I hear hoes in my jeans, I weigh bees on them beans
They had stamps on them things, I broke bread with my team
Got them birdies in the attic, countin' currency in the basement
Aunty said there's somethin' on her silverware cause she can taste it
And I ain't goin' nowhere, you haters gotta face it
And if I lose it Lord I'm on nigga, I just need the basics

I hope my hustle don't offend nobody

That ambitious ass hustler, yeah I'm tryna post up
Till I can come through in the land, with the dozer
Hit it with that H2O, then it froze up
Back when they was goin' for the two fo', had it sowed up
They pulled me with this nina in this strap it be a felony
If I get through with this nina on my lap, I'm livin' heavenly
Speed ballin' like this shit a sprint, but this a marathon
Phone ringin' all day and night, like a telecom
If you a real hustler you gon' get that, he ain't get it
If you a real hustler you know how to stay committed
Between me and you got tired of sleepin' with them roaches
And I been havin' flashback, that's why a nigga focus

I hope my hustle don't offend nobody
I can give a fuck what you think about me

With the two double R sittin' in the back of my brain
Anywhere but here, that's what I told my sofa

Think you figured it out, but you don't have a clue
Think you on top of the world but the world on top of you
I started hustlin' for draws and now there's plaques on the walls
Think I'm sellin' my soul? Then you can come get 'em all
Trade 'em all for my dawgs, yea, I'm talkin' to you
Where did we go wrong? Because I don't have a clue
You just wanna hit the mall and buy a new pair of shoes
But it's real consequences nigga remember the rules
So I regret the day you ever serve that nigga
Took 5 years of your life, you didn't deserve that nigga
I guess power and pain look it's somewhat the same
I lost my dawg to the fame, I charge it all to the game

Please Lord forgive him, you know he got that thug in him
We lust for alcohol and we love women
And ain't nobody gave us nothin', so we drug dealin'
You know we coppin' Louie loafers just to thug in 'em
And when you made it that far, you should be makin' a toast
Got the seats reclined and I be doin' the most

I'm talkin' real luxury, don't feel a bump in the road
We ain't like the rest of these niggas that fall out over hoes
Thought you my nigga forever, thought that you could be trusted
Man I found out you takin' it, really had me disgusted
Nigga, who am I kiddin'? It felt like a heart attack
Cause I gave you my heart and didn't ask for it back
And to be honest with you, I really thought we were brothers
Fuck everyone in this world as long as we have each other
Woulda done anyything, took a trafficking charge
Everyday on my head just to see you livin' large
Gangster pitted it kills, gave you your first mill
And I ain't tell you to blow it, I ain't tell you to throw it
You fell a victim to pressure, yea, I know it can stress ya
But you're only a man, homie, I can't be mad at ya

Sippin' good in the back, I'm like fuck it, I'm bent
If it don't make dollars, then it don't make any sense
They sayin' I owe 'em dollars and that don't make any sense
Almost fell for the bait, almost fell for the hate
And I'm the same nigga that let you niggas eat off my plate
Saw that shit from the door, knew that shit from the go
I guess this how I go, sit back and laugh at the show
Remember back in the day a nigga took your shit
Told you don't put it there and a nigga stole your brick
Didn't I put ya back on, did I handle ya wrong?
When niggas start actin' weak that means it time to be strong
See I kept it so real, I ain't keep it real with myself
I'm gone be real with you niggas, I gotta be real with myself
And I'm gone be real with ya homie, look you don't got me convinced
Is this payback for my sins? I guess I gotta repent

Please Lord forgive him, you know he got that thug in him
We lust for alcohol and we love women
And ain't nobody gave us nothin', so we drug dealin'
You know we coppin' Louie loafers just to thug in 'em
And when you made it that far, you should be makin' a toast
Got the seats reclined and I be doin' the most

Gave it to him, it was all in plastic

If it‚Äôs on the floor nigga, its the floor money
If you brought it out to blow, when you got it from the blow
Then that‚Äôs why the fuck they call that shit blow money
Still the realest nigga in this, y‚Äôall know it
Kept it one hundred ‚Äòtil the day I came through
My nigga hit me up saying ‚Äúgoing out of town‚Äù
So I threw him fifty thou, told him ‚Äúbring me back two‚Äù
Not only had my fingers crossed, I prayed
Called this little piece up, got laid
Then he walked in, threw them both on the table said
‚ÄúFuck that shit, young nigga get paid‚Äù

Uncle died on the spot
Pop killed the family with heroin shots
Gave my life to the block

I came alive in the drop
Big body all white shit looked like a yacht
I got ‚Äòem five grand a pop
I had a plug in Saint Thomas on a trillion watts
Flew him back to the States, park 92 bricks in front of 560 State
Now the Nets a stone throw from where I used to throw bricks
So it's only right I'm still tossing ‚Äòround Knicks

Me and Emory Jones in the caravan
Took the show on the road out in VA
Dropped a couple off with Rolla in the PA (Real Rolla!)
Plug got shot started slowing up
Took a trip down to see how he was holding up
The wars on now he got shot again
This time he was gone for good then we got it in
Emory got knocked we was down 10

Same time poppin' Cristal, posing for pictures
Ol' smart ass nigga, half right and half wrong
Only problem is he still here and the money gone
Oh me, oh my, give me a natural high
When I think about the nights we threw them Rollie's in the sky
When I was so mother fuckin' clean on 'em, need a tie
Every hater in the club was just wishin' we would die
A hustlers life is filled with decisions he gotta make
Remeber when I got the news I was ready to cry late
Swear my levy was 'bout to break, lost religion and all my faith
I swear I seen the same shit happen to Shake
Can you imagine that look I had on my face?
Saw my nigga layin' still in a box what a waste
Got me feelin' sick, feelin' like I'm 'bout to vomit
I guess a loss ain't shit if you don't learn somethin' from it
Got me pacin' 'round the room, yeah NASCAR nigga

If I can get them things back down South I'll make a fortune
Fucked around and caught dawg with a nine, now it's a wrap
Gotta find a new game to conquer, I'm thinking rap
And there's a whole new game, new players, I gotta grind
Put them diamonds in my name and my chain, I gotta shine
Stunting everything'll real when we do break bread with 'em
Swear it ain't been the same since the day the FEDs hit 'em
And that's when I traded the scale for the microphone
Fade a few cars, got rid of my last four songs
And just like that, welcome back, my nigga home
Don't look me in the eye, something different, what could be wrong?

Same niggas that were hating back then, still in the way
I swear these niggas think my life is just bitches and Champagne
Iced out, Audemar, just to go with the campaign
Every night Rolls Royce's doing their damn thing
If there was ever a reason to wear all them damn chains
And why you keep a cup in your hand? To numb the pain
Niggas see you on something different, these niggas changed
And I ain't one for dry snitching, won't call no name
So really at the end of the day I can't complain
Five niggas gon' be happy with you and be happy for you
If them niggas scheming on ya demise then they ain't for ya

You better pay close attention to this, right
The killing must stop
Y'all black mens, it's bigger than that

As soon as you get banged up, right?
You'll be down that joint, with two suit and a lock up
No green dots, no visit
Your main bitch, you know where she be at, right?
Fucking your bottom nigga, your best nigga
So you better think
You think about what lives you're going to destroy
How many families you're gon' hurt

Bless me over and over again
I know he bless me the more I was sin

Glad I got another chance, see ya feeling's mutual
Protect me in the streets when the times got crucial
When niggas slung iron, you made me blind to the shooters
And now I'm all alone and I'm calling on you daily
Asking for forgiveness and I'm asking you to save me
Protect my T-lady , don't stress my old lady
And you and I know how much I love my seven babies

Staying up all night, smoking purp for hours
Can't even get my ass off to church a couple hours
Beefing with the enemy, teaching my son wrong things
In and out the hospital on that strong lean
Looking at the phone ring knowing it's my auntie
Knowing that she tryna pray for me, but I don't accept it
Now I'm selfish, not to others but myself
'Cause I'm feeling like nobody know my struggle, just my wealth
But that was then and this is now and since you gave me another chance
God man I'mma promise I make ya proud
Lotta times I screamed to ya, felt like you ain't hear me
You ain't heard me 'cause I wasn't worthy, sins dirty dirty

Dining at Katanas twelve phones on the table
Buncha horses parked outside, the lot a stable
If you know us then you know this shit is not a fable

Hit the club and everybody sweat and everybody's stressed

This is way before a nigga brought grey plaques in
So if i spray mac-10s, Bet you niggas lay back then
Like you sittin in a Maybach Benz
Yea I made crack grins but ain't a damn thing funny
I keep a pocket fulla do the damn thang money
I keep it comin with bottles of champagne dunny
So keep it bouncin till you pull a hamstring honey
These pimps just better have a gothic for me
I got them hoes starin like they got a problem with me
I got them boys slingin rocks in the lobby for me
I'm rich bitch, ballin just a hobby for me
