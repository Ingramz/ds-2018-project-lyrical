So to honor Him pa-rum pum pum pum
When we come
 
Little Baby pa-rum pum pum pum
I am a poor boy too, pa-rum pum pum pum
I have no gift to bring pa-rum pum pum pum
That's fit to give our King pa- rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum
Shall I play for you, pa-rum pum pum pum
on my drum?

Jean-Pierre Zanella,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
[Chorus]

Jean-Pierre Zanella,"Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-ing, ring-ting tingle-ing, too,
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.

Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling ""Yoo hoo""
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, let's go,
Let's look at the show.
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, it's grand
Just holding your hand.
We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairy land.

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we,
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be.
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.",Sleigh Ride (La Promenade en Traîneau),2005

Qu'on s'est rencontrés toi et moi

Ils sont tout blancs quand c'est l'hiver
En mars ils sont en marmelade

Avec un vieux corbeau malade

Pourquoi nous poursuivons toujours

On arriv'ra dans un pays
Plein de fleurs, d'oiseaux, de cascades

Your blood like winter freezes just like ice
And there's a cold lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use

And did you think this fool could never win
Well look at me, i'm coming back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while i'm still standing you just fade away

Don't you know i'm still standing better than i ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah
I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah

Jeana,"She was driving last Friday on her way to Cincinnati
On a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her mama and her daddy
With the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was running low
On faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was going away too fast
And before she knew
She was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both her lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even had time to crash
She was so scared she threw her hands up in the air

Jesus take the wheel
Take it from my hands
Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
So Jesus take the wheel

It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat
Sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said I'm sorry for the way
I've been living my life
I know I've got to change
So from know on tonight

Jesus take the wheel
Take it from my hands
Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on

Jeanette,"Queda que poco queda 
De nuestro amor apenas queda nada 
Apenas mil palabras 
Quedan
Queda solo es silencio que hace 
Estallar la noche fria y larga 
La noche que no acaba 
Solo eso queda

Solo quedan las ganas de llorar 
A ver que nuestro amor se aleja 
Frente a frente bajamos la mirada 
Pues ya no queda nada de que hablar 
Nada

Solo quedan las ganas de llorar 
A ver que nuestro amor se aleja 
Frente a frente bajamos la mirada 
Pues ya no queda nada de que hablar 
Nada

Queda poca ternura que y alguna vez haciendo 
Una locura un beso y a la fuerza 
Queda

Queda un gesto amable para no hacer la vida 
Insoportable y haci ahogar las penas 
Solo eso queda

Solo quedan las ganas de llorar 
A ver que nuestro amor se aleja

Jeanette,"Ni una simple sonrisa 
ni un poco de luz en sus ojos profundos 
ni siquiera el reflejo 
de algún pensamiento que alegre su mundo 
hay tristeza en sus ojos 
hablando why callando why bailando conmigo 
una pena lejana 
que llega a mi alma why se hare cariño 
El muchacho de los ojos tristes 
vive solo why necesita amor 
como al aire necesita verme 
como al sol lo necesito yo 
El muchacho de los ojos tristes 
ha encontrado al fin una razón 
para hacer que su mirada ría 
con mis besos why mi gran amor 

Ni su nombre conozco 
why ya quiero volver a encontrármelo a solas 
why en sus ojos de otoño 
dormir poco a poco olvidando las horas 
yo pretendo saber 
por qué extraña razón hoy sus ojos no ríen 
yo prentendo lograr 
con ternura why amor ver sus ojos felices

And clothes in the silver of tender moonlight

Within them a soft flame gently glows
The breath of the night wind is filled with the scent of the rose
Oh, love while I live, I will always enshrine
Your love in the heart of a rose

Deep in my heart, dear
I have a dream of you
Fashioned of starlight
Perfume of roses and dew

Our paths may sever
But I'll remember forever
Deep in my heart, dear
I'll always dream of you

I've waited a lifetime for someone to say
The things you are saying to me
And darling, believe every word that I say
Just look in my eyes and you'll see
You smile and my tears have all melted away
My worries were all false and naught

It looks like the start of a beautiful day
Just holding you here in my arms
With you every day's a beautiful day
As long as I'm here in your arms

Deep in my heart, dear

The things you are saying to me
And darling, believe every word that I say
Just look in my eyes and you'll see

Just holding you here in my arms
With you every day's a beautiful day

She'd love to sing it too if only she knew the way.
Her face is a dream, like an angel I saw,
And all that my darling can scream
Is hee-haw-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w

But so sweet like my chiquita

Jeanette MacDonald,"Last night I lay a-sleeping
There came a dream so fair,
I stood in old Jerusalem
Beside the temple there.
I heard the children singing,
And ever as they sang
Methought the voice of angels
From heaven in answer rang,
Methought the voice of angels
From heaven in answer rang.

Jerusalem! Jerusalem!
Lift up your gates and sing,
Hosanna in the highest!
Hosanna to your King!

And then methought my dream was changed,
The streets no longer rang.
Hushed were the glad Hosannas
The little children sang.
The sun grew dark with mystery,
The morn was cold and chill,
As the shadow of a cross arose
Upon a lonely hill,
As the shadow of a cross arose
Upon a lonely hill.

Jerusalem! Jerusalem!
Hark! How the angels sing,
Hosanna in the highest!
Hosanna to your King!

And once again the scene was changed,
New earth there seemed to be.
I saw the Holy City
Beside the tideless sea.
The light of God was on its streets,
The gates were open wide,
And all who would might enter,
And no one was denied.
No need of moon or stars by night,
Or sun to shine by day;
It was the new Jerusalem
That would not pass away,
It was the new Jerusalem
That would not pass away.

Jerusalem! Jerusalem!
Sing for the night is o'er!
Hosanna in the highest!
Hosanna forevermore!",The Holy City,1991

But somehow I don't believe in the modern plan
I want to wait for just one man

(It's more fun to love 'em all)
Kiss 'em all, short and tall)

I have another scheme
It's my only dream

One kiss, one man to save it for
One love for him alone
One word, one vow, and nothing more

And all my life I'll love only one man
And no other man in the world

Every note that's sung is like a lover's kiss.
Sweet symbols in the moonlight,
do you mean that I will fall in love per chance?
Isn't it romance?

My face is glowing, I'm energetic.
The art of sewing I found poetic.
My needle punctuates the rhythm of romance.
I don't give a stitch if I don't get rich.
A custom tailor who has no custom
is like a sailor, no one will trust 'em.
But there is magic in the music of my shears.
I shed no tears, lend me your ears.

Soon I will have found some girl that I adore.
Isn't it romantic?
While I sit around my love can scrub the floor.
She'll kiss me every hour or she'll get the sack
and when I take a shower she can scrub my back.
Isn't it romantic?
On a moonlight night she'll cook me onion soup.

We'll help the population,

Land of sweet romance where I love to go
And it falls at my door
In the gloom where the shadows dream

Someone I meet there waits for me
Someone tender as a lover should be
And I whisper each night
As I close my eyes in sleep

Dream lover, fold your arms around me
Dream lover, your romance has found me
I'm here in your spell, knowing so well
Dreams never tell

We two can leave the world behind us
Nobody indiscreet can find us
All dreams are of mine, secrets divine
I will share them with you

""Say you want me too"".

Young lovers all awake,
Night brings you waltz time
And the moonlight sings in waltz time.

Where are the fond couples clinging 
As round they go?

Young lovers all take heart,
Bright, siren beauty
Play your part now, do your duty,
Let your heart sing this refrain!
For it's waltz time once again.

Come away, come away to the ball,
Where the dreams that you dream will be true.
For the strings as they play seem to call,
Beckon and call to you.

Come away, come away to the waltz,
Float along on a lilting refrain.
To the land of desire where no heart can be false,
And the world shall be young again.

I hear the music play,
It carries me away.
All sorrows will have flown
When you are mine and mine alone.

Jeanette MacDonald,"Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;
He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword;
His truth is marching on. 

[Chorus]
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
His truth is marching on.

I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps;
They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps;
I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps,
His day is marching on.

I have read His fiery gospel writ in rows of burnished steel!
""As ye deal with my contemners, so with you My grace shall deal!
Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel,""
Since God is marching on.

He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat;
Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him; be jubilant, my feet!
Our God is marching on.

In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea,
With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me;
As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free!

It is seldom that a dream comes true,
To me it's clear
That he'll appear.

Some day he'll come along, the man I love
And he'll be big and strong,  the man I love
And when he comes my way,
I'll do my best to make him stay.

He'll look at me and smile, I'll understand
And in a little while, he'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word.

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday,
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day.

He'll build a little home just meant for two
From which I'll never roam, who would? would you?

I'm waiting for the man I love.",The Man I Love [From Strike Up the Band],1998

With all my heart, my heart is here for you to take.
Why should I quake? I'm not awake.

Isn't it romantic?
Music in the night, a dream that can be heard.
Isn't it romantic?

Moving shadows write the oldest magic word.
I hear the breezes playing in the trees above
while all the world is saying you were meant for love.
Isn't it romantic
merely to be young on such a night as this?
Isn't it romantic?
Every note that's sung is like a lover's kiss.
Sweet symbols in the moonlight,
do you mean that I will fall in love per chance?
Isn't it romance?

My face is glowing, I'm energetic.
The art of sewing I found poetic.
My needle punctuates the rhythm of romance.
I don't give a stitch if I don't get rich.
A custom tailor who has no custom
is like a sailor, no one will trust 'em.
But there is magic in the music of my shears.
I shed no tears, lend me your ears.

Isn't it romantic?
Soon I will have found some girl that I adore.
Isn't it romantic?
While I sit around my love can scrub the floor.
She'll kiss me every hour or she'll get the sack
and when I take a shower she can scrub my back.
Isn't it romantic?
On a moonlight night she'll cook me onion soup.
Kiddies are romantic
and if we don't fight we soon will have a troupe.
We'll help the population,
it's a duty that we owe to dear old France.

Jeanette MacDonald,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,

There's a gray lock or two in the brown of the hair
There's some silver in mine too, I see
But in all the long years
When the clouds brought their tears
Those two eyes o' blue
Kept smilin' through at me

I shall wait there to find

trop de choses te le prouvent, et tu sens bien qu'il est mordu

Pas dès demain, non, mais bientôt, il en est sur
Il te supplie d'attendre alors que tu ne fais que ça depuis bien trop longtemps

tu diras je reviens de loin
t’auras retrouvé

Il m’a regardée, ses yeux sont devenus foncés, c’est que les choses sérieuses, a-t-il dit, allaient commencer. Il m’a emmenée près de la rue des Hauts Pavés. Dans ce petit magasin de photos diverses et variées, on a regardé ces couples de jeunes mariés prenant intelligemment des poses et des airs détachés.

On avait le choix (et même l’embarras du choix) pour s’inspirer de l’un d’eux et immortaliser la joie qui nous transperçait. Qui nous rendait joliment gais, si heureux, si pleins de bonheur à venir que j’en baillais. Ma chérie, tu vois la fille au fond sous les lilas en amazone avec le bras désinvolte, on dirait toi.
Oui, c’est un peu vrai, mais je lui trouve le regard niais… C’est à ça que je pensais quand j’ai dit qu’elle te ressemblait.

Allez, on va se marier pour l’éternité.
Prenons la pose et sourions.

Près du footballeur, les bas jaunes dans les fleurs, la jeune épouse en crampons serre un ballon contre son cœur. C’est l’amour du sport, le foot est plus fort que la mort, les serments dans les gradins: allez le stade  et je t’adore. Et là, quelle erreur, la mariée elle a peur.
Mais non c’est tout naturel puisqu’elle est femme de chasseur. Un gibier, encore si frais qu’on dirait qu’il dort, jeté par dessus l’épaule de l’époux. Vois le décor.

Allez, on va se marier pour l’éternité.
Prenons la pose et sourions.

Devant la mairie. Des mains tendues vers le mari brandissent, tel un trophée, des roues de vélo défraîchies. Monsieur est cycliste et sa photo très fantaisiste. Mais qu’en serait-il s’il était sumo ou véliplanchiste ? Et là celui-ci, sous ses médailles et son képi, qu’il est attirant qu’il est beau et comme il me fait envie.

Tout ignorer de quelqu’un, y a rien de mieux pour le trouver sans défaut, sans lacune. Pour imaginer que son ramage se rapporte à ses plumes.
Une jolie gueule un matin, ça donne envie de s’arrêter pour échanger trois mots sans grand intérêt,  puis se dire bon, les mots étaient de trop.
Ne pas poser de question, ça vaut mieux pour garder sa première impression, et que cette impression-là est belle et douce.

Ah ! Comme ce parfait inconnu semble aussi parfait qu’inconnu.
Ah ! Comme ce parfait inconnu semble parfait.

Ne pas savoir d’où il vient, y a rien de mieux pour lui trouver le charme fou des métis. Pour imaginer que dans ses veines coulent Oslo et Tunis.
Lui donner, ça coûte rien, des origines insolites et rares, c’est excitant. D’autant qu’assez vite on apprendra qu’il est de Lille ou Caen.
Ne pas poser de question, ça vaut mieux pour garder sa première impression, mais que cette impression-là est éphémère.

Ah ! Comme ce parfait inconnu semble aussi parfait qu’inconnu.
Ah ! Comme ce parfait inconnu semble parfait.

Ne chercher que l’incertain, y a rien de mieux pour éviter la routine et l’ennui. Pour imaginer que l’inconnu est ce qu’on veut de lui.
Quand on le connaît enfin, là il devient si imparfait si chargé de défauts, qu’il en est charmant, unique, humain, sans doute encore plus beau.
Ne pas poser de question, ça vaut mieux pour garder sa première impression, mais que cette impression-là est inutile.

Ah ! Comme ce parfait inconnu semble aussi parfait qu’inconnu.
Ah ! Comme ce parfait inconnu semble parfait.",Parfait Inconnu,2004
Jeanne Cherhal,"Le petit voisin s’appelle Jocelyn avec un P avec un F comme dans Martine. Le petit voisin il a un grain, de sel ou bien de sable, ou bien de caféine. Le petit voisin habite au-dessus de chez nous, qui évidemment sommes en-dessous. Il prend des cours de Ju-Jitsu mais n’est pas mauvais, n’est pas mauvais pour deux sous.

Et, dans tout l’immeuble, crado mais sympathique, on se chicane, on se cherche, on s’engueule gentiment. Mais le petit voisin, il est total stoïque. Et d’ailleurs il s’en fout car il est étudiant.

Le petit voisin dans son T1 a des instruments assez rares et insolites. Des percus, un masque malien, des cendriers et des grigris de bakélite. Il souffle dans un bout de bambou, un didjeridoo de Pier Import du Népal. Il joue à poser des embouts sur des bouteilles, puis il aspire et devient tout pâle.

Et, dans tout l’immeuble, crado mais acceptable, on se chicane, on se cherche, on s’engueule calmement. Mais le petit voisin, il s’assied à sa table et il se roule un stick car il est étudiant.

De temps en temps, le petit voisin, pour justifier sa bourse accordée par la fac, fait un saut hors de son T1 et intègre un amphi bondé comme un gros sac. Puis l’heure passée, il rentre au port non sans avoir fait un détour par chez Bubu. Une petite partie de Fighting Simulator, mais pas plus de quatre heures, il faut pas d’abus.

Et dans tout l’immeuble, crado mais bon, ça va, on se chicane, on se cherche, on signe des pétitions. Mais le petit voisin, en lisant des mangas, rêve à des jours meilleurs car il est étudiant.

Sur le macadam citoyen que l’on piétine quand on n’en peut plus de stagner, on voit passer le petit voisin. Sous des bannières il se plait à revendiquer un peu plus de ci moins de ça. Un sitting au djembé devant la préfecture. Les causes perdues, les grands débats, on finit par tout faire flamber dans l’aventure.

Et dans tout l’immeuble, crado et pas fini, on se chicane, on se cherche à s’en rendre malade. Et le petit voisin, dans le panier à salade, commence à regretter ses cinq ans et-demie.

Et puis un jour, le petit voisin ira pointer quelque part pour bouffer un peu. Il s’ennuiera et sera loin le temps où il rêvait que demain serait mieux. Alors pour tromper l’amertume comme à dix-huit berges en criant que ça suffit, il arpentera le bitume. Rien ne changera mais au mois ça dégourdit.",Le  Petit Voisin,2004

Jeanne Cherhal,"Il y a la main qui me touche
des cheveux dans mon dos
et un parfum nouveau
et un goût dans ma bouche
que je ne connaissais pas 
il y a l’ombre sur le mur
de celui qui demain
sera déjà si loin 
que je ne serai plus sure
d’avoir connu ses bras

Mon amour est un cri immense et ininterrompu mais
cela ne s’arrêtera donc jamais ?

C’est un semblant de bonheur
bonheur court bonheur feint
bonheur vite défunt 
accorder à un cœur
le mien qui bat trop bas

et c’est un semblant d’amour
que d’ouvrir toujours ma porte
et de me sentir morte
quand je crois certains jours
que l’on ne m’aime pas

Jeanne Cherhal,"Comme j’aimais le dimanche, quand dans la R9 blanche de papa nous allions visiter la station. En famille on partait, mais jamais il n’avouait que c’était la station la vraie destination. Pour ce genre d’aventure il faut une couverture, une balade officielle un peu plus consensuelle. Un but pédagogique, un prétexte classique.
Une simple sortie de fin d’après-midi.
Marcher en contournant l’hippodrome ou l’étang, dire bonjour à grand-père dans l’allée du cimetière. Alors on y allait comme si de rien n’était, et puis sur le retour on faisait le détour.

Mieux que le vent d’été, 
que les embruns salés, 
mieux que l’herbe coupée, 
Ô effluve adoré de la station d’épuration.

Pour vérifier une vanne, pour constater une panne ou par pure précaution, tout mobile était bon même après dix-neuf heures. Même le jour du seigneur, aller à la station c’était sa dévotion. Alors je jubilais.
Car avec lui, j’entrais dans l’inquiétant palais dont il avait les clefs. Devant les eaux stagnantes je me sentais vivante, dans l’odeur de moisi je me trouvais jolie. Je n’allais pas, enfant, regarder l’océan pour dans l’azur me perdre, mais au bord de la merde. Et sachez qu’en hiver, inhaler au grand air le ventre de la terre, on dirait du Baudelaire.

Mieux que le vent d’été, 
que les embruns salés, 
mieux que l’herbe coupée, 
Ô effluve adoré de la station d’épuration.

Depuis ces heureux jours, je nourris un amour pur et immodéré pour les éviers bouchés, les restes de savon qui engluent les siphons, les cheveux par poignées qui obstruent les bidets. J’ai acquis la passion des canalisations.
Rien à mon cœur ne vaut la vue d’un château d’eau. Quand d’autres ont le dégoût des remontées d’égouts, je n’aime rien tant que leur doux parfum aqueux.
Qu’un lavabo douteux se présente à mes yeux, qu’une baignoire inonde le sol d’une eau immonde, j’ai la ventouse au poing et la technique au point. Intensément, j’aspire. On dirait du Shakespeare.

Mieux que le vent d’été, 
que les embruns salés, 
mieux que l’herbe coupée, 
Ô effluve adoré de la station d’épuration.",La  Station,2004
Jeanne Cherhal,"Il paraît qu’on voit toute sa vie défiler quand on est sur le point d’y passer. Il paraît qu’on sait le moment arrivé quand l’ultime projection est lancée. Que tout te revient comme un petit film à l’accéléré.
Il paraît qu’on n’y voit pas les moments mauvais, qu’on pardonne tout, je sais pas si c’est vrai. Il paraît qu’on n’a pas peur, que la mort n’est rien. Pas encore là, et hop déjà loin. Que tout te revient comme un petit film à l’accéléré.

avec soleil flou artistique
des amis dans l’herbe ma frangine
scènes prises au hasard mais tranquilles

Il paraît qu’on voit toute sa vie défiler quand on est sur le point d’y passer. Il paraît qu’on sait le moment arrivé quand l’ultime projection est lancée. Que tout te revient comme un petit film à l’accéléré.
Mais qu’arrive-t-il quand la mort n’est pas une surprise, quand tu as décidé de décéder.
Est-ce que la bobine se déroule quand même derrière l’écran de tes yeux ? Et qu’arrive-t-il quand meurt un cameraman, pense-t-il au cadrage, à l’image, à ce moment-là ? Et l’ouvreuse au pop-corn, aux barres de chocolat qui précèdent la séance ? 
Est-ce que tout leur revient comme un petit film à l’accéléré ?

Moi j’aimerais un film en Super 8
Avec soleil flou artistique
Des amis dans l’herbe ma frangine
Scènes prises au hasard mais tranquilles
J’aimerais un film en Super 8

Il paraît qu’on veut tous mourir en dormant, ne pas se réveiller c’est tentant. Est-ce qu’on voit alors dans le film de sa vie ses sommeils et ses plus belles nuits, toutes les fois où on a somnolé en cours, au ciné ou juste après l’amour ?

Jeanne Cherhal,"Tout s’annonçait si différent
Tout nous semblait un peu plus grand
On aurait du se réveiller
Sur le même oreiller
Sans jamais se lasser mais
Quand vient l’ennui vlan il s’installe
Tu tombes de ton piédestal
Et nos caresses et nos jolies habitudes
Perdent soudain de l’altitude

Si tu me suis je te fuis 
Tu me fuis je te suis

C’est ma vie et je la veux en l’air
Notre amour n’a pas passé l’hiver

J’en ai rêvé de te revoir
J’en ai connu des coucous d’un soir
Qui aurait cru qu’à vivre à deux 
On allait devenir vieux
Avant l’heure avant eux mais
Un soir en prenant l’escalier
J’ai vu l’amour sur le palier
Et son sourire son vieux pull ses habitudes
Ont pris soudain de l’altitude

Si tu me suis je te fuis

Jeanne Cherhal,"Faut pas être nerveuse,
Quand on est serveuse,
Et qui se passe rien,
Qu’une mouche violette,
Qui cherche les toilettes,
Trois hommes et un chien.
Arrive un bipède,
Drapé dans un plaid,
Comme un Ecossais,
Je suis la Barmaid
 Que puis-je pour votre aide ? 
Lui dis-je en Français

Il me dit Barmaid,
Donne-moi mon remède,
C’était pas du lait,
La vie est trop laide,
Dans ce foutu bled,
Lui n’était laid,
Et puisqu’on s’emmerde,
Peut-être qu’à deux Barmaid,
On s’emmerderait moins,
Ses paroles plaident 
En faveur du plaid,
« Je suis garé pas loin ».

Il me dit  Barmaid, 
Viens dans la pinède, 
Et sans faire de foin 
1 je te précède 
Tu comptes jusqu’à Z 
2 tu me rejoins
Allez sois gentille et cède 
Ce que tu possèdes
Sans faire de tintouin,
Autrement Barmaid, 
T’as le bonjour Alfred,
Je te retourne à Saint-Ouen.

Je lui ai dit  Alfred 
Je te trouve un peu raide
Là tu m’en bouches un coin
L’amour nous possède
Je te le concède
Là tu marques un point
Mais est-ce qu’on procède 
Comme des quadrupèdes
Je veux dire comme des chiens
Si tu veux que je cède
Mets des gants de Suède 
Demande-moi ma main

Il me dit  Barmaid, 
J’ai bu mon remède, 
Merci pour les soins,
Car vois-tu Barmaid, 
Je m’appelle Andromède,
J’en avais besoin.

Et nous dépossèdent 
Des amours torrides 
Qui deviennent tièdes

Pareil en Floride.",La Barmaid,2005

Ah ces invités sans avoir l’air, 
M’auront piqué jusqu’à mes couverts,
 Et pillé chacun de me mes plats.

En bavardant ils font comme de rien,
A coups de fourchettes,
Pire que les chiens,
Je n’en peux plus de ce repas.

Comment défend-on sa pitance face à l’ennemi ?

D’un peu de poudre d’apparat.

Armés d’une ultime petite cuillère,
Ils avaleront leur dernier dessert,
Et je crierai « Adieu les rats !»

Jeanne Cherhal,"Le temps passé tu sais
A fait ce qu'il fallait
Je pense à toi tranquille parfait
Le temps passé bien sure
A calmé la blessure
La peine qui dure
Et je le sens
Je déporte bien des sentiments
De projets de joie, de cris de chants
Pourtant tu me manque encore

Mon chagrin s'est fait doux
Je porte autour du cou
Ton souvenir comme un bijou
Mon chagrin s'est fait rare
Il revient certains soir
Sans faire d'histoires
Et je le sens
Je suis traversée de sentiments
D'amour et d'amis, d'un tas de gens
Pourtant tu me manque encore

Quand j’entends par hasard
Petite fleur ou le Loire et cher
Quand le dimanche soir
Me revient l'angoisse première
Quand ma tête est bizarre
Quand soudain je compte les jours
Oh tu me manque toujours

Mais les années tu sais
Ont fait ce qu'il fallait
Je pense à toi tranquille parfait
Mais les années sans toi
Sont passées malgré moi
Vite sous mes doigts
Et je le sens
Je suis étourdie de sentiments
Lorsque je me dis tout doucement
Combien tu me manque encore",Petite Fleur,2014
Jeanne Cherhal,"Il était une fois, une fois ou mille
Une âme comme toi, une âme tranquille
Qui dans un désir violent et soudain
Voulu parvenir trop vite à ses fins

Avec la finesse qu'ont parfois les bêtes
Face à la princesse dis suis-je bête
Entre haut et bas souvent femme varie
Si elle se débat c'est pour mieux dire oui

Quand c'est non dommage

Jeanne Cotter,"I will come to you in the silence
I will lift you from all your fear
You will hear My voice
I claim you as My choice
Be still, and know I am near

Jeanne Gies,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

Jeanne Lee,"Laura is the face in the misty lights.
Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,
That you can never quite recall.

And you see Laura on a train that is passing through.
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura,1961
Jeanne Lee,"You stepped out of a dream
You are too wonderful to be what you seem!
Could there be eyes like yours, 
Could there be lips like yours
Could there be smiles like yours, 
Honest and truly?
You stepped out of a cloud
I want to take you away, away from the crowd
And have you all to myself, 
Alone and apart out of a dream, 
Safe in my heart

Jeanne Lee,"Night and stars above that shine so bright 
The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting

As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue

Within our desert caravan",Caravan,1994
Jeanne Lee,"If they ask me, I could write a book
About the way you walk and whisper and look

Then the world discovers as my book ends

Am I too late to make amends?

Jeanne Lee,"I took a trip on a train
And I thought about you
I passed a shadowy lane
And I thought about you

Two or three cars parked under the stars
Winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream

And every stop that we made
Oh, I thought about you
And when I pulled down the shade
Then I really felt blue

I peeped through the crack
Looked at the track
Oh I'm going back to you
And what did I do, I thought about you

There were two or three cars parked under the stars
Winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream

And then I peeped through the crack
And I looked at the track
Oh I'm going back to you
And what did I do, I thought about you",I Thought About You,2003
Jeanne Lehman,"She climbs a tree and scrapes her knee, her dress has got a tear
She waltzes on her way to mass and whistles on the stairs
And underneath her wimple she has curlers in her hair
I've even heard her singing in the abbey

She's always late for chapel but her penitence is real
She's always late for everything except for every meal
I hate to have to say it but I very firmly feel
Maria's not an asset to the abbey

I'd like to say a word in her behalf then say it Sister Margaretta
Maria makes me laugh

How do you solve a problem like Maria?
How do you catch a cloud and pin it down?
How do you find the word that means Maria?
A flibbertigibbet, a willow the wisp, a clown

Many a thing you know you'd like to tell her
Many a thing she ought to understand
But how do you make her stay and listen to all you say
How do you keep a wave upon the sand?

Oh, how do you solve a problem like Maria?
How do you hold a moonbeam in your hand?

When I'm with her I'm confused, out of focus and bemused
And I never know exactly where I am
Unpredictable as weather, she's as flighty as a feather
She's a darling, she's a demon, she's a lamb

She'll out pester any pest, drive a hornet from it's nest
She could throw a whirling dervish out of whirl
She is gentle, she is wild, she's a riddle, she's a child
She's a headache, she's an angel, she's a girl

How do you solve a problem like Maria?
How do you catch a cloud and pin it down?
How do you find the word that means Maria?
A flibbertigibbet, a willow the wisp, a clown

Many a thing you know you'd like to tell her
Many a thing she ought to understand
But how do you make her stay and listen to all you say?
How do you keep a wave upon the sand

Oh, how do you solve a problem like Maria?
How do you hold a moonbeam in your hand?

Jeanne Mas,"Si l'on m'avait conseillée,
J'aurais commis moins d'erreurs,
J'aurais su me rassurer,
Toutes les fois que j'ai eu peur,
Je me serais blottie au chaud,
A l'abri d'un vent trop fier,
Et j'aurais soigné ma peau,
Blessée par les froids d'hivers,
J'aurais mis de la couleur,
Sur mes joues et sur mes lèvres,
Je serais devenue jolie.

J'ai construit tant de châteaux,
Qui se réduisaient en sable,
J'ai prononcé tant de noms,
Qui n'avaient aucun visage,
Trop longtemps je n'ai respiré
Autre chose que de la poussière,
Je n'ai pas su me calmer,
Chaque fois que je manquais d'air,
Mes yeux ne veulent plus jouer,
Se maquillent d'indifférence,
Je renie mon innocence.

En rouge et noir, j'exilerai ma peur ;
J'irai plus haut que ces montagnes de douleur,
En rouge et noir, j'afficherai mon cœur ;
En échange d'une trêve de douceur,
En rouge et noir, mes luttes mes faiblesses,
Je les connais, je voudrais tellement qu'elles s'arrêtent ;
En rouge et noir, drapeau de mes colères,
Je réclame un peu de tendresse.

Si l'on m'avait conseillée,
Tout serait si différent,
J'aurais su vous pardonner,
Je serais moins seule à présent,
Somnambule j'ai trop couru,
Dans le noir des grandes forêts,
Je me suis souvent perdue,
Dans des mensonges qui tuaient,
J'ai raté mon premier rôle,
Je jouerai mieux le deuxième,
Je veux que la nuit s'achève.",En Rouge et Noir,1998

Mannish little knucklehead, hardhead heathen 
Meanin, give a fuck about life, I seen my momma 
Stab my daddy in the stomach with a knife 
When I was three years old, finally figured it out 

That's why a nigga sold coke, clientele and clout 
Without a motherfuckin doubt, take a nigga out 
For trying to go between my motherfuckin paper route 
Wet his ass up, that nigga see and go

Three in the mornin it's hard labor chasin paper 
Nigga twerkin, go to several Russian car 
Click-ers come esouped with VCR's 

Microwave ovens and credit cards 
Pullin all kind of heavy metal straps 
Beatin nijjas down with bumper jacks 
LIP's bitches overseas shoot crap 

Try to have more paper than a factory 
Motherfuckers gettin to showin out when the yard flexes 
Liable, blow a whole on a psycho 
Vital, lookin out for the rival tribal dead on arrival 

Psycho, it's all about survival 
Quarter ounce zippers is on 
Run up in his home white sock or bone 
With the chrome pist-al, pistol whip a nigga 

With a zap force, seen this hammer, Arm and Hammer 
Baking soda, listening to the scanner, scared man 
Can't win, especially when a nigga packin 
Fetti stackin, mashin, flashin 

I'm flashin, the Elroy's pulled me over 
And put the flashlight to my window and told me I was speedin 
And I got to, fa-lashin on they ass 
I got to actin like a demon the motherfuckers told me

On a motherfucker, motherfucker come out there 
Talkin crazy to me lookin at me crazy up in the motherfuckin sto'

Don't let me get to flashin on yo' ass nigga 
Motherfucker up in the club, and a motherfucker step on my shoe 
And I got to fa-lashin! 

It's all bad, motherfucker used to be comrade 
Used to fuck the same hoes, wear Jeff clothes 
Closer than a bugger to a nose, choosin vogues 
Slammin Cadillac do's together, cookin crack 

Gettin eighteens if it's back, overkill 
Put the whammy on the whoop, be on the lookout 
For the state troop, might shoot, durin the drug deal 
Flippin at the mouth 

Voluntarily raps your motherfuckin folkers out 
Tight about since Little League, Boy Scouts 
Paper route dropped a diamond get some day skunk

She gonna get hella stanky if youse get teared up 
But us niggas don't bring me back 
My motherfuckin duffle bag.. I squinges off the hinges 
Lean ballin, alcohol and weed

A criminal record a full of dirty deeds 
Givin niggaz black eyes and bloody lips 
Cauliflower ears and extra clips 

Gun clappin music slappin party crashin 
Brash and motherfucker flashin

From a church on a breeze,
To laugh like a brook when it trips and falls
Over stones on its way
To sing through the night,
Like a lark who is learning to pray.

Qui rêve de coeur souvent est servi de pique noir
Qui cherche un regard reçoit des rires moqueurs
Reçoit des rires moqueurs

Me font des signes vagues vagues vagues
Et me frol'nt de l'épaul' vaguement
Une étreint' vague entre deux êtres vagues vagues
C'est un peu renier le néant
Le temps maudit toujours nous pressés
Le temps pourtant qui va si lentement
Le temps efface mes caresses
Alors je chante  sans fin ce vague chant.

AU REFRAIN

Et je suis si trist'
Quand les homm's vagues vagues vagues
Se repos'nt dans mes bras vaguement
Vaguement divagu'nt dans leur sommeil si vague vague
Quand ils dorm'nt ils ressembl'nt aux enfants

Le temps qui va son lent balancement
Le temps emporte ma tendresse

Fuyante et mouvant' la main d'une femme

Soudain la saisit sur le dos de la mit.

Paume contre paume dans la main fermée
La main blanche et fin' parée de bijoux
Dans la main de l'homm' consentit à tout
Paume renversée et les doigts noués
D'une folle étreint' ressortit brisée.

Rien n'arrive plus dans la neige blanche
Pourtant faite exprès pour mouler les hanches
On a oublié comment y aller

Jeanne Moreau,"Je rêv' toujours d'me tirer, d'me barrer, d'me tailler, d'foutre le camp.
Moi qui aim'rais tant M'arrêter d'cavaler 
Prendre le temps D'avoir des chats, des petits chats 
Des chiens, des tas d'enfants
Un vieux fauteuil au coin du feu
Où me laisser glisser à deux 
Avoir mes bouquins sous la main qui s'ouvrent d'eux-mêmes
Aux pages qu'on aime et qu'on relit sans fin 
Parc'qu'on les aime.
Un petit clocher de Cocagne
Que j'entendrais tinter l'hiver tout comm' l'été
La nuit le jour sur la campagne
Me donnerais envie d'ne plus changer ma vie.

J'verrai chaqu' soir l'tourbillon fou du monde devant ma télé
Mes chats, mes chiens roupillant à nos pieds a poings fermés
Et qu'au dehors le vent d'hiver s'donn'rait un mal de chien
Pour fair' plier les peupliers que nous aurions plantés à deux
Et les soirées d'automn' coul'raient douces et monotones
Et chaques nuits on se dirait chéri on réveillonne
Ah ! quell' petite vie de Cocagne 
L'hiver tout comm' l'été j'pourrais pas m'en lasser
La nuit le jour dans ma campagne
Ni vu et ni connu dans mon p'tit coin perdu
Mais v'la qu'il faut me tirer, me barrer, me tailler
Foutre le camp
Je n'ai même pas le temps 
D'm'oublier un instant 
Loin du présent 
Adieu mes chats mes petits chats, 
Mes chiens, adieu le vent 
Ce vieux fauteil au coin du feu 
J'm'y s'rai jamais planqué à deux 
C'est bêt' ce rêv' que j'fais chaqu' jour dans ma p'tite auto...
En v'nant du bureau ....
Qui pourrit ma vie 
De nostalgies ! ....",La Vie de Cocagne,1996
Jeanne Moreau,"Elle avait des bagues à chaque doigt
Des tas de bracelets autour des poignets

Jeanne Newhall,"It was Montmartre 
It was midnight Come to think of it
It was spring
There was music I was listening
Then in the room somewhere someone began to sing 
This serenade made for remembering
 
A small cafe, Mam'selle
Our rendezvous, Mam'selle
The violins were warm and sweet 
And so were you, Mam'selle
And as the night danced by 
A kiss became a sigh
Your lovely eyes seemed to sparkle 
Just like wine does
No heart ever yearned the way mine does for you
And yet I know too well 
Some day you'll say goodbye 
Then violins will cry 
And so will I, Mam'selle

Jeanne Newhall,"I want to see your face in every kind of light
In fields of dawn and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

I want to see your face in every kind of light
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two

Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you

Jeanne Newhall,"Little boy lost in search of little boy found
You go a wondering, wandering 
Stumbling, tumbling, round! round!
When will you find 
What's on the tip of your mind?
Why are you blind 
To all you ever were
Never were, really are, nearly are?
Little boy false in search of little boy true
Will you ever be done traveling
Always unraveling you, you?
Running away could lead you further astray
And as for fishing in streams for pieces of dreams
Those pieces will never fit 
What is the sense of it? 
Little boy blue, don't let your little sheep roam
It's time ,come blow your horn, meet the morn
Look and see, can you be far from home?

Patiently waiting,
Hoping and longing,
Oh! How I yearn!

Are you forgetting?
Do you remember?
Will you return?

Down the street before,
But the pavement always
Stayed beneath my feet before.
All at once am i
Several stories high,
Knowing I?m on the street where you live.

Are there lilac trees
In the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour
Out of every door?
No, it?s just on the street where you live.

And oh, the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear.

People stop and stare
They don?t bother me,
For there?s no where else on earth
That I would rather be.

Let the time go by,
I won?t care if i
Can be here on the street where you live.

Jeanne Pruett,"Well, you wouldn't read my letters if I wrote you
You asked me not to call you on the phone
There's something I've been waiting for to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song

You never knew there were honky tonk angels
Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows
I tried to be your one and only angel
But I'm not that kind of angel, heaven knows

I cried so hard the day you went and left me
'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

No, well, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
Well, you left the only one who ever loved you
And I'm back here on the wild side of life

I'm only a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
And you left me here on the wild side of life",Wild Side of Life,1979
Jeanne Pruett,"Stayed in bed all mornin' just to pass the time.
There's somethin' wrong here, there can be no denyin'.
One of us is changin', or maybe we've just stopped tryin'.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
It used to be so easy, livin' here with you.
You were light and breezy, an' I knew just what to do.
Now you look so unhappy, and I feel like a fool.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
There'll be good times again for me and you,
But we just can't stay together; don't you feel it too?
Still I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it. (we can't make it)
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Love me, oh love me
Love me like nobody else can do
Need me
And just let me go one needing you 

Well if you want to try to make me over
And there's something else that fits your plan
It's alright if you would only tell me
What it's going to take to be your man

If you ever say you're going to leave me
Lord I don't know what on earth I'll do

Jeanne Pruett,"What's that around your head, is it a halo?
And what's that on your shoulders, is it wings?
You must be a walkin' piece of heaven
Or is it love that makes me see these things

Around you is a light that keeps on glowin'
When you speak do I hear angels sing?
You must be a walkin' piece of heaven
Or is it love that makes me see these things

When we met you gave me strength to face the world
I believe you're special, you're no ordinary girl

Am I seein' light or am I dreaming?
Do I hear the rush of angels wings?
You must be a walkin' piece of heaven
Or is it love that makes me see these things
Or is it love that makes me see these things

Though you've given me everything money can buy

Jeanne Pruett,"I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine
There's gotta be a little rain some time
When you take you gotta give so live and let live
Or let go oh-whoa-whoa-whoa
I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden

I could promise you things like big diamond rings
But you don't find roses growin' on stalks of clover
So you better think it over
Well if sweet-talkin' you could make it come true
I would give you the world right now on a silver platter
But what would it matter
So smile for a while and let's be jolly
Love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can

I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine
There's gotta be a little rain some time

I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden

I could sing you a tune and promise you the moon
But if that's what it takes to hold you
I'd just as soon let you go
But there's one thing I want you to know
You better look before you leap, still waters run deep
And there won't always be someone there to pull you out
And you know what I'm talkin' about
So smile for a while and let's be jolly
Love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can

I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine
There's gotta be a little rain some time,
I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden",Rose Garden,2002

Right out of space your haunting face appears

There were other serenades broken promises we made
Why must I pay day after day with tears

Alone in my room I watch the ghost of you
Alone in the gloom once more I'm close to you

Melancholy serenade as the music starts to fade
I feel your kiss and then you disappear

I feel your kiss and then you disappear",Melancholy Serenade,

Do the best adventures have to end
Now do we leave the scene as friends.
Is this how I'll find love and trust

Alone and lost
Is this where we say goodbye
Rather than just live another lie
Does it have to end?

You must be wearing armor
Maybe you don't hear it
You must have wax in your ears
Maybe you can't see it
But you've worn that blindfold for years.
Are you anesthetized?
Are you preoccupied?
Did someone cruel tell you lies?
Did you believe it?
Or have you seen it all?

[Chorus:]
Love is like a mountain
If you never try the climb 
There's no risk at all
Is there no challenge

Don't you know the edge where the innocents fall?
Maybe you can't hold it
But then it was never yours to hold
Perhaps you've gone crazy
Living with no one to catch your fall
Could you be hypnotized?
Have you been analyzed?
Did someone cruel tell you lies?
Did you believe it?
Or have you seen it all?

Go for the root -
And put your boot in the door

Now's the time to explore

Go for the root
It's the conflict between fact and meaning

And you can't scale the walls

'Cause there's an armed guard on the roof
Go for the root

When you watch the starving thousands
On the channel of your choice my friend
You're an audience for war
But you're always switching sides

It's like looking at a landscape
Through a microscope in the middle of the night -
Even half a revolution
Would only bring you light

Go for the root
You're so messed up by politics lady
There's nothing exotic in poverty
Go for the root

Where do you get your information
From a dream or a twenty four inch screen

How can we fight without a mission
And will we ever feel the ecstasy of free thought
How can we fight 
With no decision
And will we ever feel the ecstasy of free thought

You're nowhere
You're trapped by information
Just let it go
The key hangs with your senses
Set the prisoner free

Where did we leave our education
Do we have the same proof
At least to judge the situation
Do we understand morality
From watching television
Will we ever feel the ecstasy of free thought

Leave us divided

You can't take things where you are
... you can't take it with you.

Let's switch off the set
...and be glad we finally met.

I could crash... my car
Through your screen
I could take a match... to your empire
And teach you how to dream

You open the door
Let me into your home
You show me how you cry
You tell me how you scream

And how you watch
When you're alone

Jeannette Obstoj,"There are leaders
And those who only wish to follow and be fed
There are strangers with stolen power
And there are reasons that come tomorrow
And is it natures way
For you to run today and be free

Do you want to be a legend
Or a passing footprint on the sands of time
Do you want to be a failure
Or the best example of a man who lived to use his mind -
Imagine what you could be

There are rebels
Who can't be silenced, they remind us how to see
There are prophets, believing visions
While many others, put trust in science
And there are dreamers who
Must get through, to your soul

Do you want to be a legend
Or a passing footprint on the sands of time
Do you want to be a failure
Or the best example of a man who lived to use his mind -
Imagine what you could be

Imagine what you could be
With that feeling of symmetry
And your eye for beauty
Then you've faith in the impossible -
Imagine what you could be
There are lovers
Of skills forgotten
By great people - in their haste
But there is no one
Who knows what you do
That's the knowledge you should not waste
And teachers point the way
But only you can find the place

Or a passing footprint on the sands of time
Do you want to be a failure

Don't close your eyes

I won't let you fall

I'll take the pain - I'll take the pain away.
I'll share your laughter.

Thousands of light years from here -
Love makes us strong

Till we win freedom.

So far from our time, another frequency -
And one perfect reason.

Thousands of light years from here
We can go there
There shines our promised land

Pastures green and no hunger,
Under another sun

It's no strangers face
It's your reflection

Jeannie,"He was just every day plain as water or a piece of clay
Why did I let him stay I love him
Early morning the paper came he would run out in the rain
He would kiss me on his way I love him

Then for breakfast I'd make a mess burn his bacon and what was left
His same old smile I'd always get I love him
Then his ride would come by and from the corner of my eye
I see them watch us say goodbye I love him

When I heard my child in prayer.
She said, ""And for me some scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for my hair.""

And all the streets were dark and bare. 
In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair. 

Through the night my heart was aching. 
And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there,

I was sure our love was pure if love can be
Then one morning without warning truth came calling on me and her name was Louise
I needn't tell you what she said I just wanted to be dead
For she didn't show mercy for me
You should've seen her walk away into his waiting arms that day
And I watched him stopped to kiss Louise

The hour was late the night was warm I hid the bundle beneath my arm
The thought of what I'd soon be doing made me freeze
But without fear I found them there just how and where I knew they'd be

But I dare not beg forgiveness on my knees
For it was done with careful plans she'll never steal another man
For tomorrow they'll bury Louise

On one hot and sultry day mama got sick and passed away
Givin' birth to baby brother Ben
I stood there and I cried as I watched my mama die
I guess I was too young to understand
Papa didn't shed a tear or even really seemed to care
I thought it was because he was a man

Papa started drinkin' wine and chasin' women all the time
And livin' off the fat of the land
We children did the best we could milked the cows and chopped the wood
And ate what mama left us canned
One day the sheriff walked in to notify the next of kin papa was run over by a train
It had been almost a year since papa left us here we were sorry but really felt no pain

Said he'd send someone to take us into town

He fell into the river Jones-why said that's water over the dam

I walk along the river where we used to come and skate
The trees're now all gone and by the river there's a sign
Trespassin' is a twenty dollar fine

Lookin' up the road toward the schoolhouse on the hill
That thing about an empty building causes me to chill
My memory goes back to when the teacher rang the bell
The day she sent you home for saying hell

Walkin' past the building so important in my past
The road is full of ol' discarded bottles and some trash
I step behind the building as I shelter from the cold
I see our names in letters big and bold

My fingers trace the letters of a work of art alone
And I recall the day that you carved it in a stone
Somehow I can see you now with books and coat in hand
You always waved as down the hill you ran

Cokes were just a nickel then and many were the times
The two of us would sip them as if they were village wine
And then on Graduation Day we bought the little ring
And said that carats didn't mean a thing

Now I retrace my footsteps to the cab that waits for me
Looking back to see our names you carved upon a tree
The driver says I look familiar asks me what's my name

Old souvenirs and pictures we took I'll keep them forever inside my scrapbook

A girl knows the bitter and sweet taste of tears

It ended in heartbreak and the young taste of tears

It looks like Chubby Adams gained two hundred pounds or more
And they've fixed up this old drugstore where we used to hang around
But whatever happened to Charlie Brown
Whatever happened to Charlie Brown I've asked almost everyone in town
No one here recalls the last time they saw him around
Oh whatever happened to Charlie Brown

Too bad about poor Becky Jones she's in a family way
She thought that they'd be married but the boy skipped town one day

Jeannie C. Riley,"There are the roses and there are the thorns
There's a time for happiness and there's a time to mourn
There's a time to love then when love is faded and worn
Oh oh instead of the roses there are the thorns

Once there was spring and the flowers were gentle and sweet
I inhaled the goodness of love and my life was complete
I reached for a rose and its petals were crushed by my touch
Oh oh I love too hard and the thorns are now hurtin' too much

Winter comes on with no mercy for those unpreapared
Coldness creaps in on a heart that a dead love needs bared
Loving too much leaves a wreckage like that of a storm
Yes it does instead of the roses now I am holding the thorns

Roses and thorns so close together they grow
Fladness and sadness emotiones that everyone knows
When there is one the other can't be far behind oh no
I've held the rose and the stem with the thorns is now mine

Roses and thorns so close together...

'Cause the house would get so-o hot
From the summer sun there was no way of sleepin'
And you'd play your old guitar
We'd fight mosquitos and enjoy
Your backyard concert for we had no television
We'd just begun our life as man and wife
And hardships then
Could scaresely scare us into quittin'
Things were far from bein' fine
We often dined upon a dime
But there never was a time we didn't love
And that Christmas brought our saddest day
When your pride gave way as you told the kids
There'd be no gifts 'cause we were broke
And though their little tears of grief
Were so hard to see, it didn't hurt me
Like the lump I knew was in your throat
It was then with arms entwined
We both broke down and cried
For it seemed like nothin' good would ever come
The doctor bills we couldn't pay
They came and took our car away
But there never was a time we didn't love
Now there's an easy chair for my back
A satin pillo' for my head
And the kids are wild about their brand new cars

With all the trimmin's and not worry
If we've spent a dollar more than we can spare
No wonder in our prayers
We thank the man upstairs who led us through
The years of rearin' kids and payin' bills
And I think he guided us
Not because we were smart
But just because there never was a time we didn't love

And that great big nice house has just become an ice house

But things go better with love things go better with love
It's made of something nothing else is made of
Things go better with love things go better with love
And life is much more fun when you're in love

Well I wrecked your new car last week last night it rained and the roof leaked
But the rain on the window pane made a soothing sound

When it's hard to pay the mortage why we don't mind the shortage

Yeah I'm a sweet young thing I just turned eighteen and I'm unhookin' the latch
Cause I've got too much class for this cotton patch
I've been readin' magazines on a once-a-week trip to town on Saturday
And I've seen all pretty clothes and had some rich men and I know that's for me
Papa's been tryin' to pair me up with Willie Bond whose daddy owns the cotton gin

I arrived in style aboard that big semi and I felt mighty high
Waltzin' into the best department store for employment to suit my style
And I was doin' pretty good till some wisecracker came on the scene
He called me a ripe tomato but he said I sure look green
I tried ever door to ever store in town but my luck had run down
It seemed nobody round Dallas could recognize the class I'd brought to town
And after all day of looking would you believe the only job I could land
Was in a dog food factory stickin' labels on dog food cans
Dear mama how are you pop and kids hope you're doin' OK
Me I never did find a better job and all the rich men got away

It brought back burning mem'ries of a happy yesterday

To all the things we used to do me and Billy Jack
Here's the first note he wrote and gave me in the hall
It asked if I'd stay after school to watch him play football

Here are the tickets dubbed for my first picture show
I'd seen him talkin' to Rita Gail and I almost didn't go
The corsage I wore to the senior prom pressed and dried
The scarf he tied around my hair for a motorcycle ride
The chest that once was full of hope is now a box of memories
Here's his lettered sweater with a patch Player of the year
And the handkerchief I'd used to wipe away all my tears
When he was playing chicken to prove the greatness of his nerve
And a speeding car killed my dreams on Dead Man's Curve

Well Mr. Harper couldn't be here cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again
And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip of gin
And then you have the nerve to tell me, you think that as a mother I'm not fit
Well this is just a little Peyton Place, and you're all Harper Valley hypocrites

No, I wouldn't put you on because, it really did happen just this way

Let earth receive her King

How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that little brook still leaping there?
Does it still run down to Donny cove?
Through Killybegs, Kilkerry and Kildare?

How are things in Glocca Mora?
Is that willow tree still weeping there?
Does that lassie with the twinklin' eye
Come smilin' by and does she walk away,

Sad and dreamy there not to see me there?
So I ask each weepin' willow and each brook along the way,
And each lass that comes a-sighin' too ra lay

Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies

Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon

I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

And you have too
No peace shall I find

It takes you and shakes you right down to your shoes 
It knows heartache and trial but accepts no denial 
You can't choose who you love, love chooses you

We control it no more than the flight of the sparrow 
The swell of the tide or the light of the moon 
You can't choose who you love, love chooses you 

Tell me now if I'm wrong 
Are you feelin' the same 
Are your feet on the ground 
Are you callin' my name 
Do you lie awake nights 
Please say you do 
'Cause you can't choose who you love 
Love chooses you 

Love cuts like a torch to a heart behind steel 
And though you may hide it, love knows how you feel 
And though you may trespass on the laws of the land 
Your heart has to follow when love takes your hand 

And it seems we're two people within the same circle 
It's drawn tighter and tighter till you're all that I see 
I'm full and I'm empty and you're pouring through me 
Like a warm rain fallin' through the leaves on a tree 

Tell me now if I'm wrong 
Are you feelin' the same 
Are your feet on the ground 
Are you callin' my name 
Do you lie awake nights

There will be no second chances

Don't even waste your time 
Truth is you took me for granted and I really had it

Now don't come around 
with promises that don't exist 
'Cause heard it all before and your sorry's 
Ain't fixin' this, no
Held on for so long

Jeannie Ortega,"What I need?
What I need?

Why can't I just meet a total stranger
Fall in love and live happily ever after?
At the perfect ending to my story
The kind you only see in movies

Things never happen that way, do they?
In my reality the love just won't stay
It hurts like hell what I'm feeling
Is that the way love's suppose to be?

I've had enough, it's like a drug
I can't give up my feeling
I'm in his plans, my Superman, my baby

All I want is someone that could hold me down
That's gon' be around when I need him
Giving me that real love 'cause that's what he's about
Someone to ride with me that's what I need

I need someone whose sensitive is built up
Someones who really shows love
A real man, understanding but demanding
So proud and faithful to me

I need to feel like that there's someone I could run to
He gives me more of his time then he's got to
Gives me my space when I gotta go and do me
Supports what ever makes me happy

I've had enough, it's like a drug
I can't give up my feeling.
I'm in his plans, my Superman, my baby

All I want is someone that could hold me down
That's gon' be around when I need him
Giving me that real love 'cause that's what he's about
Someone to ride with me that's what I need

All I need is something real to me
Baby, all I want is to be happy in love

Someone that could hold me down
That's gon' be around when I need him
Giving me that real love 'cause that's what he's about
Someone to ride with me that's what I need

I'm not gonna be your chick on the side
Forget about it
You know damn well it wouldn't be right

I dunno what you been thinkin' 'bout me
Did u think this was gonna be that easy?

Get outta my sight
Get off oh my back...
Why don't you go back to your world...
Go back to your girl..
I think you owe her...
I know whats going on
I wont be second to none(noo)
Back up, cuz you crowdin' my space...
You need to get outta my face

Lets be honest
I'm not the type of chick that you use...
And if you want it
If you want it
You'll have to choose

Tell me whats the meaning...
Whats the sense of me having cake if I can't eat it
Cheaters never win, my friend, you like creepin'
But hate when you're girl starts cheatin'
Imagine if you came home to your wife
Opened your door and locked it
Then you found R. Kelly hiding in your closet
I knew you would start cheatin, before you even stopped it
I'm like when you double your money, I'm a profit...
Albert Einstein was smart, but I'm some wiser...
I'm a ladies man, your man is a womanizer
You gotta fight for love, can you make a fist
Since your name is Genie, can I make a wish? (yeaahh)
No minor set backs, every move major
Grown folk behavior, just do me one favor...
He put you on the side, let me be your savior...

She worked the night shift
Dishwater blonde, tall and fine
She got a lot of tips
Well, earlier I'd been talkin' stuff
In a violent room
Fighting with lovers past
I needed someone with a quicker wit than mine
Dorothy was fast
Well, I ordered, ""Yeah, let me get a fruit cocktail, I ain't to hungry""
Dorothy laughed
She said ""Sounds like a real man to me""
Kinda cute, you want to take a bath?
(do you want to, do you want to, bath)
I said ""Cool, but I'm leaving my pants on"" (she say)
""'cause I'm kind of going with someone""
She said ""Sounds like a real man to me""
""Mind if I turn on the radio?""
""Oh, my favorite song"" she said
And it was Joni singing ""Help me I think I'm falling""

The phone rang and she said
""Whoever's calling can't be as cute as you""
Right then I knew I was through
(Dorothy Parker was cool)
My pants where wet, they came off
But she didn't see the movie
Cause she hadn't read the book first
Instead she pretended she was blind
An affliction brought on by a witch's curse
Dorothy made me laugh (ha ha)
I felt much better so I went back 
To the violent room (tell us what you did)
Let me tell you what I did

I took another bubble bath with my pants on

Adapt to the press of gravity is laid on my lungs
The theory of communication called cannons
Dissertation with a makeover in camouflage makeup
Light waves bend to the wake of bust
Mics buckle with white knuckles, metacarpals crush
Acid reflux all over your face, you fuck
Grab heart with bare hands,
Squeeze and spray blood
You iller than me? Gimme a call:
W-W-W-N-A-M-I-org
Dear boss,
You mind if I share my thoughts?
Psychotherapy is expensive, can you share my costs?
In a cushioned room with leather doors
Handwriting experts take a look at the letters I draw
Excessive graftedness, there's no space between words
Excessive cross-outs: it must be my nerves
Rhymes that vaporize dis-ablize and destabilize
Pray to God, say Goodbye
Six minutes Vinnie Paz you're on
Lyrically this is the liberty of Liberal Arts

[Vinnie Paz, AKA Ikon the Verbal Hologram]
I'm the god of war,
The resurrector of the horror-core
The carnivore, destroying you wasn't hard at all
I started raw, so the haters could see what could happen
I was Allah while the pagans were speaking in Latin
I'm the origin of science and math
I'm the origin of everything you trying to grasp
Been dying to ask if Jedi Mind is the real
Well I'll let you inside my mind and you decide how it feel
I'm dying to kill
And bring to you apocalypse
I start a lot beef with lots of guns and lots of clips
Fuck the head, I'm aimin right for your esophagus
Hang you from a hook then drink the blood your body drips
I got the power of the lead a fucking shotty spits
And leave you weaker than the mafia that's Gotti-less
With Canibus: get deep like psychoanalysts
Vinne Paz the fucking Hand-to-Fist-Philanthropist

What? Its fucking Vinnie Paz daddy
Yeah Jedi Mind baby
(For the people of the world)
Canibus baby
Let it now be noted

What's the fucking deal?

That here in our decision
This is what we stand for
Justice, Truth and the value of a single human being

I know that you've been feelin' down
If you only knew how I'm feelin' for you
If I could take your pain
I wish that I could wash it all away 
If you only knew how I'm feelin'

Mommy I'm sorry if my first letter made you cry
To be honest with you I don't think that I wanna die
Sometimes I feel like that I'm cancerous in others lives
That's prolley why I drink at night and sleep till 4 or 5
It's kinda hard walking through life with my distorted eyes
When I was younger I was stupid and I thought I thrived
I thought a lot about everything I said in the letter
And questioned whether or not if I was dead you'd be better
You think my shorty would be happy if I never met her
It's too late now mommy I could never forget her
Could never forget how she told me to love
'cause my father and my grandmother is always above
It's glory above you know that daddy taught me to thug
And everytime we was with nanny she'd bombard me with hugs[damn]
I MISS 'EM mommy and it's hard to believe
That I've grown and I don't understand that why did they leave

(Better to die and sleep then never wake and sleep 
Then linger on and dare to live when your souls life is gone)

You've been runnin' around for so long
You've been hurting yourself too much 
You keep messin' around with darkness
You're the one whose losin x2

Mommy I think I'm'a that try to stick around a while
I got a niece and my nephews they need me around a while
I think they need me 'cause they hittin that age
And they ain't tryin to speak to Lenny 'cause they spittin' they rage
And mommy speakin of Lenny I think my brother need me
And we Italian so you know my mother loved to feed me
And it's the little things you do for me that make it worth it
Like when I play a joint that we did and you say it's perfect
And when Jay got knocked you knew that I was hurt
You told me to my heart in a song and it worked
I promised him I'd be there when he got out the bing
You ain't raised me to be a liar ma' that's not my thing
I told him that I'd hold him down the whole time that he gone 
They kept him locked in a cage but that's cool 'cause he's strong
So mommy keep that first letter I wrote you on the low
I think I wanna stay alive and see if I can grow

You've been runnin' around for so long
You've been hurting yourself too much 
You keep messin' around with darkness
You're the one whose losing x2



I know that times were hard
I know that you've been feelin' down

This is raw, all across the board, Liquid Sword Chamber
If it's coming from my jaw, then it's pure anger
Heavy metal rap, with a 44 banger
We can settle that, let the mic cord hang ya
I pay homage to the best of them, like Christopher Wallace
And bring drama to the rest of 'em, with biscuits from coppers
I'm with the Lord-Justice, and we raw gritty
Picture hell, Philadelphia to New York City
I brought a four with me, we can capture the ring
And now we more merciless than the Statue of Ming
And ya'll are more purposeless than a pacifist king
You gonna die, like a brawl with a gat in the Bing
It's a passionate thing, the way we make classics
Genuine brilliance or innate madness
Yeah, we all spin on the same axis
And this chrome thing here leave your frame backless
The police always trying to aim flame at us
So I don't mind when a pig brain splatters
I don't mind that we all gonna die soon

With the footwork of Freddy Adu, its all new,
Now the rap commissioners, they wanna clone my shoe
With the rose now, and its difficult to climb
With the heat and wind and fallen rocks combined
Its hard to stay alined the course is an obstacle
Within each chamber the force it unstoppable
Lyrical swordsman blaze sharp, I'll cut out your heart
Mc's want no part of any type of conflict
Be 'cause when I respond quick, it gets thick
The problem goes beyond sick

But I do what I gotta do
You've been at the bottom, you see the hunger inside of you
Don't say what you won't do

When the going gets tough it'll drive you insane
See I done dodged a couple shots
Served a couple blocks
Hit a couple corners tryna shake a couple cops
A broke a couple rules
Didn't graduate from school
Cus I was busy hustling, man, I thought that shit was cool

See I gotta keep it real with you baby
Cus the shit I used to do is what made me
And I'm hopin I ain't gotta go back to the trap

If I wasn’t me, wasn’t committed
I told my mom and my dad it’ll be the last Christmas
In the hood that you can visit
Oh boy I got it, no chasers
'Cause the best mixed with Hennessey is problems
I took that advice young when I was headed up to college
Momma swimming in that debt
Rather swim with the piranhas or the shark
Ready set go, on your mark to the top
Getting rich ain’t a blessing it’s a choice
Drunk and still drinking out the fucking bottle
I want a hood rat bitch motherfuck a model
You ain't alive if you ain't living that’s the motto

If them niggas think I’m riding with that, them niggas tripping
Yeah I got a magnificent hustle, cause’ imma’ grinder
Told my olds im hiding you here, so they won’t find you
What you know about a bag that’s heavy as anacondas?

All through my neighborhood, next stop is the haters hood
My bitch so bad, but you can bet that my paper good
I do this for real, you lil niggas just fake it good
It’s time for a new crib, it’s time for a new chain

Too many diamond chains that nigga a mess
But if you knew bout my hood you’d say that nigga is blessed
Detroit in this bitch, Big Sean what it do bro?

What's on my feet, say it with me, baby, Balenciaga
Yeah, your nigga on that basic shit, Red Lobster

You know I really got my money on my mind
So I'm really like fuck that bitch

Know it ain’t shit, swing by the Federal boot camp
Shit, whip it like it’s cream brulee
Straight drop that glass, whip cream, watch them eat up it like dessert
Broad day, call it Draya
Almost caught me on the camera nigga makin’ it twerk
‘Magine me with the Kenmore stove
With the Pyrex goin’ berserk
Show up in the khaki Dickies suit, with the Tims on like “I’m going to work”

All about getting that quarter block
Started with the rocks in a slab
Then I moved up on the Ave
Hit them up with that quarter block
Yeaaaahhhh, that quarter block
All about getting that quarter block
250 straight, 9 piece straight drop
Yeah, I’m ‘bout to hit these niggas with a quarter block

I’m the undisputed track king, talkin’ straight cash shit like Mayweather
I was 15 on The Money Team, whip a nigga ass like Mayweather
Young nigga, 14 for the half from the big homie, didn’t know better
Old niggas taxing didn’t stop shit, cuz a young nigga got mo’ cheddar
This work shit is in my resume
Move chickens out there like I’m Chik-Fil-A

Even on Sunday unlike Chik-Fil-A

Eyes red, nigga might need some Visine
Gain got a nigga head powder, nigga might need some Advil
Feds picked up my nigga and his baby mama
Last night shit was mad real
Scared to go to church
Throw him an iced out cross, then I hit the club
Threw both hands over both my eyes in the court room so I can’t see the judge
I made miracles with that soda babe
Yea I suppose with that yola babe
Cash Money in my projects, since a Juvenile
Like the Nolia baby

Gave my lil' nigga some money, ""Go buy some pots""
""Take my rental and don't fuck around, the stove is hot""

Spend your last fifteen hun', you know that club shit
You fall off, you get back, can't give up, that shit whack

I hear hoes in my jeans, I weigh bees on them beans
They had stamps on them things, I broke bread with my team
Got them birdies in the attic, countin' currency in the basement

That ambitious ass hustler, yeah I'm tryna post up
Till I can come through in the land, with the dozer
Hit it with that H2O, then it froze up
Back when they was goin' for the two fo', had it sowed up
They pulled me with this nina in this strap it be a felony
If I get through with this nina on my lap, I'm livin' heavenly
Speed ballin' like this shit a sprint, but this a marathon
Phone ringin' all day and night, like a telecom
If you a real hustler you gon' get that, he ain't get it
If you a real hustler you know how to stay committed

It's for my money really, fuck the fame and I ain't playing
See I passed the rock a couple of times, let me assist
Nigga me and ya'll together how the fuck we gonna miss
Nigga all we worry about is how the fuck they gonna flip
Cut the window drop things, I swear to god they gonna trip
Meet the haters meet the feds, now that's gotta be a sign
Smoked a blunt and laughed about it, writing lose my mind
Hit the booth and spazzed out, almost lost my mothafuckin' mind
Bought a mic for these hoes, you know my mothafuckin' grind
Sleep is the cousin of death, and I'm alive
Thug Motivation plus inspiration equals survive
They tryna rob me of this success with no disguise

Cop a four door nigga hop up out it in a suit
Giorgio Armani, still represent the struggle

With the two double R sittin' in the back of my brain
Anywhere but here, that's what I told my sofa
And this shit gettin' heavy, weight of the world on my shoulders
Think you figured it out, but you don't have a clue
Think you on top of the world but the world on top of you
I started hustlin' for draws and now there's plaques on the walls
Think I'm sellin' my soul? Then you can come get 'em all
Trade 'em all for my dawgs, yea, I'm talkin' to you
Where did we go wrong? Because I don't have a clue
You just wanna hit the mall and buy a new pair of shoes
But it's real consequences nigga remember the rules
So I regret the day you ever serve that nigga
Took 5 years of your life, you didn't deserve that nigga
I guess power and pain look it's somewhat the same
I lost my dawg to the fame, I charge it all to the game

Please Lord forgive him, you know he got that thug in him
We lust for alcohol and we love women
And ain't nobody gave us nothin', so we drug dealin'
You know we coppin' Louie loafers just to thug in 'em
And when you made it that far, you should be makin' a toast
Got the seats reclined and I be doin' the most
In the back of this Holy Ghost

I said we came so far but yet it feel so surreal
Hood nigga, half a mili, automobile
I'm talkin' real luxury, don't feel a bump in the road
We ain't like the rest of these niggas that fall out over hoes
Thought you my nigga forever, thought that you could be trusted
Man I found out you takin' it, really had me disgusted
Nigga, who am I kiddin'? It felt like a heart attack
Cause I gave you my heart and didn't ask for it back
And to be honest with you, I really thought we were brothers
Fuck everyone in this world as long as we have each other
Woulda done anyything, took a trafficking charge
Everyday on my head just to see you livin' large
Gangster pitted it kills, gave you your first mill
And I ain't tell you to blow it, I ain't tell you to throw it
You fell a victim to pressure, yea, I know it can stress ya
But you're only a man, homie, I can't be mad at ya

Please Lord forgive him, you know he got that thug in him
We lust for alcohol and we love women
And ain't nobody gave us nothin', so we drug dealin'
You know we coppin' Louie loafers just to thug in 'em
And when you made it that far, you should be makin' a toast

How can ya see out the windows between your shades and your tint
Sippin' good in the back, I'm like fuck it, I'm bent
If it don't make dollars, then it don't make any sense
They sayin' I owe 'em dollars and that don't make any sense
Almost fell for the bait, almost fell for the hate
And I'm the same nigga that let you niggas eat off my plate
Saw that shit from the door, knew that shit from the go
I guess this how I go, sit back and laugh at the show
Remember back in the day a nigga took your shit
Told you don't put it there and a nigga stole your brick
Didn't I put ya back on, did I handle ya wrong?
When niggas start actin' weak that means it time to be strong
See I kept it so real, I ain't keep it real with myself
I'm gone be real with you niggas, I gotta be real with myself
And I'm gone be real with ya homie, look you don't got me convinced
Is this payback for my sins? I guess I gotta repent

If you brought it out to blow, when you got it from the blow

Still the realest nigga in this, y’all know it
Kept it one hundred ‘til the day I came through
My nigga hit me up saying “going out of town”
So I threw him fifty thou, told him “bring me back two”
Not only had my fingers crossed, I prayed
Called this little piece up, got laid
Then he walked in, threw them both on the table said
“Fuck that shit, young nigga get paid”

Took a trip down to see how he was holding up
The wars on now he got shot again
This time he was gone for good then we got it in

The first to admit life's more than two seaters
Man oh man how my priorities fucked up
Remember nights I'm passin' out in the Rari, too fucked up
My niggas say spend it cause you can't take it witcha'
Same time poppin' Cristal, posing for pictures
Ol' smart ass nigga, half right and half wrong
Only problem is he still here and the money gone
Oh me, oh my, give me a natural high
When I think about the nights we threw them Rollie's in the sky
When I was so mother fuckin' clean on 'em, need a tie
Every hater in the club was just wishin' we would die
A hustlers life is filled with decisions he gotta make
Remeber when I got the news I was ready to cry late
Swear my levy was 'bout to break, lost religion and all my faith
I swear I seen the same shit happen to Shake
Can you imagine that look I had on my face?
Saw my nigga layin' still in a box what a waste
Got me feelin' sick, feelin' like I'm 'bout to vomit
I guess a loss ain't shit if you don't learn somethin' from it
Got me pacin' 'round the room, yeah NASCAR nigga

You wanna see a nigga fucked in the game, nigga, don't you?

Still this is what it sounds like when you open your soul
Tell the realest story that was ever told
Riding dirty in the West End, yes, so ambitious
Them chicken plates at Chanterelles was delicious
Po-po closing that BP, the block storage
If I can get them things back down South I'll make a fortune
Fucked around and caught dawg with a nine, now it's a wrap
Gotta find a new game to conquer, I'm thinking rap
And there's a whole new game, new players, I gotta grind
Put them diamonds in my name and my chain, I gotta shine
Stunting everything'll real when we do break bread with 'em
Swear it ain't been the same since the day the FEDs hit 'em
And that's when I traded the scale for the microphone
Fade a few cars, got rid of my last four songs
And just like that, welcome back, my nigga home
Don't look me in the eye, something different, what could be wrong?

I can never let a tear fall down my face
(I can never let a tear fall down my face)
For the niggas like you who ain't with me today

I've been real from the beginning
I can never let a tear fall down my face

I guess this is what it feels like when you're royalty, holmes
And you wake up and the loyalty's gone
Them short sentence niggas come on yeah, feel in the way
Same niggas that were hating back then, still in the way
I swear these niggas think my life is just bitches and Champagne
Iced out, Audemar, just to go with the campaign
Every night Rolls Royce's doing their damn thing
If there was ever a reason to wear all them damn chains
And why you keep a cup in your hand? To numb the pain
Niggas see you on something different, these niggas changed
And I ain't one for dry snitching, won't call no name
So really at the end of the day I can't complain
Five niggas gon' be happy with you and be happy for you
If them niggas scheming on ya demise then they ain't for ya
I'm like not you too, my nigga, I could've died
If I had a weak bone in my body I would've cried

Now I'm driving in a coupe and I can't even think about you
(Aye, where the love at?)
We was counting millions on the living room floor
I forgot, niggas like you don't love back
And I was with you when we kicked in our own first door

Now I'm movin' weight like a trainer and a diet
Used to put the work in a bag and then I tie it
Flashbacks I can't deny, but you tell them police ass niggas ""Bitch I'm retired""

Have mercy on the Lord, please don't let her hurt again
God you blessed my auntie Brenda be the living proof
Had a tumour in the brain size of a grapefruit
It's for them ghetto saviours that's living major
Now they missing like the flight 370 to Malaysia
We was skinning and grinning, thought we was winning
Heard it's hot in Hell so I'm packing linen
And lately my conscience been shaking me, waking me right about my sleep
Keep it 100, I ain't slipping 'bout a week, hey look
Gotta do it for my little cousin Trasity
See her boyfriend took her life
When I think about the daughter that she left behind
Pardon me, can't let see a gangsta cry, Lord have mercy

Have have mercy, have have mercy
On my soul, shine on me
Lord shine on, oh

I was lost in a world-wind, now I'm sorry
Five different baby mama's coulda been on Maury
Staying up all night, smoking purp for hours
Can't even get my ass off to church a couple hours
Beefing with the enemy, teaching my son wrong things
In and out the hospital on that strong lean
Looking at the phone ring knowing it's my auntie
Knowing that she tryna pray for me, but I don't accept it
Now I'm selfish, not to others but myself
'Cause I'm feeling like nobody know my struggle, just my wealth
But that was then and this is now and since you gave me another chance
God man I'mma promise I make ya proud
Lotta times I screamed to ya, felt like you ain't hear me
You ain't heard me 'cause I wasn't worthy, sins dirty dirty
Thugs cry, no lie had to hit my niece
Like please please, have mercy on me

Have have mercy, have have mercy
On my soul, shine on me
Lord shine on, oh",Mercy on My Soul,2015

I got them boys slingin rocks in the lobby for me
I'm rich bitch, ballin just a hobby for me

[Chorus]
I got a pocket full of money and my wrist all froze
So fuck what you heard we don't love them hoes, heeyyy
Do the damn thang, do the damn thang
A nigga might grin but it ain't still funny
Got a pocket fulla that, do the damn thang money, heeyy
Do the damn thang, do the damn thang

[Young Jeezy]
My phone is tapped and so is my livin room
We can't hide the money here, we need a bigger room
Let me show you what I stand fo,
Jesus Schwarzenegger call me commando
On that Remy Martin, nigga matta fact
I ain't Fat Joe but I can make em lean back
Save your ammo don't waste it
Got him dodgin bullets like he in the matrix
Jeans strapped and ya better dip
Carvin 15, got six clips
Pilsbury nigga, got a lotta dough
Call me bossan george, got a lotta hoes
They place orders, so I bake cakes
I'm a bodybuilder, pump a lotta weight
You see the diamonds in my damn chain
It ain't hard to tell, I do the damn thang

[Chorus]

[Fabolous]
You waitin instead of participatin with them boys
You skatin on them 22 datins like them boys
I'm hatin that they communicatin with them boys
I'm waitin just to send them to Satan for that shit
They see a nigga stones look sick
And I gotta stack of singles in my hand that's phone booth thick
'Cause I'm so hood rich
That I'm no good bitch
And even if she gotta pimp then a hoe should switch
And get ridda that shit spitta, get wit her, shit gitter
sit wit her, hit spitter, that don't bitch chitter
My style fit wit her
I tell her you don went left now you need to go right like a switch hitta
I know them tricks bitter
When I'm in the six with her
So I'm in a mix with her
forty four six with her
And I'm higher than a motherfucker
But a nigga try then he gon die in this motherfucker

Jef Lee Johnson,"You see this girl, this girl's in love with you
Yes, I'm in love, who looks at you the way I do?
When you smile I can tell we know each other very well
How can I show you that I'm glad I got to know you?

Cause I've heard some talk, they say you think I'm fine
This girl's in love and what I'd do to make you mine?
Tell me now is it so? Don't let me be the last to know
My hands are shaking, don't let my heart keep breaking

Cause I need your love, I want your love
Say you're in love and you'll be my guy
If not I'll just die

Jef Neve,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I cry for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul
I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me
you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul
I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive
That you'd turn away
from romance
Are you pretending
Don't say it's the ending
Unless I can have
one more chance to prove dear
My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours
for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender
Myself to you body and soul

Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me,
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me!

Above all, I want my arms about you!

Come to papa, come to papa, do!

Jef Neve,"The evening breeze
Caressed the trees
Tenderly
The trembling trees
Embraced the breeze
Tenderly

Then you and I
Came wandering by
And lost in a sigh
Were we

The shore was kissed
By sea and mist
Tenderly
I can't forget
How two hearts met
Breathlessly

Your arms opened wide
And closed me inside
You took my lips
You took my love
So tenderly",Tenderly,2010
Jef Neve,"Love makes me treat you

The way that I do
Gee baby, ain't I good to you

There's nothing in this whole world too good
For a boy so sweet and true
Gee, baby ain't I good to you

Bought you a fur coat for Christmas
Diamond ring
Big Cadillac car and everything
What makes me treat you
