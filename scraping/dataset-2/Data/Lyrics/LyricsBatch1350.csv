Wo-o-oo-wo-wo, 
Wo-o-oo-wo-wo, 
Wo-o-oo-wo-wo
When the deep purple falls
Over sleepy garden walls
And the stars begin to twinkle in the night
In the mist of a memory
You wander all back to me
Breathing my name with a sigh

In the still of the night
Once again I hold you tight
Tho' you're gone your love lives on when light beams
And as long as my heart will beat
Sweet lover, we'll always meet
Here in my deep purple dreams

When the deep purple falls
Over sleepy garden walls
And the stars begin to twinkle
In the night
In the mist of a memory
You wander all back to me
Breathing my name with a sigh

Once again I hold you tight
Tho' you're gone your love lives on when moonlight beams
And as long as my heart will beat

Brian Wilson,"Well its been building up inside of me
For oh I don't know how long
I don't know why
But I keep thinking
Something's bound to go wrong
But she looks in my eyes
And makes me realize
And she says ""don't worry baby""
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Everything will turn out alright
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
I guess I should've kept my mouth shut
When I started to brag about my car
But I can't back down now
I pushed the other guys too far
She makes me come alive
And makes me want to drive
When she says ""don't worry baby""
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Everything will turn out alright
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
She told me ""baby, when you race today
Just take along my love with you
And if you know how much I loved you
Baby nothing could go wrong with you""
Oh what she does to me
When she makes love to me
And she says ""don't worry baby""
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Everything will turn out alright

Baby I'm sad
I feel you inside every time
I breathe
When I kissed your mouth 

You made me feel strong. 
You were my life from that first kiss
I knew you better than I knew myself
But I thought we had Forever, baby

I'd always be the one you needed 
Goodbyes came to fast
Precious moments last
You were the only one 

The one who could have made it 
Last Forever 

[Houdini]
Baby I miss you too
I spent my life trying 
to capture a dream 
When I touched your face

I burned with desire
Though our souls are worlds apart 
You're living in my heart

[Both]
But I thought we had Forever, baby
I'd always be the one you needed

My heart beats to the memory of you

Love is the only thing that's true

Brian Wilson,"I, I love the colorful clothes she wears. 
And she's already
Workin' on my brain. 
I, I only looked in her eyes, but I picked
Up something I just can't explain. 

[Chorus]
I'm pickin' up good vibrations, 
She's giving me excitations. 

Good, good, good - good vibrations. 

I, I bet I know what she's like. 
And I can feel how right she'd be for me. 

It's weird, how she comes in so strong. 
And I wonder what she's pickin' up from me? 

[Chorus]

I don't know where but she sends me there - 
Ah my my, what a sensation!
Ah my my, what an elation!

Gotta keep those lovin' good
Vibrations a-happenin' with her. 

Ah  good, good, good, good vibrations.",Good Vibrations,1996

Let it shine, oh, let it shine.
Let it shine, oh, let it shine.
Let it shine, oh, let it shine.

Shadows fall.
The ocean calls to me.
The night is still.
She's where I want to be.
The stars all send
Their silver light to me.
Forever shine;
On me eternally.

I couldn't think of anything
That gives me more than what you bring.
The color of an endless dream.
Let it shine,
Let it shine.

There comes a burning fire,
It fills me with desire,
And all my troubles disappear.
Feels like it's goin' through me,
Whatever you do to me;
Your words are magic to my ears.
Let it shine.

A flame that grows,
And burns so deep in me.
Somebody cries
For all the world to see.
Another time,
There will be ectasy.
Another place,
You will be next to me.

Of all the lives that I've been through,
I never really thought it was true;
That all I ever needed was you.
Let it shine.
Let it shine.

Let it shine, oh, let it shine.
Let it shine, oh, let it shine.
Let it shine, oh, let it shine.

Brian Wilson,"So many times I've had that helpless feeling
But no-one or any kind of medicine worked at all
It seems to me that I seem to be overheating
A midnight ride with you might cure it all

Let's go to Heaven in my car 
I wanna drive you there tonight
Let's go to Heaven in my car 
We won't be stopping for red lights
Huggin' the kerbs and I'm out of control
Going eye to eye with the radio
Let's go to Heaven in my car

I only know it's time for body contact
I'll never be satisfied touching you with my eyes
There ain't no doubt I can't go without your loving
So come on baby let me take you for a ride

Let's go to Heaven in my car 
I wanna drive you there tonight
Let's go to Heaven in my car

We've got all night to get there

Brian Wilson,"GO!
I'm gonna wake you up early cause I'm gonna take a ride with you.
We're goin' down to the Honda shop, I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
Put on a ragged sweatshirt, I'll take you where you want me to.

First gear, it's all right (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)
Second gear, I'll lean right (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)
Third gear, hang on tight (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)
Faster, it's all right.

It's not a big motorcycle,
Just a groovy little motorbike.
It's more fun than a barrel of monkeys,
That two-wheeled bike.
We'll ride on out of town
To anyplace I know you like.

First gear, it's all right (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)
Second gear, I'll lean right (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)
Third gear, hang on tight (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)
Faster, it's all right.

It climbs the hills like a Matchless,
Cause my Honda' built really light.
When I go in to the turns
Better hang on tight.
I'd better turn on the lights
So we can ride my Honda tonight.

First gear, it's all right (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)

Brian Wilson,"Wouldn't It Be Nice

Wouldn't it be nice if we were older
Then we wouldn't have to wait so long
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
In the kind of world where we belong

You know its gonna make it that much better
When we can say goodnight and stay together

Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
In the morning when the day is new
And after having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through

Happy times together we've been spending
I wish that every kiss was never ending
Wouldn't it be nice

Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray it might come true
Baby then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
We could be married
And then we'd be happy

Wouldn't it be nice

You know it seems the more we talk about it
It only makes it worse to live without it
But lets talk about it
Wouldn't it be nice

Sleep tight my baby",Pet Sounds,1996
Brian Wilson,"In Hawaii there's a place known as Waimea Bay
Where the best surfers in the world come to stay
And ride the wild surf they come to try
To conquer those waves some 30 feet high

[Chorus:]
Ride ride ride the wild surf
Ride ride ride the wild surf
Ride ride ride the wild surf
Gotta take that one last ride

Surf fever brings them here to meet the test
And hanging round the beach you'll see the best
They're waxed up and ready just waiting for
The surf to build up on the northern shore

[Chorus]

Lined up and waiting for that next big set outside
Nothing can stop it cause you've just gotta ride ride ride ride ride
The heavies at the pipeline are okay
But they can't match the savage surf at Waimea Bay
It takes a lot of skill and courage unknown
To catch the last wave and ride it in alone
Ride ride ride the wild surf
Ride ride ride the wild surf
Ride ride ride the wild surf
Gotta take that one last
Gotta take that one last ride

[Chorus]",Ride the Wild Surf,1996
Brian Wilson,"Two girls for every boy

I bought a '30 Ford wagon and we call it a woodie (Surf City, here we come)
You know it's not very cherry, it's an oldie but a goodie (Surf City, here we come)
Well, it ain't got a back set or a rear window
But it still gets me where I wanna go

[Chorus]
And we're goin' to Surf City, 'cause it's two to one
You know we're goin' to Surf City, gonna have some fun
You know we're goin' to Surf City, 'cause it's two to one
You know we're goin' to Surf City, gonna have some fun, now
Two girls for every boy

You know they never roll the streets up 'cause there's always somethin' goin' 
(Surf City, here we come)
You know they're either out surfin' or they got a party growin' (Surf City, here we come)
Yeah, and there's two swingin' honeys for every guy
And all you gotta do is just wink your eye

[Chorus]

And if my woody breaks down on me somewhere on the surf route (Surf City, here we come)
I'll strap my board to my back and hitch a ride in my wetsuit (Surf City, here we come)

Its plain to see
That Ive been looking everywhere
But somehow no one seemed to care

Where has our love been
All my life

Now and then it seems as though you get it right

Another song on the beach
I take a trip through the past
When summer's way out of reach
Another walk in the park
When I need something to do
And when I feel all alone
Sometimes I think about you
You take my hand
Smile and say you don't understand
To look in your eyes
And see what you feel
And then realize that nothing's for real
'Cause you know it's just

Your imagination running wild

Another bucket of sand
Another wave and the pier
I miss the way that I used
To call the shots around here
You know it would've been nice
If I had something to do
I took a trip through the past
And got to spend it with you
You take my hand
Smile and say you don't understand

Little children they're marching along
On a sunny mountain without any cares
Little children they're marching along

Marching along, siging a song
Making rhythm and rhyme
It used to be somthing to see
They don't keep track of the time

If the rain comes down
They put on their coats
Little children they're marching along
If it gets too floody
They get in their boats
Little children they're marching along

Marching along, siging a song
Making rhythm and rhyme
It used to be somthing to see
They don't keep track of the time

Poor little wendy she's too scared to speak
Little children they're marching along
And look at little carnie with dirt on her cheek
Little children they're marching along
It's three fifteen it's time to go home
Little children they're marching along
You can't kiss no one until you get home
Little children they're marching along
Marching along
Marching along
Marching along
Marching along
Marching along
Marching along
Marching along

In my room, in my room

Nine-thirty on a Tuesday night,

Call it compulsive,

A matter of conditioning,
A matter of fact.

Oh, what to think about.

Just listening and re-listening,
To Smiley Smile.
And wondering if this is some kind of creative drought
Because I'm

Singing ""Fun, Fun, Fun""

Somewhere in a placid pool and sink

And lay before me holy, holy cow

Go let in the neighbor's 'cause they're knockin'
So open the door

And it gives me such a great big lift
Makes me want to give myself a gift

Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night.

Three Wise men came from country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went.

O'er Bethlehem it took its rest
And there it did both Pause and stay
Right o'er the place where Jesus lay.

Full reverently upon their knee
And offered there in His presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.

With our hand on the lifeline

Brave riding the wave

And it's plain you see through

There is a roar coming from shore
Cracking a glacier no more
When there was life
They would implore

Live, let live
Not die

My heart beats so fast
(Heart beat, heart beat, heart beat)

Makes one wonder all right
Breaking of ice at such a price
Time for some kindly advice

Polarization, the talk of the nation
Explain to me why
Hearts are turning to warming
Painful games with thunder raining a warning

There is a roar coming from shore
Fussing and fighting and war
We have so much peace we should explore

Live, let live, let
Love is what living is for

Your heart beats with mine
(Heart beat, heart beat, heart beat)
Our hearts beat in time
(Heart beat, heart beat, heart beat)

Be true creatures of grace
Need over ice their paradise
Let them survive our embrace

Turns up the volume and shows off its rays
Another Dodger-blue sky is crowning L.A.
The City of Angels is rushed every day
That lucky old sun smiles on me
Wanna slide down the mountain to the dancin' sea

I'm rockin' to the morning beat
It's risin' from star studded concrete
This city has my favorite soundtrack
It makes you wanna move even though it's laid back
Take it in stride it'll kick start your feet
When you're tuned in to the morning beat

Driving through the maze of the Hollywood Hills
Headed to the ocean for a view that would kill
Watching from the Wheel in Santa Monica Pier
A million diamonds floating on heavenly tiers
The gentle wind won't make a sound
Even though it's forcing the waves to crown

Maw, maw, miama glory, Hallelujah
Maw, maw, miama glory, Hallelujah

Hear those guitars gently strummin'
Hear the voices softly hummin'
It's hard to feel down living in this town
But you're so far away
It's a long long way from January
All the way to December

Even when the sun and I cannot sleep
There's an unspoken promise that we keep
We'll party all night into another day
And keep the golden glow of L.A.

Wishin' it would come again your way
Down below a sparkled city scatters by the bay
Tells you your suspicions are in play
One by one, a carpet of star spangled city sleeps
Like so many dancing diamonds with a beat
Each of them a home with walls of stories they could tell
Meet the crack of dawn. A freeway starts to roll
An owl hoots its last goodbye to a coyote on patrol

Will you find the heartbeat in L.A.?",Room with a View [Narrative],2008

And when you wake up here
You wake up everywhere

In the flow of the ocean
And the warmth of the rains
Heard music in the air
And in the waves

Nodded off in a bad dream
Woke up in history

Surfers in the West
The sun ran into the sea
As we headed home
We drove into a movie
Love songs, pretty girls
Didn't want it to end
Tried to slow down the motion
So it could move us again

Like live shrimp dropped on a hot wok
Hucksters, hustlers and hawkers
Set up their boardwalk shops
Home for all the homeless, hopeless, well heeled, and deranged
Still, nothing here seems out of place or strange.
There's an old smudge of a Beatnik by the bay
Lookin' like a dog who's had his day
Like a dream, he drifts away

After all the loves of my life
You'll still be the one

Or just the one who plays the part?

Happy to be the proof

Because you're simply the truth

Will you stay with me, will you be my love among the fields of barley?

But I swear in the days still left we'll walk in fields of gold

I was waiting for the phone
And hoping you would say
Get undressed and look your best for me.
About every night
Before I go to bed
I take another look at
At what you took and said
Thinking, more or less, the more regrets for me.
Now it feels like forever,
It's all been a dream,
But I wonder, do you think of me?

Early in the morning,
Late in the evening,
Back in the summertime
When you were mine, you see.
You made me so crazy,
Shocked and amazed me.
You were my tear to cry,
My lullaby to sing.
Now I wanna be, I gotta be your girl.
I just wanna be, I gotta be your girl.

So when you told me, baby,
That you needed time,
Well did you mean to say
You needed peace of mind?
'Cause, well, you cheated me
And treated me so bad.
If I could take back
I know I would for sure.
Back to rainy days
And kisses at my door.
Remember when's
The now and thens we had.
And now I'm not mistaken,
It is what it seems.
But I wonder, would you still want me?

Deceiving me.

Side niggas hating bitches blocking like Kareem and him
Rolling with this nigga here, everything you dream is real
Please believe me we do this shit for no reason
Baby welcome to the fast life, switch gears now I'm spinnin'
In my lane, Ruff Rydin' like the LOX boy
Stop drop, shut 'em down, open up shop boy

I just pull up to the spot boy
Like I'm fresh up off the lot boy
Niggas say I do a lot boy
'Cause I'm spending cash money like a Hott Boyy
Stop thinking you the man, 'cause you not boy
You be looking like them cops boy
See you bitch and I bet she getting copped boy
'Cause I'm spending cash money like a Hott Boyy

Hunnids, fifties, I just flip 'em every mornin'
Like they pancakes in the kitchen
See me dripping, see me pourin'
Cut the gas then I floor it, pull up to the spot
They aiming for the target, I'm Kennedy in the drop

Everybody get your roll on, smash smash nigga
Cash money, cash money, talkin' fast fast bitch
Guerilla warfare but Juveniles gon' smash nigga
Pull up to the spot with 200 on the dash, damn
The AP done nearly broke my wrist
I whip it fast, whip it fast, I gave my wrist a ticket
When you hear that ""brrr brrr"", know I got no chickens
I took some bands on your head and then you meet my crew

I just pull up to the spot boy
Like I'm fresh up off the lot boy
Niggas say I do a lot boy
'Cause I'm spending cash money like a Hott Boyy
Stop thinking you the man, 'cause you not boy
You be looking like them cops boy
See you bitch and I bet she getting copped boy
'Cause I'm spending cash money like a Hott Boyy

Cash money, Young gettin' that cash money
Supercharger on the 'Vette now I look like a crash dummy
$50,000 On a Porsche, she ain't said nothin'
Hey, yeah nigga I became a breadwinner
I've never said nothing for the fetty, can I rub ya?
Foreign shoes they give me bunions
I blowin' O's like a Funyun
Abc, all about cummin'
Nigga cannot act tough, know he not boy
You my target, with a dot on your eye boy
I'ma buy, I'm not leasing it
I though my dick gon' feature it
I'm in Memphis, no Bleek, lil bitch
Hammer, I don't want keep the bitch
I'm screaming the tech game
And I got birds you know my wrist game, rap game

I just pull up to the spot boy
Like I'm fresh up off the lot boy
Niggas say I do a lot boy
'Cause I'm spending cash money like a Hott Boyy
Stop thinking you the man, cause you not boy

Brice Conrad,"Sur une arme les doigts noués
Pour agresser, serrer les poings
Mais nos paumes sont pour aimer
Y'a pas de caresse en fermant les mains

Longues, jointes en une prière
Bien ouvertes pour acclamer
Dans un poing les choses à soustraire
On ne peut rien tendre les doigts pliés

Quand on ouvre nos mains
Suffit de rien dix fois rien
Suffit d'une ou deux secondes
À peine un geste, un autre monde
Quand on ouvre nos mains

Mécanique simple et facile
Des veines et dix métacarpiens
Des phalanges aux tendons dociles
Et tu relâches ou bien tu retiens

Et des ongles faits pour griffer
Poussent au bout du mauvais côté
Celui qui menace ou désigne
De l'autre on livre nos vies dans des lignes

Quand on ouvre nos mains
Suffit de rien dix fois rien
(Suffit de rien dix fois rien)
Suffit d'une ou deux secondes
A peine un geste, un autre monde
Quand on ouvre nos mains

Un simple geste d'humain
Quand se desserrent ainsi nos poings
Quand s'écartent nos phalanges
Sans méfiance, une arme d'échange
Des champs de bataille en jardin

Le courage du signe indien
Un cadeau d'hier à demain
Rien qu'un instant d'innocence
Un geste de reconnaissance
Quand on ouvre comme un écrin

Quand on ouvre nos mains

Suffit d'une ou deux secondes
À peine un geste, un autre monde
Quand on ouvre nos mains

Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

And don't want a playa that can kiss all over town.
Who's these girl stripping all over my Mercedes seat,
I can stand a man who thinks he looks better than me,
I'm looking for a brother who likes to have fun,
A fly gentlemen that who knows how to please.

Last thing I need is a man who's soft, 
He better get it on up, and break me off,
Some body fly high, who's 6'5,

She'd rather slow one and grow a damn high
Living in the hood is like walkin' on a landmine
Yeah, come on

Watch me shake it to the left and copy it up on the right
Me gots the goods to deliver
I got the mind to shiver
Come for rockin'
Come for rockin'
It's in the pocket
No one can stop it, yeah

There's brown girl in the ring

Way she move, got me in her hypnotic ways
Her voice maneuvers, got me thinking bout her day to day
See I'm faced with beauty, there's nothing more for me to say
Put on the dance floor and play with Obie
And it's no cliche, O's great like the lake
So she pon'd the river her way of doing the snake
Jamaican God, make a true playa break
Say it ain't so, ya truth is fate
Incense lit when she's interested in insertion

Giving you the business, hurting em

Realest nigga on this song is Obie

Way she move, got me in her hypnotic ways
Her voice maneuvers, got me thinking bout her day to day
See I'm faced with beauty, there's nothing more for me to say
Put on the dance floor and play with Obie
And it's no cliche, O's great like the lake
So she pon'd the river her way of doing the snake
Jamaican God, make a true playa break
Say it ain't so, ya truth is fate
Incense lit when she's interested in insertion
Any minute ya squirting, she gifted in
Giving you the business, hurting em

They say if you don't play you can't win

But he never had any words to say
He walked beside you then and he left you alone

Rest your feet before you explode

And if the pains ends when you die
And I wonder if there was
Some better way to say good-bye

Today my heart is big and sore
It's trying to put right through my skin
Won't see you anymore
I guess that's finally sinking in

Bride,"If plowshares could speak and the lost seek
They would find themselves together
When the new world comes the face of the sun
New wine for all the pain

I know you will catch me when I cannot see
I've walked in these shoes up to my knees
I've birthed a mountain that is had to climb
Weary well doing I will make the time

I'm the one
I'm the one
That is what I've become
I'm The One

I dig in the dirt my hands bleed
If answers is why we pray
Let us bow our heads today

Bridget Ball,"I went home for Christmas
To the house that I grew up in
Going back was something after all these years
I drove down Monterey Street
And felt a little sadness
When I turned left on Laurel and the house appeared
And I snuck up to that rocking chair
Where the winter sunlight slanted on the screened-in porch
And I stared out past the shade tree
That my laughing daddy planted on the day that I was born

And I let time go by so slow
And I made every moment last
And I thought about years
How they take so long
And they go so fast

Across the street the Randol's oldest daughter must have come home
Her two boys built a snowman by the backyard swings
I thought of old man Randol and his Christmas decorations
And how he used to leave them up till early spring

And I though of all the summers
That I paced that porch and swore I'd die of boredom there
And I thought of what I'd give to feel another summer linger
Where a day feels like a year

And I let time go by so slow
And I made every moment last
And I thought about years
How they take so long
And they go so fast

Tell us should we run away, should we try and stay?
Or is better just to let things be?

Your assets in their face
But it's gonna take more than a gold-cut girl
For you to take my place
Life is not a competition
If it is, you've lost the race
'Cause the melody's all that matters,
Not the piercing on your face
When are you ever gonna learn
That the boys aren't yours

[Chorus]

I think it's pretty funny
How I thought we could be friends
But you proved to me your unloyalty
And here is where it ends
Your sudden isolation
Doesn't take me by surprise

That the boys aren't yours

But then you came to me with something that was nothing, and you kept coming back

I'm telling you to stay away, boy you're really driving me crazy
Still there's something that you've got inside and you're trying to show me
Everything I've wanted I'm breaking down
I think I'm coming around

Coming around, coming around, coming around

Now I find you're on my mind more and more as time goes by
All day, every day boy you're really driving me crazy
Still there's something that you've got inside and you're trying to show me

Briege Murphy,"There is a young cowboy, he lives on the range
His horse and his cattle are his only companions
He works in the saddle and sleeps in the canyons
Waiting for summer, his pastures to change
And as the moon rises he sits by his fire
Thinking about women and glasses of beer
And closing his eyes as the doggies retire
He sings out a song which is soft but it's clear
As if maybe someone could hear

Goodnight you moonlight ladies
Rockabye sweet baby James
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose
Won't you let me go down in my dreams
And rockabye sweet baby James

Now the first of December was covered with snow
So was the turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston
The Berkshires seemed dream-like on account of that frosting
With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go

There's a song that they sing when they take to the highway
A song that they sing when they take to the sea
A song that they sing of their home in the sky
Maybe you can believe it if it helps you to sleep
But singing works just fine for me

So goodnight you moonlight ladies
Rockabye sweet baby James
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose
Won't you let me go down in my dreams
And rockabye sweet baby James",Sweet Baby James,

Where do they all come from?

Where do they all belong?

Of a sermon that no one will hear

You give your soul so sweetly

Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

Is a love I can be sure of

Is lonely and silent, the shades are all drawn,
And my heart is heavy as I gaze upon

The lawn we were proud of is waving in hay,
Our beautiful garden has withered away,
Where you planted roses,the weeds seem to say,
A cottage for sale.

From every single window, I see your face,
But when I reach a window, there's empty space.
The key's in the mail box the same as before,
But no one is waiting any more,
The end of the story is told on the door.

M’alzo dal letto
Faccio colazione, cappuccino e cornetto
Non ricordo bene cosa ho fatto e che ho detto
Ieri in ""presa bene"", forse un po’ sotto effetto
Oggi in spiaggia la ganja, due tiri a calcetto
Prendiamo da bere, ce l’ho io il braccialetto
Due consumazioni e mi si butta sul petto
Mi son risparmiato anche l’approccio diretto
Io già me la immagino ad angelo retto
Sciolgo i suoi capelli e penso a darci dentro
Lei si fa i castelli che neanche un architetto
Io sono un bastardo e non dimostro rispetto
Mi hai scelto, comprendi il concetto diretto
Scendo con la mano e tento il colpo diretto
Lei mi tira il cocktail spaccandomi il setto
È lo stesso uccello in fondo a farci da tetto
E l’ammetto, nessuno è perfetto

Ma no, e allora baciami
Prima che parta il treno
Se vuoi risorgeremo
Tu sei la cosa più bella che ho
Cosa resta di noi?
Da quando qualche parte andremo
E se non è sereno
Tu già lo sai che ti perdonerò
Io ti perdonerò

Hai un talento
So che la vedrò allo stesso stabilimento
Mi avvicinerò gettando gli alibi al vento
Le chiederò scusa per il comportamento
Immaturo, ti giuro che già me ne pento
Ho un materassino, andiamo a largo un momento
Io che do uno sguardo al suo sedere scoperto
La prova costume lei la passa con cento
Già sento gli ormoni in fermento
Svengo, prendimi come se fossi un tuo complimento
Esci questa sera, dammi un appuntamento
Lei mi dice ""ho le valigie pronte in albergo
Se non mi saluti mi offendo""

Parte la musica e sale la ruota

A volte è così bello non avere controllo 
Senza avere il peso del mondo sul collo

And I will be on the floor
Watching the TV, trying hard to find a reason to move
I'm frozen in one place, staring at the screen
Listening to the rain falling on the street

Some days go on too long
And no one can hang out tonight
Here, where the carpet is cool and soft
Underneath the clock I feel my weary heart is put to rest

You gather around your friends
The connection that you feel when the night has not yet died
You are new with a promise of a love
You will probably never find

And touch that you can really feel
The brokenness inside as hope and less collide
Now nothing is real

And when you touch me I shake like a child
It's late, I'm afraid you might leave

'Cause sometimes it seems like you still don't believe me
There's nothing I can do to concentrate
It's so distracting always thinking of you
So I expose and explain and I meant everything that I said

And it's moments like this that repeat and replay in my head
When I'm laying in bed

It's a beautiful, beautiful time
As you laugh and roll onto your stomach

The carpet embraces your design
My heart pounds as I lay by your side
And I find that I am unable to hide 
All these feelings that flow
In this basement and in this dim light
You look so beautiful
I'm unsure and unclear with the words that I say
I'm happy when you are near and I wish that forever could stay

Try pacing to keep awake.
Laying around, no school today.
Just drink until the clock has circled all the way.

Of a house that is quiet
Except for unanswered telephones.
You stand near the sink,
You mix up a drink.
You think you don't want to pass out
Where your roommates could find you again.
Stumble 'round the neighboorhod, nothing to do.
You're always looking for something
To sniff smoke or swallow.
Calling over next door, see what they've got.
But you would settle for anything
That would make your brain slow down or
Stop this circle of thoughts you chase
Before they catch back up with you.
And your parents notice your thinning face,
All the weight you've lost,
All the weight you're losing.
You said ""I'm done feeling like a skeleton,
No more sleep walking dead.""
You're going to wake from this coma.
You're going to crawl from this bed you've made.
Stop counting on the camera
That hangs around your neck,
Cause it will never remember what you choose to forget.

And you try to find one source of light,
Try to name one thing you like.
You used to have such a longer list,
And light, you never had to look for it.

But now it's so easy, it's so easy to
It's so easy, it's so easy to
Second guess everything you do
Until all you want, all you want is to

Seems like it's every night now.","A Line Allows Progress, A Circle Does Not",2000

On a fresh new mound of dirt

Ripping apart the sheets that dressed his bed
Crying out loud for someone to help him

Something that would make me never want another
Something that would make it so that nothing matters
All would be clear then

But I guess I'll have to settle for a for a few brief moments
And watch all dissolve into a single second
And try to write it down into a perfect sonnet
Or one foolish line

Because that's all that you'll get so you'll have to accept
You are here and then you're gone

Thrown into the ocean in the worst of weather

And left there to drown
Left there to drown
In their innocence
But as for me I'm coming to the final chapter

I read all of the pages and there is still no answer
Only all that was before I know must soon come after
That is the only way it can be
So I stand in the sun

And I breathe with my lungs
Trying to spare myself the weight of the truth
Saying everything you have ever seen was just a mirror
And you've spent your whole life sweating in an endless fever

And now you are laying ina bathtum full of freezing water
Wishing you were a ghost
But once you knew a girl and you named her lover
And danced with her in kitchens through the greenest summer

But autumn came, she disappeared
You don't remember where she said she was going to
But you know that she is gone because she left you a song
That you don't want to sing

We're singing I believe that lovers should be chained together
And thrown into a fire with their songs and letters
And left there to burn in their arrogance
But as for me I'm coming to my final failure

I've killed myself with changes trying to make it better
But I still ended up becoming something other than what I had planned to be

And laid entwined together on a bed of clover

To tell of their coming

Does he know that place below your neck that is your favorite to be touched
And does he cry through broken sentences like I love you far too much?
Does he lay awake listening to your breath?
Worried that you smoke too many cigarettes.
Is he coughing now on a bathroom floor?

In some standard refrain.
They will recite their sadness

Like I don't belong
Like the ground's not mine to walk upon
And I've heard that music
Echo through the house
Where my grandmother drank
By herself
And I sat watching a flower
As it was withering
I was embarrassed by its honesty
So I'd prefer to be remembered as a smiling face

And hung round like echoes 
Or ripples on a pond
So you circled the globe 
Spent a year on the road
Without ever going home
More than a couple of days
Then you leave right away
Run to a girl you barely know
But you like how she sings 
And you can't help but think
That there's something that she knows 
And could teach you

Well you're sleeping in that southern state 
Where the bars are filled 
With people you can't hate
But try as you try 
You still can't relate to them
You drink that whiskey down 
As they ask you:
Are you who you say you are?
The fact that we can't tell
Makes us like you even more

So now you're trying again 
Or just visiting friends
One had just had his heart broke
For the first time in his life 
He realized there are times
When you can't make it alone
So now you are giving advice 
As if you had the right
To use a word like love
It's a negotiable term
What gets said's not what is heard
So it's different then for everyone

But you've been hanging 
Around that college town
With your new life
Your new lover you found
And you are keeping her up at night

But I think we have to walk
Keep waving at the taxis
They keep turning the lights on
But Julie knows a party at some actor's westide loft
Supplies are endless in the evening
By the morning they'll be gone
And everything is lonely
I can be my own best friend
I get a coffee and the paper
Have no phone conversations
With the sidewalk and the pigeons
And my window reflection
When I start polishing in the evening
By the morning looks like shit

And I know you have a heavy heart
I can feel it when we kiss
So many men stronger than me
Have thrown their backs out trying to live
Yeah but me I'm not a gamble
You can count on me to split
But what I tell you in the evening
By the morning won't make sense

You looking skinny like a model
With your eyes all painted black
Just keep going to the bathroom
Only say you'll be right back
Well it takes one to know one kid
I think you've got it bad
But what's so easy in the evening
By the morning it's such a drag

Got a flask inside my pocket
We can share it on the train
And if you promise to stay conscious
I'll try to do the same
Well we might die from that medicine
But we sure killed all the pain
What was normal in the evening
By the morning seems insane

And I'm not sure what the trouble was
What started all of this
The reasons all have run away
But the feeling never did
It's not something I would recommend
But it is one way to live
Cause what is simple in the moonlight
By the morning never is
It was simple in the moonlight
Now it's so complicated",Lua,2004

I write my blue songs with m blue pen. I sing the blue notes to my blue friends. Now I don't know that much about you but I like you because you are true blue.

I had a blue dream about a blue star. In it I drove there in a blue car. And when I got there I met a blue dog with a blue tongue, we had real fun. We bounced a blue ball. It broke a blue glass. We banged on blue drums and called it bluegrass. I guess the thing I'm trying to tell you is that it is best kid if you're true blue.

Once I had gangrene. I had it real bad. And so the Doc came with his black bag. I said ""You know doc, I don't feel well. If you had a blue bag I think I'd get well."" So he came right back with a blue sack. He said ""Will this do?"" I said, ""Why not? Yeah.""
That is how I am here today to tell you that it is best man to be true blue. 

Out on the blue sea I sailed a blue ship. I had a first mate that always had blue lips. His name was Bluebeard. He had a weird twitch. We flew a blue flag up on a big stick. And we ate bluegill and we ate blue chips. Oh, I felt real blue eating that blue fish. Because there ain't much that I won't do unless it keeps me from being true blue. 

Once in a blue moon there is a blue sky. I wear blue jeans and fly my blue kite. It hangs like a bluebird until the wind dies and then the tears pour out of my blue eyes.

I was lonely and empty as a canteen
With no anesthetic you're found to be sore

The sun came out of nowhere like a bar fight

Get eaten off the web
We must rip out all the epilogues
From the books that we have read
And to the face of every criminal
Strapped firmly to a chair
We must stare, we must stare, we must stare

We must take all of the medicine
Too expensive now to sell
Set fire to the preacher
Who is promising us hell
And in the ear of every anarchist
That sleeps but doesn't dream
We must sing, we must sing, we must sing

While my mother waters plants
My father loads his gun
He says death will give us back to god
Just like the setting sun
Its return to the lonesome ocean

And then they splashed into the deep blue sea
It was a wonderful splash

We must blend into the choir
Sing a static with the whole
We must memorize nine numbers
And deny we have a soul
And in this endless race for property
And privilege to be one
We must run, we must run, we must run

We must hang up in the belfry
Where the bats and moonlight laugh
We must stare into a crystal ball
And only see the past
And into the caverns of tomorrow
With just our flashlights and our love
We must plunge, we must plunge, we must plunge
And then we'll get down there
Way down to the very bottom of everything
And then we'll see it, we'll see it, we'll see it

I don't know where I am, I don't know where I've been
But I know where I want to go

And so I'd thought I'd let you know
That these things take forever, I especially am slow
But I realized that need you
And I wondered if I could come home

I remember the time you drove all night
Just to meet me in the morning
And I thought it was strange, you said everything changed

And you said
""This is the first day of my life
I'm glad I didn't die before I met you

As I'm leaving she wakes up and says
""I dreamed you were carried away on the crest of a wave

And one's pointing his tree branch at me
So I put my hands up I say
""Enough is enough, if you walk away I walk away""

It will pass away like a slow parade
It's leaving but I don't know how soon

You'd think after twenty-two years I'd be used to the spin
And it only feels worse when I stay in one place
So I'm always pacing around or walking away

I keep drinking the ink from my pen
And I'm balancing history books up on my head
But it all boils down to one quotable phrase

A good woman will pick you apart

But you may be offended and you may be afraid
But don't walk away, don't walk away

With the noise in the background from a televised war
And in the deafening pleasure I thought I heard someone say
If we walk away, they'll walk away

From the shackles of language and measurable time
And then we can trade places, play musical graves
Till then walk away, walk away, walk away, walk away

I've been sleeping so strange

I feel too restless to unwind
I'm always lost in thought as I walk a block

Where the waitress looks concerned
But she never says a word
Just turns the jukebox on and we hum along
And I smile back at her
And my friend comes after work
When the features start to blur
She says these bars are filled with things that kill
By now you probably should have learned
Did you forget that yellow bird?
How could you forget your yellow bird?

love to talk that Texas slang,
I spend change like it ain't no thing nigga.
Because down south we be tipping on fo's,
in the parking lot pimping these hoes,
its M.O.B. on every hoe nigga.
Down in H-Town we gripping on grain,
flipping on swings sipping that drank,
causing pain in the turning lane nigga.

But I think we have to walk
Keep waving at the taxis
They keep turning the lights on

But julie knows a party at some actor's westide loft
Supplies are endless in the evening
By the morning they'll be gone
And everything is lonely

I can be my own best friend
I get a coffee and the paper
Have no phone conversations
With the sidewalk and the pigeons

And my window reflection
When I start polishing in the evening
By the morning looks like shit

And I know you have a heavy heart
I can feel it when we kiss
So many men stronger than me
Have thrown their backs out trying to live

Yeah but me I'm not a gamble
You can count on me to split
But what I tell you in the evening
By the morning won't make sense

With your eyes all painted black
Just keep going to the bathroom
Only say you'll be right back

Well it takes one to know one kid
I think you've got it bad
But what's so easy in the evening
By the morning it's such a drag

Got a flask inside my pocket
We can share it on the train
And if you promise to stay conscious
I'll try to do the same

Well we might die from that occasion
But we sure killed all the pain
What was normal in the evening
By the morning seems insane

And I'm not sure what the trouble was
What started all of this
The reasons all have run away
But the feeling never did

It's not something I would recommend

So I think about the bad luck, 
The bad blood, 
That may have come between two good souls.
That's one hell of an offering, 

So take these gifts that have been given. 
And ended up with an alphabet but some words are too wrong to define.

Because you lost and its gone but it will return. 
Now it's all laid out in front of you and that's half murdered the mystery. 
Are you still too shy to describe?

She said I kissed her different, that all the men her age were mean
Gave me anything I wanted, oh, the generosity
I took all that I could, it was free
Now the sky is a torn up denim and the clouds are just splattered paint

But when conducting business she would lie about where she?s from
Saying, ""Life is how it is, not how it was""

She?d talk forever about the phases of the moon
Saying, ""Everything is a cycle, you?ve got to let it come to you
And when it does, you will know what to do""
Without even knowing I guess I took her advice
Painted her front door, it seemed a suitable goodbye

Over sidewalk chalk

On an Oxnard beach
Full of fever dreams that scare me sober
Into saltless dinners

Take the fruit from the tree, break the skin with your teeth
Is it bitter or sweet all depends on your timing
Like a meeting of chance
With the train station glance
Many lifetimes have passed in a instant reminded
Of a millstone house in a seaside town
When your heart gave out in a mission bed

In my Styrofoam coffin, asleep on the interstate

On a great silver beltway, democracy's shackled hands

A priceless work of art
Boys would fashion their emotions 
To the pattern of your heart

For a girl you loved but died
I'm here sewing mine together
Just hoping you're alive
And I know you'll never come back now 
To the world where people are
Because you never understood 
What they loved you for

Now ghosts, they have their secrets
And they'll tell them to a few
So you could never pay attention 
When they're whispering to you
There were many talents you possessed 
That I wished myself to have
But the way your eyes would gloss over 
Well, I never envied that
And I doubt you'll ever come back now 
From wherever it is you are
Because you never understood

With the noise in the background from a televised war

And the whole world must watch the sad comic display

From the shackles of language and measurable time
And then we can trade places, play musical graves
Till then walk away, walk away, walk away, walk away

You say, ""Man, look what we found here, Einstein,"" or whoever you're talking to, Tesla - whoever you're talking to. Problems of the future can be solved by mankind because you create them. And you have to believe in the future, it's what we have to do. We progress, we always progress - we try to. So the Sumerian tablets, they say the same thing like Genesis said, that there were chariots of fire that came into the sky. And these beings got out of them, and they walked like a man but they had reptilian features. They had snake-like eyes, a tail, and, uh, scales, right? And they were - they were here, and they made slaves out of the people. And where they landed in is what the Bible calls the Garden of Eden. They were trying to inbreed with the people here. The women would die, the babies would abort. But after two thousand years they started taking, the babies started being born and living. And they had tails, they had a few reptilian features. They could phase shift from one dimension to another dimension, and the people who know say it's from the fourth dimension - the next dimension. Space is expanding; there are spirits coming from the center, right? We're going counterclockwise. There's supposed to be eight other universes going counterclockwise, and that's called Superuniverse, you know? And love's always been the message. It's just - circumstances happen, right? People freak out, just flat flip out, you know? Well, that's where Hitler came from, Hitler came from that way. He was an outspoken, charismatic yeller. And, and all these people said, ""Hey, we'll use this guy, hey, look at all these people listening to this guy."" You know what I mean? And so that's just what the trip's like, that. You know? It still exists, and their bloodline goes back - back into Sumerian times. You know, they didn't call it reptilian, they didn't call it that. But they did, because they called him Satan, they called him the Devil, and it's the same damn trip. It's a negative force, coming in on a positive force, because it's a third dimension, right? And for it to solidify or to crystallize, it has to have both elements, right? And you have to keep it in balance, or it will, it will, one of them will destroy the other...

They're playing on the side

I loved you triple spiral
Father, son, and ghost
But you left me in my darkest hour
When I needed you, when I needed you
Now that the dream is over, I want it to be known
I never saw you coming
From my little human prism
How sad it is to know I'm in control

That's the problem, an empty sky
I fill it up with everything that's missing from my life
Where'd you come from, you faded sign?
Spinning through the centuries
Expanding all the time

Three worlds at once that blend together
Three times I cried for us
But I felt better then 

I loved you triple spiral
My maiden mother crow
You found me in this fallowed state

I heard your strange commotion
And wished I could go home
To live a little longer

Long enough to carve you into stone",Triple Spiral,2011
Bright Eyes,"Does he kiss your eyelids in the morning when you start to raise your head?
And does he sing to you incessantly from the space between your bed and wall?
Does he walk around all day at school with his feet inside your shoes?
Looking down every few steps to pretend he walks with you.
Does he know that place below your neck that is your favorite to be touched
And does he cry through broken sentences like I love you far too much?
Does he lay awake listening to your breath?
Worried that you smoke too many cigarettes.
Is he coughing now on a bathroom floor?
For every speck of tile there are a thousand more
That you won't ever see but most hold inside yourself eternally.

I drug your ghost across the country and we plotted out my death.
In every city, memories would whisper: ""Here is where you rest.""
I was determined in Chicago but I dug my teeth into my knees
And I settled for a telephone and sang into your machine.

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine

I kissed a girl with a broken jaw that her father gave to her.
She had eyes bright enough to burn me. They reminded me of yours.
In a story told she was a little girl in a red-rouge,
Sun-bruised field and there were rows of ripe tomatoes where a secret was concealed.
And it rose like thunder, clapped under our hands.
And it stretched for centuries to a diary entry's end where I wrote,

You make me happy whoa!  When the skies are gray
You make me happy whoa!  The skies are gray and gray and gray.

Well the clock's heart it hangs inside its open chest with its hands
Stretched towards the calendar hanging itself but I will not weep for those dying days.
For all the ones who have left there are a few that stayed.
And they found me here and pulled me from the grass where I was laid.",The Calendar Hung Itself,2013

Je me lav' les pieds sans retard
Et j'enfil' mon pyjama rayé
Pour aller me coucher
Sitôt que je suis dans mes draps
C'est la fin de tous les tracas
Dès que je mets la tête sur l'oreiller
Je commenc' à rêver

Il m'arriv' des trucs terribles le soir dans mon lit
J'tir' des lions comm' à la cible et je bouff' des grizzlis
Dans les journaux d'la ville
J'ai ma photographie en grand format et
Les femmes s'offrent à moi

Sans r'ssentir un frisson
Je donn' des interviews
Et l'on m'trouv' un talent fou des sall's entièr's m'acclam'nt debout
Je suis le premier pilote à prendre la fusée
Qui va porter sur la lun' la recett' du boeuf braisé
Je suis un vrai surhomme
Je sais voler de succès en succès

L'autre jour j'accours au bureau
Et je raconte tout de go
Les exploits de mon esprit mutin
Devant tous les copains
Y avait Gaby la secrétaire
Qu'écoutait sans en avoir l'air
Et qui murmur' oui tout ça c'est merveilleux
Mais j'vous propos' bien mieux

Il m'arrive un truc terrible ce soir dans mon lit
J'ai le trac c'est infernal je m' sens petit petit
Pas question que je dorme
Gaby est là étendue près de moi et
J'suis pas plus fier que ça
Quand ça m'arrivait en rêve je savais comment faire
Je tombais sans coup férir des fill's aux seins de fer
Mais Gaby me regarde
Et ça me fait des trucs dans l'estomac
Elle s'approche un peu
Elle a de grands yeux bleus
Et de longs cheveux blonds
Qui s'entortillent dans les boutons d'mon pyjama en toil' d'avion
Mais voilà qu'elle m'embrasse et je sens tout tourner
Plus de lion, finie la chass' je suis ratatiné
Adieu mes rêves sages
Plus d'aventur' et pourtant je sens bien

Que celle-là recommencera
Demain soir et après demain… Jusqu'à la fin des fins !",Dans Mon Lit,1966

Avec le collier d’or qu’Emile
M’a acheté pour mon birthday
Je chatouille les fleurs du parc
En leur disant des mots d’amour
Et sur le cheval de Jeanne d’Arc
Je monte faire un petit tour

Demie clocharde
J’erre et musarde
Mi suie mi neige
Dans les manèges
De la city
Qui me sourie

Les cerisiers de Notre-Dame
Préparent leur dôme éclatant
Pour que je joue la joie dans l’âme
Communiante voilée de blanc
La Chevrolet de la voisine
Est bie, agréable le soir
Quand les lumières s’agglutinent
Petits moutons à l’abreuvoir
Je glisse dans les rues fardées
Mon clair flacon entre les doigts
A l’auto-radio qui rougeoit

Demie clocharde
J’erre et musarde
Mi suie mi neige
Dans les manèges
De la city
Qui me sourie

J’atterris plazza athénée
De temps en temps la nuit très tard
Pour plonger ma peau de bébé
Dans un bassin de marbre noir
Je m’envole dans la journée
En laissant la note à Emile
Dans la limousine volée
Elle est à moi, à moi la ville",Demie Clocharde,2002

Around the light house

When they go overboard.

Blanc ou noir, ou rouge, ou jaune et puis c'est tout
Mais une autre race, est en train d'apparaître :
C'est les zazous, c'est les zazous !
Un faux col qui monte jusqu'aux amygdales,
Avec un veston qui descend jusqu'aux g'noux
Les cheveux coupés jusqu'à l'épine dorsale :
Voilà l'zazou, voilà l'zazou !

Refrain :
Y a des zazous dans mon quartier
Moi, j'suis déjà à moitié ;
Un de ces jours à votre tour
Vous serez tous zazous comme eux
Car le zazou, c'est contagieux
Ca commenc' par un tremblement
Qui vous prend soudain brusquement
Et puis on pouss' des hurlements
Ah ! wa da la di dou da di dou la wa wa !

Si vous rencontrez un jour sur votr' passage,
Un particulier coiffé d'un fromag' mou
Tenant dans ses doigts, un poisson dans un' cage :
C'est un zazou ! c'est un zazou !
Si votre épicier vous dit : "" j'ai du gruyère
Mais malheureus'ment il n'reste que les trous ""
Ne supposez pas qu'il fuit de la caf'tière :
Il est zazou, il est zazou !

Refrain :
Y a des zazous dans mon quartier
Moi, je l'suis déjà à moitié :
Un de ces jours ça vous prendra
Ah ! wa da la di dou da di dou la wa wa !

A son futur gendre, avant-hier ma concierge
Disait : "" voyez ma fille est un bijou ""
Elle est encore mieux, que si elle était vierge !
Elle est zazou ! elle est zazou !
En prenant le train, j'ai vu le chef de gare
Qui m'a dit mon cher, j'suis plus cocu du tout
Je suis quelque chose de beaucoup plus rare
Je suis zazou, je suis zazou !

D'vant la guillotine, Gégène a dit :""j'm'en fous ""
Y a déjà longtemps, que j'ai perdu la tête
Je suis zazou ! je suis zazou !
Avec une mondaine de la place Pigalle
Mon ami Léon, a fait les quatr' cents coups
Ca lui a réussi, car pour ses vingts cinq balles 
Il est zazou ! il est zazou !

Refrain :
Y a des zazous dans mon quartier
Moi, je l'suis déjà à moitié
Et à mon tour un de ces jours
On finira par m'emmener

Va prendre tes gouttes
Betty Boop criseuse
La vie au mois d’août
Est bien dangereuse

Tout l’après-midi
Il faut se garer
Du soleil maudit
Du ciel enragé

La putain, la mer
La soupe aux rougets
Bleu pétard d’enfer
Déploie ses attraits

Les gogos huileux
Se vautrent sur elle
Et s’échouent graisseux
Au lit du bordel

Va prendre tes gouttes

La vie au mois d’août
Est bien dangereuse

Betty enfermée 
Dans son pauvre abri 
Les volets tirés
Reste dans son lit

Sombre elle machône
Son chewing-gum éteint
Puis elle se donne
Un plaisir divin

Ensuite elle fume
25 cigarettes
Matant ses costumes
Ses rouges jupettes

Va prendre tes gouttes

La vie au mois d’août
Est bien dangereuse

Lorsque la nuit tombe

Evacue sa tombe

Brigitte Fontaine,"J’aime  à me promener
Dans l’unique splendeur
A venir et passée
Du château intérieur

Dans le radieux patio
Plein d’oiseaux et de fleurs
Entre les marbres chauds
Bat et saigne le cœur

Le salon resplendit
De lustres et de cristal
De musique et de cris
Sur la houle du bal

Dans la salle d’eau fraîche
Peuplée de paravents

Vers le dôme étoilé
Et les tapis s’immolent
Au satin des souliers

Aux transparents alcools
Voisinent rocking chairs
Et ottomanes molles

Dans la bibliothèque
Luisent tous les trésors
Des anthropopithèques
Des lointains astres morts

Dans l’unique splendeur
A venir et passée
Du château intérieur

Sur les ventres polis
Sur le feu des colliers

Baignent la soie des draps

Collent fées et priappes
Dans la fureur méchante
De leurs danses en grappes

Dans l’unique splendeur
A venir et passée
Du château intérieur

Dans la chambre d’amour
Au lit rouge à colonnes
Aux murs bleus singapour

La lumière ruisselle
Comme un foyer de rires
Et les encensoirs mêlent
Le santal et la myrrhe

Dans le creuset de mort
La conception fidèle
Unit le fer et l’or
Pour la vie éternelle

J’aime à me promener
Dans l’unique splendeur
A venir et passée
Du château intérieur

Dans la chambre aux tortures
Le chrome et le nickel
Attendent leur pâture
D’anges et de mortels

Entre chair et éther
Le supplice s’ordonne
Rouge été noir hiver
Enfer et ciel fusionnent

L’être peut-être vole
Au-delà des supplices

Du jardin des délices

Du meilleur et du pire

Paroles Brigitte Fontaine
Musique Maya Barsony / Matthieu Chédid

Une sorte de greluche
Teint plâtre et robe sang
Entrouvre la peluche
D’un rideau de beuglant
L’auditoire s’explose
C’est enfin le moment
Où la divine chose
Va cracher son talent

Refrain :
Vas-y vas-y, chante, beuglante, vas-y chante

En effet elle entame
En entrant dans l’arène
Un affolant ramdam
En pur polystyrène
Sa voix rauque ou suave
Revue et corrigée
Se contorsionne et bave
Sur le client pâmé

Refrain

Elle vomit des mots tocs
Sur des airs comme il faut
Tango Funky et rock
En palpant ses lolos
L’atmosphère très hot
Monte de vingt degrés
Quand elle saisit les notes 
Perchées comme un trophée

Refrain

Bravo pour les magouilles
Bravo pour les pétasses
Qui vont traîner leurs couilles
En or dans les palaces",La Beuglante,2008

Il a pris le bon côté des choses
Les dernières années, il les a passées
à sculpter de la vigne
sur les buffets et les chaises
à se balader avec les gosses
faire des bons petits plats
 aller voir le lever de la lune au-dessus des genets
Jamais une réflexion désagréable
jamais un regard malveillant

Tu arrivais chez lui à n’importe quelle heure
il ouvrait une bouteille de bon vin
une boite de fois gras, et allez donc
Qu’est-ce qu’on riait avec lui

Si quelqu’un était agressif
il le regardait bien
et je ne sais pas comment il s’y prenait

il le calmait
Il n’aimait vraiment pas la bagarre
mais vraiment pas
Il disait qu’il n’était pas là pour ca

En le voyant quelquefois on se demandait
et sa femme qu’est-ce qu’elle est devenue
ca c’était le mystère
Peut-etre ca avait chauffé autrefois
Il n’en parlait jamais
On ne savait pas du tout ce qui s’était passé

Seulement une fois
j’ai entendu son fils qui lui disait
Tu ne trouves pas qu’elle t’a assez fait souffrir ? 
Il a répondu 
Et moi mon petit gars, qu’est-ce que tu crois ?
Qu’est-ce que tu crois ?

All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain

With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning

For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more

Got my money like a train its always on track
I love my money more than fame so explain the all black,
All black Maybach in the back I'm gettin' blown
People wanna build a case I'm like, ""fuck it just bring it on!""
Then maybe it make me stronger
I hustle my money longer
Still hustlin' out the honda 
Just tryin' to take out my momma
Gotta problem nigga holla

And boy, we don't care who you calling
Nothing can save you now

So unno betta mind where you walking

See you dun push the wrong button
And cross the wrong line
Stepped on the wrong shoe

They get me out the tandem
Me are da true, I traded mine in
For caveman king

You don't wanna fuck with
The Southside Gotcha boys
Y'all ain't know trill ass niggas
Y'all some boxy boys

And pull shots on boys
Scattered like a roach
And put that on the fifth
I'm the nigga you don't wanna approach

I was raised in the heart of the jungle
The belly of the beast
And this lick here sweet, I'm so flawed
You can put me on the front line
Ass back nicks, I don't represent the gun shy
Thing about the street life

Homie, I live, wear my heart on my sleeve
And niggas gotta fear life
From the bottom to the top, east to the west

Who try to stunt

Call me Danny Glover

Shoot you people while you sleeping
The grim reaper is out to lunch
Nothing can save you now

Put holes in you mouth so you can't be found
And Khaled got my back
He gon' shoot a hundred rounds
So say hello to death
If you ever in my town

I came from the eggs of a goddess
And the balls of a gigolo
All I had was 2 ounces
An old Chevy and Figaro
Blood shed apart my feet

And bad vibes got a nigga rocking voodoo deep
Lord forgive me, I know not a better way
And pop has tried to stick me
Damn I need some better ye

Ring the alarm, tell 'em people come, come
Look at what the fuck the Briscgun, yeah

Khaled, these niggas talking
I'm an orphin
And leave a hole in his head
Like a dolphin
Fuck a hole in one, ain't golfin'
I'ma put his whole unit in a coffin

'Cause any nigga fuck wit my pocket
I'ma open his ass off, like suicide doors
Any badass niggas, y'all scared of that lake
I'ma tell you once don't be scared of the Dre

But guess this is your final warning
And boy, we don't care who your calling
Nothing can save you now

I'm usually cool, but know I gotta bet back
I tried telling ya, ain't wit'cha death threats
I let my nigga know, tell 'em go hammer that
And it ain't gon' take all day
We know where you live at

I'll bet ya hide from ya neighbors
Keep 'em mad shawty
That's how we kill 'em babies
Holla Khaled, and tell him I'm on the way now
I just had to hit a lick in the A-Town

Look at me it's shawty
So bossy, and I don't feel like that
Can't stop me now, now, now
You see what's happening?
Big shit dun popped off

Yeh why'all can hear me
Make the drumming sound yeh
Lets ride yeh yeh
Be clear we here lights out
Eat here sleep here my house
Rhyme wasting time wasting
Feds want me caged in
Hope they got patience
More you win they want you to lose

Hope we might chill the heights real
Still we got fire that will melt your ice grill
Know the deal once we hit record
Hit the floor
New era this is war
Lord I'm the answer without a question
No evidence no possession
Stop stressing

Till I see the end to me and BIG meet again yeh

On my right where my gun going be
Bitches ain't getting a crumb from me
Member when niggas used to run from me
All of a sudden niggas names is buzzing
Nigga in the game got a little chain becuz
Heard the nigga signed a major budget
But I'm the nigga made you love
Now you want to change the subject
I ain't sweating that animosity

Instead of rap imma smack you dead in your trap

Ship them things in route to climb walls
Infrared vision ear plugs and all
Digital surveillance linked with laptops
Express mail it to me can't ???

[Bristal]
I'm splurtin' for certain Bris-pro working
Searchin' dippin' curvin' breakin' clean outta virgin
From servin' here Rob certain I'm burnin'
On my way from Mt. Vernon
Swervin' a stretch bourbon
Identity of this man I look persian
Hey yo we gotta get him

Bad boys watch ya backs
Watch ya backs bad boys

[Black Rob]
Yo, who the fuck is this pagin' me at eight forty six

Sense of urgency on the cell

We in a tight jam
Me and Diddy fam sorta like his right hand
I touch down like two-thirty
If i was on you, your hoe's and them cowards I'm'll do dirty
Still a commssion and we all equal
All lethal
Caught'em doin' dirt to the wrong people
It's the family affair, I'm here
With all of me I'm'll deal with this one accordingly
Got the locations sittin' in the console pacin'
Get bagged murder be the case and
And I'm tired in jail
Even though through the riots I prevailed
Enjoyin' my freedom, got two kids as long as I feed'em
I'm here for the fam that's there when I need'em

[Mark Curry]
Yo, uh uh uh, hello
It gotta be the same cats
I can tell by they strange acts
When they mumble to each other
Like Milan they run for cover
New 'cause this bitch that I fucked with
One thought I loved her
Seas debate the storm pull him the the surface
That's a purpose
One of these faces, make'em nervous
Catch'em when they out for hamburgers
Turn they whole lunch into a murder
In a way all the rounds gon' be heard of
This shits big, the first thing to catch to where PD is
I'm on it, act like they want it
I'm'll bring the heat
Just let me know the place we plan to meet
And I'm in it sure as your heart beat

[Loon]
Yo I ain't really tryin' to duck no strays
So watch what the fuck you say
It's ya mouth that started the shit
Now you actin' all retarted and shit
Dog I came to play my part and that's it
We had a fullproof plan, all we need was the fam
Ammunition, a van, two chicks and one extra man
Two lincoln LS Sedans
Fifteen hundred yards of saran
And after the scam, we be out in Amsterdam
Yo, call Sean in Milan
Call Sean tell Sean we gone
We'll meet him in Hong Kong
With two chicks both they thongs on
Mabe Ling and Kim Long
Both of them dead wrong
Two rich bitches the feds on

[P. Diddy]
Yeah, well it seems like brother Loon is out in Hong Kong
He's found his self in a sticky icky icky situation
But you know somethin' I have faith in the bad boys
Bad boys bring it on home, bring it on home bad boys

[Kain]
Heh, I'm bout to do Santa Dimengo
On a horse named Bingo
A fugitive lookin' for Puff switchin' my lingo
Stayin' at a hotel called the pink flamingo
Callin' up MC from a cuatro cinco
The set up, tryin' on my way to uniform
Room service bumpin' Kain on the newest song
Holdin' gats knowin' everything I do is wrong
'Till I hi-jack the sky flyin' on a unicorn
Downstairs with a bag of money and two clips
Talkin' to Loons chicks wit' sombreros and toothpicks
Sayin' they commit homicides for two bits
And fuck for dough like I give two shits
Wildfire call from Hong Kong
Hello (Loon: Yo Kain I just spotted Sean Jean)
Hold up, some information was missing
I just got the same page from Bris
He told me he saw Sean and two chicks followed by four whips
Somewhere in the Florida sticks
It's a set up
Tell the crew to keep their heads high
I'm gonna flip if any one of my mens die
We've been fucked somebody told us a bent-lie/Bentley (what?)
Let's get back to the spot in NY
Seven glocks P-S-P-O pops
Hit both the hot locks
Let'em read it that Diddy is on them hot blocks
So we sent two teams to rush both spots
Ha yeah!
Suited up ready to dumbs out
Thumbs out watch the motherfuckin' door with our guns out

The best that ever lived it
Cocksuckers, what's his name, huh?
That's how we do it y'all, yea
To all my niggas in the house
Bad Boy, who we die for
All day, everyday nigga

For the love of BIG, we bang out
Since my man died, we don't hang out
We blow brains out, we tear the club up, pull them things out
Mafia World, all my niggas max out
We Bad Boys, why y'all niggas cracked out
Coward niggas, most are burried down south
Far from gangstas, really hush puppies
niggas bearly speak when we discuss money
niggas stay yappin' when there's always somethin' funny
The realest niggas never took nuthin' from me
Rock ice, stay jig, fuck with niggas that got drunk, and hate kids
Got niggas on state bids, that hate movies like Rosewood and Matrix
Ayo, Biggie taught me well, Biggie told me how to flip bricks like cartwheel

To all my thugs who puffed him
To all my girls who hugged him
You love him, yell his name

Representin' Bucktown
MAC 11's cocked back, niggas better duck down
Face down, you know the routine, the cream
Earings, you know the drama Biggie bring

For BIG I learn to grip aim and cock it
Once I got it, I lock it
Banger, big city boy with deep pockets
See me speak, that paper better be the topic
I like my ice frozen like the Antarctic
I'm quick to finish it, your good to start it
And with the flashy colors on, you just a target, waitin' for a hard hit
I like marine blue, marine green, roll with a mean team
Meshed out, fresh out, and stay greams
We big boys, we do big things, born in this county of kings
I ain't got shit, I spray things, take things
Fuck whenever my mood swings, from the summer for the winter to the spring
My nigga Ill's holdin' it down from the Bean 
Like BIG said, we do the real things, we still bubble and steal chains
Still tustle, still struggle, we feel pain
Still ride, still die for BIG's name

For BIG I grip the Sig, put six in your wig
Not 'cause of what he said, 'cause of what he did
When I hear that pop quiz, that's the way I was raised and that's the way it is for
We roll like the Panthers, show our guns on camera
Do jukes with police scanners, niggas mediocre, full of dirt like hampers
I roll with a bunch of niggas that wear bandanas and rep
We kept it thorough, from the heart rep the borough
B.K. style, see BIG howl, now
Lets see who, wanna go against Mafia World
Niggas nuthin' but squirrels, they know we rep
Niggas tryin' to get a nut, hit in the head or below the gut
