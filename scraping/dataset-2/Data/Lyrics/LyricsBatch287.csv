Galileo,"I've paid my dues
Time after time.
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime.
And bad mistakes
I've made a few.
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through.

(And I need just go on and on, and on, and on)

We are the champions, my friends,
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end.
We are the champions.
We are the champions.
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions of the world.

I've taken my bows
And my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it
I thank you all

But it's been no bed of roses,
No pleasure cruise.
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race
And I ain't gonna lose.

(And I need just go on and on, and on, and on)

We are the champions, my friends,
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end.
We are the champions.
We are the champions.
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions of the world.

We are the champions, my friends,
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end.
We are the champions.
We are the champions.
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions.",We Are the Champions,2003
Galileo,"Buddy you're a boy make a big noise
Playin' in the street gonna be a big man some day
You got mud on yo' face
You big disgrace
Kickin' your can all over the place
Singin'

We will we will rock you
We will we will rock you

Galileo,"There's no time for us,
There's no place for us,
What is this thing that builds our dreams, yet slips away from us.

Who wants to live forever,
Who wants to live forever?
There's no chance for us,
It's all decided for us,
This world has only one sweet moment set aside for us.

Who wants to live forever,
Who dares to love forever,
When love must die.

But touch my tears with your lips,
Touch my world with your fingertips,
And we can have forever,
And we can love forever,
Forever is our today,
Who wants to live forever,
Who wants to live forever,
Forever is our today,
Who waits forever anyway?",Who Wants to Live Forever,2003
Galimatias,"I only miss you when the sun goes down
Oh, your voice is my favorite sound
Swaying like the palm trees
You and me we're poetry
Painting stories with our lips

You're like a wave washing over me
Pulling me underneath
Sinking slowly
You're like a wave washing over me
I'll stay underneath
Drifting slowly

Hey he-he-hey
Hey he-he-hey
Oh, hey he-he-hey
Hey hey hey

Foreign feelings that I can't ignore
Oh I never felt like this before
What's a king without a queen
You could be my everything
Can't you see?

You're like a wave washing over me
Pulling me underneath
Sinking slowly
You're like a wave washing over me

Galimatias,"You looked at me with certainty
I couldn't look away
Took your jacket off like
Like you were here to stay
Chasin’ your pretty thoughts

Galimatias,"So you say you wanna get away
We don't need a plane
I could be your escape
Take you to a place
Where there's no time, no space
I could be your private island
On a different planet
Anything could happen
Listen to the waves
Let them wash away your pain

I could be your fantasy
I could be your fantasy

Underneath the palm trees
You could leave your worries
Listen to the waves
Say you wanna get so high?
Breathe me in like air tonight
Listen to the waves

Gallagher & Lyle,"I wear my heart on my sleeve,
I'm not afraid to say what i mean,
Mean what i say.
I set myself up, let myself down,
I may be a fool to spread it around.
But i just wanna let you know,
Sometimes i find it so hard not to show,
So i sigh and i let my feelings go.

I wear my heart on my sleeve,
Don't count the cost,
If i can't live in love then surely i've lost.
You tend to get burned, tend to get bruised,
But it's my life whatever i choose.
Oh, i just wanna let you know,
Sometimes i, i find it so hard not to show,
So i sigh and i let my feelings go.

I wear my heart on my sleeve,
I wear my heart on my sleeve.
You tend to get burned, tend to get bruised,
But it's my life whatever i choose.
Oh, i just wanna let you know,
'Cause sometimes i find it so hard not to show,
So i sigh, but, baby, you're not alone.

You wear your heart on your sleeve,
You wear your heart on your sleeve.
I wear my heart on my sleeve,
I wear my heart on my sleeve.

I wear my heart on my sleeve,
I wear my heart on my sleeve,
I wear my heart on my sleeve,
Mm, my heart on my sleeve,

Gallagher & Lyle,"Inside, outside, up and around
Love set me up and love let me down again
Feel like a weatherman
One day sun, next day rain
You ask me if I really care
Don't you know the answer
Rainy day blues never felt this way

I wanna stay with you
For the rest of my life
I wanna live with you
For the rest of my life
I wanna stay with you
For the rest of my life

When I gave my loving to you
It meant little to me
Somehow somewhere you changed my point of view
Good times, bad times, happy or sad
Being in love is better than being out
I might have had my doubts
But nothing to write home about",I Wanna Stay With You,1976
Gallagher & Lyle,"I got to say it and it's hard for me
You got me crying like I thought I would never be
Love is believing but you let me down
How can I love you when you ain't around
And I

Get to the morning and you never call
Love should be everything or not at all
And it don't matter whatever you do
I made a life out of loving you

Only to find any dream that I follow is dying
I'm crying in the rain
I could be searching my world for a love everlasting
Feeling no pain
when will we meet again

Why do you have to be a heartbreaker 
is it a lesson that I never knew? 
Gotta get out of the spell that I'm under
My love for you

Why do you have to be a heartbreaker 
when I was being what you want me to be? 
Suddenly everything I ever wanted has passed me by
This world may end
not you and I

My love is stronger than the universe
My soul is crying for you 
and that cannot be reversed
You made the rules and you could not see 
you made a life out of hurting me

Out of my mind
I am held by the power of you love
Tell me when do we try
Or should we say goodbye? 

Why do you have to be a heartbreaker 
when I was being what you want me to be? 
Suddenly everything I ever wanted has passed me by

Oh

Suddenly everything I ever wanted
My love for you, ooh

El chamaquito conoció el lado oscuro de la isla
Viendo como los panas se mataban en el cacerio por kilo o por libra
A veces solo por poder o por guía
Y una noche sintió una música en el huesos
Y en su sistema sanguíneo
Y el chamaquito entonces tubo esta misión
Vivir de la música brother no es imposible
Cuando de la música es que deseas vivir

Any solo dream ya vivo en el siglo 25

El chamaquito jamas permitió que eso se convirtiera en una dificultad papi

Y con la música como norte
El chamaquito comprendió si misión en la vida
Que la vida a veces esta llena de depresiones tropicales
Y que never stop five and the level
Y dios no the raith papi

Cuando empece en esta cuestión fue sin mirar atrás
Sin saber que el camino es duro pero hay que luchar
Con un entendimiento y mientras canto pasa el tiempo
Veo como mi carrera gira, oh que bien me siento
Ahora se, que lo que cultive ha rendido frutos
En absoluto no fue en vano como lo disfruto
Y solo es el comienzo (Colega me escuchas)

Muchas puertas que toque, mil estudios visite
Sentía que me quitaba, pero nunca me quite
Y aquí estamos, dos seres humanos que se juntan
Dejando de que hablar, hay muchas preguntas

A gaping hole running right through their neck

Snakes get fat while the good rats die
All the pigs should be bled dry
Who's with me?

All your sins will be forgiven
When your blood begins to thicken
You have no answers to our questions
God bless this great depression

The snakes get fat while the good rats die
And all the pigs should be bled dry
Who's with me?

Throw the bodies into the streets
Nothing more than rotten meat
Taught not to bite the hand that feeds
'Til it's cold and dry and no longer bleeds

The snakes get fat while the good rats die
So all the pigs should be bled dry

The London metropolitan
All the fucking clergy men
Child abusers, national front
Rapists, racists, all fucking scum

And they march hand in hand
To rape our green and pleasant land
Dust to dust, earth to earth
The new born babies drowned at birth

And there's no future for England's son
They're nine years old and they all carry guns
Take out your crowbars, take out your knives
Drain out your blood, we all deserve to die

It's time for us to take a stand
We are dying on our knees in this great fucking land
And all the martyrs they have convinced themselves
That death ain't a sin when you're living in hell

There ain't no glory and there ain't no hope
We will hang ourselves just show us the rope
There ain't no scapegoats left to blame
We brought this on ourselves, we could have been the change

Great Britain is fucking dead
So cut our throats, end our lives
Let's fucking start again

Galt MacDermot,"I met a boy called Frank Mills
On September twelfth right here
In front of the Waverly
But unfortunately I lost his address
He was last seen with his friend, a drummer
He resembles George Harrison of The Beatles
But he wears his hair tied in a small bow at the back
I love him but it embarrasses me
To walk down the street with him
He lives in Brooklyn somewhere
And he wears his white crash helmet
He has golden chains on his leather jacket
And on the back are written the names
""Mary"" and ""Mom"" and ""Hell's Angels""
I would gratefully appreciate if you see him tell him
I'm in the park with my girlfriend and please
Tell him Angela and I don't want the two dollars back just him",Frank Mills,1994

Wearing smells from laboratories
Facing a dying nation of moving paper fantasy
Listening for the new told lies
With supreme visions of lonely tunes

Who knows what stands in front of our lives

Silence tells me secretly ev'rything, ev'rything
Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star

Shoot dope lines first and ask questions later

Close the case tighter than the jaws of a 'gator
Stenonographer, that study law again, the jargon
Let your counselors 'a barking, in hopes of a plea bargain
But when you read back verbatim
What they're saying to persuade them
They realize exactly how I've played them
I come with the truth, whole truth and nothing but
'Cause the truth hurts just as much as in' with lies will
I brew skill with free fills from now until
Plagiarizing MC's get their flows distilled

Baby I don't die without you by my side
As long as you return into these arms that burn
Baby I won't die just take a look inside
Into these eyes that burn, come to these arms that yearn

I won't die, if you leave me high
I won't die if you're not by my side

Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face

Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

To rest by burdens, far from this tyranny

From the shores of Africa
Up to the doors of America
With voices to heaven praying for liberty
We cry freedom (freedom, freedom, freedom)

Stood for equality
We kept our chin up
We kept our dignity
And our proclamation
Let everbody sing

[Chorus]

Up on Golgotha, hanging upon a tree
They say the God-man, died for my liberty
He heard me crying, from my captivity
And so he came down, down to deliver me
Woah woah woah woah

My heart cries freedom
Your heart cries freedom

Intro: see murder (talking) with Porsha singing. 
This is a story about my childhood years. 
For all my niggas. 
For my life as a ghetto child. 
. There's so much pain 

Verse 1: ???? 
I remember as a little kid. 
Growing up. Many of my friends didn't make it up to bricks. 
Punished for the shit that they did  it gets so hard to live. 
Mama cut the same tears  livin' in fears. 
Wondering if their son died or survived. 
But mama, I'm cutting the 45. 
I die, tell mama don't cry. 
Dry eyes, ‘cause how I live. I know to smile. 
A young misbehaved child, running in the streets wild. 
Try to make my money, pop. 
My eyes are getting slim. 
And my life is getting down, and I feeling like death is near. 
And I'm hoping that the heaven's here. 
I cry, ‘cause the Lord knows how m! any years I've tried. 
But this life's a lie. It ain't not a hope unless a nigga die. 
Lord why!!, Lord why!! 

Verse 2: ???? 
My childhood years was kinda rough because my pops weren't there. 
I was left to peer. Always pay but no one to share. 
These hard times, stressin' to sell nickels and dimes. 
Had to support my family, no one else was puttin' time. 
Reminiscing about on dead peers troughout the the years. 
No more tears, my childhood years with scrilla fifth. 
Who's the maycliff for all this fucking fight to stop a nigga. 
Just a price I have to pay, nigga. 
My childhood years 

Chorus repeated once: see-Murder (Porsha singing in the background) 
My childhood years, got my shit in tears. 
It's hella scary. 
I'm trapped, and I don't want to die in a cemetery. 
This ghetto ties got me livin' in pain. 
Lord knows I don't want to die in vain. 

Verse 3: see-Murder 
My childhood years was spend in cemeteries bearing my peers. 
Many tears, that I have shaded, for my niggas disappeared. 
In a bad year. Now with depressed in just memory. 
Drinking Hennessy. To dry away my misery. 
Trapped since birth, a ghetto child living in curse. 
It's getting worse, until I'm covered up in dirt. 
The pain it hurts. 
That be the reason why my blast first. 
‘Cause I refuse to be a victim in the black hears. 
Memories up with child runnin' wild. 
I couldn't smile, because my motherfuckin' life was foul. 
A troubled child, stressin' from his childhood years. 
Heavenly father. Could you please wipe away my tears. 

Verse 4: Reginelli 
I could remember way back, when a! nigga was sick. 
I just to watch my brother do some dangerous shit. 
Staying out all night, mama worrying sick. 
Wondering if he was dead or just play with a bitch. 
But when I saw this wild nigga came up like I did. 
When I eat dwellars, when the niggas start to slanging that shit. 
I tight up on my hustle. Start to paying the bills. 
Shading tills, ‘cause my brother got locked up for three years. 
After that a nigga start to grabbin' the mic. 
Write rap, on sheet of paper, making solider shit tight. 
Three years later, my brother came home from jail. 
Tellin' me he wrote rap, when he was strapped in a cell. 
A week later, we was some No limit soliders. 
Gambino family, for all the readers and rollers. 
But you can tell a nigga been shading some tears. 
By the way I live. 
My childhood years. 

Chorus repeated once. 

Outro: see-murder (talking) with Porsha singing 

Childhood years. 
Shading tears. 
For ! all my dead peers.

Here's another dedication
To all you crooked ass badges out there
I want you to ask yourself
""Do you really want to fuck wit' me?""

[chorus] 2X 
It's a sweep to all my niggas pack your heats on tha streets
Hard times got these cops wit' beef, remember me

[Gotti]
It's a sweep muthafucka, pack your heats on tha streets
I never gave a fuck about tha crooked ass police
You fake badge wearin' cowards want to fuck wit' me
Instead of yellin' out peace and niggas still ain't free
Who's to blame for my fuckin' broken family
Uncle Sam never did a damn thing for me
But turn my father to a muthafuckin' dope fiend
And it's plain and see
The government they got plans for me
It's a penitentary
Preachers, they usually see another felony
I rather die wit' my glock n my hand
Then let them bastard ass judges lock me up again
I know I'm livin' a sin
But it's all that was given
N this world of breed
I take a hit of the weed
So all my niggas won't you breed wit' me
Keep your eyes open nigga, don't fall asleep
It's a clean sweep 'cause these cops got beef

chorus 2X

[Melichoir]
It's a clean sweep muthafuckas
Don't get caught n this game
These fuckin' laws premeditatin' wit' them pistols on name
I been cursed wit' what it was worth so I'm cockin' back my uzi
Fuck it, I rather bust before I let these bitches do me
A clean sweep 
Fuck you gettin' these blacks up out tha streets
Talkin' 'bout stop the violence when y'all steady pushin' heat
Our government is goin' sour
Everybody want the power
So watch your back my niggas, they down' to y'all every hour

[Reginelli]
Let it be know, Tuesdays and Thursdays a clean sweep
You gotta be careful not to get caught n tha city streets
The FEDz
The N.O.P.D's
want to lock every hustla up and throw away the keys
It's hard to stop hustlin' when you know you doin' bad
You want to hop n that fast lane, and spend you some cash
A few of my homies put n tha cell for life
And finally a second chance, so they can think twice
A nigga can't even watch or shoot dice for fun
Here come the police now, a nigga gotta run
Sometimes I fear I'm trapped n a white world
It's hard for a black person to make up a bundle sell
The government taxin', the police is hatin'
Everywhere that a nigga go, I feel it was satan
Maybe it's time for me to get off tha city streets
Before the law fuckin' go off, A CLEAN SWEEP

chours 4X

[Pheno]
It's a clean sweep 
For niggas like me that's totin' heat
I play the game for keeps
Til' I'm buried 6 feet
Crooked police
They usin' up my name n vein
Hate to see a nigga ballin' worldwide n this rap game
Who to blame
For them niggas disappear doin' 20 years
Wit' the president, open your eyes and ears
To this shit that's goin' on n my community
There's never unity
Until my niggas is free
The penitentary for the muthafuckas like me
That was swept off his feet n this white man's society
Pushin' dope's the only way to survive
Government put that shit here so we can live or die 
Killed to cry
I wonder why niggas stay high
Runnin' the streets, these muthafuckas fuckin' wit' me
Why must it be
You never want to put me n the clean sweep
They want to put me n the clean sweep

The police is crooked everywhere that a nigga go,
The law trynna book me
I grew up in the ghetto I'm sheddin' tears
And livin' in fear
Late at night, trynna sleep, shots rang out my ears
I'm present in this game, I feel the end is close
The other day I could've sworn I see a fuckin' ghost
It's hard to survive in the fuckin' N.O.
You never know when it's yo time to go

They got me livin' in a world that's full of despise
I can't cope wit' the authorities wit' this red in my eyes
So I proceed across the battlefield bustin' for glory
These demons preachin' for my soul, but I be damned if I'm buried
I got shit to live for I got dreams to forfill
If I die today or tomorrow, who gon' pick up the steel
Don't let mind deceive ya, you either kill or get killed
You muthafuckas ain't feelin' me, so it's best you get real
These fuckin' laws got a nigga stressin' but I'm a thug
Ain't no love on these streets for blacks wit' drawin' blood
Crooked cops tryin' to throw all us blacks n the rump
But lord protect us til' we make it home
It's so much drama nigga

So much drama, so much pain
So much drama, so much pain
All the casualties got us caught up in the game
All the casualties, got us caught up in the game
So much drama, so much pain
All the casualties got us caught up in the game

It's my time
I can feel your pain
Nigga now allow me to spit some game
Watch these stanky bitches beware a nigga that's lame
You can die in the hands of a coward, so keep your eyes open
I done seen a lot of hard niggas die wit' their chest smokin'
But have no worry Gambino family 'cause I'm on your side
If any of them break your tradition, then I'll be down to ride
Let no man question my dedication
To whoeva it is, I'll whoop his ass in front the whole nation
No interference from you outsidas I'm a rida
You runnin' and runnin' while all the time I'm right behind ya
Trust me like you trust your momma
Popps ain't raise no punks, I'm know for bringin' drama

So much drama, so much pain
So much drama, so much pain

You see my momma always told me keep my eyes on your friends
And my enemies close ahead, but these demonds got a nigga possessed
I feel these punk bitches playin' in my death, 
But all this greed and envy, got me green hard on thses streets,
But i'd rather regret it fucking sweeping and sweep
Its like the game got us young niggas playing for keeps
I used to ball wit my niggas, 
Neva figure what made'em change
They sold they souls to the do'
But only the Lord can help'em
I keep my eyes on my friends for so much envy because the enemies, 
You neva know

You neva know who the enemy be, niggas murdered my uncle
In cold blood on these city streets
It got my momma crying in her sleep, worrering me, i'm cursed to see
So much mother fucking mizzery, surroundin' me
I feel like i'm standing in a pile of shells
I know my enemies want me to burn in hell
that's why i keep my fucking eyes open, real wide, don't want to die
Player haters coming, in disguise
I know my enemies, trying to put me to rest
Its like i here my enemies discussin' my death
My momma always told me that i ain't got no friends
The one you think he's your friends that's the one'll do you in

Hold on man, I think Snoop got somethin' to say

Think fast when you dunk, 'cause I won't front
And when it's time to dunk I won't be no punk

They can't stand to see a young nigga get rich
I was thrust some bad cards 
Became a thug with no love cause life's hard

Lord control me 
You know me 
These cards I got to play em 
My life is like a game 
I'm up from a.m. to a.m.
My donner AK hem him 
If he don't have none of my paper man 
If I let him live 
He might take me for a faker
He might try to do a jack and that might cost me my life 
If you ever jack its real nigga 
You best kill me or pay the price
Ain't nuttin' I ain't fallen behind
No street machine tell me what you seen
Then tell a nigga about some stoned ass 
Left the murder scene disguised in army green with a infra beam
Own self tryin tuh gum nigga run as soon as he heard the blast fool one
He didn't run tore his ass up with a quick fast sight
Witness that murda the first degree my ghetto ties fuckin' round wit me
Don't do that

How many times have you seen a family nut up and the mom was cut up
I see now but later on I'm gonna be seein' now 
But see how us niggas get caught up 
Quick to go underwater niggas take advantage of the way
Life sold us
I'm full of that freeze I'm fulla them weeds and them v's 
2 23s 90 degrees
I left them windows down to feel the breeze
My cousin be	 and me and john in the back seat drinkin' off brome 
And to the z
Thinkin' bout the lives we gonna free 
Now tell a nigga please 
Soon as we drove up fuckin' doe was about to close up 
Knocked on the doe 
Nigga hold up you didn't see us rool up
I forced my way in I put my seven to his stars 
No time for thankin'
Is what I'm thankin' kill a bitch what you fittin' tuh say
I went to the kitchen I'm flippin' pans and pots and spoons 
I heard foe glocks
Sounded like foe shots commin' from the other room
Its bout that time for us hounds to get 
Gonna get the dilly for a milly
Went to the next room john jones was in the zone
Its over 
I come to lay ya eyes buggin' out his head

Is that niggas ain't reaching back to a nigga, you feel me?

I'd like to send a shout out to all the niggas who kept it real with they homies

Gambino Family,"[Chorus] 
Oh 
It's life or death in my town 
And I'm standin' on deadly ground 
I just want to live my life 
All by myself
 
Life is full of debt 
And life is full of cnflict 
I'm just tired of seein' all my homies out here dyin' quick 
Society today is all twisted 
Gave my homie 20 years for shop lifttin' 
Now that's bad because LaWan got 3 for murder 
Politics in the court house ain't the same since the murder. 
That's why constantly I watch all my enemies 
'Cause death is a disease to all my TRU g'z 
The can't shake it 
They can't seem to break the cycle 
That's why I'm protected by the gat and St. Micheal 
Ralph Sten said money runs the country 
Make ya do some strange things when it's right in front ya 
I done see mothers turn on they own kids 
Money make brothers turn on one another. 
Even make each other split the other's wig 
Animosity 
Least of all tops is ta watch ya back 
Life or Death 
'Cause ya never know if ya breathed ya last breath. 

[Chorus: x2] 
 
I'm already dead 
So can't nobody kill me 
I done suffered to long to let another man fear me 
My pain brings anger to a total stranger 
Ain't no limit to my hall when I'm constantly in danger 
I just want to be surrounded by somebody that luv me 
But reallity is sendin' me those hatas undercover 
I don't know who to trust but my family and friends 
Takin' chances on your life when you let a stranger in 
Nowadays rappers dying 
So I take it as a message 
I lived to see another year so I count my blessings 
Tell Em' I'ma changed man, but they don't hear me 
On my knees beggin' god can you please forgive me 
Let the past be the past 
I'm investin' in the future 
Watch the ones that swallow most ya 
And the ones that'll do ya 
My advice to the world 
Maintain your sanity 
I know your faced with life or death everyday but overlook the evil 
Thoughts 
'Cause there's gotta be another way 
Life or Death? 
See me? 
I trust nobody 
Money is the rule to all evil 
Better watch yourself boo

Strapped with semi autos and po-po's
And nickle plated slug nose and we left the Calli cause
We made niggas, raised in ghetto's and slums
Totin chips and A-K's, money round drugs (ha)
Shoot first, and leave them standing in their shoes

Infiltrating my click, fool it ain't gonna happen

And now I got a Navi with a mothafucking grill
One time chase a nigga through the fucking alley
Mad cause I fucked up my only pair of Bally's
I used to smoke weed with the ballers after school
Mothafuckas wanted to hang cause I used to act a fool
Started slanging rocks because the shit was fun
I used to bang at niggaz just to see them run
People started hearing shit started recognizing me
Big timers fronted me some coke and a ride g
Dope became a business, no longer a hobby
I owed a nigga 5 g's so I started robbing
I knew I had to move before I had to bang him up

Put my face up in the paper, put my name in they books
Cause they see a nigga balling off the birds that I cooked
As the years went by still survival of the fittest
Now I'm riding in the tank representing to the fullest
Putting bullets in you bitches jealous niggaz in disguise

I was born a bastard, my pops was a thug
Four years in the pen for transporting drugs
I was Known in the hood as a nigga with the weight
Bithces all up in my business, shipping keys from state to state
Triple beams in the project, Calliope where I broke 'em down
Razor blades and baking soda, pure white fuck the brown
My clientele was growing started investing in some other shit
Barber shops on every block, even had a weed spot
Moms and the kids put away up in the house
A fellas Cameras in the lawn to spook a nigga out
Pitbulls in the backyard trained to kill
Call my folks up on the phone before I made a deal
I'm one step ahead of a nigga doing wrong
That's why I'm still alive and been on top so fucking long
I had to spank some busters, to show 'em I mean business
The ghetto is so wicked its survival of the fittest

Run up on my lo-lo, you stop breathin'
Hollow tips make niggas disappear like Houdini
Gang bangin' is real, homey I'm living proof
Like Snoop Dogg, C-walkin' on top of the devil's roof
Rap critics wanna converse, about this and that
Cause red strings in his Converse, and this a Dre track
Keep jibbin' and jabbin', I pull the .38 Magnum
And get to clickin' and clackin', your homies wanna know what happened
Come to Compton see Thriller like Mike Jackson
I might be, Spike Lee, of this gun clappin'
Prior to rappin', I was drug traffickin'
In the dope spot playin' John Madden
Homey I ain't braggin', I took five
You wanna die, run up on that black 745

Got me fuckin' with G-Unit, you know the drama that bring
I got niggas in Westside Compton and Southside Queens
And Buck told me in Cashville, I'm good when I come through
So I ain't gotta tuck in my chain like DJ Pooh
I'm gangsta - more like Deebo when he was Zeus
Play Bishop, I paint that picture, now who got the Juice?
You niggas is Nutso, I take off your roof
Leave yo' ass stretched out like a Cadillac coupe
God gotta let me in heaven, all the shit I've been through
I was a O.G. in the hood before I turned twenty-two
Homey I let the 38 special ripped through that vest
And I don't contemplate whether or not he left his shit on the dresser
Got Compton on my back, I'm startin' to feel the pressure

Come on and wake up baby 
I know you're sleepin' 
But Daddy's home now 
Pictures getting old 
My little girl lookin' grown now 

Your mom said you're talkin' on your own now 
Walkin' on your own now. 
Runnin' across the kitchen floor 
Hidin' them baby dolls I sent you from on tour 
And I missed you when I was tourin' 
Smiling at them baby pictures 
So happy, tears pourin' 
God, how could something so beautiful come from me 
After the gunshots, thought you was done with me. 

But I know why I'm livin' now 
Why you made me put the guns down, 
Pick up the mic, start rappin' for a livin' now 

My sun, my moon, my stars, my Earth, 
My wind, my fire, my life, my baby 
Tryin' to make your moms wifey but she crazy 
Fussin' me, fightin' me 
I know she love me 'cause you look just like me 
The day you came into this world, I was so excited

You see this rap shit, I do it for you 
And the first time I heard your voice 
I prayed to God it had to be true 
Got a son now. 
Cuttin' the game, stoppin' the bullshit 

Remember arm your enemy 
Then you pull quick 
Dipped out Cali, 
Came back snatched my son 
My girl's moms and I moved out Maui 
Yeah yeah Pops gone bananas 
See why I win her 
Bigger house, wider yard, Navi with the crash bar 
Pumpin' her, shifty you stupid 
You ain't no dad, nigga 
Takin' your black ass to court for all you have nigga 

You see me and your moms that's another topic 
Ain't no whip in this world with a price that you can't cop it 
Stop it 
Impress with wine, you didn't hear me right 
It's a lesson to this song, I'm trying to steer you right 
Just remember your father taught you to go hard or go home 
Never sing that sad song 
Don't cry

I'mma let your mom school you 
Don't let the streets fool you 
Streets straight through you 
That's why I'm talking to you 

You see these niggas out here have you stressin' by the hour 
Never turn your back on your foes 
Them dudes cowards 

Some days sweet and some sour 
But we gon' make it together 
The world is ours and you're my flower 

If it's ice, you can get that 
Model chicks, hit that 
Never stress about the downfall 
Just 'bout to get back 

And I'm not saying sex is wrong 
Just make sure you strap a condom on 
And never ever do it in your mother's home 

Never call a girl a bitch, 
Show respect son 
Pop your collar 
Ain't nothing free 
Scrape the block for every dollar 

I'm gonna leave you with this my little angel 
Daddy loves you 
How I'd die for you, cry for you, ride for you

Game,"Coming up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl
Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, ""Check check out My Melody""
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood

(G-G-G-G-G-Unit!) On the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides, right above the gold wires
I'll fo'-five 'em, kill a nigga on my song
And really do it, that's the true meaning of a ghostwriter
Ten G's 'll take your daughter out of Air Forces
Believe you me homey, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call'll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats, been banging
Since my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's ten years, I told Pooh in ninety-five
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's
Told Banks when I met him I'mma ride
And if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide
I ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died
Now I'm going back to Cali with my Jacob on
See how time fly?

Winners win this is real we ain't got to pretend

Used to see Five-O, throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fuckin' with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense
My moms happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land, sitting in the Range
Thinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starving
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage

No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted
I think what if Marie Baker got that abortion?

And I can't forget, my niggas ridin the train, Yankee fitted
Snub nose under that Pelle shit
I love New York, but gangbangin that's L.A. shit
And I'm proud of it, spit it through the wire so the crowd love it
Haters you know who you are, you can turn it down, fuck it {*volume fades*}
{*volume rises*} I can shoot a video to it and spend half the budget
I'm gangster, let the 40 cal blow in public
More hatred inside my soul than 'Pac had for Delores Tucker
Every time one of my niggas get shot, the more I suffer
Cause we trapped inside a world where you forced to die for your colors
I seen it all through the Range tints
Got niggas doin life in the state pen
So I dread like Jamaicans
If I die for one of my statements
Then break up the streets of Compton
Spread my blood in the pavement

Believe me
Niggas keep sayin they gon' heat me up
Talkin that shit like they gon' lay me down
But when I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't want no parts of me pal
Believe me
Niggas keep sayin they gon' heat me up
Talkin that shit like they gon' lay me down
But when I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't want no parts of me pal

Who I gotta talk to, who I gotta write
Get my Reebok deal done or I'm stayin in Air Nikes, aight?
I handle bars, you ain't gotta ride a bike
To beat Game in his skills, here go some trainin wheels
Let's roll, through the City of God, where niggas trained to kill
We'll chop you up a hundred times worse than the Haitians will
F'real, nah f'real I need a track homey
Dre we too close, ain't no turnin back homey
Deal with it, I'mma be here for ten years
Spittin like the ghost of Eric Wright and Big here
Let me paint this picture while you sit here
Thinkin in the back of your mind, this is the shit, yeah
I spit for niggas doin 25 on they fifth year
Ready to throw a nigga off the fifth tier
Them white boys in the Abercrombie & Fitch gear
And every nigga who ever helped me to get here

Believe me
Niggas keep sayin they gon' heat me up
Talkin that shit like they gon' lay me down
But when I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't want no parts of me pal
Believe me
Niggas keep sayin they gon' heat me up
Talkin that shit like they gon' lay me down
But when I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't want no parts of me pal

It go one brick, two brick, the boy movin weight
Now three bricks, four bricks, I'm drivin upstate
Five bricks, six bricks, the nigga got cake
Not rap money, but money been wrapped since eighty-eight
Look at the world we live in, niggas steady hate
'til the Heckler and Koch, leave 'em chopped up like Freddie's face
Niggas catchin feelings cause I'm about millions
And out of all the newcomes out, my flow the illest
You a close second nigga, banana to a gorilla
Put us in the same cage, and I'mma have to peel him
The best of both worlds, rappin and drug dealin
Run and tell Lateef I came to burn down the village
The head honcho, starin out the third story window
Of my Beverly Hills condo
Two long-ass Heats, I call 'em Shaq and Alonzo
You niggas want me out of L.A., geah I know

Believe me
Niggas keep sayin they gon' heat me up
Talkin that shit like they gon' lay me down
But when I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't want no parts of me pal

Game,"Yo Havoc, I'm too close to the edge on this one nigga
I ain't gon' jump though, I'mma keep it raw gutter
Yo Prodigy, you know I need you on this one nigga

I got shit on my chest, I must confess
Last night I was the nigga that shot up your projects
Now I'm back in the hood, with rocks in the Pyrex
Tan khakis and them Nike Airs with the dyed checks
I was forced to live this life, forced to bust my chrome
My pops left me in a foster home
I felt abandoned like Quik now that Mausberg gone
So I don't hop in the SS without the Mossberg homes
I've been rappin' for a year and a half, my life is real
Put the gun in his mouth, he gon' bite the steel
Come to Compton, I got stripes for real
Before Dre, before the ice, before the deal - I was almost killed
Like 'Pac before the Death Row deal
I got shot over two pounds of weed, still ain't found them niggas
But karma come quicker for a nigga on the other side of the gun
That's somethin I gotta teach my son

Need it, I don't want it, I don't need it
I don't need your love, no I don't need your love
I don't need your love
Cause, the, game, don't, change

I heard they got Bloods in New York now
Red rags in Uptown Harlem now, I need that love
Front court at the Knicks game, new chick, French name
New car, new house, and sometimes friends change
And you don't need that love, when you G's like us
And your Jesus piece is sim-u-lar to Biggie's
And your life story is sim-u-lar to 50's
First they hate you, then they love you, then they hate you again
What the fuck do it take for a gangsta to win?
No mics, no Unsigned Hype, nigga fuck The Source
Plus them awards I don't need
And them niggas breathing the same air as me, acting like they don't bleed
We don't drive the same speed, this a Continental T
That's a case of Armadale, this a continental suite
So I'mma drown in my own sorrows
Live life, fuck tomorrow, nigga cause reality is

I don't need your love, no no no no

I was gassed up, Murder Inc., Roc-A-Fella passed up
Sat in Daddy's House with Black Rob and Lou and asked Puff
Now The Game's set in stone, the Franck Muller's set in stones
Dre cut me a check, I'm gone
Tryin to be the king of the streets, niggas'll wet your throne
But I got nieces to feed, two coasts to please
So I roam through the city like the ghost of E
Gotta put Compton back where it's 'sposed to be
Nothing between all my niggas that's close to me
In the streets with two fellas packing toast for me
I'm 'posed to be, got all the critics watching my pivot
On my block in the Coupe reading kites from prison
I got niggas doing life in prison
All my fallen soldiers is one of the reasons we pour out liquor
So this song is for Ms. Wallace, Afeni Shakur
And all the mothers of dead sons that went out in the war

Because these conjugal visits just ain't enough
I'm really looking forward to a future for us
Baby don't worry 'bout it
I'mma beeee right here, waitin on you

Even took a second job
So they won't take the clause and put a lean on the
House
I know it's gonna be a while before you get out, ooh
Baby don't worry 'bout it (don't worry)
I'mma beeee right here, waitin on you

And them dudes you ran with are foul
They been tryna get at me, ever since you been down
Even my girls are tellin me, I should end it all now
Baby don't worry about it
I'mma be

All I can think about is that honey complexion
And the way your skin glow when you slippin on them Dior dresses
I know you wonderin why I got you a Smith 'n Wesson
Cause them niggas in the hood is the reason we stressin
I miss that gangsta love and that lil' affection
Them butter soft lips when you kissin my chest and
Mary I put nuttin above you
And behind that vest I got a heart ma gangstas need love too

Some think the worst of you
They portray you as a man, it's not that far from the truth
You were caught up in the game and now it's, caught up to you
Baby don't worry about it
I'mma be right here, waitin on you

It used to be caramel skin tones, Sprewell rims on
Glass house, ass out, Jacob watch, gemstones
Bandanna, Nike Airs, tennis bracelet, wife hair
Black rag, do or die, .45 right here
Every time I was down, you was always right there
Whenever visitin hours came, I know my wife there
So pink diamonds right here, chain hang, ice there
The reason for my tattooed tear - I need you to hold me down

I'll be waiting on you (I'll)
I'll be waiting on you (I'ma be right here whenever you call me babe)
I'll be waiting on you (ooh-oh)
Baby don't worry about it
I'mma be right here, waitin on you

I'm locked up countin the days down
Tryna hold my head cause the penitentiary ain't no playground
I'm dyin in here and I don't know how you stay down
In the shootin range twice a week bustin that trey-pound
I would never ask you to wait around
But how do a white sandy beach in St. Tropez sound?
And no more outta town trips on that Greyhound
Just me hittin like a beat from Dr. Dre, out

I'll be waiting on you (I'll be waiting)
I'll be waiting on you (I'ma be right here, for you ba-by)
I'll be waiting on you (I'll)
Baby don't worry about it (don't worry babe)
I'mma be right here (I'ma be) waitin on you

I'll be waiting on you (I'ma be right here waitin for you baby)
I'll be waiting on you (you know I will)
I'll be waiting on you (whenever you need me baby)
Baby don't worry about it (I'll be right here, I'll be right here)
I'mma be right here, waitin on you (don't you worry)

I'm lookin' for a future with you baby
Wanna see you real soon, real soon, real soon

Game,"A lot of people are advocated 
That the rich gets richer and the poor gets poorer
That's only because you don't understand
Whats going to happen to you, 
You see its all just a game ladies and gentlemen
And the quality of your living depends entirely 
Upon your ability to play the game
And I play the game",Intro to the Documentary,
Game,"[Verse 1: The Game]
June 30th, 11:07 I got that call
She 8 centimeters, my lil' man about to fall
Scuffing my Air Forces, running through the hospital hall
Deja Vu, like I been here before
I'm feeling reborn, like a Bed-Stuy brethren, my first born
Dre, I'm about to have a bad boy, family in the lobby
See my nigga Church, ""What Up,"" shit I left the camcorder in the truck
Running through the maternity ward, out of breath, sweating
I swear to God every minute's starting to feel like a second
I seen Hell staring down the barrel of a Smith & Wesson
My son's ultrasound the closest I ever been to Heaven
Lord forgive me for my sins, I know it's last minute
Put the chronic in the air, a little hash in it
Spread my wings, If only I could fly
Why fight to live homie?, If we only living to die

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
I hope you grow up to become that everything you can be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like Father, like Son
But in the end I hope you only turn out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like Father, like Son
My little man, your day is coming, coming, your day is coming, I tell you
And when it comes, just keep it running, running, just keep it running, I tell you

[Verse 2: The Game]
They say every time somebody die a child is born
So I thank the nigga who gave his life for the birth of my son
11:32, she screaming at the top of her lungs
I'm panicking, nurse yelling for the doctor to come
All I could remember was Lamaze class, breathe baby
""One (one), two (two), three (three), four (four),"" I see the head
Doc busting through the door, he between the legs 
He see the head, it's my baby boy
11:46, the head out, she screaming, making crazy noise
Pain is love, my stomach folding like a La-Z-Boy
I'm feeling like Mariah Carey, all these butterfly's
Voices singing to me, sound like Teena Marie
I'm calling niggas on tour, ""Jayo tell ? I just cut the umbilical cord""
11:57, a soldier is born, and he's flesh of my flesh, young ? ?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: The Game]
I want to thank Dr. Dre and Nurse Theresa, for bringing my baby boy to life
You birthed a Caesar, And my baby Mama, Aliska
For pushing out a 10-pound, 4-ounce Mini-Me, I still can't believe it
Nose, ears, eyes, chin, just like your Daddy 
I die before you grow up and be just like your Daddy, or your Grandfather
Call Uncle Dre, tell him I got a son and I ain't even in Harlem
I'm popping Cris with your Godfathers, Baron Davis and ""D-Mack"" Darius Rogers
Drop the top on the '71, with my face in the clouds, Lord spare my son
And watch over Aaron Wright, T'Yan and Lil' Pun
Lowriding, banging ""Ready to Die,"" track number 1
If I bust 5 times and they never see the sun
My life is a black hole, like the barrel of a gun, one

It was me against the world baby girl; you had dreams of stardom
The Prince of Compton meets the Queen of Harlem

The fur, the Gucci, Louis, Fendi, Prada, Dolce

McLaren or Rover, fuck it ma let's tear up the highway
Let the Sprewells spin 'til the plates fall off
Then we can go one-on-one in Dre's house
Jeans painted with the waist cut out, you rock 'em the fly way

The way you smile, the way you swingin them hips when you walk
The way you look, the way you ride when you workin them thighs
The way you lickin your lips when you look in my eyes
You down for me? I'm down for you
You go down on me, I'll go down on you
I wanna do all the things that your man won't do
I'm from the hood, so I know how to handle you
Keep you in pink rocks and G-Unit canvas shoes
Show you how to gangsta lean when the Lambo move
I'll take you to New York City, Atlanta too
Show you how to fly them birds and them hammers through

How I stand on the block all day and flip birds and ki's
Your boyfriend don't like me, cause he don't get a fourth of my cheese
And you can take back the Porsche and his keys
Hop in the Range Rover, you ain't gotta force him to leave
I got a chrome four-four in my jeans
You got Gucci frames coverin the mark on your face
Cause he don't want you to leave, and I don't want you to stay
Sometimes I wanna snatch that nigga out his CLK
I know he treatin you the way K-Ci did Mary J

Workers in the kitchen cookin up my shit
Same telephone booth, same connect
That mean the same hollow tips breakin up in my chest
Same bloody t-shirt, same address
Same ""Dogg Food"" album bangin in my tape deck
Homey if I can make '94 today
I'd tell Eazy and Dre to bring back N.W.A
I woulda told 'Pac not to stomp out Orlando
Told Puffy and Big about the Rampart scandal
I got too many dead homies, fuck a rap career
I'd give anything in the world to bring back my nigga Tear
Seem like we was just in Magic City yesterday
If I could bring back my homeboy Charles, he would say

If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance, I would do just that
I'd give anything just to go right back
If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance, I would do just that
I'd give anything just to go right back

Homey if I could rewind the hands of time
I woulda cut off the PS2 at 12:49
Nigga I'm a gangster, I stay on my grind
Who knew 11 minutes later I'd get shot with my own 9
I was two beeps away from a flatline
When you a Bad Boy niggas don't wanna see you Shyne
Dre said it's my turn, he call it Game time
23 inch Lexani's, bitches call 'em LeBrons
I'd give my own life if I could change God's mind
Bring Baby Loony back at the drop of a dime
He let off a whole 'K, got shot one time
That was a cool nigga, I wish he had nine lives
My brother Jevon died cause he chased the cat
It's a dog eat dog world, Jesus please holla back
I got a confession to make, it's called payback
If you don't wanna listen, show me where Pastor Ma$e at

If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance, I would do just that
I'd give anything just to go right back
If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance, I would do just that
I'd give anything just to go right back

I woulda told Big Will they raid every Tuesday and Thursday
When pigeons in your coupe, you gotta watch where your birds lay
Woulda told V to stay sober
When niggas ""Beg for Mercy,"" that mean the beef is over
Told Meeks take the Porsche back, drive the Rover
Told Slim hit reverse on that hardtop Nova
I woulda changed a couple of lines when I wrote ""Soldier""
So I wouldn't have to live lookin over my shoulder
My life is like a Impala, ridin three-wheel motion
I been front to back, side to side
Level my six-four frame out, keep on rollin
Keep your family far away and your enemies closer
Picture this, The Source suckin Benzino's dick
Tryin to be the big fish in the pond, you know how them piranhas get
You dead when that green line go flat
If you could start your life from scratch, you couldn't change that

If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance, I would do just that

At first they embraced him, had a couple of face lifts

These niggas is killing it take a minute to listen
Turn down my Jimi Hendrix, I'll throw your demo out the window
For tellin me its hot when its not and you got what you got
From them rocks on the block, you can stop tellin Dre you got shot
With a Glock that don't phase me

I watched the death of a dynasty, so I told Vibe Magazine
Workin' with Dr. Dre was a (dream)
I had visions of makin a classic, then my world turned black
Like I was starin' out of Stevie Wonder's glasses
It's kinda hard to imagine, like Kanye West
Coming back from his fatal accident to beatmaking and rapping
But, we the future, Whitney Houston told me that
And it's gon' take more than a bullet in the heart to hold me back

Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a (dream)
Aaliyah had a (dream), Left Eye had a (dream)
So I reached out to Kanye and (I brought you all my dreams)
(Cause I love you, I love you, I love you)

I had dreams of fuckin' a R&B bitch like Mya
When I saw that ass on the front of that King
Read the article in the magazine, she loved gangsters, loved nasty things
So I'm in the glass house having nasty dreams
Good girls never give it up
But anything is possible, if 50 fucked Vivica
Hurdled life's obstacles, found my way through the maze
Then joy turned to pain like Frankie Beverly and Maze
Used to dream of being Unsigned Hype
'til I was crushed by Dave Mays, almost let my pen fall asleep on the page
Daydreamin' yesterday, dozin' off backstage
I thought I saw Eazy talking to Jam Master Jay
So I walked over, heard Jam Master say
""It's a hard knock life, then you pass away""
They say sleep is the cousin of death, so my eyes wide open
Cause a dream is kin to your last breath

Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a (dream)
Aaliyah had a (dream), Left Eye had a (dream)
So I reached out to Kanye and (I brought you all my dreams)
(Cause I love you, I love you, I love you)

The dream of Huey Newton that's what I'm livin' through
The dream of Eric Wright, that's what I'm givin you
Who walked through the White House without a business suit
Compton hat, jheri curl drippin on Ronald Reagan's shoes
Gave Mike Lem my demo, came here to pay my dues
Started off with Whoo Kid, then I start blazin' Clue
It was all a dream like Big said it'd be
Don't sleep on me homey, I bring nightmares to reality
Rap phenomenon, defyin' the rules of gravity
Studied all the classics, start revisin' my strategy
Cause Marshall Mathers made it, Curtis Jackson made it
Head in the clouds, wonderin' where the hell Marvin Gaye went
How do I say this? I'm livin' for my son
But I can't figure out, why I'm at my temple with this gun
Wake up to a Jesus piece like a catholic nun
The war to be a rap legend, has just begun

Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a (dream)
Aaliyah had a (dream), Left Eye had a (dream)
So I reached out to Kanye and (I brought you all my dreams)
(Cause I love you, I love you, I love you)

Game,"[Chorus]
All I know is this pain in this life
And this struggle it chose me so
All I know is that I'm stuck on this road
Of success so I got to get mine
All I know is this pain in this life
And this struggle it chose me so
All I know, all I know

Red phantom, they say I look like Josh Smith from Atlanta
I do, ha-choo, excuse you, that nigga look like me
He from the G.A., and I'm M easy, that's Game
I don't do what you niggas do, that's lame
I Soo Woo with my crew from the from the Burque
I Soo Woo with my crew, from under Young Wayne
A walkin' motherfuckin' flame livin' up to my brothers name
Rockin' that red shit, wasn't fuckin' with them other gangs
Amongst other things, they wasn't fuckin' with me
Ain't your average motherfucker, I'm a motherfuckin' G
I got some shit on my chest that I want to get off
I got some shit for that vest that will knock that bullshit off
Money like Madoff, Kill 'em like Adolf, Roy Halladay
I'll let a fuckin' K off, and I don't take a fucking day off 

[Chorus]

Cincinnati C hat, Boston B hat, ? them Philadelphia P hats
Believe that, bring it to the hood so you can see that
Dumb ass niggas like Game, where the keys at?
Automatic start, nigga where the trees at?
Red boned bitch like Alisha, where the keys at?
Freeze that, like a fucking picture
If you ain't a blood I ain't fucking with ya nah I'm just fucking with ya
Stay on my hood shit, hop in the bucket with ya
Throw the ski másks on and get to straight fucking with ya
Ain't that some shit, that bustards sick
You wanna know how I'm livin' nigga ask your bitch
Told you precisely how to ask and sit, and she a nasty bitch
I came in her mouth ask her lips, you know why?
'Cause I had to go past them lips, trick
You probably paid for that ass and tits for 

[Chorus]

Fuck with the blood clot, smile for my mug shot
Can't go out like 'em but I love Big, I love Pac
Love Fab, love Kiss that's where the love stops
'Casue I sleep with the enemy and I hug blocks
Birthed me in the drug spot, nigga with a attitude
Searching me is fuck cops, nigga pay your gratitude
Before you say I'm acting Ruth
Understand I'm tryna feed my people
Hati just like Compton the way I'm packing food
But I will act a fool, put cheese on your head
Motherfucker I will Green Bay Packer you
Have a whole football team of niggas after you
Like the public turn, when will you fucking learn
Now take your ass back to school
Wait till three o'clock click clack at you
And fuck with your conscience like back packers do
And I ain't Talib, Black Though or Mos Def
But I've seen the most deaths and nigga I'm just telling you

Game,"QB the whole NYC 
We gonna bounce to this 
To all my niggaz (yeah yeah) 
To all the ladies 

Chorus: 
Sometimes I wonder 
Will a nigga go under because of his hunger 
This game is risky 
If a nigga slips six deep 
Will these niggaz really miss me 
Dead partners too soon 
All these niggaz flipping on me 
Cause I won't give no loot to them 
Sometimes I wonder 
Sometimes I... 

(Nas) 
Top of the world is what I'm aiming at 
These niggaz is flaming gats at my circle 
I catch you, my first reaction is to hurt you 
I hit your bird too, two in your scalp then you out 
Your thug crew is out, blood oozing out 
Some serving caine 
Knowing nothing about this murder game 
Its easily told but hard to hear 
When niggaz finally find out its real 
that's when they heart pumps fear 
The real remains the weak will disappear 
My words is 20/20, my vocals are crystal clear 
911 style sits on your mind like chrome 
Lets say your brains is V12, put it in drive let it roam 
What color? Might as well make it same as your dome 
You need your thoughts together, that means destination is unknown 
As we travel on this road, an infinite path, I get into this math 
Drop and get intense for this cash 
Will I be subject to kill, live my life by a gat 
Just when I think I made it out, the street is calling me back 

Chorus: 
(Nature) 
I know a lot of fiends by they first name 
Living in Queens, a lot of cats getting stuck for they chains 
Holding dirty guns, the young owe dirty ones 
Running wild, niggaz I raise hell above ground 
Live in sin, holding rocks, benjamin grin 
Figure once I got knocked, it would end 
Never that 
They try to tell me I don't love my own 
The thugs know, they ride my zone 
Like the cyclone trademark 
For coney isle, yeah you know me now 
I'm giving fake hugs, phoney smiles 
Stack profits, you know how the niggaz on the block get 
Try to give you dap to stare at your pockets 
Cruise advance nothing new just the rules of the land 
You could tell if they wolves or lamb 
You could fight a few, there's a few that ran 
Or you could feed them and lose your hand 
What you want to do? 

Chorus: 
(Nas) 
Blessing be to the ones who left us 
Transcend into spiritual essences 
In Allah's arms you rest in 
To him we pray for my peeps 
Floyd, Twin and Taiyeh, Mr. Sunny back in the day 
Get the money yam, he use to say not only nice with hands 
But streetsmart he was twice a man 
I try to understand life's deep plot 
I think of Weewop, Shikeisha they both was mad nice on the rocks 
They could have went pro but only God knows why not 
Like my nigga Bing, let your sneakers not be clean 
He'll start snapping on you, making a scene 
Kept the lye, a cool nigga warm heart and stayed fly 
You still alive, I see you in your sister's face 
Are you there pa? Or looking on from a distant place? 
My thoroughbreds, Blackhead quiet but real 
Expect to see your black jeep fly over the hill 
In the spirit of Richie Lou tribute 
Remind the world of the crimes that NY pigs do 
We miss you, Harry and Sonia 
Rest in peace to Marty, a 41st side of Vernon soldier 
T.J. Black better known as Killer 
I can't replace you, but in me Havoc will always have a brother my nigga 

My man Will till we meet again 
You hold it up there, I'll hold it down here 
I hope you hear my prays clear

From the world's most infamous, 1st Infantry

We boyz in da hood...wanna see a dead body)

Sittin' in a lowrider, murda on my mind
'Cause I had too many dead homies in my lifetime
That's why I ride wit a nine and dem hollow tips
Lift niggaz like a chrome hydraulic switch
Wit a hood rat in the car that swallow dicks
So good that I got P on that six-four Impala shit
She from Compton just like me
Caramel wit extensions just like Eve
She want to go to a Knicks game, sit next to Spike Lee
Well do the right thing, blow a nigga out his Nikes
She married to The Game, that's wifey
Ask Gotti get them blood stains out your white tee
P in the backseat finger fuckin' her girlfriend
That'll put a golf ball hole in your right cheek
Start trippin' over colors like Ice-T
And you can watch your life slip away through an I.V

We out in Cali, P and Game straight blow that bitch up
We out in New York, P and Game we blow that bitch up
You can't stop us, we gettin' this money its not bangin'
You can't pull that shit this way, we head bangin'
Wit dem glocks and dem oo-ops
Me and my fools shoot, wutchu tryin' do that
I suggest you do not
My chain is hot, what's more hot than that
That's how I murda music, that's why your broads on my back
Got two birds on my shoulders, they all over me
And ready to fuck Game and whoever else roll wit me
My presence is strong, I have a bitch seein' dollar
Signs spots stare at me too long
Have you seein' that white light you come at me wrong
Or any one of my dawgs, I'll be settin' it off
You was raised on beef and live real drama
Don't let the coupes twist you, we lettin' o's off

We out in this...P and Game, we'll blow that bitch up

P and Game, we'll blow that bitch up, mixed with the A L see

We out in Compton, P and Game lacin' Chucks
We out in QB, P and Game rollin' a Dutch
Dumpin' ashes out the windshield

Ridin' to Suga Hill bangin' shook ones
On the westside highway, hand on the steel
If I like your chain then blood spill
'Cause I ain't getta million dollars when I signed my deal

Nigga I'll tie your wife to a chair and blow that bitch up
You better fire proof your crib, I'll blow that shit up
I'm all about this crime shit for real, this rap shit is luck
Try to score points on me, I'll fasten you up
In that smelly proof bag, real real fast
Shoot the deuce under my arm, I'm real real slick
Can't put a tail on me, I drive too fast
Can't put tag on me, I smoke people ass

If you from the westside, nigga throw that shit up
If you bang to eastside, nigga throw that shit up
I ain't tryna be in The Source or Double X L
I'm just tryna fuck Trina 'cause Dre said sex sells
And it was either this or jail
Imagine tryna fit birds in a Honda Accel
And they caught up on the Fed Ex mail
So we stopped doin' business and chirpin' on Nextels
We gangstas

I fold people in half, I tore people ass
But they still want to ride out as long as we see death
I get money, and I don't need your help or friendship
But love, I'ma survive just how I been

Down,
You gotta lose all feelin

Funny how the world revolves around my click
'cause just a year ago a nigga ain't have shit (damn)
Me and my right hand share the same outfit
Which fueled the fire that I air the game out with (whoo)
It's amazing the way that boy came out quick
For that platinum niggas'll blows ya brains out, shit (bap)
I'm the new nigga the others can't stand
The rubber band man be god damned if I can (oh)

I borrowed his gunits to walk through the matrix
I'm signed to the Doctor I ain't got no patience
So he put me with 50 Cent now I got a face lift
Magazines wanna know where they fuck L.A. been
It almost died in the same car Suge got grazed in
2001 I was playin' my PlayStation
I heard 9 shots , I'm face down with my heart pacing
All I could think about as hidin' my gun and my drugs in the basement
It was either that or the state pen
I woke up out of that coma
Police waitin' for a statement, (heart monitor beeps to flat line)

Pass the weed and let a nigga get into a zone
Papa left me all alone in the world to roam
But now I'm grown, millionaires on my cell phone
A year past now, caw dead and L gone
And I'm sick, bought chopper with a long click
So think about that before you make your songs dick (dick)
Or lose a limb, please don't get me confused with him (uh uh)
Cause I'm down to go a whole round, lose or win
If I should die, ride a G through the hood with pride (ride)
Every strip, block, and projects is on my side
I'm ghetto calm by the 100 grand on my arms (arms)

Walk with me through the ghetto where the packs get sold
And them niggas sellin' the work ain't half as old
as the fiends and the hippies, same ones smokin' since the 60's
Everybody yellin' gimme, gimme

Every nigga in the hood, one hand on his jimmy
Other hand grip the semi, come on walk with me
Every ten houses, one got 'caine for sale
And I give you a dope track like my name Phar-rell

And you can get that stainless steel
Walk in my Chuck Taylors for a day, if you think it ain't f'real
When I buy rocks homey baguettes on my ring
And only neighborhood watch is my Tecno Marine

Keep a (Mac) on the block, I ain't talkin 'bout Beans
QB in the hood and I'm far from Queens
The boys in the hood is always hard
So come through and get smoked like a Cuban cigar

I'm from Compton, Compton, a block from hell
And you can come get a bird for eleven
And we ain't got a penny for the reverend, a dime for a witness

Every nigga in the hood sell chickens move work like city buses
You fuckin' with the Hub City Hustler
The vans on the block won't touch us, the streets my home
So I move weight on the block like I'm Moses Malone

Bring the guns anywhere I roam, go with the chrome
And I hit all my shots, like I'm in the A.I. zone
And mob like Al Capone through N.W.A.'s home
Homes like Ed Jones will cripple your team up

In the home of Dr. Dre, Venus and Serena
Where 14-year-olds pack ninas and drive Beamers
We ball up subpeonas, take niggas to the cleaners
And you know what I'm talkin' about if y'all seen where..

[Chorus]

We drug dealin', but niggas is squealin' (fuck you rats)
What more can I say, just kill 'em
Fuck 'em, the gun bust 'em, we just knock on wood
Now is this under-stood?

I mostly George when I whip, my supply is good
The man behind the bricks, I'm supplyin' the hood
Catch bodies like Pistol Pete passes on the wood
Benz parked by the fence, brick stashed in the hood

Top work by the inch, I bag it, it's gone
Ask Quik, we rock more than microphones
Some niggas ball, some niggas do what we do
And other niggas sing for Cash Money like TQ

The block will heat and sink you (hey dude)
Cali ain't all palm trees, purple haze and sea dude
Lose your life tryin' to get these jewels
I keep the 40 cal wrapped in chrome like R2-D2

[The Game]
Amayah wake up baby
I know you're sleepin, but daddy's home now
Pictures gettin old, my lil' girl lookin grown now
Your moms said you're talkin on your own, walkin on your own now
Run across the kitchen floor in them baby drawers
I sent you from off tour and I miss you when I was tourin
Smilin at them baby pictures, so happy, tears pourin
God how can somethin so beautiful come from me?
After the gunshots thought you was done with me
But I know I'm livin now, why you made me put the guns down
Pick up the mic, start rappin for a living now
My sun, my moon, my starts, my earth
My wind, my fire, my life, my bay-bay
Tryin to make your moms life ya must be crazy, fussin and fightin
I know she love me cause ya look just like me
Day you came into this world I was so excited
Eleven twenty-one double-zero, my baby girl is here

[Chorus]

[Blue Chip]
Yo, yo, you see this rap shit I do it for you
And the first time I heard your voice I prayed to God it had to be true
Got a son now, cuttin the game, stoppin the bullshit
Remember eyein your enemy, can you pull quick
Dipped out Cali, came back, snatched my son
my girl moms and I moved out Maui
Yeah your pops gone bananas, seen wild went hard
Bigger house, wider yard, nappy with the crash bar
Off that hersh', shit you stupid, you ain't no dad nigga
Takin your black ass to court for all you have nigga
You see me and your moms, that's another topic
Ain't no whip in this world with a price you can't cop it
Stop it, press rewind, you didn't hear me right
It's a lesson to the song, I'm tryin to steer you right
Just remember your father taught you to go hard or go home
Never sing that sad song, don't cry

[Chorus]

[The Game]
Huh daddy ain't gon' preach to you, I'ma let your moms school you
Don't let the streets fool you, streets'll do you, that's why I'm talkin to you

[Blue Chip]
Yeah, you see these niggaz out here, have you stressin by the hour
Never turn your back on your foes, them dudes cowards

[The Game]
Some days sweet, and some sour - but we gon' make it together
The world is ours, and you're my flower

[Blue Chip]
If it's ice you can get that, model chicks hit that
Never stress about the downfalls just 'bout the getback

[The Game]
And I ain't sayin sex is wrong, just make sure he strap a condom on
And never, ever do it in your mother's home

[Blue Chip]
Yeah, never call a girl a bitch, show respect, son pop ya collar
Ain't nothin free, scrape and lock every dollar

[The Game]
And I will leave you with this, my lil' angel, daddy loves you
How I'd die for you, cry for you, ride for you

[Blue Chip]
Yeah, switchin handles like you breakin a zone, candy paint Impala
On the Golden Bridge, bouncin on chrome

[Chorus]",Don't Cry,2004
Game,"Live now, die later, flood or clock the shit out of haters
Got niggaz trying to ""Kiss the Game Goodbye"" like Jada
Get your shit pushed back like Jada's CD
I'll put your brains on that Kenwood TV

So you can see hell in 3D, it's right there dog
And the Game behind the desert is a nightmare dog
If it's pussy, I might share it dog, beef I'm right here dog
I'm on the block, white Nike Airs on

Gucci check, Coogi sweat, they wanna know
If 22's on the truck, give me coochie yet
But I come through in the new GS with two, three tecs
Got niggaz Harlem Shaking like the new G. Dep
Trying to read my whole script, but ain't seen the movie yet
Better have that Glock stuffed tonight
I'm coming through with Young Noble, and we, going, make, it
A block bust tonight

[Chorus x2]
Getting American money easy, all I know
The gangsta all motherfuckers envy, all my dough
It's a West Coast knot, watch, let it bang out
Shots range out, for all the gangster hangouts

Lace your tips, polish your gators, we like odds in Vegas
You can't ball? Then it's probably the haters
Can't breathe then it's probably the desert, if you a gangsta or not
I give a fuck dog, bullets is hot

And every nigga gonna cry when he hit, the more pain
The more blood drain, he ain't surviving shit
And your niggaz ain't gonna ride for shit, they know
If they came through everybody in the X-5 is hit

Red rag or blue rag, niggaz die for this
The Game the reason all these niggaz on that ""Cali Love"" shit
Compton niggaz get grimy too, pull you out of that 6
Fuck you up like one time will do

And I dare y'all to stop on the 'Shaw, and King Boulevard
Coming hard, Doogie Howser pulling bullets out your jaw
Turn your round trip into a one-way ticket
You can visit, but you can not lie and kick it

[Chorus]

We left a stain on your block, you came with a cop
Pointing fingers at them niggaz, that kept shit hot
Next to 'Pac, I'm the hottest thing out, homey we can bang out
Outlaw air it out, box 'em in, square it out

Learn about your whereabouts and we right there
Me and Game have you left right there
N-O-B-L-E, O-U-T-L-A-W-Z
We bubble with ease, and I double my cheese

I got niggaz out in Compton that'll find yo' ass
I got niggaz out in Jersey, that'll hide yo' ass
For a long time if you ever fuckin' with mine
It's a thin line dog between the real and the fraud

We killing your squad, my homeboy still in the yard
You the type of motherfucker standing next to the God
The Game is deep, you motherfuckers ain't the streets
Young Noble and the homey Game flaming heat, come on

[Chorus]",G.A.M.E,2004
Game,"Father you give us power to speak the word father
You say
We have but to ask with a sincere heart and it will be
So we thank you for this spoken word father
You say that when one or more come together 
In your name your presents will be felt
So we now only ask to feel your presents 
We need to feel your presents father
We thank you for the blessings you have given us this day
Things that people don't even realize that are blessings
The food you have given us to eat

The cars you have given us to drive
The cloths you have given us to wear
The money you have given us to spend
The lives you have allowed us to touch
And the lives that have touched our own 
We thank you for all these things father in the name of Jesus
We thank you again for the power of the spoken word
I pray that by the end of this day this word 
Which is your word coming through my mouth
Will touch someone
And save someone's life
In Jesus mighty name I pray
Amen amen",Outro,2004

Rock the mic anywhere and I ain't talkin' 'bout a concert dog
Talkin 'bout ten niggaz in converse dog

In my neighborhood, I'm young Bill Gates, never shuffle the cake
So cover my face and run up in the place

80 karats on my pinky and rang

Crews buzz when you speakin' my name, 'cause I'm deep in the game

Game,"Sometimes I wonder
Man, how long is it gon' be for my people to come up
Man, we strugglin', it's hard sometimes
But tomorrow's better than yesterday

I was born in the slums, struggled from day one
Ray Charles vision, blinded by the light from the sun
No navigation, no sense of direction
Darker complexion made it hard to live

Dad, how you fathered your kids?
Stranded on the highway of life
Left us out to die, left us out to dry
Shh, I'm still hearin' my mother's cries, nigga

No father figures make harder niggaz
Through the years, went to war with niggaz
From what I saw in the picture

Now your son is bigger, thirteen, looks just like you
Mom said I would grow up and be just like you
From what you did to my sister, she disliked you
Sixteen, eleventh grade, look at me, just like you

Gunnin' for riches, runnin', hoppin' project fences
Street corners to Arizona, how I earn my digits
And I'm far from finished, gamin' till my coffee diminish
Why pray for the after life when mines just beginnin', huh

Only son by our mother, no brothers, only sisters by this one
Every time I kissed one, I missed one, let me explain
Eight years before The Game, everything came with pain
Watch the fate of my family slain would never see good times again

Cursed with pain by a nigga with no shame
My father bear the same name as his father
My grandfather wouldn't believe, he pulled up our family tree
I can see him rollin' over in his coffin'

I'm left with often thoughts of how could you molest your daughter
They say that's ten times worse than manslaughter
Man, you oughta be dead in a grave
But it wasn't my call, so instead you sat in a cage

High-powered, two-hundred and fifty pound, six-five coward
Woulda been dead in an hour
Heard you were scared to take a shower, scared of the yard
Your end is near, you shoulda been scared of God, motherfucker",Just Beginning (Where I'm From),2004

'bout the same time Dre dropped 2001
Three years later the album is done
Aftermath presents: Nigga Witta Attitude, Volume One
Rap critics politickin, wanna know the outcome
Ready to Die, Reasonable Doubt and Doggystyle in one
I feel like 'Pac after the Snoop Dogg trial was done
Dre behind that G series and All Eyez on Me
I watched the death of a dynasty, so I told Vibe Magazine
Workin' with Dr. Dre was a (dream)
I had visions of makin a classic, then my world turned black
Like I was starin' out of Stevie Wonder's glasses
It's kinda hard to imagine, like Kanye West
Coming back from his fatal accident to beatmaking and rapping
But, we the future, Whitney Houston told me that
And it's gon' take more than a bullet in the heart to hold me back

Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a (dream)
Aaliyah had a (dream), Left Eye had a (dream)
So I reached out to Kanye and (I brought you all my dreams)
(Cause I love you, I love you, I love you)

I had dreams of fuckin' a R&B bitch like Mya
When I saw that ass on the front of that King
Read the article in the magazine, she loved gangsters, loved nasty things
So I'm in the glass house having nasty dreams
Good girls never give it up
But anything is possible, if 50 fucked Vivica
Hurdled life's obstacles, found my way through the maze
Then joy turned to pain like Frankie Beverly and Maze
Used to dream of being Unsigned Hype
'til I was crushed by Dave Mays, almost let my pen fall asleep on the page
Daydreamin' yesterday, dozin' off backstage
I thought I saw Eazy talking to Jam Master Jay
So I walked over, heard Jam Master say
""It's a hard knock life, then you pass away""
They say sleep is the cousin of death, so my eyes wide open
Cause a dream is kin to your last breath

Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed

Aaliyah had a (dream), Left Eye had a (dream)
So I reached out to Kanye and (I brought you all my dreams)
(Cause I love you, I love you, I love you)

The dream of Huey Newton that's what I'm livin' through
The dream of Eric Wright, that's what I'm givin you
Who walked through the White House without a business suit
Compton hat, jheri curl drippin on Ronald Reagan's shoes
Gave Mike Lem my demo, came here to pay my dues
Started off with Whoo Kid, then I start blazin' Clue
It was all a dream like Big said it'd be
Don't sleep on me homey, I bring nightmares to reality
Rap phenomenon, defyin' the rules of gravity
Studied all the classics, start revisin' my strategy
Cause Marshall Mathers made it, Curtis Jackson made it
Head in the clouds, wonderin' where the hell Marvin Gaye went
How do I say this? I'm livin' for my son
But I can't figure out, why I'm at my temple with this gun
Wake up to a Jesus piece like a catholic nun
The war to be a rap legend, has just begun

Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed

Aaliyah had a (dream), Left Eye had a (dream)

1970 somethin' nigga I don't sweat the date my moms was late,
So I had to plan my escape, out the skins,
In this world the fly girls, Tanqueray and Hennesey,
Until I call Earl, 10 months in this gut, what the fuck,
I wish moms would hurry up, so I can get buck wild,
Juvenile with the mics 'n' shit, New York, New York, ready for the likes of this,
Then came the worst date, May 21st, 2:19 was when my momma water burst,
No spouse in the house, so she rolled herself,
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help,
Umbilical cords wrapped around my neck,
I'm seein' my death, and I ain't even took my first step,
I made it out i'm bringin' mad joy,
The doctor looked and said he's gonna be Bad Boy!

I remember back in time, 
Before all the homies died,
Before all the dollars and nines, I knew that I was
Goin' somewhere, let me take you back in time,
Before I even got my ride
Before I had nickels and dimes
I knew that I was goin' somewhere

Would 'Pac be alive, if you let 'Pac drive?
Swear to God to reverse it I give my left eye,
With the right I visualized, the king of Bed-Stuy,
Checkin' his daughter Tianna into junior high,
If I was in Brooklyn, and B.I. Was still alive, in 2006 it might sound like this,
N.&. 718 212, where Sue's rendevouz,
Its like Moulin Rouge,
High fashion, up town Air Force Ones,
And Vasquez, Puerto Ricans with fat asses
Lace Dutch masters, we dump ashes, on models and S Classes,
For you bastards, catch a cab to Manhattan,
With that Broadway actin', you hype that 
belly shit'd get you capped, and wrapped in plastic,
Tell the captain, ask Rog' what's happennin',
Out here nor speak no evil, inside the Magnum

Before all the homies died,
Before all the dollars and nines, I knew that I was
Goin' somewhere, let me take you back in time,

Now I'm 13 smokin' blunts, makin' green,
Or on the drug scene, fuck the football team,
Risk it, ruptured spleens, by the age of 16,
Hearin' the coach scream, make my lifetime dream,
I mean, I wanna blow up, stack my doe up,
So school I didn't show up, and fuck my flow up,
Mom said that I should grow up, and check myself,
Before I wreck myself, disrespect myself,
Put the drugs on the shelf, naww! I couldn't see it,
Scarface king of New York, I wanna be it,
Rap was secondary, money was necessary,
Until I got incarcerated, kinda scary,
C74 mark 8, set me straight, not able to move behind a great steel gate,
Time to contemplate, damn were did I fail,
All the money I stacked, was all the money for bail,

I remember back in time, 
Before all the homies died,
Before all the dollars and nines, I knew that I was

Pullin' on my waste, I'm feelin' energy 
Gettin' kinda hard to keep ya hands off me{Yeah, right there}

Twist it, shake it, bend but don't break it 
Work that body, gettin' so crazy 
Don't hurt nobody up in this party 
Twist it, shake it, bend but don't break it 
Twist it, shake it, bend but don't break it 
Work that body, gettin' butt-naked 
Don't hurt nobody up in this party 
Twist it, shake it, bend but don't break it 

Mix a little hypno with some Hennessey 
Like the way this jig goes when it goes through me 
Think I need to stop because I'm feelin' tipsy

Baby now I can't stop 'cause I'm in the zone 
Shorty keep it comin' boy, I'm grown 
I don't want to finish this dance alone 
Ooh I want to see ya

Work your body, don't hurt nobody up in this party

Game,"Coming up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl
Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, ""Check check out My Melody""
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

Guns on both sides, right above the gold wires
I'll fo'-five 'em, kill a nigga on my song
And really do it, that's the true meaning of a ghostwriter
Ten G's 'll take your daughter out of Air Forces
Believe you me homey, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call'll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats, been banging
Since my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's ten years, I told Pooh in ninety-five
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's
Told Banks when I met him I'mma ride
And if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide
I ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died
Now I'm going back to Cali with my Jacob on
See how time fly?

From the beginning to the end, losers lose
Winners win this is real we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in, is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me nigga now listen to Game

Used to see Five-O, throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fuckin' with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense
My moms happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land, sitting in the Range
Thinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starving
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know ""What's Going On"" like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted
I think what if Marie Baker got that abortion?

The West coast never fell off, I was asleep in Compton
Aftermath been here, the beats been knockin'
Nate Dogg doin' his thing, DPG still poppin'
I got California Love, fuckin' bitches to that 'Pac shit
And Westside Connection, been had it locked bitch
I'm in the rearview, my guns is cockin'
I put red dots on that nigga head like Rodman
All Stars, fat laces, gun charge, court cases
Fought that, not guilty, I'm back, niggas hate me
Been there, done that, sold crack, got jacked
Got shot, came back, jumped on Dre's back
Payback, homey I'm bringin' C.A. back
And I don't do button up shirts or drive Maybachs
All you old record labels tryin' to advance
Aftermath bitch, take it like a muh'fuckin' man

Hollow tips make niggas disappear like Houdini
Gang bangin' is real, homey I'm living proof
Like Snoop Dogg, C-walkin' on top of the devil's roof
Rap critics wanna converse, about this and that
Cause red strings in his Converse, and this a Dre track
Keep jibbin' and jabbin', I pull the .38 Magnum
And get to clickin' and clackin', your homies wanna know what happened
Come to Compton see Thriller like Mike Jackson
I might be, Spike Lee, of this gun clappin'
Prior to rappin', I was drug traffickin'
In the dope spot playin' John Madden
Homey I ain't braggin', I took five
You wanna die, run up on that black 745

I got niggas in Westside Compton and Southside Queens
And Buck told me in Cashville, I'm good when I come through
So I ain't gotta tuck in my chain like DJ Pooh
I'm gangsta - more like Deebo when he was Zeus
Play Bishop, I paint that picture, now who got the Juice?
You niggas is Nutso, I take off your roof
Leave yo' ass stretched out like a Cadillac coupe
God gotta let me in heaven, all the shit I've been through
I was a O.G. in the hood before I turned twenty-two
Homey I let the 38 special ripped through that vest
And I don't contemplate whether or not he left his shit on the dresser
Got Compton on my back, I'm startin' to feel the pressure
I'm lyrically Kool G. Rap on these Dre records

Uh huh

Comin' up I was confused, my mommy kissin' a girl
Confusion occurs comin' up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out commitin' felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, ""Check check out My Melody""
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin', niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothin' good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top

I told Dre from the gate ""I'd carry the heat for ya""
First mixtape song I inherited beef for ya
Gritted my teeth for ya, G-G-G-G for ya
Put Compton on my back when you was in need of soldiers
At my last show I threw away my N.W.A. gold
I had the whole crowd yellin ""Free Yayo!""
So niggas better get up outta mine
For I creep and turn your projects into Columbine
And I'm rap's MVP
Don't make me remind y'all what happened in D.C
This nigga ain't Gotti, he pretend
Mad at us 'cause Ashanti got a new boyfriend
And it seems your lil' rat turned out to be a mouse

This is real we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in, is full of pressure and pain
I thought it would change, it's stayin' the same

How many of them boys is witcha'
When you had that little TV you had to hit on to get a picture
I'm walking with a snub, 'cause niggas do a lot of slick talkin'
In the club 'til they coughin' on the rug
Ain't never had much but a Walkman and a bud
My role model is gone snortin' up his drug
Bad enough they want me to choke, my boy just got poked in the throat
Now it's an RIP shirt in my coat
Now I'm speedin', reminiscin'
Holdin' my weed in, never listen
If I see him I'ma lift 'em
And maybe that'll even the score

I started out at 15, scared as hell
I took 30 off a pack and I made them sales
As a youth, man I used to hustle for loot
With that lil' deuce-deuce and my triple fat goose
Sippin' Easy Jesus, rockin' a Alesis
My momma whipped me when she found my pieces
I look back on life and thank God I'm blessed
We the best on the planet so forget the rest

You know I'm still nice with my cook game
Look man, it's a hood thang; that's why I'm loved in Brook-lyn
I handle mine just like a real nigga should
If I do some time homey, I'm still all good
Let me show you what a thug 'bout, born to die
I took the bullets outta 50 put 'em in my fo'-five
And I ain't even got my feet wet yet

Man we strugglin, it's hard sometimes, but
Tomorrow's better than yesterday, uhh

[The Game]
I was, born in the slums, struggled from day one
Ray Charles vision, blinded by the light from the sun
No navigation, no sense of direction, darker complexion
Made it hard to live; dad, how you fathered your kids?

Stranded on the highway of life, left us out to die, left us out to dry
Shhhh, I'm still here, my mother's cries
Nigga no father figures make harder niggaz
Through the years, went to war with niggaz from what I saw in the picture

Now your son is bigger, 13, but just like you
Moms said I would grow up and be just like you
From what you did to my sister she disliked you
Sixteen, eleventh grade, look at me just like you

Gunnin for riches, runnin hoppin project fences
Street corners to Arizona, how I earn my digits
And I'm far from finished, gamin 'til my coffee diminish
Why pray for the afterlife when mines just beginnin, huh

[The Game]
Only son by our mother, no brothers, only sisters by this one
Every time I kissed one I missed one, let me explain
Eight years before the game, everything came with pain

Watch the fate of my family slain would never see good times a-gayn
Cursed with pain by a nigga with no shame
My father, that have the same name as his father
My grandfather wouldn't believe, he pulled up our family tree

I can see him rollin over in his coffin
I'm left with often, thoughts of how could you molest your daughter
They say that's ten times worse than manslaughter
Man you ought of, be dead in a grave

But it wasn't my call, so instead you sat in a cage
High-powered, two-hundred and fifty pound, six-five coward
Would of been dead in an hour
Heard you was scared to take a shower, scared of the yard
Your end is near, you shoulda been scared of God, motherfucker

All my niggaz listen, huh
I stay a step ahead of the rest of y'all
Why I gotta keep a vest for y'all
Though I made it dog I still stress for y'all
Funny how my folks think rap money stretch so far

Pray to God my niggaz see through all the checks and the cars
I'm tryin to invest in what's ours, gimme a couple of years dog
I'll turn your tears stress and your scars
Into lawn chairs and green grass in your yard

I'm tryin to watch my kids wrestlin yours
Not have to get 'em ready for school and strap a vest on 'em all
I know sometimes it get hard
Keep your head up mami, reach for the stars

Havin a child is like a blessing from God
You just gotta work hard, can't let your youngest star strip in that bar
I feel your pain, this shit is rippin my heart
But where and when do we start, listen to the voice in back of my mind

Can't reach all my women so I attack it in rhyme

I know you a snitch, I can see it in your eyes
Shackled up, D.O.C.'s, all my niggaz on that ride
You can, stunt if you wanna, Chip is a gunner
Been reignin/rainin since ninety-six now it's time for the thunder

[Verse Two: Nina B]
In your mind you can blame me but open your mouth and name me
I'm runnin you out of office you're softer than Bush and Cheney
Go 'head, and try to play me I do you like I was Amy Fisher
Smokin a Swisher like I wish a bitch would
Listen and use your vision cause livin in this - hood
And sinnin in your division you think it's all - good
Got niggaz on (Death Row) and it ain't about Suge
Niggaz that stay home they scared to come out shook
Mothers with five kids and all of 'em got took
It's right in these niggaz face, but they just will not look
I'm tired, of the B.S. I'm cheatin {?} some rejects
Even though we make the best of what little respect, we get
This is the life, that was given to me
A rich-ass bitch that's what I'm fittin to be
Brooklyn to Bangkok I'm beggin to be
And don't nobody write, what I'm spittin but me
Nina be

We 'bout to blow this bitch

Bust yo' shit nigga, put them guns down
Put yo' knuckles up, catch you slippin dawg
That's how we do it independent now we 'bout to ball

[Verse Three]
For years niggaz sold me dreams that got me gassed
Made me want to get revenge or get the hockey mask
Got beef? Yo the burner's in the lobby stashed
Get your crew if you want, all them niggaz is probably ass
I take the long way, fuck takin the shortcut
Now we got corporate sponsorships wrappin our tour bus
A quick 32, yo them shits is like warmups
It ain't coincidental in the hood we was born tough
You chump or get chumped, punk or get punked
Save your lil' craps homey, fuck it get drunk
Was one at the top, but now I'm back at the bottom
Most 'em hate to spit with me cause when I rap I surprise 'em
Shit is real, that's why I stay strapped with a condom
I keep 31 flavors just like Baskin & Robbins
I'm here now, y'all supposed to be stressed, scared to death
That you gonna be next, record labels, promote the rejects
While starvin artists is closest to sets
And certain niggaz duckin me because they owe me a check
I spit more heat, than a bowl of chili, y'all niggaz know the deally
So turn the music up and roll a Philly

[Verse Four: JT]
Yeah, roll the Philly or Swisher Sweet
And I ain't trippin while you niggaz just stand on your feet
Figgaro done walked in the building, it's time to expand
Comin with hundreds of grands and hundreds of plans
You see this Black Wall Street is for the po' broke and hongry
None of my niggaz on the corner never be lonely
Stuck in the gutter mayne, coke packs like Tony
Bricks and pounds of weed half the city owe me
My shipment too big, frontin out the homies
I ain't even trippin mayne my pockets never lonely
Benjamin Franklins and Grants stick together like
Boys in tough weather makin noise forever, ahhhh

Eleven years old real life no goals,
Sneaking little sips in the cut,
Before they even called me Kurupt, 
Ridin' down the block so Ima tell you how I grew up,
I was always in the mix, too young for sticks
Ty tell em about that Watts experience

In Watts, a nigga couldn't wait for the summer time
Back yard barbecue yea that'll free your mind, 
We stayed fallin' of them ice cream trucks,
All my niggas nickel baging it and hustling bucks,
You could catch me in the middle of the streets 
Slap boxing with my nigga Porky,
And as I take you down my memory lane 
I'm reminiscin bout my ghetto dayz

I'm on the road gettin' my money up
And I remember all the young soldiers in the hood
Tryin' to gang bang slingin' nickel bags
Screamin' money ain't a thing, for real
I know exactly how y'all feel
I'm reppin' black and brown pride
West Side til I die

I got a lot of rider in me
I was thinkin', couple years older
Fourteen smokin' and drinkin'
Thinkin' bout uncle Jame's army
The old folks love it
I'm just gettin' up in the game
And gang bang bubbly
Crinshaws crackin, durin' the day got schwinns
On Sunday's watchin' all the big homies spin
I won't dance
'Cause thats all I see
That's like the army
That's all you can be

I used to love feedin' polices and cheap coast
Watch me jump up in the push
And play hide and go get it I'm wit it
And all the hoodrats used to hold us down on the block

Ran til my And 1's had holes in the soles
I had 3 silk shirts, 2 pairs of jebose
Spent the night at boo's house, we was sharin' his clothes
Moms left me out in the cold
Worst that that my man took 5 shots and ain't lose his soul
I was livin with a blind man's vision
And no matter how hard I tried, I could never see prison
And to all my dead homies, we don't pour rout liquor
We just poke our chests out, and say we miss ya niggas
We was scared of gang bangers, walked to school in groups
Argued who was the best MC, Ice Cube or Snoop
Damn, I miss my ghetto dayz

I was 12 smokin' chronic, in '92
I had a choice, be like Mike, or be like you
I made a choice, now its be Crip or be Piru

I told you you was like a father to me I meant that

But he a hard-head Dre thats why I'm talkin' to you
See when I first met my nigga son was layin' in the cut
Tight, reserve, homie was quiet and kept his mouth shut
Until you told him to spit for me, he flippin' from the gut
I dug his spirit, and I thought the dude was talented as fuck
And as the time went on, now he was workin' with the finest
I saw the pressure started to build, so I gave 'em additional guidance
You gave him something that can make or break a nigga you should face it
So big, I don't even think he was ready to embrace it
With the potential to be a strong nigga with conviction
The only problem was our little nigga wouldn't listen
But when Doc say its a rap, its a rap
Its still Aftermath and ain't nothing after that

Black T-shirt, so all you see is the A
Turn on the TV, and all you see is the A
You niggas better make up a dance and try to get radio play
Keep on snapping your fingers, I ain't going away
I don't regret what I spit, cause I know what I say
And niggas talking about me, they don't know when to stop
I got the Louis Vuitton belt buckle holding the Glock
No beam, no silencer - I know when to pop
Wait till Lil Jon come on and let off a shot
I have the number one billboard spot
Niggas stepped on my fingers, and I climb right back to the top
I'm B.I.G, I'm Cube, I'm Nas, I'm Pac
This ain't shit but a warning till my album drop

Shit, let the chronic burn as the Daytons spin
It ain’t been this much drama since I first heard Eminem
In the club, poppin' X pills like M & Ms

You take a picture with him, and you gotta fuck me

Got something in my waist that you can’t touch either

I’m in the club on some gangsta shit

Light another dub
Bitches get scared when niggas start fighting in the club

You passed me the torch, I lit the chronic with it, now the world is my ashtray
Ridin' three-wheel motion ‘till the ass scrapes

Guess who's back on the West coast tracks
It's the motherfucking messiah of gangsta rap
Still dip in the six-fo', still puffin on the same chronic
Haters mad cause I still got it
I never fall off, even without the Doc
You niggas sellin your soul trying to stay on top
Bitch nigga check your Kotex
You niggas ain't moving shit like the hand on a fake-ass Rolex

Most loved and the motherfucking most hated

You gotta deal with me, I'm the West Coast savior
Niggas think of me every time they six-fo' scraper

What do you call a nigga who's overbearing
Belligerent, foul, defiant and very disrespectful?
You call that nigga the Doctor's Advocate
He's a reflection of Dr. Dre in his heyday in the worst way
The five star surgeon general
Took Jayceon to the Aftermath research department
And gave him a blood test
It came back G-A-M-E positive
The nigga's infected with the Game virus
His oratorical skills are so impeccable
That niggas in the streets call him Cyrus
The young damu's down with violence
Cause in his heart he's a tyrant
It's not a game, it's just called The Game
There'll be no referees, no halftime reports
When the game is over, The Game is over

Left for dead, you know who to thank for that
Finished my second LP without a Dr. Dre track
You can take my soul but can't take my plaques
I'm the motherfucking snare when it touch the beat
I'm the 808 drum that got you movin your feet
I'm the heir to the throne after the D-R-E
Product of my environment, you old-ass niggas
Get ready for your early retirement
Before I let hip-hop burn down I run in the building like a fireman
Who can outspit me when I'm high off sticky
Throwing back Patron shots in some creased up dickies
I'm D.O.C. certified, Ice Cube lynch'd me
Snoop stamped me and the good Doc handpicked me
You still with me?

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time in the projects yo
I watched my uncle Greg put D's on his six-fo'
I washed it on Monday so he bought me a gold chain
Shopped crack and watched ""Colors"" and I soaked up game
Drove the Impala on his lap that was my role model
Used to let me kill the corner of his 40-ounce bottle
On the weekend him and my pops flashed the 'Vette
Till one weekend my uncle got stabbed to death
He got murdered by a fiend my pops ain't like that
He was from Nutty Block they used to call him Maniac
Crazy ass nigga wit' a Black Panther tat
Kill a nigga cross him out on his Compton hat
Told me when I got older I would understand that
It's blood in blood out and ain't no turnin' back
Few summers went by and we moved across the tracks
13 that's when I had my first

[Verse 2]
I was the first nigga wit' a Starter jacket on the block
Used to build model cars and let the motherfuckers hop
Moms banged Hoover Crip she was known for sellin' rocks
Let me collect the 40-ounce bottles in the dope spot
Bought my first Converse thought I couldn't be stopped
When I creased up my khakis and threw on my Ronnie Lott
Used to think that I was hard so I stole my brother's glock
And that's the day my life changed 'cause that night he got shot
Killed by another crip over his Rolex watch
I got high for three years off that Chronic from the Doc
I was drinkin' 40-ounces a lot
And every liquor store in Compton sold out the day Eazy dropped
I start bangin' red laces in my adidas
Drinkin' out a brown paper bag on my first drive-by
I was a menace to society
But I never left fingerprints on my

I got a lot of dead homies some blood some crip
This is life stop watchin' that ""Boyz N The Hood"" shit
You see this red rag hangin' out of my jeans?
I went to twenty funerals by the age of nineteen
Then I went to college basketball was my dream
Quit the team 'cause I rather shoot rock wit' the fiends
Wanted to be Freeway Rick
He showed me how to turn a stolen 5.0 into a brick
Bought a Cadillac thought I was rich bangin' DJ Quik
On Crenshaw got jacked for my shit
Took a long chronic hit and thought about the time
When I was 12 years old and I emptied my first clip
Hit my first switch same night fucked my first bitch
Thought I was dreamin' till I pinched her tits
She caught a stray bullet ridin' shotgun in my shit
So I got her name tatted in

When I'm drunk, when I'm high
I will be broke, if I would be with you
That is why it's for one night (one one one one)

I'm a motherfuckin' gang bangin' nightmare
Wake up motherfuckers, I traded in my white Nike Airs
For a red pair of converse, Back to the hood
My own niggas actin' like I turned my back on the hood
I used my rap money to put crack in the hood
Even brought the nigga Dr. Dre back to the hood
I show niggas the Bentley, then let you drive it
Gone for 2 days and I didn't even check the mileage
When we was fighting with Crips it wasn't bout no dollars
It was about selling dope to put our kids through college
I'm sittin' on the block reminiscing for hours
Whipping my tears cause now half of my niggas is cowards
And I was still fuckin' with niggas
After I got shot and didn't get one hospital visit
My homie Snoop told me it be days like this
It hurt my heart to say this shit

Red bandanna in my back pocket I'm for real
This ain't no pastel color khaki suit and I ain't Pharrell
I don't front bout shit, I pull my gun bout shit
And let everything fly to keep my son up out of this
I thought you loved me nigga, talk is cheap
Remember, the bullet holes in my son's car seat
My baby momma found four shells
I ain't get one keep your head up
All I got was keep it real, Keep it real my niggas?
Last year alone I spent 1.5 mil on my niggas
After the bullshit I stayed right there
Took you to award shows there go Jay right there
""Where?"" ""Right there""
I had you niggas in suits, cleaner than a pair of fresh Nike Airs
I'm suppose to enjoy this shit but it's quite clear
The last 12 months been a fuckin' nightmare

This shit is worst then arguing with my bitch
I done been through more up and downs then an Impala switch
Get your hand out of my pocket nigga, go fish
I was born by myself so I don't owe yall shit
Nigga you tell me, what you want me to do
Drop my son off at home and come bang with you?
Oh now it's fuck Game, Naw Nigga fuck you
I put that on my life, matter of fact that's on Piru
And really is I can die too
And end up in the cemetery, right beside you
We can both ride, Angels flying over my head stone
But the devils inside your box
You wanted my shine so I gave you ice
Then I gave you a second change and you played me twice
Couldn't be a real homeboy to save your life
I should of took Dr.Dre's advise

Felon, fights behind me on the intersection
Sex and drugs my anthology on perfection
Dress superb admired by conspirists
Who wanna try me but ain't high enough to 4-5 me up
Child of the 80s, y'all niggas is lazy
Complainin' 'bout labor pains nigga show me the baby
And my nigga Game light another L pass the bottle
Pro-black I don't pick cotton out a aspirin bottle
Yeah I learned my lessons and heard y'all snitchin'
Witnessin' you rockin' with narcs confirmed my suspicion
Green fatigues on my niggas I'll bleed for 'em
I can show 'em the water but can't make 'em drink it
And I can show them my fortunes but can't force 'em think rich
And still I'm out on the boarder wonderin' if they sink quick
Ignore the ignorance I rep the brilliance of Queensbridge
And pray the feds let Murder Inc. live

To everybody who knows my story
To all of those who came before me
My time is now I'm gon' do it all over again (so how?)

'Pac is watchin' B.I.G. is listenin'
While Pun talkin' to us Jam Jay still spinnin'
To every nigga listenin' I was supposed to be
Amongst kings my mom shouted out at my christenin'
And while you still listenin' Shyne locked in a manhole
And Cam got shot inside his Lambo it's ample
Life is a gamble, 15 years old red rag around my head
My sisters used to laugh and call me Rambo
Seen Eazy's legacy melt away like a candle
I rekindle the flame Dre created The Game
Nigga Wit a Attitude from the cloth I came
Young homie ate his way up from the bottom of the food chain
Keep the crown clown I rock a L.A. Dodger fitted
Showed my ass at Summer Jam but New York was down wit' it
Now the ball's in my court never dribble out of bounds wit' it
Behind the back to Nas he alley oop to Jigga nigga

How he gon' pass the dutchie to them niggas that don't love me
I'm talkin' niggas that never wanted to see me on top
Same niggas that never wanted to see The Doctor's Advocate drop
Flop I think not, I fuck you rap niggas like virgins
Dre took my trainin' wheels off it's curtains
I don't need no encore no claps no cheers
The Game ain't over this the beginning of my career
The endin' of yours the endin' of his
Like Flavor Flav's clock I'm back to handle my biz
Nigga it's Game time that was Dre's favorite line
Back when Proof was in the booth and I recited his lines
And I still think about my nigga from time to time
Make me wanna call 50 and let him know what's on my mind
But I just hold back 'cause we ain't beefin' like that
He ain't B.I.G. and I ain't 'Pac we just eatin' off rap
One love

Been around hoes that fucked Biggie and 'Pac
Like Vida Guerra, ass took her to the top
She'll give you some brain, you let her throw up the Roc
Let her put on your chain, she'll throw you some cot
Picture that, like Meagan Good and Jamie Foxx
Hype said it's a wrap, she still on the set
Puttin' oil on her legs like she Gloria Velez
She was Eye Candy in the XXL
Hopped off the page and on a skateboard with Pharrell
I knew she wouldn't get far cause five hundred dollars
Can't get you that far, how you get that far
And all these new video bitches tryin to be Melyssa Ford
But they don't know Melyssa Ford drive a Honda Accord
She a video vixen, but behind closed doors
She do whatever it take to get to the Grammy Awards, ha ha

You wouldn't get far, fuckin' them rap stars
You know who you are, put your hands up ladies
You wouldn't get far, if you kept your legs closed
It would be just a waste of time
But you know, you wouldn't get far, fuckin' them rap stars
You know who you are, I wrote this song for you
For you baby, I'd find you, for you and you, for all y'all

Did I have under my belt, like boxers
Not to brag but, if it add up
One, two, nigga that's mad nuts
Game you mad nuts, how you gon' call out all these
Bitches knowin' damn well they gon' call me
The only dream, of that ghetto prom queen
Was to make it to the screen, maybe get seen
Maybe get chose by a nigga from my team
Head so good he don't ask for a pre---nup
Now ask yourself this question, umm
Would you be with Jay-Z if he wasn't C-E-O
Would you be with F-A-B-O if he drove a Neo
Would you ride with Ne-Yo, if he was in a Geo
Well why the hell you think these bitches comin' at me fo'
But since they all fall in my Palm, I take a trio, yo

You wouldn't get far, if you kept your legs closed

You know who you are, I wrote this song for you
For you baby, I'd find you, for you and you, for all y'all

I done had my share of bitches with long hair
Short do like Kelis or Halle in Boomerang, yeah
I been around the block in the Bentley drop top
In Miami Beach when Lil' Kim was fuckin with Scott
I got the scoop on Hoops, whatever the case
She'll let you spray in her face long as she Bathing Apes
And ain't nobody tryin' to take Beyonce from Jay
But I know a bitch named Superhead he fucked back in the day
The things niggas do when pussy sittin' on they face
Stabbed Un in the stomach
She must have had a pussy like Wonder Woman, on that superhero shit
Fly as Gabrielle Union in the back of my six, fo'
Impala, forget the double D's
I put 'em right in your face like that model bitch Toccara
And she ain't win the show but she ridin' in that Gallardo
That's why I fuck 'em today and forget 'em tomorrow

I'm sittin' back watchin' Kanye video
And I see the same bitch that was in the homeboy Busta Rhymes video
Then I flip the muh'fuckin channel
Checkin' out my uncle Snoop Dogg video
And I see the same bitch, that was in my video
You know what I'm sayin'
And then y'knahmsayin, to make that even mo' fucked up
I'm watchin Oprah cover Hurricane Katrina

Guess who's back in a son of a bitch
Underground king with a gun on his hip
Not the UGK like bun be	 and pimp see
But I gotta go shoot a bucket in my bently
Ain't shit changed with the guts in a range
And no more Lloyd Banks,Tony Yayo and Young Buck in my lane
I'm a hood nigga for real mothafuck the fame
Nigga I'ma get mine
You can hate it or love it but it's a thin line
Between G Unot and G Unit
Nigga talk shit catch one in the hip
Fuck beefin the rhyme
50 forgot about his but I took mine
I showed you all 5 but he never took 9
He rap like Trina blah blah blah
Ok, shut up 
Let us see the wound
Show it to the world
He got shot in the mouth and cried like a girl 
You cried like a girl
And I gangbang so hard it'll bring back curls
I'm tellin' your fan don't believe that shit
Tryna beef with The Game like he that sick
You movie was trash and I went to see that shit
With a camera and got it on DVD that quick
Chicken Little and Harry Potter

Tha King been the one representing all of Atlanta's zones

Back when niggas was representing Atlanta wrong
Every shot he got, he put the hoods of Atlanta on
The big screen then hit every trap and traveled on
Past, present to Texas to Alabama strong

Down in Miami, up to Louisiana homes
From the Carolinas, Virginia to David Banner's home
I'm well connected, haters, best to mind ya manners homes
I got a nickel-plated 38 but hey, the hammer chrome

And it shine like ya should set the phantom on
In it see me riding, getting blown like the saxophone
Hey shawty, spit the shit, it takes to cut a candle on
If I ain't on ya tube, dude, you must got ya channel wrong

Dead niggas like the bitches from 'Monster'

Now you been told so don't say I ain't warned ya
And don't let it alarm ya when ya leaking then the reapers upon ya
Speak on me and I'm creepin' upon ya, say that I ain't tha King
But you just sour, you ain't think of it aren't ya

All the hating, is no time to respond, I miss tryin' to conjure up
A way to get experience and launder
Hey, I thought ya record company conned ya
Into signing a deal, shy of a mill 'cause they really ain't want ya

Moving yay, it's safe to say that they own to ya
So it's time to move on to real estate
And get cake selling big estates

I'ma spread out and I'll eliminate, who in the way?

I'll be ruler of all that I survey and not just in the state

You gone ride or die?

Woo
Woo

All my niggas gone bust they guns
Real mother fuckers never trust niggas, but we trust our guns
Get money is the code of the streets
Live by it, and they say the hotter the bullets, the colder the streets
Like the older the hammer, the older the beef
You holding the can and you busting or you die with your heat
Me and my niggas gone survive in the street
For one reason, we ain't living to kill niggas, just dieing to sleep
I'm in the hood and I ain't wear a vest
Push a stock GTO, with a pump in the seat and a desert eagle in the head rest
Live and I took 5, get respect cause I wont die
So its a bet that I'm gone ride

[Chorus: x2]
I'm riding dog, you riding with me? (ride with me)
If I'm frying dog, you frying with me? (fry with me)
If I'm dieing dog, you dieing with me? (die with me)
Just know when the beef come, we all busting our guns (what?)

We can beef, I don't give a fuck, any street, stoop or block
Compton, New York City of Rocks
You ain't never been out the hood? don't go to far
12 gauge shotty, with a pump like Joe Dumar's
Shells the size of Sprewell lugs, go through cars
Rip apart your new Bentley nigga, like Dre sent me
The haze in me make me wanna kick back
Your man work out at bally's, put the 38 to a 6 pack
And beef keep the E.R full til the shit packed
No more rooms? let em die in the streets
Im from the CPT, where niggas dieing to eat
Them niggas with scars under they left eye and they cheek
Park a 745 on your street
Like mother fucker if you don't ride with me, you can die with the enemy
Or die like the Kennedy's nigga
I empty desert clips out like a bottle of Hennessy nigga

[Chorus: x2]

I got niggas that'll beef for the game
Run up on your man, splat his brain then bring you his chain
So if you owe my hood, you better pay up
I roll with killas, that'll put you in a hole like a lay up
Ain't no sleep on the block, my niggas stay up
Cause they ain't trying to miss sales
They trying to tip over fish scales
Be in the XXL, and its only 6 street rappers if you wanna be real
That go for the whole industry you bitch ass niggas
Say my name in a verse if you ready to die
I call up my Harlem niggas on the i95
10 minutes later you dead on the I95
Aftermath mother fucker, we ain't playing this shit
50, work ride, Joe, Cube, the Game and Em
Its our house and we in the front yard

My girlfriend she wasn't hesitating she blowing up my phone ever second we was hanging..
She so inpatient she's on probation I swear to god man I love my baby,
But I always spend my time hanging out sawp chilling with this hoe in the Bronx digging her out.
Fucked her in the kitchen, hit it on the couch, I can't forget to mention I put it in her mouth.
And now it's a long ride home I know I was so damn wrong... but dam I had so much fun.
My girl kept calling my phone I'm thinking about what I've done.

Dam I can't believe I...dam I can't believe I... dam I can't believe I... dam I can't believe I cheated on my woman with a girl from the Bronx

The next day I thought shit was all over but my girlfriend giving me the cold shoulder said she found some empty condom rappers in the rova, now she throwin fits telling me to go,
Crying in the bed room burning all my cloths taking all my shoes and put 'em on the stove all in the kitchen looks like a furnace...
Ten minutes later whole house burning, and now you see me in a robe running out and you can here the police coming without a doubt.
The cops saw us fussing my girl was tripping hard, they locked me up in handcuffs threw me in the car, and now I know that
It's over I called her over and over she won't answer my call's I thought my pimping days were over, I stood up only to fall.

[Verse 1]
Kanye told me that Jesus walks in '04
But I grew up around impalas and drug lords
Welcome to Los Angeles palm trees and drug stores
All we know is rocks and presidents like Mount Rushmore
Fuck the police they hop out and bust doors
I ain't goin' back to jail nigga that what I flush for
My money or my glock who do I trust more?
I don't know it's probably the one that I touch more
Guess it's the green cause paper motivate niggas
And my Rolex races cause it hate niggas
I use to only sell 8s like that Laker nigga
Now I'm movin' 24s like I play at the staples center
You might miss the game so nigga don't blink
My phantom stand out like Frank Lucas mink
So go ahead and think like Frank Lucas think
Somebody'll find your brains on the fuckin' kitchen sink about

Yeah Yeah
I get it that baby and slim cash money
All the jewelry on your whole crew that's my tax money
That Pablo Escobar crack money
That Lebron first nike contract money
That make it rain all my niggas throw a stack money
Stack it to the ceiling then call it Shaq money
That walk in the club, straight to the back money
Flavor of love delicious sittin' on my lap money
That rat money niggas get clapped money
Air force ones don't bend when I track money
Oh I'm rich like porter,
Havin' Alpo nightmares whippin' that border
Like McDonald's I was flippin' them orders
In that '02 Porsche truck weavin' through borders
I was through flippin' quarters When I made my first mil
I'm about a dollar 50 cent ain't real

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Ooh Somebody tell snoop to pop open them briefcases
Order that patron tell em we want 3 cases
Fuck a black card you see these green faces
Look at my chest, now you've seen Vegas
Treat my money like the Crystal that we wastin'
Cause I'm a money machine I can re-make it
You a fool thinkin' that Freddy can see Jason
I been iced out like who the fuck need Jacob
The doc told me to be patient but I walked
Money like the white Howard next time he a free agent
I'm tryin' to make enough money so I can feed Asia
Have Asians in the kitchen cookin' in Louis V aprons
Word to Martha Stewart if I can park a Buick
Then I can flip a breech truck I got the heart to do it
Ball like the nigga Tony Parker do it
Speak no englis but Dinero I talk it fluent

JUST BLAZE!

Gangsta gangsta, that's already evident
Nigga Witta Attitude, check check my residence
Whether I'm Crip or Blood, homey that's irrelevant
I with the D.O.C., there's nobody better than
The West coast felon when he on that lowrider bike pedallin
Somebody tell Eazy they still yellin it
I'm wit'cha homey Doc Dre on the television
While these niggas movin peanuts like a elephant
I move cars like spinnin rims
I'm in a class all by myself like the brown Eminem
Not to down Eminem, I fuck black bitches
Fuck white bitches, nigga I like bitches
Them half-and-half Alicia Keys dyke bitches
If the head right I might Air Nike bitches
Or put 'em on the track like Just Blaze
I look down on hoes and look up to Dre
Cause ain't (""No more fun and games!"")

I'm like Dre, Eazy, Cube, King Tee and Ren rolled in one
Used to move birdies 'til I put a hole in one
Nigga that thought I wasn't holdin a gun
And tried to ride up on me like Afeni Shakur's only son
Dre told me he ain't doin Detox, this his only run
Mase comin back, and Hov, he done
I'm surrounded by legends, sittin at the round table
I am The Game, and still niggas tryin to play dude
I'm ruthless, I ain't talkin 'bout the label
I'll hook niggas up, and I don't mean free cable
I mean I'll hook niggas up to them IV's
The same way Dre hooked me up to Iovine
I'm from the gutter, grew up in public housing
On the same block with a shack like Yao Ming
So if a nigga ever try to Jerry Heller me
Tell Dre put up a mill, cause that's what my bail'll be

Gangsta, gangsta! (""That's what they're yellin"")

I've been rappin for one year, one month, 17 days
13 hours, 28 minutes, then I met Dre
30 minutes after I bought the new Em
That was November 18th, 3:09 PM
Around the same time, ""Wanksta"" got it's first spin
That was 32 weeks before they signed Rakim
Eight months, 13 days before I knew where Mike lived
And three years after Mason Betha turned his mic in
I started writin 22 months and 20 weeks prior
To LeBron shakin Adidas for Nikes
I'm right here, six years after Randy Moss
Caught his first touchdown for them Vikings
Just one day, seven hours, 14 minutes
21 seconds before SoundScan got printed
Two platinum records 'fore I'm classified with Biggie
And two seconds before the song finish, yeah",No More Fun and Games,2008

Walk through 8 Mile, G-Unit's on my feet
Got a cherry lowrider in the N-Y-C
Eve took me to Philly, never been to the pen
Been to Uptown with 50, seen niggas in Timbs
I done seen Young Buck scuff Air Force Ones
In Cashville, but Compton is {where I'm from}
Where it's just me, my son, and my bitch
She graduated when Notorious BIG dropped ""Me & My Bitch""
She get them birds past, I put her in first class
And tell her to carry on that Dooney & Burke bag
She from Grape Street, she know how to work the mag
And only buy white tees, tell 'em to keep the purple tags
Cause the laces in my Chucks keep the beef crackin
I lay niggas out like creased khakis
In that G-wagon, lean like the 23's draggin
I got the whole N-Y-C saggin

Flyin' through the city with the pedal to the floor then
I put them 26 inches on the curb, tell the hood I'm back
Give me a corner, let me serve

Swerve, I'm still dope that's my word
All I did was the switch the kitchens, did some tracks on the birds

I get money like Junior Mafia used to
On my way to school ten thousand in my FUBU
Lunchtime, I was sellin' behind the bungalows
Baggin' up rocks the size of melons

That's when the fiends start tellin'
You can catch 'em on the couch everyday at 4 o'clock like Ellen
Prime-time, nigga, it's my time, nigga
Jacob ain't got shit to do with my shine, nigga

?Cause when the sun come up from behind the sea
Niggas see me behind the be
E N T, don't stand for entertainment
Stands for 0 to 60, anybody see where Game went?

To the hood, parked crooked behind that chained fence
And I'm going down behind my dogs, but I ain't Vick
Tell me one album I put out that ain't sick?
No, I'm not the Doctor but I produce the same shit

Wave my red rag in the air, signal Lil' Wayne over

The pills start droppin' and the haters start watchin'

Game,"I spent my day so, first I pray yo
Then I lay low, looking for the halo
Or more yayo, my little angel
Reminded me to stay playful
Faithful walks I take in the woods
Thinking whats good, things that I can change I should
Things I can't, need to be understood
Th-this is the bliss, I used to drift from the hood
For a second at least, I'm resurrecting the peace
Pipes that Indians used to light, we called it Chief, right?
Stepping on the leafs right, to reach heights
Th-th-th-that I never seen, it's so so evergreen
Some use it for medicine, or to write better things
I was in Amsterdam man, bike pedalling
To the nature spot to taste the flavours they got
My eyes drop, I like it a lot
Yeah, my angel

I wanna turn up the sound and spread
my wings because I'm riding with my (Angel)
Going through the city of the Chi
make me feel like I'm in the city of (Angels)
Oooh I wanna fly, fly away with my (Angel)
She takes me high, she will always be my (Angel)

Th-th-the way that I rhyme, blow nigga's mind
Like the first time you heard Mary J and you were standing in line
To purchase tickets to see her blow like Chicago wind
And I'm ridin with Common looking for Chicago Zen
And like Chicago winds, I was once a Street Disciple
Rockin every Jordan shoe, Nike put out by Michael
That made me feel like I could fly, sometimes I wanted to die
Prolly cause the angel dust was fuckin with my third eye
So I start hip-hop and I understand why Common used to love her
She got me open so I even had to fuck her
But I used the rubber, cause she was married to Rakim
So I bought me a gold chain, pretendin' that I was him
So I can get close to the girl I loved the most
But she left Cali and went on tour with Ne-Yo and Ghost
Big gave her one more chance, and she took Big down
I should've knew it, Shock G and Pac told me ""She get around"", an angel

I wanna turn up the sound and spread
my wings because I'm riding with my (Angel)
Going through the city of the Chi
make me feel like I'm in the city of (Angels)
Oooh I wanna fly, fly away with my (Angel)
She takes me high, she will always be my (Angel)

Fly away, fly away
My love for her is not about jewelry and cars
I love her cause she love me, just for who I are
Who I is, who I am, resembles the rims on the Lam'
I shine like Shyne when Barrington Levy was sayin, ""Didilly whoooa!""
I got love for the streets, peace to New York and every hood in the East
Before I was duckin' cops, gunshots
I used to be an L.A. Dodger, now I'm a (Angel)
From the city of lost souls, Impalas and polished gold
Between the car, and the rims, we got a lot of chrome
Your hood not alone, they knockin, we not at home
And when they bust in, we not Caesar, but gotta roam
Cause they try to wire phones, I'm talking Verizon phones
The ones they put wires on, they got us on tap
But I put wires on, my Bentley in fact
I spit it through the wires on a Kanye track

I wanna turn up the sound and spread
my wings because I'm riding with my (Angel)
Going through the city of the Chi
make me feel like I'm in the city of (Angels)
Oooh I wanna fly, fly away with my (Angel)
She takes me high, she will always be my (Angel)

Yeah, it's The Game and Common
Spread your wings, follow your dreams
Things will be so serene, L.A. and the Chi is a team
Yeah, angel supreme
Yeah, keep on

Last year, Jazze Phe got stuck up inside the grand Lux,
Most recent was 50 in Angola, that's what's up,
Any rapper could touched, any bitch could get fucked,
Under the California sun, impalas and big trucks,
They say Suge got knocked out, but don't play that nigga cheap,
Cause you're body might wash up by the courts at Venice Beach,
Ain't shit sweet but my Swisher, ain't shit buzzin' but my liquor,
Cali chickens got to the 80's strip and come back a little thicker,
With more ass then Delicious, that's my flavor of love,
We make it rain like Rain-man, when he play with the glove,
I'm the king to you pawn niggas, punisher, spawn, niggas,
Playin' in green, Paul Pierce to you Lebron niggas,

We drink Kool-Aid with the ice on your arm nigga,

I'm in my drop top Phantom, down Wilshire boulevard,
We can't find Biggies killers so we gave Diddy a star,
And I'm by far, Hollywood boulevard,
But I'm from a boulevard that taught yall to shoot out of moving cars,
Remember, New Jersey driver's like a East Coast menace,
And Belly was like the sequel without O-Dogg in it,
Give me a New York minute,
To show you Cali got more dead bodies then the Yankees got New York pennants,
Cause we Dodgers and Impalas with the windows tinted,
I duck shots where Venus and Sarena used to play tennis,
And they never came back, like throwin' a boomerang flat,
See me, I'm posted like a Cincinnati pitcher in the same hat,
It's like a scene from a movie, when the screen fade black,
Niggas roll up on you, Now you stuck in that Harold and Cane trap,
If you slippin' in Hollywood, and you get your chain snatched,
I know some niggas that know some niggas, I'll get your chain back.

Niggas already know who had the marijuana first,
We birthed haze and sour diesel, I was there when the water burst,
Hell nah we don't surf, We half way go to church,
Tell you the truth, shit, right now I'm in the fuckin' hearse,
And it ain't my night to get buried in the dirt
But it is your day to get buried by a verse,
It'll be another ten years before you see an MC Ren here,
Where he been, I been there, that Lambo, I'm in there,
Hotter then the beginning of my career with 50, Dre and Em there,
Top off the Murcialago like Victoria's Secret swim swear,
So listen, I'm so sincere, bout to work out like gym wear,
Murder MTV's top ten, and tat my face with 10 tears,
That's 10 funerals, 10 caskets,
10 3-piece Ralph Lauren suits, 10 motorbikes stopping traffic,
And 10 reasons why I got California hotter than acid,

Game,"[Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
See, ever since the day I got the chance to make a change
I've been in this game, it's a new day
And I'm making it known cause I just want the world to know
I'm paying my dues, and I got the utmost, I just wanna let you know
I'm payin' homage 'cause you've paved the way for me, yeah

[Verse 1: The Game]
I swear to God, it feel like every day is my birthday
Let the top down, California's my birthplace
So I'ma take you there like B.I.G took niggas to New York
""Juicy"" had us feeling like we was from New York
And that's real shit blazed the Philly
It's summertime shout out to Will Smith
Cause who didn't wanna be the Fresh Prince
Flat top, gold chain and some fresh kicks?
My nigga Nas told me money make the world go round
And Uncle Luke showed me how to make my girl go down
I've been around Hip Hop since '85
She had her ups and downs but she stayed alive
I used to think LL stood for Love LA
He from Queens, how the fuck he put that with Cool J?
Red Kangol hat, red sweatsuit to match
Red Adidas, nigga, Game is back

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Public Enemy and N.W.A is on my boom box, had to say
Today was a good day, had the hood buzzin'
Ice Cube my favorite rapper, y'all niggas can't tell me nothin'
Everybody's first bootleg was Boyz 'n the Hood
Whoever thought gangsta rap would make noise in the hood
When the cars ride by with the boomin' system
Two door Mustang and the roof was missing
Every girl at ya school had the new extensions
Even gangstas was dancin' like New Edition
Cause the house parties stayed rockin' all night
Niggas came through and shot it up but it was alright
Cause after the cops left, it was a party then
You down with OPP, then bring Naughty in
They say it never rain in southern California, Tony Toni lied
Sit back, watch Game throw his money in the sky

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M get the money
In the back, I relax with all the honey's
DJ bring it back, let it go
Mix it in with Black Rob, make 'em say whoa!
Every thing full circle, Game livin' major
Girls on my hip like a Skytel pager
Now I'm on the top, let the champagne pop
Throw ya hands in the sky 'cause The Game don't stop
Just a little more change, gotta Benz and the Range
Every rap metaphor always ends in my name,
The Kool Hercs, DJ Red Alerts
Before I was born they was talking 'bout The Game
Ask a Jay-Z fan 'bout Big Daddy Kane
Don't know him, Game gonna show 'em
Just like they showed me, my lyrics is O.G
When it's all said and done, you niggas gon' quote me

This sex appeal
Can't be bought
It's not a skill

[Verse One: The Game]
Fuck this old nigga whistlin' for?
Outside my door apartment 5B
While I learn to cook my first ounce of raw
Use to whistle while I work
She whistle while she twirk
Bitch bounce that ass while you roll that blunt it can't hurt
While you wet come out of that skirt
Bend over make it squirt
You can be my Superhead maybe we should try that first
Let me whistle while you jerk
Run my hand up ya shirt
If you wit it say you wit it let me hear my birdies chirp (we like it!)
Back shots make a bitch go berserk
The game will make it hurt
T-Pain know I'ma flirt (and we love it!)
Get ya ass up and fuck me then
I know you brought your girls
Girl fuck ya friends
Matter of fact I wanna fuck ya friends
Nah I ain't mean it like that, shit

[Verse 2: Ne-Yo]
There's the door
Swags a standard
No less no more
If u have none
Let nezy know
Cause that's all they checkin' for
Flashin' paper
Player stop it
Swag is in you not in ya pocket
Try to buy
Ain't gone fly
Cause she want smooth
Gentleman life
She likes the way that everything
I do it so fresh and so clean
My tone is free no need to scream
Bounce like demeanor firmly

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: The Game]
Can't be about C-notes
She know my pockets deep enough to see a deep throat
But she won't see a dividend like 3 times ?
And that's triple X rated you know
My bitches only want the weed some X and some blow
Know not ask for the keys or no extra dough
I give em dick no dough
She give me shit she go
All she got was a baby and a Game logo
That was then this is now
Lift it up break it down
I go in she come out
That's when the pussy make the sound
It will never be the same
Every time when you fuck wit Game
Silk sheets long dick hot tub Lil Wayne
Like I ain't never ran from no pussy and I damn sure bout to pick a day to start runnin'
I said I ain't never ran from no pussy and I damn sure bout pick a day to start runnin'

Banging was the blueprint money was the master plan

Rob niggas take they money shoot straight to the bank then
Head to the barbershop to get chopped up
Hearing war stories who dead and who locked up
Who snitching, who pitching and who knocked up

Black hoodies and black Asics standing on the pavement
Hustlers don't sleep nigga we work the grave shift
Fuck that long money nigga get paid quick

If it don't make dollars it don't make sense
And I almost got shot because I hit a fence

Motherfuckers ain't gone learn,
Till the chronic blunt don't burn
And you can't see nuthin' but the ghetto bird light shinin'
Through the fuckin' palm trees,
California ain't a state it's a army

Motherfuckers ain't gone learn,
Till the chronic blunt don't burn
And you can't see nuthin' but the ghetto bird light shinin'
Through the fuckin' palm trees,
California ain't a state it's a army

Call the U.S. government and tell em it's a mutherfuckin' code red,
Niggas tried to straight up jack me and now they both dead
Third little nigga got away on his mo-ped
Caught him 'round the corner put the beam on his forehead
Jumped in the impala then smashed through the light
Without a one time in sight,
So I bust a right on Century headed to the L.A.X.
Where there ain't nothin' but fly bitches and checks
In and out of lanes and I almost wrecked
Off Brand a nigga in the 600 throwin up his set
He must don't know I got the 40 on deck
And the teck tryin' be Shot but it ain't time to flex
It's the third this shit happened to me all day
Guess it's time to add another dead body to the throw away
So I turned down my Spice 1 tape and hit the switch
Emptied the whole clip in his fuckin' face

Motherfuckers ain't gone learn,
Till the chronic blunt don't burn
And you can't see nuthin' but the ghetto bird light shinin'
Through the fuckin' palm trees,
California ain't a state it's a army

Motherfuckers ain't gone learn,

I think we got a problem, got a got a problem
Think we got a problem, think we got a problem

Think we got a problem, mask on, show you how to rob 'em
Revolver, show you how to solve'm
Drivin' down Harlem, the Aston a problem
No tint fishbowl it ain't hard to spot him
Think we got a problem, weed got too much
Only thing damn I'm down to my last dutch
Think we got a problem, but really it ain't dough
There's one of me, and these bitches I count about three four
Think we got a problem, the homey just all talk
He ain't gon' pop a balloon with a pitch fork
Think we got a problem in the club with this dogg
Rude boy, starks, ladies, everybody

[Chorus: ]

Think we got a problem, Game in Manhattan
Black on black Aston, the 21 strapped in
Dominican chick ridin' shotty all strapped in
Customize the dash on my shotgun strapped in
Cops on the shoulder gotta pull a Hova
Time to fade to black cause I ain't pullin' ova
The engine is a problem, that ain't no question
Pop the trunk see the speakers kickin' like Beckham

Think we got a problem, Sheek know I'm hot
Kiss and Styles should make me a member of the Lox
I take all the beats, I remember how to box
If I ever get knocked out, I remember how to pop
Remember how to load everything inside my glock
Ask the niggas in the hood 'cause they remember who I shot
Think we got a problem, I snitched on myself
And I hate rats so I dugg a ditch for myself, what

[Chorus: ]

Well it's the king of the trill Bun B'der you know the name
And the streets is like the NBA, I love this game
Keep a bottle of Henessey, a blunt and that purp
With my hand up on my heater, and my killaz on churp
You see me one deep in the spot, think I'm slippin', try ya luck
'Cause I got sixteen homeys with me, that stay ready to buck
You can duck dodge or dive, but it won't do diddley squat
But leave ya with a leaky liver and both ya kidneys shot
But you may not pimpin' I ain't fin to ask for it
My money, my hood or my respect, I'm a blast for it
You can't push fast forward, rewind or pause
I'm a beat you till you shittin' ya draws, so call the laws cause

[Chorus: ]",Think We Got a Problem,2008
Game,"[Chorus]
I'm doing everything I can to get my buzz on
Trying not to feel this pain no more
That's why I'm pooping these pills and smoking this dro
And drinking this Henney straight
Trying not to feel this pain no more

[Verse 1: E-40]
I came from the bottom of the barrel, to everyday new apparel
From a shoe string budget to more jewelry than a pharaoh
Up out a place called Vallejo, house smaller than a hut
First city in California to go bankrupt
Came a long way, let the truth be told
Penitentiary chances sweating over the stove
Seen them come and go, I'm the last of my crop
Don't compare me to nobody unless you're talking bout Pac
Just trying to survive and stay alive, so many of my people done died
Nowadays, you're an O.G. if you live to be 25
My partner in there with his grand-daddy doing 25
Lifting water bags, doing burpees exercise
I hand pick my friends cause people ain't trustable
Feelings like broads, their motives is questionable
Suckers sneak diss me and call me up on the phone
They say, ""40 Water, I just wanna be on""

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Game]
They say money makes the world go round
And since I'm worth twenty mil, I wanna see this bitch spin like the rims on a Schwinn
Hop on that bike, ride through the neighborhood
Compton on smash, them boys get Cash Money like Baby do
I got a scar over my heart, cause that's what hating'll do
So watch your back like a tattoo artist
A coffin don't fuck about who the hardest
You lay where the people who mourn pray
Get your name etched in stones with your born day
Small talk over a glass of Grand Marnier
As I sip from the glass, my mind starts packing this Louis Vuitton bag
Take a trip to the past, hear that shot going blast
See my brother lying dormant, IV's in his arms
Can't you see he got a piss bag
17 years old, and you niggas wonder why I'm so cold

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Let me get a fifth of some brandy, a plate of some candy
Cindy, Sandy, Mindy Mandy
Tina, Brandy, Keisha, Angie
Man we, can't we all get along
Two shots of Patron, I did it till the break of dawn
Big fish in a pond, running my triathlon
Doggy Dogg keep the bone
One of a kind, blow you mind
Just like Einstein, born to shine
I'm getting mine prime time like 21
Get 'er done, everything in my life, I make it look like fun
Everyday of my life, I'm trying get my buzz on
Cuz on some other shit, I'm keeping it on the under bitch
So much pain I overcame, same thing
Me, E-40, and Game came from the same gang
But you wouldn't understand
I'm populating with my weeper's translation
That's my main man, let me hit that damn thing

I just touched down in killa Cali,
Strapped up my boots,

And get my head in the zone,
Where the fuck you tryin to go,
Nigga this yo city,
Anywhere, I'm just tryin to see some ass and titties,
So full mash the gas,
The night is young,
All bull shit aside,
I'm tryin to have some fun,
Hit the hop in Lakewood,
Or ride down Slawson,
Or to Casino,
they say it's just like Compton,
Really doesn't matter,
Long as shots don't ring out,
Nigga I stay strapped,
I don't wanna pull the thing out,
Well keep the heat heat,
right up under the seat,
and let's roll to Roscoe's,
And grab somethin to eat,
But check ya rear view mirror,
I swear somebody's following,
Rollin in that dark blue,
SS Impala and,
All up on tha bumpa,
Man I'm just sayin,
Tell me you know this nigga,
Naw they betta stop playin,
He sped up around,
And drove right in front of us,
Could be one time,
Just tryin to bust one of us,
Till he smashed the brakes,
And we almost hit him,
Throwin signs out the window,
like something was wrong with him,
Before we jump out,
And get ready to clown,

Hey yo Cali
Walk with me

The chucks the khaki suits
All the swap meet years
The six dollar socks the five dollar rocks
Uncle Greg rest in peace he taught me how to chop
That's why I love the hood and everything we got
From the ice cream trucks to the forty ounce tops
All white Air Force Ones to fake Jacob watch
A few reasons why I drive the Bently hard top
Use it in my songs cause I live it on the block
Tattoo it on my face let the whole world watch
I'm that type of nigga y'all made my city bigger dog
Turn the TV off got tired of watching Jigga boss
So we told our mom's we was looking for jobs
When we was really in the record store looking for Nas

Yeah if you never got knocked then you made it
Everybody know each other if not they realated
You can get shot or get bladed
There's dudes that got jobs now that had blocks in the eighties
Six months five years for you just to cop out
Ninth or tenth grade is usually when niggas drop out
Fights break out when you wired and start joking
A lot of OG's retired and started smoking
House party games of spade sweet kool-aid
Loud music all night till the boys in blue raid
So therefore I could never be too paid
I know where I'm going and where I'm from will get you laid

Tell me this how come
Black folks get a little doe
And forget where they come from
Man we used to have good times
But since you moved on up you aint cool with us
We still support you tho we dont see you much
You ain't the first fool its cool with us
But why you living out your idols dreams
Remember how for you came and help you keep those things
Now its cool that your address changed
But I'm trying to holla at my dog and the number ain't the same
I guess new homies came with his fame
But see true homies will stay the same
Through all the up's and down's in your career
A couple wives few kids scattered here
And when you dead or broke without a deal
All the groupies cleared, The ghetto will still be here

They must got a death wish
They was on the road to the riches back in the day they got off on the exit
Trill disrespect shit
Whenever a nigga try to fuck up your investment
It's hard to digest it
Young niggas don't want to get punched in they faces
So they keep the burner on, to catch a bunch of cases
These old niggas still think they livin' in the '80s
The shawties they knew since they were babies turn crazy
The bitches still holla at anybody
Lookin' like they have a couple dollars
Fuck suck and swallow
Ain't nobody winnin' but everybody can't lose
Dirts still there funeral home ain't move
Going in coming out gang affiliated
Rather go back before being humiliated
A black cloud over the hood you can't escape it
Dust smokin' niggas walk around in the matrix
Loyalty is thin, tension is thick
Look at a broke nigga's face when you mention a brick
Stick up kids come around, when they sense that you rich
Cans of lizzle get lit, when you get hit with a fifth
Niggas they used to hoop dreamin' is now sellin' the piff
And they still rattin' but you can't tell if you stiff
Especially when the tek spit, fuck around get your head and your neck hit
Lookin' for a death wish, walk

[Chorus: Jadakiss]
Talkin' out your mouth
All wreckless to a nigga that you know
That'll let it off
That's a death wish
When your heart stops and your body gets breathless
And help don't come in enough time
That's a death wish
When you see the blood, realize that your chest is hit
And don't know where it came from
That's a death wish
When you know a nigga whole style's on select shit

Body like a porn star 
Smile like a waitress 
Now she turning me uh uh on, uh uh on 
Uh uh on, I mean why not club bed of my mansion 
We can just club in the bed of my mansion 
Leave for the weekend, jet to the hamptons 
Tats on her torso, I love how she ganglion

Like we both ain?t grown 
Wrist kind of heavy, I?m a lil well known 
Matching crosses, different color stones see 
In one line, I got her to come over 
Tell her I?m done sober 
But huuungggg over 
She play the club sippin on ma mocha 
I can fit ya whole crew in one rover 
Just take your shoes off before you step in

Well let?s let OT cop the runaway 
Step off the runway like we on the runway 
Have ya girlfriends thinking you a runaway

He ain't never seen hydraulics, look at his bitch face
Up, down - now watch my shit scrape
Daz call Snoop, I'ma Crip Walk to get Dre

Dribble rock like Wade and bounce like Shaq
Throw a O in the pot and watch it bounce right back

Lil' homies around her constantly on smash mode
Lil' niggaz with pistols that blowin' out your asshole
Bang how we give it, the culture that we live in
Fresh out the hospital or fresh out the prison
Real niggaz for life, the roots of the G tree

Bitch we put the whole car on the shoes

I'll ""Set It Off"" like Queen Latifah, red beam on the nina

Bang out, chippin' in traffic, dippin' the classic
Dippin' to classics, whoopin' that ass
It's hood niggaz ready to get it, your bitch can get it
Cause I know she'll suck a dick in less than a minute
'Cause, I'ma have to show him where the house at
Two milli macks, semi-automatic situational attack
In the back with a sack, Cadillac all black

Bang out on him with the mask and plastic
We got access to massive plastiques

(Bang) like Crips and Bloods
From now on, wear a Bathing Ape hoodie get stripped in the club
Like a bitch in the club, watch him strip in the club
You like ice creams? Get a banana split in the club
No jewelry, you can't wear shit in the club
And that go for every nigga and bitch in the club
So you better take it off 'fore you get in the club

Splitting backboards just to get our weed stuffed in

Instead of copping chains, lets fly to Chile and dig
Go to Haiti and feed to the Bahamas and breathe
On the way back, to my nigga Sean from Belize, you know

Then I get a high, feel like it's irrelevant

I can get a call at any minute, so I'm just doing push-ups
Waiting on what seems to be forever
I burned a hole in my Polo sweater 'cause I was nervous
But hat's how crazy birth is, loading up this Beretta
'Cause this time I'm having a baby girl
So it's whatever, whenever whatever

You my willow and it's my will to make this last forever
First thing I'ma tell her, daddy's your umbrella
Give her the glass slipper Cali, you my Cinderella
Gotta be a dream, hold up, that's your middle name
Both your brothers big now, so baby you my little Game
Who gon' be the Godfather? Swizz? Lil Wayne?
Hey y'all smoke too much but got Cali tatted on his veins
And I just got a text from your mama
Saying the water burst, I guess it's time for my comma 

You walk through the door, she on the ground crying
She don't wanna get up, you had a baby right here
I ain't cleaning that shit up
I finally got her out the house, now we on the elevator
She screaming, her left the car seat, but I'ma tell her later
Forget the car seat, man, I'm hella-faded
She like ""I know you ain't high!"" 
Shit, ""I'm celebrating"" 

Now we in the car, she won't put on her seat belt
Screaming at the top of her lungs,""God, I need help!""
Weaving through traffic, minutes between contractions
Close your eyes right now, and you can see it happening
Imagine she pulling on me ""Stop I'm about to crash, shit!""
Butterflies in my stomach, heart beating fast as shit
Every time I have a kid, it's like the first time
Kids the best, but they be coming at the worst times
Now we here, Tiff get in the wheelchair
Them butterflies still here, am I happy? Hell yeah

I parked the car, now I'm running through the halls lost
Trying to figure out which one of these rooms is ours
Think, think damn one of the nurses stuck their head out
They gave her an epidural so I pulled the couch bed out
Took a nap, woke up, they almost got the head out
She grabbing on the rails, looking like she about to pass out
Told her to breathe, grab my phone and hit record
""Breathe, one, two, three, four, one more, two, three, four

""Push, c'mon T, push! God damn it, just push!""
Nurse Linda coaching her, Doctor Umbar pulling on shoulders
Giving me the notion to cut the umbilical cord
She out, eight pounds four ounces, Sam stop the beat
Hold up, I'm about to make an announcement, 
""See, every time a child is born somebody leave the world
So I thank the woman who gave her life for my baby girl""

""Hey mars turn the beat down a little so I can share my experience""",California Dream,2011

Tell them muthafuckas I'm forever paid, California king
Wrestle gators in the Everglades, drive up out that muthafuckin swamp
In the Escalade so before you put that Red rag
In your pocket I wanna see your fuckin resume
Started off on Ground Zero, then I start to levitate
Rip rappers a new asshole: I never hesitate
Dre Beats on, smoking that chronic just to meditate
I'mma give em hurricanes until another levee break
You niggas is featherweights, I'm Aftermath's heavyweight
Now Dre's weapon of mass destruction is 'bout to detonate
When a nigga Wack found me, shit, I was selling weight
Now a nigga's selling millions, now it's time to celebrate
Performing in front of millions, nigga every race
64 in the '64, now watch the Chevy scrape
4th album, no 5 mics? Then let 'em hate
But I'm not stopping 'til I'm the fucking king in every state

Recognize my life
Ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burning when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright
Cause I want that shot, I'm a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record, I'mma wreck it, even if my record don't pop
I'mma tie a knot on a downtown building, let it tow behind me tell 'em
They can find me in the dark with the ghetto children look at my heart
Nigga fuck your feelings, this is me

I'm sick of motherfuckers talking about ""the West died""
Can't you hear my heart beating?
That's the motherfuckin West side, you test me, you test God
I'm his son, it say in Psalms, you come at me
Then I can split you with this Tommy gun, you won't have no time to run
I'm from the Compton slums and that's how the West ride
I'm from the city where two of the best died
Rest in peace to both of 'em, spit like I'm the ghost of 'em
Damn, I said I spit like I'm the ghost of 'em
Name your top 10, I'm harder than the most of 'em
Matter of fact, shorten your list nigga, top 5
Game, Biggie, Hov, prolly Pac, Nas
No particular order, bet a mil that I slaughter
Serve niggas, give a fuck what you ordered
How dare you niggas pop fly when I'm the nigga
Sold 5 mil out the gate and numbers do not lie

Nigga fuck your feelings, this is me

I gave you the Documentary, shit was a classic
Gave you Doctor's Advocate, you ripped it out the package
Came with LAX, since critics said it was average
I was stressed the fuck out, torn between Aftermath and
Geffen, Interscope, now I got you in the scope
Spill the red ink on the paper, it's like my pen is broke
And this is what you all been waiting for
I'm the lost angel knocking on Satan's door
What the fuck y'all take me for? I love you cause you hate me more
I'm Kobe on the Lakers floor, except I give you 84
Shake you like Haiti's floor, walk up on you
Like ""what's going on baby boy?"" Shots in that Mercedes door
Either I'm crazy, or the black Slim Shady, or
Could that be the reason that Baby said he would pay me more
But I still owe Jimmy one more album
The best the West has ever seen, no disrespect to Calvin

Recognize my life
Ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burning when I yearn these lights

Til the federal come through and raid ours

Was in my home, snapback fitted on my uncle's dome

So he was left alone by himself a lot 
So shit, he did whatever the fuck he wanted to do 
When boys in the hood came out, 
This little nigga rolled himself a joint 
And watched the whole motherfucker by itself 
His pops didn't give a fuck, but his mom found out? 
Shit, she'd kill him and his dad 
She didn't want him seeing, being or getting caught up in no gangsta shit

Game,"In Compton, you either a Blood or a Crip 
Nigga ain't no one in between 
Shit was a hard decision for him to make, 'cause both his parents was Crips 
His Uncle Greg was a Crip, he died when he was five
His brother Jevon was a Crip, he got murdered when he was just thirteen
After that he decided that being a Crip just wasn't for him 
So he ran across the tracks until everything turned red 
And never looked back",Dr. Dre 2,2011

Pops was from Nutty Blocc Compton Crip
Moms was from South Central, she claimed Hoover

You were at the jail recently and master Codi told him
This ain't no place for you
He said, being locked up twenty four hours a day
That shit ain't gangsta
He said, being outside takin' care of your family
That's the most gansgta shit a nigga could ever do
He said the shit I did for him

Lil mama get gangsta for me, stuff it in your Prada bag)
That's right, she's got something that I wanna see
That's right, so if she leave, she fucking with me
That's life, twerk something, work something, hurt something
She wanna check, check this shit out like a verse coming
They rip their neck and run their mouth when they heard something
Dre dropped another one and fucked around and murdered something
Club filled with dead bodies
If not then you a zombie, I'm not gonna feel sorry
You pass out from it, get drunk, get blunted
Do what you wanna do, drug test on you

Lotta money when I talk
Big mills, big deals 'bout a hundred in a vault
Sit still, that real, lotta haters throw salt
They lost big Game give a fuck how you feel
I fear she just might just pop that pill
And feel on me all night till the tip spill
Tip scales with her waistline, sex with the bass line
She gon' fuck a snare drum one drink at a time

Blow right, hoes fight over my name
I got my dough right, hustle running all in my veins
It's forty days, forty nights if I'm making it rain
I reign supreme, a bottle and some bomb-ass weed and we good

If you got drugs in this motherfucker
Let me see your hands in the air
Narcotics in the club and the ladies love us
So let's get high off something
High of something, high of something
'til your mothafucking brain don't function
High of something, high of something

Fireworks when I spark, yellow tape
Lotta chalk thought you said you a boss
Big deal, bitch chill, pulling out that black card
Showin' off big spendin', letting alcohol spill
I feel she might just get too faded
X-rated that's what I like glad that you made it
To this ceremony at hand, take a sip lets plan
For the future, introduce you to Snoop get you right and

May I, kick a little something for G's and
Make a few ends as I breeze through?
The shit on my hip is a fucking preview
And guess what it lead to

If you got drugs in this motherfucker

Narcotics in the club and the ladies love us

I know she gone, but she ain't far away

Sit back listen while I kick it, the Compton Boulevard way

So I took my Chronic album and slept in the hallway
I learned this the hard way, when police came our way
My daddy had his act on like it never happened (Broadway)

Good evening, I'm in Chicago at the Elysian
With some girls that say they models but umm, I don't believe 'em
Who's still getting tested?
Where's all the women that still remember who they slept with?
Where's all the girls too busy studying to make the guest list?
But when you do go out, you still working what you was blessed with
Do it girl, I'll be the king to your Queen Latifah
I love your ass like Milhouse loved Lisa
I love your ass like the Ninja Turtles love pizza
Ironically enough, you something I want a piece of, you got it girl

Until she started acting silly, her heart's a little chilly
She a little too carefree in 10 years
Who's paying for all that therapy? Umm, nigga not me
I'm probably not the man you take me for
But I bet I could be if you make me yours
Most of the shit I say is true
When I’m done with bad bitches, know I’m coming straight to you good girl

Never sleep with the wife of niggas you eat with
And never buy a chick a bag on the first date

I was in the living room feeling on this bitch
Heard my car alarm goin' off on my six
So my dogs start barkin' and some niggas hit the fence
So I took my dick out this bitch mouth and walked to the window
Pull the blinds down and took one hit of the Endo
You niggas ain't doin' shit, but stealin' my neighbors rims so

Yeah that's my .45, but it ain't got no bodies
And two dead niggas, them is nobody
They should've torched 'em, then you wouldn't had no bodies

Couldn't have been me, I do my shit like John Gotti
Feed the nigga to the sharks after dark
Man fuck this shit I thought I told y'all

There was money on the table by the bricks
I was at the kitchen table choppin up some shit
Listenin' to Jeezy and I heard a little
So I turned the radio down and cocked my 4 fifth, oh shit
Am I hit? Nah just a hole in my Jordan fitted
So I turn down all the lights and cock my 4 fifth
Seen some niggas jump in they Escalade and that was it
How much longer I gotta stay in this muthafucka?
Let me get a cigarette, I don't even smoke 
But shit y'all got a nigga stressed
I gotta stay in this muthafucka until I confess?

Shit, y'all bitches better get some rest
'Cause it'll be a cold day in Miami
Before I snitch on myself or the hood, you understand me?
Ya I fuck with the Bulls but I ain't Sammy
Niggas run around the hood singin'
They should get a Grammy
Hey you two muthafuckas should get an Oscar
With this good-cop-bad cop shit, take me to process
'Cause I don't eat breakfast with no pigs
I watched First 48 so fuck your twenty-five years
No evidence, no big
I don't know who split them niggas' wigs

Already told y'all, there was money on the table with the bricks
I was walkin' to the bathroom to take a shit
Then I heard my dogs barkin', there's some noise by the fence
So I ran to my room and reached for the 4 fifth
Then I seen three niggas by my back door
Looked out the bathroom window and seen two more
So I reached for my chopper and some clips out the drawer

Walk out with boxes galore, next week she cop her some more

Spent an Aston Martin on the ring, so you ain't gotta,

Soon as them butterfly doors go up on that Ferrari
She step outside the car on there, stumble into Bulgari
Fall in that Y-cell, try it on, you fly as hell
Don't really like it, but I'm buying it, might as well
Have her own reality show, no drama
Grab your girl, we're shooting real housewives in the Bahamas
2-piece Hermes, Bottega Veneta flats
I heard Diddy out here so you know where the party at

'Cause when we hit the room she up and down like the gas price, damn
Got chills thinking of last night

This hotel room, that's where it goes down
And I know we never get away
Just give me a couple minutes and I'm in it
We all over the table, ain't no problem with you sweating on me
And I ain't pulling out, I'm tryna have fun
I know you tryna have fun

You ain't gotta say bye bye, baby this is hello

She was looking for me, pulled up in that old El Dorado
I was running around with Chase, chasing new black wheels
Why would I do that still? That's what got 2Pac killed
But I use that still 'cause I won't do that deal
Screw the muzzle in potatoes of that new Mac Mill
What did I learn? Nothing, my papa smoking sure and bluffin'
Beating on my moms like her head was a percussion
Tat-tat my four five knocking on your window
She said there would be days like this
Pharrell, drop the instrumental

Yes sir

[Chorus: x2]
I know I must go and I don't know my way
Still somehow I know I'll end up where we all came from
(From my mama's womb)

Crack a Swisher, crack the fifther 
Hennessy pouring like Niagara Falls
Used to watch Magic, he showed me how to ball
Mom's working late night, to get a plate right
Had some older brothers, all we did was smoke and play-fight
Wish I could go back to them days 'cause streets don't play right
Some niggas hard, other niggas was the Kid 'N' Play type
But that didn't stop me from pretending I was Apollo from Rocky
Working on my dip-game, now nobody wanna box me

Pick and choose, stick and move
So many dudes ended up with sleeping bags on late-night news
But not my mama's son, going around the hood for serving customers
She yapping in my ear, but it's louder than the muffler
What I didn't listen to, I wish I would've trusted her
Wish I had a shovel, be digging both of my brothers up
Like, ""Here hug em ma, one last time""
Put a chain on both of them niggas, they get one last shine

[Chorus]

Put your block down, recognize a king 'cause it's my town
Word to my mother you can throw up your rock now
Got off the beef shit 'cause I ain't tryna see my mama in all-black
Right there, crying over hard facts
Now she gotta turn in all her cars and get her house back
Never, she carried me for nine months so she can have whatever
Clever, she taught me how to shoot Berettas, told me that I'd be a king
So R.I.P. to Coretta, if you don't understand that
Then refer to my letter, while I sprinkle
Niggas with platinum, from my last album
Got the check, so I signed on the X like Malcolm
Riding through the hood, you hating niggas like, ""How come?""
That niggas Game got it, heard he selling talcum
Either way, playboy, check it, this is the outcome
You might not like it, but my mama psychic
Why you niggas twisted like the top of a sidekick?

Kidnap a vampire, drain all his fuckin' veins
Wolf gray Jordan's, use his intestines for the strings
Snatch up Rihanna and throw her in front of a fuckin' train
Sniff a fucking unemployment line of cocaine
Tie Lil' B up to a full tank of propane
Swag, now watch him cook
And just stand there and look
Have a bonfire with old Harry Potter books
Martians versus goblins, goons versus the crooks
And since me and Tune had Viacom shook
I shoulda got a real-ass pirate to do the hook
Maybe Jack Sparrow maybe Peter Pan's nemesis
My power's limitless like Blanka on Sega Genesis
Superhero, mad that Marvel overlooked me

Getting chased by the polices on a full bred Cheetah

Dragging all you fags to the back of the log cabin
Fall back like Lebron's hairline against the Mavericks (he lost)

He killed me on my own track, so what? Not you
Fuck you, I spit like I had kids with Erykah Badu
I fucked her on the day of that naked video shoot
I was sucking that pussy like it was wonton soup
Then I hit Lebron's mom in bron-bron's coupe
With Delonte West taping, we had bon-bons too
And Cleveland cheerleaders, they had pom-poms too
So I smacked them bitches wearing Bishop Don Juan's suit
(Where was Snoop?) I don't know, probably doing what the Crips do
But when I'm with my uncle, fuck it! Then I'm a Crip too
And I will Crip Weezy, Crip Jones, and Crip you

""Ricky!""
""Help me! Help me! Somebody, help me!""
""Ricky, Ricky!""
""Ricky!""

Blood of a slave, heart of a giant
Had to leave Aftermath, Dre said I was too defiant
That was five years ago, look how fast it go
Destroyin' Interscope, shot myself like Plaxico
But fuck that, blaze one, where the matches yo?
Hit the freeway and see how fast the Aston go
Roll the window down, clip off the ashes so
You can see all my diamonds and how much cash I blow
How many bitches I fuck, how many cars I drive
How many goons I got, count 'em and they all outside
Niggas try to shut me up like Malcom
But standin' in the window caine smoking was the outcome

Sometimes I get a little stressed and pop a Valium
Hit Hollywood late night and knock down a stallion
So niggas think twice about my medallion or
You'll hear Cuba Gooding yelling ""Ricky!""
My nostalgia is one hundred percent Compton and zero percent snitch
Park a Bentley and the Phantom on blocks while I use the pitch
Made the Cincinnati fitted more famous than Griffey did
And just to think, several years ago they tried to split his wig
Two to the chest, struck his heart, one hit his rib
Then I blacked out, like a movie, all I could hear

Feelin' all fucked up, woke up to a doctor
All I could think about, was that the cops took my weed and my choppers
They want me to sing, like Sinatra, I told the detective
Get this clear like Belvedere vodka
Them five shots, they created a monster
Hell's Kitchen comin' straight out of Compton
I seen Boyz in the Hood, Morris Chestnut was a actor
2Pac was the real life ""Ricky!""
Then they shot down the nigga that shot him, I swear to God
If I'm lying then Compton is New York and I'm Rakim
I'm from where niggas get murdered over stock rims
And punched in the jaw just for a cocked brim

Nobody mama let the cops in, we ain't got no options
Wanted to be a boxer, but I was boxed in
Then my grandmother house went up for auction
And that's what killed 'em, I'm goin' back to buy the block then
Too many niggas locked in, dig up Cochran and defend all my niggas
With they faith under stockings, rather face
God then twenty-five with no options
If Compton ain't the murder capital, we in the top ten
Drive by with our face painted, like a clown
With a tre-pound, forty shells bouncin' off the ground
This how my living room sound, when my brother got shot down",Ricky,2011

Empty jelly jars, nigga, bird in the couch shit
The mad rapper, Oscar the Grouch shit
Except when I'm hopping out of cans, I'm pulling out shit
Dippin' the four though, double X 3-D Polo
If hip-hop was the league, I'd be the motherfuckin' logo

Your last shit was so-so, you should sign to Jermaine
I've been hard since I was solo
Niggas they feel my pain, I make it rain without the strippers
Go against the grain, and push your shit back like some clippers
I bang and then I hang out at the Staples like Blake Griffin
You can tell I'm getting money the way that glass house is sitting
I mash out the strip then like Nash when I'm dippin'

Them boys want they music on blast
Don't turn it down, turn it up every time them cops pass
Mashed on the gas, am I getting high, don't even ask
'Cause I got another ounce up in the stash
Them boys want they music on blast
Don't turn it down, turn it up every time them cops pass
Mashed on the gas, am I getting high, don't even ask
'Cause I take two hits, and then I pass

I see the cops in the rear view, 
Why can't a motherfucker chill in the car
Feelin' like Missy, why you all up in my grill
They must know that I got bird stashed all up in my grill
Camouflage by the armor all while it's sparkling off my wheels
And I fuck hoes that prey on Dwight Howard and Shaquille
Not them throwback rats they be on showin' on college hill
For real, I think my first album sold five mil'

And you say to yourself that he is broke 
Well how the hell am I ballin', like Spalding
I did a couple of movies, now agents calling and calling
Can't get to the phone right now because my boss is all in this bitch mouth
When did we start taking these tricks out?
Now she gon' run her big mouth and tell her girlfriend
You had her all up in the wind blowing yo cheese on Louie Vuittons 
And now that bitch is in the wind and after the next draft, 
She gon' start that cycle again
How you claimin' that bitch when she with him, come again 'cause

Daddy fat sex, my balls are on your chin, 
But can you tell me where my dick's at?
Gat or ghetto, head hunter, head buster through the chit-chat
I skip to the lou, my darling bring the thunder, 
I'm the lightning that strikes twice
Motherfucker, call me master
'Cause I run the plantation and I'm whooping niggas asses
If they disrespect the presentation, below the Mason-Dixon, 
We facin' the basses that were missin' pimpin'

You can embrace it or come face to face with total devastation
My mojo is never fadin', I'm in my Optimus Prime transform
Switch it up, heat it up, speed it up, that means I'm gone
Light years, ahead of your Buzz, Toy Stories and club songs
Black home, the A-T-L-iens are phoning home
But I feel like a librarian,
'Cause style's are being loaned out like books
A castle full of crooks, rape and pillage
They'll do anything for money while misleading the village

Not from New England, but I pack a patriot
Not from Atlanta, but I got the cater
Not from Chicago, but I'm a bear
I'm a bay area nigga, 49er, Raider
I'm about my bread man, I ain't no sucker
Now these bitch ass niggas soft as table butter
I'm about my riches, magazines, street hustler
You can ask your uncles, daddies, mothers, and your older brothers

But I used to flee through that yellow white, yo right
Sellin' that shit below the retail price
I'm a rare breed like the bike club, get it right
Desperado like Tori Amos, shout out to dynamite
I got my red cup, and some green

Is why I don't trust no one except God and Tim Tebow
Living my destiny poppin' pills high as fuck
Fucking bitches in the club holding my space bottle up
I think it's time you salute me or shoot me
Either way I'm the star of this motherfucking booth

They say I got a suicidal tendency murdering my enemies verse
It ain't no questioning thunder under my shirt
Fuck around and you'll be up under the dirt
This automatic will turn your home into a hearse
Worse case scenario pipe bound your burial
They gonna have to bury your twice
The scary cat on this night life
The golf stream vibing what the weed is top flight
My PO already know I'm a motherfucking flight risk
Heavy chain light risk pay cash for everything that white bitch
She got it, she got it, that's my words the oriental
Sixty two minutes they got it looking like murder all
I'm leaning hard in that flat back turbo charge
Coupe on twenty fours pedal to the floor
Hundred shots of that nigga still got plenty more
Slim the mobster am I is really made Uzi
We turn your block to a motherfucking movie

Lights, cameras, action niggas ready to shoot you
But these ain't lights ain't cameras pointed at you
Blocked off the scene cause your scenes don't move me
Will turn your block into a motherfucking movie

Rap boy we were kids we were the Lord of the Rings
Rep in the full train smoke in solely green
I know other case burst scenes there's no more men of honor
I might made my super armor running from karma
The good die young no country for old men
There will be blood deeper than leviathan
And my platoon full of bad lieutenants
X-men, expendables, bad company, criminals
Crush goons with a kanga, surfing in the rainbow
48 hours to kill Bill, Cash and Tango
Brave heart, battleship, devil's out to kill with the
Passion of Christ, it's a wonderful life
Miami Vice what to get right
It's midnight in the garden the good and evil are crashing
Ordinary people, lethal weapon without 4 sequels
Above the hunger games
The gods must be crazy ricochet through the purple ring
Because the devil wears prada
The dead presidents can turn a goodfella to a godfather
Animal house, standing to live with the case speech
Leonardo DiCaprio on the beach
Oceans Eleven, if all dogs go to heaven
The silence of the lambs, son of sam 7, I am legend
Fuck this new jack city I'm on the midnight express
With this American History X

Off the dome and I'm talking slick as petroleum
Because I don't fuck with pens unless I'm rolling on some eulogium
Niggas preaching hate from Napoleon nigga slowly throwing salt on my game
Like fluorine or sodium on a door
But holy I'm only in it for the cash part
Thinking fuck the world something like a pornstar with a passport
With officer walking and my side mirror in
He don't like me cause I'm dark as an nigerian
Rocking alot of juries smart as a librarian
In the look in the american eyes said I'd bury him
I said it before don't ignore it again too
Hands on the 9 like you couldn't attend due
Life's a hooker the hall raised me
This poor baby was born crazy
Put in the middle of drug wars
Thug lord and judges tryin' to call case me
Lord save me it's gone Swayze the movie

Niggas talking, nosy neighbors and everything
But a coffin, the hood filled with dope fiends and street walkers
Babies crying, hop signs, dogs barking
Crime scene, yellow tape, the street chalking
Bloody sheet cover the face of the departed
The blood drop and then she hardens
Cops celebrate the ? gun, this often
Young bitch 14 6 months pregnant
Sell her body on the corner, smoke weed on a regular
Get a pimp off her money, dope man he was? 
Last week raped twice forced abortions
It's the life that I'm living ghetto that I'm lost in

Pop a ? on who you blaming on cops lock them
A jail cell can't rehabilitate a nigga
They raise your bell and give a crack dealer life sentence
Turn around and give a pedal to the floor till you fall
That's why a prison door, over a revolving door
3 hots and a ? it's all we got, ? for Big and Pac

Who ever knew when that child was born
He'd be Barack
44th president to be black, you gotta deal with that
Confess that I heard were crack, we gotta deal with that
Wonder why we put in the bags and throw still with that
See a phantom like beans I kill for that
Hood nigga going rich, now I got a mill for that
Law suit she's bringing, swear I've been through
With paying nigga in full, it's getting shot through his fuel
Known thug, since my brother got killed in cold blood
So would I avenge his death, so would I sell drugs
Promised to be a real nigga to the death of me
Bury my casket to the block with the rest of me
And let my headstone really was a father
Any nigga that thought he went hard, I went harder
So state out my bidness and off my mind
I take a shot to the downfall, I'm on my grind

Ridin' down rodeo in the chevy with pills
And pop one, load 12 slugs in the eagle
And shot one, donald sterling hopped in his benz
I got one, beam on the back of his dome
Palm sweaty on the back of the chrome
That's my adrenaline
So we purge sandusky, purge zimmerman
Purge every mother fucker rapin' women in
Purge niggas killin' kids, back to back in two vans
Me and my mercenaries, middle of south sudan
Carryin' babies bodies, long as I got two hands
Long as I got two feet, millions and my crew deep
We purge for the families, they deaths ain't in vein now
Crash my ass, niggas know who shot that plane down
298 innocent lives severed
Flyin' on aaliyah's wings all the way to heaven

I hope his mama tears is like acid to your fuckin badges
2 shots in his brain, 4 in his fashion
Thinkin' 'bout his casket in this phantom, swear I almost crashed it
That's why I'm headed to ferguson with this german luger
'cause I'm probably more like nelson mandela than martin luther
More like ice t than ice cube, I'm a cop killer
Murder all the cops, then the cops will probably stop killin'
On my knees prayin', wish my nigga pac was livin'
But he fell victim to the rampart division, purge
Cops killed biggie, cops beat up rodney king
We tore up the city nigga, purge

But you never say this shit when I'm fucking you
We was the Huxtables, everything was perfect
Everything was working
We had some beautiful kids together
Had a nigga feeling like everything was worth it
Closet full of Birkins
How you make a nigga spend a million dollars on purses?
Then have an attitude
Like you in the studio helping a nigga write verses
Had a nigga focused on the future, now a nigga feeling like Future
We both dealing with a new nigga 'round our kids
And we ain't kill 'em yet, nigga, I salute you
And I still bang like I used to, red Impala, gold things like I used to
Pick up my kids, they don't see none of that
But when I'm back in the hood I'm yelling soo woo!
And it was all good just a week ago
Shit, we was Nicki and Meek a week ago
Gave you everything, the watch, the house, the cards
Tatted your passport, and now you wanna see me low
Wanna take my pussy, give it to the next nigga free
One thing about the next nigga
He just the next nigga, he can never be me
I'm coming to get my kids and they momma like

Fuck all these bitches, I'm yours
Only thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas
Fuck all these bitches, I'm yours

Compton ain’t the same
Where all these bitch niggas come from?
Can’t even take a fade or ride through the hood
Without niggas hands out like they want some
But where you at when I need you?
See most of these niggas see through
You throw up a P, I throw up a P too
You pulling out heat, I draw the heat too
Compton made me like this, nigga
Fuck all these bitches, get money and die
Hundred niggas in my section, hundred Rollies in the sky
There's a hundred little niggas that will bang on a nigga
Put the flame on a nigga, take chains from a nigga
That will go BG, Turk and Wayne on a nigga
When the club get cloudy let it rain on a nigga
We are with the shit, let us redefine lit
That’s in the club smoking on extendos, extendo with the clip
Standing on the couch like wah
Backwood hanging out my mouth like wah
Who the fuck want a problem?
Once you’re shot, leave a nigga dead on an island
Creep out the back door with my side bitch, aye

Fuck all these bitches, I'm yours
Only thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas
Fuck all these bitches, I'm yours

Oooh-oooh-oooh
Fuck these other bitches I just
Oooh-oooh-oooh
Fuck with them when issues begin
Oooh-oooh-oooh
I be with my niggas, when I'm
Oooh-oooh-oooh
Say I'm with my niggas, I just
Oooh-oooh-oooh
Don't you know there's no better time than when I'm with you?
But I can't control these temptations when a nigga not with you
You wanna be done with me, but your heart won't let it
Standing at the front door but you just can't exit
You wanna be with me
You wanna be with me, with me, with me, with me
Me, me, me, me
You wanna be with me, with me, with me, with me
Me, me, me, me

Still hop in the freestyle, kick it like two Bruce Lee's

You do the addition in ballerina shoes
Enough with the clever raps, it’s more important than that
I put my city on the map, nigga
Yeah, I really put my city on the map
I mean, when the last time you heard Carson on the track, nigga?
Let alone when they calling out stomping grounds on the West
I’ll wait
Yeah, that’s what I thought, I’m the best, nigga
This the new West, nigga, respect that
It’s Top Dawg, all I’m missing is the red hat
But don’t question what pocket I had left, my handkerchief
I’m guilty by affiliation, in many ways gangsta

I was the little nigga Pac was talking to
When he said ""keep your head up""
Cause he knew what I would be facing after his demise
Jayceon had to pitch them pies, better life than flipping fries
I'm the one the Crips despise
Move the Yay or kiss the sky, for having dreams that 50 died
Eulogy by Mary Blige
Hopped up in that enterprise, had to stop a genocide
Went from underdog to watching Top Dawg and Kendrick rise
Now tell me can I testify, pull over trying to rest for 5
On a block, no tint on the Wraith left these kids mesmerized
They ask me how I did it, how I got it
Say I'm king you looking brolic
I put them weights down start practicing lyrical exercise
Tell me who the next to die, probably who the next in line
They got me babbling ghost cause I'm the illest one alive
That's word to Pac, Pun, Biggie, why I stand as my city
It's wise to run a train, you couldn't fuck with me
Ever since I saved my coast, it's been born again
If I ain't shit then who the king of California then?
Who could out-rap me?
Now think about if the same nigga you bout to say can run up and out-strap me, yeah
Out-trap me, yeah, out-gat me
I mean think about it, exactly

Then they killed Buntry, [L?] and Heron, they getting sloppy
LAPD, these niggas worse than the Nazis

Game,"You see I wake up in the morning

I'm feeling like making this bitch iron my clothes or something
Multitasking, cooking breakfast, making a nigga wanna (smack that ass)
See, I met this bitch on Crenshaw, she told me give her a ride
I said ""If I do that, you gotta give me head while Ray Charles drive.""
'Cause I ain't, for, the tricking, no I ain't
I'm with my main bitch and my side bitch, I'm feeling like Saddam
They had the bomb, and if her baby daddy tripping fuck that nigga
I push that nigga hairline back like he LeBron
make a nigga disappear like J-Kwon
Body found by the Swans, nigga missing both of his arms, I ain't playing
I'm with the rat-tat-tat-tat, shoot a nigga if
he do or don't die, he ain't never coming back
Now it's one, two, buckle my shoe
Padded leather Giuseppes nigga, watch what the fuck I do

Yay yay, I said I put that on my momma I'mma ride for you baby boo

Yeah, Quik is the name
With The Game, its a goddamn shame niggas can't see that we to blame
For putting Compton to flames, ignite it up
Haters knotted up, when you trip, with canker sores in your whip
That's what I do, to protect my party
My goons snatch you out by your Ed Hardy, then its back to shawty
All the ladies drink free, all the players grab a tab
That's how that's supposed to be, drinking Casamigos
Fucking faster than grand national regals
I'm in it in the pussy doing kegals
I'm so Fred Segal right now, she so spread eagle right now
Ain't nothing but the clothes going down
I'm in the game and the fires the same
My music is infinite like even before my fame
I wrote about a thousand 16-bar verses
And I'm still coming off like this my first here

I hope you giving head today

Now DJ Quik got a bitch from the Bay
Say she wanna fuck his lil homie, got her sipping on that Alize
You ever had your dick sucked to Mausberg before?
And had a Mossberg pump leaning on the front door?
Treat my dick a newborn, hold the head
I told a bitch ""Pimpin' ain't dead, hoes are scared
So stop that bickering,"" I got a bitch from the
Nickersons that got a fucking bounty on my head, uh ho

I'm rhyming with Chuck Taylor too, he doing something new
Something more comfortable for you to just bang your shit to
So lady, go on and work those hips
Like them inmates work those divs
And when I get there baby work your lips
If it don't make Dollars don't holler
It's DJ Quik in any year Impala
And if it don't make Sense then don't flinch
What you hear from a bull that don't chew no grass? No shit

Think you from LA cause you listen to some Mustard
This is Battlecat, my nigga Kurupt had the battle raps
We go back like four flats on the Cadillac
Nigga you ain't never been to a hood day
You don't know Ice Cube, today was a good day
You ain't never been on dropped off in the jungles
Teared Khakis, red bandana wrapped around your knuckles
Me and my brother used to dip down in 'Shaw
Stopped at the Weiner Schnitzel, got socked in the jaw
By some sixties, I bombed back, the nigga pulled
Out a strap, said it's 6-0, I ducked then he missed me
Now I'm back to Bompton
Before I hit the hood, a nigga gotta stop in the swanson
Pick up a sack, had fifty for an eighth
And I only had fifty, made it last all day
Smoking with the homies, My nigga G weed from [?]
My nigga Hooter from Athens Park stay brackin'
Fo' line, deuce line, Bray still active
And the Cedars ain't giving no passes, why we asking?

How you gon bang if you really ain't from LA
We spray your gang up on the wall

And how you gon' fade if you really don't know the dance
I see you really don't bang at all

Murder was the case that they gave Game
Cops on the colors cause they know a nigga gang bang
Red bandana round the rear-view
""Where you say you from, Blood?"" Niggas can't hear you
Flag on the left side claiming you a Blood
Blue rag on the right side calling niggas cuz
Bout to get your mark ass chalked out on the West

Enemies know the business, this shit is factual
Papa Smalls hate it, fuck it, shoot out and fade it
So my mama stay awake cause her son be gang banging
You don't know about the put ons and DPs
Hanging out on the block coming through to squeeze
Some outta town niggas disrespecting

And I fuck with the villains and the swans on God

On God
I got niggas from Denver Lane that'll ride
I got esés that'll kill you at your job
I got some looters by the Weiner Schnitzel
Hanging out with the pistols, making sure shit official
Big [?] and [?] both got stripes
Both locked up for life, so if I ever hit the pen
I got a squad, hell yeah I'm on that gangsta shit
Nigga run up, knockout, he gon' think he's slick
Hub in the dub, nigga don't even trip
I get you chased by the grapes, nigga 300 crips
