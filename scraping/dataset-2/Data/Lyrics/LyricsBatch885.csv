Ray Charles,"Sleigh bells ring, are you list'nin'?
In the lane, snow is glist'nin'
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

In a meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, ""Are you married?"", we'll say, ""no, man
But you can do the job when you're in town""

When it snows, ain't it thrillin'
Though your nose get a little chillin'?
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way, walkin' in a winter wonderland

In a meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, ""Are you married?"", we'll say, ""no, man
But you can do the job when you in town, brother""

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we made
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

Oh, walk on, mm-hmm
Let's frolic and play the Eskimo way, walkin' in a winter wonderland
Come on, walk it, hmm, get on",Winter Wonderland,1985
Ray Charles,"The tropic moves sides of ships at sea
But doesn't matter if my thoughts are free
Cant you see what you're doing to me
The honeybee makes a sigh at me 
The birds above sing a song of love 
Though I have cried constantly
That's not the thing to do
This feeling has me dangling on a string
With no escape seemingly
Though I have thoughts with myself that I'm lost
So let it be
Let my favorite cloud
Pass over me
Forget about
The past with glee
So if you smile real soon
I'll hear angels singing
A tune
Can't you see darlin' what you're doing to me?",Can't You See Darling?,1987
Ray Charles,"If I give you my love, what will you give in
Return, if I give you my love
Will you cause my heart to yearn, and will it bring
Me sadness, with so many tears
And will it bring me gladness, all through out the
Years

if I give you my word, will you give me your word
Too
If I vow to yours, promises me that you'll be true
Am I playing with fire, tell me are you concerned,
If I give you my love
What will you give in return

Am I playing with fire, tell me are you concerned
It I give you my love, what will you give in return",If I Give You My Love,1987
Ray Charles,"A sentimental blues
Will worry you
And make you do
Things that you
Wouldn't do
Only when you
Hear these blues

A sentimental blues
Will wet your eye
You wonder why
You heave a sigh
You start to cry
Each time that you
Hear these blues

Sigh, sigh, sigh
And drool
Cry, cry, cry
You fool
Yes, I know that it's cool

A sentimental blues
Deep down inside
Will make you hide
Your foolish pride
A sentimental blues
Will make you lose
Your mind

Ray Charles,"This love of mine, goes on and on
Though life is empty, since you have gone
You're always on my mind, though out of sight
It's lonesome through the day and all the night

I cry my heart my out, it's bound to break
Since nothin' matters, then let it break
I ask the sun and the moon, the stars that shine
What's to become of it, this love of mine?

In liberating strife
Who more than self, our country loved

Til all success be nobleness

For amber waves of grain
For purple mountain majesties
Above the fruited plain

He crowned thy good, yes he did, in brotherhood

Cotton is down to a quarter a pound, but I'm busted

A big stack of bills that gets bigger each day 
The county's gonna haul my belongings away cause I'm busted. 

I went to my brother to ask for a loan cause I was busted 
I hate to beg like a dog without his bone, but I'm busted 
My brother said there ain't a thing I can do, 
My wife and my kids are all down with the flu, 
And I was just thinking about calling on you 'cause I'm busted. 

Well, I am no thief, but a man can go wrong when he's busted 
The food that we canned last summer is gone and I'm busted 
The fields are all bare and the cotton won't grow,

Dined and danced, and I was ready to go

While she went down to the powder place

Ray Charles,"Bombarded by philosophies that satisfy the surface
I flee to something deeper at the risk of seeking purpose
How can I hang in this environmental state of being
When everything I'm striving for it's nothing that I'm seeing

Won't you take my heart, won't you take my soul
Won't you come and make me whole again
You, you've got what I need and you never retreat
Unto you I will concede

So help me God
To put my faith in you
So help me God
Before I come unglued
Call it my addiction
I can't get enough of you
So help me God
To put my faith in you

Infected by the skin I'm in that's starving with desire
And Jesus ain't the latest thing to come across the wire
I throw myself in mercy for I am the chief of sinners
But daily taking up my cross
Has brought it's share of splinters

You're there when I call
And you're there when I fall
Even though I don't deserve it all
You, you light my way
Through the night and the day
And from you I will not stray

God so help me
This is my soul's plea
I'm desperately devoted
I can't get enough of you

Cause you are the one I need
Cause you are the one I'm seeking
Cause you are the one for me",So Help Me God,1993

For amber waves of grain,
For purple mountain majesties,

To get myself a little taste
The music is nice and swinging
And of course, I really dig the place

Course, I haven't
Had much sleep lately
I feel sorta down and out

Yeah, but look over there
In the corner, man
Oh, yeah, there's something
To shout about

Hey, hey, pretty baby
Girl, don't you go nowhere
(Are you talking to me)

I'm talking to you, pretty baby
Girl, don't you go nowhere
Cause as soon as I pay the bartender
Girl, I'll be right there

She looked up and blushed and smiled
And my heart skipped a beat
Mmm, she's stacked from
Her head down to her feet

Hey, barkeep
You better come here and get your bread
This little girl's getting ready to split
And I'm about to go out of my head

Hey, hey, pretty baby
Girl, don't you go out that door
(Are you talking to me)

I'm talking to you, pretty baby
Girl, don't you go out that door
I'm afraid if I lose sight of you
I just might not see you no more

She slowed up just a little bit
And turned her head and smiled
She was 34-24-38
And dressed in the latest style

I finally caught up
With the pretty little thing
Before she got out on the street

And she told she was
Waiting on her old man
Who was a policeman on the beat

Hey, hey, pretty baby
Girl, I'll see you another time
(Are you talking to me)

I'm talking to you, pretty baby
Girl, I'll see you another time
If you're a policeman's woman

Little Girl I'll never put you down

You argue when I leave for work
You argue when I get home
Everything I try to do for you
You always say that I'm wrong
I bring you home all my money
Except the little I keep for expense
And when I get home to you mama you always tell me
''Ray you ain't got nooo sense''

But on the other hand baby
You I can understand

Ah, But when you put your loving arms around me honey
You make me forget about everything

I think about the lousy way you treat me
Your always-raising sin
I know that you know that I know
That you've got another man
Ah, Half the time that I'm at home
I have to go to a café and eat
And when you argue all night long 
I have to go down to the den and sleep

Your loving eases all my pain

And when you put your loving arms around me honey
You make old Ray forget about everything

Who's colder than an arctic storm
Got a heart just like a stone
Even ice men leave her alone.

They call her

To torture and kill them

There was Hannah, pouring water on a drowning man

To torture and kill them
Is her delight, they say

Is like traveling through Alaska in your BVD's

She started packing some clothes in a hurry
And then she said she would be right back

So I had to look out for myself

To find out what they knew
They said, no by heck but we will get her yet
Because they were looking for her too.

Well I called my Dr. Foster
And when the girl answered the phone
I got a funny feeling

She said he left with a lady patient

I added two and two and here's what I got

When through the kitchen door, up popped her father
He said ""I saw you when you kissed my daughter
Better wed her right now, or face a slaughter!""

I didn't know just what I was doing
I had to marry of face ruin

A mint julep, a mint julep
A mint julep, a mint julep
One mint julep was the cause of it all

Now, I don't want to bore you with my troubles
But from now on I?ll be thinking double
I'm through with flirting and drinking whiskey
I got six extra children from a-getting frisky

Ray Charles,"Down through the ages, 'round this time of year
People's hearts all aglow
Yuletide carols fill the air with cheer

Lights on Christmas trees and snowflakes fallin' down
What a lovely sight it is to see
You will always know when Christmas time is near
You feel the need to be in harmony

'Cause Christmas time is really more than givin'
It's spreading all the news of peace and love
Christmas time is all about receiving
The gift that God has sent from up above

People goin' here and people goin' there
Buying gifts for those they know and love
Never stop to think that the greatest gift of all
Is he who sends his love from up above

Waitin' in suspense to open all my gifts
It seems like the time just creeps along
When we finally see the presents that we have
We open up our hearts and sing this song

That Christmas time is really more than givin'
It's spreading all the news of peace and love
Christmas time is all about receiving
The gift that God has sent from up above

Christmas time is really more than givin'

I stole a kiss, and then another
I didn't mean to take it further

One mint julep was the cause of it all
The lights were burning low, there in the parlor
When through the kitchen door, up popped her father
He said ""I saw you when you kissed my daughter
Better wed her right now, or face a slaughter!""

I didn't know just what I was doing
I had to marry of face ruin

At times I'd stay awake and watch you sleep
Your innocence would move me

At times you've made me scared

Angelina, in silence you would speak
A simple touch of you and I grew weak

I have refused the same demand
All my life

When you pretend I have no shame
You're half right

All along
You kept trying to pin me down
Turn me into your house clown
If I don't fit the bill
All the same
I loved you then
I love you still

Want to know the truth?
I caught a nasty bug
And when it got a hold of me
I could not shake it free

Has been haunting me

Forever chasing me...

But the way you played your hand
I couldn't stand

It's too bad
There is much more we could have done
But now those days are dead and gone
Nothing lasts

Can you look back on what we built?
I wonder what you saw in me
Tell me, was it real?
Was it love?

There's one that goes and one that stays
But they will meet again I know they will
You know they will

In that tinsel town of time
Let's be fair, this boring life we have to share
You know that I care honest I swear
That's what I'm yet but the facts are so unfair

They say that's pain up ahead and rivers of rain
There's nowhere to hide
And today you must make a change
So ditch us all we'll go on our own separate ways

There could be some desperate days
And when you're on the legs don't stop
And stare don't say a prayer
Just call me and I'll be there

You must be strong life is hard
And I can't stay long 'cause deep down inside
We know we tried we had our fights
But you know the tale don't lie

Listen to the sweet harmony that we used to sing
Upon other lights all the shows shown all the night
I'm back on the stage I'm turning the page

Say goodbye, please promise that you will not cry
'Cause I want you to believe in you, show me you do
That's why I sing this song of our separate ways

Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues,1997

Played in minor keys

I've got scars
From those dives I've played in

How could I ever let you slip away

Slip away, slip away
Right through my fingers I let you slip away

but its heart to hold on to love when its falling apart
and now that its over there's nothing more i can say
except that I'm sorry for saying too little too late

Could never see

Just trustin' you
Was my great sin

Your victim now
'Cause soon, his head
Like mine will bow

Should not complain

When he put his arms around her, he said ""Julie baby you're my flame""
Thou givest fever, when we kisseth, fever with thy flaming youth
Fever - I'm afire, fever yea I burn forsooth.

Captain Smith and Pocahontas had a very mad affair
But when her Daddy tried to kill him, she said ""Daddy,Daddy don't you dare""

Fever - I'm his Missus, Oh daddy won't you treat him right.

Now you've heard our story, (oh, it's your story)
Here's the point we have made (I'm listening)
Chicks were born to give you fever (that's right)
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade
They give you fever - when you kiss them, fever if you live and learn

Deeper than the midnight sky,

I used to see her around the neighborhood, 
I wonder how she grew up so good.
She belonged to Freddy and he was bad 
And I never was ready to make him mad.
I'm glad I had to wait awhile, 
A little bit too juvenile.
I needed to refine my style, a silk suit 
And a crocodile smile.

Take away my trouble, take away my grief
Take away my heartache, in the night like a thief

Yes I need her in the night
Yes I want to throw my arms around her
Kiss her hug her kiss her hug her tight

Yes it makes me mellow down in to my soul",Crazy Love [Live] [Live],2004

How can I go on?
It seems dear love has gone away.

Where is my spirit?
I'm nowhere near it,
Oh yes, my love has gone astray.

But Ill blame it on the sun,
The sun that didn't shine,
Ill blame it on the wind and the trees.

Ill blame it on the time that never was enough,
Ill blame it on the tide and the sea,
But, my heart blames it on me.

Who poured the love out?
What made this bitter doubt?
Is peace not here for me to see?

Wish I could tell you,
But, words won't come for me to speak.

But Ill blame it on the sun,
That didn't fill the sky,
Ill blame it on the birds and the trees.

Ill blame it on the day that ended once too soon,
Ill blame it on the nights that could not be,
But, my heart blames it on me.

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long, for the day when I'll cling to him

Are cutting you down to your size at last

Makin' a few calls,
Doodlin' weird things,
Usin' the booth walls.

Got me a big date,
Waitin' for my chick,
Puttin' my face on,
So she could look slick,

I enjoy procrastinating
'Cause I'm busy while I'm waiting,
Doodlin' away, doodlin away

Sittin' and dinin' (dining)
Dinner beginnin',
Started designin'
Usin' the linen,

""Can't you see I'm very busy,
""Doodlin' away, doodlin' away.""

""Do you doodle all day?""
Asked the waiter in his way,

""With old doodlin' you,""

Look exactly like a doodle to me?
If I ever have a doubt
What life is all about
I get my pencil out and then commence to doodlin' 
And I find it real relaxing
'Specially when I feel that life is really taxing!

'Cause weird designs
They only show what's going on 
In weirder minds
Those when you doodle then your noodle's flying blind
Every little thing that you write
Just conceivably might
Be a thought that you capture
While coppin' a wink
Doodlin' takes you beyond what you see
When you write what you think.

I'd feel so lost without my doodlin',
Doodlin' really helps me ease my mind,
I'd be tempest-tossed
Without my doodlin',
When I'm doodlin' there's one thing I find,

Truly, I really really really really really truly truly wanna figure out
What my doodlin's all about.

Later the waiter
Had me arrested,
Took me to Bellevue,
Where I was tested.

Had me a doctor
Probin' my noodle,
'Fore he was half-done,
Taught him to doodle,
Showed him hidden thoughts that linger 
Find an outlet through your finger,
Doodlin' away, doodlin' away.

Doctor was real nice,
Told me to be cool,
Looked at the waiter, 
Called him the real fool, 

Looked at my baby
Told me he dug her,
Got me to doodlin',

From the lips that you once fondly pressed

Flit away with a smile and a tear,
So you can never tell who's kissing her now
Or just whom you'll be kissing next year.

There'll be some changes made today, there'll be some changes made.
For there's a change in the fashions, ask the feminine folks,
Even Jack Benny has been changing jokes,
I must make some changes from old to the new,
I must do things just the same as others do.
I'm going to change my long tall Mama for a little short fat,
Going to change the number where I live at.
I must have some loving or I'll fade away.

You know I'm hooked for you mama
That's why you sling your weight around

You Know I'm hooked for you mama
That's why you sling your weight around

But as long as your lovin' beats your hoggin'
Little Girl I'll never put you down

[2nd Verse]

You argue when I leave for work
You argue when I get home
Everything I try to do for you
You always say that I'm wrong
I bring you home all my money
Except the little I keep for expense
And when I get home to you mama you always tell me
''Ray you ain't got nooo sense''

[Chorus]

But on the other hand baby
You I can understand

Ah, But when you put your loving arms around me honey
You make me forget about everything

[3rd Verse]

I think about the lousy way you treat me
Your always-raising sin
I know that you know that I know
That you've got another man
Ah, Half the time that I'm at home
I have to go to a café and eat
And when you argue all night long 
I have to go down to the den and sleep

[Chorus]

But on the other hand baby
Your loving eases all my pain

And when you put your loving arms around me honey
You make old Ray forget about everything

Ray Charles,"Dream along with me, I'm on my way to a star 
Come along, come along, leave your worries where they are 
Up and beyond the sky, watchin' the world roll by 
Sharin' a kiss, a sigh, just use your imagination! 

On a cloud of love, we'll hear the music of night 
We can wink at the moon as we hold each other tight 
And if we go in the right direction, heaven can't be very far 
Dream along with me, I'm on my way to a star!

I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!

And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty whenever you're near

Don't you know that you're leading me on? 
And it's just what I want you to do
Can't you see that I'm hopelessly lost?
That's why I'm following you

On my own
When I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove

That the ""Southland""... 
Gave birth to the blues!

And it's just what I want you to do
Can't you see that I'm hopelessly lost?
That's why I'm following you

On my own
When I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I'm too misty, and too much in love

Too misty
And too much
Too much in love",Misty,2016

From the lips that you once fondly pressed
But the world moves apace and the loves of today
Flit away with a smile and a tear,
So you can never tell who's kissing her now
Or just whom you'll be kissing next year.

I wonder who's kissing her now, I wonder who's teaching her how,
I wonder who's looking into her eyes, breathing sighs, telling lies.
I wonder who's buying the wine for lips that I used to call mine.
I wonder if she ever tells him of me, I wonder who's kissing her now.",I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now?,2003

That had stepped deep inside
While I payed my guitar
And scribed and cried

And the nails that we jam into our hearts
Are essential and needed for the part

Does that mean, boy, I'll be lonely too

Constantly falling but nothing here remains

It is the celebration of the birth of the Christ child!
This we will never forget!
Oh, this we will never forget!
But there are other little things too!
Yes, there are other little things too!

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire,
Jack Frost nipping at your nose,
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright.
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow

Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two

Merry Christmas to you! Merry Christmas to you!

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie

Ray Conniff,"They ask me how I knew
My true love was true
I of course replied
""Something here inside
Cannot be denied""
They said ""Someday you'll find
All who love are blind""
When your heart's on fire
You must realise
Smoke gets in your eyes
So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away
I am without my love
Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say
""When a lovely flame dies
Smoke gets in your eyes""",Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,1958
Ray Conniff,"Last night I started out happy
Last night my heart was so gay
Last night I found myself dancing
In my favorite cabaret

Just an affair of the past
Then suddenly something happened to me
And I found my heart beating, oh, so fast
 
I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling, is still in my heart

A life worthwhile for you and me

And with our love through tears and thorns
We will endure as we pass surely through every storm

Really mine in the rain, in the dark, in the sun

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

Thank you for funny cards from Spain.
I recall Central Park in fall how you tore you dress,
What a mess, I confess that's not all.

Letters intertwined for all time.

Ray Conniff,"Once there were green fields kissed by the sun 
Once there were valleys where rivers used to run 
Once there was blue sky with white clouds high above 
Once they were part of an everlasting love 
We were the lovers who strolled through green fields 

Green fields are gone now, parched by the sun 
Gone from the valleys where rivers used to run 
Gone with the cold wind that swept into my heart 
Gone with the lovers who let their dreams depart 
Where are the green fields that we used to roam?

I'll never know what made you run away 
How can I keep searching when dark clouds hide the day?
I only know there's nothing here for me
Nothing in this wide world left for me to see 

But I'll keep on waitin' 'til you return 
I'll keep on waiting until the day you learn

Swinging down the street so fancy-free
Nobody you meet could ever
See the loneliness there inside you

Hey there, Georgy girl
Why do all the boys just pass you by
Could it be you just don't try
Or is it the clothes you wear

You're always window shopping
But never stopping to buy
So shed those dowdy feathers
And fly a little bit

Hey there, Georgy girl
There's another Georgy deep inside
Bring out all the love you hide
And oh, what a change there'd be
The world would see
A new Georgy girl

Inside you

Hey there, Georgy girl
Dreaming of the someone you could be
Life is a reality
You can't always run away

Don't be so scared of changing
And rearranging yourself
It's time for jumping down
From the shelf a little bit

Hey there, Georgy girl
There's another Georgy deep inside
Bring out all the love you hide
And oh, what a change there'd be
And then the world would see
A new Georgy girl

A new Georgy girl
A new Georgy girl
A new Georgy girl

He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Ray Conniff,"Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to, do you know?
Do you get what you're hoping for?
When you look behind you there's no open door.
What are you hoping for, do you know?

Once we were standing still in time,
Chasing the fantasies that filled our minds.
And you knew how I loved you but my spirit was free,
Laughing at the questions that you once asked of me.
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to, do you know?

Now looking back at all we planned,
We let so many dreams just slip through our hands.
Why must we wait so long before we see
How sad the answers to those questions can be?

Do you like the things that life is showing you?

Why don't we cross the bridge together 
And find a place that's safe and warm

Then let the fire start

Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

It's a sad thing to realize 
that you've a heart that never melts.
When we kiss, do you close your eyes,
pretending that I'm someone else?

You must break the spell,
this cloud that I'm under.
So please won't you tell, darling,
where is your heart?

Who lost his love through his indifference

And by himself, it's easy to pretend

While life goes on around him everywhere

And through the night, his sleepless nights

Ray Conniff,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",Sound of Silence,2002

I'd listened to the radio

Waitin' for my favorite songs

Waiting they played I'd sing along

It made me smile


Those were such happy times

And not so long ago

How I wondered where they'd gone

But they're back again

Just like a long lost friend

All the songs I loved so well


(*) every sha-la-la-la

Every wo-wo-wo

Still shines

Every shing-a-ling-a-ling

That they're starting to sing's

So fine


When they get to the part

Where he's breakin' her heart

It can really make me cry

Just like before

It's yesterday once more


Lookin' back on how it was

In years gone by

And the good times that I had

Makes today seem rather sad

So much has changed


It was songs of love that

I would sing to then

And I'd memorize each word

Those old melodies

Still sound so good to me

As they melt the years away

Come back clearly to me

Some can even make me cry

Just like before

Ray Conniff,"I learned the truth at seventeen
That love was meant for beauty queens
And high school girls with clear skinned smiles
Who married young and then retired
The valentines I never knew
The Friday night charades of youth
Were spent on one more beautiful
At seventeen I learned the truth

And those of us with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social graces
Desperately remained at home
Inventing lovers on the phone
Who called to say - come dance with me
And murmured vague obscenities
It isn't all it seems at seventeen

A brown eyed girl in hand me downs
Whose name I never could pronounce
Said - pity please the ones who serve
They only get what they deserve
The rich relationed hometown queen
Marries into what she needs
With a guarantee of company
And haven for the elderly

So remember those who win the game
Lose the love they sought to gain
In debentures of quality and dubious integrity
Their small-town eyes will gape at you
In dull surprise when payment due
Exceeds accounts received at seventeen

To those of us who knew the pain
Of valentines that never came
And those whose names were never called
When choosing sides for basketball
It was long ago and far away
The world was younger than today
When dreams were all they gave for free
To ugly duckling girls like me

We all play the game, and when we dare
We cheat ourselves at solitaire
Inventing lovers on the phone
Repenting other lives unknown
That call and say - come on, dance with me
And murmur vague obscenities
At ugly girls like me, at seventeen",At Seventeen,2005

Loud empty places

Morning, just another day

Looking in their eyes
I see a memory
I never realized 
How happy you made me, oh Mandy

Well you came and you gave without taking
And I sent you away, oh Mandy
And you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

I'm standing on the edge of time
Walked away when love was mine
Caught up in a world of uphill climbing
The tears are in my eyes 
And nothing is rhyming, oh Mandy

Well you came and you gave without taking
And I sent you away, oh Mandy
And you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

Then the rain begins to fall
Pitter-patter, pitter-patter, love is gone so what can matter?
No sweet lovin' man comes to call

When Sunny gets blue, she breathes a sigh of sadness
Like the wind that stirs the trees
Wind that sets the leaves to swayin' like some violins are playin'
Weird and haunting melodies

People used to love to-o-o hear her laugh, see her smile
That's how she got her name
Since that sad affair she's lost her smile, changed her style
Somehow she's not the same

But mem'ries will fade and pretty dreams will rise up
Where her other dreams fell through

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

"Ray Conniff, His Orchestra & Chorus","Why do they think up stories that link my name with yours?
Why do the neighbors chatter all day, behind their doors?
I know a way to prove what they say is quite untrue.
Here is the gist, a practical list of ""donts"" for you.

Don't throw bouquets at me
Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much
People will say we're in love!

Don't sigh and gaze at me
Your sighs are so like mine
Your eyes mustn't glow like mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't start collecting things
Give me my rose and my glove.
Sweetheart they're suspecting things
People will say we're in love.

Don't praise my charm too much
Don't look so vain with me
Don't stand in the rain with me
People will say we're in love!

Don't take my arm too much
Don't keep your hand in mine
Your hand feels so grand in mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't dance all night with me

They'll see it's alright with me
People will say we're in love.",People Will Say We're in Love,2015
"Ray Conniff, His Orchestra & Chorus","They ask me how I knew
My true love was true
I of course replied
""Something here inside
Cannot be denied""
They said ""Someday you'll find
All who love are blind""
When your heart's on fire
You must realise
Smoke gets in your eyes
So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away
I am without my love
Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say

Let's fly way up to the clouds, away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather a rainbow together we'll find

Ray Cooper,"Artilleryman: We're gonna build a whole new world for ourselves. Look, they clap eyes on us and we're dead, right? So, we gotta make a new life where they'll never find us. You know where? Underground. You should see it down there, hundreds of miles of drains, sweet and clean now after the rain, dark, quiet, safe. We can build houses and everything, start again from scratch. And what's so bad about living underground, eh? S'not been so great living up here, if you want my opinion.

Brave New World

      Artilleryman
      Take a look around you at the world we've come to know
      Does it seem to be much more than a crazy circus show
      Maybe from the madness, something beautiful will grow
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men,
      We'll start... we'll start all over again!
      All over again! All over again! All over again!

      Artilleryman: We'll build shops and hospitals and barracks, right under their noses, right under their feet. Everything we need: banks, prisons and schools. We'll send scouting parties to collect books and stuff, and then like you we'll teach the kids. Not poems and rubbish; science, so we can get everything working! We'll build villages and towns, and... and we'll play each other at cricket! Listen, maybe one day we'll capture a fighting machine, eh, learn how to make 'em ourselves, and then: WALLOP! Our turn to do some wiping out! WHOOSH! With our heat ray! Whoosh! And them running and dying, beaten at their own game, man on top again!

      Artilleryman
      Now our domination of the earth is fading fast,
      And out of the confusion a chance has come at last,
      To build a better future from the ashes of the past,
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men,
      We'll start all over again!

      Look, man is born in freedom, but he soon becomes a slave,
      In cages of convention from the cradle to the grave,
      The weak fall by the wayside but the strong will be saved,
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men,
      We'll start all over again!

      I'm not trying to tell you what to be,
      Oh no, oh no, not me...
      But if mankind is to survive, the people life alive,
      They're gonna have to build this world anew
      And it's going to have to start with me and you... YES!

      I'm not trying to tell you what to be,

      But if mankind is to survive, the people left alive,
      They're gonna have to build this world anew
      Yes and we will have to be the chosen few...

      Just think of all the poverty, the hatred and the lies,
      And imagine the destruction of all that you despise,
      Slowly from the ashes the phoenix will arise,
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men
      We'll start all over again!

      Take a look around you at the world you've loved so well,
      And bid the aging empire of man a last farewell
      It may not sound like heaven but at least it isn't hell
      It's a brave new world with just a handful of men,
      We'll start, we'll start all over again!
      All over again! All over again! All over again!
      I'VE GOT A PLAN!

      Artilleryman: Can't you just see it? Civilization starting all over again! A second chance! Heh- we'll even build a railway and tunnel to the coast, go there for our holidays! Nothing can stop men like us! I've made a start already. Come on down here and have a look.

In the cellar there was a tunnel scarcely ten yards long. It had taken him a week to dig. I could have dug that much in a day, and I suddenly had my first inkling of the gulf between his dreams and his power.

      Artilleryman: It's doing the working and the thinking that wears a fellow out. I'm ready for a bit of a rest. How about a drink, eh? Nothing but champagne now I'm the boss.

We drank, and then he insisted upon playing cards. With our species on the edge of extermination, with no prospect but a horrible death, we actually played games. Later he talked more of his plan, but I saw flames flashing in the deep blue night, red weed glowing, tripod figures moving distantly, and I put down my champagne glass. I felt a traitor to my kind, and I knew I must leave this strange dreamer.

Ray Cooper,"There were a dozen dead bodies in the Euston road, their outlines softened by the black dust. All was still, houses locked and empty, shops closed, but looters had helped themselves to wine and food, and outside a jewelers some gold chains and a watch were scattered on the pavement.

      Martian: Ulla!

I stopped, staring towards the sound. It seemed as if that mighty desert of houses had found a voice for its fear and solitude.

      Martian: Ulla!

The desolating cry worked upon my mind. The wailing took possession of me. I was intensely weary, footsore, hungry and thirsty. Why was I wandering alone in this city of the dead? Why was I alive when London was lying in state in its black shroud? I felt intolerably lonely, drifting from street to empty street, drawn inexorably towards that cry.

      Martian: Ulla!

I saw, over the trees on Primrose Hill, the fighting machine from which the howling came. I crossed Regent's Canal. There stood a second machine, upright, but as still as the first.

      Martian: Ulla!

Abruptly, the sound ceased. Suddenly the desolation, the solitude, became unendurable. While that voice sounded London still seemed alive. now suddenly there was a change, the passing of something, and all that remained was this gaunt quiet.
I looked up, and saw a third machine. It was erect and motionless, like the others. An insane resolve possessed me: I would give my life to the Martians, here and now.
I marched recklessly towards the titan and saw that a multitude of black birds were circling and clustering about the hood. I began running along the road. I felt no fear, only a wild, trembling exultation as I ran up the hill towards the monster. Out of the hood hung red shreds, at which the hungry birds now pecked and tore.
I scrambled up to the crest of Primrose hill, the Martian's camp was below me. A mighty space it was, and scattered about it, in their overturned machines, were the Martians, slain after all man's devices had failed by the humblest creatures on the earth: bacteria. Minute, invisible, bacteria. Directly the invaders arrived and drank and fed, our microscopic allies attacked them. From that moment, they were doomed.
The torment was ended. The people scattered over the country, desperate, leaderless, starved, the thousands who had fled by sea including the one most dear to me; all could return, the pulse of life growing stronger and stronger would beat again.
As life returns to normal, the question of another attack from Mars causes universal concern. Is our planet safe, or is this time of peace merely a reprieve? It may be that across the immensity of space, they have learned their lessons , and even now await their opportunity. Perhaps the future belongs not to us, but to the Martians.",Dead London [Early Band Run-Through],1981
